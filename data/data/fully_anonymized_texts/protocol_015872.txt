1.0 INTRODUCTION (SIGNIFICANCE,  RATIONALE,  & HYPOTHESES):  
Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the [LOCATION_002]  
(US) and Delaware,1 claiming more than 400,000 US lives each year.2 Tobacco use disorder  
(TUD), or the long- term problematic use of tobacco, has been recognized by [CONTACT_843645] a substance use/behavioral health condition (see 3). The burdens of  
TUD disproportionately affect racial minorities and those with low socioeconomic status (SES),  
thereby [CONTACT_843646]- related health disparities (TRHDs).[ADDRESS_1172437] the potential to reach large segments of this underserved population. A Cochrane review found that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based interventions significantly increase 
smoking cessation rates compared to usual care;
8 however, rates rarely exceed 25%. Promising  
new evidence suggests that applying a preci sion pharmacotherapy approach based on the 
nicotine metabolite ration (NMR), a commercially available, genetically -informed marker of  
nicotine metabolism rate can significantly improve cessation outcomes. Evidence from multiple independent studies,
9–12 including a recent randomized clinical trial (RCT),[ADDRESS_1172438] that personalized treatment recommendations  
may increase TUD medication uptake and effectiveness.
14,15 Thus, the scientific premise of this  
application is that integrating a precision pharmacotherapy approach into a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based TUD  
treatment program will increase medication uptake and effectiveness, with particular relevance 
for smokers  from underserved  communities.  
2.0 STUDY  POPULATION:  
Approximately 100 adult current smokers ( > 5 cigarettes/day), who are patients at the H elen F.  
Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute (Christiana Care) lung/thoracic clinic who are ages  
18 and older. Exclusion criteria include: 1) use of non- cigarette tobacco products or current TUD  
treatment, 2) psychiatric or other medical contraindicat ions to receiving TUD medication 
(assessed by [CONTACT_5989]), 3) no telephone, 4) medical instability, 7) inability to 
communicate in English, 8) unable to consent due to mental status, 9) estimated life expectancy  
of < 6 months,  10) pregnancy.  
The duration of study participation will be approximately [ADDRESS_1172439] through the final  
study  visit. 
3.0 STUDY  PROCEDURES:  
3.1 Overview  of Proposed  Research  Design  
This investigation employs a randomized controlled trial (RCT) study design. Participants will be 
randomized into either precision pharmacotherapy, where they will receive a personally -tailored 
recommendation for a TUD medication based on their NMR plus st andard care, or to standard 
care only. Standard care will adhere to the Ask -Advise -Connect model where participants are 
asked about tobacco use, advised to quit smoking, offered a choice of FDA -approved TUD  
medication and offered a referral to the Delaware Quitline for access to counseling services and  
medications.  
Upon enrollment into the study, the research assistant will verify demographic data, administer a baseline survey, and coordinate testing for the NMR at their in- person intake visit. Patients will  
be randomized to the precision or standard care arms in a 1:[ADDRESS_1172440] care, the research assistant  
will provide information on FDA -approved TUD medications and offer to coordinate the process  
of starting on a medication of the participants’ choice (i.e., nicotine patch or varenicline), which 
participants can decline. Participants randomized to precision pharmacotherapy will be provided 
with their NMR result, information on how NMR impacts TUD treatment, and a personalized 
recommendation for medication based on their NMR result (i.e., varenicline for faster  
metabolizers, nicotine patch for slower metabolizers). Similar to standard care procedures,  
participants will be offered either the nicotine patch or varenicline and will not be required to 
choose the medication based on their personalized recommendation, or any medication. For  
participants in both conditions who opt for medication, per participant preference, medications  
can be prescribed by [CONTACT_5989] ([CONTACT_843656]) or the patient can be referred to the 
Delaware Quitline for no- cost medications, a free service available to all Delaware residents. A  
1-week follow -up telephonic visit will be conducted to collect data related to medication use, quit  
date or smoking rate, and side -effects. Finally, a 1- month follow -up in- person visit will be  
arranged to complete  a follow- up survey and to assess  smoking  status.  
3.2 Participant  Identification and Recruitment  
With the support of Brian Nam, MD, thoracic surgeon, and lead for the “Lung Health Clinic” in  
the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute and Gretchen Makai, MD,  
gynecologist and Director of the Division of Minimally Invasive Gynecologic Surgery at  
ChristianaCare, the research assistant will meet with prospective participants in the clinic or the 
Center  for Advanced  GYN  & Minimally  Invasive  Surgery  to screen  for eligibility,  discuss study  
procedures, answer questions, and if appropriate review the consent and HIPPA forms. Patients  
will be clearly informed that not participating in this study will not preclude engaging in other  
smoking cessation  programs,  nor will accepting medication be a condition of participation.  
Vulnerable Populations: Pregnant women and fetuses, children, neonates, and prisoners are 
not included in this research study. Women who are pregnant at the time of the baseline assessments will not be eligible for the study. Wom en will be advised to notify the study staff if  
they become  or intend  to become pregnant  during the study  period.  
Populations vulnerable to undo influence or coercion: Educationally or economically  
disadvantaged persons are included but not solely targeted  for recruitment. Cognitively impaired 
persons, including those with poorly managed serious psychiatric conditions, are not included in 
the current  study.  
The study consent includes language that informs participants that their care will not be affected 
if they choose not to participate in the study or withdraw after enrollment. The Principal  
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_843639], to protect the participant for  
reasons related to safety, or for administrative reasons. Whether o r not each participant  
completes  the study  will be tracked.  
3.3 Study  Procedures  & Data  Collection  
The following study procedures will be implemented. A description of the measures used to collect  data during these  procedures  is provided  below.  
• Intake  Session (completed during clinic  visit) 
• Participants will complete a self -report survey of demographics , smoking history, and 
beliefs  about  the use of smoking cessation  aids.  
• [Women only ] A pregnancy screen will be administered for women capable of  
becoming pregnant (55 and under). NOTE: For safety reasons, pregnant women will  
not be eligible  to participate in the research  study.  
• The research assistant will complete the blood draw to be used for a nicotine 
metabolite ratio (NMR) test and arrange for the sample to be transported to the 
laboratory  for processing.  
• Randomization: Following completion of the ‘intake session’ and receipt of NMR testing 
results,  participants  will be randomized  in a 1:1 ratio to either  of the following  conditions:  
• Treatment P lan Option 1 (Standard Care) : Standard smoking cessation counseling 
will be offered + participant choice of nicotine patches or varenicline. Participants are  
also free to decline either  medication.  
• Treatment Plan Option 2 (Precision Pharmacotherapy) : Standard smoking cessation 
counseling will be offered + a recommendation to take either the nicotine patch or  
varenicline based on the results of the NMR test. Regardless of the  
recommendation, it would still remain the participant’s choice to be prescribed either  
nicotine patches or varenicline. Participants are also free to decline either  
medication.  
• Pre-Quit Telephonic Visit : This visit will take place after the NMR results have been 
received and randomization is complete, approximately 7- 14 days following the intake 
session  (depending  on lab processing  time).  
• Participants will be informed of their treatment conditi on, including the recommended  
medication if assigned to ‘treatment plan option 2’ (i.e., the precision 
pharmacotherapy  arm).  
• Participants will be offered their choice of either the nicotine patch or varenicline.  
Participants will be reminded that taking medication is not a condition of participation 
in the study. In addition, participants assigned to ‘treatment plan option 2’ (i.e., the 
precision pharmacotherapy arm) will not be required to accept only the medication 
recommended to them  based on the results  of NMR  testing  
• For participants who elect to take a medication, the research assistant will  
communicate with the study physician ([CONTACT_843656]), or the investigators at the Center  
for Advanced GYN & Minimally Invasive ([CONTACT_843657] or [CONTACT_843658]) to arrange for  a 
prescription and/or  referral  to the Delaware  Quitline,  per participant  preference.  
• Even for participants who receive a prescription in the clinic or at the Center for  
Advanced GYN & Minimally Invasive Surgery, a referral to speak with a smoking 
cessation counselor, which is made available at no- cost to all Delaware residents  
through the Delaware  Quitline.  
• Follow -up Telephonic Visit : This session will occur one week afte r the pre -quit 
telephonic/virtual  visit. 
• Participants will answer brief questions regarding medication use, quit date or  
smoking rate if still smoking,  and side effects. 
• In-Person Assessment : This session will occur four weeks after the pre -quit 
telephonic /virtual  visit. The research assistant  will arrange to meet  participants  at the 
clinic.  
• Participants will again complete a brief assessment of medication use, quit date or  
smoking rate if still smoking,  and side effects. 
• Participants who self -report smoking cessation will complete a carbon monoxide  
(CO) reading by [CONTACT_431169] a machine provide a biochemical confirmation of  
smoking status.  
The measures  referenced above will be administered accordingly:

• Demographics. The research assistant will confirm demographic data collected from  
the EHR  and collect  additional characteristics,  including address,  phone number,  
date of birth,  race/ethnicity,  employment  status,  education level,  and income.  
• Smoking history. Participants will be asked standard questions about cigarette use,  
including the number of cigarettes smoked per day, the age of smoking onset,  
whether the participant ever quit smoking previously and f or how long, and whether  
the participant ever utilized smoking cessation aids previously. In addition,  
participants will be administered the first item from the Fageström Test for Nicotine 
Dependence (FTND),  a measure  of nicotine tolerance and withdrawal.17 
• Nicotine Metabolite Ratio (NMR). NMR testing for cotinine and [ADDRESS_1172441] procedures at a commercial laboratory contracted with 
ChristianaCare (i.e., Quest).19 
• Medication use quit date or smoking rate, and side effects. At the follow -up call  
and in- person assessment, the research assistant will use the timeline follow -back  
interview method20 to ask participants whether they quit smoking (including the quit  
date).  If participants did not successfully quit smoking, current rates of smoking will  
be assessed. In addition, the research assistant will ask about medication usage and 
side-effects.  
• Carbon monoxide reading. For participants self -reporting smoking cessation,  
biochemical verification of smoking status will be conducted with the use of a breath 
carbon monoxide monitor manufactured by [CONTACT_843647].21 
4.0 RISKS  AND BENEFITS  TO PARTICIPANTS:  
4.[ADDRESS_1172442] for 10-14 days.  These symptoms  include:  
• Sadness  and mood  changes  
• Insomnia  or changes  in sleep 
• Constipation 
• Decreased heart  rate 
• Irritability  
• Craving  for cigarettes  
• Anger

• Appetite increase and weight  gain 
Nicotine  Patch  
The potential  side effects  of the nicotine  patch  are described below:  
Most Common Side Effects. Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, weakness, and rapid heartbeat are 
side effects that occur rarely, but are most often caused by [CONTACT_843648].  Difficulty  breathing or a notable rash could  be the symptoms  of an allergic  reaction.  
Skin Reactions. The most common skin reactions to the pa tch are skin redness, rash or  
swelling, itching, bumpi[INVESTIGATOR_843640]. To minimize these reactions, the site of  
the patch  can be changed each  day. 
Sleep Disturbances. When using the patch, some people also report difficulties sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_33096] v ivid 
dreams.  However,  this is rare and can be minimized  by [CONTACT_843649].  
Other Nicotine Patch Risks. These include risks to children and pets if the nicotine patches are  
not stored or disposed of properly. Unused and used patches have enough nicotine to poison 
children and pets.  
Varenicline (Chantix®)  
The potential  side effects  of taking varenicline  are described below:  
Most Common Side Effects. Potential side effects of taking varenicline are nausea, sleep 
disturbance, constipation, flatulence (gas), or vomiting. These can occur in more than 5% of  
people taking this medication.  
Allergic Reactions . There have been rare reports of allergic and skin reactions to varenicline,  
including swelling of the face, mouth (tongue, lips, and gums), extremities, and neck (throat and 
larynx).  These  types  of allergic  reactions  are considered serious  and may be life-threatening.  
However, the risk for these reactions is small (about 1 out of 1000 people taking this  
medication).  
Mood- related Side Effects . Rare serious mood- related effects have been reported in a small  
number of persons taking varenicline. The risk for this type of reaction is about [ADDRESS_1172443] rates or any exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms  
between those taking  varenicline versus  placebo.  
Cardiac  Side Effects . Varenicline may be associated with an increased risk for certain cardiac  
(heart) and vascular (blood vessel) side effects, including chest pain, heart attack, stroke,  
shortness of breath, calf pain when walking or sudden onset of weakness, numbness or  
difficulty speaking. One study showed that  these risks are rare (~1% or 1 out of 100 people 
using varenicline) but a later study found no difference between placebo and varenicline in 
terms  of these  cardiac  risks.  
Somnambulism. Cases of somnambulism (sleep walking) have been reported in patients taking 
varenicline.  
Brief Cognitive Side Effects. Varenicline may cause noticeable drowsiness, dizziness,  
headache, loss of consciousness, or difficulty concentrating that may impair one’s ability to 
perform tasks requiring judgment or motor and c ognitive skills such as driving a car and 
operating machinery.  
Risk of Seizure. Varenicline may be associated with new or worsening seizures during the first  
month  of treatment.  Some  patients  who reported experiencing a seizure while  taking varenicline 
had no prior history of seizures, whereas others had a history of seizure disorder that was  
remote  or well-controlled.  
Potential Interaction with Alcohol. It is possible that varenicline may affect response to alcohol.  
Some individuals have reported lower alcohol tolerance, aggressive behavior, or impaired 
memory following consumption of alcohol during varenicline treatment. In these cases, the  
amount of alc ohol consumed was not sufficient to explain the event. It is best to minimize or  
reduce alcohol  intake  (no more  than 3 drinks  per occasion  or within  a 24-hour time period).  
Other  Risks  
Assessments/Questionnaires  and Smoking Cessation Counseling.  Some  peopl e can 
experience anxiety and other types of general distress when they complete questionnaires. This  
is generally related learning about some of the health risks associated with smoking. These  
reactions  are usually  very mild and typi[INVESTIGATOR_843641].  
Threats  to Privacy/Confidentiality.  Every  attempt  will be made by [CONTACT_843650]. However, social harms may result  
when sensitive  and personal  information is inappropriately  disclosed.  Inappropriate disclosure  
of study data about participants’ beliefs, attitudes, behavior (i ncluding smoking), and health may  
result  in damage  to participants’  economic  status. These  harms  can include  loss of 
employment,  health insurance,  life insurance,  housing,  and ability  to travel.  
Reproductive Risks [Females Only]. Because of the effects of varenicline and the nicotine 
patch, there could be serious harm to unborn children or children who are breast -feeding.  
These effects could also harm the mother. It is also possible that harmful s ide effects that are 
not yet known could happen to both the mother  and unborn or breast -feeding child.  
4.[ADDRESS_1172444] the threats to privacy/confidentiality, safeguards will be put into place to 
minimize the risk of unauthorized access to records (see section 6.0). To minimize the  
reproductive risks, female participants 55 and under will be screened for pregnancy and advised to use birth control.  Pregnant  women  or women  who intend  to become pregna nt will be 
excluded from participation. Women will also be advised to inform study personnel in the event  
they become  pregnant.  
4.3 Potential  Benefits  
Smoking remains the leading preventable cause of early mortality in the US. The proposed 
research is a clinic al trial that will evaluate FDA -approved medications for smoking cessation,  
customized to individual smokers’ nicotine metabolism. Prior research has demonstrated that  
such an approach can significantly increase abstinence rates. Therefore, the potential benefits  
of the proposed research include a greater likelihood of smoking cessation and the 
corresponding health benefits, including longer life expectancy. In addition, this research may  
benefit others by [CONTACT_843651].  
4.4 Participant  Renumeration 
Participants can be remunerated up to $50 for participation in this trial, $25 for each of the two 
in-person data collection  visits.  
5.0 DATA  SAFETY MONITORING  PLAN  (DSMP)  
For this study, we will use all established ChristianaCare procedures and infrastructure for data 
and safety monitoring. A Data Safety Monitoring Board will not be used for this study because it  
is a single center trial that w ill use FDA -approved drugs with good safety profiles for on- label  
use. During the course of the study, safety and data quality monitoring will be performed on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_30496]. Study personnel are responsible for collecting and 
recording all clinical data using the established operating procedures. This includes ensuring 
that all source document exist for the data on Case Report Forms, ensuring all fields are 
completed appropriately, and ensuring that all corrections are done acc ording to Good Clinical  
Practice. Any inconsistencies or deviations will be documented. The study Key Personnel,  
which include the study physician ([CONTACT_843656]), will review data on an ongoing basis and will  
document reviews by [CONTACT_843652]. S tudy personnel conduct 100% quality  
assurance on data,  comparing all hard copy  to electronic  files. 
Staff training will consist of an explanation of the protocol and review of the Case Report Forms.  
In addition, the duties of each staff person will be outl ine and all applicable regulations will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_978]. Mock sessions with critical feedback will be conducted by [CONTACT_978]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_843642].  
Monitoring will be conducted in accordance with the ChristianaCare Institutional Review Board IRB) procedures (SOP: 402.1) regarding Adverse Events. Study staff will administer a side 
effects checklist to determine any reporting requirements. Should a report rise to the level of a 
potential Adverse Event, the decision on the course of action for the participant will be 
determined by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Nam after review of the review. In addition, both personnel and participants  
will be given the contact [CONTACT_843653] a member of the study between 
assessments. The research team will clinically follow all participants who are discontinued due 
to a Serious Adverse Event until it resolves and becomes stable, unless a referral to another  
physician (e.g., specialist) is clinical indicated or requested by [CONTACT_2299]. All Adverse 
Events  and Serious  Adverse Events  will be documented  on a ChristianaCare IRB Adverse  
Event Form. This information will, in turn, be reported immediately to all necessary regulatory  
committees  and maintained in a unique databased to be reviewed monthly  by [CONTACT_978]. 
6.0 USE OF PHI AND STORAGE  OF STUDY  RECORDS:  
Self-report, blood, and medical data will be collected and stored as part of this study. Therefore,  
to protect participant privacy and confidentiality, several safeguards will be implemented to 
prevent unauthorized access to study data. A unique identification number will be generated for  
each participant to be used in the dataset that contains collected data. A separate table, housed 
in a unique location, will be created for storing participant name, address, and telephone contact  
[CONTACT_3031]. Using this method, no identifying participant information will be directly linked to medical information or other study data. Data will be stored on an electronic folder dedicated to  
research with access limited to only authorized research personnel on the study protocol. Paper  
documentation will be stored in a badge protected office in the locked drawer of the resear ch 
coordinator’s desk. Data cannot be transferred to personal computers or other memory devices.  
In the very rare event of a breach of confidentiality, all IRB procedures will be followed, affected 
participants will be notified, and appropriate corrective measures to secure the data will be 
taken. In addition, participants will be provided with any reasonable assistance to help mitigate the risk. The results of this study will be presented only in a summary and/or deidentified fashion 
in peer-reviewed  publications  and research presentations.  
Information about study participants will be kept confidential and managed according to the 
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Ac t of 1996 (HIPAA). Those 
regulations  require a signed participant  authorization informing the participant  of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from the participants in the  
study  
• Who will have  access  to that informatio n and for what  purposes  
• Who will use or disclose  that information 
• The rights  of the research participant  to revoke  their authorization for use of their PHI 
In the even  that a participant  revokes  authorization  to collect  or use PHI, the PI, by [CONTACT_5151],  
retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of participant  
authorization.  
The following  PHI will be collected on study  participants:  
• Name  
• Age 
• ICD Codes  
• Street  Address  
• Zip Code 
• Medical  Record Number  
• Sex 
• City 
• Race  
• Insurance  
• County  
• Birth Date 
• Telephone Number

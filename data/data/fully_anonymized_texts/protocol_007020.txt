Study Rationale  Levetiracetam (LEV ) is a generic drug used in long -term epi[INVESTIGATOR_573162], with known pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
properties. It is relatively safe and has an acceptable side -effect 
profile. A novel extended release formulation of AGB101 (220 mg 
of levetiracetam) was  developed to allow for once -daily dosing in 
amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). So far, no studies have 
been conducted to see if a low dose of AGB101 can effectively 
reduce the network dysfunction in cognitively normal subjects who 
are APOE 4 carrie rs. The pre -dementia state among APOE 4 
carriers can be identified by [CONTACT_573191]. Considering this, use of AGB101  to reduce the 
network dysfunction in cognitively normal subjects who are APOE 
4 carriers should  be explored.

6    Protocol v 5 01Apr2019  1. STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
Neuropathological, structural, and functional changes related to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) may begin 
insidiously, [ADDRESS_752538] our 
hypothesis that, during the preclinical AD developmental phase in cognitively normal (CN) older  
subjects  with the apolipoprotein E  ε4 (APOE  4) allele , decreased abnormal hyperfunctional 
connectivity can be correlated with improve d epi[INVESTIGATOR_10682] (EM) using a perturbation , such as 
AGB101 low dose levetiracetam  extended release formulation  The major pi[INVESTIGATOR_573165] . 
 
1.1. Justification of Selecting  CN Subjects with the APOE [ADDRESS_752539] a higher risk of converting from CN to mild cognitive impairment ( MCI) 
than noncarriers (1-3). In fact, more than 50% of AD patients are carriers of the APOE 4 allele (4-6). 
Converging evidence shows that CN, older individuals with the APOE [ADDRESS_752540] functional network 
disruption (7-13), increased Aβ accumulation (14), decreased memory function (7, 8, 12) , and decreased brain 
volume (15-18), consistent with AD patterns. It is likely that these patterns are detectable at the preclinical AD 
stage. If we are able to elucidate the mechanisms linking preclinical network disruption and the emergence of 
clinical symptoms, we can us e this critical window of time for potential intervention with disease -modifying 
therapy. It is evident that selecting CN subjects with the APOE 4 allele  will facilitate such a preventive strategy.  
 
1.2. Objective  
A low dose  of LEV (125 mg , twice daily [BID]) can reduce task -induced hippocampal hyperactivity and improve 
fMRI task performance  in human subjects with MCI . Pi[INVESTIGATOR_573166], among 
several antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_006], LEV suppresses neural hyperactivity and revers es synaptic and cognitive deficits in 
AD mice models (19-21). Recent research further demonstrates that a low dose of LEV  can reduce task -
induced hippocampal hyperactivity in human MCI subjects (22, 23) . This proof -of-principle human study 
suggest s that abnormal neural activity may deteriorate memory function (24) and that AD-related neural 
network dysfunctions are an early and potentially treatable disease component (25-31). So far, no data are 
available to demonstrate if LEV perturbation can reduce abnormal network activity and concurrently improve 
memory decline in CN, older subjects  with the APOE 4 allele . To fill this gap, our  specific aim  follows:   
 
Specific Aim 1 . Determine network -level changes  in hippocamp al functional connectivity (HFC) after a low-
dose AGB101 levetiracetam extended release perturbation  (220 mg, QD) for a 2-week  period in a 
randomized, double -blind, and placebo -controlled study with 50 cognitively normal (CN) o lder subjects  
(ranging in age from 55 to 75 years) , of which [ADDRESS_752541] our proposed hypothesis :  
 
• Primary outcome measures:  Network  changes  in the bilateral sensory motor cortex regions  of the 
HFC after AGB101 perturbation  (time frame:  2 weeks ) 
• Secondary outcome measures:  EM performance and neuropsychological test battery as assessed at 
baseline  and the post-perturbation procedure s (time frame:  2 weeks ) 
 
1.4. Impact of the Proposed Study   
Currently, no FDA -approved therapy exists for CN , older subjects who have abnormal functional connectivity 
and an increased risk for progression to dementia. If this mechanistic approach is successful, we will lay a 
conceptual framework for future clinical preventive trials in CN subjects with abnormal functional connectivity. 
Analogous to the use of baby [CONTACT_6149][INVESTIGATOR_573167], we hope a daily low dose of 
AGB101 will effectively  prevent or slow memory decline.  
 
  
7    Protocol v 5 01Apr2019  2. BACKGROUND  AND SIGNIFICANCE  
2.1. Background  
Substantial evidence supports our  network dysfunction hypothesis that pathophysiological events may be 
“upstream” of amyloid -β1-42 protein ( Aβ) accumulation : 1) Early network dysfunction has been reported before 
detectable Aβ formation (9) in certain subjects, such  as young APOE 4 carriers  (10, 11, 32) , supporting the 
antagonistic pleiotropic trajectory and insidious network  dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease ( AD) progression 
(33). 2) Abnormal hyperactivity stimulates Aβ formation and toxicity (26-31, 34) , as evidenced by [CONTACT_573192] Aβ -binding regions overlap the default mode network (DMN) regions (12, 13, 35 -37). 3) Subjects with AD 
risk factors, including APOE 4 carriers (13, 38)  and individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment ( aMCI ) 
(39-41), manifest network dysfunction abnormalities . 4) Network dysfunctions have been found in the DMN, 
salience  network, executive control network, dorsal attention network, etc. (12, 42) , consistent with AD 
pathology . 5) Abnormal network activity impairs memory function (24), and different dementia types target 
specific neural  network sets (43). 6) Most importantly, recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_573168], such  as LEV, target network dysfunctions by [CONTACT_573193] (19-21) and in aMCI subjects (22). Both 
hyperactive (44) and hypoactive (45) circuits can have a negative impact on the disease process. In the 
present study, we will robustly identify and measure the dysfunctional  networks as biomarkers in CN older 
subjects.  
 
Abnormal hyper -HFC at the network level may be upstream of the underlying neurodegenerative processes.  
Recently, we published an article that discusses use of the rigorous event -based probability model to 
comprehensively demonstrate that, during the decade -long progression from the preclinical phase of AD to 
overt AD dementia, certain neuropathological, structural, and functional events (measur ed by [CONTACT_573194]) occur sequentially. Abnormal functional connectivity occurs first, followed by a decrease in the 
level of Aβ and an increase in the level of phosphorylated tau proteins in the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872]; in turn, there 
is a decrease in s tructural brain volume, MCI, and the full manifestation of AD dementia. These results indicate 
that abnormal hippocampus hyperfunctional connectivity at the network level could be upstream of the 
underlying neurodegenerative processes, even before the leve l of Aβ is detectable in the brain (46, 47) .  
 
2.2. Significance  
If this mechanistic study succeeds, we will be able to 1) provide conceptual proof that AD development can be 
prevented or delayed by [CONTACT_573195] , thus  facilitat ing early 
intervention , even in CN, older subject s (48); 2) identify subject groups that have no clinical symptoms  but 
have hyperfunctional connectivity (e.g.,  APOE 4 allele  carriers who are at high risk for AD development ), which  
may prove to be a powerful strategy to decrease or halt cognitive decline ; 3) monito r whether drug intervention 
reaches specific neural network targets and assess the network level responses; 4) predict if the network 
activity modulation can concurrently improve memory decline;  and 5) provide essential information needed to 
prepar e future clinical preventive trials . The long preclinical phase provides a critical window of time for 
potential intervention with disease -modifying therapy.  
 
This study provide s network -level mechanisms that emphasize that dysfunctional networks at the preclinical 
phase can be target ed for secondary prevention at the asymptomatic stage before significant cognitive 
impairment. Specifically, we will focus on the following:  
 
• Preclinical AD Development Phase.  Currently, three clinical trials are being conducted with LEV in the 
AD research field. Two are testing whether LEV can help  AD subjects control seizure -like activity and 
provide cognitive benefit s to AD patients , particularly in individuals with  silent e pi[INVESTIGATOR_41726] . The other is 
testing whether  the daily use of low -dose LEV (125 mg, BID) administered to MCI subjects can improve 
memory function . Details of these three trials are presented on  the clintrials.gov  website 
(https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT015 [ZIP_CODE] , https://clinic altrials.gov/ct2/show/[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] , and 
https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT0104 4758 , respectively) . In contrast, we propose study ing CN 
subject s with the APOE 4 allele  to reveal if the reduce d hyper -HFC and improve d EM decline  are 
correlated . If this study is successful  with CN subjects , we can take full advantage of this critical window of 
time (i.e., the long preclinical phase before significant cognitive impairment ) and potential ly interven e with 
disease -modifying therapy .  
8    Protocol v 5 01Apr2019  • Enrich ed Testing of Subjects with APOE 4 Allele . As stated, more than 50 % of AD patients are carriers 
of the APOE  4 allele (4-6). The APOE [ADDRESS_752542] important genetic risk factor for 
late-onset AD. The APOE polymorphism modulates the risk of late -onset AD in an isoform -dependent 
manner (ε4>ε3>ε2) (49, 50) . The APOE 4 allele  accentuates cerebral amyloid deposition, structural and 
functional abnormalities, and memory decline in cognitively healthy adults.  By [CONTACT_573196] 4 allele 
carriers at high risk for AD development with a dai ly low dose of AGB101  (220 mg, QD) at the preclinical 
phase, it will be possible  to determine if hyper -HFC is reduced and the memory decline  is improve d. 
  
3. RATIONALE  
3.1. General Information Regarding LEV  
LEV (Keppra®) is FDA approved worldwide. It is the  most commonly approved drug for adjunctive treatment of 
partial, primary generalized tonic -clonic , and myoclonic seizures for use in adults and children as young as one 
month. LEV has a novel structure and unique mechanisms of action , although detailed me chanisms for its 
antiseizure activity are still  unclear (51). Unlike other antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_006], LEV ’s action mechanisms appear to 
involve neuronal binding to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein SV2A (52), inhibiting calcium release from 
intraneuronal stores, opposing the activity of negative modulators of GABA - and glycin e-gated c urrents , and 
inhibiting excessive synchronized activity between neurons (53). In addition, LEV inhibits N -type calcium 
channels. This is believed to impede impulse conduction across synapses (54). LEV is associated with rapid 
and complete absorption, high oral bioavailability, minimal metabolism , and primarily renal elimination. It lacks 
cytochrome P450 isoenzyme -inducing potential and is not associa ted with clinically significant pharmacokinetic 
interactions with other drugs, including other antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_006] (55). AGB101 has been developed as a novel 
extended release formulation of low dose levetiracetam (below clinically marketed doses for epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]) for 
slowing the progression of amnestic mild  cognitive impairment. AGB101 is formulated at a strength of 220 mg 
consisting of Levetiracetam, Hypromellose (Methocel K15M Premium CR), Colloidal Silicon Dioxide, Silicified 
Microcrystalline Cellulose (ProSolv HD90), Magnesium Stearate and coated with Op adry.  
 
3.2. Justification of Treatment  Selection  
So far, no stud ies have been conducted to see if a low dose of LEV can effectively reduce the network 
dysfunction in CN subjects who are APOE [ADDRESS_752543] 
LEV as the perturbation in this study . 1) Pi[INVESTIGATOR_573169] a dysfunction condition that may be key in underlying , age-related impairment in  hippocampal -
dependent memory processes. With a rat model, Koh et al. showed that a low dose of LEV can improve 
memory in aged rats (19). 2) A comprehensive study showed that , with the  human APP mice model, acute 
LEV treatment reduces abnormal activity spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] s. Chronic  LEV improves learning and  memory, and reverses 
behavioral abnormalities and synaptic deficits in the hippocampus (20). With a transgenic  mouse model of AD 
(5XFAD mice), Devi et al. recently suggested that suppressing overexcitation with acute  LEV treatment around  
the time of acquisition or early consolidation of memory may be sufficient to reverse memory  decline 
associated with aging (21). 3) A recent human study showed that LEV treatment (125 mg , BID) for two weeks  
suppressed task -induced hyper -blood oxygen level dependent ( BOLD ) signals in aMCI subjects  (22). 4) LEV 
has minimal interactions with other drugs. This is significant because older subjects often take many other  
drugs. 5) Most importantly, because LEV may impede impulse conduction across synapses and suppress  
neural hyperactivity (23), we can employ the resting -state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( rfMRI ) 
method to detect and determine how LEV modulates or normalizes dysfunctional networks, and whether the 
normalization of network functions can stop or delay EM decline or even improve memory.  6) The selecti on of  
low LEV doses.  Within a low dose range between 5 –10 mg/kg in a rat model, LEV effectively suppressed 
hyperactivity  and improved memory performance (19-21, 55) . Further findings demonstrated that  a low dose of  
LEV improves memory in aged  rats with cognitive impairment , but it does not at high doses (19). Many studies 
showed that LEV treatment at high doses creates a loss of antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_573170] (20, 
56-58) in rodents and in a small portion of patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (59, 60) . For the present study , we have 
select ed a 220 mg, QD dose of AGB101 levetiracetam extended release  which is about 10 times less than the 
clinical antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_573171], for CN subjects carrying the APOE 4 allele . 7) Selection of duration  of LEV 
perturbation . According to an animal model (20), although acute LEV can eff ectively suppress hyperactivity, 
the transient reduction of the abnormal spi[INVESTIGATOR_573172] 
[ADDRESS_752544] s that long -term LEV 
perturbation is necessary to provide the time for network adaptation and normality. As such, w e designed a 2-
week , low -dose LEV perturbation  study  to address two questions : One, can a low dose  of LEV  decrease 
abnormal hyper -HFC?  Two, will the decreased functional connectivity  ameliorate EM decline ? 
 
3.3.  Preliminary Results  
Higher HFC activity correlate s with greater  EM decline in CN APOE 4 carriers.  To investigate if high HFC 
activity is detrimental to EM in CN APOE 4 carriers , 21 CN subjects with APOE  4 (aged 66.62 ± 5.84 years) 
and 27 CN subjects with APOE ε3ε3 (APOE 3) (aged 70.11  ± 5.23 years) were recruited in a two -year 
longitudinal study. Structural and rfMRI data were obtained, and changes in EM scores were recorded. The EM 
scores included the auditory verbal learning test (AVLT) and logical memory test (LMT) , which are the two 
most common EM assessments and are used in various multicenter studies. These tests also can detect 
accelerated EM decline in cognitively normal APOE 4 carriers  (61). As shown in Fig. 1a, CN APOE ε3ε3 
subjects exhibited neural correlates of EM function in the Papez circuit regions . However, the baseline HFC  
activity does not correlate with the rate of EM decline (data not shown) .  
 
Conversely , CN APOE  4 carriers exhibited neural correlates of EM function in the bilateral sensory motor 
cortex regions (Fig.  1b) and t he baseline HFC activity in the sensory motor cortex negatively correlated with 
the annual rate of EM change  (Fig. 1c). These results suggest  that APOE ε3ε3 and APOE 4 alleles  encode 
different network system s for EM functions , demonstrat ing genetic regulation. Further, higher HFC activity  
predicts a faster annual rate of EM decline in APOE 4 carriers but not in APOE ε3ε3 subjects . The baseline 
HFC activity in the sensory motor cortex predicts the rate of EM decline: the higher the activity, the faster the 
rate of decline. Most importantly, these  results have been validated with independent datasets from ADNI 2 
(Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) with 14 CN APOE 4 carriers ( aged 71.95  ± 4.67 years), a s 
shown in Fig.  1d. These results suggest that activity in Papez circuit commonly mediates EM function without 
causing EM decline  in APOE ε3ε3 subjects , whereas , in APOE [ADDRESS_752545] the annual rate of EM decline  (Figs. 1c and 1 d). These 
preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility  of detecting  abnormal network activity and correlat ing it  with EM 
decline. We will test our hypothesis that decreased hyperfunctional connectivity can be correlated with 
improved EM using a daily, low -dose LEV perturbation  (AGB101 levetiracetam extended release) .

STUDY  DESIGN  
4.1. Overall Design   
This study will test the hypothesis that decreased abnormal hyperfunctional connectivity can be 
correlated with improved EM using a daily, low -dose LEV  perturbation  (AGB101 levetiracetam 
extended release) . In this study, t here are two study groups : APOE 4 carriers (n=25) and APOE4 noncarriers  
(n=25) . The functional connectivity changes in HFC will be determined in a randomized, double -blind, placebo -
controlled crossover manner, in which a low dose of AGB101 levetiracetam extended release (220 mg, QD)  or 
placebo is administered to 50 healthy 55 -75-year-old subjects (comprising 25 APOE 4 carriers and 25 
noncarriers), with the order of treatments counterbalanced in a within -subject crossover design , as illustrated in

The relationship in APOE [ADDRESS_752546] identical to those described  in Ref s (77, 78 ). In brief, study 
participants will receive  placebo during one treatment period  and AGB101 levetiracetam extended release 
during  the other treatment period , with the order of treatment s counterbalanced  (randomized, double -blind).

forms, including demographic information (age, gender, race, ethnicity), medical and surgical history, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52122], medications and  supplements, and family history of Alzheimer’s di sease . We will also 
ask questions pertaining to diet, sedentary/active lifestyle, sleep  history, fluency in languages, marital status, 
socioeconomic status, education,  and work history, and also obtain information on smoking, alcohol use, 
caffeine use, and  drug use.  
 
5.4.4. Neuropsychological  Assessments  
AD is characterized by [CONTACT_573201]. Current AD diagnosis guidelines 
recognize EM deficit as a core clinical criterion for typi[INVESTIGATOR_573174] (67, 68)  and recommend objective 
decline in EM performance as the starting point of A D clinical onset (69). Practically, AVLT and LMT are the 
two most common EM assessments that are used in various multicenter studies, including the Alzheimer’s 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative  and the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle Study of Ageing. These 
tests also can detect accelerated EM decline in cognitively normal APOE 4 carriers (61). Therefore, this study  
will employ AVLT as objective measurements to evaluate the EM decline and the changes to LEV perturbation. 
For comprehe nsive cognitive measurements of  CN subjects , all enrolled  subjects will be administered the 
WAIS -IV Digit Span and Coding, RAVLT , [LOCATION_011] Naming Test, and Verbal Fluency: FAS & Animal Fluency.  
 
5.4.5. Neuroimaging Assessments   
We will conduct imaging on our research -dedicated GE 3T MRI scanner (Signa Premier) equipped with a [ADDRESS_752552] type  of measurement  is the T1 -weighted high -
resolution anatomical  images.  The second  type of measurements is  task-driven and resting -state fMRI 
scans . The 3T fMRI data will be acquired following the  adapted General -electric  multiecho image sequence , 
the acquired multiecho images can be effectively denoised with 3.75x3.75x3.75 mm spatial resolution (70). For 
fMRI scans, one is for  EM and the other is for finger tappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] . We will utilize a memory task, which is being 
employed currently for the Alzheimer’s Disease Connectome Project in healthy older adults, including 
participants with memory disorders. The task involves serial presentation of novel (NV) and previously learn ed 
(PL) pi[INVESTIGATOR_573175] a published normative set. During the fMRI scan, NV or PL items are presented 
sequentially for the duration of the scan, and the task is to decide whether the present item is new or 
previously learned. The task elicits activa tion in the bilateral ventral and medial temporal lobes, bilateral 
hippocampal, and fusiform regions. For the Finger tappi[INVESTIGATOR_573176], w e will utilize a task developed at MCW. The 
task follows a block design where participants alternate between finger tappi[INVESTIGATOR_573177], in response to on -
screen instructions. This task robustly activates the motor network. For the resting -state fMRI scans, t wo [ADDRESS_752553]  type is the arterial 
13    Protocol v 5 01Apr2019  spin-labeling (ASL) cerebral blood flow (CBF) perfusion  images . The data acquisition scans, plus patient 
handling time in and out of scanner , will result in an approximately 1-hour scanning session.  
 
Prior to fMRI scans, subjects will undergo MRI safety screening and mock scanner training, as detailed in 
sections 7.3. and 7.4., respectively.  
 
5.4.6. Blood Draws  
All subjects  will undergo a blood draw  at the last day of each treatment period and on the last day of the 
washout period . Samples will be labeled with the study name, study visit number, contents of each collection 
vial, and the date of collection. Tubes may also be labeled with a b arcode for sample management.  
 
5.4.7. Randomization, Study Drug Dispensation, Administration, and Compliance  
The Investigational Drug  Service at Froedtert Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_573178] . 
 
In Period 1, a ll study participants will receive treatment with either AGB101 (220 mg, orally, QD) or placebo ; in 
Period 2, all subjects will crossover and receive the other treatment.  This is a double -blind study, so both the 
participants and study team will be blind t o the treatment received.  
 
All study treatments (drug and placebo) are dispensed in identical nondescript tablets  by [CONTACT_573202][INVESTIGATOR_307] . Tablets are provided for daily morning doses. Study drugs will be 
dispensed at base line and on the last day of the 4 -week  (-/+ 1 week)  washout period.  Subjects will be asked to 
self-administer treatment QD, once in the morning . 
 
Treatment compliance will be monitored by [CONTACT_157592]-report at the end of each treatment phase, bottle 
return and pi[INVESTIGATOR_692],  and analysis of  AGB [ADDRESS_752554] ed, and physical access to the computer system s will 
be limited .  
 
6.2. Determination of Changes in Network Activity  and Concurrent Improvement in EM. The cognitive 
and MRI/ rfMRI datasets will be obtained  at baseline (before placebo/ AGB101  administration) and on the last 
day of each 2 -week treatment period . These two time points will be denoted t = 1, 2. The two 25-subject 
groups , both of which will receive both placebo and AGB101 at different treatment phase , will be denoted  g = 
1, 2. The set of EM scores for subject s, from group  g, at time t will be denoted Cog(s,g,t), where s = 1,  …, 25; 
g = 1,  2; and t = 1, 2. The HFC calculated between the hippocampus and the bilateral sensorimotor cotex for 
subject s, from group  g, at time t will be denoted HFC(s,g,t).  
 
6.3. Functional -Connectivity Changes Due to Perturbation . We employed age, years of education, gender, 
and gray matter ( GM) volume  as time -invariant covariates to obtain residual variables to determine the HFC 
changes due to perturbation . We will model the HFC as a function of these nuisance regressors , using the 
following multiple linear regression equation, and re tain the residuals as 𝑯𝑭𝑪𝑹𝒆𝒔+(𝒔,𝒈,𝒕) for further analysis : 
 
 
where  𝑯𝑭𝑪+ ̃ (𝒔,𝒈,𝒕)≡ 𝑹𝒆𝒔 (𝒔,𝒈,𝒕). This regression will be performed using all of the data (i.e., all subjects, all 
groups, and all times ). The GM measurement will be conducted with GM concentration and hippocamp al 
volume measurement, as described in our publication and others (71-74). We will test the residuals  
𝑯𝑭𝑪+̃ (𝒔,𝒈,𝒕) using  three -factor crossed -nested analysis of variance ( ANOVA ), with fixed factors of group and 𝑯𝑭𝑪 (𝒔,𝒈,𝒕)=𝜷𝟎+𝜷𝟏𝑨𝒈𝒆 (𝒔)+ 𝜷𝟐𝑬𝒅𝒖 (𝒔)+𝜷𝟑𝑮𝑴(𝒔)+𝜷𝟒𝑪𝑺𝑭 (𝒔)+ 𝜷𝟓𝑮𝒆𝒏𝒅𝒆𝒓 (𝒔)+𝑹𝒆𝒔 (𝒔,𝒈,𝒕) , 
[ADDRESS_752555]  nested within group (i.e., all subjects will be tested at all times, but the 
placebo and AGB101 groups will contain different treatment phases ). We will test for both group and time main 
effects, as well as for the group × time interaction. If we find significant main effects or interaction s, we will 
perform  post hoc procedures to determine which time and group (i.e., placebo vs . AGB101 ) combinations are 
significantly different. In addition to the HFC analysis , we will conduc t a DMN  analysis 75).  
 
6.4. EM Change s Due to AGB101 Perturbation . The two EM scores (AVLT and LMT) will be normalized to Z-
score by [CONTACT_573203]. Then, Z-scores of each test will be averaged to obtain individual composite  memory  Z-score, as 
we have previously published (76). Similar to the above model for HFC change s due  to AGB101 perturbation , 
we will model the Cog score, using the time -invariant covariates as nuisance regressors:  
 
 
Define  𝜟𝑬𝑴̃ (𝒔,𝒈,𝒕)≡ 𝑹𝒆𝒔 (𝒔,𝒈,𝒕). We will test the residuals  𝜟𝑬𝑴̃ (𝒔,𝒈,𝒕) using a three -factor crossed -nested 
ANOVA , with fixed factors group and time, and random factor subject  nested within group. We will test for 
group and time main effects, as well as the group × time interaction. If we find significant main effects or 
interaction s, we will perform post hoc procedures to determine which time and group combinations are 
significantly different.   
 
6.5. Prediction of Changes in Correlation Between HFC and EM Before and After AGB101 Perturbation . 
A multiple linear regression is used to model EM as a linear function of HFC and test the difference in slope 
and intercept between the AGB101 and placebo groups. If the subject  is in the AGB101 group, I(s,g) = 1 ; if the 
subject is in the placebo group,  I(s,g) = 0.   
𝑬𝑴(𝒔,𝒈)=𝜷𝟎,𝟎+𝜷𝟎,𝟏𝑰(𝒔,𝒈)+ 𝜷𝟏,𝟎𝑯𝑭𝑪 (𝒔)+𝜷𝟏,𝟏𝑯𝑭𝑪 (𝒔)𝑰(𝒔,𝒈) +𝑹𝒆𝒔 (𝒔) 
Here, HFC(s) represents baseline HFC for subject s (for simplicity, nuisance regressors are not shown).  
 
6.6. Expected Results, Deliverable , and Problems  
Through this study , we expect to realize two goals: Scientifically,  we will demonstrat e that a berrant HFC 
represents a primary upstream mechanism that may contribute to cognitive  deficits in CN APOE [ADDRESS_752556] ( IRB)/human subject committees to provide reassuran ces, as appropriate . There will 
be three DSMB members with th e following areas of expertise:  
 
• Neural mechanism underlining learning and memory in aging and neurological disease  
• Aging and memory loss  
• Psychology and neuroimaging  
 𝜟𝑬𝑴 (𝒔,𝒈,𝒕)=𝜷𝟎+𝜷𝟏𝑨𝒈𝒆 (𝒔)+ 𝜷𝟐𝑬𝒅𝒖 (𝒔)+𝜷𝟑𝑮𝑴(𝒔)+𝜷𝟒𝑪𝑺𝑭 (𝒔)+ 𝜷𝟓𝑮𝒆𝒏𝒅𝒆𝒓 (𝒔) +𝑹𝒆𝒔 (𝒔,𝒈,𝒕) 
 ,  
 
[ADDRESS_752557] LEV.  LEV is associated with rapid and complete absorption, 
high oral bioavailability, minimal metabolism, and primarily renal elimination.  The LEV  plasma half -life in adults 
is 7 ± 1 hour and is unaffected by [CONTACT_573204] . LEV is eliminated from the 
systemic  circulation  by [CONTACT_573205] , which represents 66% of administered dose. 
The total body clearance is 0.96 mL/min/kg and the renal clearance is 0.6 mL/min/kg. The mechanism of 
excretion is glomeru lar filtration with subsequent partial tubular reabsorption. The metabolite ucb L057 is 
excreted by [CONTACT_573206] a renal clearance of 4 mL/min/kg. LEV 
elimination is correlated to creatinine clearance. LEV clearance is reduced in patients with impaired renal 
function . It lacks cytochrome P450 isoenzyme -inducing potential and is not associated with clinically significant 
pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs, including other antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_006] (55). Among AEs reported 
over placebo at standard ther apeutic doses  of 1000 –2000 mg daily are  pharyngitis (9%), mood swings (4%), 
dizziness (5%), infection (5%), asthenia (6%), and somnolence (7%). Serious dermatological reactions, 
including  Stevens -Johnson syndrome  and toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194], have been reported in at  14–17 days 
from initiation of treatment.  
 
7.1.1 Adverse Event Reporting  
 
Throughout the course of the study, all AEs will be m onitored and recorded on an AE CRF, including the AE’s 
description, start and end date, outcome, seriousness, severity, action taken, and relationship to the study 
drug. If AEs occur, the first concern is the safety of the study subjects. All AEs will be followed until resolved or 
stabl e and  the outcome documented on the CRF.  
 
7.1.2 Definitions and Criteria  
 
7.1.3 Adverse Events  
 
Per International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E2A: An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a 
subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily 
have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally  associated with 
the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
 
Events meeting the definition of an AE include : 
 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in frequency 
and/or intensity of the condition  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product administration even though it may 
have been present prior to the start of the study  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug  interaction  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either investigational product or a 
concomitant medication  
 
Clinically significant abnormal findings (laboratory test results, vital signs, physical examination findings, ECG s, 
radiologic exams, or other studies) should be recorded as AEs. A “clinically significant” finding is one that 
affects clinical management, including additional visits, monitoring or referrals, diagnostic tests or alteration of 
treatment, or that is cons idered clinically significant by [CONTACT_093]. A clinically significant finding may be a 
change in a test that has previously been abnormal but now requires additional action.  
 
When a medical or surgical procedure is performed, the condition that leads  to the procedure should be 
recorded as the AE.  
 
16    Protocol v 5 01Apr2019  Events that do not meet the definition of an AE include:  
 
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations or expected progression of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detected at the start of the study unless judged by [CONTACT_573207]’s underlying condition  
• Abnormal laboratory, ECG, or vital sign measurements that are not labelled clinically significant (see 
definition above)  
• Situations where an untoward me dical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission 
to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])  
• Pregnancy  
• Overdose in the absence of other AEs will not be reported as an AE in its own right  
• Changes in C -SSRS during the course of the study indicating worsening should be  evaluated by [CONTACT_118093], and if clinically significant (eg, alteration in medical care or 
intervention is required), an associated AE should be recorded, if present. The AE should be the 
primary underlying clinical manifest ation assessed as clinically significant, and not the change in score 
itself.  
• Change in cognitive functioning (improvement or worsening) is also not considered to be an AE . 
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_752558] medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], with the exception of:  
o Visits to the emergency room or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_573179]  
o Elective surgery for a pre -existing condition that has not worsened  
o Routine health assessments requiring admission not associated with any deterioration in 
condition  
o Social admission (lack of housing, family circumstances, etc.)  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Is an important medical event (eg, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not resu lt in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse, or malignancy tumors [histologically different from the primary tumor])  
 
Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the subject was at ri sk 
of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe.  
 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in 
other si tuations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the definition above. T hese should also usually be considered serious.  
 
Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. An SAE is not 
necessarily severe, eg, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a diagnostic procedure must be reported as an SAE even though 
the occurrence is not medically serious. By [CONTACT_344231], a severe AE is not necessarily serious: nausea of 
several hours’ duration may be rated as severe but may not be considered serious.  
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_752559] ed adverse drug reaction (ADR) is a reaction for which the nature or severity is not consistent with 
the applicable product information (see current Investigator’s Brochure). Until product information is amended, 
expedited reporting is required for additio nal occurrences of the reaction. Reports that add significant 
information on specificity or severity of a known, already documented SAE constitute unexpected events. For 
example, an event more specific or more severe than described in the Investigator's Br ochure would be 
considered "unexpected.” Specific examples would be (a) acute renal failure as a labeled ADR with a 
subsequent new report of interstitial nephritis and (b) hepatitis with a first report of fulminant hepatitis.  
 
Assessing Intensity and Relat ionship  
 
All AEs will be assessed on 2 descriptive parameters: intensity and relationship to the study drug:  
1. Intensity refers to the severity of an event and references the impact on a subject’s functioning.  
2. Relationship refers to the likelihood that the e vent being assessed was caused by [CONTACT_5257].  
 
Intensity  
Each AE will be classified according to the following criteria:  
Mild:  The AE does not interfere in a significant manner with the subject’s normal level 
of functioning.  
Moderate:  The AE produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to the 
subject’s health.  
Severe:  The AE produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and is a 
definite hazard to the subject’s health.  
 
When changes in the intensity of an AE occur m ore frequently than once a day, the maximum intensity for the 
experience should be noted. If the intensity category changes over a number of days, those changes should be 
recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).  
 
Relationship  
 
Each AE will be asses sed as to its relationship to the study drug based on the following criteria. Although the 
attribution by [CONTACT_88456], for analytic purposes a temporal association 
with the use of the study drug will be assumed su fficient for at least plausible association.  
 
Not related:  No causal relationship exists between the study drug and 
the AE, but an obvious alternative cause exists, eg, the 
subject’s underlying medical condition or concomitant 
therapy.  
Related:  There is a  reasonable/plausible possibility that the AE may 
have been caused by [CONTACT_5257].  
When assessing the relationship to the study drug, the following criteria will be considered:  
• Temporal relationship  
• Positive rechallenge  
• Positive dechallenge (resolution  upon stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35648], in absence of other intervention or 
treatment)  
• Known class effect  
• Biological plausibility  
• Lack of alternative explanation —concomitant drug or disease  
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_752560] how he/she has been since the last visit. Any AEs occurring 
before the start of treatment (ie, before the first dose of the study drug) will be recorded in the medical history 
only. If the investigator detects an AE in a study subject within 1 month  (4 weeks, -/+ 1 week)  of the last 
scheduled follow -up visit this will also be collected. All AEs will  be followed until resolved or stable and the 
outcome documented on the CRF.  
 
Also, the sign, symptom, or disease present before starting the treatment period are only considered AEs if 
they worsen after starting the treatment period.  
 
The investigator sh ould report all information about AEs on the AE/SAE section of the Case Report Form 
(CRF) . Whenever possible, an AE will be reported using a diagnostic term (eg, “common cold” or “upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]” rather than “runny nose, cough, mild fever”) an d should b e described with the attributes.  
 
Serious Adverse Events  
 
Each AE will be assessed to determine whether it meets seriousness criteria (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). If the AE is 
considered serious, the investigator should report this event to Agene Biotech  as outlined below and to the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) & Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  according to their standard operating 
procedures.  
 
All information about SAEs will be collected and reported by [CONTACT_573208]. The 
investigator should send the initial report to the Site PI [INVESTIGATOR_573180] [ADDRESS_752561] contain the following:  
• Subject number  
• Brief description of the SAE (diagnosis or signs/symptoms)  
• Serious criteria  
• Causality assessment  
• Assessment of the intensity o f the event  
 
Agene Biotech  will receive notification of the initial SAE via an e-mail from MCW Study Team . Site personnel 
will complete the paper SAE report form, scan and e -mail it within 24 hours to the following address: 
[EMAIL_10929]  
  
SAEs that are ongoing should be followed until resolved or stabilized to a level acceptable to the investigator.  
Information not available at the time of the initial report ( eg, an end date for  the AE, laboratory values received 
after the report, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458]) must be documented on a follow -up form. All follow -up 
information must be reported in the same timelines as initial information.  
 
Any SAEs considered related to the study  drug and discovered by [CONTACT_573209] 24 hours following knowledge of the event.  
 
Sponsor Reporting of Suspected Unexpected Adverse Reactions to Regulatory Authorities  (S[LOCATION_003]R)   
Per 21 CFR 312.32[c](1)(i)) the Sponsor  (MCW)  must report in an IND Safety Report  any suspected adverse 
reaction to study treatment that is both serious and unexpected. Before submitting an IND safety report, the 
Sponsor needs to ensure that the event meets all three of the definitions:  
• Suspected adverse reaction  
• Serious  
• Unexpected  
 
19    Protocol v 5 01Apr2019  The Sponsor/MCW Study Team will submit a  FDA Form 3500A MedWatch  for expedited reporting of all 
events that qualify for expedited reporting. Refer to the Form FDA 3500A Supplemental Manual for instructions 
and timelines on mandatory reporting.  
 
Unblinding Tr eatment Allocation  
Generally, only S[LOCATION_003]Rs for which the treatment allocation of the subject is unblinded should be reported by 
[CONTACT_573210].  
 
When an event may be a S[LOCATION_003]R, the blind should be broken only for that spe cific subject, and only if 
knowledge of the study drug assignment is material to th e medical management of the AE. When unblinded to 
assist in the medical management, the blind for that subject should be maintained for individuals responsible 
for the ongoi ng conduct of the study (eg, management, monitors, and investigators) and those responsible for 
data analysis and interpretation of results at the conclusion of the study (eg, biometrics personnel).  
 
Unblinded information should only be accessible to thos e who need to be involved in the safety reporting to 
pertinent regulatory authorities, independent ethics committees/independent review boards (IRBs) and 
DSMBs, or individuals performing ongoing safety evaluations during the study.  
 
Reporting to Institutional Review Board and Data Safety Monitoring Board  
The IRB/DSMB  will be notified of any S[LOCATION_003]Rs according to local regulations and within the designated 
timeframe. Refer to MCW IRB Reporting Policy.  These will be reported to the DSMB i n parallel.  
 
7.2. MRI Safety  
The MRI scanner device is a  U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA)-cleared device for safe and 
noninvasive imaging of the interior of the human body. The GE MR750 MRI uses a [ADDRESS_752562] to gradient switching (dB/dt) and RF power (specific absorption rate [SAR]). The proposed MRI scans 
are NOT for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease or other wise 
preventing impairment of human health , and they do not present a potential for serious risk to the health, 
safety, or welfare of a subject. The scanner also restricts the software from exceeding FDA safety levels. The 
scanner monitors the SAR for rese arch scans just as it does for all other scans. Thus, the scanner with the 
software fully engaged operates, from a technical design and functional standpoint, as a nonsignificant risk  
device in accordance with 21 CFR 812. By [CONTACT_573211], the operating conditions of the MRI 
device are generally deemed, in and of themselves, to make the MRI device a nonsignificant risk device.  
 
The Nova Medical 32 -channel head coil (model number NMSC075 -32-3GE-MR750) is an investigational 
device that is not approved by [CONTACT_573212]. This coil device includes multiple features for safe 
operation involving human studies. The 32 -channel coil  is designed and constructed as a receive -only detector 
of RF signals that are emitted by [CONTACT_573213], which is FDA approved. During the RF excitation by [CONTACT_218862], the coil device is d ecoupled (made 
inactive) through redundant circuitry; thus, the coil device never transmits RF to the subject and, therefore, it 
has no impact on subject risk or safety.  
 
More specifically, the coil design and construction include the following safety fea tures: 1) High-voltage 
breakdown (>2  kV) UL -94V0 flame retardant housing. 2) Rugged  construction to ensure safe operation in case 
of rough handling. 3) Active detuning  circuitry providing greater than 35 db isolation per element. 4) High power 
passive  detuning circuits in case primary detuning circuitry fails. 5) Multiple common mode  traps in all receive 
coil cables. 6) Minimum of [ADDRESS_752563].  
 
Additionally, the coil was designed and manufactured under an ISO 134 85 certified  quality management 
system. As part of this quality system, Nova Medical has conducted  a failure means and effects analysis 
20    Protocol v 5 01Apr2019  (FEMA) of this produc t, and we feel that it is a  nonsignificant risk under foreseeable normal conditions when 
used on the 3T GE X750 MRI scanners at MCW . 
 
The Medical College of Wisconsin  has installed a new GE 3T MRI scanner (Signa Premier)  equipped with a 
48-channel receive -only head coil, which is FDA -approved.  We will use the new GE 3T Signa Premier MRI 
scanner and 48 -channel head coil for study subjects. The GE750 MRI scanner with the 32 -channel head coil 
will be used as a back -up for scheduling purposes.  
 
7.3. MRI Safety Screening  
MCW -specific magnetic resonance ( MR) safety screening procedures will be followed. All participants will be 
screened for medical devices, implants, and metal prior to undergoing MRI, first at the screening visit (Visit -1) 
and again prior to entering the scanner room  on Visits 1, 2 and 4 . If it is necessary to review medical records to 
confirm contraindication, a review of medical records (e.g., previous surgeries) will take place prior to the 
scheduled visit. During the screening process, participants will also be ques tioned about their ability to 
temporarily remove transdermal patches (such as birth control or nicotine patches). Women of child -bearing 
potential will be asked to confirm that they are not pregnant when signing the ICF. If a woman has concerns or 
is uncer tain of her pregnancy status, she will be excluded, as the risks of an MRI scan to pregnant women are 
currently unknown. The risks related to an MRI are minimal for a properly administered visit. The MR 
technicians are trained and prepared to deal with any  problems that may arise.  
 
7.4. Mock Scanner Training   
As part of the study , participants will engage in a mock scanner training session. The purpose of this session is 
to acclimate participants to the scanner and to assess their comfort level, minimize any anxiety, and provide 
practice and training  on all tasks that will be conducted in the real MRI environment . Training in the mock 
scanner will take approximately [ADDRESS_752564]’s first  imaging session. After the 
session, an y questions or concerns will be discussed. Participants may be excused from the mock scanner 
training  at subsequent study visits .  
 
7.5. Incidental Findings  by [CONTACT_573214]. Sometime s, however, a few incidental 
abnormalities may be found  in these study subjects, s uch as brain tumors, vascular lesions, moderate to 
severe white matter lesion load, and other neuroradiological abnormalities that would preclude subjects from 
being included in the analysis, or that are  clinical abno rmalities requiring follow -up. T hese subjects will be 
advised to see their physicians for formal assessment. [CONTACT_9688][INVESTIGATOR_573181] a board -certified neurologist  at 
MCW . He or a Co -I (MD) will consult with the subjects in such cases.  
 
7.6. Subject Safety  
Due to the duration and the low doses of AGB101 administered in this study , we anticipate this study to be at 
minimal risk to the volunteer. We do not expect frequen t or sever e AEs to be present. Subjects will be 
instructed to call the study site for intercurrent illnesses. All AEs will be monitored according to the Safety Plan 
(see Section 7.1). The DSMB board will review the initiation frequency and severity of any AEs. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] r ules 
will be invoked for the subject and study if AE are reported above the 5% threshold. Subject safety will be 
ensured during the study period , and  the study may be closed with regular visits to the resolution of the AE. 
Safeguards to ensure  subject confidentiality will consist of maintaining records in a locked cabinet in a locked 
room in the Department of Neurology research offices. All computers are password protected  to further ensure

7.8. Data   
AE data analysis will be performed every [ADDRESS_752565]  of measurement of brain connectivity at the interim point when recruitment 
has reached 50% of subject with a second fMRI  session . Secondary outcome measure of cognitive 
21    Protocol v 5 01Apr2019  assessment  will also be reviewed. It is anticipated , however , that with the short , 2-week treatment  period, 
statistical significance may not be reached . 
 
7.10. Feedback Mechanism   
Evaluation and response to subjects’  complaints will be routinely addressed by [CONTACT_9288] B. The IRB and 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_573182]. In addition,  a report by [CONTACT_573215].

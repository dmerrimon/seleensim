 [ADDRESS_458408] literature documents the  efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia 
(CBT -I) compared to control conditions .[ADDRESS_458409] during the 
perinatal period. A recent meta -analysis supports the efficacy of digital  CBT -I for sleep 
compared to control .12 Sleepio is a digital  CBT -I program associated with significantly greater 
improvements in sleep efficiency (among other sleep parameters) and depression symptom 
severity compared to both active control and trea tment as usual conditions immediately post -
intervention and at an [ADDRESS_458410] is to use a 
randomized control design to examine the efficacy of digital  CBT -I (Sleepio) for sleep and 
mental health outcomes compared to treatment as usual among pregnant women with insomnia 
symptoms.  
 
Objectives  
Aim 1 :  To test the hypothesis that  participants randomized to digital CBT -I will 
demonstrate  significantly greater improvements in s ubjective s leep outcomes , including 
insomnia symptom severity  (primary outcome) , sleep duration, sleep efficiency, global sleep 
quality , and insomnia caseness, compared to TAU participants.  
Aim 2 : To test the hypothesis that participants randomized to digital CBT -I will 
experience significantly greater improvements in mental health outcomes , including depressive 
symptoms (primary) and anxiety symptoms , compared to TAU participants.  
Aim 3 : To explore the impact of digital CBT -I on birth outcomes . In response to research  
indicating that insomnia and poor sleep quality are associated with increased risk for preterm 
birth, we will compare rates of preterm birth, as well as other birth outcomes such as low 
birthweight, delivery method, and APGAR scores, between digital CBT -I and TAU particip ants. 
Because the sample size of the proposed study will be too small to draw conclusions, this aim is 
exploratory.  
 
Trial Design  
 3 The study is a parallel group, superiority, randomized control led trial of  digital CBT -I 
versus  TAU among pregnant women , with a 1:1 allocation ratio .  
 
Method s 
Participants, interventions, and outcomes  
Study setting . All study activities will occur remotely via phone, website, and digital 
app. 
Eligibility criteria.  Inclusion criteria are: 1) self -reported pregnancy up to 28 weeks 
gestation, 2) 18 years of age or older, 3) meets  DSM -5 criteria for insomnia disorder as 
determined by [CONTACT_366739] (women experiencing symptoms ≥ [ADDRESS_458411] to DSM -5 criter ia requiring symptom duration ≥3 months) or experiencing 
elevated insomnia symptom severity as determined by a total score ≥ 11 on the Insomnia 
Severity Index, and 4) has regular access to a web -enabled computer, tablet, or smart phone. 
Exclusion criteria are: 1) probable major depression as determined by a total score ≥ 15 on the 
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale  (EPDS) , 2) self -reported bipolar disorder, 3) self -reported 
history of psychosis, 4) active suicidality defined as scoring > 1 on EPDS item 10, or report of a 
specific suic ide plan or recent attempt, and 5) shift work employee.  
Interventions.  Digital CBT -I. The digital CBT -I program, Sleepio  (www.sleepio.com ), is 
deliver ed in 6 weekly web -sessions via website or iOS app. Treatment content is based on CBT -I 
manuals and includes a behavioral component (sleep restriction, stimulus control, and 
relaxation), a cognitive component (paradoxical intention, cognitive restructuring, mindfulness, 
positive imagery, putting the day to rest) and an educational component (psycho -education, sleep 
hygiene). The program is interactive, and content is presented  by [CONTACT_366740][INVESTIGATOR_541] . 
Participants schedule their session times and  are prompted via email/SMS if they do not 
complete the session as scheduled . Participants complete daily sleep diar ies throughout the 
intervention, which is used by [CONTACT_366741] m to provide personalized  help. Participants receive an 
email/SMS reminder each morning to prompt them to fill in their sleep diary. Additionally, study 
staff will monitor participant use of the website, and will contact [CONTACT_366742] d on to the program or who have fallen behind in weekly sessions in order to discuss any 
challenges and troubleshoot barriers . Participants complete a short questionnaire at the beginning 
of the intervention to set treatment goals. Throughout the course of  therapy, participants have 
access to a n online community board and an online library of information about sleep. 
Participants will receive access  to Sleepio  at no cost as part of their participation.   
 Treatment as usual (TAU).  The control condition is intended to reflect standard care for 
pregnant women with insomnia symptoms . No limits are placed on receiving non -study 
treatment, including medication or psychotherapy. Participants randomized to TAU will receive  
a free voucher code to Sleepio upon stud y completion.  
Outcomes.  The primary outcome is change in insomnia symptom severity  (Insomnia 
Severity  Index)  from baseline to [ADDRESS_458412] -randomization. Secondary sleep outcomes 
include sleep efficiency (sleep diary), sleep duration (sleep diary), global sleep quality 
(Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272]), and insomnia caseness (Sleep Condition Indicator) . Secondar y 
mental health outcomes include depressive symptom severity (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression 
Scale) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale) . We will additionally examine change 
to [ADDRESS_458413] -randomization, 36 weeks gestation, 3 months postpartu m, and 6 months 
postpartum. Other, exploratory outcomes include birth outcomes, such as gestational age at 
delivery, APGAR scores, birthweight, and delivery method . 
 4 Participant timeline  (See Figure) . Eligibility survey . Individuals interested in 
participating will complete  an electronic consent form describing the screening procedures. Next, 
participants will complete  questionnaires to assess eligibility. Participants  will complete a 
demographic measure, provide contact  [CONTACT_3031], and indicate whether they agreed to be 
contact[CONTACT_366743]. Individuals who pass the eligibility survey will complete  the 
study consent form and be given instructions to complete the sleep diaries.   
Sleep diaries . Participant s will receive  email requests to complete sleep diaries on 
REDCap for seven consecutive days. Participants will indicate when they got in bed, how long it 
took to fall asleep, number of awakenings, duration of awakenings, final awakening time, and 
when the y got out of bed.  Participants who complete  at least four diaries will be  eligible to 
proceed to the orientation session.  
Orientation . The primary goal of the phone orientation  session , modeled after Goldberg 
and Kiernan (2005),[ADDRESS_458414] of attrition bias. Partici pants will 
describe  personal pros and cons for participating in the trial, and will be  given as much time as 
needed to decide whether to participate.  
Baseline measures . Participants will complete  baseline measures on the Qualtrics online 
survey system .  
Randomization . Upon the participant’s completion of the baseline measures, study staff 
will request  the condition assignment from the independent investigator who generated the 
randomization sequence. Study staff will inform participants of  their condition assignment by 
[CONTACT_366744].  
Follow -up assessments . Participants will complete  all study measures and the daily sleep 
diaries at [ADDRESS_458415] size (Cohen’s d=0.95) for baseline  to post -intervention differences and a medium effect 
size (Cohen’s d=0.69) for baseline  to 8-week follow -up on sleep efficiency.[ADDRESS_458416] size (Cohen’s d=0.20 -0.69) for baseline  to post-intervention  differences and a 
medium effect size (Cohen’s d=0.48 -0.78) for baseline  to 8-week follow -up.9,14 Using G*Power  
for an ANOVA repeated measures with a within -between interaction , we estimated that [ADDRESS_458417] 80% power to detect a small -to-medium effect size (Co hen’s d 
=.30) with =.01 for a within -between interaction. Attrition in web -based CBT -I programs 
ranges from 4 -22%.13,16,17 but a meta -analysis of computer -based treatments for depression 
estimated drop -out rates of 38.4% in programs that offer administrative support.18 We used the 
higher attrition estimate of 38%, yielding a required sample size of 208 participants (n=104 per 
group).  
Recruitment.  We will utilize several recruitment methods to meet our target sample size. 
Although recruitment will focus mainly on the Bay Area, participants can enroll from anywhere 
because all study activities are completed remotely.  
UCSF Outpatient Recruitment Prog ram. Study recruiters will review medical records of 
women receiving prenatal care at UCSF . Women who may be eligible based off chart review 
(e.g., less than 28 weeks pregnant) will be approached in the clinic waiting area at the time of 
their appointment to be introduced to the study . Recruiters will give the patient an opt -in card 
 5 and a brief overview of the study . Patients who are interested in participating will be given 
information to complete the web -based prescreening online and/or will provide their  contact 
[CONTACT_366745] -in card to be contact[CONTACT_366746].  
Social media  recruitment . We will identify blogs, websites, and social media accounts  
that serve the population we are targeting for recruitment (e.g., pregnant women) to host IRB -
approved blog posts. Women interested in learning more will be directed to contact [CONTACT_366747] . Addition ally, we will post IRB -
approved text, blogs, and graphics on REST Study social media accounts (e.g., Twitter, 
Facebook, Instagram, etc .). We will also post IRB -approved links to educational articles about 
pregnancy, maternal mental health, and well -being w ith accompanying questions , which are 
designed to draw in and engage the population we are targeting for recruitment . In responding to 
any comments/questions, we will adhere to the same ethical principles as when responding to 
questions in standard, in -person recruitment efforts, and will encourage interested individuals to 
contact [CONTACT_366748]. As described by [CONTACT_366749] (2017) we will uphold respect for  the privacy and other interests of social media users  
and maintain investigator transparency.19 We may also “like,” “share,” and “retweet” public 
posts by [CONTACT_366750]; when doing so, the 
posts will indicate that they are liked, shared, or retweeted from other users, and that the posts 
did not originate from REST Study Staff.  
Participants will be recruited using paid and free advertisements including but not limited 
to: Craigslist, Facebook, websites of interest to pregnant women, listservs, Reddit, and 
Instagram. Advertisements will include IRB -approved recruitment text with a brief description of 
the study, study contact [CONTACT_3031], and a link to the web -based eligibility survey . Users may, 
with or without our awareness, share our study information .  
Conventional, passive recruitmen t. Particip ants will be recruited via flyers, brochures, 
and postcards posted in community, medical, and retail settings serving a high volume of people 
(e.g., coffee shops, grocery stores, etc .), women who are pregnant (e.g., WIC, Black Infant 
Health, maternity clot hing stores, etc .), and families (e.g., toy stores) .  
Referrals from colleagues . We will also contact [CONTACT_366751].  
ResearchMatch . We will recruit participants through ResearchMatch, a national health 
volunteer registry that  was created by [CONTACT_329010] U.S. 
National Institutes of Health as part of the Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) 
program. ResearchMatch has a large population of volunteers who have consented to be 
contact[CONTACT_220064].  We will use IRB -
approved text in these ads .  
Clinical & Translational Scien ce Institute (CTSI)  Consultation Service, Direct Mail . We 
are collaborating with the CTSI Consultation Service to provide cohort identification and direct 
mail for recruitment . A Dear Patient letter will be sent to individuals identified from the APeX 
record systems via a data extraction by [CONTACT_366752] (ARS) of patients who 
are pregnant . These patients are not known to or under the care of the researcher team . The CTSI 
Consultation Service will coordinate the mailing on behalf of the study. Interested subjects will 
contact [CONTACT_366753] . The data extrac t will be delivered to the CTSI 
Consultation Service’s MyResearch account in order to facilitate the direct mail activities while 
ensuring privacy and confidentiality of the patients identified .  
 [ADDRESS_458418] mail and/or direct email services to our target population, 
including but not limited to: Lorton Data and Bay Area Parent Magazine.  
Informational talks . Study staff may provide information about the  study at groups 
attended by [CONTACT_37111] (e.g., at Babies R Us). Information provided will be consistent to 
what  is described in recruitment flyers, consent forms, and orientation call.  
Electronic health record recruitment.  MyChart ( APeX ) will conduct  a search for patients 
based on the study’s inclusion and exclusion criteria. This is a completely computer -aided 
search, meaning the computer — not a person — searches patient charts. When a patient is 
identified as potentially eligible, they will receive an email from MyChart that asks them  to log 
in to MyChart to read about a study in which they might be interested. The email is short and is 
the same for every recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] —it contains  no patient -specific  or study -specific information . When 
the patient logs into MyChart, there will be a  “Research” tab with template information about 
research participation  and how to opt out of receiving recruitment messages. The patient can 
click through to learn about the specific study to which they have been matched. The patient has 
the option of clicking a button to let the study team know that they are interested in learning 
more about the study. The study team will only receive information about the patient if the 
patient takes this action . If the patient clicks “No  thanks” or simply does not respond, they will 
not be contact[CONTACT_366754] -up emails from MyChart about the 
study, nor will  their information  be shared with the study team.  
 
Assignment of interventions  
 Allocation.  The blocked  randomization sequence will be  generated by [CONTACT_366755].[ADDRESS_458419] access to future allocations.  
Blinding . For study administration purposes, staff will be  unblinded  to participant 
condition assignment  after allocation . Study staff will be blinded to outcomes during the trial.  
Participants will be  unblinded  to condition assignment  due to the nature of the comparison 
group, which is not an active comparator. The study statistician will remain  blinded to condition 
assignment for all primary analyses.  
 
Data collection, management, and analysis  
 Data collection methods . Participants will complete study measures using the Qualtrics 
amd REDcap survey system s, which allow participants to read questions on the screen and press 
the response buttons to answer. Response validation will be utilized so that participants can only 
enter values within range for each item. To reduce missing data, r esponses will be requ ested for 
each item.  
Subjective sleep outcomes.  The primary efficacy outcome is insomnia symptom severity, 
as measured by [CONTACT_366756] (ISI).21,[ADDRESS_458420] two weeks. A total score is computed by [CONTACT_366757]. Scores ≤ 7 indicate no 
 7 clinic ally significant insomnia, 8 -14 indicate subthreshold insomnia, 15 -21 indicate moderate 
severity insomnia, and ≥ 22 indicate severe insomnia.   
Secondary sleep outcomes are sleep efficiency, nightly sleep duration, global sleep 
quality, and insomnia diagnosis. Daily sleep diaries will be  used to measure sleep efficiency and 
sleep duration. Sleep efficiency is calculated by [CONTACT_366758][INVESTIGATOR_366732] 100. Scores range from 0 -100%, with 
85% and above considered normal. Sleep duration is the total amount of nightly sleep in hours. 
Global sleep quality will be  measured using the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI), a 19 -
item measure comprised of seven components assessing sleep duration, disturbance, latency, 
efficiency, quality, days of dysfunction due to sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], and needing medication to sleep .23  
Each component score ranges from 0 -3, and the components are summed to create a PSQI global 
sleep quality score ranging from 0 -21. Higher score s indicate worse global sleep quality, and 
scores above 5 indicate poor sleep. To measure possible cases of DSM -5 insomnia disorder, we 
will use  the Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI).  24 By [CONTACT_366759] g a ninth item to assess early -morning 
awakening, the Sleep Condition Indicator can be used to identify possible cases of DSM -5 
insomnia disorder.24  
Mental health outcomes . Depressive symptom severity will be  assessed using the 
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).25 The EPDS is a 10 -item self -report measure that 
omits depressive symptoms that can be conflated with normal pregnancy symptoms (e.g., 
appetite disturbance). It is frequently used to assess depressive symptom  severity during 
pregnancy . Total scores range from [ADDRESS_458421] major 
depression among pregnant women.26 Anxiety symptom severity will be  assessed using the 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD -7).[ADDRESS_458422] severe anxiety.  
 All study measures will e  self-report and collected via online survey systems. With the 
exception of the sleep diaries, which will be  collected via REDCap, study measures will be  
administer ed via Qualtrics.  
 Use of non -study treatments . At each follow -up assessment , participants will be  asked 
about their use of the following aids to improve sleep: sleep medication prescribed by a doctor; 
combination sleep aid and pain reliever; over -the-counter or store -bought sleep aid; alternative 
therapy or herbal supplement; therapy or counseling; al cohol, beer, or wine; eyemask or ear 
plugs; other. Participants were also asked about their use of the following aids to improve mood: 
antidepressant medication, therapy or counseling; support group; alternative therapy or herbal 
supplements; other. Respon se options are ‘rarely or never,’ ‘a few nights a month,’ ‘a few nights 
a week,’ and ‘every night/almost every night.’  
Obstetric outcomes . Obstetric outcomes will be assessed via medical record review, and 
include but are not limited to the following outc omes: gestational age at delivery, APGAR 
scores, birthweight, and delivery method. Participants will also self -report birth outcomes in case 
we are not able to obtain their medical record data .28,[ADDRESS_458423](s) that they have been granted access to by [CONTACT_366760]. Only ITS and ISU 
system administrators are authorized to access the back -end database server directly by [CONTACT_366761]. 
Stati stical methods . Independent samples t -tests and chi -square tests will be  used to 
examine between -group differences in baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics . 
Linear mixed effects models will be used to examine whether within -woman changes i n sleep 
and mental health outcomes differ between the digital CBT -I and treatment as usual groups.[ADDRESS_458424] the option of downloading a copy of the electroni c consent forms.  
 Participants recruited through UCSF outpatient OB/GYN clinics will additionally be asked 
to sign a HIPAA authorization form to enable us to request prenatal care and labor and delivery 
records . Participants will be mailed this form to read and sign and then mail back to us using a 
stamped and addressed envelope that we provide . Participants will be encouraged to contact 
[CONTACT_38451].  
 
Confidentiality  
Information provided on the Sleepio website is stored in encrypted fo rm on secure 
servers located in the US. All passwords are stored in encrypted form and all sensitive traffic is 
transmitted securely via SSL by [CONTACT_15094] . Data may  be transferred to, and stored at, other 
destinations or to staff who work for Big Health or on e of their suppliers. Such staff may be 
engaged in, among other things, the provision of support services. By [CONTACT_366762], 
participants agree to this transfer, storing or processing. Sleepio will use strict procedures to 
prevent unauthorized a ccess in accordance with their Company data protection policy and code 
of practice, and responsibilities as a registered Data Controller in the [LOCATION_006]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_126863], the transmission of information via the internet is never completely secure.  
Hardcop y data will be stored in a locked file cabinet  and/or in a locked office and in a 
locked suite , and will include the participant’s study identification number . All data will be 
entered into or collected in electronic form. Electronic data will be stored on  a private, password -
protected hard drive accessible only to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_366733] . Only de -identified 
data will be used in publications.  De-identified data will be shared between collaborators in order 
to facilitate collaboration with r espect to data management, cleaning, analysis, and manuscript 
preparation.  The subject’s name, contact [CONTACT_3031], and ID will be recorded indefinitely on an 
electronic linkage file stored on an encrypted hard drive or secure online server .

Protocol Amendments  
 
The following amendments were made  to the protocol  after participant recruitment began:  
 
1. March 10, 2017: First, in order to enroll women whose insomnia symptoms onset during 
pregnancy , we changed the inclusion criteria to state that women who indicate on the SCI 
that they have experience d insomnia symptom s ≥ [ADDRESS_458426] to 
DSM5 criteria that requires insomnia symptoms ≥ [ADDRESS_458427] the  phone number and email address of one social/family 
support member, and request permission to contact [CONTACT_366763]. Participants can decline to give this information and still participate. This is a 
common practice in clinical research trials, and especially important in digital 
interventions that are prone to high attrition.  
2. June 20, 2017 : We modified our eligibility criteria  such that p articipants must either 
meet criteria DSM -5 criteria for insomnia as determined by  [CONTACT_366764] ≥ 11 on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI).  
3. February 8, 2018 : To maximize completion of study outcome measures and avoid 
attrition bias, we modified study procedures to allow us to mail  a paper copy of outcome 
measures  with a stamped and addressed return envelope.  
4. March 27, 2018 : As we neared our enrollment target (randomizing 183 of 208 women ), 
we modified our eligibility  criteria to focus our remaining enrollment on Black women, 
who were  under -enrolled to date. Existing recruitment strategies identified Black women 
but at a slower rate compared to White women.

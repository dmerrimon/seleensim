 1. TRIAL SUMMARY  
 
Title  Pragmatic Trial Examining Oxygenation prior to Intubation (PREOXI)  
Background  Clinicians perform rapid sequence induction, laryngoscopy, and tracheal 
intubation for more than 5 million critically ill adults as a part of clinical 
care each year in the [LOCATION_002] .  One -in-ten emergency tracheal 
intubations is complicated by  [CONTACT_81428]-threatening hypoxemia.  Administering 
supplemental oxygen prior to  induction and  intubation  (“preoxygenation”)  
decreases the risk of  life-threatening hypoxemia . In current clinical 
practice, the most common methods for preoxygenation are non -invasive 
positive pressure ventilation and facemask oxygen.  Prior trials comparing 
non-invasive positive pressure ventilation and facemask oxygen for 
preoxygenation have been small and have yielded  conflicting results.   A 
better understanding of the comparative effectiveness of these two 
common, standard -of-care approaches to preoxygenation could improve 
the care clinicians deliver and patient outcomes.  
Study Design  Multicenter, pragmatic, non-blinded, parallel -group, randomized trial  
Treatment Groups  
 • Non-invasive  positive pressure  ventilation group: Patients will receive 
preoxygenation with non-invasive mechanical ventilation via a tight -
fitting mask.    
• Facemask oxygen group: Patients will receive preoxygenation via either 
a non -rebreather mask or a compressed bag -mask device  without manual 
ventilation .  
Sample Size  1,[ADDRESS_494072]  
2. Patient is known to be less than 18 years old  
3. Patient is known to be pregnant  
4. Patient is known to be a prisoner  
5. Immediate need for tracheal  intubation precludes safe performance of 
study procedures  
6. Patient is apneic, hypopneic, or has another condition requiring 
positive pressure ventilation between enrollment and induction  
7. Operator has determined  that preoxygenation with non-invasive 
positive pressure ventilation  or preoxygenation with facemask oxygen 
is required or contraindicated for optimal care of the patient  
Risks  Participation in this study involves minimal incremental risk because:  
• All patients eligible for the study are already undergoing tracheal 
intubation with preoxygenation as part of their clinical care  
 
  5 
 • Preoxygenation with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation  
and preoxygenation with facemask oxygen are the most common 
approaches to preoxygenation of critically ill adults  in clinical care  
• No benefits or risks are currently known to differ between the two 
approaches  
• If clinicians determine either approach to be required or 
contraindicated for the optimal care of an individual patient,  the 
patient is excluded from the study  
Benefits  The benefits of the PREOXI trial are largely the indirect benefits to future 
patients that will result by a better understanding of whether 
preoxygenation with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation or pre -
oxygenation with facemask oxygen  prevents complications during 
tracheal intubation of critically ill adults.  
Consent  The trial will be conducted with waiver of informed consent because:  
• Participation in the study involves minimal incremental risk  
• Obtaining informed consent prior to emergency tracheal intubation 
of critically ill adults is impracticable  
Randomization  
 Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to preoxygenation with non-
invasive positive pressure ventilation  or pre -oxygenation with facemask 
oxygen.  Randomization will be completed in permuted blocks of variable 
size and stratified by [CONTACT_3725].  
Blinding  Study group assignment will remain concealed to study personnel and 
clinicians  until after the decision has been made to enroll the patient in the 
study. Following enrollment, the trial will not blind patients or clinicians 
to study group assignment.

 2. TRIAL DESCRIPTION  
 
2.1 Background  
Clinicians frequently perform t racheal intubation  of critically ill patients in the emergency 
department (ED) or intensive care unit (ICU).  Complications of intubation , including hypoxemia 
and cardiovascular instability , occur in nearly half of intubations performed in these settings  (1, 
2, 4, 5).   Preventing complications during tracheal intubation is a key focus of clinical care and 
airway management research (4, 6, 7). 
  
2.1.1 Hypoxemia during Intubation of Critically Ill Patients  
Life-threatening hypoxemia  occurs in 1 -in-10 cases of emergency tracheal intubation. (8) Severe 
hypoxemia during intubation is associated with increased risk of cardiac arrest and death. (9, 10) 
Severe hypoxemia may be associated with worse  outcomes in survivors .  For example, 
neurologic recovery from traumatic brain injury may be worse  after hypoxemia due to secondary 
ischemic insult. (11)  
 
2.1.2 Role of Preoxygenation in Preventing Hypoxemia during Intubation  
In current clinical practice, e mergency tracheal intubation involves the nearly simultaneous 
administration of a sedative agent and a neuromuscular blocking agent to optimize the anatomic 
conditions for intubation.  Following medication administration, patients rapi[INVESTIGATOR_393746] -
placed endotracheal tube.  The oxygen contained in the lungs at the time of neuromuscular 
blockade ( i.e., the patient’s functional residual capacity) is the reservoir of oxygen available to 
the patient’s body to prevent hypoxemia and tissue hypoxia during the intubation procedure.  For 
a patient breathing ambient air (i.e., room air), only 21% of the gas in the functional residual 
capacity is oxygen; 78% is nitrogen.  Administering 100% oxygen to a patient prior to induction 
of anesthesia and tracheal intubation, referred to as “preoxygenation ,” can replace the nitrogen in 
the lung with oxygen, increasing up to five-fold the reservoir of oxygen available to the body 
during the procedure and prolonging the period during which intubation can be performed safely 
without encountering hypoxemia.  In current clinical practice, the two most common methods of 
providing preoxygenation are :  
1. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation  - a tight -fitting mask connected to either an 
invasive ventilator or non -invasive mechanical ventilator . 
2. Facemask oxygen  - with either a non -rebreather mask or a bag -mask device . 
2.1.3 Preoxygenation with Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation  
Preoxygenation with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation is common during emergency 
tracheal intubation of critically ill adults in current clinical practice.  During preoxygenation with 
non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, a tight -fitting mask is connected to a machine capable 
of providing positive pressure ventilation . Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation deliver s up 
to 95-100% oxygen  and can be provided by [CONTACT_5640] a conventional invasive mechanical ventilator 
or a dedicated non -invasive ventilation machine , commonly referred to as a Bilevel Positive 
Airway Pressure (BiPAP)  machine.  In addition to providing high concentrations of oxygen, non -
invasive positive pressure ventilation i ncreases mean airway pressure and delivers breaths at a 
set rate during the  period of  hyponea/apnea after induction. Because a mechanical ventilator is 
always  required following intubation  of a critically ill adult , no specialized equipment is required 
 
  8 
 to use non -invasive positive pressure ventilation for preoxygenation of critically ill adults 
undergoing tracheal intubation .  
2.1.4 Preoxygenation with Facemask Oxygen  
In current clinical practice, p reoxygenation with facemask oxygen is commonly performed using 
one of the following two types of facemask: [1] a non-rebreather mask or [2] a bag-mask  device 
(8, 12).  Both a types of facemask  (a non-rebreather and a compressed bag -mask device ) deliver 
supplemental oxygen without increasing airway pressures or providing assistance with 
ventilation.   
• A non-rebreather mask  is a type of facemask with a loose -fitting mask  that sits over a 
patient’s nose and mouth and is  connected to an oxygen reservoir. It delivers at least 15 
liters per minute of 100% oxygen , but it  may not reliably deliver flows of oxygen greater  
than 15 liters per minute and may allow  entrainment of ambient air. Studies show that the  
while the oxygen content for healthy and calm volunteers may approach 100%, the  
oxygen content received by [CONTACT_393782] 
50%.(14)  It does not  provide positive pressure.  
• A bag mask  device  is a type of facemask  with a mask  that forms a tight seal over the 
mouth and nose when held in place by [CONTACT_73693] , an exhalation port , and a self -
inflating bag that serves as a reservoir for oxygen and can be compressed to provide 
positive pressure ventilation .(13) If the bag of this device  is compressed, this device  
deliver s oxygen without providing positive pressure ventilation  and can deliver more than  
90% oxygen with an ideal mask seal . However, in the setting of emergency intubation 
leaks may result in the entrainment of ambient air and reduced oxygen delivery.      
2.1.5 Potential  Advantages of Preoxygenation with Non -Invasive Positive Pressure 
Ventilation or Preoxygenation with Facemask Oxygen  
 
Preoxygenation with non-invasive  positive pressure  ventilation  has been proposed to offer the 
following potential advantages  compared to preoxygenation with facemask oxygen : 
• Entrainment of ambient air : The tight-fitting  mask  used to deliver non-invasive 
ventilation  entrains less ambient air than a non-rebreather or bag -mask device . The higher 
flow rates of oxygen gas with non-invasive ventilation may also help prevent entrainment 
of ambient air and increase the fraction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1401].  (15) 
• Atelectasis  and alveolar recruitment : Preoxygenation and induction of anesthesia rapi[INVESTIGATOR_393747]. (16) This atelectasis increases shunt fraction and increases the risk of peri-
procedural hypoxia.  By [CONTACT_393783][INVESTIGATOR_393748] , non-invasive ventilation  raises mean airway pressure, recruiting alveoli and 
preventing the development of atelectasis.  
• Hypopnea  and Apnea. Administration  of sedation and neuromuscular blocking agents 
reduces or eliminates spontaneous respi[INVESTIGATOR_21266].  This hypoventilation leads to 
accumulation of alveolar carbon dioxide and reductions in alveolar oxygen, contributing 
to hypoxemia.  Use of non-invasive ventilation  before  induction  and between induction 
and laryngoscopy  provides continuous oxygen  to the alveoli , increases the  size of breaths 
taken  in the setting of hypopnea, and delivers control led breaths when patients ar e apneic .   
 
 
  9 
 Preoxygenation with facemask oxygen  (via a non -rebreather or compressed bag -mask device ) 
has been proposed to offer the following potential advantages  compared with preoxygenation 
with non -invasive positive pressure ventilation : 
Simplicity of use : Preoxygenation with  facemask oxygen (using either a non -rebreather or 
compressed bag -mask device) is simpler to set up than non-invasive positive pressure 
ventilation .   
Low risk of gastric insufflation : Although no clinical evidence exist to suggest that 
preoxygenation with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation increases the risk of 
gastric insufflation or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_152211] ,(19) use of facemask oxygen (without 
any positive pressure) avoids this hypothetical concern.    
 
2.1.[ADDRESS_494077] compar ed preoxygenation with non-invasive ventilation  to 
preoxygenation with facemask  oxygen  during the tracheal intubation of critically ill adults .(20, 
21) The first trial compared  non-invasive ventilation  to a facemask among [ADDRESS_494078] oxygen 
saturation (93% vs. 81%, p<0.001) with no difference in incidence of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (6% vs. 8%).  
The second trial compared  non-invasive ventilation  to a facemask  oyxgen  with regard to  severity 
of illness in the 7 days after intubation among 201 critically ill ICU patients.  Th is trial found no 
significant  difference in the severity of illness  between groups and no significant difference in 
the rate of severe hypoxemia (18.4% v s 27.7%, p=0.10) . This trial did not have adequate 
statistical power to detect clinically important differences  between groups in the risk of 
hypoxemia .  No large, multicenter trials have compared preoxygenation with non-invasive 
positive pressure ventilation to preoxygenation with facemask  oxygen  for critically ill adults 
undergoing tracheal intubation.   Based on the available data from these small randomized 
clinical trials, preoxygenation with non -invasive positive pressure ventilation and 
preoxygenation with facemask oxygen both re present acceptable approaches to emergency 
tracheal intubation .  Both approaches  are consider ed standard -of-care and are used commonly in 
current clinical practice.

 2.2. Primary Aim and Hypothes is 
 
2.2.1 Study Aim:  
To compare the effect of preoxygenation with non -invasive positive pressure ventilation versus  
preoxygenation with  facemask  oxygen  on hypoxemia  during tracheal intubation of  critically ill 
adults . 
 
2.2.2 Study Hypothes is: 
Among critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation , preoxygenation with non -invasive 
positive pressure ventilation  will reduce the incidence of hypoxemia  between  induction to [ADDRESS_494080] of preoxygenation with non -invasive ventilation versus preoxygenation 
with a facemask on the incidence of hypoxemia among critically ill adults undergoing tracheal 
intubation in the ED and ICU.  
 
3. STUDY POPULATION AND ENROLLMENT  
 
3.1 Inclusion Criteria:  
1. Patient is located in a participating unit  
2. Planned procedure is tracheal intubation using a laryngoscope and sedation  
3. Planned operator is a clinician expected to routinely perform tracheal intubation in the 
participating unit.  
 
3.2 Exclusion Criteria:  
1. Patient is receiving positive pressure ventilation by a mechanical ventilator , bag-mask 
device , or laryngeal mask airway  
2. Patient is known to be less than [ADDRESS_494081] of care treatments in current clinical practice .(8, 22)  Results from prior clinical trials 
are conflicting and to not demonstrate superiority of one approach over the other. Consequently,  
some guidelines  recommend non-invasive positive pressure  ventilation  and other  guidelines  
recommend facemask oxygen. (23-26)  As a result, s ignificant variation exists in the approach to 
 
  11 
 preoxygenation in current clinical practice , with b oth non -invasive positive pressure  ventilation 
and facemask oxygen  used common ly.(8, 27, 28).  This trial will enroll patients who are 
undergoing emergency tracheal intubation as part of their clinical care for whom treating 
clinicians have determined that preoxygenation with EITHER non -invasive positive pressure 
ventilation OR facemask oxygen would be consistent with the optimal care of the patient.  
 
We will request a waiver of informed consent because the study involves minimal incremental 
risk and obtaining informed consent would be impracticable . 
 
Participation in this study involves minimal incremental risk  because:  
• All patients eligible for the study are already undergoing tracheal intubation with 
preoxygenation as part of their clinical care 
• Preoxygenation with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation  and preoxygenation with 
facemask oxygen are both standard -of-care interventions that are commonly used in 
current  clinical care  
• No benefits or risks are currently known to differ between the two approaches  
• Both approaches have determined to be acceptable options for the optimal care of the 
patient by [CONTACT_274408] (otherwise the patient is excluded from the study)  
  
Obtaining  informed consent would be impracticable  because :  
• The expected medical condition of  patients requiring emergency tracheal 
intubation in the ED  or ICU is critical .  Based on prior trials in the same patient 
population and setting, approximately 70% of patients eligible for the PREOXI  trial will 
be experiencing encephalopathy (altered mental status) due to their critical illness . The  
anticipated median Glasgow coma scale score is 11 (equivalent to moderate brain  injury).  
Among the minority of patients whose level of consciousness is not impaired, 45 -55% 
will be experiencing acute delirium.  Thus, most patients eligible for PREOXI  will not 
have the capacity to provide i nformed consent .  Further, family members or legally 
authorized representatives  (LAR)  are frequently unavailable when critically ill patients 
undergo intubation in the ED or ICU .   
• The time available  for patient s or LAR s to consider participation  will be 
insufficient .  Even when a patient retains capacity or a LAR is immediately available, a 
meaningful informed consent process is precluded by [CONTACT_393784] . No published literature has quantified the time from 
clinicians’ decision to perform emergency tracheal intubation (the inclusion criteria for 
PREOXI ) until the initiation of the intubation  procedure  (completion of the  PREOXI 
intervention) . In a convenience sample of 25 consecutive intubation s in the VUMC ED or 
ICU, approximately 50% of intubations occurred within [ADDRESS_494082] been completed under a 
waiver of informed consent  [NCT 0040102, NCT  [ADDRESS_494083]  00441792 ].(7, 29-32)

5. ENROLLMENT AND RANDOMIZATION  
 
5.1 Study Enrollment Locations :  
• Participating emergency departments  
• Participating intensive care units  
 
5.2 Study Sites:  
• Vanderbilt University Medical Center  
• Other locations  
 
5.3 Enrollment  and Randomization  
All patients requiring emergency tracheal intubation in a participating  ED or ICU will be 
screened  for eligibility for the PREOXI trial using the eligibility  criteria in Section 3 . Patients 
who do not meet inclusion criteria will be considered ‘ineligible’. Patients who meet inclusion 
criteria but also meet at least one exclusion criterion will be considered ‘excluded .’  For patients 
who are excluded , the reason for exclusion will be recorded.  For patients who do meet eligibility 
criteria but are not enrolled, the reason will be recorded.   
 
At enrollment, p atients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to preoxygenation with non-invasive 
positive pressure ventilation  or preoxygenation with facemask  oxygen  using randomly permuted 
blocks of variable size .  The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_3885] ( i.e., each participating 
ED or ICU will comprise a  different stratum ).  The study group assignment will be placed in in 
opaque randomization envelopes, which will be located within participating units. Study group 
assignment will remain concealed to study personnel and treating clinicians until after the 
decision has been made to enroll the patient in the study.  
 
To facilitate rapid enrollment during this time -sensitive procedure, sequentially numbered 
randomization envelopes will be located adjacent to the equipment required for emergency 
 
  13 
 tracheal intubation (i.e., airway equipment cart, ICU work room).  When the need for emergency 
tracheal intubation is recognized, envelopes will be obtained by [CONTACT_393785] (referred to as the “ operator ”) or by a delegate while the operator sets up the 
equipment required for intubation.  Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be posted with 
randomization envelopes and printed on the outside of enrollment envelopes.  As the operator 
sets up the equipment for emerge ncy tracheal intubation, a verbal “pre -procedural time -out” 
(described below) will be performed. Based on the experience from our 8 prior randomized 
clinical trials using the same process to perform randomization and group assignment during 
emergency trach eal intubation, all enrollment procedures can be completed in less than one 
minute. For a small number of  particularly urgent intubations (e.g.,  an intubation for cardiac 
arrest), the urgency of the procedure or the limited availability of clinical personnel will preclude 
obtaining and opening the randomization envelope. These cases will be excluded using the 
exclusion criteri on that states “Immediate need for tracheal intubation precludes safe 
performance of study procedures”  (see Section 3) . 
 
As with all trials  conducted to date by [CONTACT_197882], we will  evaluate for the possibility of 
selection bias via the systematic exclusion of a particular groups of patients.  A prospective list 
of excluded patients will be maintained by [CONTACT_60940] .  Data captured on excluded patients will be 
limited to date of exclusion and reason for exclusion. The number of patients excluded and 
reasons for excluded will be reported at the time of trial publication via a consort diagram.  No 
patient -level information on e xcluded patients will be entered into the study database .  The 
coordinating center will not receive any patient -level data on excluded participants.  
 
5.3.1 Pre -Procedural Time -Out to Prevent Enrollment of Ineligible Patients  
The enrollment materials  for the trial will include instructions for a pre -procedural timeout in 
which treating clinicians  or a delegate  recite  aloud the inclusion  and exclusion criteria and 
confirm eligibility prior to enrollment . This process requires less than  10 seconds and can be 
easily completed while the equipment and medications needed for tracheal intubation are being 
obtained . This approach has been successfully used  to confirm eligibility prior to enrollment  in 
multiple prior trials  [[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] , [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ]. (33) 
 
5.3.[ADDRESS_494085] creation.  In the instance that a patient is enrolled who did not meet eligibility 
criteria, this will represent a protocol violation.  Site investigators will report such a protocol 
violation to the trial primary investigators and coordinating center within 24 hours  of becoming 
aware of the occurrence of a protocol violation.  The primary investigators and coordinating 
center will report th e details of such a protocol violation to the IRB within 7 days  of becoming 
aware of the occurrence of a protocol violation.  
 
5.3.3 Handling  of Patients Found to Be Prisoners after Enrollment  
Prisoners typi[INVESTIGATOR_393749], handcuffs, and 
the presence of law enforcement.  Training of treating clinicians and the enrollment procedures 
listed above (posting of inclusion and exclusion criteria alongs ide enrollment envelopes and a 
“pre-enrollment time -out” with verbal recitation of eligibility criteria) have proven to be 
effective in preventing the enrollment of prisoners in recent trials.  
 
  14 
  
If a patient who presents to the ED or ICU is not know n to be a prisoner at the time of enrollment 
and following enrollment  is discovered to be a prisoner or becomes a prisoner between 
enrollment and the end of study follow up , all study procedures will stop immediately , the 
patient will be withdrawn  from the study, and t he patient’s study record will be expunged of all 
study data.   Because both study interventions are one -time, standard -of-care interventions which 
the patient was likely to receive in clinical care even if not participating in research, no furt her 
follow -up will occur . 
 
6. BLINDING  
Given the nature of the trial intervention, blinding of patients and treating clinicians to study 
group assignment is  not possible .  
 
7. STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
 
7.1 Treatment of Study Patients  
For enrolled patients, s tudy group assignment determines  only the approach to preoxygenation .  
All other aspects of the intubation procedure will be at the discretion of the operator, including 
patient position ing, choice of sedative agent, use of a neuromuscular blocker, choice of 
laryngoscope, laryngoscope blade size, use of a bougie to intubate the trachea, use of external 
laryngeal manipulation to optimize laryngeal view, and endotracheal tube diameter .   
 
The administration of additional supplemental oxygen by [CONTACT_393786], including 
during laryngoscopy (referred to as “apneic oxygenation”).   The administration of ventilation via 
a bag-mask  device  will be permitted in both groups between induction and laryngoscopy.   
Operators may use a non -assigned approach to preoxygenation at any time if it is felt to be 
required for the safe management of the patient.  Use of a non-assigned preoxygenation strategy 
as the initial approach to preoxygenation will be collected and considered to represent a 
“crossover .”  For all patients in the trial, best practices in emergency tracheal intubation will be 
encouraged according to clinical protocols in the study settings.    
 
7.2 Preoxygenation with Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation  Group  
Patients assigned to preoxygenation with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation  will receive 
non-invasive mechanical ventilation via a tight -fitting mask from the initiation of preoxygenation  
until the initiation of laryngoscopy.  Trial protocol  will not dictate the brand or type of  
mechanical ventilator that will be used to deliver non -invasive ventilation.    
 
7.3 P reoxygenation with F acemask  Oxygen Group  
For patients randomized to preoxygenation with facemask  oxygen , supplemental oxygen will be 
administered via a  non-rebreather mask or bag-mask  device without  manual ventilation  from the 
initiation of preoxygenation  until induction .  Trial protocol will not dictate the brand or type of 
facemask . The decision between  use of a  non-rebreather mask and use of a bag-mask device will 
be made by [CONTACT_274408] .  The decision of whether to provide manual ventilation with a 
bag-mask device between induction and laryngoscopy will be made by [CONTACT_274408] .

9. DATA COLLECTION  
Data collected for the purposes of this study will come from three  sources: [1] variables 
documented in the electronic health record as part of clinical care, [2] variables recorded  by 
[CONTACT_45914]’s bedside observation during t he intubation procedure , and [3] variables reported by 
 
  [ADDRESS_494087] will be collected by [CONTACT_7355] (key study personnel) using a standardized 
electronic case report form.   It is infeasible to have research staff present during each emergency  
tracheal intubation.  Therefore, clinical staff not participating in the tracheal intubation procedure 
will collect data elements relevant to outcomes of emergency tracheal intubation  using a 
standardized electronic case report form . These variables are readily available  by [CONTACT_393787] (e.g., lowest oxygen  saturation  and lowest blood pressure  from 
induction to two minutes after tracheal intubation ).  Immediately following the intubation 
procedure, the operators will record data elements known only to them (e.g., glottic view 
obtained during the procedure and visualization of gastric aspi[INVESTIGATOR_393750] ).  
Operators  and clinical staff observing the procedure at the bedside will not be considered key 
study personnel. Training will be provided to clinicians  who may serve as operators or bedside 
observe rs.  The activities of these clinicians  will be limited to the reporting of data routinely 
reported  as part of clinical care.

10. Risks and Benefits  
 
10.1 Risks  of Tracheal Intubation in the ED or ICU  
Patients who are severely ill enough to require emergency tracheal intubation in the ED or ICU 
as part of their clinical care are at high risk of complications.  Many patients  are undergoing 
intubation for hypoxemia or hemodynamic instability . Severe hypoxemia or cardiovascular 
instability occur s during  nearly half of intubations in the ED and ICU  (1, 2, 4, 5).  Hypoxemia 
and hypotension during intubation are associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrest and 
death .(9, 10) Cardiac arrest occur s in 1-in-25 cases of emergency tracheal intubation .   
 
Other complications during intubation may include aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (approximately 2.8% of cases), 
esophageal intubation (1.3%) injury to oral or dental structures (0.2%), and pneumothorax 
(0.1%).  The l ong-term consequences of complications  occurring during emergency tracheal 
intubation are unclear .  Neurologic recovery from traumatic brain injury may be worse  after 
hypoxemia due to secondary ischemic insult. (11)  
 
10.2 Potential R isks of Participation in the PREOXI Trial  
Participation in the PREOXI trial involves minimal incremental risk  because:  
• All patients eligible for the study are already experiencing emergency tracheal intubation , 
with the accompanying risks,  as part of their clinical care  
• Preoxygenation with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation  and preoxygenation with 
facemask oxygen are both standard -of-care interventions that are commonly used in 
current clinical care .  All patients eligible for the study would experience an approach to 
preoxygenation as part of their clinical care  
• No benefits or risks are currently known to differ between the two approaches  
• Both approaches have determined to be acceptable options for the optimal care of the 
patient by [CONTACT_274408] (otherwise the patient is excluded from the study)  
 
Although no risks are currently known to differ between preoxygenation with non -invasive 
positive pressure ventilation and preoxygenation with facemask oxygen  (both standard -of-care 
approaches in currently clinical care),  it is possible that the results of the PREOXI trial will 
ultimately demonstrate  a difference between the two approaches in the risk of hypoxemia, 
hypotension, cardiac arrest, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] , or another outcome . 
 
 
  [ADDRESS_494088] benefits  to society that would result 
if one approach to preoxygenation  is found to prevent complications.   Because millions of 
critically ill adults undergo emergency tracheal intubation each year, if one of the two 
approaches were found to prevent serious complications, the findings would immediately 
improve the care provided to millions of severely ill pati ents. Compared to the minimal risks of 
participation in the study, the pursuit of these benefits is reasonable.   
 
10.4 Minimization of Risk  
Federal regulations 45 CFR 46.111(a)(1) require that risks to patients are minimized by [CONTACT_191693]. This trial meets this human subject s 
protection requirement by [CONTACT_393788].  
 
Both approaches to preoxygenation have been used in clinical practice for decades with an 
established safety profile in the same populations included in the  PREOXI trial.   To further 
mitigate risk, we will exclude patients with specific risk factors for adverse events such as those 
already receiving non -invasive positive pressure ventilation and any patient for whom treating 
clinicians determine  that a specific approach to preoxygenation is required  or contraindicated for 
the optimal care of the patient.  
 
The trial protocol includes monitoring of adverse events, robust assessment of clinical outcomes, 
and an interim analysis by [CONTACT_45959] , empowered to stop the trial or modify the trial 
protocol at any time.  
 
Finally, to limit the risks associated with the collection of protected health information (PHI ), the 
minimum amount of PHI necessary for study conduct will be collected.  After collection, the data 
will be stored in a secure online database (REDCap) only accessible by [CONTACT_473]. 
REDCap tools will be used to ensure that the PHI that is collected is only visible to investigators 
at the healthcare system where the patient was enrolled.  To protect participant privacy, REDCap 
tools will be used to ensure that only deidentified data can be exported for use during analysis.  
 
11. Statistical Considerations  
 
11.1 Initial Sample Size Determination:  
The minimum clinically important difference in hypoxemia  that would be required to justify 
routine preoxygenation with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation  rather  than 
preoxygenation with facemask oxygen during emergency tracheal intubation of critically ill 
adults is uncertain.  The current trial will be designed to detect a 6% absolute difference between 
groups in the rate of hypoxemia .  An absolute difference of 6% in the incidence of hypoxemia is 
similar  to or smaller than the difference considered to be clinically meaningful in the design of 
prior air way management trials. (19, 31) Assuming an incidence  of hypoxemia of 17% in the 
facemask group based on data from two recently completed trial s in the same ED and ICU 
settings, detecting a 6% absolute decrease in the incidence  of hypoxemia  with 85% power at a 
two-sided alpha level of 0.05 would require enrollment of 1, 264 patients ( 632 per group). 
Anticipating missing data for up to 3% of patients, we will plan to enroll a total of 1,300 patients 
(650 per group).  This sample size calculation was performed in PS version 3.1.2. 
 
  20 
 11.2 Statistical Analysis : 
Prior to the conclusion of enrollment, we will make publicly available a complete , final statistical 
analysis plan.  Analyses conducted in accordance with the statistical analysis plan will be 
identified as a priori . Any additional analyses requested by [CONTACT_393789] . 
 
11.2.1 Primary Analys is: 
The primary analysis will be an unadjusted, intention -to-treat comparison of patients randomized 
to preoxygenation with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation  versus patients randomized to 
preoxygenation with facemask  oxygen  with regard to the primary outcome. The difference 
between the two study groups will be compared using a Chi -squared test.  
 
11.2.2 Secondary Analysis:  
We will perform intention -to-treat comparisons of secondary, exploratory, and safety outcomes. 
Continuous outcomes will be compared with Wilcoxon Rank Sum test and categorical variables 
with the Chi -squared test. Data on patient characteristics will be sum marized as number and 
proportion for categorical variables and as median and interquartile range for continuous 
variables.  
 
We will also perform  an adjusted comparison of the primary outcome between groups using a 
generalized linear mixed effects model including a random effect for site and fixed effects for 
group assignment and the following pre-specified baseline variables :  
 
1. Age;  
2. Sex; 
3. Race  and Ethnicity ; 
4. Oxygen saturation at enrollment ; 
5. BMI;  
6. Location at enrollment (ED or ICU)  
7. Fraction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_393752];  
8. APACHEII  score ; and  
9. Indication for intubation (hypoxemic respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], other)  
 
11.2.[ADDRESS_494089] Modification (Subgroup Analyses)  
To evaluate whether pre -specified baseline variables modify the effect of study group assignment 
on the primary outcome, we will perform logistic regression modelling with the primary outcome 
as the dependent variable and independent variables of study gro up, the proposed effect 
modifier, and the interaction between the two.  Any interaction term with a p -value less than 0.[ADDRESS_494090] of prespecified subgroup analyses will be outlined in the 
detailed Statistical Analysis Plan but will include:  
 
 
 
  21 
 1. Age;  
2. Sex; 
3. Race and Ethnicity;  
4. BMI;  
5. Location (ED vs ICU);  
6. Fraction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_393753] ; 
7. Indication for intubation (hypoxemic respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], other) ; 
8. APACHEII score ; and  
9. Baseline risk of the primary outcome  
 
11.[ADDRESS_494091] point of the trial, after enrollment of 650 patients. The pre -specified stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_393754] a P value < 0.[ADDRESS_494092]. This conservative Haybittle –Peto boundary will allow the final analysis 
to be performed using an unchanged level of significance (two -sided P value < 0.05).  
Finally, after the interim analysis, the DSMB will evaluate the rate of the primary outcome in the 
facemask group. If the incidence of the primary outcome in the facemask group differs from the 
original estimate, the DSMB may suggest an increase sample size that would maintain the pre -
planned statistical power to detect the pre-planned relative risk difference in the primary 
outcome between groups.  
11.[ADDRESS_494093] size with 95% confidence intervals, as recommended by [CONTACT_19483] ,[ADDRESS_494094] to follow up before the measurement of the primary outcome , but oxygen 
saturation may be unavailable in some cases (equipment malfunction, observer error during a 
rapid, emergency procedure, or cardiac arrest).  Missing data will not be imputed for the primary 
outcome, or any of the secondary or exploratory outcomes. In adjusted analyses, missing data for 
baseline covariates will be imputed using multiple imputations.  
12. Privacy  and Confidentiality  
All patients will be assigned  a unique study ID number for use in the coded study database.  
Study personnel will access patients ’ electronic health records at three planned time points: 
immediately following enrollment ; when collecting baseline demographics and comorbidities 
(may occur anytime between enrollment and final data collection) ; and when collecting clinical 
outcomes ( any time  after the first of discharge or 28 days following intubation).  The electronic 
 
  [ADDRESS_494095] been  used in clinical practice for decades with an 
established safety profile.  However, any trial conducted during a high -risk, time -sensitive 
procedure like tracheal intubation of critically ill patients raises unique safety considerations.  
This protocol addresses these considerations through:  
1. Exclusion criteria designed to prevent enrollment of patients likely to experience adverse 
events from preoxygenation with non -invasive positive pressure ventilation or 
preoxygenation with facemask oxygen ; 
2. Systematic collection of outcomes relevant to the safety of preoxygenation with non -invasive 
positive pressure ventilation and preoxygenation with facemask oxygen ; 
3. Structured monitoring, assessment, recording, and reporting of adverse events . 
 
14.1 Adverse Event Definitions  
Adverse Event – An adverse event will be defined as a ny untoward or unfavorable medical 
occurrence in a human subject  temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the 
 
  [ADDRESS_494096]’s participation in the research .  Any 
adverse event occurring during the research will be classified according to the following 
characteristics:  
 
• Serious ness – An adverse event will be considered “serious” if  it: 
o Results in d eath; 
o Is life -threatening (defined as placing the patient at immediate risk of death ); 
o Results in i npatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] ;  
o Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity;  
o Results in a congeni tal anomaly  or birth defect ; or  
o Based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the  patient ’s health 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
• Unexpected ness – An adverse event will be considered “ unexpected”  if the nature, 
severity, or frequency is n either consistent with:  
o The known or foreseeable risk of adverse events associated with the procedures 
involved in the research that are described in the protocol -related documents, such 
as the IRB -approved research protocol; nor 
o The expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition 
of the subject experiencing the adverse event and the subject’s predisposing risk 
factor profile for the adverse event.  
 
• Related ness – The strength of the relationship of an adverse event to a study intervention 
or study procedure will be defined as follows:  
o Definitely Related : The adverse event follows  (1) a reasonable, temporal 
sequence from a study procedure  AND (2)  cannot be explained by [CONTACT_11347]’s clinical state or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_393755] (3)  evaluation 
of the patient’s clinical state indicates to the investigator that the experience is 
definitely related to study procedures.  
o Probably or Possibly Related : The adverse event meets some but not all of the 
above criteria for “Definitely Related”.  
o Probably Not Related : The adverse event occurred while the patient was on the 
study but can reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_129156]’s clinical state or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
o Definitely Not Related : The adverse event is definitely produced by [CONTACT_102]’s 
clinical state or by [CONTACT_274437].  
o Uncertain Relationship : The adverse event does not fit in  any of the above 
categories . 
 
14.[ADDRESS_494097] of h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_53767] 28 days after enrollment at the time of final 
data collection.  Study personnel at each site will also communicate regularly with the treating 
clinicians who perform tracheal intubation in the study environments between enrollment and 28 
days after enrollment to solicit information about any potential adverse events.  If study 
personnel at a site identify a potential adverse event, the lead inves tigator at the site will be 
immediately notified .  The lead investigator at the site  will assess the seriousness, 
unexpectedness, and relatedness of the potential adverse event .  With assistance as needed from 
the coordinating center and the  trial primary investigator, the lead investigator at the site will 
determine whether the event qualifies for recording and reporting.  
 
14.3 Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
The following types of adverse events will be recorded and reported:  
• Adverse events that are  Serious  and Definitely Related, Probably or Possibly Related, or 
of Uncertain Relationship . 
• Adverse events that are Unexpected  and Definitely Related , Probably or Possibly 
Related , or of Uncertain Relationship . 
Adverse events that do not meet the above criteria will not be recorded or reported.   Adverse 
events that the lead investigator at a site assesses to meet the above criteria for recording and 
reporting will be entered into the adverse event electronic case report form in the trial database .  
The lead investigator at the site  will record a n assessment of each characteristic for the adverse 
event, including seriousness, unexpectedness, and relatedness.  For any adverse event that is 
serious  AND  unexpected , and definitely related, probably or po ssibly related, or of uncertain 
relationship , the lead investigator at the site  will report the adverse event  to the coordinating 
center and the trial primary investigator within 24 hours  of becoming aware of the adverse  
event.   For any other adverse event requiring recording and reporting, the lead investigator at the 
study site will report the adverse event to the coordinating center and the trial principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_874] 72 hours  of becoming aware of the adverse event.  The coordinating center 
and the trial principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_393756], 
including seriousness, expectedness, and relatedness.   The lead investigator at the site  will be 
responsible for making final determinations regarding seriousness and unexpectedness .  The 
coordinating center and trial principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_393757] . 
 
For adverse events that meet the above criteria for recording and reporting , the coordinating 
center will notify the DSMB, the IRB, and the sponsor  in accordance with the following 
reporting plan : 
Characteristics of the Adverse Event  Reporting Period  
 
  25 
 Fatal or life -threatening  (and therefore 
serious),  unexpected , and definitely related, 
probably  or possibility  related , or of uncertain 
relationship.  Report to the DSMB, IRB , and sponsor  within 
7 days after notification of the event . 
Serious but n on-fatal and non-life-
threatening , unexpected , and definitely 
related, probably or possibly related, or of 
uncertain relationship . Report to DSMB , IRB, and sponsor  within 15 
days of  notification of the event . 
All other adverse events meeting criteria for 
recording and reporting.  Report to DSMB in regular ly scheduled  
DSMB safety report s. 
The coordinating center  will distribute the written summary of the DSMB’s periodic review of 
reported adverse events to the IRB in accordance with NIH guidelines : 
(http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice -files/not99 -107.html ).  
14.4 Clinical Outcomes that may be Exempt from Adverse Event Recording and Reporting  
In this study of critically ill patients at high risk for death and other adverse outcomes due to 
their underlying critical illness, clinical outcomes, including death and organ dysfunction, will be 
systematically collected and analyzed for all patients. The primary, secondary, safety, and 
exploratory outcomes will be recorded and reported as clinical outcomes and not as adverse 
events  unless treating clinician s or site investigator s believe the event  is Definitely Related  or 
Probably or Possibly Related  to the study intervention or study procedures.  This approach  – 
considering death and organ dysfunction as clinical outcomes rather than adverse events  and 
systemically collecting these clinical outcomes for analysis  – is common in ICU trials. This 
approach ensures comprehensive data on death and organ dysfunction for all patients, rather than 
relying on  sporadic adverse event reporting to identify these important events.  The following 
events are examples of study -specific clinical outcomes that would not be recorded and reported 
as adverse event s unless treating clinicians or site investigator s believe the event  was Definitely

Problem is defined as any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following 
criteria:  
• Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures 
that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research

physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.  
If any study personnel at a site become aware of an event that may represent an Unanticipated 
problem, they will immediately contact [CONTACT_393790].  The lead investigator 
for the site will assess whether the event represents an Unanticipated Problem by [CONTACT_393791] .  If the lead investigator at a site  determines that the event  represents an 
Unanticipated Problem , the lead investigator at the site  will record the U nanticipated Problem  in

at the site  will then communicate that an Unanticipated Problem  has occurred to the coordinating 
center and the principal  investigator [INVESTIGATOR_874] [ADDRESS_494099] (DSMB)  
The principal role of the DSMB is to assure the safety of patients  in the trial. They will regularly 
monitor data from this trial, review and assess the performance of its operations, and make 
recommendations to the steering committee and sponsor  with respect to:  
• Participant safety and risk/benefit ratio of study procedures and interventions  
• Initial approval of the protocol and subsequent amendments (with specific attention to 
study population, intervention, and study procedures)  
• Adherence to the protocol requirements  
• Completeness, quality, and planned analysis of data  
• Ancillary study burden on participants and main study   
• Possible early termination of the trial because of new external information, early 
attainment of study objectives, safety concerns, or inadequate performance  
 
The DSMB will consist of members with expertise in bioethics, emergency medicine, pulmonary 
and critical care  medicine , anesthesia, biostatistics, and clinical trials. Appointment of all 
members is contingent upon the absence of any conflicts of interest. All the members of the 
DSMB are voting members. The coordinating center, p rincipal investigator s, and unblinded

 1. TRIAL SUMMARY  
 
Title  Pragmatic Trial Examining Oxygenation prior to Intubation (PREOXI)  
Background  Clinicians perform rapid sequence induction, laryngoscopy, and tracheal 
intubation for more than 5 million critically ill adults as a part of clinical 
care each year in the [LOCATION_002] .  One -in-ten emergency tracheal 
intubations is complicated by  [CONTACT_81428]-threatening hypoxemia.  Administering 
supplemental oxygen prior to  induction and  intubation  (“preoxygenation”)  
decreases the risk of  life-threatening hypoxemia . In current clinical 
practice, the most common methods for preoxygenation are non -invasive 
positive pressure ventilation and facemask oxygen.  Prior trials comparing 
non-invasive positive pressure ventilation and facemask oxygen for 
preoxygenation have been small and have yielded  conflicting results.   A 
better understanding of the comparative effectiveness of these two 
common, standard -of-care approaches to preoxygenation could improve 
the care clinicians deliver and patient outcomes.  
Study Design  Multicenter, pragmatic, non-blinded, parallel -group, randomized trial  
Treatment Groups  
 • Non-invasive  positive pressure  ventilation group: Patients will receive 
preoxygenation with non-invasive mechanical ventilation via a tight -
fitting mask.    
• Facemask oxygen group: Patients will receive preoxygenation via either 
a non -rebreather mask or a compressed bag -mask device  without manual 
ventilation .  
Sample Size  1,[ADDRESS_494118]  
2. Patient is known to be less than 18 years old  
3. Patient is known to be pregnant  
4. Patient is known to be a prisoner  
5. Immediate need for tracheal  intubation precludes safe performance of 
study procedures  
6. Patient is apneic, hypopneic, or has another condition requiring 
positive pressure ventilation between enrollment and induction  
7. Operator has determined  that preoxygenation with non-invasive 
positive pressure ventilation  or preoxygenation with facemask oxygen 
is required or contraindicated for optimal care of the patient  
Risks  Participation in this study involves minimal incremental risk because:  
• All patients eligible for the study are already undergoing tracheal 
intubation with preoxygenation as part of their clinical care  
 
  5 
 • Preoxygenation with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation  
and preoxygenation with facemask oxygen are the most common 
approaches to preoxygenation of critically ill adults  in clinical care  
• No benefits or risks are currently known to differ between the two 
approaches  
• If clinicians determine either approach to be required or 
contraindicated for the optimal care of an individual patient,  the 
patient is excluded from the study  
Benefits  The benefits of the PREOXI trial are largely the indirect benefits to future 
patients that will result by a better understanding of whether 
preoxygenation with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation or pre -
oxygenation with facemask oxygen  prevents complications during 
tracheal intubation of critically ill adults.  
Consent  The trial will be conducted with waiver of informed consent because:  
• Participation in the study involves minimal incremental risk  
• Obtaining informed consent prior to emergency tracheal intubation 
of critically ill adults is impracticable  
Randomization  
 Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to preoxygenation with non-
invasive positive pressure ventilation  or pre -oxygenation with facemask 
oxygen.  Randomization will be completed in permuted blocks of variable 
size and stratified by [CONTACT_3725].  
Blinding  Study group assignment will remain concealed to study personnel and 
clinicians  until after the decision has been made to enroll the patient in the 
study. Following enrollment, the trial will not blind patients or clinicians 
to study group assignment.

 2. TRIAL DESCRIPTION  
 
2.1 Background  
Clinicians frequently perform t racheal intubation  of critically ill patients in the emergency 
department (ED) or intensive care unit (ICU).  Complications of intubation , including hypoxemia 
and cardiovascular instability , occur in nearly half of intubations performed in these settings  (1, 
2, 4, 5).   Preventing complications during tracheal intubation is a key focus of clinical care and 
airway management research (4, 6, 7). 
  
2.1.1 Hypoxemia during Intubation of Critically Ill Patients  
Life-threatening hypoxemia  occurs in 1 -in-10 cases of emergency tracheal intubation. (8) Severe 
hypoxemia during intubation is associated with increased risk of cardiac arrest and death. (9, 10) 
Severe hypoxemia may be associated with worse  outcomes in survivors .  For example, 
neurologic recovery from traumatic brain injury may be worse  after hypoxemia due to secondary 
ischemic insult. (11)  
 
2.1.2 Role of Preoxygenation in Preventing Hypoxemia during Intubation  
In current clinical practice, e mergency tracheal intubation involves the nearly simultaneous 
administration of a sedative agent and a neuromuscular blocking agent to optimize the anatomic 
conditions for intubation.  Following medication administration, patients rapi[INVESTIGATOR_393746] -
placed endotracheal tube.  The oxygen contained in the lungs at the time of neuromuscular 
blockade ( i.e., the patient’s functional residual capacity) is the reservoir of o xygen available to 
the patient’s body to prevent hypoxemia and tissue hypoxia during the intubation procedure.  For 
a patient breathing ambient air (i.e., room air), only 21% of the gas in the functional residual 
capacity is oxygen; 78% is nitrogen.  Admin istering 100% oxygen to a patient prior to induction 
of anesthesia and tracheal intubation, referred to as “preoxygenation ,” can replace the nitrogen in 
the lung with oxygen, increasing up to five-fold the reservoir of oxygen available to the body 
during t he procedure and prolonging the period during which intubation can be performed safely 
without encountering hypoxemia.  In current clinical practice, the two most common methods of 
providing preoxygenation are :  
1. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation  - a tight -fitting mask connected to either an 
invasive ventilator or non -invasive mechanical ventilator . 
2. Facemask oxygen  - with either a non -rebreather mask or a bag -mask device . 
2.1.3 Preoxygenation with Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation  
Preoxygenation with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation is common during emergency 
tracheal intubation of critically ill adults in current clinical practice.  During preoxygenation with 
non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, a tight -fitting mask is connected to a machine capable 
of providing positive pressure ventilation . Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation deliver s up 
to 95-100% oxygen  and can be provided by [CONTACT_5640] a conventional invasive mechanical ventilator 
or a dedicated non -invasive  ventilation machine, commonly referred to as a Bilevel Positive 
Airway Pressure (BiPAP)  machine.  In addition to providing high concentrations of oxygen, non -
invasive positive pressure ventilation i ncreases mean airway pressure and delivers breaths at a 
set rate during the  period of  hyponea/apnea after induction. Because a mechanical ventilator is 
always  required following intubation  of a critically ill adult , no specialized equipment is required 
 
  8 
 to use non -invasive positive pressure ventilation for preoxygenation of critically ill adults 
undergoing tracheal intubation .  
2.1.4 Preoxygenation with Facemask Oxygen  
In current clinical practice, p reoxygenation with facemask oxygen is commonly performed using 
one of the following two types of facemask: [1] a non-rebreather mask or [2] a bag-mask  device 
(8, 12).  Both a types of facemask  (a non-rebreather and a compressed bag -mask device ) deliver 
supplemental oxygen without increasing airway pressures or providing assistance with 
ventilation.   
• A non-rebreather mask  is a type of facemask with a loose -fitting mask  that sits over a 
patient’s nose and mouth and is  connected to an oxygen reservoir. It delivers at least 15 
liters per minute of 100% oxygen , but it  may not reliably deliver flows of oxygen greater  
than 15 liters per minute and may allow  entrainment of ambient air. Studies show that the  
while the oxygen content for healthy and calm volunteers may approach 100%, the  
oxygen content received by [CONTACT_393782] 
50%.(14)  It does not  provide positive pressure.  
• A bag mask  device  is a type of facemask  with a mask  that forms a tight seal over the 
mouth and nose when held in place by [CONTACT_73693] , an exhalation port , and a self -
inflating bag that serves as a reservoir for oxygen and can be compressed to provide 
positive pressure ventilation .(13) If the bag of this device  is compressed, this device  
deliver s oxygen without providing positive pressure ventilation  and can deliver more than  
90% oxygen with an ideal mask seal . However, in the setting of emergency intubation 
leaks may result in the entrainment of ambient air and reduced oxygen delivery.      
2.1.5 Potential  Advantages of Preoxygenation with Non -Invasive Positive Pressure 
Ventilation or Preoxygenation with Facemask Oxygen  
 
Preoxygenation with non-invasive  positive pressure  ventilation  has been proposed to offer the 
following potential advantages  compared to preoxygenation with facemask oxygen : 
• Entrainment of ambient air : The tight-fitting  mask  used to deliver non-invasive 
ventilation  entrains less ambient air than a non-rebreather or bag -mask device . The higher 
flow rates of oxygen gas with non-invasive ventilation may also help prevent entrainment 
of ambient air and increase the fraction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1401].  (15) 
• Atelectasis  and alveolar recruitment : Preoxygenation and induction of anesthesia rapi[INVESTIGATOR_393747]. (16) This atelectasis increases shunt fraction and increases the risk of peri-
procedural hypoxia.  By [CONTACT_393783][INVESTIGATOR_393748] , non-invasive ventilation  raises mean airway pressure, recruiting alveoli and 
preventing the development of atelectasis.  
• Hypopnea  and Apnea. Administration  of sedation and neuromuscular blocking agents 
reduces or eliminates spontaneous respi[INVESTIGATOR_21266].  This hypoventilation leads to 
accumulation of alveolar carbon dioxide and reductions in alveolar oxygen, contributing 
to hypoxemia.  Use of non-invasive ventilation  before  induction  and between induction 
and laryngoscopy  provides continuous oxygen  to the alveoli , increases the  size of breaths 
taken  in the setting of hypopnea, and delivers control led breaths when patients ar e apneic .   
 
 
  9 
 Preoxygenation with facemask oxygen  (via a non -rebreather or compressed bag -mask device ) 
has been proposed to offer the following potential advantages  compared with preoxygenation 
with non -invasive positive pressure ventilation : 
Simplicity of use : Preoxygenation with  facemask oxygen (using either a non -rebreather or 
compressed bag -mask device) is simpler to set up than non-invasive positive pressure 
ventilation .   
Low risk of gastric insufflation : Although no clinical evidence exist to suggest that 
preoxygenation with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation increases the risk of 
gastric insufflation or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_152211] ,(19) use of facemask oxygen (without 
any positive pressure) avoids this hypothetical concern.    
 
2.1.[ADDRESS_494124] compar ed preoxygenation with non-invasive ventilation  to 
preoxygenation with facemask  oxygen  during the tracheal intubation of critically ill adults .(20, 
21) The first trial compared  non-invasive ventilation  to a facemask among [ADDRESS_494125] oxygen 
saturation (93% vs. 81%, p<0.001) with no difference in incidence of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (6% vs. 8%).  
The second trial compared  non-invasive ventilation  to a facemask  oyxgen  with regard to  severity 
of illness in the 7 days after intubation among 201 critically ill ICU patients.  Th is trial found no 
significant  difference in the severity of illness  between groups and no significant difference in 
the rate of severe hypoxemia (18.4% v s 27.7%, p=0.10) . This trial did not have adequate 
statistical power to detect clinically important differences  between groups in the risk of 
hypoxemia .  No large, multicenter trials have compared preoxygenation with non-invasive 
positive pressure ventilation to preoxygenation with facemask  oxygen  for critically ill adults 
undergoing tracheal intubation.   Based on the available data from these small randomized 
clinical trials, preoxygenation with non -invasive positive pressure ventilation and 
preoxygenation with facemask oxygen both re present acceptable approaches to emergency 
tracheal intubation .  Both approaches  are consider ed standard -of-care and are used commonly in 
current clinical practice.

 2.2. Primary Aim and Hypothes is 
 
2.2.1 Study Aim:  
To compare the effect of preoxygenation with non -invasive positive pressure ventilation versus  
preoxygenation with  facemask  oxygen  on hypoxemia  during tracheal intubation of  critically ill 
adults . 
 
2.2.2 Study Hypothes is: 
Among critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation , preoxygenation with non -invasive 
positive pressure ventilation  will reduce the incidence of hypoxemia  between  induction to [ADDRESS_494127] of preoxygenation with non -invasive ventilation versus preoxygenation 
with a facemask on the incidence of hypoxemia among critically ill adults undergoing tracheal 
intubation in the ED and ICU.  
 
3. STUDY POPULATION AND ENROLLMENT  
 
3.1 Inclusion Criteria:  
1. Patient is located in a participating unit  
2. Planned procedure is tracheal intubation using a laryngoscope and sedation  
3. Planned operator is a clinician expected to routinely perform tracheal intubation in the 
participating unit.  
 
3.2 Exclusion Criteria:  
1. Patient is receiving positive pressure ventilation by a mechanical ventilator , bag-mask 
device , or laryngeal mask airway  
2. Patient is known to be less than [ADDRESS_494128] of care treatments in current clinical practice .(8, 22)  Results from prior clinical trials 
are conflicting and to not demonstrate superiority of one approach over the other. Consequently,  
some guidelines  recommend non-invasive positive pressure  ventilation  and other  guidelines  
recommend facemask oxygen. (23-26)  As a result, s ignificant variation exists in the approach to 
 
  11 
 preoxygenation in current clinical practice , with b oth non -invasive positive pressure  ventilation 
and facemask oxygen  used common ly.(8, 27, 28).  This trial will enroll patients who are 
undergoing emergency tracheal intubation as part of their clinical care for whom treating 
clinicians have determined that preoxygenation with EITHER non -invasive positive pressure 
ventilation OR facemask oxygen would be consistent with the optimal care of the patient.  
 
We will request a waiver of informed consent because the study involves minimal incremental 
risk and obtaining informed consent would be impracticable . 
 
Participation in this study involves minimal incremental risk  because:  
• All patients eligible for the study are already undergoing tracheal intubation with 
preoxygenation as part of their clinical care 
• Preoxygenation with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation  and preoxygenation with 
facemask oxygen are both standard -of-care interventions that are commonly used in 
current  clinical care  
• No benefits or risks are currently known to differ between the two approaches  
• Both approaches have determined to be acceptable options for the optimal care of the 
patient by [CONTACT_274408] (otherwise the patient is excluded from the study)  
  
Obtaining  informed consent would be impracticable  because :  
• The expected medical condition of  patients requiring emergency tracheal 
intubation in the ED  or ICU is critical .  Based on prior trials in the same patient 
population and setting, approximately 70% of patients eligible for the PREOXI  trial will 
be experiencing encephalopathy (altered mental status) due to their critical illness . The  
anticipated median Glasgow coma scale score is 11 (equivalent to moderate brain  injury).  
Among the minority of patients whose level of consciousness is not impaired, 45 -55% 
will be experiencing acute delirium.  Thus, most patients eligible for PREOXI  will not 
have the capacity to provide i nformed consent .  Further, family members or legally 
authorized representatives  (LAR)  are frequently unavailable when critically ill patients 
undergo intubation in the ED or ICU .   
• The time available  for patient s or LAR s to consider participation  will be 
insufficient .  Even when a patient retains capacity or a LAR is immediately available, a 
meaningful informed consent process is precluded by [CONTACT_393784] . No published literature has quantified the time from 
clinicians’ decision to perform emergency tracheal intubation (the inclusion criteria for 
PREOXI ) until the initiation of the intubation  procedure  (completion of the  PREOXI 
intervention) . In a convenience sample of 25 consecutive intubation s in the VUMC ED or 
ICU, approximately 50% of intubations occurred within [ADDRESS_494129] been completed under a 
waiver of informed consent  [NCT 0040102, NCT  [ADDRESS_494130]  00441792 ].(7, 29-32)

5. ENROLLMENT AND RANDOMIZATION  
 
5.1 Study Enrollment Locations :  
• Participating emergency departments  
• Participating intensive care units  
 
5.2 Study Sites:  
• Vanderbilt University Medical Center  
• Other locations  
 
5.3 Enrollment  and Randomization  
All patients requiring emergency tracheal intubation in a participating  ED or ICU will be 
screened  for eligibility for the PREOXI trial using the eligibility  criteria in Section 3 . Patients 
who do not meet inclusion criteria will be considered ‘ineligible’. Patients who meet inclusion 
criteria but also meet at least one exclusion criterion will be considered ‘excluded .’  For patients 
who are excluded , the reason for exclusion will be recorded.  For patients who do meet eligibility 
criteria but are not enrolled, the reason will be recorded.   
 
At enrollment, p atients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to preoxygenation with non-invasive 
positive pressure ventilation  or preoxygenation with facemask  oxygen  using randomly permuted 
blocks of variable size .  The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_3885] ( i.e., each participating 
ED or ICU will comprise a  different stratum ).  The study group assignment will be placed in in 
opaque randomization envelopes, which will be located within participating units. Study group 
assignment will remain concealed to study personnel and treating clinicians until after the 
decision has been made to enroll the patient in the study.  
 
To facilitate rapid enrollment during this time -sensitive procedure, sequentially numbered 
randomization envelopes will be located adjacent to the equipment required for emergency 
 
  13 
 tracheal intubation (i.e., airway equipment cart, ICU work room).  When the need for emergency 
tracheal intubation is recognized, envelopes will be obtained by [CONTACT_393785] (referred to as the “ operator ”) or by a delegate while the operator sets up the 
equipment required for intubation.  Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be posted with 
randomization envelopes and printed on the outside of enrollment envelopes.  As the operator 
sets up the equipment for emerge ncy tracheal intubation, a verbal “pre -procedural time -out” 
(described below) will be performed. Based on the experience from our 8 prior randomized 
clinical trials using the same process to perform randomization and group assignment during 
emergency trach eal intubation, all enrollment procedures can be completed in less than one 
minute. For a small number of  particularly urgent intubations (e.g.,  an intubation for cardiac 
arrest), the urgency of the procedure or the limited availability of clinical personnel will preclude 
obtaining and opening the randomization envelope. These cases will be excluded using the 
exclusion criteri on that states “Immediate need for tracheal intubation precludes safe 
performance of study procedures”  (see Section 3) . 
 
As with all trials  conducted to date by [CONTACT_197882], we will  evaluate for the possibility of 
selection bias via the systematic exclusion of a particular groups of patients.  A prospective list 
of excluded patients will be maintained by [CONTACT_60940] .  Data captured on excluded patients will be 
limited to date of exclusion and reason for exclusion. The number of patients excluded and 
reasons for excluded will be reported at the time of trial publication via a consort diagram.  No 
patient -level information on e xcluded patients will be entered into the study database .  The 
coordinating center will not receive any patient -level data on excluded participants.  
 
5.3.1 Pre -Procedural Time -Out to Prevent Enrollment of Ineligible Patients  
The enrollment materials  for the trial will include instructions for a pre -procedural timeout in 
which treating clinicians  or a delegate  recite  aloud the inclusion  and exclusion criteria and 
confirm eligibility prior to enrollment . This process requires less than  10 seconds and can be 
easily completed while the equipment and medications needed for tracheal intubation are being 
obtained . This approach has been successfully used  to confirm eligibility prior to enrollment  in 
multiple prior trials  [[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] , [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ]. (33) 
 
5.3.[ADDRESS_494132] creation.  In the instance that a patient is enrolled who did not meet eligibility 
criteria, this will represent a protocol violation.  Site investigators will report such a protocol 
violation to the trial primary investigators and coordinating center within 24 hours  of becoming 
aware of the occurrence of a protocol violation.  The primary investigators and coordinating 
center will report th e details of such a protocol violation to the IRB within 7 days  of becoming 
aware of the occurrence of a protocol violation.  
 
5.3.3 Handling  of Patients Found to Be Prisoners after Enrollment  
Prisoners typi[INVESTIGATOR_393749], handcuffs, and 
the presence of law enforcement.  Training of treating clinicians and the enrollment procedures 
listed above (posting of inclusion and exclusion criteria alongs ide enrollment envelopes and a 
“pre-enrollment time -out” with verbal recitation of eligibility criteria) have proven to be 
effective in preventing the enrollment of prisoners in recent trials.  
 
  14 
  
If a patient who presents to the ED or ICU is not know n to be a prisoner at the time of enrollment 
and following enrollment  is discovered to be a prisoner or becomes a prisoner between 
enrollment and the end of study follow up , all study procedures will stop immediately , the 
patient will be withdrawn  from the study, and t he patient’s study record will be expunged of all 
study data.   Because both study interventions are one -time, standard -of-care interventions which 
the patient was likely to receive in clinical care even if not participating in research, no furt her 
follow -up will occur . 
 
6. BLINDING  
Given the nature of the trial intervention, blinding of patients and treating clinicians to study 
group assignment is  not possible .  
 
7. STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
 
7.1 Treatment of Study Patients  
For enrolled patients, s tudy group assignment determines  only the approach to preoxygenation .  
All other aspects of the intubation procedure will be at the discretion of the operator, including 
patient position ing, choice of sedative agent, use of a neuromuscular blocker, choice of 
laryngoscope, laryngoscope blade size, use of a bougie to intubate the trachea, use of external 
laryngeal manipulation to optimize laryngeal view, and endotracheal tube diameter .   
 
The administration of additional supplemental oxygen by [CONTACT_393786], including 
during laryngoscopy (referred to as “apneic oxygenation”).   The administration of ventilation via 
a bag-mask  device  will be permitted in both groups between induction and laryngoscopy.   
Operators may use a non -assigned approach to preoxygenation at any time if it is felt to be 
required for the safe management of the patient.  Use of a non-assigned preoxygenation strategy 
as the initial approach to preoxygenation will be collected and considered to represent a 
“crossover .”  For all patients in the trial, best practices in emergency tracheal intubation will be 
encouraged according to clinical protocols in the study settings.    
 
7.2 Preoxygenation with Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation  Group  
Patients assigned to preoxygenation with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation  will receive 
non-invasive mechanical ventilation via a tight -fitting mask from the initiation of preoxygenation  
until the initiation of laryngoscopy.  Trial protocol  will not dictate the brand or type of  
mechanical ventilator that will be used to deliver non -invasive ventilation.    
 
7.3 P reoxygenation with F acemask  Oxygen Group  
For patients randomized to preoxygenation with facemask  oxygen , supplemental oxygen will be 
administered via a  non-rebreather mask or bag-mask  device without  manual ventilation  from the 
initiation of preoxygenation  until induction .  Trial protocol will not dictate the brand or type of 
facemask . The decision between  use of a  non-rebreather mask and use of a bag-mask device will 
be made by [CONTACT_274408] .  The decision of whether to provide manual ventilation with a 
bag-mask device between induction and laryngoscopy will be made by [CONTACT_274408] .

 9. DATA COLLECTION  
Data collected for the purposes of this study will come from three  sources: [1] variables 
documented in the electronic health record as part of clinical care, [2] variables recorded  by 
[CONTACT_45914]’s bedside observation during t he intubation procedure , and [3] variables reported by 
[CONTACT_393792] . Data from the electronic medical 
record will be collected by [CONTACT_7355] (key study personnel) using a standardized 
electronic case report form.   It is infeasible to hav e research staff present during each emergency  
tracheal intubation.  Therefore, clinical staff not participating in the tracheal intubation procedure 
will collect data elements relevant to outcomes of emergency tracheal intubation  using a 
standardized electronic case report form . These variables are readily available  by [CONTACT_393787] (e.g., lowest oxygen saturation  and lowest blood pressure  from 
induction to two minutes after tracheal intubation ).  Immediately following the intubation 
procedure, the operators will record data elements known only to them (e.g., glottic view 
obtained during the procedure and visualization of gastric aspi[INVESTIGATOR_393750] ).  
Operators  and clinical staff observing the procedure at the bedside will not be considered key 
study personnel. Training will be provided to clinicians  who may serve as operators or bedside 
observers .  The activities of these clinicians  will be limited to the reporting of data routinely

10. Risks and Benefits  
 
10.1 Risks  of Tracheal Intubation in the ED or ICU  
Patients who are severely ill enough to require emergency tracheal intubation in the ED or ICU 
as part of their clinical care are at high risk of complications.  Many patients  are undergoing 
intubation for hypoxemia or hemodynamic instability . Severe hypoxemia or cardiovascular 
instability occur s during  nearly half of intubations in the ED and ICU  (1, 2, 4, 5).  Hypoxemia 
and hypotension during intubation are associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrest and 
death .(9, 10) Cardiac arrest occur s in 1-in-25 cases of emergency tracheal intubation .   
 
Other complications during intubation may include aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (approximately 2.8% of cases), 
esophageal intubation (1.3%) injury to oral or dental structures (0.2%), and pneumothorax 
(0.1%).  The l ong-term consequences of complications  occurring during emergency tracheal 
intubation are unclear .  Neurologic recovery from traumatic brain injury may be worse  after 
hypoxemia due to secondary ischemic insult. (11)  
 
10.2 Potential R isks of Participation in the PREOXI Trial  
Participation in the PREOXI trial involves minimal incremental risk  because:  
• All patients eligible for the study are already experiencing emergency tracheal intubation , 
with the accompanying risks,  as part of their clinical care  
• Preoxygenation with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation  and preoxygenation with 
facemask oxygen are both standard -of-care interventions that are commonly used in 
current clinical care .  All patients eligible for the study would experience an approach to 
preoxygenation as part of their clinical care  
• No benefits or risks are currently known to differ between the two approaches  
• Both approaches have determined to be acceptable options for the optimal care of the 
patient by [CONTACT_274408] (otherwise the patient is excluded from the study)  
 
Although no risks are currently known to differ between preoxygenation with non -invasive 
positive pressure ventilation and preoxygenation with facemask oxygen  (both standard -of-care 
 
  19 
 approaches in currently clinical care),  it is possible that the results of the PREOXI trial will 
ultimately demonstrate  a difference between the two approaches in the risk of hypoxemia, 
hypotension, cardiac arrest, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] , or another outcome . 
 
10.[ADDRESS_494134] benefits  to society that would result 
if one approach to preoxygenation  is found to prevent complications.   Because millions of 
critically ill adults undergo emergency tracheal intubation each year, if one of the two 
approaches were found to prevent serious complications, the findings would immediately 
improve the care provided to millions of severely ill pati ents. Compared to the minimal risks of 
participation in the study, the pursuit of these benefits is reasonable.   
 
10.4 Minimization of Risk  
Federal regulations 45 CFR 46.111(a)(1) require that risks to patients are minimized by [CONTACT_191693]. This trial meets this human subject s 
protection requirement by [CONTACT_393788].  
 
Both approaches to preoxygenation have been used in clinical practice for decades with an 
established safety profile in the same populations included in the  PREOXI trial.   To further 
mitigate risk, we will exclude patients with specific risk factors for adverse events such as those 
already receiving non -invasive positive pressure ventilation and any patient for whom treating 
clinicians determine  that a specific approach to preoxygenation is required  or contraindicated for 
the optimal care of the patient.  
 
The trial protocol includes monitoring of adverse events, robust assessment of clinical outcomes, 
and an interim analysis by [CONTACT_45959] , empowered to stop the trial or modify the trial 
protocol at any time.  
 
Finally, to limit the risks associated with the collection of protected health information (PHI ), the 
minimum amount of PHI necessary for study conduct will be collected.  After collection, the data 
will be stored in a secure online database (REDCap) only accessible by [CONTACT_473]. 
REDCap tools will be used to ensure that the PHI that is collected is only visible to investigators 
at the healthcare system where the pati ent was enrolled.  To protect participant privacy, REDCap 
tools will be used to ensure  that only deidentified data can be exported for use during analysis.  
 
11. Statistical Considerations  
 
11.1 Initial Sample Size Determination:  
The minimum clinically important difference in hypoxemia  that would be required to justify 
routine preoxygenation with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation  rather  than 
preoxygenation with facemask oxygen during emergency tracheal intubation of critically ill 
adults is uncertain.  The current trial will be designed to detect a 6% absolute difference between 
groups in the rate of hypoxemia .  An absolute difference of 6% in the incidence of hypoxemia is 
similar  to or smaller than the difference considered to be clinically meaningful in the design of 
prior airway management trials. (19, 31) Assuming an incidence  of hypoxemia of 17% in the 
facemask group based on data from two recently completed trial s in the same ED and ICU 
 
  20 
 settings, detecting a 6% absolute decrease in the incidence  of hypoxemia  with 85% power at a 
two-sided alpha level of 0.05 would require enrollment of 1, 264 patients ( 632 per group). 
Anticipating missing data for up to 3% of patients, we will plan to enroll a total of 1,300 patients 
(650 per group).  This sample size calculation was performed in PS version 3.1.2. 
11.2 Statistical Analysis : 
Prior to the conclusion of enrollment, we will make publicly available a complete , final statistical 
analysis plan.  Analyses conducted in accordance with the statistical analysis plan will be 
identified as a priori . Any additional analyses requested by [CONTACT_393789] . 
 
11.2.1 Primary Analys is: 
The primary analysis will be an unadjusted, intention -to-treat comparison of patients randomized 
to preoxygenation with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation  versus patients randomized to 
preoxygenation with facemask  oxygen  with regard to the primary outcome. The difference 
between the two study groups will be compared using a Chi -squared test.  
 
11.2.2 Secondary Analysis:  
We will perform intention -to-treat comparisons of secondary, exploratory, and safety outcomes. 
Continuous outcomes will be compared with Wilcoxon Rank Sum test and categorical variables 
with the Chi -squared test. Data on patient characteristics will be sum marized as number and 
proportion for categorical variables and as median and interquartile range for continuous 
variables.  
 
We will  also perform  an adjusted comparison of the primary outcome between groups using a 
generalized linear mixed effects model including a random effect for site and fixed effects for 
group assignment and the following pre-specified baseline variables :  
 
1. Age;  
2. Sex; 
3. Race  and Ethnicity ; 
4. BMI;  
5. Location at enrollment (ED or ICU)  
6. Highest f raction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_393761];  
7. APACHEII  score ; and  
8. Indication for intubation ( hypoxemic respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]: Yes vs No ) 
9. Operator experience (number of previous intubations the operator has performed)  
 
11.2.[ADDRESS_494135] Modification (Subgroup Analyses)  
To evaluate whether pre -specified baseline variables modify the effect of study group assignment 
on the primary outcome, we will perform logistic regression modelling with the primary outcome 
as the dependent variable and independent variables of study gro up, the proposed effect 
modifier, and the interaction between the two.  Any interaction term with a p -value less than 0.[ADDRESS_494136] of prespecified subgroup analyses will be outlined in the 
detailed Statistical Analysis Plan but will include:  
 
 
1. BMI;  
2. Location (ED vs ICU);  
3. Highest f raction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_393761])  
4. Indication for intubation (hypoxemic respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], other) ; 
5. APACHEII score ; and 
6.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_494137] point of the trial, after enrollment of 650 patients. The pre -specified stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_393754] a P value < 0.[ADDRESS_494138]. This conservative Haybittle –Peto boundary will allow the final analysis 
to be performed using an unchanged level of significance (two -sided P value < 0.05).  
Finally, after the interim analysis, the DSMB will evaluate the rate of the primary outcome in the 
facemask group. If the incidence of the primary outcome in the facemask group differs from the 
original estimate, the DSMB may suggest an increase sample size that would maintain the pre -
planned statistical power to detect the pre-planned relative risk difference in the primary 
outcome between groups.  
11.[ADDRESS_494139] size with 95% confidence intervals, as recommended by [CONTACT_19483] ,[ADDRESS_494140] to follow up before the measurement of the primary outcome , but oxygen 
saturation may be unavailable in some cases (equipment malfunction, observer error during a 
rapid, emergency procedure, or cardiac arrest).  Missing data will not be imputed for the primary 
outcome, or any of the secondary or exploratory outcomes. In adjusted analyses, missing data for 
baseline covariates will be imputed using multiple imputations.  
12. Privacy  and Confidentiality  
All patients will be assigned  a unique study ID number for use in the coded study database.  
Study personnel will access patients ’ electronic health records at three planned time points: 
immediately following enrollment ; when collecting baseline demographics and comorbidities 
(may occur anytime between enrollment and final data collection) ; and when collecting clinical 
 
  22 
 outcomes ( any time  after the first of discharge or 28 days following intubation).  The electronic 
health record may be accessed again, as needed, between enrollment and study publication to 
respond to queries from the coordinating center focused on ensuring data completenes s and 
quality. The minimal PHI that is collected will be visible only to site investigators at the site 
where the patient was enrolled .  The dataset for analysis will contain the unique study ID and no 
other patient identifiers .  At the t ime of publication, a fully de-identifie d version of the database 
will be generated.  
 
At no time during the course of this study, its analysis, or its publication will patient identities be 
revealed in any manner.  The minimum necessary data containing patient or provider identities 
will be collected.  Data collected from the medical record will be entered into the secure online 
database REDCap.  Hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_393762] a locked room until after the completion of enrollment and 
data cleaning.  Following publication of the study results , all hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_393763] -identified in accordance with 
institutional regulations .  
 
13. Follow -up and Record Retention  
Patients will be followed after enrollment up to [ADDRESS_494141] been  used in clinical practice for decades with an 
established safety profile.  However, any trial conducted during a high -risk, time -sensitive 
procedure like tracheal intubation of critically ill patients raises unique safety considerations.  
This protocol addresses these considerations through:  
1. Exclusion criteria designed to prevent enrollment of patients likely to experience adverse 
events from preoxygenation with non -invasive positive pressure ventilation or 
preoxygenation with facemask oxygen ; 
2. Systematic collection of outcomes relevant to the safety of preoxygenation with non -invasive 
positive pressure ventilation and preoxygenation with facemask oxygen ; 
3. Structured monitoring, assessment, recording, and reporting of adverse events . 
 
 
  23 
 14.1 Adverse Event Definitions  
Adverse Event – An adverse event will be defined as a ny untoward or unfavorable medical 
occurrence in a human subject  temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the 
research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research .  Any 
adverse event occurring during the research will be classified according to the following 
characteristics:  
 
• Serious ness – An adverse event will be considered “serious” if  it: 
o Results in d eath; 
o Is life -threatening (defined as placing the patient at immediate risk of death ); 
o Results in i npatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] ;  
o Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity;  
o Results in a congeni tal anomaly  or birth defect ; or  
o Based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the  patient ’s health 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
• Unexpected ness – An adverse event will be considered “ unexpected”  if the nature, 
severity, or frequency is n either consistent with:  
o The known or foreseeable risk of adverse events associated with the procedures 
involved in the research that are described in the protocol -related documents, such 
as the IRB -approved research protocol; nor 
o The expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition 
of the subject experiencing the adverse event and the subject’s predisposing risk 
factor profile for the adverse event.  
 
• Related ness – The strength of the relationship of an adverse event to a study intervention 
or study procedure will be defined as follows:  
o Definitely Related : The adverse event follows  (1) a reasonable, temporal 
sequence from a study procedure  AND (2)  cannot be explained by [CONTACT_11347]’s clinical state or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_393755] (3)  evaluation 
of the patient’s clinical state indicates to the investigator that the experience is 
definitely related to study procedures.  
o Probably or Possibly Related : The adverse event meets some but not all of the 
above criteria for “Definitely Related”.  
o Probably Not Related : The adverse event occurred while the patient was on the 
study but can reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_129156]’s clinical state or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
o Definitely Not Related : The adverse event is definitely produced by [CONTACT_102]’s 
clinical state or by [CONTACT_274437].  
o Uncertain Relationship : The adverse event does not fit in  any of the above 
categories . 
 
14.[ADDRESS_494142] of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53767] 28 days after enrollment at the time of final 
data collection.  Study personnel at each site will also communicate regularly with the treating 
clinicians who perform tracheal intubation in the study environments between enrollment and 28 
days after enrollment to solicit information about any potential adverse events.  If study 
personnel at a site identify a potential adverse event, the lead inves tigator at the site will be 
immediately notified .  The lead investigator at the site  will assess the seriousness, 
unexpectedness, and relatedness of the potential adverse event .  With assistance as needed from 
the coordinating center and the  trial primary investigator, the lead investigator at the site will 
determine whether the event qualifies for recording and reporting.  
 
14.3 Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
The following types of adverse events will be recorded and reported:  
• Adverse events that are  Serious  and Definitely Related, Probably or Possibly Related, or 
of Uncertain Relationship . 
• Adverse events that are Unexpected  and Definitely Related , Probably or Possibly 
Related , or of Uncertain Relationship . 
Adverse events that do not meet the above criteria will not be recorded or reported.   Adverse 
events that the lead investigator at a site assesses to meet the above criteria for recording and 
reporting will be entered into the adverse event electronic case report form in the trial database .  
The lead investigator at the site  will record a n assessment of each characteristic for the adverse 
event, including seriousness, unexpectedness, and relatedness.  For any adverse event that is 
serious  AND  unexpected , and definitely related, probably or po ssibly related, or of uncertain 
relationship , the lead investigator at the site  will report the adverse event  to the coordinating 
center and the trial primary investigator within 24 hours  of becoming aware of the adverse  
event.   For any other adverse event requiring recording and reporting, the lead investigator at the 
study site will report the adverse event to the coordinating center and the trial principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_874] 72 hours  of becoming aware of the adverse event.  The coordinating center 
and the trial principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_393756], 
including seriousness, expectedness, and relatedness.   The lead investigator at the site  will be 
responsible for making final determinations regarding seriousness and unexpectedness .  The 
coordinating center and trial principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_393757] . 
 
For adverse events that meet the above criteria for recording and reporting , the coordinating 
center will notify the DSMB, the IRB, and the sponsor  in accordance with the following 
reporting plan : 
 
  25 
 Characteristics of the Adverse Event  Reporting Period  
Fatal or life -threatening  (and therefore 
serious),  unexpected , and definitely related, 
probably  or possibility  related , or of uncertain 
relationship.  Report to the DSMB, IRB , and sponsor  within 
7 days after notification of the event . 
Serious but n on-fatal and non-life-
threatening , unexpected , and definitely 
related, probably or possibly related, or of 
uncertain relationship . Report to DSMB , IRB, and sponsor  within 15 
days of  notification of the event . 
All other adverse events meeting criteria for 
recording and reporting.  Report to DSMB in regular ly scheduled  
DSMB safety report s. 
The coordinating center  will distribute the written summary of the DSMB’s periodic review of 
reported adverse events to the IRB in accordance with NIH guidelines : 
(http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice -files/not99 -107.html ).  
14.4 Clinical Outcomes that may be Exempt from Adverse Event Recording and Reporting  
In this study of critically ill patients at high risk for death and other adverse outcomes due to 
their underlying critical illness, clinical outcomes, including death and organ dysfunction, will be 
systematically collected and analyzed for all patients. The primary, secondary, safety, and 
exploratory outcomes will be recorded and reported as clinical outcomes and not as adverse 
events  unless treating clinician s or site investigator s believe the event  is Definitely Related  or 
Probably or Possibly Related  to the study intervention or study procedures.  This approach  – 
considering death and organ dysfunction as clinical outcomes rather than adverse events  and 
systemically collecting these clinical outcomes for analysis  – is common in ICU trials. This 
approach ensures comprehensive data on death and organ dysfunction for all patients, rather than 
relying on  sporadic adverse event reporting to identify these important events.  The following 
events are examples of study -specific clinical outcomes that would not be recorded and reported 
as adverse event s unless treating clinicians or site investigator s believe the event  was Definitely 
Related  or Probably or Possibly Related  to the study intervention or study procedures:  
• Death (all deaths occurring prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53767] 28 days will be recorded ); 
• Organ dysfunction  
o Pulmonary – hypoxemia, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], acute hypoxemic respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], 
pneumothorax  
o Cardiac – hypotension, shock, vasopressor receipt, cardiac arrest;  
• Duration of mechanical ventilation;  
• Duration of ICU admission;  
• Duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_393758]: A study -specific clinical outcome may also qualify as an adverse event  meeting criteria for 
recording and reporting . For example, a pneumothorax that the investigator considers Definitely 
Related  to preoxygenation with non -invasive positive pressure ventilation would be both 
recorded as a study -specific clinical outcome and recorded and reported as a Serious  and 
Definitely Related  adverse event.  
 
 
  [ADDRESS_494143] also report Unanticipated Problems  Involving Risks to Subjects or Others 
(“Unanticipated Problems ”), regardless of severity, associated with study procedures within 24 
hours  of the site  investigator becoming aware of the Unanticipated Problem . An Unanticipated 
Problem is defined as any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following 
criteria:  
• Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures 
that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research 
protocol; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied;  AND  
• Definitely Related  or Probably or Possibly Related  to participation in the research  (as 
defined above in the section on characteristics of adverse events) ; AND   
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.  
If any study personnel at a site become aware of an event that may represent an Unanticipated 
problem, they will immediately contact [CONTACT_393790].  The lead investigator 
for the site will assess whether the event represents an Unanticipated Problem by [CONTACT_393791] .  If the lead investigator at a site  determines that the event  represents an 
Unanticipated Problem , the lead investigator at the site  will record the U nanticipated Problem  in 
the U nanticipated Problem  electronic case report form in the trial database .  The lead investigator 
at the site  will then communicate that an Unanticipated Problem  has occurred to the coordinating 
center and the principal  investigator [INVESTIGATOR_874] [ADDRESS_494144] (DSMB)  
The principal role of the DSMB is to assure the safety of patients  in the trial. They will regularly 
monitor data from this trial, review and assess the performance of its operations, and make 
recommendations to the steering committee and sponsor  with respect to:  
• Participant safety and risk/benefit ratio of study procedures and interventions  
• Initial approval of the protocol and subsequent amendments (with specific attention to 
study population, intervention, and study procedures)  
• Adherence to the protocol requirements  
• Completeness, quality, and planned analysis of data  
• Ancillary study burden on participants and main study   
• Possible early termination of the trial because of new external information, early 
attainment of study objectives, safety concerns, or inadequate performance  
 
The DSMB will consist of members with expertise in bioethics, emergency medicine, pulmonary 
and critical care  medicine , anesthesia, biostatistics, and clinical trials. Appointment of all 
members is contingent upon the absence of any conflicts of interest. All the members of the 
DSMB are voting members. The coordinating center, p rincipal investigator s, and unblinded 
study biostatistician  will be responsible for the preparation of all DSMB and adverse event 
 
  [ADDRESS_494145] the ability to r ecommend t hat the trial  end, be modif ied, or 
continue d unchanged.

ABSTRACT 
Background:  Hypoxemia is a common and life-threatening complication during 
emergency tracheal intubation of critically ill adults. The administration of supplemental oxygen prior to the procedure (“preoxygenation”) decreases the risk of hypoxemia during intubation.  Research Question: Whether preoxygenation with noninvasive ventilation prevents 
hypoxemia during tracheal intubation of critically ill adults, compared to preoxygenation with oxygen mask, remains uncertain.  
Study Design and Methods: The PRagmatic trial Examining OXygenation prior to 
Intubation (PREOXI) is a prospective, multicenter, non-blinded randomized comparative effectiveness trial being conducted in 7 emergency departments and 17 intensive care 
units across the [LOCATION_002].  The trial compares preoxygenation with noninvasive 
ventilation versus oxygen mask among 1300 critically ill adults undergoing emergency tracheal intubation. Eligible patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either noninvasive ventilation or an oxygen mask prior to induction. The primary outcome is 
the incidence of hypoxemia, defined as a peripheral oxygen saturation <85% between 
induction and [ADDRESS_494163] oxygen saturation between induction and 2 minutes after intubation. Enrollment began on 10 
March 2022 and is expected to conclude in 2023. 
Interpretation:  The PREOXI trial will provide important data on the effectiveness of 
noninvasive ventilation and oxygen mask preoxygenation for the prevention of 
hypoxemia during emergency tracheal intubation.  Specifying the protocol and statistical  .

INTRODUCTION 
Life-threatening hypoxemia occurs in 10-20% of emergency tracheal intubations 
in the Emergency Department (ED) and Intensive Care Unit (ICU).1,[ADDRESS_494164] by a clinician and can be used to provide supplemental oxygenation alone, or both supplemental oxygen and 
manual ventilation.
9 Both types of oxygen mask can deliver up to 100% oxygen, are 
simple to set up, and have low potential for gastric insufflation. However, oxygen masks 
may deliver oxygen less effectively in critically ill patients when tachypnea, high minute 
ventilation, and poor mask seal allow the entrainment of ambient air with resulting 
alveolar oxygen concentrations as low as 50%.7,10   .

Preoxygenation is also routinely administered via noninvasive ventilation, in 
which a tight-fitting mask is connected to a machine capable of providing both 100% 
oxygen and positive pressure ventilation. Compared to an oxygen mask, noninvasive 
ventilation may reduce air entrainment by [CONTACT_26129] a higher inspi[INVESTIGATOR_393764]. Additionally, noninvasive ventilation increases the 
mean airway pressure and recruits atelectatic lung, potentially reducing shunting.  
Compared with an oxygen mask, noninvasive ventilation may take longer to initiate and may potentially increase the risk of gastric insufflation and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  
 Two small, randomized trials have compared these two approaches to 
preoxygenation. The first trial found that, among [ADDRESS_494165] 
oxygen saturation compared to an oxygen mask (mean lowest oxygen saturation 93% 
vs. 81%, respectively, P<0.001) with no difference between groups in the incidence of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (6% vs. 8%).
11 Among 201 ICU patients in 6 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_393765], the second 
trial found no difference in the severity of illness in the 7 days after intubation and an 
incidence of hypoxemia during intubation of 18.4% in the noninvasive ventilation group 
versus 27.7% in the oxygen mask group (P = 0.10).12 Thus, whether noninvasive 
ventilation for preoxygenation in critically ill adults undergoing emergency tracheal 
intubation decreases the incidence of hypoxemia compared to an oxygen mask remains 
unknown.  Therefore, we designed the PRagmatic trial Examining OXygenation prior to Intubation (PREOXI) to test the hypothesis that, among critically ill adults undergoing 
emergency tracheal intubation in the ED and ICU, preoxygenation with noninvasive  .

PREOXI is a pragmatic, multicenter, non-blinded, parallel-group, randomized trial 
comparing preoxygenation with noninvasive ventilation to preoxygenation with an 
oxygen mask among critically ill adults undergoing emergency tracheal intubation in the 
ED and ICU.  The primary outcome is the incidence of hypoxemia, defined as a peripheral oxygen saturation < 85% between induction of anesthesia and two minutes 
after intubation. The trial is conducted by [CONTACT_393804] 
(www.pragmaticcriticalcare.org). An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) is monitoring the progress and safety of the trial. The trial was registered prior 
to initiation of enrollment (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
 
Study Population:  
Patients located in a participating ED or ICU who are undergoing tracheal intubation 
using a laryngoscope and sedation are eligible. Patients are excluded if they are known to be less than [ADDRESS_494166] an immediate need for tracheal 
intubation that precludes performance of study procedures, or if the clinician performing 
the procedure (referred to as the “operator”) determines that preoxygenation with noninvasive ventilaton or an oxygen mask is either required or contraindicated. 
Complete lists of inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in Table 2. 
 
Randomization and treatment allocation: 
 Patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to undergo preoxygenation with 
noninvasive ventilaton vs oxygen mask in permuted blocks of variable size, stratified by  .

study site.  Study-group assignments are generated using a computerized 
randomization sequence, placed in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes, and 
distributed to enrolling sites. Before opening the envelope, the operator determines that 
the patient meets eligibility criteria.  Study group assignment remains concealed to study personnel and treating clinicians until after the decision has been made to enroll 
the patient and the envelope is opened.  Patients are considered to be enrolled once 
the operator opens the opaque trial envelope to reveal study group assignment. After randomization, patients, treating clinicians, and study personnel are not blinded to study 
group assignment due to the nature of the study intervention. 
 
STUDY INTERVENTIONS 
Training: 
Before beginning enrollment at each site, study investigators provide training on 
study procedures including instructional videos with consensus best practice 
recommendations for preoxygenation with noninvasive ventilation and preoxygenation 
with an oxygen mask.  Observers receive in-person training on the collection of data 
during the intubation procedure using example data collection sheets. Descriptions of the training videos and website links can be found in the supplementary appendix.  
 Noninvasive ventilation group: 
 For patients assigned to the noninvasive ventilation group, operators are 
instructed to administer noninvasive ventilation via a tight-fitting mask covering the nose and mouth connected to either a conventional mechanical ventilator or a dedicated  .

noninvasive ventilator (i.e., BiPAP machine) from the initiation of preoxygenation until 
the initiation of laryngoscopy.  The trial protocol does not dictate brand or type of 
ventilator, ventilator settings, or duration of preoxygenation.  Operators receive the 
following best practice recommendations for the administration of preoxygenation using noninvasive ventilation: 
1. Preoxygenate 
≥ 3 minutes (if feasible) 
2. Continue noninvasive ventilation until initiation of laryngoscopy 3. Fraction of Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_103170] (FiO2) of 100% 
4. Expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111] 
≥ 5 cm of water 
5. Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_27111] ≥ 10 cm of water  
6. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_135890] ≥ 10  
 
Oxygen mask group: 
For patients assigned to the oxygen mask group, clinicians are instructed to 
administer supplemental oxygen via a non-rebreather mask or bag-mask device without 
manual ventilation from the initiation of preoxygenation until the induction of anesthesia.   
The operator determines whether to use a non-rebreather mask or a bag-mask device without manual ventilation.  The trial protocol does not dictate the brand or type of non-
rebreather or bag-mask device or duration of preoxygenation.  Between induction of 
anesthesia and initiation of laryngoscopy, the operator determines whether to provide oxygen with a non-rebreather mask, oxygen with a bag-mask device without manual 
ventilation, or oxygen with a bag-mask device with manual ventilation.

receive the following best practice recommendations for the administration of 
preoxygenation using an oxygen mask: 
1. Preoxygenate ≥ 3 minutes (if feasible) 
2. Maximal oxygen flow rate possible ( ≥ 15 liters per minute) 
3. Continue oxygenation from induction to laryngoscopy 
 Cointerventions: 
 Study group assignment determines only the initial method of preoxygenation.  Treating clinicians determine all other aspects of the intubation procedure including: [1] 
the co-administration of supplemental oxygen by [CONTACT_21294] (either standard nasal cannula, large bore nasal cannula, or heated high flow nasal cannula) before induction, 
between induction an initiation of laryngoscopy, and between initiation of laryngoscopy 
and intubation of the trachea; [2] choice of induction medication and timing of administration; [3] use of neuromuscular blockade; [4] choice of laryngoscope; [5] use of additional airway management equipment and adjuncts; and [6] post-intubation 
ventilator settings.  
 
Data Collection  
An observer not directly involved with the intubation procedure collects data for 
key periprocedural outcomes, including oxygen saturation at induction and the lowest 
value for oxygen saturation between induction and two minutes after successful 
intubation.  Observers may be clinical personnel on the enrolling unit (e.g., physicians or 
nurses) or research personnel. Immediately after the intubation procedure, the operator  .

 The primary outcome is the incidence of hypoxemia, defined as a peripheral 
oxygen saturation <85% during the interval between induction and 2 minutes after 
intubation.   
We selected hypoxemia (as a binary variable) rather than lowest oxygen 
saturation (a continuous variable) as the primary outcome for the trial for several reasons. First, experiencing hypoxemia in the range associated with an increased risk 
of adverse clinical outcomes (e.g., cardiac arrest) may be more clinically relevant than changes in oxygen saturation within the normal range.  For example a change in 
oxygen saturation of 5 percentage points from 87% to 82% may be more closely 
associated with adverse outcomes than a change in oxygen saturation of 10 percentage points from 100% to 90%. Second, values for oxygen saturation are “right-censored”

2) of approximately [ADDRESS_494168] experts.
15-20 
We selected an oxygen saturation of <85% as the threshold for the primary 
outcome based on several physiologic and procedural factors. First, an oxygen saturation of 85% corresponds with the inflection point on the oxyhemoglobin 
dissociation curve, at which further decrements in arterial oxygen concentrations result in rapid and critical desaturation.
9 Second, an oxygen saturation <85% has been 
associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrest during tracheal intubation21 and may 
be associated with increased mortality.5   .

Secondary Outcome: 
The sole secondary outcome is the lowest oxygen saturation during the interval 
between induction and 2 minutes after tracheal intubation.

patients (650 per group).  This sample size calculation was performed in PS version 
3.1.2 (Nashville, Tennessee). 
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board and Interim Analysis 
 A data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) consisting of members with expertise in bioethics, emergency medicine, pulmonary and critical care medicine, 
anesthesiology, biostatistics, and clinical trial methodology has overseen the design of the trial and is monitoring its conduct.  The DSMB will review a single interim analysis, 
prepared by [CONTACT_393806] 650 patients.  The pre-specified stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_393766] a P value < 0.[ADDRESS_494170] for the difference between groups in the primary 
outcome. This conservative Haybittle–Peto boundary will allow the final analysis to be 
performed using an unchanged level of significance (two-sided P value < 0.05). 
The DSMB has the authority to recommend that the trial stop at any point, 
request additional data, request additional interim analyses, or request modifications to 
the study protocol.   
 
Statistical Analysis Principles 
 Analyses will be conducted following reproducible research principles using R  (R 
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,  Austria). Categorical variables will be 
presented as number and percentage and compared between groups using a Chi-
square text.  Continuous variables will be presented as mean ± SD or median and IQR 
and compared between groups using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. We will also present  .

absolute between-group differences with associated 95% confidence intervals. A two-
sided P-value of < 0.05 will define a statistically significant between-group difference in 
the primary outcome. With a single primary outcome, no adjustment for multiplicity will 
be made. For secondary, safety, and exploratory analyses, emphasis will be placed on the magnitude of differences between groups with 95% confidence intervals rather than 
statistical significance. 
 
Main Analysis of the Primary Outcome 
 The main analysis will be an unadjusted, intention-to-treat comparison of the 
primary outcome of hypoxemia between patients randomized to the noninvasive 
ventilation group versus patients randomized to the oxygen mask group, using a chi-
square test.  The absolute difference in proportions, associated 95% confidence 
interval, and a P value for the comparison will be presented. The primary analysis will be conducted among patients for whom the primary outcome is available without imputation of missing data. 
 
Additional Analyses of the Primary Outcome 
Multivariable analysis  To account for relevant baseline covariates, we will fit a generalized linear mixed 
effects model using a logit link function with the primary outcome as the dependent variable, study site as a random effect, and fixed effects of study group and the 
following prespecified baseline covariates: age, sex, race and ethnicity, body mass 
index (BMI), location at enrollment (ED or ICU), highest fraction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_393767]  .

relationship to the outcome using restricted cubic splines with between [ADDRESS_494171] of 
study group assignment (noninvasive ventilation vs oxygen mask) on the primary 
outcome using a formal test of statistical interaction in a generalized linear mixed-effects 
model with the primary outcome as the dependent variable, study site as a random effect and fixed effects of study group, the prespecified proposed effect modifier and the 
interaction between the two.   For categorical variables, we will present the OR and 95% 
CIs within each prespecified subgroup. Continuous variables will not be dichotomized 
for analysis of effect modification but may be dichotomized for data presentation.  In accordance with the Instrument for assessing the Credibility of effect Modification 
Analyses (ICEMAN) recommendations, we have prespecified the following baseline 
variables as potential effect modifiers and hypothesized the direction of effect modification for each: 
1. Patient location (ED vs ICU)
. We hypothesize that patient location will not modify 
the effect of study group assignment on the primary outcome.  
2. Body Mass Index (kg/m2). We hypothesize that Body Mass Index (BMI) will 
modify the effect of study group assignment on the primary outcome, with a greater decrease in the incidence of hypoxemia with preoxygenation within the  .

 We will conduct unadjusted, intention-to-treat analyses comparing patients 
randomized to the noninvasive ventilation group versus the oxygen mask group with regard to all pre-specified safety, clinical, and exploratory outcomes.  Continuous 
outcomes will be compared with the Wilcoxon rank sum test and categorical variables 
with the chi-square test. Between-group differences in continuous and categorical variables and the associated 95% confidence intervals will be presented.  
 Handling of missing data: 
 We anticipate that no patients will be lost to follow up before assessment of the 
primary outcome.  In some cases, the oxygen saturation between induction and 2 minutes after intubation will be unmeasurable (e.g., poor plethysmography of pulse  .

oximetry, shock, cardiac arrest, peripheral arterial disease, or other reasons) or 
unavailable. We anticipate that data will be missing in less than 3% of cases based on 
the rates of missing data in prior trials in similar settings.25,26  Missing data will  
not be imputed for the primary outcome or for any of the secondary or exploratory 
outcomes. In adjusted analyses, missing data for baseline covariates will be imputed 
using multiple imputations. 
 
Trial status:  
PREOXI is a pragmatic, multi-center, non-blinded randomized clinical trial 
comparing preoxygenation with noninvasive ventilation to preoxygenation with an oxygen mask during the tracheal intubation of critically ill adults. Enrollment began on 
10 March 2022 and is expected to conclude in 2023.  
 
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION  
Waiver of Informed Consent: 
Critically ill patients undergoing tracheal intubation in the ED or ICU are at 
significant risk for morbidity and mortality from their underlying illness. Most patients undergoing tracheal intubation in routine clinical care receive preoxygenation with either 
noninvasive ventilation or an oxygen mask.  Any benefits or risks of these two approaches are experienced by [CONTACT_393809], 
outside the context of research. As a requirement for enrollment in PREOXI, the 
patient’s treating clinician must determine that either preoxygenation with noninvasive  . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a  is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. (which was not certified by [CONTACT_393793])The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted March 24, 2023. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.23.23287539doi: medRxiv preprint 
ventilation or preoxygenation with an oxygen mask would be a safe and reasonable 
approach for the patient (otherwise the patient is excluded). Therefore, making the 
decision between the two approaches randomly in the context of a pragmatic trial, 
rather than by a clinician who thinks either approach is safe and reasonable for the patient, is expected to pose no more than minimal additional risk. 
 Obtaining informed consent from potential study participants or their legally 
authorized representatives would be impracticable. The majority of critically ill patients undergoing emergency tracheal intubation lack decisional capacity due to their critical 
illness and surrogate decision makers are frequently unavailable. Further, emergency 
tracheal intubation is a time-sensitive procedure with only minutes between the decision to intubate and the completion of the procedure. Meaningful informed consent could not 
be executed in this brief window. Attempting to obtain informed consent could lead to 
potentially deleterious delays in intubation which would increase the risk of hypoxemia, hypotension, and cardiac arrest.   
Because the study involves minimal incremental risk, the study would not 
adversely affect the welfare or privacy rights of the participant, and obtaining informed consent would be impracticable, a waiver of informed consent was requested from and approved by [CONTACT_393810] 
(reference number VUMC IRB# 211271). Conduct of this trial with waiver of informed 
consent is consistent with previous randomized trials comparing alternative approaches to tracheal intubation in widespread clinical use.

addressed any local contextual factors with the site principal investigator, and ceded 
responsibility for ethics approval and study oversight to the single IRB. 
 
Information for Patients and Families 
Information regarding the study is m ade available to patients and families 
following intubation using a patient and family information sheet.  The patient and family 
information sheet contains information on the purpose of the PREOXI trial, study procedures, risks and discomforts, benefits, use of protected health information, 
confidentiality, and investigator contact [CONTACT_3031]. The Defense Health Agency Human 
Research Protection Office determined that this procedure meets the requirement of 32 CFR 219 and DODI 3216.02_AFI40-402.  At centers with a significant population of 
non-English speaking patients, the patient and family information sheet has been 
translated into Spanish and Somali languages. 
 
Protocol Changes 
In accordance with SPI[INVESTIGATOR_184959], changes to the study protocol will be 
documented on clinicaltrials.gov (see online supplementary file) and submitted to the sIRB for approval.  Data Handling 
Privacy protocols and data handling are reported in the online supplement.

We will submit the trial results to a peer-reviewed journal for publication.  Trial 
results will also be presented at scientific conferences and disseminated online and via 
social media in forms suitable for public understanding. 
 
Conclusion 
The PREOXI trial will provide important data on the effectiveness of common 
preoxygenation strategies for the prevention of hypoxemia during emergency tracheal intubation with a goal of improving outcomes for critically ill adults. To aid in the 
transparency and interpretation of trial results, this protocol and statistical analysis plan 
for the PREOXI trial has been finalized prior to the conclusion of patient enrollment.

BACKGROUND: Hypoxemia is a common and life-threatening complication during emergency
tracheal intubation of critically ill adults. The administration of supplemental oxygen before
the procedure (ie, preoxygenation) decreases the risk of hypoxemia during intubation.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Does preoxygenation with noninvasive ventilation prevent hypoxemia
during tracheal intubation of critically ill adults compared with preoxygenation with anoxygen mask?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The Pragmatic Trial Examining Oxygenation Prior to Intu-
bation (PREOXI) is a prospective, multicenter, nonmasked randomized comparative effec-tiveness trial being conducted in seven EDs and 17 ICUs across the [LOCATION_002]. The trial
compares preoxygenation with noninvasive ventilation vs oxygen mask among 1,300 criti-
cally ill adults undergoing emergency tracheal intubation. Eligible patients are randomized in
a 1:1 ratio to receive either noninvasive ventilation or an oxygen mask before induction. The
primary outcome is the incidence of hypoxemia, de ﬁned as a peripheral oxygen saturation
of<85% between induction and [ADDRESS_494188]
oxygen saturation between induction and 2 min after intubation. Enrollment began onMarch 10, 2022, and is expected to conclude in 2023.
INTERPRETATION: The PREOXI investigation will provide important data on the comparative
effectiveness of preoxygenation with noninvasive ventilation vs oxygen mask for the preventionof hypoxemia during emergency tracheal intubation. Specifying the protocol and statistical
analysis plan before the conclusion of enrollment increases the rigor, reproducibility, and
interpretability of the trial.

Life-threatening hypoxemia occurs in 10% to 20% of
emergency tracheal intubations in the ED and ICU.1,[ADDRESS_494189] by a
clinician and can be used to provide supplemental
oxygenation alone, or both supplemental oxygen and
ventilation.
9Both types of oxygen mask can deliver up
to 100% oxygen, are simple to set up, and have lowpotential for gastric insuf ﬂation. However, oxygen
masks may deliver oxygen less effectively in critically illpatients when high minute ventilation and poor maskseal allow the entrainment of ambient air, with resulting
alveolar oxygen concentrations as low as 50%.

ventilation may reduce air entrainment by [CONTACT_26129] a
higher inspi[INVESTIGATOR_696] ﬂow rate of oxygen and by
[CONTACT_393813]. Additionally, noninvasive ventilationincreases the mean airway pressure and recruits
atelectatic lung, potentially reducing shunting.
Compared with an oxygen mask, noninvasive
ventilation may take longer to initiate and potentially
may increase the risk of gastric insuf ﬂation and
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].
Two small randomized trials have compared these two
approaches to preoxygenation. The ﬁrst trial found that,
among [ADDRESS_494191] oxygen saturation compared with
the effects of an oxygen mask (mean lowest oxygen
saturation, 93% vs 81%, respectively; P<.001) with no
difference between groups in the incidence of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516](6% vs 8%).
11Among 201 patients in the ICUs of six
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], the second trial found no difference in the
severity of illness in the 7 days after intubation and an
incidence of hypoxemia during intubation of 18.4% in
the noninvasive ventilation group vs 27.7% in the
oxygen mask group ( P¼.10).12Thus, whether
noninvasive ventilation for preoxygenation in criticallyill adults undergoing emergency tracheal intubation
decreases the incidence of hypoxemia compared with an
oxygen mask remains unknown. We designed the
Pragmatic Trial Examining Oxygenation Prior toIntubation (PREOXI) to test the hypothesis that, among
critically ill adults undergoing emergency tracheal
intubation in the ED and ICU, preoxygenation with
noninvasive ventilation decreases the incidence of
hypoxemia compared with preoxygenation with an
oxygen mask.

Noninvasive Ventilation Group
For patients assigned to the noninvasive ventilationgroup, operators are instructed to administer noninvasive
ventilation using either a conventional mechanical
ventilator or a dedicated noninvasive ventilator (ie, a
bilevel positive airway pressure machine). The operatordetermines the ventilator type, ventilator mode,
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_393773], and mandatory
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]. Operators receive the following best
practice recommendations for the administration of
preoxygenation using noninvasive ventilation: (1)
preoxygenate $3 min (if feasible); (2) continue
noninvasive ventilation until initiation of laryngoscopy,
(3) F
IO2of 100%, (4) expi[INVESTIGATOR_393774] $5c mH 2O;
(5) use an inspi[INVESTIGATOR_393774] $10 cm H 2O, and (6)
respi[INVESTIGATOR_135890] $10 breaths per minute.
Oxygen Mask Group
For patients assigned to the oxygen mask group,clinicians are instructed to administer supplemental
oxygen via a non-rebreather mask or bag-mask device
without bag-mask ventilation from the initiation of
preoxygenation until the induction of anesthesia. The
operator determines whether to use a non-rebreather
mask or a bag-mask device (without ventilation).
Operators receive the following best practice
recommendations for the administration of
preoxygenation using an oxygen mask: (1)
preoxygenate $3 min (if feasible), (2) use the maximum
oxygen ﬂow rate possible ( $15 L/min), and (3)
continue oxygenation from induction to laryngoscopy.
Cointerventions
In both trial groups, trial protocol allows theadministration of supplemental oxygen by [CONTACT_393815]- ﬂow nasal cannula during
preoxygenation, between induction of anesthesia andinitiation of laryngoscopy, and between initiation of
laryngoscopy and intubation of the trachea. Bag-mask
ventilation between induction and laryngoscopy also
may be provided at the discretion of the operator in both
groups. Figure 1 shows the interventions,
cointerventions, and phases of the intubation processduring which these interventions are applied.TABLE 2 ]Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Data Collection
An observer not directly involved with the intubation
procedure collects data for key periprocedural outcomes,
including oxygen saturation at induction and the lowest
value for oxygen saturation between induction and 2 min
after successful intubation. Observers may be trained
clinical personnel (eg, physicians or nurses) or research
personnel. Immediately after the intubation procedure,
the operator completes a paper data collection form to
record the device used for preoxygenation, the durationof preoxygenation, the devices used for oxygenation and
ventilation between induction and laryngoscopy, and
complications of intubation (eg, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]).

adjustment for multiplicity will be made. For secondary,
safety, and exploratory analyses, emphasis will be placed
on the magnitude of differences between groups with
95% CIs, rather than statistical signi ﬁcance.
Main Analysis of the Primary Outcome
The main analysis will be an unadjusted intention-to-treat comparison of the primary outcome of hypoxemia
between patients randomized to the noninvasive
ventilation group vs patients randomized to the oxygen
mask group using a
c2test. The absolute difference in
proportions, associated 95% CI, and a Pvalue for the
comparison will be presented. The primary analysis will
be conducted among patients for whom the primary
outcome is available without imputation of missing data.Planned tables of baseline characteristics, procedural
characteristics, and outcomes are presented in e-Tables 2
and3.
Additional Analyses of the Primary Outcome
Multivariable Analysis: To account for relevant baseline
covariates, we will ﬁt a generalized linear mixed effects
model using a logit link function with the primaryoutcome as the dependent variable, study site as a
random effect, and ﬁxed effects of study group and the
following prespeci ﬁed baseline covariates: age, sex, race
and ethnicity, BMI, location at enrollment (ED or ICU),highest F
IO21 h before initiation of preoxygenation,
Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IIscore,
18indication for intubation (hypoxemic
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]: yes vs no), and operator experience(number of previous intubations the operator has
performed). All continuous variables will be modelled
assuming a nonlinear relationship to the outcome using
restricted cubic splines with between [ADDRESS_494200] Modi ﬁcation: We will examine whether
prespeci ﬁed baseline variables modify the effect of study
group assignment on the primary outcome using a
formal test of statistical interaction in a logistic regression
model with the primary outcome as the dependent
variable and independent variables of study group, the
proposed effect modi ﬁer, and the interaction between the
two. For categorical variables, we will present the OR and95% CIs within each prespeci ﬁed subgroup. Continuousvariables will not be dichotomized for analysis of effect
modi ﬁcation, but may be dichotomized for data
presentation. In accordance with the Instrument forAssessing the Credibility of Effect Modi ﬁcation Analyses
recommendations, we have prespeci ﬁed the following
baseline variables as potential effect modi ﬁers and
hypothesized the direction of effect modi ﬁcation for
each.
Patient Location (ED vs ICU): We hypothesize that
patient location will not modify the effect of study group
assignment on the primary outcome.
BMI (kg/m
2):We hypothesize that BMI will modify the
effect of study group assignment on the primary
outcome, with a greater decrease in the incidence of
hypoxemia in the noninvasive ventilation group
compared with the oxygen mask group among patients
with higher BMIs, as compared with patients with lower
BMIs. This hypothesis is supported by [CONTACT_393819]-dependent shunting that is likely to improve with

decrease in the incidence of hypoxemia in the
noninvasive ventilation group compared with the
oxygen mask group among patients with hypoxemic

hypothesis is supported by [CONTACT_393820].org [ADDRESS_494202] patients undergoing trachealintubation in routine clinical care receive
preoxygenation with either noninvasive ventilation or an
oxygen mask. Any bene ﬁts or risks of these two
approaches are experienced by [CONTACT_393821], outside the context ofresearch. As a requirement for enrollment in PREOXI,
the patient ’s treating clinician must determine that
either preoxygenation with noninvasive ventilation orpreoxygenation with an oxygen mask would be a safe
and reasonable approach for the patient. Otherwise, the
patient is excluded. Therefore, making the decision
between the two approaches randomly in the context of
a trial, rather than by a clinician who thinks either
approach is safe, is expected to pose no more thanminimal additional risk.
Obtaining informed consent from potential study
participants or their legally authorized representativeswould be impracticable. Most critically ill patients
undergoing emergency tracheal intubation lack
decisional capacity because of the critical illness and
surrogate decision-makers frequently are unavailable.
Further, emergency tracheal intubation is a time-
sensitive procedure with only minutes between the
decision to intubate and the completion of the
procedure. Meaningful informed consent could not be
executed in this brief window.Because the study involves minimal incremental risk, the
study would not adversely affect the welfare or privacy
rights of the participant, and because obtaining

informed consent was requested from and approved by

of this trial with waiver of informed consent is consistent
with previous randomized trials comparing alternative
approaches to tracheal intubation in widespread clinical
use.

Discussion
Herein, we report the rationale, design, and analysis plan
for PREOXI, a 1,300-patient randomized trial of
preoxygenation with noninvasive ventilation
vs preoxygenation with oxygen mask among critically ill
adults undergoing emergency tracheal intubation in the
ED or ICU. Several important trial design elements bear
additional consideration.
We selected hypoxemia (as a binary variable), rather
than lowest oxygen saturation (a continuous variable), as
the primary outcome for the trial for several reasons.
First, experiencing hypoxemia in the range associatedwith an increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes (eg,
cardiac arrest) may be more clinically relevant than
changes in oxygen saturation within the normal range.
For example, a change in oxygen saturation of 5
percentage points from 87% to 82% may be associated
more closely with adverse outcomes than a change in
oxygen saturation of 10 percentage points from 100% to
90%. Second, values for oxygen saturation are right-
censored because oxygen saturation reaches 100% with a
Pa
O2of approximately [ADDRESS_494204] experts.
24-29
We selected an oxygen saturation of <85% as the
threshold for the primary outcome based on severalphysiologic and procedural factors. First, an oxygen
saturation of 85% corresponds with the in ﬂection point
on the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, at which
8Original Research [1#[ADDRESS_494205] Critical Care SEPTEMBER 2023 ]
further decrements in arterial oxygen concentrations
result in rapid and critical desaturation.9Second, an
oxygen saturation of <85% has been associated with an
increased risk of cardiac arrest during tracheal
intubation30and may be associated with increased
mortality.[ADDRESS_494206] and
can provide a tight mask seal. A bag-mask device also
can be used to provide positive-pressure ventilation,
which in the oxygen mask group of the current trial was
allowed only after induction of anesthesia. Although
these differences theoretically could affectpreoxygenation, available evidence suggests that the two
devices perform similarly.
31Any theoretical difference in
preoxygenation between two devices providing oxygen islikely to be much smaller than the difference between
these devices, which provide supplemental oxygen alone,
and devices that provide both supplemental oxygen and
positive-pressure ventilation (ie, the noninvasive
ventilation group in PREOXI). Allowing both types of
oxygen masks routinely used in clinical care also
increases the generalizability of trial results.
The use of positive-pressure ventilation after induction
of anesthesia (the end of preoxygenation) is allowed in
both trial groups. Evidence from a prior randomized
trial conducted among patients in the ICU suggests that
bag-mask ventilation between induction and
laryngoscopy reduces the risk of hypoxemia.
2However,
the safety and ef ﬁcacy of bag-mask ventilation has not
been evaluated among patients in the ED. Some experts
have advocated avoiding bag-mask ventilation among
patients in the ED who are less likely to have fasted thanpatients in the ICU and therefore may be at higher risk
of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].
32Because PREOXI enrolls patients in both
the ED and ICU and focuses on preoxygenation and notmanagement between induction and laryngoscopy, trial
protocol allows bag-mask ventilation after induction of
anesthesia, but does not mandate it.
Theﬁnal design consideration is the administration of
supplemental oxygen via standard nasal cannula and
high- ﬂow nasal cannula. Because oxygen facemasksand facemasks for noninvasive ventilation must be
removed during laryngoscopy, some experts advocate
for the administration of supplemental oxygen via
standard nasal cannula oxygen or high- ﬂow nasal
cannula during laryngoscopy. The randomized trialsavailable to date have not demonstrated consistently a
beneﬁt from administration of supplemental oxygen
via standard nasal cannula or high- ﬂow nasal cannula
during tracheal intubation.
15,33-38Therefore, the trial
protocol for PREOXI allows, but does not require, theadministration of supplemental oxygen via standardnasal cannula and high- ﬂow nasal cannula in both
trial groups.
Interpretation
PREOXI will provide important evidence regarding the
effectiveness of common preoxygenation strategies for
the prevention of hypoxemia during emergency trachealintubation. To aid in the transparency and
interpretation of trial results, this article detailing the
protocol and statistical analysis plan for PREOXI has
been ﬁnalized before the conclusion of patient
enrollment.

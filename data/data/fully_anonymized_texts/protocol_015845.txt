 SYNOPSIS  
Protocol 
Number  20-001 
Study Title  FLAME: FL owTriever for Acute Massive Pulmonary Embolism  
Study Device  FlowTriever Retrieval/Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_228463] 
510(k) number K180466. The FlowTriever System is indicated for use in the 
peripheral vasculature and for the treatment of pulmonary embolism.  
Sponsor  Inari Medical  
9 Parker, Suite 100  
Irvine, CA  [ZIP_CODE]  
Study Objective  The primary objective of this observational study is to  evaluate treatment 
outcomes of patients diagnosed with high -risk (massive ) pulmonary embolism who 
have received treatment with the FlowTriever System compa red to an established 
performance goal  (literature -based goal) .   
 
In addition to the primary objective, outcomes of patients diagnosed with high -risk 
(massive) pulmonary embolism who have received treatment with other (non -
FlowTriever) therapi[INVESTIGATOR_228464].  
Study 
Population  FlowTriever Arm:  
Up to  71 subjects will be enrolled in the FlowTriever Arm .  FlowTriever Arm 
subjects are defined as those subjects where FlowTriever is used as the primary 
treatment for high -risk pulmonary embolism.  Patients presenting with low 
/intermediate -risk PE and treated with anticoagulation alone who subsequently 
progress to high -risk PE and are treated front -line with FlowTriever will be enrolled 
in the FlowTriever Arm.  An interim analysis will be performed on the first 50 
subjects  enrolled in the FlowTriever Arm , at which time enrollment may be  closed 
based on the results of the interim analysis .   
Context Arm:  
Subjects with high -risk (massive) pulmonary embolism who are treated with non -
FlowTriever therapie s (as the primary treatment for high -risk PE) will be enrolled in 
the Context Arm concurrently with subjects in the FlowTriever Arm.   Subjects 
presenting with low/intermediate -risk PE who are initially treated with 
anticoagulation  and subsequently progres s to high -risk PE should be enrolled in 
the Context Arm  if not treated front -line by [CONTACT_228524] .   The Context 
Arm will enroll concurrently with the FlowTriever Arm until FlowTriever enrollment 
is completed , with a minimum enrollment of 1:1 subjects  in both the FlowTriever 
and Context arms , and a maximum  enrollment  of 2:1 Context  Arm to FlowTriever 
Arm subjects .  Subjects enrolled in the  Context Arm will be analyzed separately 
from the endpoint analysis utilizing descriptive methods.

 Prior Therapy Arm:  
Subjects presenting with low/intermediate -risk PE  who receive advanced therapy 
during their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228465] -risk PE should be 
enrolled in the Prior Therapy  Arm.  Enrollment in the Prior Therapy Arm will be 
concurr ent with the FlowTriever Arm of the study, and enrollment in this arm will 
cease when enrollment in the Flow Triever Arm is complete.   
 
Data collection for Prior Therapy Arm subjects will include information 
surrounding the PE treatment, progression to High -Risk PE, and patient course 
through hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  Safety data will be collected, but not CEC adjudicated 
or analyzed as outlined for the FlowTriever and Context Arm subjects.  Subjects 
receiving prior advanced treatment for low/intermediate -risk PE  in the same 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228466] a second treatment for high -risk PE likely have a different 
profile than those receiving advanced care for the first time after diagnosis of high -
risk PE, and therefore should be looked at separately.  In the spi[INVESTIGATOR_228467], data will be collected to 
ensure representation of this smaller yet significant group of high -risk PE patients.  
 
Concurrent Enrollment in All Arms:  
Sites participating in the FLAME study will enroll all subjects  presenting with high -
risk (massive) PE over the course of the study, regardless of their primary 
thrombus removal  strategy  or prior therapy  to ensure enrollment of all -comers to 
the study.   Subject s will be enrolled in each arm as described above.  
Number of Sites  The FLAME Study will be conducted at u p to 20 sites in the [LOCATION_002] . 
Study Design  Prospective, multicenter, non -randomized , parallel  group , observational study of  
subjects concurrent ly enrolled in the  FlowTriever , Context , and Prior Therapy

 1 INTRODUCTION AND BAC KGROUND  
Pulmonary embolism (PE) comprises one element of venous thromboembolism (VTE), an entity that 
includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and PE. PE occur when venous thrombi travel from the peripheral 
veins, through the heart, and lodge in the pulmonary arterial circulation. The emboli arise from 
peripheral locations, usually the large deep veins of the leg and pelvis, but sometimes from the large 
veins of the upper extremities. While small PE may remain asymptomatic and go unnoticed, larger 
emboli may result in s ignificant pulmonary artery obstruction, right heart decompensation, and death. 
Some PEs are immediately fatal, particularly large PE that lodge at the bifurcation of the main 
pulmonary artery into its right and left branches; the so called “saddle embolus .” On the other hand, PE 
may occur in a repeated fashion, often over months or even years, insidiously obliterating the 
pulmonary arterial outflow to culminate in debilitating pulmonary hypertension and the syndrome 
known as chronic thromboembolic pulmonar y hypertension, or “CTEPH.”   
High -risk PE carries  a significantly high mortality rate. Even after intervention, the morbidity and 
mortality of this disease process is profound.1-4 Medica l treatment paradigms for high -risk PE also pose 
risk, with many of these possible therapi[INVESTIGATOR_228471].5 Surgical 
thrombectomy for high -risk PE has been performed with some success if treated  before the 
development of cardiogenic shock  but again poses risk of significant morbidity and mortality .6 Systemic 
thrombolysis has long been a treatment option for high -risk PE patients, although the treatment  is 
associated with significant bleeding risks. Rates of major bleeding spanning from approximately 10% -
50% have been reported, with rates of intercranial hemorrhage of approximately 3% -4%.2, 3, [ADDRESS_275068] in the world  (Figure 1). 
Data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1993 -2012 showed that US hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228472] 23 per 100,000 in 1993 to 65 per 100,000 in 2012.12 Interestingly, over the same time period 
there was a decrease in admissions for high -risk PE (2.8  to 1.5  per 100,000).12 The rise in detection of PE 
is likely due to better diagnosis with the increased use of computed tomographic pulmonary 
angiography (CTPA) over the years of study. All -cause mortality in  PE patients decreased from 7.1% in 
1993 to 3.2% in 2012.12 A study in China also showed a drop in the fatality rate, from 25% in 1997 to less 
than 10% in 20 08; a change likely accounted for by [CONTACT_228528], 
possibly, improved treatment after recognition.13 However, a  recent multicenter U.S. study on 
Pulmonary Embolism Response Teams (PERTs) found the 30 -day mortality rate among the centers 
ranged from 9% to 44% (with a mean of 16%) for patients with PE.14 Not surprisingly, the mortality rate 
for patients with high -risk PE is higher compared to intermediate -risk patients. A fivefold increase in 
mortality has been reported for high -risk PE  as compared to intermediate -risk patients.8

 In a study publi shed in Circulation, according to Kucher  et al. , the incidence of high -risk PE  was 4.5% .15 
Of patients with PE, a recent report on PERTs in the U.S. found that 12.3% of PE patients were in the 
high -risk PE category.[ADDRESS_275069] imaging 
analyses. Patients can be subcategorized using, for instance, the Geneva or Wells prediction models.

FLAME Study (Protocol 20-001) CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_275070] centers today.16 Except for the evaluation of CTEPH, CTPA has 
replaced V/Q scan as the imaging test of choice. The accuracy of CTPA, however, i s not uniform. 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_64947], reconstruction artifacts (e.g., “stair -step” artifact), or beam -hardening artifacts from 
high density structures such as a contrast -filled superior vena cava may be responsible for errors.17 As 
well, CTPA can over -diagnose small, subsegmental emboli of little clinical conseq uence.18 Irrespective of 
the clinical implications of small, subsegmental emboli on CTPA, these can be false  positive findings, and 
duplex ultrasonography of the lower extremity veins can be helpful in these cases.17,19 The terminology 
of massive pulmonary embolism  correlates to the “high -risk” pulmonary embolus as defined by [CONTACT_228529] (ESC).20, 21 
The diagnosis of high -risk PE is typi[INVESTIGATOR_228473] : Acute PE with 
sustained hypotension (defined as a systolic blood pressure <[ADDRESS_275071] 15 minutes or 
requiring inotropic support, not due to a cause other than PE, such a s arrhythmia, hypovolemia, sepsis, 
or left ventricular dysfunction), pulselessness, or persistent profound bradycardia (heart rate <40 bpm 
with signs or symptoms of shock).20, 21 Other prognostic factors include; right ventricle ( RV) dilation, 
hypokinesis, and ischemia/infarction. RV dilation leads to reduced filling of the left ventricle (LV), and an  
increase in short -term mortality is observed with a n RV/LV ratio of greater than 0.9 at computed 
tomography (CT).22-24 There is a 2.4 fold increase in mortality associated with RV dysfunction observed  at 
echocardiography .25 Increase d mortality is also observed with el evated troponin and brain  natriuretic 
peptide s, which  are associated with a four - to eight -fold risk and a six -fold risk, respectively.25-27 
1.3 PULMONARY EMBOLISM TREATMENT & RISK STRATIFICATION  
The treatment of PE depends on its severity. The severity is d efined by [CONTACT_228530]; a risk tightly 
correlated with the hemodynamic consequences of the embolism, namely, acute right ventricular (RV) 
dysfunction. R V dysfunction is the principal determinant of a patient’s clinical course.21, [ADDRESS_275072] been used in the prediction of outcome after PE. One, the Pulmonary Embolism 
Severity Index (PESI), has been well -validated.[ADDRESS_275073] a very low risk of adverse early outcome. Adding the combination of a negative cardiac 
troponin further increases the ne gative predictive value of the scores.31 It should be noted, however, 
that the PESI and sPESI risk stratifications were develop ed as epi[INVESTIGATOR_228474]. The FLAME Protocol will allow enrollment of only high -risk PE that 
would typi[INVESTIGATOR_228475] 50%, and cardiovascular mortality rate 
of nea rly 40%  at 30 days .1-3 
1.4 CLASSIFICATION SCHEMA FOR PULMONARY EMBOLISM  
American Heart Association. The 2011 American Hear t Association (AHA) Scientific Statement on 
Pulmonary Embolism classified PE into three traditional categories utilized in the literature: massive, 
Inari Medical   Version 3.0 
December 6, 2020  
  
 
   
FLAME Study (Protocol 20-001) CONFIDENTIAL  Page 15 of 56 
 submassive, and low -risk.20 The AHA document included definitions for each category. Massive (high -
risk) PE is defined as hypotension with systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg lasting more than 15 minutes 
or requiring ionotropic support, or persistent bradycardia to <[ADDRESS_275074] one of the following is present: RV/LV ratio >0.9, RV systolic dysfunction on 
echocardiography, elevation of BN P >90 pg/mL, elevation on N -terminal pro -BNP >500 pg/mL,  
electrocardiographic changes of new right bundle -branch block, anteroseptal ST elevation or depression, 
or anteroseptal T -wave inversion. Myocardial necrosis is defined by [CONTACT_228531] I >0. 4 mg/mL 
or troponin T >0.1 ng/mL. Low -risk PE is a PE that falls short of the criteria for submassive PE; in other 
words, a PE without RV dysfunction or elevation of biomarkers.  
While these categories correlate roughly with the risk of mortality, the AHA d ocument stresses that 
concurrent comorbidities must be accounted for in the prediction of mortality. For instance, a non - 
massive PE in a patient with preexisting chronic obstructive lung disease or congestive heart failure. That 
said, the short -term morta lity approximates 25 -50% for massive PE, 1% for low -risk PE, and somewhere 
in between for submassive PE.  
European Society of Cardiology. The 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines specified 
combinations of clinical presentation, imaging, biom arkers to better risk -classify patients ( Figure 2).21 
The ESC risk stratification scheme utilizes four criteria to classify PE patients into four grades of mortality 
risk: high, intermediate -high, intermediate -low, and low.

been used to guide treatment decisions in randomized controlled trials.

 dHaemodynamic instabi lity, combined with PE confirmation on CTPA and/or evidence of RV dysfunction on TTE, is sufficient 
to classify a patient into the high -risk PE category.  In these cases, neither calculation of the PESI nor measurement of 
troponins or other cardiac biomarke rs is necessary.  
eSigns of RV dysfunction on TTE (or CTPA) or elevated cardiac biomarker levels may be present, despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a calculated PESI of I-
IIor an sPESI of 0. Until the implications of such discrepancies for the management of PE are fully understood, t hese patients 
should be classified into the intermediate -risk category . 
 
High -risk patients include those with all four criteria positive. These patients present in shock, PESI 
scores III or greater or sPESI scores greater than 0, RV dysfunction on imaging, and positive cardiac 
biomarkers indicative of myocardial necrosis. An intermediate -risk category is defined by [CONTACT_228532], analogous to the submassive category in the literature.26 The intermediate -risk subgroup is 
divided into intermediate high -risk and intermediate low -risk subcategories, depending on whether both 
RV dysfunction and positive cardiac biomarkers are present (intermediate high -risk) or only one of the 
two are present (intermediate low -risk). The last category is the low -risk group and is similar to the AHA 
low-risk category.[ADDRESS_275075] low PESI/sPESI 
scores, and normal imaging or laboratory ass essments when they are performed.  While validation of the 
ESC risk scale has been studied in only one large randomized clinical trial, the scale is one method on 
which to guide treatment options.33 
1.5 RISK-BASED TREATMENT OF PULMONARY EMBOLISM  
High -risk PE is defined when a patient presents with shock from acute right ventricular decompensation. 
Early, definitive treatment is necessary to prevent the rapid, downhill spi[INVESTIGATOR_228477] a 
patient’s demise. Anticoagulation with the removal of the occludi ng pulmonary artery thrombus is 
indicated, either by [CONTACT_228533], pharmacomechanical, or mechanical means. In certain cases, open 
surgical pulmonary embolectomy and even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be 
necessary. Fortunately, high -risk pulmonary embolism occurs in less than 10% of cases.34 
The treatment of high -risk PE patients is clear; definitive intervention is indicated, up to and including

flow, and the patient will remain hemodynamically compromised.5, 33, 44  
 
1.6.2 Pharmacologic Thrombolysis  
While anticoagulation is effective in preventing recurrent PE, it does little to treat existing emboli. 
Treatment of obstructing pulmonary artery thromboembolism attains relevance in patients with 
intermediate -risk (submassive) and high -risk PE, where normalization of right heart function and 
reduction in mortality is im portant. Initially, intravenous, systemic thrombolysis was used for PE. After 
initial anecdotal success with intravenous urokinase for PE reported in 1968 by [CONTACT_228534],47 the landmark 
randomized clinical trials upon which the initial US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for 
urokinase was based demonstrated i mproved outcome with thrombolysis versus anticoagulation for 
intermediate -risk and high -risk PE.48-[ADDRESS_275078] line therapy for acute, high -risk PE. However, recent work 
suggests that even a catheter -directed approach may be associated with significant bleeding 
complications  in the treatment of intermediate and high -risk patients.7,57 A stu dy comparing catheter -
directed thrombolysis to systemic thrombolysis in a group of intermediate and high -risk patients showed 
bleeding was higher in the catheter directed group, while in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228478].57 
1.6.3 Ultrasound -Accelerated Thrombolysis  
After demonstrating the possibilities of more effective thrombolysis using ultrasound to accelera te the 
process, catheter -directed, ultrasound -accelerated thrombolysis (UAT) was studied for intermediate -risk 
and high -risk PE. Two multicenter, prospective studies were completed, ULTIMA and SEATTLE -II. ULTIMA 
was a randomized analysis of UAT vs. anticoa gulation alone in [ADDRESS_275079] to reductions in RV/LV ratio without intracranial 
hemorrhage. This conclusion, however, has not been without controversy. A 2017 review of 23 studies

catheter -directed thrombolysis, 12% with UAT vs. 10% with standard catheter -directed thrombolysis.[ADDRESS_275081] improved survival with UAT; 4% vs. 9%  in the UAT 
and standard thrombolytic subjects, respectively. No device has been identified as superior in the 
treatment of high -risk PE subjects, opening the medical opportunity to augment the non -surgical 
armamentarium in the treatment of high -risk PE . 
1.6.[ADDRESS_275082] to publish the techniq ue in a 1924 report.45 Open surgical thromboembolectomy can result in rapid, 
life-saving hemodynamic improvement in patients with significant PE.35, 46  However, open surgical 
thromboembolectomy is a major invasive procedure, fraught with complications in unstable patients. 
The in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228479] 25%, although this figure must be considered in th e context 
of alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_228480] -risk PE group. No randomized trials have been performed to 
compare the outcome with alternate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_228481]. For these reasons, AHA 
and ESC guidelines suggest that open surgical int ervention be reserved for hemodynamically -unstable 
patients with contraindications to thrombolysis.20, 21  However, selected indications remain appropriate 
for open thromboembolectomy; for example, emboli in transit such as within the right heart or a patent 
foramen ovale. In this regard, the American College of Chest Physicians advocates open surgical  
intervention for patients who are severely compromised such that death is likely to occur before 
thrombolytic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_228482]’s hemodynamic state . 
1.6.[ADDRESS_275083] reported in 1969.61After that, other 
technologies were attempted, including fragmentation of proximal emboli,62, 63 rheolytic 
thrombectomy,64-68 and the use of various pulmonary artery thromboembolectomy devices.69-71 To the 
extent that the percutaneous thromboembolectomy devices removed obstructing thromboembolism 
without the need for thrombolytic therapy, such devices presented the potential for normalization of 
pulmonary arterial flow without the hemorrhagic complications associated with thrombolytic agents. 
This is the rationale for Fl owTriever as i t has the advantage s of a percutaneous procedure, with 
expectation that the bleeding complications of thrombolysis will be minimized .

 2 THE FLOWTRIEVER S YSTEM  
Noting the need for rapid restoration of pulmonary arterial flow after pulmonary embolism , Inari 
developed the FlowTriever Retrieval/Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_228483] (FlowTriever System) to extract pulmonary 
arterial thromboembolism without an obligatory need for thrombolytic agents.72, 73  
The FlowTriever System is indicated for the non -surgical removal of emboli and thrombi from blood 
vessels; the injection, infusion, and/or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_228484] a blood 
vessel. The completion of the  FLARE prospective clinical trial resulted in FDA clearance for the treatment 
of pulmonary embolism.  It is expected that the use of the FlowTriever System will augment 
effectiveness in the treatment of high -risk PE.  Due to the high risk of mortality with  current treatments 
for high -risk PE, with reported in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228485] 17% to 50%, it is 
expected that FlowTriever will also have a safety benefit in this patient group.8, 74 -78. 
2.1 FLOWTRIEVER SYSTEM  
The FlowTriever System will be used in the FlowTriever Arm of this study. The System is a catheter -
based mechanical thrombectomy device for percutaneous endovascular retrieval of emboli and is 
intended for use in the proximal pulmonary arterial system. The FlowTriever System is designed to 
mechanically remove emboli and restore blood flow through the pulmonary arteries in the setting of 
acute pulmonary embolism . 
2.2 REGULATORY STATUS  
The FlowTriever System was cleared for the treatment of pulmonary embolism under 510(k) number 
K180466, May 17, 2018.  
2.3 INTENDED USE OF THE DEVICE  
The FlowTriever System is a Class II device, intended for use in the peripheral vasculature and for the 
treatment of pulmonary embolism.  
2.4 DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
The FlowTriever Retrieval/Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_228486] a single -use over -the-wire catheter -based syste m for the 
minimally invasive treatment of thromboemboli in the peripheral vasculature and the treatment of 
pulmonary embolism. The system is composed of two main components: the Triever Catheter and the 
FlowTriever Catheter.   
The Triever Catheter is a lar ge-bore catheter used primarily for controlled aspi[INVESTIGATOR_228487]. 
After being positioned adjacent to thrombus, a vacuum is applied to the catheter side port via a [ADDRESS_275084] 
thrombus through the Triever catheter and into the syringe, while limiting blood loss to 60 mL per 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  
The FlowTriever Catheter, often delivered into the body through the Triever Catheter, consists of a 
flexible shaft att ached to distal self -expanding nitinol disk(s). It is used to macerate and deliver 
Inari Medical   Version 3.0

FLAME Study (Protocol 20-001) CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20 of 56 
 thrombus to the Triever Catheter for removal via aspi[INVESTIGATOR_228488], wall -
adherent thrombus.  
A complete description of the FlowTriever System is p rovided in the Instructions for Use.    
2.5 RATIONALE  FOR THE USE OF THE FLOWTRIEVER SYSTEM  
The use of thrombectomy for PE offers the opportunity to reduce the pulmonary arterial thrombus 
burden rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] . As well, there are subpopulations where FlowTriever thro mbectomy may be the only 
interventional option; for instance, in patients for whom pharmacologic thrombolysis is contraindicated . 
The effectiveness of the FlowTriever System does not rely on the use of obligatory adjunctive 
pharmacologic therapy. While som e may choose to employ thrombolysis during or after FlowTriever 
thrombectomy, the use of thrombolytic agents is not required.

 3 PRIOR INVESTIGATIONS  
The FlowTriever System  was evaluated  in a US pi[INVESTIGATOR_228489], the 
FlowTriever Clinical Embolectomy Clinical Study (FLARE) study, in subjects with submassive (i.e., 
intermediate -risk) PE. The study was a prospective, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and 
effectiveness of the FlowTriever System in subjects eligible for endovascular treatment of acute PE.    
Following FDA clearance  for the FlowTriever System, a subsequent study (F lowTriever All -Comer 
Registry for Patient Safety and Hemodynamics (FLASH)) was designed and is being conducted  to 
evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the FlowTriever System for use in the removal of emboli from 
the pulmonary arteries in the treatment of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). The use of the device is 
being assessed in a real-world population , and enrollment in the study is ongoing.   
3.1 FLARE  STUDY DESIGN AND SUMMARY OF RESULTS  
3.1.1 FLARE  STUDY DESIGN  
A maximum of 20 study sites were  planned to participate in the study, and no single study site could 
enroll more than 25% of the t otal subjects. The study population comprised 106 subjects with acute 
submassive PE.  
Primary safety and a primary  effectiveness performance goals were used  in the study. For the safety 
Performance Goal, the results from seven studies with acute PE patient s treated with a heparin control 
arm were used to develop a composite MAE rate. MAEs were defined when one or more of the 
following occurred within 48 hours: Device -related death, major bleeding, treatment -related clinical 
deterioration, treatment -related pulmonary vascular injury, or treatment -related cardiac injury. 
Combining these composite MAE rates yielded an estimate of 16% with a 95% confidence interval of 
6.7% to 25.8% after adjusting for heterogeneity among studies. The P erformance Goal was chosen as 
the upper 95% confidence limit rounded down to two digits, for a safety P erformance Goal of 25%.  
The primary effectiveness performance goal was the change in RV/LV ratio from baseline to 48 hours. 
The P erformance Goal was based  on heparin -treated subjec ts from four studies in which heparin was a 
control to an active pharmaceutical drug. Combining these results in a meta -analysis yielded a mean 
change from baseline of 12% with 95% confidence limits of 4% to 21% after adjusting for heterogeneity 
among stud ies, for an effectiveness P erformance Goal of 12%.  
Subjects were followed for [ADDRESS_275085] -procedure with CTPA at 48 hours and assessment of AEs 
through 30 days. The primary safety endpoint was assessed  from the 48-hour  MAE rate and the primary 
effectivene ss endpoint from the change between the baseline and 48 -hour CTPA imaging studies.  
The sample size for effectiveness was computed based on an estimated RV/LV ratio change from 
baseline.  For 80% power to detect an RV/LV ratio greater  than 0.12 using a one -sided alpha = 0.025, the 
sample size needs to be at least 62, 38, or 26 assuming a true  RV/LV ratio of 0.20, 0.225 or 0.25, 
respectively.  
The sample size for safety was based  on the P erformance Goal of 25% for the composite endpoint.  The 
true  composite endp oint rate for the FlowTriever was expected to be about 13%, according to data from 
the historical studies used for the P erformance Goal estimation.  Additionally, rates of 15% and 17% 
Inari Medical   Version 3.0 
December 6, 2020  
  
 
   
FLAME Study (Protocol 20-001) CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 of 56 
 were considered . For 80% power to detect a difference from the expected l ower composite endpoint 
rates of 13%, 15% and 17% compared to the performance goal with a one -sided alpha = 0.05, 70, 103 
and 167 subjects would be needed if the true  rates were 13%, 15%, and 17%, respectively. Since a 
conservative sample size for safety w as calculated to be 103, 103 was used  as the sample size for this 
study, not adjusted for subjects receiving thrombolytics. It was assumed  that approximately 15% of the 
subjects would receive thrombolytics so that 103/0.85=121.2 or up to 122 subjects could be enrolled.  
3.1.2 FLARE  STUDY RESULTS  
The disposition of subjects in the FLAR E trial is depi[INVESTIGATOR_69492] 3. In all, 106 subjects were enrolled  
and treated with the study device; 104 without thrombolytics. Among these, 101 had evaluable CTPA 
studies suitable for the primary effectiveness en dpoint. There were also 101 su bjects that had 48-hour  
data suitable for the primary safety endpoint. The mean baseline RV/LV ratio was 1.5 ± 0.4, and the 
mean 48 -hour RV/LV ratio was 1.2 ± 0.3.  Three subjects had missing values for the primary effectivenes s 
endpoint at the [ADDRESS_275086] - RV/LV ratio for 
comparison.  For these paired subjects, the mean change (reduction) in RV/LV ratio from pre - to post - 
was 0.38 ± 0.3,  with a range from an increase of 0.4 t o a decrease of 1.4. This mean  change in RV/LV 
ratio was 0.3 8 and the p -value < 0.0001, indicating that the null hypothesis was rejected  and the 
FlowTriever System met the performance goal.a 
Figure 3. Disposition of Subjects in the FLARE Trial  
 
For the primary safety endpoint, 4 subjects (3.8%) in the modified intention to treat  population (all 
patients  with treatment attempted and no thrombolytics were administered)  population experienced 
one or more MAEs. The composite endpoint of 3.8% was statistically lower than the performance goal of 
25% (p -value <0.0001), with an upper one -sided 95% confidence limit of 8.6%. The upper one -sided 95% 
confidence limit for the ITT population was 8.4%, which was significantly less than the performance goal 
of 25%.   None of the MAEs reported were device related.  
                                                           
a The p -value is from a one -sided t -test (Wald statistic) from the multiple imputation analysis, testing the null 
hypothesis that the mean change is not greater than the performance goal of 0.12.

 In sum mary , the FLARE trial met its primary safety and effectiveness endpoints. This trial was the basis 
for the US FDA 510( k) clearance of the device in May 2018.  
3.2 FLASH  STUDY DESIGN AND STUDY STATUS  
As described previously, the primary study objective  of FLASH  is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness 
of the FlowTriever System for use in the removal of emboli from the pulmon ary arteries in the 
treatment of acute pulmonary embolism  (PE). The use of the device is being assessed in a real -world 
population, with eligibility criteria that closely approximate its use in clinical practice.  
 
The FLASH Study is a prospective, single -arm, multicenter study of the FlowTriever System for 
intermediate (submassive) and high -risk (massive) PE.  Up to 500 subjects will be enrolled at up to 50 
registry sites in the [LOCATION_002].  Enrollment in the FLASH registry is ongoin g.

 4 FLAME STUDY OBJECTIVE  
The primary objective of this observational study is to  evaluate treatment outcomes of patients 
diagnosed with high -risk ( massive ) pulmonary embolism who have received treatment with the 
FlowTriever System compared to an established performan ce goal (literature -based goal) .   
 
5 FLAME STUDY DESIGN  
The FLAME study is a prospective, multicenter , non -randomized, parallel  group , observational study of 
subjects with high -risk pulmonary embolism concurrently enrolled in the FlowTriever , Context , and Prior 
Therapy  Arm s.  FlowTriever Arm subjects  will be the primary population utilized to evaluate the study 
Primary and Secondary Endpoints for study success.   Subjects enrolled in the Context Arm will be 
analyzed separately from the endpoint analysis util izing descriptive methods . 
Data collection for Prior Therapy Arm subjects will include information surrounding the PE treatment, 
progression to High -Risk PE, and patient course through hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  Safety data will be 
collected, but not CEC adjudic ated or analyzed as outlined for the FlowTriever and Context Arm subjects.  
Subjects receiving prior advanced treatment for low/intermediate -risk PE in the same hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228466] 
a second treatment for high -risk PE likely have a different profile than th ose receiving advanced care for 
the first time after diagnosis of high-risk PE , and therefore should be looked at separately .  In the spi[INVESTIGATOR_228490], data will be collected to ensure 
representation of this smaller yet significant group  of high -risk PE patients.  
   
5.1 ENDPOINTS  
5.1.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228491] -cause mortality, bailout to an

6.1.3 Baseline  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Waiver of Informed Consent  in Emergency Research  
Patients with high -risk pulmonary embolism are, by [CONTACT_108], unstable with a life-threatening condition 
and require emergent treatment.   Currently, patients with high -risk pulmonary embolism suffer from 
30-40% acute mortality  1-3, necessitating the analysis of current treatments for this high -risk patient 
population.  
The FLAME registry study will not dictate use of any specific therapy for the pulmonary embolism.  
Treatment will be at the discretion of the physician caring for the  patient, utilizing standard of care 
treatment, and the data surrounding the treatment decision and pa tient outcomes through hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228499].  
Inari Medical   Version 3.0 
December 6, 2020  
  
 
   
FLAME Study (Protocol 20-001) CONFIDENTIAL  Page 31 of 56 
 Per the Department of Health and Human Services criteria for a waiver of consent in research for non -
FDA regulated studies (45 CFR 46.116(d)) , the FLAME study will include a waiver of consent for the 
following reasons (as listed in the regulation ): 
1. The res earch involves no more than minimal risk to the participants.  
 
The FLAME observational registry will not dictate use of any specific therapy for the pulmonary 
embolism.  Treatment will be at the discretion of the physician caring for the patient , utilizin g all 
available standard of care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_228500] , and the data surrounding the 
treatment decision and patient outcomes through hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228501] , therefore additional risks are not i ntroduced specific to the 
study .   
The only known risk to participants  is the possible loss of confidentiality which has been guarded 
against by [CONTACT_716]:   
• Data surrounding the treatment and patient outcomes through hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228502], re -identified with a study -specific subject ID, and collected for analysis.  
• Only the study site (Investigators and research staff) will have access PHI, pro viding an 
acceptable risk/benefit ratio for data collection and analysis activities performed for the 
study.  
• Access to the study database where anonymized data is entered is password protected 
and compliant with 21 CFR 11 , Electronic Records.  
• Access to stu dy data will be limited to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228503] . 
Evaluating subject  records fits the definition of minimal risk.  
2. The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration .  
 
As noted above, patients in this high -risk population suffer from 30 -40% acute mortality , and 
treatment of these patients would occur regardless of the research.  In order to carry -out 
credible and representative research in this population, all patients presenting with high -risk 
pulmonary emb olism should be included in the results, including those who expi[INVESTIGATOR_228504].  This research could not be practicably carried out 
without the waiver of consent to ensure proper accounting for patient mortality.    
 
This study is a non -interventional, data collection registry .  As described above, patients with 
high -risk pulmonary embolism are, by [CONTACT_108], unstable with a life -threatening condition 
requiring emergent treatment.  Patients with high -risk pulmonary embolism are unable to 
consent for data collection due to their medical condition.  There is no reasonable way to 
prospectively identify potential eligible subjects  and the d ata surrounding the treatment 
decision and patient outcomes will be coll ected in the FLAME registry via retrospective chart 
review by [CONTACT_228540] . 
 
3. If the research involves using identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, the 
research could not practicably be carried out without using such information or biospecimens 
in an identifiable format;  
 
Inari Medical   Version 3.0 
December 6, 2020  
  
 
   
FLAME Study (Protocol 20-001) CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_275095] ID, and collected for analysis.  Only the 
study site (Investigators and research staff) will have access PHI, providing an acceptable 
risk/benefit ratio for data collection and analysis activities performed for the FLAME study . 
 
4. The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the participants.  
 
As the study is collecting de-identified real-world treatment data  after the patients have already 
left the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , and  the study is  not prescribing the intervention or therapy, the FLAME study 
will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the participants.  
 
5. Whenever appropriate, the participants will be provided with additional pertinent 
information after participation.  
 
This study is non -interventional and thus providing information to patients is not likely. 
However, if there were information that needed to be provided to the subject,  we would work 
with the IRB to approve the correspondence to be provided to the subject.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Eligibility  
Subject s will be enrolled by [CONTACT_227490].  This is especially important for subject s enrolled 
in the Context and Prior Therapy Arm s, to help eliminate the potential for enrollment bias.   Once a site is 
activated to enroll in the FL AME study, ALL patients presenting with suspected PE should be  assessed for 
high -risk PE status, and potential enrollment  into the FLAME study.  
All inclusion criteria must be met, and none of the exclusion criteria can be met for enrollment into the 
study  (for all arms) .  All eligibility criteria are listed in Section 5.4.  Subjects will be considered enrolled 
when the Primary Treatment for thrombus r emoval is initiated  for high -risk PE (the time of enrollment 
for patients in the Prior Therapy Arm will be the time of high -risk PE diagnosis).      
Patients not meeting eligibility criteria for the study will be considered Screen Failures, will not be 
enrolled , and are not entered into the EDC system.  
6.1.4 Treatment  
The treating physician should document  what the intended initial treatment strategy was  for high -risk 
PE (referred to as the Primary Treatment) .  Subject s with the Primary Treatment being FlowTriever will 
be enrolled into the FlowTriever Arm of the study.  Subject s with the Primary Treatment being non-
FlowTriever therapy will be enrolled into the Context Arm of the study.   Subjects presenting with 
low/intermediate -risk PE who receive advanced therapy but subsequently progress to high -risk PE in the 
same hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]/admission should be enrolled in the Prior Therapy Arm.   
Details of the treatment of PE (Primary Treatme nt, Bailout measures, Clinical Deterioration , and Major 
Bleeding ) will be collected . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Bailout  to an Alternate Thrombus Removal Strategy  
Inari Medical   Version 3.0 
December 6, 2020  
  
 
   
FLAME Study (Protocol 20-001) CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_275096]  requires additional thrombus removal therapy other 
than the Primary  Treatment initiated , the additional therapy should be documented.  The Clinical Events 
Committee (CEC, Section 6.3), will determine  if the additional  therapy meets the definition of Bailout  for 
the purposes of analyzing the Primary Endpoint of the study.  Definitions for Bailout are provided i n 
Table 4 below:  
Table 4:  Bailout Definitions  
Initial Treatment 
Strategy /Primary 
Treatment : Bailout  to an Alternate Thrombus Removal Strategy Definition1: 
Thrombolysis  
(systemic or 
catheter directed)  A bailout would be defined as the need for mechanical circulatory support or a 
different thrombus removal strategy at any time after the  initial thrombolytic 
strategy was initiated. Applies when t hrombolytic therapy alone w as 
the original  treatment plan ( conceived  beforehand) .  Note:  if catheter 
directed thrombolysis (CDT) was the original treatment plan and 
emergent/clinically driven  systemic thrombolytic administration (≥ 10 mg tPA 
or 5 mg TNK) was required after CDT was initiated, this would be considered a 
bailout. (Note:  If the length of tPA or TNK administration is simply extended 
and is not emergent or clinically driven, this would not necessarily qualify as a 
bailout).  
Anticoagulation  
(includes 
anticoagulation + 
ECMO)  A bailout would be defined as the need for thrombolytic therapy, mechanical 
circulatory support  (if this was not part of the planned primary treatment) , or 
a different thrombus removal strategy (for example, mechanical 
thrombectomy, open embolectomy , etc. ) at any time after the initial 
anticoagulation strategy was initiated. Anticoagulation alone was the 
original  treatment plan ( conceived  beforehand).  
Surgical 
Thrombectomy  A bailout would be defined as the need for a diff erent thrombus removal 
strategy or the addition of mechanical circulatory support once a surgical 
approach was initiated. Surgical thrombectomy alone was the 
original  treatment plan ( conceived  beforehand) . 
Mechanical  
Thrombectomy  
(Includes 
FlowTriever and 
non-FlowTriever  
thrombectomy ) A bailout would be defined as the need for a different thrombus removal 
strategy , the addition of mechanical circulatory support , or surgical 
thrombectomy  once a percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy ap proach was 
initiated. Low-dose catheter directed adjunctive  thrombolytic therapy (less 
than 10 mg tPA or 5 mg TNK) that is administered intra -procedurally or post -
procedurally will be discouraged but not considered a bailout.   
Note:   
• Completion of the FlowTriever procedure will be defined as the final 
removal of the FlowTriever catheter from the patient . 
• If mechanical circulatory support was placed before mechanical 
thrombectomy was initiated as part of the planned treatment 
strategy, this is not consid ered a bailout .  If, however; mechanical 
Inari Medical   Version 3.0

FLAME Study (Protocol 20-001) CONFIDENTIAL  Page 34 of 56 
 circulatory support was not planned as part of the initial thrombus 
treatment strategy, and mechanical thrombectomy  is initiated but 
mechanical circulatory support later becomes necessary, this will be 
recorded as a  bailout.  
1Bailout measures will be reviewed and adjudicated by [CONTACT_228541] . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Deterioration  
Subject clinical status will be monitored and recorded in the study records.  Signs of clinical 
deterioration observed  from the time of initiation of the Primary Treatment for high -risk PE through 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228505] (CEC, 
Section 6.3), and is  defined in Table 5 below . 
Table 5:  Clinical Deterioration Definition  
Clinical Deterioration1, defined as:  
• Need for CPR  after primary treatment initiation , or 
• Need to start IV vasopresso rs to keep systolic blood pressure  > 90 mmHg in a 
previously normotensive patient  after primary treatment initiation , or 
• Need for mechanical ventilation  after primary treatment initiation  in a 
previously spontaneously breathing patient , or 
• Need for noninva sive positive pressure ventilation after primary treatment 
initiation in a patient previously on nasal cannula

[IP_ADDRESS]  Major Bleeding  
All bleeding events related to the patient’s high -risk pulmonary embolism or its treatment should be 
recorded as adverse events  by [CONTACT_8979] .  The CEC will review and adjudicate bleeding events  for the 
purposes of analyzing the primary endpoint.  Bleeding events which meet the BARC 3b /3c/5a/5b  
definition of Major Bleeding will be included in the Primary Endpoint analysis.  The BARC 3b /3c/5a/5b  
Major Bleeding Definition is provided in Table 6 below:   
Table 6:  Major Bleeding, BARC 3b /3c/5a/5b  Definition  
Major Bleeding (BARC 3b /3c/5a/5b )1, defined as:  
• 3b:  Overt bleeding plus hemoglobin drop of ≥ 5 g/dL (provided hemoglobin 
drop is related to bleed); cardiac tamponade, bleeding requiring surgical 
intervention for control (excluding dental/nasal/skin/hemorrhoid); bleeding 
requiring intravenous vasoactive agents

6.2 SAFETY DATA HANDLING AND REPORTING  
6.2.1 Adverse Event Definition  and Assessment  
An Adverse Event (AE) is an untoward medical occurrence or exacerbation of an existing medical 
condition subsequent to  enrollment in the study. AEs are assessed for severity, seriousness , and 
relationship to treatment  devices and procedures, as defined in Table 7.  
The study will only capture AEs related to the subject’s PE condition and treatment. Reportable AEs 
include all e vents considered in the safety analyses, all thrombus removal therapy/device - and/or  
procedure -related AEs, as well as events resulting in death.    
Table 7: Site Assessment of Adverse Events  
AE Assessment  Categories and Definitions  
Severity : Mild:  No limitation of usual activities, no therapy or only symptomatic therapy 
required to treat the injury or illness  
Inari Medical   Version 3.0 
December 6, 2020  
  
 
   
FLAME Study (Protocol 20-001) CONFIDENTIAL  Page 36 of 56 
 Moderate:  Some limitation of usual activities or specific therapy is required  
Severe:  Inability to carry out usual activities, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], emergency treatment, 
life threatening events, or death  
Seriousness : Serious Adverse Event (SAE) :  An AE which is at least one of the following:  
• Is fatal  
• Is life -threatening  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage 
to a body structure  
• Results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9613] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent 
impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure  
Relatedness (assessed 
for any thrombus 
removal strategy or 
procedure) : Not R elated:   The clinical event is completely  independent of thrombus removal 
therapy or procedure  and/or  evidence exists that the event is related to another 
etiology.  
Related:  The clinical event occurs in a plausible time relationship to the thrombus 
removal ther apy or procedure  and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_228544] . 
Unknown:  The relationship to the thrombus removal therapy or procedure  is not 
known.  
 
6.2.2 Site Reporting of Adverse Events  
The study was designed to capture real world data regarding the clinical use of the FlowTriever System 
and other high -risk PE treatments .  The study follows guidelines for Instructions for Use and physician 
discretion for PE treatment.   
This is a data coll ection study only; there is nothing investigational or experimental in the subject’s 
medical treatment  and the subject  will be treated per standard of care . Therefore, the study will only 
capture AEs related to the subject’s PE condition and treatment.   Reportable AEs include all e vents 
considered in the safety analyses, all thrombus removal therapy /device - and/or  procedure -related AEs, 
as well as events resulting in death. The AEs will be captured on the AE CRF and should include, 
wherever possible, severity, duration, outcome, the Investigator’s description the event, and its 
relationship to the thrombus removal therapy /device , to the thrombus removal procedure or any 
subsequent procedures, or to a thrombolytic agent or anticoagulant.  
• Non -serious reportable AEs are to be submitted  via the electronic data capture system (EDC) in 
a timely fashion.  
• Reportable SAEs mu st be reported  to the Sponsor within 5 business days of the Investigator’s 
knowledge of the event. The event is reported  in the EDC.

6.10   DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT  
The Sponsor and/or  designee will be responsible for the processing and quality control of the data. All 
source data, eCRFs, copi[INVESTIGATOR_228508], correspondence, and other essential 
documents must be retained  for a period of  at least [ADDRESS_275103] be given  to the Sponsor.  
6.10.1  Site Data Collection and Electronic Data Capture (EDC)  
The Inve stigator may  keep a separate subject identification list showing enrollment numbers, names, 
and dates of birth to provide a local key for unambiguous identification of each subject included in the 
study.   This list will not be collected by [CONTACT_1034].  It is recommended a note be made  in the subject’s 
medical record that the subject is participating in the study.  
Clinical study data will be collected using source document worksheets and eCRFs. A web -based 
electronic data capture system (EDC) will be used to record and manage study data. All eCRFs must be 
kept in good order and updated so they always reflect the latest observations on the subjects 
participating in the study.  
The Investigat or will sign the appropriate eCRF pages and source documentation. Pertinent eCRF 
corrections will be made electronically and signed electronically by [CONTACT_737]. An embedded audit 
trail will capture the date, time and user making entries and changes to the electronic data.  
Because it is important  to have proper data collection in a timely manner, it is recommended that the 
Investigator or designee complete eCRFs within 5 business days of data availability. When the monitor 
or designee requests additio nal data or clarification of data for the eCRF (queries), the request must be 
answered satisfactorily as soon as possible . 
6.10.2  Data Security and Integrity  
The Sponsor, auditors, and health authority inspectors (or their agents) will be given  access to source 
data and documentation (e.g., medical charts/records, laboratory test results, printouts, videotapes, 
etc.) for source data verification, provided that subject confidentiality is maintained  in accordance with  
local requirements.  
The Investigator must mainta in the primary  records (source documents) of each subject’s data. 
Examples of source documents are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], office visit records, examining physician’s finding or 
notes, consultant’s  written opi[INVESTIGATOR_72447], laboratory reports, device label recor ds, and worksheets  
that are used  as the source.

7.3 ANALYTIC DATASETS  
The CDISC process would be implemented to generate analytical datasets similar to the Analysis Data  
Model (ADaM) to be used for tables, lists, and figures (TLFs).  
7.4 ENDPOINT ANALYSIS  
7.4.1 PRIMARY ENDPOINT ANALYSIS  
The primary endpoint is the in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228491] -cause mortality, bailout to an 
alternative thrombus removal strategy, clinical det erioration, and m ajor bleeding (BARC 3b /3c/5a/5b  
definition ) from the FlowTriever Arm. The rate of the composite endpoint is expected to be 18% and 
compared with performance goal of 32%:  
H0:  P S ≥ Performance Goal S versus H A: PS < Performance Goal S 
where P s is the proportion of subjects with  in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228510] P erformance Goal S is the  
performance goal of proportion of subjects with in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228511]-FlowTriever treatments . 
The one -sided binomial’s proportion test with normal approximation would be used at a one -sided α = 
0.05. Primary endpoint analysis can be carried out at interim analysis and/or final analysis stage.  
7.4.2 SECONDARY ENDPOINT ANALYSIS  
Secondary Endpoints include both Secondary Safety Endpoints and Utility Measures  as listed below:  
Secondary Safety Endpoints  
• Frequency of each primary endpoint composite component  
• Frequency of Stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic)  
• Frequency of d evice -related complications  
• Access site injury  requiring intervention , both venous and arterial  
 
Utility Measures  
• Length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• Length of ICU stay 
• Use of ECMO, including either pre - or post -treatment initiation and duration  
• Time to extubation, if intubated  
• Discharge location  
 
Descriptive statistics will be used for secondary endpoints  for both the FlowTriever Arm and Context 
Arm populations . Continuous variable will report min, max, mean, SD, IQR, Q1, Q3 etc. as deemed 
appropriate. Categorical variable will report frequency counts and percentage. Time -to-event variable 
may be reported with Kaplan -Meier and/or Cox proportional hazards model e stimates.  
Additional exploratory analyses on secondary endpoints may include confounder adjustment in 
generalized linear models (GLMs).

FLAME Study (Protocol 20-001) CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43 of 56 
 7.4.3 INTERIM ANALYSIS  
The interim analysis population will be N = 50 enrolled subjects in the FlowTriever Arm with adjudica ted 
in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228512]. Primary endpoint analysis method in Section 7.4.1  will be used on the 
interim analysis population to decide whethe r the study should be stopped early due to achieving early 
decision rule based on the primary endpoint. The |𝑧−𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒| threshold is 2.031, which translates to in -
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228513] ≤ 0.186. Therefore, having ≤ 9 in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228514] N = 50 may qualify for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_228515] g oal = 32% (see Table 9). 
Secondary endpoint analysis may be conducted in a descriptive fashion without hypothesis testing, 
therefore not spending any Type I error ( α).   
7.4.4 CONTEXT ARM ANALYSIS  
The Context Arm may be a nalyzed with methods mentioned in primary and secondary endpoint 
analyses along with descriptive statistics  and will not be used to determine study success . 
7.4.5 PRIOR THERAPY ARM ANALYSIS  
Data collection for Prior Therapy Arm subjects will include information surrounding the PE treatment, 
progression to High -Risk PE, and patient course through hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  Safety data will also be 
collected, but not CEC adjudicated or analyzed as ou tlined for the FlowTriever and Context Arm subjects.  
Subjects receiving prior advanced treatment for low/intermediate -risk PE in the same hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228466] 
a second treatment for high -risk PE likely have a different profile than those receiving advanced  care for 
the first time after diagnosis of high -risk PE, and therefore should be looked at separately.  In the spi[INVESTIGATOR_228490], data will be collected to ensure 
representation of this smaller yet si gnificant group of high -risk PE patients  and will be reported in a 
descriptive manner

Table 10 contains categories, terms , and definitions that are utilized throughout the study and for 
reporting purposes.  
Table 10:  Terms and Definitions  
Term or Phrase  Definition  
Access site injury 
requiring 
intervention, 
both venous and 
arterial  An injury to an access site (both venous and arterial) utilized for treatment of PE which 
requires intervention in order to resolve.   This includes for example, an arterial injury 
associated with ECMO support as part of PE treatment.  
Advanced 
therapy for PE  For the purposes of this study, advanced therapy for low/intermediate - risk PE is considered 
therapy beyond anticoagulation alone, including: thrombolysis (either systemic or catheter 
directed), surgical thrombectomy, and percutaneous thrombectomy.  
Adverse event 
(AE) An Adverse Event (AE) is an untoward medical occurrence or exacerbation of an existing 
medical condition subsequent to  enrollment in the study. AEs are assessed for severity, 
seriousness, and relationship to thrombus removal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/devices/procedures . 
 
The study will only capture AEs related to the subject’s PE condition and treatment. 
Reportable AEs include all events considered in the safety analyses, all thrombus removal 
therapy/device - and/or  procedure -related AEs, as well as events resulting in death.   
All-cause 
mortality  Mortality for any reason, does not need to be related to a device, treatment, or pulmonary 
embolism.  
Bailout to an 
alternative 
thrombus 
removal strategy  New n eed for mechanical circulatory support or another thrombus removal strategy after the 
Primary Treatment strategy was initiated. The additional treatment strategy was not an a 
priori part of the original treatment plan (conceived beforehand).  All bailout e vents will be 
adjudicated by [CONTACT_15741].  See Table 4 for more guidance on bailout events.  
Clinical 
Deterioration  Clinical deterioration is defined as:  
• Need for CPR  
• Need to start IV vasopressors to keep systolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg in a 
previously normotensive patient  
• Need for mechanical ventilation in a previously spontaneously breathing patient  
• Need for noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in a patient previously on nasal 
cannula  
Clinical deterioration occurring after initiation of the Primary Treatment therapy will be 
adjudicated by [CONTACT_228550].  
Context Arm  Context Arm subjects are defined as those subjects with PE who are treated with non -
FlowTriever therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (as the Primary Treatment for PE). Context -Arm therapi[INVESTIGATOR_228516]; thrombolysis (either systemic or catheter directed), anti coagulation, 
surgical thrombectomy, and non -FlowTriever thrombectomy.  
Endpoints will be evaluated in the Context Arm population in a descriptive manner and will 
not be used to determine study success.

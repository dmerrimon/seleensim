Protocol version number  and date:     Ver1, 10/15/2020  
 
Research Question and Aims  
 
Hypothesis : CGM (continuous glucose monitor) used in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374295] -19 will be as 
accurate as POC (point of care) glucose monitors . Provider acknowledgement  CGM alarms of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_374296]. If CGMs are found to be accurate, then their 
information can be used to monitor glucose level, and POC glucometer check  frequency can be safely decreased 
to limit staff exposure to COVID19 patients  and to decrease the use of personal protective equipm ent.  
 
Aims, purpose , or objectives:  
1. To determine if CGMs worn in the non-ICU hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374297] a diagnosis of COVID -[ADDRESS_468629] adequate accuracy for blood glucose monitoring when compared to point -of-care capi[INVESTIGATOR_374298].  
2. To determine if CGM use will decrease the frequency of POC (point of care) glucometer checks done in 
patients with COVID -19 diagnosis.  
3. To determine if alerts given by [CONTACT_374317]19 would prevent epi[INVESTIGATOR_374299].  
 
Background : 
 
Diabetes Mellitus (DM) affects approximately 34.2 million (10.5%) Americans. Hyperglycemia and 
hypoglycemia in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374300], including 
higher rates of sepsis, deconditioning, mortality and lo nger hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. Untreated hypoglycemia may lead to 
neurological damage, cognitive decline, seizures and coma. Additionally, the management of the diabetic 
complications doubles the inpatient cost per capi[INVESTIGATOR_374301] -diabetic patients.  
 Currentl y, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374302]. This approach however only 
provides limited  glucose measurement s throughout the day  and f ails to detect nocturnal or asymptomatic 
hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], all of which are common insulin therapy complications.  Continuous 
Glucose Monitor s (CGM), a newly introduced technology, represent  an alternative to this standard of care, with 
the potential to assist making pe rsonalized therapy decisions. CGMs measure  and record levels of subcutaneous 
interstitial glucose every [ADDRESS_468630] ate [IRB [ZIP_CODE].0 10]  Effective: 9/20/[ADDRESS_468631] with the patient and nurse presence in the room. Depending on frequency of glucose 
monitoring this presence ranges from 4 times per day to every hour  if patients are receiving therapy with IV 
insulin . Patients with COVID -19 require modified airborne isolation and nursing staff has to  use PPE when 
entering patients’  rooms.    
 A few pi[INVESTIGATOR_374303]19 with the aim of reducing 
hypo and hyperglycemia epi[INVESTIGATOR_374304].   
 Manufacturers (DEXCOM and AB BOTT) are providing CGM sensors and readers to be used in 
COVID19 patients with the aim of decreasing the use of health care r esources (PPEs) and health care providers’ 
effort during the pandemic. Even if these sensors are not approved by [CONTACT_374318], FDA 
has allowed manufacturers to provide these devices to be used in COVID19 patients “to allow hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] s taff to 
remotely monitor glucose in patients  to reduce patient interaction, limiting viral exposure by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_374305].”  
With this study we aim to determine if CGMs are as accurate as POC glucometers, if CGM alerts can 
reduce epi[INVESTIGATOR_374306] , and if by [CONTACT_374319] -sticks and nurse exposure to COVID19 patients.  
 
Study Design and Methods  
 
Methods :   
All patients admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374307] a diagnosis of COVID -[ADDRESS_468632] scans (s ensor can be covered by a lead shield  if needed).  A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374308].   
Diabetes educators and Endocrinology ARNPs will be available to help with the following tasks. The CGM 
information will be en tered into receiver phone and iP ad tablet present at nursing station. The receiver phone 
will be placed outside patient room in nursing alcove. Here it will remain available for staff to use and to 
respond to CGM alarms . Alarm limits for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia will be set on the receiver phone 
Minimal Risk Protocol Templ ate [IRB [ZIP_CODE].0 10]  Effective: 9/20/2017  
 
       Page 3 of 10 
 and on the iP ad tablet at the nursing station.  These alarms settings will vary depending on whether the patient is 
on IV insulin infusion vs. subcutaneous (SQ) insulin . The number of glucose checks required with these two 
types of insulin varies significantly and requires separa te handling as detailed  below . 
Two flow -sheet protocols will be made available to nursing staff with instructions on data collection and 
insulin management : one for IV insulin infusion and one for SQ insulin.  Nursing staff will choose the 
appropriate proto col at the time of CGM  placement  based on the type of insulin the patient is receiving. If the 
patient is transitioned from IV insulin to SQ insulin during the course of the study, the research team will be 
contact[CONTACT_374320]. 
CGM presence will be recorded by [CONTACT_374321] (lines, drains, airway) section. CGM 
state will be monitored daily by [CONTACT_374322] (skin lesions, pain, 
sensor and adhesive breakdown ) will be re corded in patient’s chart. Nurses will be asked to report these changes 
to research team. Research team will survey these recording s daily and evaluate the patients and confirm these 
side effects. Should these local skin reactions meet criteria for discont inuation then the sensor will be removed 
and patient participation in research will be terminated.  
After placemen t, CGMs will enter the “warm up phase” for 2 hours. During this period no CGM data will 
be displayed  and nursing staff will continue BG monito ring using Point of Care (POC) glucometer per orders . 
Once warm up is completed , CGMs will transmit data every [ADDRESS_468633] CGM values in patient chart.  
The use of CGMs w ill be divided in 2 phases – “Adjustment Phase” and “Utilization Phase”.  The 
instructions for these phases will differ for patients on IV insulin infusion vs. SQ insulin infusion and are 
described in detail below.  
 
 
For patients receiving subcutaneous (SQ ) Insulin:  
 Adjustment Phase  
During the first [ADDRESS_468634] their 
blood glucose checked with POC glucometer concomitant with CGM use. CGM readings will be 
recorde d in chart at the same time as POC glucometer reading is obtained . The glucometer 
readings and CGM data at the time of glucometer re adings will be compared by [CONTACT_75462]. 
The CGM readings should not be either 15% higher or 15% lower that the corresponding POC 
glucometer reading . Should this CGM reading fall outside this range, a second reading will be 
done within [ADDRESS_468635] ate [IRB [ZIP_CODE].0 10]  Effective: 9/20/2017

 administration, nursing staff will manually enter the CGM readings obtained at the time of 
insulin administration into the chart under the “comments” on the MAR screen.  
If 4 comparison points – CGM readings and POC glucometer reading – are deemed accurate 
(within +/ - 15% of each other for all 4 readings) , then patient will enter the “Utilization Phase”.  
Utilization Phase  
During this phase, once the research team has confirmed CGM accuracy,  POC glucometer AND 
CMG readings will be used to make decisions about insulin dosing and administration. The use 
of POC glucometer will be decreased as follows:  
1. POC glucometer checks will be reduced from 4 times per day (qAC and QHS) to twice per 
day before  breakfast and at bedtime ( qAM and q HS) 
2. Subcutaneous insulin dose for breakfast and bedtime will be determined based on POC 
readings  
3. Subcutaneous insulin dose for lunch and dinner will be determined based on CGM readings  
4. Nursing staff will continue to record CGM readings at the time of every  insulin 
administration in the chart under the “comments” section on the MAR  
5. Nursing staff will compare AM and HS ( before breakfast and at bedtime ) POC glucometer 
reading to concomitant CGM reading to ensure readings remain accurate (within +/ - 15% of 
each other). If CGM readings will fall outside this range, nursing will contact [CONTACT_374323]. The research team will recommend eit her to retest the accuracy of the 
sensor with POC glucometer, or to exchange the CGM sensor and then test the accuracy  
The CGM will be set up with alarm limits of 85 for low glucose and 250 for high glucose. If 
these alarms are triggered, the nursing staff will take measures for these alarms as listed below.  
Treatment decisions will be made based on the POC glucometer reading as follows:  
▪ For hypoglycemia alarm (BG<85 mg/dl ), POC glucometer will be used to confirm the 
glucose leve l. Measures will be taken to prevent or treat hypoglycemia.  
o If BG is 70 -85mg/dl, patient will receive 15 gm of carbohydrates PO ASAP and 
blood glucose will be re -checked in 30 minutes.  
o If BG is <70, hypoglycemia protocol will be initiated. IV D50 pushes or IM glucagon 
will be used if patient is obtunded and unable to swallow.  
POC glucose will be re -checked in 15 -30 minutes to ensure appropriate  correction of 
hypoglycemia.  
▪ For hyperglycemia (sustained BG>250) for more than [ADDRESS_468636] primary provider or inpatient endocrinology team for insulin dosing 
recommendations. POC glucose check will be obtained based on provider recommendations. 
Additional insulin will not be given between meals regardless of sensor reading unless 
otherwise recommended by [CONTACT_374324]. Close attention wil l be 
given to avoid “insulin stacking phenomenon” and potential hypoglycemic events.

 For patients receiving IV Insulin  infusion : 
Please note that during the entirety of the study while the patient is receiving IV insulin, the 
insulin infusion  dose will only be adjusted using the POC BG readings . CGM data will only be 
used to monitor BG range and if BG is found to be outside of expected range, the POC glucose 
will be checked and insulin infusion will be adjusted based on the POC glucometer reading.  
Adjustm ent Phase  
In the “Adjustment Phase”, d uring the first [ADDRESS_468637] their blood glucose  (BG)  checked with POC glucometer concomitant with 
CGM use. Nursing staff will check  POC  BG every [ADDRESS_468638] 12 hours  (as per 
established IV insulin infusion protocol) . CGM readings will be recorded in chart at the same 
time as POC glucometer reading is obtained. These readings will be entered by [CONTACT_374325] “comments” s ection of the MAR screen. The glucometer readings and CGM data at the 
time of glucometer readings will be compared by [CONTACT_75462]. The CGM readings should not be 
either 15% higher or 15% lower that the corresponding POC glucometer reading. Should this 
CGM reading fall outside this range, a second reading will be done within [ADDRESS_468639] 
CGM values, the research team will be notified to determine if the frequency of POC checks can 
be safely decreased based on CGM accuracy.  
If 12 comparison points – CGM readings and POC glucometer reading – are deemed accurate 
(within +/ - 15% of each other for all 12 readings), then patient will enter the “Utilization Phase”.  
If 2 or more consecutive CGM readings do not correlate with POC glucometer values,  the 
research team will be notified. The research team will evaluate the data and decide if the sensor 
should be replaced and another 12-hour cycle of adjustment phase re -initiated or if patient 
participation should be terminated.   
Utilization Phase  
Once CGM accuracy has been established in the “Adjustment Phase” above, the frequency of 
POC glucose checks will be reduced as follows:  
1. POC glucom eter checks will be reduced to every 2 hours  
2. CGM readings will continue to be recorded hourly by [CONTACT_75462] .  
a. If CGM glucose remains in range (140 -180 m g/dl), the same insulin infusion rate will 
be continued . 
b. If CGM glucose is out of range (<140 or >180) then nursing staff will resume POC 
glucose check every [ADDRESS_468640] ate [IRB [ZIP_CODE].0 10]  Effective: 9/20/2017  
 
       Page 6 of 10 
 5. If the patient is transitioned from IV insulin infusion to SQ insulin, the nursing staff will 
notify the research staff and will proceed to the SQ insulin protocol above.  The alarms will 
be adjusted as described in the SQ insulin protocol.  
The CGM will be set up with alarm limits of Low Glucose ( <140 mg/dl), Urgent Low Glucose 
(<70) and High Glucose (>180) . If these alarms are triggered, the nursing staff will perform a 
STAT POC glucose check to confirm blood glucose (BG) level. Treatment decisions will be 
made based on the POC glucometer reading as follows:  
▪ For hypoglycemia:  
o If POC BG is between 85-140 mg/dl , hold IV insulin infusion and re -check POC 
glucose in 30 minutes  
o If POC BG is between 70-84 mg/dl , hold IV insulin and  ask patient to take 15gm of 
carbohydrates PO ASAP and recheck POC glucose level in 30 min utes 
o If POC BG is < 70, apply hypoglycemia protocol. Hold IV insulin. Give IV D50 or 
IM glucagon to obtu nded patients. Give PO carbohydrates to alert, able to swallow 
patients. Repeat POC glucose level in 15 min. and 30 min.  
o Continue to check POC blood glucose  every 1 hour until glucose remains in range 
(140-180 mg/dl) for 2 consecutive readings.  
o Once BG re mains within range for 2 consecutive POC glucometer readings, POC 
glucose checks will be decreased to every 2 hours  
▪ For hyperglycemia  (BG>180) : 
o Check glucose level using POC glucometer and adjust IV insulin infusion rate 
accordingly  
o Continue checking POC g lucose every 1 hour until glucose remains in range (140 -
180 mg/dl) for 2 consecutive readings  
o Once BG remains within range for 2 consecutive POC glucometer readings, POC 
glucose checks will be decreased to every 2 hours  
 
 
Methods (continued):

treatment and back to PO medications during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374309].  
CGM data will be compared with POC blood glucose monitoring obtained in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Different patient 
variables (demographics, comorbidities, labs and vitals, administered medications) will be collected from 
electronic hea lth record and will be evaluated to determine if they would interfere with CGM readings. The 
accuracy of CGM for glucose measurement in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374310].  
At the time of discharge or after discharge patients will be contact[CONTACT_374326] m and administered a

Data Analysis  
 
Power Statement :   
This a pi[INVESTIGATOR_374315] a subsequent 
more extensive implementation and studying of this device will be warranted.  
 
Data Analysis Plan:  
 
Data will be described as percentages or means.  Pearson χ2 and Kruskal Wallis tests will be used to compare 
categorical and continuous variables respectively. Odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals and p -values will be 
reported for each model. All tests of significance will be 2 -sided and the level of s tatistical significance will be 
set at p -value < 0.05.  
 
Mean Absolute Relative Differences will be calculated between matched pairs of POC monitors and the closest 
CGM reading (within 5 minutes of POC). Additionally, level of agreement between the two devi ces will be 
examined with Bland -Altman plots, with particular attention focused on detection agreement in range (70 -180 
g/dl). Poisson or negative binomial regression will be utilized to assess count variables such as number of 
alarms, nurse notification, and hypo or hyperglycemia events adjusting for patient characteristics. Finally, 
longitudinal analysis will be conducted to determine differences associated with medications, clinical 
parameters or diagnosis. Analysis will seek to define if there are any d ifferences between CGM and POC 
measurement based on these changes.

2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study Agent(s) 
2.1.1 Everolimus  
 
Everoli mus, a novel  oral derivative  of rapamycin, has been  in clinical  develop ment since  
1996 as an  immunosup pressant  in solid  organ  transplantation  and has obtained  marketing 
authorization  (Certican®)  for prop hylaxis  of rejection  in renal and cardiac trans plantation in 
a number of countries,  including  the majority  of the  European  Union. Everoli mus has been  in 
develop ment for patients  with various  malignancies  since  2002. Everoli mus was FDA 
approved  in 2009 (Afinitor®)  for the treatment of kidney  cancer  that has progressed after 
suniti nib or sora fenib.  Everoli mus is being  investigated  as an  anticancer  agent based  on its 
potential  to act: 
 
• Directly  on the  tumor cells by [CONTACT_407160]  
• Indirectly  by [CONTACT_407161]  (via potent 
inhibition  of tumor cell HIF-1 activity,  VEGF  production  and VEGF -induced  proliferation 
of endothelial  cells).  The role of angiogenesis  in the maintenance  of solid  tumor growth is 
well established,  and the mTOR  pathway  has b een implicated  in the regulation  of tumor 
production  of proangiogenic  factors  as well  as modulation  of VEGFR signaling  in 
endothelial  cells.  
 
At weekly  and daily  schedules  and at various doses explored,  RAD0001  is generally  well 
tolerated.  The most frequent  adverse events  (rash,  mucositis,  fatigue  and headach e) 
associ ated with everolimus  therapy  are manageable.  Non-infectious  pneumonitis  has been 
reported  with mTOR  inhibitors  but is commonly  low-grade  and reversible.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] mTOR path way and mechanism of action  
 
At cell ular and molecul ar level everolimus acts as a signal transduction  inhibitor. 
Everoli mus selectively  inhibits  mTOR  (mammalian  target  of rapa mycin),  a key and a 
highly  conserved  serine -threonine  kinase, which  is prese nt in all cells and is a central 
regulator  of protein  synthesis  and ultimately  cell grow th, cell  proliferation,  angiogenesis 
and cell survival. mTOR  is the only currently  known target  of eve rolimus (Reviewed  in 
Boulay  and Lane,  2007 )1. mTOR is downstream  of PI3K/AKT pathway,  a pathway  
Everolimus -Pazopanib Phase I  
v. 11/3/16 
- 8 -  
  
 
known to  be dysregulated  in a wide  spectrum  of hu man cancers  (e.g. through 
loss/mutation  of the  PTEN negative  regulator;  through  PI3K mut ation/amplification;  
through  AKT/PKB overexpression/overactivation;  through  modulation  of TSC1/TSC2 
tumor suppressor s). In addition,  activ ation of the  PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway  is 
frequently  a characteristic  of worsen ing prognosis through  increased  aggressiveness, 
resistance  to treatment and progression. The  main known functions  of mTOR include  the 
following  1,2: 
 
• mTOR  functions  as a sensor of mitogens, growth factors  and energy  and nutrient 
levels,  facilitating  cell-cycle  progression from  G1 to  S phase  in appropriate  growth  
conditions.  
• The PI3K -mTOR  pathway  itself is frequently  activated in many human cancers,  and 
oncogenic  transfor mation  may sensitize  tumor cells to mTOR  inhibitors.  
• Through  inactivating  eukaryotic  initiation  factor  4E binding  proteins  (4E-BP1) and  
activating  the 40S riboso mal S6 kin ases (i.e., p70S6K1), mTOR regulates 
translation  of important  massages,  including  those  encoding  the HIF-1 proteins,  c- 
myc,  ornithine  decarbo xylase,  and cyclin  D1, as well  as ribo somal protei ns 
themselves.  
• The activation  of mTOR  pathway  leads to the increased  production  of pro - 
angiogenic  factors  (i.e., VEGF) in  tumors  and to tumor, endothelial  and smooth 
muscle  cell growth and  proliferation.  
• The regulation  of mTOR signaling  is complex and involves  positi ve regulators, such 
as AKT that  phosphorylate  and inactivate  negative  regulators  such as the  Tuberous 
Sclero sis Complex  (TSC1/TSC2).  
 
mTOR  is represented  by [CONTACT_407162]-protein signaling 
complexes,  mTORC1  (mTOR  complex  1, rapamycin  sensitive)  and mTORC2  (mTOR 
complex 2, rapa mycin insensitive).[ADDRESS_513360]  through  AKT (also known as PKB, protein  kinase  B) and  the tuberous  sclerosis 
complex (TSC1/TSC2)  2. Activated  AKT phosphorylates  TSC2, which  lead to the 
dissociation  of TSC1/TSC2  complex,  thus inhibiting  the ability  of TSC2  to act as a 
GTPase activating  protein.  This allows  Rheb, a small G-protein,  to remain in a GTP bound 
state and to activate  mTORC1.  AKT can  also activate  mTORC1  by [CONTACT_129554]40 
phosphorylation,  thereby  [CONTACT_407163]40 -mediated  inhibition  of mTORC1 .4 
mTORC2  (mTOR  complex  2) is activated  through  a currently  unknown mechani sm, 
possibly  by [CONTACT_407164] (RTK) signaling .[ADDRESS_513361]  to modulation  by [CONTACT_407165],  such as evero limus. Once  these  agents  bind to the 12 kDa 
cytosolic  FK506-bindi ng protein  immunop hilin FKBP12, the  resulting  rapamycin- 
FKBP12 complexes  bind to a specific  site near the catalytic  domain of mTORC1  and 
inhibit  phosphorylation  of mTOR substrates.  As a consequence,  downstream  signaling  
Everolimus -Pazopanib Phase I  
v. 11/3/16 
- 9 -  
  
 
events  involved  in regulation  of the  G1 to  S-phase transition  are inhibited.  This 
mechani sm is thought  to be responsible  for the immunosuppressive  effects  of rapa mycin 
as well  as its  putative  antineoplastic  activity. As many cancers  are characterized  by 
[CONTACT_407166] G1 transit  (for example,  overexpression  of cyclin or cyclin -depende nt 
kinases),  inhibition  of mTOR  becomes  an intriguing  target  for inducing  cytostasis.2 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Preclinical  studies  
 
Pre-clinical  investigati ons have demonstrated  that everoli mus is a potent  inhibitor  of 
theproliferation  of a range  of human tumor cell lines in-vitro with IC50s ranging  from 
sub/low  nano molar to micro molar concent rations,  concentrations  capable  of being 
reached  in patients at the doses used in  clinical trials.  
 
Everoli mus was shown to  have  activity  in human tumor cell lines  originating  from  lung, 
breast,  prostate,  colon,  kidney,  melano ma and glioblasto ma. In a clonogenic  assay using 
cells derived  from  81 patient -derived  tumor xenografts  never  cultured  in vitro (11 hu man 
tumor types  with 3 to 24 tu mors each:  bladd er, colon, gastric,  NSCLC [adeno,  squamous 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_407100]],  SCLC,  breast,  ovary,  pancreatic,  renal,  melano ma, and 
pleura mesothelio ma), Everoli mus inhibited  colony  formation  in a concentration - 
dependent  manner.  In addition,  normal hematopoetic  stem  cells were  insensitive  to 
everoli mus, with an IC50 about  15 fold  higher  than the tumor lines.  Everoli mus also 
inhibits  the proliferation  of hu man umbilical  vein endothelial  cells (HUVECS), with 
particular  potency  against  VEGF -induced  proliferation.  The inhibition  of endothelial  
proliferation  and antian giogenic  activity  of everoli mus was confir med in vivo, as 
everoli mus selectively  inhibited  VEGF -dependent  angiogenic  response. Mice  with 
primary and metastatic  tumors  treated with everolimus  showed a  significant  reduction  in 
blood  vessel  density  when co mpared  to controls  at well tolerated  doses. Additio nally, 
activity in a VEGF -impregnated  subcutaneous  implant  model of angiogenesis  and 
reduced  vascularity  (vessel  density)  of Everolimus - treated  tumors (murine  melanoma) 
provided  evidence  of in vivo effects  of angiogenesis.  
 
Everoli mus also inhibits  tumor growth in-vivo in xenografted,  syngen eic and orthotopic 
animal models,  residing  longer  in tumor  tissue  than in plasma  and demonstrating  high 
tumor penetration  in a rat panc reatic  tumor model.  These  effects  occurred within  the dose 
range  of 2.5 to  10 mg/kg p.o. daily.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897],  the antitu mor activity of everoli mus 
monotherapy  was that  of reduction  of tumor growth rates  rather  than producing 
regressions or stable  disea se. Everoli mus, administred  p.o., was a  potent  inhibitor  of tumor 
growth and  well tolerated in: 
 
• subcutaneous  mouse xenograft  model,  establi shed from  a variety  of tumor  cell lines  of 
diverse  histotypes  (NSCLC, pancreatic,  colon, melano ma, epi[INVESTIGATOR_407101]), including  a 
Pgp170 over -expre ssing multi -drug resistant  tumor  line; 
• in a series  of low -passage  tumor xenografts  established  directly  from  human tumor 
material,  maintained only in vivo  and considered  highly  predictive  of therapeutic 
outco me in patients.  These  included  breast  (5 lines), colorectal  (9 line s), gastric  (3 
Everolimus -Pazopanib Phase I  
v. 11/3/16 
- 10 -  
  
 
lines),  lung (22 lines  includ ing adenocarcino mas, epi[INVESTIGATOR_407102], large  cell and small 
cell histotypes),  melano ma (6 lines),  ovarian  (4 lines),  pancreatic  (3 lines)  and renal  (6 
lines); 
• in two syngeneic  models  (CA20948 rat  pancreatic,  B16/Bl6  mouse orthotopic 
melanoma) 
Taken  together,  these  data indicate  the broad  anti-proliferati ve potential  of everoli mus. 
It is not clear  which  molecular  deter minants  predict  responsiveness  of tumor  cells to 
everoli mus. Molec ular analysis  has revealed  that relative sensitivity to everolimus in vitro 
correlates  with the degree  of phosphorylation  (activation)  of the  AKT/PKB protein  kinase 
and the S6 riboso mal protein.  PTEN status  alone  may not be predictive  of everoli mus 
relative in vitro sensitivity,  however  in some cases  (i.e., GBM) there  is also a correlation 
with PTEN status.  In preclinical models, the administration  of everoli mus is associated 
with reduction  of protein  phosphorylation  in target  proteins  downstream  of mTOR, notably  
phosphorylated  S6 (pS6) a nd p4E-BP1,  and occasi onally  with an increase  in 
phosphorylation  AKT (pAKT).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pre -clinical  safety  
 
In safety  pharmacology  studies,  everoli mus was devoid  of relevant  effects  on vital 
functions  including  the cardiovascular,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_407103]. Everoli mus had 
no influence  on QT interval  prolongation.  Furthermore,  everoli mus show ed no antigenic 
potential.  Although  everoli mus passes the  blood -brain barrier,  there  was no indication  of 
relevant  changes  in the behavior  of rodents,  even  after single  oral doses up to  2000 mg/kg 
or after  repeated  administration  at up to  40 mg/kg/day.  Based  on these  findings,  the 
potential  of everoli mus to affect  vital functions  in patients  is considered  to be low. 
Everoli mus is considered  to have  no genotoxicity  or carcinogenicity  potenti al. All 
significant  adverse  events  observed in preclinical  toxicology  studies  with everoli mus in 
mice, rats, monkeys  and minipi[INVESTIGATOR_407104] a 
2- or 4-week  recovery  period  with the exception  of the  changes  in male reproductive 
organs, most notably  testes.  Ocular effects  (lenticular  disorde rs) observed  in rats were  not 
observed  in any other  species  and are consi dered to be a species -specific  disord er. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Everolimus  Pharmacokinetics  
 
Everoli mus is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_407105] a median  tmax of 1-2 hours. The  bioavailability  of 
the drug is  believed  to be 11% or greater.  The AUC0-τ is dose-proportional  over the dose 
range  between  5 to 70 mg  in the weekly  regimen and 5 and  10 mg in the daily  regimen. 
Cmax is dose-proportional  between  5 and  10 mg for both  the weekly  and daily  regimens. 
At doses of 20 mg/week  and higher,  the increase in Cmax is less than  dose-proportional. 
The coefficient  of variation  between  patie nts is approxi mately  50%. Trough  levels  ([ADDRESS_513362] -dose) correlate  well with AUC0 -τ at steady -state during  daily  administration.  
Everolimus -Pazopanib Phase I  
v. 11/3/16 
- 11 -  
  
 
In whole  blood,  at a daily  dose of 10 mg, about  20% of everoli mus is confined  in plasma 
with 26% being  unbound. The  remaining  80% is  sequestered  in blood  cells.  
 
Everoli mus is extensiv ely metaboli zed in the liver and eliminated  in the bile. Major 
metabolites  are inactive.  Elimination  half-life is approxi mately  30 hours. The  cleara nce 
of everoli mus is approxi mately  halved  in patients  with mild-moderate  hepatic  impairment 
(Child -Pugh  Class  A or B), while  renal  impairment  has little  or no i mpact on the 
pharmacokinetics  of everoli mus. Age, weight  and gender  in the adult  population  do not 
affect  the pharmacokinetics  of ever olimus to a clinically  relevant extent.  The clearance  of 
everoli mus is reduced  in children. Pharmacokinetic  characteristics  are not notably different  
between  Caucasian  and Japanese  subjects,  whereas  in Black  patients  population 
pharmacokinetic  studies  have  shown an  average 20% higher  clearance.  A high-fat meal 
altered  the absorption  of everoli mus with 1.3 hour delay  in tmax, a 60% reduction  in Cmax 
and a 16% reduction  in AUC.  
 
Everoli mus is a substrate  of CYP3A4 and  a substrate  and a moder ate inhibitor of the 
multi -drug efflux pump P-glycopr otein (P-gP, MDR1, ABCB1). Hence,  its metabolism is 
sensitive  to drugs which  modify  these  enzy mes (substrates,  inducers,  or inhibitors  of 
these  enzymes).  Competitive  inhibition  could  occur when Everoli mus is combined  with 
drugs which  are also CYP3A4 or P -glycoprotein  substrates.  Section  5.4.5 lists  examples 
of clinically  relevant  CYP3A inhibitors  and inducers.  Please  refer  to Section  5.4.5 for 
more  information  on the  conco mitant use of CYP3A4 inhibit ors/inducers  and other 
medications.  More infor mation  on everoli mus pharmacokinetics  is provided  in the 
Investigator’s  Brochure.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Everolimus  Pharmacodynamic  studies  
 
Pharmacokinetic/phar macodyna mic modeling  based  on inhi bition of the  biomarker 
p70S6 kinase  1 [S6K1] in  peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells [PBMC]) suggests that  5- 
10 mg daily  should  be an adequate  dose to  produce  a high-degree  of sustained  target 
inhibition.  Further more, molecular  pharmacodyna mic (MPD) studies,  using 
immunocytoche mistry (IHC) in  biopsied  tumor tissue,  assessed the  degree  of inhibition 
and its duration  for pS6, p4E -BP1 and pAKT  expression  with the daily  and weekly 
dosing.  There  was high  inhibition  of the  downstream  markers  S6K1 and  4E-BP1 at 
5mg/day,  which  was complete  at 10 mg/day,  while preliminary  results suggest  increase in 
pAKT expression  with maximal effect at 10 mg daily  5. More infor mation  is provided  in 
the Investigator’s  Brochure.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical  experience  with everolimus  
 
Everoli mus has been  investigated as a component  of multi-drug immunosuppression  in 
solid  organ  transplantation  since  1996 and was approved  for the  indication  of prophylaxis 
of organ  rejection  in adult  patients  receiving  an allogeneic  renal  or cardiac  transplant  on 8 
Jul 2003 by [CONTACT_407167]®.  The most  frequent 
adverse  drug reactions  in this context are highly  specific  to the trans plant conte xt. 
Everolimus -Pazopanib Phase I

and increases  in blood  lipid levels.  
 
 
Everoli mus is a novel  derivative  of rapamycin.  It has been  in clinical  develop ment since  
1996  as an immunosup pressant  in solid  organ  transplantation.  Everoli mus is approved  in 
Europe  and other  global  markets  (trade  name: [CONTACT_407230]®) for cardiac  and renal 
transplantation,  and in the United  States (trade name: [CONTACT_118]®)  for the prevention  of 
organ  rejection  of kidney  transplantation.

2.1.2 Pa zopanib  (GW786034)  
 
Pazopanib  is a potent,  multi-targeted  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor  (TKI) of VEGFR -1, -2, -3, 
PDG FR-α and -β and c-kit, with half-maximal inhibition  (IC 50) values  of 10, 30, 47, 71, 84 
and 74nM, respectively.  It inhibits  VEGF -induced  VEGFR -2 phosphorylation  in human 
umbilical  vein endothelial  cells (HUVEC) as well  as in mouse lungs  in a dose-dependent 
manner.  Data  from  preclinical  studies  show pazopanib  has significant  growth inhibition  of a 
variety  of hu man tumor xenografts  in mice, and also inhibits  basic  fibroblast  growth factor - 
(bFGF -) and  VEGF -induced  angiogenesis  in two mouse  models  of angiogenesis,  viz., the 
Matrigel  plug assay and  the cornea  micropocket  model.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety  
 
As of September  2007, approxi mately  [ADDRESS_513366] common adverse  events (AEs) reported  to date include  diarrhea, 
fatigue,  nausea, hyperte nsion,  hair color chan ges (hair  depi[INVESTIGATOR_371]),  anorexia,  vomiting, 
dysgeusia,  headache,  abdo minal pain,  rash, aspartate  aminontransferase  (AST) and  alanine 
aminontransferase  (ALT)  increases,  constipation,  cough,  and arthralgia.  Most of these  events  
were  Grade  1 or 2 using  the NCI Common Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse Events Version 
3.0 (NCI -CTCAE). The  most frequent  Grade [ADDRESS_513367] and ALT  increases.  Less common AEs of note  include  hand - 
foot syndro me, mucositis/ stomatitis,  proteinuria,  venous thr ombotic  events, and bleeding. 
Intestinal perforations  and arterial  thromboses  were  uncom mon. 
 
The most common  serious adverse  events  (SAEs) occurring  in subjects  enrolled  in 
pazopanib  studies  regardless  of treat ment assign ment include  vomiting,  diarrhea, abdo minal 
pain,  hypertension/hypertensive  crisis, dyspnea,  pleural  effusion,  pyrexia, ane mia, 
dehydration,  and pulmonary  embolism. Evaluation  of the  safety  and efficacy  of pazopanib  
in advanced  RCC  subjects  include  a recently  completed  Phase II study  in subjects  with 
advanced  RCC,  and a Phase  III rand omized,  double -blind  study  against placebo  which  
completed  enrol ment in April,  2007 and  is currently  on-going.  To date,  660 subjects  with 
advanced/ metastatic  RCC have  been enrolled  in these  two clinic al trials. Safety  data from  
the Phase II RCC  trial VEG102616 (n=225)  are summarized  here.  The most  common  AEs 
(defined  as AEs experienced  by ≥10% of subjects)  regardless  of causality  in decreasing  
order  of frequency  were  diarrhea  (63%), fatigue  (46%), hair  color change  (43%), nausea  
(42%), hypertension  (41%), anorexia  (24%), dysgeusia  (24%), vo miting (20%), headache  
(20%), cough  (17%), abdo minal pain,(16%),  rash (16%),  consti pation  (15%) ALT  
elevation (14%), arthralgia  (13%),  AST elevation  (12%), back 
pain (12%), dizziness  (12%), handfoot  syndro me (11%),  alopecia,  (10%),  dyspepsia  (10%), 
and perip heral edema (10%). The  majority  of these events were  Grade  1 and  2 with  
hypertension  being  observed  in 9% of subjects  as a Grade  3 event.  
Everolimus -Pazopanib Phase I  
v. 11/3/[ADDRESS_513368] common  hematological  toxicities  of any grade  (graded  accor ding to NCICTCAE) 
include  lymphopenia  (47%), thro mbocytopenia  (28%), neutropenia  (23%), and  anemia 
(26%) with  combined  Grade  3 and  4 abnor malities occurring  in 7%, 3%, <1%,  and 4% of 
subjects,  respecti vely. The most common  chemistry abnor mality was hy perglyce mia, 
observed  in 46% of subjects  (of which  2% w ere Grade  3 and  no Grade  4). Hyponatre mia of 
any grade  was observed  in 37% of subjects,  with Grade  3 or Grade  4 hyponatre mia in 8% 
of subjects.  Hyperkale mia of any  grade  was r eported  in 27% of subjects,  with Grade  3 or 4 
hyperkale mia in 5% of subjects.  Hyponatre mia and hyperkale mia have  not occurred  
concurrently  in the same subject to indicate  adrenal insufficiency.  Elevations  in amylase 
and lipase  of any  grade  were  reported  in 23% and  27% of subjects,  respectively, with Grade  
3 or Grade  4 events  in 4% and  9% of subjects,  respectively.  There  were  2 reports  of 
pancreatitis.  Increase  in TSH  was reported  in 28% of subjects  and a decrease  in thyroxine 
(T4) in 1% of subjects.  Three  subjects  initiated  treatment with thyroid replace ment therapy 
(synthroid  or levothyroxine)  during  the study.  ALT elevations  of any  Grade  were  reported 
in 53% of subjects  with Grade  3 and  Grade  4 elevations  in 9% and  <1%  of subjects, 
respectively.  AST elevations  were  reported  in 53% of subjects  with Grade  3 and  Grade  4 
elevations  in 5% and  <1%  of subjects,  respectively.  Hyperbilirubine mia of any  Grade 
occurred  in 28% of subjects  with Grade  3 elevations  in <1%  of subjects.  No Grade  [ADDRESS_513369] 
been  observed  in 2 (<1%  ) subjects.  Neither  of these  patients  met the criteria  for Hy’s rule. 
Risk factors  that may have  contributed  to the liver dysfunction  were  identified in the some 
of these  subjects,  (e.g.,  large  mass at the porta  hepatis,  hepatotoxic  conco mitant 
medications).  Liver  enzy me elevations  were  reversible  upon dose interruption.  Two 
patterns  of transa minase changes  have  been  observed:  (1) transa minase elevations  that 
declined  over time without  dose i nterruption.  (2) transa minase elevations  that declined  over 
time upon dose interruption.  In so me subjects,  elevations  in transa minase recurred  upon 
rechallenging  and these  subje cts were  permanently  discontinued  from  study  treatment. Serial  
adrenocorticotropic  hormone (ACTH) st imulation  tests were  conducted  in two Phase I and 
two Phase II trials  in cancer subjects with data availa ble in 47 subjects.  Twenty -one 
of them  had data beyond  24 weeks and  5 subjects  had data beyond  52 weeks. None of these  
47 subjects  had adrenal  insufficiency.  
 
Certain  uncommon AEs with  significant  clinical  consequences  reported  in pazopanib 
clinical  trials  (deno minator  for total  subject  enrol ment n=1000  used for calculating 
frequency)  include  pulmonary  embolism  (0.6%), venous thrombosis  (0.3%), venous 
thrombosis  and pulmonary  embolism  (0.2%), serious he morrhage  (1.4%), bowel 
perforation  (0.5%), myocardial  infar ction/angina  (0.7%), cerebrovascular 
accide nts/transient  ische mia (0.6%), cardiac  failure (0.2%), atrial  fibrillation  (0.3%), renal 
failure  (0.8%) and  seizures  (0.3%).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Preliminary  Efficacy  Summary  
 
VEG102616 is  a Phase II study  to evaluate  the efficacy  and safety of pazo panib in subjects 
with advanced/ metastatic  RCC.  Of the 225 subjects  enrolled,  155 (69%) had  no prior 
syste mic therapy,  and 70 (31%) had  1 prior  therapy  of either  a cytokine  or bevacizumab

based  therapy.  The study  utilized  a rando mized discontinuati on design  that includes  a 12- 
week  lead-in phase  during  which  all subjects  received  800mg  pazopanib  daily  dose. Based 
on the  disease  assess ment at Week 12, subjects  with a complete or partial  response would 
continue  pazopanib  treatment until disease  progression;  subjects with progressi ve disease 
(PD) at  or prior  to Week 12 would discontinue  pazopanib  treatment; and subjects  with stable  
disease  (SD) at  Week  [ADDRESS_513370] 60 enrolled  subjects  had completed the 12-week  Lead -In phase.  Based  on the 
review  of both  interim  efficacy  (12-week respon se rate) and safety  data from  this study, the 
Independe nt Data  Monitoring  Committee  recommended  halting  further  rando mization,  
unblinding  the study  and offering  pazopanib  treatment to subjects  on the  placebo  arm of the 
rando mization  phase  of the  study.  As a result  rando mization  at 12 wks was discontinued, 
subjects  previously  rando mized to placebo  were  crossed over  to pazop anib, and all subjects 
could  receive pazopanib  until progressive disease (PD), unac ceptable  toxicity,  or consent 
withdrawal.  
 
In 2009, the  FDA granted  approval  to pazopanib  for the  treatment of patients  with advanced 
renal  cell carcino ma. This was based  on the  results of a phase  III intern ational, rando mized, 
double -blind  trial comparing  pazopanib  to placebo  in patients  with previously  untreated 
advanced  renal  cell carcino ma or patients  who had  progressed on cytokine  therapy.  This 
study  demonstrated  a progression -free survival  advantage  of 9.2 months  with pazopanib  vs. 
4.2 months  with placebo(7).  In [ADDRESS_513371] the annual  European  society  of Medical  Oncology  meeting,  In this  study  the 
tolerability  of pazopanib  was compared  to sunitinib  and results  showed that  pazopanib  was 
associated  with significantly  better health  related  quality  of life  compared  to suniti nib and it 
resulted  in less fatig ue and less dysgeusia.  In 2012, the  FDA approved  pazopanib 
hydrochloride  tablets  for the  treatment of patients  with advanced  soft tissue  sarco ma (STS) 
who have  received  prior  chemotherapy  after it was shown to  improve  median  PFS to  4.6 
months for patients  receiving  pazopanib  hydrochloride  compared  with 
1.6 months  for patients  recei ving placebo  in a phase III stud y. 
 
 
 
2.2 Study Disease  
 
While  front -line cisplatin -based  combination  chemotherapy  is highly  active,  more than 85% of 
patients  will relapse  following  initial  therapy.  There  is no standard  2nd-line regimen following 
failure  of front -line chemotherapy.  Many agent s, including  docetaxel,  paclitaxel,  pemetrexed, 
and ifosfamide, have  shown single  agent  responses (between  10-20%, which  improve  with 
combination  therap y), yet no rando mized trial has shown the  benefit of one  over another.  In fact, 
no second -line trial has de monstrated  improved  survival  with any chemotherapy  agent.

factor  to directly  promote bladder  cancer  growth .25 Furthermore,  retrospective  evaluation  of serum  
VEGF levels  in the metastatic  setting  appears to correlate  high levels  with poor disease - free 
survi val.26 Baseline  VEGF mRNA expression  levels  and microvessel  density  were  found to  be 
independent  prognostic  factors  for recurrence  and metastasis  in 51 patients  treated  with 
neoadjuvant  MVAC ch emotherapy  and cystectomy.11 In addition  to its pro-angiogenic  role, 
elevated  levels  of VEGF in  tumors lead to abnor mal microvasculatu re. Excessive  angiogenic 
factors  recruit  endot helial and perivascular  cells to form tortuous  and dilated  blood  vessels with 
poor rheological  characteristics,  leading  to abnor mal tumor blood  flow. Elevated  VEGF levels  in 
tumors leads  to increased  vascul ar permeability.27 By [CONTACT_407168],  not only are the 
aberrant  tumor-associated  blood  vessels eli minated, but the microvasculature  also appears  to be 
remodeled,  leading  to more “normal” blood  vessel architecture.  This leads  to improved 
transvascular  drug delivery  directly  to tumor cells.  
 
VEGF inhibition  alone,  which  primarily targets  endothelial  cells does not  appear  to be sufficient 
as an  anti-cancer strategy in advanc ed urotheli al carcinoma. Suniti nib and pazopanib  have  shown 
modest  activity as single agents,  with few patients  having  objective  responses,  and rates  of stable 
disease  are low.28-[ADDRESS_513374]  any significant  disease  response or s tabiliz ation. 
 
Autocrine  and paracrine  growth signals  to cancer  cells are frequently  mediated  via the PI3 
kinase/Akt  pathway.32 PI3 kinase  activity  results  in membrane localiz ation of Akt, leading  to the 
generation  of activated  phospho -Akt. This  activated  Akt phospho rylates  and inactivates  TSC2. 
TSC1  and TSC2  form a complex that normally suppresses  signaling  through  mTOR.  Inactivation 
of TSC2  results in increased  signaling  through  the mTOR complex,  which  then leads  to 
increased  cell metabolism,  growth, and  survival.  These  effects  appear  to be abrogated  by [CONTACT_407169].33 In addition,  mTOR  may also be directly  activated  by [CONTACT_334946] .34 
 
The PI3 kinase/Akt/ mTOR  pathway  is frequently  activated in advanced  urothelial  carcino ma 
speci mens.35,[ADDRESS_513375]  frequent  genet ic alteration in transitional  cell 
carcino ma.39 TSC1  is believed  to represent  a tumor suppressor gene  deleted  at that site. 
Inactivating  mutations  are observed  in TSC1  in 10-30% of cases.40,[ADDRESS_513376]  located  on 
chromosome  10q, shows loss of heterozygosity  in approximately  25% of transitional  cell

of this  agent.  
 
Based  on these  data,  the PTEN/PI3  kinase/Akt/mTOR  pathway  may play an important  role in 
transitional  cell carcino ma, and inhibition  of this  pathway  may be therapeutically useful in 
advanced  transitio nal cell carcinoma patie nts. The utility  of these  agents in combination  with 
anti-VEGF  agents  has not  yet been  thoroughly  tested, as synergy between  these  pathways  is 
predicted.  
 
2.3 Rationale 
 
 
Dose Escalation  Cohort:  Both  anti-angiogenic  therapy  and mTOR inhibiti on provide  significant 
clinical benefit  in metastatic  kidney  cancer  patie nts, although  responses to  each thera py are 
limited in duration  and extent.  
 
Expansion  Cohort:  There  are no standard  thera pi[INVESTIGATOR_407107] -line chemotherapy.  Novel  approaches 
are needed. 
 
Currently  approved  anti-VEGF  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors exhibit significant side effects, inclu ding 
rash, diarrhea,  endocri ne abnor malitie s, cardi otoxicity,  and fatigue. Pazopanib  appears  to have  a 
somewhat  improved  therapeutic  index  and may be associa ted with less toxicity  yet with 
comparable  efficacy.  
 
Pazopanib  has been  tested  in a rando mized discontinuation  study  in patients with metastatic 
clear  cell renal  cell carcino ma. Pazopanib  has resulted  in 40% of patients  with a partial  response 
to induction  therapy,  and a signif icant improvement in progression  free survival  in patients 
rando mized to active  drug in  the rando mized discontinuation  portion  of the  protocol.  
 
The most prominent  significant  toxicity  observed  has been  hypertension.  Hepatotoxicity  may be 
higher  with this agent  but fewer  dermatologic  and gastr ointestinal  toxicities have  been  observed 
compared  to other  anti-VEGF  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors.  The lower  toxicity,  enhanced 
tolerability,  and high activity  of pazopanib  make it an ideal  candidate  to combine with other 
targeted  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
Addition  of another  agent  targe ting other  anti-angiogenic  pathways  may provide  either  additive  
or synergistic  effects  with existing  anti-VEGF  agents.  Downstream  signal  transduction  inhibition 
of the  PTEN/Akt/ mTOR  pathway  by [CONTACT_407171] -Pazopanib Phase I  
v. 11/3/[ADDRESS_513378] everolimus  in combination  with pazopanib.  Everoli mus is FDA approved  for the  treatment of 
advanced  kidney  cancer,  pancreatic  neuroendo crine tumors, and subependy mal giant  cell 
astrocyto mas. – In 2012 Afinitor)®  ( received  approval  for the  treatment of pos tmenopausal 
women with advanced  hormone receptor -positive,  HER2 - negative  breast cancer  (advanced  HR+ 
BC) in combination  with exemestane,  after failure of treat ment with letrozole  or anastrozole.  
 
Results  from  drug-drug interac tion studies  conducted  in subjec ts with cancer  suggest that 
pazopanib  is a weak  inhibitor  of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and  CYP2D6 in vivo , but had no clinically 
relevant  effect  on CYP1A2, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 metabolis m. Everolimus  is a substrate  of 
CYP3A pathways,  and a competiti ve inhibitor of CYP3A and  CYP2D6 enzy mes. These  potential 
interactions  require  pharmacokinetic  evaluation  of drug levels  of both  everoli mus and pazopanib. 
As a result,  pharmacokinetic  data for both  drugs will  be obtained  at day 1 and  15 of  cycle  1 for 
all patients  on the  phase  I portion  of this  study.  
 
 
The starting  dose for the  initial  Phase 1 cohort  was chosen  as 3/[ADDRESS_513379]  the 
targets  as single  agents.  
 
For the  dose escalation  cohort:  Esca lation  occurred  in a [ADDRESS_513380]  dose of 800 mg  daily.  Everoli mus will be escalated  from  5 mg  to 10 mg. One drug 
is escalated alternately  in each successive  cohort. De-escalation  will be allowed  to dose level -1 
if there  are excessive  DLT’s observ ed in the starting dose le vel. In ad dition, dose lev el +2A will 
be considered  if there  is a DLT  at dose level  +2. This dose level  would test  full dose pazopanib  
800 mg daily  in combination  with everoli mus 5 mg  daily.

Everolimus -Pazopanib Phase I  
v. 11/3/[ADDRESS_513381] portion  of this  study  of everoli mus plus pazopanib  in genitourinary  and other 
solid  malignancies  was carried  out at the Dana-Farber  Cancer  Institute.  Nine  patients were  
enrolled  of which  five had urothelial  carcino ma of the  bladder.  These  nine patients were  
either  treated  on Dose Level  0: Pazopanib  600 mg PO QD and  everoli mus 5 mg PO QD 
(n=3)  or Dose Level  -1: Pazopanib  400 mg PO QD and  everoli mus 5 mg  PO QD (n=6).  
Pharmacokinetic  data were  collected  on everoli mus and pazopanib  to deter mine 
whether  drug-drug interactions  occur.  These  data are from  the 5 patients  (3 lung  cancer,2 
bladder  cancer,1  adrenal  cortical  carcino ma) treated  with pazopanib  400 mg  daily  and 
everoli mus 5 mg daily(Dose  Level  -1). T he Day 15 steady -state whole  blood  everoli mus

The perce nt difference  between  the mean values of the  steady -state PK para meters  for

+13%  for C min,ss,  +18%  for C max,ss,  and +100%  for AUCss(0 -24h).  These  findings 
demonstrate  a significant  pharmacokinetic  interaction  between the two drugs resulting  in 
a marked  decrea se in the appare nt clearance  of everolimus. Pharmacokinetic  data for 
pazopanib  from  the phase  I combination  trial indicates  that there is no effect  of 
everoli mus on pazopanib  pharmacokinetics  when evaluated  in the context  of known

Nine  patients  were  enrolled  in the phase  I portion  of this  study.  Two patients  on dose level 
0 (pazopanib  600 mg daily  and evero limus 5 mg daily)  experienced  dose limiting toxicities  
(grade  3 rash and  pruritus  and grade  3 thro mbocytopenia  requiring  a dose reduction).  
Therefore,  three  patie nts were  treated  at dose le vel -1 per  protocol.  None of these  three  
patients experienced  a protocol -defined  dose-limiting toxicity.  Therefore, another  three  
patients  were treated  at dose level  -1 (pazopanib  400 mg daily  and everoli mus 5 mg daily)  
without  any dose-limiting toxicities.  Therefore,  per protocol, dose level  -1 was defined  as 
the maximum tolerated  dose.

though  many were  expected  based  on the  known  toxicities  of everoli mus and pazopanib. 
One patient  did experience  a grade  3 pneu mothorax,  which  was possibly  related  to study 
therapy.  Other  non-hematologic  toxicities  included  anorexia  (11%), bone  pain (11%), 
diarrhea  (22%, 11% G3), fatigue  (56%), dy sgeusia  (11%), headache  (11%), hypertension

toxicities  included  increased  ALT,  hypophosphate mia, and hypourice mia each in 1 
patient,  and increased  lipase in 2 patients.  
Treat ment was gene rally well tolerated at the MTD. Two of 6 patients  came off treat ment 
after 2 cycles  because  of toxicity.  The others  stopped treatment due to disease 
progression or physician  decision.  
 
Antitu mor activity 
 
Encouraging  antitu mor activity was noted in the bladder  cancer  patients  treated  on 
pazopanib  and everolimus.  Of five  urotheli al cancer patie nts evalua ble, 3 had  stable 
disease  for 4 months,  4 months  and 5.5 months  respectively.  One patient  had a complete  
response which  lasted  14 months.

Based  on these  findings  of preli minary  increased  activity of the regimen in at least a subset 
of urothelial  carcino ma patien ts, the protocol  is being  amended  to accrue  urothelial 
carcino ma patients  rather  than kidney  cancer  patients  in the expansion  cohort  given  the 
significant  unmet need  in urothelial  carcino ma. Since  there  are no ap proved treatments for 
patients  with progressive  disease  after front -line cytotoxic  chemotherapy,  testing  novel 
approaches  is rational.  Metas tatic urothelial  carcino ma patients treated  with 1-[ADDRESS_513382]  meet the following  criteria  on screening  examination  to be eligible  to

5.4.1 Dose escalatio n rules 
 
General  rules: 
• Initial  dose is dose lev el 0 for this  trial 
• All patients  in a dose c ohort will complete  28 days (1 cycle)  of co mbination  treatment 
prior  to the treatment of any  patient  at a higher  dose level.  
• If a patient  does not  complete  the 28 days of treat ment for reasons that  are clearly  not 
adverse  events related  to treatment, then that patient  will be replaced,  up to  three  per 
dose level.  
• If more than three  patients need  to be replaced on a dose le vel, then the reasons  will 
be re-evaluated  before  continuing.  
• There  will be no intrapatient  dose escalation.  
• To deter mine that a subject  has received  study  treatment without  experiencing  DLT, 
the subject  must  have  missed  no more than [ADDRESS_513427] 
3+3 dose escalation  rules:  
 
1. If 0 of 3 patie nts in a cohort  experience  dose li miting toxicities,  then the next cohort of 
3 patie nts will be treated at the next higher  dose level.  
 
2. If 1 of 3 patients  in a cohort  experiences  a DLT  then the cohort  will be expanded  to 
treat an additional three patie nts. If only one of 6 patie nts experiences a DLT, then the 
next cohort  of patients  will be treated  at the next higher  dose level.  
 
3. If two or more  patients  in a cohort  experience  a DLT,  then the MTD has been  
exceeded.  The previous  dose lev el will be consi dered the MTD. If only  3 patie nts were 
treated at the previous  dose lev el, an additional  three  patients will be treated at that dose 
level to confirm the MTD.  
 
4. If the  doses of both  drugs are  escalated  to dose level  2 with  0 of 3 or 1 out  of 6 patients 
experiencing  a DLT,  then this will be considered  the recommended  Phase II dose 
(RP2D) for the  expansion  cohort.  
 
5. If the  MTD is  exceeded  on dose level  0, then  a de-escalati on cohort  to dose level  -1 
will be enrolled.  Up to  six patie nts will be treated at this dose level.  If one or fewer  of 
six patients  experiences  a DLT,  then this will be the RP2D. If two or more patients 
experience  a DLT  on dose lev el -1, then the combination  will be deemed not feasible 
and the study will be closed. 
 
6. If the  MTD is  exceeded  on dose level  2, then  a de-escalati on level  will be accrued 
(dose level  2A). If 0 of 3 or 1 out  of 6 patients  experience  a DLT on dose level  2A, 
Everolimus -Pazopanib Phase I  
v. 11/3/16 
- 42 -  
  
 
then this will be considered  the RP2D  for the  expansion  cohort.  If the  MTD is 
exceeded  on dose level  2A, then  dose level  1 will  be the RP2D.  
 
5.4.2 Definition  of a DLT 
 
Dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) is based  on the  CTEP  Active  Version of  the NCI 
Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse Events  (CTCAE  v4.0).  
 
 
For the purposes of Phase  I dose escalation,  a DLT will be defined  as toxicity  occurring 
within  the first 28 days of combination  therapy related  to therapy that meets the criteria 
spelled  out below:  
 
1.   Grade  3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity  excluding:  
 
•  Toxicity  attributed  to underlying  malignancy  
 
•  Nausea/vomiting  controlled  with antiemetics 
 
•  Grade  3 hypertension  that resolves  to ≤150/[ADDRESS_513428] ment  or 
addition  of oral blood  pressure  medicines  to ≤150/90  within  7 days from 
blood  press ure medicati on modification  will be considered  a DLT.  
 
•  Grade  3 asympto matic, clinically  insigni ficant laborat ory abnormalities,  inclu ding 
LDH,  alkaline   phosphatase   due   to   bone   metastases,   and   asymptomatic 
hypophosphate mia

5.5 Genera l Concomitan t Medicatio n and Supportiv e Care Guidelines  
5.5.1 Patients  should  receive  full supportive  care,  including  analgesic  medication, 
transfusions of blood  and blood  products,  antibiotics,  antie metics,  etc., when 
appropriate.  Although  aceta minophen  at doses of  2 g/day  is permitted,  it should  be 
used with  caution  in subjects  with impaired  liver funct ion. Anti-diarrheals,  such as 
lopera mide, may be administered  as needed  in the event  of diarrhea.  The reason(s) for 
treatment, dosage,  and the dates  of treat ment should  be recorded  in the medical  record.  
 
5.5.2 Palliative  radiation  therapy  may not be administered  while  the patient  is on study 
treatment. A symptomatic lesion or one which may produce  disability  (e.g.,  unstable 
femur) may be irradiated  before  study  initiation,  provided  other  measurable  or 
evalua ble disease  is present and radiation  thera py is completed  ≥ [ADDRESS_513431] still be met. Any other 
indic ations  for radi otherapy after protocol  treatment  has beg un will constitute  disease 
progression, and  the patient  will stop protocol  treatment. 
 
5.5.3 Erythropoetin/  Darbepoetin:  Use of erythropoietin  or darbepoetin  in this protocol  is 
permitted at the discretion of the  treating  physician  after cycle  1 (ie.,  after the DLT 
deter mination  period).  
 
5.5.4 Filgrastim  (G-CSF), pegfilgrastim,  and sargra mostim (GM -CSF) after  cycle  1 (ie.  
After the DLT  deter mination  period) 
1. Filgrastim/pegfilgrastim  and sargramost im should not be used to  avoid  dose 
reductions.  
2. Filgrasti m, pegfilgrastim,  or sargramo stim, may be used for secondary  prophylaxis 
following  an epi[INVESTIGATOR_204089].  
3. For the  treatment of febrile  neutropenia,  the use of CSF 's should  not be routinely 
instituted  as an  adjunct  to appropriate  antibiotic  therapy.  However, the  use of CSF 's 
may be indicated  in patients  who have  prognostic  factors  that are predictive  of 
clinical deterioration  such as pneu monia,  hypote nsion,  multi-organ dysfunction 
(sepsis syndro me) or fungal  infection,  as per  the ASCO guidelines.  Investigators 
should  therefore  use their  own discretion  in using  the CSF's in this setting.  The use 
of CSF (filgrasti m, pegfilgrastim  or sargra mostim)  must be docu mented  and 
reported  in the medical  record.  
4. If filgrastim,  pegfilgrastim  or sargramost im are used, they  must  be obtained  from 
commercial  sources.  
 
 
5.5.[ADDRESS_513432] captur e the concurrent use of all other drug s, over-the-

affect  or with  the potential  to affect  selected  CYP450 isoenzy mes. 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Permitted  Medications  
 
All subjects will be asked to provi de a complete  list of prescription  and over-the- 
counter  medications  that have  been  taken  within the [ADDRESS_513433]  be infor med as soon as possible  about  any new medication(s)  taken 
from the time of screeni ng until the completion  of the post-treatment follow -up visit. 
All conco mitant medications  taken during  the study will be recorded  in the case report 
form  (CRF) with  indication,  dose i nformation,  and dates  of ad ministration.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Permitted  Medications  – Use with Caution  
 
• Specific  recommendations  regarding  anticoagulants:  
Results  from  drug-drug int eraction  studies  conducted  in subjects  with cancer  
suggest that  pazopanib  has no effect  on the  metabolism  of S-warfarin. 
Hemorrhagic  events,  however,  have  been  reported  in clinical  studies  with 
pazopanib;  therefore,  pazopanib  should  be used with  caution  in subjects  with 
increased  risk of severe  bleeding  or who are  receiv ing conco mitant anticoagulant 
therapy  (e.g.,  warfarin  or its derivatives,  low molecular  weight  heparin,  
unfractionated  heparin).  Subjects  taking  conco mitant anticoagulant  therapy 
should  be monitored  regularly  for changes  in relevant  coagulation  parameters  as 
clinically  indicated,  as well  as for any  clinical  bleeding  epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  
 
Oral anticoagulants  such as warfarin  are CYP2C9 substrates  and, as such, no 
interaction  with everolimus  is expected.  However, drug -drug interaction  studies 
between  macrolide  antibiotics  and warfarin have  produced  mixed outcomes  and 
the disparity in these findings  has led to the conclusion  that multiple  factors may 
alter the clearance  of warfarin.  The co-administration  of everoli mus and oral 
anticoagulants  is possible  but should  be subject  to verific ation of coagulation 
(INR) once  steady  state is reached  (after  one week’s treat ment). 
 
• Specific  recommendations  regarding  hypoglycemic  therapy including  insulin: 
Results  from  drug-drug interaction  studies  conducted  in subjects  with cancer 
suggest that there will be no clinically  relevant pharmacokinetic  interaction 
between  pazopanib  and hypoglycemic  agents.  Transient  decreases  in serum 
glucose  (mainly  Grade  1 and  2, rarely  Grade  3) have  been  observed  in clinical 
studies  with pazopanib.  In addition,  decreases  in blood  sugar have  been  recently 
reported  in subjects  treated  with another  small molecule  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor, 
suniti nib (British  Journal  of Cancer  2008:  99, 1380).  Such c hanges  may require  
an adjust ment in the dose of hypoglyce mic and/or  insulin  therapy.  Subjects 
should  be advised  to report  symptoms  of hypoglyce mia (e.g.,  confusion,  visual 
disturbances,  palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814],  sweating).  Serum  glucose  should  be tested  during 
treatment with pazopanib  as outlined  in the protocol  and as clinic ally indicated.  
Everolimus -Pazopanib Phase I  
v. 11/3/16

• Specific  recommendations  regarding  oral hypoglycemic s: Co-administr ation of 
pazopanib  with some oral hypoglyce mics, including  glipi[INVESTIGATOR_7130],  glyburide 
(glibencla mide), glimepi[INVESTIGATOR_14956],  nateglinide,  repaglinide,  gliclazide,  acetohexa mide, 
carbuta mide, glibornuride,  glymidine,  metahexamide,  and tolaza mide, may result  in 
an increase  in plasma concentrations  of the  oral hypoglyce mic agent.  This increase  
may result  in hypoglyce mia. Therefore,  the dose of the  oral 
hypoglycemic  agent  should  be reduced  by 50% when pazopanib  administration 
starts.  The blood  glucose  should  be monit ored closely,  and the subject  should  be 
instructed  to measure  their blood  glucose if they experience  sympto ms of 
hypoglycemia  and inform  their physician  if their blood  glucose  concentration  is 
low. After  at least 14 days of pazopan ib administration,  the dose of the  oral 
hypoglycemic  agent may be increased  as necessary  to maintain  adequate  blood 
glucose  control.  
 
• The Effects  of Pazopan ib on Other  Drugs  
In vitro data indicate  that pazopanib  is a potential  inhibitor  for CYP3A4,  
CYP2C8, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, and 
CYP2E1.  Pregnane  X recept or transient transfection  assay suggested  some 
potential  for hu man CYP3A4 induction  at high concentrations.  Results  from 
drug-drug interaction  studies  conducted  in subjects  with cancer  suggest that 
pazopanib  is a weak  inhibitor  of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and  CYP2D6 in vivo , but 
had no clinically  relevant  effect  on CYP1A2, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 metabolis m. 
Therefore,  conco mitant use of pazopanib  with certain  medications  (substrates  of 
CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and  CYP 2D6) with  a narrow therapeutic  window should  be 
undertaken  with CAU TION due to the potential for alt erations in the 
pharmacologic  effects  of these  medicatio ns or an  increased  risk for serious or life 
threatening adve rse even ts assoc iated with such medications  (see below) 
secondary  to the inhibition of specif ic CYP enzymes  by [CONTACT_407185].  In ad dition, 
the potential  for drug interaction  with such medications,  although  diminished, 
may persist  after the last dose of pazop anib due to its long half-life (i.e., mean 
30.9 hours);  therefore,  continue  to exercise  CAUTION  for at  least [ADDRESS_513434] dose of pazopan ib when ad ministeri ng these  medicatio ns. 
These  medications  include (but are not limited to): 
• Ergot  derivatives:  dihydroergo tamine, ergonovine,  ergota mine, 
methylergonovine  (potential  increased  risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_407115]) 
• Neuroleptics:  pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924]  (potential  increased  risk for QT  interval 
prolongation,  ventricular  arrhythmia, and sudden  death)  
• Antiarrh ythmics: bepri dil, flecainide, lidoc aine, mexiletine,  amiodarone, 
quinidine,  propafenone  (potential  increased  risk for QT interval 
prolongation  and Torsade  de Pointes)  
• Immune  modulators:  cyclosporine,  tacroli mus, siroli mus (potential 
increased  risk for nephrotoxicity  and neurotoxicity)  
Everolimus -Pazopanib Phase I

• Miscella neous: quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  risperid one, cloza pi[INVESTIGATOR_050], atomoxetine.  
 
• The Effects  of Other  Drugs on P azopanib  and Everolimus  
Results  from in vitro studies  suggest that  the oxidative  metabolism  of pazopanib  
in human liver microsomes  is mediated  primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A4, with  minor 
contributions  from  CYP1A2 and  CYP2C8.  Further more, in vitro data suggest  
that pazopanib  is a substrate  for p -glycop rotein.  Substances  that induce  or inhibit 
CYP3A4 may  alter the pharmacologic  effects of pazopanib  and should  be used 
with CAU TION .  Co mpetitive  inhibition  could occur  when everoli mus is 
combined  with drugs which  are also CYP3A4 substrates.  Therefore  caution should  
be exercised  in such cases.  
 
1.   Concurrent  administration  of everolimus  and moderate  CYP3A4 inhibitors  (such 
as erythromycin,  fluconazole,  calcium  channel  blockers,  benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651])  and 
moderate  CYP3A4  inducers  (e.g. carba mazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  phenobarbital,  phenyt oin) 
should  also be avoided  if possible,  or used subject  to caution  (e.g. increased 
frequency  of safety  monitoring,  temporary  interruption  of everoli mus). 
2.   Grapefruit  and grapefruit  juice  affect  cytochro me P450 and  P-glycoprotein  
activity  and should  therefore  be avoided.  In addition,  patients  should  avoid  Seville 
oranges  and star fruit,  as well  as the  juice  of these  fruits,  which  are potent  
CYP3A4 -inhibit ors. 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Prohibited  Medicat ions 
 
 
Participa nts must  be instructed  not to take any medications  (over -the-counter  or 
other  products)  during  the protocol  treatment period  without  prior  consultation  with 
the investigator.  The investigator  should  instruct  the participant  to notify  the study 
site about  any new medications  he/she  takes  after the start of study  drug. All 
medications  (other  than study  drug) and significant  non-drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (including 
physical  therapy  and blood  transfusions) taken  within 28 days of starting  study 
treatment through  the 30-day safety  follow up visit  should  be reported  on the  CRF.  
 
• Subjects  should not receive  other  anti-cancer  therapy  [cytoto xic, biologic, 
radiation,  or hor monal (other  than leuprolide  or other  GnRH agonists)]  while  on 
treatment in this study.  
 
• No chronic  treatment with syste mic steroids  or other  immunosuppressive  agents 
are allowed.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_407116].  
 
• Medications  that inhibit  strongly  CYP3A4 may result  in increased  plasma 
pazopanib  and everolimus  concentrations.  Selection  of an  alternate  conco mitant 
medication  with no or minimal potenti al to inhibit  CYP3A4 is  required. Strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitors  which are prohibited  include:  
Everolimus -Pazopanib Phase I  
v. 11/3/16 
- 47 -  
  
 
•   Antibiotic s: clarithromycin,  telithromycin,  trolea ndomycin 
•   HIV: protease  inhibitors  (ritonavir,  indinavir,  saquinavir,  nelfinavir, 
amprenavir,  lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054])  
•   Antifungals : itraconzaole,  ketoconazole,  voriconazole,  fluconazole  
Antidepre ssants: nefazodone  
 
• Specific  recommendation  regarding  non-dihydropyridine calcium  channel  
blockers  (verapam il and diltia zem):  co-administration  of pazopanib  with 
calcium  channel blockers  may result  in increased  plasma concentrations  of the 
calcium  channel blocker.  Non-dihydropyridine  calcium  channel  blockers, 
verapa mil and diltiaze m, have  potential depressive  effects  on cardiac  conduction 
and contractility.  When pazopanib  therapy  is initiated, the administration of an 
anti-hypertensive  or anti-anginal  agent  other  than verapa mil and diltiazem  is 
recom mended  in the setting  of a prolonged  PR interval  (greater  than 200 msec), 
sinus bradycardia  (less than  60 beats  per minute),  or second  or third  degree  heart 
block,  unless the  subject  has a  permanent  pacemaker.  
 
• Strong CYP3A4 indu cers may decrease  plasma pazopanib  concentrations.  
Selection  of an alternate  conco mitant medication  with no or minimal enzy me 
induction  potential  is required.  Drugs that induce  CYP3A4 and may decrease  
pazopanib  and everolimus  plasma concent rations  include  (but are  not limited 
to): 
• Glucocorticoids : cortisone  (>50  mg), hydroco rtisone  (>40  mg), prednisone  
(>10  mg), methylprednisolone  (>8 mg), dexa methasone  (>1.5  mg) 
• Anticonvulsants : phenytoin,  carbamezepi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  phenobarbital,  oxcarbazepi [INVESTIGATOR_050] 
• HIV  antivi rals: efavirenz,  nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]  
• Antibiotic s: rifampin (rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513]),  rifabutin,  rifapentene  
• Miscella neous: St. John’s Wort, modafinil,  pi[INVESTIGATOR_051],  troglitazone  
 
Everoli mus may affect the response to  vaccinations  making  the response to  the 
vaccination  less effecti ve. Live vaccines  should  be avoided  while  a patient  is 
treated with everoli mus. 
 
Vaccinatio ns 
Immunosuppressa nts may affect  the response  to vaccination  and vacci nation  during 
treatment with everolimus may therefore  be less effective.  The use of live  vaccines 
should  be avoided  during  treatment with everolimus  Examples of live  vaccines  are: 
intranasal influenza,  measles,  mumps, rubella,  oral polio,  BCG, yellow  fever, 
varicella,  and TY21a  typhoid  vaccines.

6.[ADDRESS_513445] frequently  observed with everolimus are rash, sto matitis/oral mucositis, 
fatigue,  headache,  anorexia,  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea.  Infections  have  not been  notably 
frequent  or severe.  Non-infectious  pneumonitis  has also  been observed.  The majority  of these 
AEs have  been  of mild to moderate  severity  (CTC grade  1-2). Overall,  the most frequently 
observed  laboratory  abnormalities  include  reduced blood  counts, hyperli pi[INVESTIGATOR_407118]/or  hypertriglyceride mia. 
 
Hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_407119] a serious adverse  reaction.  It is a recognized  side-effect  of 
rapamycins.  Use of lipid -lowering  drugs should  be associated  with dietary  recom mendations. 
Monitoring  of blood  lipid levels  requires  patients  to be fasting  so that  this aspect  must be 
verified  when interpreting results.  
 
Hyperglyce mia was reported  as a serious adv erse reaction.  Similarly,  the fasting  state of 
patients  should  be verified  when interpreting  results.  
 
Pneu monitis  is a recognized  adverse  effect  of rapamycins  (siroli mus, temsirolimus, and 
everoli mus). Numerous  case reports  in the literature  suggest that  rapamycin-associated 
pneu monitis  is relatively  unaggres sive, limited in extent,  and reversi ble upon drug 
discontinuation.  The term ‘pneu monitis’ is used here  to describe  non-infectious,  nonmalignant 
infiltration  in the lungs  which  is evident  radiologically.  More precise  diagnosis  should  follow 
histocytological  examinat ion following  lung biopsy,  generally  during  bronchoscopy  which 
may or may not be symptomatic. Advice  on the  manage ment of pneu monitis  has been 
provided  in Table  6.2.3. In  oncology  studies  with everoli mus, severe  pneu monitis  suspected  as 
drug-related has been  reported  as a serious adv erse event on 13 occasions  and additionally in  
the following  associated  preferred  terms including  acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_407120] (n=2),  
alveolitis  (n=1) and allergic alveolitis  (n=1),  interstitial  lung disease  (n=10),  lung infiltration  
(n=23),  cryptogenic  organizing  pneu monia,  lung consolidation,  pulmonary alvealoar  
haemorrhage,  pulmonary  toxicity  and pulmonary  fibrosis (n=1,  each). One fatal  case of drug -
related  pneumonitis  was r eported  for a patie nt with metastatic  infiltrating ductal car cinoma of 
the breast  treated with 10 mg/day,  which  
developed  approxi mately  two months  after starting everolimus.  Cytology  for both  the pleural 
and pericardial  fluids  were  positive  for malignancy.  The death  was considered  possibly  related  
to the underl ying late stage  tumor and study drug. Additio nally, one patient  treated  
Everolimus -Pazopanib Phase I  
v. 11/3/16 
- 52 -  
  
 
with 10 mg/day died due to severe  acute  respi[INVESTIGATOR_407121]. 
Thoracic  CT scan demonstrated  condensation  in the majority  of the left lower lobe and 
frosted  glass appearance  in the left upper  lobe,  lingula,  and right lung.  Along with  the cases 
of non -infectious  pneu monitis,  serious opportunistic  infecti ons have  also been  reported in 
cancer  patients treated  with everolimus:  mycobactriu m, aspergillus,  and fatal candid al sepsis, 
and fatal pneu mocystis  carnii  in particular.  Because everolimus,  as other  rapamycins,  inhibits 
proliferation  of activated  lymphocytes  and reduces  neutrophil  counts,  treatment with 
everoli mus must  be considered  as predisposing  patients to the risk of i nfection.  This risk will 
be higher  in patie nts severely  immunoco mpromised because  of their underlying  disease  and/or 
co-medications.  Outco me may be fatal in case of serious infections.  
 
A reduction  in blood  cell counts  is frequent  when  everoli mus therapy  is initiated.  Without 
clinical significance  and infrequentl y, anemia and thrombocytopenia  have  been  reported.  In 
heavily  pretreated  patie nts with aggressive  lymphoma, the incidence  of grade  3 ane mia, 
neutropenia,  and thrombocytopenia  was reported  to be 11%, 16%, and  30%, respectively. 
Serious, suspected  drug-related  hemorrhages  have  been  exceptional.  Nevertheless, 
everoli mus should  be considered  as predisposing  patients  to hemorrhage,  potentially  fatal, 
should  they develop  severe  drug-related  thrombocytopenia.  
 
Discrete,  reversible  changes  in liver enzy mes have  been  found to  occur  in numerous  patients 
during  treatment with everoli mus in oncology  clinical studies,  and in a study  in rheumatoid 
arthritis.  In oncology  studies,  these  changes  may be evident  only in patients  without  severe 
underlying  morbidity.  The increase  in transa minase’s  (AST and  ALT)  generally  appears  after 
4 weeks of treat ment. In all  but a few cases  it does not  exceed  Grade  1 (≤ 2.[ADDRESS_513446]).  
 
Similarly,  mild increases  in alkaline  phosphatases  can coexist.  Spontaneous  corrections  or 
intermittent  correction  with continued treatment can occur.  Serum  biliru bin is not increased. 
In studies  of patients  with advanced  cancers,  clinically  relevant changes  in liver enzy mes 
have  been  invaria bly associated  with the presence of liver  metastases  and/or  progression of 
the underlying  cancer.  
 
Renal  failure  has been  reported  in five suspected  cases  to date.  One patient  with no 
alternative  explanation  made a complete  recovery  following  study  drug adjust ment and no 
treatment/therapy  for the  event.  The rest or the  patients had concurre nt morbiditi es, which 
might have  contributed  to the reported events.  
 
Hypophosphate mia, hypo magnese mia, hyponatre mia and hypocalce mia have  been  reported 
as serious adverse  reactions.  Electrolytes  should  be monitored  in patients  treated  with 
everoli mus.

headache,  abdo minal pain,  rash, asparta te aminontransferase  (AST) and  alanine 
aminontransferase  (ALT)  increases,  constipation,  cough,  and arthralgia.  Most of these  events 
were  Grade  1 or 2 using  the NCI Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse Events  Version  
4.0 (NCI -CTCAE). The  most frequent  Grade  [ADDRESS_513448] and  ALT  increa ses. Less common  AEs of note  include  hand -foot 
syndro me, mucositi s/stomatitis,  proteinuria, venous thrombotic  events, and bleeding. 
Intestinal perforations  and arterial  thromboses  were  uncom mon. 
 
The most common  serious adverse  events  (SAEs)  occurring  in subjects  enrolled  in pazopanib 
studies  regardless  of treat ment assign ment include  vomiting,  diarrhea,  abdo minal pain, 
hypertension/hypertensive  crisis,  dyspnea,  pleural  effusion,  pyrexia,  anemia, dehydration,  
and pulmonary  embolism.  
 
Evaluation  of the  safety  and efficacy  of pazopanib  in advanced  RCC  subjects  include  a 
recently  completed  Phase II study  in subje cts with advanced  RCC,  and a Phase III 
rando mized,  double -blind  study  against  placebo  which  completed  enrol ment in April,  2007 
and is currently  on-going.  To date,  660 subje cts with advanced/ metastatic  RCC  have  been 
enrolled  in these  two clinical  trials.  Safety data from  the Phase II RCC  trial VEG102616  
(n=225)  are summarized  here.  The most  common AEs (defined  as AEs experienced  by ≥10% 
of subjects)  regardless  of caus ality in decreasing  order  of frequency  were  diarrhea  (63%), 
fatigue  (46%), hair  color  change (43%), nausea  (42%), hypert ension  (41%), anorexia  (24%),

(12%), back  pain (12%), dizziness  (12%), handfoot  syndro me (11%), alopecia,  (10%), 
dyspepsia  (10%), and  peripheral  edema (10%).  The majority  of these  events  were  Grade  1 
and 2 with  hypertension  being  observed  in 9% of subjects  as a Grade  [ADDRESS_513449] common  hematological  toxicities  of any grade  (graded  accor ding to NCI-CTCAE) 
include  lymphopenia  (47%), thro mbocytopenia  (28%), neutropenia  (23%), and  anemia (26%) 
with combined  Grade  3 and  4 abnormalities  occurring  in 7%, 3%, <1%,  and 4% of subjects, 
respectively.  The most common chemistry abnor mality was hyperglyce mia, observed  in 46% 
of subjects  (of which  2% were  Grade  3 and  no Grade  4). Hyponatre mia of any  grade  was 
observed  in 37% of subjects,  with Grade  3 or Grade  4 hyponatre mia in 8% of subjects. 
Hyperkale mia of any  grade  was reported  in 27% of subjects,  with Grade  3 or 4 hyperkale mia 
in 5% of subjects.  Hyponatre mia and hyperkale mia have  not occurred  concurrently  in the sa me 
subject  to indicate adrenal  insufficiency.  Elevations  in amylase  and lipase  of any  grade were  
reported  in 23% and  27% of subjects,  respectively,  with Grade  3 or Grade  4 events  in 
4% and  9% of subjects,  respecti vely. There  were  2 reports  of pancreatitis.  Increase  in TSH 
was reported  in 28% of subjects  and a decrease  in thyroxine  (T4) in 1% of subjects.  Three 
subje cts initiated  treatment with thyroid replacement therapy  (synthro id or levothyroxine) 
during  the study.  
 
ALT  elevations  of any  Grade  were  reported  in 53% of subjects  with Grade  3 and  Grade  4 
elevations  in 9% and  <1%  of subjects,  respe ctively.  AST elevations  were  reported  in 53% of

Hyperbilirubine mia of any Grade  occurred  in 28% of subjects  with Grade  3 elevations  in 
<1%  of subjects.  No Grade  [ADDRESS_513450]  been  observed  in 2 (<1%)  subjects.  Neither  of these  patients 
met the criteria for Hy’s rule.  Risk factors  that may have  contributed  to the liver dysfunction 
were  identified  in the some of these  subjects,  (e.g.,  large  mass at the porta  hepatis,  
hepatotoxic  conco mitant medications).  Liver  enzyme elevations  were  reversible  upon dose 
interruption.  Two patterns  of transaminase  changes  have  been  observed:  
(1) transa minase elevations  that decli ned over time without  dose interruption.  
(2) transa minase elevations  that declined  over time upon do se interrupti on. In some subjects, 
elevations  in transa minase recurred  upon rechalleng ing and these  subjects  were  permanently 
discontinued  from  study  treatment. 
 
Serial  adrenocorticotropic  hormone (ACTH) st imulation  tests were  conducted  in two Phase I 
and two Phase II trials  in cancer  subjects  with data available  in 47 subjects.  Twenty -one of 
them  had data beyond  24 weeks and  5 subjects  had data beyond  52 weeks. None of these  47 
subjects  had adrenal  insufficiency.  
 
Certain  uncommon AEs with  significant  clinical  consequences  reported  in pazopanib  clinical

Stomatitis/ oral mucositis/ mouth ulcers  due to everolimus should  be treated  using  local 
supportive  care.  Investigators  in earlier trials  have  described  the oral toxicities  associated 
with everolimus  as mouth ulcers,  rather than mucositis  or stomatitis.  If the examination 
reveals  mouth ulcers  rather  than a more  general  inflammation  of the  mouth, the adverse  
event  should  be classified  as mouth ulcers.  Please follow  the paradigm  below  for 
treatment of sto matitis/oral mucositis/mouth  ulcers: 
1. For mild toxicity  (Grade  1), use  conservative  measures  such as non-alcoholic  mouth 
wash or  salt water (0.9%) mouth wash several  times a day until resolution.  
2. For more severe  toxicity  (Grade  [ADDRESS_513452]  pain but are able to 
maintain  adequate  oral alimentation,  or Grade  3 in which  case patients  cannot  maintain 
adequate  oral alimentati on), the suggested  treatments  are topi[INVESTIGATOR_407124]  (i.e., local  anesthetics  such as benzocaine,  butyl aminoben zoate, 
tetracaine  hydrochlori de, menthol, or  phenol) with or without  topic al 
corticoster oids, such as tria mcinolone  oral paste 0.1% (Kenalog  in Orabase®).  
3. Agents containing  hydrogen  peroxide,  iodine,  and thyme derivatives  may tend to 
worsen mouth ulcers.  It is preferable  to avoid  these  agents.  
4. Antifungal  agents  must be avoided  unless a  fungal  infection  is diagnosed.  In particular, 
syste mic imidazole  antifungal  agents  (keto conazole,  fluconazole,  itraconazole,  etc.) 
should  be avoided  in all patients  due to their strong inhibition  of everoli mus 
metabolis m, thereby  [CONTACT_407189]. Therefore,  topi[INVESTIGATOR_407125] -Pazopanib Phase I  
v. 11/3/[ADDRESS_513453] ion is diagnosed.  Similarly,  antiviral  agents 
such as acyclovir  should  be avoided  unless  a viral infection  is diagnosed.  
 
Note:  Stomatitis/ oral mucositis  should be appropriately  graded  using  the functional 
grading  given  on the  NCI-CTC for adverse  events,  CTCAE  v 4.0.  Dose reductions  are 
made according  to section 6.3.1 (Non -hematological  toxicity) and Section  6.3.3.

(e.g. 
hyperglycemia, 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]) Grade [ADDRESS_513454] erolemia (>300  mg/dL  or 7.75 mmol/L) or  grade  2 
hypertriglyceride mia or higher  (>2.5x  upper  normal limit) should  be treated with  a 3-hydroxy -3- 
methyl -glutaryl (HMG) -CoA  reduct ase inhibitor  (e.g. atorvastat in, pravastatin,  fluvastatin)  or 
appropriate  triglyceride -lowering  medication,  in addition  to diet. 
 
Note:  Conco mitant therapy  with fibrates  and an HMG -CoA  reductase  inhibitor is associated  with 
an increased  risk of a rare but serious skeletal  muscle  toxicity  manifested by [CONTACT_407190], 
markedly  elevated  creatine  phosphokinase  (CPK)  levels  and myoglobinuria, acute  renal  failure 
and sometimes death.  The risk versus  benefit  of using  this therapy  should  be deter mined for 
individual  patients  based  on their  risk of ca rdiovascular  complications  of hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_30192]. 
 
Dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_30192] (including  hypercholesterole mia and hypertriglyceride mia) has been  reported  in 
patients  taking  everolimus.  Monit oring of blood  cholester ol and triglycerides prior to the  start of 
everoli mus therapy  and perio dically  thereafter  as well as manage ment with  appropriate  medical 
therapy  is recommended.  
 
Hyperglyce mia has been  reported  in patients  taking  everoli mus. Monitoring  of fasting  serum 
glucose  is  recom mended prior  to  the  start of  everoli mus and  periodic ally thereafter.  More 
frequent  monitoring  is recom mended when  everoli mus is co-administer ed with  other  drugs  that 
may induce  hyperglyce mia. Optimal glyce mic control  should  be achie ved before  starting  a 
patient  on everoli mus.

6.2.3 Management  of non-infectio us pneumonitis  
 
Both  asymptomatic radiological  changes  (grade 1) and  symptomatic non-infectious 
pneu monitis  (grade  2 = not interfering with activities  of daily  living  or grade 3 = 
interfering  with activities  of daily  living  and oxygen  indicated)  have  been  noted  in patients  
receiving  everolimus  therapy.  Non-infectious  pneu monitis has been  associated with  
everolimus  and other  mTOR inhibitors  (Atkins 2004). In order  to monitor  for 
asymptomatic (grade 1) pul monary  infiltrates, a chest  X-ray is required if a CT scan of 
chest  is not used for bi -monthly  disease  evaluations.  Additional  chest  CT scans may be 
perfor med, when clinically  necessary.  If noninfectious  pneumonitis  develops,  a 
consultation  with a pulmonologist  should  be considered.  If the  patient develops  grade  3 
pneu monitis,  treatment with everolimus  should  be interru pted and the patie nt should  be 
treated  as medically  indicated  (short course  corticosteroids,  oxygen,  etc). Manage ment of 
non-infecti ous pneu monitis  suspected  to be associated  with everoli mus and dose

6.2.4  Management  of hepatitis  reactivation  / flare  
 
Reactivation of  Hepatitis  B (HBV)  has been  observed in patients  with cancer receiving 
chemotherapy  (Yeo  2004).  Sporadic  cases  of Hepatitis B  reactivation  have  also been  seen in this 
setting  with everoli mus. Use of antivir als during anti-cancer  therapy  has been  shown  to reduce 
the risk of Hepatitis  B virus  reacti vation  and associated morbidity  and mortality  (Loomba  2008). 
A detailed  assess ment of Hepatitis  B/C medical  history and risk factors  must be done  for all 
patients  at screening,  with testing  perfor med prior  to the first dose of everoli mus. 
 
Monito ring and prophylactic  treatment  for hepatitis  B reactivation

Monito ring for hepatitis  C flare  
 
The following  two categories  of patients  should  be monitored  every  4–8 weeks for HCV flare:  
 
• Patie nts with detectable HCV  RNA -PCR test  at scree ning. 
 
• Patients  known  to have  a history  of HCV  infection,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_040]  a negative  viral load test at 
screening  (including  those  that were  treated  and are considered  ‘cured’)

Recommendations  for everoli mus and pazopanib  dose interruptions/ modifications  in case of 
liver-related  treatment-emergent  AEs are  provided below.  As a general  rule, since  many 
subjects  are taking  multiple  concurrent  medications,  it is critical  to (a) do a thorough 
evaluation  of the  subject’s  concurrent  medications, and (b) identify and discontinue  those 
with known hepatotoxicity  and replace  with a non-hepatotoxic  equivalent  for the  same 
indication  if necessary.

Everolimus -Pazopanib Phase I  
v. 11/3/[ADDRESS_513513]– Solid Tumors  
Response a nd progres sion will be evaluated  in this study  using the new i nternational 
criteri a propose d by [CONTACT_407201] e Evaluatio n Criteri a in Solid Tumor s (RECIST) 
Com mittee v. 1.[ADDRESS_513514] diameter (unidimensional 
measure ment) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 
10.1. [ADDRESS_513515] one (1) lesion 
that can be accurately measure d in at least one dimension with longest diameter  >20 
millimeters (mm) using conventiona l techniques (CT, MR1, x-ray) or  >[ADDRESS_513516] be recorde d in millimeter s (or decimal fraction s of centi meters).  
 
Malignant  lymph nodes:  To be considered  pathologically  enlarged  and measurable,  a lymph 
node  must be ≥ 15mm  in short axis  when assessed by [CONTACT_407202] (CT scan slice thickness 
recom mended  to be no greater  than 5 mm). At baseline  and in follow -up, only the short axis 
will be measured  and followed.  
 
A lesion  in a previously  irradia ted area is not eligible for measurable  disease unless there  is 
objective  evidence  of progression of  the lesion  prior  to study  enroll ment. Lesions  in 
previou sly irradiated  areas  must be clearly  identified  as such.  
 
Non-measurable  diseas e. All other lesion s (or sites of disease) , includin g small lesions 
(longes t diameter <20 mm with conventiona l technique s or <[ADDRESS_513517] scan), 
are cons idered non-measurabl e disease. Bone lesions , leptomeningeal  disease,  ascites, 
pleur al/pericardial effusions,  lymphangitis  cutis/pul monis,  inflammatory  breast  disease, 
Everolimus -Pazopanib Phase I  
v. 11/3/16 
- 77 -  
  
 
abdo minal masses  (not followed  by [CONTACT_370416]),  and cystic  lesions  are all considered  non- 
measurable.  
 
 
Target  lesions. All measurabl e lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesion s per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs , shoul d be identified as targe t lesions 
and recorded and measured at baseline . Target lesions should be selecte d on the basis of their 
size (lesion s with the longes t diameter ) and their suitabilit y for accurat e repeated 
measurements (eithe r by [CONTACT_407203] s or clinically) . A sum of the longes t diameter 
(LD) for all targe t lesion s will be calculated and repor ted as the baseline sum. If lymph 
node s are to be include d in the sum, then as noted above , only the short axis of the 
lymph node is adde d into the sum. The baseli ne sum will be used as the reference by 
[CONTACT_407204].  
 
 
Lymph nodes.  Lymph nodes  identified  as target  lesions  should  always  have  the actual  short 
axis measure ment recorded  (measured  in the same anato mical plane as the  baseline 
examination),  even  if the nodes regress to  below  10mm  on study.  This means  that when 
lymph nodes are included  as tar get lesions,  the ‘sum’ of lesions  may not be zero even  if 
complete  response criteria  are met, since  a normal lymph node  is defined  as having  a short 
axis of <10mm.  Case  report  forms or oth er data collection  methods  may therefore  be 
designed  to have  target  nodal  lesions  recorded  in a separate  section  where,  in order  to qualify  
for CR,  each node  must achieve  a short  axis <10m m. For PR,  SD and  PD, the  actual short 
axis measure ment of the  nodes is  to be included  in the sum of target  lesions.  
 
 
Non-target lesions . All other lesion s (or sites of disease ) includin g any measurabl e lesions over 
and above  the [ADDRESS_513518]  of a treatment. 
 
 
Clinical  lesions . Clinica l lesion s will only be considere d measurabl e when they are superficial 
(e.g. , skin nodule s and palpabl e lymp h nodes) . For the case of skin lesions, 
docu mentatio n by [CONTACT_6775] , includin g a ruler to estimate the size of the  lesion, is 
recom mended.  
Everolimus -Pazopanib Phase I  
v. 11/3/[ADDRESS_513519] x-ray are acceptabl e as measurabl e lesion s when they are 
clearl y defined and surrounde d by [CONTACT_6776]; howeve r, CT is preferable. 
 
Conventional  CT and MRI. Thes e technique s shoul d be perfor med with cuts of [ADDRESS_513520], abdomen , and pelvis . Head  
and neck tumor s and those of extremitie s usuall y require specific protocols. 
 
 
10.1.4  Response Criteria  
10.1.4. 1 Evaluation  of Target  Lesions  
Complete  Respon se (CR) : Disappea rance of all targe t lesions.  
 
 
Partial  Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter 
(LD) of target lesions (or short axis for lymph nodes) , takin g as referenc e the 
basel ine sum. 
 
Progress ive Disease  (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the targe t lesions, 
takin g as referen ce the s m a l l e s t s u m r e c o r d e d s i n c e t h e treatment starte d or the 
appearan ce of one or more new lesions (new  lesions must be > slice thickness).  
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither  sufficient  shrinkage  to qualify  for PR nor sufficient 
increas e to qualif y for PD, takin g as refere nce the smalles t sum since the 
treatment started.  
 
 
Unknow n (UN) : Assess ment of targe t lesion s canno t be made due to insufficien t or 
unevaluabl e data. In this case, a concise explanation must be given.  
 
Note : If tumo r respons e data is missing , an overal l assess ment canno t be done. 
However , if there is missing or unevaluabl e data for non-targe t lesions , but data is 
availabl e for all targe t lesio ns, the overall response for that time point will be assigned 
based on the sum of all targe t lesions . Additionally , the assess ment of CR canno t be 
made if there is missing or unevaluabl e data for non-targe t lesions . In this case, the 
overal l assess ment woul d be PR. 
 
10.1.4. 2 Evaluatio n of Non-Targe t Lesions  
Complete  Response (CR): Disappearance  of all  non-target  lesions  and 
normalizatio n of tumor marker level.  
 
Note : If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a subjec t to be conside red in complet e clinical response 
Incomplete Response/Stable Diseas e (SD): Persistence  of one or more non- 
target lesions and/or  maintenance  of tumor marker  level above the normal limits. 
Everolimus -Pazopanib Phase I  
v. 11/3/16 
- 79 -  
  
 
Progressive   Diseas e  (PD) :  Appearanc e  of  one  or  more  new  lesions  (new 
lesion s must be > slice thickness ) and/or unequivocal  progression  of existing 
non-target  lesions.  
 
Unknow n (UN) : Assess ment of targe t lesion s canno t be made due to insufficien t or 
unevaluabl e data. In this case, a concise explanation must be given.  
 
 
Note : Althoug h a clear progressio n of "non -target " lesion s only is exceptional , in 
such circu mstances, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_407138] g physic ian should prevail and the 
progression  status  should  be confirmed  at a later time by [CONTACT_407205] (or Protoc ol Chair). Additionally , the cytologica l confirmation of the 
neoplasti c origi n of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment is 
mandator y to differentiat e between stable or progressive disease status. 
 
 
10.1.4. [ADDRESS_513521] response recorded  from  the start of the  treatment 
until diseas e progression/recurrenc e (takin g as referenc e for progressive disease the 
smallest  measure ments recorded  since the treatment  started) . The partic ipant's best

http://ctep.cancer.gov/ reporting//ctc.ht ml. 
 
Infor mation  on all  adverse events,  whether  reported  by [CONTACT_407206], directly  observed, 
or detected  by [CONTACT_30417],  laboratory  test or other  means,  will be collected, 
recorded,  followed  and reported  as described  in the following  sections.  
 
Adverse ev ents expe rienced by [CONTACT_407207],  throughout  the study,  and within  30 days (or 5 half -lives,  whichever 
is longer)  of the  last dose of study  medic ation. Participants  who experience  an ongoing 
adverse  event  or related  to a study  procedures  and/or  study  medication  beyond  [ADDRESS_513524]-study  event(s)  that might 
reasona bly be related  to particip ation in this study.  The investigator  should  notify  the IRB 
and any other  applicable  regulatory  agency  of any unanticipated  death  or adverse  event  
occurring  after a participant  has discontinued  or ter minated  study  participation  that may 
reasonably  be related  to the study.  
 
11.2 Definitions  
 
11.2.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
 
An adverse  event  is any undesirable  sign,  symptom  or medical  condition  or 
experience  that develops  or worsens in  severity after starting the first dose of study  
treatment or any  procedure  specified  in the protocol,  even  if the event  is not 
considered  to be related  to the study.  
 
Abno rmal laboratory  values  or diagnostic  test results  constitute  adverse  events 
only if they induce  clinical  signs or s ymptoms or require  treatment or further 
diagnostic  tests.  
 
11.2.2  Serious  adverse  event (SAE)  
 
A serious a dverse  event is an undesirable  sign, sympto m, or medical  condition 
which:  
• is fatal or life-threateni ng; 
• requires  or prolongs inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
Everolimus -Pazopanib Phase I  
v. 11/3/16 
- 82 -  
  
 
• results  in persistent or signi ficant  disability/inca pacity; 
• constitutes  a congenital  anomaly or birth  defect;  or 
• jeopar dizes the partici pant and requires  medical  or surgical  intervention  to 
prevent  one of the  outco mes listed  above.  
 
Events  not considered  to be serious adverse  events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15976]: 
• routine  treatment or monitoring  of the  studied  indication,  not associated 
with any deterioration  in condition,  or for elective  procedures  
• elective  or pre -planned  treatment for a pre-existing  condition  that did not 
worsen  
• emergency  outpatient  treatment for an  event  not fulfilling  the serio us 
criteria  outlined  above  and not resulting  in inpatient  admission  
• respi[INVESTIGATOR_407139]’s  general  condition  
 
11.2.3  Expectedness  
 
Adve rse event s can be 'Expected' or 'Unexpected.'  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expected  adverse  event 
 
Expected  adverse  events are those that have  been  previou sly identified  as 
resulting  from  administration  of the  agent.  For the  purposes of this  study, 
an adver se event  is considered  expected  when it  appears  in the curre nt 
adverse  event list, the Investi gator’s Brochure,  the package  insert  or is 
included  in the infor med conse nt document as a potential  risk. 
 
Refe r to Sectio n 6.1 for a listin g of expecte d adverse event s assoc iated

[IP_ADDRESS].  Unexpected  adverse  event  
 
For the  purposes of this  study,  an adverse  event  is considered  unexpected  
when it  varies in nature, inten sity or frequency  from  information  
provided  in the current  adverse  event  list, the Investigator’s Brochure, 
the packa ge insert  or when it is not included  in the infor med consent 
docu ment as a potential  risk. 
 
11.2.4  Attribution  
 
Attrib ution is the relationship  betw een an adverse  event  or serious adverse  event 
and the study treatment. Attrib ution will be assigned as follows: 
 
• Definite – The AE is clearly related to the study  treatment. 
• Probable  – The AE is likely  related  to the study  treatment.

11.4 Reporting Adverse Events  
 
Each  adver se event  will be asses sed to determine if it meets the criteria  for serious 
adverse  event.  If a serious adverse  event  occurs,  expedited  reporting  will follow  local 
policies, and federal  guidelines and regulations  as appropriate.  
 
It is the responsibility  of the participating investigator to notify the Principal 
Investigator  (or Protocol  Chair), IRB,  and others  of all serious adverse  events  as 
required  in the protocol.  
 
The Principal  Investigator  (or Protocol  Chair)  will provide  infor mation  with respect  to 
adverse  events  and safe use of the  study  treatment (e.g.,  safety  reports,  Action  Letters) 
to all participating  investi gators  as soon as the  information  beco mes available.  
 
 
 
All SAEs, regardless  of “expectedness”  or “causality”  must be reported  to the Principal 
Investigator  (or Protocol  Chair), [CONTACT_407235] merantz,  via fax within  24 hours of 
learning of the  event.  In the  event that the participating  investigator  does not  beco me 
aware  of the  serious adverse  event  immed iately  (e.g.,  participant  sought  treatment 
elsewhere),  the partici pating  investigator is to report the event  within  [ADDRESS_513526]  infor mation  for SAE reporting  is as follows:

or within  [ADDRESS_513527] report  each serious  adverse event, 
regardless  attribution,  to the Principal  Investigator  (or Protocol  Chair)  within  
24 hours of learning  of the  occurrence.  In the  event  that the participating 
investigator  does not  become aware  of the  serious  adverse  event  immediately 
(e.g.,  participant  sought  treatment elsewhere),  the participat ing investigator  is 
to report  the event  within  [ADDRESS_513528] provide 
follow -up information  on the  serious adverse  event.  Follow -up infor mation 
should  describe  whether  the event  has resolved  or continues,  if and how the 
event  was t reated,  and whether  the participa nt will continue  or disco ntinue study  
participation.  The principal  investi gator has the  obligation  to report  all serious 
adverse  events to the FDA, IRB,  [COMPANY_001]  Pharmaceuticals  Drug Safety and  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_407140] (DS&E), and  Glaxo -Smithkline.  All events reported  
to the FDA by [CONTACT_407209]  
3500A (Med Watch Form). All events must be reported  to both [COMPANY_001]  
Pharmaceuticals  DS&E Department [by [CONTACT_46465] (877 -778-9739)], and to

14. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
This is a standar d 3+3 desig n Phase I study with an expansio n cohor t at the recommended  
Phas e II dose to furthe r explor e the activit y and safet y of the regimen. 
 
14.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
Phase I:  
The primary endpoint  is to deter mine the MTD and DLT’s of the  combination  of everoli mus and 
pazopanib.  Safety and incidence  of dose-limiting toxicities will be the primary outcome 
parameters.  All patients  in a dose cohort  will complete  28 days (1 cycle)  of combination tre atment 
prior  to the treatment of any patie nt at a higher  dose level.  If a patient  does not co mplete the [ADDRESS_513538]  3+3 Phase I methodolo gy and dose escalation  rules  (descri bed in detail 
in Section  5.3.1). Once  it is docu mented  that the last patient  in a cohort  has co mpleted  28 days of  
Everolimus -Pazopanib Phase I  
v. 11/3/16 
- 91 -  
  
 
therapy  without evide nce of exc essive  dose li miting toxicity,  approval  will be requested  from  the 
DF/HCC DSMB for dose escalation  to the next dose lev el will occur.  Successi ve cohorts of 
patie nts will be accrued to deter mine the maximum tolerated  dose that  results in <33% dose- 
limiting toxicities  with the combination  of evero limus and pazopanib  in patients  with metastatic  
kidney  cancer.  Up to  six patients  will be treated  at the MTD before  proceeding  to the expansion 
cohort.  
 
The assess ment of safety will be based mainly  on the  frequen cy of adverse  events  and on the 
number of laboratory  values  that fall outside  of pre -deter mined ranges.  Toxicities  will be 
summarized  as nu mber and percent  of patients,  separately  by [CONTACT_42376].  Other  safety  data (e.g. 
electrocardiogra m, vital signs, special tests) will be considered  as appropriate.  
 
Adverse  events will be summarized by  [CONTACT_1601],  for each dose cohort,  the number and 
perce ntage of  patients  having  any adverse  event, having  an adverse  event  in each body system, 
and having  each individual adverse  event.  Any other  infor mation collected  (e.g. severity  or 
relatedne ss to study  medic ation) will  be listed  as appropriate. Descriptive  statistics  will be 
calculated  to characterize  the disease  and previous  treatment features  as well as the details  of 
protoc ol therapy.  Toxicities will  be tabulated  by [CONTACT_407218] I study.  
 
The probabilities  of dose escalation  for vario us true DLT  rates  are summarized  below:  
 
 True  Probability  of DLT  at Current  Dose  
 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.70 
Probability  that 
dose is  escalated   
0.91  
0.71  
0.49  
0.31  
0.17  
0.08  
0.03 
 
 
Expansion  cohort:  
 
The primary objective  is to evaluate the safety and efficacy  of the  combination  of 
pazopanib  and everolimus  in previously treated  advanced  urothelial  carcino ma patients. 
The proportion  of patients  achieving  objective  response (OR) defined  as co mplete  or 
partial  response per  RECIST  criteria  as their  best overall  response is  the primary 
endpoint.  Simon’s  two-stage  design  is employed to minimize accrual  if treatment with 
pazopanib  and everolimus  is not effective.  Achieving  objective  response in  this 
population  has historically  been  difficult.  There  no FDA approved  second  line therapy  for 
urothelial  cancer.  The only European  approved  therapy  in this setting  is Vinflunine  with a 
response rate of 9%.(48) The  null hypothesis  for this  study  is assumed to be 10%.  
 
 
 
Twenty -nine patie nts will be enrolled. Only eli gible patients  who sta rt protocol therapy 
will be included in the response  analysis.  The first stage will accrue  n=20 patie nts (n=18 
eligible  treated  patients).  If [ADDRESS_513539] 
stage  cohort then an additional  9 patients  will be accrued  (n=8 eligible treated  patie nts). If 
5 or more responses are  observed  in the 26 eli gible patients  who sta rted protocol  therapy  
Everolimus -Pazopanib Phase I

- 92 -  
  
 
then the combination  of pazopanib  with everolimus  will be considered  promising.  The 
operating  characteristics  of this  design are summarized  below.  If the true OR rate  is 10%,

14.4 Analysi s of Secondar y Endpoints  
Phase I:  
 
Pharmacokinetic  parameters  will be analyzed  to deter mine whether  pharmacologically 
significant  drug interactions  are present  between  everoli mus and pazopanib.  The 
concentrati on of everolimus  in whole  blood  and plasma will be deter mined using  a 
validated  assay involving  high perfor mance liquid  chromatography  with electrospray 
ionization  mass spectro metric detection.  Time points  will be deter mined as the  
difference  between  the midpoint  of the  blood  collection  interval  and starting  time of dose 
administration.  Concentration -time profiles will be analyzed  by [CONTACT_407219]/or  nonlinear  least squares r egression  using  Professional  version  4.0.1 
software  package  (Pharsight  Corp., Cary,  NC).  Phar macokinetic  parameters  and

PK para meters (Ctroug h, T1/2  and Cmax) will be provided  by [CONTACT_42376].  
 
Secondary  
 
Secondary  endpoints  will evaluate  safety,  progression -free survival  (PFS),  overall 
survival  (OS) and  duration  of response. D uration  of response is  calculated  for objective 
responders and  defined  as the  time in months  from  the first observation  of a response 
(e.g.,  the first time that the appropriate  RECIST  1.1 criteria  was observed  for confir med 
responders) to  the first docu mented  progre ssion or death  due to any cause,  whichever 
occurs  first. Duration  of response is  censored  at the date of last  disease  evaluation  for 
patients  who are  known to be alive  and who have  not relapsed  after a CR or PR. 
Progression -free survival  is calculated  as the  months  between  registration  and 
docu mented  PD as deter mined by [CONTACT_393]  1.1, or death  due to any cause,  whichever 
occurs  first. Overall  survival is defined as the  time in months  from  registration  to death 
due to any cause  or, censored  at the date last known alive.  Patients  alive  without  disease  
progres sion will be censored at the date of last disease  evaluation.  Time to event  data will 
be estimated with the Kaplan -Meier  method.  Efficacy will further  be described  by 4- and 
12-month PFS and  OS rates  along  with 90% CIs. Descriptive  statistics  will be used to  
characterize  the disease and previous treatment features  as well as the  details  of protocol 
therapy.  
 
Toxicity  
 
All patients  who recei ve treatment will be included  in toxicity  analy ses. A summary  of 
the incidence of all treatment-related grade  3-5 toxicities  will be provided  as maximum 
grade  by [CONTACT_407220]. Any  other infor mation  collected  (e.g. severity  or 
relatedness  to study  medication)  will be listed as appropriate.  Overall  maximum grade  3 
or higher  treatment-related toxicity  rates  in all treated patients will be calculated.  The 
table  below  shows  the 90%  confidence  intervals  for 0, 2, 4, and 6 patients  with grade  3 or 
higher  toxicity  in a total of 29 treated  patients.

Patie nts who did not receive  any dose of study  medication  will not be included  in the 
analy sis.  Each  participant  will  be  assigned  one  of  the  following  categories:  1) 
complete response,  2) partial  response,  3) stable  disease, 4)  progressive  disease, and 
unknown (not  evaluable,  insufficient  data).  
 
All  conclu sions  should  be  based  on  all  eligible  and  treated  partic ipants  who 
receive d protoco l therapy. Subanalyse s will then be performed on  the basis of a 
subset  of participants,  exclud ing those for whom major protocol deviations have been 
identified. However , these subanalyse s will not serve as the basis for drawing 
conclusion s concernin g treatment efficacy , and the reason s for excludin g participants 
from the analysi s will be clearl y report ed. The 95% confidenc e inte rvals will be 
provided.  
 
Pregnancy  
 
Preclinic al data  regarding reproductive  toxicity is described  in the most recent 
Investigator  Brochure.  The potential  reproductive  risk for humans is unknown.  Women 
of childbearing potential  should  be advised  to use highly  effective  contraception 
methods  while  they are receiving  everoli mus and up to [ADDRESS_513543]  be reported  to [COMPANY_001]  within  24 hours  of learning  of its occurrence. 
The pregnancy  should  be followed  up to determine outco me, including  spontaneous or 
voluntary  termination,  details  of the birth,  and the presence  or absence  of any birth

Sample  Collection  and Storage  for Pazopanib  
At each  of the  sampling  times, blood  samples (2 mL)  will be drawn into  a K3 EDTA  vacutainer, 
and centri fuged  for 10 minutes  to separ ate the plasma. The plasma will be trans ferred into pre- 
labeled  storage  tubes  for analysis  of pac litaxel  and stored  at approxi mately  -20C. Sample 
handling  from collection  to storage  should  not exceed 60 minutes.  A blo od sample will be taken 
prior  to the pazopanib  dose, and  at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours.  If patients  are treated  on dose level  
-1, there  will be a 48 hour blood  draw (pre -dose)  as well.  
 
 
All tubes  must be frozen  in an upright  position  to keep  the plasma in the bottom  of the  tube.  Until 
assayed, the samples must remain  frozen  in a freezer  set at appro ximately  -20°C  or when shippi[INVESTIGATOR_161852] a box with  dry ice.  Prior to  collection,  the collection  tube and plasma storage  tube must  be 
labeled  with the corre sponding  bar-coded  labels  provided  by [CONTACT_23983].  The  sample  labels  will 
include  Protocol  Number,  Analyte,  Subje ct Number, Relative  Sample Time, Cycle  and Dosing 
Day.  The  labels  must  be placed  along  the length of the  tube so the  bar code  can be easily  read.  
Tape  must  not be used to secure the labels otherwise  the tube will not fit into the autoan alyzer  test 
tube rack. The labels  are high quality  and will not peel off of the tube even  under  extre me 
conditions.  
 
The sample will be centrifuged  at approxi mately 1000 x g for  10 to  15 minutes.  The resulting 
plasma will be transferred  to the corresponding  pre-labeled  polypropyle ne stora ge tube (2mL). See 
shippi [INVESTIGATOR_407153], enclo sing a manifold with a sample 
inventory,  and notification  of the analytical  sites prior  to shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
Everolimus -Pazopanib Phase I  
v. 11/3/[ADDRESS_513553] a large gaug e peripheral cathete r (e.g., [ADDRESS_513554] or, or similar IV  access  device) in an arm vein 
for the collectio n of pharmacokine tic blood samples on days when multipl e sample s are to 
be collected. Maintain patency  of the cathet er between  blood  draws  using either a heparin 
lock (e.g.,  10 U/mL in normal saline)  or a slow  drip of Normal Saline  for Injection, USP 
(e.g.,  10 mL/hr). 
 
Blood  may be obtained  directly  by [CONTACT_407225] a single 
pharmacokineti c blood speci men is schedule d for collection.  
 
When  sampling  through  a catheter,  begin  to clear the catheter  approxi mately  1 min before 
the specified  sample time  by [CONTACT_407226]  0.5 mL of 
blood  into a  syringe.  Remove  and properly  dispose  the syringe  used to clear  the catheter. 
The catheter  should  be well-flushed  after collecti ng each sample. 
 
C.2 Timing 
 
A battery -powered digital  timer/stopwatch programmed  to operate  continuously  as a 24- 
hr clock will be used to accurately  monit or drug administration  and sample  collection 
times.  The same timer must  be allowed  to run without  interruption  until the last blood 
speci men has been  obtained  from  the subje ct during  the first cycle  of therapy.  
 
Timer readings will  be noted  at the preci se time that the infusion  is started and ended, as 
well as at the beginning  and ending  times of the blood  sample collection  intervals.  
 
Readings  of the digital  timer must be directly  recorded  on a copy  of the appropriate  
DF/HCC Phar macokinetic  Dosing and  Blood  Collection  Time Form'  (see below). 
C.3 Sample collection  
As indicated in  section  8.1, two blood  samples are to be collected in  2.0 mL Vacutainer 
plastic  whole  blood collection  tube with spray -coated  K2-EDTA  (Becton -Dickinson,  item 
no. 367863) at  each and every  time point.

Promptly mix the blood  collection  tubes by [CONTACT_115620]  6-times. 
 
Transfer  the whole  blood  from  one tube collected  at each time point  directly  into a 4.5 
mL self-standing  polypropylene  microcentrifu ge cryogenic  tube with external  threads 
(Fisher Scientific,  cat. no. 12 -565-291).  
 
Centrifuge the  other  tube of blood  collected  at each time point  at 1,300  x g for 10 min 
within  15 min after collection.  Separate the  plasma from  the blood  cells using  a pi[INVESTIGATOR_407154] a polypropy lene cryogenic  storage  vial with external 
threads.  
 
Affix  a pre-printed labels  (protocol  number, patient  entry  no., sample no., scheduled 
sample time) to the cryotube,  oriented  length wise toward  the upper  part of the tube.  Do 
not place  the label  over the vial cap.  Hand -written infor mation  on sample tube labels  is 
absolutely  prohibited.  
 
Completely  cover  the label  with protective c ryogenic  freezer  tape (e.g., Fisher  Scientific, 
cat. no. 11 -867B).  
 
 
Place  the tube on crushed dry-ice until stored  in a freez er maintained  at -70°C  until 
packaged  for ship ment. 
 
C.5 Time forms and sample tube/vi al labels 
 
 
Computer  files for dose administration and  sample collecti on time forms and speci men 
tube labels  will be placed  in a subdirec tory located  on a secure  network  server 
(W:\PHASE1RD)  maintained  by [CONTACT_407227]  (PHS)  Infor mation 
Resources.   All members of the clinical,  laboratory,  and administrative  staff involved 
with Phase  I studies  should  have read-only access  to this subdirectory,  which  may be 
obtained  by [CONTACT_407228] (see PHS Global  e-mail directory).  
 
The files are placed  under  the following subdirectories:    PK_T ime_For ms; 
PK_Tube_Labels.  
 
Files  for the PK time forms are to be printed directly from  the file stored  on the network 
server  for each subject  study.  Since  changes  may be periodically  made to these  forms, 
they should  not be copi[INVESTIGATOR_407155]. 
 
The PK_Tube_Label  files are templates that are intended  to be copi[INVESTIGATOR_407156]  'code'  with the patient entry number using  the MS Word  edit/replace 
all function  and printed  on an Avery  5260  label sheet.   Hand -written  infor mation  on 
sample tube labels  is absolut ely prohibited.  There  are separate sets of labels  for blood 
collection  tubes  and sample  storage tubes.  Blood  collection  tubes should  be pre-labeled.

Methodology/Study Design:
 

PXVX0317 Vaccine  
EBSI-C V-317-004, Version 5.0 20 Mar 2023 
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietar y Page 7 of 80 This is a phase 3, randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind, parallel -group design 
with four treatment groups.  Participants  will be randomized in a 2:2:2:1 ratio within each 
age strat um (12 to <18, 18 to <46, and 46 to <65) to receive one of three consecutively 
manufactured lots of PXVX0317 or placebo. With 3150 participants  enrolled, the 
treatment group totals are estimated as follows:  
•Group 1 - PXVX0317 lot A: n=900
•Group 2 - PXVX0317 lot B: n=900
•Group 3 - PXVX0317 lot C: n=9 00
•Group 4 - Placebo: n=450
A nested lot consistency substudy will be performed in adult  participants  18 to <46 years 
of age in the PXVX0317 treatment groups ( lot A, lot B, and lot C).  
Procedures and Assessments:  
Study procedures  and assessments will occur at: Screening (Visit 1), to occur no more than 
[ADDRESS_838171] ( IP) administration; Day 1 (Visit 2, 
baseline, randomization, and administration of IP); Day 8 (Visit 3); Day 15 (Visit 4); Day 
22 (Visi t 5); Day 29 (Visit 6, via telephone contact); Day 92 (Visit 7, via telephone 
contact); Day 183 (Visit 8, End of Study) or; Early Discontinuation Visit.  The per 
participant  estimated total study duration is 212 days.  
Solicited adverse events (AEs collected  from IP administration on Day 1 through  Day 8) 
will consist of local (injection site pain, redness, and swelling) and systemic (fever, chills, 
fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and nausea) reactions. Unsolicited AEs will be 
collected from D ay 1 through Day 29. Serious adverse events (SAEs) , adverse events of 
special interest (AESI) , and medically attended adverse events (MAAE)  will be collected 
from Day 1 through to the Day 183 End of Study Visit. An independent Safety Monitoring 
Committee (SMC) will review aggregated, blinded safety data after the 300th enrolled 
participant passes Day 29, and again after the last enrolled participant passes Day 29.  
The induction of the humoral immune response (i mmunogenicity ) by [CONTACT_311566]0317  vaccine , 
specifical ly anti-CHIKV SNA  titers, will be measured by a bioluminescence assay 
developed by [CONTACT_628991] a  modified version of CHIKV containing  a reporter 
gene that expresses a luciferase protein  (CHIKV -luc) in infected Vero cells in vitro . 
Reduction of luciferase activity (ie, reduced bioluminescence) occurs in infected cultures 
of cells following treatment of CHIKV -luc with test serum  containing a nti-CHIKV SNA . 
The quantitation of reporter gene expression, a correlate of the level of virus i nfection of 
cells, is determined by [CONTACT_311567] a microplate luminometer.  The anti-
CHIKV SNA  titer 80 (NT 80) is the reciprocal of the serum dilution that provides 80% 
protection of Vero cells from CHIKV -luc infection or an 80% reduction of luciferase 
activity compared to virus only control.

Statistical Methods
 
Sample Size 
Considerations:
 
The 
primary statistical comparison between the PXVX0317 and placebo treatment groups 
is based on 
difference between treatment groups
 
in
 
seroresponse rate
 
(proportion of 
participants
 
with 
CHIK
V
-
luc
 
assay 
anti
-
CHIKV
 
SNA NT
80
 
[human SNA assay] 
 
at 
Day 22. 
 
Based on the data from the 
p
hase 2 study
 
(protocol PXVX
-
CV
-
317
-
001)
, the 
seroresponse 
rate 
for PXVX0317
 
vaccine
 
is expected to be approximately  
vs
 
<5% for the placebo 
participants
. With an assumed 10% rate of non
-
eva
luable 
participants
, the power to show 
superiority over placebo with 2430 PXVX0317
 
vaccine
 
and 405 placebo evaluable 
participants
 
is >99.9% for the combined age groups. The power is 99% for each of the 
smaller 12 
to <
18 and 46 
to <
65 age groups 
with
 
samples sizes of 210 vs 35 evaluable 
participants
 
(PXVX0317:
 
placebo). 
 
The difference in 
seroresponse
 
rate between PXVX0317 and placebo 
groups 
that is 
considered 
clinically relevant is . With 2430 PXVX0317
-
treated 
participants
 
and a 
target 
serorespons
e
 
rate of  v
s
 
a rate of 0% for placebo, the width of a two
-
sided 95% 
CI would be 
±
1.2%. The difference in 
serores
ponse
 
rate must be above  for the lower 
bound of 
the 95% CI 
for the difference 
to be .
 
The second consideration for sizing the 
study
 
is ensuring adequate power for the lot 
consistency equivalence intervals testing immunogenicity at Day 22, as measured by 
[CONTACT_628994]0317 lots (A:B, A:C, B:C) in the 18 
to <
46 years 
of age stratum
 
for the 
immunogenicity evaluable population
 
(
IEP
)
. For all three pairwise GMT ratios, the two
-
sided 95% 
CI 
must fall within [0.667, 1.5] for the lots to be considered equivalent.
 
 
On the log
[ADDRESS_838174] 95% power to reject the null 
hypothesis that the difference in mean titers between lots is below 
-
0.[ADDRESS_838175] deviation (SD) is 0.455, each test is at the 2.5% level and 
the sample size in each lot is 207. 
The SD estimate is based on the upper bound of an 80% 
CI
 
on the SD on the log
[ADDRESS_838176] 1050 evaluable 
participants
 
(300
 
participants
 
administered PXVX0317 from 
each 
lot 
and
 
150 
participants administered 
placebo
s
) need to be enrolled
 
into the 18 
to <
46 age 
group to provide adequate power for the lot consistency objective.  
 
The final consideration for the sample size of the 
study
 
is the size of the prelicensure 
safety database. With 2700 
participants
 
receiving any lot of PXVX0317, this 
study
 
is 
93.3% likely to detect at least one AE with a true frequency of 
≥
0.1% (
ie, 
“uncommon”).
 
Analysis
 
Safety
:
 
All safety analyses will be based on the safety population. The three PXVX0317 lots will 
be combined in t
he tabulations and each of the safety analyses will be summarized across 
all ages and repeated for three (12 to <18, 18 to <46, and 46 to <65)
 
participant
 
age 
groups.

injection site pain, redness, and swelling

PXVX0317 Vaccine  
EBSI-C V-317-004, Version 5.[ADDRESS_838186]  
PXVX0317 is a CHIKV  VLP vaccine. The vaccine is comprised of CHIKV VLP adsorbed 
on aluminum hydroxide  2% adjuvant (2% (w/w) aqueous suspension of aluminum 
hydroxide) and stabilized with formulation buffer, supplied as a single dose of 0.[ADDRESS_838187]  information , 
see Section  5.1 and the PXVX0317 Investigator’s Brochure  (IB).  
The target indication for PXVX0317 vaccine is for active immunization to prevent disease 
caused by  [CONTACT_628998] . 
1.2 Chikungunya Virus and Disease Background  
Chikungunya virus is an arthropod -borne alphavirus of the family Togaviridae . The CHIKV 
virion contains a positive -sense single -strand  RNA genome with a long open reading frame 
coding for capsid (C) and envelope (E1 , E2, E3, and 6K) structural proteins, together with 
four nonstructural proteins (nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, and nsP4)  required for replication of the virus . 
Since the first case reports of CHIKV in a 1952 -1953 outbreak in Tanzan ia (1), this disease 
has been endemic in Africa and parts of Asia with transmission to humans occurring through 
Aedes  aegypti  and more recently via Aedes  albopi[INVESTIGATOR_628965] (2). Beginning in 2014, 
CHIKV disease cases were reported among US travelers returning from affected areas in the 
Americas and local transmission was identified in [LOCATION_012], Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin 
Islands. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 
approximately [ADDRESS_838188] been documente d (Figure 1 
adapted from (3)). Although mosquitoes a re the primary mode of transmission of CHIKV, 
blood -borne transmission via needle stick is possible. Maternal -fetal transmission has been 
documented during pregnanc y (4).

Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 24 of 80 Figure 1 Chikungunya Virus Global Burden  
Following an incubation period of two to 12 days, acute clinical manifestations include high 
fever, rash, gastrointestinal complications, headache, muscle pain, nausea, fatigue, myalgia, 
and joint pain (5-7). The most classic symptom of CHIKV  is a debilitating polyarthralgia that 
is present in greater than 90% of cases (8). This acute phase resolve s within several weeks, 
but joint pain and ar thritis may persist for months or years in over 25% to 40% of infected 
individuals (9). 
There are currently no approved vaccines to prevent CHIKV infection or disease. However, 
protection against subsequent infection has been shown to correlate with the presence of 
CHIKV  serum antibodies that neutralize the virus in vitro  (10, 11). 
1.3 Justification for Use of Investigational PXVX0317 Vaccine 
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Vaccine Research Center (VRC) initiated the 
development of the CHIKV  VLP vaccine, designated VRC -CHKVLP059 -00-VP. The VRC 
completed phase 1 (VRC 311 ) (12, 13) and phase 2 (VRC 704 ) (14, 15) clinical studies (14, 
15). PaxVa x Inc. then manufactured the vaccine as PXVX0317, conducted a mouse 
immunogenicity study sho wing comparability to the VRC -CHKVLP059 -00-VP vaccine, and 
proceeded to a phase 2 study  (PXVX -CV-317-001) (16). PaxVax Inc. was acquired by 
[CONTACT_628999], Inc. in Octo ber 2018, and has been renamed Emergent Travel Health

Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 26 of 80 1.3.2 Summary of Findings from Clinical Studies  
VRC 311  (NIH ) 
The safety and immunogenicity of VRC -CHKVLP059 -00-VP were evaluated under BB -IND 
[ZIP_CODE] in VRC  311, a phase 1 open -label, dose -escalation study (12, 13). Healthy adult 
participants 18 to 50 years of age  were assigne d to sequential dose level groups to receive IM 
injections of 10 µg, 20 µg, or 40 µg (without adjuvant) on Weeks 0, 4, and 20, with 
follow -up for 44 weeks after enrollment. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability 
of the vaccine. Secondary endpoi nts were CHIKV -specific immune responses assessed by 
[CONTACT_629000] -linked immunosorbent assay (12, 13). 
All injections were well tolerated, with no SAEs  reported. The most common lo cal reaction 
was mild injection site pain (36%) and the most common systemic reaction was mild malaise 
(24%). No moderate or severe reactogenicity was obse rved (12, 13). 
Neutralizing antibodies were detected in all dose groups after the second vaccination. The 
GMT of the half maximum inhibitory concentration (IC 50) was [ADDRESS_838189] vaccination in all dose groups (10 µg group p=0.0197, 20  µg group p<0.0001, and 
40 µg group p<0.0001). Four weeks after the third vaccination, the GMT of the IC 50 was 
8745 for the 10 µg group, 4525 for the 20 µg group, and 5390 for the 40 µg group (12, 13). 
These findings were confirmed by [CONTACT_17588] a plaque reduction assay and the sponsor’s 
luciferase -based assay ( human SNA assay ) (18), confirming both the immunogenicity of the 
VLP and the suitability of human SNA  assay for future studies  (see Section 6.1 for assay 
details) .  
VRC 704  (NIH)  
The NIH’s VRC 704 was a phase 2 study  conducted at multiple CHIKV -endemic sites in the 
Caribbea n (14, 15). The study was a double -blind, placebo -controlled study with 200 
participants (planned)  receiving 20 µg of CHIKV  VLP  and 200 participa nts receiving 
placebo in a two-dose series at Weeks 0 and 4 . The study was initiated in 2016 and 
completed in 2018. Approximately 20% of participants demonstrated detectabl e CHIKV 
neutralizing antibodies at baseline  using the focus reduction neutralization test reported as 
EC 50 values . EC 50 is the dilution of sera that inhibits 50% infection in viral neutralization 
assay . CHIKV  VLP appeared safe and was well tolerated in participants who were followed 
through Week 72, with no related SAEs or other safety concern s (14, 15). CHIKV  VLP 
appeared highly immunogenic, with a GMT of 2004.5 and 99.5% of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_311487] 8. A boosting effect of SNA after administration of CHIKV  
VLP was also observed in participants with baseline CHIKV neutralizing antibodies  (14, 15). 
Specimens from VRC 704 were also analyzed ad hoc by [CONTACT_456], using the human SNA 
assay . A sub group analysis was performed on participants without baseline CHIKV 
neutralizing activity. Using a more stringent 80% neutralization cut-off (NT 80), the GMT was 
123 at Week 4 and 1701 at Week 8. After Week 8, antibody levels declined by [CONTACT_2902] 1 log 
PXVX0317 Vaccine  
EBSI-C V-317-004, Version 5.0 20 Mar 2023 
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 27 of 80 but remained elevated above baseline, with GMTs of 213 at Week 24, 115 at Week 48, and 
100 at Week 72, indicating that long -term protection can potentially b e achieved without the 
need for booster dose (s). These results demonstrated that CHIKV  VLP was well tolerated  
and immunogenic in adults in CHIKV -endemic areas, including those with serologic 
evidence of previous CHIKV exposure. The most frequently reported  local AE was 
pain/tenderness at the injection site reported as mild by 58 of 197 (29%) vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_628966] 3/197 vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (2.0%). 
The most frequently reported systemic AEs were mild or moderate headache reported by 5 4 
of 197 (27 .4%) vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], malaise (53/197, 26.9%), and myalgia (46/197, 23.4 %) 
(14, 15). Placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_628967]. One vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] (0.5%) experienced a headache graded as severe 
following the second vaccination. A total of 16 SAEs in 15 (3.8%) participants were 
reported, all were assessed as unrelated to the IP (ie, CHIKV VLP or placebo ). All 
potentially rela ted AEs resolved without clinical sequel ae (14, 15). 
Taken t ogether, the findings from VRC [ADDRESS_838190] that VRC -CHKVLP059 -
00-VP is well -tolerated and immunogenic in both CHIKV -exposed and CHIKV -naïve adults.
PXVX -CV-317-001 (Emergent)  
The sponsor’s phase 2 clinical study  (PXVX -CV-317-001) conducted in the US compared 
multiple dose and dosing regimens of CHIKV VLP in healthy adults age 18 to <46 years  
(16). The do sages of CHIKV VLP ranged from 6 µg to 40 µg, adjuvanted. These doses were 
below or approximately equivalent to those used in  the NIH’s  VRC 3 11 (12, 13) and VRC 
704 (14, 15) clinical studies  using the non -adjuvanted  CHIKV VLP  (VRC -CHKVLP059 -00-
VP) vaccine . PXVX0 317 vaccine was immunogenic across all dose groups as measured by 
[CONTACT_629001]. Immunogenicity data reported as 80% antibody NT [ADDRESS_838191] schedule 
(Days 1 and 29), either unadjuvanted (as the NIH reference dose)  or adjuvanted, had the 
highest Day 57 GMT at 1946 and 1884 respectively, similar to those of CHIKV VLP 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_628968] 704  study (14, 15). Participants receiving the single 40 µg dose 
demonstrated only slightly lower GMT levels (1712 at Day 57, i.e., 28 days after 
vaccination); all other dose groups demonstrated a GMT range of 914 to 1613 at Day 57. 
Seroconversion rates  (titer ≥15)  showed that with a single dose administered, up to 98% of 
study participants produced a neutralizing antibody response by [CONTACT_2006] 8. Further, the immune 
response was shown to be persistent through the 12 -month visit, including in the one dose 
40 µg CHIKV VLP re gimen. There was a clear dose -response relationship in GMT, with the 
Group 8 40 µg CHIKV VLP + 300 µg alum adjuvant single dose resulting in 86% 
seroresponse  (titers ≥40) [ADDRESS_838192] GMTs at Day 182. 
Seroresponse  was well maintained at 760 days in Group 8 participants (16).

Rationale for Dosage and Route of Administration
 
The regimen of
 
PXVX0317 selected for this study is 40 
µg
 
of 
CHIKV 
VLP
 
with 
alum 
adjuvant administered in a single IM dose on Day 1. The 
alum 
dose of 300 
µg
 
is within the 
range of doses of alum adjuvants used in many licensed vaccines, including VLP
-
based 
vaccines. This 
dose also creates a concentration ratio to
 
PXVX0317
 
that achieves high 
(~90%) levels of adsorption, thought to enhance both immunogenicity and short
-
term 
stability. The IM route of administration is consistent with that in previous clinical studies

2013 CHIKV was identified in the Western Hemisphere in the Caribbe an (19). With the 
global expansion of C HIKV  and the frequency of travel, the potential for exposure to 
CHIKV  has increased. Local transmission of  CHIKV has been reported in approximately 117 
countries or territories worldwide, including the U S (20). Each year, millions of travelers 
visit countries where CHIKV  outbreaks are ongoin g (21, 22). In 2014 alone, 2799 cases of 
CHIKV  disease occurred in US travelers returning from affected areas (22). From 2014  to 
2017, approximately 10% of 3941 travel -acquired CHIKV  cases were in individuals under 20 
years of age (7.5% were 10 to 19 years of age and 2% were <10 years of age). Of th ose [ADDRESS_838195] under 20% were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153620] a result of their illn ess (23). Locally 
transmitted cases have been reported in the U S since 20 13 (22).  
With expanded distribution of the Ae. aegypti  and Ae. albopi[INVESTIGATOR_628973] o-vectors in the U S 
and the increase in travel, epi[INVESTIGATOR_628974] U S remains susceptible to 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_7509]  (24). Although locally transmitted cases are currently reported to occur in small 
numbers, as more CHIKV -infected travelers come into the U S, the likelihood t hat local 
CHIKV transmission could occur is increase d (25).   
CHIKV epi[INVESTIGATOR_7509], when they occur, are characterized by [CONTACT_125938] s of inactivity interspersed 
with sudden outbreaks. The available methods to accurately predict when emerging CHIKV

surface a ntigen ( HBsAg ), HCV antibody  (if HCV antibody is positive HCV RNA testing can 
be performed ), HIV -1/HIV-2, serum pregnancy test for women of CBP, and for FSH testing 
for postmenopausal wome n (for additional information on FSH assessme nt see Section 
3.3.7 ). Urine toxicology screening may be done per investigator ’s (or designee ’s) discretion  
at the Screening Visit . Any request to repeat testing  should be discussed with the MM.  
For additional inf ormation on sample collection, processing, storage , and shipment refer to 
the study  Laboratory Manual .  
3.3.6 Immunogenicity Sample  
Anti-CHIKV SNA titers will be assessed using a  validated human SNA  assay  that measures 
neutralization titer of 80% (NT 80). Blood  (serum)  sample s will be  taken on  Day 1 (prior to IP 
administration ), Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, and the Day 183 End of Study Visit (or at Early 
Discontinuation /Withdrawal ). For information on the immunogenic ity assessment see 
Section 6.1.  
For additional information on sample collection, processing, storage, and shipment refer to 
the study Laboratory Manual.  
3.3.[ADDRESS_838198] also use an acceptable method of contraception from prior to Day 1 
through Day 183  End of Study Visit . Acceptable methods include highly effective forms of 
contraception : hormonal contraceptives (eg, implants,  pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], patches)  containing combin ed 
estrogen and progestogen , or progestogen -only initiated ≥30 days prior to dosing  or IUD 
inserted ≥30 days prior to dosing  or use of double barrier type of birth control ( male condom 
with female diaphragm, male condom with cervical cap ). Abstinence is acceptable only for 
adolescents (12 to <18 years  of age ) who are not sexually active.  
Note: Contraception requirements do not apply for participants  in exclusively same -sex 
relationship s and these participants should have no plans to become p regnant by [CONTACT_628992] . 
The investigator must confirm that contraception methods (eg, hormonal contraceptive or 
intrauterine device) were initiated ≥30 days  prior to Day 1 to be considered fully effective. 
For female participants who are postmenopausal, documented FSH  level of ≥40 mIU/mL 
must be obtained. If the FSH is <40 mIU/mL, the participant must agree to use an acceptable 
form of contraception (see above).

Parents/guardians may provi de assistance to adolescents to measure and record temperature 
and injection site reactions . 
Study staff will review the signs and symptoms recorded in the e-diary . The investigator will 
then assess all solicited AEs for sever ity (Section 7.1.7 ) and the action taken, and causality 
(Section 7.1.8 ). The  results of the investigator’s assessment will be recorded as a separate 
source document and will be entered on the solicited AE eCRF. Symptoms continuing

3.4 Measures Taken to Minimize/Avoid Bias  
3.4.1 Treatment Assignment/Randomization  
Participant eligibility will be confirme d and documented by [CONTACT_629005] . Study staff will indicate on a randomization eCRF 
within the electronic data capture  (EDC ) system that they want to generate a randomization 
number for the partici pant. When they agree to proceed, a randomization number will be 
generated from the EDC randomization module but hidden from study staff. The EDC 
randomization module will match the randomization number to a n IP kit available at the site 
PXVX0317 Vaccine  
EBSI-C V-317-004, Version 5.0 20 Mar 2023 
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 37 of 80 and inform the study staff of the assigned kit. Study staff will use the appropriate kit for 
administration  to the participant .   
Participants will be considered enrolled once a randomization number has been assigned 
within the EDC system. The study will be conducted as a double -blind study through Day 
183 End of Study Visit . Neither participants , nor clinical site personnel, including the 
investigator s, nor the sponsor will know partic ipants' individual treatment assignments until 
all participants have completed their pa rticipation in the study through the Day 183 End of 
Study Visit and the database has been cleaned and locked.  
3.4.2 Masking/Blinding Procedures  
Study participants , the investigator , and study site personnel will remain blinded to all 
randomization assignments th roughout the study. The s ponsor ’s MM and personnel, who are 
in regular contact [CONTACT_311552]/or involved with documentation associated with the 
study will remain blinded to all participant  randomization assignments . 
The following safeguards will be employed to reduce the risk of inadvertent unblinding:  
•Use of a standardized pre -filled syringe and injection volume for all injections.
•All PXVX0317 and placebo syringes have a semitransparent barrel cover to mask any
difference in appearance between p lacebo and PXVX0317.
•No sponsor personnel will have access to the randomization schedule. No site
personnel will have access to treatment assignments. The Randomization and Trial
Supply Management (RTSM ) system allows for unblinding in an emergen cy (see
Section 7.7).
•Assays will be run in a blinded manner . The assay titer results will not be delivered to
the sponsor data management and analysis team until after database lock , as the y are
potentially unblinding .
•Should any participant or staff member become inadvertently unblinded, the
investigator will promptly (within 24 hours of their awareness of the error) disclose
the event to the sponsor ’s MM in a blinded fashion (disclosing only participant
number, not treatment) so that corrective action can be initiated. The unblinding
sequence of events will be documented and retained as source documents. A protocol
deviation will be entered in the eCRF .

4.3.1 Participant Consent Withdrawal  
All participants can withdraw from participation in this study at any time, for any reason, 
specified or unspecif ied, and without penalty. The investigator will ask (but cannot require) 
such participants to provide the reason(s) for withdrawal of consent and to undergo an Early 
Withdrawal Visit. An individual is considered to undergo early withdrawal if they stop stu dy 
participation before Day [ADDRESS_838208] be clearly documented on the study source documents 
and the appropriate eCRF. The investigator is encouraged to consult the sponsor  prior to the 
withdrawal of any participant , except in the ev ent of a medical emergency.  
The investigator (and/or  sponsor ) may withdraw a participant from the study for any of, but 
not limited to, the following reasons:  
•Noncompliance with the protocol.  If the participant is noncompliant with protocol
requirement s, the issue should be discussed with the participant and, if not resolved,
consideration given to withdrawing the participant .
•Lost to follow -up; requires documentation of at least three  unsuccessful attempts to
contact [CONTACT_4317] . Los t to follow -up will be determined after the date of the
participant’s projected last visit.
•Other reason(s) which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], indicates that continued
participation in the study is not in the best interest of the participant .
Safety follow -up for AEs should occur for all participants . For information on safety follow -
up for withdrawn participants  see Section  4.3.3 .  
4.3.3 Follow -up for Withdrawn Participants  
Outreach will be made to ensure that participants  who are withdrawn, or who withdraw from 
the study , during the active observation  or follow -up period will complete all safety and 
available assessments for the Early Withdrawa l Visit as outlined in this protocol. The 
investigator should inform the participant  that these assessments are for their own well -being 
and, if possible, for study purposes. Additional information regarding ongoing AEs may be 
provided as a follow -up report.

5 TREATMENT OF PARTICIPANTS  
5.1 Investigational Products  
5.1.1 PXVX0317 Vaccine  
The PXVX0317 vaccine is comprised of CHIKV VLP adsorbed on aluminum hydroxide  
adjuvant 2%, and f ormulation buffer supplied as a single dose in a pre-filled glass syringe. 
CHIKV VLP refers to the VLP component of PXVX0317 produced by [CONTACT_629006] (HEK293 ) cells with a deoxyribonucleic acid  expression 
plasmid encoding capsid (C) and envelope (E) E3, E2, 6K, and E1 proteins. After expression 
of the plasmid -encoded proteins, VLPs self -assemble and are released into the cell culture 
medium as ~[ADDRESS_838209] not be en specifically detected in 
the VLPs. No replication -capable viral genetic material is incorporated into the VLPs. Virus -
like particles are then concentrated from the cell supernatant purified, and buffer exchanged. 
The VLPs are then formulated with excipi [INVESTIGATOR_628978], mixed, and

Any study procedure, excluding vaccination, may be conducted at an Unscheduled Visit as 
needed and recorded on the Unscheduled Visit eCRF. Examples include repeat specimen 
collection and additional safety follow -up for an SAE/AESI /MAAE /AE.  
5.3 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
At the Screening Visit, the details of prior and concomitant medication usage will be 
collected (through 30 days prior to screening, or 90 days for blood products , or six months 
prior to screening for systemic immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive medications ). 
Concomitant medications will be collected at each on si te visit or by [CONTACT_252580] (or 
early discontinuation/ withdrawal) for all groups . The details of all concomitant medications 
including those associated with solicited AEs and unsolicited AEs will be collected. After

in serum samples. The assay is based on using a modified version CHIKV that expresses 
luciferase (CHIKV -luc) and measures the reduction of luciferase activity in infected cultures 
of Vero  cells following treatment of virus with test serum. Using the human SNA  assay, 
antibody neutralization tit ers can be determined via characterization of reductions of 
luciferase activity in the presence of immune serum. The quantitation of reporter gene 
expression, a correlate of the level of virus infection of cells, is determined by [CONTACT_629010] a micro -plate luminometer. The CHIKV neutralizing antibody 
titer 80 (NT 80) is the reciprocal of the serum dilution that provides 8 0% protection of Vero 
cells from CHIKV -luc infection or an 80% reduction of luciferase activity compared to virus 
only control.

EBSI-C V-317-004, Version 5.[ADDRESS_838220] a causal 
relationship with this  treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated wi th 
the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product.  
Note s: 
•A diagnosis should be captured as an AE term and signs and symptoms should be
captured only in the absence of a unifying diagnosis. If a diagnosis is ultimately made, it
should replace the previous report based on signs and symptoms.
•In the event that  there are multiple diagnoses, then all diag noses should be captured.
•The worsening of an existing sign, symptom or disease is also considered to be an AE.
•An abnormal laboratory finding deemed by [CONTACT_458]  (or designee)  as not
clinically significant (NCS)  will not be captured as an AE, but an abnormal laboratory
finding that worsens after dosing with the IP, from not clinically significant to clinically
significant  (CS), is considered an AE.
•Surgical procedures are not AEs. They are the action taken to tr eat a medical condition.
Interventions that were planned prior to study entry for medical conditions that started
prior to study entry but did not worsen during the clinical study are not reported as AEs.
•Medically attended adverse events: m edically attend ed visits include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], emergency
room, urgent care clinic, or other visits to or from medical personnel.  Routine scheduled
study visits will not be considered medically attended visits.
7.1.2 Solicited Adverse Event  
A solicited AE is a protocol -specified AE  about which the investigator (or designee) 
proactively asks the participants during a protocol -specifi ed time period.  A reactogenicity 
event may be considered as a solicited AE per discretion of the investigator  (as described 
below in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).

EBSI-C V-317-004, Version 5.0 20 Mar 2023 
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 49 of 80 [IP_ADDRESS]  Reactogenicity  
Reactogenicity (solicited systemic and local injection site reactions) will be assessed by [CONTACT_629011] e-diary car ds. Information will be solicited on the following injection site 
reactions: pain, redness, and swelling. In addition, information will be solicited for AEs, on 
the following systemic reactions: temperature increases (oral) ≥38 .0°C (≥100.4°F), chills, 
fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia , and nausea.   
If injection site or systemic reactions continue beyond seven  days postvaccination , these will 
be recorded in the EDC as unsolicited AEs. For any type of reactogenicity persisting two 
weeks or more, the investigator (or designee ) will evaluate the reaction at the next scheduled 
visit and/or determine based on the nature and severity if a more immediate unscheduled 
follow -up visit is required to fully assess the reaction.  
7.1.[ADDRESS_838221] medical occurrence that: results in death, is life threatening, 
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], results in 
persistent or significant disability/incap acity  or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions , or is a congenital anomaly or birth defect .  
Important medical events which may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a n SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or participant and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Note s: 
•Death is an outcome and not an event. The condition leading to death is the event. If no
other information regarding the cause of death is available , the event will be considered
“Unspecified Adverse Event”.
•Overnight stay at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic  that occurs during a study  for social reasons (eg,
transportation difficulties, respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594]) is not considered to be a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47017].

EBSI-C V-317-004, Version 5.0 20 Mar 2023 
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 50 of 80 7.1.6 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction  
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is the term used to refer to an AE 
that occurs in a clinical study  participant , which is assessed by [CONTACT_629012], serious , and as having a reasonable possibility of a causal 
relationship  (Section 7.1.8 ) with the IP.   
7.1.7 Severity of Adverse Events  
The investigator  will grade all adverse events for severity. Adverse events  listed in  the 
grading scale in Appendix I  will b e graded according to the criteria in the tabl e. Adverse 
events not listed in the grading scale will be graded as follows:  
•Mild (Grade 1) : No interference with activity
•Moderate (Grade 2): Some interference with activity
•Severe (Grade 3) : Significant; prevents daily activity
•Potentially Life -Threatening (Grade 4) : As determined by [CONTACT_629013][INVESTIGATOR_059] .
For the study grading scale see Appendix I . 
7.1.8 Causality of Adverse Events 
The investigator  is responsible for the assessment of the causality of an AE and sponsor’s 
MM will also assess SAE causality, independent of the investigator.    
The following guidelines are provided for this assessment:  
•Unrelated:  No relationship between the IP and the reported event .
•Possibly related:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of
administration of IP and/or follows a known response pattern to the IP but could also
have been produced by [CONTACT_1604] .
•Probably related:  A reasonable temporal sequence of the event with administration
of IP exists and based on the known response to the IP, known or previo usly reported
adverse reactions to the IP or similar products, or in the investigator’s (or designee )
clinical judgment the association of the event with the IP seems likely .
If the relationship between the AE and the IP is determined to be “possible” or “ probable”, 
the event will be considered to be “related” to the IP, otherwise it will be considered “not 
related” for reporting purposes .

If a participant becomes pregnant during a study, the sponsor will be notified. All 
pregnancies where conception occurred after first exposure to the IP through the End of 
Study visit are to be followed to outcome (eg, delivery, spontaneous/elective/therapeutic 
abortion), including after the study is completed and even if the participant is withdrawn 
from the study. If a pregnancy results in an abnormal o utcome that the reporting health care 
professional considers might be due to the IP, then the guidelines for expedited reporting of 
S[LOCATION_003]R  should be followe d (see Section 7.3.2). 
Any pregnancy that occurs during study participation must be reported using the clinical 
study  pregnancy forms (“Pregnancy Notification Form” and “Pregnancy Follow -up Form”). 
To ensure participant  safety, each pregnancy must be reported to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_838223] be followed up to determine outcome 
(including premature termination) and status of mother and child. Pregnancy complications 
and elective terminations for medical re asons must be reported as an AE or SAE. 
Spontaneous abortions must be reported as an SAE.  
Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy brought to the investigator’s attention 
during or after the participant has completed the study and considered by [CONTACT_3433] e investigator as 
possibly related to the study treatment, must be promptly reported to the sponsor.  
The investigator is responsible to notify their IRB  according to their policy . 
7.3.2 Sponsor ’s Reporting Requirements  
A S[LOCATION_003]R is a suspected adverse reaction th at is both serious and unexpe cted (Section 7.1.6 ). 
As specified in 21 Code of Federal Regulations  (CFR ) 312.32, S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be reported by 
[CONTACT_629016] (IND) to the FDA and to all 
participating principal investigators in an IND safety report as soon as possible, no later than 
15 calendar days after the sponsor becomes aware of the suspected adverse reacti on (21 CFR 
312.32(c)(1)).  
In addition, any unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse reaction will be 
reported to FDA no later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the

of participants  or others. Only a small subset of AEs occurring in human participants  
participating in a clinical study will meet these three criteria for an unanticipated problem. 
There are other types of incidents, experiences, and outcomes that occur during the conduct 
of a clinical stu dy that represent unanticipated problems but are not considered AEs. For 
example, some unanticipated problems involve social or economic harm instead of the 
physical or psychological harm associated with AEs. In other cases, unanticipated problems 
place participants  or others at increased risk of harm, but no harm occurs.  
The investigator should promptly notify the IRB when an unanticipated problem involving 
risks to participants  or others is identified. Also, the investigator should notify the sponsor  of 
unanticipated problem(s).  
7.5 Follow -up of Adverse Events  
All SAEs/AESI /MAAE s/AEs  will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or up to [ADDRESS_838225] be recorded on the AE eCRF with the current status noted. 
All nonserious events that are ongoing at this time will be recorded as “Not Recovered/Not 
Resolved” on the AE eCRF . The status of ongoing, previously reported AEs will be subject 
to active follow -up.

EBSI-C V-317-004, Version 5.[ADDRESS_838226]  
This study requires that participants be monitored for SAE/AESI /MAAE  up to Day 183  End 
of Study Visit . From  Day 1 (Visit 2) , confirmed SAEs , confirmed AESI , and confirmed 
MAAE s will be recorded on the AE eCRF.  
The investigator will provide or arrange appropriate care for participants for whom SAEs , 
potential AESI  or MAAEs  are reported . Withdrawal /discontinuation  of participants from the 
study to treat SAE s/AESI /MAAE s are at the discretion of the investigator.   
All SAEs/AESI /MAAE s will be followed by [CONTACT_458] (or designee ) until one 
or the other condition is met:  
•The event is resolved or stable if condition is expected to remain chronic .
•The participant is referred to a specialist or other physician for treatment and follow -
up. The principal investigator (or designee ) will follow the participant's condition
even if the particip ant is seen by [CONTACT_20427], to obtain information about the
diagnosis and outcome and any treatments and medications administered for the
event.
The following will be considered acceptable reasons for discontinuation of follow -up of 
ongoing SAEs:  
•Participant withdraws consent .
•Participant is referred to appropriate long -term medical care .
•Participant is considered lost to follow -up.
It is expected that the clinical site will obtain supporting medical records from appropriate 
physicians and record and /or upload this information on the SAE Report Form within the AE 
eCRF. Additional information received related to any SAE must be added to the SAE Report 
Form within the AE eCRF  or forwarded to the Emergent Global PV Department within 24 
hours of awaren ess (Section 7.3.1 ).

STATISTICAL CONSIDER

8.1
 
Sample Size 
Rationale
 
8.1.1
 
Sample Size 
and Power for Immunogenicity
 
The primary statistical comparison between the PXVX0317 and placebo treatment groups is 
based on 
the 
difference between treatment groups in
 
seroresponse rate
 
(proportion of 
participants 
with 
anti
-
CHIKV SNA 
NT
80
 
 as measured by [CONTACT_629017]
)
 
at 
Day 22, which will be tested using a chi
-
square test with a
 
two
-
sided
 
alpha=0.05 in 
the 
IEP 
across all age groups combined. The analysis will be repeated for
 
the mITT 
as a measure of 
the robustness of the result.
 
Based on the data from the 
p
hase 2 study
 
(protocol PXVX
-
CV
-

-

(
16
, 
28
)
, the 
seroresponse rate
 
for PXVX0317
 
vaccine
 
is expected to be approximately  vs <5% for 
the placebo 
participants 
at Day 22
. With an assumed 10% rate of nonevaluable 
participants
, 
the power to show superiority over placebo with 2430 PXVX0317 
vaccine 
and 405 placebo
-
evaluable 
participants 
is >99.9% for the combined ages groups. The power is 99% for each 
of the smaller 12 to 
<18
 
and 46 to 
<65
 
age groups 
with 
samples sizes of 
189 
vs 
32 
evaluable 
participants 
(PXVX0317:
 
placebo). 
 
The difference in 
seroresponse
 
rate between PXVX0317 and placebo 
groups 
that is 
considered 
clinically relevant is  With 2430 PXVX0317
-
treated 
participants
 
and a target 
seroresponse rate 
of  v
s
 
a rate o
f 0% for placebo, the width of a two
-
sided 95% CI would 
be 
±
1.2%. The difference in 
seroresponse rate
 
must be above  for the lower bound of the 
95% CI 
for the difference 
to be 
.

EBSI-C V-317-004, Version 5.0 20 Mar 2023 
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 56 of 80 8.1.2 Sample Size and Power for Lot Consistency  
The second consideration for sizing the study  is ensuring adequate power for the lot 
consistency equivalence intervals testing immunogenicity at Day 22, as measured by [CONTACT_629018]-CHIKV SNA  GMT ratios between all three pairs of consecutively 
manuf actured PXVX0317 lots (A:B, A:C, B:C) in the 18 to <46 years of age strat um for the 
IEP. Pairwise testing of lots will be performed without multiplicity adjustment, and for each 
GMT ratio the two -sided 95% confidence interval must fall within the equivalen ce interval of 
[0.667, 1.5]  for the lots to be considered equivalent . 
On the log [ADDRESS_838230] 95% power to reject the null 
hypothesis that the difference in mean titers between lots is below -0.[ADDRESS_838231] is at the 2.5% level and the sample size in 
each lot is 207. The SD estimate was based on the upper bound of an 80% CI on the SD on 
the log [ADDRESS_838232] 1050 
evaluable  participants  (300 participants in each lot along with 150 placebo participants ) need 
to be enrolled into the 18 to <46 age group to provide adequate power for the lot consistency 
objective.  
8.1.3 Sample Size and Power for Adverse Events  
The final consideration for the sample size of the study  is the size of the prelicensure safe ty 
database. With 2700 participants receiving any lot of PXVX0317, this study  is 93.3% likely 
to detect at least one AE with a true frequency of ≥0.1% ( ie, “uncommon”).  
8.2 Analysis Populations  
Analysis will be based on the following study populations:  
Randomized Population:  All screened participants  who provide informed consent and 
provide demographic and other screening measurements and are randomized.  
Exposed Population: All participants  in the randomized  population who receive IP. 
Safety Population : All participants  in the exposed population who provide safety assessment 
data. This generally includes anyone who was not lost to follow -up at Day 1 as they will be 
at risk for reporting an SAE. Participants will be  analyzed as  treated (ie, according to the 
treatment  a participant  received,  rather than the treatment  to which the participant  may have 
been randomized).  
Modified  Intent -to-Treat Population : All randomized participants  who are vaccinated and 
have at least one post -injection anti-CHIKV SNA  NT 80 result. Participants  are counted in the 
group to which they were randomized.

an ANOVA, with logarithmically transformed  anti-CHIKV SNA  titers (log 10) as the 
dependent variable and treatment group and study site as the fixed effects in the model. The 
adjusted least square means and their 95% CIs calculated based on the ANOVA will be back 
transformed and reported as the group GMT values. All tests will be carried o ut at a two-

[IP_ADDRESS]  Day 22 Lot Consistency Analysis  
The consistency of the immune response across three  consecutively manufactured lots of 
PXVX0317 vaccine will be confirmed at Day 22. Immunogenicity as measured by [CONTACT_629024]-CHIKV SNA GMTs will be compared using ratios of GMT s between all 
three pairs of PXVX0317 lots (A:B, A:C, B:C) for the IEP in the  18 to <[ADDRESS_838238] square means 
and their 95% CIs calculated based on the ANOVA will be back transformed and reported as 
the vaccine lot  GMT values. The ratio of GMTs for the comparison of the three pairs of 
PXVX0317 lots (A:B, B:C, A:C) will be derived from this model.  
All tests will be carried out at a two-sided significance level of 0.05 and no adjustment for  
multiplicity will be applied  (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). If for all pairs of vaccine lots, the two -sided 
95% CI of the GMT ratio is within [0.667; 1.5] then lot -to-lot consistency will be 
demonstrated.

unsolicited AEs , AESI,  MAAEs , and SAEs will be summarized separately by [CONTACT_629027].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Solicited A dverse Event s 
With the exception of redness and swelling, all solicited AEs will be summarized according 
to severity grading scales defin ed in Section 7.1.7  from “ mild” to “potentially life -
threatening.”  
Solicited AEs will be recorded daily until [ADDRESS_838243] -injection (Day 8) using an e -diary. The 
analyses of solicited AEs will be performed by [CONTACT_210708]. In 
addition, solicited AEs ongoing after seven  days post -injection (Day 8) will also be recorded 
as unsolicited AEs.  
Frequencies and percentages of participa nts experiencing each solicited AE will be presented 
by [CONTACT_764]. Summary tables showing the occurrence of any local or any systemic 
solicited AE overall and at each time point will also be presented.  
The severity of redness and swelling , recorded as diameters (mm) , will be  summarized 
according to categories based on the largest diameter linear measurement when the local 
reaction is present:  
•Grade 0/absent = 0 -24 mm
•Grade 1/mild  = 25-50 mm
•Grade 2/moderate  = 51-100 mm
•Grade 3/severe  = >100 mm
•Grade  4/potentially life threatening  = necrosis  or exfoliative  dermatitis

** The clinical signs or symptoms associated with laboratory abnormalities might result in characterization
of the laborator y abnormalities as Potentially Life Threatening (Grade 4). For example. a low sodium value
that falls within a grade 3 parameter (125 -129 mE/L) should be recorded as a grade 4 hyponatremia event if
the participant had a new seizure associated with the low sodium value.

ZOLL MEDICAL CORPORATION  1 Introduction  
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according 
to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (International Conference on 
Harmonization ICHE6), the Code of Federal Regulations Titl e 21 parts 803 and 812, and other 
applicable government regulations . 
1.1 Background 
Annually, over 1 million patients are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_191546] a primary diagnosis of heart failure (HF) 1. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_633808], readmissions for acute decompensated HF are common and place a significant burden on the healthcare system . Therefore, strategies 
for outpatient monitoring and fluid management are needed to reduce HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] . 
Rather than low cardiac output, the main reasons  for rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_700665] (end-diastolic) 
pressures
 2. Remote monitoring of these pressure changes in addition to its surrogate measures , 
such as intrathoracic  impedance, lung fluid levels, systolic time intervals, or the presence of 
abnormal heart sounds , may help to prevent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_700666] 3, 4, 5. In addition, remote monitoring may lead to better access to care and 
coordination of services.   
 
Given the anticipated importance of remote HF monitoring and fluid management, ZOLL has 
developed a novel radiofrequency (RF) based heart failure and arrhythmia management system 
(µCor Heart Failure and Arrhythmia Management System ). Using the RF data, µ Cor provides  
an estimate of the thoracic  fluid index (TFI).  To calculate TFI, the thoracic fluid baseline is 
determined, and the normalized value is presented as TFI.  In conjunction with standard clinical 
practice for patients with fluid balance issues, the direction of change of TFI over time may 
provide clinically useful information.  In addition to TFI, the system records the electrocardiogram 
(ECG) through adhesive electrodes and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], activity, and posture through a tri -axial 
accelerometer. The purpose of this study is  to assess investigator engagement of µCor system 
data in the context of heart failure management.   
 
1.2 Preclinical Data  
In animal testing, µCor’s noninvasively determined RF thoracic fluid content was compared with 
invasive thermodilution extravascular lung water measurements (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_605943] - Pulsion Medical 
Systems, Munich, [LOCATION_013]). Pulmonary edema was induced in 15 sheep by [CONTACT_700675]. µ Cor was placed on the left lateral torso of the sheep. The 
emitted and reflected RF signals are used by µCor to assess thoracic fluid. These readings were 
compared with the readings from the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_633812]. Results of the study showed that all 15 
sheep developed increases  in left ventricular end diastolic pressure,  and the onset of pulmonary 
congestion and edema. A consistent linear correlation (r = 0.97) between measurements of 
invasive lung water fluid and noninvasive thoracic fluid conte nt was observed. µCor RF signals 
were able to detect dynamic accumulation of lung water in the range of 50-60 ml increments. 
The change in lung water needed to produce congestion was between 250-500 ml. The results 
of this study support the use of ZOLL’s external RF sensor for high resolution and precise fluid 
monitoring.

1.4 Study Device  
1.4.1 System Components  
µCor consists of the following components:  
A) Patch 
B) Sensor  
C) Charger  
D) Data transmission device (Gateway)  
E) Server  
 
Once activated, the wearable Sensor automatically acquires ECG, RF readings, h eart rate, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], activity, and p osture measurements.  Data are automatically transmitted from 
the Sensor to the Data transmission device, and from there to the Server  for analysis (see Fig. 
1).

ZOLL MEDICAL CORPORATION  Subjects will be given a diary at enrollment that will ask them to rate their degree of specific 
symptoms of heart failure such as shortness of breath and fatigue as well as mark any heart 
failure related clinical events or medication changes that have occurred since the last entry.  The 
subject diary is shown in Appendix A.   
 
Phone calls will be based on weekly data reviews or data updates.  A review of the data 
will be conducted by [CONTACT_700676] (Transthoracic Fluid Index) TFI will be rec orded.  The subject will receive a study based weekly phone call  asking 
the subject about any recent heart failure related clinical events or change in heart failure 
symptoms.  The weekly phone calls will continue if the subject has stopped wearing the dev ice.  
During the weekly phone call the subject will be reminded to fill out the daily diary.  No phone calls 
will be given on the week where there is a study follow up visit.   
 
A review of the data will be conducted by [CONTACT_700677].  Study face to face follow up visits will occur at day 30, day 60, and day 90.  
There will be no follow up visit if the subject has stopped wearing the device.  During follow up visits the subjects will be asked about any heart failure related clinical events or change in 
symptoms that have occurred since the last follow up.  
 
Unplanned visits to the physician office or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_700669] 48 hours.  In c ase of adverse skin reaction to the µCor  
adhesive and/or electrodes, on the discretion of physician, subjects may discontinue wearing the 
device for up to [ADDRESS_951129]’s 
current symptoms and history, and make an informed decision within the context of both device 
measurements and standard medical care as to what actions to take with the subject.  Potential 
actions the site could take will include, a prescription drug change or titration, a request for an 
office visit, a request for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and request for  lifestyle or diet modifications.  The site 
will document any changes to subject care within the case report forms.  Unscheduled contacts 
that the subject initiates will be recorded as well.

ZOLL MEDICAL CORPORATION  10 Safety and Adverse Device Effects  
10.1 Definitions  
All device related adverse effects will be recorded during the study . All adverse device effects 
(ADEs) will be classified by [CONTACT_633832].  Adverse events will 
also include any adverse events related to medication changes and medical procedures initiated 
by µCor data. 
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_951152] (UADE)  
An unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) is any adverse device effect not identified by 
[CONTACT_6073], severity or frequency prior to the investigation. When the frequency of an ADE exceeds 
the previously reported frequency or pre-specified accepted level, and if such ADE is critical in evaluating one or more of the study endpoints (such as safety endpoint), then an ADE can 
become an UADE and it must be properly reported and evaluated.  
10.2 Recording and Reporting of Adverse Device Effects 
10.2.1 Investigator Recording and R eporting 
The Investigators are responsible for rec ording and reporting all adverse device effects in the 
pertinent case report form  (CRF) . Unanticipated adverse device effects that pose a safety risk to 
the patient must be reported to sponsor and reviewing IRBs per local reporting requirements.  
 
The Investigator must next assess the seriousness of the adverse device effect. The Investigator 
should also assess whether the adverse device effect i s anticipated or unanticipated.  At each 
contact [CONTACT_1155], the investigator must collect information on adverse device effects . 
 
All adverse device effects occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course 
of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that 
the study treatment or participation is not the cause. Serious adverse device effects that are still 
ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to determine the final outcome. Any 
serious adverse device effects that occur  within [ADDRESS_951153] receive both Sponsor and the investigator’s IRB 
approval before  they are initiated unless subject safety is at r isk. Any protocol deviations initiated 
without Sponsor and the investigator’s IRB approval that may affect the scientific soundness of the study, or affect the rights, safety, or welfare of study subjects, must be reported to the Sponsor

[ADDRESS_951154] be signed by [CONTACT_633833]’s designee. If the Investigators designate an individual to sign 
these forms, written notification must be provided to the Sponsor. The Investigators are 
responsible for maintaining records of study protocol deviations and amendments and all  
significant correspondence relating to the study. The Sponsor will provide an Investigator 
Notebook to serve as a study reference and regulatory binder. At the conclusion of the study, the Investigators will provide a summary report to the Sponsor and the reviewing IRB. 
 
11.3 Data Coordination Center (DCC)  
The Sponsor will act as the Data Coordination Center (DCC)  and has responsibility for clinical 
data coordination. The DCC will provide management of data for the overall project. All case report forms will be collected directly by [CONTACT_15791].

(eCRFs) will be implemented within Clindex LIVE  by [CONTACT_633834]’s Clinical Data Manager.  Data will be 
entered at the investigational sites by [CONTACT_32341].  Entered data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_133052], who will affirm its accuracy and completeness by [CONTACT_633835]-off.  All data queries, 
whether automatically or manually generated, will be communicated to and cleared by 
[CONTACT_633836] .  A final comprehensive review of all of the data will occur 
at the conclusion of the trial.  All queries will be resolved and all eCRFs will be electronically 
signed by [CONTACT_700686]. 
12.2.3 Electronic Data Capture (EDC) System  
User acceptance testing at ZOLL will demonstrate accurate and complete functioning of all data 
and edit check elements prior to rollout of the EDC system to the investigational sites.  The clinical 
database will be hosted at Fortress Medical Systems, LLC, using redundant on- and off-site 
resources, throughout the data collection process.  Data access (both entry and review) will be 
controlled by [CONTACT_633838].  Only users who hav e been 
appropriately trained will be permitted to perform data entry.  Once entered by [CONTACT_8786], data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_633839].  The 
Clindex LIVE  system features a fully documented audit trail on all CRF data modified after first 
pass entry and automatic audit trail on all data changes.  Individual report level security allows for 
a customized report environment for individual users and sites, so that users and sites may access 
only the data which they have entered into the system.  The Clindex LIVE  system has been 
independently certified to be 21 CFR Part 11 compliant.

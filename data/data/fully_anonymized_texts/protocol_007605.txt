26-Apr-2021   2. Background and  Rationale  
 
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by [CONTACT_315379]. It is a highly prevalent condition that affects an estimated 14% of 
adult men and 5% of adult women aged 30 to 70 [1] . OSA is associated with more than 
[ADDRESS_388145] for the diagnosis of OSA 
is polysomnography, these in -laboratory tests are expensive, time consuming, and labor 
intensive.  
In recent years there is a growing use of  home sleep tests (HSTs) as a more convenient 
and cost -effective alternative to diagnose sleep disorders. Nevertheless, HSTs currently 
on the market contain several complex wires and tubes that may make it difficult for 
patients to use on their own. In add ition, patients report that they can be intrusive and 
uncomfortable. These factors lead to unreliable data collection and ineffective diagnosis 
of OSA [2]. 
TatchSleep Pro  is a system comprised of flexible, thin, and wireless adhesive patch es, 
coupled with a n FDA -cleared compatible  pulse oximeter, for the detection of sleep apnea. 
The wearable sensor s detect various physiological parameters related to sleep quality, 
including respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] , SpO2,  and sleep position, and transmits data wirelessly t o a 
smartphone app in real time. The data recorded by [CONTACT_315380], from where it  is downloaded to a local PC. The study output file is prepared by 
[CONTACT_315381] a qualified sleep scorer.  
The TatchSleep Pro  device was bench -tested against industry standard polysomnography  
devices to compare the different sensors. Using its proprietary technology, TatchSleep 
Pro showed excellent accuracy and sensitivity in measuring respi[INVESTIGATOR_315368]. 
Previous feas ibility testing was conducted on approximately [ADDRESS_388146] physicians in 
determining the overall Apnea Hypopnea Index ( AHI) of a patient. Tatch , Inc. has 
partnered with the multiple clinical sites  for this study.

or may not be aware of the study.   
 
8. Study Procedures and Assessments  
 
8.1 Eligibility Assessment and Informed Consent  
An informed consent form (I CF) must be signed by [CONTACT_315386] -specific procedures.  
 
The Investigator or designee will confirm that the patient meets  all inclusion and  no 
exclusion criteria.  
15  
 
 
PROTOCOL NUMBER: TCH -[ADDRESS_388154] will be given a sign ed copy of the ICF to take home. Adult subjects unable 
to provide written informed consent on their own behalf will not be eligible for the study.  
 
The ICF and any other written information provided to the patients will be revised 
whenever important new information becomes available that may be relevant to the 
patient 's consent, or if there is an amendment to the protocol which necessitates a change 
to the content of the patient 's informed consent. Any written ICF and written information 
must receive approval by [CONTACT_315387]. Only the most up to date IRB -
approved ICF must be used to consent new patients.

on Day 1 in order to rule out pregnancy prior to starting the study.  
 
8.3 Complete Patient Case Report Form (CRF)  
CRFs will be provided for the recording of data. The I nvestigator or designee will record 
data from all observations and assessments specified in the protocol, including 
demographics, physical attributes and adverse events  on the CRFs provided by [CONTACT_429].   
 
8.4 Polysomnogra phy  
Patients will be hooked up to a PSG  on Day 1 (Night) according to the standard of care at 
the clinical site.  This will record brain waves, blood oxygen level, heart rate and breathing, 
as well as eye and leg movements.   
 
8.[ADDRESS_388156] the patches on the 
patient 's chest and abdomen, as well as the pulse oximeter on the patient 's finger. Once 
the sensors are set up  and the participant is ready for bed , the investigator or designee 
will start the data collection using the app.  
 
Details about TatchSleep Pro  management can be found in Protocol Section 11. 
 
8.6 Follow -up Communication  
A follow -up communication (email or phone call) will be made with patients within 5 days 
after the sleep study to check in on how they are doing and follow -up on any adverse 
events. If after three documented attempts the patient could not be reached for fe edback, 
the patient will be considered as "lost to follow -up". 
 
16  
 
 
PROTOCOL NUMBER: TCH -[ADDRESS_388157] at the study site . Raw PSG sleep data  (including, at a minimum, respi[INVESTIGATOR_315369], respi[INVESTIGATOR_27111] , respi[INVESTIGATOR_315370] ) will be 
extracted and presented to qualified readers as described below.  
 
9. Study Scoring  
Once study enrollment and all sleep tests are complete,  and all exported PSG data (with 
position annotat ions and sleep staging ) has been received by [CONTACT_1034],  the primary 
reader  will score all sleep study recordings made simultaneously with TatchSleep Pro and 
the PSG device  from all sites .  The primary reader  will be blinded to the device used to 
collect the data under review as well as any information which may allow them to link the 
two studies from each patient.  The AHI will be calculated for each study, and the set of 
AHIs derived from TatchSleep Pro data  will be compared with those derived from PSG 
data using Pearson correlation to demonstrate accuracy (see Protocol Section 11 for more 
details).   At least one and up to two additional readers (secondary readers) will each score 
all sleep study recordings m ade using the TatchSleep Pro device  at all sites .  The AHIs 
derived from these scorings will be used to calculate the inter -rater reliability for the 
TatchSleep Pro device signals.   
 
9.1 Scoring Population  
Studies of subjects whose TatchSleep Pro recording doe s not encompass the sleep period 
indicated by [CONTACT_315388] [3].  Studies from a ll other  participants who are 
enrolled, meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, and whose PSG 
study has >4 hours of sleep duration  will be scored  [3].   
 
9.2 Reasons for Data Exclusion  
Time periods marked by [CONTACT_315389] "Movement" or "Artifact" (collectively referred to as 
"invalid") in a study will not contribute to the total sleep time for the purpose of calculating 
AHI for that study (per guidelines in the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) 
Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events section IX: Home Sleep Apnea 
Testing Rules for Adults).   Percentage of "invalid" time will be reported for each study.  
 
9.3 Blinding  
All stud ies will be presented on the same viewing and scoring platform.  The readers will 
be blinded to patient identification and the data collection device for each study.  
Specifically:  
 
• All data presented to the reader will be fully anonymized and will not inc lude any 
information which could allow the reader to link a subject 's two data sets.  All 
Protected Health Information (PHI), ID numbers, and study meta -data such as time 
17  
 
 
PROTOCOL NUMBER: TCH -110  
VERSION 1 .1 
26-Apr-2021   and date will be removed.  
• The reader will review patient studies in a predetermined r andomized order such 
that sequential readings of data from the same patient will be avoided.  
• All studies will be reviewed using the same analysis software, and using identical, 
system -agnostic signal labeling (eg, "Flow " will be used to label both the 
TatchSleep Pro TATCH -SUM -FLOW and the PSG Airflow waveforms).  
 
9.4 Scoring Procedure  
Readers  will be asked to score studies using the provided viewing software as they 
normally would in a clinical setting and in accordance with the AASM Manual for the 
Scoring of S leep and Associated Events.  Hypopneas will be scored using the 
recommended rule 1A criterion as laid out in the AASM (v2.6), Chapter VIII Respi[INVESTIGATOR_315371] 1: Rules for Adults, Section D: Scoring of Hypopneas.  
 
The same data channels will be presente d to the reader in the same order and with the 
same labelling for every study, including:  
• Abdominal respi[INVESTIGATOR_21266], labelled "ABD" from either the PSG system or the 
TatchSleep Pro patches, as applicable  
• Thorax respi[INVESTIGATOR_21266], labelled "THX" from either the PSG system or the 
TatchSleep Pro patches as applicable  
• Position channel, labelled "Position " from either the PSG system or the 
TatchSleep Pro patches, as applicable  
• Air flow (PSG) or Tatch -Sum-Flow (TatchSleep Pro) as applicable , labelled "Flow " 
• Nasal pressure (PSG) or Tatch -Sum-Pressure (TatchSleep Pro) as applicable , 
labelled "Pressure " 
• Pulse oximetry -derived blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), labelled "SpO2 " from 
either the PSG system or the TatchSleep Pro compatible pulse oximeter as 
applicable  
 
On any of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_32713], the reader will be able to mark:  
• Apnea  
• Hypopnea  
 
On the SpO2  signal, the reader will be able to mark:  
• Relative desaturation  
 
Additionally, the reader may mark any signal with the following signal quality indicators:  
• Artifact  
• Movement  
 
9.5 AHI Calculation  
The AHI will be calculated for each study following scoring .  The PSG total sleep time  (with 
device -specific total artifact  time subtracted ) will be used as the  AHI denominator .

11. TatchSleep Pro  Materials and Management  
 
11.[ADDRESS_388159] physiological parameters related to sleep disorders in patients. The system has two 
sensor patches and makes use of a compatible  FDA-cleared  pulse oximeter.  Each patch 
consists of a wearable sensor and a bottom layer of double coat medical -grade a dhesive. 
This adhesive is safe for patient use and enables the patch to stay affixed to the body 
(thorax and abdomen) throughout the night. The sensor also connects directly to a battery 
which is hidden within the patch.  During the study, patients will be asked to wear all three 
sensors  (one patch on the abdomen, one patch on the thorax and the pulse oximeter on 
a finger ).   Data from the patches and pulse oximeter are transmitted wirelessly throughout 
the night to a secure cloud server via the companion mobile application for clinicians to 
upload to a sleep analysis platform.  
 
11.2 Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] , Storage  and Accountability  
TatchSl eep Pro  sensors will be sent in packages to the clinical site  by a tracked postal 
service  prior to the enrollment of the patients . Each shipment will  include up to 10  patient 
kits, depending on the site projected enrollment rate.  E ach TatchSleep Pro  kit will contain 
2 patches, a pulse oximeter,  and a User M anual . Smartphones will be provided to the 
clinical  site with the TatchSleep Pro  companion application pre -loaded. Study staff will be 
trained on the use and functionalities of TatchSleep Pro  and the companion application 
prior to  enrollment.

PROTOCOL NUMBER: TCH -[ADDRESS_388160] or damaged.  
 
11.3 TatchSleep Pro  Associated Risks  
Per the FDA guidelines "Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies " 
[4] and based on 21 CFR 812.3(m), TatchSleep Pro  qualifies as a Non -Significant Risk 
device since TatchSleep Pro : 
• Is not intended as an implant and does not  present a potential for serious risk to 
the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;  
• Is not purported or represented to be for use supporting or sustaining human life 
and does not  present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of 
a subject;  
• Is not for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or 
treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and does 
not present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;  
or 
• Does not  otherwise present  a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or 
welfare of a subject.  
 
Although there is minimal risk in using the TatchSleep Pro technology, p atients may 
experience some slight discomfort wearing the TatchSleep Pro  patches or the compatible 
pulse oximeter  throughout the night. It is possible that patients with sensitive skin may 
experience mild skin irritation  due to the patch adhesive. A similar  skin irritation  risk exists 
in the PSG test. Patients will be clearly ins tructed that they are allowed to remove the 
TatchSleep Pro  patches, pulse oximeter,  or the adhesive from the PSG study if they 
experience skin irritation  or significant discomfort at any point. A previous analysis showed 
no adverse events amongst a cohort of 19 patients undergoing full night tests wearing the 
TatchSleep Pro patches . 
 
There is also a risk that the technology will not function as anticipated causing partial 
recording of the study night which might make data unusable. It will be explained to t he 
participants that these technologies are still evolving, and they may experience glitches or 
malfunctions during the study.

PSG and TATCH AHI is greater than the performance goal (PG) using a significance level 
of 0.025.  
The hypotheses to be tested are:  
𝐻0:𝜌 ≤𝑃𝐺    versus  𝐻𝑎: 𝜌 >𝑃𝐺  
 
where ρ is the Pearson correlation between PSG and TatchSleep Pro AHI and 𝑃𝐺 is the 
performance goal. The performance goal is set to be 0.862, the lower 95% confidence limit 
for the correlation of RDI and AHI between PSG and Peripheral Arterial Tonometry  (PAT) 
as calculated in a meta -analysis of 12 studies [ 5]. Fisher 's transformation and one -sided

to test the hypotheses with a significance level of 0.05.  All three null hypotheses need to be 
rejected in order for the trial to be successful.  
 
 
14.6 Secondary Outcomes Ev aluation  
• A weighted Deming regression of TatchSleep Pro AHI on PSG AHI will be run. 95% 
confidence intervals for the slope and intercept will be obtained.  
• The inter -rater reliability, measured as the intra -class correlation (ICC) of AHI readings 
and its 9 5% confidence interval will be calculated.  
• Agreement between TatchSleep Pro and PSG apnea classification (mild, moderate, and 
severe, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine definition) will be 
calculated.  
• Bland -Altman plots and e stimation of the 95% limits of agreement between 
TatchSleep Pro and PSG  AHI for each position (supi[INVESTIGATOR_117342]. non -supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) . 
 
 
14.7 Primary Safety Evaluation  
The primary safety endpoints are the incidence of AEs and SAEs related to the device 
throughout the study per iod. 
 
 
14.8 Sample Size  
The correlation of PSG and TATCH AHI data on 19 subjects previously rated by a single 
rater was estimated to be 0.98.  We calculated the probability of rejecting the null 
hypothesis when the true correlation is 0.98 using the Pearson 's Correlation Tests 
Procedure of NCSS Power Analysis Statistical Software, Version 20 (PASS 20, [ 6]). A 
sample size of 46 subjects yields a power of 99.99%.  
 
The ICC of PSG and TATCH AHI data on 19 subjects was 0.95, we use this as an estimate 
for the sample size calculation. A sample of 46 subjects yields a 95% margin of error for 
the ICC of 5%, assuming a true ICC value of 0.95, using the Confidence Intervals for 
Intraclass Correlation Procedure of NCSS Power Analysis Statistical Software, Version 20 
(PASS 2 0, [6]). 
 
The upper and lower limits of agreement of  PSG and TATCH AHI data on [ADDRESS_388165] deviation increases with increasing AHI,  and the previous AHI 
range was 0 to 30 events/hour, we conservatively  assumed  a standard deviation of 7.0 
events/hour , yielding a standard deviation for the LOA of √3𝜎=12.1, as described in Bland -

26-Apr-2021   Appendix 1 – Bland -Altman LOA Meta -Analysis  
A meta -analysis was undertaken in support of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a performance goal for the primary 
effectiveness endpoint of the Bland -Altman 95% limits of agreement (LOA). A total of 7 studies 
of 7 different FDA approved devices were chosen that used manual scoring of AHI i n concurrent 
laboratory studies. A summary of the 7 devices used in the meta -analysis is provided in Table 1.

A random effects model was utilized to generate an estimate of the average lower and upper 
LOA across the 7 studies.  The random effects estimate was calculated using the Metafor  [1] 
(Meta -Analysis Package for R) package.  Restricted maximum likelihood wa s used to estimate 
the mean success rate and the variability among studies.  The mean lower LOA and 
confidence intervals for each of the 7 studies, as well as the random effects (RE) summary 
results are presented in Figure 1; results for the upper LOA are presented in Figure 2.  The 
random -effects model estimates a weighted least squares mean upper limit of 21.8 with a 95% 
confidence interval of 15.1 to 28.4; the random -effects model estimates a weighted least 
squares mean lower limit of -24.0 with a 95% co nfidence interval of -30.6 to -17.4.  From this 
analysis, it is reasonable to use 28.4 for the upper limit performance goal and -30.6 as the 
lower limit performance goal for the LOA primary effectiveness endpoint analysis in our study.

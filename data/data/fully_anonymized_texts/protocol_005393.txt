    4. SUMMARY  
Setmelanotide (also known as RM-493) is a synthetic 8- amino acid  cyclic peptide that functions as a 
potent melanocortin- 4 receptor (MC4R) agonist. Three setmelanotide formulations have been use d 
in nonclinical and clinical studies: setmelanotide in saline; setmelanotide in N -(Carbonyl-
methoxypolyethylene glycol 2000)-1,2- distearoyl - glycero -3-phosphoethanolamine sodium salt 
(setmelanotide/mPEG -DSPE); and setmelanotide- Once -Weekly (setmelanotide QW). Note that only 
the s
etmelanotide/mPEG -DSPE formulation and setmelanotide QW formulations are in use in 
clinical studies; the setmelanotide saline formulation is no longer employed.  
Setmela
notide is being evaluated for the treatment of severe early -onset genetic forms of obesity and 
associated co -morbidities, including subjects with pro -opi[INVESTIGATOR_356092] (POMC) deficiency 
obesity, leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency obesity, Prader- Willi syndrome (PWS), Bardet- Biedl 
syndrome (BBS), Alström syndrome (AS), a nd other genetic forms of early -onset extreme obesity 
arising from defects demonstrated or hypothesized to impact the hypothalamic MC4R signaling 
pathway. Based on accruing genetic and clinical insights, other genetic forms of early- onset extreme 
obesity m ay also be evaluated in setmelanotide clinical studies. It is expected that setmelanotide 
would be indicated to treat the obesity and excess appetite or feeding behavior symptoms of these severe forms of genetic obesity.  
Setmelanotide binds with high affinity (inhibitory constant [Ki] = 2.1 nM) to the human MC4R and is efficient in activating MC4R (half- maximal effective concentration [EC
50] = 0.27 nM). 
Setmelanotide was initially selected for clinical development based on its acceptable circulating 
half- life as a saline formulation administered as a continuous subcutaneous (SC) infusion (2.8 to 3.5 
hours in non-human primates) and the ability to decrease body weight gain and suppress food intake 
in normal rats. Additional studies demonstrated the efficacy of setmelanotide in suppressing food 
intake and body weight gain in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys. Later 
studies in obese monkeys showed that setmelanotide did not increase blood pressure (BP) or heart rate (HR), a potential concern  observed with other MC4R agonist compounds. 
Setmelanotide has also been studied in relevant genetic models of obesity, including leptin- receptor 
deficient Zucker fa/fa rats (a rodent model of genetic obesity impacting the MC4R pathway) and Magel2 -null mic e (a mouse model for PWS). Treatment of Zucker fa/fa rats with setmelanotide 
resulted in reductions in both body weight and food intake relative to placebo control. Furthermore, treatment of Magel2 -null mice with 0.1 mg/kg setmelanotide demonstrated a stat istically significant 
decrease in cumulative food intake. These data demonstrate that setmelanotide is effective in rodent 
models of PWS and genetic obesity, supporting the potential efficacy and testing in both monogenic 
and syndromic obesity. 
Significant safety margins are provided from a comprehensive set of toxicology studies, including 
repeat -dose and chronic toxicology studies in rats and monkeys, developmental and reproductive 
toxicology studies, and juvenile toxicology studies to support pediatric s ubject enrolment. These 
studies support the setmelanotide doses that have been used in clinical studies and that are 
anticipated in additional chronic studies in genetic obesity populations based on the no-observed-
adverse -effect level (NOAEL) of various parameters evaluated in the toxicity studies.

    5. INTRODUCTION  
Rhythm is focusing the development of setmelanotide as a treatment for patients with rare genetic 
disorders of obesity (RGDO) due to specific genetic defects that impact the functioning of the 
MC4R pathway , a highly conserved hypothalamic pathway critical for regulation of appetite, energy 
expenditure, and body weight. The MC4R pathway is the key pathway regulating weight and 
hunger. Genetic defects in the MC4R pathway cause insatiable hunger, leading to sev ere and early -
onset obesity 
Figure [ADDRESS_682110] and includes specific “upstream” genes in which 
an inactivating mutation results in RGDO. Specifically, we are focusing on obesity arising from lack 
of activation of MC4Rs due to defects in “upstream” genes. By [CONTACT_525642]4R (downstream portion of the pathway), setmelanotide is hypothesized to provide compelling and persistent 
efficacy. Setmelanotide, as a potent MC4R agonist, has demonstrated proof-of-concept in obesity 
resulting from POMC and LEPR deficiencies as well as obesity associated with BBS and AS, genetic syndromes that lead to cellular defects in LEPR signaling. Setmelanotide also has the 
potential to restore lost activity in the MC4R pathway in other “upstream” de fects in genes such as 
PCSK1  (responsible for POMC processing and thereby [CONTACT_525643]) and 
Magel2 (postulated to contribute to some of the features of Prader- Willi syndrome [PWS]). In this 
way, setmelanotide may serve as a form of “personalized replacement” therapy to re -establish 
appetite and energy homeostasis regulation, and ultimately restore weight control in patients with 
specific genetic defects.

5.1. Regulation of Appetite, Energy Expenditure , and Body Weight 
In mammals, body weight regulation is a function of energy intake (in the form of caloric consumption) and energy expenditure (in the form of basal metabolism/physical 
exertion/thermogenesis). Persistent disturbances in this equation result in alterations in body weight 

Protocol Amendment 10   RM-493- 014 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 21 of 87 Confidential 
    (weight gain if intake > expenditure , and weight loss if intake < expenditure). In principle, 
regulation of body weight is predicated on two  key steps: 1) evaluation of current energy needs 
(sensory actions) and 2) subsequent generation of physiological responses (appropriate modulat ion 
of food intake and expenditure) to meet those needs ( Gautron, 2015; Greenfield, 2009). The 
hypothalamus serves as a key sensory region that integrates information regarding energy state as 
commu nicated by [CONTACT_525644]. Information about short- term energy needs 
(hunger vs satiety) is communicated by [CONTACT_525645] (CCK), ghrelin , 
and peptide YY (PYY); in contrast, longer-term energy state (adiposity) is conveyed by [CONTACT_525646]
. Upon receiving th is information, neuronal pathways within the hypothalamus adjust their 
activity and modulate food intake and/or energy expenditure to achieve the acceptable energy state. 
One of the most critical neuronal pathways within the hypothalamus re sponsible for body weight 
regulation is the central melanocortin pathway.   
5.2. The Central Melanocortin Pathway (Melanocortin4 Receptors 
Pathway)  
The melanocortin pathway represents a fundamental component of centrally regulated energy 
balance.  
Melanocortin actions are initiated in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) by [CONTACT_525647], POMC neurons that produce endogenous 
melanocortins ( α-, β-melanocyte stimulating hormone [MSH]) and a neuronal population that 
produces agouti-related peptide (AgRP), an endogenous antagonist of melanocortins ( Cone, 2005).  
Both these neuronal populations form the “upstream” part of the central melanocortin pathway  
(Figure 2). The primary role of both AgRP and POMC neurons is to evaluate energy demand by [CONTACT_525648]. Once activated, both AgRP and POMC neurons release neurotransmitter/neuropeptides 
to engage “downstream” MC4R -expressing neurons to modulate food intake and energy expenditure 
to meet the energy demand ( Krashes, 2016).  
Figure  2: Schematic Outline of Hypothalamic Food Intake Control  
 

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_682111]: 
activated by [CONTACT_525649] (i.e., ghrelin) → release neuropeptide (i.e., AgRP) → inactivation 
(hyperpolarization) of downstream MC4R- expressing neurons → increase in energy intake, decrease 
in energy expenditure and weight gain ( Liu, 2012 ; Yang, 2011; Aponte, 2011; Krashes, 2011). In  
contrast, POMC- expressing neurons form the catabolic arm: activated by [CONTACT_525650] (i.e., leptin 
[LEP]) → release of bioactive product of POMC processing ( α-, β-MSH ) → activation 
(depolarization) of downstream MC4R -expressing neurons → suppression of food consumption, 
increase in energy  expenditure and weight loss ( Atasoy, 2012; Zhan, 2013; Dodd, 2015). Consistent 
with catabolic actions of α - and β -MSH, inactivating mutation s in POMC and MC4R  results in 
early -onset extreme obesity defined by [CONTACT_525651] ( Yeo, 
1998; Vaisse, 1998; Krude, 1998). Given the importance of this pathway in long- term body weight 
regulation, inactivating mutations in many critical components (LEP, LEPR, POMC, PCSK1, 
MC4R) of this pathway have been shown to cause RGDO characterized by [CONTACT_525652] s of 
hunger and marked hyperphagia.  
5.3. The Melanocortin4 Receptors  
The melanocortins regulate a wide range of physiological processes such as energy balance, steroidogenesis, sexual function, cardiovascular (CV) function, glucose homeostasis, emotional 
behavior, and secretion of several endocrine and exocrine factors ( Marks, 2001; Foster, 2003;  
Wikberg, 2008; Tao, 2010). All these diverse functions are regulated via five  mela
 nocortin 
receptors, MC1 -5Rs. The MC1R is the classical MSH receptor expressed in skin and hair follicles 
that regulates pi[INVESTIGATOR_371]. The MC2R is the classical adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) 
receptor expressed in the adrenal cortex that regulates adrenal steroidogenesis and stress response. 
The MC3Rs are predominantly in the central nervous system (CNS) and their role is not well 
defined ( Giradet, 2014). The MC5R is expressed widely and involved in regulating exocrine gland 
secretions ( Chen, 1997). MC4R is predominantly located in the CNS ; howe ver, MC4R expression in 
also observed in gut. MC4R regulates many different physiological endpoints such as appetite, 
energy expenditure, glucose homeostasis, and CV functions ( Krashes, 2016).  
Over
 last [ADDRESS_682112] suggested 
that MC4Rs are critical for regulation of appetite an d overall body weight ( Theile, 1998; Millington, 
2001;  Semjonous, 2009). This was corroborated by [CONTACT_525653]4R 
signaling causes profound obesity and hyperphagia in both rodents and humans. While 
pharmacological studies (Theile, 1998; Millington, 2001;  Semjonous, 2009) in rodents have 
implicated many different brain regions mediati ng appetite regulating effects, conditional knock-out 
mouse models suggest that the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) is the major site of action for MC4R- mediated appetite regulation  (Balthasar, 2005; Shah, 2014; Garfield, 2015) . It is believed 
that MC4R-regulated energy expenditure is mediated by [CONTACT_525654] (IML) of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]  (Berglund, 2014). In addition to 
energ 
y balance, MC4R activation is also associated with increase in BP and HR via the autonomic 
nervous system. Collectively, these observations suggest that an MC4R agonist should be effective for treating genetic form s of obesity by [CONTACT_525655].

    5.4. Rare Genetic Disorders of Obesity (RGDO)  
Human obesity is recognized as being influenced by [CONTACT_525656], with 
few single genes demonstrated to carry major phenotypic  effects on their own  (Stunkard, 1986; 
Wardle, 2008). Although obesity i s widespread and becomes more prevalent during adolescence and 
adulthood, many of the most severe forms of obesity begin early in infancy and childhood. Recent 
research has revealed numerous genetic mechanisms and specific mutations that lead to rare 
monogenic disorders characterized by [CONTACT_525657] ( van der Klaauw, 2015; Martos -Moreno, 2014). 
Complementary experiments in genetic rodent models and RGDO patients have led to the 
identification of a critical set of genes in the MC4R pathway  (van der Klaauw, 2015). The MC4R 
hypothalamic pathway was initially validated as an important genetic underpi[INVESTIGATOR_525623]4R result in early -onset and severe 
obesity ( Vaisse, 1998; Yeo, 1998). Now, an expanding set of monogenic obesity defects (in addition 
to loss of function mutations in the MC4R itself) have been identified; these obesity mutations 
involve genes in this pathway that are either upstream of MC4R – specifically , POMC deficiency 
obesity, pro-hormone convertase 1 (PCSK1) and LEPR deficiency obesity – or genes that are downstream of MC4R ( O'Rahilly, 1995; Ramachandrappa, 2011).  
Human genetics studies have identified several diseases that are the result of genetic defects 
affecting the MC4R pathway, including:  
• POMC deficiency obesity  due to mutations in the POMC gene 
• PCSK1 deficiency due to mutations in the PCSK1 gene, leading to a hormone processing defect that also causes POMC deficiency obesity  
• LEPR deficiency obesity due to mutations in the LEPR gene 
These MC4R pathway mutations c an cause RGDO that progresses over time and can become life-
threatening in severity.  
Rhythm is developi[INVESTIGATOR_525624] -onset genetic forms of obesity 
arising from defects demonstrated or hypothesized to occur upstream of the MC4R receptor and impact the hypothalamic MC4R signaling pathway. Based on accruing genetic and clinical insights, 
different genetic forms of early -onset extreme obesity may also be evaluated in setmelanotide 
clinical studies. It is expected that setmelanotide would be indicated to treat the obesity and excess 
appetite or feeding behavior symptoms of these severe forms of genetic obesity.

    7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Design and Plan of the Study 
This is a Phase 2, proof-of-concept study to assess initial safety and efficacy of setmelanotide within  
each identified subtype of rare genetic disorders of obes ity.  
Screening Period 
Upon providing informed consent, patients will enter the Screening Period, during which they will 
be assessed for eligibility and complete all screening procedures as described in the Schedule of Events. Each patient’s  genetic inform ation will be reviewed by [CONTACT_525658]. During the Screening Period, each patient will be  instructed to complete a 
hunger questionnaire on a daily basis and will be required to have completed at least four days of the questionnaire prior to first dose. 
Treatment Period  
Eligible patients will return to the clinic within 8 – 2 weeks of completing the Screening Visit for 
the Baseline Visit (Visit 2) and first dose of setmelanotide.  
Dose levels for all patients will escalate to a final dose of 3.0 mg/day during a n initial dose- titration 
phase, but the starting dose will depend on patient age. Patients 6 up to 16 years old will initially be 
dosed at 1 .0 mg/day for 2  weeks, beginning at the Baseline Visit  on Study Day 1. Starting o n Day 
15, the dose will escalate to 2 .0 mg /day and remain at that level for 2 weeks , until the patient return s 
to clinic for Visit 3  on Day 29. At Visit 3, the dose will be escalated to 3 .0 mg/day; the patient will 
continue dosing at 3.0 mg/day for 12 weeks.  
Patients ≥ 16 years old will initiate dosing at 2 .0 mg/day at the Baseline Visit,  and continue dosing at 
that level for 2 weeks. The dose will be escalated to 3.0 mg /day beginning on Study Day 15, and the 
patient will continue that dose for [ADDRESS_682113] any AEs.  
Patients will continue dosing at 3 .0 mg/day, and return to the clinic every four weeks (Visits 3 -5) to 
complete the assessments in  Table  3. After [ADDRESS_682114] setmelanotide injection. Participation in the 
study will then conclude in one of the following two ways: 
• Complete Visit 6 and enroll in a separate extension study , Rhythm Study RM-493- 022. If 
RM-493-022 is not yet open at the clinic site, the patient will continue daily 
setmelanotide injections  and other activities  per the current study, as presente d in the 
SOA ( Table  3). The patient will return to the clinic for Bridging Visits every 12  weeks 
for up to one year, until the extension study opens at the site. Additional clinic visits may 
be scheduled at the disc retion of the PI.  
Protocol Amendment 10   RM-493- 014 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 27 of 87 Confidential 
    • Decide not to participate in the extension study and proceed to the final study visit (Visit 
7) in 4 weeks.  
Patients on  study per a previous amendment should transition to dose escalation as outlined in this 
protocol :  
• Patients who are i n the dose titration phase and are not currently at a dose of 3.0 mg /day 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_525659], to determine if an increase in the dose to 3.0 mg /day is appropriate.  
• Patients who have completed dose titration and are assigned to a dose of less than 
3.0 mg/day will be assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_525625] 
3.0 mg/day is appropriate .  
• Patients who are post 16 weeks may roll into the separate extension study (RM-493-022) 
directly or via Bridging Visits,  or proceed to the final study  Visit 7 and finish the study.  
A flow chart summarizing  Study RM-493- 014 is presented in  Figure 3.  
Figure  3: Flow Chart for Study RM -493- 014 
 
 
7.2. Rationale for the Doses 
All patients will escalate to 3 .0 mg /day after 2 – 4 weeks on treatment , depending on age. Patients 6 
up to 16 years old will start at a dose of 1.0 mg /day for 2 weeks, escalate to 2 .0 mg /day for 2 weeks, 

Protocol Amendment 10   RM-493- 014

    Circumstances that may warrant ter mination include, but are not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to patients. 
• Failure to enter patients at an acceptable rate. This is particularly important, as the 
number of patients hoped to enroll in this study r epresents a substantial portion of all 
already identified patients worldwide.  
• Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements.  
• Insufficient complete and/or evaluable data.  
• Plans to modify, suspend, or discontinue the development of the study drug. 
• Termination of an individual population for a specific disorder of obesity if data from at least two, and possibly up to five, patients in that disorder fail to show substantial weight loss (e.g., no patients meet the threshold for continuation into extensions).  
In addition, it is still unclear how many patients will be required to assess the safety and efficacy of setmelanotide in each of these rare conditions before it is appropriate to transition to pi[INVESTIGATOR_6518]. Therefore, this study (or enrollment of any individual population within the study) may be either 
temporarily held or terminated when Rhythm determines that there are sufficient patient data in 
Phase [ADDRESS_682115], which will include outside advisors and will meet on a periodic basis to review the cumulative safety data from the trial and will make a recommendation 
to continue or modify the study, if needed.

    8. STUDY POPULATION  
8.1. Number of Patients 
It is expected that approximately 150 patients will be included in this protocol across multiple 
subgroups. Since the subgroups in this study are all rare, it is expected that the size of each subgroup 
will range from 1 – 15 patients. 
8.2. Inclusion Criteria  
1. Patients with the following genotypes and/or clinical assessment : 
a. POMC/PCSK1/LEPR heterozygous

weight loss agents including herbal medications that has resulted in > 2% weight loss.  
2. Use of any medication that is approved to treat obesity within three months of first dose of 
study drug (e.g., orlistat, lorcaserin, phentermine- topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], naltrexone -bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]). Note:  
Glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP -1) receptor agonists may be used up to the dose approved for 
the treatment of diabetes mellitus (e.g., liraglutide up to a daily dos e of 1.8 mg) as long as (1) 
is it not being prescribed for the treatment of obesity, (2) the dose has been stable for at least 
three months prior to enrollment, (3) the patient has not experienced weight loss during the 
previous three months, AND (4) the patient intends to keep the dose stable throughout the course of the study.

not successful, or resulted in <10% weight loss compared to pre-operative baseline weight or clear evidence of weight regain after an initial response to bariatric sur gery. All patients with 
a history of bariatric surgery must be discussed with  and receive approval from the Sponsor  
prior to enrollment.  
4. Diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, personality disorder or other psychiatric disorder(s) that the Investigator believes will interfere significantly with study compliance. 
Neurocognitive disorders affecting ability to consent will not be disqualifying as long as an 
appropriate guardian able to give consent has been appointed.

haploinsufficiency obesity must be evaluated during the Screening Period for hepatic fibrosis 
Protocol Amendment 10   RM-493- 014 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 32 of 87 Confidential 
    by [CONTACT_497457] (e.g., transient elastography or magnetic resonance 
elastography ). Any patient with moderate or greater fibrosis ( e.g., the equivalent of a 
METAVIR score  ≥ 2) will be excluded from the study.  Note:  A patient with a diagnosis of 
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or non -alcoholic steatohepatitis (NA SH) may be 
allowed to enroll in the study, after consultation with the Sponsor. Other significant liver 
disease, such as cirrhosis, are exclusionary.  
9. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <30 mL/min at Screening.

(excluding non- invasive basal or squamous cell lesion) , determined as part of a 
comprehensive skin evaluation performed by a qualified dermatologist during Screening . 
Any concerning lesions identified during the Screening P eriod will be biopsied and results 
known to be benign prior to enrollment. If the pre -treatment biopsy results are of concern, 
the patient may need to be excluded from the study.  
12. Patient  is, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_525621], not suitable to participate in the study. 
13. Participation in any clinica l study with an investigational drug/device within [ADDRESS_682118] day of dosing.

16. Inability to comply with QD injection regimen.  
17. Females who are breastfeeding or nursing.  
8.4. Patient Identification and Registration  
All patients screened for the study will be assigned a unique screening number which will be a combination of study number (014), 3-digit site number , and a sequential 3 -digit number ; this 
screening number  will be used to identify patients throughout their participation in the study. 
Screening numbers will be assig ned sequentially starting at 001 (i.e., the first patient screened at site 
10 would be assigned screening number 014-010-001). Once a patient number has been assigned, it 
cannot be reused. 
8.5. Withdrawal of Patients  
Patients will be informed that they have the  right to withdraw from the study at any time for any 
reason, without prejudice to their medical care. The Investigator also has the right to withdraw patients from the study, after discussion with the Sponsor, for any of the following reasons: 
Protocol Amendment 10   RM-493- 014 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 33 of 87 Confidential 
    • AEs, which justify treatment or study withdrawal. For specific predefined events, 
additional monitoring and guidance for the Investigator is provided in Appendix D  and 
Appendix E . 
• Non-adherence to study drug regimen or protocol requirements. 
• Non-compliance with instructions or failure to return for follow -up. 
8.6. Duration of Patient Participation  
After completing the screening assessments within 8 – 2 weeks, all patients will participate in the study for a minimum of 16 additional weeks. After 16 weeks, the duration of patient participation 
will be as follows:  
• +0 weeks for patients immediately enrolling into a separate extension study (Rhythm 
Protocol RM -493-022). Total duration: 16 weeks. 
+TBD weeks for patients completing Bridging Visits until the extension study is initiated 
at the site. The purpose of the Bridging Visits is to ensure continuous treatment for patients if initiation of the extension s tudy is delayed at the site. The Bridging Visits can 
occur at a frequency of up to every 12 weeks (for a maximum of 1 year) and/or at the discretion of the  Primary Investigator . Total duration: uncertain, but > 16 weeks, 
maximum of 16 months. 
• +4 weeks for patients not entering the extension study and proceeding to the final study visit.  Total duration: [ADDRESS_682119] is formulated at a concentration of 10 mg/mL, and [ADDRESS_682120] carton. 
9.2. Study Drug Dose Levels  
The dose levels are outlined in Table 2. The dose escalation at Study Day 15 (start of Week 3) will 
occur at the patient’s home. The site will call the patient to confirm that the escalation has occurred  
and to record any AEs. Table  2: Study Drug Dose Levels by [CONTACT_525663] 6 up to 16 Years Old 
(mg/day) For Patients ≥  16 Years Old  
(mg/day) 
[ADDRESS_682121] be kept in a secure, limited- access storage area at a temperature between 2°C 
and 8°C. Setmelanotide is stable at room temperature for a short period that will allow patients to 
transport study drug home; ice packs and cooler bags will be provided to patients to transport the 
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_682122] be stored in the patient’s 
refrigerator. Opened study drug may be stored at room temperature for up to [ADDRESS_682123] or other appropriate individual. Drug accountability records indicating the delivery date to the site, inventory at the site, use by [CONTACT_6904], return of all used study drug to the study center, and return 
to Rhythm (or disposal of the drug, if approved by [CONTACT_525664]) will be maintained by [CONTACT_977]. 
Reasons for departure from the expected di spensing regimen must also be recorded. The Sponsor or 
its designee will review drug accountability at the site during monitoring visits.  
Compliance to dosing will be monitored throughout the study by [CONTACT_525665] a daily dosing log that records daily dosing information, including the time of dosing, location of the injection , and the amount of drug dosed. If a patient is non- compliant with the dosing schedule, the 
Sponsor may implement steps to ensure compliance, e.g., sending a nurse to the patient’s home for retraining or having a nurse administer the study drug. 
9.7. Prior and Concomitant Treatment 
Prohibited Medication and Substances  
Unless concomitant medications are likely to present a strong potential safety concern, the general goal of this protocol is to allow as many patients with these ultra -rare conditions to participate in the 
study as possible. 
Medications that are approved to treat obesity (e.g., orlistat, lorcaserin, phentermine -topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], 
naltrexone-bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]) are not allowed within three months of first dose of study drug (e.g., 
enrollment) and are prohibited during the course of the study. 
GLP -1 receptor agonists may be used up to the dose approved for the treatment of diabetes mellitus 
(e.g., liraglutide up to a daily dose of 1 .8 mg) as long as (1) it is not being prescribed for the 
treatment of obesity, (2) the dose has been stable for at least three months prior to enrollment, (3) the 
patient has not experienced weight loss during the previous three months, AND (4) the patient intends to keep the dose stable throughout the course of the study. 
Other medications that may cause weight loss (e.g. , stimulants) are allowed as long as the patient (1) 
has used a stable dose for at least three months prior to enrollment, (2) has not lost weight during the 
previous three months, and (3) intends to keep the dose of the medication stable through the course 
of the study. 
All concomitant medications should be kept at a stable dose throughout the course of the study, 
unless a dose change is necessary to treat an AE .

3. A comprehensive skin evaluation will be performed by a dermatologist. The skin exam should include a full body skin exam (head -to-toe skin 
examination) from a trained and licensed dermatologist. Any concerning lesions identified during the Screening Period will be biopsied and 
results known to be benign prior to first dose of setmelanotide. If the pre -treatment biopsy results are of concern, the patient will be excluded 
from the study. Additionally, any lesion or change in an existing lesion during the course of the study must be evaluated by [CONTACT_525666], if clinically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_525628]. Any biopsies must be evaluated by a trained dermat opathologist, and 
biopsy reports must be part of the study information for each patient  (Section  11.6). 
4. Weight (kg) is to be measured at the clinic using the same scale throughout the study, after patients have emptied their bladder s and bowels and 
after fasting fo r at least 8  hours. Patients are to wear light clothing or underwear  and no shoes, and will be weighed at approximately the same 
time of day. Weight measurements are to be done in triplicate  (Section  11.8) .  
5. Waist circumference (cm) will be single measures  (Section  11.9) . 
6. For patients ≥18 year s of age, height needs to be measured at the screening visit  only. Height (cm) will be measured, without shoes, socks , or 
hats, using a wall -mounted stadiometer. All measurements will be done in triplicate at each timepoint and recorded to the nearest 10th  of a 
decimal place (Section  11.10 ).  
8. All
 BP and HR measurements are to be obtained in the sitting position following at least [ADDRESS_682126]. All measurements will be taken in

    11. PATIENT ASSESSMENTS AND REQUIREMENTS  
Order of Assessments  
When scheduled at the same time point, the order of procedures should be as follows: obtain vital 
signs, perform 12- lead ECG, and perform blood draws (at the specified time point, if applicable). 
Adjustments may be made depending upon specific circumstances and in consultation with the 
Sponsor. 
11.1. Sponsor Review of Patient Genetics and/or Genetic Testing  
The genetic background of each patient must be reviewed by [CONTACT_525667]. For patients that have not had a previous genetic 
sample taken, a blood sample will be obtained at Screening for genetic confirmation of a genetic 
disorder of obesity.  
In addition, enrollment of patients in some subgroups may be prioritized by [CONTACT_525668] (1) well described, high- impact genetic mutations, (2) a variety of 
genetic variants, or (3) genetic variants likely to respond to setmelanotide. 
11.2. Informed Consent/Assent  
A complete descriptio n of the study is to be presented to each potential patient, and signed and dated 
informed consent and/or assent is to be obtained before any study- specific procedures are 
performed.  
11.3. Inclusion/Exclusion Review  
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are to be r eviewed per the SOA  (Table  3) to ensure the patient is 
eligible for the study.  
For Exclusion Criterion 9, GFR at Screening will  be determined using the Modification of Diet in 
Renal Disease (MDRD) Equation in patients ≥ 18 years of age ( Appendix H ), and the Bedside 
Schwartz Equation in patients <18 years of age ( Appendix I ). 
11.4. Demographics, Concomitant Medications and Medical History Review  
Medical history and demographic data including the patient’s gender, race, date of birth, and 
concomitant medication use will be obtained for all patients during the Screening Period  
(Appendix C ). 
The medical history should be updated on Day [ADDRESS_682129] dose of study drug, to assess continued study eligibility and adherence to final inclusion/exclusion criteria. This medical history update 
includes a review for changes from Screening as well as a review of the patient’s recent medication use to assess whether any changes have occurred since the previous visit.

    11.5. Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination will include review of peripheral lymph nodes, head, eyes 
(including conjunctiva), ears, nose, mouth and oropharynx, neck, heart, lungs, abdomen, 
musculoskeletal including back, extremities, and neurologic assessments.  
Changes from baseline in any physical examination findings identified by [CONTACT_525669] t Form 
(eCRF ). 
Patients will also be assessed at baseline according to ; any patients who have not 
reached  will be assessed according to the SOA  (Table  3). 
11.6. Comprehensive Skin Exam  
The Investigator will identify a trained and licensed dermatologist to serve as a consultant for the Investigative Site.  
The dermatologist will perform comprehensive skin examinations, which should include a full body 
skin exam (head- to-toe skin examination). Each patient will receive this comprehensive, head -to-toe 
dermatology examination as part of Screening and prior to the end of the study. Any worrisome 
lesion should be biopsied prior to study start, and all biopsies must be evaluated by a trained dermatopathologist.  
Additionally, any lesion or change in an existing lesion during the course of the study must be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_525670], if clinically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_525629]. All biopsies must be evaluated by a trained dermatopathologist.  
In the event a patient experiences changes to skin or skin lesions that are unresolved (or have not 
significantly improved or are close to resolution) at the end of study, th e patient may be asked to 
return for additional follow up assessments to document progress towards resolution.  
Biopsy reports must be part of the study information for each patient.  
Protection from Sun 
It is also important that patients do not participate in any activities that will intentionally cause their 
skin to tan (e.g., visit ultraviolet [UV] tanning salons, use spray tanners or  self-tanning lotions, etc.).  
11.7. Fitzpatrick Scale  
Each patient is to be categorized for skin type according to the Fitzpatrick scale (Fitzpatrick 1975), 
depi[INVESTIGATOR_162036] B . 
11.8. Weight 
Weight (kg) will be recorded as shown in the SOA ( Table  3). All measurements will be done in 
triplicate at each timepoint. Whenever possible, the same scale should be used throughout the study, 
including the Screening Visit, and should be calibrated on a regular basis. Weight should be 

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_682130] moderate or greater liver fibrosis (e.g., the 
equivalent of a METAVIR score ≥ 2).  
11.13.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be obtained in the sitting position following at least [ADDRESS_682131] at the time points indicated in the SOA ( Table  3). 
Blood Pressure and Heart Rate 
Blood pressure (BP; mmHg) and heart rate (HR; beats per minute  [bpm]) evaluations will be 
performed using the same methodology throughout the study (manual or automated). For a detailed 
description of the standardized BP measurement to be utilized in this study , see Appendix F .  
Special attention should be paid to ensure the appropriate cuff size in this patient population. 
Repeat measures and more frequent monitoring can be implemented for significant increases in BP 
or HR.  
To allow for a trough blood pressure reading, the patient should be instructed not to take the study 
medication on study days when vital signs are to be measured in the clinic.  
Body Temperature and Respi[INVESTIGATOR_525630] (°C) and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487] (breaths/minute) will be obtained in the sitting position following at least [ADDRESS_682132].  
11.14.  ECG (12- lead) 
Single 12- lead ECGs will be performed following a period of at least [ADDRESS_682133] in the 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. ECGs will be collected according to the SOA ( Table  3). During V isit 2 ECG will be 
collected prior to dosing and ~[ADDRESS_682134]-dose.  
11.14.1. ECG Procedures 
All ECGs should be performed according to the SOA ( Table  3) with the following guidelines:  
• ECG technicians should be thoroughly trained in the administration of a 12- Lead ECG, 
the institution’s specific protocols and procedures for ECG tests , and the requirements of 
the study protocol.  
• The same make and model of ECG machine with the same style o f leads should be used 
for all patients. Such equipment should be recently serviced and calibrated. Machine calibration records and performance data should be maintained on file.  
• Patients should be in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_525631] 10 minutes.

    11.14.2. Read ing ECGs  
• Site Monitoring: Sites should read ECGs for study monitoring and eCRFs per their usual 
procedures. 
• Central Reading : The Sponsor may elect, if needed for regulatory reasons, to collect 
ECGs for Central Reading. If so, the intention will be that a s ingle Central R eader will 
read all ECGs. Therefore, all ECGs must be available and stored for this purpose. When 
sent for Central Reading, the ECGs must be prepared to be read in a blinded fashion. 
Central Readers of ECGs should be blinded to time, treatme nt, and patient identifier.  
11.15.  Pregnancy Test  
Contraception  
Females must not be pregnant and must have a negative serum pregnancy test result at the Screening Visit and negative urine pregnancy test on Day 1, with results known prior to initiating dosing; 
pregnancy testing will be monitored during the study. 
For females able to bear children, including pre -pubertal females if relevant, a highly reliable form 
of contraception must be used/practiced throughout the study and for 90 days following the study. 
Highly reliable acceptable forms of contraception include hormonal (i.e., oral, implantable, or 
injectable) AND single- barrier method (i.e., condom), or an Intrauterine Device (IUD) AND single-
barrier method (i.e., condom) or vasectomized partner. True abstinence is acceptable only if it is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
Females of non-childbearing potential, defined as surgically sterile (status post hysterectomy, 
bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation), post-menopausal for at least [ADDRESS_682135] agree to use contraception : (A) use a double barrier method [i.e., 
condom AND diaphragm with spermicide during intercourse]), (B) had a vasectomy , or (C) abstain 
from sexual intercourse . True abstinence is acceptable only if it is the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the patient. Male patients must not donate sperm for 90 days following participation in the study.

    11.25.  Telephone Call  
The site will call a patient’s home on Day 15 to assess AEs and ensure the patient escalated to the 
appropriate dose depending on age, as outlined in the SOA ( Table  3).  
11.26.  Study Drug Administration  
Study drug will be administered daily as outlined in the SOA ( Table  3).  
11.27.  Dispensing /Return of Study Drug 
Study drug will be dispensed as outlined in the SOA ( Table  3) and Section  9.5. Any unused drug 
will be returned to the clinic site and the Sponsor as described in Section  9.6.  
11.28.  Adverse Event Assessment  
Each patient must be carefully monitored for the development of any AEs throughout the study from 
Screening through the Final Study Visit. This information should be obtained in the form of non-
leading questions (e.g., “How are you feeling?”), and from signs and symptoms detected during each 
examination, from laboratory evaluation, observations of study personnel, and spontaneous reports from pati ents. 
All AEs, including injection site reactions and potential systemic reactions , will be graded using the 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) grading 
system.  
Complete details on AE monitoring are provide d in Section  12. 
11.29.  Concomitant Medication(s) Review

    12. ADVERSE EVENTS 
Monitoring of AEs will be conducted throughout the study. AEs will be recorded in the CRFs from 
Screening through the Final Study Visit. AEs  that occur after the start of study drug administration 
will be considered TEAEs. SAEs will be recorded through the Final Study Visit (EOS Visit 7, or 
Treatment Discontinuation) . All AEs  should be monitored until they are resolved or are clea rly 
determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es).  
12.1. Definitions, Documentation, and Reporting 
An adverse event (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug -related. An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) 
can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An AE 
can arise from any  use of the drug (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and 
from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
An AE is considered serious ( SAE) if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor , it resu lts in 
any of the following outcomes: 
• Death.  
• Life-threatening. Life -threatening means that the patient was at immediate risk of death 
from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically 
might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form. 
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_171016]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but planned prior to study entry, are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the patient was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected manner during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned). 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical event. An important medical event is an event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124495], 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the patient or patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definitions for SAEs. Examples of such medical events incl ude allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse. 
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_682136] be carefully monitored for the development of any AEs. This information should 
be obtained in the form of non-leading questions (e.g., “How are you feeling?”) and from signs and 
symptoms detected during each examination, observations of study personnel, and spontaneous reports from patients.  
All AEs (serious and non-serious) spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_5363]/or in response to an open question from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other diagnostic procedures will be recorded on the appropriate CRF. Any clinically relevant deterioration 
in laboratory assessments or other clinical findings is considered an AE and must be recorded on the 
appropriate CRF. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event. 
All SAEs that occur during the study must be reported by [CONTACT_13658] [ADDRESS_682137] be reported whether 
or not considered causally related to the study drug. SAE forms will be completed and the 
information collected will include patient number, a narrative description of the event, and an 
assessment by [CONTACT_525672] e event and relatedness to study drug. Follow-
up information on the SAE may be requested by [CONTACT_4885]. 
 All SAE correspondence should be addressed to  
  Email: [EMAIL_10029]   
 
If ther
e are serious, unexpected adverse drug reactions associated with the use of the study drug, 
Rhythm or designee will notify the appropriate regulatory agency(ies), Ethics Committees (EC), and 
all participating Investigators on an expedited basis. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to 
promptly notify the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) of all unexpected serious adverse drug reactions involving risk to human patients. An unexpected event is 
one that is not reported in the IB (see IB Section 6.1.3, Reference Safety Information). 
For both serious and non-serious AEs, the Investigator must determine both the intensity of the 
event and the relationship of the event to study drug administration. Only those injection site 
reactions considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_155128].  
12.2.1. Assessment of Severity  
Intensity of all AEs including clinically significant treatment- emergent laboratory abnormalities, 
injection site reactions , and potential systemic reactions will be graded per the CTCAE 
Version  4.03. The CTCAE grade refers to the severity of the AE and ranges from Grade 1 (mild 
AE), Grade 2 (moderate AE), Grade 3 (severe AE) , and Grade 4 (life-threatening or disabling AE) 
to Grade 5 (death related to AE). 
AEs not listed by [CONTACT_12544]: 

Protocol Amendment 10   RM-493- 014 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 56 of 87 Confidential 
    • Mild : discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity.  
• Moderate:  discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect daily activity.  
• Severe:  inability to work or perform normal daily activity.  
• Life threatening : represents an immediate threat to life.  
Relationship  to study drug administration will be determined by [CONTACT_364298] : 
• None: No relationship between the event and the administration of study drug. The event 
is related to other etiologies, such as concomitant medications or patient’s clinical state.  
• Unlikely: The current state of knowledge indicates that a relationship to study drug is unlikely, the temporal relationship is such that study drug would not have had any reasonable association with the observed event , or another reasonable explanation for the 
event (e.g., a pre- existing clinical condition or other concomitant treatment) is more 
likely . 
• Possible: A reaction that follows a plausible temporal sequence from administration of 
the study drug and follows a known response pattern to the suspected study drug. The 
reaction might have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
• Probable: A reaction that follows a plausible temporal sequence from administration of 
the study drug and follows a known response pattern to the suspected study drug. The reaction cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11564]’s 
clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
For the purpose of safety analyses, all AEs that are classified as possible or probable will be 
considered treatment -related events.  
12.2.2. Adverse Events and Risks 
Overall, setmelanotide has been generally well -tolerated in previous studies. Drug- Related TEAEs 
(for which the AE was assessed as possibly or probably related to  study drug by [CONTACT_737] ) 
were reported. Because very few studies have been done using setmelanotide, there may be other 
unknown side effects. The P rimary Investigators (or a covering clinician) will be available at all 
times to study participants in the event of a clinical emergency; both this availability and how to 
reach the Investigators in an emergency will be clearly communicated orally and in writing to study 
participants. All study interventions will be provided free of cost.  
Please refer to the current IB  for a comprehensive summary of the AEs reported to date.  
12.2.3. Monitoring of Adverse Events and Period of Observation 
AEs will be recorded on the CRFs starting from Screening up to and including the Final Study Visit. 
SAEs and deaths will be recorded on the CRFs starting from the time the informed consent form is 
Protocol Amendment 10   RM-493- 014 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 57 of 87 Confidential 
    signed and continuing through the Final Study Visit. All AEs should be monitored until they are 
resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent 
illness(es).  
Any SAE that occurs at any time after completion of the study, and which the Investigator considers 
to be related to study drug, must be reported to Rhythm or its designee.  
12.2.4. Guidelines for Additional Monitoring and Suspension of Dosing for a Patient  
Patients will be monitored carefully during the treatment period during on- site clinic visits and 
periodic telephone calls made to the patients by [CONTACT_5984]. In the event a patient is withdrawn from treatment due to an AE, the patient should be encouraged to complete the final study/early 
termination visit in order to monitor the event to resolution and obtain additional protocol -defined 
safety assessments.  
Depression or Suicidality  
A patient should be referred to an MHP if he/she has:  
• A PHQ- 9 score ≥ 10.  
• Any suicidal behavior. 
• Any suicidal ideation of type 4 or 5 on the C- SSRS.  
A referral to a n MHP should also be made if , in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], it is necessary for 
the safety of the patient. If a patient’s psychiatric disorder can be adequately treated with psycho - 
and/or pharmacotherapy, then the patient, at the discretion of the MHP, should be continued in the 
trial. 
Any elevation in PHQ-9 or C-SSRS score should be evaluated to determine whether it meets the 
criteria for reporting as an AE .

    13. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL PROCEDURES  
This section describes the plans for analysis. Details of the statistical plan will be provided in a 
complete SAP . Any additional analyses and specific conventions for analysis will be described in 
the SAP and Clinical Study Report. 
13.1. Sample Size Estimation  
The objective of this study is to demonstrate statistically significant and clinically meaningful 
weight loss in patients with various rare genetic forms of obesity after ~[ADDRESS_682138] 5% body weight reduction from baseline, at ~[ADDRESS_682139] 5 patients with each rare genetic disorder of obesity will be recruited.  
Given the rarity of th is disorder, estimated power for expected weight change efficacy will not be 
provided, but efficacy will be only summarized.  
13.2. Hypotheses 
Setmelanotide leads to a clinically relevant reduction of percent body weight after ~3 months of treatment in each popu lation of patients with rare genetic disorders of obesity (each population 
analyzed separately). No formal statistical hypothesis will be tested, given the exploratory nature of 
the study.  
13.3. Definition of Population(s) for Analysis  
This protocol includes a variety of very rare genetic obesity populations who are included in this protocol as a matter of administrative convenience (as each population is so rare, and this protocol 
anticipates very small numbers of patients in each population ). Hence each population will be 
analyzed separately as ≥2 patients are enrolled and complete the ~3- month treatment period.  
13.4. Statistical Methods  
Statistical methods, populations , and approaches to missing data will be outlined in the SAP.  
The primary endpoint is defined as the proportion of patients in each subgroup of RGDO who 
achieve at least 5% body weight reduction from baseline, at ~[ADDRESS_682140] at an alpha=0.05. No adjustment for multiplicity is needed for the single primary endpoint; 
weight change after [ADDRESS_682141] 3 months will also be analyzed without adjustment for multiplicity. In addition, no adjustment for multiplicity will be 
included for the many rare genetic obesity populations in this study as these different populations 
are included in this study only for administrative convenience. All the p -values and/or confidence 
intervals should be considered exploratory. 
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_682142] current version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) and summarized by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, and treatment group for the 
number and percent of AEs reported, the number of patients reporting each AE, and the number of patients with any AE.  
A by -patient AE data listing including onset and resolution dates, verbatim term, preferred term, 
treatment, severity, relationship to treatment, action taken, and outcome will be p rovided.  
Safety data including laboratory evaluations and vital signs assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_525673]. In addition, change from baseline to any post-dose values will 
be summarized for vital signs and clinical la boratory results. Frequency of patients with abnormal 
safety laboratory results will be tabulated by [CONTACT_3148].  
Plasma concentrations of setmelanotide will be summarized. Plasma concentrations may be 
compared to pharmacodynamic endpoints. 
13.5. Timing of Analyses 
It is planned that an analysis may be completed once ~[ADDRESS_682143] completed ~[ADDRESS_682144] been cleaned and finalized, and the database is locked for assessments. Additional supplemental analyses will be 
conducted for patients who enter into long-term extensions.  
13.6. Statistical Analysis Plan

any BP readings are recorded. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures will be determined by 
[CONTACT_525682] (3) consecutive measurements obtained 2 minutes apart. None of the 3 consecutive 
readings can be >[ADDRESS_682156] 
only the 3 stable readings, in addition to the mean, the initial time of the measurement and the arm 
used for the measurement in the case report forms (as outlined below).  
The following instructions will be followed for both manual and automatic blood pressure 
measurements (with steps specific to manual identified by “[MANUAL]”).  
Please pay special attention to selecting the appropriate cuff size for this patient population, as noted below. 
The accuracy and reliabilit y of blood pressure readings will increase by [CONTACT_525683]:  
1. Situate the individual in a quiet environment with the arm resting at heart level.  
2. [MANUAL] For manual measurements, place the manometer at eye level, sufficiently close 
to read the calibration markings on the gauge or column. 
3. Select the appropriately sized cuff. The proper cuff size should be used on the non-
dominant arm throughout the study. Bladder width should be at least 40% of arm 
circumference; bladder should be at least 80% of arm circumference.  
4. [MANUAL] Locate the brachial artery along the inner upper arm by [CONTACT_23302]. 
5. Wrap the cuff smoothly and snugly around the arm, centering the bladder over the brachial artery. The lower margin should be 2.5 cm above the antecubital space. (Do not rely on cuff 
marking; find the center by [CONTACT_525684].) 
6. For manual measurements:  
a. Determine the level for maximal inflation by [CONTACT_525685][INVESTIGATOR_525635] (palpated systolic) and by [CONTACT_1583] [ADDRESS_682157] two consecutive beats (Phase 1 
Korotkoff sounds). Blood pressure levels should always be recorded in even numbers and read to the nearest [ADDRESS_682158] the diastolic pressure at the cessation of the Korotkoff sounds (Phase V). Listen for [ADDRESS_682159] to confirm disappearance, and then deflate the cuff rapi[INVESTIGATOR_367554].  
7. For automatic measurement:  
a. Take automatic measurements and record.  
8. Record the patient’s position and the arm used for the measurement.  
9. Wait 2 minutes before repeating the pressure measurement in the same arm to permit the  
release of blood trapped in the arm veins. 
10. Note that all three readings at each timepoint should be captured on the case report form, as 
well as the average.  
11. For each patient, the method used for BP determinations (manual or automatic) should be 
used throughout the study. In addition, the same size cuff should be used throughout. Care 
should be taken to make all measurements in the same position (sitting) for all 
measurements.  
Rounding Rules for Blood Pressure Measurements  
Blood pressure readings will be recorded to the nearest even mm Hg. Do not round off to the nearest 5 or 10 mm Hg BP reading. Therefore, a 142/94 reading should not be reported as 140/95, but should be reported as 142/94. 
When calculating the means (average) of the readings, the following rules should be used: 
If the value is XX.1 to XX.4, it should be rounded down (example: A diastolic mean of 97.2 would 
be recorded as 97, as would a mean of 97.4). 
If the value is XX.5 or greater it should be rounded up (example: A diastolic mean of 97.5 would be 
recorded as 98, as would a mean of 97.9). 
The mean of the readings may be an odd number. 
Special Pi[INVESTIGATOR_525636] 
[MANUAL] In some subjects, particularly in patients with hypertension, the sounds heard over the 
brachial  artery when the cuff pressure is high disappear as the pressure is reduced and then reappear 
at some lower level. This early, temporary disappearance of sound is called the auscultatory gap and 
occurs during the latter part of Phase I and Phase II. Becaus e this gap may extend over a range as 
great as [ADDRESS_682160] of Arm Position  
The pressure in the arm increases as the arm is lowered from the level of the (phlebostatic axis); 
conversely, raising the arm above this position lowers the pressure measurement. The effect is 
largely explained by [CONTACT_525686]. Therefore, when measuring indirect blood pressure, the patient’s arm should be positioned so that 
the location of the stethoscope head (preferably the bell or its equivalent) is at the level of the heart. 
This location of the heart is arbitrarily taken to be at the junction of the fourth intercostal space and the lower left sternal border. When the patient is seated, placing the arm on a nearby [CONTACT_525687] a 
little above waist level will result in a satisfactory position.   
Large Arm Size  
Falsely elevated indirect pressure measurements may be obtained in patients with increased arm girth if the standard -sized bladder and technique are used. This is caused by [CONTACT_525688], with subsequent excessive loss of cuff pressure through the thick, compressible soft 
tissues of the large arms. This problem may be minimized by [CONTACT_2329] a bladder width that is 40 to 
50% of measured arm circumference. In individuals with moderately large arm size, a large adult 
cuff (32 to 42 cm wide) will usually be adequate, but a larger cuff (38 -50 cm) should be available, if 
necessary.

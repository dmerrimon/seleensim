Protocol Version 5.0 – 16January 2015 Secondary Outcomes  • The distance walked on the 6MWT is the major functional outcome to be evaluated. 
Other tests include time to walk and run , strength test, functional test , and reaching 
ability .   
• MRI studies of leg muscles will be done pre and post treatment (6 , 12 and 24 
months) to study muscle size, fibrosis and fat content.   
• EIM measurement will quantify the pathological status of muscles.   
• Muscle biopsies on quadriceps muscles (a muscle biopsy on one leg at baseline 
screening visit and the post gene transfer biopsy on the opposite leg at day 180), will 
include general histological evaluation. Assessment will consist of morphometric 
analyses for  quantification of fiber size, fibrosis, inflammatory process, satellite 
cells and regeneration. Muscle tissue obtained at biopsy will also be assessed for 
viral DNA (qPCR), and follistatin transgene expression .  . 
Study Duration  We will evaluate short -term safety over a two year period.  Subjects will be tested at 
baseline and return for follow up visits on day s 7, 14, 30, 45, 60, 90, 180,  and 9,  12, [ADDRESS_1264079] -gene transfer .  
Sample Size  Six DMD patients will receive rAAV1.CMV.huFollistatin 344 to both limbs by [CONTACT_901195], quadriceps and tibialis anterior muscles.  
Statistical Analysis  This is a phase I/IIA trial, with safety as the primary measure. For each measure based on 
differences between pre-  and post -gene transfer examinations (clinical) evaluated by 
[CONTACT_54959] t test, with a p value of < 0.[ADDRESS_1264080], or if the subjects suffer any 
adverse events during this period, we will initiate a long -term follow -up according to the 
FDA guidelines .

AAV1.CMV.huFS344 at a total dose of 2.4 X 1012 vg/kg to  six DMD patient s.  This dose will be 
divided between gluteal muscles, quadriceps and tibialis anterior.  This is a wider distribution of 
vector than given to BMD patients, who overall improved the distance walked on the 6MWT 
without adverse events related to viral transduction into a single muscle.

Disease Pathogenesis  
More than 20 years ago the DMD gene was cloned defining the molecular basis of the disease.7  
The identification of the dystrophin as the deficient protein followed closely on the heels of this 
discovery.8  Dystrophin is a 427kDa cytoskeletal protein required for muscle fiber stability.  Loss 
of this protein results in susceptibility to repeated cycles of necrosis and regeneration with 
satellite cell depletion, diminished regenerative capacity of the muscle, ending in fat and 
connective tissue replacement (fibrosis). The mutation spectrum within the DMD gene reveals 
that deletions of one or more exons are found in ~65% of cases clustered in two hotspot regions.[ADDRESS_1264085] 95% -98% of all 
deletions10, 11.  Detection of duplications, representing about 6% of the DMD mutations, initially 
required Southern blots to detect.  Overtime the demand for more rapid, less expensive detection 
methods have encouraged the introduction of additional tools to identify the full spectrum of 
mutations (deletions, duplications, splice -site and point mutations).  Multiplex lig ation -
dependent probe amplification (MLPA)12 or multiplex amplifiable probe hybridization 
(MAPH)[ADDRESS_1264086] deletions and duplications.  If 
MLPA or MAPH are negative, the gene should be scanned for subexonic  rearrangements or 
point mutations using DNA sequence analysis.14  This has become more than an academic

Treatment for DMD  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_901162], only one treatme nt has consistently 
demonstrated efficacy.  Unequivocal evidence for glucocorticoid -induced improvement was 
established through a double -blind, randomized controlled trial in a large cohort of subjects 
(n=103).15 Patients received 0.75 mg /kg/day  or 1.5 mg/kg/day versus placebo.  At six months 
there was approximately equal efficacy for the high and low dose prednisone groups compared to 
placebo in muscle strength (manual muscle testing score), the time needed to rise from supi[INVESTIGATOR_99682] 
a standing (prednisone 3.4 vs. placebo 6.2 seconds), to walk 9 m (prednison e 7.0 vs. placebo 9.7 
seconds), to climb four stairs (prednisone 4.0 vs. placebo 7.1 seconds), and in forced vital 
capacity (prednisone 1.7 vs. placebo 1.5 liters) (P<0.001 for all comparisons).  Similar results 
were later reported with deflazacort (0.9 mg/kg/day), an alternative, sodium -sparing 
corticosteroid that was also shown to prolong ambulation (untreated DMD patients stopped 
walking at 9.8 +  1.8 years compared to deflazacort -treated at 12.3 +  2.7 years, P<.005).[ADDRESS_1264087] was observed in two follow up studies that de monstrated lesser but similar 
benefits using prednisone 0.30 and 0.35 mg/kg/day17, 18  A weekend dosing regimen (10 
mg/kg/wk: half on Saturday and half on Sunday) showed equal efficacy to daily steroids.19  
Additional follow up studies r eported that the number of boys having scoliosis surgery in treated 
groups was significantly less than untreated boys (P < 0.05);20, 21 and treatment extended 
independent ambulation by 3.3 years compared to unt reated (9.2 +1.48 years vs. 12.5+  3.02 ( p < 
0.0001).[ADDRESS_1264088] in clinical trials but is still early in demonstration of efficacy. 
Limitations inclu de development of products related to specific exons.  The target of exon

dystrophin reading frame.  This is accomplished with splice -switching oligomers, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 2 0-30

Pre-clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in the mdx mouse, dystrophin/utrophin knock- out

(2OMe) and phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs).  Two proof -of-principle 
clinical trials in DMD used a 2OMe oligomer (PRO051, ProsensaTherapeutics) or a PMO 
(Sarepta Therapeutics) deli vered directly to muscle targeting exon 51.25, 26  Evidence favoring 
exon skippi[INVESTIGATOR_901164] b y RT -PCR and a newly synthesized dystrophin protein correctly 
localized to the sarcolemma.  Phase I/II extension studies were performed with both oligomers 
following systemic delivery.  In the PRO051 tria l, four doses were tested in the initial 5 week 
phase (0.5, 2.0, 4.0, and 6.0 mg/kg) prior to an open- label 12 -week extension phase.27  Dose -
related efficacy was achieved with evidence of new dystrophin expression in approximately 60 -
100% of muscle fibers in [ADDRESS_1264089].  
In the AVI phase  II open -label study with AVI -4658 (Eteplirsen®) conducted in the [LOCATION_006], [ADDRESS_1264090] response with a mean increase of sarcolemmal dystrophin from 8.9% to 
16.4%.28  The results were variable with one patient responding following treatment with 2 
mg/kg, while all other responders received the higher dosing levels of 10 and 20 mg/kg .  The 
PMO has now been tested in a phase I/II randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, multiple 
dose efficacy trial at Nationwide Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Columbus, OH, [LOCATION_003] to assess 30 and 50 
mg/kg dosing over 24 weeks ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov ).  At t he 24- week time point, 
dystrophin was increased and there was stability in the distance walked on the 6MWT.  This was 
followed by [CONTACT_901197] 1 year time point showing 
increase dystrophin and stability in the  6MWT (Mendell et al Ann Neurol 2013;74:637- 47).  
A second molecular approach involves suppression of stop codon mutations of the DMD gene 
that comprise approximately 15% of DMD cases.  Two pharmacologic tactics have shown pre -
clinical efficacy.  In mdx mice, mutation suppression was shown with the aminoglycoside 
antibiotic, gentamicin.29  In a follow up clinical study, treatment of four DMD/BMD subjects 
failed to show a benefit.[ADDRESS_1264091]. Mendell at Nationwide 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], DMD patients (n = 16) with stop codons, treated weekly or twice weekly for 
six months (7.5 mg kg IV), showed a signific ant increase in dystrophin levels with the highest 
levels reaching 13 and 15% of normal.[ADDRESS_1264092] increase 
in forced vital capacity was achieved.  Although this study demonstrates the therapeutic potential 
of gentamicin, higher doses might be necessary to impr ove functional outcomes.  The known 
renal toxicity of aminoglycoside antibiotics and the inconvenience of intravenous administration 
pushed the field in the direction of identi fying an orally administered agent.  
Ataluren, formerly referred to as PTC124 (P TC therapeutics), fulfilled the requirement of an 
orally administered pharmacologic readthrough agent for stop codon mutations.[ADDRESS_1264093] ablished safety and tolerability at doses exceeding what was required for 
pre-clinical efficacy.34  In a phase IIa  proof -of-concept 28 -day study in DMD/BMD patients, 
dystrophin appeared to increase post treatment.  A randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled 
phase IIb trial followed, evaluating safety and efficacy over a 48 week treatment period.  PTC, 
Inc. released preliminary results indicating a very strong safety profile; however, the primary 
endpoint of the [ADDRESS_1264094] did not reach statistical significance

10 
Protocol Version 5.0 – 16January 2015 [http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show /[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ].  Continued subgroup analysis to look at 
efficacy is underway.  Influence for further pursuit of treatment in DMD may come from on-
going clinical trials in cystic fibrosis35 and 
hemophilia[[ http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ], presuming results are 
favorable.  Upregulation of utrophin is another therapeutic strategy for DMD that has shown 
promise in the mdx mouse.  Utrophin shares 80% sequence homology with dystrophin and h as 
been shown to partially restore function as a dystrophin surrogate in pre -clinical transgenic mice 
36 and gene replacement studies.37  In normal muscle utrophin expression is limited to the 
neuromuscular and myotendinous junctions but in mdx mice and DMD patient s it is 
overexpressed throughout t he sarcolemma of all muscle fibers, putatively compensating for the 
absence of dystrophin.  Upregulation of utrophin holds a particular advantage because of the 
unlikely occurrence of an immune response as seen following mini -dystrophin gene 
replacement.1  
Several small molecules demonstrate upregulation of the utrophin gene through the utrophin- A 
promoter.  SMT C1100 is a novel small molecule that was identified t hrough an exhaustive high-
throughput small molecule screen.  When used in the mdx mouse, utrophin staining is increased 
at the sarcolemma and dystrophic muscle pathology is reversed.38  Summit PLC, a [LOCATION_006] 
biotechnology company, has advocated for its use in DMD clinical trials. A similar small 
molecule transcriptionally upregulating utr ophin, BMN195 (Biomarin Pharmaceuticals), was 
tried in a phase I safety trial in healthy volunteers but disappointingly failed to achieve adequate 
concentrations in the blood.  The non- steroidal anti- inflammatory drug nabumetone39 (also 
known as Relafen®) was shown to upregulate endogenous utrophin mRNA and protein in 
C2C12 cells.[ADDRESS_1264095] profile as an NSAID with warnings 
regarding life -threatening heart or circulation problems, including he art attack or str oke may be a 
limiting factor as a life- long therapy.  
Heregulin represents an additional molecule capable of transactivating the utrophin- A promoter.  
When delivered to the mdx mouse for 3 months by [CONTACT_901198] a small pe ptide 
encoding the epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169] -like region of heregulin ectodomain, utrophin was 
upregulated, accompanied by [CONTACT_901199], and a reduction of 
muscle pathology.40  The amelioration of dystrophic phenotype by [CONTACT_901200]-mediated utrophin 
up-regulation offers a pharmacological therapeutic modality that deserves consideration in future 
planning to alleviate DMD.  
Another approach to upregulate utrophin employs a recombinant biglycan (rhBGN) that can be 
delivered system ically in the mdx mouse and ameliorate pathology and improve function at the 
diaphragm.41  There is clear evidence that biglycan can recruit utrophin to the sarcolemma.  
rhBGN has shown  promise when use d in cell culture and in vivo without changing mRNA levels 
of utrophin indicating that functional benefits arise from posttranscriptional effects.  rhBGN is 
being evaluated for clinical trials in DMD.

Rationale for Follistatin (FS344) Gene Therapy  
The planned approach for gene therapy for DMD is an extension of our current follistatin (FS) 
gene therapy trial in BMD where we have found that gene transfer to the quadriceps muscles 
bilaterally improved the distance walked on the [ADDRESS_1264096] been published in Molecular 
Therapy:  Mendell, JR, et al. A Phase I/IIa Follistatin Gene Therapy Trial for Becker Muscular 
Dystrophy , available on -line October 2014.  
Myostatin is a transforming growth factor -beta family member that normally acts to limit 
skeletal muscle growth.  Mice genetically engineered to lack myostatin have about twice the 
amount of muscle mass, and similar effect s are seen in cattle, sheep, dogs, and human.  42-[ADDRESS_1264097] on these same parameters in the upper 
limbs and increased muscle mass in the paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_28947] l muscles . 48  This we attributed to the muscle 
acting as a secretory site for follistatin with the circulating isoform reaching remote sites 49  
AAV1.CMV.FS344 was further tested in the non -human primate to explore a paradigm  
applicable to clinical trial.  In the cynomolgus macaque we injected AAV1.FS344 directly into 
the quadriceps muscle resulting in an increase in size and strength of this  muscle.  50  It should be 
noted that when we injected the non- human prima te in one muscle (as opposed to multiple 
muscles in the mouse) we did not see remote effect s.  These pre -clinical studies in the absence of 
toxicity enabled a Phase I/IIa  clinical trial in patients with BMD (IND [ZIP_CODE]).  The BMD 
clinical results are the first ever gene therapy to muscle showing a functional benefit (increase 
distance walked on t he 6MWT).  We are now ready to move ahead to treat boys with DMD.

II. Vector Administration P rotocol  
Conscious sedation will be given to all DMD participants  by [CONTACT_901202] .  In addition, the skin over the gene transfer site will be pre -
treated with a lidocaine/prilocaine eutectic mixture incorporated in a cream base (EMLA cream) 
or a cellulose disk (EMLA patch).  Comparable  cream -based anesthesia such as xylocaine cream 
might be used.  Procedures will be performed under sterile conditions.  The injection site will be 
cleansed with three successive applications of non -iodine containing surgical prep swabs and 
draped with disposable sterile drapes.  A standard clinic al Doppler ultrasound will be used with a 
sterile sheath around the transducer to maintain asepsis of the injection field.  This will increase 
the precision of gene transfer to be sure that we inject muscle and not connective tissue or fat.   
The total dos e of vector per extremity, 1.2 X 1012 vg/kg will be distributed between the targeted 
muscles that include gluteals, quadriceps, and tibialis anterior.  The initial sites of injection, at 
least three injections per muscle, will be targeted based on MRI show ing preserved muscle.  The 
sites will be confirmed at the time of injection by [CONTACT_901203].  
The procedure should take approximately [ADDRESS_1264100] -administration.  Concomitant medications and all adverse events/serious adverse 
events will also be monitored  and documented following injection.  Patients will be discharged 
the day after gene therapy (if no side effects are observed).

We will follow the most recent FDA guidelines  with regard to long -term patient follow up 
following  gene transfer.  Our proposed vector has a very low probability of gene transfer -related 
delayed adverse events.  We will, however, evaluate short -term safety over a two -year period 
that incorporates the active phase of the protocol (see assessment of endp oints below). If newly

I. Primary Outcome  
Safety is a primary outcome for thi s clinical gene transfer trial.  
II. Secondary Outcomes:  
• The distance walked on the 6MWT is the primary functional outcome to be evaluated. 
Time to walk and run, strength test, functional test, and reaching ability  will be included 
in PT testing .  Functional testing will be performed at baseline and at days 30, 60, 
90,180, and 9, 12, [ADDRESS_1264105] -gene transfer.  
• Life quality questionnaire will be completed at baseline and 6, 12, [ADDRESS_1264106]-gene tr ansfer.  
• In order to maximize potential benefit of follistatin gene therapy, subject will be 
instructed to continue strengthening exercise at home at least 3 times per week as 
instructed by [CONTACT_149440][INVESTIGATOR_11437] (PT) , and asked to report the frequency of exercise.  
The subjects who follow the exercise instruction will be incentivized  by [CONTACT_901204] $10 per week if they fill out their log showing bike riding complete .   
• MRI studies of leg muscles will be done pre and post gene transfer (6, 12 and 24 
months) to study muscle size, fibrosis and fat content.   
• EIM measurement will quantify the pathological status of muscles.  
• Muscle biopsies on quadriceps muscles (a muscle bi opsy on one leg at baseline 
screening visit and the post gene transfer biopsy on the opposite leg at day 180), will 
include general histological evaluation. Assessment will consist of morphometric 
analyses for  quantification of fiber size, fibrosis, infla mmatory process, satellite cells 
and regeneration. Muscle tissue obtained at biopsy will also be assessed for viral DNA 
(qPCR),  and follistatin transgene expression  
6.6 STATISTICAL ANALYSI S 
This is a phase I/IIA trial, with safety as the primary measure. For each measure based on 
differences between pre-  and post -gene transfer examinations (clinical) analyses will be based on 
a paired t test, with a p value of < 0.05 indicating significance.

7.1.[ADDRESS_1264111] Name:  [CONTACT_486696]1.CMV.huFS344  
Gene Insert:  Human cDNA for FS344 (alternatively spliced follistatin)  
Control Elements:  CMV promoter  
AAV Serotype:  Serotype AAV1  
 
7.2 DOSE SELECTION  
The dose is based on our BMD gene therapy trial using the same vector.  In that study we used 
two doses without safety concerns.  No dose limiting toxicity was found.  For the low dose 
rAAV1.CMV.huFS344 trial (n=3) we injected 12 sites in each ex tremity (quadriceps only).  The 
total dose per patient was 6 X 1011 vg/kg (3e11 vg/kg/quadriceps) and the high dose was 1.2 X 
1012 vg/kg per patient (6e11vg/kg/quadriceps).  There did not seem to be a significant dose 
response effect. In the low dose cohort patients improved in the distance walked in the 6MWT as 
follows: 58m, 125m, and 9 m.  In the high dose cohort, patients improved in the 6MWT by 108m 
and 29m.  One patient in the high dose group did not improve.  Based on our toxicology studies 
prepared for IND [ZIP_CODE] that included a high dose cohort in C57Bl mice at 2.0 x 1013 vg/kg 
without any organ system toxicity and the clinical  trial done at 1.2 X 1012 vg/kg, we are 
proposing that all six DMD boys receive 2.4 X 1012 vg/kg per patient.

7.3 DOSE LIMITING TOXICI TY  
In reporting adverse events we will follow the final regulations issued by [CONTACT_901205] (INDs) found in 21 CFR part 312 and for bioavailability and bioequivalence studies 
found in 21 CFR part 320. “Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies”. 
The classification for adverse events to be used is the following:  
1  Mild adverse event; did not require treatment  
2  Moderate adverse event; resolved with treatment  
3  Severe adverse event; inability to carry on normal activities; required professional 
 medical attention  
4  Life-threatening or permanently disabling adverse event  
5  Fatal adverse event In this grading system, “severe” is not equivalent to seriousness.  
 
The definitions to be employed will follow the final regulations issued by [CONTACT_109344] 
2010 “Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies. 
 
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT)  is defined as any adverse event that is possibly, probably, or 
definitely related to the study agent.  This would include any grade [ADDRESS_1264112] 
redrawn in a laboratory close to home or by [CONTACT_110319].  To avoid any 
confusion for the primary care physician, they will be infor med (with permission from the 
subject) of their participation in the study at the time of gene transfer.  If the AE requires 
treatment, this will be carried out by [CONTACT_3198] a doctor of choice selected by 
[CONTACT_423].  We will obtain co pi[INVESTIGATOR_901167]’s research chart.  
Only those adverse events requiring treatment will qualify as DLT.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_901168] 21 CFR 312.32(c), to notify FDA in an IND safety report of

8.0 ADVERSE EVENT MO NITORING AND REPORTI NG 
8.1 DEFINITION OF AN  ADVERSE EVENT  
As stated above  this protocol will follow the final regulations issued by [CONTACT_901208] (INDs) found in 21 CFR part 312 and for bioavailability and bioequivalence studies 
found in 21 CFR part 320. “ Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies”.  
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/U
CM227351.pdf  
Adverse Events will be collected throughout the study from enrollment to last follow up visit.  
Adverse Event (AE):  Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with 
the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
Adverse events will be graded by [CONTACT_896004]:  
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated. 
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
instrumental ADL*.

Grade 4 Life- threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5 Death related to AE.  
A Semi -colon indicates ‘or’ within the descript ion of the grade.  
A single dash ( -) indicates a grade is not available.  
 
Activities of Daily Living (ADL)  
*Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the  
telephone, managing money, etc.  
**Self care ADL refer to bath ing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden. 
Association or relatedness to the study agent, study procedures and the subject's pre -existing 
disease will be graded as follows: 5 = unrelated, 4 = unlike ly, 3 = possibly, 2 = probably, and 1 = 
definitely related.  
Adverse reaction: An adverse reaction means any adverse event caused by a drug. Adverse 
reactions are a subset of all suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that 
the dr ug caused the event.  
Suspected adverse reaction (21 CFR 312.32(a)) Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse 
event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the 
purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies 
a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event 
caused by a drug. 
Serious adverse event (SAE)  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either 
the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life -threatening 
adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56385], a persistent or 
significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, o r require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such m edical 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at

Protocol Version 5.0 – 16January 2015 home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
To reiterate, an SAE is an event in categories graded 3, 4, and 5.   
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]; disabling; limiting self care ADL**.  
Grade 4 Life- threatening  consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5 Death related to AE.  
Life-threatening (21 CFR 312.32(a)) An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered “life- threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurr ence 
places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected 
adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.

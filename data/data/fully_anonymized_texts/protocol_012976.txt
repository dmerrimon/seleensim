I.  Background:  
The coronary microcirculation (CMC) play s an essential and complex role in regulating coronary blood 
flow and myocardial perfusion.  Recent clinical classification of CMC dysfunction by [CONTACT_267717] 
a heterogeneous group of patients including those with  CMC dysfunction without evidence of 
obstructive epi[INVESTIGATOR_171435] (CAD)  or myocardial disease (Type I) ; CMC dysfunction in 
the presence of myocardial diseases such as primary and secondary cardiomyopathies (Type II); CMC 
dysfunction in the presence of obstructive CAD (Typ e III) and iatrogenic CMC dysfunction (Type IV)  1.  
Unlike epi[INVESTIGATOR_267711], where the  link between ischemia  and angiogr aphic  coronary anatomy lends a 
target for therapy, the study and treatment of the disorders of the CMC are still in evolution.  However, 
over the last two decades our understanding of CMC has broadened and our ability to study CMC 
function has evolved.  
Importance of the Coronary Microcirculation:    CMC function is adversely effected by [CONTACT_267718] 2-4 and both endothelial dependant and independent CMC dysfunction can increase 
long -term risk of adverse cardiovascular events among patients wi th all types of CMC dysfunction5, 6. 
Assessment of Coronary Microcirculation:   In the absence of direct visualization, there are several 
approaches to indirectly measuring CMC function.   Non-invasive tools have included perfusion  cardiac 
MRI, positron emission topography  and myocardial contrast echocardiography based measurement of 
microcirculatory blood  flow 7-10.  However, requirements for dedicated software programs, lack of 
uniform definition of findings and inferior reproducibility strongly limit non -invasive assessment of the 
CMC.  Currently, the gold stan dard for measuring CMC function involves invasive measurement using 
Doppler or thermodilution methods to quantify coronary blood flow and vas oreactivity in response to 
vasoactive stimuli  11, 12.  Historically, the more accurate invasive method of measurement has been 
limited by [CONTACT_267719] -procedural mixing of restricted medications such 
as acetylcholine ; the need to withh old chronic  medications  and the lack of reproducibility of the 
measurements  obtained.  
A simpler and more reproducible method of measuring  global coronary micro circulatory  resistance  has 
recently been  validated13-16.  The index of microcirculato ry resistance (IMR) is based on the premise that 
at peak hyperemia, variability of resting vascular tone and hemodynamics is reduced to give an accurate 
assessment of minimum microvascular resistance.  It is defined as distal coronary pressure divided by 
[CONTACT_267720] (a correlate to absolute flow), measured simultaneously 
using a  temperature sensor/ pressure tipped guidewire .  Compared  to  traditional Doppler based 
coronary flow measurements ,  IMR is easier to use, allows q uantification of blood flow and pressure 
measurements while reducing the impact of basal flow conditions  to provide superior reproducib ility 
and less hemodynamic variability compared to doppler based measurements  15.   An IMR measurement  
of <20u is associa ted with  normal CMC function.  
 
Treatment of Coronary Micro circulatory Dysfunction :  Treatment of patients with CMC dysfunction  has 
focused on reducing atherosclerotic burden and symptom relief.  There is a paucity of data evaluating 
the impact of drug ther apy on CMC function.  Ranolazine  is a late sodium current inhibitor thought to 
v5/27/[ADDRESS_325952] of Ranolazine on the microcirculation remains unknown.  
Clinically, a mong patient s with Type I CMC dysfunction (CMC dysfunction in the absence of obstructive 
CAD  or myocardial disease) , Ranola zine has  been shown to improve symptoms of angina and cardiac 
MRI based perfusion  compared to treat ment with placebo  25.  Whether this  symptomatic improvement 
is due to actual improvement in CMC function remains unknown .    
 
II:  Specific Aims  
1:  Does Ranolazine treatment improve  CMC function among patients with Type I C MC dysfunction ?   
2:  Is symptomatic improvement in chest pain with Ranolazine related to improved CMC function?

Study Flow : 
Patients meeting entry criteria will  undergo d etailed history regarding demographics, cardiovascular risk 
profile, clinical pres entation, laborato ry analysis and current medical therapy.  After  enrollment in the 
study, participants will initiate Ranolazine  for 4 weeks.  The participant’s usual anti -anginal medication 
v5/27/2014  3 regimen will be continued unchanged throughout study duration.  P atients will  receive  Ranolazine  500 
mg orally twice daily for 1 week, and the dose will be increased to 1,000 mg twice daily for an additional 
3 weeks if tolerated.   
-All participants wil l complete baseline Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) and Duke Acti vity Status 
Index (DASI).  
-1 week :  Patients will undergo phone f/u and if tolerated, drug dose will be increased to 1000 mg twice 
daily.    
- 4 weeks :  Patients will be scheduled to return for a follow -up cardiac catheterization and IMR  at no 
charge .  Pat ients will be asked to complete SAQ and DASI questionnaires.  
 
Procedures:  
 
Coronary Angiogram  and left heart catheterization :  Patients will undergo an initial clinically indicated 
coronary angiogram and left heart catheterization with IMR testing and the n undergo post Ranolazine 
follow -up coronary angiogram and left heart catheterization using standard technique  by [CONTACT_267721] (B.A, M.S or M.R). The study sponsor will pay for the follow –up 
cardiac catheterization  and IMR.  
Assessment of Coronary Microvascular Function:   Coronary physiologic indexes will be measured in a 
stenosis free area of the left anterior descending coronary artery when possible, or in the left circumflex 
artery as a secondary choice.  Appropri ate coronary guide catheter will be used to engage left main 
coronary artery.  After adequate heparinization, a temperature sensor/ pressure tipped guidewire (Radi 
pressure wire, St Jude Medical Systems) will be  advanced through the guide catheter and plac ed and 
secured at least 3 cm distal to guide catheter in the coronary artery  and secured .   After injecting 3 cc of 
room temperature normal saline, proximal and distal temperature sensors on guidewire will calculate 
mean transit time using thermodilution.  This is repeated three times to obtain an average baseline 
transit time.  Next, intravenous adenosine ( 140 μg per kilogram of body weight per minute through a 
central vein) is used to induce hyperemia.  We then inject 3 cc of room temp normal saline and c alculate 
hyperemic transit time .  This is performed at 120, 150 and 180 seconds after initiation of intr avenous 
adenosine  and averaged to obtain a  mean  hyperemic transit time.  In addition, simultaneous hyperemic 
pressure gradient is measured  in the proximal and distal vessel.   Once data is obtained, the following 
calculations are made:  
1:  Index of Microva scular Resistance (IMR):   IMR is defined as hyperemic distal coronary pressure 
divided by [CONTACT_267722].  IMR is based on the assumption that at peak 
hyperemia the variability of resting vascular tone and hemodynamics will be e liminated, and the 
minimum microvascular resistance will be achieved.  Studies have  correlated IMR value <20 to normal 
microvascular resistance 13, 16, 26.   
 
IV:  Data and Analysis  
Sample Size :  The sample size  of [ADDRESS_325956] of Ranolazine on IMR .  It is our intention to use this 
data to determine feasibility and power of an appropriately sized multicenter randomized clinical trial.  
Feasibil ity:   The historic incidence of CMC  dysfunction can vary depending on the patient population 
being studied.  The estimated historical incidence of Type I CMC dysfunction  is approximated to be 20-
30%  27.  At the University of New Mexico, we  anticipate performing approximately  400 cardiac 
catheterizations for the indication of objective ischemia  (as outlined in entry criteria) .  Of these, we  
estimate that 50% have non -obstructiv e CAD.  Current data from the IMR patient registry at UNM shows 
v5/27/2014  4 that approximately 50% of patients with ischemia and non -obstructive CAD have IMR >20  U (mean 26.7 
± 13.1). We conservatively approximate 40 patients per year who meet entry criteria  for the s tudy at 
University of New Mexico .  
Data Safety:  Data will be monitored by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Abinash Achrekar.  
Primary Endpoint:    
1:  Relative change in IMR before and after Ranolazine therapy.   Mean change between the groups will 
be analyzed using a paired t test.  
Secondary endpoint s: 
1:  Absolute  change in SAQ and DASI scores before and after Ranolazine therapy .  Mean change between 
the groups will be analyzed using a paired t test.  
2:  Compare relative change in IMR among patients with and without symptomatic improvem ent in 
angina burden  based on SAQ and DASI scores.  
V:  Scientific Focus  
CMC dysfunction continues to be a disease entity with limited therapeutic targets .  More recently, 
therapeutic trial s, including those using Ranolazine , have shown improve ment in angin a burden and 
myocardial perfusion among patients with CMC dysfunction  25, [ADDRESS_325957] of Ranola zine among patients with CMC dysfunction  
and to correlate invasively measured microvascular resistance with subjective burden of angina.  If 
shown  to improve CMC function, Ranolazine  would represent a  therapeutic strategy  among patients 
with CMC dysfunctio n and support a larger scale multi -center trial.     
VI:  Potential Challenges  
1:  Study Feasibility:  There may be two potential limitations to recruitment.  One may be due to 
insufficient patients meeting entry criteria.  The true prevalence of Type I CMC dysfunction  is 
speculative.  Review of the literature shows a varied rate between 10 -30%  of patient with chest pain and 
no epi[INVESTIGATOR_267711] .  Buchthal et al. studied [ADDRESS_325958] pain and no flow limiting CAD 
and found that 20% had abnormal  metabolic response to exercise most likely due to CMC dysfunction  27.  
We used a similar estimate to calculate annual number of patients  who would meet entry criteria for 
our study.  It is conceivable that the true prevalence of Type I CMC dysfunction is lower making 
feasibility more difficult.  I 
2:  Evidence of true hyperemia:  Use of intravenous Adenosine is well validated for the induc tion of 
coronary hyperemia.  Literature review suggests that mean time to maximal hyperemia using 
intravenous adenosine is 84±46 seconds (range, 23 -125 seconds) and time from discontinuation of 
infusion to return of coronary flow to basal levels is 145±67 seconds  29.  To ensure standardized  IMR 
measurement under maximal hyperemia, all cases will undergo three measurements at 120 seconds, Formatted:  Font: Italic,  Underline
v5/27/2014  5 150 seconds and 180 seconds after initiation  of intravenous adenosine ( 140 μg per kilogram of body 
weight per minute through a central vein ). 
 
VII:  Relevant Contributions  
 
At the University of New Mexico,  we have implemented IMR into clinical practice  among patients 
meeting criteria for evaluation of CMC function.  Our proto col adheres to meticulous technique and a 
standardized protocol .  In addition to the proposed study, we are currently evaluating the role of CMC 
dysfunction among patients with ACS and no angiographic culprit .  As a clinical fellow, I worked with [CONTACT_267724] and the WISE study group to develop a protocol for doppler  based c oronary 
microvascular testing among women with chest pain and normal coronary arteries at Cedars Sinai 
Medical Center .  In addition, at the University of Vermont, I was an invest igator in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_267714] -pass CT  imaging with microsphere -
derived absolute val ues in an animal model of regional coronary ischemia and  hyperemia.

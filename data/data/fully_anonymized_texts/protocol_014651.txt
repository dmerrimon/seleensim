Page 2 of 26  Minimal Risk Protocol 1. Protocol Title INTEGRATE-D: A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]-test of Implementation Strategies to Support Integration of Medical and Psychosocial Care for People with Type II Diabetes 2. Objectives The proposed study consists of two aims: 1) To refine INTEGRATE-D, an intervention that offers primary care practices implementation support to align type II diabetes mellitus care with America Diabetes Association recommendations for integrating medical and psychosocial care. 2) The study will pi[INVESTIGATOR_311431]-D, recruiting and randomly selecting four primary care practices to an experimental condition (i.e., treatment and control group). The study team will use mixed methods to assess the acceptability, feasibility, and cost of implementing INTEGRATE-D and to understand the preliminary impact on DMII and behavioral health process and outcome measures. The study hypothesis are: 1. Practices receiving INTEGRATE-D will find it acceptable and feasible and worth the effort and cost. 2. Practices receiving INTEGRATE-D will meet a higher number of process-of-care metrics for DMII and depression (pre-post) as compared to control practices (primary hypothesis). 3. Intervention practices will report using more quality-improving strategies post-intervention than at baseline, compared to control practices. 4. Practices receiving INTEGRATE-D will demonstrate a positive trend (improvement in PHQ-9 and HbA1c scores (pre-post) as compared to control practices (secondary hypothesis). The anticipated methodological approaches include, chart audits, observations, surveys, and semi- structured interviews. Practice member staff and patients will be recruited from the participating sites. 3. Background The American Diabetes Association1 (ADA) recommends integrating medical and psychosocial care (integration) to improve health outcomes for patients with comorbid diabetes mellitus (DM) and common mental and behavioral health (BH) problems. This is because when patients’ depression, anxiety and diabetes distress are addressed, patients are better able to engage in self-management activities (e.g., medication adherence, physical activity, diet) and manage their DM.2-19,78 In the US, 30 million people live with type II diabetes (DMII),[ADDRESS_383432] added staff, such as behavioral health clinicians (BHCs) and / or developed relationships with externally located BHCs, that can support integrated care for individuals with DMII.28,88-[ADDRESS_383433] made or sustained changes to routinize integration of medical and psychosocial care for patients with DMII.98-101 Implementing integrated care for patients with DMII involves complex practice change.25-29,38-40 This includes adopting systematic case finding and diagnosis, patient engagement/education, treatment approaches based on emerging evidence, engaging clinicians with different backgrounds (e.g., psychologists) and sometimes in different locations in treatment and following-up (including adjusting care plans) to ensure that improvement occurs and is sustained.23,25 To accomplish this, changes are needed to practice operational processes and workflows, documentation and information sharing, and communication.28,29,39,40 Multi-faceted implementation support approaches that engage leadership and multidisciplinary teams are needed to implement ADA recommendations.98-100,102 Effective combinations of ‘implementation strategies’ enable clinical teams to put evidence-based care in place, and involve quality reporting/feedback46-48 in combination with technical assistance,57-62 health information technology (HIT) support.28,63-[ADDRESS_383434] of doing so using mixed methods. Four practices will be recruited and randomized to either an intervention (N=2) or control arm (N=2). The study team will collect mixed methods data prior to implementation of the intervention (baseline) to assess practice capacity as well as detailed information about integrated behavioral health and DMII care processes. During implementation, a qualitative researcher will conduct monthly telephone calls with a key informant at the intervention practices. Post- intervention, the study team will collect follow-up surveys and conduct observation and interviews with intervention practices to assess what was or was not implemented and why, as well as acceptability, feasibility and perceived cost / benefits. The study team will conduct chart audits with intervention and control practices to measure key behavioral health and DMII process and outcome measures, as is commonly performed when assessing an array of behavior health integration process measures.189,240 Although this design is not optimal to conclusively demonstrate effectiveness, it is appropriate to gather preliminary evidence as to the promise of INTEGRATE-D in achieving desired outcomes. 5. Study Population i. Number of Subjects i. Primary Care Practice Sites. The study team will recruit four practices, two rural and two non-rural practices that vary on whether they employ a behavioral health consultant. Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network (ORPRN) practice sites that meet the eligibility criteria will participate in data collection activities that will involve surveys, observation, interviews (staff and patients), and chart audits. 
Page 4 of 26  ii. Practice Members. Staff at all four participating practices will be invited to complete the Practice Member Questionnaire, which asks about staff demographics (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, role, years in practice) and elements of the practice’s culture that align with adaptive capacity (e.g., leadership, team-work, communication). We will use a random selection process, where practice members are stratified and randomly selected by [CONTACT_10757], to select a few (1-3) practice members from each role in the practice (e.g., clinician, office manager, medical assistant) to participate in the survey. We anticipate that 10–[ADDRESS_383435] once after the intervention start date will be eligible for chart audits. Because it is costly and time prohibitive to audit medical records for “all” eligible patients, the study team will randomly select 80 patients per practice from those eligible; random sampling will ensure that the results from our analyses will generalize to the sample of patients who are eligible to receive the intervention. For patient interviews, with assistance from practices, the study team will approach the [ADDRESS_383436] any information about subjects’ status as prisoners, pregnant women, or adults lacking capacity. iv. Setting ORPRN is a statewide practice-based research network of primary care providers, community partners, and academicians dedicated to studying health care delivery and how to improve the health of Oregonians and to reduce health disparities. ORPRN works with 279 primary care practices, including 51% that are rural and 42% provider-owned. Practices have participated in studies related to care delivery redesign, heart health, cancer prevention, and social 
Page 5 of 26  determinants of health. ORPRN is organized into regions, each served by a facilitator that supports improvement initiatives and collects research data. v. Recruitment Methods ORPRN’s experienced recruiters will personally contact [CONTACT_311450] a faxback process to assess interest, capacity and eligibility. ORPRN will distribute a recruitment flyer to its network of primary care practices, detailing the purpose of the study, eligibility requirements, as well as responsibilities of participating practices. Interested sites will submit a non-binding agreement to ORPRN to participate in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], either by [CONTACT_40743]. ORPRN and the study team will select four practices. INTEGRATE-D aligns with programs relevant for practices in the Northwestern region (e.g., CPC+; Accountable Care Organization changes) and recruiting should not pose a challenge. Practices that agree to participate must sign a Memorandum of Understanding outlining expectations and responsibilities for participation. To encourage practice member participation, full explanation of the study and the purpose of the data collection activities will be given to practice members by [CONTACT_3476]. For patient participation in interviews, the study team will work with a practice liaison, who will make the first contact [CONTACT_311451] a study member. The research team will contact [CONTACT_47252], review the consent information sheet, and provide details of the interview. Patients will receive compensation in the form of a $25.00 gift for their participation. Patients will be informed that the interviews are entirely voluntary. A patient sample will be drawn from the chart audits. Medical records are a secondary analysis of existing data; therefore, the study team will not recruit or seek consent from patients for the chart audits. vi. Consent Process Modifications to the Consent Process i. Primary Care Practice Sites. The study team will distribute informational material to practice leads of participating sites to explain the study to practice members. Additionally, the research team will be available to explain the study. ii. Practice Members. For the survey and interviews, members of the team will explain the study using an information sheet and answer any questions before data collection begins. The observation, surveys and interviews present no more than minimal risk, do not involve procedures for which consent is required outside a research context, and avoids any documentation with interviewees’ names. iii. Patients. For interviews, the study team will explain the study, review the information sheet and answer any questions before conducting an interview. As with practice members, the information sheet presents no more than minimal risk and do not involve procedures for which consent is required outside a research context. The IRB submission includes a waiver of consent for patient-level data, which includes the chart audits and patient interviews, as consent is not feasible given our process for obtaining chart audits. The study team anticipates a sample of 80 chart audits per practice (320 chart audits in total). The number of charts to be reviewed renders the contact [CONTACT_311452]. Additionally, current contact [CONTACT_311453]. Therefore, the time and resources needed to conduct an informed consent process are not reasonable in relation to the time to conduct the study. 
Page 6 of 26  6. Procedures Involved As mentioned, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_311432]. Aim 1 is focused on the development of the intervention (i.e., INTEGRATE-D), beginning in Year 1, quarters 1 and 2. Data collection will not during this time as the study team will compi[INVESTIGATOR_311433]. When the refinement period for INTEGRATE-D is complete, the study team will move to an active phase of the intervention (i.e., Aim 2), set to begin Year 1, quarter 2.

The procedures for qualitative and quantitative approaches are documented as follows. i. Primary Care Practices. In Year 1, quarter 1, the study team will randomly assign the four primary care practices to an experimental condition (i.e., treatment and control group). Following the assignments, in Year 1, quarter [ADDRESS_383438] semi-structured interviews with staff at all four practices. Originally, the study team proposed site visit observations; however, due to COVID-19, semi-structured data collection will occur by [CONTACT_311454]-conferencing software (i.e., Cisco Webex). Follow-up interviews will occur [ADDRESS_383439]-intervention. During the semi-structured interviews, study team members will take notes. Neither protected health information (PHI) nor identifiers will be recorded. Field notes will be prepared within 24 hours of the site visit’s end. All notes will be de-identified and destroyed after the full field notes are prepared. After the baseline interviews, the study team will also conduct interim interviews with one point of contact [CONTACT_311455]-D. The interviews will be 30- minute monthly check-in phone calls to minimize recall bias and gather real-time experiences with INTEGRATE-D. The audio recordings will be professionally transcribed, checked for accuracy and de-identified. 
Page [ADDRESS_383440]-intervention (Year 2, quarter 3), the study team will conduct interviews with five patients, at each practice, that were exposed to the intervention to understand patients’ experiences with the practice changes that were implemented and the acceptability of those changes. Patient interviews will also consist of open-ended questions. All interviews will be audio-recorded and last approximately [ADDRESS_383441] virtual chart audits all four primary care practices (80 individuals per practice). The data will measure key behavioral health (i.e., depression), DMII process (i.e., self-management activities). The study team will conduct the audit, pre- intervention for a baseline, and [ADDRESS_383442]-intervention for follow-up. As noted earlier, chart audits are a secondary analysis of existing data; therefore, the study team will not recruit or seek consent from patients for the chart audits. ii. Surveys. The study team will administer two surveys during the study. The first of which is a Practice Survey. One practice staff person (e.g., office manager, clinical lead) will complete this survey for each practice. The Practice Survey collects demographic data (e.g., ownership) and include items from the Change Process Capability Questionnaire to measure quality improvement strategies the practice uses. The survey will be administered online though RedCap. The Practice Member Questionnaire will be administered online via Qualtrics to a select number of staff. We will ask the office manager for each practice to provide a list with employees’ names, role and email addresses. The study team will use a stratified random process to select staff who will receive a survey. Staff who are selected will receive an email invitation from us to complete an anonymous online survey. We anticipate that there will be 10-[ADDRESS_383443] at an in-person all-staff meeting to collected baseline and follow-up data. For now, we are altering baseline data collection only. For the initial submission, the study team is submitting for approval of the following qualitative and quantitative measures at baseline: the Pre-Site Visit Interview Guide, Site Visit Observation Guide, Practice Member Staff Interview, Patient Interview, Practice Survey, and Practice Member Questionnaire. As the study team refines the intervention, modifications to the IRB will be submitted. 
Page 8 of 26  For Study Modification #3, the study team re-submitted the Practice Survey. The revised version removes a number of descriptive items already available to the team (e.g., practice size, practice ownership), amended questions for the Oregon context (i.e., Patient Centered Primary Care Home (PCPCH) program), updated question phrasing, expanded answer choices (including “Don’t Know” and “Behavioral health team”) and incorporated three items about the use of an electronic health record system in primary care practices. 7. Data and Specimens a. Handling of Data and Specimens i. Primary Care Practices. As noted earlier, team members will produce field notes from their observations. Neither protected health information nor identifiers will be recorded. Field notes will be prepared within 24 hours of the site visit’s end. Field notes will not include names, but refer to persons by [CONTACT_10757]. Practices will be referred to using an identifying number (practice 1, 2). When reporting data in publications, reports, or grants data will remain de-identified. ii. Practice Member Staff. Interview data will be organized by [CONTACT_311456] #. Interview recordings will be stored on the encrypted OHSU network. The interview will take about 60 minutes, and with permission, the interviews will audio-recorded. The audio recordings will be professionally transcribed, checked for accuracy and de- identified. As with the observations, the study will return for follow-up interviews. For the Practice Survey, data will be collected and stored on the Oregon Clinical and Translation Research Institute (OCTRI) installation of REDCap, a highly secure and robust web-based research data collection and management system. Qualtrics, an online survey tool will be used for the Practice Member Questionnaire. Qualtrics is approved for use with OHSU-restricted information, including PHI. The study team included Qualtrics to anonymize survey data. Both surveys will be launched through the respective platforms, at baseline and follow-up. iii. Patients. Post-intervention (Year 2, quarter 3), the study team will conduct interviews with five patients, at each practice, that were exposed to the intervention to understand patients’ experiences with the practice changes that were implemented and the acceptability of those changes. Patient interviews will also consist of open-ended questions. All interviews will be audio-recorded and last approximately 60 minutes. The audio recordings will be professionally transcribed, checked for accuracy and de-identified. b. Sharing of Results with Subjects Findings will be shared with participants if requested, at completion of the study. Results will be aggregated and will not include identifying information of the clinic site, staff/providers, or patients. c. Data and Specimen Banking Data will not be used for future research planned at this time nor will specimens be collected. 
Page 9 of 26  8. Data Analysis Rapid Qualitative Assessment. The qualitative team ([CONTACT_26021], [CONTACT_311471], [CONTACT_311472]) will create baseline summaries for each intervention practice that include summarized practice characteristics, capacity data (e.g., Adaptive Reserve, CPCQ, HIT capacity) and preliminary insights from observation and interviews related to the delivery of psychosocial and DMII care. The aim is to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_311434], weakness and opportunities for change to inform the facilitator’s work with practices. Hypothesis 1 Analyses—Assessing Feasibility and Acceptability and estimating cost of INTEGRATE-D. Analyses for Aim [ADDRESS_383444] descriptive statistics to summarize each intervention practice’s scores on the acceptability of intervention, intervention appropriateness and feasibility measures. Each measure includes four items, each on a 5-point Likert scale. The study team will create and summarize scales for each measure by [CONTACT_60309] (where higher scores denote higher feasibility and acceptability) as is recommended.250 The qualitative team will examine observation and interview data following the five-step process outlined by [CONTACT_280262]276 (see Table 5, next page). The first step is to understand each practice as a separate case in its own context. To do so, the study team will analyze data as a group, reading field notes and listening to interviews from a practice to identify aspects of culture, team structure and operations, to identify how DMII care is delivered, how psychosocial care is integrated into DMII care process, and the factors influencing integration. The study team will compare pre- and post-intervention data to identify changes the practice made during INTEGRATE- D and why. Preliminary findings will be triangulated with what we learn in monthly phone calls with the key informants and survey data. The study team will also examine practice member experiences during the intervention (both good and bad), identify recommended improvements to the intervention, explore what tools and implementation strategies practices found most and least useful, and examine acceptability and feasibility. During this process, the qualitative team tags text with analytically relevant names (e.g., behavioral health screening) called “codes.” Once within- practice analyses are complete, we analyze data a second time to make comparisons across the practices; the study team will create matrices to display data across practices for comparative analyses as suggested by [CONTACT_250297].276 The study team will seek additional data sources to confirm/disconfirm and refute findings. Interview data will be use to assess the perceived costs / benefits of the INTEGRATE-D. These data will be analyzed and summarized using the procedures outlined above. Facilitator tracking data will be used to count the number of visits to each practice, the time spent during each visit (and between visits, if applicable) and the practice members who participated in QI meetings. The study team will use the average facilitator salary and estimates for practice member salaries (using national averages) to estimate the cost of the intervention. This will lay a foundation for a more thorough and systematic cost-effectiveness analysis planned for a subsequent R18. Hypotheses 2 and 3 Analyses—Assessing Change in Process of Care Measures. The primary goal of hypothesis [ADDRESS_383445] of INTEGRATE-D on process outcome measures in the context of a cluster randomized design, the study team will implement Generalized Linear Mixed 
Page 10 of 26  Models (GLMMs).277 For our primary outcomes (which we treat as continuous variables), the study team will use a model that addresses the following design features of the study: (1) the study team will include a random intercept for practice to account for clustering of patients within practices; (2) the study team will perform an intent-to-treat analysis; (3) due to the pragmatic nature of the study, the patient sample will be an open cohort, with some patients remaining in the study for the entire duration and others joining the study when they come in during the study period. Because outcomes will be assessed multiple times, it may be possible that a patient shows up in both the pre and post period; thus, the study team will consider including random effects for the patient, if needed. Depending on the outcome type, the study team will take advantage of the flexibility of GLMM to model various forms of dependent variables, including the mixed effects versions of logistic regression (binary data), beta regression (percent data), Poisson regression (count data), and Gaussian regression (normally distributed data). For example, to assess changes in screening for PHQ-2 and PHQ-9, the study team will consider a logistic mixed effects model where we model the outcome of screened (yes versus no) as a function of an indicator for period (post vs. pre), indicator for intervention arm (intervention vs. control), and the interaction between period and intervention. If sample size allows and depending on imbalance between arms, we may consider adding a small set of unbalanced patient and practice-level confounders. For the larger pragmatic hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial, the study team will extend this model to consider moderation analyses. Because we hypothesize that implementation support directly helps improve practice capacity for QI, the study team will evaluate whether practice capacity measured using Adaptive Reserve and CPCQ moderates the relationship between implementation support and distal and process of care outcomes. To do this, the study team will consider moderation analyses (e.g., heterogeneity of implementation support over time by [CONTACT_311457]) by [CONTACT_311458], time, and practice capacity in the models above.278 For hypothesis 3, which compares the change in QI strategies over time between intervention and control practices, our unit of analysis is at the practice level, as only one member of the practice answers these questions. Given the low sample size (four practices each providing two surveys, resulting in eight data points), the study team will describe the change from pre to post in both groups using descriptive means, standard deviations and ranges for the overall CPCQ score and for each individual item. For the larger pragmatic hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial, we would consider a linear mixed effects model where the dependent variable would be the score (range = - 28 to +28) and fixed effects of period (post vs. pre), intervention arm (intervention vs. control) and the interaction between period and intervention plus covariates. Hypothesis 4 Analysis—Assessing Trends in Outcome Measures. For hypothesis 4, the study team will utilize the GLMM modeling similar to what is proposed above. The study team will consider an analysis at both the patient and practice level. For patients that showed up in both pre and post periods, we are able to estimate their change in PHQ-[ADDRESS_383446]- intervention periods for both arms and compare them descriptively. For the large pragmatic trial, the study team will extend the linear mixed model to account for a longer follow-up time and the multiple observations per patient over that follow-up time. The study team will consider different functional forms of time (e.g., linear splines) to model pre-post changes.[ADDRESS_383447] analysis. The study team will also examine goodness of fit statistics and model fitting diagnostics to identify influential points and to evaluate alternative model specifications (e.g., Poisson mixed-effects models for PHQ-9). 9. Privacy, Confidentiality, and Data Security Privacy. Among the study team are four members tasked with data management, LeAnn Michaels, ORPRN program manager, will oversee the REDCap project (i.e., database). Pamela Bonsu, project director, will build and manage the Practice Member Questionnaire on Qualtrics for data collection. [CONTACT_311473] and [CONTACT_311471] will share the data with Rachel Springer, MS, a biostatistician, who will manage data from the chart audits and surveys for analysis. Andrea Baron, MPH, a qualitative analyst, who will manage the data from qualitative interviews. REDCap and Qualtrics offer controlled user access, which allows [CONTACT_311473] the ability to provide completely anonymized or deidentified data. OCTRI's REDCap software is housed on servers located in ITG's Advanced Computing Center providing locked physical security. Qualtrics’ servers are protected by [CONTACT_5019]-end firewall systems audited using an industry standard (i.e., SSAE-18 method). [CONTACT_311474] will remove PHI from chart audits and survey data. Additionally, she will perform data quality control checks and implement cleaning procedures. Data will be stored on a secure, password-protected network at OHSU. [CONTACT_311472] will also remove PHI field notes from observations and interview data. All study team members are highly trained and appropriately certified in confidentiality, data security and the current protection measures represent the cutting edge of electronic protection. [CONTACT_311472] will also store data on a secure, password-protected network at OHSU. Confidentiality. Many safeguards are in place to protect the ORPRN data. All data from the practice sites will be stored on secure servers at ORPRN. ORPRN staff will remove all personal identifiers from the charts and will assign each patient a unique identification number. ORPRN staff work with patient data from their member clinics on a regular basis and are appropriately trained in data security. Limited data will only be shared by [CONTACT_311459]. Analysts will maintain the analytical data file for a period of two years following the end of the study period to permit appropriate ongoing analysis. After two years from the study conclusion date, the files will either be destroyed, or will be used for ongoing research. In the latter instance, [CONTACT_26021] will file a new application for IRB approval. The protocol and procedures for using the data ensures no patients are individually identifiable during data transfers and analyses. We have previous experience in conducting these types of data transfers and data sharing between OHSU and ORPRN. All research staff are highly trained and appropriately certified in data security and confidentiality, and the current protection measures represent the cutting edge of electronic protection. Data Security. The proposed study includes two teams, quantitative and qualitative, managing outcome data. All of the qualitative data collected (i.e., site observations and interviews) will be securely managed by [CONTACT_18854]. Andrea Baron under the direct supervision of [CONTACT_26021]. [CONTACT_311472] will manage and coordinate the sending and receiving of qualitative study data using strict HIPAA compliant procedures. Under the direction of [CONTACT_311475], co-investigator, a biostatistician, [CONTACT_311476], will securely manage all chart audit and survey data from ORPRN practice sites. Chart audit and survey data will be securely collected and transferred to OHSU, and quality control checks will be performed. For chart audits, OHSU will work in collaboration with [CONTACT_311477] [ADDRESS_383448] TLS 1.1 protocol (AES 256-bit encryption). To maintain data integrity, REDCap is jointly managed in accordance with OHSU Information Security Directives by [CONTACT_311460]'s Biomedical Informatics Program, ensuring fidelity of database configuration and back-ups. User activities are logged to enable auditing of all data changes. Qualtrics services are hosted by [CONTACT_311461], which are audited using the SSAE-[ADDRESS_383449] and Internet 2 connectivity through a link to Seattle's Pacific Northwest Gigapop. Its IP network is based on meshed switched gigabit ethernet with distributed routing, with [ADDRESS_383450] TCP/IP or Novell Netware. OHSU’s Information Technology Group (ITG) supports both Windows and MAC workstations for OHSU personnel. It also maintains web and application server clusters for application hosting and MS SQL Server and Oracle database servers for departmental use, including support for SSL communications and databases optimized for security of protected health information. Secure communications by [CONTACT_311462]. In addition, all data will be computerized and managed on OHSU and ORPRN HIPAA-complaint computers. All data will be stored and backed up password-protected secure servers. 10. Risks and Benefits a. Risks to Subjects Primary Care Practices. The Practice Survey and the Practice Member Questionnaire descriptively illustrate the participating sites in the study. The surveys are not designed to capture PHI on practices’ patient population. For practices, risks associated with participation are minimal as the study seeks to measure quality improvement strategies employed by [CONTACT_311463]. The survey items are non-intrusive and poses minimal emotional, social, and legal harm to practices. All participating practices will sign a Memorandum of Understanding outlining expectations, responsibilities for participation, and the steps OHSU will take to mitigate risk during the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Patients. Patient outcomes are integral to interpretation of findings. Chart audits will be conducted such that protected health information (PHI) from patients is not collected and removed from the practice. This complies with federal HIPAA regulations regarding the transferring, storage, and reporting of PHI and ensures patient privacy and confidentiality. Five patients at each intervention practice (N=20) will be identified and asked to participate in an interview. Using the list of randomly selected patients who meet study criteria and 
Page 13 of 26  screen positive for depression, a practice staff member will reach out to patients, using a script that we prepare and is approved by [CONTACT_127869]. This script will guide the staff member to briefly explain the study and ask the patient if they are willing to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (and have their contact [CONTACT_225574]) with research staff for further details. Research staff will then contact [CONTACT_1962], describe the study and provide more details. If the patient agrees to participate, a member of the research team will schedule an interview. Interviews can be conducted in person at the practice or at a convenient location (e.g., coffee shop, library study room) and / or can be conducted by [CONTACT_756], if an in-person interview is not possible. Patients will be mailed or emailed an Information Sheet approved by [CONTACT_311464]. The interviewer will answer any of the patient’s questions about the study, the interview and the Information Sheet, and ask for permission to audio-record the interview. If granted, the interviewer will conduct and record the interview. If not, the interviewer will conduct the interview and take notes, or not conduct the interview at all, if the patient has changed his or her mind about participation. Participants will be instructed that the interview can stop and the recording can end at any time they indicate. The interviewer will ask about the patient’s experiences with the INTEGRATE-D intervention at his or her practice and these questions will pose very minimal risk to patients. Interview recordings are professionally transcribed and reviewed for accuracy by [CONTACT_3476]. During that process, all information that could be used to identify the patient is removed from the transcript. Findings from these data, will only be communicated in aggregate and as high-level findings with practices. b. Potential Benefits to Subjects The minimal risk to subjects is offset by [CONTACT_311465]. The participants in this study are practices and their members and there are several direct benefits to these participants. Behaviors health clinicians will receive cutting-edge training in the ADA recommendations from the experts who created that curriculum free of cost. Practices will then receive practice support to help make practice improvements. Practice sites will also receive tailored reports and education in how to use them. Practice will also receive expert consultation from leaders in integration. Practices receive this consultation for free. Participation in this study could improve practice capacity and care quality. In addition, the findings from INTEGRATE-D may be used to inform policies and practices regarding how to best implement the ADA recommendations for integrating medical and psychosocial are for patients with DMII, and will be used to inform a scale-up effort among primary care sites, other practices nationwide and the quality improvement organizations that support practice improvement in the US.

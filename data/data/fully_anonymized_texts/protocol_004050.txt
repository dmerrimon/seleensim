dose l evel of TAK -071 5 m g. Subjects aged 40 to 65 years, inclusive, will cont inue to receive 
TAK -071 at a dose level o f 7.5 m g.
Change thesuggested study  entry  criteria for investigator assessment of fall history , cogni tive 
impairment, prior history of stable antiparkinsonian medication , and prior history  of deep brain 
stimulat ion (DBS )device implantation .
Prohibit use of acetylcho linesterase inhibitors administration during st udyand modify study  
entry  and use criteria for other m edicat ions and treatm ents.
Clarify visit window s for Study

Study Number: TAK -071-2002 Phase: 2
Study Design, Main Study:
This is a phase 2, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 2 -period, 2 -treatment crossover study to evaluate the 
efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics of TAK -071 when administered orally 
once daily (QD) in subjects with Parkinson disease (PD) and evidence of cognitive impairment who are at risk for falls
and who are not concurrently taking acetylcholinesterase inhibitors . In parallel with the main cohort, healthy subjects 
will participate in the sentinel cohort portion of the study as described below.
Approximately [ADDRESS_440856] of a ≤6-week screening period, two 6 -week double -blind treatment periods separated by a 
≥3-week washout period, at -home assessments during the third week of each 6-week treatment period, and a safety 
follow -up call approximately [ADDRESS_440857] dose of study drug.
At the screening visit (Visit 1), subjects who provide informed consent will proceed with screening procedures. 
Subjects who meet a current diagnosis of PD, as defined by [CONTACT_354118] (MDS) clinical diagnostic 
criteria for PD, will then be given additional assessments as specified in the schedule of study procedures.
On Day  1, subjects who continue to meet inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_440858] for safety follow -up, ie, the safety follow up call.
The figure shows a schematic of the main study (all subjects with PD):

Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 4 07September 2021
CONFIDENTIALStudy Design, Sentinel Cohort:
An initial sentinel cohort of healthy subjects will be enrolled at designated site(s), in parallel with enrollment of PD 
patients in the main cohort. Approximately 10 h ealthy subjects of either sex, aged 56 to 75 years , inclusive, will 
initially  be randomized 3:1 to TAK -071 7.5 mg versus placebo. Af teranaly sis of data from these subjects, additional 
subjects may be enrolled, including subjects over age 75. Enrollment of the sentinel cohort will conclude when 
sufficient data are available to characterize the PK in older subjects, as determined by [CONTACT_181880].
Healthy  subjects will be selected on the basis of safety considerations. Of particular importance is exclusion on the 
basis of seizure risk factors, medical disease, and hepatic or renal impairment that may influence the PK of TAK -071.
Assessments f or healthy subjects will be limited to safety, tolerability, rich PK sampling, and samples for DNA 
(optional) and biomarkers.
After the PK, safety, and physiologically based PK modeling data from the sentinel cohort have been assessed, a 
decision will be made about the dose for the remaining subjects with PD to be enrolled in the main study. If older 
subjects are expected to remain below the exposure caps (potentially at a lower dose), they will also be enrolled. The 
maximum subject age and dose may be modi fied after analysis of data from the sentinel cohort. Update: At the 
completion of the sentinel cohort, based on PKmodeling, a decision was made by [CONTACT_354119] 66 to 85 years, inclusive, at a dose of 5 mg. The dose for subjects aged 40 to 65 years , inclusive, will 
continue to be 7.5mg.
The figure shows a schematic of the sentinel cohort (healthy subjects).
In unavoidable circumstances (eg, a widespread disease outbreak or natural disaster) that impact the ability to conduct 
study procedures according to the Schedule of Study Procedures, contingency measures may be implemented. The 
[LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration issued guidance on the management of clinical trials during the

Statistical Considerations:
For subjects with PD , the primary outcome, the change from baseline in gait variability during a [ADDRESS_440868] s model with a random factor for subjects, fixed factors for treatment, period, and sequence.
Drug effects on change from baseline for all endpoints will be assessed using 1 -sided tests. In all analyses the 
interaction terms and covariates will be added as appropriate.
For healthy subjects , analy sis will focus on PK (eg, Cmax, tmax, AUC inf, and AUC 24).
Sample Size Justification:
For subjects with PD , a sample size of [ADDRESS_440869] a statistically significant (α = 0.05, 
1-sided) decrease in gait variability during walking for TAK -[ADDRESS_440870] size of 0.32 (Cohen d) in the reduction of gait variability. For the sample size calculation, the study power was 
assumed to be 80%.
Given the pro posed study sample size and 80% power, a minimum detectable operational effect size for the cognitive 
battery  (α = 0.1, 1
-sided) will be 0.49. The correlations between cognitive tests are assumed to be 0.5. The minimum 
detectable (α = 0.1, 1 -sided) effect size in the number of falls will be approximately 0.3. For all calculations, the 
within -perso n correlatio n was assumed to be 0.65.

TAK -[ADDRESS_440873] -in-class muscarinic M 1positive all osteri c modulator (M 1PAM) proposed for 
the reduction o f falls and improvement of cognit ion in Parkinson disease (PD).
4.1.[ADDRESS_440874] that falls are in part a consequence of t he simultaneous loss of 
dopaminergic and cho linergic transmissio n associ ated with PD. PD is associated with a substantia l 
loss of cholinergi c fibers, which has been demonstrated using acet ylcho linesterase positron 
emissio n tom ography , as well as postm ortem histopathological analyses. Cortical cho linergic 
deficits are significant in early PD and are correlated with cognit ive decline in pat ients with PD 
and are more severe than in Alzheimer disease [1]. Modelling o f PD-related falls in animal models 
has demons trated that loss of striatal dopamine synergizes with cho linergic neuron loss in the basa l 
forebrain to impair gait and increase falls.
There i s clinical evidence that cholinergic drugs may  reduce fall ri sk in patients with PD. The 
largest published study to date (n =130, [
2]showed that rivastigmine re duced step time variabilit y, 
a correlate of fall risk, and the risk of falling was lowered by [CONTACT_3450] 50% with 6 months of 
treatm ent. A sm aller study  (n=23, [3]) showed that donepezil, an acet ylcho linesterase inhibitor 
(AChEI), also reduced the risk of falls or near falls by [CONTACT_3450] 50%. Li et al [4]studi ed [ADDRESS_440875] igmine, another AChEI. 
Changes in cognit ion and fall incidenc e were compared between the 2 groups. Patients with mild 
cogni tive impairment (MCI) (odds ratio [OR]
=2.5) or dementia (OR =5.5) fell significant ly 
more than pat ients with intact cogni tion. Rivast igmine improved cognit ion and reduced the 
number of falls relative to placebo (OR =0.3). However, these studies suffer fro m significant 
methodol ogical flaws. A recent publicat ion [5]reported that donepezil did not improve balance in 
patients wi th PD.
Although these findings are so mewhat supportive regarding AChEIs, efficacy has not been 
concl usively  dem onstrated. TAK -[ADDRESS_440876] 1 y ear after the onset of motor 
symptoms (termed Parkinson disease dement ia [PDD]) or less than 1 year after the onset of motor 
symptoms (termed demen tia with Lewy  body [DLB]). The term  Lewy  body dement ia (LBD) 
enco mpasses both PDD and DLB. Current ly, many experts in the field believe that there are few 
fundamental bio logical  differences between these condit ions and the term LBD will, therefore, be 
used here.
LBD has a major impact on funct ioning, cost of care, and qualit y of life. Before the development 
of LBD, pati ents ini tially experience MCI. In addi tion to the di rect impact on funct ioning, 
cogni tive impairment in patients with PD also significant ly increases the risk for falls as described 
above.
Patients with PD show early and marked degenerat ion of the cho linergic system including a loss of 
cholinergic fibers fro m the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM), which mainly supplies the cortex, 
and the peduncul opontine nucleus, which mainly supplies the basal ganglia, thalamus, brainstem, 
and rostral spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. The degenerat ion of the NBM in particular is strongly related to cognit ive 
impairment in PD. As noted in Section 4.1.[ADDRESS_440877] to cognit ive impairment.
TAK -071 coul d be valuable in the treatment of patients with PD through reducing fall risk and/or 
improving cognit ion, both unmet needs for patients. Therefore, the present study  will evaluate 
both.
4.1.3 Impairments in Speech in PD
Speech difficult ies occur in up to 90% of patients with PD over the course of the disease and 
significant ly affect their social interact ions and qualit y of life. Speech impairment in PD is likely 
the resul t of the combined effect of impaired motor control and cognit ive deficit s. In PD, a 
reducti on in dopamine is associated with the cardinal motor symptoms of trem or, sl owness of 
movement (brady kinesia) and m uscle ri gidity (stiffness). However, dopamine replacement 
therapy  showed inconsistent effects on speech performance, suggest ing the contribution o f 
alternat ive neurotransmitters during speech processing. The voc al apparatus is under motor contro l 
and is therefore impacted by  [CONTACT_941] l oss of cholinergic projections observed in PD. Moreover, 
previous studies reported language processing deficits are associated with cognit ive dysfunct ion in 
PD [6]. The rol e of the cho linergic s ystem  in cogniti on has been well established. Therefore, it is 
plausible that TAK -071, through enhancing cho linergic funct ion, will improve both motor control 
and cognit ive funct ion in pat ients with PD, and consequent ially speech funct ion. Analysis of 
spee
ch in pat ients with PD will provide data that are complementary  to m easures of walking and 
other complex motor tasks.

schizophrenia but was limited by [CONTACT_20721] (AEs), while donepezil was not effective in this 
assay.
TAK -071 al so significant ly impr oved attenti onal function (m easured by [CONTACT_354121] [SAT]) in rats with partial basal forebrain cholinergic lesio ns at doses as low as 0.1 mg/kg, a 
model where AChEIs are ineffective [7]. These findings are highly significant because the lesio ns 
in this model mirror the loss of cho linergic fibers in PD and because performance on this task is 
correl ated with gait abnormalit ies and falls in a rat model of PD [
8,9]. These data strong ly support 
the potenti al of TAK -[ADDRESS_440880] ing 
cholinergic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
4.1.5 Differentiation From AChEIs and Other M 1PAMs
There i s a strong scient ific basis for the notion that M 1PAMs may be superior to AChEIs for falls 
and cognit ion. It has been established that ACh signals through slow “tonic” release as well as fast 
“phasic” release. Phasic ACh plays a crit ical ro le in the modulat ion of attention and other frontal 
cogni tive functions that m ay be critical for cogni tive gait control. AChEIs chronically elevate 
synaptic ACh levels, which may impair phasic signaling, whereas M1PAMs such as TAK -[ADDRESS_440881] of cho linergic lesio ns 
on dopaminergic deficits in falls in a rat model of PD [
7]. Rats with dual cho linergic -dopa minergic 
lesions have clearly shown more frequent falls than rats with eit her cho linergic or dopaminergic 
lesions. Moreover, the attention performance and falls were only correlated in these animals wit h 
dual lesions. Therefore, enhancement of cholinergic function may have a posit ive impact not only 
on cogni tion, but al so falls in PD. Whereas AChEIs are ineffect ive in this dual -lesio n model, 
TAK -[ADDRESS_440882] pharmaco logy from other M 1PAMs. For example, [COMPANY_006]’s select ive M 1
PAM MK -7622 has a higher binding cooperativit y (α-value: 511, where α is the f old increase of 
ACh affinit y for its binding si te due to the effects of the PAM) than TAK -071 (α -value: 199). 
Higher binding cooperativit y has been shown to be strongly related to poor gastrointestinal 
tolerabilit y in nonclinical studies [
10]. TAK -071, but not MK -7622, showed synergy  with 
donepezil in the scopolamine -induced cognit ive deficit model. Taken together wi th other 
nonclinical studies co mpar ing these drugs, these data strongly  suggest that TAK -[ADDRESS_440883] in vivo pharmaco logy.

TAK -[ADDRESS_440884] ed in phase 1 studies in healt hy subjects.
Nonclinical toxico logy studi es showed convulsio ns in rats and monkeys and neurotoxicit y in rats 
at high doses. Consequent ly, clinical doses are limited to those expected to result in plasma 
TAK -071 exposures of no more than 600 ng/mL and 14,000 h*ng/mL for maximum observed 
concentration (C max) and area under the concentration -time curve fro m time 0 to 24 hours (AUC 24), 
respectively . This allows up to a 7.5 mg once daily (QD) clinical dose. After 7.5 mg QD doses, th e 
projected maximum observed concentration at steady  state (C max,ss) and area under the 
concentration -time curve fro m time 0 to 24 hours at steady  state (AUC 24,ss) are 549 ng/mL and 
12,900 h*ng/mL, respect ively, in subjects [ADDRESS_440885] not be coadministered with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor ( eg, 
donepezil , rivastigmine, galantamine )because of th epotential to cause convulsions based on

1 dose of TAK -071. There were no SAEs or deaths reported. Review of all available clinical safet y 
data indicates that TAK -071 is generally safe and well tolerated.
Inform ation from the co mpleted phase 1 studies, together with the nonclinical toxicit y studies in 
rats and monkeys, indicates that the benefit -risk balance for TAK -071 is deemed acceptable at the 
proposed dose of 7.5 mg. Clinical dosing of TAK -071 with donepezil and other AChEIs is not 
supported.

6.3.[ADDRESS_440910] Selection Considerations
Consistent with our focus on fall prevent ion, we are selecting subjects with PD who are at elevated 
risk of falling based on a history o f falls. On the other hand, subjects who are at advanced stages of 
PD will not be able to complete gait assessments. Sub jects with Hoehn and Yahr stage ≥2 and <[ADDRESS_440911] subjects with sufficient cognitive impairment to avoid 
ceiling effects so that efficacy  for cogni tion and improvem ent of gai t via effects on cogni tion can 
be observed. On the other hand, very  significant cognitive impairment will make fo llowing 
instructi ons and com pleting assessments difficult. Given these considerations, s ubjects who score

cogni tion assessments at screening will therefore be se lected.
TAK -[ADDRESS_440912] cognitive gait 
control ; gait vari abilityis a more appropriate primary  endpoint for sm all initial patient studies, 
such as the present study , than actual  falls.
The wearable pen dant sensor generates [ADDRESS_440913] a fall 
from the raw sensor data. If a fall is detected, the time stamp of the fall is recorded and transmitted 
immediately , and the raw sensor data before and after the fall is saved locally on the device for 
offline analysis. Daily, weekly, and monthly number of falls are then calculated on the basis of the 
time- stam ped falls.
6.3.3 Dose Justification
TAK -071 has been tested in human phase 1 clinical studi es in heal thy subjects 18 to 55 y ears ol d 
(197 subjects total, 139 dosed with TAK -071). Aft er single (1 to 160 mg) and mult iple (3 to 15 mg 
QD) oral doses of TAK- 071, systemic exposure (C maxand AUC) to TAK -071 increased in only a 
slight ly less than d ose proporti onal manner. TAK -071 dem onstrated a l ong half -life of 46 to 
61hours and reasonable brain penetration after oral dose. TAK -071 was well tol erated, wi th no 
deaths or SAEs. There was 1 discontinuation due to headache and 1 severe treatment -emergent 
adverse event (TEAE) of syncope. Both subjects were on TAK -[ADDRESS_440914] ions for a 7.5 m g QD dose i n humans, which is the dose proposed 
for this study  in PD, yield a C minexposure (ie, 432 ng/mL) that is 6.0- fold the rat C maxexposure at 
0.1 m g/kg (i e, 72 ng/mL), the predicted efficacious dose from the cholinergic lesio n model. 
Therefore, there is ample margin to test the efficacy o f TAK -071 in humans.
The subjects selected for this study are older than those in phase 1 clinical studies, 40 to 85years, 
inclusive ,versus 18 to 55 years, inclusive. The potent ial exposure difference was assessed through 
an initial preliminary physi ologically  based PK (PBPK) modeling of phase [ADDRESS_440915] ion indicated an increase of less than 25% in mean 
exposure measures (C maxand AUC) for a 7.[ADDRESS_440916] a geometric mean C max,ssof 580 ng/mL and a geometric mean 
AUC 24,ssof 11,100 hr*ng/mL. Higher exposure was achi eved by  [CONTACT_354124] [ADDRESS_440917] and ensure safet y for older subjects, an init ial small sent inel cohort of 
healt hy subjects aged 56 to 75 years , inclusive ,was enro lled with rich PK sampling after a single 
dose ( at designated site[s]; see Appendix H). The PBPK model developed fro m the sent inel cohort 
TAK -[ADDRESS_440918] that subj ects 40 to 65 y ears can continue to receive TAK -071 7.5 m g QD. A l ower 
dose of TAK -071 5 mg QD is reco mmended for subjects 66 to 85 years to keep the exposure under 
the exposure cap, ie, 600 ng/mL for C max,ss and 14,000 hr*ng/mL for AUC 24,ss. Bas ed on these 
resul ts, a decisio n was made to expand the main cohort to include subjects with PD aged 66 to 85 
years, inclusive, at a dose of 5 mg. Of note, the PBPK modeling projections of geometric mean 
Cmax,ssand AUC 24,ssare bel ow the exposure caps. For subjects aged 40 to 65 y ears, inclusive, the 
projections of geo metric m ean C max,ssand AUC 24,ssat a dose of 7.5 mg are 586 ng/mL and 
11,663 hr*ng/mL, respectively. For subjects aged [ADDRESS_440919] ions of 
geom etric mean C max,ssandAUC 24,ssat a dose of 5 mg for TAK -071 are 556 ng/mL and 11,624 
hr*ng/mL, respectively .
After the PK, safet y, and physio logically  based PK m odeling data from  the sent inel cohort have 
been assessed, a decisio n will be made about the dose for the remain ing subjects with PD to be 
enrolled. If older subjects are expected to remain below the exposure caps, they will also be 
enrolled. The maximum subject age and dose may be modified after analysis o f data from  the 
sentinel cohort.

8.4 Study Drug Blind Maintenance
The study  drug blind will be maintained using the IWRS.
Since the maintenance of the blind may be co mpromised because of results fro m drug 
concentrations and/or pharmacodynamics assessments, such results should not be disclo sed before 
blind breaking. In the event that results must be reported to the investigator before breaking the 
blind, all efforts should be made to maintain the blind (eg, as changing a medicat ion ID number to 
avoid identificat ion of subjects by [CONTACT_354128]). Detailed procedures for

A separate informed consent form pertaining to collect ion, storage, and analysis of the sample 
must be obtained before collec ting a bl ood sam ple for DNA analysis research for this study . The 
provi sion of consent to collect and analyze the sample for DNA analysis is independent of consent 
to the other aspects of the study . Provi ding a DNA sample is optional for this study .
9.1.[ADDRESS_440962] has any  significant 
condi tions or di seases rel evant to the di sease under study  that resolved at or before signing of 
inform ed consent. Ongoing condit ions are considered concurrent medical condi tions (see 
Secti on9.1.10 ).
In addit ion, informat ion on the subject’s PD history including symptoms and disease 
characterist ics and history  of falls over the past 6 mo nths will be co llected.
Medicat ion history  informat ion to be obtained includes any medicat ion relevant to eligibilit y 
criteria stopped at or within 30 days before signing of informed consent.
9.1.3 Physical Examination Procedure
At screening and both baseline visits, a physical examinat ion (defined as the assessment before 
first dose of study  drug) will be conducted consisting of the fo llowing body  systems: (1) ey es; (2) 
ears, nose, throat; (3) cardiovascular system; (4) respi[INVESTIGATOR_36517] ; (5) gastrointest inal system; 
(6)dermatologic system; (7) extremit ies; (8) musculoskeletal  system; (9) lymph nodes; and 
(10) other.
At the l ast vi sit of each peri od, (11) nervous system will be added to the examinat ion.
All subsequent phy sical examinat ions shoul d assess clinically  significant changes from  the 
assessment before first dose examinat ion.
TAK -[ADDRESS_440963] weight and height measured while wearing indoor clothing and with shoes 
off. The BMI is calculated using metric units with the formula provided below. Height is recorded 
in centimeters without decimal places. Weight is collected in kilograms (kg) with [ADDRESS_440964]. 
BMI should be derived as:
Metri c: BMI = wei ght (kg)/height (m)2
Note that although hei ght is reported in centimeters, the formula uses meters for height; meters can 
be determined from cent imeters by [CONTACT_45322] 100. Thus, for example, if height =176 cm 
(1.76 meters) and weight =79.2 kg, then BMI =79.2/1.762=25.[ZIP_CODE] kg/m2.
The values s hould be reported to [ADDRESS_440965] by  [CONTACT_45323]. Thus, in the above example BMI 
woul d be reported as 25.6 kg/m2. Because the BMI is used as an exclusio n criterion thi s 
determinat ion must be made after rounding.
9.1.[ADDRESS_440966] igator will r eview all vital signs for real -time safet y monitoring purposes. Vi tal signs

CONFIDENTIAL9.[IP_ADDRESS] Cogstate Modified Chase Test
The m odified Chase test i s administered prior to the first admin istrati on of  the m odified Groton 
Maze Learning test (screening visit) for addit ional subject familiarizat ion. Subjects are required to 
“chase” a moving box around the grid for about 30 seconds, moving 1 box at a time wit hout 
skippi[INVESTIGATOR_19263].
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_440981]: The task begins wit h a chase task to allow subjects to 
beco me familiar with the task context. The subjects are shown a 10 × 10 grid of tiles on a computer 
touch screen. The subjects are instr ucted to ‘chase’ a moving tile around the grid. Once they 
understand the rules, they  can proceed onto the timed chase test, where they  must chase the target 
for [ADDRESS_440982] is shown the same 10 × [ADDRESS_440983] the end (bottom right). The subjects move by  [CONTACT_354133] a tile next to their 
current l ocati on wi th the st ylus. After each move is made, the computer indicates whether this is 
correct by  [CONTACT_354134] a green checkmark (ie, this is the next step in the pathway ), or incorrect by  
[CONTACT_354134] a red cross (ie, this is not the next step in the pathway, or the subject has broken a rule, 
see below). If the cho ice was correct, the step in the pat hway remains highlighted and the subjects 
must l ocate the next step in the pathway . If a cho ice was incorrect (ie, a red cross is revealed), the 
subjects must touch the last correct location (ie, the last green checkmark revealed) and then make 
a different tile choice to advance toward the end. While mo ving through the hidden maze, the 
subjects are required to adhere to [ADDRESS_440984] (eg, 
move back to a location that displa yed a green t ick, but from which they have since mo ved). If the 
subjects choose a tile that is not part of the hidden pathway , but the tile choi ce is wi thin the rul es, 
this is recorded as a differen t type of  error (eg, n ot a rul e break). Thi s coul d be due to chance (the 
first time through the m aze) or due to misremembering the path on subsequent attempts. The

The follow ing procedures apply for contraception and pregnancy avoidance.
1.Highly effect ive methods of contracep tion are defined as “those, alone or in combinat ion, that 
resul t in a l ow failure rate (i e, less than 1% failure rate per y ear when used consistent ly and 
correctly ). In this study, where medicat ions and devices containing hormones are unacceptable, 
the acc eptabl e methods are nonhormonal methods only:
Intrauterine device.
Bilateral tubal occlusio n and bilateral tubal ligation.
Vasectomized partner (provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the study 
participant and that the vasectomized partner has received m edical assessment of the 
surgi cal success.
True sexual abstinence, only if this is in line wit h the preferred and usual lifest yle of the 
subject. True abst inence is defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the 
entire peri od of  the study , from [ADDRESS_441005] dose.
2.Unacceptable methods of contraception are:
Horm onal methods. Horm onal contraceptives are not considered to be highly effective 
contraceptives in the context of this study  becaus e the impact of TAK -[ADDRESS_441006] ive method of contraception listed above.
Periodic abst inence (eg, calendar, ovulat ion, symptothermal, postovulat ion methods).

donati on as part of the study  procedures. Such guidance should include a reminder of the 
following:
a)Contraceptive requirements of the study .
b)Reasons for use of barrier methods (ie, condom) in males with pregnant partners.
c)Assessment of subject compliance through questions such as:
i.Have you used the contraception consistent ly and correctly since the last visit ?
ii.Have y ou forgotten to use contraception since the last visit ?
iii.Are your menses late (even in women wit h irregular or infrequent menstrual cycles a 
pregnancy test must be performed if the answer is “yes”).
iv.Is there a chance you could be pregnant ?

regul ations) may be used per approval by [CONTACT_36613].
–Approval may be granted to omit collection of certain study  assessments and visit windows 
may be extended.
–When approval is given for a subject to miss an in -person study visit, a study site physician 
will speak directly wit h the subject by [CONTACT_63195] (eg, a computer- based 
video communicat ion) during each visit window to assess subject safet y and overall 
clinical status.
–At minimum, the study  site physician or other qualified site personnel should conduct the 
following assessments within specified -visit window timeframes: AE assessments, 
docum entation of  concomi tant m edicati on, administrati on of  C-SSRS, and an assessment 
of clinical symptoms.

involve audio or video recording where allowed by [CONTACT_354137]. In some cases, audio 
and/or video recording of subject interviews may not be possible. This will be documented 
in the study  records.
–Sites m ay seek approval  to extend a visit window in order to conduct an on -site visi t. 
Assessments that cannot be completed during the protocol -specified window will be 
considered missing data and such departures will be recorded in the study  records.
–The m aximum  interval between successive study  visit s may be no l onger than 8 weeks.
The final visit should be perfo rmed in person. When it is not possible for the subject to come to 
the study site, the preferred alternat ive for the final visit is for qualified study site personnel to 
go to the subject’s residence and conduct the protocol -specified procedures in that lo cation. 
Assessments collected at a subject’s residence should comply wit h applicable local

Diagnoses versus signs and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single  diagnosis. Acco mpanying signs (including 
abnorm al laboratory  values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as 
additional AEs. If  a diagnosis is unkno wn, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded

CONFIDENTIALLaboratory  values and ECG findings:
Changes in laboratory  values or ECG findings are only  considered to be PTEs or AEs if they 
are judged to be clinically significant (i e, if so me action or intervent ion is required or if the 
investigator judges the change to be bey ond the range of normal physio logic fluctuati on). A 
laboratory  or ECG re -test and/or continued monitoring of an abnormal value or finding are not 
considered an interventi on. In addi tion, repeated or addi tional noninvasive testing for 
verification, evaluat ion or monitoring o f an abnormalit y is not consi dered an intervent ion.
If abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of pathology for which there is an 
overall diagnosis (eg, increased creat inine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriately  as a PTE or as an AE.
Pre-exist ing condit ions:
Pre-exist ing condit ions (present at the time o f signing of informed consent) are conside red 
concurrent medical condit ions and should NOT be recorded as PTEs or AEs. Baseline 
evaluat ions (eg, laboratory tests, ECG, x -rays) should NOT be recorded as PTEs unless related 
to study procedures. However, if the subject experiences a worsening or comp lication of such a 
concurrent medical condit ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded appropriately 
as a PTE (worsening or complication occurs before start of study drug) or an AE (worsening or 
complicat ion occurs after start of study  drug). In vestigators shoul d ensure that the event term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
If a subject has a pre -exist ing epi[INVESTIGATOR_39747] (eg, asthma, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]) any 
occurrence of an epi[INVESTIGATOR_354097] a PTE/AE if the condit ion beco mes more 
frequent, serious or severe in nature. I Investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded 
captures the change in the condit ion from Baseline (eg, “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a degenerat ive concurre nt medical condit ion (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid 
arthri tis), worsening of the condition should only  be recorded as a PTE/AE if occurring to a 
greater extent to that which would be expected. Investigators should ensure that the AE term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
Worsening of PTEs or AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of a PTE after the start of study  drug, 
the worsening or complication should be recorded as an AE. Invest igators should ensure t hat 
the AE term recorded captures the change in the PTE (eg, “worsening of…”).
If the subject experiences a worsening or complicatio n of an AE after any change in study drug, 
the worsening or complication should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators should ensure 
that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “w orsening of…”).
Changes in intensit y of AEs/serious PTEs:
If the subject experiences changes in intensit y of an AE/seri ous PTE, the event should be 
captured once with the maximum intensit y recorded.
TAK -[ADDRESS_441028] anned procedures (surgeries or intervent ions):
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled before signing of informed 
consent are not considered PTEs or AEs. However, if a preplanned procedure is performed 
early (eg, as an emergency) due to a worsening of the pre -exist ing condit ion, the worsening o f 
the condit ion should be recorded as a PTE or an AE . Complicat ions result ing from any planned 
surgery  shoul d be reported as AEs.
Elect ive surgeries or procedures:
Elect ive procedures performed where there is no change in the subject’s medica l condit ion 
shoul d not be recorded as PTEs or AEs, but should be documented in the subject’s source 
docum ents. Com plicat ions result ing from an elect ive surgery should be reported as AEs.
Overdose:
Cases of overdose with any medicat ion wit hout manifested si de effects are NOT considered PTEs 
or AEs, but instead will be documented on the eCRF. Any manifested side effects will be 
considered PTEs or AEs and will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF.

The rel ationship of each AE to study  drug(s) will be assessed using the fo llowing categori es:
Related: An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug (including the 
course after withdrawal of the drug), or for which possible involvement of the drug cannot be 
ruled out , although factors other than the drug, such as underlying diseases, complic ations, 
concomitant medications and concurrent treatments, may also be responsible.
Not Related: An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug and/o r 
that can reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_1604], such as unde rlying diseases, complications, 
concomitant medications and concurrent treatments.
10.1.7 Relationship to Study Procedures
Relationship (causalit y) to study  procedures should be determined for all PTEs and AEs.
The relationship should be assessed as Related if the investigator considers that there is reasonable 
possibilit y that an event is due to a study procedure. Otherwise, the relationship should be assessed 
as Not Related.
10.1.8 Start Date
The start date of the AE/PTE is the date that the first signs/symptoms were noted by  [CONTACT_14426]/or invest igator.

[IP_ADDRESS] PTE and AE Reporting
At each study  visit, the investi gator will assess whether any  subjective AEs have occurred. A 
neutral  quest ion, such as “How have you been feeling since your last visit ?” may be asked. 
Subjects m ay report AEs occurri ng at any  other time during the study . Subjects experi encing a 
serious PTE m ust be monitore d until the symptoms subside and any clinically relevant changes in 
laboratory  values have returned to baseline or there is a sat isfactory  explanati on for the change. 
Nonserious PTEs, related or unrelated to the study  procedure, need not to be fo llowed-up for the 
purposes of the protocol.
All subjects experiencing AEs, whether considered associated with the use of the study drug or not, 
must be monitored until the symptoms subside and any  clinically relevant changes in laboratory  
values have returned to bas eline or until there is a satisfactory  explanat ion for the changes 
observed. All PTEs and AEs will be documented in the PTE/AE page of the eCRF, whether or not

Protocol Amendment 3
The primary  reasons for thi s amendment are to:
Add healt hy subjects at the beginning of the study as a sent inel cohort for rich pharmacokinet ic 
(PK)sampling , to be conducted at designated sites . Rem ove subjects wi th Parkinson di sease 
(PD)from the sentinel cohort. To cl arify procedures that are specif ic to each cohort, m ove 
inform ation specific to the sent inel cohort to an appendix andremove sentinel cohort 
inform ation from ma in text.
Allow init ial subjects with PD to enroll in main study in parallel to when the sentinel cohort is 
running. These subjects must be ≤65 y ears ol d. Older subjects with PD may  be enrolled 
pending the results of the sentinel cohort PK.
Remove cogni tive load from the primary  object ive and endpo int.Add an 
exploratory /additional objective and endpo int around evaluation of gait parameters, and clarify 
that exploratory endpo ints for change fro m baseline on gait parameters, gait variabilit y, double 
support time , and self -directed turns are in the presence versus absence of cognit ive loading.
In this amendment, minor grammat ical, editorial, formatting, and administrative changes not

H.2 STUDY DESIGN FOR SENTINEL COHORT (HEALTHY SUBJECTS)
An initial sent inel cohort of healt hy subjects will be enrolled at designated site(s), in parallel wit h 
enrollment of PD patients in the main cohort. Approximately 10 healt hy subjects of either sex, 
aged 56 to 75 y ears, inclusive, will be rando mized 3:1 to TAK -071 versus placebo. After analysis 
of data from  these subjects, addit ional subjects m ay be enrolled, potenti ally including subjects 
over age 75. Enrollment of the sent inel cohort will conclude when sufficient data are available to

cohort will conclude when sufficient data are available to characterize the PK in o lder subjects, as 
determined by [CONTACT_456].
Healthy subjects will be selected on the basis of safet y considerat ions. Of particular importance is
exclusio n on t he basis of seizure risk factors, medical disease, and hepat ic or renal impairment that 
may influence the PK of TAK-071.
Assessments for healthy subjects will be limited to safet y, tolerabilit y, rich PK sampling, and 
samples for DNA (optiona l) and bi omarkers.
After the PK, safet y, and physi ologically  based PK m odeling data from  the sent inel cohort have 
been assessed, a decisio n will be made about the dose for the remaining subjects with PDto be 
enrolled. If older subjects are expected to remain below the exposure caps, they  will also be 
enrolled. The m aximum  subject age and dose m ay be m odified after analysis of data from the 
sentinel cohort.

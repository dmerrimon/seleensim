PS0018 is a multicenter, 48 -week, open- label extension study  to assess the long -term safet y, 
tolerability , and efficacy  of bimekizumab in eligible adult subjects with moderate to severe 
chronic plaque psoriasis who participated in PS001 6. 
During the Open
-Label Treatment Period, subjects will attend study  visits at the site every  
4weeks (Q4W) for study assessments and administration of bimekizumab (if applicable) b y 
study  site staff through Week 48. Following comple tion or earl y withdrawal from the 48 -week 
Open -Label Treatment Period, subjects will return for a Safety  Follow -Up (SFU) Visit at 
[ADDRESS_526930] dose of bimekizumab. Subjects withdrawing earl y from the study  will 
undergo the Early  Withdrawal Vis it assessments and will enter the SFU Period.
Bimekizumab will initiallybe administered at a dose of 160mg Q4W subcutaneously  (sc) during
the 48- week Open- Label Treatment Period .There will be an option to increase the dose to 
320mg Q4W at the discretion of the Investigator if the subject ’s Psoriasis Area and Severit y 
Index (PASI )response is ≥50% to < 75% reduction from the Baseline of PS001 [ADDRESS_526931]’s disease is adequatel y controlled on the 
320mg Q4W dose, they  may  return 
to 160mg Q4W at the discretion of the Investigator . The decision to return to 160mg Q4W
dosing should be based upon treatment response, tolerability , and Investigator discretion, with 
the aim to use the dosing regimen that achieves the optimal benefit -risk fo
r each subject. If a 
subject does not achieve a PASI 50 atWeek 12 or later then they  will be withdrawn from the 
study .
Up to 45 subjects are anticipated to enrol l in PS 0018 at approximately  15sites in Europe and 
North America , with possible extension to o
ther regions and countries as required in PS0016.
The primary  objective of the study  is to assess the long -term safet y and tolerability  of 
bimekizumab . Secondary objectives of the stud y are to assess the safet y and tolerability of 
increasing the dose of bi mekizumab from 160mg Q4W to 320mg Q4W ; to assess the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of bimekizumab; to assess the immunogenicit y of bimekizumab; and to 
assess the efficacy  of open
-label bimekizumab 160mg Q4W administered over 48 weeks.
The primary  safet y variable i s the incidence of treatment -
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
adjusted by  [CONTACT_417702]. The secondary  safet y variables are severit y 
and frequency  of TEAEs and change from Baseline of PS0016 in clinical laboratory  values 
(chemist ry, hematology , and urinal ysis), vital sign s, phy sical examination, and 12 -lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG) results.
Pharmacokinetic variables are plasma concentrations of bimekizumab. The immunological 
variable is anti -bimekizumab antibody  levels prior to and following stud y treatment. The 
efficacy  assessments are PASI , Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) , body  surface area 
(BSA) affected b y psoriasis, and the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_74017] (HADS) ; a detailed 
list of efficacy  variables is presented in Section 4.4.

2.1 Psoriasis
Psoriasis is a common, chronic inflammatory  disease chara cterized b y a series of linked cellular 
changes in the skin: h yperplasia of epi[INVESTIGATOR_98713], vascular h yperplasia and ectasia, and

the pathophy siolog y of psoriasis is not fully  understood, the importance of T -cells and 
inflammatory  cytokines has been demonstrated by  [CONTACT_417703][INVESTIGATOR_417685] (Kreuger andEllis, 2005). 
There are a variety  of forms including pl aque, guttate, inverse, pustular, and ery throdermic. 
Plaque psoriasis is the most common, comprising approximately  80% to 90% of all cases. 
Approximately  17% of those with psoriasis have moderate to severe disease (Kurd etal,2008).
In addition to the imp act on skin, psoriasis has a multitude of psy chosocial and emotional effects 
on patients, including increased self -consciousness, frustration, fatigue, depression, and suicidal 
ideation. As a result, patients frequentl y report sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_332805], difficulti
es at work, problems 
interacting with family members, disrupted leisure activities, and sexual difficulties 
(Dowlatshahi etal,2014; Gottlieb, 2005; Mukhtar etal,2004; Ortonne, 2004; 
Krueger etal,2001). 
A number of comorbidities have been associated with psoriasis, especiall y with more severe 
psoriasis. Psoriatic arthritis, cardiovascular disease, metabolic sy ndrome, chronic pulmonary  
disease, peptic ulcer disease, renal disease, and diabetes have all been demonstrated to have an 
increased prevalence in psoriasis patients (Yeung etal,2013; Christophers etal,2010; 
Gisondi etal,2007; Gelfand etal,2006).
2.1.1 Global epi[INVESTIGATOR_417686]  3% of the adult US population (Rachakonda etal,2014; 
Kurd andGelfand, 2009) a nd its onset can begin at any  age (Augustin etal,2010; 
Icen etal,2009). The reported worldwide incidence and prevalence of psoriasis varies greatly  
depending on age, gender, ethnicity , and geography  primarily  due to genetic and environmental 
factors. E
stimates of incidence and prevalence include all ty pes of psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis is 
the most common form of psoriasis therefore reported estimates of the magnitude of this 
condition are likel y weighted heavil y by [CONTACT_352209]. Both the incidence and p revalence of 
psoriasis are higher among Caucasians and those living in higher latitudes. Psoriasis affects 
approximately  2% to 4% of the population of western countries. Geographical differences are 
also influenced b y case definition, study  design, and the definition of prevalence 
(Parisi etal,2013; Langley etal,2005; Ray chaudhuri andGross, 2000).
2.1.2 Current treatments for psoriasis
Therap y for patients with psoriasis varies according to the severit y of disease. L imited or mild 
disease is often treated wi th topi[INVESTIGATOR_352145] D analogs. 
Patients with more severe disease are often treated with chemo photo therapy , methotrexate, the 
oral phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor (apremilast), or biologic agents, such as tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists, interleuki n (IL) 12/23 inhibitors, and IL -17A inhibitors. The 
effectiveness of TNF inhibitors in the treatment of psoriasis has been demonstrated in man y 
Phase 3 clinical studies and has led to the approval of multiple TNF in hibitors for use in patients 
with moderate to severe psoriasis. I nterleukin inhibitors include secukinumab and ixekizumab , 
IL-
17A inhibitor s approved for treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. Ustekinumab is an 
IL-12/[ADDRESS_526932] therapi[INVESTIGATOR_417687]:

Confidential Page 13of 78Topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826] (eg, triam cinolone, mometasone, clobetasol, betamethasone, hy drocortisone) 
are generally  used as first-line treatment of psoriasis. High- strength steroids are t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y 
reserved for use on the arms and legs. Areas such as the face and skin folds (axillary , 
inguinal 
regions, etc) are usually  treated with a low potency  steroid. Chronic use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_397111]- related side effects and is generally  discouraged.
Vitamin D analogs (eg, calcipotriol and tacalcitol) are commonl y used to treat mild to 
moderate psoriasis, and work best within the mild patients. They  are safe but lack efficacy  
for man y moderate to severe patients.
Chemophoto therap y is a frequent option for moderate to severe patients, but the 
inconvenience of multiple treatment visits and varying efficacy  limits its use in the market. 
Methotrexate is a sy stemic immunosuppressant and is used in moderate to severe patients. 
Toxicity  concerns, particularly  in older patients, are a major drawback.
Apremilast is an oral small-molecule inhibitor of PDE4 that is also approved for treatment of 
adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors work 
intracellularl y to modulate a network of pro -inflammatory  and anti -inflammatory  mediators. 
Phosphodiesterase 4 is a cy clic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) -specific PDE and the 
dominant PDE in inflammatory  cells. Phosphodiesterase 4 inhibition elevates intracellular 
cAMP levels, which in turn down -regulates the inflammatory  response by  [CONTACT_397136]α, IL-23, IL- 17, and other inflammatory  cytokines.
Biologics, including TNFα inhibitors (adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab), 
IL-
12/23 inhibitors (ustekinumab), and IL-17A inhibitors are the treatment options of choice 
for patients with moderate to severe pla ques psoriasis who are candidates for sy stemic 
therap y or phototherap y. These products are injected sc or delivered via intravenous (iv) 
infusion and while effective, TNFα inhibitors come with boxed warnings including the risk 
of serious infections and reports of l ymphoma and malignancy  in children and adolescent 
patients. The efficacy  of TNFα inhibitors in treating psoriasis has been attributed to their 
inhibition of Th17- T cells. Different from the traditional systemic drugs that impact the entire 
immune system, biologics target specific parts of the immune sy stem and offer reduced 
multi- organ toxicity  and adverse effects associated with traditional treatments.
Secukinumab has been approved in the US and the EU for the treatment of moderate to 
severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for s ystemic therap y or 
phototherap y. Secukinumab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that inhibits the activity of the 
IL-17A isoform and is the first approved drug in its class. Clinical study  results have show n 
that secukinumab achieves higher efficacy  response levels than other drugs historically , 
demonstrating that IL-
17 is a very  effective target for the development of drugs for the 
treatment of psoriasis. 
2.2 Bimekizumab

moderate plaque psoriasis, RA0124 in 30 healthy  volunteers, and PA0007 in 53 subjects with 
psoriatic arthritis. Two studies (RA0123 and UP0031) are ongoing in subjects with moderate to 
severe rheumatoid arthritis and in healthy  subjects, respectivel y. 
UP0008 was a Phase 1, single ascending dose study  in adults with mild to mod erate psoriasis 
affecting ≤5% BSA. In this blinded study , single doses of up to 640mg (approximately  8mg/kg 
in an 80kg adult) were evaluated without an y safety concerns. A total of 26 subjects with 
psoriasis with less than 5% of bod y surface involvement were treated with a range of single iv 
doses from 8 to 640mg. There were no clinicall y relevant safet y findings identified at an y dose 
and all doses were well tolerated. The pre -specified exploratory  assessment of disease activity  
showed clinicall y relevan t and statistically  significant improvements at the higher doses studied.
RA0124 was a Phase 1, open -label, parallel -group, single -dose study  in healthy  subjects. The 
primary  objective of this study  was to determine the absolute bioavailability  of single s c doses of 
bimekizumab (80mg and 160mg). The secondary objectives were to evaluate the dose 
proportionality  of bimekizumab 80mg and 160mg sc, and to evaluate the safety  and tolerability  
of these sc doses and 160mg given b y iv infusion. In RA0124, the absol ute bioavailability  was 
similar for the 2 doses tested (0.656 and 0.631 for the bimekizumab 80mg and 160mg sc doses, 
respectivel y). The PK of bimekizumab was linear in the tested dose range and the median t 1/2
following sc administration was similar to tha t following iv admin istration (27.81 days and 
28.25 days for bimekizumab 160mg sc and 160mg iv, respectivel y).  
Bimekizumab has also been investigated in a Phase 1b, proof of concept, randomized, 
placebo- controlled, multiple dose study  (PA0007). The prima ry objective of PA0007 was to 
assess the safety  and PK of multiple dose administration of iv bimekizumab in subjects with 
psoriatic arthritis. Four active doses and a placebo were tested. Drug was adminis tered as a 
loading dose at Week 0, and 2 additional doses were administered at Week 3 and Week 6. In 
each treatment group, subjects received a total of 3 doses of bimekizumab, administered every  
3weeks as shown below:
80mg loading dose followed b y 40mg at Weeks 3 and 6
160mg loading dose followed b y 80mg a t Weeks 3 and 6
240mg loading dose followed b y 160 mg at Weeks 3 and 6

there were no unexpected clinically  relevant safety  findings. 
Infections (mostly  nasophary ngitis) were the most commonly  reported events in both the active 
treatment and the placebo group. None of the infections were considered serious or required 
treatment with antibiotics. Two subjects in t he active treatment group experienced 1 local 
candida infection each (oropharh yngitis and vulvovaginitis, respectivel y) that were nonserious 
and resolved with topi[INVESTIGATOR_52201] y. There was a reduction in mean neutrophil count in the active 
treatment group, al though this drop was not clinically  relevant and a clear relationship with dose 
or time was not evident. Some increases in liver function tests were reported, but none had a 
convincing relationship to exposure to study  medication. The exploratory  analy sis showed 
clinically  relevant improvement in activity  of psoriatic arthritis and in skin involvement in those 
subjects with concomitant active psoriatic lesions.
Two additional studies of bimekizumab areongoin g. RA0123 is a Phase 2a, double -blind,

pharmacod ynamics , and efficacy  of multiple doses of bimekizumab administered as add -on 
therap y to stable certolizumab pegol therap y in subjects with moderate to severe rheumato id 
arthritis. UP0031 is a Phase 1 open- label, parallel -group, single -dose study to evaluate the 
relative bioav ailabilit y and tolerability of bimekizumab 160mg sc in healthy subjects.

The rationale for the selection of the 160mg Q4W dose for this study  isbased on the following : 
The optimal therapeutic dose of bimekizumab will not yet be known at the time subjects 
begin entering PS0018 from PS001 6.
The160mg Q4W dose iswithin the range of doses that have alread y been explored by  [CONTACT_417705]. This dose was selected based on modeling using the currently  available data 
and may  be modified, if appropriate, as further data are collect ed on the optimal dose of 
bimekizumab.
The 160mg Q4W starting dose in PS0018 will provide data to evaluate the safet y and 
efficacy  of a dose reduction

Subjects with potential drug -induced liver injury (PDILI )must be assessed to determine if 
investigational medicinal product (IMP) must be discontinued. I n addition, all conco mitant 
medications and herbal supplements that are not medically  necessary  should also be 
discontinued. 
The PDILI criteria below require immediate and permanent discontinuation of IMP: 
Subjects with either of the following:
ALT or AST ≥ 5xUL N
ALT or AST ≥3xUL N and coexisting total bilirubin ≥2xUL N 
Subjects with AL T or AST ≥3xULN who exhibit temporally  associated s ymptoms of 
hepatitis or hy persensitivity . Hepatitis sy mptoms include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right 
upper quadrant pain or tendern ess. Hy persensitivity  symptoms include fever (without clear 
alternative cause), rash, or eosinophilia (ie, >5%).
The PDILI criterion below allows for subjects to continue on IMP at the discretion of the 
Investigator. 
Subjects with AL T or AST ≥3xULN (and ≥2x baseline) and <5xULN, total bilirubin 
<2xUL N, and no eosinophilia (ie, ≤5%), with no fever, rash , or s ymptoms of hepatitis 
(eg,fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness).
Evaluation of PDILI must be initiated as described in Se
ction 9.7.1. I f subjects are unable to 
comply  with the applicable monitoring schedule, IMP must be discontinued immediately .
Investigators should att empt to obtain information on subjects in the case of IMP discontinuation 
to complete the final evaluation. Subjects with PDILI should not be withdrawn from the study  
until investigation and monitoring are complete. All results of these evaluations and 
observations, as well as the reason(s) for IMP discontinuation and subject withdrawal (if 
applicable), must be recorded in the source documents. The eCRF must document the primary  
reason for IMP discontinuation.

list of procedures to be completed at each visit is provided in the sections that follow. 
Visit windows of ±
3days on either side of the scheduled dosing are permitted for all visits 
other than the SFU Visit (see below) ; however, the Investigator should try  to keep the 
subjects on the original dosing schedule. The window of ± 3daysis relative to the first dose 
(Basel ine) and applicable for all subsequent visits. Changes to the dosing schedule outside of 
the 3- day window must be discussed with the Medical Monitor.
The minimum time between doses should be no less than 24 day s and no more than 32 days 
forQ4W dosing .
Forthe SFU Visit ( 20weeks after the last dose), the visit should occur no more than 3 days
prior to the sc heduled visit date and within 7 days after the scheduled visit date 
(-3days/+7days).

(Important medical events may  include, but are not limited to, potential Hy ’s Law [see 
Section 9.5], allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dy scrasias that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of 
drug dependency  or drug abuse.)
Initial inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]
(A patient admitted to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], even if he/she is released o n the same day , meets the

Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_417691] [eg, preplanned 
surgery  or elective surgery  for a pre -
existing condition that has not worsened or manifested

for this condition, it is not appropriate to record the surgery or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18256], 
since there is no AE upon which to assess the serious criteria. Please not e that, if the 
pre-existing condition has worsened or manifested in an unusual or uncharacteristic manner,

9.6 Adverse events for special monitoring
UCB has identified AEs for special monitoring (AESM). An AESM is an AE or safet y topic for 
which special monitoring, additional data collection activities, and/or enhanced signal detection 
activities (within UCB), are considered appropriate. Identified AESM can be of particular 
interest based on findings from the IMP clinical program to date, potential risks generall y 
associated with biologic immunomodulators, or comorbidities and risk factors prevalent in the 
study  population.
Adverse events for special monitoring for this study  include: serious infections (i ncluding 
opportunistic infections and TB ;see Section 9.8.1), cy topenias, hy persensitivities, suicide 
ideation or behavior (assessed using the C

of their occurrence. An y PDILI eve nt that meets the criterion for potential Hy ’s Law must be 
reported as an AE of special interest (see Section 9.5 ), and, if applicable, also reported as an SAE 
(see Section 9.2.1). 
Evaluation of PDILI consists of the diagnostic testing and continued monitoring included in 
Table 9-3(specific tests dependent on laboratory  results and corresponding s ymptoms) and 
consultation with a local hepatologist (if applicable; discus sed in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]
). The local 
hepatologist is the expert usually  consulted b y the treating ph ysician for assessment and 
management of potential hepatic disease. This would usually be a hepatologist, but may  be a 
gastroenterologist. Additional investigation and monitoring may  be required and adapted based 
on the diagnosis after the cause of the liver injury /abnormality  is confirmed (details in 
Section9.7.1.4 ). 
The results of all monitoring, including laboratory  testing and other testing, should be made 
available to the stud y site and Sponsor.
All initial tests resulting in abnormal hepatic laboratory  values need to be repeated, but 
appropriate medical action must not be delayed waiting for the repeat result.
If tests are done locall y for more rapid results, a concurrent sample should also be sent to the 
central laboratory  whenever possible. Medical care decisions are to be made initially  using the

When I MP is discontinued, all concomitant medications and herbal supplements that are not 
medically  necessary  should also be discontinued. In these cases, the Investi gator should also 
consider dose reduction for medicall y necessary concomitant medication and consider changing 
any medicall y required concomitant medication known to be hepatotoxic to a suitable 
alternative.
When I MP is stopped due to PDILI (as described i n Section 6.3.1), I MP must be permanentl y 
discontinued even if 
a subsequent alternative diagnosis fully  explains the hepatic findings. 
Rechallenge with a substance potentiall y causing drug -induced liver injury is dangerous, may  be

Potential drug -induced liver injury  events require notification of the Medical Monitor within 
24hours (eg, b y laboratory alert), and the subject must be discussed with the Medical Monitor as 
soon a s possible. If required, the subject must also be discussed with the local hepatologist. The 
local hepatologist is the expert usually  consulted by  [CONTACT_271394]. This would usually be a he patologist, but may  be a 
gastroenterologist. If determined necessary , this discussion should be followed by  a full 
hepatology  assessment (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) and SAE report (if applicable).
[IP_ADDRESS] Immediate action: determination of IMP discontinuation
All PDILI events require immediate action, testing, and monitoring. 
The immediate action is dependent on the laboratory  values and s ymptoms of hepatitis or 
hypersensitivity  and ranges from continuation of IMP (followed by  [CONTACT_58984]) to 
immediate and permanent discontinuation (see Section 6.3.1 and Table 9-3for details).
When I MP is discontinued, all concomitant medications and herbal supplements that are not 
medically  necessary  should also be discontinued. The I
nvestigator should also consider dose 
reduction for medicall y necessary  concomitant medication and consider changing an y medicall y 
required concomitant medication known to be hepatotoxic to a suitable alternative.

specified withdrawal procedures. Laboratory  diagnosis should be undertaken via my cobacteria 
culture media (or if available by  [CONTACT_417719]) and the result must be negative for TB inducing pathogens.
Test Conversion
Tuberculosis test conversion is defined as a positive IGRA result for the current test whe n 
previous IGRA test results were negative. All subjects with TB test conversion must immediately  
stop study  drug administration. I n case of a TB test conversion, the subject must be considered as 
having either a suspected new latent or an active TB infect ion and be promptly  referred to an 
appropriate specialist (eg, pulmonologist, infectious disease specialist) for further evaluation. If 
test conversion indicates LTB infection , active TB, or NTMB then, per UCB TB working 
instructions, TB test conversion (c onfirmed) should be classified adequately , either as due to 
LTB infection , active TB infection, or NTMB, respectivel y. Additional assessme nts (eg, blood 
tests or IGRA, chest x -rays, or other imaging) should be performed where medically  relevant and 
documented. Such conversions should be reported to the UCB PSfunction.

LTB infection and active TB identified during study
During the study , subjects who develop evidence of L TB infection or active TB must 
immediately  stop further administration of study  medication and will be referred to an 
appropriate TB specialist (pulmonologist or infectious disease specialist) for further evaluation. 
Evidence of LTB infection is defined as the subject’s IGRA test converts to positive or 
indeterminate (and confirmed indeterminate on repeat), or the subject’s questionnaire or history  
and phy sical indicates that TB infection or exposure may  have occurred. Evidence of active TB 
includes, in addition to the aforementioned tests, signs and s ymptoms of organ involvement. In 
either situation, the subject should be carefull y assessed by  a TB specialist for active TB. 
Subjects diagnosed with active TB or LTB infection should be withdrawn from the study  and 
receive appropriate TB or proph ylaxis therapy . 
Any presumptive diagnosis or diagnosis of a TB infection is a reportable eve nt. Confirmed active 
TB must be reported as an SAE. The Investigator is to complete and submit the TB follow up 
form provided.
The subject should be transferred to the care of his/her physician and managed according to the 
best available standard of care. Subjects identified as having converted to active TB during the 
study  must be withdrawn and scheduled to return for the Week 48/W ithdrawal Visit as soon as 
possible ,but no later than the next scheduled study visit ,and complete all Week 48/Withdrawal 
Visit assessments.

Clinical Study Protocol Bimekizumab PS0018
Confidential Page 62of 78Adverse events will be coded according to the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities 
(MedDRA®). Treatment -emergent AEs will be defined as events that have a start date on or 
following the first administration of study  treatment in PS 0018 through the final administration 
of study  treatment + 140days (covering the 20-week SFU P eriod). Treatment- emergent AEs will 
be categorized to treatment group based on the dose being received at the time of onset of the 
event. Tables will include columns for bimekizumab 320mg Q4W, bimekizumab 160mg Q4W, 
and All bimekizumab (ie, either dose of bimekizumab). 
Change from Baseline 
safety  variables will be defined relative to the Baseline measurement from 
PS001 6.
14.2.1 Primary  safety analysis
All TEAEs will be summarized descriptivel y by [CONTACT_1570], primary system organ class 
(SOC), high level term (HL T), and prefer red term (PT). This summary  will include the exposure 
adjusted incidence rate (EAI R) with associated 95% confidence interval and the exposure 
adjusted event rate (EAER). 
For EAI R, the numerator will be the total number of subjects experiencing the AE. The
denominator will be [ADDRESS_527024] -years; that is, the total summation of individual subject -years at 
risk up to the first occurrence of the AE for subjects with that AE, and the total subject -years at 
risk for those subjects not experiencing that AE, divide d by 100. Exposure adjusted incidence 
rates will be presented with a 95% exact confide nce interval based upon the Chi -Square 
distribution (Ulm, 1990). 
For EAERs, the numerator will be the number of AEs including repeat occurrences in individual 
subjects; the denominator will be [ADDRESS_527025] administration o f study  medication 
–date of first administration of study  medication + 140days (ie, the duration of the SFU P eriod). 
If a subject dies, patient exposure at risk is censored at the date of death. The sum of these 
exposure day
s at risk across subjects is co nverted to y ears for the EAIR and EAER calculations 
described above.
14.2.[ADDRESS_527026] 
to dose adjustments, subjects will be class ified into 1 of the following 3 groups:
Nonadjusters – This group consists of subjects who do not experience a dose adjustment 
during the stud y.
Single adjusters – This group consists of subjects who experience just one dose adjustment 
during the stud y. Per the protocol, if just a single adjustment occurs, then that adjustment 
must be to go from bimekizumab 160mg Q4W to 320mg Q4 W.
Multiple adjusters – This group consists of subjects who experience more than [ADDRESS_527027] back to 160mg  Q4W (with 
further dose adjustments possible).
Summaries based on these 3 groups will be done by  [INVESTIGATOR_58027]0016 randomized treatment group for the 
TEAE overview, incidence of TEAEs (b y SOC, HLT, and PT), and incidence of treatment -
emergent SAEs.
Extent of exposure to study  medication in PS [ADDRESS_527028] of dose adjustments on efficacy  results .
Responder efficacy  variables ( PASI 50, PAS I75, PASI 90, PASI1 00, IGA score of 0 or 1, and 
HADS normal scores ) will be summarized descriptively  using counts and percentages b y 
scheduled visit and PS0016 randomized treatment group and overall. The PASI  responder 
variables are derived relative to the PS001 6Baseline. Missing data will be handled b y using 
nonresponder imputation (NRI), meaning that subjects that discontinue early or who have 
missing data at a given time point are imputed as though they did not achieve the given response. 
Supportive summ aries will be based on observed case data.
Continuous efficacy  variables based on the change from Baseline (PASI , BSA, and HADS ) will 
be summarized using descriptive statistics by  [CONTACT_417723]0016 randomized treatment 
group and overall. The table presentations will display  descriptive statistics for the PS001 6
Baseline and the observed and change from PS0016 Baseline results by  [CONTACT_417724]0018. Figures for selected variables will also be generated in order to demonstrate the kinetics 
ofresponse over time. Missing data will be handled by  [CONTACT_326491] (MI) via the

6.4 Stud y stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_417688] , planned dosing and procedures may  be discontinued or suspended for all 
subjects in any  part of the study  and appropriate follow up procedures established. Where it is 
possible to do so without threatening the safety of subjects, such discontinuation/suspension 
should be discussed with the UCB Study  Physician prior to its implementation.
Possible reasons for discontinuation or suspension of the study  include (but are not limited to):
A pattern of AEs occurs that contraindicates the further dosing of enrolled / additional 
subjects, including (but not limited to):
More than [ADDRESS_527037] meets any  individual Withdrawal Criteria 6, 9, 10, 11 or 12 (as 
provided in Section 6.3), regardless of whether they  met the same or different criteria.
Once a second subject meets an
y of those criteria, referral to the DMC may not be 
delay ed while awaiting the outcome of either case.
If the above criteria are reached, the DMC will meet as soon as possible to determine 
whether discontinuation or suspension of the study should occur, and to determine what 
investigations, anal yses, procedural amendments, or other actions should occur, bef ore 
making an y recommendation regarding the possibility  of recommencing the study .  Further 
details on the role of the DMC are provided in Section 9.8.7. 
If the Sponsor or its designees judges it necessary for medical, safet y, regulatory , or any

Negative Pressure Wound Therapy in Obese Patients  Undergoing Laparotomy:  A Randomized Study   
 
 
Synopsis  
Overview:  
Most gynecologic  and many intra -abdominal  malignancies are treated with an initial surgical procedure.  
Over the past [ADDRESS_514154] (35.7%) of US adults being obese (BMI  > 30kg/m2) or morbidly obese (BMI>35 kg/m2).  There is a 
direct link between obesity and wound complications following surgery with an increasing BMI leading 
to increasing rates of complications.  Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a system that utilizes sub-atmospheric pressure to improve wo und healing by [CONTACT_407616].  
NPWT has been shown to improve outcomes in both the orthopedic and cardiothoracic surgery 
populations.  To date, there is no prospective study evaluating the application of prophylactic NPWT i n 
laparotomy patients.   
  
Primary Objective:  
To evaluate the rate of wound complications with negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) as compared 
to standard surgical closure and post -operative wound care in obese patients (BMI ≥35 kg/m
2) undergoing 
laparotomy for  a suspected gynecologic malignancy  or other abdominal cancer.    
 Secondary Objective:  
To compare the time between surgery and the start of anti -cancer therapy (chemotherapy and/or radiation 
therapy) between those patients diagnosed with a malignancy who received NPWT and those who 
received standard surgical closure 
 
Patient Population: 
Morbidly o bese (BMI ≥ 35  kg/m
2) adult patients presenting for surgical treatment of a known or 
suspected gynecologic malignancy or other abdominal  cancer by [CONTACT_407617]:

Negative Pressure Wound Therapy in Obese Patients  Undergoing Laparotomy:  A Randomized Study   
 
1.0 Introduction and Overview  
Up to 90% of type I (estrogen -dependent) endometrial cancer patients are obese1 and 
obesity is considered a risk factor for both endometrial and ovarian cancers2.   Most 
gynecologic malignancies are treated with an initial surgical procedure.  A number of 
colorectal diseases are also increased with obesity including diverticular dise ase and 
colorectal cancer15,16, 17.  A central challenge for surgeons is the increase in the rates of 
wound complications following surgery given the rise in obesity.  The rate of wound complications for gynecologic oncology procedures is 34% overall and is highly correlated with BMI
4.  Patients with a BMI of ≥40 kg/m2 had a 10 fold increase in the 
risk of wound complications compared to normal weighted patients6.  Some patients are 
able to circumvent this problem with a minimally invasive approach to their surgery; however, obesity increases the risk of conversion to an open procedure.  Wound complications are not only distressing to patients but can also delay necessary adjuvant therapy such as chemotherapy and radiation.     Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a system that utilizes sub -atmospheric 
pressure to improve wound healing by [CONTACT_407616].  The mechanism for this improved wound healing is thought to be increased local blood 
flow, mechanical stress at the wound surface, removal of factors that inhibit wound healing and decreased bacterial burden.  To date there are good data to show the benefit 
of using NPWT  to trea t wound complications that arise post -operatively.  In the 
orthopedic and cardiothoracic surgery literature there is evidence to suggest that prophylactic NPWT placed over a closed incision decreases wound dehiscence and infection rate, with a 40% decrease in orthopedic patients and 4-fold decrease in morbidly obese cardiothoracic patients.  However, to date, there is no prospective study evaluating the application of prophylactic NPWT in laparotomy patients.  
 
2.0 Study Objective s 
The primary goal of this study is to evaluate if the use of prophylactic negative pressure 
wound therapy (NPWT ) over a closed incision  improves postoperative outcomes and 
cancer care for morbidly obese  (BMI ≥35  kg/m2) patients undergoing laparotomy for 
treatment of a suspected gynecologic or other abdominal malignancy is comparable or 
better to wound healing after standard surgical closure and wound care.    This comparison will be achieved by: 
• Assessing the incidence of wound complications, specifically, dehiscence and 
infectio n at the [ADDRESS_514156]-operative visit (10-14 days after surgery) 
• documenting the time from surgery to the start of anti- cancer treatment  in a 
subset of patients receiving a cancer diagnosis by [CONTACT_407618] 
3 months  after surgery

Negative Pressure Wound Therapy in Obese Patients  Undergoing Laparotomy:  A Randomized Study   
 
3.0 Background and Significance  
The obesity epi[INVESTIGATOR_362680] a growing problem in the US and its effects are felt very heavily 
on the gynecologic oncology population.  Both endometrial and ovarian cancers are increased in the obese populations
1,2, and the majority of  gynecologic malignancies are 
initially treated with a surgical procedure.  A number of colorectal diseases are also 
increased with obesity including diverticular disease and colorectal cancer15,16, 17.  Risks  
and complications of surgery are much greater in the obese population.  The reported rate of wound complications in the gynecologic oncology population is 34 -40% depending on 
the location
4.  Wound complications are highly correlated with patient BMI.  These 
wound complications can lead to a delay in necessary adjuvant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_407610].  It is  known that delays in the initiation of adjuvant therapy 
can have a negative impact on survival.   
 NPWT is a system that uses sub -atmospheric pressure to alter the physiologic and 
chemi cal environment of the wound bed.  It is postulated that this works through several 
different mechanisms including increased local blood flow, increased mechanical stress leading to increases in cellular proliferation, more effective removal of factors tha t inhibit 
wound healing including bacteria and fluid
7,8.  Studies using NPWT in an open 
laparotomy incision to facilitate  healing by [CONTACT_407619]10.  However, t o date, there are few studies evaluating the 
use of prophylactic NPWT over a closed incision, and most of the existing data is in the 
orthopedic and cardiothoracic surgery literature.  The use of prophylactic NPWT over orthopedic wounds has been shown to decrease wound dehiscence and infection rates by 40%, and has decreased the rate of wound complications 4- fold in obese patients 
undergoing cardiothoracic surgery
12,13.  However, it is unclear if this same benefit will be 
seen with abdominal laparotomy incisions.   
4.0 Wound Complications at the University Of Minnesota  
We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 who 
have undergone a laparotomy for a known or suspected gynecologic malignancy at our 
institution in the past 6 months.  We found that of 51 obes e patients to undergo a 
laparotomy, 13 (25%) had some form of wound complication, either a wound dehiscence 
or infection.  This is on par with what is reported in the literature .  Further, [ADDRESS_514157] 10%.  The results of this chart review 
were used to inform our sample size calculations.  
  
5.0 Research Design  
This is a randomized controlled trial in which eligible patients will be randomized to either a control or intervention group.  All patients undergoing laparotomy for a known or 
suspected gynecologic or other abdominal cancer will be approached for eligibility.  
Once all eligibility criteria are m et, the patient will be consented both with verbal and 
    
December 9 , 2013 Page 6 of 16 CPRC #2013NTLS073 
Negative Pressure Wound Therapy in Obese Patients  Undergoing Laparotomy:  A Randomized Study   
 
written consent procedures.  Following consent the patient will be randomized to either :  
1) routine closure of the surgical site  (control arm); or 2) closure of the wound with a 
prophylactic NPWT placed over the closed surgical incision.  The standard surgical 
closure consists of closure of the fascia with a looped PDS suture in a running fashion  
either with the use of a mass closure technique or a Smead Jones closure at the discretion 
of the operating surgeon , closure of the subcutaneous space if >[ADDRESS_514158] -operatively.  This will also allow for 
standardized evaluation of the patient’s wound to determine if there have been any wound complications since their surgery.  Patients will be followed for the development 
of any wound complications including infection, dehiscence a nd evisceration  for 4 weeks  
after surgery .  For patients who develop a wound complication, we will  track required 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including readmission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , reoperation, antibiotic therapy, wound 
opening with healing by [CONTACT_129108], including method of wound care and duration of wound healing.  For patients requiring adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy and/or radiation), we will record duration from time of surgery to initiation of adjuvant therapy.  
 
6.0 Patient Selection

8.2.[ADDRESS_514162] of care group will be 
used for patients randomized to prophylactic placement of the Prevena™ Incision 
Management System .  As in the previous section it consists of closure of the 
fascia with a looped PDS suture in a running fashion either in with the use of a 
mass closure technique or a Smead Jones closure at the discretion of the operating surgeon, closure of the subcutaneous space if >2 cm deep, followed by [CONTACT_407620].    The Prevena™ Incision Management System will be placed over th e closed 
incision.  It will be removed on post -operative day 2 or 3 as clinically indicated 
and prior to the patient ’s discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].   
8.[ADDRESS_514163] of care will be no different than 
undergoing the same surgical procedure without participating in this study.  
8.3.2 Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NWPT)  
NPWT has very few complications associated with its use.  There are few repor ts 
of fistula development with the use of NPWT but these are in patients where the 
NPWT has been placed directly over intestines and not on a closed incision.  Additionally, NPWT is widely used in treatment of an open wound, and placed 
directly over the fascia with few reported complications. When large amounts of fluid are removed from an incision large fluid losses can lead to hemodynamic changes in patients; however, it is anticipated that this fluid loss would be much 
greater in an open wound ( NPWT  is placed directly over the fascia and within the 
subcutaneous tissue) than over a closed wound.  Fluid status will be followed 
closely and managed per the standard postoperative protocol .   
 There are also some less serious complications such as local cutaneous reactions 
(rash, redness, pruritis, urticarial), allergic reaction, maceration, minor soft tissue 
damage, skin strippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], minor bleeding, pain, bruising. All patients will be 
monitored closely for signs of skin irritation and will be treated appropriately with 
barrier creams as needed. In cases where NPWT is used to aid in healing by 
[CONTACT_129108], the NPWT is in place for weeks to months with minimal skin irritation; it is anticipated that this risk of irritation will be even lower when the NPWT device is in place for only 2-3 days.  There are some other uncommon risks associated with the NPWT including,  
    
December 9 , 2013 Page 9 of 16 CPRC #2013NTLS073 
Negative Pressure Wound Therapy in Obese Patients  Undergoing Laparotomy:  A Randomized Study   
 
bleeding complications (associated with the surgical procedure, concomitant 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_407611] - -morbidities), first degree burn (if device gets warm), exposure 
related infection,  localized infection, physical discomfort, minor desiccation (due 
to dressing leak), moderate soft tissue damage (i.e. due to trip hazard, tubing 
entanglement) and  deterioration of the wound (due to lack of visibility of incision 
site through dressing.  
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_514164]- Operative Care 
There is a small risk of loss of confidentiality; however steps will be taken to 
minimize this by [CONTACT_407621] a unique patient identifier at the time of 
study enrollment  to be used in place of direct identifiers .  A master list will be 
kept in O nCore , the Cancer Center’s password protected clinical database that 
resides on the University of Minnesota serve r.

wound care assignment per institutional guidelines, including those for infection control.   
8.5 Duration of Study Participation 
It is expected the duration of study participation will be less than 2 months. 
 
All patients will be assessed for wound complications (including infection, 
dehiscence and evisceration ) at their [ADDRESS_514166]- operative visit  approximately 10-14 
days after surgery .   
 Patients will  continue to be tracked for wound complications for a minim um of 4 
weeks after surgery by [CONTACT_407622]/medical records.  For patients who develop a wound complication, the type of complication, treatment received and 
outcomes will be captured.  For patients  with a cancer diagnosis that requires  anti- cancer  therapy 
(chemotherapy and/or radiation ), the therapy start date of therapy will be 
recorded.

10.0 Statistical Considerations  
10.1 Data Analysis 
The patient population demographics will be descriptively summarized both 
combined and by [CONTACT_407626].  All analyses will be conducted under the intention -to-treat principle and all deviations and adverse events will be 
reported.   Our primary  aim is to compare rate of wound complications (wound dehiscence 
or infection) identified within first month after surgery by [CONTACT_1570] (standard of care or NPWT).  As this is a large randomized trial, the comparison 
will first be made using a Chi- squared test as we an ticipate approximate balance 
in all measured and unmeasured confounders.  These results will be supplemented using logistic regression, including demographics and clinical variables (including surgeon) as appropriate.    Our secondary aim is compare the ti me from surgery to starting adjuvant therapy 
among those with confirmed malignancies .  This will be measured in days and 
will be available regardless if patients undergo treatment at our study facilities as their surgeon will manage their care and maintain  contact [CONTACT_8622] [ADDRESS_514168] of NPWT  on the length of the number 
of days until treatment will be  assessed using Poisson regression, adjusting for 
over-dispersion if necessary .  As stated above, we will supplement these results 
adjusting for demographic and clinical variables as appropriate.       For all analyses, p -values of less than 0.05 will be considered statistically 
significant and will be performed using SAS software version 9.3 (Cary, NC).   
 
10.2 Sample Size Calc ulations  
As stated in the Section 4, we retrospective chart review of this patient population found 25% rate of wound complications. Group sizes of 97 each (194 total) achieves 80% power to detect a difference between the group proportions of -
0.15; in other words, assuming the standard of care group has a complication rate of 25%, we could detect a complication rate in the NPWT group of 10% as being statistically significantly lower using a two -sized Z -test with a significance level 
of 0.05.  This represents a clinically significant change in complication rates while remaining a feasible number to recruit within the study sites.  Our proposed sample size is therefore 200 (100 in each group). 
 
The secondary aim  is not to formally test hypotheses but rather to describe this 
outcome and calculate preliminary estimates of differences.  Among women undergoing this procedure at our study sites, approximately 70% will be 
    
December 9 , 2013 Page 12 of 16 CPRC #2013NTLS073 
Negative Pressure Wound Therapy in Obese Patients  Undergoing Laparotomy:  A Randomized Study   
 
diagnosed with a malignancy, resulting in a sample size of [ADDRESS_514169] of care group, we anticipate they will begin 
adjuvant therapy within 4- 6 weeks after surgery.  This sample size is more than 
sufficient (>90% power) to detect a difference of [ADDRESS_514170] of the Trial  
The study will be conducted in accordance with the appropriate local regulatory 
requirement(s).   
The University Of Minnesota  IRB will review all appropriate s tudy 
documentation in order to safeguard the rights, safety and well -being of the 
patients.  The study will only be conducted at sites where IRB or Campus Administrator approval has been obtained.  The protocol, consent  document , 
written information given to the patients, annual progress reports, and any revisions to these documents will be provided to the IRB by [CONTACT_093].   
Essential clinical documents will be maintained to demonstrate the validity of the 
study and the integrity of the data collect ed.  Master files should be established at 
the beginning of the study, maintained for the duration of the study and retained for a minimum of [ADDRESS_514171] access to the data.  
11.3 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
This is a minimal  risk, non -therapeutic study.    
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_407613]’s Data Monitoring Plan to be reviewed by [CONTACT_407627]. These reports will focus on recruitment, retention, losses to follow -up, and adherence to protocol. Although 
the safety concerns for this project are expected to be minimal, repo rts will 
include a section on reports of adverse events that may be related to the study 
procedures.   
11.4 Event Reporting to the IRB and Cancer Center’s Data and Safety 
Monitoring Council (DSMC ) 
Safety  concerns for this project are expected to be minimal  with skin irritation  as 
the primary expected concern.   Any events meeting an unexpected, serious

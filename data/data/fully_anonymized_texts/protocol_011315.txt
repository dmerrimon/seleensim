The original grant was submitted to the IRB 11/15/2017 but the final version 
of the IRB approval for the study was 1/17/2018.  When this study was 
initially reviewed by [CONTACT_473071], a separate 
protocol with the statistical analysis was not required.  It is now.  Sadly, this 
is the only way I can provide both documents.

VCU TBIMS Proposal 
Nonexempt Research Narrative 
 1 HUMAN SUBJECTS NONEXEMPT RESEARCH NARRATIVE (FORM 424) 
  
The VCU TBIMS proposal includes data collecti on from human subjects for three studies: 
1. Data collection for the NIDILRR-funded TBIMS National Database 
2. Intervention to Promote Survivor Resilience a nd Adjustment: Efficacy and Sustainability  
3. Caregiver Resilience: A Longitudinal Investigation  
 
Grouped by [CONTACT_473083], are respons es to each question regarding human subjects 
protection. 
 
1. Data collection for the NIDILRR-funded TBIMS National Database 
(1)  Human Subjects Involvement and Charac teristics: Provide a detailed description of the 
proposed involvement of human subjects. Describe the characteristics of the subject population, 
including their anticipated number, age range, and h ealth status. Identify the criteria for inclusion or 
exclusion of any subpopulation. Explain the ra tionale for the involvement of special classes of 
subjects, such as children, children with disabilit ies, adults with disabilities, persons with mental 
disabilities, pregnant women, prisoners, institutionalized individuals, or others who are likely to be 
vulnerable. 
Individuals included in this project will be adults (18 years or older) who have experienced a 
traumatic brain injury (TB I). We expect to enroll approximately 200 new research participants over 
the course of the grant.  TBI often causes physical and mental disabilities. Thus, adults with 
physical and/or mental disabilities will be included.  Pregnant women will also be enrolled, as there 
is no indication o f additional risk to mother or fetus. Individuals in the following special classes 
will not be studied: children, prisoners, and institutionalized individuals.  
 
(2)  Sources of Materials: Identify the sources of re search material obtained from individually living 
human subjects in the form of specimens, records , or data. Indicate whether the material or data will 
be obtained specifically for research purposes or whether use will be made of existing specimens, 
records, or data. 
Research materials will be comprised of data obtained through questionnaires, medical records 
review, interviews, and administ ration of neuropsychological tests.  Information will be obtained 
specifically for the research purposes of the project.  
 
(3)  Recruitment and Informed Consent: Describe plans for the recruitment of subjects and the 
consent procedures to be followed. Include the ci rcumstances under which consent will be sought 
and obtained, who will seek it, the nature of the information to be provided to prospective subjects, 
and the method of documenting consent. State if  the Institutional Review Board (IRB) has 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
Nonexempt Research Narrative 
 2 authorized a modification or waiver of th e elements of consent or the requirement for 
documentation of consent. 
Participants will be solicited from inpatient ad missions to the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Unit at 
the Virginia Commonwealth University Health System (VCUHS).  Patients will be approached by 
[CONTACT_473084], M.A. (TBIMS Project Coordinator) or Daniel Klyce , Ph.D. (the Brain Injury 
Rehabilitation Unit’s neurop sychologist). A description of the project will be provided to patients. 
If the patient is interested in participating, [CONTACT_473212] or [CONTACT_473213] will review the nature of the 
research (completion of questionnaires and neuropsychological testing).  The conse nt form will be 
carefully reviewed with the patient and written consent obtained.  [CONTACT_473212] and [CONTACT_473213] will 
emphasize that participation is voluntary and the patien t’s decision to participate will not affect the 
quality of their medical care.   
In any case where the investigator has concerns about  the patient’s ability to provide informed 
consent, formal assessment of decision-making capacity will be made using the MacArthur 
Competence Assessment Tool, Clinical Research version (MacCAT -CR). As allowed under 
Virginia state law, an alternative procedure will be used to consent persons lacking the capacity to 
give informed consent, as determined by [CONTACT_473085]-CR, or as judged by [CONTACT_473]. 
Investigators will seek to obtain consent from a legally des ignated substitute decision maker. In 
every case, an effort will be made  to obtain assent from the patient. Patients who decline to 
participate will not be enrolled regardless of their respecti ve substitute decision maker’s desire.   
The consent form was approved for the 2012-[ADDRESS_606289] (IRB) (VCU internal code CCHR Protocol #[ZIP_CODE])  through March 31,

(4) Potential Risks: Describe potential risks (physical,  psychological, social, legal, or other) and 
assess their likelihood and seriousne ss. Where appropriate, describe  alternative treatments and 
procedures that might be advantageous to the subjects. 
There are minimal risks (physical, psychological, social, legal, or other) associated with human 
subjects use for this project.  Some individuals may experience fe elings of sadness or frustration 
when completing the tests.  The only inconvenience to research participant will be the time it takes 
to answer the questionnaires and take the tests.  Questions of a sensitive nature (e.g., substance 
use/abuse, criminal history) are included; however patients are given the option to omit questions

5) Protection Against Risk: Describe the proce dures for protecting against or minimizing potential 
risks, including risks to confidentiality, and asse ss their likely effectiveness. Where appropriate, 
discuss provisions for ensuring necessary medi cal or professional intervention in the event of 
adverse effects to the subjects. Also, where appropriate, describe the provisi ons for monitoring the 
data collected to ensure the safety of the subjects. 
This project is directed by a licensed clinical psychologist ([CONTACT_473214]). In the event 
that a patient is found to have significant psychological problems, [CONTACT_473215] will provide 
individual psychotherapy or refer the patient for further psychiatric intervention.  Confidential ity of 
information will be guaranteed in the database.  No names or social security numbers will be 
included - only identification numbers assigned by  [CONTACT_211224]. The Project 
Coordinator and Research Ass istants will keep any contact [CONTACT_61183]- up purposes 
separate from research data collected.  
 
(6) Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained: Di scuss the importance of the knowledge gained or 
to be gained as a result of the proposed research. Discuss why the risks to subjects are reasonable in 
relation to the anticipated benefits to subjects  and in relation to the importance of the knowledge 
that may reasonably be expected to result. 
The longitudinal National Database is the large st longitudinal database addressing outcomes 
after TBI.  Knowledge gained regarding long- term outcomes is important to better serve persons

[ADDRESS_606296]: 
 
Intervention to Promote Survivor Resilience and Adjustment: Efficacy and Sustainability 
The monitoring of this study will involve a continuous and ongoing process of reviewing the 
conduct of the trial, including adherence to the study design and documentation of AEs/SAEs. The 
responsibility of monitoring the safety of participan ts is held primarily by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kreutzer as Project 
Director and Principal Investigator. Considering that the interventions in this study carry less than 
minimal risk  to participants, and that [CONTACT_473215] a nd his research team have appropriate clinical 
skills and training to monitor for AEs/SAEs, it is appropriate for the research team to carry the 
primary responsibility for monitoring.  
Monitoring the Safety of Participants: As noted  above, a specific protocol will be used to 
monitor for and report AEs/SAEs. The Project Director, in collaboration with the Project 
Coordinator, are primarily responsible for monitoring the safety of participants, in collaboration 
with the study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] ([CONTACT_473218] and [CONTACT_469706], both clinical psychologists), in the following ways: 
 Monitor for Psychological AE (worsening depre ssive symptoms from one assessment time point 
to the next by 5 points on the BSI-18 Depression scale with no endorsement of suicidality): 
o Participants will be provided with the con tact information for the Project Coordinator, 
Project Director, and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. They will be a dvised to call with any questions or concerns 
or to report any unusual emotional feelings; and  
o Research Assistants will be trained in the defi nition of AE (worsening  depressive symptoms 
without endorsement of suicidality) and will report any obvious psychological changes in 
participants to the Project Director immediately. 
 Monitor for Psychological SAE (suicidality): 
o The Project Coordinator will administer the MINI suicide module immediately to assess 
suicidality risk in any of the following situations: 
x a participant reports suicidal thoughts to study staff; and/or, 
x a participant endorses suicidality on the depression scale of the BSI-18 during data 
collection 
o If the suicide risk is low on the MINI (<8), the Project Coordinator will ask the participant to 
be in touch with his/her healthcare provider for follow-up. If the participant scores high for 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
Data & Safety Monitoring Plan 
2 
 suicide risk (9-17), the Project Coordinator will ensure that the participant is accompanied 
by a family member or friend to their healthcare provider or the local emergency department 
for immediate evaluation. The Project Coordinator will consult with [CONTACT_473215] (a clinical 
psychologist) regarding additional questions/concerns. 
In all of the above cases, the Project Director will  determine the severity  of the AE/SAE and the 
relatedness to the intervention. The Project Director will document actions taken and outcomes. If 
any of these events occurs and are directly related to the intervention, the IRB and NIDILRR will be 
alerted. 
Summary of Study Review Plan: Study progress and safety will be reviewed by [CONTACT_473093] a monthly basis, and more frequently if needed. Prog ress reports, including participant 
accrual, participant status and adherence data will be provided regularly to the Project Director. 
Data about AEs/SAEs will be reporte d with each occurrence. As part of the IRB continuing review, 
an Annual Report will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_5829] d and will include a list and su mmary of AEs/SAEs. In addition, 
the Annual Report will address (1) whether AEs/SAEs have been severe and related to the 
intervention; (2) reason for dropouts from the study; (3) whether all participan ts met entry criteria; 
and (4) whether continuation of the study is justifie d on the basis that additional data are needed to 
accomplish the stated aims of the study. 
Validity and Integrity of Data: In collaboration wi th the research team, the Project Director will 
maintain responsibility for all aspects of data collect ion, entry, and analysis. The Project Director 
and study staff will review all data collected on an ongoing basis for completeness and accuracy, as 
well as protocol compliance. The frequency of data review is described below: 
 Participant accrual: Review of the rate of participant accrual and compliance with 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will occur monthly du ring the recruitment phase to ensure that a 
sufficient number of participants are being enro lled and that they meet eligibility criteria. 
 Participant status and Adherence data: Review of the status of enrolled participants will occur on 
a consistent basis throughout the study, including data on adherence to study visits and the 
intervention protocol. If there are concerns about whether adherence has reached a level that 
might inhibit the ability of the study to evaluate  the specific aims, a conference call will be 
scheduled with Scientific Advisors and the Advisory Board to discuss methods for improving 
adherence. 
 AEs and SAEs and rates: Review of every AE and SAE will be closely evaluated by [CONTACT_473094].  
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
 Abstract  
Virginia Commonwealth University’s (VCU) Traumatic Brain Injury Model System (TBIMS) 
proposal is comprised of four majo r components. One component, a s ite-specific research project, is 
a two-arm randomized controlled trial comparing the benefits of a basic resilience-building 
intervention with an expanded, pa tient-centered, resilience interv ention. Outcome measures will 
focus on resilience, emotional distress, adjustment , and stress management. The sustainability of 
treatment benefits will be investigated. A sec ond component is focused on caregivers. The adverse 
impact of TBI on caregivers has been well-doc umented. Reflecting the recent focus on positive 
psychology, we propose to conduct a mu lti-center, longitudinal investigation of caregiver resilience. 
The module will examine caregiver factors associat ed with resilience including emotional well-
being, needs, and perceived burden. Survivor ch aracteristics, includi ng emotional distress, 
functional status, resilience, and injury characteristics, will also be examined. A third major 
component relates to the National Database. VCU will continue to collect data for the National 
Database, and will lead and participate in multi-center, collaborative efforts to examine TBI 
outcomes and prognostic indicators. A fourth compone nt of our proposal rela tes to dissemination. 
VCU will maintain a highly active dissemination pr ogram in collaboration with the Model Systems 
Knowledge Translation Center. As  in the past, VCU’s dissemination efforts will include a high 
volume of peer-reviewed publications and consume r-oriented outreach. In partnership with Brain 
Injury Services and the Nationa l Resource Center for TBI, the VCU TBIMS recently hosted our 41st 
TBI rehabilitation conference in Williamsburg, VA. The conference was the first and remains the 
longest running TBI rehabilitation conference in  the world. The conference planning committee will 
continue to include research and researchers from other TBIMS sites in planning the next five years 
of conferences.  
 
VCU has been a major provider of brain injury acut e care and inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation 
services to a large, culturally diverse population for more than three decades. VCU Medical Center 
provides nearly one-third of Virginia ’s indigent care and is the larg est provider of indigent care in 
the state. Uninsured patients re present [ADDRESS_606297]: extended our system of care; developed 
new partnerships with service providers and advocacy organizations; improved outcome 
measurement techniques; and successfully developed innovative interventions. Consumer 
involvement, emphasis on community-based rehabili tation, relevance, and active dissemination to 
consumer and professional audiences have b een cornerstones of program development and 
implementation. The nearly [ADDRESS_606298] 30 years substantiates assertions that the urban, academic health center 
setting is ideal for scientific research , innovation, collaborati on, and dissemination. 
 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
1 I.  Importance of the Problem 
Need and Target Population 
With an estimated annual incidence rate of 1.7 million,1 traumatic brain injury (TBI) continues 
to be a leading cause of death a nd disability in the [LOCATION_002].2 Each year, TBI results in 2.5 
million visits to the emergency department (ED).[ADDRESS_606299] of all injury d eaths in the U.S. are due 
to TBI,4 and there are 3.2 to 5.3 million persons,5 or ~1.1% of U.S. population living with 
permanent TBI-related disabilities.6 The societal toll of TBI is enormous and growing. Since 2007, 
there has been a 56% increase in th e rate of TBI-related ED visits.[ADDRESS_606300] financial 
costs near $76.[ADDRESS_606301] five different areas, including: (1) functional 
status;20-23 (2) neurological and medical status;24-27 (3) neurobehavioral and emotional status;16,28-30 
(4) familial and marital adjustment;31-34 and (5) vocational status.35-[ADDRESS_606302] of TBI survivors remain dependent for everyday activities and 
12% are institutionalized.[ADDRESS_606303] often contend with 
poorer health, including hastened  neurodegenerative processes and increased risk for Parkinson’s 
disease and Lewy body accumulation.38 Emotional adjustment following TBI is fraught with high 
rates of depression (25-53%),39-41 anxiety (21%),42 and suicidal ideation (7-10%).39 Return to work 
after TBI is suboptimal, with more than 60% of  working age individuals being unemployed two 
years after completing rehabilitation.[ADDRESS_606304] diminished the 
insurance industry’s willingne ss to provide reimbursement.58,[ADDRESS_606305] pursued systematic, long-term research plans.  
Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) researchers have been immersed in TBI 
rehabilitation research for nearly three decades. Our earliest studies were descriptive, focusing on 
cognitive and neurobehavioral functioning, emo tional adjustment, employment, and family 
functioning (see VCU Model Systems Publications, Appendix F). Our more recent research, 
involving development and evaluation of psychological  interventions for survivors and families, has 
produced promising results. Studies have yielde d evidence of improved: (1) problem solving, 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
3 communication, and goal setting skil ls; (2) emotional well-being and stress management; and (3) 
knowledge about TBI.62-[ADDRESS_606306] 
members substantiates that VCU’s proposed project s are relevant, worthy of investigation, and 
likely to improve the lives of survivors and caregiving family members.  
Beneficial Impact on Target Population 
The VCU TBI Model System (TBIMS) aims to c onduct one new site-specific research project 
and new multi-site module project, continue to collect data for the TBIMS National Database, and 
carry out a wide variety of dissemination activitie s. A strong interest in benefiting consumers and 
professionals guided our choice a nd design of program activities. Specific information about the 
expected benefits of each activ ity is provided in respective sections of the grant (e.g., Design of 
Research Activities; Design of Dissemination Activities ).  
The overall expected benefits of th e VCU TBIMS program are as follows: 
1. Analysis of the National Database will identify characteristics of patients with optimal and sub-
optimal outcomes. An understanding of factors that influence outcomes will aid in needs assessment 
and establishing priorities for program development and training. 
2. Professionals often face uncertainty when choosin g appropriate treatment outcome measures. The 
proposed research programs will help identify sensitive measures, allowing professionals to make 
more informed choices in selecting outcome measurement tools. 
3. Progress in rehabilitation practice has been limited by [CONTACT_473095]-
based practice. Increased knowledge about outcomes and the elements of efficacious treatment to 
improve resilience and adjustment will benefit practice, ultimately improving the lives of survivors 
and their caregivers.

II. Responsiveness to Priorities 
The VCU Health System (VCUHS) enco mpasses a long-standing, comprehensive 
multidisciplinary continuum of care that includes a full range of inpatient and outpatient follow-up 
services (see Adequacy and Accessibility of Resources and Appendix E). Emergency, acute, 
inpatient rehabilitation care, and post-acute services are centered in  the region’s only Level I trauma 
center. In partnership with other providers and agencies, a network of outpatient rehabilitation 
services is also offered in comm unity-based settings. Consistent w ith priorities stated in the [ADDRESS_606308] thoroughly reviewed  and analyzed the literature ( see Design of Research 
Activities - Literature Review, Rationale) . Second, we were guided by [CONTACT_473096]. Importantly, individuals with disabilities and their family 
members have participated in plan ning this proposal, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_472985]. Indeed, they will be integral to future planning, implementation, dissemination, and 
evaluation (see Plan of Operation, Plan of Evaluation). Third, our health system resources (see 
Adequacy and Accessibility of Resources  and Appendix E ), highly qualified personnel (see Project 
Staff) , and practical experience gained through pre liminary research in the proposed areas will 
ensure attainment of our objectives. Fourth, we  have developed and will implement a rigorous 
program evaluation plan to prevent problems and make  certain that objectives are accomplished in a 
timely, cost-efficient, and high quality manner.  
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
[ADDRESS_606309] will examin e caregivers’ well-being with a focus on resilience, emotional 
adjustment, burden, and needs. As such, VCU TBIM S research falls primarily within NIDILRR’s 
Health and Function  research domain, and secondarily in the  Participation and Community Living 
domain. The selection and design of projects were guided by [CONTACT_473097], 
NIDILRR’s Long-Range Plan, and ou r Advisory Board. Information regarding stage of research, 
sample size, power calculations, me thodology, and quality control proce dures is provided within the 
text of each research project. We are confident th at the proposed research designs and sample sizes 
will enable us to achieve meaningful and robust findings. With the guidance of our Advisory Board 
and VCU colleagues, data collection instruments were selected based on their sensitivity and 
cultural relevance. With Rich mond’s culturally diverse populati on, we anticipate successfully 
enrolling persons from traditionally underserved popul ations. As in the past, guidance will also be 
sought from the National Data and Statistical Ce nter (NDSC) and the Model Systems Knowledge 
Translation Center (MSKTC). We have worked a nd will continue to work closely with the NDSC 
and MSKTC, as outlined in their letters of support (see Appendix C).  
High quality data collection, following establis hed TBIMS National Database protocols, will 
remain a foundation of our project. VCU has been a member of the NIDILRR-funded TBIMS 
program since 1987. Data on over [ADDRESS_606310] been completed. VCU’s data collection expertise has been recognized by [CONTACT_473098]. For example, our staff have  been involved in NDSC quality support visits, 
training other centers, developi[INVESTIGATOR_472986], and J. Marwitz serves as chair of the 
TBIMS Data Committee. We will apply our considerab le expertise to ensure continued high quality 
data collection.  
Considering our enrollment rate over the past fi ve years (average of 44 patients per year), we 
anticipate accrual of no less than 35 participants per year for the National Database. Collaborative 
relationships with medical cen ters outside our region (e.g., Un iversity of Virginia, Mary 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
6 Washington, and Norfolk Sentara Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]) ensure our ability to recruit a substantial number of 
National Database participants. Further, VC U is now collaborating with Sheltering Arms 
Rehabilitation Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_472987] a 114-bed acute rehabilitation cente r in Richmond. Our analysis of 
admissions for both hospi[INVESTIGATOR_472988] a 50% increase in National Database 
enrollment with the merger. Descriptive statisti cs detailing VCU data collection and follow-up rates 
are provided in Appendix E. VCU researchers are uniquely positioned to continue following 
patients well beyond [ADDRESS_606311] described long-term 
outcomes and trends in rehabilitation care up to  ten years postinjury (s ee Appendix F), and VCU 
has contributed a considerable pr oportion of the data. As requeste d by [CONTACT_248707], specific estimates 
for follow-up data collection costs are provided in the Budget Narrative.  
As directed by [CONTACT_248707], VCU w ill participate in at least one Module project. As specified in 
the Budget Narrative,  no less than 15% of our annual budget will be reserved to fund module 
project operations. Also, as request ed by [CONTACT_248707], funds have been budgeted for participation in 
two annual, in-person Project Directors’ meetings. 
For nearly [ADDRESS_606312] solidified relationships with the Virginia 
Department of Aging and Rehabilitative Servic es, Brain Injury Association of Virginia, VA 
Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers, and Brain Injury Services of Virginia (see also Appendices C 
and E, Letters of Commitment and Support  and VCU Contribution to National Database and 
Continuum of Care) . Information on collaborative mechanisms, entities, and coordination is 
provided in the Collaboration  section of the proposal. A review  of our publications list (see 
Appendix F) substantiates our many successes in collaborative research  endeavors. For example, in 
the past five years, VCU has shared authorship  with other model system  centers in 22 peer-
reviewed journal manuscripts  published or in press.

III. Research Activities 
Resilience is the theme of VCU’s two proposed re search projects. The si te-specific project is 
entitled, Intervention to Promote Survivor Resi lience and Adjustment: Efficacy and 
Sustainability.  The second project, a “module,” is entitled, Caregiver Resilience: A Longitudinal 
Investigation.  Research will also include data collection for the National Database.  
For several reasons, we are highly confident that our projects will: accomplish their stated 
objectives; represent a coherent, sustained approach to research in the field; and contribute 
substantially to the state-of-the-science. First, we  have closely monitored, analyzed, and synthesized 
the literature to charact erize the current state of knowledge, trends, and shortcomings. Second, we 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
[ADDRESS_606313] members, to determine current needs and priorities.  For example, 
participants in the TBIMS Nati onal Database (NDB) and their fa mily members provided input on 
site-specific and module projec t selection, project design, met hods, and intervention content 
through in-person meetings, telephone  interviews, and surveys. Our research projects were designed 
with the goal of providing new and useful info rmation to consumer, research, and clinical 
audiences. VCU’s proposed projects  utilize the most rigorous appl ied-research designs possible. 
Finally, we have strong commitme nts of support from departmental , health system, university, and 
community organizations. 
For the record, collecting and contributing da ta to the NIDILRR TBIMS NDB will be an 
integral part of our research program. As a past  contributor to the NDB, we are well versed in 
enrollment, collection, and data submission procedur es. We are certain we can enroll more than [ADDRESS_606314] done  so on a regular basis. We ar e now collecting data on patients 
who are more than 25 years postinjury with exce llent follow-up rates (e.g., 80-94% at each time 
point). Appendix E provides a summary of our cont ributions to the NDB, as well as information 
about our local database develope d to track research participants  and our continuum of care.

obstacles to complete recovery.81-88 However, concerns about efficacy remain. Frequently, 
intervention outcomes are limited to specific do mains or generate non-transferable skills,13,87 cannot 
be reproduced,89,90 or show transitory gains.81 Without treatment approaches that can produce 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
9 sustainable, holistic gains, TBI survivors will continue to str uggle to establish productive and 
meaningful lives postinjury. 
The Resilience Framework : A recent paradigm shift in the fi eld of psychology has led clinicians 
and researchers to explore the relationshi p between resilience and trauma outcomes.91-93 Resilience 
has been defined as, “positive adaptation in the face of a traumatic event.”[ADDRESS_606316] determined th at (a) the skills associated with 
a resilient and adaptive response to  trauma are neither “superhuma n” nor extraordinary; and, (b) 
resilient skills can be initiated a nd/or enhanced in individuals w ho have previously demonstrated 
non-resilient profiles.94,98

Outcomes following trauma are inextricably linke d to an individual’s ability to consistently 
apply resiliency skills.92,132 Having and applying highly resilient skills facilitates a competent and 
effective response to crisis.92,133-135 Conversely, poor use of a resi lient skill-set is related to 
instability and poor outcomes. Richardson’s96 metatheory of resilience clarifies the divergent paths 
an individual might take in response to trauma : “resilient reintegrat ion” or “dysfunctional 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
10 reintegration.” While individuals who achieve re silient reintegration are more likely to find 
meaning, be productive, and engage in life, those who follow the path of dysfunctional reintegration 
are unlikely to set goals, maintain a support system, or achieve stability.  
Early on in the development of Resilience Theo ry, researchers recognized the possibility that 
resilience could be promoted in pr eviously non-resilient individuals.92,[ADDRESS_606317] four predictors of 
negative outcomes (e.g., extreme poverty, mental illness in the family).[ADDRESS_606318] shown significant improvement following 
resilience-promotion interventions . Measures of emotional well-be ing consistently improve, while 
indicators of psychol ogical distress decline.138,142,144,145 Furthermore, measures of injury/illness 
adjustment often show gains.138,140,143,[ADDRESS_606319] also improved following treatment.140,143,144  
Resilience and TBI:  Given the long-term challenges of TB I, many authors have asserted the 
critical need for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a resilience-promotion approach to  treatment in brain injury 
rehabilitation settings.91,92,95,[ADDRESS_606320]-concussion symptoms.152  
In 2016, a TBIMS multi-center study led by [CONTACT_473099] a sample of  adults with moderate to severe  TBI. The investigation yielded 
evidence that resilience levels were relatively low in comp arison to the general population.54 
Investigators also showed that greater resilien ce was related to higher ed ucation, absence of pre-
injury substance abuse, and lower anxiety. In the same year, Hanks and colleagues reported on 
resilience within 5 years following m ild, moderate, and severe injury.153 Generally, resilience was 
unrelated to injury or demogra phic factors, although the relati onship to education approached 
significance, with higher education levels predic ting greater resilience. In summary, there is 
consensus that resilience is a quality likely to  help mitigate emotional distress after TBI. 
Interventions Promoting Resilience:  The parallel between common TB I deficits and the skills 
necessary for a resilient response to trauma eluc idates the reasons why many survivors struggle to 
respond to injury in a resilient manner (see table on page 9). These challenge s to resilience explain 
why the many existing post-TBI interventions have  largely struggled to demonstrate sustained 
gains:81 TBI diminishes an individual’s ability to be resilient. Without specific efforts to engender 
resilience, survivors are unable to “bounce back” fr om the myriad of postinjury complications they 
are likely to face. White and colleagues92 call for the generation of “sp ecific interventions that could 
enhance factors of resilience” as  a strategy to improve sustainable postinjury outcomes. Lefebvre 
and Levert154 echo this sentiment, asserting that resilien ce is likely a primary factor in survivors’ 
adjustment to injury and deve lopment of new competencies. 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
12 VCU Research: A Curriculum-Based Approach:  One of the greatest ch allenges to designing a 
TBI resilience intervention is the need for a treatment modality that will effectively deliver the 
intervention content. Resilience Theory sets forth a specific set of skills to target to encourage 
resilience.155-[ADDRESS_606321] had great success in implementing effective interventions for TBI 
survivors. Through the use of Curriculum-Based (C-B) approaches, studies have demonstrated 
efficacy for interventions focused on inpatient neurobehavioral functioning,62,159,160 return to 
work,161 and caregiver needs.63,64,66,162 The C-B approach to interven tion development was designed 
to specifically address the uni que needs of persons with TBI.159,161,162 The fundamental structures 
included in C-B interventions are tripartite: (1) education regarding a ch allenge or issue; (2) 
psychological support; and (3) skill bu ilding of abilities asso ciated with improvement in the targeted 
domain.64,66,[ADDRESS_606322]- TBI complications.  
In 2012, with NIDILRR TBIMS funding, VCU re searchers developed a structured C-B 
intervention to promote postinjury  resilience and adjustment: the Resilience and Adjustment 
Intervention (RAI).[ADDRESS_606323]-
acute TBI needs, concerns, and challenges (e.g., common injury effects, copi[INVESTIGATOR_472989], one’s role in recovery, problem so lving, communication, and stress management), 
emphasized education, skill building, and psychologica l support. Our site-specific investigation was 
also implemented to test the feasibility of  the intervention and measurement protocol.  
Outpatients (n=160) with mild to severe TBI were randomly assigned to either a treatment 
(RAI) or wait list control (WLC ) group. Treatment was delivered in  seven one-hour sessions with 
outcome measurement pre- and post-treatment, and three mont hs after treatment completion.

treatment benefits sustained beyond three months? Second, are there patient characteristics that 
predict longevity of benefits? Qualitative feedback from research participants was carefully 
reviewed to provide dire ction for further development of the RAI. Every single participant stated 
that they would recommend the program to others. However, a number of participants wanted more 
sessions with additional time to focu s on individual needs. Input was also sought from our Scientific

recruitment.169 The booster program was associated w ith reduced anxiety and depression and 
increased psychosocial functioning.  
The development and inclusion of booster se ssions increases the extent to which the 
intervention is patient-centered. The addition is well in line with an established literature on the 
additional benefits of patient-centered trea tment over and above those of standardized 
interventions.170-174 As such, patient-centered care has been  champi[INVESTIGATOR_472990] a mark of high quality 
healthcare by [CONTACT_473100]175 and U.S. Congress.176 The essence of the patient-
centered approach entails eliciting as well as mindf ully and flexibly responding to the individual’s 
needs and preferences.[ADDRESS_606327] will address this  knowledge gap. 
A. Rationale: The Need for Effective Interv entions to Promote Resilience and Adjustment 
Along with difficulties in obtaining effective care,  research shows that survivors encounter a 
wide variety of lingering injury-related challenges. For example, many survivors know little about 
the common consequences of injury and have trouble copi[INVESTIGATOR_472991]. Some have 
difficulty taking an active role in treatment, a nd impatience with the rec overy process is common. 
Poor problem solving, emotional regulation, stre ss management, and communication skills further 
exacerbate the challenges of maintaining/rebuilding positive relationships. Research shows that the 
many experience depression41,179,[ADDRESS_606328] difficulty maintaining a positive outlook. 
The Resilience and Adjustment Intervention (RAI) is a standardized educ ational, support, and 
skill-building program developed for persons with TB I. A preliminary analysis  of data derived from 
the VCU TBIMS intervention development projec t has yielded promising findings. The proposed 
investigation is a logical next step in advancing our understandi ng of standardized interventions 
designed to promote recovery.  
The proposed investigation  differs from prior VCU research in several important ways. 
First, in response to recommendations made by [CONTACT_473101], Scientific Advisors, and 
Advisory Board members, the intervention period  has been extended with three booster sessions. 
Boosters will be patient-focused and personalized to address the original RAI topi[INVESTIGATOR_472992], as described in the Intervention  section which follows. Furthermore, the 
project will thoroughly evaluate the sustainability of treatment gains by [CONTACT_473102]-up 
period from three to nine months . The research design will compare the benefits of the original 
intervention (RAI) to an expanded, more person-centered intervention (RAI+).  
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
16 B.  Objectives  
1. to evaluate the short and long-term efficacy of two structured outpatient intervention programs 
(RAI vs. RAI+) on resilience 
2. to evaluate the short and long-term impact of intervention on emotional well-being and postinjury 
adjustment with the RAI vs. the RAI+ 
3. to evaluate the short and long-term impact of the RAI and the RAI+ on abilities including problem 
solving, communication, and stress management 
4. to determine if demographic, lifestyle, injury, or treatment response information can predict 
maintenance of gains 
C.  Hypotheses  
1. Primary:  Participants receiving the booster (RAI+ group) will report higher levels of resilience in 
comparison to individuals in the standard RAI group. 
2. Participants in the RAI+ group will show better adjustment and lower levels of emotional distress 
as compared to persons in the standard RAI group. 
3. Additionally, participants in the RAI+ group will report greater abilities in the areas of problem 
solving, communication, and stress management relative to persons in the standard RAI group. 
4. A participant’s demographic, lifestyle, injury, and treatment response information will be 
predictive of maintenance ability. 
D.  Methodology  
D1.  Stage of Research 
VCU’s previous work with the RAI was best labe led as an “Interventi on Development” project. 
The present proposal is best labe led as falling within the “Interve ntion Efficacy” stage of research, 
as the primary goal is to evaluate  whether the RAI+ is feasible, pr actical, and has the potential to 
yield sustainable and positive outcomes over and a bove the benefits of the RAI. The present 
proposal also seeks to identify individual charact eristics associated with  positive outcomes. The 
success of the proposed research program will allow for the “scaling up” of the RAI in hopes that 
the evidence-based intervention will be widely adopted in practice. 
D2.  Sample  
Information regarding inclusi on and exclusion crite ria, enrollment rate, and participant 
incentives is provided here in. Recruitment information is provided in the Procedure  section.  
Inclusion criteria:  Individuals [ADDRESS_606329] TBIMS brain 
injury definition will be used: da mage to brain tissue caused by [CONTACT_473103], post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), skull 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
17 fracture, or objective neurological findings that can be reasonably attributed to TBI on physical 
examination or mental status examination. Sin ce there is no reason to believe that treatment 
effectiveness varies with chronicity, no maximum has b een set for time postinjury. 
Exclusion criteria: Active substance abusers (e.g., intoxicated at arrival to intake ), individuals at 
imminent risk of psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_472993], 
as judged by [CONTACT_473], will be excluded from the study. Records will be kept indicating the 
number and type of exclusions. Th e data will be evaluated to help  ascertain the representativeness 
of the final sample. 
Enrollment rate:  Considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria and past research experience at 
VCUHS, average monthly accrual  rates are estimated to rang e between 3-4 participants. 
Considering potential attrition ra tes (e.g., 10%), we conservatively es timate an accrual rate of no 
less than 154 participants over the 46-m onth enrollment period. As noted in the  Data Analysis  
section, power analyses indicat e our anticipated sample size exceeds recommended minimums.  
Participant incentives: Participants will be provided therapy,  educational materials, and referral 
services at no cost. Each part icipant will receive up to a total of $140. Individuals will receive $[ADDRESS_606330] two assessments (pre- and post-treatment) and $30 each for the 
latter three (pre- and post-booster,  and long-term follow-up). For part icipants traveling more than 60 
miles roundtrip, funds will be provided to offset trav el costs (IRS mileage rate of 19 cents per mile 
driven). 
D3.  Intervention  
The RAI was developed over the last decade ba sed upon research review and more than 20 
years’ clinical experience. The RAI is a structured, resilience-ba sed approach to helpi[INVESTIGATOR_472994], concerns, and challenges.91,182,183  
Assumptions underlying the RAI: Helpi[INVESTIGATOR_472995], cope, and resume normal 
lives is a formidable challenge. Successful interv ention requires a clear unde rstanding of commonly 
encountered challenges. For example, survi vors must cope with unexpected and unfamiliar 
problems soon after the injury, and in many cases, fo r years afterward. Many experience frustration, 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
18 struggling with their in tense desire to recover quickly and completely. Finally, many survivors 
strive for normalcy, yearning for their former lives. Though there are commonalities, survivors 
differ in the extent to which they face and overc ome each of these challenges. Intervention can be 
more effective when clinicians appreciate five important guiding assumptions:  
1. Successful survivorship is based in individual res ilience. Survivors who possess or learn to adopt 
traits identified as key to resilient living will fi nd increasing success in their recovery, and growing 
satisfaction with their postinjury lives.184  
2. Achieving emotional wellness after TBI requires a clear understanding of injury-related symptoms, 
commonly encountered challenges, and the recovery process.160,178,185 
3. A key feature of resilience is developi[INVESTIGATOR_472996]’s own behavioral response to 
trauma.121,122,186,187 Survivors who are more aware of their strengths and limitations are more likely 
to lead productive and meaningful lives.188,189  
4. Resilient individuals are adept at problem solving, goal setting, communication, and managing stress 
and intense emotions.112,127 Helpi[INVESTIGATOR_472997]. 
5. Survivors are more likely to improve when they develop resilient traits, such as being actively 
engaged in recovery,126,131 and are able to maintain a positive outlook.107,127  
Intake and treatment planning: Treatment begins with an intake  session that helps shape the 
intervention process. Information is gathered us ing both quantitative and qualitative methods. Via 
interview, participants will be as ked about their injury, progress in recovery, and their home, family, 
and work situation. They will be asked about thei r emotional well-being as well as their personal 
needs, goals, and priorities. Additionally, particip ants will complete a series of measures (see 
Measures section for a complete description). 
Intervention modalities:  The RAI is a curriculum-based intervention which has three major 
components: (1) skill-building: helpi[INVESTIGATOR_472998]; (2) 
psychological support: counseling participants and offering empat hy, encouragement, and hope; and 
(3) education via instruction, discussion, and bibliotherapy.  
Several strategies will be used to extend the benefits of in-person sessions. Participants will be 
provided with copi[INVESTIGATOR_472999], Getting Better and Better after Brain Injury: A Guide for

[ADDRESS_606331] solutions to problems outside of  therapy sessions, as a means of 
consolidating in-session learning.  
The RAI curriculum:  Research and clinical experience have  taught us that survivors differ in how 
they are affected and how they adjust to injur y, yet there are many common problems. Delivered in 
seven 60-minute sessions over seven weeks, the RA I curriculum was developed to provide a solid 
foundation for continuing recove ry. Enhancing resilience and helpi[INVESTIGATOR_473000], concerns, and ch allenges are key objectives. The following table 
specifies the RAI content areas to  be covered (see Implementation Manual in Appendix G for more 
details).  
Session I: Understanding the Effects of Brain Injury will help survivors…  
1. Understand the typi[INVESTIGATOR_473001] 
2. Appreciate the difference between emotional and physical recovery 
3. Cope effectively with loss and change 
Session II: Active Engagement in Recovery will help survivors…  
4. Realize the important role they have in their recovery 
5. Recognize what they can do to help themselves and feel better 
Session III: Setting Reasonable Goals will help survivors…  
6. Appreciate that success is relative  
7. Improve their ability to be patient  
8. Understand and implement effective goal setting strategies 
Session IV: Solving Problems Effectively will help survivors…  
9. Learn and use more effective problem solving strategies 
Session V: Managing Stress, Anger, and Other Intense Emotions  will help survivors… 
10. Monitor and manage stress more effectively 
11. Better manage intense emotions including frustration, anger, and fear 
Session VI: Communicating Effectively and Rebuilding Relationships will help survivors… 
12. Rebuild relationships and overcome loneliness 
13. Learn and apply more effective communication skills 
14. Develop strategies for comfortably discussing their injury with others 
Session VII: Maintainin g a Positive Outlook will help survivors… 
15. Avoid a negative focus, feeling guilty, or blaming others 
16. Appreciate positive aspects of their new lives, develop a positive attitude, and consolidate gains 
and move forward 
In response to consistent feedback from past RAI participants and Advisory Board 
recommendations,  the original RAI protocol has been expanded for the present investigation . 
One of the most consistent recommendations an d requests was to lengthen the duration of the 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
20 program and to include more person-centered cont ent within the pre-established curriculum. For 
half of study participants (RAI + group), three 60-minute follow- up booster sessions are planned 
three months after completion of the RAI. The goa l of providing booster sessions is to consolidate 
gains achieved in the core treatment, ameliorate the impact of cognitive deficits on learning, and 
address ongoing or new challenges in rehabilita tion. In other populations, booster sessions have 
been shown to improve problem-solving, enha nce communication, and st rengthen relationship 
skills167,[ADDRESS_606332] of ‘Important Thi ngs You Can Do to Keep Getting Better,’ completed 
in Session VII that identifies the most important things participants learned during the course of

Review of Concerns Expressed During Previous RAI Sessions 
The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_473003]. The status of efforts to resolve diffi culties will be discussed. Effective and ineffective 
strategies will be distinguished.  
Identification of Ongoing Issues and Concerns  
Participants will be asked to identify new issues or  concerns that have arisen since the most recent 
intervention session.  
Problem Solve and Implement Strategies for Improvement 
Where multiple concerns are identified, priorities will be established and a plan for resolution will be 
formulated. Previously learned skills and strategies  (e.g., problem solving; managing stress and intense 
emotions; effective goal setting) will be applied to achieve solutions. 
During the third and final booster session, the therap ist will again review th e list of ‘Important 
Things You Can Do to Keep Getting Better,’ comple ted in Session VII. Toge ther, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_473004] a revised list to reflect  new learning and new plans for next steps to 
continue getting better.

21 D4.  Measures  
The measures chosen for the present investigatio n were selected because they: (1) are relevant 
to project objectives and hypotheses;  (2) have substantial evidence of reliability and validity; (3) are 
included in the NDB; and (4) are include d in the Common Data Elements (CDE).190-192  
Patient demographics and history : Information will be collected including: age, gender, ethnicity, 
marital status, household income, living situati on, education, pre- and postinjury occupational 
status, and hours worked per week. Additionally, information will be obtained about pre- and 
postinjury substance abus e (Behavioral Risk Factor Survei llance System, BRFSS) and mental 
health treatment.  
Injury characteristics:  The following information will be obtained from medical records: date of 
injury, etiology, admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, duration of unconsciousness and 
post-traumatic amnesia, duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28689], time postinjury, and hist ory of neurosurgical 
intervention. 
Connor-Davidson Resilie nce Scale (CD-RISC):  During the past decade, researchers have 
developed resilience measurement scales, and res earch suggests that Connor and Davidson have 
been most successful.193,[ADDRESS_606333] developed a 25-item scale (CD-RISC) reflecting 
resilience characteristics iden tified by [CONTACT_473106].195,196 Normative studies including factor 
analyses indicated that the CD-RISC is reliab le, valid, and sensitive to treatment effects.97 More 
recently, a 10-item version was developed using e xploratory and confirmatory factors analyses.197 
Respondents are presented with a series of descri ptors (e.g., “I am able to adapt and change,” 
“Copi[INVESTIGATOR_473005]”) and rate themselves on a 0-4 scale ranging from rarely true 
(0) to true nearly all the time (4). Campbell-Si lls and colleagues have ch aracterized the 10-item 
version, to be used in the present study, as demons trating excellent psychome tric properties, namely 
reliability, internal consis tency, and construct validity.197,198  
Mayo Portland Adaptability Inventory-4 (MPAI-4):  Included as a CDE-recommended global 
outcome measure, the MPAI-[ADDRESS_606334]: This self-report measure was developed more than a decade ago for clinical 
research studies on stress management with survivors and caregiving family members.162 Sample 
items include, “I have more to do than I can hand le,” “I’m pushing myself too hard,” and “I can’t 
stand living like this.” Items are rate d as True (+1) or False (0) with  higher scores indicating higher 
stress levels.[ADDRESS_606335] in the present investigation. 
Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18): This 18-item self-report instrument is the abbreviated 
version of the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (S CL-90-R) developed to  quantify psychological 
distress in the ge neral population.[ADDRESS_606336]  used the BSI to monitor change in psychological 
status in response to treatment202 and general change in status over time.203 The BSI-18 is often used 
because of its sound psychometric properties,165 brevity, ease of admi nistration, and global 
assessment of psychological issues co mmonly found in individuals with TBI.191 The measure is 
included in the TBI CDE as a gauge of psychiatric and psychological status. 
Frequency ratings for items in three primary symptom dimensions are added to yield scores for 
Somatization, Depression, and Anxiet y. The Global Severity Index (GS I) reflects the sum of scores 
for the three symptom dimensions. T-scores for e ach dimension and the GSI are calculated based on 
community norms. GSI scores, reflecting overall dist ress levels, will be the focus of the present 
investigation. A study examining the psychometri c properties of the GS I with a TBI sample 
characterized the GSI as having good internal cons istency with excellent reliability and validity.[ADDRESS_606337]-protected computers for secure data entry, 
management, and statistical analysis. Locked file cabinets and offices also ensure data security.  
D6.  Procedure 
Patients will be self-referred or referred by [CONTACT_473107], 
organizations (e.g., Brain Injury Association of Vi rginia), and agencies (e.g., Virginia Department 
of Aging and Rehabilitative Services). N. Moadab  will facilitate recruitm ent at VCUHS outpatient 
clinics. When persons with TBI contact [CONTACT_473108], an intake 
session will be scheduled.  
During the intake, a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (e.g., [CONTACT_473218], [CONTACT_469706]) will provide information about the 
research program, and determine eligibility and interest in participation. Staff will explain study 
details and obtain informed consent. When ther e are concerns about the individual’s ability to 
provide informed consent, formal assessment of  decision-making capacity will be made using the 
MacArthur Competence Assessment T ool, Clinical Research versi on (MacCAT-CR). An instrument 
derived from pi[INVESTIGATOR_473006]-center studies of treatment capacity,[ADDRESS_606338] deviations below the mean for 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
24 the normal population.206 This criterion is commonly used in assessment of decision-making 
capacity211-213 and has been shown to be more stringe nt than expert asse ssment of capacity.206 
Generally, 15 to 20 minutes is required for completion.214  
As allowed under Virginia state law, an alternat ive procedure will be used to consent persons 
lacking the capacity to give informed consent,  as determined by [CONTACT_473087]-CR or judged by [CONTACT_4520]. Investigators will s eek to obtain consent from a legally designated substitute decision-
maker. In every case, an effort will be made to obtain assent from the patient. Patients who decline 
to participate will not be enrolled regardless of their respective substitute decision-maker’s desire. 
Readers should note, the protocol for this projec t has been submitted for review and approval to the 
VCU Office of Research Subject s Protection and formal approval is pending. More detailed 
information regarding human subject s protection and safety monitoring procedures is detailed in the  
Human Subjects Narrative  (Form 424) and the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan . Readers should 
also note that, once approved, the study will be registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. 
On giving informed consent, participants will  be given baseline assessment materials to 
complete. Estimated time for the completion of ba seline measures is 30- [ADDRESS_606339]. Sima, participants will be 
randomly assigned to either of two groups: (1) RAI or (2) RAI+. After randomization, a second 
appointment will be scheduled. Participants will begin treatment during th eir second appointment.  
The RAI consists of seven 60-minute sessions scheduled over seven weeks as described in the 
Intervention  section. During the first session, participants will receive an empty loose-leaf binder to 
store and organize completed self-assessments, read ing materials, and homework assignments from 
each session. Participants will also receive a copy of the curriculum, Getting Better and Better after 
Brain Injury: A Guide for Survivors, 2nd edition .183 They will be asked to review materials and 
complete worksheets between sessions. The RAI w ill be implemented by [CONTACT_473109], licensed 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] ([CONTACT_473218], [CONTACT_469706]). Within each tr eatment condition, participants will be randomly 
assigned to one of the two therap ists. Data will be analyzed to identify any therapi[INVESTIGATOR_25119]. 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
25 For the RAI+ participants, three booster sessi ons will be implemented as described in the  
Intervention  section of this proposal. The three weekly booster sessions will be  scheduled to start 
three months following completion of Session VII.  
Implementation of quality control procedures:  A protocol has been established to ensure the 
quality and standardization of treatme nt implementation across therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]. 
During the two-month project start-up period, the ther api[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (A. Mills, N. Hsu), and J. Kreutzer will 
meet to review the manual and discuss implementation and standardization procedures.  
Following, each therapi[INVESTIGATOR_473007], and implement Session I of the RAI 
curriculum. Informed written consent for digital audio-recording will be obtained. Afterward, the 
intervention audio-recordings will be reviewed with  [CONTACT_473215], with the manual in hand, to make 
certain that all steps are faithfully completed. Additiona lly, [CONTACT_473215] will assure that therapi[INVESTIGATOR_473008], which are considered to be key elements of treatment 
(see Appendix G). Strategies for improving consistency between therapi[INVESTIGATOR_473009]. Changes will be made in the implementation manual (e.g., clarification of procedures) as 
needed. 
The two therapi[INVESTIGATOR_473010], and implement the remaining 
six sessions of the RAI curriculum. Again, the audi o-recordings will be reviewed with [CONTACT_473215], 
and strategies for adherence to the manual will be  discussed and implemented after each session.  
Every six months thereafter, the complete qu ality control procedure will be reapplied.  
Additional quality control procedures will be  implemented for booster sessions with each 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. As indicated in the  Intervention  section, booster sessions ar e person-centered and thereby 
[CONTACT_473110]. Audio-recordings will be ma de for the three booster sessions and reviewed 
with [CONTACT_473215] to ensure that key areas are co vered as outlined in the manual. Every six months 
thereafter, quality control procedures will be repeated. 
Data collection procedures:  Demographic, injury severity, and history information will be 
collected at baseline using TBIM S standard procedures. For RAI and RAI+ participants, outcome 
measures will be obtained prior to treatment (baseline) and following completion of the RAI. 
Outcome measures for RAI+ participants will be obtained at the start and completion of the booster, 
and six months following completion of the booster sessions. Measures for RAI participants will be 
obtained at three, four, and nine months post-RAI treatment. Data collection will occur within the 
same timeframe for both RAI and RAI+ participants  as outlined in the figure that follows.  
 
 
 

VCU TBIMS Proposal 
[ADDRESS_606340] timeline: The major activities for the research pr oject are sequentially delineated in the 
Plan of Operation section. 
E.  Data Analysis 
Descriptive statistics (e.g., means, standard de viations, proportions) wi ll be calculated for all 
measures at designated time intervals. Analyses  will be performed using the university licensed 
statistical program SAS v.9.3 (© 2002- 2010; SAS In stitute Inc.; Cary, NC). The following table 
provides a description of major sta tistical analysis procedures, empha sizing priority areas related to 
research hypotheses. Information is provided regarding statistical  hypotheses, statistical methods, 
power analysis and sample size estimates. Analyses evaluating the RAI+ are based on the intent-to-
treat principle if drop-out is assumed as missing at random or missing completely at random. 
Hypothesis 1 – Primary: Participants receiving the booster (RAI+ group) will report higher levels of 
resilience in comparison to individuals in the standard RAI group.  
Statistical Methods:  A linear mixed-effects model will be used to model the CD-RISC scores over 
time for the RAI and RAI+ groups. The model will include fixed-effects for time at RAI+Booster 
initiation, conclusion, and long-term follow-up (e.g. 5, 6, and 11 months), group (RAI or RAI+) and the 
interaction between group and time. The model will also adjust for fixed-effects for injury severity, 
time postinjury, and education. Within-subject correlations in the CD-RISC scores over time will be 
modeled using a spatial power covariance pattern structure. Specific contrast statements will be used to 
test for a difference in the CD-RISC change scores between the treatment groups at both RAI+Booster 
initiation and conclusion as well as RAI+Booster initiation and long-term follow-up at a significance 
level of .05. 
Power Analysis: Data obtained by [CONTACT_473111]-RISC increased from a 
baseline value of 21.[ADDRESS_606341]-treatment (Difference=7.3), followed by a 
decline to 25.5 at the 3-month follow-up (Difference=2.9), with a standard deviation (SD) of the change 
score equal to 5.0. Considering a conservative SD of  6.0, this study will require 138 participants (n=69 
per group) using a two-sample t-test performed at the 0.05 significance level to achieve 80% power. 
This effect translates to an effect size d=2.9/6.0=0.48, which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_56388] a moderate effect 
size. 
Hypothesis 2: Participants in the RAI+ group will show better adjustment and lower levels of 
emotional distress as compared to persons in the standard RAI group.  
Statistical Methods:  Separate mixed-effects models, similar to that outlined in the methods for 
Hypothesis 1, will be used to model the responses for the MPAI-[ADDRESS_606342], each assuming a significance level of .05. Using a similar 40% decrease between the baseline 
to post-treatment values observed in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we would expect the RAI+ to ameliorate declines 
in the MPAI-4 Adjustment and BSI-18 GSI scores by 1.7 and 2.6 points, respectively. Considering a 
conservative SD of 7.0, the 138 participants enrolled would provide power of 29% and 58% for the two 
outcomes, if analyzed by a two-sample t-test at the 0.05 level. 
Hypothesis 3:  Participants in the RAI+ group will report greater abilities in the areas of problem 
solving, communication, and stress management relative to persons in the standard RAI group.  
Statistical Methods:  Two additional mixed-effect models, similar to the first three, will be used to 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
[ADDRESS_606343] at a significance level of α = 
.05. In a similar fashion to Hypothesis 2, a 40% decrease between the observed baseline to post-
treatment values yields differences of 1.[ADDRESS_606344]. Considering a conservative SD of 7.0 and 2.0, respectively, the 138 participants enrolled would 
provide power of 27% and 75% for the two outcomes, if analyzed by a two-sample t-test at the 0.05 
level. 
Hypothesis 4 (exploratory):  A participant’s demographic, lifestyle, injury, and treatment response 
information will be predictive of maintenance ability.  
Statistical Methods:  Separate linear regression models will be used to determine the relationship 
between each of the demographic, lifestyle, injury , and initial RAI response characteristics and both the 
change in the [ADDRESS_606345] 80% power to detect effect sizes of f2=0.12, which is 
considered a moderate effect size. 
Power analyses relating to the primary hypothesis i ndicate minimum group size s of 69 participants. 
If we allow for a maximum of 10%  attrition, then an additional 8 individuals per treatment group 
(16 individuals total) should be recruited (138 /(1-0.1)-138 = 15.3) for a total sample size of 154. 
F.  Feasibility 
F1. Project Staff  
Personnel effort levels are based on thorough cons ideration of our prio r experience conducting 
similar projects. Following is information on res ponsibilities of personnel allocating >5% effort:  
J. Kreutzer, Ph.D. (12% effort): (1) assume primary administrative responsibility for the project; (2) 
staff training, supervision, and performance monitoring; (3) formulation of data collection protocols; 
(4) obtaining informed consent; (5) being present or on call during each assessment and treatment 
session or ensuring another psychologist is on call throughout the study period; (6) analysis, 
interpretation, and dissemination of findings; (7) completion of progress reports. 
A. Mills, Psy.D. (30% effort): (1) intervention implementation; (2) assist with analysis and 
interpretation of findings; (3) assist in preparing reports, presentations, and publications. 
N. Hsu, Psy.D. (30% effort): (1) intervention implementation; (2) assist with analysis and 
interpretation of findings; (3) assist in preparing reports, presentations, and publications. 
J. Marwitz, M.A. (15% effort): (1) database develo pment; (2) supervision of data coding and entry; (3) 
data management and quality control. 
A. Welch, B.A. (45% effort): (1) obtaining informed consent; (2) coordination and scheduling of 
appointments, providing appointment reminders; (3) collection of assessment and outcome data; (4) 
tracking and maintaining high follow-up rates; (5) medical records review; (6) data coding/entry. 
[CONTACT_473219], M. Martinez, and N. Moadab will also ha ve a role in the project (each 5% effort). [CONTACT_473220] will supervise statistical analysis, conducting a subset of the analyses, and interpreting the 
results for reports and dissemination. M. Martinez  will serve as back-up to A. Welch. N. Moadab 
will assist with participant screening a nd recruitment in outpatient clinics. 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
[ADDRESS_606346] research success, we are confident 
in accrual rate estimates, particularly given commitments from the director of the Brain Injury 
Association of Virginia (BIAV) to facilitate recr uitment. BIAV's Executive Director helped develop 
the treatment protocol, and has expressed optimism a bout the protocol's helpfulness. BIAV is in an 
excellent position to assist with recruitment because of  their close, daily contacts with individuals with 
TBI and their families. Individuals often contact [CONTACT_473112]. BIAV has agreed to help encourage participation in our research 
by [CONTACT_473113]. 
BIAV will also help disseminate information about th e need for research participants to professionals 
and agencies. Advisory Board members, representing a variety of organizations (e.g., Department of 
Aging and Rehabilitative Services, Brain Injury Serv ices, Mill House) and service providers (e.g., Tree 
of Life, Concussion Care Centre of Virginia), have also agreed to disseminate information about the 
project and the potential benefits of treatment (see Appendix C for letters of support). 
Individuals with TBI may have difficulty completing measures because of difficulties with 
fatigue, vision, motor functioning, or other impairments. Failure to include participants with 
severe disabilities may also create a biased sample.  Based on our experience, we anticipate that 
fewer than 10% of individuals who are three or more months postinjury will have significant difficulty 
completing the proposed measures. To reduce the likelihood of sample bias, we will invite participants 
to indicate whether they have difficulties and we will offer a variety of accommodations. 
Accommodations may include reading questionnaire ite ms to the person or recording responses for 
them. A record will be kept of accommodations made for each person, allowing an evaluation of 
whether accommodations affected response patterns. 
A number of participants may be unavailable for follow-up. The accrual numbers presented in this 
proposal are based upon a review of data collecti on rates in past studies conducted at VCU. 
Furthermore, with more than [ADDRESS_606347] developed 
an effective follow-up system. The cornerstones of the system include: (a) providing high quality 
clinical follow-up services; (b) maintaining up-to-date contact [CONTACT_3031]; and (c) employing an 
efficient appointment reminder system. Our system employs a combination of in-person, written, and 
telephone reminders. Most of our studies have included annual follow-ups, and follow-up rates have 
ranged between 90-95%.  
Participants may be involved in concurrent individual psychotherapy or support groups or may 
be taking psychotropic medications. Individuals will be eligible for this study regardless of 
concurrent mental health treatment. As a matter of ethical practice, psychiatric consultation will be 
offered to individuals requesting services or who appear to be in need. Information about concurrent 
treatment will be obtained during each assessment session and recorded for each participant. Statistical 
analysis will be implemented to assess the relationship between concurrent therapy participation and 
treatment (RAI) outcome.  
Interventions may not be completed within the proposed timeframe. Ideally, the RAI will be 
completed in seven weeks. For RAI+ participants, ideally booster sessions begin three months after 
completion of the RAI and will be completed in three weeks. Unforeseen delays may arise (e.g., related 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
29 to illness, transportation) that may affect timelines. We have built in windows that allow a modicum of 
flexibility. We will record completion dates and statistically evaluate how outcome data are affected by 
[CONTACT_473114]. 
G.  Expected Beneficial Impact 
 An effective intervention for survivors will improve psychological outcomes and provide a means of 
counteracting the adverse, far-reaching effects of reduced inpatient lengths of stay.  
 Use of effective patient-focused intervention and outcome tracking will provide an empi[INVESTIGATOR_473011]-centered interventions. 
 All systems of care have resource limitations. Improved understanding of effective skill building, 
support, and education strategies will help systems more efficiently allocate resources. 
 Identifying the attributes of participants who are treatment-resistant will facilitate development of 
effective alternative treatments. 
 Effective treatment to promote resilience and adjustment will reduce the adverse impact on family 
members who are often in a caregiving role. 
 Providing empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675]-based guidance to clinicians se rving participants will enable them to deliver 
more effective and efficient services.  
 Development of a structured, replicable intervention will allow treatment providers and advocacy 
organizations to provide services in more settings. 
 New hypotheses will be generated for future treatment studies. 
 Empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675]-based research findings will provide a ra tionale for requiring third party payers to cover 
the cost of intervention services, previously dismissed as having uncertain efficacy. 
Caregiver Resilience: A Long itudinal Investigation 
Introduction and Review of Literature 
Many persons with moderate to severe TBI requir e assistance from a caregiver for months or 
years postinjury.[ADDRESS_606348] widely-cited studies of caregiver distress was a TBIMS, multi-
center prospective study.43 Investigators found clini cally significant rates of depression (19%), 
anxiety (18%), and somatic symptoms (24%), with  one in ten caregivers exceeding the cut-offs on 
all three scales.  
A shift in the field of psychology has led to  a focus on the positive facets of postinjury 
adjustment, notably, resilience. Un fortunately, little is known about caregiver resilie nce after TBI. 
To date, only two studies have explor ed caregivers’ pos tinjury resilience.67,68 Las Hayas and 
colleagues67 found that Spanish caregivers’ resilience was positively correlated with quality of life 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
30 and negatively correlated with  perceived burden. However, the study aimed to describe the 
psychometric properties of a new re silience questionnaire, and caregiver s’ resilience levels were not 
described. Simpson and Jones68 found that higher levels of re silience among Australian caregivers 
were associated with lower rates of negative aff ect and caregiver burden. Us ing Wagnild’s criteria, 
the resilience level of Simpson’s sample w ould be characterized as “moderately low to 
moderate.”225 Las Hayas’ and Simpson’s studies are lim ited by [CONTACT_473115]-
sectional data from a single center.  
Given the scarce literature on TB I caregivers, we examined studies of resilience among 
caregivers of persons with dementia. Although deme ntia differs from TBI in several important 
ways, caregivers of persons with dementia take on somewhat compar able caregiving roles, such as 
support of self-care, instrumental activities of  daily living, cognitive functioning, and emotional 
well-being.226 Thus, findings from this literature can offer insight into resilience among TBI 
caregivers. In a Brazilian study of dementia careg ivers, investigators f ound higher levels of 
resilience were related to lower levels of emotiona l distress. Caregiver res ilience was unrelated to 
caregiver gender or patient s’ clinical or sociodemographic characteristics.227 Elnasseh and 
colleagues226 found that for Argentinian care givers, higher levels of resi lience were associated with 
empathy, optimism, and fewer family problems. Fitzpatrick and Vacha-Haase228 found that 
resilience was unrelated to mar ital satisfaction, but was related to self-efficacy. In a study of 
Alzheimer’s caregivers, Wilks found that younger age and Africa n-American ethnicity were 
associated with higher levels of resilience. Marital status, gender and relation to caregiver recipi[INVESTIGATOR_473012].[ADDRESS_606349] studies 
did not fully describe resilience le vels, leaving questions about the qua lity of caregivers’ resilience 
unanswered. Of the two studies that did provide mean resilience values,227,229 resilience levels were 
considered to be moderate to modera tely low based on general population norms.225 Nevertheless, 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
31 the evidence from both the litera ture on caregivers in TBI and deme ntia is clear – resilience is 
associated with emotional well-being67,68,227 and perceived burden.67,68  
A. Rationale: The Need for Research  
Caregivers provide integral suppo rt to survivors, especially af ter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_473013]. Concerns 
have been expressed that many survivors go home to family members who are ill-prepared to 
manage commonly encountered problems.[ADDRESS_606350] been several studies e xploring resilience among 
survivors of TBI, very little has been written about resilience in thei r caregivers. As with other types 
of illness, improving outcomes for persons with TB I may be predicated on the well-being of their 
support persons.231,232 Research to quantify and characterize the nature of caregivers’ resilience 
postinjury is a cornerstone to a dvancing the evidence base on ad justment after TBI. Thus, the 
primary purpose of the proposed study is to inve stigate TBI caregivers’ resilience over time. 
Understanding factors relating to resilience will li kely help identify components of a resilience-
building intervention for caregivers and ultimatel y help to improve outcomes for survivors. 
B. Research Questions 
For the past [ADDRESS_606351] emerged: 
1. What is the trajectory of caregiver resilience ove r the first two years postinjury? Does resilience 
change over time for some caregivers? If yes, what patient and caregiver factors are related to 
decline or improvement? 
2. What is the relationship between caregivers’ re silience and their emotional well-being? Can the 
proposed longitudinal, multi-center study reproduce results from several single-center, small-
sample studies with TBI and dementia caregivers? 
3. A few TBI caregiver studies found a relationshi p between caregiver resilience and perceived 
burden. In addition to perceived burden, do other caregiver factors (e.g., needs, time spent caring 
for the patient) relate to resilience? 
4. What is the relationship between caregiver re silience and patient characteristics, including 
resilience, emotional distress, and functional status? 
C. Methodology  
C1. Stage of Research 
The proposed module project is best labeled as  falling within the “Exploration and Discovery” 
stage of research. The present investigation is in tended to generate hypothese s and theories through 
analysis of prospective, multi-center, longitudina l data. There is little information to aid our 
understanding of the construct of resilience in caregivers after TB I, despi[INVESTIGATOR_473014]’ rehabilitation and recovery. Research  suggests that resilien ce can be improved with 
training, and we anticipate that the results of this pr oject will facilitate the development of effective 
interventions that benefit caregivers and patients. 
C2. Sample 
Information regarding inclusi on and exclusion crite ria, enrollment rate, and participant 
incentives is provided here in. Recruitment information is provided in the Procedure  section. 
Inclusion criteria:  Caregivers age 18 and older, identifi ed within six months postinjury by [CONTACT_473116] (survivors) will be included. Part icipants will include relatives, friends, or other 
acquaintances involved in providing care, support, or other meaningful  assistance to the survivor. In 
cases where there is more than one caregiver availa ble, first priority will be given to the caregiver 
who is providing the most care to the survivor. A script will be develope d for data collectors, 
allowing them to better identify a si ngle caregiver for each survivor.  
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
33 Exclusion criteria:  Survivors who are unable to identify a relative, friend, or other caregiver will 
not be enrolled in the study. Fo rmal caregivers, thos e who are a paid prof essional, will not be 
included in the study. Records will be kept indica ting the number and type of  exclusions. The data 
will be evaluated to help ascertain the representativeness of the final sample. 
Enrollment rate:  Considering the proposed eligibility cr iteria and past expe rience with similar 
research, we estimate accrual of no less than two caregivers per month, for a total of at least 26 
annually. We anticipate three additional TBIMS centers  will participate in this module with similar 
accrual rates. Conservatively, 78 VCU participants a nd 234 partner site particip ants will be enrolled 
for a total of 312 participan ts over the 36-month enrollment period. As noted in the Data Analysis 
section, the power analysis indicates our antici pated sample size is more than adequate. 
Participant incentives:  Caregiver participants will be give n $50 for completing each of the three 
assessments. Survivors will be given $[ADDRESS_606352] assessment, as it falls outside of 
NDB protocol. Survivors will receive NDB protoc ol compensation ($50) for the second and third 
assessments.  
C3. Measures 
The measures chosen for the present investigatio n were selected because they: (1) are relevant 
to project research questions; (2) have substantia l evidence of reliability and validity; and (3) are 
included in the NDB.  
Connor-Davidson Resilie nce Scale (CD-RISC):  A full description of the CD-RISC can be found 
in the site-specific project ( Intervention to Promote Survivo r Resilience and Adjustment Measures 
section). As mentioned previousl y, normative studies including factor  analyses indicated that the 
CD-RISC has excellent psychometri c properties, including reliability, internal c onsistency, and 
construct validity.97,197,198 The scale has been effectively used  with a wide variety of populations, 
including caregivers of relati ves with Alzheimer’s disease.229,233 The CD-RISC will be completed 
by [CONTACT_473117]. 
Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9):  The PHQ-9 is used to assess depressive symptom 
severity and identify depressi on based on diagnostic criteria.234 The 9-item scale assesses frequency 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
34 of symptoms on a scale of “0” (not at all) to “3” (nearly every day). 234 Depression severity can be 
determined by [CONTACT_473118], ranging from 0-27, with interpretation cut-off scores of 0-
4 (minimal), 5-9 (mild), 10-14 (moderate), 15- 19 (moderately severe ) and >20 (severe).234 The 
PHQ-9 has good reliability and validity across cl inical and racial/eth nic groups, including 
individuals with a history of TBI.234-236 This widely used measure of depression is also sensitive to 
change over time.237 The PHQ-9 will be completed by [CONTACT_473117]. 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7):  The GAD-7 is used to screen for generalized anxiety 
disorder and assess symptom severity.238 The 7-item scale is based on diagnostic criteria and review 
of existing measures.238 Frequency of symptoms are assessed on a scale of “0” (not at all) to “3” 
(nearly every day). Total scores range from 0-21, with increasing scores indicating more severe 
levels of anxiety.238 The GAD-7 is a reliable and valid meas ure of anxiety in the general population 
and in individuals with TBI.238-240 Both survivor and caregiver will complete the measure. 
Family Needs Questionnaire (FNQ): The FNQ is a 37-item questionnaire developed to measure 
family members’ perceived needs after a survivor’s brain injury.241 The items were designed to 
address diverse postinjury psychosoc ial and educational needs. Caregi vers rate the degree to which 
each need has been met (not met, partly met, or met). An early investigation provided evidence of 
content and construct validity. Internal consiste ncy was indicated by a Spearman-Brown split-half 
reliability of .75.242 A later factor analytic i nvestigation revealed six inde pendent factors comprising 
six scales: Health Information, Emotional Suppor t, Instrumental Support, Professional Support, 
Community Support Network, and Involvement with Care.243 Internal consistency for individual 
factors was indicated by [CONTACT_32358]’s alpha’s ranging from 0.[ADDRESS_606353]-acute needs will be used  (e.g., Emotional Support, Instrumental Support, 
Professional Support, Community Support Network).  
Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI):  The ZBI was originally devel oped as a 22-item questionnaire 
designed to quantify caregiving burden and is the most comm only used measure of such.244 
Caregivers are asked to describe perceived changes in their emotiona l or physical health, social life, 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
35 and financial status as a result of caring for a relative. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale, 
ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (nearly always). A to tal score is derived, representing the extent of 
burden, with higher scores denoti ng greater burden. Research has ev aluated the utility of a 12-item 
version.[ADDRESS_606354] udy among three caregiving populations (advanced 
cancer, dementia, and acquired brai n injury), the 12-item ZBI ha d excellent validity (rho = .95-
.97).[ADDRESS_606355] been used with adult and pediatric TBI 
populations.66,219,223,247 The present investigation will utilize the 12-item version.  
Caregiver demographics and history:  Demographic data collected will consist of age, gender, 
race/ethnicity, marital status, hous ehold income, years of education, occupational status, and nature 
and length of relationship with survivor. To help ch aracterize relationships, the caregiver will also 
be asked to indicate: (a) whethe r they are living with the survi vor; (b) the numbe r of hours spent 
caring for them daily; and (c) and the average numb er of days per week the caregiver sees the 
survivor. Additionally, information will be obtained about current and past mental health treatment 
and substance abuse, using th e same variables as the NDB.  
Survivor demographics and history: Data from the NDB protocol wi ll be used. In addition, at the 
6-month follow-up, the Disability Rating Scal e and PART (Participa tion Assessment with 
Recombined Tools-Objectiv e) will be collected.  
Injury characteristics: The following information will be used from the NDB data collection: date 
of injury, etiology, admission GCS score, duratio n of unconsciousness and post-traumatic amnesia, 
duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and hist ory of neurosurgical interventi on (e.g., cranioto my/craniectomy, 
ICP monitoring).  
C4. Procedure 
This will be a multi-center, prospective longi tudinal investigation. Newly enrolled TBIMS 
NDB participants will be contact[CONTACT_473119] x months postinjury and 
asked to identify a caregiver. Caregivers will be  approached, provided with information about the 
project, and invited to participate. Informed cons ent will be obtained. At six months postinjury (+/- 
VCU TBIMS Proposal

approval. More detailed information regarding human subjects protection and safety monitoring 
procedures is detailed in the Human Subjects Narrative (Form 424). 
Implementation of quality control procedures:  A standard protocol wi ll be implemented to 
maintain consistency and timeliness of data co llection across centers. Ea ch center will have a 
management team consisting of a project director and project coordinator. With assistance from the 
coordinator, the director will have primary responsibility for ensuring: 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
37  enrollment of appropriate participants with respect to inclusion and exclusion criteria 
 proper administration of measures 
 completion of assessments within specified timeframes 
 accurate entry of data 
In collaboration with the NDSC, VCU will devel op the project database. Computer scoring will 
be used to eliminate errors in calculating and converting scale scores. Data entry programs will be 
set up to eliminate the possibility  of entering out-of-range values. 
D. Data Analysis 
Descriptive information will be computed for ea ch of the variables measured in this study. 
Separate summaries will be provided for those measures collected at each follow-up. Caregivers 
will be classified as having increasing, decreasing, or stable resilience based on a 3-unit change in 
CD-RISC scores. The 3-unit cutoff was chosen since it is approximately the level of decrease we 
found in our previous research focused on pos tinjury resilience (manuscript under review, Archives 
of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation ). ANOVA and Pearson chi-square tests will be used to 
determine if caregiver characteristics are related to resilience score changes. Additionally, a latent 
class linear mixed model (LCLMM) predicting the longitudinal CD-RISC values will be used to 
identify groups of caregivers that have similar trajectories over time and the characteristics related 
to these groups.248-[ADDRESS_606358] Bayesian informati on criterion (BIC), while limiting the model to 
include no more than 10 trajectories. After identific ation of the optimal model, a 3-step process will 
be used to classify and determine the relationshi p of both caregiver and patient characteristics with 
the latent trajectories.252  
Following our strategy with previous longitu dinal studies of resilience (under review, Archives 
of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation ), individual growth curve analyses will be used to assess 
the relationships between caregivers’ resilience and the longitudinal caregiver and patient 
characteristics. These models wi ll include correlated random inter cept and slope effects. Separate 
models will be fit with time, each caregiver and patient characterist ic, and the interaction of these 
variables. Similar models will be fit without th e interactions, and any in teraction or individual 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
[ADDRESS_606359] a p-
value <0.05. The continuous time variable will remain in the m odel regardless of statistical 
significance. A random effect will be included to  adjust for the different study sites and all 
inferences will be adjusted for the estimation of the random effects using a Kenward-Rogers 
adjustment.253  
The SAS software will be used for all analyses except the LCLMM analysis, which will be 
performed using the ‘lcmm’ package in R.251 All inferences will be made  at the 0.05 level and all 
statistical models, with the exception of the ANO VA and Pearson chi-squared tests, are able to 
incorporate data that is missing at random. An adjustment for multiple comparisons will not be 
made due to the exploratory nature of the study.254 
Power Analysis: Conservatively, assuming that 85% of car egivers (N=266) will complete the two 
year follow-up, a one-way ANOVA will be able to detect effect sizes of f=0.19 with 80% power. A 
Pearson’s chi-square test will have power to detect an effect size of ω=0.19 or ω=0.[ADDRESS_606360] suggested that > [ADDRESS_606361] ourselves to caregivers th at contributed data at all thr ee time points (266 participants x 3 
time points=798 observations). Lastly, a linear mixed effect model with a 3- level covariate will 
have 80% power to detect a covariat e by [CONTACT_473122] f=0.[ADDRESS_606362] Staff 
Personnel effort levels are based on thorough cons ideration of our prio r experience conducting 
similar projects. Following is informa tion on responsibilities of personnel:  
J. Kreutzer, Ph.D. (6% effort): (1) assume primary administrative responsibility for the proposed project; 
(2) staff training, supervision, and performance monitoring; (3) formulation of data collection protocols; 
(4) being present or on call during each assessment session or ensuring another psychologist is on call 
throughout the study period; (5) analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of findings; (6) completion of 
progress reports. 
J. Marwitz, M.A. (20% effort): (1) preparation of syllabus and procedures manual; (2) in collaboration 
with NDSC, develop data entry and scoring quality  control procedures; (3) scheduling multi-center 
teleconferences and meetings for training, quality control, and dissemination planning; (4) supervision of 
local data collection and entry; (5) assistance with data analysis. 
M. Martinez, B.A. (20% effort): (1) obtaining informed consent; (2) coordination and scheduling of 
appointments, providing appointment reminders; (3) data collection and entry; (4) tracking and 
maintaining high follow-up rates. 
A. Sima, Ph.D. (8% effort): (1) supervise statistical analysis; (2) conducting a subset of analyses; (3) 
interpreting the results for reports and dissemination. 
E2. Potential problems and solutions 
In consultation with the Advisory Board and Sc ientific Advisors, poten tial problems with 
procedures in this investigation have been cons idered to prevent and address them effectively. 
Following are descriptions of potenti al problems and proposed solutions. 
Accrual rates may be lower than anticipated.  We are confident in accrual rate estimates, given the 
success of previous module projects we have managed (e.g., resilience module, caregiver module). A 
variety of strategies will be used to ensure succes sful recruitment and enrollment. Accrual rates will 
be closely monitored, allowing us to be aware of failures and successes early on. Early identification 
of accrual problems will enable early implementation of corrective actions. A variety of mechanisms 
(e.g., regular conference calls and meetings, list server) will be used to promote sharing of 
information about effective and ineffective recruitment strategies. Sample size calculations are based 
on collaborating with three other centers. Based on prior experience leading modules, we anticipate a 
high likelihood that more than three other centers will participate as collaborators, allowing for 
increased accrual.  
A significant number of participants will be unavailable for follow-up.  Our twenty-five years of 
TBI research experience has led us to develop eff ective follow-up systems. The cornerstones of the 
system include: (a) providing high quality clini cal follow-up services; (b) maintaining up-to-date 
contact [CONTACT_3031]; (c) employing an efficient written and telephone appointment reminder system; 
and (d) communication (e.g., sending birthday and holiday greeting cards) and sharing research news 
(e.g., via quarterly newsletter). VCU follow-up rates at one and two years postinjury have ranged 
from 90-95%. With regard to collaborating centers, our expectations about follow-up rates are based 
upon a review of data collection rates for previous modules in which we have participated. 
Furthermore, the TBIMS has established guidelines for optimal follow-up and all centers will adhere 
to these guidelines for the module effort.  
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
[ADDRESS_606363] 
 A focus on resilience offers a promising opport unity to better understand and conceptualize 
caregivers’ experiences after TBI. 
 We will gain a new and better understanding of how caregiver attributes, namely resilience, relate 
to survivor outcomes and caregiver burden and needs. 
 New hypotheses will be generated for future caregiver intervention development. 
 The development of empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675]-based interventions for caregivers has the potential to benefit 
outcomes for survivors. 
IV. Dissemination Activities 
Disseminating relevant, accurate information a bout TBI and dispelling public misinformation 
are important goals for this proposal. The followi ng methods and formats will be employed to meet 
these objectives: (a) lectures, workshops, conferences ; (b) publications; (c) we b sites; (d) technical 
assistance; and (e) internships, practica, and rese arch training experiences. We will disseminate at 
least five categories of information: research kno wledge (results of scie ntific investigations, 
methods of design and analysis), program develo pment (methods of rehabilitation program planning 
and development), evaluation (methods of medi cal, functional, cognitive, psychosocial, and 
vocational assessment; program evaluation), rehabilita tion practice (medical ca re and rehabilitation 
methods), and resources (iden tifying appropriate support and rehabilitation services).  
Several factors will help assure that dissemination activities are  effective, useful, and of high 
quality . To plan each dissemination activity, input rega rding format, content, and quality will be 
solicited from relevant sources , including consumers served by [CONTACT_309059], Advisory Board 
Members, the MSKTC, and intended audiences. Fee dback relating to past activities will also be 
reviewed. After completing each activity, feedba ck will be solicited and used to guide later 
dissemination activities. 
As indicated in their letters of support, BIAV a nd DARS have agreed to serve an important role 
in dissemination activities. Both organizations’ leaders are member s of our Advisory Board. They 
will have planning, implementation, and evaluation ro les, ensuring that dissemination activities are 
relevant, useful, and of high quality. BIAV and DARS routinel y conduct needs assessments and 
have agreed to share the results with us. Th rough collaborative dissemination projects, VCU has 
also developed a close working relationship with Brai nLine and WETA-TV (see Appendix C, letter 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
41 from N. Gunther). WETA is the flagship PBS st ation in Washington, D.C. We will continue to 
support WETA in developi[INVESTIGATOR_473015], and we will solicit feedback from 
them regarding VCU projects.  
Kelli Williams Gary, Ph.D., MPH, OTR/L, will serve as Dissemination Coordinator. As a 
person with a disability and over [ADDRESS_606364]. Gary’s creden tials and respons ibilities are 
detailed in the Project Staff  and Plan of Operation  sections. 
To enhance the usability and accessi bility of dissemination material s, program materials will be 
made available in multiple formats with sensitivity to issues of culture, language, literacy, and 
disability. Before, during, and after each activity, individuals will be welcomed to identify desired 
accommodations or modifications to increase their likelihood of benefit. We are strongly committed 
to doing our best to accommodate the needs of al l individuals. Further, VCU’s Spanish/English 
Translation and Interpretation Service (SETI) will  help translate materials into Spanish and 
facilitate planning of dissemination activ ities for Spanish-speaking individuals.  
Dissemination Methods and Objectives 
Following are descriptions of dissemination met hods and planned activities. Use of multiple 
methods and activities will increase usability a nd accessibility for persons with different needs. 
A. Conferences: Conference activities will incorporate le ctures, workshops, case presentations, 
panel presentations, and invited peer-reviewed papers and posters . Materials normally produced for 
each conference will include a syllabus, and often, audiotapes or videotapes of presentations.  
VCU Sponsored Interdisciplinar y Conferences for Professionals 
Annual (“Williamsburg”) Conference on  Rehabilitation of the Adult and Child with Brain Injury.  
For [ADDRESS_606365] with audiences of 200-300. The VCU TBIMS program has co-sponsored the 2-3 day conference 
since 1992, reaching a total audience of nearly 5,500. Each year, more than 50 hours of instruction are 
provided, and conference faculty from other collaborating TBIMS programs play a vital role in 
presentations. Continuing education credits are offered to attendees by [CONTACT_473123] (e.g., CRC, NASW, CCM, APA). Annua l conferences are planned during the five-year 
period, and TBIMS program information dissemination will remain a major objective. 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
[ADDRESS_606366] five years by [CONTACT_473124]. Every effort will be made to continue. 
B. Publications  will include books, manuals, and manuscripts  in peer-reviewed journals. We will 
continue supporting the National Rehabilitation Information Center  (NARIC), providing them with 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_473016]. In addition, we ar e committed to working with the 
MSKTC and the Brain Injury Association of Americ a (BIAA) to meet organization objectives, and 
will continue to share newly developed program materials with them. Our campaigns to promote 
dissemination of accurate information about TBI in the news and social media (e.g., Twitter, 
Facebook) will also continue. The following table highlights aspects of our publication plans: 
Publications for professionals.  Project personnel selection has partly been based on productivity. 
Examination of curriculum vitae  (see Appendix B) clearly shows historically high productivity records. 
The VCU TBIMS has greatly exceeded previous commit ments to disseminate findings. For example, in 
the successful 2012-[ADDRESS_606367] published 19 books on TBI 
rehabilitation (e.g., community integration, vocational rehabilitation, behavioral management, cognitive 
rehabilitation). The books and many of the journal manuscripts emphasize practical treatment 
approaches and NIDILRR priority areas. 
Project personnel are editors of major rehabilitatio n journals and serve on a number of editorial 
boards.  J. Kreutzer is Co-Editor-In-Chief of two international journals, Brain Injury and 
NeuroRehabilitation . As indicated in CV’s, key personnel also serve on journal editorial boards . Here, 
key personnel will enhance accessibility of TBIMS literature. For example, an entire issue of Brain 
Injury  (2012; volume 26, issue 11) was allocated to presentation of information regarding NIDILRR’s 
TBIMS research and programs.  
Publications on special topi[INVESTIGATOR_473017] . We are committed to developi[INVESTIGATOR_473018]. The VCU TBIMS 
has developed and disseminated a wide variety of written and audiovisual materials. For example, we 
developed the 25 Ideas Series,  a series of four books that provide practical information relating to TBI, 
recovery, resources, and self-advocacy with the second edition of Getting Better and Better after Brain 
Injury: A Guide for Survivors  released in 2012. Two additional books were written, Memory Matters  
and Recovering Relationships after Brain Injury. Four of our books have been converted to audio CD 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
[ADDRESS_606368] been 
reached with BIAV and DARS to identify additional topi[INVESTIGATOR_473019]. When completed, 
multiple copi[INVESTIGATOR_473020], all state-affiliated BIA’s, and DARS regional brain 
injury resource centers. Guides and other materials will also be distributed at regional conferences and 
workshops. Furthermore, materials are provided to a ll persons with TBI receiving services at VCUHS. 
Quarterly Newsletter.  TBI Today  is in its fifteenth year of production. The newsletter provides 
educational information to consumers and families. Di stribution by [CONTACT_473125] 800, with issues 
also emailed to over 2,000 subscribers and posted on the VCU TBIMS website, 
http://model.tbinrc.com/newsletters. Staff will continue to produce TBI Today  during the next funding 
cycle.  
BIAV Newsletter. Headway  is published quarterly. In each newsletter J. Kreutzer and colleagues are 
contributors and have a long-term agreement to publish at least one new article in each issue. We will 
continue to publish articles describing our research findings.  
Dissemination of Information to Local and National Media through Newspapers, Magazines, 
Radio, and Television . The media provides opportunities to educate a large public audience. The VCU 
News Services Office has assigned the TBIMS a media consultant, Erin Lucero. [CONTACT_473221], an 
experienced journalist, has worked with us in the past and is very knowledgeable about TBI and 
rehabilitation (see Appendix D for biographical information). Notably, VCU’s TBIMS experienced 
significant media attention (e.g., front page of the January 10, 2012 NY Times  Science section; and 
WETA-TV). Through regular contacts and press releases, [CONTACT_473221] will continue to distribute 
information about the TBIMS in the proposed funding cycle.  
C. Web Sites:  For more than a decade, the VCU TBIMS program has worked to make electronic 
communication and information sharing a helpful resource for consumers and professionals. We 
have established and mainta in three active web sites, The National Resource Center for TBI 
(www.tbinrc.com), and The VCU TBI Model System (http://model.tbinrc.com), and VCU Family 
Support Research  (www.tbifamilyresearch.com). In  addition, we provide support for The Center for 
Outcome Measurement on Brain Injury (COMBI, www.tbims.org/combi). We will continue to 
support the COMBI and serve as th e designated expert for the Fa mily Needs Questionnaire, the 
Neurobehavioral Functioning Inventor y, and the Service Obstacles Scale.  
The National Resource Center for TBI  and VCU TBI Model System  sites were created in 1999. 
Following are descriptions of site  content information. Site cont ent will be reviewed, updated, and 
improved throughout the project funding period.  
 Mailing list subscription  - individuals can subscribe to the web sites’ mailing lists to receive regular 
e-mails. Subscribers will receive updated information about project activities and TBI Today  
newsletters.  
 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ’s) -  an extensive listing with responses from regional and 
national experts; topic areas include networking to locate services, general information on TBI, 
rehabilitation options, cultural issues, return to work, women’s issues, family adjustment, behavioral 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
[ADDRESS_606369] members.  
 VCU TBIMS information -  a description of research programs along with list of publications. 
 “Chat with Pat” -  a support and advice column for everyday problems and concerns. 
 TBI Today -  quarterly newsletter for the VCU TBIMS described in section B, Publications. 
 Links to other locations -  users can review listings of other helpful sites organized by [INVESTIGATOR_399025]. 
 Announcements of conferences and upcoming meetings -  information for both professionals and 
consumers is provided for state, regional, and national conferences and meetings. 
 E-mail -  users can directly contact [CONTACT_473126], directly through links or indirectly by 
[CONTACT_473127] (J. Marwitz). 
The VCU Family Support Research web site provides information for professionals working 
with families after TBI. Publications, links to re sources, and training videos on family intervention 
and education are available. Further content development is planned. 
D. Response to inquiries by [CONTACT_473128]:  TBIMS staff receive and respond to 
200-[ADDRESS_606370] referral info rmation or technical assistance (e.g., information 
about selection, administration, or scoring of measur es). Continuing responsive ness to inquiries will 
enable us to meet a greater di versity of needs and better gauge the needs of the general public.  
E. Internship, Practica and Re search Training Experiences: Students enrolled in our training 
programs disseminate information to their mentors and colleagues. Information about their research 
will be disseminated through conferen ce presentations and publications.   
 VCU was awarded a NIDILRR A dvanced Rehabilitation Research Training (ARRT) Grant in 
September 1992, with additional [ADDRESS_606371]-graduate 
brain injury rehabilitation research training.  
 Eight dissertations and five master’s theses we re completed within our system during the past 
twenty years. A similar rate of future accomplishment is anticipated.  
 Our relationship with students has extended beyond VCU, and includes University of Richmond, 
the College of William and Mary, University of Virginia, Eastern Virginia Medical School, 
Washington and Lee University, and University of Mary Washington students. We will continue to 
work with universities to provide opportunities for research and clinical training. 
Information Products and Production Rates 
An active web site and mailing list substantially in crease our ability to provide information and 
technical assistance. Including web site visits, emails, and phone calls, we an ticipate responding to 
5,000-10,000 information requests. Serving as a be nchmark, the following table depi[INVESTIGATOR_473021], beginning Year 1: 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
[ADDRESS_606372] 
Information developed through the VCU TBIMS has been and will be used to directly extend 
and improve the continuum of care in our region. Successful dissemination will ensure that benefits 
also accrue for persons outside our geographic area.  The following primary benefits are anticipated: 
 Increased knowledge about TBI and rehabilitation resources 
 Improvement in consumers’ ability to self-advocate and serve actively in rehabilitation planning 
 Increased accessibility to appropriate rehabilitation and support services 
 Improved communication between consumers and professionals 
 Increased inclusion of persons with disabilities through reduction and removal of barriers created by 
[CONTACT_473129] 
 Improved life satisfaction for survivors and their families as a result of increased knowledge 
 Greater levels of support for effective rehabilitation programs 
V.  Plan of Operation  
The management plan will make certain that all project objectives are accomplished within 
budget, on time, and with integrity. The plan is based on the following activities and principles: 
 Clear designation of responsib ilities for all personnel incl uding Advisory Board members 
 Designation of authority lines  with clear hierarchies 
 Establishment of clear, coordinated timelines for all project activities 
 Coordinated use of resources to maintain operati ons within budget and in a cost-effective manner 
 Designation of responsibilities for organizational entities 
 Establishment of clear research and dissemina tion objectives towards achieving project goals 
Organizational entities integral to  this project and their major res ponsibilities are de scribed below: 
NIDILRR –  Project Officer and other personnel provide gui dance and leadership, monitor project’s rate 
and quality of accomplishments.  
Senior Management Team – senior project personnel respon sible for management and quality 
monitoring of research and dissemination activities; share primary responsibility for assuring objectives 
VCU TBIMS Proposal

VI. Collaboration 
This project will involve collaboration between a variety of programs and service organizations 
within and outside the University. Ongoing clos e communication, shared interests in achieving 
optimal outcomes, focus on constructive solutions , and mutual respect and support are principles 
shared by [CONTACT_473133]. These principles are the philosophical 
cornerstones of effective collaborative efforts. Within the University system, collaboration will 
occur between clinical programs, University  departments, and administrative offices.  
Outside of VCU, we will collaborate with heal th care providers, survivors, family members, 
advocacy organizations, other TB IMS centers, the MSKTC and other federally-funded programs. 
The following table illustrates i nvolvement of entities necessary  for effective completion of 
research and dissemination activitie s. Letters of commitment to collaborate, offered by [CONTACT_473134], are provided in Appendix C.

A variety of factors will help assure that collaborative efforts are successful: 
 Model systems activities involve building and ex panding on existing positive relationships. All 
the collaborative relationships have existed for many years. 
 On a local, state-wide, and regional level, we ar e collaborating with many other organizations on 
projects hosted by [CONTACT_476]. The model systems effort  provides an excellent opportunity to enhance 
the reciprocity of relationships. 
 All collaborators value high-quality  service, and all were invol ved in the planning of this 
proposal. Each collaborator has a vested interest in  the success of this project. Commitments have 
been made to refer potential participants for invol vement in individual research projects, and to 
provide guidance to ensure that  projects remain innovative, re levant, and scientifically sound. 
 For almost 30 years, the VCU TBIMS program has worked productively with other NIDILRR-
funded model systems and the VCU Rehabili tation Research and Training Center on 
Employment of People with Phys ical Disability. Our many joint publications with other TBIMS 
centers affirms our ability to collaborate successfully (see Appendix F). 
 Many of our proposed research projects share data elements with the NIDILRR TBIMS NDB. 
Shared data elements will enhance opportunities fo r future collaboration. As in the past, we will 
invite other model systems to collaborate with us in our new data collection efforts. Involvement 
in dissemination activities will be invited as well. 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
55  As outlined in the Dissemination section of the proposal, we will continue to collaborate with 
other centers by [CONTACT_473136] (COMBI). The VCU TBIMS has cont ributed information on the Family Needs 
Questionnaire (FNQ), the Neurobehavioral Func tioning Inventory (NFI), and the Service 
Obstacles Scale (SOS). We will continue to prov ide technical assistance to persons who inquire 
about the measures through the COMBI.  
 VCU has a long history of resear ch collaboration with other medi cal and rehabil itation centers 
including NIDILRR-funded centers. Since 1987, we have collaborated with fellow rehabilitation 
centers in the production of 109 peer-reviewed  publications. Our history of successful 
collaboration provides the groundw ork for future partnerships. 
 We are committed to working with the NIDILRR- funded MSKTC. We have taken a primary role 
in developi[INVESTIGATOR_473027]. In f act, VCU, working with 
the MSKTC, received a Bronze Telly Award for producing the video, Relationships after TBI . 
We will continue to work with the MSKTC, generating new ideas and developi[INVESTIGATOR_473028] (see MSKTC letter of support and collaboration, Appendix C). 
In summary,  we are confident that collaborative efforts will be successful for three reasons. First, 
we have a long-standing history of  successful partnerships with ot her agencies and organizations. 
Second, we and our partners firmly agree that colla boration is in the best in terests of all parties. 
Third, we have secured written commitments detai ling the specifics of collaboration from agency 
and organizational leaders, who will comprise a major component of our Advisory Board. 
VII. Adequacy and Reasonableness of the Budget  
Reasonableness of Costs 
Detailed information on proposed costs is provided in the Budget Narrative  section in the front 
matter of the proposal. We believe the proposed cost s are reasonable in relati on to project activities 
for a number of reasons. We will build on a solid foundation of resources, most of which have been 
in place for many years. Evolving in response to  Virginians’ health care needs, VCU Medical 
Center is a centerpi[INVESTIGATOR_473029]. As Virginia’s largest university, 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
[ADDRESS_606382] complete access to the university’s 
resources. Detailed information regardi ng university resources is provided in the Adequacy and 
Accessibility of Resources  section. 
To assure that our goals are achieved in a co st-effective manner, we have selected highly 
competent, diligent, and experienced staff. Project personnel were selected because their expertise is 
highly relevant to program requi rements and goals. Key personnel and most staff members have a 
long history of working in the VCU TBIMS pr ogram. [CONTACT_473215] has been the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_473030] 1987, and [CONTACT_473223] has been Co-Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_473030] 1992. J. Marwitz has 
[ADDRESS_606383] been evaluated and agreed upon by [CONTACT_473137], the Principal Investigators, the Grant Ad ministrator (C. Atkins), and the Chairman of the 
Department of PM&R’s Research Division (P. Wehman).  
 As evidence of the university’s strong commit ment to support TBIMS research, a substantial 
amount of cost share has been allocated. In fact, each year, for five years, VCU will contribute 
$182,986, a total of $914,932.  The cost share amount equals 38.3% of the total funding amount 
requested from NIDILRR. In addition, the university has agreed to reduce the on-campus 
Facilities and Administrative (F&A) rate from 55% to 32%  on Modified Total Direct Costs 
(MTDC) for this project. The reduction represen ts an additional $404,[ADDRESS_606384] evaluati on to make certain that objectives are fully 
realized. The Plan of Operation provides a foundation for the eval uation process. VCU TBIMS staff 
share the philosophy that effective program evalua tion requires: (1) clearl y delineating evaluation 
objectives; (2) creating entities responsible fo r program evaluation with clearly delineated 
responsibilities; (3) developi[INVESTIGATOR_473031]; and (4) developi[INVESTIGATOR_473032]. 
Evaluation Objectives 
Major objectives and primary organizational en tities are presented in the following table. 
Timetables for accomplishing project tasks are provided in the Plan of Operation  section. 
1. Early and continuing assessment of the extent to which the plan of operation has been activated 
and proposed organizational structures have been established (Senior Management Team, 
Advisory Board, Program Evaluator) 
2. Ongoing collection of quantitative and qualitative performance measures (Project Directors, 
Senior Management Team, Program Evaluator, NDSC) 
3. Assessment of adherence to proposed timelines (Project Directors, Senior Management Team, 
Advisory Board, Program Evaluator, NDSC) 
4. Assessment of project impact on consumers’ needs and on the quality of regional resources  
(Senior Management Team, Program Evaluator, Advisory Board, feedback from project 
participants and individuals requesting information and services) 
5. Utilization of designated, independent evaluation to determine: (a) the reliability of data 
collection; (b) the integrity of methodology; (c) the degree to which consumers and family 
members report that programs are relevant; and (d) overall program effectiveness (Program 
Evaluator, Advisory Board, Scientific Advisors, NDSC, NIDILRR) 
6. Prevention and early remediation of problems (S enior Management Team, Project Directors) 
Entities Responsible for Developi[INVESTIGATOR_473033] 
A number of entities within and outside the TBIMS program will have important roles in 
achieving evaluation plan objectives. Complement ary evaluation activities will take place at 
different organizational levels and with varying levels of formality. Following are descriptions of 
program evaluation entities within the VCU TBIMS program:  
 Project Directors.  The research Project Directors a nd the Dissemination Coordinator will 
monitor progress on a day-to-day basis, provid ing monthly written reports on accomplishments 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
[ADDRESS_606385] accrual 
rates and reasons for discontinuations or refusals  to participate will be included in reports.  
 Senior Management Team. The Senior Management Team will formally review the progress of 
each project on a monthly basis. Weekly meetings to review project implementation will also 
include an evaluation component. 
Entities outside the TBIMS program  will have a critical role. Roles of the VCU TBIMS Program 
Evaluator (J. Kim), Program Consultant (R. Rawlin s), Advisory Board, Scientific Advisors, VCU’s 
Senior Leadership, and NIDIL RR program officials are delin eated in the following text. 
With primary responsibility, [CONTACT_32246], Program Evaluator,  will maintain a centralized 
monitoring and evaluation system for the project. He will carefully monitor successes and identify 
challenges as the project moves forward. In conjun ction with the Principal Investigators, he will 
make certain that organizational entities fully pa rticipate in the evaluation process. [CONTACT_32246] will 
also assist in documenting the impact of re search and dissemination activities by [CONTACT_1541]: 
 Quarterly Implementation Assessments to determine the extent to which research and 
dissemination activities occur as specified in the timeline, (see Plan of Operation section). 
 Annual Impact Assessments to determine the extent  to which expected beneficial impacts have 
been achieved.  
The Implementation Assessment will represen t the more formative component of the 
evaluation process throughout the five-year f unding period. The Senior Management Team will 
meet with [CONTACT_32246] and [CONTACT_473226] quarterly to conduct progress reviews. Reviews will identify 
necessary mid-course adjustme nts in project implementation. The results of the quarterly 
implementation assessments will be documented by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kim and included in a formal report, the 
Quarterly Implementation Progress Report. Progress reports will also be used as a monitoring tool 
to systematically identify barrier s to full implementation and strategies for their removal. [CONTACT_32246] 
will consult with the Scientific Advisors on an as-needed basis. 
The Impact Assessment will be more summative in nature and address the extent to which the 
TBIMS project meets the overall goal of generating new research knowledge to improve treatment

committed to making certain that objectives are completed in a timely fashion and within budget 
(see Letters of Commitment and Support , Appendix C). These individuals have enthusiastically 
offered their support and have fully committed the breadth of University resources. The Principal 
Investigators will keep University  leadership fully informed about progress. When difficulties are 
encountered but not promptly remedied, senior leadership officials have  offered their personal 
assistance to guarantee resolution.  
National Data and Statistical Center  will monitor quality of da ta contributed to the NDB 
(e.g., enrollment and follow-up rates; missing data a nd error reports). Their qua rterly reports will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_473138]. The NDSC will assist in 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_473035], if needed.  
NIDILRR Program Officials  will be kept abreast of program  advancement through verbal and 
quarterly written progress reports . Their direct involvement and advice to improve operations will 
be sought at appr opriate times.  
Feedback and guidance will also be sought fr om Directors and staff of other TBIMS and 
NIDILRR-funded programs, particularly when issues  relate to their specia l expertise or mutual 
concerns. For example, Directors of projects with similar foci and objectives will be contact[CONTACT_473139]

Problem Identification and Remediation  
With assistance from Scientific Advisors and Advisory Board members, we will be proactive 
by [CONTACT_473142]. Within the text of the research projects are sections entitled 
Potential Problems and Solutions . All staff involved in program evaluation will be alert to the 
concerns that have been outlined and the need to  address them quickly and effectively. Our strategy 
for effective problem solving emphasizes: 
 identifying potential problems through ongoing monitoring and routine assessment 
 preventing problems before they occur 
 carefully monitoring the su ccess of proposed solutions 
 addressing problems rapi[INVESTIGATOR_473039], using a team problem solving approach 
In summary,  the evaluation plan requires attentively monitoring progress, interrelating 
resources, and addressing concerns proactively. E ffective organizational and management strategies 
will be identified and promoted within all aspect s of the system. Internal  and external groups will 
actively participate in a deliberat e and systematic evaluation pro cess focused on clearly delineated 
performance measures. Communication between group members and among groups is viewed as 
essential to program effectiven ess. The VCU TBIMS will strive toward continuous improvement, 
diligently applying lessons learned from overcom ing challenges to ensure future success.

Herein, detailed information is provided on recruitment practices, faculty, and staff.  Selected 
biographical sketches are presen ted below; CV’s for key personne l are presented in Appendix B. 
Detailed biographical sketches of Project Associates are provided in Appendix D. Specific time 
commitments of paid personnel were carefully cons idered and allocated as indicated in the table 
following project staff descriptions . Additional information regardi ng effort and f unding allocations 
is provided in the Budget Narrative  and Project Staff sections within each research project. 
Recruitment Practices 
We will work with other entities (e.g., DARS,  BIAV, VCU Department of Rehabilitation 
Counseling) to recruit a diverse st aff, including individuals with di sabilities. Because Richmond is a 
large, diverse community, we are confident that we can effectively recruit a diversity of well-
qualified individuals. VCU is an equal opportunity /affirmative action institution and does not 
discriminate on the basis of race, color, sex, se xual orientation, gender identity, age, religion, 
national origin, or disability. As a matter of polic y and history, VCU is cl early dedicated to hiring 
individuals from under-represented groups, includi ng individuals with disabilities, and providing 
training and advancement opportunities. For example,  VCU enables all full-tim e employees to take 
up to six hours of academic credit each seme ster free of charge. Employment counseling, 
mentoring, and Employee Assistance Program (EAP) services are available and readily accessible. 
The VCU TBIMS program has made a special effo rt to recruit and promote individuals with 
diverse backgrounds and we have been successful . For example, among our 14 proposed staff are 
four persons from minority bac kgrounds (K. Gary, J. Kim, M. Martinez, N. Hsu). Two proposed 
primary staff are persons with disabilities (K. Gar y, J. Kim). With more than [ADDRESS_606389]. Kim will serve as 
Program Evaluator for the TBIMS. Over the years,  our TBIMS program has successfully recruited a 
number of other highly qualified research team members with disa bilities (R. Everley, L. Brown, D. 
Bruer, B. Greenwald, T. Naumann, D. West). All but two of these individuals remain employed in 
the rehabilitation field with more  responsibility and better pay.  
Although all positions are currently filled, we have an established recruitment process for 
vacated positions built on the following cornerstones - 
close working relationships with organizations and agencies serving persons with disabilities 
development and implementation of clear, fair, and helpful policies that address the training needs of 
persons with disabilities  
widespread dissemination of information about our policies to potential applicants and sources of 
applicants (e.g., internship and residency programs, university departments) 
As part of the state personnel system in Virginia, VCU carefully follows all rules and 
regulations of affirmative action and equal empl oyment opportunity (EEO). Recruitment for vacant 
positions is done through the VCU Human Resources and Equity and Access Services Offices with 
approval for hiring from the Dean. The search process and committee must be approved by [CONTACT_473143] a position. J ob notices are placed in a diversity of journals, 
newsletters, and newspapers, including Insight to Diversity . To further disseminate information 
about available positions, position de scriptions are sent to leadi ng University departments with 
programs in medicine, allied health, psychology, a nd education. Position availability notices are 
posted in at least one public ation directed towards minor ity populations. Monitoring and 
compliance procedures provide a full system of checks and balances. The VCU Equity and Access 
Services Office routinely guides personnel searches. In addition, the Dean’s Office will use the 
Inclusion and Enhancement Fund to  augment salaries for new hire s from diverse backgrounds as a 
way to continue to increase the di versity of our faculty and staff.

objectives are accomplished effectively and efficiently.  
X. Adequacy and Accessibility of Resources 
VCU is a public research unive rsity with 12 major schools, in cluding the School of Medicine 
which manages the VCU Health System (VCUHS ). Receiving more than $156 million a year in 
sponsored research funding, the Univ ersity has an impressive infras tructure to support researchers. 
Operating since 1838, VCUHS is the only academic medical center in Central Virginia and a 
national leader. With the region’s only Level I tr auma center, 805 inpatient beds and a network of 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
71 outpatient clinics, 750 physician/faculty members offer state-of-the-art care in more than [ADDRESS_606401] single provider of indige nt care in the state (p roviding nearly one-third 
of Virginia’s indigent care). Uninsured patien ts represent 20 percent of  all patients treated, 
substantiating the strong commit ment to serve persons regardless of ability to pay. 
Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.  The Department of PM&R is chaired 
by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Cifu, TBIMS Co-PI. [CONTACT_473223] will ensure  that project staff have full access to space, 
equipment, and administrative support to complete their work. The Department  is one of the oldest, 
most well-established university  PM&R departments in the count ry. Comprehensive inpatient and 
outpatient services are provided to patients with a variety of neurological , musculoskeletal, and 
other conditions, including TBI, stroke, spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828], burns, and cancer.  
Housed within the Department of PM&R is  CERSE, the VCU Center for Rehabilitation 
Science and Engineering. Funded by [CONTACT_52743]’s Offi ce of Research and the School of Medicine, 
CERSE provides infrastructure for interdiscip linary research project design, implementation, and 
management. Staff have advanced expertise in re habilitation research desi gn, statistical analysis, 
database development, participant enrollment an d tracking, and grants management. The expertise 
of CERSE faculty and staff will be  readily available to the TBIMS.  For example, [CONTACT_473219], CERSE 
Statistical Services Director, will also serve as  the biostatistician for the present proposal.  
Interdepartmental Relationships.  One of the major strength s of our ongoing TBI research 
and clinical program is the quality  of interdepartmental and interdisciplinary relationships. This fact 
is probably best exemplified by [CONTACT_473146] y. Underlying this relationship is 
a mutual commitment to basic science, clinical research, and academic excellence. This 
commitment is evident in funding allocations th rough federal grants and pharmaceutical research 
projects. 
Excellent relationships have also  been developed with a diversity  of other medical and therapy 
departments including Psychi atry, Neurology, Physiology, Anatomy, Rehabilitation Counseling, 
Internal Medicine, Occupati onal Therapy, Speech-Language Pa thology, Physical Therapy, and 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
[ADDRESS_606402]. Kreutzer has served as the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_473047] 30 years of funding manage d through the Department of 
PM&R. J. Marwitz has served as chair or co-c hair of the TBIMS Data Committee since 2002. For 
the NDB, VCU has collected data about outcomes throughout the continuum of  care for more than 
700 research participants (for mo re information, see Appendix E, VCU Contribution to National 
Database and Continuum of Care ). Over the years, VCU has developed empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675]-based 
programs for academic and vocational reentry, co mmunity support, resilience and adjustment, 
prevention of substance abuse and neurobehavi oral dysfunction, and family/caregiver/couples 
support. Collaboration with local schools, BIAV, and DARS has helped us improve academic 
success, increase socialization opportunities, and improve commun ity integration and family 
functioning. 
VCU served as the coordination site for ne uropsychological outcome data among the Model 
Systems from 1987-1997, developi[INVESTIGATOR_473048], and 
facilitating communication between the systems. VC U also developed a test administration, scoring, 
and interpretation manual for use by [CONTACT_473147]. Preparati on of neuropsychological data 
summaries for all centers was an important respons ibility. More recently, VCU served as the lead 
for the Emotional Module of the TBIMS, lead ing a six-center, collaborative study on caregiver 
distress and satisfaction with life. In the current gr ant cycle, VCU serves as lead for the Resilience 
Module, a five-center, collaborative  study on resilience in the first ye ar postinjury. J. Kreutzer and 
J. Marwitz developed the research proposals and protocols, data collection forms, questionnaires, 
VCU TBIMS Proposal 
[ADDRESS_606403] Directors’  meetings and regular 
teleconferences, and prepared data reports and publications rela ted to the studies.  
Besides multi-center collaborative research, staff from the VCU TBIMS project have 
completed research on neurobehavior al issues, substance abuse, ba lance and ambulation disorders, 
re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], employment  outcome, family functioning, headache, and pharmacologic 
approaches to treatment of depression and seiz ures. The quality of VCU’s leadership has been 
officially recognized by [CONTACT_473148]. Every two years, the TBIMS presents an 
award for “Best Scientific Publication using th e NIDILRR TBI Model System National Database.” 
Two awards have been given to VCU (Walker and Kreutzer).43,257  
In addition to the TBIMS, the Department of PM&R has had numerous grant awards including: 
NIH-funded RO1 on Acute Neurobehavioral an d Cognitive Intervention for TBI (2008-2012), 
Virginia Incarcerated Youth with Brain Injury  Program (Commonwealth Neurotrauma Initiative, 
2009-2012), and NIH-funded TBI Clinic al Trials Network center grant (2002-2011). [CONTACT_473215] 
manages a NIDILRR-funded Advanced Rehabilit ation Research Training Grant (1987-2003, 2005-
present). In addition, [CONTACT_473223] serves as PI [INVESTIGATOR_473049] c Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium 
(CENC) jointly funded by [CONTACT_473149] (DOD) a nd Veterans Affairs (VA) for 
$62.175 million (2010-present). Clearly, VCU has a l ong and successful history of completion of

Access to Clinical Populations 
VCU provides a comprehensive continuum of car e for persons with TBI and their families. 
VCUHS is one of five Level I trauma centers in Virginia and the only one in the region. The Level I 
designation indicates the most seve re cases of TBI are treated he re. Our system of care includes 
individuals with mild, moderate , and severe injuries. Comprehe nsiveness, interdisciplinary 
communication, and integration of a continuum of services are im portant philosophies which have 
guided program development at VCU. Guided by c onsumer needs assessment s, the VCU system of 
care continues to evolve, and partnerships with  other rehabilitation agencies are growing.  
As outlined in the Research Activities  section, we will have appropr iate access to individuals 
with TBI starting in the Intensive Care Unit. Ne urosurgery nursing staff (C. Gilman, R.N.) and 
PM&R consult staff (P. McGowan, M.D.) will identif y all persons with a TBI diagnosis admitted to 
VCUHS. [CONTACT_473223] and [CONTACT_473232] both have joint appointments within McGuire VA Medical 
Center’s Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center. Drs. Cifu and Walker can ensure that McGuire 
VAMC will provide access to thei r outpatients for our proposed  site-specific project.  
A review of VCUHS records indicates that our ED receives an average of [ADDRESS_606404] are mild (admission GCS 13-15) and not admitted. Of

Year Severe Injury Moderate Injury Mild Injury Total Number 
[ADDRESS_606406] spreadsheet, “NIDILRR B udget,” details funding requested from the U.S. 
Department of Health & Human Services (DHHS). As indicated, the requested Total Direct Cost is 
$352,[ADDRESS_606407] Costs are $112,715 per year for five years, and the 
Total Costs is $464,949 per year for a cumulative total of $2,324,745. The second spreadsheet 
“Overall TBIMS Budget,” indicates effort levels for personnel with information regarding proposed
federally supported effort, VCU cost share supported effort, and Total Effort. In planning this 
proposal, funding and effort allocations were car efully considered by [CONTACT_473150]. Effort and funding allo cations reflect program activity requirements and 
timelines, staff responsibilities, and our nearly 30 years’ experience as a TBIMS center.
Cost Share:
Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) is firmly committed to supporting the proposed 
TBIMS as indicated by [CONTACT_473151] “VCU Cost Share 
Budget”. Each year, for five years, the university will contribute $182,986, a total of $914,932. The 
cost share amount equals 28% of the total amount requested from NIDILRR. The Total Budget for 
the five year project, inclusive of both federal funds and cost-shared funds, is $3,239,676.
Cost share is used entirely to support faculty effort. The VCU Cost Share budget details 
supported effort as well as cost share supported annual salary, fringe benefits, and total costs. 
Fringe benefits are calculated at the current VC U/DHHS negotiated rate of 37.2% of salaries. The
fringe benefit package includes: annual and medical leave; health, dental, and life insurance; 
workman's compensation; retirement savings; and social security. VCU will cost share $49,614
annually in fringe benefits, a total of $248,[ADDRESS_606408] Activities and Effort Allocations:
The fourth spreadsheet, “Staff Effort Allocation,” details each of the five major program
activities: (1) Administration and Dissemination; (2) National Database; (3) Resilience and 
Adjustment Intervention; and (4) Collaborativ e Module. NIDILRR has indicated that module 
VCU TBIMS Proposal
Budget Narrative
iiproject activities will be determined after the announcement of awards. The agency has required
that at least 15% of the total budget should be set aside for the Collaborative Module project. 
NIDILRR’s requirements and the resources necessary to successfully complete program activities 
have been carefully considered to determine effort allocations.
Program Income:
Any program income funds generated under this award will be utilized under the additional 
cost method as set forth at 34 CFR 74.24(b)(1), which allows the income to be used for costs which 
are in addition to the allowable costs of the project and further the broad objectives of the Federal 
statute under which the grant was made. Estimated program income for project year one will be 
approximately $3,000. We anticipate that the program income generated each year will increase as 
new products (e.g., educational guides, manuals) are produced for dissemination. Program income 
funds will be utilized to defray costs above the funding level provided by [CONTACT_32119]. In addition, 
program income funds will be expended for other cost s identified as necessary to ensure that project 
activities are completed and expanded to the greatest extent possible, furthering the objectives of 
the Federal statute of this award.
Follow-Up Data Collection Costs :
Within the grant application package, NIDILRR has requested an estimate of the costs for follow-
up data collection. Staff effort allocations for the Na tional Database are indicated on the Staff Effort 
Allocation spreadsheet. Considering effort levels, the number of patients requiring follow-up, and 
the cost of research incentives, we estimate the need for $244,265 annually, a sum of $1,269,[ADDRESS_606409] 
Coordinator. The NIDILRR Budget spreadsheet for this section provides detailed information 
regarding federally supported effort and salary. Annual salary costs of $234,776 per year are
requested, a sum of $1,173,879 over the five year funding period.

Background, Rationale and Goals
1. * Describe the study's background and what is currently known from the scientific literature, including
citations, or upload a citation list in document upload.  Use lay language whenever possible.
Though persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI) often confront a variety of long-term challenges, inpatient and
outpatient services are often limited or unavailable. Review of recent TBI Model Systems National Database reports
provides evidence that lengths of stay in inpatient rehabilitation settings have declined over the last two decades.
Professionals, family members, and survivors have been alarmed by [CONTACT_473153], restrictions, and limitations on
inpatient rehabilitation stays. Concerns have also been expressed that many survivors are discharged home with
serious problems to family members who are not adequately equipped to help. In fact, many communities do not offer
specialized outpatient rehabilitation. Where outpatient rehabilitation is available, insurance companies are often
reluctant to fund services.
In addition to the difficulties in obtaining effective care, research and clinical experience suggest that survivors
experience a wide variety of lingering injury-related challenges. For example, early on, many survivors know little about
the common consequences of injury and have trouble copi[INVESTIGATOR_472991]. Some have difficulty taking an
active role in treatment, while impatience with the recovery process is common. Diminished problem solving, emotional
regulation, stress management, and communication skills add further to the challenges of maintaining and rebuilding
positive relationships. Research suggesting that a majority of survivors experience depression and are unable to
maintain employment illustrates the breadth of struggles brain injury survivors continue to face in the long-term.
Consequently, many survivors become discouraged and struggle to maintain a positive outlook.
Clinical psychology researchers have recently turned their attention to resilience, an individual characteristic that allows
persons who experience trauma to successfully adjust, adapt, and, in many cases, thrive despi[INVESTIGATOR_473053].
Researchers have learned that resilience is not a trait, but rather a set of skills which can be developed and enhanced.
A number of studies involving children, adolescents, and adults with anxiety disorders, depression, PTSD, and learning
disabilities have demonstrated the efficacy of resilience-based interventions.
In 2012, with NIDILRR TBIMS funding, VCU researchers developed a structured C-B intervention to promote postinjury
resilience and adjustment after TBI: the Resilience and Adjustment Intervention (RAI) (Godwin et al, 2015). The
intervention development project, which was designed to address post-acute TBI needs, concerns, and challenges
(e.g., common injury effects, copi[INVESTIGATOR_472991], one’s role in recovery, problem solving, communication, and
stress management), emphasized education, skill building, and psychological support. Our investigation was also
implemented to test the feasibility of the intervention and measurement protocol. Outpatients with mild to severe TBI
were randomly assigned to either a treatment (RAI) or wait list control (WLC) group. Treatment was delivered in seven
one-hour sessions with outcome measurement pre- and post-treatment, and three months after treatment completion.
Treatment group participants showed improvement in outcomes, whereas controls did not. At three months post-
treatment, improvements were maintained relative to pre-treatment.
Important questions remain regarding the sustainability of treatment benefits. First, are treatment benefits sustained
beyond three months? Second, are there patient characteristics that predict longevity of benefits? Qualitative feedback
from research participants was carefully reviewed to provide direction for further development of the RAI. Every single
participant stated that they would recommend the program to others. However, a number of participants wanted more
sessions with additional time to focus on individual needs, suggesting that the addition of booster sessions could be of
great benefit.
By [CONTACT_108], booster sessions are follow-up sessions implemented after program completion to help maintain benefits
over time. Boosters provide an opportunity for individuals to review content, consolidate gains, and discuss challenges.
Given the high rate of cognitive impairments following TBI, booster sessions can provide an important opportunity to
reinforce learning and ameliorate the impact of memory deficits on skills acquisition. Booster sessions have been
shown to be beneficial across an array of therapy targets, including reducing anxiety and depression (Wesner et al.,
2015), improving communication skills (Braukhaus, et al, 2003) and enhancing relationship skills (Vaterlaus et al,
2012). In the only known study to utilize psychotherapy booster sessions for individuals with TBI, Ponsford and
colleagues examined the impact of modified cognitive-behavioral therapy with three booster sessions provided
between [ADDRESS_606471]-recruitment (Ponsford et al., 2016). The booster program was associated with reduced
anxiety and depression and increased psychosocial functioning.
The development and inclusion of booster sessions increases the extent to which the intervention is patient-centered.
The addition is well in line with an established literature on the additional benefits of patient-centered treatment over
and above those of standardized interventions (McMillan et al., 2013; Rathert et al, 2013). As such, patient-centered
care has been champi[INVESTIGATOR_472990] a mark of high quality healthcare by [CONTACT_473100] (Institute of Medicine,
2001) and U.S. Congress (U.S. Congress, 2010). The essence of the patient-centered approach entails eliciting as well
as mindfully and flexibly responding to the individual’s needs and preferences (Sidani et al, 2006). Patient-centered
care has been examined among persons with TBI, with positive findings showing that not only is it feasible for
individuals with compromised cognitive skills to participate in their care, they are also more satisfied with their
treatment when they do so (Pegg et al., 2005). Additional work is needed to quantify the increased benefits of patient-
centered interventions in TBI research, and the proposed project will address this knowledge gap.

2. * Describe the study hypothesis and/or research questions.  Use lay language whenever possible.
1. Primary: Participants receiving the booster (RAI+ group) will report higher levels of resilience in comparison to
individuals in the standard RAI group.
2. Participants in the RAI+ group will show better adjustment and lower levels of emotional distress as compared to
persons in the standard RAI group.
3. Additionally, participants in the RAI+ group will report greater abilities in the areas of problem solving,
communication, and stress management relative to persons in the standard RAI group.
4. A participant’s demographic, lifestyle, injury, and treatment response information will be predictive of maintenance
ability.
3. * Describe the study's specific aims or goals.  Use lay language whenever possible.
1. to evaluate the short and long-term efficacy of two structured outpatient intervention programs (RAI vs. RAI+) on
resilience
2. to evaluate the short and long-term impact of intervention on emotional well-being and postinjury adjustment with the
RAI vs. the RAI+
3. to evaluate the short and long-term impact of the RAI and the RAI+ on abilities including problem solving,
communication, and stress management
4. to determine if demographic, lifestyle, injury, or treatment response information can predict maintenance of gains
4. * Describe the scientific benefit or importance of the knowledge to be gained:
Empi[INVESTIGATOR_472984] a structured, replicable, outpatient intervention to address resilience and emotional
adjustment after TBI will guide clinicians serving individuals post-discharge, enabling more effective and efficient
service delivery. There are minimal risks (physical, psychological, social, legal, or other) associated with the project.
The possibility that some individuals may experience feelings of sadness and frustration during protocol
implementation is outweighed by [CONTACT_473086]. The VCU TBIMS places an emphasis on
providing patients with psychological support and education to assist in recovery following TBI.
5. * Describe any potential for direct benefits to participants in this study:
Participants may or may not gain any direct benefit from being in this study. They receive written information about TBI,
including available services or programs that might be helpful.
6. * Describe any potential for direct social impact in this study . For example, any engagement with specific
communities to respond to community-identified needs, or ways the study will strengthen the well-being of
the specific communities if applicable:

Intervention to Promote Survivor Resilience and Adjustment: Efficacy and Sustainability
  
Study Population
1. * Provide the maximum number of individuals that
  1. May participate in any study interaction or intervention (Including screening, consenting, and study
activities)
      AND/OR
  2. You obtain any data/specimens about (regardless of identifiability) 
 at VCU and at other sites under the VCU IRB's oversight. See the help text for additional guidance.
[ADDRESS_606472], what is the maximum anticipated number of subjects across all sites?
3. * Provide justification for the sample size by [CONTACT_52718]:
Power analyses relating to the primary hypothesis indicate minimum group sizes of 69 participants. If we allow for a
maximum of 28% attrition, then an additional 27 individuals per treatment group (54 individuals total) should be
recruited (138/(1-0.28)-138 = 53.67), yielding a sample size of 192.
4. * List the study inclusion criteria:
Individuals meeting the following:
Eighteen years of age and older.
Mild, moderate, or severe TBI defined as: damage to brain tissue caused by [CONTACT_473156], post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), skull fracture, or objective
neurological findings that can be reasonably attributed to TBI on physical examination or mental status examination.
At least [ADDRESS_606473]-TBI.
Since there is no reason to believe that treatment effectiveness varies with chronicity, no maximum has been set for
time postinjury.
5. * List the study exclusion criteria:
Active substance abusers (e.g., intoxicated at arrival to intake).
Individuals at imminent risk of psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or in imminent danger of hurting themselves or others, as
judged by [CONTACT_473], will be excluded from the study.
6. * Will individuals with limited English proficiency be included in or excluded  from this research?
Included
Excluded - safety concerns if participants are unable to communicate with the study team
Excluded - instruments/measures only validated in English
Excluded - no prospect of direct benefit to individual participants
Excluded - minimal risk study
Excluded - lack of budget/resources for translation and interpretation [provide an explanation in next question]
Excluded - other reason [provide an explanation in next question]
7. Justify the inclusion and exclusion criteria if you are either targeting, or excluding, a particular segment of the
population / community. Provide a description of the group/organization/community and provide a rationale.
Individuals with limited English proficiency are excluded, as this is a minimal risk study. Further, the intervention
involves working with an English-speaking interventionist and use of measures that have only been validated in the
English language.

Intervention to Promote Survivor Resilience and Adjustment: Efficacy and Sustainability
  
Study Procedures
  
1. * Describe the study hypothesis and/or research questions.  Use lay language whenever possible.
1. Primary: Participants receiving the booster (RAI+ group) will report higher levels of resilience in comparison to
individuals in the standard RAI group.
2. Participants in the RAI+ group will show better adjustment and lower levels of emotional distress as compared to
persons in the standard RAI group.
3. Additionally, participants in the RAI+ group will report greater abilities in the areas of problem solving,
communication, and stress management relative to persons in the standard RAI group.
4. A participant’s demographic, lifestyle, injury, and treatment response information will be predictive of maintenance
ability.
2. * Describe the study's specific aims or goals.  Use lay language whenever possible.
1. to evaluate the short and long-term efficacy of two structured outpatient intervention programs (RAI vs. RAI+) on
resilience
2. to evaluate the short and long-term impact of intervention on emotional well-being and postinjury adjustment with the
RAI vs. the RAI+
3. to evaluate the short and long-term impact of the RAI and the RAI+ on abilities including problem solving,
communication, and stress management
4. to determine if demographic, lifestyle, injury, or treatment response information can predict maintenance of gains
3. * Choose all types of recruitment materials that may be used and upload them below:
 E-mail invitations
 Phone Solicitation scripts (i.e. cold calls or random-digit-dialing)
 Flyers, Mailed Letters or Newspaper/TV/Radio Ads
 TelegRAM announcements
 Website text
 Study-specific web sites (provide the design and text)
 Social Media
 EPIC MyChart Patient Portal research study descriptions
 Psychology Research Participant Pool (SONA) study descriptions
 Scripts for announcements made to groups
 Other recruitment document
 No recruitment materials
4. * Describe the study procedures/methods for identifying and recruiting participants. Address all of the
following three aspects of recruitment in your response. 
1. Identification of potentially eligible participants or secondary data/specimens of interest.
     - What database(s) will be queried to identify secondary data/specimens
     - How VCU Informatics or VCU IRDS will be used for cohort identification (when applicable, see help text)
    - How potential participants' contact [CONTACT_52720]
2. Recruitment procedures to invite participation in the study (when applicable):
     - How each of the written or verbal recruitment materials and reminders (selected above) will be used
     - Who will contact, approach, or respond to potential participants
     - Locations where recruitment procedures will take place
     - The timing and frequency of recruitment attempts
3. Eligibility screening prior to consent and how those activities will be carried out (when applicable)
See the help text for additional guidance.
Potential subjects will be identified in several ways. Flyers advertising the study (attached) will be distributed via local
brain injury support organizations, through PM&R Outpatient Brain Injury (ACC 6) and Neuropsychology VCUHS
(Stony Point) Clinics and on VCU PM&R websites which target both brain injury clinicians (for flyer distribution) and
brain injury survivors. Flyers will direct interested patients to contact [CONTACT_473157].
Secondly, the Interventionists and other healthcare providers will take referrals from potential participants at the
Neuropsychology Clinic. Once participants have been identified and express an interest, they will either meet with the
PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a Research Assistant that day at the clinic to discuss the study, or they will be contact[CONTACT_473158].
5. * Does this study have a separate protocol document (i.e. a multisite or sponsor's protocol) that contains a
detailed description of the study's methodology?
  Yes
No
6. * Since a separate protocol document is not uploaded, describe the proposed research using language
understandable to those IRB committee members whose expertise is not scientific. The description must
include:
 1. A statement explaining the study design
 2. A detailed description of all the procedures that will be followed to carry out the study, preferably in
sequential order, and in sufficient detail that the study's methods could be replicated
 3. The schedule and frequency of when and how procedures will be conducted (e.g. in person, online, phone,
paper, etc.)
 4. A description of all research measures/tests/interventions that will be used, including analyses/tests
conducted on specimens/biological samples (if applicable)
See the help text for additional guidance
Participants will be self-referred or referred by [CONTACT_473107], organizations (e.g., Brain
Injury Association of Virginia), and agencies (e.g., Virginia Department of Rehabilitative Services). When persons with
TBI contact [CONTACT_473159]’s (PM&R’s) Neuropsychology Service regarding
the study, an intake session will be scheduled.
During the intake, the Interventionist, Research Coordinator or Research Assistant will provide information about the
research program, and determine eligibility and interest in participation. Staff will explain the study details and obtain
informed consent.
On giving informed consent, participants will complete intake assessment materials. Average estimated time for the
completion of measures is [ADDRESS_606474]-
traumatic amnesia, neurosurgical intervention, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and severity of injury (mild vs moderate-
severe).
Using randomization tables, participants will be assigned to either of two treatment groups: (1) Resilience and
Adjustment Intervention (RAI), or (2) RAI+. After randomization, a second appointment will be scheduled. All
participants will begin the 7-session treatment during their second appointment. The intervention consists of seven 60-
minute sessions scheduled over seven weeks (see attached RAI Implementation Manual). During the first session,
participants will receive an empty loose leaf binder to store and organize completed self-assessments, reading
materials, and homework assignments from each session. They will be asked to review materials and complete
worksheets between sessions. The intervention will be implemented by [INVESTIGATOR_375361], licensed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (Ph.D. level
Interventionists). Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437].
The RAI and RAI+ groups will both complete the post-treatment measures immediately after the seventh treatment
session and then 3, 4, and [ADDRESS_606475]-treatment will be completed in-
person, unless the participant requests to complete via phone.
Furthermore, the RAI+ group will complete 3 booster sessions, spaced approximately 7-10 days apart, beginning 3
months after completion of the seventh treatment session (booster sessions will occur between the 3 and 4 month data
collection described above).
Data will be analyzed to identify any therapi[INVESTIGATOR_25119], as well as treatment effects. For the RAI and RAI+ groups,
demographic, injury severity, and history information will be collected at intake using standard procedures and
protocols. All participants will complete the 4 outcome measures (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, CD-RISC; Mayo
Portland Adaptability Inventory-4, MPAI-4; [ADDRESS_606476]; and Brief Symptom Inventory-18, BSI-18) at 5 time
points (intake, post-treatment, and 3, 4 and 9 month follow-up).
The RAI is not a standard of care at VCU. Both the RAI and the RAI+ are experimental interventions. Any information
collected during the intervention sessions (e.g., questionnaires, lists generated) is part of the experimental intervention,
not part of the research data.
7. * The IRB only reviews research activities, so indicate for each of the study activities described in the question
above or in the protocol which activities are:
  - Being performed exclusively for research purposes (i.e. they would not otherwise be done apart from this
study) VERSUS.
  - Alterations of routine activities/procedures (e.g. the study is altering the timing, frequency, method,
location, amount, etc.) VERSUS.
  - Being done for other purposes and whose data/results will be used secondarily in the study (e.g. standard
medical or psychological tests, routine education practices, quality improvement initiatives, etc.).
    See the help text for additional guidance
All data is collected specifically for research purposes.
8. If applicable, describe alternatives (research or non-research) that are available to potential participants if they
choose not to participate in this study:
Potential participants will be given referral information for mental health services if they are not interested in
participating in research.
9. Upload any supporting tables or documents (e.g. protocol documents, figures/tables, data collection forms,
study communications/reminders):
Upload ALL instruments/guides that will be used or that participants will experience (i.e. see, hear, complete),
including measures, scripts/questions to guide interviews, surveys, questionnaires, observational guides,
etc,:
Upload ALL recruitment and screening materials, including such as ads, flyers, telephone or in-person scripts,
letters, email invitations, TelegRAM announcements, and postcard reminders, screening scripts, screening
forms, and screening measures:

Intervention to Promote Survivor Resilience and Adjustment: Efficacy and Sustainability
  
Project Details
An intervention includes both physical procedures by [CONTACT_52728] (e.g., venipuncture) and
manipulations of the subject or the subject's environment that are performed for research purposes.
An interaction includes communication or interpersonal contact [CONTACT_52729]. It may include in-person,
online, written, or verbal communications.
Secondary information/biospecimens are information or biospecimens that have been or will be collected for some other
“primary” or “initial” activity and that will be used secondarily in the research study.

3. * Select all types of recordings that will be made:
 Audio
 Video
 Photographs
4. * Describe the purpose of the recordings, who will be recorded and when such recordings will occur:
A protocol has been established to ensure the quality and standardization of treatment implementation across
interventionists.
Each interventionist will meet with one volunteer participant, and implement Session I of the RAI curriculum. Informed
written consent for audio-recording will be obtained. Audio recording consent is addressed within the study consent
form. Afterward, the intervention audio-recordings will be reviewed with the PI, with the manual in hand, to make
certain that all steps are completed. Additionally, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_473055], which are considered to be key elements of treatment (see uploaded RAI manual).
Strategies for improving consistency between interventionists will be discussed and implemented. Changes will be
made in the implementation manual (e.g., clarification of procedures) as needed.
The interventionist will meet again with the same volunteer participant, and implement the remaining six sessions of
the RAI curriculum. Again, the audio-recordings will be reviewed with the PI, and strategies for adherence to the
manual will be discussed and implemented after each session.
Every six months thereafter, the complete quality control procedure will be reapplied by [CONTACT_473161].
Additional quality control procedures will be implemented for booster sessions with each interventionist. Audio-
recordings will be made for the three booster sessions and reviewed with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_473056]. Every six months thereafter, quality control procedures will be repeated.
5. * Select all types of secondary information and/or specimens that apply to this study (selections will branch):

Behavioral Intervention/Task Details
This page asks for details about the social/behavioral intervention, task, or environmental manipulation in the research.
 
Interventions include both physical procedures by [CONTACT_52732]'s environment that are performed for research purposes. This might include activities such as playing computer
games, performing a task, thought/cognition activities, environmental manipulations, and educational activities.
If the study only involves surveys, interviews, or secondary data collection, go back to the Project Details page and uncheck
“Social/Behavioral interventions or experimentation / Tasks / Environmental manipulations” in Question 1.
1. * Describe the duration of the social/behavioral intervention, task, or environmental manipulation:
The intervention consists of seven 60-minute sessions scheduled over seven weeks, as well as three additional
"booster" sessions scheduled weekly 3 months after completion of the seven sessions.
2. * Describe any potential harms or discomforts that participants could experience during the intervention
activity:
Feelings of mental/emotional discomfort may arise when discussing postinjury changes.
3. * Will the intervention activity be physically invasive or painful?
  Yes
No
4. * Describe the impact the intervention activity will have on participants, including the nature and duration of
any impact(s):
Feelings of discomfort are common when stressed individuals talk about postinjury changes. However, our experience
is that people generally appreciate the opportunity to discuss their life situations. Participants will have the opportunity
to omit or decline to answer any questions. The VCU TBIMS places an emphasis on providing participants with
psychological support and education to assist in recovery following TBI. The duration of discomfort is not expected to
last longer than the duration of the session.
5. * In the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], is there any reason to think that the participants will find the intervention
activity offensive or embarrassing? Explain why or why not.
There is no reason to think that participants will find the intervention offensive or embarrassing. The emphasis is on
psychological support and education.

Compensation
It is recommended that investigators consult with VCU Procurement Services  before proposing a compensation plan
(monetary or non-monetary) to the IRB to ensure the plan will comply with VCU policies. Refer to WPP XVII-2  for the IRB’s
guidelines about compensating research participants.
1. * Describe any compensation that will be provided including:
   1. total monetary amount
   2. type (e.g., gift card, research pre-paid card, cash, check, merchandise, drawing, extra class credit)
   3. how it will be disbursed
   4. how you arrived at this amount
   5. What identifiers and tax forms will be required for compensation purposes (i.e. W-9 form, SSN, V#,
addresses, etc.)
Participants will be provided therapy, educational materials, and referral services at no cost. Each participant will
receive a total of $140. Participants will receive a payment each time measures are completed: $[ADDRESS_606477]-treatment session surveys, and $30 at each of the remaining 3 survey data time points (3, 4,
and [ADDRESS_606478]-treatment session).
If participants travel more than 60 miles roundtrip, funds will be provided to offset travel costs (IRS mileage rate of 19
cents per mile driven).
When data collection is completed by [CONTACT_648], a payment form is mailed to the participant with instructions on
completion and a postage-paid business reply envelope. Participants complete the payment form and then return the
form in the self-addressed envelope. Payment forms are then processed at VCU and a check is mailed to the
participant.
When data collection is completed in person, the participant completes the payment form and then receives cash for
their participation.
As described previously, the payment form requires the following PHI: name, social security number, address, and
phone number.
2. If compensation will be pro-rated, explain the payment schedule.

Contingency Plan
This page will be used by [CONTACT_52733]-wide emergency situation arises that requires
contingency plans. 
A contingency plan describes the alternative procedures that a study would want to use in case of an emergency that
prevented normal study activities from occurring. It is a form of adaptive protocol. It enables the VCU IRB to quickly
approve alternative study activities along with criteria for when those activities would or would not be put into effect.
For example, in 2020, some studies had a COVID-19 Contingency Protocol approved that described alternative
remote procedures that they would switch to whenever the University restricted in-person research activities.
In all studies, investigators are strongly encouraged to plan prospectively and build flexibilities into their regular
protocols (regardless of whether an emergency situation exists) as well as think about what they would do in an
emergency situation. For example, windows for timed study visits, ranges instead of exact values, flexibilities in
inclusion criteria, etc. Flexibility and adaptations that are built into the protocol will reduce the number of changes
that have to be submitted to the IRB and should reduce the number of incidents of deviations and noncompliance by
[CONTACT_431].
Further instructions and smartform questions on this page will be released from the IRB in the event of such an
institution-wide emergency situation.

Intervention to Promote Survivor Resilience and Adjustment: Efficacy and Sustainability
  
Risks, Discomforts, Potential Harms and Monitoring
1. * Describe the risks of each research procedure to participants or others. For each identified risk, provide an
assessment of the anticipated seriousness and likelihood of the risk. Some examples of possible risks include
but are not limited to:
Physical risks (e.g. bodily harms or discomforts, side effects, etc.)
Psychological risks (e.g. emotional, mental, or spi[INVESTIGATOR_52668], changes to thoughts,
beliefs, or behaviors, etc.)
Research data risks (e.g. loss of confidentiality and privacy)
Social or legal risks (e.g. impacts on relationships or reputation, legal or criminal justice actions for self
or others, etc.)
Financial risks (e.g. impacts on income, employability, or insurability, loss of services, etc.)
Other risks (e.g. unforeseeable risks of experimental procedures, risks related to particular study
designs (randomization, washout, placebo, withholding care/services, deception), etc.)
See the help text for additional guidance.
There is less than minimal risk (physical, psychological, social, legal, or other) associated with enrollment in the study.
The primary potential risk is the feeling of mental/emotional discomfort that may arise when discussing post-TBI
changes. These types of feelings may be common when stressed individuals are talking about postinjury changes.
However, our experience with data collection indicates that people generally appreciate the opportunity to discuss their
life situations. Participants will have the opportunity to omit or decline to answer any questions. The VCU TBIMS places
an emphasis on providing participants with psychological support and education to assist in recovery following TBI.
Another potential risk is a breach in confidentiality and breach in privacy with regard to data collection. The de-
identification and coding process is the safeguard in place to minimize risk of breach in confidentiality, and research
activities are completed in a private clinical setting to minimize risk related to breach in privacy
2. * Describe how each of the risks/harms/discomforts identified above will be minimized:
The research staff will pay particular attention to and attempt to minimize any risks that may occur as a result of
participation in this study. For this study, risks to subjects are less than minimal. Potential risk is mitigated in several
ways. Research staff who collect the data are well trained and very familiar with the population. The de-identification
and coding process is the safeguard in place to minimize risk of breach in confidentiality. And, research activities are
completed in a private clinical setting to minimize risk related to breach in privacy.
3. * Describe any potential risks or harms to a community or a specific population based on study findings (e.g.
information that could be stigmatizing or derogatory):
None.
4. Where appropriate, discuss provisions for ensuring necessary medical, professional, or psychological
intervention in the event of adverse events to the subjects:
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_473058]. When concerns arise, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_473059] a clinical decision regarding the need
for further evaluation, treatment, or referral.
5. * Describe criteria for when the investigator would withdraw an individual participant from the study; such as
safety or toxicity concerns, emotional distress, inability to comply with the protocol, etc.:
If the participant experiences significant emotional distress during the intervention sessions, the Interventionist may
recommend study withdrawal in order for the person to seek a more appropriate and intensive treatment for mental
health problems. Referrals will be made to the VCUHS Neuropsychology Clinic located at Stony Point. If the
participant’s emotional difficulties improve, they may return to complete the study.
6. * Summarize any pre-specified criteria that would trigger the investigator/sponsor/monitoring committee to
stop or change the study protocol due to safety concerns:
None.  
Data and Safety Monitoring
Data and safety monitoring is a system for checking the study’s data at regular intervals over the study period
to identify and address issues that could affect the safety of research participants. This requirement is in
accordance with 45 CFR 46.111.
The purpose of data and safety monitoring plan is to set forth study team procedures for
monitoring/addressing:
- Participant safety (physical, psychological, etc.)
- Data validity
- Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (termination) based upon changes in risks and benefits.
7. * Indicate if this study will have a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) or a Data Safety Monitoring Plan
(DSMP): [Required for all greater than minimal risk studies]
 DSMB
 DSMP
 No DSMB/DSMP [Note: This response is not applicable for greater than minimal risk studies]
8. * Describe your Data Safety Monitoring Plan for monitoring the study’s data to ensure the safety of
participants. This plan should include (but is not limited to) the following elements:
1. Who will monitor data
2. What data and/or processes will be reviewed
3. When and how frequently monitoring will occur
4. What report/documentation will be submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing reviews
See the help text for additional guidance.
The monitoring of this study will involve a continuous and ongoing process of reviewing the conduct of the trial,
including adherence to the study design and documentation of AEs/SAEs. The responsibility of monitoring the safety of
participants is held primarily by [CONTACT_978]. Considering that the interventions in this study carry less than minimal risk to
participants, and that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_473060]/SAEs, it is appropriate for the research team to carry the primary responsibility for monitoring.
Monitoring the Safety of Participants: A specific protocol will be used to monitor for and report AEs/SAEs. The PI, in
collaboration with the Research Coordinator, are primarily responsible for monitoring the safety of participants, in
collaboration with the study interventionists, in the following ways:
Monitor for Psychological AE (worsening depressive symptoms from one assessment time point to the next by 5 points
on the BSI-18 Depression scale with no endorsement of suicidality):
- Participants will be provided with the contact [CONTACT_473164], PI, and interventionist. They
will be advised to call with any questions or concerns or to report any unusual emotional feelings; and
- Research Assistants are trained in the definition of AE (worsening depressive symptoms without endorsement of
suicidality) and will report any obvious psychological changes in participants to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_97318].
Monitor for Psychological SAE (suicidality):
- The Research Coordinator will administer the MINI suicide module immediately to assess suicidality risk in any of the
following situations: a participant reports suicidal thoughts to study staff; and/or, a participant endorses suicidality on
the depression scale of the BSI-18 during data collection.
- If the suicide risk is low on the MINI (<8), the Research Coordinator will ask the participant to be in touch with his/her
healthcare provider for follow-up. If the participant scores high for suicide risk (9-17), the Research Coordinator will
ensure that the participant is accompanied by a family member or friend to their healthcare provider or the local
emergency department for immediate evaluation. The Research Coordinator will consult with one of the interventionists
(clinical psychologists) regarding additional questions/concerns.
In all of the above cases, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_473061]/SAE and the relatedness to
the intervention. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_473062]. If any of these events occurs and are directly
related to the intervention, the IRB and NIDILRR will be alerted.
Summary of Study Review Plan: Study progress and safety will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a monthly basis, and more
frequently if needed. Progress reports, including participant accrual, participant status and adherence data will be
provided regularly to the PI. Data about AEs/SAEs will be reported with each occurrence. As part of the IRB continuing
review, an Annual Report will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_45186] a list and summary of AEs/SAEs. In addition, the Annual
Report will address (1) whether AEs/SAEs have been severe and related to the intervention; (2) reason for dropouts
from the study; (3) whether all participants met entry criteria; and (4) whether continuation of the study is justified on
the basis that additional data are needed to accomplish the stated aims of the study.
Validity and Integrity of Data: In collaboration with the research team, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_473063], entry, and analysis. PI [INVESTIGATOR_473064], as well as protocol compliance. The frequency of data review is described below:
- Participant accrual: Review of the rate of participant accrual and compliance with inclusion/exclusion criteria will occur
monthly during the recruitment phase to ensure that a sufficient number of participants are being enrolled and that they
meet eligibility criteria.
- Participant status and Adherence data: Review of the status of enrolled participants will occur on a consistent basis
throughout the study, including data on adherence to study visits and the intervention protocol. If there are concerns
about whether adherence has reached a level that might inhibit the ability of the study to evaluate the specific aims, a
conference call will be scheduled with Scientific Advisors and the Advisory Board to discuss methods for improving
adherence.
- AEs and SAEs and rates: Review of every AE and SAE will be closely evaluated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_473065].

Privacy
Privacy refers to an individual’s right to control how others view, record, or obtain information about them. When
privacy is violated it can involve such things as
Being asked personal questions in a public setting;
Being publicly identified as having a particular characteristic or diagnosis;
Being seen entering a place that might be stigmatizing;
Being photographed, videotaped or observed without consent;
Disclosure of personal information to unauthorized people
Privacy is not the same as confidentiality because privacy protections apply to people, and confidentiality
protections apply to data. Confidentiality protections should be described on the Data Confidentiality page of this
form, not here.

to share their research information/specimens with the aim of advancing science. This page creates a plan for when
and how information/specimens could be shared.
Try to anticipate all reasonably foreseeable sharing so that the consent document can also reflect that information.
However, it is acceptable to amend this page later and explain either how re-consent of previously and currently
enrolled participants will occur or why re-consent should not be required.
The IRB reviews this page against the consent document (if one exists) to demonstrate the ethical principle of
Respect for Persons by [CONTACT_52752]/specimens.
The IRB also ensures there are adequate protections for the privacy of participants and the confidentiality of
participants' data/specimens when data is shared with others.
 
1. * Is it likely investigators could discover information about child/elder abuse or neglect that would require
mandatory reporting by [CONTACT_52753]?
The Code of Virginia requires that most medical personnel and all employees of institutions of higher
education report suspected child/elder abuse or neglect.
  Yes
No
2. *  Is it likely investigators could discover a previously unknown reportable disease or condition that would
require mandatory reporting by [CONTACT_52753] (i.e., HIV , coronavirus, hepatitis, etc.)?
  Yes No
3. * Will the sponsor or investigator obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality for this study?
Certificates of Confidentiality  (CoC) are issued by [CONTACT_7681] (NIH), the FDA and CDC to
protect identifiable research information from forced disclosure. All human subject research studies
regardless of funding can qualify to receive a CoC. A CoC is automatically issued for research that was
ongoing on December 13, 2016. or initiated after that date. For more information, see
https://humansubjects.nih.gov/coc/
No – Will not obtain CoC for this study
Yes – CoC has been obtained or issued automatically
Yes – CoC request is pending
4. * Select the way(s) that information or biospecimens (including DNA) may be used by [CONTACT_52754] [INVESTIGATOR_52673] (i.e. analyses beyond/apart from the aims of this study)?
See help text for definitions.
Will use directly identifiable information or specimens.
(‘Directly identifiable’ means that identifiers like name, medical record number, social security number, etc. are
included in/attached to the dataset/specimens. Maintaining identifiable data for future research is treated as a
registry by [CONTACT_52704]. The IRB must approve the new research use in an amendment to this study or as part
of a new study before the project is initiated. VCU IRB studies will be asked more questions about this on a later
page )
Will use de-identified or indirectly identifiable information or specimens.
(‘De-identified’ means that a linkage/key code exists that links identifiers to data/specimens. When the
researcher holds both the data and the key, the VCU IRB considers the subjects to be readily identifiable.
Maintaining identifiable data for future research uses is treated by [CONTACT_3016] a registry. The IRB must approve
the new research use in an amendment to this study or as part of a new study before the project is initiated.

Will use anonymized information or specimens.
(‘Anonymized’ means that 1) no linkage/key codes exist that link identifiers to data/specimens; and 2) subjects
cannot be readily identified, i.e. no direct or indirect identifiers or identifiable combinations of variables. The VCU
IRB considers uses of anonymized data/specimens to not be human subject research.)
Will use aggregate results (summary-level results), not individual-level information or specimens.
(The VCU IRB considers uses of aggregate data to not be human subject research because there are no
individual subjects.)
Will contribute to an existing registry or repository
(VCU IRB studies will be asked more questions about this on a later page.)
 Will not use information/specimens for purposes beyond this study.
 Not sure and will submit an amendment when known
 Other use(s) of individual-level information in a way not listed above
5. * Select the way(s) the VCU PI/study team may share information or biospecimens (including DNA) with other
researchers who are not on this study team (i.e. for analyses beyond/apart from the aims of this study). 
See help text for definitions.
Will share directly identifiable information or specimens with other researchers.
(‘Directly identifiable’ means that identifiers like name, medical record number, social security number, etc. are
included in/attached to the dataset/specimens. Maintaining identifiable data for future research uses is treated
by [CONTACT_52755] a registry. The data recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s use of identifiable data would require them to obtain IRB
review. VCU IRB studies will be asked more questions about this on a later page.)
Will share de-identified or indirectly identifiable information or specimens with other researchers.
(‘De-identified’ means that a linkage/key code exists that links identifiers to data/specimens. The VCU
researcher maintains the key but does not share it with any other researchers. The recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s use of de-
identified data/specimens may not be human subject research if there is documentation that the key will never
be shared with the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], but they should check with their own IRB about review requirements. VCU IRB
studies will be asked more questions about this on a later page.)
Will share anonymized information or specimens with other researchers.
(‘Anonymized’ means that 1) no linkage/key codes exist that link identifiers to data/specimens; and 2) subjects

Intervention to Promote Survivor Resilience and Adjustment: Efficacy and Sustainability
  
Pertinent Results and Incidental Findings
1. * Is it likely investigators could discover a participant's previously unknown condition (e.g. pregnancy,
disease, suicidal thoughts, wrong paternity, genetic results, or other findings that may be of importance to
health or well-being) or if a participant is engaging in illegal or reportable activities:
  Yes
No
2. * Describe what possible pertinent results or incidental findings stemming from research-only procedures may
be discovered.
With regard to participants' health or well-being, we will not learn of any pertinent and/or incidental findings that the
participant has not disclosed themselves.
As mentioned above, participants could share concerns about depression/suicidal ideation.
There is the possibility that research participants may, over the course of data collection, report to research staff
incidences of intent to harm others or of committing abuse.
3. * Explain what actions or procedures research personnel should take to inform the PI [INVESTIGATOR_52681] a discovery :
The research staff have resource and referral information for participants asking for medical or mental health care. If a
participant indicates severe depression or suicidal ideation, the research staff will contact [CONTACT_978]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_473066].
When concerns arise, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_473059] a clinical decision regarding the need for further
evaluation, treatment, or referral.
4. * Will findings be disclosed to participants and/or any other person/group outside of the study team?
  Yes
No
5. If pertinent and/or incidental findings will not be disclosed, explain why not:
We will not learn of any pertinent and/or incidental findings that the participant has not disclosed themselves.
In the case of participant-reported severe depression or suicidal ideation, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_473059] a
clinical decision regarding the need for further evaluation, treatment, or referral.
In the case of participants reporting child or elder abuse or intent to harm others, the consent form clearly indicates that
research staff are required to contact [CONTACT_177015].

Decisionally Impaired Adults
1. * Choose the nature of the decisional impairment participants will have:
Temporarily Incompetent to Give Consent
Permanently Incompetent to Give Consent
Unknown
2. * Explain why this population is necessary for the conduct of the study.
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a structured, curriculum-based intervention to promote post-
injury resilience and adjustment. TBI often causes physical and mental disabilities. Thus, adults with physical and/or
mental disabilities are included.
3. * Describe methods for determining whether participants are capable of providing consent or assent.
In any case where the research staff have concerns about the individual’s ability to provide informed consent, formal
assessment of decision-making capacity is made using the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool, Clinical
Research version (MacCAT-CR). This is a second-generation instrument based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_473067] (Appelbaum, 1995). It has excellent content validity, and is the only current instrument that
assesses the full range of abilities relevant to capacity for giving informed consent to participate in research (Kim,
2001). It has previously been used in persons with schizophrenia (Carpenter, 2000), depression (Appelbaum, 1999),
and dementia (Kim, 2001). Minimum values on each scale of the MacCAT-CR are established as two standard
deviations below the norms of competent persons from the community, which have previously been published. (Kim,
2001) Such an approach is commonly used in assessment of decision-making capacity (Grisso, 1995; Grisso, 1998;
Marson, 1995) and has been shown to be more stringent than expert assessment of capacity (Kim, 2001). It generally
requires 15 to 20 minutes to administer and is easily learned by [CONTACT_431] (Appelbaum, 1999; Kim, 2001).

4. * If a participant is capable of exercising some judgment concerning the nature of the study, describe how
assent will be obtained.
In cases where the patient is too impaired to consent, but family members wish for the person to participate in the
intervention, consent will be obtained by a legally authorized representative (LAR) on behalf of the patient. Assent will
then be sought from the patient. If the patient chooses not to participate, they will not be enrolled in the study.
5. Describe, if applicable, how the individuals' ability to give consent will be assessed throughout the study and
how consent will be obtained when appropriate.
At the 3, 4, and 9 month follow-ups, the Research Coordinator or Research Assistant will review the study details with
the participant. Research staff will confirm that the participant remains interested in continuing their participation. If the
individual's cognitive status improves during the course of the study, then consent will be sought. Participants may
withdraw from the study at any time.  
6. * Describe how and when consent will be obtained from participants' legally authorized representative (LAR).
For persons lacking capacity in the judgment of investigators, consent is obtained from substitute decision makers
(LAR) as allowed under Virginia law.

8. * Describe the consent procedures used for this group. Address each point below:
        - When and where consent will occur
        - What will be covered during the consent discussion 
        - How the consent discussion will occur (e.g. in-person, phone, video conference)
        - How you will reconfirm consent on an ongoing basis, if applicable
Participants will consent in the facilities housing the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Division of
Neuropsychology and Rehabilitation Psychology Research Offices, located in West Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_473070] 3rd floor.
9. * Select the processes for minimizing any potential perception of undue influence to participate, particularly
when there is a pre-existing relationship between the participant and the researcher (e.g. treatment
provider/patient; instructor/student; supervisor/employee, etc.):
Having a 3rd person (family/friends, another study team member, etc.) present during the consent / assent
discussion
Having an independent advocate (e.g. advocate for decisionally impaired adults, wards) present during the
consent / assent discussion
 Removing physical symbols of authority like white coats or police badges
 Sitting down beside the participant instead of standing over them
 If obtaining consent / assent in a clinical setting, letting patients sit instead of lie down (if they are able to)
 Moving to a more neutral location like a conference room
Obtaining consent / assent after other services/interactions have been completed (e.g. after school or the clinic
visit)
 Having a mandatory wait period for the participant to go home and think before they sign consent /assent
Sharing the consent / assent discussion between two people (i.e. a clinician might be the best person to explain
study procedures and risks, but then they could step out and let a research assistant finish the consent process)
 Other protection(s) not listed here – describe below
 N/A: Requesting Waiver of Consent
10. * Describe the other ways the study team will minimize any potential perception of undue influence to
participate:
Emphasis will be placed on the fact that participation is voluntary; that participants can refuse to answer any questions
that they choose not to answer; and that they can stop being in the study at any time. Research staff will also
emphasize that refusal to participate will not change an individual’s medical care, rehabilitation care, or any other any
other benefits received.
11. * How much time will participants be given to make a decision:
Individuals are afforded as much time as they wish to decide about participation, and they may schedule a follow-up
appointment with the study team if they wish to take the consent form home to discuss with others prior to deciding.
12. If applicable, describe the procedures for consenting children upon entering adulthood or participants who
are no longer decisionally impaired:
If the individual's cognitive status improves during the course of this study, then consent will be sought.

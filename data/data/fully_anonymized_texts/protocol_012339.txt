injections.  Preliminary efficacy (hemodynamic assessments), 
safety and tolerability will be evaluated at Baseline (screening) 
and at designated time points throughout the study. 
After the first subject in each cohort completes day 30 (± 2 
days), subsequent to day 15 dosing of the other 2 subjects in the 
same cohort, an interim safety ev aluation will be performed with 
the submission of safety data to the Data Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC).  If the DS MC recommends continuing the 
study, the next dose cohort will be  treated.  This process will be 
repeated between the second and third dose cohort and between the third and fourth dose cohort.   All [ADDRESS_1153040] in any dose group, th ree additional subjects will be 
added to the dose cohort in which the toxicity was observed.  If no additional DLTs are observed in the 6 subjects in this dose level, it will be considered the Maximum Tolerated Dose 
(MTD).  If a DLT occurs in 2/6 subjects, then the preceding dose 
level will be considered the MTD.

ViroMed Co., Ltd   02 September  2009   v:6 1  1.0 Background Information 
1.1 Peripheral Artery Disease 
Peripheral arterial disease (P AD) is a common disorder usually caused by [CONTACT_830644], resulting in ischemic limb 
disease.  Clinical manifestations of lower extremity PAD are related to the severity of 
muscular ischemia, which depends on the degree of arterial stenosis.  Intermittent 
claudication is a common, initial presentation.  Critical limb ischemia denotes a condition 
of severe arterial obstructi on due to advanced PAD, asso ciated with breakdown of the 
skin or pain in the lower lim b at rest (Appendix A).  The natural history of critical limb 
ischemia has been well documented to have an inexorable downhill course, frequently leading to the amputation of the affected li mb.  Two main etiologies of PAD are known 
as atherosclerotic peripheral arterial dis ease and thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's 
disease). 
By[CONTACT_830645] a reconstituted artery, the outcomes of 
surgery involving small-size arteries are often unsatisfactory due to a high failure rate.  Many subjects face amputation of their limb as the sole therapeutic option for the severe 
symptoms of critical limb ischemia, when PTA or by[CONTACT_830646].  Psychological testing of such subj ects typi[INVESTIGATOR_830614]-of-life indices 
similar to those of subjects with termin al cancer.  It is estimated that about 150,000 
subjects per year require lowe r-limb amputations for ischem ic diseases in the United 
States alone (corresponding statis tics is not available in Ko rea).  Their prognosis after 
amputation is even worse.  The perioperativ e mortality for below-knee amputation is 5 to 
10 percent and for above-knee amputation 15 to 20%.  Moreover, full mobility is achieved in only 50% of below-knee a nd 25% of above-knee amputees.  These 
forbidding statistics result from the lack  of efficacious drug therapy for PAD.  
Consequently, there is an urgent need for novel treatment st rategies for subjects with 
critical limb ischemia. 
1.2 Therapeutic Angiogenesis in Ischemic Limb Disease 
In subjects with ischemic limb disease, some angiogenesis occurs, creating collateral 
vessels that appear in relation to a gradually  developi[INVESTIGATOR_830615].  These new 
collateral vessels provide tissue perfusion and relieve clinical symptoms.  The term "therapeutic angiogenesis" was coined to de scribe intervention used to stimulate or 
induce neovascularization by [CONTACT_830647], either as recombinant 
protein or by [CONTACT_829312], to the ischemic sites.  Therapeutic angiogenesis represents a novel strategy for the treatment of cardiac and vascular dise ases.  Recently, hepatocyte 
growth factor (HGF) gene therapy for th erapeutic angiogenesis was introduced by 
 [INVESTIGATOR_830635]., Ltd   02 September  2009   v:[ADDRESS_1153046] rategy for treating ischemic cardiovascular 
diseases.1  
Morishita’s group first proposed a novel hypothe sis that the administration of HGF is 
effective for the treatment of PAD by [CONTACT_830648].2,[ADDRESS_1153047] asmid backbone, pCK, as VM202, and 
containing the therapeutic gene expressi ng vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF)165 protein, has been studied for the indi cation of PAD in a phase I clinical trial 
in Korea (Samsung Seoul Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and is  currently under phase II investigation.[ADDRESS_1153048] of VEGF can be enhanced by [CONTACT_830649].
9  These results demonstrate the 
concept that HGF gene can be used for sa fe and effective treatment of ischemic 
cardiovascular diseases, and that HGF gene therapy might be a more effective and safer treatment for ischemic cardiovascular diseas es, compared to gene therapi[INVESTIGATOR_830616]. 
VM202 contains a novel structure of the HGF gene as a therapeutic gene, HGF-X7.  The 
key feature of HGF-X7 is that it was designed by [CONTACT_4859] a series of intron sequences into certain sites of HGF cDNA so that bot h isoforms of HGF pr otein are expressed 
simultaneously and as efficiently as in the human genome.  Because there was no change 
in the coding region of the HGF gene, HGF proteins generated from VM202 are identical 
to the wild-type human HGF proteins.

Products 
The DNA vector used in VM202 has been studied for the indication of PAD in a Phase I 
clinical trial in Korea and is currently unde r Phase II investigation.  The Phase I study 
consisted of 3 cohorts with a total of 3 s ubjects enrolled in each cohort.  For each dose 
cohort, VMDA-3601 gene therapy was administered  as an intramuscular injection (2, 4 or 
8 mg) in two divided doses with  a 2-week interval between the injections.  An increase in 
the number of vessels and reduction in pain were observed in 7 out of 9 subjects.  The 
drug was well tolerated.  There were no serious  adverse events attributed to study drug 
administration.

developed using pCK DNA which has been safely  used in previous human clinical trials 
with VEGF as the therapeutic vector.[8]  The VM202 plasmid, also identified as pCK-
HGFX7 with 7377 base pairs, is composed of a HCMV enhancer/promoter, a growth 
hormone polyadenylation terminator sequen ce, ColE1 originator, and the Kanamycin 
resistance gene, on a pCK backbone.

For each cohort, VM202 will be administered  as either 8 or 16 local intramuscular 
injections to the affected lim b in 2 divided doses with a 2-week interval between the 
injections.  A total of 4 or 8 different injec tion sites will be arbitr arily chosen dependent 
on the dose and the location of the occluded vess els.  The location of the injections sites 
will be documented on a leg diagram provided in  the CRF.  Each injection will contain a 
maximum of 2 ml (regardless of weight) and will be injected at each site slowly for about 
20 to 30 seconds as described in Appendix D.

6.2  Study Procedures and Stu dy Procedures Chart 
Study procedures to be performed are descri bed by [CONTACT_830659] 4-1.   Prior to performing any study-related procedures, the Principal 
Investigator (or his/her designated staff) w ill obtain written informed consent from the 
subject or the subject’s legally authorized representative.  After reading the informed 
consent document, the subject must give cons ent in writing.  The subject's consent must 
be confirmed at the time of the subject’s si gnature by [CONTACT_830660].  The Investig ator will retain the 
original signed consent document.  A copy of the signed consent document will be given 
to the subject or the subject's legally author ized representative.  “Legally authorized 
representative” means an indivi dual or judicial or other body  authorized under applicable 
law to consent on behalf of a prospective su bject to the subject’s participation in the 
procedure(s) involved in the clinical study.  The Investigator will not undertake any 
measures specifically required for the clinical study until valid consent has been obtained.

7.1  Safety 
7.1.1  Medical History 
A complete medical history will be obtain ed at Baseline.  All positive and negative 
findings will be carefully documented on the CRF.  Any new finding discovered during 
the Baseline evaluation will be considered to be part of the medical history and will not 
be recorded as an adverse event. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Peripheral Vascular Intervention History 
The Investigator will perform detailed a ssessment of all past peripheral vascular 
interventions prior to study en rollment.  If the subject ha s never undergone a peripheral 
vascular intervention, then the lack of th ese events will be documented as well.  
Information will include: date(s) of intervention, type(s) of intervention (e.g., PTA, 
peripheral by[CONTACT_6476], amputation), intervention site (e.g., iliac, femoro-popliteal, infra-
popliteal; and patency of most recent interv ention prior to study start (including a 
description of the most recent vascular imagi ng if available).  Effort will be made to 
obtain sufficient information for each peripheral vascular procedure to confirm the subject’s PAD status at Baseline. 
7.1.2 Physical Examination 
The Investigator will perform a full physical examination at Baseline and at Days 15, 28, 
59, 91, 180 and 365.  All changes from the Baseline will be documented on the CRF 
pages at the time of the fo llow-up physical examination. 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Assessment of CLI 
The lower extremities will be examined specifically  for clinical evidence of CLI, such as 
ischemic rest pain, ischemic ulceration, gangrenous skin changes, or residual open 
wound(s) from minor amputation. 
Subjects will be classified as having ischemic re st pain if the pain required analgesics for 
more than 2 weeks, and includes the following clinical characteristics: 
1. Persistent or recurrent pain of the distal  portion of the leg (usu ally toes, forefoot 
or ankle), 
2. Pain begins or is increased, on elevati on of the leg and improved by [CONTACT_830663]. 
Ischemic ulceration and gangrenous skin change s are equivalent necrotizing processes for 
the purpose of this study.  In  the case of residual open w ound(s) from minor amputation, 
these will be considered ulceration(s)  for the purposes of this assessment. 
 CONFIDENTIAL 
 
ViroMed Co., Ltd          02 September  2009   v:6 30 The Investigator will assess the number of individual ulcers and/ or gangrenous tissue 
site(s) for location and size.  Excess necrotic  tissue and eschar will be removed when 
possible before taking measurements.  Photographs of each ulceration/gangrene area will 
be taken for documentation purposes only.  Two photographs of each ulceration/gangrene area will be obtained at each efficacy time point regardless of whether the area still 
contains the ulcer/gangrene, and regardless of how many doses of test material the 
subject received.  During the monitoring visit,  the monitor will retrieve one of the two 
photographs for each ulceration/gangrene area.  The border of all photographs will be 
labeled with the photograph date, subject’s initials, and the subj ect’s study number 
assignment. 
On efficacy assessment visits, the ulceration/ga ngrene area will be considered completely 
healed if assessed as having complete sk in closure without drainage or dressing 
requirements.  An ulceration/gangrene area th at heals but re-appear s and is unhealed at 
the assessment will be considered not heale d.  If the subject is discontinued from 
treatment, he/she will continue to be follo wed for ulceration/gangren e evaluations so that 
the subject’s data can be include d in analyses.  If the subject is lost to follow-up without a 
proper ulceration/gangrene evaluation, the subject will be considered not to have healed.

specific safety and other laboratory tests (tumor markers and in fection tests) required is 
provided in Table 7-1. 
7.1.4 Retinal Fundoscopy 
Proliferative retinopathy is de fined as the presence of ne w proliferating blood vessels 
(neovascularization) arising from the retin a or optic disc and growing on the retinal 
surface or into the vitreous cavity screened by [CONTACT_830664] (e.g. dilated retinal 
examination and retinal photographs) at  Baseline and Day 365.  An ophthalmology 
examination for proliferative retinopathy mu st be performed by [CONTACT_4674].  
Results from such evaluations performed within 3 months of Baseline will be accepted.

7.2.1 Hemodynamic Assessments 
[IP_ADDRESS] Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) 
Ankle-Brachial index will be obtained using standard, calibrated instruments as described in Appendix B.  The pressure in both arms with be measured, and the higher of the two 
pressures will be used.  All values will be r ecorded at each assessment in the Case Report 
Form. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Toe-Brachial Index (TBI) 
Toe-Brachial index will be obt ained using standard, calibrate d instruments as described

During the screening period the TcPO 2 will be measured at pre-defined locations on the 
anterior and posterior calf and dorsum of the foot.  The limb/chest TcPO [ADDRESS_1153092] procedures de fined by [CONTACT_438991]’s manufacturer and the written 
instructions provided by [CONTACT_830665]. 
At multiple time points prior to and af ter treatment (Days 1, 15, 28, 59, 91, 180 and 365), 
the subject will have TcPO 2 measured at pre-defined locations on the anterior and 
posterior calf and dorsum of the foot.  For analysis purposed, it is important that 
placement of the sensor used for the TcPO 2 measurement is always on the same 
pre-defined limb locations for screening and fo llow-up visits unless it is not possible (site 
amputated, areas of ulceration/gangrene).  Marking the site with  indelible ink is 
recommended.  If a sensor placement site is unavailable due to amputation or areas of

ViroMed Co., Ltd          02 September  2009   v:[ADDRESS_1153096].  AEs will be graded according 
to the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology for Adverse Events v3.0 
criteria. 
An undesirable medical condition can be symp toms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g., 
tachycardia, enlarged liver) or abnormal re sults of an investigation (e.g., laboratory 
findings, electrocardiogram). Therefore, an AE would include the following: 
• Any event that is new (i.e., was not s een prior to the start of the study). 
• A condition detected or diagnosed after the trial medication administration, even 
though it may have been present pr ior to the start of the study. 
• A pre-existing intermittent event or conditi on that recurs with increased intensity 
and/or frequency after the start of the study. 
• A pre- or post-treatment event that results from study participation (i.e., invasive 
procedures, modification of s ubject’s therapeutic regimen) 
• A change in blood pressure or  heart rate that results in discontinuation of dosage 
or that exceeds protoc ol-specified criteria 
An AE does not include the following: 
• The disease or disorder bei ng studied, or a sign or sy mptom of that disease or 
disorder, unless it is more severe than expected for the subject’s condition. 
• An overdose of the study medication if the subject is asymptomatic. 
• A medical or surgical procedure (e.g ., surgery, endoscopy, to oth extraction).  
Depending on the trial design, such a proce dure may be the result of an AE or 
may result in an AE, but is not an AE itself. 
• A pre-existing condition or disease th at does not worsen following study drug 
administration. 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22215] a pr e-existing disease or  condition that did 
not worsen or for cosmetic surgery. 
In this study an AE can include an undesira ble medical condition occurring at any time 
after screening procedures have been started until the final follow-up visit, even if no 
study treatment has been administered. 
When an adverse event occurs, the Investigator must:

2. determine the intensity of the AE;  
3. record the action taken re garding the test article; 
4. indicate whether the AE led to disconti nuation of the subject from the study; and  
5. determine if the AE is serious. 
All AEs that occur in any subject enrolled, be fore treatment, during treatment, or up to 
and including study Day [ADDRESS_1153098] be recorded 
on the appropriate CRF form provided. 
The following are definitions of levels of severity: 
• Mild:  an awareness of symptoms but easily tolerated 
• Moderate:  symptoms interfering with daily activities 
• Severe:  incapacitating, with inability  to perform normal daily activities. 
8.[ADDRESS_1153099] determine if it is a serious adverse event (SAE) according to the 
following definition. 
An SAE is an AE, occurring at any dose, which fulfills one or more of the following 
criteria:  
• An event that results in death. 
• An event that is immediately life threaten ing.  This does not include an event that, 
had it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused death. 
• An event that results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. 
• An event that is a congenital abnormality/birth defect  
• An event that requires in-subject ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_830621].  Complications that occu r during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_830622], not SAEs.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_830623], and 
does not include presentation at an emergency room. 
• An event that, though not included in the a bove list, is an important medical event 
that may jeopardize the safety of the subj ect or may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Medical and scientific judgment will be exerci sed in deciding whether a case is serious in 
those situations where important medical even ts may not be immedi ately life threatening 
or result in death, hospi [INVESTIGATOR_059], disability or incapacity.  These include events that may 
jeopardize the subject or may re quire medical or surgical in tervention to prevent one or

ViroMed Co., Ltd          02 September  2009   v:6 37 more outcomes listed in the definition of serious.  Such events will usually be considered 
as serious.  Examples of such events are: 
• Angioedema not severe enough to requir e intubation but requiring intravenous 
hydrocortisone treatment 
• Hepatotoxicity caused by [CONTACT_830666] (acetaminophen) overdose requiring 
treatment with N-acetylcysteine 
• Intensive treatment at the study site, in  an emergency room, or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm 
• Blood dyscrasias (e.g., neutropenia or anem ia requiring blood transfusion) or 
convulsions that do not re sult in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• Development of drug dependency or  drug abuse (e.g., analgesics). 
8.3   Laboratory AEs and SAEs 
Abnormal laboratory findings (e.g., serum ch emistry, hematology) or other abnormal 
assessments (e.g., ECGs, vital signs) that are j udged by [CONTACT_830667], 
as defined in Sections 0 and 8.2, respectively.  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory 
or other assessment findings that are detected  following study drug ad ministration or that 
are present at Baseline and worsen following the start of the study constitute AEs or 
SAEs.  The Investigator will exercise clini cal judgment in deciding whether an abnormal 
laboratory finding or other abnormal a ssessment is clinically significant. 
8.4     Detection of AEs and SAEs: Method, Frequency, and Time 
Period 
The methods of detection for AEs and SAEs include, but are not limited to, the use of 
non-leading verbal questioning of the s ubject (e.g., how do you feel?), clinical 
observation by [CONTACT_80476], physical exam inations, monitoring of vital 
signs, or laboratory assessments. 
AEs will be recorded for each subject from the time the subject signs the informed 
consent form through the subject’s final follow- up visit.  AEs and SAEs that result from 
study participation and occur prior to the start of the study drug will be recorded. 
8.[ADDRESS_1153100]’s  medical records and 
on the AE page of the CRF, even if the AE is considered by [CONTACT_830668].  SAEs that occur during the study must be documented in the subject’s medical record, on the AE page of the CRF, and on the SAE 
Report Form. 
 CONFIDENTIAL 
 
ViroMed Co., Ltd          02 September  2009   v:6 38 A separate SAE CRF will be used for all SAEs.  For SAEs which are related and within a 
specific time period, a single form can be used.  An assessment of the relationship of each 
event to the study therapy will be added fo r each SAE on the form.  Following initial 
reporting of the event, the Inve stigator will make every effort  to establish a diagnosis of 
the event based on the presenting signs, sympto ms, and/or other clinical information.  In 
such cases, the diagnosis will be documented as the AE and/or SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms. 
Death will not be reported as a serious adve rse event.  Death will be reported as the 
outcome of the event.  When a subject expi[INVESTIGATOR_1312] s, please use the cause of Death (acute MI, 
CVA, sepsis) as the SAE and the outcome as Death.  When no cause of Death is 
apparent, please use cardio-pulmonary arrest as the SAE.   
If a clinically significant, abnormal labor atory finding or other abnormal assessment 
meets the definition of an AE or SAE, then  the AE page of the CRF and the SAE Report 
Form must be completed, as appropriate.  A diagnosis, if known, or clinical signs and 
symptoms if the diagnosis is unknown, rather than the clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory finding, will be recorded on the AE page of the CRF and on the SAE Report Form, as appropriate.  If no diagnosis is known and clinical signs and symptoms are not 
present, then the abnormal finding will be record ed.  If an isolated laboratory abnormality 
is an SAE, then the following will be performed: 1) the laboratory data will be recorded 
in the SAE Report Form with the reference range and all preceding measurement(s) 
value(s), including Baseline va lue(s), and 2) copi[INVESTIGATOR_830624]. 
The SAE CRF used to report an SAE will be completed as thoroughly as possible and signed by [CONTACT_830669].  The Investigator must provide 
the relationship of the event to the study drug (assessment of causality to the trial 
medication), action taken with the study drug and outcome (i f known) at the time of the 
initial report.  SAE CRFs will be  sent via Datafax to:  [PHONE_17308]. 
8.[ADDRESS_1153101] to follow-up.  The I nvestigator is responsible to 
ensure that follow-up includes any supplementa l investigations as may be indicated to 
elucidate as completely as possible the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE.  This 
may include additional laboratory tests or i nvestigations, histopathological examinations, 
or consultation with other health care prof essionals.  ViroMed or their designee may 
request that the Investigat or perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations.  If a subj ect dies during participation in the study or

document in the subject’s medical records the re peated attempts (at least 3) to contact [CONTACT_285927]/or his/her care provider to retrieve the info rmation; documentation will 
include date and mode of communication.  In th e case of “lost to follow-up.” the event is 
considered as ongoing. 
8.7   Immediate Reporting of SAEs 
ANY SERIOUS AE THAT OCCURS DURING THIS INVESTIGATION (SEE 
SECTION 8.2.), WHETHER OR NOT RE LATED TO THE STUDY MEDICATION, 
MUST BE REPORTED IMMEDIATELY  TO THE SPONSO R AND/OR THE 
DESIGNATED CRO. 
The reporting timeframes and the required documentation for any SAE occurring during 
the study are summarized in Table 2. 
In the event of an AE leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1916], every effort will be made by [CONTACT_830670] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458]. In the event of a fatal AE, documentati on of any available postmortem findings,

having first protected any ul cer that may be present 
2. Examine the foot, locating the dorsalis pedi s or anterior tibial pulse and apply 
contact 
3. Continue as for the brachial pressure, recording this pressure in the same way

any ulcer that may be present.  If the 1s t toe is unavailable you may use other toes 
if appropriate 
2. Examine the toe with the Doppler or photoplethysmograph (PPG), locating the 
pulse and apply contact

Problems and errors may arise if: 
1. The cuff is repeatedly inflated or inflated for long periods.  This can cause the 
ankle pressure to fall 
2. The cuff is not placed at the ankle 
3. Ankle systolic pressure is not measured, pr essure recorded is usually higher than 
ankle pressure 
4. The pulse is irregular or the cuff is deflated too rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]

Protocol Synopsis: Study Design (C)  
Formerly: After  all subjects in the first dose cohort 
have completed the 30-day (± 2 days) follow-up visit 
following the 1st dose of study drug,  an interim safety 
evaluation will be performed with the submission of 
safety data to the Data Safety Monitoring Committee 
(DSMC). If the DSMC recommends continuing the study, the second dose cohort will be treated. 
 Modified to:  After  the first subject in each cohort 
completes day 30 (± 2 days), subsequent to day 15 
dosing of the other 2 subjects in the same cohort, an 
interim safety evaluation will be performed with the submission of safety data to the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC).  If the DSMC 
recommends continuing the study, the next dose cohort 
will be treated. 
 xii The cumulative 
safety of VM202 demonstrated in the first 2 cohorts allows 
advancement to

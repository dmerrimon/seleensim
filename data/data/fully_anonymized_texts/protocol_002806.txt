Title:  A Randomized Double -Blind Phase  1b/2 Combined Staggered 
Multiple Dose Escalation Study of BOS161721 in Systemic Lupus 
Erythematosus (SLE) Patients on a Background of Limited Standard 
of Care .  
Indication  Adults with moderately to severely active SLE  
Background 
and 
Rationale  SLE is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease with considerable 
heterogeneity in clinical manifestations and disease course . There is 
evidence that B - and T -cells are critical to the development of the 
disease, and that T -cell-derived cytokines such as interleukin -21 
(IL-21) are involved in the SLE -associated inflammatory pathological 
response .  
BOS161721 is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1)  triple 
mutation monoclonal antibody (mAb) intended to have an extended 
terminal elimination half-life (t½) that selectively binds to and 
neutralizes  IL-21, which acts on multiple cell types that drive  
inflammation and autoimmunity . In vivo, BOS161721 inhibi ts T-cell 
dependent antigen responses of B -cells and is being developed as a 
potential  treatment for adult s with moderately to severely active SLE .  
Nonclinical studies have evaluated  the toxi city, pharmacodynamics 
(PD), toxicokinetics (TK), pharmacokinetics (PK) , and 
immunogenicity of BOS161721 administered intravenously (IV) and 
subcutaneously (SC) . The no observed adverse effect level 
(NOAEL) in Cynomolgus monkeys was determined to be 100  mg/kg 
(SC and IV) , the highest dose tested . There were no injection site 
reactions in animals dosed subcutaneously .  
In a phase  1 single ascending dose (SAD) study, BOS161721 was 
administered IV and SC to healthy male and female adult subjects . 
This double -blind, placebo -controlled study evaluated 8 ascen ding 
dose levels  (1 [IV], 3 [SC], 10 [SC], 22 [IV], 30  [SC], 60 [SC], 
120 [SC], or 240  [SC] mg) for safety, tolerability, PK, PD and 
immunogenicity . Overall, there were no clinically significant safety or 
tolerability findings from this study .  
Results fro m the phase  1 SAD study informed  the dose regimens 
used for the multiple ascending doses (MAD) phase  1b portion of  
this trial. The MAD portion will involve  3 cohorts . The phase  2 
portion will be a proof of concept (POC) part, where dose selection 
will be based on the data monitoring committee ( DMC ) and 
sponsor ’s assessment of safety, tolerability, immunogenicity , and PK 
and PD data from the MAD portion of 30 patien ts treated with 
BOS161721 /placebo . The purpose of the study is to establish a safe 
and effective dosage for adult patient s with moderately to severely 
active SLE.

Protocol Date and Version: 30 April  2020; V7.[ADDRESS_380392] of 
3 cohorts, with Cohort  1 containing 6 patient s, where 5 of these 
patient s will receive BOS161721 (a ctive), and 1 will receive placebo . 
Cohorts 2 and 3 will each contain 12  patient s, including 9 active and 
3 placebo patient s. Dose selection for each cohort is based on 90  
day safety, tolerability, PK , and PD data review from the phase  1 
SAD study  (BOS161721 -01) in healthy subjects . Each of the 
3 doses  (20, 60, and 120 mg) selected for the MAD portion are 
projected not to exceed the mean exposure of that achieved in the 
SAD study  following the single  [ADDRESS_380393] completed 2 weeks of 
follow -up after the second dose,  Cohort 2 begins dosing (after the 
DMC evaluat es the safety and tolerability data from Cohort 1). 
Similarly, after [ADDRESS_380394] into the POC part of the  study . 
This dose will not exceed doses tested during the MAD portion .  
For the POC portion , approximately 110 additional  patient s will be 
randomized to active or placebo groups in a 2:1 ratio. As in the MAD 
portion , each patient  in the POC portion  may receive a total of 7 SC 
monthly doses on Days  0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150,  and 180 .  
A maximum stable (for at least 6  weeks prior to Day  0) daily dose of 
30 mg/day of oral CS will be acceptable for eligibility for the study . 
One oral CS “burst ” for increased SLE disease activity may occur  
during the study  between Day 0 and Day 120. Tapering of stero ids 
during the course of the study will be highly encouraged and should 
be evaluated during the protocol -allowed  tapering windows ( Day 0 
through Day 150) with the target of achieving a CS daily dose 
of ≤ 7.5 mg and < Day [ADDRESS_380395] be held 
constant due to the Day 210 endpoint evaluations .  
DMC safety reviews  will be conducted periodically throughout the 
study as described in the DMC charter .

Statistical 
Consideratio
ns Below is a summary of the statistical methods . Further details can 
be found in Section  8.  
Two analyses are planned : 1) an interim analysis to select the POC  
dose based on the MAD  data; and 2) a final analysis at study 
completion . Additionally, DMC safety analyses will be performed for 
each MAD  cohort and throughout  the POC  to monitor patient safety  
as described in the DMC charter . An additional analysis may be 
performed for the MAD portion of the study when all MAD  patients 
have co mpleted the  safety follow -up, or withdrawn from the study , 
and prior to the final analysis . Data from the POC part of the study 
will be excluded from this additional analysis .  
Unless stated otherwise, statistical testing will only be performed on 
the POC  data and will be done using 2-sided overall alpha of [ADDRESS_380403] 
deviations  (SD), 25th and 75th percentiles , mini mum , median,  and 
maximum . Counts, m edian s, 25th and 75th percentiles, and standard 
error will be presented for time -to-event data .

1.1 Indication  
BOS161721 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) , which binds to and inhibits 
interleukin -21 (IL -21) bioactivity, and is being develope d for the treatment of moderately 
to severely active systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) in adults .  
1.2 Background  and Rationale  
1.2.1  Overview of the Disease State  
SLE is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that has variable manifestations in 
multiple organ systems  and follows a r elapsing and remitting course . The disease 
process includes  abnormal immune responses mediated by [CONTACT_59627] -binding 
autoantibodies and immune complex deposition , giving  rise to tissue damage often 
resulting in end organ disease and even mortality . Survival of SLE has improved due t o 
earlier detection , improved overall medical care,  and standardized  SLE treatment with 
corticosteroi ds (CS), immunosuppressants, and cytotoxic agents .[ADDRESS_380414] c ommon cause of death during later disease .2  
The reported prevalence of SLE in the [LOCATION_002] (US) is 20 to 70 cases  per 
100,000 people .3 More than 90% of cases of SLE occur in women, frequent ly starting at 
childbearing age . Women of color  are disproportionately affected by [CONTACT_113919] . This suggests 
multiple genetic and environmental factors are at play . Accordingly, a  multifactorial view 
of the immunopathogenesis of SLE suggests more than [ADDRESS_380415], including

[LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals is developi[INVESTIGATOR_310031]161721 for the treatment of SLE. 
BOS161721 is a humanized immunoglobulin  G1 (IgG1)  mAb with extended half -life 
directed against human  IL-21.  
Murine mAb  19E3, the progenitor of BOS161721, was generated using mouse 
hybridoma technology .19E3 has subpi[INVESTIGATOR_36379]  (pM) affinity to human IL -21 and was 
selected f or its potent neutralization of IL -21 bioactivity . BOS161721 was generated by 
[CONTACT_310148] 19E3 where its complementarity -determining regions were 
grafted onto a human IgG1 kappa backbone . The fragment crystallizable (Fc) portion of 
BOS161721 co ntains a YTE (M252Y/S254T/T256E triple mutation) in the constant 
domain of the IgG1 heavy chain that was introduced into the parental molecule, 19E3, 
intended to prolong the in vivo  terminal elimination half -life (t½) of the mAb .5 Thus,

BOS161721 binds to human IL-21 and Cynomolgus monkey IL -21, which are highly 
homologous , and neutralizes the bioactivity of both . BOS1617 21 is specific for IL -21 as 
it does not bind to or inhibit the other gamma -chain (γc) family  of cytokines , and acts to 
specifically neutralize the IL -[ADDRESS_380416] . In in vitro  studies, BOS161721 inhibited 
downstream IL -21-induced signaling, IL -21-induced pla sma cell differentiation , and

[IP_ADDRESS]  Preclinical Studies  
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of BOS161721 were characterized following single -dose 
intravenous (IV) administration of BOS161721 (0 .01 to 30  mg/kg) in male Cynomolgus 
monkeys or repeat, every 2  weeks IV administration (15 to 100  mg/kg) and 
subcutaneous (SC) administration (50  mg/kg) in male and female Cynomolgus 
monkeys . Systemic exposure was approximately dose -proportional within the tested 
dose range . SC bioavailabili ty was determined to be 64 .3%.  
.  
Two single -dose (IV) non -good l aboratory practice (GLP) studies conducted in 
Cynomolgus monkeys evaluated the toxicity, pharm acodynamics (PD), toxicokinetics 
(TK), and immunogenicity of BOS161721 . Following a single IV administration (slow 
bolus), there were no BOS161721 -related adverse changes, resulting in a no -observed -
adverse -effect -level (NOAEL) value of 30  mg/kg, the highe st dose tested among

BOS161721 -01 was a double -blind, phase  1, single ascending dose (SAD) study to 
assess the safety, PK , and PD of BOS161721 in healthy subjects . The primary objective 
of the study was to characterize the safety and tolerability of IV and SC SADs  of 
BOS161721  in an otherwise healthy subject population without concomitant illnesses, 
immune abnormalities , or concomitant medications . Secondary objectives include d 
characterization of the PK and immunogenicity of BOS161721, and exploratory 
objectives included the e valuation of the effect of BOS161721 on TDAR to keyhole 
limpet hemocyanin ( KLH) (primary and secondary immunizations) in healthy subjects, 
the effects of BOS161721 on plasma levels of IL -21 (free and bound) , and the 
evaluation of the effect of BOS161721 on IL-21 gene expression (via gene signature) in 
blood . This study consist ed of 8 cohorts . Subjects were  randomized in a 3:1 ratio 
(BOS161721:  placebo) and receive d either a single dose of BOS161721 (1  [IV], 3 [SC], 
10 [SC], 22 [IV], 30 [SC], 60 [SC], 120  [SC],  or 240  [SC] mg) or placebo , with safety 
follow -up. For the first cohort, after the first 2  subjects we re dosed (1  active and 
1 placebo), there was a minimum gap of [ADDRESS_380422] 7  days of safety and tolerability data by [CONTACT_310153] 
(SDMT) .  
Blood samples were collected at every in -house study visit for BOS161721 
concentration determinations . Blood samples were also collected for determination  of 
IL-21 plasma  levels (free and total) . Safety was assessed based on the occurrence of 
treatment -emergent AEs, hepatic function abnormality,  and acute and delayed 
hypersensitivity reactions . Other safety variables include d ECGs, vital signs (blood 
pressu re [BP], heart rate , and temperature), safety laboratory assessments, blood 
sampling for ADAs, total IgG and immunoglobulin M ( IgM) levels,  CD4+ count , and full 
and targeted physical examinations . Overall, there were no clinically significant findings 
from this study . Adverse event s reported as related to the study drug, particularly 
infections, were expected for the compound, and there were no clinically relevant 
changes in laboratory  and ECG  results or vital signs . There was 1  serious adverse 
event ( SAE; death  due to pulmonary embolism ) that occurred 127  days after a single 
administration of 240  mg SC dose of BOS161721 . The causality of this single SAE was

The benefit of participation for all patient s in this study is close monitoring of their 
medical condition and safety of their treatment . Those randomized to the active 
treatment arm may potentially experience improvement in their  SLE disease . Those 
randomized to the placebo (in combination with standard of care) arm are not expected 
to obtain any additional benefit, beyond those of their background treatment, though 
close monitoring of their medical condition and safety may itself be asso ciated with 
improving their SLE .  
1.2.5  Potential Risks  
Potential risks based on the m echanism  of action of  BOS161721 include inf ections, 
risks associ ated with the administration of  any foreign protein or  biologic agent, 
including injection site r eaction, anaphylaxis, serious allergic reaction, and development 
of ADAs. ADAs  could r esult in immune complex disease (with mani festations su ch as 
arthralgias, s erum-sickn ess, and v asculitis), or altered BOS161721 lev els or activity. 
Further details can be found in the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for BOS161721, 
which contains comprehensive toxicology, preclinical and clinical information on 
BOS161721 .

Clinical Study  Protocol : BOS161721 -02 
Protocol Date and Version: 30 April  2020; V7. [ADDRESS_380428] . No potential risk generalizable across the class has been observed with these 
investigational products . Based on the clinical phase  1 SAD study (BOS161721 -01), 
AEs reported as related to the study drug, particularly infections (flu -like symptoms, 
etc.), were expected for the compound, and there were no clinically relevant changes in 
laboratory and ECG results or vital signs .  
The majority of IgG elimination oc curs via intracellular catabolism, following fluid -phase 
or receptor -mediated endocytosis . This type of endocytosis and elimination is a form of 
target -mediated disposition where the interaction of the drug and its pharmacological 
target ( e.g., a target re ceptor) serves as a significant contributor to the kinetics of 
antibody distribution and elimination . Renal elimination, which is a primary pathway of 
clearance of small -molecule drugs, is relatively unimportant for IgG, as its large size 
prevents efficien t filtration through the glomerulus . Secretion into the bile is an important 
pathway of elimination of IgA antibodies, but this route is not a significant contributor to 
the elimination of IgG antibodies . Thus, risk to renal and hepatic systems due to 
meta bolism of BOS161721 is low .33 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Anaphylaxis and Serious Allergic Reactions  
As with the administration of any foreign protein and/or other biological agents, acute 
hypersensitivity reactions, including acute anaphylactic/hypersensitivity, severe allergic, 
and anaphylactoid reactions may follow infusion of mAbs and can be caused by [CONTACT_62665] . These acute hypersensitivity reactions may be severe and result in death .  
Anaphylaxis will be defined according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectiou s 
Diseases/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (NIAID/FAAN) criteria ,34 and are 
discussed in Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 .  
Based on the phase  1 SAD study (BOS161721 -01), anaph ylaxis and serious allergic 
reactions in subjects who received BOS161721 was not observed .  
Patients with a known history of allergy or severe hypersensitivity reaction to any 
component of BOS161721 formulation or patients with a history of anaphylaxis to any 
other biological therapy such as mAbs will be excluded from studies with BOS161721 . 
In addition, appropriate drugs and medical equipment to treat acute hypotensive, 
bronchoconstrictive, or anaphylactic reactions will be immediately available at the uni t 
and study personnel will be trained to recognize and treat these reactions .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Injection Site Reactions  
In a repeat -dose GLP toxicology study in Cynomolgus monkeys, BOS161721 was 
administered every 2  weeks by [CONTACT_310154] 3  months (a total of 7  doses) . There were 
no injection site reactions in animals dosed subcutaneously . Further, there were no 
reports of inj ection site reactions in the 26 -week GLP toxicology study in Cynomolgus 
monkeys .

Confidential   Page 37 of 130 Based on the phase  1 SAD study (BOS161721 -01), incidence of injectio n site reactions 
in subjects who received BOS161721 was similar  to placebo .  
Patients will be monitored for local injection site reactions in this study  (see 
Section  6.2.7 ).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Immune Complex Disease  
The potential risk of immune complex disease for BOS161721 is theoretical, based on 
the known risks associated with mAbs . The administration of a mAb can result in th e 
formation of ADAs . Administration of the mAb in the presence of ADA may result in the 
formation of circulating antibody -antigen complexes potentially resulting in altered 
BOS161721 levels or activity or deposition of the complexes in microvasculature . 
Complement is frequently involved in the latter setting, and the breakdown products of 
complement attract polymorphonuclear leukocytes to the site of deposition where they 
can provoke local tissue damage through specific or nonspecific release of enzymes . 
Two of the more common end -organ targets are the blood vessels (vasculitis) and 
kidney (nephritis) . These clinical manifestations represent immune complex disease or 
Type III hypersensitivity . Although BOS161721 is a humanized mAb, ADAs may 
develop; however,  the likelihood of occurrence of immune complex disease with 
BOS161721 is low . The findings of immune complex disease are typi[INVESTIGATOR_310032] -antigen complexes are cleared from 
the body .  
Based on the phase  1 SAD study (BOS161721 -01), immune complex disease in 
subjects who received BOS161721  was not observed .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Infections  
BOS161721 is expected to diminish the activity of T -cell, B -cell and NK -cell lines . Like 
other medications modulating immune response, BOS161 721 may increase the 
potential risk for infection, including serious infections . IL-21 produced by [CONTACT_398]4+ T-cells 
is required to sustain the anti -viral function of CD8+ T -cells against chronic viral 
infections . Nonclinical evidence suggests that the risk of chronic viral infection 
recurrence or increased severity may occur with IL -21 inhibition .35 
These conditions will be fully characterized with clinical descriptions and routine 
laboratory and/or specialty testing and treated where indicated with appropriate local 
standard of care .  
Patients with a history of opportunistic infection, including recurrent or severe  
disseminated herpes zoster or disseminated herpes simplex  within the last 3 years , or 
any other underlying pathology predisposing to serious infection, are excluded from 
studies with BOS161721 (for further details please refer to the current IB for 
BOS161721) .  
Patients will be assessed for hepatitis B, and C, and HIV-1/2 combination , at screening .  
BOS161721  [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc  
Clinical Study  Protocol : BOS161721 -02 
Protocol Date and Version: 30 April  2020; V7. [ADDRESS_380429] been observed in 
immunosuppressed liver transplant and human immunodeficiency virus patients .36,37 
Since BOS161721 is ex pected to diminish the immunosurveillance activity of T -cell, 
B-cell, and NK -cell lines, a similar risk is biologically plausible with prolonged exposure 
to BOS161721 .  
Since the risk of opportunistic cryptosporidium infection increases with low levels of 
CD4+  T-cells,37 patients with a CD4+ count  < 500 cell/mm3 were excluded from the 
phase  1 SAD study (BOS161721 -01). Patients with CD4+ count  < 350 cells/mm3 and 
CD4+ count  < 150 cells/mm3 will be excluded from the MAD and POC parts of the 
study, respectivel y. Patients exposed to investigational product who develop diarrhea 
during the course of the study should immediately undergo an assessment for 
opportunistic infection including stool for ova and parasites and stool examination for 
cryptosporidium. Positiv e cryptosporidium in stool sample at screening is an exclusion. 
Treatment by [CONTACT_310155].  
Based on the phase  1 SAD study (BOS161721 -01), infections in subjects  who received 
BOS161721  was not observed .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Malignancy  
The stimulatory effect of IL -21 on NK cells and CD8+ T -cells suggests the cytokine may 
have anti -tumor activity . Nonclinical studies have demonstrated significant anti -tumor 
effects of IL -21 in a number  of tumor models . IL-21 therapy of human metastatic 
melanoma and renal cell carcinoma has demonstrated POC with significant increases in 
levels of perforin, granzyme B, and interferon gamma (IFNγ) expression in CD8+ T -cells 
and NK  T-cells. Clinical respons e has been limited in these generally unmanageable 
diseases .  
The impact of treatment with anti -IL-21 therapy on the development or growth of 
malignancies is not known; however, as with other immunomodulatory biologic agents, 
treatment with BOS161721 may r esult in an increase in the risk of malignancies . NK cell 
suppression by [CONTACT_8668] -[ADDRESS_380430] 5 years , with the exce ption of  non-melanoma skin c ancer or cervical cancer in 
situ treated with apparent suc cess wi th curative therapy, are excluded from the stud y.  
Based on the phase  1 SAD study (BOS161721 -01), malignancy  in subjects who 
received BOS161721  was not observed .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hepatic Function Abnormality

function abnormality . However , as a precaution, p atients with a history of abnormal

hepatitis B or C test or a history of alcohol dependence will also be excluded .  
Based on the phase  1 SAD study (BOS161721 -01), hepatic function abnormality in 
subje cts who received BOS161721 was not observed .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Failure of Vaccination  
IL-21 is a key cytokine in development of B -cells into immunoglobulin -secreting plasma 
cells. Abnormal signaling through the IL -21R/Janus Kinase (JAK)3/signal transducer 
and activator of transcription (STAT3 ) pathway leads to defective humoral immune 
responses to both T -dependent and T -independent antigens and impairs the 
establishment of long -lasting B -cell memory . Abnormal signaling through the pathway 
has been related to decreased speci fic antibody responses following vaccination, and to 
increased susceptibility to encapsulated bacterial infections .[ADDRESS_380431] of BOS161721 was evaluated in in vivo  single dose studies in Cynomolgus 
monkey in which the animals received vaccination to T -cell dependent KLH antigen to 
stimulate a TDAR . These in vivo  studies demonstrated that BOS161721 significantly 
inhibited B -cell proliferation and IgG antibody responses to the KLH protein antigen in a 
dose -dependent fashion; however,  BOS161721 administratio n did not affect anti-
tetanus toxoid  antibody data for IgM, IgG, IgG1, or immunoglobulin E ( IgE) during the 
dosing phase in the same study .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Potential for Drug -Drug Interactions  
Drug -drug interactions were not evaluated in the phase  1 SAD study (BOS161721 -01), 
which included only healthy adult subjects . Use of prescription medications (with the 
exceptions of oral contraceptives), and over -the-counter (OTC) treatments including 
herbal supplements such as St John’s Wort (except multivitamins), in the 2 weeks prior 
to screening was prohibited  in the SAD study .  
See Section 4.5 for other specific exclusion criteria which support lowered risk of 
interactions, and Section 4.6.1  for corticosteroid ( CS) dosing . In addition, 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  describes considerations for hepatic function for this study .

Protocol Date and Version: 30 April  2020; V7. 0 
Confidential   Page 44 of 130 Dose s selected for each of the 3  cohorts  is based on a 90 day safety, tolerab ility, PK 
and PD data review  from the phase  1 SAD study  (BOS161721 -01) in healthy subjects . 
All doses selected for the MAD part of the study are projected not to exceed the mean 
exposure of that achieved  at the highest dose  in the SAD  study .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Escalation  for the MAD  Portion   
The MAD portion of the study design is staggered , where after the  [ADDRESS_380434] completed 2 weeks of follow -up after the second dose, 
Cohort  2 begins dosing (after the DMC evaluation of  the safety and tolerability data from 
Cohort  1). Similarly, after  [ADDRESS_380435] completed 2 weeks of follow -up after the second dose, Cohort  3 begins dosing 
after the DMC evaluation of the safety and toler ability data from Cohort s 1 and 2. Each 
cohort will continue at their assigned dose level through the ir respective  6-month 
treatment period s (see Study Schematic, Section  3.3). If patients discontinue the study  
in a cohort  prior to adequate safety follow -up, he/she  may be replaced .  
Criteria for dose escalation are further described in the DMC Charter . See 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  for additional details  about DLTs .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Limiting T oxicity (DLT)  
Severity of adverse events will be graded according to National Cancer Institute 
Common Termi nology Criteria for Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE ) version  4.03. For the 
purpose of dose escalation, any of the following AEs occurring after study drug 
administration, which are attributable to the study drug, will be considered DLTs:  
Hematologic:  
 Grade 4 neu tropenia  
 Grade 3 neutropenic infection  
 Grade 3  thrombocytopenia with bleeding  
 Grade 4 thrombocytopenia  
Non-Hematologic:  
 Grade [ADDRESS_380436] medical 
therapy ( e.g., anti-emetics, anti -diarrheals)  
 Drug -induced liver injury  ([DILI], Hy’s Law), as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS].3  
Investigators should always manage their patients according to their medical judgment 
which may include interruption  of study drug  based on the particular clinical 
circumstances .

Confidential   Page 45 of 130 [IP_ADDRESS]  DMC Recommendations   
During scheduled meetings, the DMC will review relevant study data for safety or 
benefit -risk concern . During the MAD part of the study, t he DMC may provide the 
following  recommendation s to the sponsor : 
 Expanding a cohort at a specific dosing level, or repeat ing a lower dose  in a 
subsequent cohort  
 Continuing a dose level for a given cohort  
 Escalating a dose  level for a subsequent cohort  
 Termination of current or previous cohort(s)  
Further dosing in a given cohort will be halted if [ADDRESS_380437] into the POC 
phase  2 part of the study . This POC dose decision will be based on evaluation of the 
PK, safety (inclusive of dose -limiting toxicity [DLT]), and tolerability data (and available 
PD/biomarker data) from Cohorts 1, 2, and 3; this dose will not exceed doses tested 
during the MAD portion . The DMC will be reviewing all relevant data from Cohorts 1, 2, 
and [ADDRESS_380438] 
dose . Details are provided in the DMC Charter .  
3.1.2  POC  Phase 2   
[IP_ADDRESS]  BOS161721 POC Dose Selection and Justification  
The dose  for the POC portion of the study is 120  mg administered SC monthly (a tot al 
of 7 doses) . The rationale for the BOS161721 -02 phase  2 POC dose selection was 
based on cumulative safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, PK , and PD data available 
from an interim analysis (IA) performed during the M AD phase  1b portion  of the trial .  
The data cut -off for this IA occurred on  and included all 6  patients 
and 7  doses from Cohort  1 (20  mg), 12  patients and 6  doses from Cohort  2 (60  mg), 
and 12  patients and 4  doses from Cohort  3 (120  mg).  
The safety analysis focused on incidence and severity of all AEs, SAEs , and pre -
determined adverse events of special interest  (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). The DMC and 
designated unblinded [LOCATION_011] Pharmace uticals team met on  and did 
not identify any untoward safety signa ls at any BOS161721 dose level s.  
Because there were no safety, tolerability, or immunogenicity trends observed at the 
time of the IA, the phase  2 POC dose selection was mad e based on available PK and 
PD data . pSTAT3 levels were assessed as the primary PD biomarker of IL -21R 
signaling levels . This is because IL -21R signaling, upon IL -21 binding, initially involves 
phosphorylation of JAK1/JAK3 which dissociate from the recepto r complex, and 
phosphorylate STAT3 which translocates to the nucleus and drives IL -21-regulated 
gene expression .

[IP_ADDRESS]  POC Study Design  
For the POC part of the study,  approximately  110 additional patient s will be randomized 
to active or placebo groups in a 2:1 ratio.  
As in the MAD part of the study , each patient  in the POC portion  may receive a total of 
7 SC monthly doses of study drug on Days  0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 . 
Assessments will be completed according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  1 and 
Table  4).

Withdrawn patient s may be replaced after discussion between the Investigator  or 
designee and s ponsor .  
5.6 Contingency Plans During the COVID -19 Pandemic  
 Safety oversight: In case a patient cannot return to the study site for the 
scheduled visit, the site staff will contact [CONTACT_310174], 
for example, via telephone or video conferencing.   
 Centr al Labo ratory: In the case there are courier issues that will prevent the 
protocol -required lab oratory specimens  to be sent to the study core lab oratory , 
the site should have the safety lab oratory speciments  (Table  2: Hematology, 
Chemistry, and Urinalysis ) sent to their local laboratory for analysis and review 
by [CONTACT_5989].  
 Investigational Product Dosing: In cases when dosing cannot be performed 
during the protocol -designated windows, the Investigator should discuss each 
case with the Sponsor to determine whether it is a missed visit or whether the 
dosing can be performed out side protocol windows (as a protocol deviation). A 
minimum of [ADDRESS_380473] be maintai ned between consecutive doses. Patients 
who miss more than 2 doses of the study drug (whether consecutive or not) will 
be discontinued from the study and will undergo asse ssments as outlined in 
Section  5.5 (Premature Discontinuation).

[IP_ADDRESS].1  Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Testing Using QuantiFERON Test40 
QuantiFERON -TB Gold In -Tube (QFT -G) is an in vitro  diagnostic test using a peptide  
cocktail si mulating ESAT -6, CFP -10, and TB  7.7 proteins to stimulate cells in 
heparinized whole blood . Detection of INFγ performed by [CONTACT_28745] -linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELIS A) is used to identify in vitro  responses to these peptide 
antigens that are associated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection . QFT-G is an 
indirect test for M . tuberculosis infection (including disease) and is intended for use in 
conjunction with risk assessment, radiography and other medical and diagnostic 
evaluations .  
Test results will be reported as positive, negative, or indeterminate . A negative QFT -G 
test result is required to meet the inclusion criterion . In the case of an indeterminate 
result, repeat tests should be permitted for the purpose of determining eligibility of 
patients to enroll in this study . If a repeat test is indeterminate again, the patient is a 
screen failure . The procedure for using this test and interpreting the results will be 
described fully in the laboratory manual, which will be provided to Investigators .  
6.2.2  Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definitions  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence experienced by a study  patient , 
whether or not considered drug related by [CONTACT_183120] .  
AEs are  unfavorable changes in a general condition, subjec tive or objective signs or 
symptoms, worsening of pre -existing concomitant disease, and clinically significant 
abnorm ality in laboratory parameters observed in a patient  in the course of a clinical 
study .  
Non-serious SLE manifestations  or abnormal laboratory results  related to SLE  disease 
activity  would not be recorded as AEs  unless they meet the definition for SAE s 
(Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Recording of Adverse Events  
AEs should be collected and recorded for each patient  from the date of the first dose of 
study drug  until the end of their participation in the study , including the safety follow up 
period .  
AEs may be volunteered spontaneously by [CONTACT_4694] , or discovered by [CONTACT_310175], nonleading question s uch as 
‘How have you been feeling since you were last asked?’  All AEs and any required 
remedial action will be recorded  on the Adverse Events eCRF and Safety Adverse 
Event Form . The details of the AE, date of AE onset, date of AE outcome, and action

Protocol Date and Version: 30 April  2020; V7. 0 
Confidential   Page 73 of 130 taken for the AE will be documented together with the principal investigator’s 
assessment of the seriousness of the AE and causal relationship to the study drug 
and/or the study procedure .  
All AEs should be recorded individually , using diagnostic terms  where possible . If the 
diagnosis is not established,  individual symptom s may be reported . The AEs will 
subsequently be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Severity of Adverse Events  
Each AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_310176] (NCI CTCAE), version  4.03 
criteria .41 When changes in the severity (grade) of an AE occur more frequently than 
once a day, the maximum severity for the event should be noted for that day . Any 
change in severity of signs and symptoms over a number of days will be captured by 
[CONTACT_44745] a new AE, with the amended severity grade and the date (and time, if known) 
of the change .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Causality  of Adverse Events  
The principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_310036]161721 or 
placebo and the AE . One of the following categories (Table  3) shoul d be selected based 
on medical judgment, considering the definitions below and all contributing factors .  
Table  3. Causality Definitions  
Related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurs in a plausible time re lationship 
to treatment administration and which concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals cannot 
explain . The response to withdrawal of the treatment (dechallengea) should be clinically 
plausible . The event must be definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a 
satisfactory rechallengeb procedure if necessary  
Unrelated  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no temporal relationship 
with treatment administration . May have negative dechallenge and rechal lenge information . 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_261969] ( e.g., concomitant disease, environmental factors, 
or other drugs or chemicals)  
 
a Dechallenge : Upon discontinuation of a drug suspected of causing an AE, the symptoms of the AE 
disappear partially or completely, within a reasonable  time from drug discontinuation  (positive 
dechallenge), or the symptoms continue despi[INVESTIGATOR_211386] (negative dechallenge) . Note that 
there are exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discon tinuation of the drug, yet drug 
relatedness clearly exists (for example, as in bone marrow suppression, fixed drug eruptions, or tardive 
dyskinesia)  
b Rechallenge : Upon re -administration of a drug suspected of causing an AE in a specific patient in the 
past, the  AE recurs upon exposure (positive rechall enge), or the AE does not recur  (negative 
rechallenge)  
An unexpected adverse drug event is any adverse drug event for which the specificity or 
severity is not consistent with the current I P.

Confidential   Page 74 of 130 [IP_ADDRESS]  Seriousness  of Adverse Events  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death  
 Is life threatening; this means that the patient  was at risk of death at the time of the 
event; it does not mean that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe  
 Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_211384]  
 Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 Is other important medical event (see below)  
Important medical events that do not result in death, are not life threatening, or do not 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeop ardize the patient  and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition . Examples of such 
events are:  
 Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm  
 Blood dyscrasias or convu lsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 Development of drug dependency or drug abuse  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310037] ( e.g., elective surgery for a pre -existing condition that has not worsened) need not 
be considered SAEs . If anything untoward is reported during the procedure, that 
occurrence must be reported as an AE, either 'serious' or 'nonserious' according to the 
usual criteria .  
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are AEs that are 
associated with the use of the drug and are serious and unexpected .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
AEs of special interest in this study include  the following : 
1. Anaphylaxis and serious allergic reactions  
2. Grade s 2 to 5 injection site reaction, including erythema, pain , and induration  
(see Appendix  6) 
3. Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) assessed following Hy’s Law 
4. Malignancy  (not including basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of skin)  
5. Opportunistic infections such as disseminated histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, 
disseminated herpes simplex, disseminated tuberculosis , Aspergillus  sp., Candida 
albicans , Coccidioides immitis , Cryptococcus neoformans , Cytomegalovirus ,

[IP_ADDRESS].1  Anaphylaxis  and Serious Allergic Reactions  
Anaphylaxis will be defined according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (NIAID/FAAN) criteria . 42 In the event 
of anaphylactic reaction or severe/serious hypersensitivity/allergic reaction, the patient  
must discontinue IP and emergency resuscitati on measures implemented . In case of 
other mild to moderate hypersensitivity reaction, depending on the severity, the 
Investigator  may manage in accordance with the standard -of-care.  
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria is fulfilled:  
 Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, 
mucosal tissue, or both ( e.g., generalized hives, pruritus, or flushing, swollen 
lips-tongue -uvula) and at least 1 of the following:  
a. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] ( e.g., dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced 
peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] [PEF], hypoxemia)  
b. Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction ( e.g., 
hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)  
 Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2478] y after exposure to a likely allergen for 
that patient (minutes to several hours):  
a. Involvement of the skin -mucosal tissue ( e.g., generalized hives, itch -flush, 
swollen lips -tongue -uvula)  
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] ( e.g., dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced 
PEF, hypoxemia)  
c. Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms ( e.g., hypotonia [collapse], 
syncope, incontinence)  
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms ( e.g., crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)  
 Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen f or that patient (minutes 
to several hours):  
a. Systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease 
from the patient’s baseline  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Injection Site Reactions  
Injection site reactions are to be captured and reported as AEs . These will include 
Grades  2 to 5 injection site erythema, pain, and induration  (see Appendix  6), which are 
also captured as Adverse Events of Special Interest ( see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). The 
Investigator  should provide a clear description of the observed or reported AE including 
location and severity . All concomitant treatments used to treat  injection site reactions 
should be recorded and captured in the eCRF, together with the AE of injection site 
reactions .

bilirubin le vel that meet the criteria outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver 
injury are considered potential cases of DILI, and as potential Hy’s Law cases, and 
should always be considered important medical events . If symptoms compatible with 
DILI pre cede knowledge of serum chemical test abnormalities, liver enzyme 
measurements should be made immediately, regardless of when the next visit or 
monitoring interval is scheduled . In some cases, symptoms may be an early sign of 
injury and although typi[INVESTIGATOR_310038], they may 
indicate a need for prompt serum testing . An increase in liver enzymes should be 
confirmed by a repeated test within [ADDRESS_380480] be reported as 
SAEs (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].2  for reporting details) .  
Potential DILI is defined as:  
1. ALT or AST elevation  > 3 × ULN 
AND  
2. Total bilirubin  > 2 × ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum 
alkaline phosphatase)  
AND  
3. No other immediately apparent possible causes of A LT or AST elevation and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre -existing chronic 
or acute liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) know n to be 
hepatotoxic  
The patient  should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as 
possible, include laboratory tests, detailed history , and physical assessment . In addition 
to repeating measurements of AST and ALT, laboratory tests shou ld include albumin, 
CK, total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, GGT , prothrombin time (PT)/International 
Normalized Ratio (INR), and alkaline phosphatase . A detailed history, including relevant 
information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen,  recreational drug and 
supplement consumption, family history, occupational exposure, sexual history, travel 
history, history of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery, blood transfusion, history of 
liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be  collected . Further testing for 
acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging ( e.g., biliary tract) may be 
warranted . All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria 
defined above, with no other cause for liver function te st (LFT) abnormalities identified 
at the time should be considered potential Hy’s Law cases irrespective of availability of 
all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the abnormal 
LFTs . Such potential Hy’s Law cases should be reported as SAEs .

As information is avail able, a pregnancy diagnosed during the study will be reported 
within 24  hours to the sponsor  via the Pregnancy Notification and Outcome Form , 
including pregnancy in female patients who received study drug and female partners of 
male study patient s who received study drug . The pregnancy should be followed to term 
and/or outcome and this outcome should also be reported to the s ponsor  via the 
Pregnancy Notification and Outcome Form . Pregnancy  itself is not regarded as an AE 
or SAE unless  there is comp lication .  
In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the 
time of birth . In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be 
specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should 
be assessed by [CONTACT_4692] (unless pre -procedure test findings are 
conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported) .  
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an  AE or  SAE ( i.e., ectop ic 
pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or 
congenital anomaly [in a live born, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a 
neonatal death]), the Investigator  should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs .  
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows:  
 Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion  
 Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_380484] .

immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AE information . This timeframe also 
applies to additional new information (follow -up) on previou sly forwarded SAE reports 
as well as to the initial and follow -up reporting of exposure during pregnancy and 
exposure via breastfeeding cases . In the rare event that the Investigator  does not 
become aware of the occurrence of an SAE immediately ( e.g., if an outpatient study 
patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the Investigator  is to report the event within 
24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the AE .

and track suicidal events through any treatment . It is a clinical interview providing a 
summary of both ideation and behavior that can be administered during any evaluation 
or risk assessment to identify the level and type of suicidality present . The C -SSRS can 
also be used during treatment to monitor for clinical worsening .43 
The C -SSRS evaluation will be performed as specified in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table  1 andTable  4). Patients with recent (within the past 12 months) or active suicidal 
ideation or behavior bas ed on patient responding “yes” to question 3, 4, or [ADDRESS_380492] responses to the 
C-SSRS reviewed in detail  to assess patient risk, and appropriate consultative mental 
health services will be provided .  
6.2.7  Injection Site Reactions  
Patients will be monitored for local injection site reactions  as specified in the Schedule 
of Assessments (Table  1 and Table  4). Local injection site reactions will be assessed at

by a central lab.  
6.3 Efficacy Assessments  
All efficacy assessments will be performed at times defined in the Schedule of 
Assessments (Table  1 and Table  4).  
6.3.1  SLEDAI -2K 
The SLEDAI -2K is a validated instrument that measures disease activity in SLE patients 
at the time of the visit and in the previous 30 days . It is a global index and includes 
24 clinical and laboratory variables that are weighted by [CONTACT_310181], but 
BOS161721  [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc

Protocol Date and Version: 30 April  2020; V7. 0 
Confidential   Page 82 of 130 not by [CONTACT_926] . The total score falls between 0 and 105, with higher scores representing 
increased disease activity . The SLEDAI -2K has been shown to be a valid and reliable 
disease activity measure in multiple patient  groups . A SLEDAI -2K of 6 or more 
generally represents moderately to severely active disease .44 
6.3.2  BILAG  2004  
The BILAG -2004 index  is an organ -specific 97-question assessment  based on the 
principle of the doctor’s intent to treat . Only clinical features attributable to SLE disease 
activity are to be recorded and based on the patient ’s condition in the last 4 weeks 
compared with the previous 4  weeks . It will be scored as not pr esent (0), improved (1), 
the same (2), worse (3), or new (4) . Disease activity is graded separately for 9 body 
systems to 5 different grades (A to E) as follows:  A (“Active”)  is very active disease, B  
(“Beware”)  is moderate activity, C (“Contentment”) is mild stable disease, D (“Discount”) 
is inactive now but previously active , and E  (“Excluded”)  indicates the organ was never 
involved .[ADDRESS_380495] maintain documentation with descriptive details supporting the 
BILAG -2004 scoring ( e.g., chart, worksheet, clinic notes, and labs) at each visit .  
See Appendix  5 for detailed specifications .  
6.3.3  PGA of Disease Activity  
The PGA is used to assess Investigator’s  general impression on the patient’s overall 
status of SLE disease activity  via visual analogue scale ( 100 mm) with 0 being “very 
good, asymptomatic and no limitation of normal activities” with 100  mm being “most 
severe possible disease ever seen in all SLE patients” . PGA worsening is defined as an 
increase of > 30 mm from baseli ne.  
When scoring the PGA, the assessor should always look back at the score from the 
previous visit .  
6.3.4  Composite Endpoints : SRI-4, SRI -5, SRI -6, and BICLA Response  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SRI-4 Response  
The SRI -4 is a composite index of SLE disease improvement that consists of scores 
derived from the SLEDAI -2K and the BILAG 2004 Index . Response based on the SRI -4 
is defined by :  
1) ≥ 4-point reduction in SLEDAI -2K global score ; 2) no new severe disease activity 
(BILAG  A organ score) or more than 1 new moderate organ score (BILAG  B); and 3) no

Like the SRI -4, the SR I-5 and SRI -6 are composite indices of SLE disease improvement 
that consists of scores derived from the SLEDAI -2K and the BILAG 2004 Index . 
However, the SRI -5 and SRI -6 are computed with a minimal five-point or six-point 
improvement in SLEDAI -2K being requ ired, respectively .46 
[IP_ADDRESS]  BICLA  Response  
The BICLA is a responder index developed to measure response to therapy, and it 
includes scores from the BILAG, SLEDAI -2K, and PGA . BICLA response is defined as : 
1) at least 1  gradation of improvement in baseline BILAG  2004  scores in all body 
systems with moderate disease activity at entry ( e.g., all B [moderate disease ] scores 
falling to C [mild], or D [no activity ]); 2) no new BILAG A or more than 1 new BILAG B 
scores; 3) no worsening of total SLEDAI -2K score from bas eline; 4 ) ≤ 10% deterioration 
in PGA score ; and 5) no treatment failure .44 It is driven primarily by [CONTACT_310182], and has 
been used in phase  2 and 3 mAb studies .47 
For the endpoint s of BICLA respons e at Days 210, 240, and 270, patient scores will be 
completed  and response determined .  
6.3.5  CLASI R esponse  
The CLASI is a comprehensive tool for assessment of disease activity and damage in 
cutaneous lupus, shown to be valid, reliable, and sensitive to changes in disease 
activity .48 Response is defined as  50% improvemen t from baseline in “A” or “B” scores . 
This assessment will be applied to all patients who have cutaneous disease activity .  
For the secondary efficacy endpoint of CLASI response at Day 210 , patient scores on 
MAD and POC studies will be compared with baseline for 50% improvement .

The proportion of patients who achieve a SRI-4 response at Day 210 will be assessed  
via Pearson’s chi -squared  analysis . The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed 
using the FAS and if needed  repeated in  the PP analysis set . Missing values will be 
addressed by [CONTACT_18120] a last observation carried forward (LOCF) analysis . Other 
imputation methods may be employed as a sensitivity analysis  and will be described in

Exploratory subgroup analyses assessing  impact of baseline factors such as baseline 
disease severity, background therapy, race, geography, base line serologic activity and 
other characteristics may be performed . Additional exploratory analyses of disease 
activity endpoints may be performed based on emerging data .  
Patients  that received prohibited medications or unallowable CS usage as described i n 
Section  4.6 will be considered “medication failures” and will be treated as statistical 
non-responders at time points on or following the first date of prohibited medication or 
unallowable CS usage for the primary efficacy analysis . The determination of 
medication failures will be reviewed using blinded data and finalized prior to unblinding .  
The superiori ty of BOS161721 relative to placebo will be evaluated . If the proportion of 
SRI-4 responders for the selected POC dose in BOS161721 arm is higher than that of 
the placebo arm, then BOS161721 will be considered superior to placebo if the 2 -sided 
p-value is  < 0.10. Secondary and exploratory endpoints for this POC portion  will be 
evaluated based on the same statistical hypothesis .  
8.2.4  Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s)  
Binary efficacy endpoints will be assessed via Pearson’s chi -squared analysis . 
Continuous efficacy endpoints will be assessed via analysis of variance (ANOVA) or

9.1 Good Clinical Practice  
The procedures set out in this protoc ol are designed to ensure that the sponsor and the 
principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_310046]  (ICH) guidelines on GCP and the Declaration of Helsinki (Version 2013) . 
The clinical study also will be carried  out in the keepi[INVESTIGATOR_310047] (in accordance with US IND regulations [21 CFR 56]) .  
9.2 DMC  
This study will use an external DMC . The DMC is an independent committee 
established to provide oversight of safety considerations in s tudy and to provide advice 
to the sponsor regarding actions the committee deems necessary for the continuing 
protection of enrolled patients and those yet to be recruited to the trial as well as for the 
continuing validity and scientific merit of the study  results . The DMC is charged with 
assessing such actions in light of an acceptable benefit/risk profile for BOS161721 . The 
recommendations made by [CONTACT_1363] ( i.e., dose escalation, etc .) will be forwarded to the 
sponsor for final decision . The sponsor will f orward such decisions, which may include 
summaries of safety data which are not endpoints, to regulatory authorities, as 
appropriate .  
The sponsor will appoint a DMC for the periodic review of available study data . The 
DMC  is an independent group of experts that advises the sponsor and the study 
Investigators . The members of the DMC  serve in an individual capacity and provide 
their expertise and recommendations . The primary responsibilities of the DMC  are to 
(1) periodicall y review and evaluate the accumulated study data for participant safety, 
study conduct,  and progress, (2)  make recommendations to the sponsor concerning the 
continuation, modification, or termination of the study  and (3)  suggest  dose for POC 
portion of the  study  as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] .  
The DMC  considers study -specific data as well as relevant background knowledge 
about the disease, test agent, or patient pop ulation under study . The DMC  is 
responsible for defining its deliberative processes, including event triggers that would 
call for an unscheduled review, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_15381], unmasking (unblinding), and voting 
procedures prior to initiating any data review . The DMC  is also responsible for 
maintaining the confidentiality of its internal discussions and activities as well as the 
contents of reports provided to it .  
The DMC will have access to unblinded treatment information during the clinical trial . 
Details r egarding management and process of this committee are found in the DMC 
Charter .  
The DMC may recommend termination of BOS161721 treatment arm or the entire 
BOS161721 MAD/POC trial for any safety concern that is felt to outweigh potential

Ethical Principles  For Medical Research Involving Human Subjects .  
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly  
Helsinki, Finland, June [ADDRESS_380524] the health of the people . The 
physician’s knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty .  
The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association binds the physician with 
the words, "The health of my subject will be my first consideration," and the International 
Code of Medical Ethics declares that, "A physician shall act only in the subject's interest 
when providing medical care which might have the effect of weakening the physical and 
mental condition of the subject ".  
Medical progress is based on research, which ultimately must rest in part on 
experimentation involving human subjects .  
In medical research on human subjects, considerations related to the well -being of the 
human subject should take precedence over the interests of science and society .  
The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to improve 
prophylactic, diagnostic,  and therapeutic procedures and the understanding of the 
etiology and pa thogenesis of disease . Even the best -proven prophylactic, diagnostic, 
and therapeutic methods must continuously be challenged through research for their 
effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility,  and quality .  
In current medical practice and in medical research, most prophylactic, diagnostic,  and 
therapeutic procedures involve risks and burdens .

Clinical Study  Protocol : BOS161721 -02 
Protocol Date and Version: 30 April  2020; V7. [ADDRESS_380525] has given consent .

Clinical Study  Protocol : BOS161721 -02 
Protocol Date and Version: 30 April  2020; V7. [ADDRESS_380526]’s information and to minimize the impact of the study on the 
subject's physical and mental integrity and on the personality of the  subject .  
In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequately informed 
of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional 
affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potentia l risks of the study and 
the discomfort it may entail . The subject should be informed of the right to abstain from 
participation in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without 
reprisal . After ensuring that the subject has understood  the information, the physician 
should then obtain the subject's freely -given informed consent, preferably in writing . If 
the consent cannot be obtained in writing, the non -written consent must be formally 
documented and witnessed .  
When obtaining informed  consent for the research project the physician should be 
particularly cautious if the subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or 
may consent under duress . In that case the informed consent should be obtained by a 
well-informed physician who is not engaged in the investigation and who is completely 
independent of this relationship .  
For a research subject who is legally incompetent, physically or mentally incapable of 
giving consent or is a legally incompetent minor, the Investigator  must obtain informed 
consent from the legally authorized representative in accordance with applicable law . 
These groups should not be included in research unless the research is necessary to 
promote the health of the population represented and this research can not instead be 
performed on legally competent persons .

Clinical Study  Protocol : BOS161721 -02 
Protocol Date and Version: 30 April  2020; V7. [ADDRESS_380527] obtain that 
assent in addition to the conse nt of the legally authorized representative .  
Research on individuals from whom it is not possible to obtain consent, including proxy 
or advance consent, should be done only if the physical/mental condition that prevents 
obtaining informed consent is a nec essary characteristic of the research population . The 
specific reasons for involving research subjects with a condition that renders them 
unable to give informed consent should be stated in the experimental protocol for 
consideration and approval of the re view committee . The protocol should state that 
consent to remain in the research should be obtained as soon as possible from the 
individual or a legally authorized surrogate .  
Both authors and publishers have ethical obligations . In publication of the resu lts of 
research, the Investigators  are obliged to preserve the accuracy of the results . Negative 
as well as positive results should be published or otherwise publicly available . Sources 
of funding, institutional affiliations and any possible conflicts of i nterest should be 
declared in the publication . Reports of experimentation not in accordance with the 
principles laid down in this Declaration should not be accepted for publication .  
C. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH 
MEDICAL CARE  
The physician may combine medical research with medical care, only to the extent that 
the research is justified by [CONTACT_54233], diagnostic,  or therapeutic value . 
When medical research is combined with medical care, additional standards apply to  
protect the subjects who are research subjects .  
The benefits, risks, burdens,  and effectiveness of a new method should be tested 
against those of the best current prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods . This 
does not exclude the use of placebo, or no treatment, in studies where no proven 
prophylactic, diagnostic,  or therapeutic method exists .  
At the conclusion of the study, every subject entered into the study should be assured of 
access to the best -proven prophylactic, diagnostic,  and therapeutic methods identified 
by [CONTACT_1758] .  
The physician should fully inform the subject which aspects of the care are related to 
the research . The refusal of a subject to participate in a study must never interfere with  
the subject -physician relationship .  
In the treatment of a subject, where proven prophylactic, diagnostic,  and therapeutic 
methods do not exist or have been ineffective, the physician, with informed consent 
from the subject, must be free to use unproven o r new prophylactic, diagnostic,  and 
therapeutic measures, if in the physician’s judgment it offers hope of saving life, re -
establishing health,  or alleviating suffering . Where possible, these measures should be 
made the object of research, designed to eval uate their safety and efficacy . In all cases,

Overutilization Monitoring System’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_310065] .  
d The MME conversion factor for bupre norphine patches is based on the assumption that 1 mg of 
parenteral bu prenorphine is equivalent to 75  mg of oral morphine and that one patch delivers the 
dispensed micrograms per hour over a 24 hour day . Example : 5 μg/hr buprenorphine patch × 
24 hrs = 120 μg/day buprenorphine  = 0.12 mg/day = 9 mg/day oral MME . In other words, the 
conversion factor not accounting for d ays of use would be 9/[ADDRESS_380528] multiplied the conversion 
factor by 7 (1.8 × 7 = 12.6). In this example, MME/day for 4  5 μg/hr buprenorphine patches dispensed for 
use over 28  days would work out as follows : Examp le: 5 μg/hr buprenorphine patch  × (4 patches/28 days) 
× 12.6 = 9 MME/day . Please note that because this allowance has been made ba sed on the typi[INVESTIGATOR_310066] [ADDRESS_380529], i.e., Days Supply for buprenorphine patches  = number  of patches x 7.  
e The MME conversion factor for fentanyl buccal tablets, sublingual tablets, and lozenges/troche is 
0.13. This conversion factor should be multiplied by [CONTACT_310198] a given tablet or 
lozenge/troche .  
f The MME conversion factor for fentanyl film and oral spray is 0 .18. This reflects a 40% greater 
bioavailability for films compared to lozenges/tablets and 38% greater bioavailability for oral spray s 
compared to lozenges/tablets .  
g The MME conversion factor for fentanyl nasal spray is 0 .16, which reflects a 20% greater 
bioavailability for sprays compared to lozenges/tablets .  
h The MME conve rsion factor for fentanyl patches is based on the a ssumption that 1  mg of parenteral 
fentanyl is equivalent to 100  mg of oral morphine and that 1  patch delivers the dispensed micrograms 
per hour over a 24 hour day . Example : 25 μg/hr fentanyl patch × 24 hrs = 600 ug/day 
fentanyl  = 60 mg/day oral  morphine  mg equivalent .  
In other words, the conversion factor not accounting for day s of use would be 60/[ADDRESS_380530] multiplied the conversion f actor 
by 3 (2.4 × 3 = 7.2). In this example, MME/day for 10 25 μg/hr fentanyl patches dispensed for use over 
30 days would work out as follows :  
Example : 25 μg/hr fentanyl patch × (10 patches/30 days) × 7.2 = 60 MME/day . Please note that because 
this allowance has been made based  on the typi[INVESTIGATOR_310067] [ADDRESS_380531], i.e., Days Supply for fentanyl 
patches  = number  of patches  × 3.  
i The CDC MME conv ersion factor to calculate morphine  mg equivalents is 3 . CMS uses this 
conversion factor when analyzing Medicare population opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] . CMS uses the graduated 
methadone MME conversion factor s to calculate MME within the OMS  for identifying and reporting

j Tapentadol is a mu receptor agonist and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_26331] . Oral MMEs are based on 
degree of mu -receptor agonist activity, but it is unknown if this drug is associated  with overdose in the 
same dose -dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely mu receptor agonists .

 Investigational Product Dosing: In cases when dosing cannot be performed during 
the protocol -designated windows, the Investigator should discuss each case with the 
Sponsor to determine whether it is a missed visit or whether the dosing can be 
performed outside protocol windows (as a protocol deviation). A minimum of

Title:  A Randomized Double -Blind Phase  1b/2 Combined Staggered Multiple 
Dose Escalation Study of BOS161721 in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus 
(SLE)  Patients on a Background of Limited Standard of Care 
Indication  Adults with moderately to severely active SLE  
Background 
and Rationale SLE is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease with considerable 
heterogeneity in clinical manifestations and disease course.  There is evidence that B - and T- cells are critical to the development of the disease, 
and that T- cell-derived cytokines such as 
interleukin -21 (IL- 21) are involved 
in the SLE- associated inflammatory pathological response.    
BOS161721 is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) triple mutation monoclonal antibody (mAb) intended to have an extended terminal 
elimination half- life (t
½) that selectively binds to and neutralizes IL -21, 
which acts on multiple cell types that drive  inflammation and autoimmunity.  
In vivo , BOS161721 inhibits T- cell dependent antigen responses of B -cells 
and is being developed as a potential  treatment for adult s with moderately to 
severely active SLE.    
No
nclinical studies have evaluated  the toxi city, pharmacodynamics (PD), 
toxicokinetics (TK), pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of BOS161721 administered intravenously (IV) and subcutaneously (SC).  The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in Cynomolgus monkeys w as 
determ ined to be 100 mg/kg (SC and IV) , the highest dose tested.  There 
were no injection site reactions in animals dosed subcutaneously. 
In a Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) study, BOS161721 was 
administered IV and SC to healthy male and female adult subjec ts.  This 
double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated 8 ascending dose levels (1 [IV], 3 [SC], 10 [SC], 22 [IV], 30 [SC], 60 [SC], 120 [SC], or 
240 [SC] mg) for safety, tolerability, PK, PD and immunogenicity.  Overall, 
there were no clinically significant safety or tolerability findings from this 
study.  
Results from the Phase 1 SAD study informed the dose regimens used for the 
multiple ascending doses (MAD) Phase 1b  portion of this trial.  The MAD 
portion will involve 3 cohorts.  The Phase 2 portion will be a proof of 
concept (POC) part, where dose selection will be based on the data 
monitoring c ommittee (DMC) and sponsor ’s assessment of safety, 
tolerability, immunogenicity, and PK and PD data from the MAD portion  of 
30 patien ts treated with BOS161721/placebo.  The purpose of the study is to 
establish a safe and effective dosage for adult patients with moderately to 
severely active SLE.

Confidential   Page 9 of 139 Cohort  1 containing 6 patient s, where 5 of these patient s will receive 
BOS161721 (active), and 1 will receive placebo.  Cohorts 2 and 3 will each 
contain 12 patient s, including 9 active and 3 placebo patient s.  Dose selection 
for each cohort is based on 90-day safety, tolerability, PK, and PD data 
review from the Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01) in healthy subjects .  
Each of the 3 doses (20, 60, and 120 mg) selected for the MAD portion are 
projected not to exceed the mean exposure of that achieved in the SAD  study 
following the single [ADDRESS_380575] completed 2 weeks of follow-up after the 
second dose, Cohort 2 begins dosing (after the DMC evaluat es the safety and 
tolerability data from  Cohort 1) .  Similarly, after [ADDRESS_380576] into the POC part of the  study.  Th is dose will not exceed 
doses tested during the MAD portion .   
For the POC portion, approximately 156  additional patient s will be 
randomized to active or placebo groups in a 2:1 ratio.  As in the MAD 
portion, e ach patient  in the POC portion may receive a total of 7 SC monthly 
doses on Days 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180.   
A maximum stable (for at least 6  weeks prior to Day 0) daily dose of 
30 mg/day of oral CS will be acceptable for eligibility for the study.  One  oral 
CS “burst ” for increased SLE disease activity may occur during the study 
between Day 0  and Day  120.  Tapering of steroids during the course of the 
study will be highly encouraged and should be evaluated during the 
protocol- allowed  tapering windows (Day 0 through Day 150) with the target 
of achieving a CS daily dose of ≤ 7.5 mg and < Day  [ADDRESS_380577] be held 
constant  due to the Day  210 endpoint evaluations. 
DMC safety reviews will be conducted periodically throughout the study as 
described in the DMC charter .

1.1 Indication  
BOS161721 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb), which binds to and inhibits 
interleukin -21 (IL-21) bioactivity, and is being develope d for the treatment of moderately to 
severely active systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) in adults.  
1.2 Background  and Rationale  
1.2.1 Overview of the Disease State  
SLE is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that has variable manifestations in multiple 
organ systems and follows a relapsing and remitting course .  The disease process includes 
abnormal immune responses mediated by [CONTACT_59627]-binding autoantibodies and immune complex deposition, giving rise to tissue damage often resulting in end organ disease and even mortality.  Survival of SLE has improved due to earlier detection , improved overall medical care, and 
standardized  SLE treatment with corticosteroi ds (CS) , immunosuppressants, and cytotoxic 
agents.
[ADDRESS_380595] common cause of death during later disease .2   
The reported prevalence of SLE in the [LOCATION_002] (US) is 20 to 70 cases per 100,000 people.3  
More than 90% of cases of SLE occur in women, frequently starting at chil dbearing age.  
Women of color  are disproportionately affected by [CONTACT_113919].  This suggests multiple genetic and 
environmental factors are at play.  Accordingly, a multifactorial view of the 
immunopathogenesis of SLE suggests more than [ADDRESS_380596], including breach in central 
tolerance in the adaptive arm of the immune system, peripheral amplification of the autoimmune response by [CONTACT_310147], and local processes in the target organ that facilitate end-organ disease.

1.2.2 B
OS161721 Development  
[LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals is developi[INVESTIGATOR_310031]161721 for the treatment of SLE.  BOS161721 is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1)  mAb with extended half -life directed against 
human  IL-21.   
Murine mAb 19E3, the progenitor of BOS161721, was generated using mouse hybridoma technology.  19E3 has subpi[INVESTIGATOR_36379] (pM) affinity to human IL- 21 and was selected for its potent 
neutralization of IL -21 bioactivity.  BOS161721 was generated by [CONTACT_310148] 
19E3 where its complementarity-determining regions were grafted onto a human IgG1 kappa backbone.  The fragment crystallizable (Fc) portion of BOS161721 contains a YTE (M252Y/S254T/T256E triple mutation) in the constant domain of the IgG1 heavy chain that was introduced into the parental molecule, 19E3, intended to prolong the in vivo  terminal elimination 
half- life ( t
½) of the mAb.5  Thus, BOS161721 retains sub-pM binding to IL-21 and prevents 
IL-21 from binding to the IL-21 receptor (IL-21R), inhibiting IL-21 bioactivity.

Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- 02 
Protocol Date and Version:  23 July 2019 ; V6.0 
Confidential   Page 26 of 139 BOS161721 binds to human IL -21 and Cynomolgus monkey IL-21, which are highly 
homologous, and neutralizes the bioactivity of both.  BOS161721 is specific for IL- 21 as it does 
not bind to or inhibit the other gamma- chain (γc) family  of cytokines , and acts to specifically 
neutralize the IL -[ADDRESS_380597].  In in vitro  studies, BOS161721 inhibited downstream IL-21-
induced signaling, IL -21-induced plasma cell differentiation, and IL-21- induced natural killer 
(NK) cell activation.  In in vivo  studies, BOS161721 significantly inhibited the T- cell dependent 
antibody response (TDAR) to immunization with a protein antigen as well as B- cell expansion 
following a second protein antigen immunization in Cynomolgus monkeys.    
[IP_ADDRESS] Interleukin -[ADDRESS_380598] cytokines in this family are critically important for both 
the maintenance and function of T- cell and B- cell responses.  IL -21 signals through a receptor 
complex consisting of its own private receptor, the IL-21R and γc.6,7  Engagement of the 
IL-21R/γc complex leads to the activation of several signaling pathways, including the Janus 
kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription, mitogen- activated protein kinase (MAPK) 
and phosphoinositide 3- kinase pathways.[ADDRESS_380599] array of cell types, including B- cells, T -cells, NK -cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, 
as well as other hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells such as fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and 
intestinal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663].9,11  Activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3  
(STAT3 ) via phosphorylation is critical  in regulating human B- cell responses to IL -2112; 
phosphorylated STAT3  (pSTAT3) forms  a homodimer, which translocates to the nucleus where 
it initiates transcription of the IL -21 gene , forming an autocrine loop for IL-21 production via 
STAT3 phosphorylation.13  In addition, IL -21 has been shown to upregulate expression of its 
own receptor14 and induces an autocrine feedback loop.15 
IL-21 modulates various aspects of immune function.  It  promotes cluster of differentiation 4 
(CD4+ ) T-cell differentiation and promotes the generation of T -helper (Th)1716 and T- follicular 
helper (Tfh) cells.15,17  In mice, IL -21 has been shown to regulate the balance between Th17 and 
regulatory T- cell (Treg), in that it increases Th17, while inhibiting  Treg differentiation.[ADDRESS_380600] disease induced by [CONTACT_74934] T- cells.20  IL-21 upregulates CD8+ 
T-cell and NK -cell expansion and cytolytic activity by [CONTACT_310149] B and perforin.21,22  
IL-21 also has been reported to increase granzyme B in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B -cells 
resulting in  inhibition of T- cell responses.23,24  IL-21 also has a variety of effects on 
nonhematopoietic cells, such as stromal cells and induces inflammation through matrix metalloproteinase release by [CONTACT_310207].
25 
One principal non-redundant role of IL -21 is the promotion of B- cell activation, differentiation , 
or death during humoral immune responses.14  Furthermore, increased IL -21 production is 
characteristic of several autoimmune diseases and is likely to contribute to autoantibody production as well as pathologic features of autoimmune disease.
 26  The critical role of IL -21 in 
promoting humoral and other immune responses makes it an important focus of potential

reported to correlate with IL -[ADDRESS_380601] elevated IL -21 
plasma levels that correlate with the severity of the disease.  Recently, genome- wide association 
studies (GWAS) have provided convincing evidence that the chromosomal 4q 27 region harbors 
the IL -21 genes and is associated with chronic inflammatory disorders, including SLE.29   
[IP_ADDRESS] Preclinical Studies  
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of BOS161721 were characterized following single- dose intravenous 
(IV) administration of BOS161721 (0.01 to 30 mg/kg) in male Cynomolgus monkeys or repeat, every 2 weeks IV administration (15 to 100 mg/kg) and subcutaneous (SC) administration (50 mg/kg) in male and female Cynomolgus monkeys.  Systemic exposure was approximately dose-proportional within the tested dose range.  SC bioavailability was determined to be 64.3%.  
 
 
Two single-dose (IV) non-good laboratory practice (GLP) studies conducted in Cynomolgus monkeys evaluated the toxicity, pharmacodynamics (PD), toxicokinetics (TK), and immunogenicity of BOS161721.  Following a single IV administration (slow bolus), there were no BOS161721- related adverse changes, resulting in a no -observed -adverse- effect -level 
(NOAEL) value of 30  mg/kg, the highest dose tested among 2 studies.  
 
In a repeat -dose GLP toxicology study in Cynomolgus monkeys, BOS161721 was administered 
every 2 weeks by [CONTACT_310152] (50 mg/kg) administration for 3 months (a total of 7  doses).

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Studies  
BOS161721-01 was a double-blind, Phase 1, single ascending dose (SAD) study to assess the 
safety, PK , and PD of BOS161721 in healthy subjects.  The primary objective of the study was 
to characterize the safety and tolerability of IV and SC SADs  of BOS161721 in an otherwise 
healthy subject population without concomitant illnesses, immune abnormalities, or concomitant 
medications.  Secondary objectives include d characterization of the PK and immunogenicity of 
BOS161721, and exploratory objectives included the evaluation of the effect of BOS161721 on TDAR to keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( KLH) (primary and secondary immunizations) in healthy 
subjects, the effects of BOS161721 on plasma levels of IL -21 (free and bound), and the 
evaluation of the effect of BOS161721 on IL -21 gene expression (via gene signature) in blood.  
This study consist ed of 8 cohorts.  Subjects were  randomized in a 3:1 ratio (BOS161721: placebo) 
and received either a single dose of BOS161721 (1 [IV], 3 [SC] , 10 [SC], 22 [IV], 30 [SC], 60 
[SC], 120 [SC],  or 240 [SC]  mg) or placebo, with safety follow -up.  For the first cohort, after the 
first 2  subjects were dosed (1 active and 1 placebo), there was a minimum gap of 48 hours before 
the remaining subjects from that cohort were  dosed, to allow for an initial review of any 
emerging safety and tolerability data .  For all cohorts, escalation to the next dose was not  sooner

Blood samples were collected at every in -house study visit for BOS161721 concentration 
determinations.  Blood samples were also collected for determination of IL -21 plasma levels 
(free and total).  Safety was assessed based on the occurrence of treatment -emergent AEs, 
hepatic function abnormalit y, and acute and delayed hypersensitivity reactions.  Other safety 
variables include d ECGs, vital signs (blood pressure [BP], heart rate , and temperature), safety 
laboratory assessments, blood sampling for ADA s, total IgG and immunoglobulin M ( IgM) 
levels,  CD4+ count, and full and targeted physical examinations.  Overall, there were no 
clinically significant findings from this study .  Adverse event s reported as related to the study 
drug, particularly infections, were expected for the compound, and there wer e no clinically 
relevant changes in laboratory  and ECG  results or vital signs.  There was 1 serious adverse event 
(SAE ; death  due to pulmonary embolism) that occurred 127 days after a single administration of

All doses selected for the MAD portion are projected not to exceed the mean  exposure of that 
achieved following the highest single dose of 240 mg SC administered in the Phase 1 SAD study.   
Cohort 1 will include randomized treatment to the 20 mg dose.  Based on the staggered study 
design, t he data monitoring committee (DMC) will perform a scheduled review of safety data 
and sequentially consider dose escalation for Cohorts [ADDRESS_380605] into 
the proof of concept ( POC) Phase 2  portion.  This  POC dose decision will be based on evaluation 
of the PK , safety  (inclusive of dose- limiting toxicity [DLT]), and tolerability data (and available 
PD/biomarker data ) from Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 from the MAD portion (s ee Section [IP_ADDRESS] for the

(and available PD/biomarker data ) from Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 during th e MAD part of study.  
Thereafter, DMC safety reviews will be conducted periodically throughout the study as 
described in the DMC charter .  With the agreement of the DMC and sponsor, this schedule may 
be modified depending on the rate of patient  accrual.   Additional details can be found in the 
DMC Charter.  
The benefit of participation for all patient s in this study is close monitoring of their medical 
condition and safety of their treatment.  Those randomized to the active treatment arm may 
potentially experience improvement in their SLE  disease.  Those randomized to the placebo (in 
combination with standard of care) arm are not expected to obtain any additional benefit, beyond those of their background treatment, though close monitoring of their medical c ondition and 
safety may itself be associated with improving their SLE .   
1.2.5 Potential Risks  
Potential risks based on the m echanism of action of BOS161721 include inf ections, risks 
associ ated wit h the administration of any foreign pro tein or biologic agent, including injection 
site r eaction, anaphy laxis, serious allerg ic reaction, and deve lopment of AD As.  ADAs  could 
result in immune c omplex disea se (with mani festations su ch as arthralgias, serum- sickn ess, and 
vasculiti s), or altered BOS161721 leve ls or activity.  Further details can be found in the current 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for BOS161721, which contains comprehensive toxicology, preclinical and clinical information on BOS161721. 
Two investigational drug products are considered to be in the same pharmacological class as BOS161721 based on interruption of signaling through the IL-[ADDRESS_380608].  No potential risk generalizable across the class has been observed with these investigational products.   
Based on the clinical Phase 1 SAD study (BOS1 [ZIP_CODE]-01), AEs reported as related to the study 
drug, particularly infections (flu-like symptoms, etc.), were expected for the compound, and there were no clinically relevant changes in laboratory and ECG results or vital signs.  
The majority of IgG elimin ation occurs via intracellular catabolism, following fluid-phase or 
receptor -mediated endocytosis.  This type of endocytosis and elimination is a form of 
target-mediated disposition where the interaction of the drug and its pharmacological target (eg, a ta rget receptor) serves as a significant contributor to the kinetics of antibody distribution 
and elimination.  Renal elimination, which is a primary pathway of clearance of small -molecule 
drugs, is relatively unimportant for IgG, as its large size prevents efficient filtration through the 
glomerulus.  Secretion into the bile is an important pathway of elimination of IgA antibodies, but this route is not a significant contributor to the elimination of IgG antibodies.  Thus, risk to renal and hepatic systems d ue to metabolism of BOS161721 is low.

As with the administration of any foreign protein and/or other biological agents, acute 
hypersensitivity reactions, including acute anaphylactic/hypersensitivity, severe allergic, and anaphylactoid reactions may follow infusion of mAbs and can be caused by [CONTACT_62535].  These acute hypersensitivity reactions may be severe and result in death.  
Anaphylaxis will be defined according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (NIAID/FAAN) criteria ,
34 and are discussed in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].1. 
Based on the Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), anaphylaxis and serious allergic reactions in 
subjects who received BOS161721 was not observed.   
Patients with a known history of allergy or severe hypersensitivity reaction to any component of 
BOS161721 formulation or patients with a history of anaphylaxis to any other biological therapy such as mAbs will be excluded from studies with BOS161721.  In addition, appropriate drugs and medical equipment to treat acute hypotensive, bronchoconstrictive, or anaphylactic reactions will be immediately available at the unit and study personnel will be trained to recognize and treat these reactions.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Injection Site Reactions 
In a repeat -dose GLP toxicology study in Cynomolgus monkeys, BOS161721 was administered 
every 2 weeks by [CONTACT_310154] 3 months (a total of 7  doses) .  There were no injection site 
reactions in animals dosed subcutaneously .  Further, there were no reports of inj ection site 
reactions in the 26-week GLP toxicology study in Cynomolgus monkeys. 
Based on the Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721- 01), incidence of injection site reactions in 
subjects who received BOS161721 was similar to placebo.   
Patients will be monitored for local injection site reactions in this study.  See Section 6.2.7.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Immune Complex Disease 
The potential risk of immune complex disease for BOS161721 is theoretical, based on the known risks associated with mAbs.  The administration of a mAb can result in the formation of ADAs.  Administration of the mAb in the presence of ADA may result in the formation of circulating antibody-antigen complexes potentially resulting in altered BOS161721 levels or activity or deposition of the complexes in microvasculature.  Complement is frequently involved in the latter setting, and the breakdown products of complement attract polymorphonuclear leukocytes to the site of deposition where they can provoke local tissue damage through specific or nonspecific release of enzymes.  Two of the more common end -organ targets are the blood 
vessels (vasculitis) and kidney (nephritis).  These clinical manifestations represent immune complex disease or Type III hypersensitivity.  Although BOS161721 is a humanized mAb, ADAs may develop; however, the likelihood of occurrence of immune complex disease with BOS161721 is low.  The findings of immune complex disease are typi[INVESTIGATOR_310078]- antigen complexes are cleared from the body .

[IP_ADDRESS] Infections  
BOS161721 is expected to diminish the activity of T- cell, B -cell and NK- cell lines.  Like other 
medications modulating immune response, BOS161721 may increase the potential risk for  
infection, including serious infections.  IL-21 produced by [CONTACT_398]4+ Th cells is required to sustain the anti-viral function of CD8+ T- cells against chronic viral infections.  Nonclinical evidence 
suggests that the risk of chronic viral infection recurrence o r increased severity may occur with 
IL-21 inhibition.

These conditions will be fully characterized with clinical descriptions and routine laboratory and/or specialty testing and treated where indicated with appropriate local standard of care. 
Patients wit h a history of opportunistic infection, including recurrent or severe  disseminated 
herpes zoster or disseminated herpes simplex  within the last 3 years , or any other underlying 
pathology predisposing to serious infection, are excluded from studies with BOS161721 (for 
further details please refer to the current IB for BOS161721). 
Patients will be assessed for hepatitis B, and C, and HIV-1/[ADDRESS_380609] been observed in immunosuppressed liver transplant and human immunodeficiency virus patients.
36,37  Since 
BOS161721 is expected to diminish the immunosurveillance activity of T- cell, B -cell, and 
NK-cell lines, a similar risk is biologically plausible with prolonged exposure to BOS161721. 
Since the risk of opportunistic cryptosporidium infection increases with low levels of 
CD4+  T-cells,37 patients with a CD4+ count < 500 cell/mm3 were excluded from the Phase 1 
SAD study (BOS161721-01), and CD4 + < 350 cells/mm3 will be excluded from the MAD/POC 
parts of the study.  Patients exposed to investigational product who develop diarrhea during the course of the study should immediately undergo an assessment for opportunistic infection including stool for ova and parasites and stool examination for cryptosporidium.  Positive cryptosporidium in stool sample at screening is an exclusion.  Treatment by [CONTACT_310210]. 
Based on the Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), infections in subjects who received 
BOS161721 was not observed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Malignancy 
The stimulatory effect of IL -21 on NK cells and CD8+ T- cells suggests the cytokine may have 
anti-tumor activity.  Nonclinical studies have demonstrated significant anti- tumor effects of 
IL-21 in a number of tumor models.  IL- 21 therapy of human metastatic melanoma and renal cell 
carcinoma has demonstrated POC with significant increases in levels of perforin, granzyme B,

The impact of treatment with anti- IL-21 therapy on the development or growth of malignancies 
is not known; however, as with other immunomodulatory biologic agents, treatment with 
BOS161721 may result in an increase in the risk of malignancies.  NK cell suppression by [CONTACT_8668] -[ADDRESS_380610] 5 years, with the ex ception

[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatic Function Abnormality  
There is no substantial evidence suggesting BOS161721 is associated with liver function 
abnormality.  However, as a precaution, p atients with a history of abnormal alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT)  and/or aspartate ami notransferase (AST), or bilirubin at screening 
(ALT /AST  > 2 × upper limit of normal [ULN] ; total bilirubin >  1.5 × [ULN] and judged by [CONTACT_119278]) were excluded from the Phase 1 SAD study 
(BOS161721-01), and will be excluded from this trial.  Patients with a positive hepatitis B or C 
test or a history of alcohol dependence will  also be excluded.  
Based on the Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), hepatic function abnormality in subjects who received BOS161721 was not observed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Failure of Vaccination  
IL-21 is a key cytokine in development of B-cells into immunoglobulin- secreting plasma cells.  
Abnormal signaling through the IL-21R/Janus Kinase (JAK)3/signal transducer and activator of 
transcription (STAT3 ) pathway leads to defective humoral immune responses to both 
T-dependent and T-independent antigens and impairs the establishment of long- lasting B -cell 
memory.  Abnormal signaling through the pathway has been related to decreased specific antibody responses following vaccination, and to increased susceptibility to encapsulated bacterial infections.
[ADDRESS_380611] of BOS161721 was evaluated in in vivo  single dose studies in Cynomolgus monkey in 
which the animals received vaccination to T -cell dependent KLH antigen to stimulate a TDAR.  
These in vivo  studies demonstrated that BOS161721 significantly inhibited B- cell proliferation 
and IgG antibody responses to the KLH protein antigen in a dose-dependent fashion; however, BOS161721 administration did not affect anti-tetanus toxoid antibody data for IgM, IgG, IgG1, or immunoglobulin E ( IgE) during the dosing phase in the same study.

Protocol Date and Version:  23 July 2019 ; V6.[ADDRESS_380613] of 3 cohorts:  
• Cohort 1 (20 mg SC) will include 6 patient s 
o 5 patients will receive BOS161721 (a ctive  group) and 1 patient will receive placebo 
(placebo group) 
• Cohorts 2 (60  mg SC) and 3 (120 mg  SC) will include 12 patient s each  
o 9 patients in the active  group and 3 in the placebo  group 
Dose s selected for each of the 3 cohorts is based on a 90-day safety, tolerab ility, PK and PD data 
review  from the Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01) in healthy subjects .  All doses selected for 
the MAD part of the study are projected not to exceed the mean exposure of that achieved in the 
SAD study.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Escalation for the MAD Portion  
The MAD portion of the study design is staggered , where after the [ADDRESS_380614] completed 2 weeks of follow-up after the second dose, Cohort 2 
begins dosing (after the DMC evaluation of the safety and tolerability data from Cohort 1).  
Similarly, after [ADDRESS_380615] completed 
2 weeks of follow-up after the second dose, Cohort 3 begins dosing after the DMC evaluation of 
the safety and tole rability data from Cohorts 1 and 2.  Each c ohort will continue at their assigned 
dose level through the ir respective 6-month treatment period s (See Study Schematic, Section  3.1).  
If patients discontinue the study in a cohort prior to adequate safety follow -up, he/she may be 
replaced.  
Criteria for dose escalation are further described in the DMC Charter.  See Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for  
additional details about DLTs .   
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Limiting T oxicity (DLT) 
Severity of adverse events will be graded according to National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE ) version 4.03.  For the purpose of dose 
escalation, any of the following AEs occurring after study drug administration, which are attributable to the study drug, will be considered DLTs: 
Hematologic:  
• Grade 4 neutrope nia 
• Grade 3 neutropenic infection

• Drug -induced liver injury  ([DILI ], Hy’s L aw), as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS].3 
Investigators should always manage their patients according to their medical judgment which 
may include interruption of study drug based on the particular clinical circumstances.  
[IP_ADDRESS] DMC Recommendations   
During scheduled meetings, the DMC will review relevant study data for safety or benefit- risk 
concern.  During the MAD part o f the study, t he DMC may provide the following 
recommendation s to the sponsor: 
• Expanding a cohort at a specific dosing level, or repeating a lower dose in a subsequent cohort 
• Continuing a dose level for a given cohort 
• Escalating a dose level  for a subsequent cohort 
• Termination of current or previous cohort(s)  
Further dosing in a given cohort will be halted if [ADDRESS_380617] into the POC Phase 2 part of the 
study.  This POC dose decision will be based on evaluation of the PK, safety (inclusive of dose- limiting toxicity [DLT]), and tolerability data (and available PD/biomarker data) from 
Cohorts 1, 2, and 3; this dose will not exceed doses tested during the MAD portion.  The DMC will be reviewing all relevant data from Cohorts 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_380618] dose .  Details are provided in the DMC Charter.  
3.1.2 POC  Phase 2   
[IP_ADDRESS] BOS161721 POC Dose Selection and Justification  
The dose for the POC portion of the study is 120 mg administered SC monthly (a total of 7 doses).  The rationale for the BOS161721-02 Phase 2 POC dose selection was based on cumulative safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, PK, and PD data available from an interim analysis (IA) performed during the M AD Phase  1b portion of the trial.

Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- 02 
Protocol Date and Version:  23 July 2019 ; V6.0 
Confidential   Page 42 of 139 The data cut -off for this IA occurred on  and included all 6 patien ts and 
7 doses from Cohort 1 (20 mg), 12 patients and 6  doses from Cohort 2 (60 mg) , and 12 patients 
and 4 doses from Cohort  3 (120 mg).  
The safety analysis focused on incidence and severity of all AEs, SAEs, and pre- determined 
adverse events of special interest  (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  The DMC and designated unblinded 
[LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals team met on  and did not identify any untoward 
safety signa ls at any BOS161721 dose levels. 
Because there were no safety, tolerability, or immunogenicity trends observed at the time of the 
IA, the Phase 2 POC dose selection was made based on available PK and PD data.  pSTAT3 
levels were assessed as the primary PD biomarker of IL -21R signaling levels.  This is because 
IL-21R signaling, upon IL-21 binding, initially involves phosphorylation of JAK1/JAK3 which 
dissociate from the receptor complex, and phosphorylate STAT3 which translocates to the nucleus and drives IL -21-regulated gene expression.  
 
. 
The 120 mg dose  was communicated to site investigators participating in the POC Phase 2 
portion, and to Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and the Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC). 
[IP_ADDRESS] POC Study Design 
For t he POC part of the study, approximately  156 additional patient s will be randomized to 
active or placebo groups in a 2:1  ratio.   
As in the MAD part of the study, e ach patient in the POC portion may receive a total of 7 SC 
monthly doses of study drug on Days 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180.  Assessments will be completed according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 and Table 4). 
DMC safety reviews will be conducted periodically throughout the study as described in the 
DMC charter .

All patients, investigators, and study team participants will be blinded to treatment assignment.  
An independent biostatis tician not otherwise involved on the study will be unblinded and prepare 
materials for the  IA, ad hoc analyses as needed,  and the DMC safety reviews.  The DMC will 
review unblinded data during safety reviews and the IA.  A limited team at [LOCATION_011] 
Pharmaceuticals will review unblinded results from the Phase 1 b MAD portion during the IA to 
determine the dose that will be used for the Phase 2 POC portion of the study.  Details regarding 
maintenance of the blinding and content of data reviews will be described in the DMC charter  or

• Vasectomy  
Note:  Women who are abstinent while participating in the study must continue to have 
pregnancy tests .  Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be 
discussed in the event that the patient chooses to forego complete abstinence.  
Azoospermic men and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt from 
contraceptive requirements.  However, WOCBP  must still undergo pregnancy testing. 
4.8 Deviation from Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
Deviation from the inclusion or exclusion criteria will not be allowed.  If deviation of inclusion/exclusion criteria is discovered after random ization, the investigator should contact [CONTACT_310218].  A decision will be made whether to allow a patient to continue or withdrawal from the study medication.    
See Section 6.8 for additional details.  
4.8.1 Patient  Withdrawal and Replacement  
See Section 5.5 for reasons for removal from the trial.  Withdrawn patients may be replaced

Procedures th at are part of standard of care are not considered study -specific procedures and may 
be performed prior to informed consent and used to determine eligibility.   
All screened patient s will be assigned a unique screening number.  The screening number will 
include a 3 -digit site number and a 4-digit sequential number to identi fy patient s from the time of 
screening.  Only eligible patients who are confirmed by [CONTACT_310219]/exclusion criteria , listed in Section  4.4 and Section 4.5 respectively, will be enrolled in 
the study.  Screened patient s who drop out of the clinical study before randomization will be 
recorded as screen failures .  If rescreen ing occurs, the site will assign a new screening  number.   
Specific procedures at the screening visit will include:  
• Medical history documentation 
• Review of inclusion and exclusion criteria 
o Patient  medical records must contain documentation of SLE diagnosis 
o C-SSRS   
• Concomitant medication documentation

A single retesting of laboratory parameters and/or other assessments during the screening period  
is permitted (in addition to any parameters that require a confirmatory value) only if:  
• medically indicated  
• there is evidence a laboratory sample was mislabeled, indet erminate, inadequately processed, 
and/or deteriorated in transit to the central laboratory  
Any new result will override the previous result (ie, the most current result prior to 
randomization) and is the value by [CONTACT_310170]/exclusion will be assessed, as it represents the patient’s most current clinical state.  This will also apply to patients who are being rescreened.  
5.2 Enrollment/Randomization and Day 0 Treatment  
Randomization should occur after patient  eligibility for enrollment has been conf irmed  by [CONTACT_310220] .  The central eligibility review team has the final decision on patient 
eligibility and can decide the patient is not eligible for the study based on their review of the eligibility packet.  
Prior to randomization, th e study site should confirm that the patien t still meets 
inclusion/exclusion criteria (especially SLE disease activity and treatment).  The site will obtain a randomization number when registering the patient in IWRS .  All patients will receive 
BOS161721 or placebo according to the kit number assigned by [CONTACT_310172].

6.2 Safety Assessments  
6.2.1 Laboratory Assessments  
Laboratory tests will be performed at times de fined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  1 and 
Table  4).  Patient eligibility will be determined based on these tests at screening.  Unscheduled 
clinical labs may be obtained at any time during the study to assess any perceived safety 
concerns.  
A central laboratory will be used  (with the exception of urine pregnancy tests) to ensure accuracy 
and consistency in test results.  Laboratory/analyte result s that could unblind the study (ie, 
biomarker results) will not be reported to investigative sites.   Urinalysis will be performed on 
midstream, clean catch specimens.   Some biomarkers listed above will not be drawn at some 
sites due to geographical logisti cal challenges.  See the laboratory manual for details.  
Endpoint analyses will be based on changes from baseline assessments at Days 120 and 210.

[IP_ADDRESS] Tuberculosis Screening  
During the screening period, it must be determined and documented that a patient does not have evidence of active or latent or inadequately treated TB per the exclusion criteria ( Section 4.5).  
The results of TB screening , which includes  the QuantiFERON
®-TB Gold In -Tube (QFT -G) test 
and a chest x-ray, conducted in the [ADDRESS_380655] be documented in study records prior to randomization (Day 0).  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Testing Using QuantiFERON Test40 
QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In -Tube (QFT- G) is an in vitro  diagnostic test using a peptide cocktail 
simulating ESAT -6, CFP-10, and TB 7.7 proteins to stimulate cells in heparinized whole blood.  
Detection of INFγ performed by [CONTACT_28745]-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is used to identify in vitro  responses to these peptide antigens that are asso ciated with Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis infection.  QFT -G is  an indirect test for M. tuberculosis infection (including disease) 
and is intended for use in conjunction with risk assessment, radiography and other medical and diagnostic evaluations. 
Test resul ts will be reported as positive, negative, or indeterminate.  A negative QFT- G test 
result is required to meet the inclusion criterion.  In the case of an indeterminate result, repeat 
tests should be permitted for the purpose of determining eligibility of patients to enroll in this 
study.  If a repeat test is indeterminate again, the patient is a screen failure.  The procedure for 
using this test and interpreting the results will be described fully in the laboratory manual, which will be provided to investi gators.  
6.2.2 Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence experienced by a study patient, whether 
or not considered drug related by [CONTACT_2026] i nvestigator.    
AEs are unfavorable changes in a general condition, subject ive or  objective signs or symptoms, 
worsening of pre- existing concomitant disease, and clinically significant abnormality  in 
laboratory parameters observed in a patient  in the course of a clinical study.

Confidential   Page 66 of 139 Non-serious SLE manifestations or abnormal laboratory re sults related to SLE  disease activity  
would not be recorded as AEs unless they meet the definition for SAEs ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Recording of Adverse Events 
AEs should be collected and recorded for each patient  from the date of the first dose of study 
drug until the end of their participation in the study, including the safety follow up period.   
AEs may be volunteered spontaneously by [CONTACT_4694] , or discovered by [CONTACT_14543], nonleading question such as ‘How have you 
been feeling since you were last asked?’   All AEs and any required remedial action will be 
recorded  on the Adverse Events e CRF  and Safety Adverse Event Form.  The details of the AE, 
date of AE onset, date of AE outcome, and action taken for  the AE will be documented together 
with the principal investigator’s assessment of the seriousness of the AE and causal relationship 
to the study drug and/or the study procedure. 
All AEs should be recorded individually, using diagnostic terms where possible.   If the diagnosis 
is not established,  individual symptom s may be reported .  The AEs will subsequently be coded 
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).    
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity of Adverse Events  
Each AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_310083] (NCI CTCAE), version 4.03 criteria.
 41  
When changes in the severity (grade) of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the event should be noted for that day.  Any change in severity of signs and symptoms over a number of days will be captured by [CONTACT_44745] a new AE, with the amended severity grade and the date (and time, if known) of the change. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Causality  of Adverse Events  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310084]161721 or placebo and 
the AE.  One of the following categories (Table 3) should be selected based on medical judgment, 
considering the definitio ns below and all contributing factors.

relationship to treatment administration and which concurrent disease or other 
drugs or chemicals cannot explain.  The response to withdrawal of the treatment (dechallenge
a) should be clinically plausible.  The event must be definitive 
pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory rechallengeb 
procedure if necessary.  
Unrelated  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no temporal 
relationship with treatment administration.  May have negative dechallenge and 
rechallenge information.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_261969] 
(eg, concomitant disease, environmental factors, or other drugs or chemicals).  
a Dechallenge:  Upon discontinuation of a drug suspected of causing an AE, the symptoms of the AE disappear 
partially or completely, within a reasonable  time from drug discontinuati on (positive dechallenge), or the 
symptoms continue despi[INVESTIGATOR_211386] (negative dechallenge).  Note that there are exceptions 
when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet drug relatedness clearly exists (for 
example, as in bone marrow suppression, fixed drug eruptions, or tardive dyskinesia).  
b Rechallenge:   Upon re -administration of a drug suspected of causing an AE in a specific patient in the past, 
the AE recurs upon exposure (positive rechallenge), or the AE does not recur  (negative rechallenge).  
An unexpected adverse drug event is any adverse drug event for which the specificity or severity 
is not consistent with the current IP. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Seriousness  of Adverse Events 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening; this means that the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it 
does not mean that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe 
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_211384] 
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is other important medical event (see below)  
Important medical events that do not result in death, are not life threatening, or do not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.   Examples of such events are:  
• Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm 
• Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• Development of drug dependency or drug abuse

(eg, elective surgery for a pre-existing condition that has not worsened) need not be considered SAEs.  If anything untoward is reported during the procedure, that occurrence must be reported 
as an AE, either 'serious' or 'nonserious' according to the usual criteria.  
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are AEs that are associated with the use of the drug and are serious and unexpected.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events of Special Interest  
AEs of special interest in this study include the following : 
1. Anaphylaxis and serious allergic reactions  
2. Grade s 2 to 5 injection site reaction, including erythema, pain, and induration 
(See APPENDIX 6) 
3. Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) assessed following Hy’s L aw 
4. Malignancy  (not including basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of skin)

6. Cryptosporidiasis 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Anaphylaxis and Serious Allergic Reactions  
Anaphylaxis will be defined according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (NIAID/FAA N) criteria.
42  In the event of 
anaphylactic reaction or severe/serious hypersensitivity/allergic reaction, the patient must 
discontinue IP and emergency resuscitation measures implemented.  In case of other mild to moderate hypersensitivity reaction, depending on the severity, the investigator may manage in accordance with the standard -of-care.  
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria is fulfilled: 
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal 
tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus, or flushing, swollen lips-tongue- uvula) and at 
least 1 of the following:

d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting) 
3. Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): 
a. Systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from the 
patient’s baseline  
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Injection Site Reactions 
Injection site reactions are to be captured and reported as AEs.  These will include Grades  2 to 5 
injection site erythema, pain, and induration (see APPENDIX  6), which are also captured as 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (See Section [IP_ADDRESS]) .  The investigator should provide a clear 
description of the observed or reported AE including location and severity.  All concomitant treatments used to treat injection site reactions should be recorded and captured in the eCRF, 
together wit h the AE of injection site reactions.   
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_380657] and/or ALT levels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of DILI, and as potential Hy’s Law cases, and should always be considered important medical events.   If symptoms compatible with DILI precede knowledge of 
serum chemical test abnormalities, liver enzyme measurements sh ould be made immediately, 
regardless of when the next visit or monitoring interval is scheduled.  In some cases, symptoms may be an early sign of injury and although typi[INVESTIGATOR_310038], they may indicate a need for prompt serum testing.   An increase in liver enzymes 
should be confirmed by a repeated test within [ADDRESS_380658] be reported as SAEs (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 for reporting details).  
Potential DILI is defined as:  
1. ALT or AST elevation > 3 × ULN 
AND  
2. Total bilirubin > 2 × ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline phosphatase) 
AND

hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre- existing chronic or acute 
liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic 
The patient  should return to the inve stigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, include 
laboratory tests, detailed history , and physical assessment.  In addition to repeating 
measurements of AST and ALT, laboratory tests should include albumin, CK, total bilirubin, 
direct and indi rect bilirubin, GGT , prothrombin time (PT)/International Normalized Ratio (INR), 
and alkaline phosphatase.  A detailed history, including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen, recreational drug and supplement consumption, family history, occupational exposure, sexual history, travel history, history of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary 
tract) may be warranted.  All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria 
defined above, with no other cause for liver function test (LFT) abnormalities identified at the time should be considered potential Hy’s Law cases irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the abnormal LFTs.  Such potential Hy’s Law cases should be reported as SAEs.  
Study drug discontinuation is consid ered if there is marked serum AST or ALT elevation or 
evidence of functional impairment  (as indicated by [CONTACT_310177], which represent 
substantial liver injury ) that is related to study drug.
  Discontinuation of treatment should be 
considered if:  
• ALT or AST > 8 × ULN  
• ALT or AST > 5× ULN for more than [ADDRESS_380660] occur if:   
• ALT or AST >3 × ULN and (total bilirubin  > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5) 
• ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (> 5%) 
[IP_ADDRESS].4 Malignancy 
The identification of a malignancy event will be made by [CONTACT_310221].  AEs should be reported as serious per the criteria i n Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
After the first dose of study drug, when there is a decision to biopsy a potentially malignant tumor, lymph node, or other tissue (with the exception of suspected basal cell/squamous cell) , 
the investigator and/or consultant(s) should contact [CONTACT_310222].   Basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell 
carcino ma of skin is not considered an AE of special interest.

cryptosporidium in the stool at screening, and as clinically indicated (eg, watery diarrhea) during 
the study.  If a patient develops diarrhea during the study a stool sample must be provided to tes t 
for ova, parasites, and cryptosporidium.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of Adverse Events  
AE reporting  will be carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations, including 
regulatory agency and IRB reporting requirements.    
Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for an SAE.  If an SAE occurs, 
expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate, and is further outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS].2. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Reporting of Pregnancy  
As information is available, a pregnancy diagnosed during the study will be reported within 
24 hours to the sponsor via the Pregnancy Notification and Outcome Form, including pregnancy 
in female patients who received study drug and female partners of male study patients who 
received study drug.  The pregnancy should be followed to term and/or outcome and this outcome should also be reported to the sponsor via the Pregnancy Notification and Outcome 
Form .  Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE or SAE unless there is complication.  
In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by [CONTACT_4692] (unless pre -procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and 
the findings are reported ). 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an  AE or  SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a live born, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs. 
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows: 
• Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion 
• Neonatal deaths that occur wi thin [ADDRESS_380662] to 
causality, as SAEs.  In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as serious

[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_380664] be made aware 
immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AE information.   This timeframe also applies 
to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAE reports as well as to the initial and follow -up reporting of exposure during pregnancy and exposure via breastfeeding 
cases.  In the rare event that the inv estigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE 
immediately (eg, if an outpatient study patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the AE.  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310086].  All SAEs will be recorded from the time of first dose 
of study drug through the safety follow -up period (up to Day 270).  SAEs  occurring after the 
final follow-up visit and coming to the attention of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310087] (in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_14371]) reasonable causal relationship with  
the study drug. 
As a minimum requirement, the initial notification should provide the following information: 
• Study number 
• Patient  number 
• Details of the SAE  (verbatim details are sufficient for immediate notification) 
• Criterion for classification as ‘serio us’ 
• Causality assessment ( which may be updated in a follow-up report when sufficient 
information is available to make this classification) 
Initial reports of SAEs must be followed later with detailed descriptions, including clear 
photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_211387] (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73529], consultant reports, autopsy reports, etc), with the study patient ’s personal identifiers removed.  All relevant information 
obtained by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_310088] s ponsor within [ADDRESS_380665] as possible.

becoming aware of the event and recorded as such on the Adverse Events eCRF and Safety 
Adverse Event Form. 
Potential DILI will be reported based on specifications mentioned in Section [IP_ADDRESS].3.   
Each AE of special interest is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for an SAE.  If 
an SAE occurs, expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate, and is further outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS].2. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Follow Up of Adverse Events 
All AEs will be followed up through the safety follow-up visits.  All SAEs experienced by a 
patient , irrespective of the suspected causality, will be monitored until the event has resolved, 
until any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline or stabilize d at a level acceptable 
to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310042] m onitor, until there is a satisfactory explanation for the 
changes observed, or until the patient is lost to follow-up.   
See Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 for details related to follow -up of pregnancy.  See Section  [IP_ADDRESS].3 for 
details related to follow -up of potential DILI.  See  Section  [IP_ADDRESS].4 for det ails related to 
follow-up of malignancy. 6.2.3 Vital Signs  
Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate , and body temperature) will be assessed as specified in the 
Schedule of Assessments (Table  1 and  Table  4).  Vital signs will be assessed on Day  0 at predose 
and at Day  0, 1 and 2 hours postdose, as well as on each of the scheduled visit days  during the 
study (excluding PK- only site visits).  Supi[INVESTIGATOR_310089]  ≥ 5 minutes.  When the timing of these measurements 
coincides with a blood collection, vital signs should be obtained prior to the time of the blood 
collection.  
6.2.4 12-Lead Electrocardiograms  
ECG will be assessed as specified in the Schedule of Assessments (Table  1 and Table  4).  ECG 
recording will initiate after the patient  has been supi[INVESTIGATOR_310090] [ADDRESS_380667] leads and a Lead II r hythm strip on the bottom of the 
tracing.  The ECG will be recorded at a paper speed of 25 mm/sec ond.  The following ECG 
parameters will be collected:  PR interval, QRS interval, RR interval, QT interval, and 
QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF).

abnormalities and will be captured electro nically and retained for future evaluation if required, 
up to the time of the clinical study report ( CSR) completion . 
6.2.[ADDRESS_380669] ems. 
The targeted (limited) physical examination will be completed at all other v isits as indicated in 
the Schedule of Assessments (Table  1 and Table  4).  It includes evaluation of patient  complaints 
and SLE disease- related issues, and will exclude the genitourinary system. 
6.2.6 C-SSRS  
The C- SSRS is a low -burden measure of the spectrum of suicidal ideation and behavior that was 
developed by [CONTACT_310223].  It is a clinical interview providing a summary of both ideation and 
behavior that can be administered during any evaluation or risk assessment to identify the level and type of suicidality present.  The C-SSRS can also be used during treatment to monitor for clinical worsening.
43 
The C -SSRS evaluation will be performed as specified in the Schedule of Assessments (Table  1 
and Table  4).  Patients with recent (within the past 12 months) or active suicidal ideation or 
behavior based on patient responding “yes” to question 3, 4, or [ADDRESS_380670] responses to the C- SSRS reviewed in detail to assess patient 
risk, and appropriate consultative mental health services will be provided. 
6.2.7 Injection Site Reactions 
Patients will be monitored for local injection site reactions  as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments (Table  1 and  Table  4).  Local injection site reactions will be assessed at [ADDRESS_380671]  (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS].3). 
6.2.8 Immunogenicity  
The serum samples to  measure the presence of ADA will be collected as specified in the 
Schedule of Assessments (Table  1 and  Table  4).  Blood samples (4 mL) to provide 
approximately 1.5 mL of plasma for anti BOS161721 antibody analysis will be collected into 
appropriately labeled tubes containing K
2EDTA.  The presence or absence of ADA will be 
determined in the serum samples using validated bioanalytical methods.  Blood samples for ADA analysis will be collected up to Day 90 from all patients.  Subsequent ADA samples will be

Protocol Date and Version:  23 July 2019 ; V6.[ADDRESS_380672] dose, if a patient  tests positive in the validated confirmatory ADA assay, a sample 
from this patient will be further analyzed in the neutralizing antibody (nAb) assay  by a central 
lab. 
6.3 Efficacy Assessments  
All efficacy assessments will be performed at times defined in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table  1 and Table  4). 
6.3.1 SLEDAI -2K 
The SLEDAI -2K is a validated instrument that measures disease activity in SLE patients at the 
time of the visit and in the previous 30 days.  It is a global index and includes 24 clinical and 
laboratory variables that are weighted by [CONTACT_310181], but not by [CONTACT_926].  The total 
score falls between 0 and 105, with higher scores representing increased disease activity.  The SLEDAI -2K has been shown to be a valid and reliable disease activity measure in multiple 
patient  groups.  A SLEDAI -2K of 6 or more generally represents moderately to severely active 
disease.
44 
6.3.2 BILAG  2004 
The BILAG -2004 index is an organ- specific 97-question assessm ent based on the principle of 
the doctor’s intent to treat.  Only clinical features attributable to SLE disease activity are to be recorded and based on the patient’s condition in the last 4 weeks compared with the previous 4 weeks.  It will be scored as n ot present (0), improved (1), the same (2), worse (3), or new 
(4).  Disease activity is graded separately for 9 body systems to 5 different grades (A to E) as follows: A (“Active”)  is very active disease, B  (“Beware”)  is moderate activity, C 
(“Contentment” ) is mild stable disease, D (“Discount”) is inactive now but previously active, and 
E (“Excluded”) indicates the organ was never involved.
[ADDRESS_380673] maintain documentation with descriptive details supporti ng the BILAG -2004 scoring (eg, chart, worksheet, 
clinic notes, and labs) at each visit.  
See APPENDIX  5 for detailed specifications. 
6.3.3 PGA of Disease Activity  
The PGA is used to assess investigator’s general impression on the patient’s overall status of 
SLE disease activity  via visual analogue scale (10 0 mm) with 0 being “very good, asymptomatic

Protocol Date and Version:  23 July 2019 ; V6.0 
Confidential   Page 76 of 139 and no limitation of normal activities” with 100 mm being “most severe possible disease ever 
seen in all SLE patients”.   PGA worsening is defined as an increase of > 30 mm  from baseline.  
When scoring the PGA, the assessor should always look back at the score from the previous visit.  
6.3.4 Composite Endpoints :  SRI -4, SRI-5, SRI -6, and BICLA Response  
[IP_ADDRESS] SRI-4 Response 
The SRI -4 is a composite index of SLE disease improvement that consists of scores derived from 
the SLEDAI -2K and the BILAG 2004 Index.  Response based on the SRI-4 is defined by:  
1) ≥ 4- point reduction in SLEDAI -2K global score, 2) no new severe disease activity (BILAG  A 
organ score) or more than 1 new moderate organ score (BILAG B), and 3) no deterioration from 
baseline in the PGA by ≥ [ADDRESS_380674] improve ments in clinical and patient-reported outcomes.45  
[IP_ADDRESS] SRI-5 and SRI -6 Response  
Like the SRI -4, the SRI-5 and SRI-6 are composite indices of SLE disease improvement that 
consists of scores derived from the SLEDAI -2K and the BILAG 2004 Index.  However, the 
SRI-5 and SRI-6 are computed with a minimal five-point or six-point improvement in 
SLEDAI -2K being required, respectively.46 
[IP_ADDRESS] BICLA Response 
The BICLA is a responder index developed to measure response to therapy, and it includes 
scores from the BILAG, SLEDAI -2K, and PGA.  BICLA response is defined as 1) at least 
1 gradation of improvement in baseline BILAG 2004 scores in all body systems with moderate disease activity at entry (eg, all B [moderate disease] scores falling to C [mild], or D [no 
activity ]); 2) no new BILAG A or more than 1 new BILAG B scores; 3) no worsening of total 
SLEDAI -2K score from baseline; 4) ≤ 10% deterioration in PGA score  and 5) no treatment 
failure .
44  It is driven primarily by [CONTACT_310182], and has been used in Phase 2 and 3 mAb 
studies.47 
For the endpoints of BICLA respons e at Days 210, 240, and 270, patient scores will be 
completed and response determined. 
6.3.5  CLASI Response  
The CLASI is a comprehensive tool for assessment of disease activity and damage in cutaneous 
lupus, shown to be valid, reliable, and sensitive to changes in disease activity. 48  Response is 
defined as 50% improvement from baseline in “A” or “B” scores.  This assessment will be 
applied to all patients as all are required to have cutaneous disease activity . 
For the secondary efficacy endpoint of CLASI response at Day 210, patient scores on MAD and 
POC studies will be compared with baseline for  50% improvement.

6.4 Other Variables  
6.4.1 SLICC/ACR Damage Index  
The SLICC/ACR damag e index is a validated instrument to assess damage, defined as 
irreversible impairment, continuously persistent for 6 months (ascertained by [CONTACT_13113]), occurring since the onset of lupus, and it is based on a weighted scoring system.
  
This index records damage occurring in patients with SLE regardless of cause, with 
demonstrated content, face, criterion, and discriminant validity.49  It will be performed on Days 0 
and 180. 
6.4.2 PROs  
Patients should be encouraged to complete the PROs at the clinic at the beginning of the study 
visit prior to any clinical assessments.  A member of the staff should be available if a patient 
requires further instruction and to review the PRO questionnaires for completeness prior to leaving the clinic.  The PROs include the  and the and will be assessed as 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments (Table  1 and Table  4).

blood samples for PK analysis of BOS161721 or placebo concentration will be collected 
according to  Table 4 and Table 1. 
Plasma concentrations of BOS161721 will be measured using a validated immunoassay.  The PK 
parameters will be calculated from the plasma concentration actual time profiles.   
6.6 Pharmacodynamic  Assessments  
Blood samples for PD parameters (plasma) will be collected at times indicated in  the Schedule of 
Assessments (Table  1 and  Table  4) for each of the following parameters:

8.1 Sample Size  
Sample size in the Phase 1b part of the study is based on operational consideration. 
The sample size in the Phase 2 portion is based on the primary endpoint, SRI- 4 Response at 
Day 210.  Approximately 156 additional patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 
BOS161721 versus placebo to achieve 132 evaluable patients  in the FAS.  This assumes

A per protocol (PP) analysis set may be defined to exclude major protocol violations from the 
efficacy analysis.  The PP Population will include all patients from the FAS  except those with 
major violations to the protocol deemed to impact the analysis of the primary endpoint.  These 
violations will be identified based on blinded data prior to study unblinding.  PP analyses will be conducted on the basis of the randomized t reatment.  
Safety analyses will be based on the safety analysis set (SS) , defined as all patients who receive 
at least 1  dose of study treatment.  Safety analyses will be conducted on the basis of actual 
treatment received .  
Pharmacokinetic analysis will be conducted on the PK analysis set, defined as the FAS with sufficient concentration data for the calculation of PK parameters.

Protocol Date and Version:  23 July 2019 ; V6.[ADDRESS_380682] date of prohibited medication  or 
unallowable CS usage for the primary efficacy analysis.  The determination of medication 
failures will be reviewed using blinded data and finalized prior to unblinding.   
The superiority of BOS161721 relative to placebo will be evaluated.  If the proportion of SRI -4 
responders for the selected POC dose in BOS161721 arm is higher than that of the placebo arm, 
then BOS161721 will be considered superior to placebo if the 2-sided p-value is less than 0.10.  Secondary and exploratory endpoints for this POC portion  will be evaluated based on the same 
statistical hypothesis.  
8.2.4 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s)  
Binary efficacy endpoints will be assessed via Pearson’s chi -squared analysis.  Continuous 
efficacy endpoints will be assessed via analysis of variance (ANOVA) or analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) and treatment will be compared using the F -test.  Repeated measures mixed models 
may be performed to evaluate data collected at each visit and overall.  Time -to-event endpoints 
will be assessed via Kaplan -Meier methodology and treatment will be compared using the log-
rank test.  The secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed on the FAS and if needed repeated in the PP analysis set.  Details including handling of missing data and “medication failures” wi ll 
be available in the SAP.  
8.2.5 Analysis of Safety  
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Analysis 
Safety analyses will be performed on the SS.  AE  data will be coded to system organ class and 
preferred term using MedDRA.  The  number and percentage of patients experiencing any 
treatment- emergent AE, overall, and by [CONTACT_310185] d preferred term, will be tabulated.  
Treatment -emergent AEs  will also be summarized  by [CONTACT_42564].   
Concomitant medications will be coded using the WHO Drug dictionary.  Observed values and changes from baseline in vital signs , ECG  readings, and hematology and clinical chemistry 
parameters will be summarized at each individual visit.   
8.2.6 Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Data 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Pharmacokinetic  Data  
PK parameters will be calculated from concentration data collected during the MAD Phase 1b portion of the study using non- compartmental analysis and include the following:  
• Cmax, Tmax, AUC, t ½, CL, V d 
The PK parameter data will be listed and summarized descriptively in tabular format.

regulatory authorities, as appropriate. 
The sponsor will appoint a DMC for the periodic review of available study data.  The DMC is an 
independent group of experts that advises the sponsor and the study investigators.  The members 
of the DMC serve in an individual capacity and provide their expertise and recommendations.  The primary responsibilities of the DMC  are to (1) periodically review and evaluate the 
accumulated study data for participant safety, study conduct, and progress, (2) make 
recommendations to the sponsor concerning the continuation, modification, or termination of the study and (3) suggest dose for POC portion of the study as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
The DMC considers study -specific data as well as relevant background knowledge about the 
disease, test agent, or patient population under study.  The DMC is responsible for defining its deliberative processes, including event triggers that would call for an unscheduled review, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_15381], unmasking (unblinding), and voting procedures prior to initiating any data review.  The DMC is also responsible for maintaining the confidentiality  of its internal 
discussions and activities as well as the contents of reports provided to it. 
The DMC will have access to unblinded treatment information during the clinical trial.  Details 
regarding management and process of this committee are found in t he DMC Charter.

Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- 02 
Protocol Date and Version:  23 July 2019 ; V6.[ADDRESS_380703] the health of the people.  The physician’s knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfillmen t of this duty. 
The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association binds the physician with the words, "The health of my subject will be my first consideration," and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, "A physician shall act onl y in the subject's interest when providing medical 
care which might have the effect of weakening the physical and mental condition of the subject." 
Medical progress is based on research, which ultimately must rest in part on experimentation 
involving human subjects.  
In medical research on human subjects, considerations related to the well -being of the human 
subject should take precedence over the interests of science and society.  
The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to improve prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic procedures and the understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of disease.  Even the best -proven prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods must 
continuously be challenged through research for their effe ctiveness, efficiency, accessibility,  and 
quality. 
In current medical practice and in medical research, most prophylactic, diagnostic, and 
therapeutic procedures involve risks and burdens.

Protocol Date and Version:  23 July 2019 ; V6.[ADDRESS_380704] or to others.  This does not preclude the participation of healthy volunteers in medical research.  The design of all studies should be publicly available. 
BOS161721 [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- 02 
Protocol Date and Version:  23 July 2019 ; V6.[ADDRESS_380705]’s information and to minimize the impact of the study on the subject's phys ical and 
mental integrity and on the personality of the subject. 
In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, 
methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail.  The subject should be informed of the right to abstain from participation in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal.  After ensuring that the subject has understood the information, the physician should then obtain the subject's freely-given informed consent, preferably in writing.  If the consent cannot be obtained in writing, the non- written 
consent must be formally documented and witnessed. 
When obtaining informed consent for the research project the physician should be particularly 
cautious if the subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under duress.  In that case the informed  consent should be obtained by a well-informed physician who 
is not engaged in the investigation and who is completely independent of this relationship. 
For a research subject who is legally incompetent, physically or mentally incapable of giving 
consent or is a legally incompetent minor, the investigator must obtain informed consent from the legally authorized representative in accordance with applicable law.  These groups should not be included in research unless the research is necessary to promote the h ealth of the population 
represented and this research cannot instead be performed on legally competent persons.  
When a subject deemed legally incompetent, such as a minor child, is able to give assent to decisions about participation in research, the inves tigator must obtain that assent in addition to 
the consent of the legally authorized representative.  
Research on individuals from whom it is not possible to obtain consent, including proxy or advance consent, should be done only if the physical/mental condition that prevents obtaining informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research population.  The specific reasons for involving research subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent should be stated in the experi mental protocol for consideration and approval of the

physician’s judgment it offers hope of saving life, re- establishing health, or alleviating suffering.  
Where possible, these measures should be made the object of research, designed to evaluate their 
safety and efficacy.  In all cases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, published.  The other relevant guidelines of this Declaration should be followed.

a. The MME conversion factor is intended only for analytic purposes where prescription data is used to calculate 
daily MME.  It is to be used in the formula:  Strength per Unit × (Number of Units/ Days Supply) × MME 
conversion factor = MME/Day.  This value does not constitute clinical guidance or recommendations for 
converting patients from one form of opi[INVESTIGATOR_310063].  Please consult the manufacturer’s full 
prescribing information for such guidance.   Use of this file for the purposes of any clinical decision -making 
warrants caution.

Protocol Date and Version:  23 July 2019 ; V6.0 
Confidential   Page 104 of 139 d. The MME conversion factor fo r buprenorphine patches is based on the assumption that 1 milligram of 
parenteral buprenorphine is equivalent to 75 milligrams of oral morphine and that one patch delivers the 
dispensed micrograms per hour over a 24 hour day.  Example:   5 μg/hr buprenorphine patch × 
24 hrs = 120 ug/day buprenorphine = 0.12 mg/day = 9 mg/day oral MME.  In other words, the conversion factor 
not accounting for days of use would be 9/[ADDRESS_380707] multiplied the conversion factor 
by 7 (1.8 × 7 = 12.6).  In this example, MME/day for 4  5 μg/hr buprenorphine patches dispensed for use over 
28 days would work out as follows:  Example:   5 μg/hr buprenorphine patch × (4 patches/28 days) × 
12.6 = 9 M ME/day.  Please note that because this allowance has been made based on the typi[INVESTIGATOR_310067] 
[ADDRESS_380708], i.e., Days Supply for buprenorphine patches  = number  of patches x 7 . 
e. The MME conversion factor for fentanyl buccal tablets, sublingual tablets, and lozenges/troche is 0.13.  This 
conversion factor should be multiplied by [CONTACT_310198] a given tablet or lozenge/troche.  
f. The MME conversion factor for fentanyl film and oral spray is 0.18.  This reflects a 40% greater bioavailability 
for films compared to lozenges/tablets and 38% greater bioavailability for oral spray s compared to 
lozenges/tablets.  
g. The MME conversion factor for fentanyl nasal spray is 0.16, which reflects a 20% greater bioavailability for sprays compared to lozenges/tablets.  
h. The MME conversion factor for fentanyl patches is based on the a ssumption that 1 milligram of parenteral 
fentanyl is equivalent to 100  milligra ms of oral morphine and that 1 patch delivers the dispensed micrograms 
per hour over a 24 hour day.  Example:  25 μg/hr fentanyl patch × 24 hrs = 600 ug/day fentanyl = 60 mg/day 
oral morphine milligram equivalent.  
In other words, the conversion factor not acc ounting for day s of use would be 60/[ADDRESS_380709] multiplied the conversion factor by 3 (2.4 × 3 = 7.2).   In this example, MME/day for 10 25 μg/hr fentanyl patches dispensed for use over 3 0 days 
would work out as follows:   
Example:   25 μg/hr fentanyl patch × (10 patches/30 days) × 7.2 = 60 MME/day.   Please note that because this 
allowance has been made based  on the typi[INVESTIGATOR_310067] [ADDRESS_380710], i.e., Day s Supply for fentanyl patches  = number  
of patches × 3. 
i. The CDC MME conversion factor to calculate morphine milligram equivalents is 3.   CMS uses this conversion 
factor when analyzing M edicare population opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441].  CMS uses the graduated methadone MME conversion 
factor s to calculate MME within the OMS  for identifying and reporting potential opi[INVESTIGATOR_310068]. 
https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/pdf/calculating_total_daily_dose -a.pdf.  
j. Tapentadol is a mu receptor agonist and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_26331].  Oral MMEs are based o n degree of 
mu-receptor agonist activity, but it is unknown if this drug is associated  with overdose in the same 
dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely mu receptor agonists .

Day [ADDRESS_380748] be held constant due to the endpoint evaluations occurring 
at Da y 120 and Day 210. 
• Once a patient has received the first dose of study drug (after 
Day 0), prednisone (or prednisone equivalent) dose is highly 
encouraged to continue tapering down as appropriate.  The 
investigator should evaluate the prednisone dose at each visit and 
make the decision, within the protocol allowed windows.  
o Exception:  Between Day  60 and Day 120, and between Day 
150 and Day  210 (ie, within 60  days of primary and secondary 
endpoint assessments), oral CS doses must be held constant.  
After Da y 0 (first dose of study drug), a maximum of 1 oral CS “burst” 
for increased SLE disease activity will be allowed between Day 0 and 
Day 60, according to the following:   
• The oral CS dose is allowed to increase to ≤ 40 mg/day of 
prednisone or equivalent, wh ich must be tapered down to 
≤ 10 mg/day within 2  weeks of initiation of the “burst”  
o Alternatively, a single intramuscular (IM) dose of 
methylprednisolone (40 mg or equivalent) is permitted 
o No increase of oral CS above baseline is permitted beyond 
Day 60 
Treatment with inhalational CS therapy (eg, for asthma), or by [CONTACT_310241], but systemic administration, is allowed.

Title:  A Randomized Double -Blind Phase  1b/2 Combined Staggered Multiple 
Dose Escalation Study of BOS161721 in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus 
(SLE)  Patients on a Background of Limited Standard of Care 
Indication  Adults with moderately to severely active SLE  
Background 
and Rationale SLE is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease with considerable 
heterogeneity in clinical manifestations and disease course.  There is evidence that B - and T- cells are critical to the development of the disease, 
and that T- cell-derived cytokines such as 
interl eukin -21 (IL- 21) are involved 
in the SLE- associated inflammatory pathological response.    
BOS161721 is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) triple mutation monoclonal antibody (mAb) intended to have an extended terminal 
elimination half- life (t
½) that selectively binds to and neutralizes  IL-21, 
which acts on multiple cell types that drive  inflammation and autoimmunity.  
In vivo , BOS161721 inhibits T- cell dependent antigen responses of B -cells 
and is being developed as a potential  treatment for adult s with moderately to 
severely active SLE.    
No
nclinical studies have evaluated  the toxi city, pharmacodynamics (PD), 
toxicokinetics (TK), pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of BOS161721 administered intravenously (IV) and subcutaneously (SC).  The no obs erved adverse effect level (NOAEL) in Cynomolgus monkeys w as 
determined to be 100 mg/kg (SC and IV) , the highest dose tested.  There 
were no injection site reactions in animals dosed subcutaneously. 
In a Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) study, BOS161721 was 
administered IV and SC to healthy male and female adult subjects.  This 
double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated 8 ascending dose levels (1 [IV], 3 [SC], 10 [SC], 22 [IV], 30 [SC], 60 [SC], 120 [SC], or 
240 [SC] mg) for safety, tolerability, PK, PD and immunogenicity.  Overall, 
there were no clinically significant safety or tolerability findings from this 
study.  
Results from the Phase 1 SAD study informed the dose regimens used for the 
multiple ascending doses (MAD) Phase 1b  portion of this trial.  The MAD 
portion will involve  3 cohorts.  The Phase 2 portion will be a proof of 
concept (POC) part, where dose selection will be based on the data 
monitoring c ommittee (DMC) and sponsor ’s assessment of safety, 
tolerability, immunogenicity, and PK and PD data from the MAD portion  of 
30 patien ts treated with BOS161721/placebo.  The purpose of the study is to 
establish a safe and effective dosage for adult patients with moderately to 
severely active SLE.

Study Design:  This is a Phase 1b/[ADDRESS_380791] of 
2 double-blinded portions :  MAD Phase [ADDRESS_380792] of 3 cohorts, with 
Cohort 1 containing 6 patient s, where 5 of these patients will receive 
BOS161721 (active), and 1 will receive placebo.  Cohorts 2 and 3 will each 
contain 12 patient s, including 9 active and 3 placebo patient s.  Dose selection 
for each cohort is based on 90-day safety, tolerability, PK, and PD data 
review from the Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01) in healthy subjects .  
Each of the 3 doses (20, 60, and 120 mg) selected for the MAD portion are 
projected not to exceed the mean exposure of that achieved in the SAD  study 
following the single  240 mg SC dose.  Each patient  may receive a total of

tolerability data from  Cohort 1) .  Similarly, after [ADDRESS_380794] into the POC part of the  study.  Th is dose will not exceed 
doses tested during the MAD portion .   
For the POC portion, approximately 156  additional patient s will be 
randomized to active or placebo groups in a 2:1 ratio.  As in the MAD 
portion, e ach patient  in the POC portion may receive a total of 7 SC monthly 
doses on Days 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180.   
A maximum daily dose of 30 mg/day of oral CS will be acceptable for 
eligibility for the study, however, daily dose must be tapered down to a 
maximum of 10  mg/day for at least 5 days prior to Day 0 (randomization 
day).  One  oral CS “burst ” for increased SLE disease activity may occur 
during the study between Day 0  and Day 60.  Tapering of steroids during the 
course of the study will be highly encouraged and s hould be evaluated at the 
protocol permitted visits (D ay 0 through D ay 60 and D ay 120 through 
Day 150).  Between Day  [ADDRESS_380795] be held constant due to the endpoint evaluations occurring at Day  120 and Day 210. 
DMC safety reviews will be conducted periodically throughout the study as 
described in the DMC charter .

Statistical 
Considerations Below is a summary of the statistical methods.   Further details can be found in 
Section 8. 
Two analyses are planned:  1) an interim a nalysis to select the POC dose 
based on the MAD  data, and 2) a final analysis at study completion.  
Additionally, DMC safety analyses will be performed for each MAD cohort 
and throughout the POC to monitor patient safety  as described in the DMC 
charter .  An additional analysis may be performed for the MAD portion of the 
study when all MAD  patients have completed the safety follow -up, or 
withdrawn from the study, and prior to the final analysis.  Data from the POC 
part of the study will be excluded from this additional analysis. 
Unless stated otherwise, statistical testing will only be performed on the POC 
data and will be done using 2-sided overall alpha of 0.10.  Data will be 
summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_310242].  For the MAD portion, BOS161721 will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_310243].   
The descriptive summaries for the categorical data will include number and 
percentage.  The descriptive summaries for the continuous data will include 
number, mean, median, standard deviations  (SD) , 25th and 75th percentiles ,

Protocol Date and Version:  23 January  2019; V 5.[ADDRESS_380803] error will be presented for time -to-event data. 
All safety analyses will be performed using the safety analysis set (SS), 
defined as all patients who receive at least 1  dose of study treatment.  All  
efficacy analyses will be performed using the full analysis set (FAS), defined 
as all patients  who receive at least [ADDRESS_380804] efficacy analyses may 
also be performed on the per protocol (PP) s et. 
Binary efficacy endpoints, including the primary efficacy endpoint, will be 
assessed  via Pearson’s chi -squared analysis.   
Continuous efficacy endpoints will be assessed via analy sis of variance 
(ANOVA) or analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)  when applicable, adjusting 
for the baseline value.  R epeated measures mixed model s may be performed 
to evaluate data collected at each visit and overall.   Time -to-event endpoints 
will be assessed via Kaplan -Meier methodology and treatment will be 
compared using the log-rank test.   
Adverse event data will be coded to system organ class and preferred term 
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) .  The 
number and percentage of patients  experiencing any treatment-emergent AE, 
overall, and by [CONTACT_89794].  Treatment -emergent AEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_310206].   
Concomitant medications will be summarized, based on coded terms, using frequency and percentage of patients.  Observed values and changes from baseline in vital signs, ECG readings, and hematology and clinical chemistry parameters, will be summarized at each individual visit.

1.1 Indication  
BOS161721 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb), which binds to and inhibits 
interleukin -21 (IL-21) bioactivity, and is being develope d for the treatment of moderately to 
severely active systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) in adults.  
1.2 Background  and Rationale  
1.2.1 Overview of the Disease State  
SLE is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that has variable manifestations in multiple 
organ systems and follows a relapsing and remitting course .  The disease process includes  
abnormal immune responses mediated by [CONTACT_59627]-binding autoantibodies and immune complex deposition, giving rise to tissue damage often resulting in end organ disease and even mortality.  Survival of SLE has improved due to earlier detection , improved overall medical care,  and 
standardized  SLE treatment with corticosteroi ds (CS) , immunosuppressants, and cytotoxic 
agents.
[ADDRESS_380813] common cause of death during later disease .2   
The reported prevalence of SLE in the [LOCATION_002] (US) is 20 to 70 cases per 100,000 people.3  
More than 90% of cases of SLE occur in women, frequent ly starting at chil dbearing age.  
Women of color  are disproportionately affected by [CONTACT_113919].  This suggests multiple genetic and 
environmental factors are at play.  Accordingly, a multifactorial view of the 
immunopathogenesis of SLE suggests more than [ADDRESS_380814], including breach in central tolerance in the adaptive arm of the immune system, peripheral amplification of the autoimmune 
response by [CONTACT_310147], and local processes in the target organ that facilitate end-organ disease.

1.2.2 B
OS161721 Development  
[LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals is developi[INVESTIGATOR_310031]161721 for the treatment of SLE.  BOS161721 is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1)  mAb with extended half -life directed against 
human  IL-21.   
Murine mAb 19E3, the progenitor of BOS161721, was generated using mouse hybridoma technology.  19E3 has subpi[INVESTIGATOR_36379] (pM) affinity to human IL- 21 and was selec ted for its potent 
neutralization of IL -21 bioactivity.  BOS161721 was generated by [CONTACT_310148] 
19E3 where its complementarity-determining regions were grafted onto a human IgG1 kappa backbone.  The fragment crystallizable (Fc) portion of BOS161721 contains a YTE (M252Y/S254T/T256E triple mutation) in the constant domain of the IgG1 heavy chain that was introduced into the parental molecule, 19E3, intended to prolong the in vivo  terminal elimination 
half- life ( t
½) of the mAb.5  Thus, BOS161721 r etains sub -pM binding to IL-21 and prevents 
IL-21 from binding to the IL-21 receptor (IL-21R), inhibiting IL-21 bioactivity.   
BOS161721 [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- 02 
Protocol Date and Version:  23 January  2019; V 5.0 
Confidential   Page 25 of 116 BOS161721 binds to human IL -21 and Cynomolgus monkey IL-21, which are highly 
homologous, and neutralizes the bioactivity of both.  BOS161721 is specific for IL- 21 as it does 
not bind to or inhibit the other gamma- chain (γc) family  of cytokines , and acts to specifically 
neutralize the IL -[ADDRESS_380815].  In in vitro  studies, BOS161721 inhibited downstream IL-21-
induced signaling, IL -21-induced plasma cell differentiation, and IL-21- induced natural killer 
(NK) cell activation.  In in vivo  studies, BOS161721 significantly inhibited the T-cell dependent 
antibody response (TDAR) to immunization with a protein antigen as well as B- cell exp ansion 
following a second protein antigen immunization in Cynomolgus monkeys.    
[IP_ADDRESS] Interleukin -[ADDRESS_380816] cytokines in this family are critically important for both 
the maintenance and function of T-cell and B- cell responses.  IL -21 signals through a receptor 
complex consisting of its own private r eceptor, the IL -21R and γc.6,7  Engagement of the 
IL-21R/γc complex leads to the activation of several signaling pathways, including the Janus 
kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription, mitogen- activated protein kinase (MAPK) 
and phosphoinositide 3- kinase pathways.[ADDRESS_380817] array of cell types, including B- cells, T -cells, NK -cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, 
as well as other hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells such as fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and 
intestinal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663].9,11  Activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3  
(STAT3 ) via phosphorylation is critical  in regulating human B- cell responses to IL -2112; 
phosphorylated STAT3  (pSTAT3) forms a homodimer, which translocates to the nucleus where 
it initiates transcription of the IL -21 gene , forming an autocrine loop for IL-21 production via 
STAT3 phosphorylation.13  In addition, IL -21 has been shown to upregulate expression of its 
own receptor14 and induces an autocrine feedback loop.15 
IL-21 modulates various aspects of immune function.  It  promotes cluster of differentiation 4 
(CD4+ ) T-cell differentiation and promotes the generation of T -helper (Th)1716 and T- follicular 
helper (Tfh) cells.15,17  In mice, IL -21 has been shown to regulate the balance between Th17 and 
regulatory T- cell (Treg), in that it increases Th17, while inhibiting Treg differentiation.[ADDRESS_380818] disease induced by [CONTACT_74934] T- cells.20  IL-21 upregulates CD8+ 
T-cell and NK -cell expansion and cytolytic activity by [CONTACT_310149] B and perforin.21,22  
IL-21 also has been reported to increase granzyme B in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B -cells 
resulting in inhibition of T- cell responses.23,24  IL-21 also has a variety of effects on 
nonhematopoietic cells, such as stromal cells and induces inflammation through matrix metalloproteinase release by [CONTACT_310207].
25 
One principal non-redundant role of IL-21 is the promotion of B- cell activation, differentiation , 
or death during humoral immune responses.14  Furtherm ore, increased IL -21 production is 
characteristic of several autoimmune diseases and is likely to contribute to autoantibody production as well as pathologic features of autoimmune disease.
 26  The critical role of IL -21 in 
promoting humoral and other immune responses makes it an important focus of potential

reported to correlate with IL -[ADDRESS_380819] elevated IL -21

studies (GWAS) have provided convincing evidence that the chromosomal 4q 27 region harbors 
the IL -21 genes and is associated with chronic inflammatory disorders, including SLE.29   
[IP_ADDRESS] Preclinical Studies  
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of BOS161721 were characterized following single- dose intravenous 
(IV) administration of BOS161721 (0.01 to 30 mg/kg) in male Cynomolgus monkeys or repeat, every 2 weeks IV administration (15 to 100 mg/kg) and subcutaneous (SC) admini stration 
(50 mg/kg) in male and female Cynomolgus monkeys.  Systemic exposure was approximately dose-proportional within the tested dose range.  SC bioavailability was determined to be 64.3%.  
 
 
Two single-dose (IV) non-good laboratory practice (GLP) studies conducted in Cynomolgus monkeys evaluated the toxicity, pharmacodynamics (PD), toxicokinetics (TK), and immunogenicity of BOS161721.  Following a single IV administration (slow bolus), there were no BOS161721- related adverse changes, resulting in a no -observed -adverse- effect -level 
(NOAEL) value of 30  mg/kg, the highest dose tested among 2 studies.  
 
In a repeat -dose GLP toxicology study in Cynomolgus monkeys, BOS161721 was administered 
every 2 weeks by [CONTACT_310152] (50 mg/kg) administration for 3 months (a total of 7  doses).

BOS161721-01 was a double-blind, Phase 1, single ascending dose (SAD) study to assess the 
safety, PK , and PD of BOS161721 in healthy subjects.  The primary objective of the study was 
to characterize the safety and tolerability of IV and SC SADs  of BOS161721 in an otherwise 
healthy subject population without concomitant illnesses, immune abnormalities, or concomitant 
medications.  Secondary objectives include d characterization of the PK and immunogenicity of 
BOS161721, and exploratory objectives included the evaluation of the effect of BOS161721 on TDAR to keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( KLH) (primary and secondary immunizations) in healthy 
subjects, the effects of BOS161721 on plasma levels of IL -21 (free and bound), and the 
evaluation of the effect of BOS161721 on IL -21 gene expression (via gene signature) in blood.  
This study consist ed of 8 cohorts.  Subj ects were  randomized in a 3:1 ratio (BOS161721: 
placebo) and received either a single dose of BOS161721 (1 [IV], 3 [SC], 10 [SC], 22 [IV],

Blood samples were collected at every in -house study visit for BOS161721 concentration 
determinations.  Blood samples were also collected for determination of IL -21 plasma levels 
(free and total).  Safety was assessed based on the occurrence of treatment -emergent AEs, 
hepatic function abnormality, and acute and delayed hypersensitivity reactions.  Other safety 
variables include d ECGs, vital signs (blood pressure [BP], heart rate , and temperature), safety 
laboratory assessments, blood sampling for ADA s, tota l IgG and immunoglobulin M ( IgM) 
levels,  CD4+ count, and full and targeted physical examinations.  Overall, there were no 
clinically significant findings from this study .  Adverse event s reported as related to the study 
drug, particularly infections, were expected for the compound, and there were no clinically relevant changes in laboratory  and ECG  results or vital signs.  There was 1 serious adverse event 
(SAE ; death  due to pulmonary embolism) that occurred 127 days after a single administration of

data and sequentially consider dose escalation for  Cohorts [ADDRESS_380823] into the proof of concept ( POC) Phase 2  portion.  This  POC dose decision will be based 
on evaluation of the PK , safety  (inclusive of dose- limiting toxicity [DLT]), and tolerability data

The benefit of participation for all patient s in this study is close monitoring of their medical 
condition and safety of their treatment.  Those randomized to the active treatment arm may 
potentially experience improvement in their SLE  disease.  Those randomized to the placebo (in 
combination with standard of care) arm are not expected to obtain any additional benefit, beyond those of their background treatment, though close monitoring of their medical condition and safety may itself be associated with improving their SLE .   
1.2.5 Potential Risks  
Potential risks based on the m echanism of action of BOS161721 include inf ections, risks 
associ ated wit h the administration of any foreign pro tein or biologic agent, including injection 
site r eaction, anaphy laxis, serious allerg ic reaction, and deve lopment of AD As.  ADAs  could 
result in immune c omplex disea se (with mani festations su ch as arthralgias, serum- sickn ess, and 
vasculiti s), or altered BOS161721 leve ls or activity.  Further details can be found in the current 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for BOS161721, which contains comprehensive toxicology, preclinical and clinical information on BOS161721. 
Two investigational drug products are considered to be in the same pharmacological class as BOS161721 based on interruption of signaling through the IL-[ADDRESS_380826].  No potential risk generalizable across the class has been observed with t hese investigational 
products.  Based on the clinical Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), AEs reported as related to the study drug, particularly infections (flu- like symptoms, etc.), were expected for the 
compound, and there were no clinically relevant changes in laboratory and ECG results or vital signs.  
The majority of IgG elimination occurs via intracellular catabolism, following fluid -phase or 
receptor -mediated endocytosis.  This type of endocytosis and elimination is a form of 
target-mediated disposition where the interaction of the drug and its pharmacological target 
(eg, a target receptor) serves as a significant contributor to the kinetics of antibody distribution and elimin ation.  Renal elimination, which is a primary pathway of clearance of small -molecule 
drugs, is relatively unimportant for IgG, as its large size prevents efficient filtration through the glomerulus.  Secretion into the bile is an important pathway of elimination of IgA antibodies, but 
BOS161721 [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- 02 
Protocol Date and Version:  23 January  2019; V 5.0 
Confidential   Page 31 of 116 this route is not a significant contributor to the elimination of IgG antibodies.  Thus, risk to renal 
and hepatic systems due to metabolism of BOS161721 is low.33 
[IP_ADDRESS] Anaphylaxis and Serious Allergic Reactions 
As with the administration of any foreign protein and/or other biological agents, acute 
hypersensitivity reactions, including acute anaphylactic/hypersensitivity, severe allergic, and anaphylactoid reactions may follow infusion of mAbs and can be caused by [CONTACT_62535].  These acute hypersensitivity reactions may be severe and result in death.  
Anaphylaxis will be defined according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (NIAID/FAAN) criteria ,
34 and are discussed in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].1. 
Based on the Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), anaphylaxis and serious allergic reactions in 
subjects who received BOS161721 was not observed.   
Patients with a known history of allergy or severe hypersensitivity reaction to any component of 
BOS161721 formulation or patients with a history of anaphylaxis to any other biological therapy such as mAbs will be excluded from stu dies with BOS161721.  In addition, appropriate drugs 
and medical equipment to treat acute hypotensive, bronchoconstrictive, or anaphylactic reactions will be immediately available at the unit and study personnel will be trained to recognize and 
treat these  reactions.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Injection Site Reactions 
In a repeat -dose GLP toxicology study in Cynomolgus monkeys, BOS161721 was administered 
every 2 weeks by [CONTACT_310154] 3 months (a total of 7  doses) .  There were no injection site 
reactions in animals dosed subcutaneousl y.  Further, there were no reports of inj ection site 
reactions in the 26-week GLP toxicology study in Cynomolgus monkeys. 
Based on the Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721- 01), incidence of injection site reactions in 
subjects who received BOS161721 was similar to  placebo .   
Patients will be monitored for local injection site reactions in this study.  See Section 6.2.7.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Immune Complex Disease 
The potential risk of immune complex disease for BOS161721 is theoretical, based on the known 
risks associated with mAbs.  The administration of a mAb can result in the formation of ADAs.  Administration of the mAb in the presence of ADA may result in the formation of circulating antibody-antigen complexes potentially resulting in altered BOS161721 levels or activity or deposition of the complexes in microvasculature.  Complement is frequently involved in the latter setting, and the breakdown products of complement attract polymorphonuclear leukocytes to the site of deposition where they can provoke local tissue damage through specific or nonspecific release of enzymes.  Two of the more common end -organ targets are the blood 
vessels (vasculitis) and kidney ( nephritis).  These clinical manifestations represent immune 
complex disease or Type III hypersensitivity.  Although BOS161721 is a humanized mAb, 
BOS161721 [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- 02 
Protocol Date and Version:  23 January  2019; V 5.0 
Confidential   Page 32 of 116 ADAs may develop; however, the likelihood of occurrence of immune complex disease with 
BOS161721 is low.  The findings of immune complex disease are typi[INVESTIGATOR_310078]- antigen complexes are cleared from the body . 
Based on the Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), immune complex disease in subjects who received BOS161721 was not observed . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Infections  
BOS161721 is expected to diminish the activity of T- cell, B -cell and NK- cell lines.  Like other 
medications modulating immune response, BOS161721 may increase the potential risk for  
infection, including serious infections.  IL-21 produced by [CONTACT_398]4+ Th cells is required to sustain the anti-viral function of CD8+ T- cells against chronic viral infections.  Nonclinical evidence 
suggests that the risk of chronic viral infection recurrence or increased severity may occur with IL-21 inhibition.
35 
These conditions will be fully characterized with clinical descriptions and routine laboratory and/or specialty testing and treated where indicated with appropriate local standard of care. 
Patients with a history of opportunistic infection, including recurrent or severe  disseminated 
herpes zoster or disseminated herpes simplex  within the last 3 years , or any other underlying 
pathology predisposing to serious infection, are excluded from studies with BOS161721 (for 
further details please refer to t he current IB for BOS161721). 
Patients will be assessed for hepatitis B, and C, and HIV-1/[ADDRESS_380827] been observed in immunosuppressed liver transplant and human immunodeficiency virus patients.
36,37  Since 
BOS161721 is expected to diminish the immunosurveillance activity of T- cell, B -cell, and 
NK-cell lines, a similar risk is biologically plausible with prolonged exposure to BOS161721. 
Since the risk of opportunistic cryptosporidium infection increases with low levels of CD4+  T-cells,
37 patients with a CD4+ count < 500 cell/mm3 were excluded from the Phase 1 
SAD study (BOS161721-01), and CD4 + < 350 cells/mm3 will be excluded from the MAD/POC

The stimulatory effect of IL -21 on NK cells and CD8+ T- cells suggests the cytokine may have 
anti-tumor activity.  Nonclinical studies have demonstrated significant anti- tumor effects of 
IL-21 in a number of tumor models.  IL- 21 therapy of human metastatic melanoma and renal cell 
carcinoma has demonstrated POC with significant increases in levels of perforin, granzyme B, 
and interferon gamma (IFNγ) expression in CD8+ T- cells and NK  T-cells.  Clinical response has 
been limited in these generally unmanageable diseases.  
The impact of treatment with anti- IL-21 therapy on the development or growth of malignancies 
is not known; however, as with other immunomodulatory biologic agents, treatment with BOS161721 may result in an increase in the risk of malignancies.  NK cell suppression by [CONTACT_8668] -[ADDRESS_380828] 5 years, with the ex ception

Based on the Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), malignancy in subjects who received BOS161721 was not observed.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatic Function Abnormality  
There is no substantial evidence suggesting BOS161721 is associated with liver function 
abnormality.  However, as a precaution, p atients with a history of abnormal alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT)  and/or aspartate ami notransferase (AST), or bilirubin at screening 
(ALT /AST  > 2 × upper limit of normal [ULN] ; total bilirubin >  1.5 × [ULN] and judged by [CONTACT_119278]) were excluded from the Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), and will be excluded from this trial.  Patients with a positive hepatitis B or C 
test or a history of alcohol dependence will also be excluded.  
Based on the Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), hepatic function abnormality in subjects who received BOS161721 was not observed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Failure of Vaccination  
IL-21 is a key cytokine in development of B-cells into immunoglobulin- secreting plasma cells.  
Abnormal signaling through the IL-21R/Janus Kinase (JAK)3/signal transducer and activator of 
transcription (STAT3 ) pathway leads to defect ive humoral immune responses to both 
T-dependent and T-independent antigens and impairs the establishment of long- lasting B -cell 
memory.  Abnormal signaling through the pathway has been related to decreased specific antibody responses following vaccination, and to increased susceptibility to encapsulated bacterial infections.
[ADDRESS_380829] of BOS161721 was evaluated in in vivo  single dose studies in Cynomolgus monkey in 
which the animals received vaccination to T -cell dependent KLH antigen to stimulate a TDAR .  
These in vivo  studies demonstrated that BOS161721 significantly inhibited B- cell proliferation 
and IgG antibody responses to the KLH protein antigen in a dose-dependent fashion; however,

Drug -drug interactions were not evaluated in the Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), which 
included only healthy adult subje cts.  Use of prescription medications (with the exceptions of 
oral contraceptives), and over- the-counter (OTC) treatments including herbal supplements such 
as St John’s Wort (except multivitamins), in the 2 weeks prior to screening was prohibited  in the

(placebo group) 
• Cohorts 2 (60  mg SC) and 3 (120 mg  SC) will include 12 patient s each  
o 9 patients in the active  group and 3 in the placebo  group 
Dose s selected for each of the 3 cohorts is based on a 90-day safety, tolerab ility, PK and PD data 
review  from the Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01) in healthy subjects .  All doses selected for 
the MAD part of the study are projected not to exceed the mean exposure of that achieved in the 
SAD study.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Escalation for the MAD Portion  
The MAD portion of the study design is staggered , where after the [ADDRESS_380833] completed 2 weeks of follow-up after the second dose, Cohort 2 
begins dosing (after the DMC evaluation of the safety and tolerability data from Cohort 1).  
Similarly, after [ADDRESS_380834] completed 
2 weeks of follow-up after the second dose, Cohort 3 begins dosing after the DMC evaluation of 
the safety and tolerability data from Cohorts 1 and 2.  Each c ohort will continue at their assigned 
dose level through the ir respective 6-month treatment period s (See Study Schematic, 
Section  3.1).  If patients discontinue the study in a cohort prior to adequ ate safety follow -up, 
he/she may be replaced.  
Criteria for dose escalation are further described in the DMC Charter.  See Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for  
additional details about DLTs .   
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Limiting T oxicity (DLT) 
Severity of adverse events will be graded according to National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Even ts (NCI CTCAE ) version 4.03.  For the purpose of dose 
escalation, any of the following AEs occurring after study drug administration, which are attributable to the study drug, will be considered DLTs: 
Hematologic:  
• Grade 4 neutropenia 
• Grade 3 neutropenic infection  
• Grade 3  thrombocytopenia with bleeding 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia 
Non-Hematologic:

[IP_ADDRESS] DMC Recommendations   
During scheduled meetings, the DMC will review relevant study data for safety or benefit- risk 
concern.  During the MAD part of the study, t he DMC may provide  the following 
recommendation s to the sponsor: 
• Expanding a cohort at a specific dosing level, or repeating a lower dose in a subsequent cohort 
• Continuing a dose level for a given cohort 
• Escalating a dose level  for a subsequent cohort 
• Termination of current or previous cohort(s) 
Further dosing in a given cohort will be halted if [ADDRESS_380836] into the POC Phase 2 part of the 
study.  This POC dose decision will be based on evaluation of the PK, safety (inclusive of dose- limiting toxicity [DLT]), and tolerability data (and available PD/biomarker data) from 
Cohorts 1, 2, and 3; this dose will not exceed doses tested during the MAD portion.  The DMC 
will be reviewing all relevant data from Cohorts 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_380837] dose .  Details are provided in the DMC Charter.   
3.1.2 POC  Phase 2   
[IP_ADDRESS] BOS161721 POC Dose Selection and Justification  
The dose for the POC portion of the study is 120 mg administered SC monthly (a total of 7 doses).  The rationale for the BOS161721-02 Phase 2 POC dose selection was based on cumulative safety, t olerability, immunogenicity, PK , and PD data available from an interim 
analysis (IA) performed during the M AD Phase  1b portion of the trial.  
The data cut -off for this IA occurred on  and included all 6 patients and 
7 doses from Cohort 1 (20 mg), 12 patients and 6  doses from Cohort 2 (60 mg) , and 12 patients 
and 4 doses from Cohort  3 (120 mg).  
The safety analysis focused on incidence and severity of all AEs, SAEs, and pre- determined 
adverse events of special interest  (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  The DMC and designated unblinded 
[LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals team met on  and did not identify any untoward 
safety signa ls at any BOS161721 dose levels.

Confidential   Page 40 of 116 Because there were no safety, tolerability, or immunogenicity trends observed at the time of the 
IA, the Phase 2 POC dose selection was made based on available PK and PD data.  pSTAT3 
levels were assessed as the primary PD biomarker of IL -21R signaling levels.  This is because 
IL-21R signaling, upon IL-21 binding, initially involves phosphorylation of JAK1/JAK3 which 
dissociate from the receptor complex, and phosphorylate STAT3 which translocates to the nucleus and drives IL -21-regulated gene expression.  
 
 
The 120 mg dose  will be communicated to site inv estigators participating in the POC Phase 2 
portion, and to Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and the Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC). 
[IP_ADDRESS] POC Study Design 
For t he POC part of the study, approximately  156 additional patient s will be randomized to 
active or placebo groups in a 2:1  ratio.   
As in the MAD part of the study, e ach patient in the POC portion may receive a total of 7 SC 
monthly doses of study drug on Days 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180.  Assessments will be completed accor ding to the Schedule of Assessments ( Section  3.4).

4.6.1 Corticosteroid  
Prior to randomization, oral CSs (prednisone or prednisone equivalent), may be used in accordance with the investigator’s clinical judgment and best standard of care.  See APPENDIX  3 for examples of equivalents. 
A maximum daily dose of 30 mg/day of oral CS will be acceptable for eligibility for the study, however, the daily dose must be tapered down to a maximum of 10 mg/day for at least 5  days 
prior to Day 0 (randomization day). 
Tapering of steroids during the course of the study will be highly encouraged and should be 
evaluated at the protocol permitted visits (Day  0 through Day 60 and Day 120 through Day 150).  
Between Day  [ADDRESS_380859] be held 
constant  due to the endpoint evaluations occurring at Day 120 and Day 210. 
• Once a patient has received the first dose of study drug (after Day  0), prednisone (or 
prednisone equivalent) dose is highly encouraged to continue tapering down as appropriate.  
The investigator should evaluate the prednisone dose at each visit and make the decision, 
within the protocol allowed windows. 
o Exception:  Between Day 60 and Day  120, and between Day 150 and Day  210 (ie, within 
60 days of primary and secondary endpoint assessments), oral CS doses must be held 
constant.  
After Day  0 (first dose of study drug), a maximum of 1 oral CS “burst” for increased SLE 
disease activity will be allowed  between Day 0 and Day 60, according to the following:   
• The oral CS dose is allowed to increase to  ≤ 40 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent, which 
must be tapered down to ≤ 10 mg/day within 2  weeks of initiation of the “burst”

o No increase of  oral CS above baseline is permitted beyond Day 60 
Treatment with inhalational CS therapy (eg, for asthma), or by [CONTACT_310247], but systemic 
administration, is allowed. 
Treatment with intra -articular or intravenous CS is prohibited during the course of the study. 
4.6.2 Other Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments 
Prohibited and/or restricted medications taken prior to study drug administration and during the 
study are described below, and washout requirements are provided in APPENDIX  4.

At a minimum, patients m ust agree to the use of 1 method of highly effective contraception from 
the following: 
• Male condoms with spermicide 
• Hormonal methods of contraception including combined oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], vaginal 
ring, injectables, implants, and intrauterine devices (IUDs) such as Mirena® by [CONTACT_310248] a male  patient’s WOCBP partner.  Women who are partner of men who are 
patients participating in the study may use hormone- based contraceptives as 1 of the 
acceptable methods of contraception since they w ill not be receiving study drug. 
• IUDs, such as ParaGard® 
• Vasectomy  
• Complete abstinence, defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual intercourse, is an acceptable form of contraception.  Women who are abstinent while participating in the study must continue to have pregnancy tests.  Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective 
contraception must be discussed in the event that the patient chooses to forego complete abstinence.  
Azoospermic men and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually activ e are exempt from 
contraceptive requirements.  However, WOCBP  must still undergo pregnancy testing. 
4.8 Deviation from Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
Deviation from the inclusion or exclusion criteria will not be allowed.  If deviation of inclusion/exclusion cri teria is discovered after randomization, the investigator should contact [CONTACT_310218].  A decision will be made whether to allow a patient to continue or withdrawal from the study medication.

5.5 Prem ature Discontinuation  
While patients are encouraged to complete all study evaluations, they may withdraw from the 
study at any time and for any reason.  Every effort will be made to determine why any patient  
withdraws from the study prematurely.  If the patient is unreachable by [CONTACT_756], a registered 
letter, at the minimum, should be sent to the patient requesting him/her to contact [CONTACT_3652].  
All patients who withdraw from the study with an ongoing AE or SAE must be followed until 
the end of study or until the event is resolved or deemed stable, respectively .   
If a patient  withdraws prematurely after dosing, an end of treatment (EO T) visit should be 
performed (Day 180) and a last follow -up visit 90 days after dosing should be scheduled 
(Day 270).  Safety follow-up visit procedures based on the Schedule of Assessments 
(see Section  5.4). 
Patient  participation may be terminated prior to completing the study and the reason recorded as 
follows: 
• AE/SAE  
• Protocol deviation  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Patient  withdraws consent at their own request  
• Investigator decision 
• Decision by [CONTACT_3211] (other than AE/SAE, protocol deviation, or lost to follow-up) 
Withdrawn patients may be replaced after discussion between the i nvestigator or designee and 
sponsor.

6.2 Safety Assessments  
6.2.1 Laboratory Assessments  
Laboratory tests will be performed at times defined in the Schedule of Assessments (Section  3.4).  Patient  eligibility will be determined based on these tests at screening.  
Unscheduled clinical labs may be obtained at any time during the study to assess any perceived safety concerns.  
A central laboratory will be used  (with the exception of urine pregnancy tests) to ensure accuracy 
and consistency in test results.  Laboratory/analyte results that could unblind the study (ie, biomarker results) will not be reported to investigative sites.   Urinalysis will be performed on 
midstream, clean catch specimens.   Some biomarkers listed above will not be drawn at some 
sites due to geographical logistical challenges.  See the laboratory manual for details. 
Endpoint analyses will be based on changes from baseline assessments at Days 120 and 210.

QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In -Tube (QFT- G) is an in vitro  diagnostic test using a peptide cocktail 
simulating ESAT -6, CFP-10, and TB 7.7 proteins to stimulate cells in heparinized whole blood.  
Detection of INFγ performed by [CONTACT_28745]-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is used to identify in vitro  responses to these peptide antigens that are asso ciated with Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis infection.  QFT -G is  an indirect test for M. tuberculosis infection (including disease) 
and is intended for use in conjunction with risk assessment, radiography and other medical and diagnostic evaluations. 
Test resul ts will be reported as positive, negative, or indeterminate.  A negative QFT- G test 
result is required to meet the inclusion criterion.  In the case of an indeterminate result, repeat 
tests should be permitted for the purpose of determining eligibility of patients to enroll in this 
study.  If a repeat test is indeterminate again, the patient is a screen failure.  The procedure for

will be provided to investi gators.  
6.2.2 Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence experienced by a study patient, whether 
or not considered drug related by [CONTACT_2026] i nvestigator.    
AEs are unfavorable changes in a general condition, subject ive or  objective signs or symptoms, 
worsening of pre- existing concomitant disease, and clinically significant abnormality  in 
laboratory parameters observed in a patient  in the course of a clinical study.   
Non-serious SLE manifestations or abnormal laboratory results  related to SLE  disease activity  
would not be recorded as AEs unless they meet the definition for SAEs ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Recording of Adverse Events 
AEs should be collected and recorded for each patient  from the date of the first dose of study 
drug until the end of their participation in the study, including the safety follow up period.   
AEs may be volunteered spontaneously by [CONTACT_4694] , or discovered by [CONTACT_14543], nonleading question such as ‘How have you 
been feeling since you were last asked?’  All AEs and any required remedial action will be recorded  on the Adverse Events e CRF  and Safety Adverse Event Form.  The details of the AE, 
date of AE onset, date of AE outcome, and action taken for  the AE will be documented together 
with the principal investigator’s assessment of the seriousness of the AE and causal relationship 
to the study drug and/or the study procedure. 
All AEs should be recorded individually, using diagnostic terms where possible.   If the diagnosis 
is not established,  individual symptom s may be reported .  The AEs will subsequently be coded 
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).    
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity of Adverse Events  
Each AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_310112] n Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 4.03 criteria.
 41  
When changes in the severity (grade) of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the event should be noted for that day.  Any change in severity of signs and symptoms over a number of days will be captured by [CONTACT_44745] a new AE, with the amended severity grade and the date (and time, if known) of the change. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Causality  of Adverse Events  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310084]161721 or placebo and 
the AE.  One of the following categories ( Table 4) should be selected based on medical 
judgment, considering the definitions below and all contributing factors.

relationship to treatment administration and which concurrent disease or other 
drugs or chemicals cannot explain.  The response to withdrawal of the treatment (dechallenge
a) should be clinically plausible.  The event must be definitive 
pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory rechallengeb 
procedure if necessary.  
Unrelated  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no temporal 
relationship with treatment administration.  May have negative dechallenge and 
rechallenge information.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_261969] (eg, concomitant disease, environmental factors, or other drugs or chemicals).  
a Dechallenge:  Upon discontinuation of a dr ug suspected of causing an AE, the symptoms of the AE disappear 
partially or completely, within a reasonable  time from drug discontinuation  (positive dechallenge), or the 
symptoms continue despi[INVESTIGATOR_211386] (negative dechallenge).  Note that t here are exceptions 
when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet drug relatedness clearly exists (for 
example, as in bone marrow suppression, fixed drug eruptions, or tardive dyskinesia).  
b Rechallenge:   Upon re -administration of a drug suspected of causing an AE in a specific patient in the past, 
the AE recurs upon exposure (positive rechallenge), or the AE does not recur  (negative rechallenge).  
An unexpected adverse drug event is any adverse drug event for which the specificity or severity is not consistent with the current IP. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Seriousness  of Adverse Events 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening; this means that the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it 
does not mean that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe 
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_211384] 
• Results in persistent or significant incapaci ty or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is other important medical event (see below)  
Important medical events that do not result in death, are not life threatening, or do not require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.   Examples of such events are:  
• Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm 
• Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• Development of drug dependency or drug abuse

(eg, elective surgery for a pre-existing condition that has not worsened) need not be considered SAEs.  If anything untoward is reported during the procedure, that occurrence must be reported 
as an AE, eith er 'serious' or 'nonserious' according to the usual criteria.  
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are AEs that are associated with the use of the drug and are serious and unexpected.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events of Special Interest  
AEs of special i nterest in this study include the following : 
1. Anaphylaxis and serious allergic reactions  
2. Grade s 2 to 5 injection site reaction, including erythema, pain, and induration 
(See APPENDIX 6) 
3. Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) assessed following Hy’s L aw 
4. Malignancy  (not including basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of skin) 
5. Opportunistic infections such as disseminated histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, disseminated 
herpes simplex, disseminated tuberculosis, Aspergillus  sp., Candida albicans , Coccidioides 
immitis , Cryptococcus neoformans , Cytomegalovirus , Histoplasma capsulatum , Isospora 
belli, and Polyomavirus JC polyomavirus  
6. Cryptosporidiasis 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Anaphylaxis and Serious Allergic Reactions  
Anaphylaxis will be defined according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (NIAID/FAAN) criteria.
42  In the event of 
anaphylactic reaction or severe/serious hypersensitivity/allergic reaction, the patient must 
discontinue IP and emergency resuscitation measures implemented.  In case of other mild to moderate hypersensitivity reaction, depending on the severity, the investigator may manage in accordance with the standard -of-care.  
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria is fulfilled: 
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal 
tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus, or flushing, swollen lips-tongue- uvula) and at 
least 1 of the following: 
a. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] [PEF], hypoxemia) 
b. Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours):

d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting) 
3. Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): 
a. Systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from the 
patient’s baseline  
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Injection Site Reactions 
Injection site reactions are to be captured and reported as AEs.  These will include Grades  2 to 5 
injection site erythema, pain, and induration (see APPENDIX  6), which are also captured as 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (See Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  The investigator should provide a clear 
description of the observed or reported AE including location and severity.  All concomitant treatments used to treat injection site reactions should be recorded and captured in the eCRF, 
together with the AE of injection site reactions.   
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_380880] and/or ALT levels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of DILI, and as potential Hy’s Law cases, and should always be considered important medical events.   If symptoms compatible with DILI precede knowledge of 
serum chemical test abnormalities, liver enzyme measurements should be made immediately, regardless of when the next visit or monitoring interval is scheduled.  In some cases, symptoms may be an early sign of injury and although typi[INVESTIGATOR_310038], they may indicate a need for prompt serum testing.  An increase in liver enzymes should be confirmed by a repeated test within [ADDRESS_380881] be reported as SAEs (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 for reporting details).  
Potential DILI is defined as:  
1. ALT or AST elevation > 3 × ULN 
AND 
2. Total bilirubin > 2 × ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase) 
AND 
BOS161721 [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Protocol Date and Version:  23 January  2019; V 5.[ADDRESS_380882] elevation and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre- existing chronic or acute 
liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic 
The patient  should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, include 
laboratory tests, detailed history , and physical assessment.  In addition to repeating 
measurements of AST and ALT, laboratory tests should include albumin, CK, total bilirubin, 
direct and indirect bilirubin, GGT , prothrombin time (PT)/International Normalized Ratio (INR), 
and alkaline phosphatase.  A detailed history, including relevant information, such as review of 
ethanol, acetaminophen, recreational drug and supple ment consumption, family history, 
occupational exposure, sexual history, travel history, history of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary 
tract) may be warranted.  All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria 
defined above, with no other cause for liver function test (LFT) abnormalities identi fied at the 
time should be considered potential Hy’s Law cases irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the abnormal LFTs.  Such potential Hy’s Law cases should be reported as SAEs.  
Study drug discontinuation is considered if there is marked serum AST or ALT elevation or evidence of functional impairment  (as indicated by [CONTACT_310177], which represent 
substantial liver injury ) that is related to study drug.
  Discontinuation of treatment should be 
considered if: 
• ALT or AST > 8 × ULN  
• ALT or AST > 5× ULN for more than [ADDRESS_380883] occur if:   
• ALT or AST >3 × ULN and (total bilirubin  > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5) 
• ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (> 5%) 
[IP_ADDRESS].4 Malignancy 
The identification of a malignancy event will be made by [CONTACT_310221].  AEs should be reported as se rious per the criteria in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
After the first dose of study drug, when there is a decision to biopsy a potentially malignant tumor, lymph node, or other tissue (with the exception of suspected basal cell/squamous cell) , 
the investigator and/or consultant(s) should contact [CONTACT_310222].   Basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell 
carcinoma of skin is not considered an AE of special interest.

the study.  If a patient develops diarrhea during the study a stool sample must be provided to test for ova, parasites, and cryptosporidium.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of Adverse Ev ents 
AE reporting  will be carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations, including 
regulatory agency and IRB reporting requirements.    
Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for an SAE.  If an SAE occurs, 
expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate, and is further outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS].2. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Reporting of Pregnancy  
As information is available, a pregnancy diagnosed during the study will be reported within 
24 hours to the sponsor via the Pregnancy Notification and Outcome Form, including pregnancy 
in female patients who received study drug and female partners of male study patients who 
received study drug.  The pregnancy should be followed to term and/or outcome and this outcome should also be reported to the sponsor via the Pregnancy Notification and Outcome 
Form .  Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE or SAE unless there is complication.  
In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by [CONTACT_4692] (unless pre -procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and 
the findings are reported). 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an  AE or  SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a live 
born, a terminated fetus, a n intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator 
should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs. 
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows: 
• Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion  
• Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_380885] to 
causality, as SAEs.  In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as serious

immediately, irrespective of the  extent of available AE information.  This timeframe also applies 
to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAE reports as well as to the initial and follow -up reporting of exposure during pregnancy and exposure via breastfeeding 
cases.  In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE immediately (eg, if an outpatient study patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the AE.  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310086].  All SAEs will be recorded from the time of first dose 
of study drug through the safety follow -up period (up to Day 270).  SAEs  occurring after the

As a minimum requirement, the initial notification should provide the following information: 
• Study number 
• Patient  number 
• Details of the SAE  (verbatim details are sufficient for immediate notification) 
• Criterion for classification as ‘serious’ 
• Causality assessment ( which may be updated in a follow-up report when sufficient 
information is available to make this classification) 
Initial reports of SAEs must be followed later with detailed descriptions, including clear 
photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_211387] (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73529], consultant reports, autopsy reports, etc), with the study patient ’s personal identifiers removed.  All relevant information 
obtained by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_310113] l be recorded and

becoming aware of the event and recorded as such on the Adverse Events eCRF and Safety 
Adverse Event Form. 
Potential DILI will be reported based on specifications mentioned in Section [IP_ADDRESS].3.   
Each AE of special interest is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for an SAE.  If 
an SAE occurs, expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate, and is further outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS].2. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Follow Up of Adverse Events 
All AEs will be followed up through the safety follow-up visits.  All SAEs experienced by a 
patient, irrespective of the suspected causality, will be monitored until the event has resolved , 
until any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline or stabilize d at a level acceptable 
to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310042] m onitor, until there is a satisfactory explanation for the 
changes observed, or until the patient is lost to follow-up.   
See Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 for details related to follow -up of pregnancy.  See Section  [IP_ADDRESS].3 for 
details related to follow -up of potential DILI.  See  Section  [IP_ADDRESS].4 for details related to 
follow-up of malignancy. 6.2.3 Vital Signs  
Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate , and body temperature) will be assessed as specified in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Sectio n 3.4 ).  Vital signs will be assessed on Day  0 at predose and at 
Day 0, 1 and 2 hours postdose, as well as on each of the scheduled visit days during the study 
(excluding PK- only site visits) .  Supi[INVESTIGATOR_310089]  ≥ 5 minutes.  When the timing of these measurements 
coincides with a blood collection, vital signs should be obtained prior to the time of the blood 
collection.  
6.2.4 12-Lead Electrocardiograms  
ECG will be assessed as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 3.4).  ECG recording 
will initiate after the patient  has been supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] [ADDRESS_380890] leads and a Lead II rhythm strip on the bottom of the 
tracing.  The ECG will be recorded at a paper speed of 25 mm/sec ond.  The following ECG

The targeted (limited) physical examination will be completed at all other visits as indicated in 
the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 3.4) .  It includes evaluation of pa tient complaints and SLE 
disease -related issues, and will exclude the genitourinary system. 
6.2.6 C-SSRS  
The C- SSRS is a low -burden measure of the spectrum of suicidal ideation and behavior that was 
developed by [CONTACT_310249] I nstitute of Mental Health 
Treatment of Adolescent Suicide Attempters Study to assess severity and track suicidal events through any treatment.  It is a clinical interview providing a summary of both ideation and behavior that can be administered during any evaluation or risk assessment to identify the level and type of suicidality present.  The C-SSRS can also be used during treatment to monitor for clinical worsening.
43 
The C -SSRS evaluation will be performed as specified in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Section 3.4).  Pa tients with recent (within the past 12 months) or active suicidal ideation or 
behavior based on patient responding “yes” to question 3, 4, or [ADDRESS_380893] responses to the C- SSRS reviewed in detail to assess patient 
risk, and appropriate co nsultative mental health services will be provided.  
6.2.7 Injection Site Reactions 
Patients will be monitored for local injection site reactions  as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Section 3.4 ).  Local injection site reactions will be assessed at [ADDRESS_380894]  (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS].3) . 
6.2.8 Immunogenicity  
The serum samples to measure the presence of ADA will be collected as specified in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Section 3.4 ).  Blood samples (4 mL) to provide approximately 1.5 mL 
of plasma for anti BOS161721 antibody analysis will be collected into appropriately labeled tubes containing K
2EDTA.  The presence or absence of ADA will be determined in the serum 
samples using validated bioanalytical methods.  Blood samples for ADA analysis will be

from this patient will be further analyzed in the neutralizing antibody (nAb) a ssay by a central 
lab. 
6.3 Efficacy Assessments  
All efficacy assessments will be performed at times defined in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Section  3.4). 
6.3.1 SLEDAI -2K 
The SLEDAI -2K is a validated instrument that measures disease activity in SLE patients at the 
time of the visit and in the previous 30 days.  It is a global index and includes 24 clinical and 
laboratory variables that are weighted by [CONTACT_310181], but not by [CONTACT_926].  The total score falls between 0 and 105, with higher scores representing increased disease activity.  The SLEDAI -2K has been shown to be a valid and reliable disease activity measure in multiple 
patient  groups.  A SLEDAI -2K of 6 or more generally represents moderately to severely active 
disease.
44 
6.3.2 BILAG  2004 
The BILAG -2004 index is an organ- specific 97-question assessm ent based on the principle of 
the doctor’s intent to treat.  Only clinical features attributable to SLE disease activity are to be recorded and based on the patient’s condition in the last 4 weeks compared with the previous 4 weeks.  It will be scored as n ot present (0), improved (1), the same (2), worse (3), or new 
(4).  Disease activity is graded separately for 9 body systems to 5 different grades (A to E) as follows: A (“Active”)  is very active disease, B  (“Beware”)  is moderate activity, C 
(“Contentment” ) is mild stable disease, D (“Discount”) is inactive now but previously active, and 
E (“Excluded”) indicates the organ was never involved.
[ADDRESS_380896] maintain documentation with descriptive details supporti ng the BILAG-2004 scoring (eg, chart, 
worksheet, clinic notes, and labs) at each visit. 
See APPENDIX  5 for detailed specifications. 
6.3.3 PGA of Disease Activity  
The PGA is used to assess investigator’s general impression on the patient’s overall status of 
SLE disease activity  via visual analogue scale (10 0 mm) with 0 being “very good, asymptomatic 
BOS161721 [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Confidential   Page 78 of 116 and no limitation of normal activities” with 100 mm being “most severe possible disease ever 
seen in all SLE patients”.   PGA worsening is defined as an increase of > 30 mm  from baseline.  
When scoring the PGA, the assessor should always look back at the score from the previous 
visit.  
6.3.4 Composite Endpoints :  SRI -4, SRI-5, SRI -6, and BICLA Response  
[IP_ADDRESS] SRI-4 Response 
The SRI -4 is a composite index of SLE disease improvement that consists of scores derived from 
the SLEDAI -2K and the BILAG 2004 Index.  Response based on the SRI-4 is defined by:  
1) ≥ 4- point reduction in SLEDAI -2K global score, 2) no new severe disease activity (BILAG  A 
organ score) or more than 1 new moderate organ score (BILAG B), and 3) no deterioration from baseline in the PGA by ≥ [ADDRESS_380897] improve ments in clinical and patient-reported outcomes.
45  
[IP_ADDRESS] SRI-5 and SRI -6 Response  
Like the SRI -4, the SRI-5 and SRI-6 are composite indices of SLE disease improvement that 
consists of scores derived from the SLEDAI -2K and the BILAG 2004 Index.  However, the 
SRI-5 and SRI-6 are computed with a minimal five-point or six-point improvement in 
SLEDAI -2K being required, respectively.46 
[IP_ADDRESS] BICLA Response 
The BICLA is a responder index developed to measure response to therapy, and it includes 
scores from the BILAG, SLEDAI -2K, and PGA.  BICLA response is defined as 1) at least 
1 gradation of improvement in baseline BILAG 2004 scores in all body systems with moderate disease activity at entry (eg, all B [moderate disease] scores falling to C [mild], or D [no 
activity ]); 2) no new BILAG A or more than 1 new BILAG B scores; 3) no worsening of total 
SLEDAI -2K score from baseline; 4) ≤ 10% deterioration in PGA score  and 5) no treatment 
failure .
44  It is driven primarily by [CONTACT_310182], and has been used in Phase 2 and 3 mAb 
studies.47 
For the endpoints of BICLA respons e at Days 210, 240, and 270, patient scores will be 
completed and response determined. 
6.3.5  CLASI Response  
The CLASI is a comprehensive tool for assessment of disease activity and damage in cutaneous 
lupus, shown to be valid, reliable, and sensitive to changes in disease activity. 48  Response is 
defined as 50% improvement from baseline in “A” or “B” scores.  This assessment will be applied to all patients as all are required to have cutaneous disease activity . 
For the secondary efficacy endpoint of CLASI response at Day 210, patient scores on MAD and 
POC studies will be compared with baseline for  50% improvement.

FAS analyses will be conducted on the basis of the randomized treatment.  
A per protocol (PP) analysis set may be defined to exclude major protocol violations from the 
efficacy analysis.  The PP Population will include all patients from the FAS except those with 
major violations to the protocol deemed to impact the analysis of the primary endpoint.  These 
violations will be identified based on blinded data prior to study unblinding.  PP analyses will be conducted on the basis of the randomized treatment. 
Safety analyses will be based on the safety analysis set (SS) , defined as all patients who receive 
at least 1  dose of study treatment.  Safety analyses will be conducted on the basis of actual 
treatment received .  
Pharmacokinetic analysis will be conducted on the PK analysis set, defined as the FAS with 
sufficient concentration data for the calculation of PK parameters.    
8.2.2 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Baseline and patient characteristics will be summarized  using all randomized patients .   
8.2.3 Primary  Efficacy  Endpoint(s)  
The proportion of patients who achieve a SRI -4 response at Day 210 will be assessed  via 
Pearson’s chi -squared analysis.  The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using the FAS 
and if needed repeated in  the PP analysis set.   Missing values will be addressed by [CONTACT_18120] a 
last observation carried forward (LOCF) analysis .  Other imputation methods may be employed 
as a sensitivity analysis and will be described in  the SAP.   Additional analyses exploring impact 
of baseline factors such as baseline disease severity, race, and other characteristics may be 
performed.  
Patients  that received prohibited medications or unallowable CS usage as described in 
Section  4.6 will be considered “medication failures” and will be treated as non -responders for the

blinded data and finalized prior to unblinding.   
The superiority of BOS161721 relative to placebo will be evaluated.  If the proportion of SRI-4 
responders for the selected POC dose in BOS161721 arm is higher than that of the placebo arm, then BOS161721 will be considered superior to placebo if the 2-sided p-value is less than 0.10.  Secondary and exploratory endpoints for this POC portion will be evaluated based on the same statistical hypothesis.  
8.2.4 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s)  
Binary efficacy endpoints will be assessed via Pearson’s chi -squared analysis.  Continuous 
efficacy endpoints will be assessed via analysis of variance (ANOVA) or analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) and treatment will be compared using the F -test.  Repeated measures mixed models 
may be performed to evaluate data collected at each visit and overall.  Time -to-event endpoints 
will be assessed via Kaplan -Meier methodology and treatment will be compared using the log-
rank test.  The secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed on the FAS and if needed re peated 
in the PP analysis set.  Details including handling of missing data and “medication failures” will be available in the SAP.  
8.2.5 Analysis of Safety

Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- 02 
Protocol Date and Version:  23 January  2019; V 5.[ADDRESS_380923] the health of the people.  T he physician’s 
knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty. 
The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association binds the physician with the 
words, "The health of my subject will be my first consideration," and the Interna tional Code of 
Medical Ethics declares that, "A physician shall act only in the subject's interest when providing medical care which might have the effect of weakening the physical and mental condition of the subject." 
Medical progress is based on research , which ultimately must rest in part on experimentation 
involving human subjects. In medical research on human subjects, considerations related to the well -being of the human 
subject should take precedence over the interests of science and society.  
The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to improve prophylactic, 
diagnostic, and therapeutic procedures and the understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of disease.  Even the best -proven prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods must 
continuously be challenged through research for their effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility,  and 
quality.

Protocol Date and Version:  23 January  2019; V 5.[ADDRESS_380924] involving human subjects should be preceded by [CONTACT_310253]161721 [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- 02 
Protocol Date and Version:  23 January  2019; V 5.[ADDRESS_380925]’s in formation and to minimize the impact of the study on the subject's physical and 
mental integrity and on the personality of the subject. 
In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the 
aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of 
the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail.  The subject should be informed of the right to abstain from participatio n in the study or to 
withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal.  After ensuring that the subject has understood the information, the physician should then obtain the subject's freely-given informed consent, preferably in writing.  If the consent cannot be obtained in writing, the non- written 
consent must be formally documented and witnessed. 
When obtaining informed consent for the research project the physician should be particularly 
cautious if the subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under 
duress.  In that case the informed consent should be obtained by a well-informed physician who 
is not engaged in the investigation and who is completely independent of this relationship. 
For a research subject who is legally incompetent, physically or mentally incapable of giving 
consent or is a legally incompetent minor, the investigator must obtain informed consent from the legally authorized representative in accordance with applicable law.  These groups should not be included in research unless the research is necessary to promote the health of the population represented and this research cannot instead be performed on legally competent persons.  
When a subject deemed legally incompetent, such as a minor child, is able to give assent to decisions about participation in research, the investigator must obtain that assent in addition to the consent of the legally authorized representative.  
Research on individuals from whom it is not possible to obtain consent, including proxy or advance consent, should be done only if the physical/mental condition that prevents obtaining

Where possible, these measures should be made the object of research, designed to evaluate their safety and efficacy.  In all cases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, published.  The other relevant guidelines of this Declaration should be followed.

Statistical Considerations , 
Paragraph 2  Add: 
Two analyses are planned:  1) an interim analysis to select the POC  
dose based on the MAD data, and 2) a final analysis at study 
completion.  Additionally, DMC safety analyses will be performed for 
each MAD cohort and throughout the POC to monitor patient safety as 
described in the DMC charter.   An additional analysis may be 
performed for the MAD portion of the study when all MAD 
patients have completed the safety follow -up, or withdrawn from 
the study , and prior to the final analysis.  Data from the POC part 
of the study will be excluded from this additional analysis.   Protocol

With:  
[IP_ADDRESS]  BOS161721 POC  Dose Selection and Justification  
The dose for the POC portion of the study is 120  mg administered 
SC monthly (a total of 7  doses).  The rationale for the 
BOS161721 -02 Phase  2 POC dose selection was based on 
cumulative safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, PK, and PD data 
available from an interim analysis (IA) performed during the MAD Phase 1b portion  of the trial.  
The data cut -off for this IA occurred on  and 
included all 6  patients and 7  doses from Cohort  1 (20  mg), 
12 patients and 6  doses from Cohort  2 (60  mg), and 12 patients and 
4 doses from Cohort  3 (120  mg). 
The safety analysis focused on incidence and severity of all AEs, 
SAEs, and pre -determined adverse events of special interest  (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) .  The DMC and designated unblinded [LOCATION_011] 
Pharmaceuticals team met on  and did not 
identify any untoward safety signals at any BOS161721 dose level s. 
Because there were no safety, tolerability, or immunogenicity 
trends observed at the time of the IA , the Phase  2 POC dose 
selection was made based on available PK and PD data.  pSTAT3 levels were assessed as the primary PD biomarker of IL -21R 
signaling levels.  This is because IL- 21R signaling, upon IL -21 
binding, initially involves phosphorylation of J AK1/JAK3 which 
dissociate from the receptor complex, and phosphorylate STAT3 which translocates to the nucleus and drives IL- 21-regulated gene 
expression.   
 
 
The 120  mg dose will be communicated  to site investigators 
participating in the POC Phase  2 portion, and to Institutional 
Review Boards ( IRBs ) and the Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC).

Title:  A Randomized Double -Blind Phase  1b/2 Combined Staggered Multiple 
Dose Escala tion Study of BOS161721 in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus 
(SLE)  Patients on a Background of Limited Standard of Care 
Indication  Adults with moderately to severely active SLE  
Background 
and Rationale SLE is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease with considerable 
heterogeneity in clinical manifestations and disease course.  There is 
evidence that B - and T- cells are critical to the development of the disease, 
and that T- cell-derived cytokines such as interl eukin -21 (IL- 21) are involved 
in the SLE- associated inflammatory pathological response.    
BOS161721 is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) triple mutation monoclonal antibody (mAb) intended to have an extended terminal 
elimination half- life (t
1/2) that se lectively binds to and neutralizes IL -21, 
which acts on multiple cell types that drive  inflammation and autoimmunity.  
In vivo, BOS161721 inhibits T- cell dependent antigen responses of B -cells 
and is being developed as a potential  treatment for adult s with  moderately to 
severely active SLE.    
No
nclinical studies have evaluated  the toxi city, pharmacodynamics (PD), 
toxicokinetics (TK), pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of BOS161721 administered intravenously (IV) and subcutaneously (SC).  The no obser ved adverse effect level (NOAEL) in Cynomolgus monkeys w as 
determined to be 100 mg/kg (SC and IV) , the highest dose tested.  There 
were no injection site reactions in animals dosed subcutaneously. 
In a Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) study, BOS161721 was 
administered IV and SC to healthy male and female adult subjects.  This 
double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated 8 ascending dose levels (1 [IV], 3 [SC], 10 [SC], 22 [IV], 30 [SC], 60 [SC], 120 [SC], or 
240 [SC] mg) for safety, tolerability, PK, PD and immunogenicity.  Overall, 
there were no clinically significant safety or tolerability findings from this study.  
Results from the Phase 1 SAD study informed the dose regimens used for the 
multiple ascending doses (MAD) Phase 1b  portion of this trial .  The MAD 
portion will involve  3 cohorts.  The Phase 2 portion will be a proof of 
concept (POC) part, where dose selection will be based on the data 
monitoring c ommittee (DMC) and sponsor ’s assessment of safety, 
tolerability, immunogenicity, and PK and PD data from the MAD portion  of 
30 patien ts treated with BOS161721/placebo.  The purpose of the study is to 
establish a safe and effective dosage for adult patients with moderately to 
severe ly active SLE.

Study Design:  This is a Phase 1b/[ADDRESS_380962] of 
2 double-blinded portions :  MAD Phase [ADDRESS_380963] of 3 cohorts, with 
Cohort 1 containing 6 patient s, where 5 of these patients will receive 
BOS161721 (active), and 1 will receive placebo.  Cohorts 2 and 3 will each contain 12 patient s, including 9 active and 3 placebo patient s.  Dose selection 
for each cohort is based on 90-day safety, tolerability, PK, and PD  data 
review from the Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01) in healthy subjects .  
Each of the 3 doses (20, 60, and 120 mg) selected for the MAD portion are projected not to exceed the mean exposure of that achieved in the SAD  study 
following the single  240 mg SC dose.  Each patient  may receive a total of

A maximum daily dose of 30 mg/day of oral CS will be acceptable for 
eligibility for the study, however, daily dose must be tapered down to a 
maximum of 10  mg/day for at least 5  days prior to Day 0 (randomization 
day).  One  oral CS “burst ” for increased SLE disease activity may occur  
during the study between Day 0  and Day 60.  Tapering of steroids during the 
course of the study will be encouraged and should be evaluated at all visits.  
Tapering may occur  after randomization except within 60 days  of the primary

1.1 Indication  
BOS161721 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb), which binds to and inhibits 
interleukin -21 (IL-21) bioactivity, and is being develope d for the treatment of moderately to 
severely active systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) in adults.  
1.2 Background  and Rationale  
1.2.1 Overview of the Disease State  
SLE is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that has variable manifestations in multiple 
organ systems and follows a relapsing and remitting course .  The disease process includes 
abnormal immune responses mediated by [CONTACT_59627]-binding autoantibodies and immune complex 
deposition, giving rise to tissue damage often resulting in end organ disease and even mortality.  Survival of SLE has improved due to earlier detection , improved overall medical care, and 
standardized  SLE treatment with corticosteroi ds (CS) , immunosuppressants, and cytotoxic 
agents.
[ADDRESS_380984] common cause of death during later disease .
2   
The reported prevalence of SLE in the [LOCATION_002] (US) is 20 to 70 cases per 100,000 people.3  
More than 90% of cases of SLE occur in women, frequently starting at chil dbearing age.  
Women of color  are disproportionately affected by [CONTACT_113919].  This suggests multiple genetic and 
environmental factors are at play.  Accordingly, a multifactorial view of the immunopathogenesis of SLE suggests more than [ADDRESS_380985], including breach in central 
tolerance in the adaptive arm of the immune system, peripheral amplification of the autoimmune response by [CONTACT_310147], and local processes in the target organ that facilitate end-organ disease.

1.2.2 B
OS161721 Development  
[LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals is developi[INVESTIGATOR_310031]161721 for the treatment of SLE.  BOS161721 is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1)  mAb with extended half -life directed against 
human  IL-21.   
Murine mAb 19E3, the progenitor of BOS161721, was generated using mouse hybridoma technology.  19E3 has subpi[INVESTIGATOR_36379] (pM) affinity to human IL- 21 and was selected for its potent 
neutralization of IL -21 bioactivity.  BOS161721 was generated by [CONTACT_310148] 
19E3 where its complementarity-determining regions were grafted onto a human IgG1 kappa backbone.  The fragment crystallizable (Fc) portion of BOS161721 contains a YTE (M252Y/S254T/T256E triple mutation) in the constant domain of the IgG1 heavy chain that was introduced into the parental molecule, 19E3, intended to prolong the in vivo terminal elimination half- life ( t
1/2) of the mAb.5  Thus, BOS161721 retains sub- pM binding to IL-21 and prevents 
IL-21 from binding to the IL-21 receptor (IL-21R), inhibiting IL-21 bioactivity.

Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- 02 
Protocol Date and Version:  27 July 2018 ; V4.0 
Confidential   Page 25 of 118 BOS161721 binds to human IL -21 and Cynomolgus monkey IL -21, which are highly 
homologous , and neutralizes the bioactivity of both.  BOS161721 is specific for IL -21 as it does 
not bind to or inhibit the other gamma -chain (γc) family  of cytokines , and acts to specifically 
neutralize th e IL-[ADDRESS_380986].  In in vitro  studies, BOS161721 inhibited downstream IL -21-
induced signaling, IL -21-induced plasma cell differentiation, and IL -21-induced natural killer 
(NK) cell activation.  In in vivo  studies, BOS161721 significantly inhibited the T -cell dependent 
antibody response (TDAR) to immunization with a protein antigen as well as B -cell expansion 
following a second protein antigen immunization in Cynomolgus monkeys.    
[IP_ADDRESS] Interleukin -[ADDRESS_380987] cytokines in this family are critically important for both 
the maintenance and function of T -cell and B -cell responses.  IL -21 signals through a receptor 
complex consisting of its own private receptor, the IL -21R and γc.6,7  Engagement of the 
IL-21R/γc complex leads to the activation of several signaling pathways, including the Janus 
kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription, mitogen- activated protein kinase (MAPK)  
and phosphoinositide [ADDRESS_380988] array of cell types, including B -cells, T -cells, NK -cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, 
as well as other hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells such as fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and 
intestinal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663].9,11  Activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 
(STAT3 ) via phosphorylation is critical  in regulating human B -cell responses to IL -2112; 
phosphorylated STAT3  (pSTAT3) forms a homodimer, which translocates to the nucleus where 
it initiates transcription of the IL -21 gene , forming an autocr ine loop for IL -21 production via 
STAT3 phosphorylation.13  In addition, IL -21 has been shown to upregulate expression of its 
own receptor14 and induces an autocrine feedback loop.15 
IL-21 modulates various aspects of immune  function.  It  promotes cluster of differentiation 4 
(CD4+ ) T-cell differentiation and promotes the generation of T -helper (Th)1716 and T -follicular 
helper (Tfh) cells.15,17  In mice, IL -21 has been shown to regulate the balance between Th17 and 
regulatory T -cell (Treg), in that it increases Th17, while inhibiting Treg differentiation.[ADDRESS_380989] disease induced by [CONTACT_74934] T -cells.20  IL-21 upregulates CD8+ 
T-cell and NK -cell expansion and cytolytic activity by [CONTACT_310149] B and perforin.21,22  
IL-21 also has been reported to increase granzyme B in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B -cells 
resulting in inhibition of T -cell responses.23,24  IL-21 also has a variety of effects on 
nonhematopoietic cells, such as stromal cells and induces inflammation through matrix 
metalloproteinase release by [CONTACT_310207].25 
One principal non- redundant role of IL -21 is the promotion of B -cell activation, dif ferentiation , 
or death during humoral immune responses.14  Furthermore, increased IL -21 production is 
characteristic of several autoimmune diseases and is likely to contribute to autoantibody 
production as well as pathologic features of autoimmune disease. 26  The critical role of IL -21 in 
promoting humoral and other immune responses makes it an important focus of potential

driving the autoantibody production through its role in plasma cell differentiation.  Importantly, Tfh cell populations are expanded in patient s with autoimmune diseases such as lupus, bullous 
pemphigoid, rheumatoid arthritis (RA)  and primary Sjögren’s syndrome ( pSS) an d have been 
reported to correlate with IL -[ADDRESS_380990] elevated IL -21 
plasma levels that correlate with the severity of the disease.  Recently, genome- wide association 
studies (GWAS) have provided convincing evidence that the chromosomal 4q 27 region harbors 
the IL -21 genes and is associated with chronic inflammatory disorders, including SLE.29   
[IP_ADDRESS] Preclinical Studies 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of BOS161721 were characterized following single- dose intravenous 
(IV) administration of BOS161721 (0.01 to 30 mg/kg) in male Cynomolgus monkeys or repeat, every 2 weeks IV administration (15 to 100 mg/kg) and subcutaneous (SC) administration (50 mg/kg) in male and female Cynomolgus monkeys.  Systemic exposure was approximately dose-proportional within the tested dose range.  SC bioavailability was determined to be 64.3%.  
 
 
Two single-dose (IV) non-good laboratory practice (GLP) studies conducted in Cynomolgus 
monkeys evaluated the toxicity, pharmacodynamics (PD), toxicokinetics (TK), and 
immunogenicity of BOS161721.  Following a single IV administration (slow bolus), there were no BOS161721- related adverse changes, resulting in a no -observed -adverse- effect -level 
(NOAEL) value of 30  mg/kg, the highest dose tested among 2 studies.  
 
In a repeat -dose GLP toxicology study in Cynomolgus monkeys, BOS161721 was administered 
every 2 weeks by [CONTACT_310152] (50 mg/kg) administration for 3 months (a total of 7  doses).

ical Studies  
BOS161721-01 was a double-blind, Phase 1, single ascending dose (SAD) study to assess the safety, PK , and PD of BOS161721 in healthy subjects.  The primary objective of the study was 
to characterize the safety and tolerability of IV and SC SADs  of BOS161721 in an otherwise 
healthy subject population without concomitant illnesses, immune abnormalities, or concomitant 
medications.  Secondary objectives include d characterization of the PK and immunogenicity of 
BOS161721, and exploratory objectives included the evaluation of the effect of BOS161721 on TDAR to keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( KLH) (primary and secondary immunizations) in healthy

(SDMT).   
Blood samples were collected at every in -house study visit for BOS161721 concentration 
determinations.  Blood samples were also collected for determination of IL -21 plasma l evels 
(free and total).  Safety was assessed based on the occurrence of treatment -emergent AEs, 
hepatic function abnormality, and acute and delayed hypersensitivity reactions.  Other safety 
variables include d ECGs, vital signs (blood pressure  [BP], heart r ate, and temperature), safety 
laboratory assessments, blood sampling for ADA s, total IgG and immunoglobulin M ( IgM) 
levels,  CD4+ count , and full and targeted physical examinations.  Overall, there were no 
clinically significant findings from this study .  Adverse event s reported as related to the study 
drug, particularly infections, were expected for the compound, and there were no clinically 
relevant changes in laboratory  and ECG  results or vital signs.  There was 1 serious adverse event 
(SAE ; death  due to pulmonary embolism ) that occurred 127 days after a single administration of 
240 mg SC dose of BOS161721.  The causality of this single SAE was not attributed to study 
drug and further information can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.  PK data from t he SAD 
study demonstrates BOS161721 has an extended t 1/2 (provisional single dose data indicates this 
to be approximately 42- 46 days)  which supports evaluation of monthly dosing.

(8 cohorts, evaluating 1 [IV], 3 [SC], 10 [SC], 22 [IV], 30 [SC], 60 [SC], 120 [SC], or 
240 [SC] mg), along with the  accumulated safety and available PK/PD data from all subjects in 
the previous dose cohorts, to make a decision on whether to proceed to the next higher dose 
level, repeat a dose level , or stop dose escalation.   Overall, there were no clinically significant

All doses selected for the MAD portion are projected not  to exceed the mean  exposure of that 
achieved following the highest single dose of 240 mg SC administered in the Phase 1 SAD 
study.  Cohort 1 will include randomized treatment to the 20 mg dose.  Based on the staggered 
study design, t he data monitoring committee ( DMC ) will perform a scheduled review of safety 
data and sequentially consider dose escalation for  Cohorts  [ADDRESS_380994] into the proof of concept ( POC) Phase 2  portion.  This  POC dose decision will be  based 
on evaluation of the PK , safety  (inclusive of dose -limiting toxicity [DLT]), and tolerability data 
(and available PD/biomarker data ) from Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 from the MAD portion ( see

patient s with moderately to severely active SLE will be ongoing, with step -wise evaluations  
during the staggered MAD portion.  The DMC used in this study is charged with assessing such 
actions in  light of an acceptable benefit -risk profile for BOS161721 as an anti -IL-21 mAb.

The benefit of participation for all patient s in this study is close monitoring of their medical 
condition and safety of their treatment.  Those randomized to the active treatment arm may 
potentially experience improvement in their  SLE  disease.  Those randomized to the placebo (in 
combination with s tandard of care) arm are not expected to obtain any additional benefit, beyond 
those of their background treatment, though close monitoring of their medical condition and 
safety may itself be associated with improving their SLE .

result in immune complex disease (with mani festations su ch as arthralgias, se rum-sickn ess, and 
vasculitis), or a ltered BOS161721 leve ls or ac tivity.  Further details can be found in the current 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for BOS161721, which contains comprehensive toxicology, 
preclinical and clinical information on BOS161721. 
Two investigational drug products are considered to be in the same pharmacological class as 
BOS161721 based on interruption of signaling through the IL -[ADDRESS_380998].  No 
potential risk generalizable across the class has been observed with these investigational 
products.  Based on the clinical Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721- 01), AEs reported as related to 
the study drug, particularly infections (flu- like symptoms, etc), were expected for the compound, 
and there were no clinically relevant changes in laboratory and ECG results or vital signs.  
The majority of IgG elimination occurs via intracellular catabolism, following fluid -phase or 
receptor -mediated endocytosis.  This type of endocytosis and elimination is a form of 
target- mediated disposition where the interaction of the drug and its pharmacological target 
(eg, a target receptor) serves as a significant contributor to the kinetics of antibody distribution 
and elimination.  Renal elimination, which is a primary pathway of clearance of small -molecule 
drugs, is relatively unimportant for IgG, as its large size prevents efficient filtration through the 
glomerulus.  Secretion into the bile is an importan t pathway of elimination of IgA antibodies, but 
this route is not a significant contributor to the elimination of IgG antibodies.  Thus, risk to renal 
and hepatic systems due to metabolism of BOS161721 is low.33

As with the administration of any foreign protein and/or other biological agents, acute 
hypersensitivity reactions, including acute anaphylactic/hypersensitivity, severe allergic, and 
anaphylactoid reactions may follow infusion of mAbs and can be caused by [CONTACT_62535].  
These acute hypersensitivity reactions may be severe and result in death.  
Anaphylaxis will be defined according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (NIAID/FAAN) criteria ,34 and are discussed in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].1. 
Based on the limited Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721- 01), anaphylaxis and serious allergic 
reactions in subjects who received BOS161721 was not observed.   
Patients with a known history of allergy or severe hypersensitivity reaction to any component of 
BOS161721 formulation or patients with a history of anaphylaxis to any other biological therapy 
such as mAbs will be excluded from studies with BOS161721.  In addition, appropriate drugs 
and medical equipment to treat acute hypotensive, bronchoconstrictive, or anaphylactic reactions 
will be immediately available at the unit and study personnel will be trained to recognize and 
treat these reactions.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Injection Site Reactions  
In a repeat -dose GLP toxicology study in Cynomolgus monkeys, BOS161721 was administered 
every 2 weeks by [CONTACT_310154] 3 months (a total of 7  doses) .  There were no injection site 
reactions in animals d osed subcutaneously.  Further, there were no reports of inj ection site 
reactions in the 26- week GLP toxicology study in Cynomolgus monkeys . 
Based on the Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721- 01), incidence of injection site reactions in 
subjects who received BOS161721 was similar to placebo.   
Patients will be monitored for local injection site reactions in this study.  See Section 6.2.7.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Immune Complex Disease 
The potential risk of immune complex disease for BOS161721 is theoretical, based on the known 
risks associated with mAbs.  The administration of a mAb can result in the formation of ADAs.  
Administration of the mAb in the presence of ADA may result  in the formation of circulating 
antibody -antigen complexes potentially resulting in altered BOS161721 levels or activity or 
deposition of the complexes in microvasculature.  Complement is frequently involved in the 
latter setting, and the breakdown produc ts of complement attract polymorphonuclear leukocytes 
to the site of deposition where they can provoke local tissue damage through specific or 
nonspecific release of enzymes.  Two of the more common end -organ targets are the blood 
vessels (vasculitis) and kidney (nephritis).  These clinical manifestations represent immune 
complex disease or Type III hypersensitivity.  Although BOS161721 is a humanized mAb, 
ADAs may develop; however, the likelihood of occurrence of immune complex disease with 
BOS161721 is low.  The findings of immune complex disease are typi[INVESTIGATOR_310116]- antigen complexes are cleared from the body .

who re ceived BOS161721 was not observed.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Infections  
BOS161721 is expected to diminish the activity of T -cell, B -cell and NK -cell lines.  Like other 
medications modulating immune response, BOS161721 may increase the potential risk for  
infection, including serious  infections.  IL -21 produced by [CONTACT_398]4+ Th cells is required to sustain 
the anti -viral function of CD8+ T -cells against chronic viral infections.  Nonclinical evidence 
suggests that the risk of chronic viral infection recurrence or increased severity may occu r with 
IL-21 inhibition.35 
These conditions will be fully characterized with clinical descriptions and routine laboratory 
and/or specialty testing and treated where indicated with appropriate local standard of care.  
Patients with a history of opportunistic infection, including recurrent or severe  disseminated 
herpes zoster or disseminated herpes simplex  within the last 3 years , or any other underlying 
pathology predisposing to serious infection, are excluded from studies with BOS161721 (for 
further details please refer to the current IB for BOS161721). 
Patients will be assessed for hepatitis B, and C, and HIV- 1/[ADDRESS_380999] been observed in 
immunosuppressed liver transplant and human immunodeficiency virus patients.36,37  Since 
BOS161721 is expected to diminish the immunosurveillance activity of T -cell, B-cell, and 
NK-cell lines, a similar risk is biologically plausible with prolonged exposure to BOS161721. 
Since the risk of opportunistic cryptosporidium infection increases with low levels of 
CD4+  T-cells,37 patients with a CD4+ count < 500 cell/mm3 were excluded from the Phase 1 
SAD study (BOS161721 -01), and CD4 + <  350 cells/mm3 will be excluded from the MAD/POC 
parts of the study.  Patients exposed to investigational product who develop diarrhea during the 
course of the study should immediately undergo an assessment for opportunistic infection 
including stool for ova and parasites and stool examination for cryptosporidium.  Positive 
cryptosporidium in stool sample at screening is an exclusion.  Treatment by [CONTACT_310210].  
Based on the limited Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721- 01), infections in subjects who received 
BOS161721  was not observed.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Malignancy  
The stimulatory effect of IL -21 on NK cells and CD8+ T -cells suggests the cytokine may have 
anti-tumor activity.  Nonclinical studies have demonstrated significant anti- tumor effects of 
IL-21 in a number of tumor models.  IL -21 therapy of human metastatic melanoma and renal cell 
carcinoma has demonstrated POC with significant increases in levels of perforin, granzyme B,

been limited in these generally unmanageable diseases.  
The impact of treatment with anti- IL-21 therapy on the development or growth of malignancies 
is not known; however, as with other immunomodulatory biologic agents, treatment with 
BOS16 [ADDRESS_381000] 5 yea rs, with the exception 
of non-melanoma skin c ancer or cervical cancer in situ t reated w ith apparent suc cess wi th

Based on the limited Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721- 01), malignancy in subjects who received 
BOS161721  was not observed.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatic Function Abnormality 
There is no substantial evidence suggesting BOS161721 is associated with liver function 
abnormality.  However , as a precaution, p atients with a history of abnormal alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT)  and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or bilirubin at screening 
(ALT /AST  > 2 × upper limit of normal [ULN] ; total bilirubin >  1.5 ×  [ULN] and judged by [CONTACT_119278]) were excluded from the Phase 1 SAD study 
(BOS161721- 01), and will be excluded from this trial.  Patients with a positive hepatitis B or C 
test or a history of alcohol dependence will also be excluded.  
Based on the limited Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721- 01), hepatic function abnormality in 
subjects who received BO S161721 was not observed.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Failure of Vaccination  
IL-21 is a key cytokine in development of B -cells into immunoglobulin -secreting plasma cells.  
Abnormal signaling through the IL -21R/Janus Kinase (JAK)3/signal transducer and activator of 
transcription ( STAT3)  pathway leads to defective humoral immune responses to both 
T-dependent and T -independent antigens and impairs the establishment of long- lasting B -cell 
memory.  Abnormal signaling through the pathway has been related to decreased specific 
antibody responses following vaccination, and to increased susceptibility to encapsulated 
bacterial infections.[ADDRESS_381001] of BOS161721 was evaluated in in vivo single dose studies in Cynomolgus monkey in 
which the animals received vaccination to T -cell dependent KLH a ntigen to stimulate a TDAR.  
These in vivo studies demonstrated that BOS161721 significantly inhibited B -cell proliferation 
and IgG antibody responses to the KLH protein antigen; however, it is worth noting that 
BOS161721 administration did not produce any remarkable changes in anti -KLH antibody data 
for IgM, IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4 or anti -tetanus toxoid ( TT) antibody data for IgM, IgG, IgG1, or 
IgE during the dosing phase in the same study.

Investigators should always manage their patients according to their medical judgment which 
may include interruption  of study drug based on the particular clinical circumstances.  
[IP_ADDRESS] DMC Recommen dations   
During scheduled meetings, the DMC will review relevant study data for safety or benefit -risk 
concern.  During the MAD part of the study, t he DMC may provide the following 
recommendation s to the sponsor : 
• Expanding a cohort at a specific dosing level, or repeat ing a lower dose in a subsequent 
cohort  
• Continuing a dose level for a given cohort  
• Escalating a dose level  for a subsequent cohort  
• Termination of current or previous cohort(s)  
Further dosing in a given cohort will be halted if [ADDRESS_381007] into the POC Phase  2 part of the 
study.  This POC dose decision will be base d on evaluation of the PK, safety (inclusive of 
dose-limiting toxicity [DLT]), and tolerability data (and available PD/biomarker data) from 
Cohorts 1, 2, and 3; this dose will not exceed doses tested during the MAD portion.  The DMC 
will be reviewing all relevant data from Cohorts 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_381008] dose .  Details are provided in the DMC Charter.   
3.1.2 POC  Phase 2   
[IP_ADDRESS] BOS161721 Dose  
The optimal dose is chosen based on MAD Phase 1 b safety, t olerability, immunogenicity, and 
PK and PD data .  The  dose will be communicated by a letter to site investigators  participating in  
the POC Phase 2 portion, and to the IRB/ IEC. 
[IP_ADDRESS] POC Study Design 
For t he POC part of the study, approximately  156 additional patient s will be randomized to 
active or placebo groups in a 2:1  ratio.   
As in the MAD part of the study, e ach patient  in the POC portion may receive a total of 7 SC 
monthly doses of study drug on Days 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180.  Assessments will be 
completed according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Section  3.4).  Dose selection will be based 
on the DMC and sponsor’s assessment of safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and PK and PD 
data from the MAD portion of 30 patients treated with BOS161721/placebo.

Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- 02 
Protocol Date and Version:  27 July 2018 ; V4.[ADDRESS_381009] generated by [CONTACT_64693] , non- study statistician.  Randomization will be performed separately for each study 
portion and separately for each cohort in the Phase 1 b and 2 portions  as follows:  
Phase/Cohort  Number of Patients  Randomization Ratio BOS161721:Placebo  
Phase 1 b/Cohort 1  6 5:1 
Phase  1b/Cohort 2  12 3:1 
Phase 1 b/Cohort 3  12 3:1 
Phase 2  156* 2:1 
*Additional patient s may be enrolled to ensure  sufficient numbers of patient s are in the full analysis set ( FAS). 
Eligible patients  will be assigned to the study portion which is active at time of enrollment.  
Similarly, patients  in the Phase 1b MAD will be assigned to the cohort which is  active.  Each 
patient  will be assigned a unique randomization number which will not be reused.   
All patients , investigators, and study team participants will be blinded to treatment assignment.  
An independent biostatistician not otherwise involved on the study will be unblinded and prepare 
materials for the  interim analysis (IA ) and the DMC safety reviews.  The DMC will review 
unblinded data during safety reviews and the IA.  A  limited team at [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals will  
review unblinded results from the Phase 1b MAD portion during the IA to determine the dose 
that will be used for the Phase 2 P OC portion of the study.  Details regarding maintenance of the 
blinding and content of data reviews will be described in the DMC charter  or related study 
documentation.

5.5 Premature Discontinuation  
While patients are encouraged to complete all study evaluations, they may withdraw from the 
study at any time and for any reason.  Every effort will be made to determine why any patient  
withdraws from the study prematurely.  If th e patient is unreachable by [CONTACT_756], a registered 
letter, at the minimum, should be sent to the patient requesting him/her to contact [CONTACT_3652].  
All patients who withdraw from the study with an ongoing AE or SAE must be followed until 
the end of study or until the event is resolved or deemed stable, respectively .   
If a patient  withdraws prematurely after dosing, an end of treatment (EO T) visit should be 
performed (Day 180) and a last follow -up visit 90 days after dosing should be scheduled 
(Day 270).  Safety follow-up visit procedures based on the Schedule of Assessments 
(see Section  5.4). 
Patient  participation may be terminated prior to completing the study and the reason recorded as 
follows: 
• AE/SAE  
• Protocol deviation  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Patient  withdraws consent at their own request  
• Investigator decision 
• Decision by [CONTACT_3211] (other than AE/SAE, protocol deviation, or lost to follow-up) 
Withdrawn patients may be replaced after discussion between the i nvestigator or designee and 
sponsor.

6.2.1 Laboratory Assessment s 
Laboratory tests will be performed at times defined in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Section  3.4).  Patient  eligibility will be determined based on these tests at screening.  
Unscheduled clinical labs may be obtained at any time during the study to assess any perceived 
safety concerns.  
A central laboratory will be used  (with the exception of urine pregnancy tests)  to ensure accuracy 
and consi stency in test results.  Laboratory/analyte results that could unblind the study (ie, 
biomarker results) will not be reported to investigative sites.   Urinalysis will be performed on

serum pregnancy result at screening, appropriate contraception must be commenced or 
continued and a further negative urine pregnancy test result s will then be required at t he baseline 
visit before the patient may receive the investigational product.  Urine pregnancy tests will also 
be routinely repeated at study drug administration visits prior to study drug administration, at  the

6.2.2 Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence experienced by a study patient , whether 
or not considered drug related by [CONTACT_2026] i nvestigator.    
AEs are unfavorable changes in a general condition, subjec tive or  objective signs or symptoms, 
worsening of pre -existing concomitant disease, and clinically significant abnormality  in 
laboratory parameters observed in a patient  in the course of a clinical study.   
Non-serious SLE manifestations  or abnormal laboratory re sults related to SLE  disease activity  
would not be recorded as AEs  unless they meet the definition for SAE s (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Recording of Adverse Events  
AEs should be collected and recorded for each patient  from the date of the first dose of study 
drug until the end of their participation in the study, including the safety follow up period.   
AEs may be volunteered spontaneously by [CONTACT_4694] , or discovered by [CONTACT_14543], nonleading question such as ‘How have you 
been feeling since you were last asked?’   All AEs and any required remedial action will be 
recorded  on the Adverse Events eCRF  and Safety Adverse Event Form .  The details of the AE, 
date of AE onset, date of AE outcome, and action taken for  the AE will be documented together 
with the p rincipal investigator’s assessment of the seriousness of the AE and causal relationship 
to the study drug and/or the study procedure.  
All AEs should be recorded individually, using diagnostic terms  where possible.   If the diagnosis 
is not established,  individual symptom s may be reported .  The AEs will subsequently be coded 
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).    
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity of Adverse Events  
Each AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_310117] (NCI CTCAE), version 4.03 criteria. 41  
When changes in the severity (grade) of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the 
maximum severity for the event should be noted for that day.  Any change in severity of signs

Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- 02 
Protocol Date and Version:  27 July 2018 ; V4.0 
Confidential   Page 68 of 118 and symptoms over a number of days will be captured by [CONTACT_44745] a new AE, with the amended 
severity grade and the date (and time, if known) of the change. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Causality  of Adverse Events  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310084]161721 or placebo and 
the AE.  One of the following categories (Table 4) should be selected based on medical 
judgment, considering the definitions below and all contributing factors.  
Table 4. Causality Definitions  
Related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurs in a plausible time 
relationship to treatment administration and  which concurrent disease or other 
drugs or chemicals cannot explain.  The response to withdrawal of the treatment 
(dechallengea) should be clinically plausible.  The event must be definitive 
pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory re challengeb 
procedure if necessary.  
Unrelated  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no temporal 
relationship with treatment administration.  May have negative dechallenge and 
rechallenge information.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_261969] 
(eg, concomitant disease, environmental factors, or other drugs or chemicals).  
a Dechallenge:  Upon discontinuation of a drug suspected of causing an AE, the symptoms of the AE disappear 
partially or completely, within a reasonable  time from drug discontinuation (positive dechallenge), or the 
symptoms continue despi[INVESTIGATOR_211386] (negative dechallenge).  Note that there are exceptions 
when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet drug relatedness clearly  exists (for 
example, as in bone marrow suppression, fixed drug eruptions, or tardive dyskinesia).  
b Rechallenge:   Upon re -administration of a drug suspected of causing an AE in a specific patient in the past, 
the AE recurs upon exposure (positive rechall enge), or the AE does not recur  (negative rechallenge).  
An unexpected adverse drug event is any adverse drug event for which the specificity or severity 
is not consistent with the current IP . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Seriousness  of Adverse Events  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening; this means that the patient  was at risk of death at the time of the event; it 
does not mean that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe  
• Requires ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_211384]  
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Is another important medical event ( see below)  
Important medical events that do not result in death, are not life threatening, or do not require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical judgment, they

Confidential   Page 69 of 118 may jeopardize the patient  and may require medical or surg ical intervention to prevent 1 of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.   Examples of such events are:  
• Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm  
• Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Development of drug dependency or drug abuse  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310085] 
(eg, elective surgery for a pre -existing condition that has not worsened) need not be considered 
SAEs.  If anything untoward is reported during the procedure, that occurrence must be reported 
as an AE, either 'serious' or 'nonserious' according to the usual criteria.  
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are AEs that are associated w ith the 
use of the drug and are serious and unexpected.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events of Special Interest  
AEs of special interest in this study include  the following : 
1. Anaphylaxis and serious allergic reactions  
2. Grade s 2 to 5 i njection site reaction, including erythema, pain, and induration 
(See APPENDIX 6)  
3. Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) assessed following Hy’s L aw 
4. Malignancy  
5. Opportunistic infections such as disseminated histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and 
disseminated tuberculosis  
6. Cryptosporidiasis  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Anaphylaxis  and Serious Allergic Reactions  
Anaphylaxis will be defined according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (NIAID/FAAN) criteria.42  In the event of 
anaphylactic reaction or severe/serious hypersensitivity/allergic reaction, the patient  must 
discontinue IP and emergency resuscitation measures implemented.  In case of other mild to 
moderate hypersensitivity re action, depending on the severity, the investigator may manage in 
accordance with the standard -of-care.  
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria is fulfilled:  
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal 
tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus, or flushing, swollen lips -tongue -uvula) and at 
least 1 of the following:  
a. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] [PEF], hypoxem ia) 
b. Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end- organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia

c. Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [c ollapse], syncope, 
incontinence)  
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)  
3. Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several 
hours):  
a. Systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg o r greater than 30% decrease from the 
patient’s baseline  
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Injection Site Reactions 
Injection site reactions are to be captured and reported as AEs.  These will  include Grades  2 to 5 
injection site erythema, pain, and induration (see APPENDIX  6), which are also captured as 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (See Section [IP_ADDRESS]) .  The investigator should provide a clear 
description of the observed or reported AE including location and severity.  All concomitant 
treatments used to treat injection site reactions should be recorded and captured in the eCRF, 
together with the AE of injection site reactions.   
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_381049] and/or ALT levels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total 
bilirubin level that meet the criteria outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury 
are con sidered potential cases of DILI, and as potential Hy’s Law cases, and should always be 
considered important medical events.   If symptoms compatible with DILI precede knowledge of 
serum chemical test abnormalities, liver enzyme measurements should be made i mmediately, 
regardless of when the next visit or monitoring interval is scheduled.  In some cases, symptoms 
may be an early sign of injury and although typi[INVESTIGATOR_310118], they may indicate a need for prompt serum testing .  An increase in liver enzymes 
should be confirmed by a repeated test within [ADDRESS_381050] be reported as SAEs (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 for reporting details).  
Potential DILI is defined as:  
1. ALT or AST elevation > 3 × ULN  
AND

Confidential   Page 71 of 118 2. Total bilirubin > 2 × ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase)  
AND  
3. No other immediately apparent possible causes of A LT or AST elevation and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre -existing chronic or acute 
liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic  
The patient  should return to the inve stigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, include 
laboratory tests, detailed history , and physical assessment.  In addition to repeating 
measurements of AST and ALT, laboratory tests should include albumin, CK, total bilirubin, 
direct and indi rect bilirubin, GGT , prothrombin time (PT)/International Normalized Ratio (INR), 
and alkaline phosphatase.  A detailed history, including relevant information, such as review of 
ethanol, acetaminophen, recreational drug and supplement consumption, family history, 
occupational exposure, sexual history, travel history, history of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, 
surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be 
collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary 
tract) may be warranted.  All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria 
defined above, with no other cause for liver function test (LFT) abnormalities identified at the 
time should be  considered potential Hy’s Law cases irrespective of availability of all the results 
of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the abnormal LFTs.  Such potential 
Hy’s Law cases should be reported as SAEs.  
Study drug discontinuation is consid ered if there is marked serum AST or ALT elevation or 
evidence of functional impairment  (as indicated by [CONTACT_310177], which represent 
substantial liver injury ) that is related to study drug.   Discontinuation of treatment should be 
considered if : 
• ALT or AST > 8 × ULN  
• ALT or AST > 5× ULN for more than [ADDRESS_381051] occur if:   
• ALT or AST >3 × ULN and (total bilirubin  > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5)  
• ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>  5%)  
[IP_ADDRESS].4 Malignancy  
The identification of a malignancy event will be made by [CONTACT_310221].  AEs should be reported as serious per the criteria i n Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
After the first dose of study drug, when there is a decision to biopsy a potentially malignant 
tumor, lymph node, or other tissue, the investigator and/or consultant(s) should contact [CONTACT_310261].

cryptosporid ium in the stool at screening, and as clinically indicated (eg, watery diarrhea) during 
the study.  If a patient develops diarrhea during the study a stool sample must be provided to test 
for ova, parasites, and cryptosporidium.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of Adverse Events  
AE reporting  will be carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations, including 
regulatory agency and IRB reporting requirements.    
Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for an SAE.  If an SAE occurs, 
expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate, and is further 
outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS].2. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Reporting of Pregnancy  
As information is available, a pregnancy diagnosed during the study will be reported within 
24 hours to the s ponsor  via the Pregnancy Notification and Outc ome Form , including pregnancy 
in female patients who received study drug and female partners of male study patient s who 
received study drug.  The pregnancy should be followed to term and/or outcome and this 
outcome should also be reported to the s ponsor  via the Pregnancy Notification and Outcome 
Form .  Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE or SAE unless there is complication.  
In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of 
birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if 
clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by [CONTACT_61321] (unless pre -procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital a nomaly and

If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an  AE or  SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a live 
born, a terminated fetus, a n intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator 
should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.

immediately, irrespective of the  extent of available AE information.  This timeframe also applies 
to additional new information (follow -up) on previously forwarded SAE reports as well as to the 
initial and follow -up reporting of exposure during pregnancy and exposure via breastfeeding 
cases.  In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE 
immediately (eg, if an outpatient study patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the 
investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of 
his/her first awareness of the AE.  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310119].  All SAEs will be recorded from the time of first dose 
of study drug through the safety follow -up period ( up to D ay 270) .  SAEs  occurring after the 
final f ollow -up visit and coming to the attention of the principal i nvestigator must be reported 
only if there is (in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_14371]) reasonable causal relationship with 
the study drug. 
As a minimum requirement, the initial notification should provide the following information:  
• Study number  
• Patient  number  
• Details of the SAE  (verbatim details are sufficient for immediate notification) 
• Criterion for classification as ‘serious’ 
• Causality assessment ( which may be updated in a follow -up report when sufficient 
information is available to make this classification) 
Initial reports of SAEs must be followed later with detailed descriptions, including clear

Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate , and body temperature) will be assessed as specified in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Sectio n 3.4 ).  Vital signs will be assessed on Day  0 at predose and at 
Day 0, 1 and 2 hours postdose , as well as on each of the scheduled visit days  during the study 
(excluding PK -only site visits) .  Supi[INVESTIGATOR_310089]  ≥ 5 minutes.  When the timing of these measurements 
coincides with a blood collection, vital signs should be obtained prior to the time of the blood 
collection.  
6.2.4 12-Lead Electrocardiograms  
ECG will be assessed as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 3.4) .  ECG recording 
will initiate after the patient  has been supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] [ADDRESS_381057] leads and a Lead II rhythm strip on the bottom of the

the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 3.4) .  It includes evaluation of pa tient complaints and SLE 
disease -related issues, and will exclude the genitourinary system . 
6.2.6 C-SSRS  
The C-SSRS is a low -burden measure of the spectrum of suicidal ideation and behavior that was 
developed by [CONTACT_310249] I nstitute of Mental Health 
Treatment of Adolescent Suicide Attempters Study to assess severity and track suicidal events 
through any treatment.  It is a clinical interview providing a summary of both ideation and 
behavior that can be administered during any evaluation or risk assessment to identify the level 
and type of suicidality present.  The C -SSRS can also be used during treatment to monitor for 
clinical worsening.43 
The C -SSRS evaluation will be performed as specified in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Section 3.4).  Patients with recent (within the past 12 months) or active suicidal ideation or 
behavior based on patient responding “yes” to question 3, 4, or [ADDRESS_381059] responses to the C -SSRS reviewed in detail to assess patient 
risk, and appropriate c onsultative mental health services will be provided.  
6.2.7 Injection Site Reactions 
Patients will be monitored for local injection site reactions  as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Section 3.4 ).  Local injection site reactions will be assessed at [ADDRESS_381060]  (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS].3) .

All efficacy assessments will be performed at times defined in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Section  3.4). 
6.3.1 SLEDAI -2K 
The SLEDAI -2K is a validated instrument that measures disease activity in SLE patients at the 
time of the visit and in the previous 30 days.  It is a global index and includes 24 clinical and 
laboratory variables that are weighted by [CONTACT_310181], but not by [CONTACT_926].  The total 
score falls between 0 and 105, with higher scores representing increased disease activity.  The 
SLEDAI -2K has been shown to be a valid and rel iable disease activity measure in multiple 
patient  groups.  A SLEDAI - 2K of 6 or more generally represents moderately to severely active 
disease.44 
6.3.2 BILAG  2004 
The BILAG -2004 index is an organ -specific 97- question assessment based on the principle of 
the doc tor’s intent to treat.  Only clinical features attributable to SLE disease activity are to be 
recorded and based on the patient ’s condition in the last 4 weeks compared with the previous 
4 weeks.  It will be scored as not present (0), improved (1), the sam e (2), worse (3), or new 
(4).  Disease activity is graded separately for 9 body systems to 5 different grades (A to E) as 
follows:  A (“Active”)  is very active disease, B  (“Beware”)  is moderate activity, C 
(“Contentment”) is mild stable disease, D (“Discount”) is inactive now but previously active , and 
E (“Excluded”)  indicates the organ was never involved.[ADDRESS_381062] maintain 
documentation with descriptive details supporting the BILAG -2004 scoring (eg, cha rt, 
worksheet, clinic notes, and labs) at each visit.  
See APPENDIX  5 for detailed specifications.  
6.3.3 PGA of Disease Activity  
The PGA is used to assess investigator’s general impression on the patient’s overall status of 
SLE disease activity  via visual analogue scale (10 0 mm) with 0 being “very good, asymptomatic 
and no limitation of normal activities” with 100 mm being “most severe possible disease ever 
seen in all SLE patients”.   PGA worsening is defined as an increase of >  30 mm  from baseline.  
When scoring the PGA, the assessor should always look back at the score from the previous 
visit.

[IP_ADDRESS] SRI-4 Response  
The SRI -4 is a composite index of SLE disease improvement that consists of scores derived from 
the SLEDAI -2K and the BILAG 2004 Index.  Response based on the SRI -4 is defined by:  
1) ≥ 4-point reduction in SLEDAI -2K global score, 2) no new seve re disease activity (BILAG  A 
organ score) or more than 1 new moderate organ score (BILAG B) , and 3) no deterioration from 
baseline in the PGA by ≥ [ADDRESS_381063] improve ments in c linical and patient- reported outcomes.45  
[IP_ADDRESS] SRI-5 and SRI -6 Response  
Like the SRI -4, the SRI -5 and SRI -6 are composite indices of SLE disease improvement that 
consists of scores derived from the SLEDAI -2K and the BILAG 2004 Index.  However, the 
SRI-5 and SRI -6 are computed with a minimal five -point or six-point improvement in 
SLEDAI -2K being required, respectively.46 
[IP_ADDRESS] BICLA Response  
The BICLA is a responder index developed to measure response to therapy, and it includes 
scores from the BILAG, SLEDAI -2K, and PGA.  BICLA response is defined as 1) at least 
1 gradation of improvement in baseline BILAG  2004 scores in all body systems with moderate 
disease activity at entry (eg, all B [ moderate disease]  scores falling to C [ mild], or D [no 
activity ]); 2) no ne w BILAG A or more than 1 new BILAG B scores; 3) no worsening of total 
SLEDAI -2K score from baseline; 4) ≤ 10% deterioration in PGA score  and 5) no treatment 
failure .44  It is driven primarily by [CONTACT_310182], and has been used in Phase 2 and 3 mAb 
studies.47 
For the endpoint s of BICLA respons e at D ays 210, 240, and 270, patient scores will be 
completed and resp onse determined. 
6.3.5  CLASI Response  
The CLASI is a comprehensive tool for assessment of disease activity and damage in cutaneous 
lupus, shown to be valid, reliable, and sensitive to changes in disease activity. 48  Response is 
defined as  50% improvement from baseline in “ A” or “B” scores.  This assessment will be 
applied to all patients as all are required to have cutaneous disease activity . 
For the secondary efficacy endpoint of CLASI response at D ay 210, patient scores on MAD and 
POC st udies will be compared with baseline for 50% improvement.

6.4.1 SLICC/ACR Damage Index  
The SLICC/ACR damage index is a validated instrument to assess damage, defined as 
irreversible impairment, continuously persistent for 6 months (ascertained by [CONTACT_13113]), occurring since the onset of lupus, and it is based on a weighted scoring system.
  
This index records damage occurring in patients with SLE regardless of cause, with demonstrated content, face, criterion, and discriminant validity.
49  It will be performed on Days 0 
and 180. 
6.4.2 PROs  
Patients should be encouraged to complete the PROs at the clinic at the beginning of the study 
visit prior to any clinical assessments.  A member of the staff should be available if a patient requires further instruction and to review the PRO questionnaires for completeness prior to leaving the clinic.  The PROs include the  and the  and will be assessed as

FAS analyses will be conducted on the basis of the randomized treatment.   
A per protocol (PP) analysis set may be defined to exclude major protocol violations from the 
efficacy analysis.  The PP Population will include all patients from the FAS except those with 
major violations to the protocol deemed to impact the analysis of  the primary endpoint.  These 
violations will be identified based on blinded data prior to study unblinding.  PP analyses will be 
conducted on the basis of the randomized treatment. 
Safety analyses will be based on the safety a nalysis s et (SS) , defined as all patients who receive 
at least 1  dose of study treatment.  Safety analyses will be conducted on the basis of actual 
treatment received .  
Pharmacokinetic analysis will be conducted on the PK analysis set, defined as the FAS with

Baseline and patient characteristics will be summarized  using all randomized patients .   
8.2.3 Primary  Efficacy  Endpoint(s)  
The proportion of patients who achieve a  SRI-4 response at D ay 210 will be assessed  via 
Pearson’s chi -squared analysis.  The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using the FAS 
and if needed repeated in  the PP analysis set.   Missing values will be addressed by [CONTACT_18120] a 
last observation carried forward (LOCF) analysis .  Other imputation methods may be employed 
as a sensitivity analysis and will be described in  the SAP.   Additional analyses exploring impact 
of baseline factors such as baseline disease severity, race, and other characteristics may be 
performed.  
Patients  that received prohibited medications or unallowable CS usage as described in 
Section  4.6 will be considered “medication failures” and will be treated as non- responders for the 
primary efficacy analysis.   Patients that received an allowable CS burst but having missing data 
at Day 210 will considered a medication failure and will be treated as non -responders for the 
primary eff icacy analysis.  The determination of medication failures will be reviewed using 
blinded data and finalized prior to unblinding.   
The superiority of BOS161721 relative to placebo will be evaluated.  If the proportion of SRI -4 
responders for the selected POC dose in BOS161721 arm is higher than that of the placebo arm, 
then BOS161721 will be considered superior to placebo if the 2- sided p-value is less than 0.10.

9 ETHICS AND RESPONSIB ILITIES  
9.1 Good Clinical Practice  
The procedures set out in this protocol  are designed to ensure that the sponsor and the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310121]  (ICH) 
guidelines on GCP and the Declaration of Helsinki (Version 2013).  The clinical study also will 
be carried out in the keepi[INVESTIGATOR_73934] (in accordance with US 
IND regulations [21 CFR 56]). 
9.2 DMC  
This study will use an external DMC.  The DMC is an independent committee established to 
provide oversight of safety considerations in study and to provide advice to the sponsor 
regarding actions the committee deems necessary  for the continuing protection of enrolled 
patients and those yet to be recruited to the trial as well as for the continuing validity and 
scientific merit of the study results.  The DMC is charged with assessing such actions in light of 
an acceptable benef it/risk profile for BOS161721.  The recommendations made by [CONTACT_1363] (ie, 
dose escalation, etc.) will be forwarded to the sponsor for final decision.  The sponsor will 
forward such decisions, which may include summaries of safety data which are not endpoint s, to 
regulatory authorities, as appropriate.  
The sponsor will appoint a DMC for the periodic review of available study data.  The DMC is an 
independent group of experts that advises the sponsor and the study investigators.  The members 
of the DMC serve in an individual capacity and provide their expertise and recommendations.  
The primary responsibilities of the DMC  are to (1)  periodically review and evaluate the 
BOS161721 [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- 02 
Protocol Date and Version:  27 July 2018 ; V4.[ADDRESS_381073], and progress, (2) make 
recommendations to the sponsor concerning the continuation, modification, or termination of the 
study and (3) suggest  dose for POC portion of the study as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
The DMC considers study -specific data as well as relevant background knowledge about the 
disease, test agent, or patient population under study.  The DMC is responsible for defining its 
deliberative processes, includin g event triggers that would call for an unscheduled review, 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_15381], unmasking (unblinding), and voting procedures prior to initiating any data

of each of the source data to be verified and the percentage of patients’ eCRFs to be monitored.  
9.[ADDRESS_381079].  The study 
monitor will verify that each p atient has proper consent documentation from the patient and/or 
patient’s authorized representative for study procedures and for the release of medical records to 
the sponsor, FDA, other regulatory authorities, and the IRB.  The study monitor will also ver ify 
that assent was obtained for patients not capable of providing informed consent or that 
documentation is provided by [CONTACT_310263].  The investigator or appointed delegate will receive the stud y monitor during these on- site 
visits and will cooperate in providing the documents for inspection and respond to inquiries.  In 
addition, the investigator will permit inspection of the study files by [CONTACT_310228].  On completion of the study, the study monitor will arrange for a final 
review of the study files after which the files should be secured for the appropriate time period.  
Throughout the course of the study, the medical monitor will determine eligibility of  all screened 
patients, will address any medical issues that might arise, clarify medical questions, review 
patient safety data (eg, AE/SAE, laboratory, and ECG),  and partner with the study team in the 
overall study management.  The study medical monitoring plan will document additional details 
of the study medical oversight and monitoring.

Protocol Date and Version:  27 July 2018 ; V4.[ADDRESS_381093] the health of the people.  The physician’s 
knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty.  
The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association binds the physician with the 
words, "The health of  my subject will be my first consideration," and the International Code of 
Medical Ethics declares that, "A physician shall act only in the subject's interest when providing 
medical care which might have the effect of weakening the physical and mental cond ition of the 
subject."  
Medical progress is based on research, which ultimately must rest in part on experimentation 
involving human subjects. 
In medical research on human subjects, considerations related to the well -being of the human 
subject should take precedence over the interests of science and society.  
The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to improve prophylactic, 
diagnostic, and therapeutic procedures and the understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of 
disease.  Ev en the best -proven prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods must 
continuously be challenged through research for their effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility,  and 
quality.

Protocol Date and Version:  27 July 2018 ; V4.[ADDRESS_381095]’s information and to minimize the impact of the study on the subject's physical and 
mental integrity and on the personality of the subject.  
In any research on human beings, each potential subject mus t be adequately informed of the 
aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of 
the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may 
entail.  The subject sh ould be informed of the right to abstain from participation in the study or to 
withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal.  After ensuring that the subject has 
understood the information, the physician should then obtain the subject's fre ely-given informed 
consent, preferably in writing.  If the consent cannot be obtained in writing, the non- written 
consent must be formally documented and witnessed.  
When obtaining informed consent for the research project the physician should be particular ly 
cautious if the subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under 
duress.  In that case the informed consent should be obtained by a well -informed physician who 
is not engaged in the investigation and who is completely independent of this relationship.  
For a research subject who is legally incompetent, physically or mentally incapable of giving 
consent or is a legally incompetent minor, the investigator must obtain informed consent from 
the legally authorized representative i n accordance with applicable law.  These groups should not 
be included in research unless the research is necessary to promote the health of the population 
represented and this research cannot instead be performed on legally competent persons.  
When a subje ct deemed legally incompetent, such as a minor child, is able to give assent to 
decisions about participation in research, the investigator must obtain that assent in addition to 
the consent of the legally authorized representative.  
Research on individuals  from whom it is not possible to obtain consent, including proxy or 
advance consent, should be done only if the physical/mental condition that prevents obtaining

free to use unproven or new prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic measures, if in the 
physician’s judgment it offe rs hope of saving life, re -establishing health, or alleviating suffering.  
Where possible, these measures should be made the object of research, designed to evaluate their 
safety and efficacy.  In all cases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, 
published.  The other relevant guidelines of this Declaration should be followed.

Title:  A Randomized Double -Blind Phase  1b/2 Combined Staggered Multiple 
Dose Escalation Study of BOS161721 in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus 
(SLE) Patients on a Background of Limited Standard of Care 
Indication  Adults with moderately to severely active SLE  
Background 
and Rationale SLE is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease with considerable 
heterogeneity in clinical manifestations and disease course.  There is 
evidence that B - and T-cells are critical to the development of the disease, 
and that T- cell-derived cytokines such as interleukin -21 (IL-21) are involved 
in the SLE- associated inflammatory pathological response.   
BOS161721 is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) triple mutation 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) intended to have an extended terminal elimination half-life (t
1/2) that selectively binds to and neutralizes IL-21, 
which acts on multiple cell types that drive  inflammation and autoimmunit y.  
In vivo, BOS161721 inhibits T-cell dependent antigen responses of B- cells 
and is being developed as a potential  treatment for adults with moderately to 
severely active SLE.    
No
nclinical studies have evaluated  the toxicity, pharmacodynamics (PD), 
toxicokinetics (TK), pharmacokinetics (PK) , and immunogenicity of 
BOS161721 administered intravenously (IV) and subcutaneously (SC).  The no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) in Cynomolgus monkeys were 
determined to be 100 mg/kg IV and 50 mg/kg SC, the highest doses tested.  No SC animals had injection reactions. 
In a Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) study, BOS161721 was 
administered IV and SC to healthy male and female adult subjects.  This 
double-blind, placebo- controlled study evaluated 8 ascending dose levels  
(1 [IV], 3 [SC], 10 [SC], 22 [IV], 30 [SC], 60 [SC], 120 [SC], or 240 [SC] mg) for safety, tolerability, PK, PD and immunogenicity.  Overall, 
there were no clinically significant safety or tolerability findings from this study, following an interim cut and review of the data at Day 90 postdose.  
Results from the Phase 1 SAD study informed  the dose regimens used for the 
multiple ascending doses (MAD) Phase 1b  study in this trial.  The MAD 
study will involve  3 cohorts.  The Phase 2 portion will be a proof of concept 
(POC) study , where dose selection will be based on the data monitoring 
committee ( DMC) and sponsor ’s assessment of safety, tolerability, 
immunogenicity , and PK and PD data from the MAD study of 30 patients 
treated with  BOS161721/placebo .  The purpose of the study is to establish 
safe and effective dosages for adult patient s with moderately to severely 
active SLE.

containing 6 patient s, where 5 of these patient s will receive BOS161721 
(active), and 1 will receive placeb o.  Cohorts 2 and 3 will each contain 
12 patient s, including 9 active and 3 placebo patient s.  Dose selection for each 
cohort is based on 90- day safety, tolerability, PK , and PD data review from 
the Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01) in healthy subjects.  Each of the 
3 doses (20, 60, and 120 mg) selected for the MAD study are projected not to 
exceed the mean exposure of that achieved in the SAD  study following the 
single [ADDRESS_381135] completed 2 weeks of follow- up after the 
second dose, Cohort 2 begins dosing (after a DMC evaluat es the safety and 
tolerability data from Cohort 1) .  Similarly, after [ADDRESS_381136] into the POC Phase 2 study .  This dose will not exceed doses 
tested during the MAD study.   For the POC study, approximately 156 additional patient s will be randomized 
to active or placebo groups in a 2:1 ratio.  As in the MAD study, each patient 
in the POC study may receive a total of 7 SC monthly doses on Days 0, 30, 
60, 90, 120, 150, and 180.   
A maximum daily dose of 30 mg/day of oral CS will be acceptable for 
eligibility for the study, however, daily dose must be tapered down to a maximum of 10  mg/day for at least 5 days prior to Day 0 (randomization 
day).  One  oral CS “burst ” for increased SLE disease activity may occur  
during the study between Day 0 and Day 60 .  Tapering of steroids during the 
course of the study will be encouraged and should be evaluated at all visits.  Tapering may occur after randomization except within 60 days of the primary 
(Day 210) and secondary ( Day 120) endpoint assessments.  Between Day  [ADDRESS_381137] be held

Statistical 
Considerations Below is a summary of the statistical methods.   Further details can be found in 
Section 8. 
Two analyses are planned:  1) an interim analysis to select the Phase 2 dose 
based on Phase 1 data, and 2) a final analysis at study completion.  Additionally, DMC safety analyses will be performed after each Phase [ADDRESS_381146] deviations (SD), 25th and 75th percentiles , 
minimum, median, and maximum.  Counts, m edians, 25th and 75th 
percentiles, and standard error will be presented for time- to-event data.  
All safety analyses will be performed using the safety analysis set (SS), 
defined as all patients who receive at least 1  dose of study treatment.  All 
efficacy analyses will be performed using the full analysis set (FAS), defined

Clinical Study  Protocol:  BOS161721- 02 
Protocol Date and Version:  2 1 March 201 8; V3.[ADDRESS_381147] efficacy analyses may 
also be performed on the per protocol (PP) s et. 
Binary efficacy endpoints, including the primary efficacy endpoint, will be 
assessed via Pearson’s chi -squared analysis.   
Continuous efficacy endpoints will be assessed via analy sis of variance 
(ANOVA) or analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)  when applicable, adjusting 
for the baseline value.  R epeated measures mixed model s may be performed 
to evaluate data collected at each visit and overall.   Time-to-event endpoints 
will be assessed via Kaplan -Meier methodology and treatment will be 
compared using the log- rank test.   
Adverse event data will be coded to system organ class and preferred term 
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA) .  The 
number and percentage of patients  experiencing any treatment -emergent AE, 
overall, and by [CONTACT_89794].  Treatment -emergent AEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_310206].   
Concomitant medications will be summarized, based on coded terms, using 
frequency and percentage of patients.  Observed values and changes from baseline in vital signs, ECG readings, and hematology and clinical chemistry parameters, will be summarized at each individual visit.

1.1 Indication 
BOS161721 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb), which binds to and inhibits 
interleukin -21 (IL-21) bioactivity, and is being develope d for the treatment of moderately to 
severely active systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) in adults.  
1.2 Background and Rationale 
1.2.1 Overview of the Disease State  
SLE is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that has variable manifestations in multiple 
organ systems and  follows a relapsing and remitting course .  The disease process includes  
abnormal immune responses mediated by [CONTACT_59627]-binding autoantibodies and immune complex deposition, giving rise to tissue damage often resulting in end organ disease and even mortality.  Survival of SLE has improved due to earlier detection, improved overall medical care,  and 
standardized  SLE treatment with corticosteroi ds (CS), immunosuppressants, and cytotox ic 
agents.
[ADDRESS_381156] common cause of death during later disease .2   
The reported prevalence of SLE in the [LOCATION_002] (US) is 20 to 70 cases  per 100,000 people.3  
More than 90% of cases of SLE occur in women, frequent ly starting at childbearing age.   
Women of color  are disproportionately affected by [CONTACT_113919].  This suggests multiple genetic and 
environmental factors are at play.  Accordingly, a multifactorial view of the 
immunopathogenesis of SLE suggests more than [ADDRESS_381157], including breach in central 
tolerance in the adaptive arm of the immune system, peripheral amplification of the autoimmune response by [CONTACT_310147], and local processes in the target organ that facilitate end-organ disease.

1.2.2 B
OS161721 Development  
[LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals is developi[INVESTIGATOR_310031]161721 for the treatment of SLE .  BOS161721 is a 
humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) mAb directed against human IL-21.   
Murine mAb 19E3, the progenitor of BOS161721, was generated using mouse hybridoma technology.  19E3 has subpi[INVESTIGATOR_36379] (pM) affinity to human IL-21 and was selected for its potent neutralization of IL-21 bioactivity.  BOS161721 was generated by [CONTACT_310148] 19E3 where its complementarity-determining regions were grafted onto a human IgG1 kappa backbone.  The fragment crystallizable (Fc) portion of BOS161721 contains a YTE (M252Y/S254T/T256E triple mutation) in the constant domain of the IgG1 heavy chain that was introduced into the parental molecule, 19E3, intended to prolong the in vivo terminal elimination half-life (t
1/2) of the mAb.5  Thus, BOS161721 retains sub-pM binding to IL-21 and prevents 
IL-21 from binding to the IL-21 receptor (IL-21R), inhibiting IL-21 bioactivity.

Clinical Study  Protocol:  BOS161721- 02 
Protocol Date and Version:  2 1 March 201 8; V3.0 
Confidential  Page 25 of 143 BOS161721 binds to human IL-21 and Cynomolgus monkey IL-21, which are highly 
homologous, and neutralizes the bioactivity of both.  BOS161721 is specific for IL-21 as it does 
not bind to or inhibit the other gamma- chain (γc) family  of cytokines , and acts to specifically 
neutralize the IL -21 pathw ay.  In in vitro  studies, BOS161721 inhibited downstream IL-21-
induced signaling, IL-21- induced plasma cell differentiation , and IL-21-induced natural killer 
(NK) cell activation.  In in vivo studies, BOS161721 significantly inhibited the T- cell dependent 
antibody response (TDAR) to immunization with a protein antigen as well as B- cell expansion 
following a second protein antigen immunization in Cynomolgus monkeys.    
[IP_ADDRESS] Interleukin -[ADDRESS_381158] cytokines in this family are critically important for both 
the maintenance and function of T- cell and B -cell responses.  IL-21 signals through a receptor 
complex consisting of its own private receptor, the IL-21R and γc.6,7  Engagement of the 
IL-21R/γc complex leads to the activation of several signaling pathways, including the Janus 
kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription, mitogen -activated protein kinase ( MAPK) 
and phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathways.[ADDRESS_381159] array of cell types, including B- cells, T-cells, NK -cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, 
as well as other hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells such as fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and 
intestinal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663].9,11  Activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 
(STAT3) via phosphorylation is critical in regulating human B- cell responses to IL -2112; 
phosphorylated STAT3  (pSTAT3) forms a homodimer, which translocates to the nucleus where 
it initiates transcription of the IL -21 gene, forming an autocrine loop for IL-21 production via 
STAT3 phosphorylation.13  In addition, IL-21 has been shown to upregulate expression of its 
own receptor14 and induces an autocrine feedback loop.15 
IL-21 modulates various aspects of immune function.  It promotes cluster of differentiation 4 
(CD4+) T-cell differentiation and promotes the generation of T- helper (Th)1716 and T-follicular 
helper (Tfh) cells.15,17  In mice, IL -21 has been shown to regulate the balance between Th17 and 
regulatory T- cell (Treg), in that it increases Th17, while inhibiting  Treg differentiation.[ADDRESS_381160] disease induced by [CONTACT_74934] T- cells.20  IL-21 upregulates CD8+ 
T-cell and NK -cell expansion and cytolytic activity by [CONTACT_310149] B and perforin.21,22  
IL-21 also has been reported to increase granzyme B in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B- cells 
resulting in  inhibition of T- cell responses.23,24  IL-21 also has a variety of effects on 
nonhematopoietic cells, such as stromal cells and induces inflammation through matrix metalloproteinase release by [CONTACT_310207].
25 
One principal non-redundant role of IL-21 is the promotion of B- cell activ ation, differentiation , 
or death during humoral immune responses.14  Furthermore, increased IL-21 production is 
characteristic of several autoimmune diseases and is likely to contribute to autoantibody production as well as pathologic features of autoimmune disease.
 26  The critical role of IL -21 in 
promoting humoral and other immune responses makes it an important focus of potential

driving the autoantibody production through its role in plasma cell differentiation.  Importantly, Tfh cell populations are expanded in patient s with autoimmune diseases such as lupus, bullous 
pemphigoid, r heumatoid arthritis  (RA) and primary Sjögren’s syndrome ( pSS) and have been 
reported to correlate with IL -[ADDRESS_381161] elevated IL -21 
plasma levels that correlate with the severity of the disease.  Recently, genome- wide association 
studies (GWAS) have provided convincing evidence that the chromosomal 4q 27 region harbors the IL-21 genes and is associated with chronic inflammatory disorders, including SLE.

[IP_ADDRESS] Preclinical Studies 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of BOS161721 were characterized following single-dose intravenous (IV) administration of BOS161721 (0.01 to 30 mg/kg) in male Cynomolgus monkeys or repeat, every 2 weeks IV ad ministration (15 to 100 mg/kg) and subcutaneous (SC) administration 
(50 mg/kg) in male and female Cynomolgus monkeys.  Systemic exposure was approximately 
dose-proportional within the tested dose range.  SC bioavailability was determined to be 64.3%.  
 
 
Two single-dose (IV) non-good laboratory practice (GLP) studies conducted in Cynomolgus monkeys evaluated the toxicity, pharmacodynamics (PD), toxicokinetics (TK), and immunogenicity of BOS161721.  Following a single IV administration (slow bolus), there were no BOS161721- related adverse changes, resulting in a no -observed-adverse-effect-level 
(NOAEL) value of 30  mg/kg, the highest dose tested among 2 studies.   
 
In a repeat-dose GLP toxicology study in Cynomolgus monkeys, BOS161721 was administered 
every 2 weeks by [CONTACT_310152] (50 mg/kg) administration for 3  months (a total of 7 doses).

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Studies  
BOS161721-01 was a double-blind, Phase 1, single ascending dose (SAD) study to assess the 
safety, PK , and PD of BOS161721 in healthy subjects.  The primary objective of the study was 
to characterize the safety and tolerability of IV and SC SADs of BOS161721 in an otherwise 
healthy subject population without concomitant illnesses, immune abnormalities, or concomitant 
medications.  Secondary objectives included characterization of the PK and immunogenicity of 
BOS161721, and exploratory objectives included the evaluation of the effect of BOS161721 on TDAR to keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( KLH) (primary and secondary immunizations) in healthy 
subjects, the effects of BOS161721 on plasma levels of  IL-21 (free and bound), and the 
evaluation of the effect of BOS161721 on IL-21 gene expression (via gene signature) in blood.  
This study consist ed of 8 cohorts.  Subjects were randomized in a 3:1 ratio (BOS161721: 
placebo) and received either a single dose of BOS161721 (1 [IV] , 3 [SC], 10 [SC], 22 [IV], 
30 [SC], 60 [SC], 120 [SC], or 240 [SC]  mg) or placebo , with safety follow -up.  For the first 
cohort, after the first 2  subjects were dosed (1 active and 1  placebo), there was a minimum gap of 
[ADDRESS_381162] 7  days of safety and tolerability data by [CONTACT_310153] 
(SDMT).   
Blood samples were collected at every in -house study visit for BOS161721 concentration 
determinations.  Blood samples were also collected for determination of IL-21 plasma  levels 
(free and total).  Safety was assessed based on the occurrence of treatment -emergent AEs, 
hepatic function abnormality,  and acute and delayed hypersensitivity reactions.  Other safety 
variables included electrocardiograms ( ECGs), vital signs (blood pressure [BP], heart rate, and 
temperature), safety laboratory assessments, blood sampling for ADAs, total IgG and 
immunoglobulin M ( IgM) levels, CD4+ count, and full and targeted physical examinations.   
Overall, there were no clinically significant findings from this study, following an interim cut and review of the data at Day 90 postdose.  Adverse event s reported as related to  the study drug, 
particularly infections, were expected for the compound, and there were no clinically relevant changes in laboratory  and ECG results or vital signs.  There was 1 serious adverse event ( SAE; 
death due to pulmonary embolism ) that occurred 12 7 days after a single administration of 
240 mg SC dose of BOS161721.  The causality of this single SAE was not attributed to study drug and further information can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.  PK data from the SAD 
study demonstrates BOS161721 has an extended t
1/2 (provisional single dose data indicates this 
to be approximately 42-46 days) which supports evaluation of monthly dosing.

reviews will be conducted periodically throughout the study as described in the DMC charter.  
With the agreement of the DMC and sponsor, this schedule may be modified depending on the 
rate of patient  accrual.  Additional details can be found in the DMC Charter. 
The benefit of participation for all patients in this study is close monitoring of their medical 
condition and safety of their treatment.  Those randomized to the active treatment arm may potentially experience improvement in their  SLE disease.  Those randomized to the placebo (in 
combination with standard of care) arm are not expected to obtain any additional benefit, beyond those of their background treatment, though close monitoring of their medical condition and safety may itself be associat ed with improving their SLE .   
1.2.5 Potential Risks  
Potential risks based on the m echanism of action of BOS161721 include inf ections, risks 
associated with the administration of a ny foreign protein or biolog ic agent, including injection 
site reaction, anaphy laxis, serious allerg ic reaction,  and development of AD As.  ADAs  could 
result in immune complex disea se (with mani festations su ch as arthralgias, serum-sickness, and 
vasculitis), autoimmunity, or altered BOS161721 leve ls or activity.  Further details can be found

Confidential  Page 30 of 143 in the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for BOS161721, which contains comprehensive 
toxicology, preclinical and clinical information on BOS161721. 
Two investigational drug products are considered to be in the same pharma cological class as 
BOS161721 based on interruption of signaling through the IL-[ADDRESS_381168].  No potential risk generalizable across the class has been observed with these investigational products.  Based on the clinical Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721- 01), AEs reported as related to 
the study drug, particularly infections (flu -like symptoms, etc), were expected for the compound, 
and there were no clinically relevant changes in laboratory and ECG results or vital signs.  
The majority of IgG elimination  occurs via intracellular catabolism, following fluid -phase or 
receptor-mediated endocytosis.  This type of endocytosis and elimination is a form of 
target-mediated disposition where the interaction of the drug and its pharmacological target 
(eg, a target receptor) serves as a significant contributor to the kinetics of antibody distribution 
and elimination.  Renal elimination, which is a primary pathway of clearance of small- molecule 
drugs, is relatively unimportant for IgG, as its large size prevents effic ient filtration through the 
glomerulus.  Secretion into the bile is an important pathway of elimination of IgA antibodies, but 
this route is not a significant contributor to the elimination of IgG antibodies.  Thus, risk to renal and hepatic systems due to  metabolism of BOS161721 is low.

[IP_ADDRESS] Anaphylaxis and Serious Allergic Reactions  
As with the administration of any foreign protein and/or other biological agents, acute hypersensitivity reactions, including acute anaphylactic/hypersensitivity, severe allergic,  and 
anaphylactoid reactions may follow infusion of mAbs and can be caused by [CONTACT_62535].  These acute hypersensitivity reactions may be severe and result in death.  
Anaphylaxis will be defined according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (NIAID/FAAN) criteria,
34 and are discussed in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].1. 
Based on the limited Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), anaphylaxis and serious allergic 
reactions in subjects who received BOS161721 was not observed.   
Patients with a known history of allergy or severe hypersensitivity reaction to any component of 
BOS161721 formulation or pa tients with a history of anaphylaxis to any other biological therapy 
such as mAbs will be excluded from studies with BOS161721.  In addition, appropriate drugs and medical equipment to treat acute hypotensive, bronchoconstrictive, or anaphylactic reactions will be immediately available at the unit and study personnel will be trained to recognize and treat these reactions.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Injection Site Reactions  
In a repeat -dose GLP toxicology study in Cynomolgus monkeys, BOS161721 was administered 
every 2 weeks by [CONTACT_310268] S C (50 mg/kg) for 3  months (a total of 7 doses); no SC animals had 
injection reactions.

Confidential  Page 31 of 143 Based on the Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), incidence of injection site reactions in 
subjects who received BOS161721 was similar to placebo .   
Patients will be monitored for local injection site reactions in this study.  See Section 6.2.7.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Immune Complex Disease  
The potential risk of immune complex disease for BOS161721 is theoretical, based on the known risks associated with mAbs.  The administration of a mAb can result in the formation of ADAs.  Administration of the mAb in the presence of ADA may result in the formation of circulating antibody-antigen complexes potentially resulting in altered BOS161721 levels or activity or deposition of the complexes in microvasculature.  Complement is frequently involved in the latter setting, and the breakdown products of complement attract polymorphonuclear leukocytes to the site of deposition where they can provoke local tissue damage through specific or 
nonspecific release of enzymes.  Two of the more common end-organ targets are the blood vessels (vasculitis) and kidney (nephritis).  These clinical manifestations represent immune complex disease or Type III hypersensitivity.  Although BOS161721 is a humanized mAb, ADAs may develop; however, the likelihood of occurrence of immune complex disease with BOS161721 is low.  The findings of immune complex disease are typi[INVESTIGATOR_310078]- antigen complexes are cleared from the body . 
Based on the limited Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), immune complex disease in subjects 
who received BOS161721 was not observed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Infections  
BOS161721 is expected to diminish the activity of T -cell, B-cell and NK -cell lines.  Like other 
medications modulating immune response, BOS161721 may increase the potential risk for 
infection, including serious infections.  IL-21 produced by [CONTACT_398]4+ Th cells is required to sustain the anti-viral function of CD8+ T-cells against chronic viral infections.  Nonclinical evidence 
suggests that the risk of chronic viral infection recurrence or increased severity may occur with IL-21 inhibition.
35 
These conditions will be fully characterized with clinical descriptions and routine laboratory and/or specialty testing and treated where indicated with appropriate local standard of care.  
Patients with a history of opportunistic infection, including recurrent or severe disseminated 
herpes zoster or disseminated herpes simplex  within the last 3 years , or any other underlying 
pathology predisposing to serious infection, are excluded from studies with BOS161721 (for further details please refer to the current IB for BOS161721). 
Patients will be assessed for hepatitis B, and C, and HIV-1/[ADDRESS_381169] been observed in immunosuppressed liver transplant and human immunodeficiency virus patients.

SAD study (BOS161721-01), and will be excluded from the proposed MAD/POC studies.  Patients exposed to investigational product who develop diarrhea during the course of the study should immediately undergo an assessment for opportunistic infection including stool for ova and parasites and stool examination for cryptosporidium.  Positive cryptosporidium in stool sample at screening is an exclusion.  Treatment by [CONTACT_310269] e indicated should be 
guided by [CONTACT_310270]. 
Based on the limited Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), infections in subjects who received 
BOS161721 was not observed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Malignancy 
The stimulatory effect of IL -21 on NK cells and CD8+ T -cells suggests the cytokine may have 
anti-tumor activity.  Nonclinical studies have demonstrated significant anti- tumor effects of 
IL-21 in a number of tumor models.  IL- 21 therapy of human metastatic melanoma and renal cell 
carcinoma has demonstrated POC with significant increases in levels of perforin, granzyme B, 
and interferon gamma (IFNγ) expression in CD8+ T- cells and NK  T-cells.  Clinical response has 
been limited in these generally unmanageable diseases.  
The impact of treatment with  anti-IL-21 therapy on the development or growth of malignancies 
is not known; however, as with other immunomodulatory biologic agents, treatment with 
BOS161721 may result in an increase in the risk of malignancies.  NK cell suppression by [CONTACT_8668]-[ADDRESS_381171] 5 years, with the ex ception 
of non-melanoma skin cancer or cervical cancer in situ treated with apparent suc cess with 
curative the rapy, are excluded from the study. 
Based on the limited Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), malignancy in subjects who received 
BOS161721 was not observed.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatic Function Abnormality  
There is no substantial evidence suggesting BOS161721 is associated with liver function 
abnormality.  However, as a precaution, patients with a history of abnormal alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT)  and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or bilirubin at screening 
(ALT/AST > 2 × upper limit of normal [ ULN]; total bilirubin >  1.5 × [ULN] and judged by [CONTACT_119278]) were excluded from the Phase 1 SAD study 
(BOS161721-01), and will be excluded from the MAD study.  Patients with a positive hepatitis B or C test or a history of alcohol dependence will also be excluded. 
Based on the limited Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), hepatic function abnormality in 
subjects who received BOS161721 was not observed.

Confidential  Page 33 of 143 [IP_ADDRESS] Failure of Vaccination 
IL-21 is a key cytokine in development of B- cells into immunoglobulin- secreting plasma cells.  
Abnormal signaling through the IL-21R/Janus Kinase (JAK)3/signal transducer and activator of 
transcription ( STAT3) pathway leads to defective humoral immune responses to both 
T-dependent and T-independent antigens and impairs the establishment of long- lasting B-cell 
memory.  Abnormal signaling through the pathway has been related to decreased specific antibody responses following vaccination, and to increased susceptibility to encapsulated bacterial infections.
[ADDRESS_381172] of BOS161721 was evaluated in in vivo single dose studies in Cynomolgus monkey in which the animals received vaccination to T -cell dependent KLH antigen to stimulate a TDAR.  
These in vivo studies demonstrated that BOS161721 significantly inhibited B- cell proliferation 
and IgG antibody responses to the KLH protein antigen; however, it is worth noting that 
BOS161721 administration did not produce an y remarkable changes in anti -KLH antibody data 
for IgM, IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4 or anti-tetanus toxoid ( TT) antibody data for IgM, IgG, IgG1, or 
IgE during the dosing phase in the same study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Potential for Drug -Drug Interactions  
Drug-drug interactions were no t evaluated in the Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), which 
included only healthy adult subjects.  Use of prescription medications (with the exceptions of 
oral contraceptives), and over -the-counter (OTC) treatments including herbal supplements such 
as St John’s Wort (except multivitamins), in the 2 weeks prior to screening was prohibited in the 
SAD study .   
See Section 4.5 for other specific exclusion criteria which support lowered risk of interactions, 
and Section 4.6.1 for corticosteroid ( CS) dosing.  In addition, Section  [IP_ADDRESS] describes 
considerations for hepatic function for this study.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Potential Risk to Fetal Development 
No data on preclinical reproductive toxicity are available at the time of this study.

3.1 Study Design 
This is a Phase 1b/[ADDRESS_381174] of 2  double-blinded studies :  MAD Phase 1b and POC Phase 2.  Patients 
may receive a total of 7 SC monthly doses of study drug on Days 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 
180, followed by [CONTACT_211697] -up visits at Days 210, 240, and 270.     
SLE disease activity assessment dat a will be centrally reviewed by [CONTACT_310211].   The scope 
of responsibility include s, but is not limited to, review and confirmation of “A” and “B” BILAG 
system organ disease, confirmation of clinical components of the SLEDAI- 2K score at screening  
and during the study, and cross-validation of the instruments used in this study to assess the 
disease being studied.  Further details on the content and methods of data reports by [CONTACT_310271] .   
3.1.[ADDRESS_381175] of 3 cohorts:  
• Cohort 1 (20  mg SC) will include 6 patients

study.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Escalation for the MAD Study   
The MAD study design is staggered , where after the [ADDRESS_381176] completed 2 weeks of follow-up after the second dose, Cohort 2 begins dosing (after 
DMC evaluation of the safety and tolerability data from Cohort 1) .  Similarly, after  [ADDRESS_381177] received 2  doses and ha ve completed 2 weeks of follow- up after the 
second dose, Cohort 3 begins dosing after DMC evaluation of the safety and tolerability data from Cohorts 1 and 2.  Each cohort will continue at their assigned dose level through the ir 
respective 6-month treatment period s (See Study Schematic, Section 3.1).  If patients discontinue 
the study in a cohort prior to adequate safety follow-up, he/she may  be replaced.  
Criteria for dose escalation are further described in the DMC Charter.  See Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
additional details  about DLTs.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Limiting T oxicity (DLT)  
Severity of adverse events will be graded according to National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Even ts (NCI CTCAE ) version 4.03.  For the purpose of dose 
escalation, any of the following AEs occurring after study drug administration, which are attributable to the study drug, will be considered DLTs: 
Hematologic: 
• Grade 4 neutropenia 
• Grade 3 neutropenic infection  
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia 
Non-Hematologic:  
• Grade [ADDRESS_381178] medical therapy 
(eg, anti-emetics, anti -diarrheals)  
• Drug-induced liver injury ([ DILI], Hy’s Law), as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS].3 
Investigators should always manage their patients according to their medical judgment which 
may include interruption of study drug based on the particular clinical circumstances.

During scheduled meetings, the DMC will review relevant study data for safety or benefit- risk 
concern.  During the MAD study, t he DMC may provide the following recommendation s to the 
sponsor: 
• Expanding a cohort at a specific dosing level, or repeating a lower dose in a subsequent 
cohort 
• Continuing a dose level for a given cohort 
• Escalating a dose level  for a subsequent cohort 
• Termination of current or previous cohort(s) 
Further dosing in a given cohort will be halted if [ADDRESS_381179] int o the POC Phase 2 study.  This 
POC dose decision will be based on evaluation of the PK, safety (inclusive of dose- limiting 
toxicity [DLT]), and tolerability data (and available PD/biomarker data) from Cohorts 1, 2, and 3; this dose will not exceed doses te sted during the MAD study.  The DMC will be reviewing all 
relevant data from Cohorts 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_381180] patient in Cohort 3 completes the Day 44 visit ( 2 weeks after dose 2 ).  Details are provided in the DMC Charter.   
3.1.2 POC Phase 2 Study 
[IP_ADDRESS] BOS161721 Dose  
The optimal dose evaluation is chosen based on MAD Phase 1b safety, tolerability, 
immunogenicity, and PK and PD data.  The  dose will be communicated by a letter to site 
investigator s participating in  the POC Phase 2 study , and to the IRB/I EC. 
[IP_ADDRESS] POC Study Design 
For the POC study, approximately  156 additional patient s will be randomized to active or 
placebo groups in a 2:1  ratio.   
As in the MAD study , each patient  in the POC study may receive a total of 7 SC monthly doses 
of study drug on Days 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180.  Assessments will be completed according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 3.4).  Dose selection will be based on the 
DMC and sponsor’s assessment of safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and PK and PD data from the MAD study of 30 patients treated with BOS161721/placebo. 
DMC safety reviews will be conducted periodically throughout the study as described in the 
DMC charter .

Eligible patients  will be assigned to the study phase which is active at time of enrollment.  
Similarly, patients  in the Phase 1 MAD will be assigned to the cohort which is active.  Each 
patient will be assigned a unique randomization number which will not be reused.   
All patients, investigators, and study team participants will be blinded to treatment assignment.  
An independent biostatistician not otherwise involved on the study will be unblinded and prepare 
materials for the  interim analysis ( IA) and the DMC safety revi ews.  The DMC will review 
unblinded data during safety reviews and the IA.  A limited team at [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals will 
review unblinded results from the Phase 1b MAD portion during the IA to determine the dose that will be used for the Phase 2 POC portion of the study.  Details regarding maintenance of the 
blinding and content of data reviews will be described in the DMC charter or related study 
documentation.

anti-malarial, corticosteroid, and/or biologic agent) will be recorded  for the 48 weeks prior to 
screening in the eCRF . 
4.6.1 Oral Corticosteroid Dose 
Prior to randomization, oral CSs (prednisone or prednisone equivalent), may be used in accordanc e with the investigator’s clinical judgment and best standard of care.  See 
APPENDIX 3 for examples of equivalents. 
A maximum daily dose of 30 mg/day of oral CS will be acceptable for eligibility for the study, 
however, the daily dose must be tapered down to a maximum of 10 mg/day for at least 5  days 
prior to Day 0 (randomization day). 
After Day 0 (after initiation of study therapy) , no up-titration above 10 mg/day is allowed  except 
for up to [ADDRESS_381202] for increased disease activity .  
Tapering of steroids during the course of the study will be encouraged and should be evaluated at 
all visits.  
• Once a patient has received the first dose of study drug, predn isone (or prednisone 
equivalent) may be tapered down at the discretion of the investigator 
o Tapering is allowed after randomization except within 60 days of the primary ( Day 210) 
and secondary (Day 120) endpoint assessments.  Between Day  [ADDRESS_381203] be held constant. 
A maximum of 1 oral CS “burst” for increased SLE disease activity will be allowed during the 
study between Day 0 and Day 60, according to the following:   
• An oral CS “burst” between  Day 0 and Day 60; (an increase of ≤ 40 mg/day of prednisone or 
equivalent), which must be tapered down to a maximum of 10  mg/day within 2 weeks of 
initiation of the “burst”  
o Alternatively, a single intramuscular (IM) dose of methylprednisolone (40 mg or 
equivalent ) is permitted  
o The course of the oral CS “burst” is not permitted to extend beyond D ay 60 
Treatment with inhalational CS therapy (eg, for asthma), or by [CONTACT_310247], is allowed.  Other 
concomitant medications for SLE need to be taken at stable doses as  per the inclusion criteria

At a minimum, patients must agree to the use of 1 method of highly effective contraception from 
the following: 
• Male condoms with spermicide 
• Hormonal methods of contraception including combined oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], vaginal ring, injectables, implants, and intrauterine devices (IUDs) such as Mirena
® by [CONTACT_310248] a male patient’s WOCBP partner.  Women who are partner of men who are patients participating in the study may use hormone-based contraceptives as 1 of the 
acceptable methods of contraception since they will not be receiving study drug. 
• IUDs, such as ParaGard® 
• Vasectomy  
• Complete abstinence, defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual intercourse, is an acceptable form of contraception.  Women who are abstinent while participating in the study must continue to have pregnancy tests.  Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the event that the patient chooses to forego complete abstinence.  
Azoospermic men and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt from contraceptive requirements.  However, they must still undergo pregnancy testing. 
4.8 Deviation from Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria 
Deviation from the inclusion or exclusion criteria will not be allowed.  If deviation of inclusion/exclusion criteria is discovered after randomization, the investigator should contact [CONTACT_310168].  A dec ision will be made whether to allow a patient continue or

5.5 Premature Discontinuation  
While patients are encouraged to complete all study evaluations, they may withdraw from the 
study at any time and for any reason.  Every effort will be made to determine why any patient  
withdraws from the study prematurely.  If the patient is unreachable by [CONTACT_756], a registered 
letter, at the minimum, should be sent to the patient requesting him/her to contact [CONTACT_3652].  
All patients who withdraw from the study with an ongoing AE or SAE must be followed until 
the end of study or until the event is resolved or deemed  stable, respectively .   
If a patient withdraws prematurely after dosing, an end of treatment (EO T) visit should be 
performed (Day 180 ) and a last follow -up visit 90 days after dosing  should be scheduled 
(Day 270).  Safety follow -up visit procedures based on the Schedule of Assessments ( see 
Section 5.4). 
Patient participation may be terminated prior to completing the study and the reason record ed as 
follows: 
• AE/SAE 
• Protocol deviation 
• Lost to follow-up 
• Patient withdraws consent at their own request 
• Investigator decision  
• Decision by [CONTACT_3211] (other than AE/SAE, protocol deviation, or lost to follow-up) 
Withdrawn patients may be replaced after discu ssion between the investigator or designee and 
sponsor.

6.2 Safety Assessments 
6.2.1 Laboratory Assessments 
Laboratory tests will be performed at times defined in the Schedule of Assessments (Section 3.4).  Patient eligibility will be determined based on these tests at screening.  
Unscheduled clinical labs may be obtained at any time during the study to assess any perceived safety concerns.  
A central laboratory will be used  (with the exception of urine pregnancy tests and stool analysis) 
to ensure accuracy and consistency in test results.  The central laboratory will transmit all results for protocol tests, scheduled and unscheduled, to the clinical data base.  Laboratory/analyte 
results that could unblind the study (ie, biomarker results) will not be reported to investigative sites.  Urinalysis will be performed on midstream, clean catch specimen s.  Some biomarkers 
listed above will not be drawn at some sites due to geographical logistical challenges.  See the laboratory manual for details.  
Endpoint analyses will be based on changes from baseline assessments at Days 120 and 210.

6.2.2 Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence experienced by a study patient, whether 
or not considered drug related by [CONTACT_2026] i nvestigator.    
AEs are unfavorable changes in a general condition, subjective or objective signs or symptoms, worsening of pre- existing concomitant disease, and clinically significant abnormality  in 
laboratory parameters observed in a patient  in the course of a clinical study.   
Non-serious SLE manifestations  or abnormal laboratory re sults related to SLE  disease activity  
would not be recorded as AEs unless they meet the definition for SAEs ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Recording of Adverse Events  
AEs should be collected and recorded for each patient  from the date of the first dose of study 
drug until the end of their participation in the study, including the safety follow up period.   
AEs may be volunteered spontaneously by [CONTACT_4694] , or discovered by [CONTACT_14543], nonleading question such as ‘How have you 
been feeling since you were last asked?’   All AEs and any required remedial action will be 
recorded on the Adverse Events e CRF and Safety Adverse Event Form.  The details of the AE, 
date of AE onset (and time, if known), date of AE outcome (and time, if known), and action taken for the AE will b e documented together with the principal investigator’s assessment of the 
seriousness of the AE and causal relationship to the study drug and/or the study procedure. 
All AEs should be recorded individually, using diagnostic terms where possible.   If the diagnosis 
is not established, individual symptoms may be reported.  The AEs will subsequently be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).    
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity of Adverse Events  
Each AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_310132] (NCI CTCAE), version 4.03 criteria.
 41  
When changes in the severity (grade) of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the event should be noted for that day.  Any change in severity of signs and symptoms over a number of days will be captured by [CONTACT_44745] a new AE, with the amended severity grade and the date (and time, if known) of the change.

Protocol Date and Version:  2 1 March 201 8; V3.0 
Confidential  Page 67 of 143 [IP_ADDRESS] Causality of Adverse Events  
The principal invest igator will assess the causal  relationship between BOS161721 or placebo and 
the AE.  One of the following categories (Table 4) should be selected bas ed on medical 
judgment, considering the definitions below and all contributing factors. 
Table 4. Causality Definitions  
Related A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurs in a plausible time 
relationship to treatment administration and which concurrent disease or other 
drugs or chemicals cannot explain.  The response to withdrawal of the treatment (dechallenge
a) should be clinically plausible.  The event must be definitive 
pharmacologically or phenomenologica lly, using a satisfactory rechallengeb 
procedure if necessary.  
Unrelated  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no temporal 
relationship with treatment administration.  May have negative dechallenge and rechallenge information.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_261969] 
(eg, concomitant disease, environmental factors, or other drugs or chemicals).  
a Dechallenge:  Upon discontinuation of a drug suspected of causing an AE, the symptoms of the AE disappear 
partially or c ompletely, within a reasonable time from drug discontinuation  (positive dechallenge), or the 
symptoms continue despi[INVESTIGATOR_211386] (negative dechallenge).  Note that there are exceptions 
when an AE does not disappear upon discon tinuation of the drug, yet drug relatedness clearly exists (for 
example, as in bone marrow suppression, fixed drug eruptions, or tardive dyskinesia).  
b Rechallenge:   Upon re-administration of a drug suspected of causing an AE in a specific patient in the past, 
the AE recurs upon exposure (positive rechall enge), or the AE does not recur  (negative rechallenge).  
An unexpected adverse drug event is any adverse drug event for which the specificity or severity 
is not consistent with the current IP. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Seriousness  of Adverse Events  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening; this means that the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it 
does not mean that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_211384] 
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Is another important medical event (see below)  
Important medical events that do not result in death, are not life threatening, or do not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.   Examples of such events are:

• Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Development of drug dependency or drug abuse 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310085] 
(eg, elective surgery for a pre-existing condition that has not worsened) need not be considered SAEs.  If anything untoward is reported during the procedure, that occurrence must be reported 
as an AE, either 'serious' or 'nonserious' according to the usual criteria. 
Suspected unexpected  serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are AEs that are associated with the 
use of the drug and are serious and unexpected.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events of Special Interest  
AEs of special interest in this study include the following:

[IP_ADDRESS].1 Anaphylaxis and  Serious Allergic Reactions  
Anaphylaxis will be defined according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (NIAID/FAAN) criteria.
42  In the event of 
anaphylactic reaction or severe/serious hypersensitivity/allergic reaction, the patient must 
discontinue IP and emergency resuscitation measures i mplemented.  In case of other mild to 
moderate hypersensitivity reaction, depending on the severity, the investigator may manage in accordance with the standard -of-care. 
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria is fulfilled: 
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal 
tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus, or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula) and at 
least 1 of the following: 
a. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] [PEF], hypoxemia) 
b. Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia 
[collapse], syncope, incontinence)

3. Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): 
a. Systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from the 
patient’s baseline  
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Injection Site Reactions  
Injection site reactions are to be captured and reported as AEs.  These will include Grades  2 to 5 
injection site erythema, pain, and induration (see APPENDIX 6).  The investigator should 
provide a clear description of the observed or reported AE including location and severity.  All concomitant treatments used to treat injection site reactions should be recorded and captured in the eCRF, together with the AE of injection site reactions.   
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_381222] and/or ALT levels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of DILI, and as potential Hy’s Law cases, and should always be considered important medical events.   If symptoms compatible with DILI precede knowledge of 
serum chemical test abnormalities, liver enzyme measurements should be made immediately, regardless of when the next visit or monitoring interval is scheduled.  In some cases, symptoms 
may be an early sign of injury and although typi[INVESTIGATOR_310038], they may indicate a need for prompt serum testing.   An increase in liver enzymes 
should be confirmed by a repeated test within [ADDRESS_381223] be reported as SAEs (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 for reporting details).  
Potential DILI is defined as: 
1. ALT or AST elevation > 3 × ULN  
AND

Confidential  Page 70 of 143 2. Total bilirubin > 2 × ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase) 
AND 
3. No other immediately apparent possible causes of A LT or AST elevation and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre- existing chronic or acute 
liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic 
The patient  should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, include 
laboratory tests, detailed history , and physical assessment.  In addition to repeating 
measurements of AST and ALT, laboratory tests should include albumin, CK , total bilirubin, 
direct and indirect bilirubin, GGT , prothrombin time (PT)/International Normalized Ratio (INR), 
and alkaline phosphatase.  A detailed history, including relevant information, such as review of 
ethanol, acetaminophen, recreational drug and supplement consumption, family history, occupational exposure, sexual history, travel history, history of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) may be warranted.  All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria 
defined above, with no other cause for liver function test (LFT) abnormalities identified at the time should be considered potential Hy’s Law cases irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the abnormal LFTs.  Such potential Hy’s Law cases should be reported as SAEs.  
Study drug discontinuation is considered if there is marked serum AST or ALT elevation or evidence of functional impairment ( as indicated by [CONTACT_310274], which represent 
substantial liver injury) that is related to study drug .
  Discontinuation of treatment should be 
considered if: 
• ALT or AST > 8 × ULN  
• ALT or AST > 5× ULN for more than [ADDRESS_381224] occur if:  
• ALT or AST >3 × ULN and (total bilirubin  > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5) 
• ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (> 5%)

the study.  If a patient develops diarrhea during the study a stool sample must be provided to test for ova, parasites, and cryptosporidium.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of Adverse Events  
AE reporting  will be carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations, including 
regulatory agency and IRB reporting requirements.   
Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for an SAE.  If an SAE occurs, 
expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate, and is further outlined in  Section [IP_ADDRESS].2. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Reporting of Pregnancy  
As information is available, a pregnancy diagnosed during the study will be reported within 24 hours to the sponsor via the Pregnancy Notification and Outcome Form, including pregnancy in female patients who received study drug and female partners of male study patients who 
received study drug .  The pregnancy should be followed to term and/or outcome and this 
outcome should also be reported to the sponsor via the Pregnancy Notification and Outcome 
Form.  Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE or SAE unless there is complication.  
In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by [CONTACT_61321] (unless pre- procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and 
the findings are reported). 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an  AE or SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a live 
born, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator 
should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs. 
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows:  
• Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion 
• Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_381226].

This timeframe also applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAE reports as well as to the initial and follow-up reporting of exposure during pregnancy and exposure via breastfeeding cases.  In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE immediately (eg, if an outpatient study patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the AE.  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310086].  All SAEs will be recorded from the time of first dose 
of study drug through the safety follow-up period (up to Day 270).  SAEs  occurring after the

As a minimum requirement, the initial notification should provide the following information: 
• Study number 
• Patient number 
• Details of the SAE (verbatim details are sufficient for immediate notification)  
• Criterion for classification as ‘serious’  
• Causality assessment ( which may be updated in a follow-up report when sufficient 
information is available to make this classification)  
Initial reports of SAEs must be followed later with detailed descriptions, including clear 
photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_211387] (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73529], consultant reports, autopsy reports, etc), with the study patient ’s personal identifier s removed.  All relevant information

up of malignancy. 
6.2.3 Vital Signs  
Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature) will be assessed as specified in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Section 3.4).  Vital signs will be assessed on Day  0 at predose and at 
1 and 2 hours postdose, as well as on each of the scheduled visit days  during the study 
(excluding PK- only site visits) .  Supi[INVESTIGATOR_310133]  ≥ 5 minutes.   When the timing of these measurement s 
coincides with a blood collection, vital signs should be obtained prior to the time of the blood 
collection.  
6.2.4 12-Lead Electrocardiograms  
ECG will be assessed as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 3.4).  ECG recording 
will initiate after the patient  has been supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] [ADDRESS_381230] leads and a Lead II rhythm strip on the bottom of the 
tracing.  The ECG will be recorded at a paper speed of 25  mm/second.  The follow ing ECG 
parameters will be collected:  PR interval, QRS interval, RR interval, QT interval, and 
QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF). 
All ECGs must be evaluated by a qualified physician or qualified designee for the presence of abnormalities and will be captured ele ctronically and retained for future evaluation if required, 
up to the time of the clinical study report ( CSR) completion . 
6.2.5 Physical Examinations

the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 3.4).  It includes evaluation of patient  complaints and SL E 
disease-related issues , and will exclude the genitourinary system. 
6.2.6 C-SSRS 
The C-SSRS is a low-burden measure of the spectrum of suicidal ideation and behavior that wa s 
developed by [CONTACT_174273] U niversity researchers for the National Institute of Mental Health 
Treatment of Adolescent Suicide Attempters Study to assess severity and track suicidal events 
through any treatment.  It is a clinical interview providing a summary of both ideation and behavior that can be administered during any evaluation or risk assessment to identify the level  
and type of suicidality present.  The C-SSRS can also be used during treatment to monitor for clinical worsening.
43 
The C-SSRS evaluation will be performed as specified in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Section 3.4).  Patients with recent (within the past 12 months) or active suicidal ideation or 
behavior based on patient responding “yes” to question 3, 4, or [ADDRESS_381231] responses to the C- SSRS reviewed in detail to assess patient 
risk, and appropriate consultative mental health services will be provided. 
6.2.7 Injection Site Reactions  
Patients will be monitored for local injection site reactions  as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Section 3.4).  Local injection site reactions will be assessed at [ADDRESS_381232] (s ee Section [IP_ADDRESS].3). 
6.2.8 Immunogenicity  
The serum samples to measure the presence of ADA will be col lected as specified in the 
Schedule of Assessments (Section 3.4).  Blood samples (4 mL) to provide approximately 1.[ADDRESS_381233] dose, if a patient tests positive in the validated confirmatory ADA assay, the 
sample from this patient will be further analyzed in the neutralizing antibody (nAb) assay.

All efficacy assessments will be performed at times defined in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Section 3.4). 
6.3.1 SLEDAI-2K 
The SLEDAI -2K is a validated instrument that measures disease activity in SLE patients at the 
time of the visit and in the previous 30 days.  It is a global index and includes 24 clinical and laboratory variables that are weighted by [CONTACT_310181], but not b y severity.  The total 
score falls between 0 and 105, with higher scores representing increased disease activity.  The SLEDAI-2K has been shown to be a valid and reliable disease activity measure in multiple 
patient groups.  A SLEDAI -2K of 6 or more generally represents moderately to severely active 
disease.
44 
6.3.2 BILAG 2004 
The BILAG -2004 index is an organ -specific 97-question assessment based on the principle of 
the doctor’s intent to treat.  Only clinical features attributable to SLE disease activity are to be recorded and based on the patient ’s condition in the last 4 weeks compared with the previous 
4 weeks.  It will be scored as not present (0), improved (1), the same (2), worse (3), or new (4).  Disease activity is graded separately for 9 body systems to 5 different grades (A to E) as 
follows: A (“Active”)  is very active disease, B  (“Beware”)  is moderate activity, C 
(“Contentment”) is mild stable disease, D (“Discount”) is inactive now but previously active , and 
E (“Excluded”)  indicates the organ was never involved.
[ADDRESS_381234] maintain 
documentation with descriptive details supporting the BILAG-2004 scoring (eg, chart, worksheet, clinic notes, and l abs) at each visit.  
See APPENDIX 5 for detailed specifications . 
6.3.3 PGA of Disease Activity  
The PGA is used to assess investigator’s general impression on the pat ient’s overall status of 
SLE disease activity  via visual analogue scale (10 0 mm) with 0 being “very good, asymptomatic 
and no limitation of normal activities” with 100  mm being “most severe possible disease ever 
seen in all SLE patients”.    
When scoring the PGA, the assessor should always look back at the score from the previous visit.

[IP_ADDRESS] SRI-4 Response  
The SRI-4 is a composite index of SLE disease improvement that consists of scores derived from 
the SLEDAI -2K and the BILAG 2004 Index .  Response based on the SRI-4 is defined by :  
1) ≥ 4-point reduction in SLEDAI-2K global score, 2) no new severe disease activity (BILAG  A 
organ score) or more than 1 new moderate organ score (BILAG B), and 3) no deterioration from 
baseline in the PGA by ≥ 0.[ADDRESS_381235] improve ments in clinical and patient- reported outcomes.45  
[IP_ADDRESS] SRI-5 and SRI -6 Response  
Like the SRI -4, the SRI-5 and SRI-6 are composite indices of SLE disease improvement that 
consists of scores derived from the SLEDAI-2K and the BILAG 2004 Index.  However, the SRI-5 and SRI-6 are computed with a minimal three -point or five-point improvement in 
SLEDAI-2K being required, respectively.
46 
[IP_ADDRESS] BICLA Response  
The BICLA is a responder index developed to measure response to therapy, and it includes 
scores from the BILAG, SLEDAI-2K, and PGA.  BICLA response is defined as 1) at least 
1 gradation of improvement in baseline BILAG 2004 scores in all body systems with moderate disease activity at entry (eg, all B [moderate disease] scores falling to C [mild], or D [no 
activity]); 2) no new BILAG A or more than 1 new BILAG B scores; 3) no worsening of total 
SLEDAI-2K score from baseline; 4) ≤ 10% deterioration in PGA score  and 5) no treatment 
failure.
44  It is driven primarily by [CONTACT_310182], and has been used in Phase 2 and 3 mAb 
studies.47 
For the endpoints of BICLA respons e at Days 210, 240, and 270, patient scores will be 
completed and response determined. 
6.3.5  CLASI Response  
The CLASI is a comprehensive tool for assessment of disease activity and damage in cutaneous 
lupus, shown to be valid, reliable, and sensitive to changes in disease activity. 48  Response is 
defined as  50% improvement from baseline in “A” or “B” scores.  This assessment will be 
applied to all patients as all are required to have cutaneous disease activity . 
For the secondary efficacy endpoint of CLASI response at Day 210, patient scores on MAD and 
POC studies will be compared with baseline for 50% improvement.

The SLICC/ACR damage index is a validated instrument to assess damage, defined as 
irreversible impairment, continuously persistent for 6 months (ascertained by [CONTACT_310183]), occurring since the onset of lupus, and it  is based on a weighted scoring system.   
This index records damage occurring in patients with SLE regardless of cause, with demonstrated content, face, criterion, and discriminant validity.
49  It will be performed on Days 0 
and 180. 
6.4.2 PROs 
Patients should be encouraged to complete the PROs at the clinic at the beginning of the study visit prior to any clinical assessments.  A member of the staff should be available if a patient requires further instruction and to review the PRO questionnaires for completeness prior to leaving the clinic.

Safety analyses will be based on the safety analysis set (SS), defined as all patients who receive 
at least 1 dose of study treatment.  Safety analyses will be conducted on the basis of actual 
treatment received.  
Pharmacokinetic analysis will be conducted on the PK analysis set, defined as the FAS with 
sufficient concentration data for the calculation of PK parameters.    
8.2.2 Demographics and Baselin e Characteristics  
Baseline and patient characteristics will be summarized  using all randomized patients .   
8.2.3 Primary Efficacy  Endpoint(s)  
The proportion of patients who achieve a SRI -4 response at Day 210 will be assessed via 
Pearson’s chi -squared analysis.  The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using the FAS 
and if needed  repeated in  the PP analysis set.   Missing values will be addressed by [CONTACT_18120] a 
last observation carried forward (LOCF) analysis .  Other imputation methods may be employed 
as a sensitivity analysis  and will be described in the SAP.   Additional analyses exploring impact 
of baseline factors such as baseline disease severity, race, and other characteristics may be 
performed.   
Patients that received prohibited medications or unallowable CS usage as described in 
Section 4.6 will be considered “medication failures” and will be treated as non -responders for the 
primary efficacy analysis.   Patients that received an allowable CS burst but having missing data 
at Day 210 will considered a medication failure and will be treated as non-responders for the primary efficacy analysis.  The determination of medication failures will be reviewed using 
blinded data and finalized prior to unblinding.   
The superiority of BOS161721 relative to placebo will be evaluated.  If the proportion of SRI-4 
responders for the selected POC dose in BOS161721 arm is higher than that of the placebo arm, then BOS161721 will be considered superior to placebo if the 2-sided p- value is less than or

on the same statistical hypothesis.  
8.2.4 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s ) 
Binary efficacy endpoints will be assessed via Pearson’s chi-squared analysis.  Continuous 
efficacy endpoints will be assessed via analysis of variance (ANOVA) or analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) and treatment will be compared using the F -test.  Repeated measures mixed models 
may be performed to evaluate data collected at each visit and overall.  Time-to-event endpoints 
will be assessed via Kaplan -Meier methodology and treatment will be compared using the log-
rank test.  The secondary efficacy end points will be analyzed on the FAS and if needed repeated 
in the PP analysis set.  Details including handling of missing data and “medication failures” will 
be available in the SAP.  
8.2.5 Analysis of Safety 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Analysis 
Safety analyses will be performed on the SS.  AE data will be coded to system organ class and 
preferred term using MedDRA.  The  number and percent age of patients experiencing any 
treatment -emergent AE, overall, and by [CONTACT_310275], will be tabulated.  
Treatment -emergent AEs will also be summarized  by [CONTACT_42564].   
Concomitant medications will be coded using the WHO Drug dictionary.  Observed values and changes from baseline in vital signs , ECG readings,  and hematology and clinical chemistry 
parameters will be summarized at each individual visit.   
8.2.6 Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Data

9.2 DMC 
This study will use an external DMC.  The DMC is an independent committee established to 
provide oversight of safety considerations in study and to provide advice to the sponsor regarding actions the committee deems necessary for the continuing protection of enrolled patients and those yet to be recruited to the trial as well as for the continuing validity and scientific merit of the study results.  The DMC is charged with assessing such actions in light of 
an acceptable benefit/risk profile for BOS161721.  The recommendations made by [CONTACT_1363] (ie, dose escalation, etc.) will be forwarded to the sponsor for final decision.  The sponsor will forward suc h decisions, which may include summaries of safety data which are not endpoints, to 
regulatory authorities, as appropriate. 
The sponsor will appoint a DMC for the periodic review of available study data.  The DMC is an 
independent group of experts that advises the sponsor and the study investigators.  The members 
of the DMC  serve in an individual capacity and provide their expertise and recommendations.

Clinical Study  Protocol:  BOS161721- 02 
Protocol Date and Version:  2 1 March 201 8; V3.[ADDRESS_381264] the health of the people.  The physician’s knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty. 
The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association binds the physician with the 
words, "The health of my subject will be my first consideration," and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, "A physician shall act only in the subject's interest when providing medical care which might have the effect of weakening the physical and mental condition of the subject." 
Medical progress is based on research, which ultimately must rest in part on experimentation 
involving human subjects. In medical research on human subjects, considerations related to the well-being of the human 
subject should take precedence over the interes ts of science and society.  
The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to improve prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic procedures and the understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of disease.  Even the best -proven prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods must 
continuously be challenged through research for their effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility,  and 
quality. 
BOS161721  [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study  Protocol:  BOS161721- 02 
Protocol Date and Version:  2 1 March 201 8; V3.[ADDRESS_381265] involving human subjects should be preceded by [CONTACT_310253]161721  [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study  Protocol:  BOS161721- 02 
Protocol Date and Version:  2 1 March 201 8; V3.[ADDRESS_381266]’s information and to minimize the impact of the study on the subject's physical and mental integrity and on the personality of the subject. 
In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the 
aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail.  The subject should be informed of the right to abstain from participation in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal.  After ensuring that the subject has understood the information, the physician should then obtain the subject's freely-given informed consent, preferably in writing.  If the consent cannot be obtained in writing, the non- written 
consent must be formally documented and witnessed. 
When obtaining informed consent for the research project the physician should be particularly 
cautious if the subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under 
duress.  In that case the informed consent should be obtained by a well-informed physician who is not engaged in the investigation and who is completely independent of this relationship.  
For a research subject who is legally incompetent, physically or mentally incapable of giving consent or is a legally incompetent minor, the investigator must obtain informed consent from the legally authorized representative in accordan ce with applicable law.  These groups should not 
be included in research unless the research is necessary to promote the health of the population represented and this research cannot instead be performed on legally competent persons. 
When a subject deemed legally incompetent, such as a minor child, is able to give assent to 
decisions about participation in research, the investigator must obtain that assent in addition to 
the consent of the legally authorized representative. 
Research on individuals from whom it is not possible to obtain consent, including proxy or 
advance consent, should be done only if the physical/mental condition that prevents obtaining

Protocol Date and Version:  2 1 March 201 8; V3.[ADDRESS_381267] be free to use unproven or new prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic measures, if in the physician’s judgment it offers hope of saving life, re -establishing health, or alleviating suffering.  
Where possible, these measures should be made the object of research, designed to evaluate their safety and efficacy .  In all cases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, 
published.  The other relevant guidelines of this Declaration should be followed.

Data from 60 patients, including the 12 from the MAD study, or 6 fewer if the low dose is chosen, who are in the cohort of the chosen dose for the 
POC study who complete 3 months of treatment will be used in a second 
IA (IA2) at Day 90 to assess if the trial could stop for an early futility conclusion.  If futility is not claimed in the IA2, the POC study will continue to approximately 156 patients.  
Following the 6 month tre atment period, primary and secondary efficacy 
endpoints will be assessed for each patient, after providing their Day 180 disease activity assessments.  DMC monitoring will be conducted periodically throughout the study as described in the DMC charter.

SUMMARY, Statistical Considerations  Replace: 
Baseline and patient characteristics will be summarized via appropriate 
summary statistics by [CONTACT_6654], for each phase of the trial. 
Binary efficacy endpoints will be compared between treatments via 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) analysis.  Continuous efficac y 
endpoints will be assessed via analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) repeated 
measures mixed model analysis with factors including treatment, time, treatment -by-time interaction, baseline covariate, and covariate- by-time 
interaction.  Summary statistics will b e provided by [CONTACT_2715]/treatment for all 
safety endpoints.  Details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan 
(SAP).   
Two IAs are planned for this study.  The initial IA (IA1) will be conducted 
at the time of the POC decision for dose selection.  The second IA (IA2) The futility 
analysis was 
removed due to the modest size of the trial

8.2 Statistical Methods  
9.2.1 Analysis Populations  
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the full analysis set (FAS), 
defined to be all patients with at least [ADDRESS_381305]- baseline efficacy 
evaluation.  A per protocol (PP) analysis set may be defined to exclude major protocol violations from the efficacy analysis.  The PP Population will include all patients from the FAS except those with major violations to the protocol deemed to impact the analysis of the primary endpoint.  These violations will be identified based on blinded data prior to 
unblinding the final analysis dataset.  Safety ana lyses will be based on all 
patients who receive test treatment.  Pharmacokinetic analysis will be 
conducted on the PK analysis set (PK), defined as the FAS with sufficient concentration data for the calculation of PK parameters.  All analyses will combine data from the MAD and POC studies and focus on the active 
treatment dose chosen for the POC study versus placebo.  The 0.05 
1-sided type 1 error level is included for POC, and the 0.025 1- sided 
type 1 error level for potential use of this trial to support regulatory filing.

This study will use an external DMC.  The DMC is an independent 
committee established to provide oversight of safety considerations in 
study and to provide advice to the sponsor regarding actions the committee deems necessary for the continuing protection of enrolled patients and those yet to be recruited to the trial as well as for the 
continuing validity and scientific merit of the study results.  The DMC is charged with assessing such actions in light of an acceptable benefit/risk 
profile for anti -IL-21 mAb.  The recommendations made by [CONTACT_1363] (ie, 
dose escalation, etc.) will be forwarded to the sponsor for final decision.  
The sponsor will forward such decisions, which may include summaries of 
safety data which are not endpoints, to regulatory authorities, as 
appropriate. 
The DMC will have access to unblinded treatment information during the 
clinical trial.  Details regarding management and process of this 
committee are found in the DMC Charter.  
The DMC may recommend termination of an anti -IL-21 mAb treatment 
arm or the entire BOS161721 MAD/POC trial for any safety concern that 
is felt to outweigh potential benefits.  The recommendation must be supported by [CONTACT_310226].

A per protocol (PP) analysis set may be defined to exclude major protocol violations from the efficacy analysis.  The PP Population will include all patients from the FAS except those with majo r violations to the protocol 
deemed to impact the analysis of the primary endpoint.  These violations will be identified based on blinded data prior study to unblinding.  PP 
analyses will be conducted on the basis of the randomized treatment.  
Safety analys es will be based on  the safety analysis set (SS), defined as 
all patients who receive at least 1  dose of study treatment.  Safety 
analyses will be conducted on the basis of actual treatment received.  
Pharmacokinetic analysis will be conducted on the PK an alysis set, 
defined as the FAS with sufficient concentration data for the calculation of 
PK parameters.  
8.2.2 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Baseline and patient characteristics will be summarized  using all 
randomized patients .   
8.2.3 Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s)  
The proportion of patients who achieve a SRI-4 response at Day  210 will 
be assessed via Pearson’s chi -squared analysis.  The primary efficacy 
endpoint will be analyzed using the FAS and if needed  repeated in  the PP 
analysis set.  Missing values will be addressed by [CONTACT_18120] a last 
observation carried forward (LOCF) analysis .  Other imputation methods 
may be employed  as a sensitivity analysis  and will be described in the

Patients will be classified as non -responders if they (1) receive a 
second rescue medication at any time in the study or (2) take 
rescue medications between Week 8 and Week 16 or between 
Week  20 and Week 28 (as described in Section 5.6.1).  If a 
patient has been deemed a non -responder, they will discontinue 
from treatment  and all End of Treatment assessments will be 
performed.  The patient will then enter the safety follow -up 
period.  The use of rescue medications in the case of 
non-responders is not to be considered a protocol violation 
(exclusion criteria 8).  Protocol v iolations will be identified based 
on blinded data prior to unblinding the final analysis dataset.  Section deleted.  
Patients requiring corticosteroid outside of the protocol allowed 
time should be included 
in safety analysis and therefore continue in

corticosteroid excluded from protocol windows 
would be documented as protocol violations.

Title:  A Randomized Double -Blind Phase  1b/2 Combined Staggered 
Multiple Dose Escalation Study of BOS161721 in Systemic Lupus 
Erythematosus (SLE)  Patients on a Background of Limited Standard 
of Care  
Indication  Adults with moderately to severely active SLE  
Background and 
Rationale SLE is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease with considerable 
heterogeneity in clinical manifestations and disease course.  There is 
evidence that B - and T- cells are critical to the development of the 
disease, and that T -cell-derived cytokines such as interleukin -21 
(IL-21) are involved in the SLE -associated inflammatory 
pathological response.    
BOS161721 is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) triple mutation monoclonal antibody (mAb) intended to have an extended terminal elimination half- life (t
1/2) that selectively binds to and 
neutralizes  IL-21, which acts on multiple cell types that drive  
inflammation and autoimmunity.  In vivo, BOS161721 inhibits T-cell dependent antigen responses of B -cells 
and is being developed 
as a potential  treatment for adult s with moderately to severely active 
SLE.    
No
nclinical studies have evaluated  the toxi city, pharmacodynamics 
(PD), toxicokinetics (TK), pharmacokinetics (PK) , and 
immunogenicity of BOS161721 administered intravenously (IV) and subcutaneously (SC).  The no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) in Cynomolgus monkeys were determined to be 
100 mg/kg IV and 50 mg/kg SC, the highest doses tested.  No SC animals had injection reactions.  
In a Phase 1 single as cending dose (SAD) study, BOS161721 was 
administered IV and SC to healthy male and female adult subjects.  
This double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated 8 ascending dose levels (1 [IV], 3 [SC], 10 [SC], 22 [IV], 30 [SC], 60 [SC], 120 [SC], or 240 [ SC] mg) for safety, tolerability, PK, PD and 
immunogenicity.  Overall, there were no clinically significant safety or tolerability findings from this study, following an interim cut and 
review of the data at Day 90 postdose.  
Results from the Phase 1 SAD study informed the dose regimens 
used for the multiple ascending doses (MAD) Phase 1b  study in this 
trial.  The MAD study will involve  3 cohorts.  The Phase 2 portion 
will be a proof of concept (POC) study , where dose selection  will be 
based on the sponsor ’s assessment of safety, tolerability,

Confidential  Page 24 of 118 patient s.  Dose selection for each cohort is based on 90 -day safety, 
tolerabi lity, PK , and PD  data review from the Phase 1 SAD study 
(BOS161721-01) in healthy subjects .  Each of the 3 doses (20 mg, 
60 mg, and 120 mg) selected for the MAD study are projected not to 
exceed the mean exposure of that achieved in the SAD study 
following the single [ADDRESS_381348] completed 2 weeks of 
follow- up after the second dose, Cohort 2 begins dosing (after a data 
monitoring committee [DMC] evaluat es the safety and tolerability 
data from  Cohort 1) .  Similarly, after [ADDRESS_381349] interim analysis (IA1).  At that time, a decision will be made to suggest which dose should be carried forward into the POC Phase 2 
study.  Th is dose will not exceed doses tested during the MAD study
.   
For the POC study, approximately 156 patients will be randomized 
to active or placebo groups in a 2:1 ratio.  As in the MAD study, 
each patient in the POC study may receive a total of 7 SC monthly 
doses on Days 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180.  A maximum daily dose of 30 mg/day of oral CS will be acceptable for eligibility for the 
study, however, daily dose must be tapered down to a maximum of 
10 mg/day for at least 5 days prior to Day 0 (randomization day).  
One oral CS “burst ” for increased SLE disease activity may occur  
during the study between Day 0  and Day 60.  Tapering of steroids 
during the course of the study will be encouraged and should be evaluated at all visits.   Tapering may occur after randomization 
except within 60 days of the primary (D ay 210) and secondary 
(Day 120) endpoint assessments.  Between Day [ADDRESS_381350] be held constant 
otherwise the patient will be declared a non -responder in efficacy 
assessments.  
Data from  60 patients, including the 12 from the MAD study, or 
6 fewer if the low dose is chosen , who are in the cohort of the chosen 
dose for the PO C study who complete 3 months of treatment will be 
used in a second  IA (IA2) at Day 90 to assess if the tri al could stop 
for an early futility conclusion.  If futility is not claimed in the IA 2, 
the POC study will continue to approximately 156 patients .

Statistical 
Considerations Below is a summary of the statistical methods.   Further  details can be 
found in Section 9. 
Baseline and patient characteristics will be summarized via appropriate summary statistics by [CONTACT_6654], for each phase of the trial . 
Binary efficacy endpoints will be compared between treatments via Cochran- Mantel -Haen szel (CMH) analysis.  Continuous efficacy 
endpoints will be assessed via analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) repeated measures mixed model analysis with factors including 
treatment, time, treatment-by- time interaction, baseline covariate, 
and covariate-by- time interaction.   Summary statistics will be 
provided by [CONTACT_2715]/treatment for all safety endpoints.  Details will be provided in the s tatistical analysis plan (SAP ).   
Two IAs are planned for this study.  The initial IA (IA1) will be conducted at the time of the POC decision for dose selection.  The second IA (IA2) will be performed for futility.  IA2 is planned to be 
conducted when SRI-4 response is determined for approximately 60 patients (including all patients  at the same dose level /matching 
placebo  from the MAD study) after completing [ADDRESS_381361] on 
the type 1 error level.   
AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_310276].  Laboratory data and vit al signs will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_310295].  Summary statistics will include n, arithmetic mean, median, arithmetic SD, minimum, and 
maximum.  
The PK parameter data w ill be listed and summarized descriptively 
in tabular format.  Binary PD endpoints will be assessed for the full 
analysis set ( FAS) population via CMH analysis.  Continuous PD 
endpoints will be assessed via ANCOVA repeated measures mixed model analysis wit h multiple factors.  PK and PD relationships will 
be explored graphically and where appropriate model based methods of analysis will used.

1.1 Indication  
BOS161721 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb), which binds to and inhibits 
interleukin -21 (IL-21) bioactivity, and is being develope d for the treatment of moderately to 
severely active systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) in adults.  
1.[ADDRESS_381370] common cause of death during later disease.2   
The reported prevalence of SLE in the [LOCATION_002] (US) is 20 to 70 cases per 100,000 people.3  
More than 90% of cases of SLE occur in women, frequent ly starting at chil dbearing age.  
Women of color  are disproportionately affected by [CONTACT_113919].  This suggests multiple genetic and 
environmental factors are at play.  Accordingly, a multifactorial view of the 
immunopathogenesis of SLE suggests more than [ADDRESS_381371], including breach in central tolerance in the adaptive arm of the immune system, peripheral am plification of the autoimmune 
response by [CONTACT_310147], and local processes in the target organ that facilitate end-organ disease.

1.2.2 B
OS161721 Development  
[LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals is developi[INVESTIGATOR_310031]161721 for the treatment of SLE.  BOS161721 is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1)  mAb directed against human IL -21.   
Murine mAb 19E3, the progenitor of BOS161721, was generated using mouse hybridoma technology.  19E3 has subpi[INVESTIGATOR_36379] (pM) affinity to human IL- 21 and was selected for its potent 
neutral ization of IL -21 bioactivity.  BOS161721 was generated by [CONTACT_310148] 
19E3 where its complementarity-determining regions were grafted onto a human IgG1 kappa backbone.  The fragment crystallizable (Fc) portion of BOS161721 contains a YTE (M252Y/S254T/T256E triple mutation) in the constant domain of the IgG1 heavy chain that was introduced into the parental molecule, 19E3, intended to prolong the in vivo terminal elimination half- life ( t
1/2) of the mAb.5  Thus, BOS161721 retains sub- pM binding to IL -21 and prevents 
IL-21 from binding to the IL-21 receptor (IL-21R), inhibiting IL-21 bioactivity.   
BOS161721 [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- 02 
Confidential  Page 41 of 118 BOS161721 binds to human IL -21 and Cynomolgus monkey IL-21, which are highly 
homologous, and neutralizes the bioactivity of both.  BOS161721 is specific for IL -21 as it does 
not bind to or inhibit the other gamma- chain (γc) family  of cytokines , and acts to specifically 
neutralize the IL -[ADDRESS_381372].  In in vitro  studies, BOS161721 inhibited downstream IL-21-
induced signaling, IL -21-induced plasma cell diffe rentiation , and IL-21- induced natural killer 
(NK) cell activation.  In in vivo  studies, BOS161721 significantly inhibited the T-cell dependent 
antibody response (TDAR) to immunization with a protein antigen as well as B- cell expansion 
following a second protein antigen immunization in Cynomolgus monkeys.    
[IP_ADDRESS] Interleukin -[ADDRESS_381373] cytokines in this family are critically important for both 
the maintenance and function of T-cell and B- cell responses.  IL -21 signals through a receptor 
complex consisting of its own private receptor, the IL-21R and γc.6,7  Engagement of the 
IL-21R/γc complex leads to the activation of several signaling pathways, including the Janus 
kinase/signal transducer and ac tivator of transcription, mitogen- activated protein kinase (MAPK) 
and phosphoinositide 3- kinase pathways.[ADDRESS_381374] array of cell types, including B- cells, T -cells, NK -cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, 
as well as other hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells such as fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and 
intestinal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663].9,11  Activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3  
(STAT3 ) via phosphorylation is critical  in regulating human B- cell responses to IL -2112; 
phosphorylated STAT3  (pSTAT3) forms a homodimer, which translocates to the nucleus where 
it initiates transcription of the IL -21 gene , forming an autocrine loop for IL-21 production via 
STAT3 phosphorylation.13  In addition, IL -21 has been shown to upregulate expression of its 
own receptor14 and induces an autocrine feedback loop.15 
IL-21 modulates various aspects of immune function.  It  promotes cluster of differentiation 4 
(CD4+ ) T-cell differentiation and promotes the generation of T -helper (Th)1716 and T- follicular 
helper (Tfh)  cells.15,17  In mice, IL -21 has been shown to regulate the balance between Th17 and 
regulatory T- cell (Treg), in that it increases Th17, while inhibiting Treg differentiation.[ADDRESS_381375] disease induced by [CONTACT_74934] T- cells.20  IL-21 upregulates CD8+ 
T-cell and NK -cell expansion and cytolytic activity by [CONTACT_310149] B and perforin.21,22  
IL-21 also has been reported to increase granzyme B in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B -cells 
resulting in inhibition of T- cell responses.23,24  IL-21 also has a variety of effects on 
nonhematopoietic cells, such as stromal cells and induces inflammation through matrix metalloproteinase release by [CONTACT_310207].
25 
One principal non-redundant role of IL-21 is the promotion of B- cell activation, dif ferentiation , 
or death during humoral immune responses.14  Furthermore, increased IL -21 production is 
characteristic of several autoimmune diseases and is likely to contribute to autoantibody production as well as pathologic features of autoimmune disease.
 26  The critical role of IL -21 in 
promoting humoral and other immune responses makes it an important focus of potential

studies (GWAS) have provided convincing evidence that the chromosomal 4q 27 region harbors 
the IL -21 genes and is associated with chronic inflammatory disorders, including SLE.29   
[IP_ADDRESS] Preclinical Studies  
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of BOS161721 were characterized following single- dose intravenous 
(IV) administration of BOS161721 (0.01 to 30 mg/kg) in male Cynomolgus monkeys or repeat, every 2 weeks IV administration (15 to 100 mg/kg) and subcutaneous (SC) administration (50 mg/kg) in male and female Cynomolgus monkeys.  Systemic exposure was approximately dose-proportional within the tested dose range.  SC bioavailability was determined to be 64.3%.  
 
 
Two single-dose (IV) non-good laboratory practice (GLP) studies conducted in Cynomolgus monkeys evaluated the toxicity, pharmacodynamics (PD), toxicokinetics (TK), and immunogenicity of BOS161721.  Following a single IV administration (slow bolus), there were no BOS161721- related adverse changes, resulting in a no -observed -adverse- effect -level 
(NOAEL) value of 30  mg/kg, the highest dose tested among 2 studies.  
 
In a repeat -dose GLP toxicology study in Cynomolgus monkeys, BOS161721 was administered 
every 2 weeks by [CONTACT_310152] (50 mg/kg) administration for 3 months (a total of 7  doses).

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Studies  
BOS161721-01 was a double-blind, Phase 1, single ascending dose (SAD) study to assess the 
safety, PK , and PD of BOS161721 in healthy subjects.  The primary objective of the study was 
to characteri ze the safety and tolerability of IV and SC SADs  of BOS161721 in an otherwise 
healthy subject population without concomitant illnesses, immune abnormalities, or concomitant 
medications.  Secondary objectives include d characterization of the PK and immunogenicity of 
BOS161721, and exploratory objectives included the evaluation of the effect of BOS161721 on TDAR to keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( KLH) (primary and secondary immunizations) in healthy 
subjects, the effects of BOS161721 on plasma levels of IL -21 (fre e and bound), and the 
evaluation of the effect of BOS161721 on IL -21 gene expression (via gene signature) in blood.  
This study consist ed of 8 cohorts.  Subjects were  randomized in a 3:1 ratio (BOS161721: 
placebo) and received either a single dose of BOS161721 (1 [IV], 3 [SC], 10 [SC], 22 [IV], 
30 [SC], 60 [SC], 120 [SC],  or 240 [SC]  mg) or placebo, with safety follow -up.  For the first 
cohort, after the first 2  subjects were dosed (1 active and 1 placebo), there was  a minimum gap of 
[ADDRESS_381377] 7  days of safety and tolerability data by [CONTACT_310153] 
(SDMT).   
Blood samples were collected at every in -house study visit for BOS161721 concentration 
determin ations.  Blood samples were also collected for determination of IL -21 plasma levels 
(free and total).  Safety was assessed based on the occurrence of treatment -emergent AEs, 
hepatic function abnormality, and acute and delayed hypersensitivity reactions.  O ther safety 
variables include d electrocardiograms ( ECGs ), vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and 
temperature), safety laboratory assessments, blood sampling for ADAs, total IgG and IgM levels, 
CD4+ count, and full and targeted physical examinations.  Overall, there were no clinically significant findings from this study, following an interim cut and review of the data at Day 90 postdose.  A dverse event s reported as related to the study drug, particularly infections, were 
expected for the compound, and there were no clinically relevant changes in laboratory and ECG results or vital signs.  There was 1 serious adverse event ( SAE ; death  due to pulmonary 
embolism ) that occurred 127  days after a single administration of 240 mg SC dose of 
BOS161721.  The causality of this single SAE was not attributed to study drug and further information can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.  PK data from the SAD study demonstrates BOS161721 has an extended t

approximately 42-46 days) which supports evaluation of monthly dosing.

90-day safety, tolerability, PK, and PD data review from the  Phase 1  SAD study 
(BOS161721-01); t he SDMT reviewed the blinded safety data from subjects for each  dose cohort 
(8 cohorts, evaluating 1 [IV], 3 [SC], 10 [SC], 22 [IV], 30 [SC], 60 [SC], 120 [SC], or 
240 [SC] mg), along with the accumulated safety and available PK/PD data from all subjects in 
the previous dose cohorts, to make a decision on whether to proceed to the next higher dose 
level, repeat a dose level , or stop dose escalation.   Overall, there were no clinically significant 
safety or tolerability findings from this study. 
Based on the Day -90 interim cut of the PK and biomarker data in the BOS161721-01 study, the 
recommended doses for evaluation in the MAD phase of this study are 20, 60, and 120 mg SC 
monthly.  This dose recommendation is supported by [CONTACT_310296]161721 
resulting in a median T max of 6 days and an apparent terminal half-life of 44 days.  Furthermore,

details can be found in the DMC Charter.  
The benefit of participation for all patient s in this study is close monitoring of their medical 
condition and safety of their treatment.  Those randomized to the active treatment arm may potentially experience improvement in their SLE  disease.  Those randomized to the placebo (in 
combination with s tandard of care) arm are not expected to obtain any additional benefit, beyond 
those of their background treatment, though close monitoring of their medical condition and safety may itself be associated with improving their SLE .   
1.2.5 Potential Risks  
Potential r isks based on the m echanism of action of BOS161721 include inf ections, risks 
associ ated wit h the administration of any foreign pro tein or biologic agent, including injection 
site r eaction, anaphy laxis, serious allerg ic reaction, and deve lopment of AD As.  ADAs  could 
result in immune c omplex disea se (with mani festations su ch as arthralgias, serum- sickn ess, and 
vasculitis), autoim munity, or altere d BOS161721 leve ls or activity.  Further details can be found

Confidential  Page 46 of 118 in the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for BOS161721, which contains comprehensive 
toxicology, preclinical and clinical information on BOS161721. 
Two investigational drug products are considered to be in the same pharmacological class as BOS161721 based on interruption of signaling through the IL-[ADDRESS_381382].  No potential risk generalizable across the class has been observed with these investigational products.  Based on the clinical Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), AEs reported as related to the study drug, particularly infections (flu-like symptoms, etc), were expected for the compound, and there were no clinically relevant changes in laboratory and ECG results or vital signs.  
The majority of IgG elimination occurs via intracellular cat abolism, following fluid-phase or 
receptor -mediated endocytosis.  This type of endocytosis and elimination is a form of 
target-mediated disposition where the interaction of the drug and its pharmacological target 
(eg, a target receptor) serves as a signifi cant contributor to the kinetics of antibody distribution 
and elimination.  Renal elimination, which is a primary pathway of clearance of small -molecule 
drugs, is relatively unimportant for IgG, as its large size prevents efficient filtration through the glomerulus.  Secretion into the bile is an important pathway of elimination of IgA antibodies, but this route is not a significant contributor to the elimination of IgG antibodies.  Thus, risk to renal and hepatic systems due to metabolism of BOS161721 is l ow.

[IP_ADDRESS] Anaphylaxis and Serious Allergic Reactions 
As with the administration of any foreign protein and/or other biological agents, acute hypersensitivity reactions, including acute anaphylactic/hypersensitivity, severe allergic, and anaphylactoid reactions may follow infusion of mAbs and can be caused by [CONTACT_62535].  These acute hypersensitivity reactions may be severe and result in death.  
Anaphylaxis will be defined according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (NIAID/FAAN) criteria ,
34 and are discussed in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].1. 
Based on the limited Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), anaphylaxis and serious allergic 
reactions in subjects who received BOS161721 was not observed.   Patients with a known history of allergy or severe hypersensitivity reaction to any component of 
BOS161721 formulation or patients with a history of anaphylaxis to any other biological therapy such as mAbs will be excluded from studies with BOS161721.  In addition, appropriate drugs and medical equipment to treat acute hypotensive, bronchoconstrictive, or anaphylactic reactions will be immediately available at the u nit and study personnel will be trained to recognize and 
treat these reactions.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Injection Site Reactions 
In a repeat -dose GLP toxicology study in Cynomolgus monkeys, BOS161721 was administered 
every 2 weeks by [CONTACT_310152] (50 mg/kg) for 3 months (a total of 7  doses); no SC animals had 
injection reactions.

Confidential  Page 47 of 118 Based on the Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721- 01), incidence of injection site reactions in 
subjects who received BOS161721 was similar to placebo.   
Patients will be monitored for local injection site reactions in this study.  See Section 7.2.7.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Immune Complex Disease 
The potential risk of immune complex disease for BOS161721 is theoretical, based on the known 
risks associated with mAbs.  The administration of a mAb can result in the formation of ADAs.  Administration of the mAb in the presence of ADA may result in the formation of circulating antibody-antigen complexes potentially resulting in altered BOS161721 levels or activity or deposition of the complexes in microvasculature.  Complement is frequently involved in the latter setting, and the breakdown products of complement attract polymorphonuclear leukocytes to the site of deposition where they can provoke local tissue damage through specific or nonspecific release of enzymes.  Two of the more common end -organ targets are the blood 
vessels (vasculitis) and kidney (nephritis).  These clinical manifestations represent immune complex disease or Type III hypersensitivity.  Although BOS161721 is a humanized mAb, ADAs may develop; however, the likelihood of occurrence of immune complex disease with BOS161721 is low.  The findings of immune complex disease are typi[INVESTIGATOR_310078]- antigen complexes are cleared from the body . 
Based on the limited Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), immune complex disease in subjects 
who received BOS161721 was not observed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Infections  
BOS161721 is expected to diminish the activity of T- cell, B -cell and NK- cell lines.  Like other 
medications modulating immune response, BOS161721 may increase the potential risk for  
infection, including serious infections.  IL-21 produced by [CONTACT_398]4+ Th cells is required to sustain 
the anti-viral function of CD8+ T- cells against chronic viral infections.  Nonclinical evidence 
suggests that the risk of chronic viral infection recurrence or increased severity may occur with IL-21 inhibition.
35 
These conditions wil l be fully characterized with clinical descriptions and routine laboratory 
and/or specialty testing and treated where indicated with appropriate local standard of care. 
Patients with a history of opportunistic infection, including recurrent or severe  disse minated 
herpes zoster or disseminated herpes simplex  within the last 3 years , or any other underlying 
pathology predisposing to serious infection, are excluded from studies with BOS161721 (for 
further details please refer to the current IB for BOS161721). 
Patients will be assessed for hepatitis B, and C, and HIV-1/[ADDRESS_381383] been observed in

Confidential  Page 48 of 118 BOS161721 is expected to diminish the immunosurveillance activity of T- cell, B -cell, and 
NK-cell lines, a similar risk is biologically p lausible with prolonged exposure to BOS161721. 
Since the risk of opportunistic cryptosporidium infection increases with low levels of 
CD4+  T-cells,37 patients with a CD4+ count < 500 cell/mm3 were excluded from the Phase 1 
SAD study (BOS161721-01), and will be excluded from the proposed MAD/POC studies.  Patients exposed to investigational product who develop diarrhea during the course of the study should immediately undergo an assessment for opportunistic infection including stool for ova and parasites and stool examination for cryptosporidium.  Positive cryptosporidium in stool sample at screening is an exclusion.  Treatment by [CONTACT_310297]. 
Based on the limited Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), infections in subjects who received 
BOS161721 was not observed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Malignancy 
The stimulatory effect of IL -21 on NK cells and CD8+ T -cells suggests the cytokine may have 
anti-tumor activity.  Nonclinical studies have demonstrated significant anti- tumor effects of 
IL-21 in a number of tumor models.  IL- 21 therapy of human metastatic melanoma and renal cell 
carcinoma has demonstrated POC with significant increases in levels of perforin, granzyme B, 
and interferon gamma (IFNγ) expression in CD8+ T- cells and NK  T-cells.  Clinical response has 
been limited in these generally unmanageable diseases.  
The impact of treatment with anti- IL-21 therapy on the development or growth of malignancies 
is not known; however, as with other immunomodulatory biologic agents, treatment with 
BOS161721 may result in an increase in the risk of malignancies.  NK cell suppression by [CONTACT_8668]-[ADDRESS_381384] 5 years, with the ex ception

Based on the limited Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721- 01), malignancy in subjects who received 
BOS161721 was not observed.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatic Function Abnormality  
There is no substantial evidence suggestin g BOS161721 is associated with liver function 
abnormality.  However, as a precaution, p atients with a history of abnormal alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT)  and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or bilirubin at screening 
(ALT /AST  > 2 × upper limit of normal [ ULN] ; total bilirubin >  1.5 × [ULN] and judged by [CONTACT_119278]) were excluded from the Phase 1 SAD study 
(BOS161721-01), and will be excluded from the MAD study.  Patients with a positive hepatitis B or C test or a history of alcohol dependence will also be excluded. 
Based on the limited Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), hepatic function abnormality in subjects who received BOS161721 was not observed.

Confidential  Page 49 of 118 [IP_ADDRESS] Failure of Vaccination  
IL-21 is a key cytokine in development of B-cells into immunoglobulin- secreting plasma cells.  
Abnormal signaling through the IL-21R/Janus Kinase (JAK)3/signal transducer and activator of 
transcription (STAT3 ) pathway leads to defective humoral immune responses to both 
T-dependent and T-independent antigens and impairs the establishment of long- lasting B -cell 
memory.  Abnormal signaling through the pathway has been related to decreased specific antibody responses following vaccination, and to increased susceptibility to encapsulated bacterial infections.
[ADDRESS_381385] of BOS161721 was evaluated in in vivo single dose studies in Cynomolgus monkey in which the animals received vaccination to T -cell dependent KLH antigen to stimulate a TDAR.  
These in vivo studies demonstrated that BOS161721 significantly inhibited B- cell proliferation 
and IgG antibody responses to the KLH protein antigen; however, it is worth noting that 
BOS161721 administration did not produce any remarkable changes in anti-KLH antibody data for IgM, IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4 or anti- tetanus toxoid ( TT) antibody data for IgM, IgG, IgG1, or 
IgE during the dosing phase in the same study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Potential for Drug -Drug Interactions 
Drug -drug interactions were not evaluated in the Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), which 
included only healthy adult subjec ts.  Use of prescription medications (with the exceptions of 
oral contraceptives), and over- the-counter (OTC) treatments including herbal supplements such 
as St John’s Wort (except multivitamins), in the 2 weeks prior to screening was prohibited  in the 
SAD study.

7 SC monthly doses of study drug on Days 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180, followed by a 
90-day safety follow-up visit.   
SLE disease activity assessment dat a will be centrally reviewed by [CONTACT_310211].  The scope 
of responsibility includes, but is not  limited to, review and confirmation of “A” and “B” BILAG 
system organ disease, confirmation of clinical components of the SLEDAI- 2K score at screening  
and during the study, and cross-validation of the instruments used in this study to assess the disease being studied.  Further details on the content and methods of data reports by [CONTACT_310298] .   
4.1.[ADDRESS_381390] of 3  cohorts:  
• Cohort 1 (20 mg SC) will include 6 patient s 
o 5 patients will receive BOS161721 (a ctive  group) and 1 patient will receive placebo 
(placebo group) 
• Cohorts 2 (60  mg SC) and 3 (120 mg  SC) will include 12 patient s each  
o 9 patients in the active  group and 3 in the placebo  group 
Dose s selected for each of the 3 cohorts is based on a 90-day safety, tolerab ility, PK and PD data 
review  from the Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01) in healthy subjects .  All doses selected for 
the MAD study are projected not to exceed the mean exposure of that achieved in the SAD 
study.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Escalation for the MAD Study   
The MAD study design is staggered , where after the [ADDRESS_381391] completed 2 weeks of follow-up after the second dose, Cohort 2 begins dosing (after 
DMC evaluation of the safety and tolerability data from Cohort 1) .  Similarly, after [ADDRESS_381392] completed 2 weeks of follow-up after the 
second dose, Cohort 3 begins dosing after DMC evaluation of the safety and tolerability data 
from Cohorts 1 and 2.  Each cohort will continue at their assigned dose level through the ir 
respective 6-month treatment period s (See Study Schematic, Section  4.1).  If > 3 patients 
discontinue the study in a cohort, he/she may be replaced.

Confidential  Page 55 of 118 Criteria for dose escalation are further described in the DMC Charter.  See Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for  
additional details about DLTs .   
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Limiting T oxicity (DLT) 
Severity of adverse events will be graded according to National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE ) version 4.03.  For the purpose of dose 
escalation, any of the following AEs occurring after study drug administration, which are 
attributable to the study drug, will be considered DLTs: 
Hematologic : 
• Grade 4 neutropenia 
• Grade 3 neutropenic infection 
• Grade 3  thrombocytopenia with bleeding 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia 
Non-Hematologic:  
• Grade [ADDRESS_381393] medical therapy 
(eg, anti- emetics, anti -diarr heals)  
• Drug -induced liver injury  ([DILI ], Hy’s L aw), as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS].3 
Investigators should always manage their patients according to their medical judgment which 
may include interruption of study drug based on the particular clinical circumstances.  
[IP_ADDRESS] DMC Recommen dations   
During scheduled meetings, the DMC will review relevant study data for safety or benefit- risk 
concern.  During the MAD study, t he DMC may provide the following recommendation s to the 
sponsor: 
• Expanding a cohort at a specific dosing level, or repeating a lower dose in a subsequent 
cohort 
• Continuing a dose level for a given cohort 
• Escalating a dose level  for a subsequent cohort 
• Termination of current or previous cohort(s)  
Further dosing in a given cohort will be halted if [ADDRESS_381394] into the POC Phase 2

Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- 02 
Confidential  Page 56 of 118 study.  This POC dose decision will be based on evaluation of the PK, safety (inclusive of dose-
limiting toxicity [DLT]), and tolerability data (and available PD/biomarker data) from Cohorts 1, 2, and 3; this dose will not exceed doses tested during the MAD study.  The DMC will be reviewing all relevant data from Cohorts 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_381395] patient in 
Cohort 3 completes the Day 44 visit  (2 weeks after dose 2 ).  Details are provided in the DMC 
Charter.   
4.1.2 POC  Phase 2  Study  
[IP_ADDRESS] BOS161721 Dose  
The optimal dose evaluation is chosen based on MAD Phase 1 b safety, tolerability, 
immunogenicity, and PK and PD data.  The  dose will be communicated by a letter to site 
investigators participating in  the POC Phase 2 study, and to the IRB/I EC. 
[IP_ADDRESS] POC Study Design 
For t he POC study, approxim ately  156 patients will be randomized to active or placebo groups in 
a 2:1 ratio.   
As in the MAD study, e ach patient in the POC study may receive a total of 7 SC monthly doses 
of study drug on Days 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180.  Assessments will be completed 
according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Section  4.3).   Dose selection will be based on the 
sponsor’s assessment of safety, tolerability , immunogenicity, and PK and PD data from the 
MAD study of 30 patients treated with BOS161721/placebo. 
Data from  approximately 60 patients (including the 12 from the MAD study, or 6 fewer if the 
low dose is chosen who are in the cohort of the chosen dose f or the POC study) who complete 
3 months of treatment will be used in  the IA 2 at Day 90 to assess if the trial could stop for an 
early futility conclusion (see Section 9.3 for details regarding the IA).  If futility is not claimed in 
the IA 2, the POC study  will continue to approximately 156 patients.  
Following the 6 -month treatment period, primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be 
assessed for each patient after providing their Day 180 disease activity assessments.      
DMC monitoring will be conducted periodically throughout the study as described in the DMC 
charter .

6.5 Prema ture Discontinuation  
While patients are encouraged to complete all study evaluations, they may withdraw from the 
study at any time and for any reason.  Every effort will be made to determine why any patient  
withdraws from the study prematurely.  If the patient is unreachable by [CONTACT_756], a registered 
letter, at the minimum, should be sent to the patient requesting him/her to contact [CONTACT_3652].  
All patients who withdraw from the study with an ongoing AE or SAE must be followed until 
the end of study or until the event is resolved or deemed stable, respectively .   
If a patient  withdraws prematurely after dosing, an end of treatment (EO T) visit should be 
performed (Day 180) and a last follow -up visit 90 days after dosing should be scheduled 
(Day 270).  Safety follow-up visit procedures based on the Schedule of Assessments ( see 
Section  6.4). 
Patient  participation may be terminated prior to completing the study and the reason recorded as 
follows: 
• AE/SAE  
• Protocol deviation  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Patient  withdraws consent at their own request

7.2.1 Laboratory Assessments  
Laboratory tests will be performed at times defined in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Section  4.3).  Patient  eligibility will be determined based on these tests at screening.  
Unscheduled clinical labs may be obtained at any time during the study to assess any perceived safety concerns.  
A central laboratory will be used  (with the exception of urine pregnancy tests and stool analysis) 
to ensure accuracy and consistency in test results.  The central laboratory will transmit all results for protocol tests, scheduled and unscheduled, to the clinical data base.  Laboratory/analyte results that could unblind the study (ie, biomarker results) will not be reported to investigative sites.   Urinalysis will be performed on midstream, clean catch specimens.   Some biomarkers 
listed above will not be drawn at some sites due to geographical logistical challenges.  See the laboratory manual for details.  
Endpoint analyses will be based on changes from baseline assessments at Days 120 and 210.

serum pregnancy result at screening, appropriate contraception must be commenced or continued 
and a further negative urine pregnancy test result s will then be required at the baseline visit 
before the patient  may receive the investigational product.  Urine p regnancy tests will also be

7.2.2 Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence experienced by a study patient, whether 
or not considered drug related by [CONTACT_458].    
AEs are unfavorable changes in a general condition, subjective or objective signs or symptoms, 
worsening of pre- existing concomitant disease, and clinically significant abnormality  in 
laboratory parameters observed in a patient  in the course of a clinical study.   
Non-serious SLE manifestations or abnormal laboratory results  related to SLE  disease activity  
would not be recorded as AEs unless they meet the definition for SAEs ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Recording of Adverse Events 
AEs should be collected and recorded for each patient  from the date of the first dose of study 
drug until the end of their participation in the study, including the safety follow up period.   
AEs may be volunteered spontaneously by [CONTACT_4694] , or discovered by [CONTACT_14543], nonleading question such as ‘How have you 
been feeling since you were last asked?’  All AEs and any required remedial action will be recorded  on the Adverse Events e CRF  and Safety Adverse Event Form.  The details of the AE, 
date of AE onset (and time, if known), date of AE outcome (and time, if known), and action taken for  the AE will be documented together with the principal investigator’s assessment of the 
seriousness of the AE and causal relationship to the study drug and/or the study procedure. 
All AEs should be recorded individually, using diagnostic terms where possible.   If the diagnosis 
is not established,  individual symptom s may be reported .  The AEs will subsequently be coded 
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).    
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity of Adverse Events  
Each AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_310083] (NCI CTCAE), version 4.03 criteria.
 41  
When changes in the severity (grade) of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the event should be noted for that day.  Any change in severity of signs and symptoms over a number of days will be captured by [CONTACT_44745] a new AE, with the amended severity grade and the date (and time, if known) of the change.

Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- 02 
Confidential  Page 85 of 118 [IP_ADDRESS] Causality  of Adverse Events  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310084]161721 or placebo and 
the AE.  One of the following categories (Table 4) should be selected based on medical 
judgment, considering the definitions below and all contributing factors. 
Table 4. Causality Definitions  
Related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurs in a plausible time 
relationship to treatment administration and which concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals cannot explain.  The response to withdrawal of the treatment (dechallenge
a) should be clinically plausible.  The event must be definitive 
pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory rechallengeb 
procedure if necessary.  
Unrelated  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no temporal 
relationship with treatment administration.  May have negative dechallenge and rechallenge information.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_261969] (eg, concomitant disease, environmental factors, or other drugs or chemicals).  
a Dechallenge:  Upon discontinuation of a drug suspected of causing an AE, the symptoms of the AE 
disappear partially or completely, within a reasonable  time from drug discontinuation  (positive 
dechallenge), or the symptoms continue despi[INVESTIGATOR_211386] (negative dechallenge).  Note that 
there are exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet drug relatedness 
clearly exists (for example, as in  bone marrow suppression, fixed drug eruptions, or tardive dyskinesia).  
b Rechallenge:   Upon re -administration of a drug suspected of causing an AE in a specific patient in the past, 
the AE recurs upon exposure (positive rechallenge), or the AE does not recur  (negative rechallenge).  
An unexpected adverse drug event is any adverse drug event for which the specificity or severity 
is not consistent with the current IP. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Seriousness  of Adverse Events 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening; this means that the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it 
does not mean that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe 
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_211384] 
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is another important medical event (see below)  
BOS161721 [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- 02 
Confidential  Page 86 of 118 Important medic al events that do not result in death, are not life threatening, or do not require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.   Examples of such events are:  
• Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm 
• Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• Development of drug dependency or drug abuse 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310085] (eg, elective surgery for a pre-existing condition that has not worsened) need not be considered SAEs.  If anything untoward is reported during the procedure, that occurrence must be reported 
as an AE, either 'serious' or 'nonserious' according to the usual criteria.  
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are AEs that are associated with the use of the drug and are serious and unexpected.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events of Special Interest  
AEs of special interest in this study include the following : 
1. Anaphylaxis and serious allergic reactions  
2. Injection site reaction, including erythema, pain, and induration 
3. Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) assessed following Hy’s L aw 
4. Malignancy  
5. Opportunistic infections such as disseminated histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and 
disseminated tuberculosis  
6. Cryptosporidiasis 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Anaphylaxis and  Serious Allergic Reactions  
Anaphylaxis will be defined according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (NIAID/FAAN) criteria.42  In the event of 
anaphylactic reaction or severe/serious hypersensitivity/allergic reaction, the patient must 
discontinue IP and emergency r esuscitation measures implemented.  In case of other mild to 
moderate hypersensitivity reaction, depending on the severity, the investigator may manage in accordance with the standard -of-care.  
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 cr iteria is fulfilled:  
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus, or flushing, swollen lips-tongue- uvula) and at 
least 1 of the following:

2. Two or more of the following that occur ra pi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely allergen for that 
patient (minutes to several hours):  
a. Involvement of the skin- mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen 
lips-tongue-uvula) 
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia) 
c. Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting) 
3. Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several 
hours): 
a. Systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from the 
patient’s baseline  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Injection Site Reactions 
Injection site reactions are to be captured and reported as AEs.  These may include inj ection site 
erythema, pain, and induration.  The investigator should provide a clear description of the observed or reported AE including location and severity.  All concomitant treatments used to treat injection site reactions should be recorded and captu red in the eCRF, together with the AE 
of injection site reactions.   
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_381434] and/or ALT levels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria outlined below in the abse nce of other causes of liver injury 
are considered potential cases of DILI, and as potential Hy’s Law cases, and should always be considered important medical events.   If symptoms compatible with DILI precede knowledge of 
serum chemical test abnormalities,  liver enzyme measurements should be made immediately, 
regardless of when the next visit or monitoring interval is scheduled.  In some cases, symptoms may be an early sign of injury and although typi[INVESTIGATOR_310038], they m ay indicate a need for prompt serum testing.  An increase in liver enzymes 
should be confirmed by a repeated test within [ADDRESS_381435] be reported as SAEs (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 for reporting details).  
BOS161721 [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- 02 
Confidential  Page 88 of 118 Potential DILI is defined as:  
1. ALT or AST elevation > 3 × ULN 
AND  
2. Total bilirubin > 2 × ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatas e) 
AND  
3. No other immediately apparent possible causes of A LT or AST elevation and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre- existing chronic or acute 
liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic 
The patient  should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, include 
laboratory tests, detailed history , and physical assessment.  In addition to repeating 
measurements of AST and ALT, laboratory tests should include albumin, CK, total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, GGT , prothrombin time (PT)/International Normalized Ratio (INR), 
and alkaline phosphatase.  A detailed history, including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen, recreational drug and supplement consumption, family history, occupational exposure, sexual history, travel history, history of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) may be warranted.  All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria 
defined above, with no other cause for liver function test (LFT) abnormal ities identified at the 
time should be considered potential Hy’s Law cases irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the abnormal LFTs.  Such potential Hy’s Law cases should be reported as SAEs. 
Study drug discontinuation is considered if there is marked serum AST or ALT elevation or 
evidence of functional impairment  (as indicated by [CONTACT_310177], which represent 
substantial liver injury ) that is related to study drug.
  Discontinuation of treatment should be 
considered if: 
• ALT or AST > 8 × ULN  
• ALT or AST > 5× ULN for more than [ADDRESS_381436] occur if:   
• ALT or AST >3 × ULN and (total bilirubin  > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5) 
• ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%)

The identification of a malignancy event will be made by [CONTACT_310221].  AEs should be repor ted as serious per the criteria in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
After the first dose of study drug, when there is a decision to biopsy a potentially malignant tumor, lymph node, or other tissue, the investigator and/or consultant(s) should contact [CONTACT_310222].  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_381437].  Patients wi ll be evaluated for 
cryptosporidium in the stool at screening, and as clinically indicated (eg, watery diarrhea) during 
the study.  If a patient develops diarrhea during the study a stool sample must be provided to test 
for ova, parasites, and cryptosporid ium.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of Adverse Events  
AE reporting  will be carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations, including 
regulatory agency and IRB reporting requirements.    
Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for an SAE.  If an SAE occurs, 
expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate, and is further outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS].2. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Reporting of Pregnancy  
As information is available, a pregnancy diagnosed during the study will be reported within 
24 hours to the sponsor via the Pregnancy Notification and Outcome Form, including pregnancy 
in female patients who received study drug and female partners of male study patients who 
received study drug.  The pregnancy should be followed to term and/or outcome and this outcome should also be reported to the sponsor via the Pregnancy Notification and Outcome 
Form .  Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE or SAE unless there is complication.  
In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by [CONTACT_4692] (unless pre -procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and 
the findings are reported). 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an  AE or  SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a live 
born, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.

• Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion 
• Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_381438]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_381439] be made aware 
immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AE information.  This timeframe also applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAE reports as well as to the initial and follow -up reporting of exposure during pregnancy and exposure via breastfeeding 
cases.  In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE immediately (eg, if an outpatient study patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the AE.  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310086].  All SAEs will be recorded from the time of first dose of study drug through the safety follow -up period (up to Day 270).  SAEs  occurring after the 
final follow-up visit and coming to the attention of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310087] (in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_14371]) reasonable causal relationship with 
the study drug. 
As a minimum req uirement, the initial notification should provide the following information: 
• Study number 
• Patient  number 
• Details of the SAE  (verbatim details are sufficient for immediate notification) 
• Criterion for classification as ‘serious’ 
• Causality assessment ( which may be updated in a follow-up report when sufficient

parameters will be collected:  PR interval, QRS interval, RR interval, QT interval, and 
QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF).  
All ECGs must be evaluated by a qualified physician or qualified designee for the presence of abnormalities and will be captured electro nically and retained for future evaluation if required, 
up to the time of the clinical study report ( CSR) completion . 
7.2.5 Physical Examinations 
The full physical examination will be completed at screening and Day 0 .  It includes an 
assessment of general appearance and evaluation of head, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, throat, neck, 
thyroid, lymph nodes, and extremities, and dermatologic, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, 
gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and psychiatric systems . 
The targeted (limited) physical examination will be completed at all other visits as indicated in 
the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 4.3).  It includes evaluation of patient complaints and SLE 
disease -related issues, and will exclude the genitourinary system. 
7.2.6 C-SSRS  
The C- SSRS is a low -burden measure of the spectrum of suicidal ideation and behavior that was 
developed by [CONTACT_310223].  It is a clinical  interview providing a summary of both ideation and 
behavior that can be administered during any evaluation or risk assessment to identify the level and type of suicidality present.  The C-SSRS can also be used during treatment to monitor for clinical wors ening.
43 
The C -SSRS evaluation will be performed as specified in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Section  4.3).  Patients with recent (within the past 12 months) or active suicidal ideation or 
behavior based on patient responding “yes” to question 3, 4, or [ADDRESS_381443] responses to the C- SSRS reviewed in detail to assess patient 
risk, and appropriate consultative mental health services will be provided. 
7.2.7 Injection Site Reactions 
Patients will be monitored for local injection site reactions  as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Section 4.3 ).  Local injection site reactions will be assessed predose and at [ADDRESS_381444]  (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS].3) . 
7.2.8 Immunogenicity

Schedule of Assessments ( Section 4.3 ).  Blood samples (4 mL) to provide approximately 1.5 mL 
BOS161721 [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- [ADDRESS_381445] dose, if a patient  tests positive in the validated confirmatory ADA assay, the 
sample from this patient will be furthe r analyzed in the neutralizing antibody (nAb) assay. 
7.3 Efficacy Assessments  
All efficacy assessments will be performed at times defined in the Schedule of Assessments (Section  4.3). 
7.3.1 SLEDAI -2K 
The SLEDAI -2K is a validated instrument that measures disease activity in SLE patients at the 
time of the visit and in the previous 30 days.  It is a global index and includes 24 clinical and 
laboratory variables that are weighted by [CONTACT_310181], but not by [CONTACT_926].  The total 
score falls between 0 and 105, with higher scores representing increased disease activity.  The 
SLEDAI -2K has been shown to be a valid and reliable disease activity measure in multiple 
patient  groups.  A SLEDAI -2K of 6 or more generally represents moderately to severely active 
disease.
44 
7.3.2 BILAG  2004 
The BILAG -2004 index is an organ- specific 97-question assessment based on the principle of 
the doctor’s intent to treat.  Only clinical features attributable to SLE disease activity are to be 
recorded and based on the patient’s condition in the last 4 weeks compared with the previous 4 weeks.  It will be scored as not present (0), improved (1), the same (2), worse (3), or new (4).  Disease activity is graded separately for 9 body systems to 5 different grades (A to E) as follows: A (“Active”)  is very active disease, B  (“Beware”)  is moderate activity, C 
(“Contentment”) is mild stable disease, D (“Discount”) is inactive now but previously active, and 
E (“Excluded”) indicates the organ was never involved.
[ADDRESS_381446] maintain documentation with descriptive details supporting the BILAG-2004 scoring (eg, chart, worksheet, clinic notes, and l abs) at each visit.  
See APPENDIX  5 for detailed specifications.

Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- 02 
Confidential  Page 94 of 118 7.3.3 PGA of Disease Activity  
The PGA is used to assess investigator’s general impression on the patient’s overall status of 
SLE disease activity  via visual analogue scale (100 mm) with 0 being “very good, asymptomatic 
and no limitation of normal activities” with 100 mm being “most severe possible disease ever 
seen in all SLE patients”.    
When scoring the PGA, the assessor should always look back at the score from the previo us 
visit.  
7.3.4 Composite Endpoints :  SRI -4, SRI-5, SRI- 6, and BICLA Response  
[IP_ADDRESS] SRI-4 Response 
Patient s will be evaluated for SRI- 4 scores at Day 210, with evaluation for sustained reduction of 
oral CS (≤ 10  mg/day and ≤ Day  0 dose) between Day 120 and Day 210. 
The SRI -4 is a composite index of SLE disease improvement that consists of scores derived from 
the SLEDAI -2K and the BILAG 2004 Index.  Response based on the SRI-4 is defined by:  
1) ≥ 4- point reduction in SLEDAI -2K global score, 2) no new severe disease activity (BILAG  A 
organ score) or more than 1 new moderate organ score (BILAG B), and 3) no deterioration from 
baseline in the PGA by ≥ 0.[ADDRESS_381447] improve ments in clinical  and patient-reported outcomes.45  
Each patient, after providing their Day 210 visit  SRI-4 response, will be evaluated as either a 
responder or non-responder.   
[IP_ADDRESS] SRI-5 and SRI -6 Response  
Like the SRI -4, the SRI-5 and SRI-6 are composite indices of SLE disease improvement that 
consists of scores derived from the SLEDAI -2K and the BILAG 2004 Index.  However, the 
SRI-5 and SRI-6 are computed with a minimal three -point or five -point improvement in 
SLEDAI -2K being required, respectively.46 
The SRI -5 and SRI-6 are evaluated for response at Day 180, along with a sustained reduction of 
oral CS (≤ 10  mg/day and ≤ Day  0 dose) between Day 120 and Day 210. 
[IP_ADDRESS] BICLA Response 
The BICLA is a responder index developed to measure response to therapy, and it includes 
scores from the BILAG, SLEDAI -2K, and PGA.  BICLA response is defined as 1) at least 
1 gradation of improvement in baseline BILAG 2004 scores in all body systems with moderate 
disease activity at entry (eg, all B [moderate disease] scores falling to C [mild], or D [no 
activity ]); 2) no new BILAG A or more than 1 new BILAG B scores; 3) no worsening of total 
SLEDAI -2K score from baseline; 4) ≤ 10% deterioration in PGA score  and 5) no treatment 
failure .44  It is driven primarily by [CONTACT_310182], and has been used in Phase 2 and 3 mAb 
studies.47

Confidential  Page 95 of 118 For the endpoints of BICLA respons e at Days 210, 240, and 270, patient scores will be 
completed and response determined. 
7.3.5  CLASI Response  
The CLASI is a comprehensive tool for assessment of disease activity and damage in cutaneous 
lupus, shown to be valid, reliable, and sensitive to changes in disease activity. 48  Response is 
defined as 50%  improvement from baseline in “A” or “B” scores.  This assessment will be 
applied to all patients as all are required to have cutaneous disease activity . 
For the secondary efficacy endpoint of CLASI response at Day 210, patient scores on MAD and 
POC studie s will be compared with baseline for 50% improvement. 
7.3.[ADDRESS_381448], hand, knee joints.  Joints of the feet are excluded. 
7.4 Other Variables  
7.4.1 SLICC/ACR Damage Index  
The SLICC/ACR damage index is a validated instrument to assess damage, defined as 
irreversible impairment, continuously persistent for 6 months (ascertained by [CONTACT_13113]), occurring since the onset of lupus, and it is based  on a weighted scoring system.
  
This index records damage occurring in patients with SLE regardless of cause, with demonstrated content, face, criterion, and discriminant validity.
49  It will be performed on Days 0 
and 180. 
7.4.2 PROs  
Patients should be encouraged to complete the PROs at the clinic at the beginning of the study 
visit prior to any clinical assessments.  A member of the staff should be available if a patient 
requires further instruction and to review the PRO questionnaires for completeness prior to 
leaving the clinic.  The PROs include the  and the  and will be assessed as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 4.3).

9.2 Statistical Methods  
9.2.1 Analysis Populations  
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the full analysis set (FAS), defined to be all patients with at least [ADDRESS_381454] -baseline efficacy evaluation.  A per protocol (PP) 
analysis set may be defined to exclude major protocol violations fro m the efficacy analysis.  The 
PP Population will include all patients from the FAS except those with major violations to the protocol deemed to impact the analysis of the primary endpoint.  These violations will be identified based on blinded data prior to unblinding the final analysis dataset.  Safety analyses will be based on all patients who receive test treatment.  Pharmacokinetic analysis will be conducted on the PK analysis set (PK), defined as the FAS with sufficient concentration data for the calcul ation of PK parameters.  All analyses will combine data from the MAD and POC 
studies and focus on the active treatment dose chosen for the POC study versus placebo.  The 0.05 1- sided type 1 error level is included for POC, and the 0.025 1-sided type 1 erro r level for 
potential use of this trial to support regulatory filing.

the eCRF data should indicate the patient’s participation in the study and should document the 
dates and details of study procedures, AEs, and patient  status.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310096].  Any outstanding entries must be completed immediately after the final examination.  An explanation should be given for all missing data. 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_89018], completenes s, and timeliness of the data 
reported to the Sponsor.  Data collection processes and procedures will be reviewed and 
validated to ensure completeness, accuracy, reliability, and consistency.  A complete audit trail will be maintained of all data changes.  
10.6 Source Documentation  
The documents that will form the source data for the clinical study (eg , patient charts, laboratory 
reports) must be defined and documented in the in- house study master file prior to the start of the 
study.  Data on the eCRFs which will be checked against source data during monitoring visits 
must also be defined and documented in the in-house study master file including the percentage 
of each of the source data to be verified and the percentage of patients’ eCRFs to be monitored.  
10.[ADDRESS_381461] elapsed since 
the formal discontinuation of clinical development of BOS161721.  However, these documents should be retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_200518]. 
11 AUDITING AND MONITORING  
Throughout the course of the study, the study monitor will make frequent contacts with the investigator.  This will include telephone calls and on -site visits.  The study will be routinely 
monitored to ensure compliance with the study protocol and the overall quality of data collected.  During the on- site visits, the eCRFs will be reviewed for completeness and adherence to the 
protocol.  As part of the data audit, source documents will be made available for review by [CONTACT_310304]161721 [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- [ADDRESS_381462].  The study monitor will verify that each patient has proper consent documentation from the patient and/or patient’s authorized representative for study procedures and for the release of medical records to the sponsor, FDA, other regulatory authorities, and the IRB.  The study monitor will also verify that assent was obtained for patients not capable of providing informed consent or that 
documentation is provided by [CONTACT_310227].  The investigator or appointed delegate will receive the study monitor during these on- site 
visits and will cooperate in providing the documents for inspection and respond to inquiries.  In addition, the investigator will permit inspection of the study files by [CONTACT_76782].  On completion of the study, the study monitor will arrange for a final review of the study files after which the files should be secured for the appropriate time period.  
Throughout the course of the study, the medical monitor will determine eligibility of all screened patients, will address any medical issues t hat might arise, clarify medical questions, review 
patient safety data (eg, AE/SAE, laboratory, and ECG),  and partner with the study team in the 
overall study management.  The study medical monitoring plan will document additional details of the study medical oversight and monitoring. 
[ADDRESS_381463] to patient s may be implemented immediately, provided the IRB/IEC is 
notified within [ADDRESS_381464] be submitted to the IRB/IEC and the investigator must await approval before implementing the changes.  [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals will submit protocol amendments to the 
appropriate regulatory authorities for approval. 
If in the judgment of the IRB/IEC, the investigator, and/or [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, the 
amendment to the protoc ol substantially changes the study design and/or increases the potential 
risk to the patient  and/or has an impact on the patient 's involvement as a study participant, the 
currently approved written ICF  will require similar modification.  In such cases, inf ormed 
consent will be renewed for patient s enrolled in the study before continued participation.

Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- [ADDRESS_381476] the health of the people.  The physician’s knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty. 
The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association binds the physician with the 
words, "The health of my subject will be my first consideration," and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, "A physician shall act only in the subject's interest when providing medical care which might have the effect of weakening the physical and mental condition of the 
subject." 
Medical progress is based on research, which ultimately must rest in part on experimentation 
involving human subjects. 
In medical research on human subjects, considerations related to the well -being of the human 
subject should take precedence over the interests of science and society.  
The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to improve prophylactic, 
diagnostic, and therapeutic procedures and the understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of disease.  Even the best -proven prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods must 
continuously be challenged through research for their effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility,  and 
quality. 
BOS161721 [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- [ADDRESS_381477] involving human subjects should be preceded by [CONTACT_310305]161721 [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- [ADDRESS_381478]’s information and to minimize the impact of the study on the subject's physical and mental integrity and on the personality of the subject.  
In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail.  The subject should be informed of the right to abstain from participation in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal.  After ensuring that the subject has understood the information, the physician should then obtain the subject's freely-given informed consent, preferably in writing.  If the consent cannot be obtained in writing, the non- written 
consent must be formally documented and witnessed. 
When obtaining informed consent for the research project the physician should be particularly 
cautious if the subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under 
duress.  In that case the informed consent should be obtained by a well-informed physician who 
is not engaged in the investigation and who is completely independent of this relationship. 
For a research subject who is legally incompetent, physically or mentally incapable of giving 
consent or is a legally incompetent minor, the investigator must obtain informed consent from the legally authorized representative in accordance with applicable law.  These groups should not be included in research unless the research is necessary to promote the health of the population represented and this research cannot instead be performed on legally competent persons.  
When a subject deemed legally incompetent, such as a minor child, is able to give assent to decisions about participation in research, the investigator must obtain that assent in addition to the consent of the legally authorized representative.  
Research on individuals from whom it is not possible to obtain consent, including proxy or advance consent, should be done only if the physical/mental condition that prevents obtaining 
BOS161721 [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- [ADDRESS_381479] be free to use unproven or new prophylactic, diag nostic, and therapeutic measures, if in the 
physician’s judgment it offers hope of saving life, re- establishing health, or alleviating suffering.  
Where possible, these measures should be made the object of research, designed to evaluate their safety and efficacy.  In all cases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, published.  The other relevant guidelines of this Declaration should be followed.

Title:  A Randomized  Double -Blind Phase  1b/2 Combined Staggered 
Multiple Dose Escalation Study of BOS161721 in Systemic Lupus 
Erythematosus (SLE)  Patients on a Background of Limited Standard 
of Care  
Indication  Adults with moderately to severely active SLE  
Background and 
Rationale SLE is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease with considerable 
heterogeneity in clinical manifestations and disease course.  There is 
evidence that B - and T- cells are critical to the development of the 
disease, and that T -cell-derived cytokines such as interleukin -21 
(IL-21) are involved in the SLE- associated inflammatory 
pathological response.   
BOS161721 is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) triple 
mutation monoclonal antibody (mAb) intended to have an extended terminal elimination half-life (t
1/2) that selectively binds to and 
neutralizes  IL-21, which acts on multiple cell types that drive  
inflammation and autoimmunity.  In vivo, BOS161721 inhibits 
T-cell dependent antigen responses of B- cells and is being developed 
as a potential  treatment for adult s with moderately to severely active 
SLE.    
No
nclinical studies have evaluated  the toxi city, pharmacodynamics 
(PD), toxicokinetics (TK), pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of BOS161721 administered intravenously (IV) and subcutaneously (SC).  The no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) in Cynomolgus monkeys were determined to be 
100 mg/kg IV and 50 mg/kg SC, the highest doses tested.  No SC animals had injection reactions.  
In a Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) study, BOS161721 was administered IV and SC to healthy male and female adult subjects.  
This double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated 8 ascending dose levels  (1 [IV], 3 [SC], 10 [SC], 22 [IV], 30 [SC], 60 [S C], 
120 [SC], or 240 [SC] mg ) for safety, tolerability, PK, PD and 
immunogenicity .  Overall, there were no clinically significant safety 
or tolerability findings from this study.  
Results from the Phase 1 SAD study informed  the dose regimens 
used for the multiple ascending doses (MAD) Phase 1b study in this 
trial.  The MAD study will involve 3 cohorts.  The Phase 2 portion 
will be a proof of concept (POC) study, where dose selection will be based on the sponsor ’s assessment of safety, tolerability, 
immunoge nicity , and PK and PD data from the MAD study of

will each contain 12 patient s, including 9 active and 3 placebo 
patient s.  Dose selection for each cohort is based on 90- day safety, 
tolerability, PK , and PD  data review  from the Phase 1 SAD study 
(BOS161721-01) in healthy subjects .  Each of the 3  doses (20 mg, 
60 mg, and 120 mg) selected for the MAD study are projected not to 
exceed the mean peak levels or exposures of that achieved in the 
SAD study following the single  [ADDRESS_381485] completed 2 weeks of 
follow-up after the second dose, Cohort 2 begins dosing (after a data 
monitoring committee [DMC ] evaluat es the safety and tolerability 
data from  Cohort 1) .  Similarly, after [ADDRESS_381486] completed 2 weeks of foll ow-up 
after the second dose, Cohort 3 begins dosing (based on the dose 
level determined after DMC evaluation of the safety and tolerability data from Cohort 2 and Cohort 1).  Two  weeks after the last patient 
in Cohort [ADDRESS_381487] interim analysis (IA1) to determine which dose 
will be carried forward into the POC Phase 2 study .  This POC dose 
decision  will be  based on evaluation of the PK , safety (inclusive of 
dose- limiting toxicity [DLT]) , and tolerability data (and available 
PD/biomarker data) from Cohorts 1, 2 and 3; this dose will not exceed doses tested during the MAD study .  The DMC will  be 
review ing all relevant data from Cohorts 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_381488] patient in Cohort 3 reaches 60 days (dose 2).  Once the POC dose decision has been made, screening for the POC study can begin. 
For the POC study, 156 patient s will be randomized to active or 
placebo groups in a 2:1 ratio.  As in the MAD study, ea ch patient  in 
the POC study may receive a total of 7 SC monthly doses on Days 1, 
30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180.  A maximum daily dose of 30 mg/day of oral CS will be acceptable for eligibility for the study, however, daily dose must be tapered down to a maximum of 10  mg/day for at 
least 5 days prior to Day 1 (randomization day).  One oral CS “burst ” 
for increased SLE disease activity may occur  during the study either 
between Weeks 1 and 8 or between Weeks 16 and 20.  Tapering of 
steroids during the course of the study will be encouraged and should be evaluated at all visits.   Tapering may occur  after randomization 
except within 8  weeks of the primary (Week  28) and secondary 
(Week 16) endpoint assessments.  Between Week 8 and Week  16, 
and between Week 20 and Week 2 8, oral corticosteroid ( OCS ) doses 
must be held constant  otherwise the patient  will be declared a

Data from  60 patients, including the 12 from the MAD study, or 
6 fewer if the low dose is chosen, who are in the cohort of the chosen 
dose for the PO C study who complete 3 months of treatment will be 
used in a second  IA (IA2)  at Week 16 to assess if the trial could stop 
for an early futility conclusion.  If futility is not claimed in the IA 2, 
the POC study will continue to 156 patients . 
Following the 6-month treatment period, primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be assessed for each patient, after providing their 24- week disease activity assessments .  DMC monitoring will be 
conducted periodically throughout the study as described in the DMC charter .

1.1 Indication 
BOS161721 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb), which binds to and inhibits 
interleukin -21 (IL-21) bioactivity, and is being develope d for the treatment of moderately to 
severely active systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) in adults.  
1.[ADDRESS_381504] common cause of death during later disease.2   
The reported prevalence of SLE in the [LOCATION_002] (US) is 20 to 70 cases  per 100,000 people.3  
More than 90% of cases of SLE occur in women, frequent ly starting at childbearing age.   
Women of color  are disproportionately affected by [CONTACT_113919].  This suggests multiple genetic and 
environmental factors are at play.  Accordingly, a multifactorial view of the 
immunopathogenesis of SLE suggests more than [ADDRESS_381505], including breach in central tolerance in the adaptive arm of the immune system, peripheral amplification of the autoimmune response by [CONTACT_310147], and local processes in the target organ that facilitate end-organ disease.

1.2.2 B
OS161721 Development  
[LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals is develo pi[INVESTIGATOR_310031]161721 for the treatment of SLE .  BOS161721 is a 
humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) mAb directed against human IL-21.   
Murine mAb 19E3, the progenitor of BOS161721, was generated using mouse hybridoma technology.  19E3 has subpi[INVESTIGATOR_36379] (pM) affini ty to human IL-21 and was selected for its potent 
neutralization of IL-21 bioactivity.  BOS161721 was generated by [CONTACT_310148] 19E3 where its complementarity-determining regions were grafted onto a human IgG1 kappa backbone.  The fragment crystallizable (Fc) portion of BOS161721 contains a YTE (M252Y/S254T/T256E triple mutation) in the constant domain of the IgG1 heavy chain that was introduced into the parental molecule, 19E3, intended to prolong the in vivo terminal elimination half-life ( t
1/2) of the mAb.5  Thus, BOS161721 retains sub-pM binding to IL-21 and prevents 
IL-21 from binding to the IL-21 receptor (IL-21R), inhibiting IL-21 bioactivity.   
BOS161721  [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- 02 
Confidential  Page 28 of 113 BOS161721 binds to human IL-21 and Cynomolgus monkey IL-21, which are highly 
homologous, and neutralizes the bioactivity of both.  BOS161721 is specific for IL-21 as it does 
not bind to or inhibit the other gamma- chain (γc) family  of cytokines , and acts to specifically 
neutralize the IL -[ADDRESS_381506].  In in vitro  studies, BOS161721 inhibited downstream IL-21-
induced signaling, IL-21- induced plasma cell differentiation , and IL -21-induced natural killer 
(NK) cell activation.  In in vivo  studies, BOS161721 significantly inhibited the T- cell dependent 
antibody response (TDAR) to immunization with a protein antigen as well as B -cell expansion 
following a second protein antigen immunization in Cynomolgus monkeys.    
[IP_ADDRESS] Interleukin -[ADDRESS_381507] cytokines in this family are critically important for both 
the maintenance and function of T- cell and B -cell responses.  IL -21 signals through a receptor 
complex consisting of its own private receptor, the IL-21R and γc.6,7  Engagement of the 
IL-21R/γc complex leads to the activation of several signaling pathways, including the Janus 
kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription, mitogen -activated protein kinase ( MAPK) 
and phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathways.[ADDRESS_381508] array of cell types, including B- cells, T -cells, NK -cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, 
as well as other hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells such as fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and 
intestinal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663].9,11  Activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 
(STAT3 ) via phosphorylation is critical in regulating human B- cell responses to IL -2112; 
phosphorylated STAT3  (pSTAT3) forms a homodimer, which translocates to the nucleus where 
it initiates transcription of the IL -21 gene , forming  an autocrine loop for IL-21 production via 
STAT3 phosphorylation.13  In addition, IL-21 has been shown to upregulate expression of its 
own receptor14 and induces an autocrine feedback loop.15 
IL-21 modulates various aspects of immune function.  It promotes cluster of differentiation 4 
(CD4+ ) T-cell differentiation and promotes the generation of T- helper (Th)1716 and T- follicular 
helper (Tfh) cells.15,17  In mice, IL -21 has been shown to regulate the balance between Th17 and 
regulatory T- cell (Treg), in that it increases Th17, while inhibiting Treg differentiation.[ADDRESS_381509] disease induced by [CONTACT_74934] T- cells.20  IL-21 upregulates CD8+ 
T-cell and NK -cell expansion and cytolytic activity by [CONTACT_310149] B and perforin.21,22  
IL-21 also has been reported to increase granzyme B in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B- cells 
resulting in inhibition of T- cell responses.23,24  IL-21 also has a variety of effects on 
nonhematopoietic cells, such as stromal cells and induces inflammation through matrix metalloproteinase release by [CONTACT_310207].
25 
One principal non-redundant role of IL-21 is the promotion of B- cell activation, differentiation , 
or death during humoral immune responses.14  Furthermore, increased IL-21 production is 
characteristic of several autoimmune diseases and is likely to contribute to autoantibody production as well as pathologic features of autoimmune disease.
 26  The critical role of IL -21 in 
promoting humoral and other immune responses makes it an important focus of potential

driving the autoantibody production through its role in plasma cell differentiation.  Importantly, Tfh cell populations are expanded in patient s with autoimmune diseases such as lupus, bullous 
pemphigoid, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and primary Sjögren’s syndrome ( pSS) an d have been 
reported to correlate with IL -[ADDRESS_381510] elevated IL -21 
plasma levels that correlate with the severity of the disease.  Recently, genome- wide association 
studies (GWAS) have provided convincing evidence that the chromosomal 4q 27 region harbors the IL -21 genes and is associated with chronic inflammatory disorders, including SLE .

[IP_ADDRESS] Preclinical Studies  
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of BOS161721 were characterized following single-dose intravenous 
(IV) administration of BOS161721 (0.01 to 30 mg/kg) in male Cynomolgus monkeys or repeat, every 2  weeks IV administration (15 to 100 mg/kg) and subcutaneous (SC) administration 
(50 mg/kg) in male and female Cynomolgus monkeys.  Systemic exposure was approximately 
dose-proportional within the tested dose range.  SC bioavailability was determined to be 64.3%.  
 
 
Two single-dose (IV) non-good laboratory practice (GLP) studies conducted in Cynomolgus monkeys evaluated the toxicity, pharmacodynamics (PD), toxicokinetics (TK), and immunogenicity of BOS161721.  Following a single IV administration (slow bolus), there were no BOS161721- related adverse changes, resulting in a no -observed -adverse- effect -level 
(NOAEL) value of 30  mg/kg, the highest dose tested among 2 studies.   
 
In a repeat -dose GLP toxicology study in Cynomolgus monkeys, BOS161721 was administered 
every 2  weeks by [CONTACT_310152] (50 mg/kg) administration for 3  months (a total of 7 doses).

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Studies  
BOS161721-01 was a double-blind, Phase 1, single ascending dose (SAD) study to assess the 
safety, PK , and PD of BOS161721 in healthy subjects.  The primary objective of the study was 
to characterize the safety and tolerability of IV and SC SADs  of BOS161721 in an otherwise 
healthy subject population without concomitant illnesses, immune abnormalities, or concomitant 
medications.  Secondary objectives included characterization of the PK and immunogenicity of 
BOS161721, and exploratory objectives included the evaluation of the effect of BOS161721 on TDAR to keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( KLH ) (primary and secondary immunizations) in healthy 
subjects, the effects of BOS161721 on plasma levels of IL -21 (fre e and bound), and the 
evaluation of the effect of BOS161721 on IL-21 gene expression (via gene signature) in blood.  
This study consist ed of 8 cohorts.  Subjects were randomized in a 3:1 ratio (BOS161721: 
placebo) and received either a single dose of BOS16 1721 (1 [IV] , 3 [SC] , 10 [SC] , 22 [IV], 
30 [SC] , 60 [SC] , 120 [SC],  or 240 [SC]  mg) or placebo , with safety follow -up.  For the first 
cohort, after the first 2  subjects were dosed (1 active and 1  placebo), there was a minimum gap of 
[ADDRESS_381511] 7  days of safety and tolerability data by [CONTACT_310153] 
(SDMT).   
Blood samples were collected at every in -house study visit for BOS161721 concentration 
determin ations.  Blood samples were also collected for determination of IL-21 plasma  levels 
(free and total).  Safety was assessed based on the occurrence of treatment -emergent AEs, 
hepatic function abnormality,  and acute and delayed hypersensitivity reactions.  O ther safety 
variables included electrocardiograms ( ECGs ), vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and 
temperature), safety laboratory assessments, blood sampling for ADAs, total IgG and IgM levels, 
CD4+ count, and full and targeted physical examinations.   Overall, there were no clinically 
significant findings from this study; there were no serious adverse events ( SAEs ), deaths, or 
discontinuations due to AEs during the study, AEs reported as related to the study drug, particularly infections (flu -like symptoms, etc), were expected for the compound, and there were 
no clinically relevant changes in laboratory  and ECG  results or vital signs.  PK data from the 
SAD study demonstrates BOS161721 has an extended t
1/2 (provisional single dose data indicates 
this to  be approximately 42-46 days) which supports evaluation of monthly dosing.

Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- [ADDRESS_381512] been selected for the multiple ascending dose ( MAD) Phase 1 study based on a 
90-day safety, tolerability, PK , and PD data review from the  Phase 1  SAD study 
(BOS161721-01); t he SDMT reviewed the blinded safety data from subjects for each  dose cohort 
(8 cohorts, evaluating 1 [IV] , 3 [SC] , 10 [SC] , 22 [IV], 30 [SC] , 60 [SC] , 120 [SC] , or 
240 [SC]  mg), along with the accumulated safety and available PK /PD data from all subjects in 
the previous dose cohorts, to make a decision on whether to proceed to the next higher dose 
level, repeat a dose level , or stop dose escalation.   Overall, there were no clinically significant 
safety or tolerability findings from this study.  
Based on the Day -90 interim cut of the PK and biomarker data in the BOS161721-01 study, the 
recommended doses for evaluation in the MAD phase of this study are 20, 60, and 120 mg SC monthly.  This dose recommendation is supported by [CONTACT_310296]161721 resulting in a median T
max of 6 days and an apparent terminal half-life of 44 days.  Furthermore, 
pSTAT 3 suppression, a marker of IL- 21 target engagement, follows a similar time course of the 
mAb levels, with maximal and sustained suppression apparent with doses greater than 30 mg SC (Figure 1).

into the POC  Phase 2 study .  This POC dose decis ion will be based on evaluation of the PK , 
safety (inclusive of dose- limiting toxicity [DLT]) , and tolerability data ( and available 
PD/biomarker data) from Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 during the MAD study.  T hereafter, DMC 
monitoring will be conducted periodically throughout the study as described in the DMC charter.  
With the agreement of the DMC and sponsor, this schedule may be modified depending on the 
rate of patient  accrual.   Additional details can be found in the DMC Charter. 
The benefit of participation for all patient s in this study is close monitoring of their medical 
condition and safety of their treatment.  Those randomized to the active treatment arm may potentially experience improvement in their  SLE  disease.  Those randomized to the placebo (in 
combination with standard of care) arm are not expected to obtain any additional benefit, beyond those of their background treatment, though close monitoring of their medical condition and safety may itself be associated with improving their SLE .   
1.2.5 Potential Risk s 
Potential risks based on the m echanism of action of  BOS161721 include inf ections, risks 
associ ated with the administration of a ny foreign protein or biolog ic agent, including injection 
site r eaction, anaphy laxis, serious allerg ic reaction,  and development of AD As.  ADAs  could 
result in immune complex disea se (with mani festations su ch as arthra lgias, s erum-sickn ess, and 
vasculiti s), autoim munity, or altered BOS161721 leve ls or activity.  Further details can be found

Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- 02 
Confidential  Page 33 of 113 in the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for BOS161721, which contains comprehensive 
toxicology, preclinical and clinical information on BOS161721. 
Two investigational drug products are considered to be in the same pharmacological class as BOS161721 based on interruption of signaling through the IL-[ADDRESS_381516].  No potential risk generalizable across the class has been observed with these investigational products.  Based on the clinical Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721- 01), AEs reported as related t o 
the study drug, particularly infections (flu -like symptoms, etc), were expected for the compound, 
and there were no clinically relevant changes in laboratory and ECG results or vital signs.  
The majority of IgG elimination occurs via intracellular catabolism, following fluid -phase or 
receptor -mediated endocytosis.  This type of endocytosis and elimination is a form of 
target -mediated disposition where the interaction of the drug and its pharmacological target 
(eg, a target receptor) serves as a significan t contributor to the kinetics of antibody distribution 
and elimination.  Renal elimination, which is a primary pathway of clearance of small- molecule 
drugs, is relatively unimportant for IgG, as its large size prevents efficient filtration through the 
glom erulus.  Secretion into the bile is an important pathway of elimination of IgA antibodies, but 
this route is not a significant contributor to the elimination of IgG antibodies.  Thus, risk to renal and hepatic systems due to metabolism of BOS161721 is low.

[IP_ADDRESS] Anaphylaxis and Serious Allergic Reactions  
As with the administration of any foreign protein and/or other biological agents, acute hypersensitivity reactions, including acute anaphylactic/hypersensitivity, severe allergic, and anaphylactoid reactions may  follow infusion of mAbs and can be caused by [CONTACT_62535].  
These acute hypersensitivity reactions may be severe and result in death.  
Anaphylaxis will be defined according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/Food Allergy and  Anaphylaxis Network (NIAID/FAAN) criteria ,
34 and are discussed in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].1. 
Based on the limited Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), anaphyl axis and serious allergic 
reactions in subjects who received BOS161721 was not observed.   
Patients with a known history of allergy or severe hypersensitivity reaction to any component of 
BOS161721 formulation or patients with a history of anaphylaxis to a ny other biological therapy 
such as mAbs will be excluded from studies with BOS161721.  In addition, appropriate drugs and medical equipment to treat acute hypotensive, bronchoconstrictive, or anaphylactic reactions will be immediately available at the unit and study personnel will be trained to recognize and treat these reactions.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Injection Site Reactions  
In a repeat -dose GLP toxicology study in Cynomolgus monkeys, BOS161721 was administered 
every 2  weeks by [CONTACT_310152] (50 mg/kg) for 3  months (a total of 7 doses); no SC animals had 
injection reactions.

Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- 02 
Confidential  Page 34 of 113 Based on the Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), incidence of injection site reactions in 
subjects who received BOS161721 was similar  to placebo .   
Patients will be monitored for local injection site reactions in this study.  See Section 7.2.7.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Immune Complex Disease  
The potential risk of immu ne complex disease for BOS161721 is theoretical, based on the known 
risks associated with mAbs.  The administration of a mAb can result in the formation of ADAs.  Administration of the mAb in the presence of ADA may result in the formation of circulating antibody-antigen complexes potentially resulting in altered BOS161721 levels or activity or deposition of the complexes in microvasculature.  Complement is frequently involved in the latter setting, and the breakdown products of complement attract polymorphonuclear leukocytes to the site of deposition where they can provoke local tissue damage through specific or nonspecific release of enzymes.  Two of the more common end-organ targets are the blood vessels (vasculitis) and kidney (nephritis).  These clinica l manifestations represent immune 
complex disease or Type III hypersensitivity.  Although BOS161721 is a humanized mAb, ADAs may develop; however, the likelihood of occurrence of immune complex disease with BOS161721 is low.  The findings of immune complex disease are typi[INVESTIGATOR_310078]- antigen complexes are cleared from the body . 
Based on the limited Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), immune complex disease in subjects 
who received BOS161721 was not observed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Infections  
BOS161721 is expected to diminish the activity of T- cell, B -cell and NK -cell lines.  Like other 
medications modulating immune response, BOS161721 may increase the potential risk for 
infection, including serious infections.  IL-21 produced by [CONTACT_398]4+ Th cells is required to sustain the anti -viral function of CD8+ T-cells against chronic viral infections.  Nonclinical evidence 
suggests that the risk of chronic viral infection recurrence or increased severity may occur with IL-21 inhibition.
35 
These conditions will be fully characterized with clinical descriptions and routine laboratory and/or specialty testing and treated where indicated with appropriate local standard of care.  
Patients with a history of opportunistic infection, including recurrent or severe disseminated herpes zoster or disseminated herpes simplex  within the last 3 years , or any other underlying 
pathology predisposing to serious infection, are excluded from studies with BOS161721 (for further details please refer to the current IB for BOS161721). 
Patients will be assessed for hepatitis B, and C, and HIV-1/[ADDRESS_381517] been observed in immunosuppressed liver transplant and human immunodeficiency virus patients.

BOS161721  [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- 02 
Confidential  Page 35 of 113 BOS161721 is expected to diminish the immunosurveillance activity of T -cell, B -cell, and 
NK-cell lines, a similar risk is biologically plausible with prolonged exposure to BOS161721. 
Since the risk of opportunistic cryptosporidium infection increases with low levels of 
CD4+  T-cells,37 patients with a CD4+ count < 500 cell/mm3 were excluded from the Phase 1 
SAD study (BOS161721-01), and will be excluded from the proposed MAD/POC studies.  Patients exposed to investigational product who develop diarrhea during the course of the study 
should immediately undergo an assessment for opportunistic infection including stool for ova and parasites and stool examination for cryptosporidium.  Positive cryptosporidium in stool sample at screening is an exclusion.  Treatment by [CONTACT_310297]. 
Based on the limited Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), infections in subjects who received 
BOS161721 was not observed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Malignancy 
The stimulatory effect of IL -21 on NK cells and CD8+ T-cells suggests the cytokine may have 
anti-tumor activity.  Nonclinical studies have demonstrated significant anti- tumor effects of 
IL-21 in a number of tumor models.  IL- 21 therapy of human metastatic melanoma and renal cell 
carcinoma has demonstrated POC with significant increases in levels of perforin, granzyme B, 
and interferon gamma (IFNγ) expression in CD8+ T- cells and NK  T-cells.  Clinical response has 
been limited in these generally unmanageable diseases.  
The impact of treatment with anti- IL-21 therapy on the development or growth of malignancies 
is not known; however, as with other immunomodulatory biologic agents, treatment with BOS161721 may result in an increase in the risk of malignancies.  NK cell suppression by [CONTACT_8668]-[ADDRESS_381518] 5 years, with the ex ception 
of non- melanoma skin cancer or cervical cancer in situ treated with apparent suc cess wi th 
curative the rapy, are excluded from the study. 
Based on the limited Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), malignancy in subjects who received 
BOS161721 was not observed.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatic Function Abnormality  
There is no substantial evidence suggesting BOS161721 is associated with liver function 
abnormality.  However as a precaution, patients with a history of abnormal alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT)  and/or aspartate amin otransferase (AST), or bilirubin at screening 
(ALT /AST  > 2 × upper limit of normal [ ULN ]; total bilirubin >  1.5 × [ULN] and judged by [CONTACT_119278]) were excluded from the Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), and will be excluded from the MAD study.  Patients with a positive hepatitis B or C test or a history of alcohol dependence will also be excluded. 
Based on the limited Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), hepatic function abnormality in 
subjects who received BOS161721 was not observed.

Confidential  Page 36 of 113 [IP_ADDRESS] Failure of Vaccination 
IL-21 is a key cytokine in development of B- cells into immunoglobulin -secreting plasma cells.  
Abnormal signaling through the IL-21R/Janus Kinase (JAK)3/signal transducer and activator of 
transcription ( STAT3 ) pathway leads to defective humoral immune responses to both 
T-dependent and T-independent antigens and impairs the establishment of long- lasting B -cell 
memory.  Abnormal signaling through the pathway has been related to decreased specific antibody responses following vaccination, and to increased susceptibility to encapsulated bacterial infections.
[ADDRESS_381519] of BOS161721 was evaluated in in vivo single dose studies in Cynomolgus monkey in which the animals received vaccination to T -cell dependent KLH antigen to stimulate a TDAR.  
These in vivo studies demonstrated that BOS161721 significantly inhibited B- cell proliferation 
and IgG antibody responses to the KLH protein antigen; however, it is worth noting that 
BOS161721 administration did not produce any remarkable changes in anti-KLH antibody data for IgM, IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4 or anti-tetanus toxoid ( TT) antibody data for IgM, IgG, IgG1, or 
IgE during the dosing phase in the same study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Potential for Drug -Drug Interactions  
Drug -drug interactions were not evaluated in th e Phase 1 SAD study (BOS161721-01), which 
included only healthy adult subjects.  Use of prescription medications (with the exceptions of 
oral contraceptives), and over -the-counter (OTC) treatments including herbal supplements such 
as St John’s Wort (except multivitamins), in the 2 weeks prior to screening was prohibited in the SAD study .   
See Section 5.5 for other specific exclusion criteria which support lowered risk of interactions, 
and Section 5.6.1 for corticosteroid ( CS) dosing.  In addition, S ection  [IP_ADDRESS] describes 
considerations for hepatic function for this study.

the MAD study are projected not to exceed the mean peak levels or exposures of that achieved in 
the SAD  study.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Esc alation for the MAD Study   
The MAD study design is staggered , where after the [ADDRESS_381525] completed 2 weeks of follow-up after the second dose, Cohort 2 begins dosing (after 
DMC evaluation of the safety and tolerability data from Cohort 1) .  Similarly, after  [ADDRESS_381526] completed 2 weeks of follow- up after the 
second dose, Cohort 3 begins dosing (based on the dose level determined after DMC evaluation of the safety and tolerability data from Cohorts 1 and 2).  Two  weeks after the last  patient in

will continue at their assigned dose level through the ir respective  6-month treatmen t periods (See 
Study Schematic, Section  4.1).   If > 3 patients discontinue the study in a cohort, he/she will be 
replaced.  
Criteria for dose escalation are further described in the DMC Charter.  See Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for 
additional details  about DLTs.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Limiting T oxicity (DLT)  
Severity of adverse events will be graded according to National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE ) version 4.03.  For the purpose of dose 
escalation, any of the following AEs occurring after study drug administrati on, which are 
attributable to the study drug, will be considered DLTs: 
Hematologic: 
• Grade 4 neutropenia; 
• Grade 3 neutropenic infection; 
• Grade 3  thrombocytopenia with bleeding; 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia.

modifications/adjustments must be clearly documented in the patient's source notes and electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ). 
[IP_ADDRESS] DMC Recommendations   
During scheduled meetings, the DMC will review relevant study data for safety or benefit- risk 
concern.  During th e MAD study, t he DMC may provide the following recommendation s to the 
sponsor: 
• Expanding a cohort at a specific dosing level, or repeating a lower dose in a subsequent 
cohort; 
• Continuing a dose level for a given cohort; 
• Escalating a dose level  for a subsequent cohort; 
• Termination of current or previous cohort(s). 
Further dosing in a given cohort will be halted if [ADDRESS_381530] into the POC Phase 2 study.  This POC dose decision will be based on evaluation of the PK, safety (inclusive of dose- limiting toxicity 
[DLT]), and tolerability data (and available PD/biomarker data) from Cohorts 1, 2, and 3; this dose will not exceed doses tested during the MAD study.  The DMC will be reviewing all relevant data from Cohorts 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_381531] patient in Cohort 3 reaches 60 days (dose  2).  Details are provided in the DMC Char ter.  
4.1.2 POC  Phase 2  Study  
[IP_ADDRESS] BOS161721 Dose  
The optimal dose evaluation is chosen based on MAD Phase 1 b safety results .  The  dose will be 
communicated by a letter to site investigator s participating in  the POC Phase 2 study, and to the 
IRB/ IEC.  Once the POC dose decision has been made, screening for the POC study can begin. 
[IP_ADDRESS] POC Study Design 
For t he POC study,  156 patient s will be randomized to active or placebo groups in a 2:1  ratio.   
BOS161721  [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- 02 
Confidential  Page 44 of 113 As in the MAD study , each patient  in the POC study may receive a total of 7 SC monthly doses 
of study drug on Days 1, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180.  Assessments will be completed 
according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Section  4.3).   Dose selection will be based on the 
sponsor’s assessment of safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and PK and PD data from the MAD study of 30 patients treated with BOS161721/placebo. 
Data from  approximately 60 patients (including the 12 from the MAD study, or 6 fewer if the 
low dose is chosen who are in the cohort of the chosen dose for the POC study ) who complete 
3 months of treatment will be used in  the IA2 at Week 16 to assess if the tri al could stop for an 
early futility conclusion (see Section 9.3 for details regarding the IA).  If futility is not claimed in 
the IA 2, the POC study will continue to 156 patients.  
Following the 6 -month treatment period , primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be 
assessed for each patient after providing their 24- week disease activity assessments.      
DMC monitoring will be conducted periodically throughout the study as described in the DMC 
charter .

patients participating in the study may use hormone-based contraceptives as 1 of the 
acceptable methods of contraception since they will not be receiving study drug. 
• IUDs, such as ParaGard®; 
• Vasectomy;  
• Complete abstinence, defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual intercourse, is an 
acceptable form of contraception.  Women who are abstinent while participating in the study 
must continue to have pregnancy tests.  Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the event that the patient chooses to forego complete abstinence.  
Azoospermic men and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt from contraceptive requirements.  However, they must still undergo pregnancy testing.

6.5 Premature Discontinuation  
While patient s are encouraged to complete all study evaluations, they may withdraw from the 
study at any time and for any reason.  Every effort will be made to determine why any patient  
withdraws from the study prematurely.  If the patient is unreachable by [CONTACT_756], a registered 
letter, at the minimum, should be sent to the patient requesting him/h er to contact [CONTACT_3652].  
All patient s who withdraw from the study with an ongoing AE or SAE must be followed until 
the end of study or until the event is resolved or deemed stable , respectively .   
If a patient  withdraws prematurely after dosing, an end of treatment (EO T) visit should be 
performed (Visit 10 ) and a last follow-up visit 90 days after dosing  should be scheduled 
(Visit 13).  S afety follow -up visit procedures based on the Schedule of Assessments ( see

7.2.1 Laboratory As sessments  
Laboratory tests will be performed at times defined in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Section  4.3).  Patient  eligibility will be determined based on these tests at screening.  
Unscheduled clinical labs may be obtained at any time during the study to assess any perceived safety concerns.  
A central laboratory will be used  (with the exception of urine pregnancy tests and stool analysis) 
to ensure accuracy and consistency in test results.  The central laboratory will transmit all results for protocol tests, scheduled and unscheduled, to the cl inical data base.  Laboratory/analyte 
results that could unblind the study (ie, biomarker results) will not be reported to investigative sites or other blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded.  Urinalysis will be performed on midstream, clean catch specimens.   Some biomarkers listed above will not be drawn at some 
sites due to geographical logistical challenges.  See the laboratory manual for details.

[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy testing  
For WOCBP , a serum pregnancy test will be performed at screening .  Following a negative 
serum pregnancy result at screening,  appropriate contraception must be commenced or 
continued and a further negative urine pregnancy test result s will then be required at the baseline 
visit before the patient  may receive the investigat ional product.  Urine p regnancy tests will also 
be routinely repeated at study drug administration visits (Visits  2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10) prior to 
study drug administration , and additionally whenever [ADDRESS_381565]  or confirmed 
pregnancy , the patient will be withdrawn from study drug but may remain in the study for safety 
monitoring. 
See Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 for information on reporting of pregnancies as AEs/SAEs during the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tuberculosis Screening  
During the screening period, it must be determined and documented that a patient  does not have 
evidence of active or latent or inadequately treated TB per the exclusion criteria ( Section 5.5).  
The results of TB screening , which includes the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT -G) test 
and a chest x-ray, conducted in the [ADDRESS_381566] be documented in study records prior to randomization (Day 1). 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Testing Using QuantiFERON Test40 
QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT- G) is an in vitro diagnostic test using a peptide  cocktail 
simulating ESAT -6, CFP-10, and TB 7.7 proteins to stimulate cells in heparinized whole blood.  
Detection of INFγ performed by [CONTACT_28745]-linked immunosorbent a ssay (ELISA) is used to 
identify in vitro responses to these peptide antigens that are associated with Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis infection.  QFT -G is  an indirect test for M. tuberculosis infection (including disease) 
and is intended for use in conjunction with risk assessment, radiography and other medical and diagnostic evaluations. 
Test results will be reported as positive, negative, or indeterminate.  A negative QFT- G test 
result is required to meet the inclusion criterion.  In the case of an indetermin ate result, repeat 
tests should be permitted for the purpose of determining eligibility of patients to enroll in this

7.2.2 Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence experienced by a study patient, whether 
or not considered drug related by [CONTACT_2026] i nvestigator.    
AEs are unfavorable changes in a general condition, subjective or objective signs or symptoms, 
worsening of pre- existing concomitant disease, and clinically significant abnormality  in 
laboratory parameters observed in a patient  in the course of a clinical study.   
Non- serious SLE manifestations  or abnormal laboratory results related to SLE  disease activity  
would not be recorded as AEs unless they meet the definition for SAEs ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Recording of Adverse Events  
AEs should be collected and recorded for each patient  from the date of the first dose of study 
drug until the end of their participation in the study , including the safety follow up period.   
AEs may be volunteered spontaneously by [CONTACT_4694] , or discovered by [CONTACT_14543], nonleading question such as ‘How have you been feeling since you were last asked?’  All AEs and any required remedial action will be recorded  on the Adverse Events e CRF  and Safety Adverse Event Form.  The details of the AE, 
date of AE onset (and time, if known), date of AE outcome (and time, if known), and action taken for the AE will be documented together with the principal investigator’s assessment of the 
seriousness of the AE and causal relationship to the study drug and/or the study procedure. 
All AEs should be recorded individually, using diagnostic terms where possible.   If the diagnosis 
is not established, individual symptoms may be reported.  The AEs will subsequently be coded 
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).    
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity of Adverse Events  
Each AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_310117] (NCI CTCAE), version 4.03 criteria.
 41  
When changes in the severity (grade) of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the event should be noted for that day.  Any change in severity of signs and symptoms over a number of days will be captured by [CONTACT_44745] a new AE, with the amended severity grade and the date (and time, if known) of the change. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Causality of Adverse Events  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310036]161721 or placebo and 
the AE.  One of the following categories ( Table 4) should be selected based on medical 
judgment, considering the definitions below and all contributing factors. 
BOS161721  [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- [ADDRESS_381568] abnormality, occurs in a plausible time 
relationship to treatment administration and which concurrent disease or other 
drugs or chemicals cannot explain.  The response to withdrawal of the treatment (dechallenge
a) should be clinically plausible.  The event must be definitive 
pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory rechallengeb 
procedure if necessary.  
Unrelated  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no temporal 
relationship with treatment administration.  May have negative dechallenge and rechallenge information.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_261969] (eg, concomitant disease, environmental factors, or other drugs or ch emicals).  
a Dechallenge:  Upon discontinuation of a drug suspected of causing an AE, the symptoms of the AE 
disappear partially or completely, within a reasonable time from drug discontinuation  (positive 
dechallenge), or the symptoms continue despi[INVESTIGATOR_211386] (negative dechallenge).  Note that 
there are exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discon tinuation of the drug, yet drug relatedness 
clearly exists (for example, as in  bone marrow suppression, fixed drug eruptions, or tardive dyskinesia).  
b Rechallenge:   Upon re -administration of a drug suspected of causing an AE in a specific patient in the past, 
the AE recurs upon exposure (positive rechall enge), or the AE does not recur  (negative rechallenge).  
An unexpected adverse drug event is any adverse drug event for which the specificity or severity 
is not consistent with the current IP. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Seriousness  of Adverse Events  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death; 
• Is life threatening; this means that the patient  was at risk of death at the time of the event; it 
does not mean that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe; 
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_211384]; 
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions; 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect;  
• Is another important medical event (see below).  
Important medical events that do not result in death, are not life threatening, or do not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to  prevent 1 of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.   Examples of such events are:  
• Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm ; 
BOS161721  [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- 02 
Confidential  Page 77 of 113 • Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
• Development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310085] 
(eg, elective surgery for a pre-existing condition that has not worsened) need not be considered SAEs.  If anything untoward is reported during the procedure, that occurrence must be reported 
as an AE, either 'serious' or 'nonserious' according to the usual criteria. 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are AEs that are associated with the 
use of the drug and are serious and unexpected.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events of Special Interest  
AEs of special interest in this study include the following: 
1. Anaphylaxis and serious allergic reactions;  
2. Injection site reaction, including erythema, pain , and induration;  
3. Drug Induced Live r Injury (DILI) assessed following Hy’s L aw; 
4. Malignancy ; 
5. Opportunistic infections such as disseminated histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and 
disseminated tuberculosis;  
6. Cryptosporidiasis.   
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Anaphylaxis and  Serious Allergic Reactions  
Anaphylaxis will be defined according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (NIAID/FAAN) criteria.42  In the event of 
anaphylactic reaction or severe/serious hypersensitivity/allergic reaction, the patient  must 
discontinue IP and emergency resuscitation measures implemented.  In case of other mild to 
moderate hypersensitivity reaction, depending on the severity, the investigator may manage in accordance with the standard -of-care.  
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria is fulfilled: 
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal 
tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus, or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula) and at least 1 of the followin g: 
a. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] [PEF], hypoxemia) 
b. Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): 
BOS161721  [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- 02 
Confidential  Page 78 of 113 a. Involvement of the skin- mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen 
lips-tongue-uvula) 
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, 
hypoxemia)  
c. Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)  
3. Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): 
a. Systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from the 
patient’s baseline . 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Injection Site Reactions  
Injection site reactions are to be captured and reported as AEs .  These may include injection site 
erythema, pain, and induration.  The investigator should provide a clear description of the observed or reported AE including location and severity.  All concomitant treatments used to treat injection site reactions shou ld be recorded and captured in the e CRF, together with the AE 
of injection site reactions.   
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_381569] and/or ALT levels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria ou tlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury 
are considered potential cases of DILI, and as potential Hy’s Law cases, and should always be considered important medical events.  If symptoms compatible with DILI precede knowledge of serum chem ical test abnormalities, liver enzyme measurements should be made immediately, 
regardless of when the next visit or monitoring interval is scheduled.  In some cases, symptoms 
may be an early sign of injury and although typi[INVESTIGATOR_310138] e nzyme 
elevations, they may indicate a need for prompt serum testing.   An increase in liver enzymes 
should be confirmed by a repeated test within [ADDRESS_381570] be reported as SAEs (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 for reporting details).  
Potential DILI is defined as: 
1. ALT or AST elevation > 3 × ULN  
AND  
2. Total bilirubin > 2 × ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase) 
AND  
BOS161721  [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- [ADDRESS_381571] elevation and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre- existing chronic or acute 
liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic. 
The patient  should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, include 
laboratory tests, detailed history , and physical assessment.  In addition to repeating 
measurements of AST and ALT, laboratory tests should include albumin, CK , total bilirubin, 
direct and indirect bilirubin, GGT , prothrombin time (PT)/International Normalized Ratio (INR), 
and alkaline phosphatase.  A detailed history, including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen, recreational drug and supplement consumption, family history, occupational exposure, sexual history, travel history, history of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) may be warranted.  All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria 
defined above, with no other cause for liver function test (LFT) abnormalities identified at the time should be considered potential Hy’s Law cases irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the abnormal LFTs.  Such potential Hy’s Law cas es should be reported as SAEs. 
Study drug discontinuation is considered if there is marked serum AST or ALT elevation or evidence of functional impairment (as indicated by [CONTACT_310177], which represent 
substantial liver injury) that is related to study drug .
  Discontinuation of treatment should be 
considered if: 
• ALT or AST > 8 × ULN;  
• ALT or AST > 5× ULN for more than 2 weeks; 
Discontinuation of treatment must occur if:  • ALT or AST >3 × ULN and (total bilirubin  > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5); 
• ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%).  
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Malignancy 
The identification of a malignancy event will be made by [CONTACT_310221].   AEs should be reported as serious per the criteria in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
After the first dose of study drug, when there is a decision t o biopsy a potentially malignant 
tumor, lymph node, or other tissue, the investigator and/or consultant(s) should contact [CONTACT_310222].

cryptosporidium in the stool at screening, and as clinically indicated (eg, watery diarrhea) during 
the study.  If a patient develops diarrhea during the study a stool sample must be provided to test for ova, parasites, and cryptosporidium.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of Adverse Events  
AE reporting  will be carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations, including 
regulatory agency and IRB reporting requirements.   
Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for an SAE.  If an SAE occurs, 
expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate, and is further outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS].2.

As information is available, a pregnancy diagnosed during the study will be reported within 24 hours to the sponsor via the Pregnancy Notification and Outcome Form, including pregnancy in female patients who received study drug and female partners of male study patient s who 
received study drug .  The pregnancy should be followed to term and/or outcome and this 
outcome should also be reported to the sponsor via the Pregnancy Notification and Outcome 
Form .  Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE or SAE unless there is complication.  
In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by [CONTACT_61321] (unless pre- procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and 
the findings are reported). 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an  AE or  SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a live 
born, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs. 
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows: 
• Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion; 
• Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_381573].

to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAE reports as well as to the initial and follow -up reporting of exposure during pregnancy and exposure via breastfeeding 
cases.  In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE immediately (eg, if an outpatient study patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the AE.  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310086].  All SAEs will be recorded from the time of first dose 
of study drug through the safety follow-up period (up to Week 36).  SAEs  occurring after the 
final follow-up visit and coming to the attention of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310087] (in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_14371]) reaso nable causal relationship with 
the study drug. 
As a minimum requirement, the initial notification should provide the following information: 
• Study number; 
• Patient  number; 
• Details of the SAE  (verbatim details are sufficient for immediate notification) ; 
• Criterion for classification as ‘serious’ ; 
• Causality assessment ( which may be updated in a follow-up report when sufficient 
information is available to make this classification) . 
Initial reports of SAEs must be followed later with detailed descriptions, in cluding clear 
photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_211387] (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73529], consultant reports, autopsy 
reports, etc), with the study patient ’s personal identifiers removed.  All relevant information

Adverse Event Form. 
Potential DILI will be reported based on specifications mentioned in Section [IP_ADDRESS].3.   
Each AE of special interest is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for an SAE.  If 
an SAE occurs, expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate, and is further outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS].2. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Follow Up of Adverse Events 
All AEs will be followed up through the safety follow-up visits.  All SAEs experienced by a 
patient , irrespective of the suspected causality, will be monitored until the event has resolved, 
until any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline or stabilize d at a level acceptable 
to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310042] m onitor, until there is a satisfactory explanation for the 
changes observed, or until the patient  is lost to follow-up.   
See Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 for details related to follow -up of pregnancy.  See Section [IP_ADDRESS].3 for 
details related to follow -up of potential DILI.  See  Section [IP_ADDRESS].4 for details related to follow -
up of malignancy. 
7.2.3 Vital Signs  
Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature) will be assessed as specified in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Section 4.3).  Vital signs will be assess ed on Day [ADDRESS_381577] ≥ [ADDRESS_381578] leads and a Lead II rhythm strip on the bottom of the 
tracing.  The ECG will be recorded at a paper speed of 25  mm/sec ond.  The following ECG 
parameters will be collected:  PR interval, QRS interval, RR interval, QT i nterval, and 
QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF).  
All ECGs must be evaluated by a qualified physician or qualified designee for the presence of abnormalities and will be captured ele ctronically and retained for future evaluation if required, 
up to the time of the clinical study report ( CSR) completion .

The targeted (limited) physical examination will be completed at Visits 3 through 13.  It includes 
evaluation of patient  complaints and SLE disease- related issues , and will exclude the 
genitourinary system. 
7.2.6 C-SSRS 
The C-SSRS is a low -burden measure of the spectrum of suicidal ideation and behavior that was 
developed by [CONTACT_310310].  It is a clinical interview prov iding a summary of both ideation and 
behavior that can be administered during any evaluation or risk assessment to identify the level and type of suicidality present.  The C-SSRS can also be used during treatment to monitor for clinical worsening.
43 
The C -SSRS evaluation will be performed at screening, Visit 2 (Day 1)  and at Visits 7 and 10 
(Weeks 12 and 24, respectively) .  Patients with recent (within the past 12 months) or active 
suicidal ideation or behavior based on patient responding “yes” to question 3, 4, or [ADDRESS_381580] responses to the C- SSRS reviewed in 
detail to assess patient risk, and appropriate consultative mental health services will be provided. 
7.2.7 Injection Site Reactions  
Patients will be monitored for local injection site reactions at dosing administration visits, 
Visits  2 (Day  1), Visit 4 (Week 4) , and  Visits  6 through 10 (Weeks 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24).  
Patients will also be monitored for local injection site reactions at the safety follow -up visits, 
Visits 11 , 12, and 13 (Weeks 28 , 32, and 36, respectively).   Local injection site reactions will be 
assessed predose and at [ADDRESS_381581]  (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS].3). 
7.2.8 Immunogenicity  
The serum samples to measure the presence of ADA will be collected as Visits 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 
and 13 (Week 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 36, respectively).  Blood samples (4 mL) to provide 
approximately 1.5 mL of plasma for anti BOS161721 antibody analysis will be collected into appropriately labeled tubes containing K
2EDTA.  The presence or absence of ADA will be 
determined in the serum samples using validated bioanalytical methods.  Blood samples for ADA analysis will b e collected up to Day 90 from all patient s.  Subsequent ADA samples will be 
collected from all patients  but only assayed if the patient  had a positive ADA on Day 90.

Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- [ADDRESS_381582] dose, if a patient  tests positive in the validated confirmatory ADA assay , the 
sample from this patient  will be further analyzed in the neutralizing antibody (nAb) assay. 
7.3 Efficacy Assessments 
7.3.1 SLEDAI -2K 
The SLEDAI -2K is a validated instrument that measures disease activity in SLE patients at the 
time of the visit and in the prev ious 30 days.  It is a global index and includes 24 clinical and 
laboratory variables that are weighted by [CONTACT_310181], but not by [CONTACT_926].  The total 
score falls between 0 and 105, with higher scores representing increased disease activity.   The 
SLEDAI -2K has been shown to be a valid and reliable disease activity measure in multiple 
patient  groups.  A SLEDAI -2K of 6 or more generally represents moderately to severely active 
disease.44 
The SLEDAI -2K is completed at screening, at Visit 2, Visit 4, and Visits 6 through 13. 
7.3.2 BILAG  2004 
The BILAG -2004 index is an organ -specific 97-question assessment based on the principle of 
the doctor’s intent to treat.  Only clinical features attributable to SLE disease activity are to be recorded and based on the patient ’s condition in the last 4 weeks compared with the previous 4 
weeks.  It will be scored as not present (0), improved (1), the same (2), worse (3), or new (4).  Disease activity is graded separately for 9 body systems to 5 different grades (A to E) as 
follows: A (“Active”)  is very active disease, B  (“Beware”)  is moderate activity, C 
(“Contentment”) is mild stable disease, D (“Discount”) is inactive now but previously active, and 
E (“Excluded”)  indicates the organ was never involved.
[ADDRESS_381583] maintain 
documentation with descriptive details supporting the BILAG-2004 scoring (eg, chart, worksheet, clinic notes, and labs) at each visit. 
The BILAG -2004 is completed at screening, Visit 2, 4, and 6 through 13.  See APPENDIX 5 for 
detailed specifications . 
7.3.3 PGA of Disease Activity  
The PGA is used to assess investigator’s general impression on the patient’s overall  status of 
SLE disease activity  via visual analogue scale (10 0 mm) with 0 being “very good, asymptomatic 
and no limitation of normal activities” with 100  mm being “most severe possible disease ever 
seen in all SLE patients”.    
The PGA is completed at screening, Visit 2, 4, and Visits 6 through 13.  When scoring the PGA, 
the assessor should always look back at the score from the previous visit.

Confidential  Page 85 of 113 7.3.4 Composite Endpoints :  SRI -4, SRI-5, SRI-6, and BICLA Response 
[IP_ADDRESS] SRI-4 Response  
Patient s will be evaluated for SRI-4 scores at Week  28, with evaluation for sustained reduction 
of oral CS (≤ 10 mg/day and ≤ Day  1 dose) between Week 16 and Week  28. 
The SRI -4 is a composite index of SLE disease improvement that consists of scores derived from 
the SLEDAI -2K and the BILAG 2004 Index .  Response based on the SRI-4 is defined by :  
1) ≥ 4-point reduction in SLEDAI-2K global score, 2) no new severe disease activity (BILAG  A 
organ score) or more than 1 new moderate organ score (BILAG B), and 3) no deterioration from 
baseline in the PGA by ≥ 0.[ADDRESS_381584] improve ments in clinical and patient- reported outcomes.45  
Each patient, after providing their 28- week SRI -4 response, will be evaluated as either a 
responder or non-responder.   
[IP_ADDRESS] SRI-5 and SRI -6 Response  
Like the SRI -4, the SRI-5 and SRI-6 are composite indices of SLE disease improvement that 
consists of scores derived from the SLEDAI-2K and the BILAG 2004 Index.  However, the 
SRI-5 and SRI-6 are computed with a minimal three -point or five-point improvement in 
SLEDAI -2K being required, respectively.46 
The SRI -5 and SRI- 6 are evaluated for response at Week  24, along with a sustained reduction of 
oral CS ( ≤ 10 mg/ day and ≤ Day  1 dose) between Week  16 and Week  28. 
[IP_ADDRESS] BICLA  Response  
The BICLA is a responder index developed to measure response to therapy, and it includes 
scores from the BILAG, SLEDAI-2K, and PGA.  BICLA response is defined as 1) at least 
1 gradation of improvement in baseline BILAG 2004 scores in all body systems with moderate disease activity at entry (eg, all B [moderate disease] scores falling to C [mild], or D [no 
activity ]); 2) no new BILAG A or more than 1 new BILAG B scores; 3) no worsening of total 
SLEDAI -2K score from baseline; 4) ≤ 10% deterioration in PGA score  and 5) no treatment 
failure .
44  It is driven primarily by [CONTACT_310182], and has been used in Phase 2 and 3 mAb 
studies.47 
For the endpoints of BICLA respons e at Week 28, Week 32 , and Week  36, patient scores will be 
completed and response determined. 
7.3.5  CLASI Response  
The CLASI is a comprehensive tool for assessment of disease activity and damage in cutaneous 
lupus, shown to be valid, reliable, and sensitive to changes in disease activity. 48  Response is 
defined as  50% improvement from baseline in “A” or “B” scores.  This assessment will be 
applied to all patients as all are required to have cutaneous disease activity .

performed at screening, Visit 2, 4, and 6 through 13. 
7.3.7 Laboratory Assessments  
Patients will be evaluated for laboratory parameters as specified in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Section 4.3), including:  Fasting glucose and lipid panels, pSTAT3 (predose samples in 
Phase 2), total IgG & IgM, complement:  , Plasma  & , whole blood 
for leukocyte immunophenotype and RNA, , and antibodies:  (  
). 
Endpoint analyses wi ll be based on changes from baseline assessments at Week 16 and Week 28. 
7.4 Other Variables 
7.4.1 SLICC/ACR Damage Index  
The SLICC/ACR damage index is a validated instrument to assess damage, defined as 
irreversible impairment, continuously persistent for 6 months (ascertained by [CONTACT_310183]), occurring since the onset of lupus, and it  is based on a weighted scoring system.   
This index records damage occurring in patients with SLE regardless of cause, with demonstrated content, face, criterion, and discriminant validity.
49  It will be performed on Day  1 
(Visit 2 ), and Day 180 (Visit 10). 
7.4.2 PROs  
Patients should be encouraged to complete the PROs at the clinic at the beginning of the study visit prior to any clinical assessments.  A member of the staff should be available if a patient requires further instruction and to review the PRO questionnaires for completeness prior to leaving the clinic.  The  PROs include the  and the .

potential use of this trial to support regulatory filing.  
9.2.2 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Baseline and patient characteristics will be summarized via appropriate summary statistics by [CONTACT_6654], for each phase of  the trial.   
9.2.3 Primary Endpoint(s)  
The proportion of patients who achieve treatment response (measured by [CONTACT_310283]- 4 at Week 28 
along with a sustained reduction of oral CS) will be analyzed via Cochran- Mantel -Haen szel 
(CMH) analysis.  The primary endpoint will be analyzed on the FAS and if needed the PP analysis set.   In addition, missing values will be addressed by [CONTACT_18120] a last observation 
carried forward (LOCF) analysis and/or other appropriate analytic approaches as a sensitivity analysis.  Details will be  available in the SAP.  
9.2.4 Secondary Endpoint(s)  
Binary efficacy endpoints will be assessed via CMH analysis.  Continuous efficacy endpoints will be assessed via analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) repeated measures mixed model analysis with factors including treatment, time, treatment- by-time interaction, baseline covariate, and 
covariate -by-time interaction.  The secondary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed on the FAS and 
if needed the PP analysis set.  Details will be available in the SAP.  
9.2.5 Analysis of Safety 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Analysis 
Safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Analysis Set.  AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary.  Incidences (number and percent) of AEs  will be presented by [CONTACT_1570].  Incidences of AEs will also be presented 
by [CONTACT_218764].  For the MAD study , the placebo 
patients  from each cohort will be combined for the summaries.  If there is a clear increase in AE 
rates for placebo patients  across the cohorts, the AEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_9084]. 
AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_310285].  Laboratory data and vital signs will be summarized by [CONTACT_310277].  Summary statistics will include n, arithmetic 
mean, median, arithmetic SD, minimum, and maximum.  
Additional safety parameters will be analyzed descriptively by [CONTACT_1570].  Descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, maximum) will be calculated by

[IP_ADDRESS] Data Monitoring Committee 
This study will use an e xternal DMC.  The DMC is an independent committee established to 
provide oversight of safety considerations in study and to provide advice to the sponsor regarding actions the committee deems necessary for the continuing protection of enrolled patients and those yet to be recruited to the trial as well as for the continuing validity and 
scientific merit of the study results.  The DMC is charged with assessing such actions in light of 
an acceptable benefit/risk profile for anti -IL-21 mAb.  The recommendations made by [CONTACT_1363] 
(ie, dose escalation, etc.) will be forwarded to the sponsor for final decision.  The sponsor w ill 
forward such decisions, which may include summaries of safety data which are not endpoints, to regulatory authorities, as appropriate. 
The DM C will have access to unblinded treatment information during the clinical trial.  To 
prevent inadvertent unblinding of sponsor staff, reports to the DMC will describe each treatment 
group by a coded identifier rather than actual treatment group assignment.  Details regarding management and process of this committee are found in the DMC Charter.  
The DMC may recommen d termination of an anti- IL-21 mAb treatment arm o r the entire 
BOS161721 MAD/POC trial for any safety concern that is felt to outweigh potential benefits.  The recommendation must be supported by [CONTACT_310226]. 
9.2.6 Pharmacokinetic  and Pharmacodynamic Data 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Pharmacokinetic Data  
The PK parameter data will be listed and summarized descriptively in tabular format. 
If data permit, the following analyses will be performed for plasma BOS161721 concentration 
data: 
• A listing of all plasma BOS161721 concentrations by [CONTACT_310250]; 
• A descriptive summary of plasma BOS161721 concentrations.  Summary statistics of 
geometric mean, % coefficient of variation, standard deviation, median, minimum, and 
maximum will be tabulated by [CONTACT_310187].  
Details will be available in the SAP.

observed, transformation will be used (eg, log and/or rank). 
Details will be available in the SAP.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis or PK/PD Modeling 
Plots of individual patient values for each relevant PD parameter on Y- axis and  each relevant PK 
parameter on X -axis will be examined for relationship.  If relationships are revealed by [CONTACT_310225], PK and PD data from this study may be analyzed using modeling approaches to 
describe the relationship and may also be pooled with data from other studies to investigate any association between BOS161721 exposure and biomarkers or significant safety endpoints. 
Details will be available in the SAP.      
9.3 Interim Analysis and Power  
Two IAs are planned for this study.  The initial IA will be conducted at the time of the POC 
decision for dose selection.  The DMC will review safety and tolerability, and PK/PD/biomarkers for dose selection.  Efficacy data will not be reviewed for dose selection so there should be no impact on the type 1 error. 
The second IA will be performed for futility.  IA2 is planned to be conducted at Week 16 when 
SRI-4 response is determined for approximately 60  patients (including all patients  at the same

Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- [ADDRESS_381601].  The study monitor will verify that each patient has proper consent documentation from the patient and/or patient’s authorized representative for study procedures and for the release of medical records to the sponsor, FDA, other regulatory authorities, and the IRB.  The study monitor will also verify that assent was obtained for patients not capable of providing informed consent or that documentation is provided by [CONTACT_310227].  The investigator or appointed delegate will receive the study monitor during these on- site 
visits and will cooperate in providing the documents for inspection and respond to inquiries.  In addition, the investigator will permit inspection of the study files by [CONTACT_76782].  On completion of the study, the study monitor will arrange for a final review of the study files after which the files should be secured for the appropriate time period. 
Throughout the course of the study, the medical monitor will determine eligibility of all screened 
patients, will address any medical issues that might arise, clarify medical questions, review patient safety data (eg, AE/SAE, laboratory, and EC G), and partner with the study team in the 
overall study management.  The study medical monitoring plan will document additional details of the study medical oversight and monitoring.

Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- [ADDRESS_381615] the health of the people.  The physician’s knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty. 
The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association binds the physi cian with the 
words, "The health of my subject will be my first consideration," and the International Code of 
Medical Ethics declares that, "A physician shall act only in the subject's interest when providing medical care which might have the effect of weakening the physical and mental condition of the subject." 
Medical progress is based on research, which ultimately must rest in part on experimentation 
involving human subjects. 
In medical research on human subjects, considerations related to the well- being  of the human 
subject should take precedence over the interests of science and society.  
The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to improve prophylactic, 
diagnostic, and therapeutic procedures and the understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of disease.  Even the best -proven prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods must 
continuously be challenged through research for their effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility,  and 
quality. 
BOS161721  [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- [ADDRESS_381616] inv olving human subjects should be preceded by [CONTACT_310253]161721  [LOCATION_011] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study  Protocol :  BOS161721- [ADDRESS_381617]’s information and to minimize the impact of the study on the subject's physical and mental integrity and on the personality of the subject. 
In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the 
aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomf ort it may 
entail.  The subject should be informed of the right to abstain from participation in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal.  After ensuring that the subject has understood the information, the physician should then obtain the subject's freely-given informed consent, preferably in writing.  If the consent cannot be obtained in writing, the non- written 
consent must be formally documented and witnessed. 
When obtaining informed consent for the research project the physician should be particularly 
cautious if the subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under duress.  In that case the informed consent should be obtained by a well-informed physician who is not engaged in the investigation and who is completely independent of this relationship. 
For a research subject who is legally incompetent, physically or mentally incapable of giving 
consent or is a legally incompetent minor, the investigator must obtain informed consent from the legally authorized representative in accordance with applicable law.  These groups should not 
be included in research unless the research is necessary to promote the health of the population represented and this research cannot instead be performed on legally competent persons. 
When a subject deemed legally incompetent, such as a minor child, is able to give assent to 
decisions about participation in research, the investigator must obtain that assent in addition to the consent of the legally authorized repre sentative.  
Research on individuals from whom it is not possible to obtain consent, including proxy or advance consent, should be done only if the physical/mental condition that prevents obtaining

Where possible, these measures should be made the object of research, designed to evaluate their safety and efficacy.  In all cases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, published.  The other relevant guidelines of this Declaration should be followed.

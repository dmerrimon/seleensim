CONFIDENTIAL  AMENDMENT HISTORY  
Amendment 9 US  
The primary purpose of this US -specific amendment is to amend the long COVID sub -study to 
allow the collection of additional diagnostic information to contextualize any symptoms or 
diagnoses that may confound or be associated with long COVID.  
Description of Change   Brief Rationale   Section(s)  
For patients in the long COVID sub -study, 
any new medical condition (s) diagnosed after 
randomization will be captured as an adverse 
event of special interest (AESI), but will not 
require expedited reporting to the Sponsor.  
 
Patients who previously consented to the 
long COVID sub -study but have already 
completed their end of study visit may be 
reconsented for retrospective collection of 
this information . To contextualize any 
symptoms or diagnoses that 
may confound or be

Amendment 7  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to update the planned statistical analysis for the final 
analysis, including changes to the objectives and endpoints, following early termination of the 
study on 09 April 2021 based on a Sponsor business decision.  
The following table outlines all changes made to the protocol and the affected sections.  
Description of Change  Brief Rationale  Section(s)  
Key modifications to the planned final 
statistical analysis include the following.  
Efficacy analysis  
The primary virological and clinical analyses 
will involve pooling of cohort 1 (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103119] -flow oxygen) and cohort 1A 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103120]) and doses. Assessment of each 
cohort and dose alone will now be secondary.  
The primary virologic endpoint  is time -
weighted average change from baseline viral 
load in nasopharyngeal (NP) sample through 
day 7 in the Seronegative mFAS in the pooled  
phase 3 c ohort 1 and phase 2 cohort 1A, and 
combined across the 2.4 g and 8.0 g doses of 
REGN10933+REGN10987.  
The primary clinical endpoint  is the 
proportion of patients who died or went on 
mechanical ventilation from day 6 through 
day 29 and from day 1 through day  29. The 
primary analysis will be performed for the 
High Viral Load mFAS, Seronegative mFAS, 
and Overall mFAS in the pooled  phase 3 
(cohort 1) and phase 2 (cohort 1A).  
To control alpha at a strict 0.[ADDRESS_114076]. All hierarchical testing will be 
done using the combined  dose group.  
There are no primary objectives for phase 2 
cohort 1A, as enrollment was prematurely 
terminated. The clinical efficacy endpoints for 
phase 3 (cohort 1) and phase 2 (cohort 1A), 
separately, will be assessed as secondary.  For efficacy analysis  
As a result of the study 
ending early and the 
resultant constrained 
sample size, cohorts and 
doses will be pooled in the 
primary virological and 
clinical analyses to 
enhance the ability to 
detect clinically 
meaningful treatment 
effects.  
To assess the potential 
efficacy of REGN10933+ 
REGN10987 using 
relevant measures in a 
patient population most 
likely to receive benefit 
from the therapy, based on 
preliminary data from 
clinical studies of 
REGN [ZIP_CODE]+REGN10987 
in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643] 
(Regeneron, 2020 ) (Horby, 
2021 ). The clinical 
efficacy of phase 3 (cohort 
1) and phase 2 (cohort 1A), 
separately, will be assessed 
as secondary due to 
constrained sample size 
following early study 
termination.

Safety analysis  
The safety analysis will be performed for the 
following cohorts, separately. Patients in 
phase 1/2 (cohort 1) and phase 2 (cohort 2 and 
cohort 3) are inc luded in these analyses since 
more safety data were collected for the 
patients after the previous database lock on 22

• Phase 2 (cohort 2)  
• Phase 2 (cohort 3)  
• Phase 1/2/3 (cohort 1) combined  
Pharmacokinetics (PK) and

The PK and anti -drug antibody (ADA) 
analysis will be performed for phase 1/2/3 
(cohort 1) combined, phase 2 (cohort 1A), 
phase 2 (cohort 2), and phase 2 (cohort 3), 
separately. The neutralizing antibody (NAb) 
analysis will only be p erformed for phase [ADDRESS_114077] sites may be reconsented and

Amendment 6  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to update the planned statistical analysis for the phase 
1/2 portion of the study prior to unblinding. The primary analysis of phase 1/2 (cohort 1) will 
exclude futility of REGN10933+REGN10987 compared with placebo, as measured by [CONTACT_103192]. If the study as designed is determined not to be futile, the clinical efficacy 
of REGN10933[PHONE_2359] in reducing death or mechanical ventilation will be eva luated as a key 
secondary endpoint.  
Other updates include incorporating the current IDMC recommendation to hold cohort 2/3 
enrollment, pending further review of data.  
Description of Change  Brief Rationale  Section(s)  
Key modifications to the planned statis tical 
analysis include the following:  
• The primary objective of phase 1/2 cohort 1 
will be to exclude futility of 
REGN10933+REGN10987 compared to 
placebo, as measured by [CONTACT_103192]. If futility is 
declared, the phase 1/2 data will be 
analyzed descriptively  
• If the study as designed is determined not 
to be futile, the clinical efficacy of 
REGN10933[PHONE_2359] in reducing death or 
mechanical ventilation will be evaluated as 
a key secondary endpoint in cohort 1. This 
endpoint will be tested usi ng a statistical 
hierarchy  
• The statistical hierarchy of key secondary 
endpoints will focus on assessments in: 1) 
patients who are seronegative at baseline 
and do not have a negative baseline RT -
qPCR; 2) patients who do not have a 
negative baseline RT -qPCR and have high

Endpoints   
Primary  Pooled Phase 3 (Cohort 1) and Phase 2 (Cohort 1A)  
Virologic  
The primary virologic endpoint is time -weighted average change from baseline viral load in NP sample 
through day 7, as measured by [CONTACT_103201] (RT -qPCR) 
in nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples.  
Note: Time -weighted average of change from baseline in viral load from day 1 to day  7 will be 
calculated for each patient using the trapezoidal rule as the area under the curve for change from 
baseline at each time point divided by [CONTACT_103202] e observation period.  
Clinical  
The primary clinical endpoint is the proportion of patients who died or went on mechanical ventilation 
from day 6 through day 29 and from day 1 through day 29.  
Phase 1/2 (Cohort 1)  
Futility  
The primary endpoint is death or m echanical ventilation.  
Safety and Tolerability  
Safety and tolerability endpoints are as follows:  
• Proportion of patients with treatment -emergent SAEs through end of study  
• Proportion of patients with infusion -related reactions (grade ≥2) through day 4

• Questionnaires to be administered by [CONTACT_103206] 3: Initial Estimation  
The sample size for phase 3 was initially estimated to be 1350 patients (150 patients per arm across 3 
treatment arms in 3 cohorts). Based on the new endpoint of death or mechanical ventilation, the sample 
size for phase 3 has been re -estimated to be 2505 patients in each of cohort 1 and cohort 1A.  
The study was planned to continue enrolling additional patients seamlessly into the phase 3 portion of 
the study, until an adaptation decision on the dose(s), primary endpoint and final sample size for phase 
3 is made based on the phase 2 data analysis. A total sample size of approximately 5010 patients was 
estimated for the phase 3 portion of the study (2505 per cohort, 835 per arm across 3 treatment arms 
in 2 cohorts). For cohort 1, a total of 241 events (estim ated sample size of 2505 patients [835 patients

detect a risk reduction of 35.8% (ie, HR=0.642) in the cumulative incidence of patients who died or 
went on m echanical ventilation, assuming a 12.5% cumulative incidence rate in the placebo group by 
[CONTACT_4475] 29.  
Phase 3: Final Sample Size  
Finalization of the sample size and patient population for phase [ADDRESS_114107] to change 
and would be determined after review of phase 2 data. However, enrollment of patients into the study 
was terminated prematurely by [CONTACT_17190] 09 Apri l 2021 because of extremely slow enrollment in 
the months preceding the decision. The sample size of phase 3 was not re -estimated.  
Approximately 2252 patients were randomized in the study, which includes 60 patients in phase 1 
cohort 1, 629 in phase 2 coh ort 1, 755 in planned phase 3 cohort 1, 609 in phase 2 cohort 1A, 164 in 
phase 2 cohort 2 and 35 in phase 2 cohort 3.  
Assuming the proportion of patients who died or went on mechanical ventilation from day 1 to day 29 
in placebo group is 13.1% which is sa me as the blinded proportion in the Seronegative mFAS patients 
of the pooled phase 3 cohort 1 and phase 2 cohort 1A and alpha is 0.05 2 -sided, the minimal significant 
difference in relative risk reduction between the REGN10933+REGN10987 2.4g and 8.0g combi ned

daily change from baseline in viral load (log 10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL) from day [ADDRESS_114109] -baseline 
visit timepoint will be performed in th e Seronegative mFAS in the pooled phase 3 cohort 1 and phase 
2 cohort 1A patients. The estimand for the analysis is the difference in means between the 
REGN10933+REGN10987 2.4g and 8.0g combined dose group and placebo in the pooled phase 3 
cohort 1 and pha se 2 cohort 1A patients. Data collected after use of convalescent plasma therapy or 
other anti -spi[INVESTIGATOR_103134]. All other available data will be 
used in the analysis regardless of intercurrent events such as rescue  medication or discontinuation, ie, 
treatment policy approach.  
The analysis will be based on the observed data with no imputation for missing data except as defined 
in the SAP for viral load values that are below lower limit of detection (<LLOD), below lo wer limit of 
quantification (<LLOQ) or above upper limit of quantification (>ULOQ) of the assay.  
The variable will be analyzed using the Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment 
group and the type of background standard -of-care as fixed effect s, and baseline viral load and 
treatment by [CONTACT_103207].  
The least squares means estimates for time -weighted average daily change from baseline in viral load 
for each treatment group, as well as the difference between the REGN10933+ REGN10987 2.4g and 
8.0g combined doses and placebo as well as between each individual dose treatment group and placebo, 
will be provided along with the corresponding two -sided p -value, standard error, and associated 95%

CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Emergence of SARS -CoV -2 and COVID -19 
Coronaviruses are a family of enveloped, single -stranded RNA viruses. In recent decades, 2  highly 
pathogenic strains of coronavirus were identified in humans: severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_18960] (SARS -CoV) and Middle East respi[INVESTIGATOR_103135] (MERS -CoV). 
These viruses were found to cause severe, and sometimes fatal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375] (Cui, 2019 ) 
(Fehr, 2015 ). 
In December 2019, pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in clusters of patients in Wuhan 
City, China. A novel enveloped RNA betacoronavirus – severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_103136] 2 (SARS -CoV -2) – was identified in these patients, and the disease caused by 
[CONTACT_7544] -CoV -2 infection was later designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) by  [CONTACT_103210] (WHO, 2020 ) (Zhu, 2020 ). Millions of SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_114112] bee n 
confirmed worldwide, and the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] -spreading, worldwide outbreak has prompted the WHO to 
declare COVID -19 a pandemic and public health emergency of international concern.  
1.2. Clinical Outcomes in Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103129] -19 
Patients with COVID -19 are at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a variety of respi[INVESTIGATOR_14437], ranging 
from relatively mild respi[INVESTIGATOR_103137] (Wu, 2020b ). 
Among hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643], intensive care and/or oxygen supplementation (eg, mechanical 
ventilation) is often required, and reported fatality rates are high. In a report from the Chinese 
Center for Disease Control and Prevention that included 44,500 confirmed infections, nearly 20% 
of patients pre sented with advanced respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856] (14% with dyspnea, hypoxia, or >50% 
lung involvement on imaging; 5% with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], shock, or multiorgan failure) (Wu, 
2020b ). Another analysis of patients wi th COVID -19 in China found that, among 1,099 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643], 5% had been admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), 2.3% required invasive 
mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% died. Among patients with advanced disease on admission 
(defined as pneumonia,  hypoxemia, and tachypnea), these negative outcomes rose to 19%, 14.5%, 
and 8.1%, respectively (Guan, 2020 ). A report of 2634 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41374] -19 in 
the [LOCATION_002] identified similar clinical outcomes: 14.2% were admitted to an ICU, 12.2% 
required invasive mechanical ventilation, and 21% died (Richardson, 2020 ). Other reports have 
found that approximately 20% to 30% of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41374] -19 and pneumonia 
require intensive care for respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413] (Chen, 2020 ) (Huang, 2020 ).  
1.3. Long -Term Outcomes in Patients with COVID -19  
Although much has been learned about acute SARS -CoV -2 infection and the resulting COVID -19 
disease course, the long -term sequelae of SARS -CoV -2 infection and COVID -19 remain poorly 
understood. Long COVID is characterized by [CONTACT_103211], occurring beyond 4 weeks 
from the initial SARS -CoV -2 infection, that are not explained by [CONTACT_103212] 
(Nalbandian, 2021 ) (CDC, 2021 ) (NICE, 2021 ). Initial assessments of long COVID indicate that 
approximately 10% to 35% of patients who recover from acute SARS -CoV -2 infection may 
experience persi stent symptoms suggestive of long COVID (Tenforde, 2020 ) (Greenhalgh, 2020 ). 
To date, it is unclear whether and how the treatment of acute SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_114113]

CONFIDENTIAL  1.4. The Role of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] (S) Protein in SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_114114] of an RNA genome packaged in nucleocapsid (N) protein surrounded by [CONTACT_103213]. The envelope is comprised of membrane (M) protein and envelope (E) protein, 
which are involved in virus assembly, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] (S) protein, which medi ates entry into host cells. 
S proteins form large trimeric projections, providing the hallmark crown -like appearance of 
coronaviruses. S protein trimers bind to a host receptor and, after priming by [CONTACT_103214], 
mediate host –virus membrane fusion (Li, 2016 ). S protein appears to be central to viral infectivity 
by [CONTACT_7544] -CoV -2. SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_114115] receptor angiotensin -converting enzyme 
2 (ACE2) with high affinity, and in cell assays and animal models can utilize ACE2 as a functional 
receptor fo r host cell entry (Ou, 2020 ) (Hoffmann, 2020 ) (Walls, 2020 ). 
Blockade of host cell entry through the use of neutralizing antibodies against S protein is a viable 
mechanistic strategy shown to reduce viral infectivity of SARS -CoV and MERS -CoV (Jiang, 
2020 ). In light of the likely pi[INVESTIGATOR_45901] l role of S protein in the pathogenesis of SARS -CoV -2, a number 
of efforts are underway to develop antibodies and vaccines that target this protein.  
1.5. REGN10933+REGN10987: Human Monoclonal Antibodies Against 
SARS -CoV -2 S Protein  
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, I nc. (Regeneron) has developed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 
directed against the RBD of the SARS -CoV -2 S protein. Casirivimab (REGN10933) and 
imdevimab (REGN10987) are human, IgG1 mAbs that bind simultaneously to the RBD and block 
interaction with ACE2. As co-administered combination therapy, casirivimab and imdevimab, also 
referred to by [CONTACT_103215] (REGEN -COV™) and by 
[CONTACT_23357] (RONPAPREVE®), is being evaluated for the treatment and prevention of SARS -CoV -
[ADDRESS_114116] circulating SARS -CoV -2 variants of concern 
([LOCATION_006] B.1.1.7 [alpha], South Africa B.1.351 [beta], [LOCATION_004] B.1.429 [epsilon], India B.1.617.2 
[delta], and Brazil P.1 [gamma]) and protects against the select ion of resistant variants in vitro 
(Copin, 2021 ) (REGEN -COV™ (casirivimab with imdevimab ) [HCP Fact Sheet], 2021 ). 
In phase 3 clinical trials, the combination of casirivimab and imdevimab  was shown to be effective 
and well -tolerated in the treatment of outpatient and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103138] -19, and in 
the prevention of SARS -CoV -2 infection in adults and adolescents (Horby, 2021 ) (O’Brien, 
2021a ) (O’Brien, 2021b ) (Weinreich, 2021b ).

authorizations (FDA, 2021 ) (EMA, 2021 ), there remains a significant unmet medical need for

randomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled master protocol to evaluate the futility or efficacy 
and safety of co -administered REGN10933+REGN10987 combination therapy 
(“REGN10933+REGN10987”) in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103140] p atients with COVID -19.

3. HYPOTHESIS AND RATIO NALE  
3.1. Hypotheses  
Treatment of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103141] -19 with REGN10933+REGN10987 will improve 
clinical outcomes, be tolerated, and reduce viral load.  
Information concerning statistical hypotheses can be found in Section  11.1. 
3.2. Rationale  
3.2.1.  Rationale for Study Design  
This randomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled, adaptive phase 1/2/3 master protocol will 
assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of REGN10933+REGN10987 in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103142] -19. The multicenter conduct of this study will enable generalizable evidence of the 
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of these investigational mAbs for COVID -19.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Phase [ADDRESS_114119]-in-human  (FIH) phase 1 study to evaluate safety and 
tolerability.  Driven by [CONTACT_103219] -19 pandemic, the process described 
below is designed to maximize efficient enrollment of eligible patients while optimizing safety of 
FIH exp osure with limited preclinical data (see Section  3.3). 
Phase 1 will include a sentinel safety group, where the initial safety data up to day 3 will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_82571] (IDMC).  
Figure  1: Phase 1 Sentinel Safety Group  
 
Patients in this sentinel safety group can be derived from either of 2 concurrent FIH studies, where 
the safety and tolerability of REGN10933+REGN10987 will be evaluated:

or both of the studies combined), the IDMC will review the data.  
Note that phase 1 enrollment will pause during the IDMC review.  
Initiation of phase 2 enrollment is contingent upon IDMC review of phase 1 data from the sentinel 
safety group. Study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_103143]  [IP_ADDRESS] .  
After IDMC reviews and provides a positive recommendation for the phase sentinel safety group, 
enrollment of studies assessing REGN10933+REGN10987 (including REGN10933+REGN [ZIP_CODE] 
treatment arms in phase 2 of this study and R10933 -[ZIP_CODE] -COV -2067) may begin.  
Once phase 2 of this study is active, phase 1 will continue to enroll to completion. However, 
phase  2 enrollment does not require the completion of phase 1 enrollment.  
Patient Population in the Phase 1 Sentinel Safety Group  
In this study, only patients from cohort 1 will be included in the sentinel safety group. Patients 
from cohort 2 and cohort 3 will not be included. Due to the advanced nature of their illness and 
confound ing adverse events related to underlying COVID -19, assessing the FIH safety of the anti -
SARS -CoV -2 S protein mAbs will be challenging in cohort 2 and cohort 3 patients.  
Review of Sentinel Safety Group, Part A (Information Added to Protocol in Amendment  5) 
A blinded Sponsor analysis of the sentinel safety group data showed that 
REGN10933+REGN10987 was well tolerated in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103144] -19, with no hypersensitivity reactions or infusion -related reactions reported. Vital signs 
and laboratory assessments did not identify any safety signals. IDMC review recommended to 
continue enrollment in the studies after unblinded data review. For more details, refer to the 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adaptive Master Protocol Design  
The study utili zes an adaptive master protocol design. The adaptive design has been selected to 
maximize the efficiency of identifying early signs of efficacy, increase the efficiency of studying 
multiple therapeutic combinations, and avoid the use of ineffective dose le vels in patients with 
COVID -19.  
Due to the novel nature of the COVID -[ADDRESS_114121] -of-care is expected to evolve over time. The adaptive design of this study allows 
for the assessment of virolog ic and clinical efficacy endpoints in phase 2, which are then 
seamlessly confirmed in the phase 3 portion of the study, as well as evaluating the benefit risk of 
the different treatment arms.  
This master protocol will allow for treatment arm(s) to be drop ped if there is a clinically 
meaningful imbalance between treatment arms in the incidence of SAEs or the incidence of AESIs, 
or if there is a meaningful imbalance between treatment arms regarding efficacy endpoints.  
The design will allow for the addition o f new treatment arms with other anti -SARS -CoV -2 S 
protein mAbs as they become available for clinical testing (umbrella design), refinement of disease

including droppi[INVESTIGATOR_31081] a treatment arm, determination of phase 3 primary endpoints, and phase 3

[IP_ADDRESS].  Standard -of-Care Background Treatments  
Several putative COVID -[ADDRESS_114122] 
been au thorized, approved or allowed for compounding for use in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643], including 
remdesivir, convalescent plasma, and dexamethasone (refer to Section  1.6). Some of these 
products may be used as standard -of-care. Although there are some exceptions for treatments 
which may confound the effectiveness of the study drug, such as convalescent plasma (refer to 
Section  7.2.2  for exclusion criteria), the study design is generally flexible on the types of putative 
treatments used in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103145] -of-care.  
This study will compare REGN10933+REGN10987 to placebo, all given in addition to the local 
standard -of-care. Since the standard -of-care for COVID -[ADDRESS_114123] -of-care: 
antiviral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_88798] -antiviral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_103146]  8.6. Including this as a 
stratification factor will ensure an appropriate balance in treatment assignment across the different 
types of standard -of-care and allow evaluation of efficacy based on background treatments given.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Patient Population and Study Cohorts  
There is some evidence  that suggests baseline disease severity influences progression and 
outcomes of COVID19. In order to evaluate potential differential treatment effects across the 
spectrum of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60992] -19 patients, the study will be conducted and analyzed in 
4 coho rts* of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103131] -19 that require varying degrees of oxygen 
support at randomization:  
• Cohort 1A:  With COVID -19 symptoms but not requiring supplemental oxygen   
• Cohort 1 : Patients on low -flow oxygen supplementation  
• Cohort 2* : Patients requiring high -intensity oxygen therapy but not on mechanical 
ventilation  
• Cohort 3* : Patients requiring mechanical ventilation  
* Per IDMC recommendation first received on 30 October 2020, and reiterated through 
19 February  2021, patient enrollment in cohort 2 and cohort 3 has been placed on hold . 
See Section  6.1.3  for further details on the study cohort definitions.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Rationale for Primary Objectives  
Safety and Tolerability  
The primary objectives of phase 1 and phase 2 include safety and tolerability, evaluated by [CONTACT_103220] -emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) throughout the study and 
treatment -emergent adverse events of special interest (AESIs) through day 29. In addition, grade 
3 and grade 4 treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs) will be recorded to inform safety 
assessments in later phases of the study.  
                                        VV-RIM-00163777-1.0 Approved - 27 Aug 2021 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_114124] a complicated 
disease presentation at baseline that could quickly and unexpectedly deteriorate an d progress. As 
such, their TEAE profile will be complex and dynamic. Mainly due to their underlying disease, 
TEAEs are expected to progress or improve in severity and seriousness multiple times throughout 
the study. Accurately collecting such a large volum e of TEAEs could impose unnecessary burden 
on an already over -strained healthcare system and frequent exposure to infected patients could 
increase the risk of infection to the study staff.  
Evaluating targeted grade 3 or 4 TEAEs, treatment -emergent SAEs, an d treatment -emergent 
AESIs (grade ≥2 hypersensitivity reactions and grade ≥2 infusion -related reactions) will provide 
the most relevant safety information to adequately evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
REGN10933+REGN10987. This subset of grade [ADDRESS_114125] data on 
non-serious TEAEs (as well as serious TEAEs) in a parallel -conducted prophylaxis study 
(R10933 -[ZIP_CODE] -COV -2069) and a repeated dose study in adult volunteers (R10933 -[ZIP_CODE] -HV-
2093) with REGN10933+REGN10987, where the study population will not have a complicated 
disease presentation and there is a significantly lower risk of overburdening the health care delivery 
system.   
Clinical Efficacy  
The REGN10933+REGN10987 mAb combination therapy was created as a potential anti -viral 
treatment and (and as combination to prevent viral escape mutant s during treatment). The 
prospective hypothesis is that REGN10933+REGN10987 is intended to substitute for the 
endogenous immune response, that this endogenous response might be delayed or inadequate in 
some patients (eg, patients who are seronegative at ba seline) and that REGN10933+REGN10987 
might be expected to have most benefit in these seronegative patients who are still positive at 
baseline for the presence of virus in NP swabs based on a quantitative PCR test. Phase 1/2 data 
from the Sponsor’s parallel  study in outpatients with COVID -19 (R10933 -[ZIP_CODE] -COV -2067) 
prospectively validated these concepts (for both anti -viral activity and clinical benefit). 
R10933 -[ADDRESS_114126] and 
seronegative and/or in patient s with high viral load regardless of serologic status.  
The clinical efficacy endpoint that will be assessed is mechanical ventilation or death. This is a 
change from the endpoint initially planned for the study: a 7 -point ordinal scale (rating clinical 
status from death [1] to not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] [7]) used to assess changes in clinical status (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS].4 ). Emerging insights show that t he 7-point ordinal scale can be highly variable, 
particularly with respect to oxygen requirements as it depends heavily on the clinical judgement 
of the clinician. This variability makes it far less optimal for assessment of treatment effects, 
especially in relativel y small sample sizes. As such, the primary clinical efficacy assessment for 
phase 1/[ADDRESS_114127] severe clinical manifestati ons of COVID -

CONFIDENTIAL  19. Preventing patients from going on mechanical ventilation or from dying is a highly relevant 
clinical outcome and one that will be simpler for patients and providers to understand compared 
to the previously proposed endpoint of change in or dinal scale.  
The phase 1/[ADDRESS_114128] on excluding futility and then to assess clinical 
efficacy of REGN10933+REGN10987 on death or mechanical ventilation (see Section  11.4.9 ). 
An initial evaluation of futility will be performed to understand if there is a low probability of 
achieving statistical significance for the primary endpoint of mechanical ventilation or de ath. If 
the study as designed is determined not to be futile, subsequent assessments of efficacy will be 
performed hierarchically in populations mostly likely to benefit from a potent anti -viral – patients 
that have not mounted an efficient immune response , ie, those that are seronegative or with high 
viral load at baseline. Additional secondary endpoints will be assessed descriptively, including in 
other sets of patients (eg, positive at baseline for the presence of virus in NP swabs based on a 
quantitativ e PCR test and positive, positive at baseline for the presence of virus in NP swabs based 
on a quantitative PCR test and regardless of serologic status). If the study as designed is determined 
to be futile, all analyses of clinical endpoints will be descri ptive and plans for phase 3 will be 
reconsidered.  
Demonstration of a convincing benefit in patients who are seronegative and/or have high viral 
loads at baseline, and at least a neutral effect in other subsets of patients, would support 
REGN10933+REGN10987  being used in either a targeted fashion based on point of care testing 
that is now available in many hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], or possibly in the overall COVID -19 population depending 
on the specific results.  
Virologic Efficacy  
The primary mechanism of action of REGN109 33+REGN10987 is blockade of the S protein RBD 
interaction with ACE2, leading to decreased infection of host cells. Blocking viral entry would 
result in reductions in SARS -CoV -2 RNA replication, and corresponding viral load in affected 
tissues. In phase 1 a nd phase 2, the primary virologic endpoint will therefore evaluate, as proof of 
mechanism, the ability of REGN10933+REGN10987 to reduce viral load in the upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_14921]. day 22 (21 days after dosing) was initially chosen as the cutoff date for thi s analysis, based 
on accumulating evidence that this time period approaches the lower limit of detection in samples 
collected from the upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_103147] -19 
(He, 2020 ) (Cao, 2020 ) (Wang, 2020b ).  
Subsequently, the result of a phase 1/2 analysis in R10933 -[ZIP_CODE] -COV -2067 (outpatients) showed 
that the majority of viral clearance had occurred prior to day 7 (Weinreich, 2020 ), suggesting that 
analysis at earlier timepoints may also be of value in assessing virologic efficacy.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Rationale for Final Analysis of the Study  
On 30 October 2020, an Indep endent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) recommended pausing 
enrollment into cohort 2 and cohort 3 based on a potential safety imbalance, while proceeding with 
enrollment in cohort 1A and cohort 1. All cohort 2 and 3 patients enrolled at the time of the 
recommendation continued in the study and were followed up through the end of study visit as per 
the protocol. This IDMC recommendation on enrollment was maintained for the duration of the 
study.

CONFIDENTIAL  An unblinded phase 1/2 analysis was performed on the patients who were randomized through 
01 December 2020 in phase 1 (cohort 1 only) and phase 2 (cohorts 1, 2, and 3) using a data cutoff 
date of 09 December 2020, based on a database lock on 22 December 2020 (refer to the phase 1/2 
SAP dated 21 December 2020 for deta ils). Phase [ADDRESS_114129], and phase 3 cohort 1 started enrollment after 
01 December 2020. As cohort 1A  never reached its predetermined phase 2 enrollment goal of 1000 
patients, phase 2 cohort 1A and cohort 1 enrolled concurrently (refer to Section  7.1 for the number 
of patients enrolled in each phase by [CONTACT_9084]). Phase 2 cohort 1A data were handled and overseen 
similar to phase 3 cohort 1 data.  
Given much smaller sample size than anticipated as a result of early termination of enrollment, the 
Sponsor has  elected to pool phase 2 cohort 1A and phase 3 cohort 1 and combine the 
REGN10933+REGN10987 2.4g and 8.0g dose groups for the primary analyses. Analyses of each 
cohort alone and each dose alone will be descriptive and considered secondary.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Long COVID Sub-Study  
Long COVID encompasses a wide variety of heterogeneous neurological, neuropsychiatric, 
autonomic, and systemic symptoms, including fatigue, cognitive difficulties, mood dysregulation, 
dyspnea, coughing, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], chest pain, fever, and joint or muscle pain) and can be debilitating 
(Alwan, 2020 ) (del Rio, 2020 ). However, the clusters of symptoms reported by [CONTACT_103221] -
COVID -[ADDRESS_114130] of the symptoms there are no 
validated biomarkers for diagnosis of long COVID, with identification of l ong COVID largely 
constrained in medical practice to diagnostic exclusion (Burke, 2021 ).  
To address knowledge gaps in the etiology and symptomatology of long COVID, additional 
assessmen ts will be conducted as a sub -study at select sites. These assessments will evaluate 
patient -reported symptoms and related outcomes, to develop a better understanding of the nature 
of long COVID and to assess whether prior treatment with REGN10933+REGN1098 [ADDRESS_114131] of prior treatment

symptoms will be evaluated, including fu nctioning, impact on daily lives, and overall quality of

mechanisms contributing to the pathophysiology of post -acute COVID -[ADDRESS_114133] -critical illness  (Nalbandian, 2021 ) 
(Talla, 2021 ). Based on these data, as well as reports of biomarke rs and signatures observed in 
patients with long COVID (Nalbandian, 2021 ), an agnostic multiplex proteomic and 
transcriptomic profiling focused on the disease mechanism will be performed to gather additional 
insights in the sequelae of long COVID. The specific aims of this analysis are described i n 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] .  
3.2.2.  Rationale for Dose Selection  
This study will assess a single IV dose of REGN10933+REGN10987 as combination therapy in a 
1:1 ratio.  The 1:1 ratio for REGN10933+REGN10987 is thought to be appropriate as these are 
non-competing mAbs targeting non -overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_103150] S protein of SARS -
CoV -2, with similar in vitro binding and neutralization properties (for more informat ion, refer to 
the Investigator’s Brochure[s]). The study will evaluate the co -administered 
REGN10933+REGN10987 as combination therapy at an initial dose level of 2.4 g (1.2 g per mAb), 
which is expected to be an efficacious dose (see below). The study will  also evaluate 
REGN10933+REGN10987 at a higher dose, 8.0 g (4.0 g per mAb), in the event that a higher dose 
is required for efficacy.  
Cellular entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the S protein to a specific cellular receptor 
and subsequent S prote in priming by [CONTACT_103214]. ACE2 is the receptor for cellular entry of 
SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_114134] epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130] (Wu, 2020a ) (Xu, 2020 ) (Zhao, 2020 ). The 
strategy taken for dose selection in this study was to id entify a target concentration in lung 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_71444] (ELF) that approximates the effective concentration of 99% viral 
neutralization (EC 99)* observed against live virus SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_114135] SARS -CoV -2 is 0.14  µg/mL 
(REGN10933) and 0.78 µg/mL (REGN10987).  
An average lung ELF -to-serum mean C max ratio of ~0.[ADDRESS_114136] ions (Magyarics, 2019 ). It is 
assumed that the lung ELF -to-serum C max ratio is 0.15 for REGN10933 and REGN10987. Dividing 
the target lung ELF concentration b y this ratio, the associated serum concentration for these targets 
is therefore estimated to be ~at least 5 µg/mL for the combination of REGN10987+REGN10933.  
Taking into account uncertainties regarding mAb penetration into lung ELF, prediction of human 
PK, and effects of disease on PK, 20 µg/mL was selected as a target concentration in serum for the 
initial dose of REGN10933+REGN10987 combination therapy. The goal for the initial 
REGN10933+REGN10987 combination dose is for ≥95% of patients to exceed the tar get serum 
concentration for [ADDRESS_114137] human PK data for 
                                        VV-RIM-00163777-1.0 Approved - 27 Aug 2021 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_114138] an exogenous target (N=6 to 12 subjects per mAb), a single 
IV combination dose of 1.2 g per mAb is predicted to r esult in ≥95% of patients exceeding the 
target serum concentration for 28 days after dosing, for each mAb.

3.3. Risk -Benefit  
The anticipated risks and benefits of REGN10933+REGN10987 ( casirivimab+imdevimab) are 
informed by [CONTACT_103222], including data from phase 3 trials.  
For additional information concerning clinical and preclinical data, refer t o the Investigator’s 
Brochure.  
3.3.1.  Summary of Efficacy and Safety Profile in Clinical Trials  
Clinical trial data are summarized below. Overall, REGN10933+REGN10987 have demonstrated 
efficacy as an anti -viral agent for the treatment and prevention of COVID -19, across a variety of 
populations, and is generally well -tolerated with an acceptable safety profile.  
Clinical Benefit of REGN10933+REGN10987 in Clinical Trials for the Treatment of 
COVID -19. In COV -2067, the phase 3 outpatient treatment trial, a single IV dose of 
REGN10933+REGN10987 was shown (relative to placebo) to  reduce  COVID -19-related 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103151] -cause death by 71.3% (2400 mg dose) and 70.4% (1200 mg dose), reduce 
symptom duration by 4 days (2400 mg and 1200 mg), and reduce viral load over  the first 7 days. 
Serious adverse events occurred more frequently in the placebo group (4.0%) than in either 
treatment group (2400 mg, 1.1%; 1200 mg, 1.3%), and grade ≥2 infusion -related reactions were 
infrequent (<0.3% in all groups) (Weinreich, 2021b ). Similar virologic efficacy and a similar 
safety profile were observed in the phase 1/2 portion of this trial, which evaluated 
REGN10933+REGN10987 at 8000 mg and 2400 mg IV doses (Weinreich, 2021a ). 
Clinical Benefit of REGN10933+REGN10987 in Clinical Trials for the Prevention of 
COVID -19. In COV -2069, the phase [ADDRESS_114139], a single subcutaneou s (SC)  dose of REGN10933+REGN10987 (1200 mg) 
reduced (relative to placebo) symptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection by 81.4%, and reduced overall 
SARS -CoV -2 infection by 66.4 %. Serious adverse events occurred at similar frequencies in the 
treatment group (1%) and placebo group (1%). Injection -site reactions were more common in the 
treatment group (4%) compared to the placebo group (2%), but no injection -site reactions in the 
study were grade 3 or above.  The majority of injection site reactions occurred within 1 day and 
resolved within 2 days (O’Brien, 2021b ).  
Among a sub -group of individuals in COV -2069 who were identified as SARS -CoV -2 positive 
but asymptomatic during screening, a single SC dose of casirivimab and imdevimab (1200 mg) 
reduced (relative to placebo) progression to symptomatic disease by 31.5%, and reduced the 
duration of symptoms in those  that developed symptomatic infections. Injection -site reactions 
were more common in the treatment group (4%) compared to the placebo group (1%), but no 
injection -site reactions in the study were grade 3 or above (O’Brien, 2021a ).  
In COV -2069, e fficacy results were similar in adolescents (age 12 to <18) as observed in adults: 
0% of subjects in the 1200 mg SC treatment group experienced symptomatic infection, compare d

that observed in adults. Injection site reactions were more common in the treatment group (5.9%) 
compared to the placebo group (1.6%), but none were grade  3 or above in any group.  
In COV -2093, the adult volunteer study evaluating multiple doses of SC administration of 
REGN10933+REGN10987 (monthly dosing over 6 months), exploratory efficacy results showed 
benefit with chronic treatment for preventing COVID -19. This efficacy was balanced by [CONTACT_103223], where injection site reactions were more common in the treatment group 
(34.6%) compared with the placebo group (15.8%), but none were grade [ADDRESS_114140] ions were either self -limiting or manageable with over -the-counter 
medications.  
3.3.2.  Summary of Risks  
Important Identified Risks. As with other protein therapeutics, hypersensitivity reactions, 
including acute infusion -related reactions (IV administration) or i njection site reactions (SC 
administration), may develop immediately or within a few hours to days after study drug 
administration. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, infusion -related reactions or 
injection site reactions, have been observe d in patients who received REGN10933+REGN10987 
during ongoing clinical trials.  
Important Potential Risks. The important potential risks of REGN10933+REGN10987 are the 
clinical consequences of immunogenicity and embryo -fetal toxicity.  
Protein therapeutics c arry the potential risk of an immunogenic response in the form of anti-drug 
antibody ( ADA ) and N Ab development following administration, with possible consequences on 
safety and efficacy. Therefore, blood samples for immunogenicity assessment will be colle cted 
during the studies.  
Reproductive and developmental toxicology studies have not been conducted; therefore, the 
effects of REGN10933, REGN10987, and REGN10933+REGN10987 combination therapy on the 
fetus and reproductive organs in males and females are u nknown. Human immunoglobulin G1 
(IgG1) antibodies are known to cross the placental barrier and are present in breast milk; therefore, 
the REGN10933+REGN10987 combination therapy have the potential to be transferred from the 
mother to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_103152] a breastfed child . Given the high affinity and specificity of 
REGN10933 and REGN10987, off -target pharmacological effects are not anticipated in either the 
mother or the fetus, and no off -target binding of REGN10933 or REGN10987 was observed in 
any of t he human or monkey tissues evaluated ex vivo in tissue cross -reactivity studies. However, 
it is unknown whether the potential transfer of the combination of REGN10933+REGN10987 
therapy provides any treatment benefit or risk to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_103152] a bre astfed child . 
There is currently limited clinical experience in the use of REGN10933, REGN10987, and 
REGN10933+REGN10987 combination therapy in female patients who are pregnant or 
breastfeeding. The combination of REGN10933+REGN10987 therapy should be used  during 
pregnancy or breastfeeding only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the mother 
and the fetus or breastfed child considering all associated health factors. If a female patient is 
pregnant or were to become pregnant while receiv ing REGN10933+REGN10987 combination, 
the pregnancy should be followed until outcome and any safety issue observed get reported.

CONFIDENTIAL  Other Theoretical Considerations . Theoretical risks of administration of the 
REGN10933+REGN10987 combination include interferen ce with the patient’s endogenous 
immune response to either SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_114141] COVID -19. In this study, 
risk mitigation includes exclusion criteria for certain vaccination scenarios (refer to Section  7.2.2 ). 
A reference to current CDC guidance is provided (Section  8.10.1 ) to aid investigators on 
appropriate management of COVID -19 vaccination.  
Antibody -dependent enhancement (ADE) has been observed for some therapeutics targeting 
exogenous viral proteins. For antibody therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], ADE is thought to occur when binding of 
antibody t o the target viral protein enhances Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) -mediated host cell entry 
of the virus (Iwasaki, 2020 ). This could potentially lead to worsening of disease and, in the case 
of SARS, acute lung injury (Liu, 2019 ). REGN10933 and REGN10987 retain the Fc region, as 
this may play a role in protecting against viral infection (Yasui, 2014 ), there is no strong evidence 
of ADE in other coronavirus models (Kam, 2007 ) (Liu, 2019 ) (Luo, 2018 ). To date, Fc -containing 
mAbs developed by [CONTACT_103224] -CoV have demonstrated specificity to 
their exogenous targets with no significant unexpected safety findings in preclinical or clinical 
studies. All patients will have follow -up assessments by [CONTACT_103225].  
Pediatric Population.  Emerging data suggest that the pediatric population is equally vulnerable 
to SARS -COV -2 infection, and may contribute significantly to viral transmission (Wang, 2016 ) 
(Weingartl, 2004 ). Moreover, neonatal transmission of SARS CoV -[ADDRESS_114142] of the pediatric population can also be at risk of infection (Lewis, 
2020 ) (Szablewski, 2020 ). If infected, the burden of severe disease in pediatric patients that 
become symptomatic and develop COVID -19 seem to be greater in those with underlying medical 
conditions. REGN10933+REGN10987 was safe and well -tolerated in the adult population and no 
new safety signals were identified in the adolescent population (>12 years). As it is an exogenous 
target, the safety of REGN10933+REGN10987 is not anticipated to be different from that observed 
in the adult patients. Additionally, nonclinical toxicology stu dies have not shown any safety 
findings including no tissue cross -reactivity to human fetal tissues. These data therefore favor 
assessing the safety and efficacy of REGN10933+REGN10987 in pediatric patients (for more 
information on dose rationale for these  patients, refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Summary. Overall, the anticipated benefit of REGN10933+REGN10987 combination therapy in 
treatment of infection with SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_114143].

6.1.6.  Definition of Study Completion  
For individual patients, study completion is defined as collection of vital status  information on 
their projected EOS date. All measures will be taken to obtain vital status information on the 
projected EOS date, and all patients with recorded vital status information at projected EOS date 
will be considered study completers. The end of  study is considered day 169 (for phase 1) or day  57 
(for phase 2) (Section  9.1).  
6.2. Study Committees  
6.2.1.  Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
An IDMC wil l actively review data throughout the study to monitor patient safety and efficacy 
data. The IDMC can make recommendations about early study closure or changes to the study 
conduct. The operation of the IDMC is governed by a charter describing further deta ils, such as 
procedures (including but not limited to periodic safety monitoring) and requirements for reporting 
its observations to the Sponsor.  
An IDMC will review pooled safety data up to day 3 in the sentinel safety group as described in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . In addition, the IDMC will conduct periodic data reviews, for instance, after all 
patients are enrolled into phase 1. Additional periodic reviews w ill be conducted during phase [ADDRESS_114155] involvement in the study. Reviews will assess the totality of evidence 
and may be used to determine study adaptations (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
6.3. Planned Interim Analysis  
A description of the statistical methods to be employed is in Section  11.5, and blinding 
implications are discussed i n Section  8.7. 
No interim analyses are planned.

PATIENTS  
7.1. Number of Patients Enrolled  
See Section  8.1 for treatment arms . 
On 30 October 2020, an IDMC recommended pausing patient enrollment into cohort 2 and 
cohort  3 based on a potential safety imbalance, while proceeding with enrollment in co horts 1A 
and 1. This IDMC recommendation was reiterated through 19 February 2021, and study 
investigators were advised by [CONTACT_103231]. This IDMC recommendation on enrollmen t was maintained for the 
duration of the study.  
Subsequently, on 09 April 2021, the Sponsor made a business decision to terminate patient 
enrollment due to low recruitment rates. This decision was not based on any safety concerns. 
Accordingly, phase 3 coh ort 1 and phase 2 cohort 1A enrollment were prematurely terminated due 
to slow enrollment rate. Until this time, only cohort 1 patients were enrolled into the phase 3 
portion of the study.  
Overall, approximately 2252 patients were randomized in this study:   
Phase 1  
• Cohort 1 : 60 patients  
Phase 2  
• Cohort 1A : 609 patients  
• Cohort 1 : 629 patients  
• Cohort 2 : 164 patients  
• Cohort 3 : 35 patients  
Prematurely terminated phase 3  
• Cohort 1  (ie, patients randomized after 01 December 2020): [ADDRESS_114156] meet the following criteria to be eligible for inclusion in the study:

Table  9 to get the appropriate high -altitude equivalents for sea -level  oxygenation 
measurements.  
c. Cohort 2*:  High -intensity oxygen therapy without mechanical ventilation, where high -
intensity is defined as receiving supplemental oxygen delivered by 1 of the following 
devices:  
− Non-rebreather mask (with an SpO 2 ≤96% while receiving an oxygen flow rate of 
at least 10 L/min)  
− High -flow device (eg, AIRVO™ or Optiflow™) with at least 50% FiO 2

7. Patients who have received convalescent plasma, IVIG, or mAbs against SARS -CoV -2 
(eg, bamlanivimab) within [ADDRESS_114159] prior to the screening visit  
Note: The use of remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, or other treatments (except for 
COVID -19 convalescent plasma or IVIG) being used for COVID -[ADDRESS_114160] -of-care o r an open -label study or compassionate use protocol 
is permitted.  
9. Any physical examination findings, history of illness, and/or concomitant medications that, 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_103160], might confound the results of the study or pose an 
addit ional risk to the patient by [CONTACT_47361].  
10. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to components of study drug  
11. Pregnant or breastfeeding women  
12. Continued sexual activity in women of childbearing potential (WOCBP)* or sexually 
active men who a re unwilling to practice highly effective contraception prior to the initial 
dose/start of the first treatment, during the study, and for at least [ADDRESS_114161] 
dose.  
Highly effective contraceptive measures in women include:  
• Stable use of combi ned (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception 
(oral, intravaginal, transdermal) or progestogen -only hormonal contraception (oral, 
injectable, implantable) associated with inhibition of ovulation initiated 2 or more 
menstrual cycles prior  to screening  
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal ligation  
• Vasectomized partner,† and/or  
• Sexual abstinence‡,§ 
Male study participants with WOCBP partners are required to use condoms unless they 
are vasecto mized† or practice sexual abstinence.‡,§ 
* WOCBP are defined as women who are fertile following menarche until becoming 
postmenopausal, unless permanently sterile. A postmenopausal state is defined as no 
menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating 
hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal 
replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12  months of amenorrhea, a single

CONFIDENTIAL  FSH measurement is insufficient to determine the occurrence of a postmenopausal 
state. The above definitions are according to Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) 
guidance. Pregnancy testing and contraception are not required for women with 
documented hysterectomy or tubal ligation. Permanent sterilization methods include 
hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], and bilateral oophorectomy.  
† Vasectomized partner or vasectomized study participant must have received medical 
assessment of the surgic al success.  
‡ Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining 
from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study 
drugs. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated  in relation to the 
duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
§ Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal 
(coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) are 
not acceptable methods of contraception. Female condom and male condom should 
not be used together.  
7.3. Premature Withdrawal from the Study  
A patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, and without 
repercussi on. 
The investigator and/or Sponsor have the right to withdraw a patient from the study if it is no 
longer in the interest of the patient to continue in the study, or if the patient’s continuation in the 
study places the scientific outcome of the study at risk (eg, if a patient does not or cannot follow 
study procedures). An excessive rate of withdrawals would render the study uninterpretable; 
therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of patients should be avoided.  
Patient  who are withdrawn prematurely from the study will be asked to complete an early 
termination visit and have follow -up contact [CONTACT_103234]  9.1.3 . 
7.4. Replacement of Patients  
Patients prematurely discontinued from study will not be replaced.

Selected individuals from the Sponsor not involved in the conduct of the study may have access 
to unblinded phase 1 or phase 2 data as needed for safety review or other data review (see 
Section  6.2.2 ). The team performing the interim data reviews will be separate from the ongoing 
study team. No study personnel involved in the day -to-day conduct of the study will have access 
to any unblinded data before the database is locked for this study.  
Anti-drug an tibody, drug concentration, and biomarker results will not be communicated to the 
sites, and the Sponsor’s blinded operational team will not have access to results associated with 
patient identification until after the database is locked.  
8.8. Emergency Unblinding  
Unblinding of treatment assignment for a patient may be necessary due to a medical emergency or 
any other significant medical event (eg,  pregnancy) and when a treatment decision is contingent 
on knowing the patient’s treatment assignment.  
If un blinding is required:  
• Only the investigator will make the decision to unblind the treatment assignment  
• Only the affected patients will be unblinded  
• Unblinding is performed using the IWRS, which will notify the Sponsor. The 
designated study pharmacist(s)/de signee at the study site will provide the treatment 
assignment to the investigator. If the study pharmacist(s)/designee is not available, the 
investigator for the site will unblind the patient.  
• If the IWRS is unavailable, the investigator will ask the unb linded study 
pharmacist(s)/designee to perform manual unblinding. All manual unblinding 
procedure will be adequately documented, including the reason why the IWRS was not 
used.

1. Every effort should be made to perform all screening and baseline activities on the same 
day. Randomization within the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system and 
administration of study drug should occur on the same day (day 1). All samples will be 
collected befo re study drug administration at the baseline visit except post -infusion PK 
samples.  
2. For a given day, the visit may occur in clinic, as a home -based visit (defined as visits by 
[CONTACT_103242], at mobile units, and/or testing centers), or by [CONTACT_648]. A ll samples 
will be collected as indicated whether the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103165].  
3. Patients must provide separate consent to collect blood samples as part of the optional 
pharmacogenomics (PGx) sub -study. Blood sample for RNA must be col lected pre -dose 
on day 1. Blood sample for DNA should be collected at the screening/baseline visit but 
may be collected at any visit.  
4. Refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  for diagnostic test requirements during screening.  
5. Medical history should include collecting onset of pneumonia symptoms.  
6. Vital signs (including respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and SpO 2) 
will be taken as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] .  
For patients in the phase 1 sentinel safety group only  (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), vital signs will 
be taken once before the infusion, every [ADDRESS_114170] 2 hours after the infusion is completed, and then once per hour for the following 
4 hours. For all other  patients , vital signs will be taken once before the infusion and once 
after the infusion is completed.  
7. Only TEAEs (grade 3 or 4), treatment -emergent SAEs, and treatment -emergent AESIs will 
be recorded in the eCRF.  
8. Patients discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103166] -up fo r TEAEs (grade 3 or 
4), treatment -emergent SAEs, treatment -emergent AESIs, and/or targeted concomitant

CONFIDENTIAL  9.2.5.  Efficacy Procedu res  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Sample Collection for RT -qPCR Analysis  
Virologic samples will be used to determine presence or absence of SARS -CoV -2 virus, including 
at baseline, and to measure viral load via RT -qPCR analysis. Samples may additionally be used 
for exploratory viral R NA sequencing (NP, nasal, saliva) and/or viral culture (NP, nasal). Only NP 
swabs will be collected for virology testing after phase 1. NP samples with an original RT -qPCR 
result above the Upper Limit of Quantification (ULOQ) will be diluted and retested b y RT -qPCR. 
Additional details regarding sample collection and analysis can be found in the laboratory manual.  
Patient refusal to provide virologic samples will not be noted as a protocol deviation.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Clinical and Oxygen Status  
Clinical and oxygen status will be collected and recorded in the eCRF as follows:  
• Oxygen delivery device status:  day 2: record the worst status since 2 hours after EOI 
up to 00:00 on day 2; day 3 and later: record the worst status in the past 24  hours (00: 00 
to 00:00) of that study day (eg, for day 3, record the worst status between 00:00 and 
23:59 on day 3).  
• Vital Status:  Record vital status (dead or alive) of the day and record any death (if 
applicable) on the day of death.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103171]:  Starting on day 2, record daily whether patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103172].  
These records will be used to calculate the daily ordinal scale (Section  [IP_ADDRESS].4 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Oxygen Delivery Device Status  
The type of oxygen delivery device used will be recorded (eg, nasal cannula, simple face mask, 
non-rebreather mask, non -invasive ventilation, or invasive mechanical ventilation).  
The most invasive type of oxygen devices used in the past 24 hours (00:00 to 00:00) will be 
recorded.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Vital Status

9.2.8.  Exploratory Pharmacodynamic/Biomarker Procedures  
This section describes planned exploratory analyses, some of which may not be reported in the 
CSR.  
Note that any biological samples collected during the study which are not used for their planned 
purpose, or for which material remains after their planned analysis, may be kept for up 15 years 
after study completion (or for a shorter time period if required per regional laws and regulations) 
for u se in exploratory research  related to how the study drugs work and to study SARS -CoV -2. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Virology  
Viral Sequencing  
In support of public health initiatives to track SARS -CoV -2 genetic variants, as well as to monitor 
for possible viral resistance, viral genom e sequencing will be performed on all viral nucleic acid 
isolated from NP, nasal swab, and/or saliva samples, at baseline and in cases of a positive RT -
qPCR result. Sequencing analyses will consist of the entire viral genome, including the full gene 
sequen ce that encodes the SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_114185] -treatment samples to assess the emergence of 
sequence variants and to understand the potential relationship between genetic mutations and mAb 
functional activity. Viral sequencing may also be done on placebo controls to determine whether

CONFIDENTIAL  any genetic mutations observed in the mAb treatment group are naturally emergent genetic 
variants.   
Viral variants suspected to confer decreased susceptibility to REGN10933 and/or REGN109 87 
will be evaluated in nonclinical work separate from this protocol.  
The results of the viral sequencing may not be included in the CSR.  
Viral Infectivity  
To explore the effects of REGN10933+REGN10987 on infectivity of SARS -CoV -2, we may use 
plaque formin g unit (PFU), viral culture, or subgenomic mRNA viral RT -qPCR assays. In vitro 
SARS -CoV -2 infectivity of cultured cells may be explored using NP samples. Infectivity of cells 
grown in culture may be assessed by [CONTACT_103245]/or immunofluorescence assays. We may also 
use sub -genomic viral mRNA transcript assays, such as RT -qPCR or subgenomic mRNA 
sequencing, or other measures of in vivo infectivity potential. Viral sub -genomic mRNA is 
transcribed only in infected cells and is not packaged into virions, and therefore an indicator of 
actively -infected cells. These data may be associated with other RT -qPCR measuring viral load.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Hematology for Complete Blood Count and Differential  
Neutrophil -lymphocyte ratio (NLR) will be assessed, as well as other hematologica l biomarkers. 
NLR is an inflammatory marker that may serve as an independent risk factor for in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103175] -19. Assessment of NLR trends may therefore aid in identifying 
patients with COVID -19 who are at higher risk of complic ations (Liu, 2020 ) (Qin, 2020 ). 
Relationships will be evaluated between NLR and c linical outcomes in treatment versus placebo 
arms.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Serum and Plasma for Disease Biomarkers  
Changes in concentrations of serum/plasma biomarkers associated with inflammation and disease 
progression will be assessed, including the relationship between concen tration changes and clinical 
outcomes in treatment versus placebo arms. The association between changes in disease related 
biomarkers with clinical endpoints will be evaluated.  
Biomarkers may include (but are not limited to) CRP, LDH, D -Dimer, and ferriti n will be assessed 
as exploratory endpoints. CRP is a general inflammation marker that correlates with severity of 
COVID -19 including lung lesions, supplemental O 2 requirements, and death (Qin, 2020 ) (Young, 
2020) (Wang, 2020a ) (Ruan, 2020 ) (Luo, 2020 ). LDH was identified as a predictive factor for 
early recognition of lung injury and advanced COVID -19 cases (Han, 2020 ). Ferritin is a general 
inflammation marker associated wit h severity of COVID -19 (Qin, 2020 ). D-dimer levels >1 
μg/mL have been reported to identify patients with poor prognosis for COVID -19 (Zhou, 2020 ).

Research serum and plasma are being collected and banked for exploratory research related to 
COVID -19, S ARS -CoV -2, REGN10933+REGN10987, host and viral biological pathways, and 
other mechanisms related to disease activity and clinical outcomes.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Complement  
Complement activation has been hypothesized to contribute to the maladaptive inflammatory 
response seen in some patients with advanced COVID -19. Circulating complement biomarker 
concentrations may be assessed in order to understand the involvement of the classical lectin 
and/or alternative complement pathways in the pathogenesis of COVID -19 and clinical outc omes.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Cytokines  
The initial inflammatory responses to an infection are rapid and non -specific, regulated by 
[CONTACT_103246] -6 (IL -6). As IL -6 has been implicated in the 
severity of COVID -19, IL -6 and other cytokines, including  but not limited to, IL -8, IL -1ß, IFNγ, 
TNFα, IL -10 and MIP -1 may be measured. Additional cytokines may be interrogated through the 
use of cytokine panels.

2020 ) (Shi, 2020 ). Relationships may be evaluated between these biomarkers, as well as other 
biomarkers and clinical outcomes in treatment versus placebo arms . 
If initial analyses reveal no signal of cardiac injury, subsequent analyses may be omitted.  
9.2.9.  Long COVID Sub -Study (at Participating Sites)  
To better understand the nature of long COVID, as well as the potential relationship between prior 
treatment of SARS -CoV -2 infection with REGN10933+REGN10987 and subsequent 
development of long COVID, study participants in this sub -study will be evaluated u sing 
questionnaires (SE -LC19, PGIS, PGIC return to usual health, return to usual activities, SF -36, 
WPAI+CIQ, EQ -5D-5L), as well as NP swab and blood sample collections. All questionnaires

CONFIDENTIAL  Global Impression Items  
The Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) questionnaire will assess the overall subjective 
experience of COVID -[ADDRESS_114193] of health. A score from 0 to 100 
is generated for each scale, where higher scores represent less disability on the scale. The scales 
are further aggregated into two summary scores (also ranging from 0 to 100), which measure 
overall physical health and mental health.  
WPAI+CIQ  
The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment and Classroom Impairment Questions 
(WPAI+CIQ) questionnaire measur es the effect of a specific health problem (eg, infection with 
SARS -CoV -2) on work productivity and activity impairment. The specific outcomes measured by 
[CONTACT_103248] (work time missed), presenteeism (impairment while working), 
overal l work impairment (absenteeism plus presenteeism), and activity impairment (impairment 
in regular activities). Each score is represented as a percentage, with higher scores indicating less 
productivity or greater impairment.  
EQ-5D-5L  
The EQ -5D-5L covers 5  health domains: mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain, and anxiety. 
Patients rate each domain on 5 level severity scale: having no problems, having slight problems, 
having moderate problems, having severe problems, and being unable to do/having extr eme 
problems. In addition to the [ADDRESS_114194] their overall health on a visual analog scale,

Assessment)  
Nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples will be collected to assess the presence or absence of 
SARS -CoV -2 by [CONTACT_937] -qPCR, and may be used for viral sequencing as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  
Additional details regarding sample collection can be found in the laboratory manual.  
Serum, plasma, and PBMC samples will be collected and banked for subsequent analyses. Such 
analyses may include, but are not limited to, multiplex proteomic profiling, high -throughput RNA 
sequencing, flow cytometry, and serologic immunoassays to detect antibodies against 
SARS -CoV -2.  
The serum, plasma, and PBMC -based analyses will be used to address scientific questions rela ted 
to long COVID, such as the identification of prognostic biomarkers, understanding whether long 
COVID represents a single versus multiple unique pathologies, and associating biomarker profiles 
with patient -reported outcomes data. Analyses performed from  banked samples may also be 
integrated with biomarker and other data from samples that were collected during the acute phase 
of SARS -CoV -2 infection. This will enable relationships between acute and long -term phases of 
COVID -19 to be explored, including be tter understanding the biology of COVID -19 over time,

of diagnosis, and any other available information) will be captured in the corresponding AESI data 
collection page.  
9.2.10.  Pharmacogenomic Analysis (Optional)  
Eligible patients who agree to participate in the genomics sub -study will be re quired to consent to 
this optional sub -study before collection of samples. When enrollment was open, newly -enrolled 
patients had blood samples collected for both DNA and RNA. Patients who are currently enrolled 
and subsequently consent to the sub -study wil l only have a blood collection for DNA. Patients 
who have already consented to this sub -study cannot consent a second time.  
The blood sample for RNA must be collected pre -dose on day 1. Blood sample for DNA should 
be collected at the screening/baseline vis it but may be collected at any visit.  
The samples  will be collected for pharmacogenomics analyses to understand the genetic and/or 
transcriptional determinants of efficacy and safety associated with the treatments in this study and 
the molecular basis of COVID -19 (and long COVID, as applicable).  These samples will be single -
coded as defined by [CONTACT_25039] (ICH) guideline E15. Samples 
will be stored for up to 15 years after the final date of the database lock (or for a shorte r time period 
if required per regional laws and regulations). If there are specific site or country requirements 
involving the pharmacogenomic analyses which the Sponsor is unable to comply with, samples 
will not be collected at those sites.  
The purpose o f the pharmacogenomic analyses is to identify genomic and/or transcriptional 
associations with clinical or biomarker response to REGN10933+REGN10987, other COVID -19 
clinical outcome measures and possible treatment -emergent SAEs and AESIs. In addition, 
associations between genomic variants and prognosis or progression of COVID -19 (and long

CONFIDENTIAL  COVID, as applicable). may also be studied.  These data may be used or combined with data 
collected from other studies to identify and validate genomic and transcriptional markers related 
to the study drug, target pathway, COVID -19, or long COVID.  
Analyses may include sequence determination or single nucleotide polymorphism studies of 
candidate genes and surrounding genomic regions. Other methods, including whole -exome 
seque ncing, whole -genome sequencing, DNA copy number variation, and transcriptome 
sequencing (or other methods for quantitating RNA expression) may also be performed. The list 
of methods may be expanded to include novel methodology that may be developed during the 
course of this study or sample storage period.  
Results from the genomic and transcriptional analyses will not be reported in the CSR.  
10. SAFETY EVALUATION AN D REPORTING  
10.1. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
10.1.1.  General Guidelines  
In this study, only target ed treatment -emergent AEs will be recorded:  
• All phases: Treatment -emergent AESIs (grade ≥2 hypersensitivity and grade ≥2 IRRs; 
see Section  10.1.3 ) 
• All phases, including long COVID sub -study:  Treatment -emergent SAEs  
• Phase 1 only:  TEAEs (grade 3 or grade 4 only)  
• Long COVID sub -study only:  positive SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_114197] result, from the d ay of 
consent to sub -study until day 180  
• Long COVID sub -study only: Any new medical condition that was diagnosed after 
randomization, until day [ADDRESS_114198] treatment -emergent SAEs, treatment -emergent AESIs), and 
(in phase 1 on ly) grade 3 or 4 TEAEs occurring during the observation period (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). Medical conditions that existed or were diagnosed prior to the si gning of the 
informed consent will be recorded as part of medical history. Abnormal laboratory values and vital 
signs observed at the time of informed consent should also be recorded as medical history. Any 
subsequent worsening (ie, any clinically signific ant change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre -
existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug should also be 
recorded as TEAE, provided that it fulfills the above criteria.  
Throughout the study, the investigator will de termine whether any treatment -emergent SAEs, 
treatment -emergent AESIs, and (in phase 1 only) grade [ADDRESS_114199] assess all TEAEs to 
determine seriousness, severity, and causality, in accordance with the definit ions in Section  10.2. 
The investigator’s assessment must be clearly documented in the site’s source documentation with 
the investigator’s signature. The investigator should follow up on TEAEs (grade 3 or 4), treatment -
                                        VV-RIM-00163777-1.0 Approved - 27 Aug 2021 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_114200] a common diagnosis, 
report them as individual entries.  
Laborat ory results, vital signs, and other diagnostic result s or findings  should be appraised by [CONTACT_103249] 
(grade 3 or 4), treatment -emergent SAEs, or treatment -emergent  AESIs and will need to be 
reported.  Isolated abnormal laboratory results, vital sign findings, or other diagnostic findings (ie, 
not part of a reported diagnosis) should be reported as TEAEs if they fulfill reporting criteria for 
the study (ie, treatment -emergent SAE, treatment -emergent AESI, TEAE [grade 3 or 4]) or require 
corrective treatment.  
For events that are serious due to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the reason for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31558] (diagnosis or symptom requiring ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_059]). A procedure is not 
an AE or SAE, but the reason for the procedure may be an AE or SAE. Pre -planned (prior to 
signing the informed consent form [ICF]) procedure s, treatment s requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5912] -
existing conditions that do not w orsen in severity, and admission for palliative or social care should 
not be reported as SAEs (see Section  10.2 for definitions).  
For deaths, the und erlying or immediate cause of death should always be reported as an SAE.  
Any treatment -emergent SAE that may occur subsequent to the reporting period (end of study) 
that the investigator assesses as related to study drug should also be reported.  
All treat ment -emergent SAEs , treatment -emergent AESIs, and pregnancies are to be reported 
according to the procedures in Section  10.1.3 .  
Note that patient -reported outcome (PRO) data (eg, patient -reported questionnaires, surveys, and 
instruments) are generally not reportable as individual AEs. However, if the investigator is made 
aware of any AE that (in his or her judgement) is related to study drug, the AE will be reported 
and recorded as described in Section  10.1.2 . 
10.1.2.  Reporting Procedure  
All treatment -emergent SAEs, treatment -emergent AESIs, and (in phase  1 only) treatment -
emergent grade [ADDRESS_114201] be reported with investigator’s assessment of the event’s 
seriousness, severity, and causality to the blinded study drug. A detailed narrative summarizing 
the course of the event, including its evaluation, treatment, and outcome should be provided on the 
AE eCRF. Specific or estimated dates of event onset, treatment, and resolution should be included, 
when available. Medical history, concomitant medications, relevant concomitant procedures, and 
laboratory da ta that are relevant to the event should also be summarized in the narrative. For fatal 
events, the narrative should state whether an autopsy was or will be performed and include the 
results if available. Information not available at the time of the initia l report must be documented 
in a follow -up report. Source documents  (including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24925], diagnostic reports, 
etc) will be summarized in the narrative on the AE eCRF and retained at the  study center and 
available upon request.

complete data possible within each follow -up.  
10.1.3.  Events that Require Expedi ted Reporting to Sponsor  
The following events also require reporting to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of 
learning of the event:  
• Treatment -emergent  SAEs  
• Treatment -emergent AESIs (serious and nonserious), defined as:  
− Grade ≥2 infusion -related rea ctions  
− Grade ≥2 hypersensitivity reactions  
• Pregnancy:  Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, it is the responsibility of the 
investigator to report to the Sponsor (or designee), within [ADDRESS_114203] dose of study drug. Any complication of 
pregnancy affecting a female study patient or female partner of a male study patient, 
and/or fetus an d/or newborn that meets the SAE criteria must be reported as an SAE. 
Outcome for all pregnancies should be reported to the Sponsor . 
10.1.4.  Other Adverse Events of Special Interest That Do Not Require Expedited 
Reporting to Sponsor  
The following is considered an A ESI and will require additional data collection (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
However, th ese AESI s do not require expedited reporting to the Sponsor:  
• Long COVID sub-study only: positive SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_114204] result  
• Long COVID sub -study only: any new medical condition that was diagnosed after 
randomization   
10.2. Definitions  
10.2.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a study drug which may or 
may not have a causal relationship with the study drug. Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease which is temporally 
associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug (ICH 
E2A Guideline. Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions an d Standards for Expedited 
Reporting, Oct 1994).  
10.2.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated 
to study drug (eg, a car accident in  which a patient is a passenger).

CONFIDENTIAL  • Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the patient is at immediate risk of 
death at the time of the event. This does not include an adverse event that had occurred 
in a more severe form, might have caused d eath.  
• Requires in -patient re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (readmission after discharge) or prolongation 
of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31561] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]

existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31561] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103177] a new adverse event 
as determined by [CONTACT_31598].  
• Resul ts in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event – Important medical events may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient or 
may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above 
(eg, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; 
blood d yscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse).  
Criteria for reporting SAEs must be followed for these events.  
10.2.3.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An AESI (serious or non -serious) is one of  scientific and medical interest specific to the Sponsor’s 
product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_103250]. Such an event might warrant further investigation in order to 
charact erize and understand it.  
Adverse events of special interest for this study are defined in Section  10.1.3 .  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Infusion -Related Reactions and Hypersensitivity  
Infusion -related  reactions are defined as any relevant adverse events that occurs during the infusion 
or up to day 4.  
Hypersensitivity react ions are defined as any relevant adverse event that occurs during the infusion 
or up to study day 29.  
10.2.4.  Severity  
The severity of adverse events (including test findings classified as adverse events) will be graded 
using the current version of the NCI -CTCAE v 5.0 (Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis 
[DCTD], 2020). TEAEs that are evaluated as CTCAE grade 3 or 4 will be collected in addition to 
treatment -emergent SAEs and treatment -emergent AESIs as discussed above.  
Treatment -emergent AEs, treatment -emerg ent SAEs, or treatment -emergent AESIs not listed in 
the NCI -CTCAE will be graded according to the scale in Table  5.

10.2.5.  Causality  
The Investigator must provide causality assessment as whether or not there is a r easonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event, based on evidence or facts, his/her clinical 
judgment, and the following definitions. The causality assessment must  be made based on the 
available information and can be updated as new informati on becomes available.  
The following factors should be considered when assessing causality:  
• Temporal relationship: time to onset versus time drug was administered  
• Nature of the reactions: immediate versus long term  
• Clinical and pathological features of the events  
• Existing information about the drug & same class of drugs  
• Concomitant medications  
• Underlying and concurrent illnesses  
• Patient’s medical and social history  
Causality to the study drug (including study dr ug administration):

10.3. Safety Monitoring  
The investigator will monitor the safety of study patient  at his/her site(s) as per the requirements 
of this protocol and consistent with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Any questions or 
concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor in a timely fashion. The Sponsor will monitor the 
safety data from across all study sites. The Medical/Study Director will have primary responsibility 
for the emerging safety profile of the compound, but will be supported by [CONTACT_25047] 
(eg, Global Patient Safety; Biostatistics and Data Management). Safety monitoring will be 
performed on an ongoing basis (eg, individual review of SAEs) and on a periodic cumulative 
aggregate basis.  
10.4. Notifying Health Authorities, Institutional Review Board, Ethics 
Committee, and Investigators  
During the study, the Sponsor and/or the CRO will i nform health authorities, ECs/Institutional 
Review Board (IRBs), and the participating investigators of any S[LOCATION_003]Rs (Suspected Unexpected 
Serious Adverse Reactions) occurring in other study centers or other studies of the active study 
drug, as appropriate p er local reporting requirements. In addition, the Sponsor and/or CRO will 
comply with any additional local safety reporting requirements. All notifications to investigators 
will contain only blinded information.   
Upon receipt of the Sponsor’s notification of a S[LOCATION_003]R that occurred with the study drug, the 
investigator will inform the IRB/EC unless delegated to the Sponsor.

At the completion of the study, the Sponsor will report all safety observations made during the 
conduct of the trial in the Clinical Study Report to health authorities and ECs/IRB as appropriate.  
11. STATISTICAL PLAN   
This section provides the basis for the statistical analysis plans (SAPs) for the study. There will be 
separate SAPs for different portions of the study. The phase 1/2 SAP(s) specified the analysis for 
portions of phase 1 and phase 2 patients. The phase 1 /2/[ADDRESS_114206] database lock in each portion of the study.  
Endpoints are listed in Section  4. Analysis variables are listed in  Section  5.  
Overview of the Final Statistical Analysis Plan  
This final SAP outlines the strategy and statistical methods to be used in the final analysis of data 
from all phases and all cohorts in the p rematurely terminated study COV -2066, as below:  
Efficacy Analysis  
The efficacy analysis will be performed for the modified full analysis set (mFAS, defined in 
Section  11.3) of the following pooled cohort of patients and individual subsidiary cohorts, 
representing the totality of patients in this prematurely terminated study who were not unblinded 
in the database lock on 22 December 2020. In this documen t, the prematurely terminated phase 3 
cohort 1 is referred as phase 3 cohort 1 and prematurely terminated phase 2 cohort 1A as phase 2 
cohort 1A.  
• Pooled phase 3 cohort 1 and phase 2 cohort 1A  
• Phase 3 cohort 1  
• Phase 2 cohort 1A  
In each of these data sets ( ie, the 2 prematurely terminated cohorts and the pooled cohort), the 
analyses will be conducted in the mFAS for the following patient populations. The mFAS is 
defined as patients that have a positive central -lab confirmed SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR result from 
an NP swab sample and the efficacy analysis was conducted in the mFAS to ensure detectable 
virus was present at baseline.  
• Seronegative mFAS  
• High Viral Load mFAS, where high viral load is defined as >106 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL at baseline  
• Overall mFAS  
The primary  virologic endpoint is time -weighted average change from baseline viral load in 
nasopharyngeal (NP) samples through Day 7. The primary analysis will be performed in the 
Seronegative mFAS population that is combined across the 2.4 g and 8g doses and pooled across 
phase 3 cohort 1 and phase 2 cohort 1A.  
                                        VV-RIM-00163777-1.0 Approved - 27 Aug 2021 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_114207] would occur only after achieving several days of viral suppression. This observation was 
noted in the analysis of data from phase 1/2 portion of this study. In addition , the endpoint of death 
or mechanical ventilation from Day 1 through Day 29 will also be evaluated. The primary analysis 
will be performed for the High Viral Load mFAS, Seronegative mFAS, and the Overall mFAS in 
the pooled phase 3 cohort 1 and phase 2 coho rt 1A and combined across the 2.4 g and 8 g doses 
of REGN10933+REGN10987. To control alpha at a strict 0.[ADDRESS_114208].  
Safety Analysis  
The safety analysis will be performed for the following cohorts, separately. Patients in phase 1/2 
cohort 1, phase 2 cohort 2 and cohort 3 are included into the analysis because more safety data 
were collected for the patients after the database lock on 22 December 2020.  
• Phase 2 c ohort 1A  
• Phase 2 cohort 2  
• Phase 2 cohort 3  
• Phase 1/2/3 cohort 1 combined  
Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Immunogenicity  Analysis  
The PK and ADA analysis will be performed for phase 1/2/3 cohort 1 combined, phase 2 cohort 
1A, phase 2 cohort 2, and phase 2 cohort  3, separately. The NAb analysis will be performed for 
phase 2/3 patients.

11.2. Justification of Sample Size  
The initial sample size for this study was estimated separately for phase 1 and phase 2 (ie, prior to 
protocol amendment 6) and it was based on the original primary endpoint: virologic efficacy 
endpo int of time -weighted average change from baseline in viral load. The final estimates on 
sample size were based on assumptions related to the clinical endpoint of death or mechanical 
ventilation (see Section  11.2.3 ).  
11.2.1.  Phase 1 (Sentinel Safety Group; Cohort 1 only)  
The sample size for phase 1 is a total of 60 patients randomized in a 1:1:1 allocation ratio to 
REGN10933+REGN10987 combination therapy 2.4 g IV, REGN10933+REGN10987 
combination therapy 8.[ADDRESS_114209] 
30 patients randomized in the co mbined phase 1 portions of R10933 -[ZIP_CODE] -COV -2066 and 
R10933 -[ZIP_CODE] -COV -2067.  
Since one of the objectives of phase 1 is to assess safety and tolerability, the sample size will allow 
preliminary estimation of the incidences of SAE and AESIs in these investiga tional treatment arms 
relative to placebo.  
The primary efficacy endpoint in phase 1 is the virologic endpoint of time -weighted average 
change from baseline in viral load (log 10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL) in NP swab  samples from day 1 to day 22.

using a two -sample t -test at a 2 -sided significance of α=0.05. The smallest treatment difference is 
approximately 1.34 log 10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL.  
11.2.2.  Phase 2 (Cohort 1A, Cohort 1, Cohort 2*, and Cohort 3*)  
* Per IDMC recommendation first received on 30 October 2020, and reiterated through 19 
February 2021, patient enrollment in cohort 2 and cohort 3 has been placed on hold.  
The sample size of phase 2 cohort 1A was adjusted to approximate 1000 patients based on clinical 
judgement without statistical justification. However, this target was not reached because the 
enrollment was prematurely terminated due to slow enrollment rate.  
Phase 2 will evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2 doses of REGN10933+REGN10987 versus 
placebo within cohort 1A, cohort 1, cohort 2 and cohort 3, ie, phase 2 contains 3 treatment arms 
each across 4 cohorts. Randomization will be stratified according to Section  8.6. 
Initial Estimation of Phase 2 Sample Size  
The sample size for phase 2 was originally based on the primary virologic endpoint of 
time-weighted average change from baseline in viral load (log 10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL) from day [ADDRESS_114212] at a 2 -sided significance of α=0.05.  
Similar to phase 1, the standard deviation of actual viral load values at a timepoint from the 
literature was used for sample size calculation due to lack of co rresponding data from the literature. 
Assuming a ~23% dropout rate (including missing data at baseline) and a standard deviation of 
2.1 log 10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL (Cao, 2020 ), a sample size of 130 patients per arm (ie, 100 patients per arm 
with available data) across 3 treatment arms within each of the 4 cohorts, ie, 390 patients per coho rt 
(for a total of 1560 patients in the phase 2 portion of the study) will have 80% power to detect a 
difference of 0.84 log 10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL between each treatment arm and placebo in a cohort.  If a 
standard deviation of 3.8  log 10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL is assumed (Wang, 2020b ), the detectable difference at 
80% power would be 1.51 log 10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL.  
Phase 1/2 Estimation of Sample Size  
Per protocol amendment 6, statistical power calculations are provided for the cumulative incidence 
of death or mechanical ventilation for phase 1/2 cohort 1.  
For phase 1/2 analysis in cohort 1, assuming a total number of events (death or mechanical 
ventilation) will be 35, that the cumulative incidence of death or mechanical ven tilation in placebo 
is 25% at day 29 (placebo rate was 12.5% in Sponsor’s Kevzara® [sarilumab] study 6R88 -COV -
2040 in COVID -19 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103179]; further assume placebo rate i s twice this in seronegative mFAS), and 
using a futility threshold of α=0.3 (1 -sided), the minimum hazard ratio (HR) between 
REGN10933+REGN10987 dose group versus placebo that excludes futility is 0.827 (ie, minimum 
risk reduction 17.3%). If the observed r isk reduction is approximately 17% or lower, the 
assessment of efficacy in cohort 1 as currently designed will be declared futile.

CONFIDENTIAL  The alpha level for futility in this study is consistent with that used in the ACTIV -3 protocol for a 
similar cohort of patie nts with COVID -19 (NIAID, 2020 ). 
For phase 1/2 key secondary analyses in cohort 1, and using assumptions about event rates as 
described above , about 43 total events in the seronegative mFAS will be needed to achieve 80% 
power to detect a risk reduction of 50% (HR=0.5) between any REGN -COV2 dose group versus 
placebo, at α=0.1 (one -sided) level of significance. Assuming patients are f ollowed through day 
29, and accrual takes 90 days, and assuming that 30% of FAS (randomized and treated) patients 
are in the seronegative mFAS, a total of approximately 250 randomized and treated patients across 
3 arms will be needed in phase 1/2 in the th ree treatment groups.

11.2.3.  Phase 3 (Cohort 1)  
Initial estimation  
The sample size for phase 3 was initially estimated to be 1350 patients (150 patients per arm across 
3 treatment arms in 3 cohorts). Based on the new endpoint of death or mechanical ventilation, the 
sample size for phase 3 ha s been re -estimated to be 2505 patients in each of cohort 1 and cohort 
1A.  
The study was planned to continue enrolling additional patients seamlessly into the phase 3 portion 
of the study, until an adaptation decision on the dose(s), primary endpoint and final sample size 
for phase 3 is made based on the phase 2 data analysis. A total sample size of approximately 5010 
patients was estimated for the phase 3 portion of the study (2505 per cohort, 835 per arm across 3 
treatment arms in 2  cohorts). For cohort 1, a total of 241 events (estimated sample size of 2505 
patients [835 patients per arm]) would have been needed to provide 90% power at α=0.05 (2 -sided) 
using a log -rank test to detect a risk reduction of 35.8% (ie, HR=0.642) in the cumulative incidence 
of patients who died or went on mechanical ventilation, assuming a 12.5% cumulative incidence 
rate in the placebo group by [CONTACT_4475] 29.  
Final sample size  
Finalization of the sample size and patient population for phase [ADDRESS_114213] to 
change and w ould be determined after review of phase 2 data. However, enrollment of patients 
into the study was terminated prematurely by [CONTACT_17190] 09 April 2021 because of extremely 
slow enrollment in the months preceding the decision. The sample size of phase 3  was not re -
estimated.

CONFIDENTIAL  Approximately 2252 patients were randomized in the study, which includes 60 patients in phase 1 
cohort 1, 629 in phase 2 cohort 1, 755 in planned phase 3 cohort 1, 609 in phase 2 cohort 1A, 164 
in phase 2 cohort 2 and 35 in phase 2 cohort 3.  
Assuming the proportion of patients who died or went on mechanical ventilation from day 1 to 
day 29 in placebo group is 13.1% which is same as the blinded proportion in the Seronegative 
mFAS patients of the pooled phase 3 cohort 1 and phase 2 co hort 1A and alpha is 0.05 2 -sided, 
the minimal significant difference in relative risk reduction between the  
REGN10933+REGN10987 2.4g and 8.0g combined dose group and placebo group is 29.0%, 
41.2%, and 36.6% for overall mFAS, Seronegative mFAS, and High Vi ral Load mFAS patients, 
respectively.  
11.3. Analysis Sets  
11.3.1.  Efficacy Analysis Sets  
Full Analysis Set (FAS):  The full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomized patients who 
received at least one dose (full or partial) of the study drug. Analysis of the FAS popul ation will 
be done according to the treatment allocated (as randomized).  
Modified Full Analysis Set (mFAS):  The modified full analysis set (mFAS) includes all FAS 
patients with a positive SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR conducted in the central laboratory in NP  swab 
samples at randomization and analysis is based on the treatment allocated (as randomized).  
Seronegative mFAS:  The seronegative mFAS is defined as all patients in mFAS with documented 
seronegative status at the baseline.  
High Viral Load mFAS:  The High Viral Load mFAS is defined as all patients in mFAS with 
baseline viral load >106 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL.  
Both FAS and mFA S will be used for the summaries of demographic and baseline characteristics 
and analysis of clinical/biomarker endpoints. The mFAS will be used for the analysis of all efficacy 
endpoints, based on the principle that an anti -viral agent would only be antic ipated to provide 
efficacy in patients with measurable virus at baseline. The seronegative mFAS as well as the high 
viral load mFAS will be used for the primary analysis and descriptive analysis of certain virologic 
endpoints and clinical endpoints. Additi onal analyses will be performed in the seropositive mFAS, 
as needed.  
11.3.2.  Safety Analysis Set  
The safety analysis set (SAF) includes all randomized patients who received a dose (full or partial) 
of the study drug. Analysis of the SAF will be done according to t he treatment received (as treated). 
Determination of “as treated” will be based on the actual study drug received on day  1. Since the 
treatment of “as treated” is same as “as randomized” in this study, the FAS is equivalent to the 
SAF. Therefore, the treat ment administration and all clinical safety variables will be analyzed 
using the FAS.   
11.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics Analysis Sets  
The pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis population includes all patients who received any study drug 
of REGN10933 and REGN10987 and who had at least 1 non -missing drug concentration 
                                        VV-RIM-00163777-1.0 Approved - 27 Aug 2021 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_114214] dose of study drug as indicated in the Schedule of Events table. 
Patients will be analyzed based on actual treatment received.  
11.3.4.  Immunogenicity Analysis Sets  
The ADA analysis set (AAS) in cludes all subjects who received any study drug (active or placebo) 
and at least one non -missing ADA result from the ADA assay after a first dose of the study drug 
or placebo.  
The NAb analysis set (NAS) includes all treated subjects who received any study drug (active or 
placebo), have at least one non -missing ADA  result following the first dose of study drug (active 
or placebo), and either tested negative at all ADA sampling times or tested positive for ADA with 
at least one non -missing NAb result after fi rst dose of the study drug (active or placebo). Subjects 
who are ADA negative are set to negative in the NAb analysis set.  
Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received.  
11.4. Statistical Methods  
For continuous variables, descriptive st atistics will include the following: the number of patients 
reflected in the calculation (n), mean, Q1, median, Q3, standard deviation (SD), minimum, and 
maximum.  
For categorical or ordinal data, frequencies and percentages will be displayed for each categ ory. 
11.4.1.  Demography and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], and 
all groups combined. These will be analyzed for FAS and mFAS populations. Similar analysis will 
be performed by [CONTACT_103252] (≤ 106 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL and >106 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL) for mFAS population.  
11.4.2.  Medical History  
Medical history will be summarized by [CONTACT_103253].  
11.4.3.  Prior / Concomitant Medications or Procedures  
Prior or concomitant medications/procedures will be summarized by [CONTACT_6660]. Summaries 
will present patient counts (and percentages) for all medications, dictionary coded by 
[CONTACT_103254], by [CONTACT_103255] (or high dose group 
incidence in tables where the overall is not presented) of ATC followed by [CONTACT_103256] 2, ATC 
level [ADDRESS_114215] of targeted medications in the FAS and 
mFAS populations.   
Number and proportion of patients undergoing a prior/concomitant procedure(s) will be 
summarized, sorted by [CONTACT_103257] (or high dose group incidence in tables where the overall  is not presented). Patients 
will be counted only once for each SOC and PT linked to the procedure.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Analysis of Primary Virologic Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary analysis on the comparison between the REGN10933+REGN10987 2.4g and 8.0g 
combined dose group and placebo with respec t to the virologic endpoint of time -weighted average 
daily change from baseline in viral load (log 10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL) from day [ADDRESS_114216] -
baseline visit timepoint will be performed in the Seronegative mFAS in the pooled phase 3 cohort 
1 and phase 2 cohort 1A patients . The estimand for the analysis is the difference in means between 
the REGN10933+REGN10987 2.4g and 8.0g combined dose group and placebo in the pooled 
phase 3 cohort 1 and phase 2 cohort 1A patients . Data collected after use of convales cent plasma 
therapy or other anti -spi[INVESTIGATOR_103134]. All other 
available data will be used in the analysis regardless of intercurrent events such as rescue 
medication or discontinuation, ie, treatment policy approach .  
The analysis will be based on the observed data with no imputation for missing data except as 
defined in the SAP for viral load values that are below lower limit of detection (<LLOD), below 
lower limit of quantification (<LLOQ) or above upper limit of q uantification (>ULOQ) of the 
assay.  
The variable will be analyzed using the Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment 
group and the type of background standard -of-care as fixed effects, and baseline viral load and 
treatment by [CONTACT_103258].  
The least squares means estimates for time -weighted average daily change from baseline in viral 
load for each treatment group, as well as the difference between the REGN10933+REGN10987 
2.4g and 8.0g combined doses and placebo as well as  between each individual dose treatment 
group and placebo, will be provided along with the corresponding two -sided p -value, standard 
error, and associated 95% confidence interval.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Analysis of Primary Clinical Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary efficacy analys is will be the comparison between the REGN10933+REGN10987 2.4g 
and 8.0g combined dose group and placebo in the pooled phase [ADDRESS_114217] method for binomial distribution  or asymptotic normal approximation method. If 
the number of events is small (eg, np ≤ 5 or n(1 -p) ≤ 5 in any treatment group, where n is the 
number of patients in the treatment group and p is the proportion of events), then the Fisher’s exact 
test will be  applied. Otherwise, stratified Cochran -Mantel Haenszel (CMH) test, stratified by [CONTACT_103259] -of-care (antiviral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_88798] -antiviral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]), will be 
applied. Relative risk and relative risk reduction and corresponding 95% co nfidence intervals 
compared to placebo group will be estimated by [CONTACT_103209] -Manning method. Missing data will 
be considered as non -events.  
The analysis will be performed for the High Viral Load mFAS, the Seronegative mFAS, and the 
overall mFAS.

• Treatment -emergent response, defined as an ADA positive response in the ADA assay 
post first dose when baseline results are negative or missing. The treatment -emergent 
responses will be further characterized as Persistent, Indeterminate or Transient.  
− Persistent Response (only applicable to phase 1) – Treatment -emergent ADA 
positive response with two or more consecutive ADA positive sampling time 
points, separate d by [CONTACT_2669] 16 -week period (based on nominal sampling time), with 
no ADA negative samples in between, regardless of any missing samples .

of Helsinki, and that are consistent with the ICH guidelines for GCP and applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
13.2. Informed Consent  
The principles of informed consent are described in ICH guidelines for GCP.  
An informed consent form (ICF) can be defined as either a paper consent form or an electronically -
delivered consent (eConsent). An eConsent may be provided only where allowable by [CONTACT_103276].  
Due to disease severity, quarantine restrictions and/or other reasons related to COVID -19, it may 
be necessary to implement temporary or alternative measures to obtain informed consent per 
procedures outlined in the investigator site file.  
The ICF used by  [CONTACT_103277]/EC. A copy of the IRB/EC -approved ICF and documentation 
of approval must be provided to the Sponsor before study drug will be shipped to the study sit e. 
It is the responsibility of the investigator or designee (if acceptable by [CONTACT_427]) to obtain 
informed consent from each patient prior to his/her participation in the study and after the aims, 
methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the study have been explained to the patient in

• Patients who can write but cannot read  will have the ICF read to them before signing 
and dating the ICF.  
• Patients who can understand but who can neither write nor read will have the ICF read 
to them in presence of an impartial witness, who will sign and date the ICF to confirm 
that informed co nsent was given.  
The original ICF must be retained by [CONTACT_31616]’s study record, and a 
copy of the signed ICF must be given to the patient.  
If new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/benefit assessment , or if there 
are significant changes to the study procedures, the ICF must be reviewed and updated 
appropriately. All study patients must be informed of the new information and provide their written 
consent if they wish to continue in the study. The origi nal signed revised ICF must be maintained 
in the patient’s study record and a copy must be given to the patient.  
13.3. Patients Confidentiality and Data Protection  
The investigator must take all appropriate measures to ensure that the anonymity of each study 
patient will be maintained. Patients should be identified by a patient identification number only, 
on eCRFs or other documents submitted to the Sponsor. Documents that will not be submitted to 
the Sponsor (eg, signed ICF) must be kept in strict confidence.  
The patient’s and investigator's personal data, which may be included in the Sponsor database, will 
be treated in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The Sponsor shall take all 
appropriate measures to safeguard and prevent access to this dat a by [CONTACT_13159].  
13.4. Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee

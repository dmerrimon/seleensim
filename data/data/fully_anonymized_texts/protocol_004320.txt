INTRODUCTION  
 
Cognitive impairment is common in and devastating to people with MS. MS is a common, chronic, central 
nervous system ( CNS ) disease characterized by [CONTACT_2898], demyelination, and neurodegeneration.  One of 
the most devastating symptoms of this disease is impaired cognitive function, which is common and present in 
over 60% of individuals with MS.1-[ADDRESS_583880] 
neurons from various insults including oxidative stress, ischemia, and glutamat e-related excitotoxicity.25 
Moreover, insulin’s anti -inflammatory effects, as detailed below, 
may also impact brain health via suppressing concentrations of 
chemokines, cytokines, and other molecules that may provoke 
ongoing CNS inflammation and damage in disease states.   
 
Insulin has biologically relevant anti -inflammatory and 
neuroprotective CNS effects. At the cellular level, insulin 
regulates various neuronal functions including receptor 
expression, trafficking, and survival pathway activation . 
Insulin  signaling in neurons exert s a neuroprotective effect, 
especially under oxidative stress, via the phosphoinositide -3 
kinase (PI3K/AKT) pathway (Figure 1) which, downstream, 
induces the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). 
CREB regulates the expres sion of several genes that are crucial 
for learning and memory, i ncluding brain derived neurotrophic 
factor (BDNF) ,[ADDRESS_583881] has been see n in models of Alzheimer’s, 
Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s Diseases.[ADDRESS_583882] s on peripheral blood

 mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by [CONTACT_457132] (e.g. monocyte chemoattractant protein -1, 
chemokine receptor -5) that could ultimately help minimize ongoing nervous system injury.25  
 
Insulin’s ability to regulate energy metabolism could also result in a protective effect on neurons via 
impacting oxidative stress and excessive energy demands. Insulin appe ars to directly mediate brain glucose 
metabolism maximally within the cortex, and with any disturbance in the communication between insulin and 
neuronal glucose metabolism, there may be impaired adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis followed by 
[CONTACT_457133] a poptosis.31, 32 Moreover, the oxidative stress that results from excessive energy demand leads not only 
to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but also to ceramide production. These signaling pathways 
are connected and may be altered upstream by [CONTACT_134755]’s impact on brain glucose metabolism. For example, 
several apoptosis -inducing treatments both activate the sphingomyelin (SM) -ceramide pathway and generate 
oxidative stress.33 Inflammatory cytokines relevant to MS (e.g. tumor necrosis factor [TN F]-α) can also induce 
ceramide formation and ROS. Chemical scavengers prevent elevations in ROS and also SM -ceramide pathway 
activation. Finally, the use of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate or N -acetyl cysteine, both antioxidants, restricts 
ceramide formation a nd cell death due to TNF -α in rat astrocytes or human breast carcinoma cells.  
 
The impact of insulin in the nervous system, especially as it relates to cognitive health, deserves more attention, 
as it may be a treatment for disease that cause CNS dysfunction from several pathologies, including MS.  
 
Insulin administration has been sh own to improve memory and learning in healthy people and in those 
with neurodegenerative diseases  (see Table 1). Intranasal insulin has shown to have neuroprotective and 
restorative effects in several human clinical trials. In a recent randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled 
study with over 100 people suffering from amnestic mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s Disease, 
intranasal insulin preserved cognitive function in both selective cognitive domains and more globally compared 
to placebo.34 The i nsulin -treated patients also did not show a decline in measures of brain metabolism, whereas 
the placebo -treated participants did show decreases in fluorodeoxyglucose 18F uptake in various lobes 
(parietotemporal, frontal, precuneus, and cuneus). Further, i mprovements in epi[INVESTIGATOR_457124]. Overall, these findings suggest that intranasal insulin not only affects 
cognitive function acutely, but that over time, there may be associated structural changes that l ead to a more 
permanent treatment benefit. Since cognitive dysfunction is very common in MS and can be devastating, a 
treatment intervention (i.e., intranasal insulin) that can help both acutely and longitudinally is worth pursuing.

Intranasal insulin is extremely safe and tolerable in other populations, allowing for concentrated delivery 
to the nervous system.  Intranasal insulin has a long -standing safety track record that spans more than a decade. 
No significant adverse events were reported in the largest intranasal insulin study to date or in any other study 
that has used intran asal insulin (see Table 1). An intranasal  delivery system provides a non -invasive way to 
by[CONTACT_457134] -brain barrier and allow rapid delivery of a medication to the CNS via the olfactory and 
trigeminal perivascular channels.34 The main advantage of the  delivery system is reducing systemic side effects 
via limiting a medication’s exposure to peripheral organs and tissues. In addition, first -pass metabolism is 
avoided. Intranasal insulin, as seen in previous human studies, does not adversely affect systemi c (blood) 
glucose or insulin, and it increases CSF insulin to biologically protective concentrations within [ADDRESS_583884] effects of insulin on energy metabolism, oxidative 
stress, and modulation of inflammatory and neu ronal pathways, along with the data from clinical trials 
in people with other neurodegenerative disorders, prove the rationale for investigating it in people with 
MS who suffer with cognitive impairment.  As noted above, reduced levels of insulin and/or ins ulin activity 
may contribute to a number of pathological processes that may ultimately lead to long -term disability in 
neurodegenerative diseases. Restoring brain insulin to normal levels and increasing insulin sensitivity in the 
brain may provide therapeu tic benefit to people with MS. Herein, we thus propose the first clinical trial in MS 
to determine the safety and tolerability as well as the effectiveness of intranasal insulin as a therapeutic 
intervention for cognitive dysfunction. Our study will invest igate associated changes in putative biomarkers (see 
Preliminary Data  below) that may corroborate clinical outcomes and provide data regarding the mechanisms by 
[CONTACT_457135]. These measures, along with neuropsychological testing, will be incorporated  with safety data 
in order to accurately assess the potential utility of intranasal insulin for MS cognitive impairment.  
 
OBJECTIVES/AIMS  
 
Primary Objective: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of intranasal insulin in people with MS  
 
Secondary Objectives : The main secondary objective is to evaluate if intranasal insulin improves cognition in 
people with MS , as assessed by [CONTACT_83049] . Additional secondary  objectives are to determine if intranasal 
insulin is associated with changes in a dditional components of the Minimal Assessment of Cognitive Function 
in MS (MACFIMS) , the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) score , health -related quality of life

 (Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis [FAMS]) , the E xpanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score , 
and c hanges in biomarkers of oxidative stress, neuronal injury, cellular stress, and metabolism.  
 
Aim 1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of intranasal insulin in people with MS.  
Hypothesis:  Intranasal insulin has been shown to be safe in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_457125]’s Disease, but its safety and tolerability in MS patients are unknown. We 
hypothesize that intranasal insulin will be safe and tolerable for people with MS.  
 
Aim 2. To evaluate if intranasal insulin improves cognition in people with MS.  
Hypothesis:  Intranasal insulin has been shown to improve multiple aspects of cogniti on in several randomized, 
blinded clinical trials of healthy p eople and in those with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s Disease. 
We hypothesize that intranasal insulin will improve cognition in MS patients who are cognitively impaired.  
 
Aim 3. To evaluate the impact of intranasal insulin on measures of oxidat ive stress, axonal injury, 
cellular stress, and energy metabolism in MS.  
Hypothesis:  Although there is not a single biomarker for MS, there are some surrogate measures of interest that 
may well be impacted by [CONTACT_457136]. We will perform an expl oratory analysis to evaluate the effect 
that intranasal insulin has on these measures, with the hypothesis that intranasal insulin will improve markers of 
oxidative and cellular stress, neuronal injury, metabolism, and inflammation in people with MS.

Recruitment:  Eligible subjects with MS will be recruited from the Johns Hopkins MS Center, at which over 
3,000 MS patients, who come from diverse racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds and from a wide 
catchment area, are seen annually. We will also screen potenti ally eligible subjects using an IRB -approved 
Telephone Screening Script. This will allow us to screen patients who may or may not meet the study’s 
eligibility criteria. If a patient meets the eligibility criteria via telephone screening, we will schedule t he patient 
to come in for a baseline visit. The study coordinator will call  only patients of physicians on the study team . 
Patients interested in participating will be emailed or mailed the written consent form to review in advance.  
 
Since we began  routin ely administ ering the iPAD -based correlate of the SDMT , the Processing Speed Test 
(PST)  for all MS Center patients since early [ADDRESS_583891] SDMT data and thus will also be easily screened

 for eligibility, even if they haven’t had a recent clinic visit.  For MS Center patients that have not take n an 
SDMT  or PST  test, we will use an oral consent process  to administer the SDMT test  and determine eligibility . 
SDMT or PST test results obtained within [ADDRESS_583892] 
iPADs (Air, Air 2, and iPAD 2017), as the PST app is now available. This will allow for remotely screening 
potential subjects that have transportation and/or mobility limitations.   If at any time point, enrollment is less 
than 85% of the target, we will interview subjects who have declined to participate to determine the deterrents 
to enrollment; we will then implement alterations in recruitment ne eded  to enhance enrollment.  
 
 
Study  Treatment : Intranasal insulin (Novolin R, Novo Nordisk, Princeton, NJ) will be evaluated in two doses 
(10 IU twice a day, 20 IU twice a day) and compared to the sterile diluent  (Eli Lilly and Company  – 
NDC: [ZIP_CODE] -0800 ) (1:1:1 randomization, stratified by [CONTACT_457137]). The [ADDRESS_583893]  smell. In order to pres erve study blinding, we will use the  Lilly sterile diluent , which 
has a similar odor as the insulin , to preserve blinding . The study drug  and placebo (Lilly diluent)  will be 
prepared by [CONTACT_457138]. A 
nasal drug delivery device ( Kurve Technology , Lynnwood , WA)  will be utilized to ensure optimal exposure of 
the olfactory epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]. The treatment regimen was chosen to match that of a recent successful pi[INVESTIGATOR_457128]’s Disease.34 Evaluating two doses will al low for the possibility that any  benefit of in sulin may be 
non-linear.  
 
Treatment Preparation : The study pharmacist will transfer either insulin; sterile diluent (placebo); or normal 
saline into 10cc empty syringes to preserve study blinding . The syringes will be labeled syringe A or syringe B, 
respectively.  At the baseline visit, subjects and/or caregivers  will be instructed on how to fill the cartridge s by 
[CONTACT_457139] A and  one B syringe to the cartridge; gently mix the contents and be shown how to administer the 
doses using the ViaNase device.  Due to the 28 -day shelf life of the insulin /diluent , the subjects need to know 
how to refill their own study products prior to their next study visit.  
 
Methods to Maximize Adherence:  Given data from prior studies, i t is anticipated that adverse events will not 
reduce adherence . The study coordinator will help each participant set reminder alarms on watches or phones; 
those  who do not have access to such devices will be given a medication alarm watch for use during th e study. 
Study staff will also identify a patient advocate and to educate that person to help the study participant maintain 
adherence. To maximize visit adherence, patients will receive a reminder in the week prior to the appointment.   
 
Accountability of  Medication :  A sufficient amount of medication will be supplied at the baselineand week [ADDRESS_583894] until the next study visit , otherwise, refills will be mailed to the participants . 
Participants will be asked to return unused  medication at each study visit  for adherence assessment . The Johns 
Hopkins Investigational Drug Unit will maintain adequate records of the disposition of the study drug and 
accounts of any destroyed study drug.   
 
Study Personnel : All personnel (except the statistician) will be blinded to treatment assignment. The treating 
physician  will assess eligibility criteria, obtain informed consent, obtain and maintain the medical history and 
medication record, monitor  patients’ safety, cond uct the physical examination, and evaluat e and report  adverse 
events. The examining physician  will perform the blinded EDSS. The blinded study neuropsychologist  will 
administer the MACFIMS to participants.  The blinded study coordinator  will be responsible for the study’s 
administrative duties, obtaining vital signs, conducting the MSFC and administering the depression, suicidality, 
and health -related quality of life measures, and drawing and processing blood samples as well as urine

Risks  
 
Intranasal insulin  
Intranasal insulin has been shown to be safe and tolerable in other populations and patient groups, but it has 
never been studied in people with MS. The most common side effects related to irritation of the nasal passages. 
Giving insulin through the nose d id not result in lower circulating glucose levels in other studies, but the first 15

Application #: IRB00095554  
[ADDRESS_583900] dose of intranasal insulin  (see Safety  section under Outcomes  on page 
10). 
 
Insulin, given by [CONTACT_457140], has the following potential risks:  
Hypoglycemia:  Common symptoms of hypoglycemia include sweating, dizziness or lightheadedness, 
shakiness, hunger, a fast heartbeat, tingling of the hands, feet, lips or tongue, trouble concentrating, 
confusion, blurry vision, slurred speech, anxiety, irritability, or moo d changes, or headache. Very low 
blood sugar can cause loss of consciousness , seizures, or temporary or permanent brain problems or 
death.  Mild  hypoglycemia can be treated by [CONTACT_296585] (fruit juice, 
sugar candies, or g lucose tablets).  
 
 Hypokalemia: Hypokalemia can lead to breathing problems, low heartbeat, or death.  
 
 Allergic reaction: Common symptoms of an allergic reaction include a rash all over the body, trouble 
breathing, a fast heartbeat, sweating, and feeling faint.  
 
 Weight gain or swelling of the arms and legs.  
 
While these are all risks potentially associated with subcutaneous administration of insulin, none of these risks 
has been demonstrated to be the case in the published trials of intranasal insulin. Th us, by [CONTACT_457141], it is anticipated that these risks will be minimized . 
 
Blood Draw  
Taking blood may cause discomfort, bleeding or bruising where the needle enters the body. In rare cases, it may 
result in fainting. There is a small risk of infection. To minimize the risks, blood will be drawn by a trained 
study team member /phlebotomist.  
 
Confidentiality  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_457129], there may still be a risk if information about participants were to 
become known to people outside of this study.  
 
Questionnaires  
Participants  may get tired or bored when we are asking ques tions or they are completing questionnaires. They 
do not have to answer any question they do not want to answer.  
  
DXA scan  
DXA testing is painless and involves exposure to radiation. This research study includes exposure to radiation 
from x -rays or gamma rays. This radiation exposure is for research purposes only and is not part of the 
participant’s  medical care. X -rays and ga mma rays can damage cells, but at low doses, the body is usual ly able 
to repair these cells.  
 
The radiation exposure that participants will get in t his research study is 0.001 rem . This is less than the 0.3 rem 
that the average person in the [LOCATION_002]  gets each year from natural sources like the sun, outer space, air, 
food, and soil. The risk from the radiation exposure in this research study is very small. The radiation exposure 
described here is what participants  will get from this research study onl y. It does not include any exposure

There is no known benefit of intranasal insulin, and thus there is no known risk of being in the placebo group. 
All patients who are already on a medication for MS will be allowed to continue that medication during the 
study.  
Payment and Remuneration  
Parti cipants will receive a parking coupon at each visit.    
 
Costs  
There are no costs to participants for taking part  in this study.  
 
 
Outcomes:  
 
Safety  Since this medication was extremely well -tolerated in several published studies ,34-[ADDRESS_583902] ( DSMB ) meeting to adjust the protocol. We will 
also record and, when appropriate, repo rt all patient -reported adverse events, as described below. Subjects and 
their caregivers will be required to keep a n electronic diary of adverse events, which will be reviewed at each 
study visit. As mandated by [CONTACT_1622], the Columbia Suicide Severity Rati ng Scale will be administered at each 
study visit.  
 
Cognitive Assessments   The MACFIMS battery includes the following:  The Symbol Digit Modalities Test  
(SDMT ) is commonly used in MS to assess processing speed.1, [ADDRESS_583903] (COWAT)  
measures phonemic fluency.[ADDRESS_583904], Second Edition (CVLT -II) is a verbal 
learning and memory test.55, [ADDRESS_583905] – Revised (BVMT -R) is a visual, nonverbal 
test of learning and memory.[ADDRESS_583906] (PASA T) evaluates  
processing speed, working memory, and basic addition skills.[ADDRESS_583907] (JLO) .58, 61 The Delis -Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS) tests 
executive functioning, conce pt formation, and cognitive flexibility.  
 
 
  
Exploratory Biomarkers  Plasma and /or PBMCs will be collected at baseline, week 12, and week 24 visits  
(except if COVID -19 related shutdown  does not permit follow -up blood collection or lab -based processing ) and 
will be isolated and cryopreserved for batch analyses in the labs of [CONTACT_457144] or Calabresi. Inflammatory 
(cytokines , lymphocyte subsets), metabolic (Kreb’s cycle substrate , fatty acids), cellular stress (ceramides , 
sphingomyelin) and neurotrophic ( BDNF) measures, as well as markers of oxidative stress (protein carbonyls, 
8-isoprostane, nitrotyrosine, and 4 -hydroxynonenal adducts [lysine and histidine]), will be quantified. Since our 
data show oxidative stress biomarkers and elevated ceramides in pla sma of MS patients  and recent work shows

[ADDRESS_583908] for comorbid 
depression, the Beck Depression Inventory will be administered at each study visit. Health -related quality of life 
will also be assessed utilizing the FAMS.  We will also evaluate how overall sleep q uality in people with MS 
impacts health -related quality of life. We will also evaluate for occult insulin resistance or differences in 
metabolism in several ways. We will  evaluate dual -energy x -ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline, which will 
help determin e body composition , in particular  bone density . We will also calculate an insulin resistance index, 
the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA -IR),63 using baseline fasting glucose and insulin. Statistical models 
exploring these body composition and insulin re sistance parameters as potential confounders or mediators will 
be evaluated.  Finally, the MACFIMS, safety, depression, and health -related quality of life outcomes will be 
monitored after discontinuation of the insulin (or placebo) to evaluate for any decli ne in cognitive function 
associated with medication discontinuation.  
 
Safety/Adverse Event Monitoring   An adverse event (AE) is any occurrence or worsening of an undesirable or 
unintended sign, symptom (or abnormal laboratory test), or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product or intervention, whether or not it is considered related to the product/interve ntion. We will 
use the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.[ADDRESS_583909] all study adverse events in the chart and will treat participants 
with AEs appropriately, observing them until they resolve or stabilize. AEs will be collected from the start of 
the study until a participant terminates from the study; those that are unresolved at the time of termination will 
be followed until they resolve or up to [ADDRESS_583910] information (e.g. protocol or the informed consent form). Serious 
AEs will be collected from informed consent signing until 30 days after study completion or until 30 days after 
a participa nt withdraws from the study. The following process for reporting a serious AE will ensure 
compliance with the International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines: t he Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) and DSMB will be notified in two business days of a ser ious AE that is medication -related and 
unexpected, and s tandard reporting (15 calendar days) will occur if the event is serious, expected and 
medication -related, serious, expected and not medication -related, or serious, unexpected and not medication -
relate d. Life-threatening events will be reported within [ADDRESS_583911] cannot tolerate the medication / wants to discontinue it. Any 
death that is at least possibly related to the study will put the study on hold  until the DSMB evaluates it .  
 
DSMB : The DSMB consists of an independent neurologist, an endocrinologist, and a statistician . It will 
convene any time an adverse event ≥ grade 3 occurs and routinely  at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% enrollment.  
All serious adverse events will be promptly and simultaneously reported to the IRB , the DSMB  and the 
Independent Research Monitor.  Only serious adverse events (S AEs) that would also meet the definition of an 
Unanticipated Problem Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_16104]) that are related to the protocol will 
be promptly reported  to the  [LOCATION_002] Army Medical Research and Materiel Command Office of Resea rch 
Protections Human Research Protection Office  HRPO  ([LOCATION_003]MRC ORP HRPO) . 
 
Independent Research Monitor: The PI , [CONTACT_47819] , has appointed [CONTACT_457145] , a trained neurologist, as 
the Independent Research Monitor.  [CONTACT_457146]  will provide independent safety review and will have the

14 
 authority to stop the research study; remove an individual subject from the research study; and will take any 
steps to protect the safety and well -being of the subjects until the IRB can assess the problem or event. The 
independent research monitor must review all unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others 
(UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845]), but not all SAEs.  The monitor will review the  SAEs if they also meet the definition of a 
UPI[INVESTIGATOR_457130].  The Research Monitor will comment on the 
outcomes of the event or problem and the relationship to participation in the study. Additionally, t he research 
monitor will indicate whether she concurs with the details of the report provided by [CONTACT_458].  
 
 
Analytic Plan  
 
Aim 1.  Safety data will be analyzed as they are captured in real time. Assessments will focus on AEs (including 
study treatment tolerability assessments, labor atory evaluations, vital signs, and physical examination). The 
incidence rate of AEs will be recorded by [CONTACT_9313], severity, and by [CONTACT_457142]. Tolerability analysis will be based on the number (%) of subjects who failed to complete the study 
due to adverse events. Lab values for each parameter will be summarized by [CONTACT_265558]. For quantitative 
parameters, summary statistics for actual values and change from baseline will be presented.  Changes in the 
first [ADDRESS_583912] -specific intercepts and slopes.  
 
Aim 2.  Summary statistics (mean ± standard deviation, median and interquartile range, or number and 
percentages) will be used to characterize the outcomes. For each cognitive outcome, to evaluate variability in 
the estimated means across groups, assuming that the  within -group means are normally distributed, a one -way 
ANOVA will be conducted at the follow -up visits during the first [ADDRESS_583913] at follow -
up visits. For within -person changes in measures at follow -up compared to baseline or before versus after 
calori e restriction days, paired t -tests will be used. Correlations between the biomarkers will be assessed. A 
bootstrap of subjects will be used to obtain 95% equal confidence intervals for these measures. We will also 
evaluate the biomarker changes after study  therapy ends. 
 
Sample Size and Power : Sample size estimates are difficult given the novelty of the project but are based on 
the goal of detecting a benefit of insulin on cognition. In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_457131]’s Disease, the 
Dementia Severity Rating Scale score improved over the four -month treatment course in those receiving 
intranasal insulin.34 Using the scores in the 10 IU twice a day gro up, given a two -sided alpha of 0.05 and beta 
0.20 (80% power), assuming 3 follow -up cognitive tests and a correlation between baseline and follow -up 
results of 0.5, 29 subjects per group are required. To account for drop -outs and for the three -arm design, a total 
of 35 subjects per group is planned . With SDMT as the outco me, for a two -arm design, this sample size confers  
80% power (assuming SDMT standard deviation of 9 points and two -sided alpha of 0.05) to detect a 6 -point  
improvement in SDMT which seems reasonable considering that transcranial stimulation with cognitive training

[ADDRESS_583914] deviation of the distribution in change in cognitive  tests that 
will inform the design of definitive, phase III trials. Aim 3  is exp loratory, but given the relative abundance 
differences in MS versus controls in our preliminary data in C22:1, and assuming a similar absolute C22:1 
concentration as in women aged 55 -64 years,65 with 35 subjects in a two -arm study of 35 subjects/arm and a 2-
sided alpha of 0.05, we w ill have 80% power to detect a 10 ng/mL difference in ceramide levels.

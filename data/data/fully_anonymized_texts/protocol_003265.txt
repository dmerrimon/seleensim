Study Title  A 12 -Week, Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Study 
with a 4 -Week Randomized Withdrawal Period to Evaluate the 
Efficacy and Safety of Tenapanor for the Treatment of Constipation -
Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS -C) 
Sponsor  Ardelyx, Inc.  
Study Phase  3 
Treatment 
Groups  2 treatment groups; ~[ADDRESS_374634] s total; ~300/group with a ratio of 
1:1 Tenapanor :placebo   
No. of Sites  100-120 
Dose Form and 
Frequency  Tablet(s), placebo matched  
Twice daily (BID)  
Doses  Placebo, and tenapanor  50 mg BID (total daily doses; placebo, and 
100 mg)  
Methodology  This is a 12 -week, multi -center, randomized, double -blind, placebo 
controlled study with a 4 -week randomized withdrawal (RW) period 
to evaluate tenapanor 50 mg BID  in subjects  with IBS -C (Rome III 
criteria) . A 2:[ADDRESS_374635] for a total of 18 weeks; 
including 16 weeks of treatment, preceded by a 2 week screening 
period.  
2-Week 
Screening Period  At the beginning of the 2 -week screening period (Day  -14), the 
following will be performed:  
Subjects will provide written consent and be fully assessed for 
eligibility into the study.  The assessments will include: 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, medical histories (including details about 
co-morbid disorders), physical exam, vital signs, ECG, and c linical 
laboratory tests.  During the [ADDRESS_374636] returning fo r 
Visit 2 (randomization), a member of the site staff will confirm a 
subject’s eligibility with regard to the information they have reported 
in their electronic diary during screening.  If the information captured 
in the diary deems them eligible, and they continue to meet the 
inclusion criteria, which includes meet ing the Rome III criteria for 
IBS with constipation, the subject will be randomized into a 
treatment group.

Statistical 
Considerations  Summary tabulations will be presented that will display 
descriptive statistics for each treatment group. For subject 
disposition, demographic and baseline characteristics, medical 
history, gastrointestinal disease history, and prior medications, an 
overall  column (i.e., all subjects combined) will be included. For 
continuous variables, descriptive statistics will include the number 
of subjects, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and 
maximum values. For categorical variables, descriptive statistics 
will include the number and percent of subjects in each category.  
 
All subjects who meet the study entry inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
receive at least one dose of study drug, and have at least one valid 
week of efficacy assessment data (minimum of 4 days)  will be 
included in the ITT analysis set. Subjects will be analyzed 
according to the treatment group into which they were 
randomized. The ITT analysis set will be the primary analysis set 
for efficacy analysis.  
 
Responder rate efficacy variables will be a nalyzed using a 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test with pooled investigator 
site as a stratification (adjustment) variable. Summary statistics 
will include the pairwise risk difference with placebo along with 
the asymptotic 95% confidence interval (CI). Th e adjusted relative 
risk (adjusted for pooled investigator site) will be based on the 
ratio of responder rates for placebo versus tenapanor. The 95% CI 
versus placebo will also be presented for the adjusted relative risk.

Edition Date: [ADDRESS_374658] 2015   Page 14 of  73 Supersedes Date: NA 2. INTRODUCTION AND STUDY RATIONALE 
A major function of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is to maintain intestinal 
water/sodium (Na+) homeostasis through a delicate balance of secretory and 
absorption mechanisms. The Na+/hydrogen (H+) antiporter NHE3 plays a dominant 
role in the Na+ re-uptake process. Tenapanor (also known as RDX5791 and 
AZD1722) is a GI-acting NHE3 inhibitor. Tenapanor is a minimally systemic, small 
molecule under investigation for the treatment of constipation-related diseases such as 
chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC), constipation predominant irritable bowe l 
syndrome (IBS-C), and opi[INVESTIGATOR_6919] (OBD). The proposed mechanism 
of action of tenapanor is to reduce Na+ re-uptake. This decrease in Na+ uptake 
increases the net fluid volume in the GI tract. Restoration of normal luminal fluid 
content facilitates intestinal transit and stimulates motility. 
This phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, multi-
center study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of tenapanor in subjects with 
constipation predominant IBS (IBS-C) as defined by [CONTACT_6947] a two-week screening period.  Subjects who 
qualify and are randomized into the study will receive tenapanor 50 mg BID or 
matching placebo BID for 12 consecutive weeks.  At the end of this treatment period, 
there will be a four-week randomized withdrawal (RW) period.  For the RW period, 
subjects who received tenapanor during the 12-week treatment period will be 
randomized to receive either tenapanor 50 mg BID or placebo BID and those subjects 
who received placebo during the 12-week treatment period will receive tenapanor 50 
mg BID; this will all be performed under double-blind conditions. 
2.1. Scientific Background 
2.1.1 Overview of IBS 
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common disorder seen by 
[CONTACT_6948]. These changes in bowel patterns may manifest as diarrhea, 
constipation or an alternation between the two. As there are no pathognomonic, 
laboratory, endoscopic or radiographic abnormalities found in association with IBS it 
is considered a functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder. The chronic nature of the 
multiple symptoms of IBS, combined with the lack of effective treatments, leads to 
significant health care resources being used by [CONTACT_6949]’ well-being and functional ability.  For research and regulatory purposes, th e 
diagnosis of IBS has been described by [CONTACT_6950] 14 (Appendix A) . 
2.2. Description of Investigational Drug

2.3. Previous Human Experience 
2.3.1 Safety 
Tenapanor has been studied in 14 clinical trials in healthy volunteers, IBS-C, chronic 
kidney disease (CKD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients; greater than 
[ADDRESS_374660] received tenapanor.  In the single- and multiple-ascending dose 
phase 1 clinical trial where tenapanor was administered once a day, there were very 
few treatment emergent adverse events. In the SAD phase, 3 RDX5791-treated 
subjects (two 50 mg [33%], one 150 mg [17%]) and 2 placebo-treated subjects (20%) 
reported AEs. In the MAD phase, 11 tenapanor-treated subjects (two 3 mg [25%], two 
10 mg [25%], four 30 mg [50%], and three 100 mg [36%]) and [ADDRESS_374661] (13%) reported AEs. The majority of AEs in both phases were mild in 
severity and not considered to be related to study drug administration. 
In the Phase [ADDRESS_374662] common TEAEs were 
gastrointestinal disorders, including abdominal pain (9.5% and 14.3% of subjects in 
the total tenapanor and placebo groups, respectively), abnormal gastrointestinal 
sounds (6% and 0%, respectively), and abdominal discomfort (4.8% and 0%, 
respectively). 
In a 4-week Phase 2a study in IBS- C subjects, where tenapanor was administered at 
10, 30, and [ADDRESS_374663] infection, and headache (5 [4%] subjects each) and 
abdominal distention, flatulence, and nausea (3 [2%] subjects). No apparent dose 
relationship was seen with regard to the incidence of these commonly reported 
adverse events; there were no drug-related SAEs. 
In a 12-week Phase 2b study in IBS- C subjects, where tenapanor was administered at 
5, 20, and [ADDRESS_374664] 
infection. Diarrhea was experienced by 0 (0.0%) subjects in the placebo group, 7 
(8.0%) subjects in the tenapanor 5 mg BID group, 11 (12.4%) subjects in the 
tenapanor 20 mg BID group, and 10 (11.2%) subjects in the tenapanor [ADDRESS_374665] frequently reported drug- related TEAEs were diarrhea, headache,

[ADDRESS_374667] in the placebo group (osteomyelitis), 2 subjects in the tenapanor 5 mg BID 
group (laryngeal neoplasm and urinary tract infection), and [ADDRESS_374668] in the tenapanor 
20 mg BID group (small intestinal obstruction). None of the SAEs were considered to 
be related to study drug. 
The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation of study drug were 
diarrhea (3 [3.4%] subjects each in the tenapanor 5 mg, 20 mg, and 50 mg BID 
groups) and abdominal distension (3 [3.4%] subjects in the tenapanor 5 mg BID 
group). No other specific TEAE (preferred term) led to discontinuation for more than

2.4.
 Dose Rationale 
Results from the Phase 2b study in IBS-C demonstrated that tenapanor 50 mg BID 
had statistically significant effects in the primary endpoint of CSBM responder rate 
with consistent effects in both overall and abdominal pain responder rates. Results 
from this study also demonstrated that 20 mg BID (the next lowest dose) did not have 
statistically significant effects in key endpoints.  Based on results from this double-
blind, placebo-controlled study, 50 mg BID was selected as the dose for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_6921] 3 clinical trial. 
3. STUDY OBJECTIVES 
3.1. Primary Objective 
The primary objective of this study is: 
 To assess the efficacy of tenapanor 50 mg for the treatment of IBS-C when 
administered twice daily (BID) for 12 consecutive weeks.  
3.2. Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives of this study are: 
 To assess the safety and tolerability of tenapanor 50 mg when administered twice 
daily (BID) for 12 consecutive weeks.  
 To assess the efficacy of tenapanor 50 mg BID after a 4-week placebo controlled 
randomized withdrawal period 
3.3. Exploratory Objective 
The exploratory objective of this study is: 
 To collect and store DNA for future exploratory research into plasma biomarkers 
and genes/genetic variation related to the gastrointestinal disease area or that may 
influence response (i.e., distribution, safety, tolerability and efficacy) to tenapanor 
4. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
This is a Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study of 
tenapanor in subjec
ts with IBS-C.  Patients who are 18 to 75 years old, meeting the 
definition of IBS-C as defined by [CONTACT_6951] (see 
Appendix A ) will undergo a
 battery of screening procedures to determine eligibility 
for the trial.  A 2:[ADDRESS_374673] of 
a 2-week screening period, a 12-week treatment period, and 
a 4-week randomized withdrawal period.

Edition Date: [ADDRESS_374674] 2015   Page 20 of  73 Supersedes Date: NA assessed with respect to their meeting the eligibility requirements of the study.   
At the beginning of the 2-week screening period (Day -14), subjects will be 
questioned with respe
ct to their eligibility for the study.  Those that meet the basic 
requirements will be asked to provide written informed consent.  The basic screening 
assessments will include: evaluation of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, medical 
history (including details about co-morbid disorders), physical exam, vital signs, 
ECG, and clinical laboratory tests, including urinalysis. Subjects must discontinue the 
use of all prohibited medications at Visit 1 (Screening/Day -14) for the duration of the 
study, as referenced in Section 
5.6.  During the screening period, subjects will self-
report daily 
information about the status of their IBS symptoms via a touch-tone 
telephone diary. Each day, entries into the telephone diary (IVRS diary) must occur 
between 6PM and 11:59PM (local time). This will include information about their 
stool frequency, stool consistency, straining, abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, 
abdominal bloating, abdominal fullness, abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and rescue medication 
usage. IBS severity, and constipation severity will be collected weekly through the 
IVRS diary. Subject compliance with the electronic diary will be monitored actively 
by [CONTACT_306113].   
At the end of the screeni
ng period, prior to the subject returning for Visit 2 
(Randomization), a member of the site staff will confirm a subject’s eligibility with 
regard to the information they have reported in their electronic diary during screening.  
If the information captured in the diary deems them eligible, and they continue to 
meet the inclusion criteria at Visit 2, a member of the site staff will randomize the 
subject into a treatment group using an interactive web-response system (IW RS).  
Subjects will be randomized into a treatment group according to a computer-
generated central randomization schema. All subjects who receive at least one dose of 
study drug, with at least one valid week of efficacy assessment data will be included 
in the intention- to-treat (ITT) analysis set. All subjects who receive at least one dose 
of study drug will be included in all analyses of safety data.   
During the 12-week double-blind treatment period and the 4-week double-blind 
randomized withdrawal period, subjects will continue to record daily and weekly 
assessments via a touch-tone telephone diary system as instructed. Subjects will be 
seen weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 (Days 15, 29, 57, and 85) during the treatment period and 
week 2 (Day 99) of the RW period for study assessment visi ts.  Subject compliance 
with daily diary entries will be monitored on an ongoing basis as described above.  
Subject compliance with study drug will also be monitored closely by [CONTACT_306114] 4-week randomized withdrawal period 
(week 16, Day 113) to obtain safety and other end-of-study information.

6. TREATMENTS 
6.1. Identity of Investigational Product  
Tenapanor (as the dihydrochloride salt) drug product will be supplied as white to off-
white oval biconvex film-coated tablets.. Matched placebo tablets will also be 
provided.   
6.2. Packaging, Storage, and Labeling 
The study drug will be supplied in white square HDPE bottles with child resistant 
polypropylene CRC closures with an induction seal plus desiccants.  Each bottle will 
contain sixty-six (66) tablets. 
Tenapanor and placebo tablets should be stored in the original packaging between 
2°C and 30°C. Temperature excursions are allowed from -30°C to 50°C excursions 
for a maximum of 1 week. 
Each bottle will be labeled with a single panel, double blind label.   
6.3. Treatments to be Administered 
Study drug will be dispensed only to eligible subjects under the supervision of the 
Investigator or identified sub-Investigator(s).  Eligible subjects will be randomized 
1:1 into one of two treatment groups: tenapanor [ADDRESS_374690] meal of the day and immediately prior to 
dinner.   
Subjects will receive a 4-week supply of drug at Visit 2 (Day 1), Visit 4 (Day 29 ± 3), 
Visit 5 (Day 57 ± 3 days) and Visit 6 (Day 85 ± 3 days).  At Visits 4, 5, 6, and 8 (Day 
113 ± 3 days) the subject will be asked to return their unused drug and bottles.  All 
unused study drug and bottles should be returned to the study site.  Study drug 
compliance will be monitored closely by [CONTACT_306115]-site monitoring visits.

Both randomization and blinding techniques will be used in this study to minimize 
bias.  Randomization will occur twice; at Visit 2 for the 12-week treatment phase and 
at Visit 6 for the 4-week randomized withdrawal period.  A computer generated 
randomization schema will be centrally available via an interactive web response 
system (IWRS) to all clinical centers that meet the requirements for participation in 
the study.  The IWR system can be accessed by a computer by [CONTACT_6958] a user ID and password.   
In order to double-blind the study, the study drug is labeled in a manner to ensure that 
neither investigators nor subjects can distinguish between treatment groups.   
In the case of a medical emergency where, in the Investigator’s judgment, the 
subject’s safety may be compromised without immediate knowledge of the exact 
treatment received, the Investigator can contact [CONTACT_6959].   
All reasonable effort should be made to reach the Medical Monitor prior to 
unblinding.  If the treatment is unblinded, the Investigator should immediately 
contact:

stable or chronic condition or concurrent illness(es).  Definitions, documentation, and 
reporting of adverse events are described in detail in Section 9 .   
[IP_ADDRESS] Medical history and physical examination 
An abbreviated medical history will be obtained over the telephone at the time of the 
prescreening questionnaire (if performed) for the purpose of determining eligibility.  
A full medical history will be taken at Screening during Visit 1.  A complete physical 
examination will be conducted during Visits 1, 6 and 8.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiogr am 
A 12-lead electrocardiogram will be obtained during Visits 1, 6 and 8. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital signs 
Vital signs, including heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], sitting systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure (SSBP, SDBP), temperature, and body weight will be obtained at all Visits.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical laboratory tests 
A central laboratory will perform clinical laboratory tests.  Blood samples will be 
drawn from subjects for s
erum chemistries and hematology at Visits 1, 4, 6 and 8.  
Urine will be taken for urinalysis at Visits 1, 2 (pregnancy test only), 4, 6, and 8.  A 
FSH test will be performed, as appropriate at Visit 1.  See Appendix C  for spe
cific 
laboratory 
tests.   
Clinical labora
tory test values that are considered abnormal will be noted as clinically 
significant or non-clinically significant by [CONTACT_6962].  Clinical laboratory 
test values that are out of the normal limits are considered to be abnormal.   
Handling and shipment of clinical laboratory samples will be outlined in the Lab 
Manual.   
8.4.2 Efficacy Assessments 
Subjects will report efficacy assessments via an interactive voice response system 
(IVRS) utilizing a touch-tone telephone.  Efficacy assessments will be collected daily 
and weekly, unless otherwise specified, from the beginning of the screening period 
through the end of the randomized withdrawal period.  The daily questions will 
include information about bowel movement frequency, completeness of bowel 
emptying, stool consistency, straining, abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, 
abdominal bloating, abdominal fullness, abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and use of rescue 
medications.  IBS severity and constipation severity will be collected weekly during 
the screening, treatment, and randomized withdrawal periods. Adequate relief of IBS 
symptoms and degree of relief of IBS symptoms will be collected weekly during the 
treatment and randomized withdrawal periods.  Treatment satisfaction (Visits 4, 5, 6, 
and 8) and IBS-QOL (Visits 2, 6, and 8) will also be evaluated during the subjects' 
site visit.

9. ADVERSE EVENTS 
9.1. Adverse Event 
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered 
a pharmaceutical product, whether or not the occurrence has causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered 
related to the investigational product.  This includes any newly occurring event or 
previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration 
of the investigational product.   
Worsening of IBS symptoms is not considered an adverse event unless the frequency 
and/or severity of the symptom(s) is outside of what the subject considers normal for 
their IBS.   
9.2. Severity 
The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in 
mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction).  Even though the event itself may 
be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a severe headache), this is not the 
same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria as 
described above and are usually associated with events that pose a threat to a

Clinical Study Protocol                                     Protocol No. TEN- 01-301 
Edition No.: 1 CONFIDENTIAL Supersedes Edition: NA 
Edition Date: [ADDRESS_374711] 2015   Page 39 of  73 Supersedes Date: NA subject’s life or functioning.  A severe adverse event is not necessarily serious.  For 
example, persistent nausea of several hours duration may be considered severe nausea 
but not meet the definition of a SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke resulting in only a 
minor degree of persistent disability may be considered mild, but would be defined as 
a SAE based on the above noted criteria.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide 
for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
For both serious and non-serious adverse events, the Investigator must determine the 
severity of the event using the following definitions: 
Mild  The event does not interfere in a significant manner with the subject’s 
normal functioning level.  It may be an annoyance but does not cause any 
limitation in usual activity.   
Moderate  The event produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous 
to health.  It is uncomfortable or an embarrassment and may cause some 
limitation in usual activity.   
Severe  The event produces significant impairment or incapacitation and is a 
definite hazard to the subject’s health.   
9.3. Unexpected Adverse Drug Experience 
An unexpected adverse experience is any adverse drug experience, the specificity or 
severity of which is not consistent with the current Investigator’s Brochure, or if an 
Investigator’s Brochure is not required or available, which is not consistent with the 
risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the 
current application, as amended.  “Unexpected,” as used in this definition refers to an 
adverse drug experience that has not previously been observed (e.g., included in the 
Investigator’s Brochure) rather than from the perspective of such an experience not 
being anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the pharmaceutical product.   
9.4. Causality 
Association of adverse events to the study drug will be made using the following 
definitions:   
Not related:  The event is most likely produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s 
clinical condition, intercurrent illness, or concomitant drugs, and does not follow a 
known response pattern to the study drug, or the temporal relationship of the event to 
study drug administration makes a causal relationship unlikely 
Possibly-related:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
drug administration, and/or follows a known response pattern to the study drug, but 
could have been produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical condition, 
intercurrent illness, or concomitant drugs  
Probably-related:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time 
of drug administration, and/or follows a known response pattern to the study drug, 
and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical 
condition, intercurrent illness, or concomitant drugs.

Edition Date: [ADDRESS_374712] 2015   Page 40 of  73 Supersedes Date: NA 9.5. Serious Adverse Event 
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence, that at any 
dose, regardless of causality: 
 results in death. 
 is life-threatening.  Life threatening means that the subject was at 
immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not 
include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form might have 
caused death.   
 requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or surgical operations 
scheduled to occur during the study period, but planned prior to study 
entry are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the 
subject was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery performed earlier than 
planned). 
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  Disability is 
defined as a substantial disruption of a persons’ ability to conduct normal 
life functions.   
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.   
 An important medical event that may not result in death, be life-
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6931] a SAE when, 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in the definition of SAE.  Examples of such medical 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse. 
9.6. Procedures for Recording and Reporting AEs and SAEs 
Adverse events, both serious and non-serious, will be reported between Day 1 
(Randomization) and the final visit (up to Day 113, Visit 8).  Medical events that 
occur between the signing of the informed consent and the first dose of study drug 
will be documented as part of the subject’s medical history and recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF page.   
All adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an 
open question from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination 
or other diagnostic procedures will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF.  
Any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory tests or other clinical finding is 
considered an adverse event and must be recorded on the appropriate pages of the 
eCRF.  When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying 
pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event or diagnosis.

It is the responsibility of the Investigator to promptly notify the Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) of all SAEs, as well as any 
unanticipated problems that involve significant risk to subjects.  A copy of the 
IRB/IEC notification should be placed in the sites’ regulatory binder.   
9.7. Monitoring of Adverse Events and Period of Observation 
Adverse events, both serious and non-serious, will be recorded on the eCRFs up to 
and including the final visit (Day 113, Visit 8).  All adverse events should be 
monitored until they are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a subject’s 
stable or chronic condition or concurrent illness(es).   
Follow-up data concerning the SAE (e.g., diagnostic test reports, physician's 
summaries, etc.) must also be submitted to the Sponsor as they become available,

event, the Investigator will be asked to provide those data to Ardelyx in a timely 
fashion.   
The Investigator will review each serious adverse event report and further evaluate 
the relationship of the adverse event to the study drug and to the subject’s underlying 
disease.  Based on the Investigator assessment of the adverse event, a decision will be 
made concerning the need for further action.  The primary consideration governing 
further action is whether new findings affect the safety of other subjects participating 
in the clinical study.  If the discovery of a serious and unexpected adverse event 
related to the study drug raises concern over the safety of its continued administration 
to subjects, the Sponsor will take immediate steps to notify the FDA and other 
pertinent regulatory authorities and all Investigators participating in clinical studies of 
the study drug.   
Any serious adverse event that occurs at any time after completion of the study, 
which the Investigator considers to be related to study drug, must be reported to 
Ardelyx within forty-eight (48) hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the 
event.

anomalies.   
10. STATISTICA
L CONSIDERATIONS 
This is a Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study of 
tenapanor in subjects with IBS-C.  Treatment to be administered consists of two 
treatment groups: placebo and tenapanor 50 mg twice daily (BID, total daily dose of 
100 mg) for 12 consecutive weeks. At the end of the treatment period there will be a 
4-week randomized withdrawal (RW) period in which all subjects in the placebo arm 
will be given tenapanor 50 mg BID and subjects in the tenapanor arm will be 
randomized 1:1 to receive either placebo or tenapanor 50 mg BID; this will be 
performed in a double-blind manner.  At least 600 subjects will be enrolled at 
approximately 100-120 US clinical centers.  Each center is expected to enroll 
approximately six (6) subjects, however, enrollment is competitive and centers will 
be allowed to enroll subjects beyond the expected site projection.   
A formal statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed, finalized, and signed-off 
on prior to the database lock and unblinding of treatment assignment.  It is anticipated 
that the SAP will be submitted prior to the first subject being enrolled in the study. 
This plan will confirm the analysis sets used in the analysis, outline all data handling 
conventions, and specify all statistical methods to be used for all safety and efficacy 
analyses. The SAP will pre-specify exploratory and sensitivity analyses as additions 
to analyses included in the protocol.  In particular, the primary analysis and key 
secondary analyses will remain the same. If after the data has been unblinded and 
additional analyses are implemented or planned analyses are changed, such deviations

Edition No.: 1 CONFIDENTIAL Supersedes Edition: NA 
Edition Date: [ADDRESS_374715] 2015   Page 43 of  73 Supersedes Date: NA will be documented in the clinical study report. Any implications for the 
interpretation of the trial results will be addressed.  A set of table, listing, and figure 
shells will also be part of this plan for internal use .  Any changes to the statistical 
considerations described in Section 10 of this protocol will be addressed in the SAP 
and will not be part of a
 protocol amendment. 
10.1. Determin
ation of Sample Size 
A sample size of 300 in each treatment group would achieve 95% power to detect a 
difference of 0.15 (15 %) between the placebo and tenapanor 50 mg BID 6/[ADDRESS_374716] 45% 
under the alternative hypothesis and the responder rate in the placebo group is no 
closer than 15% from tenapanor [ADDRESS_374717] statistic used was the two-sided 
Fisher's exact test with significance level of 0.050 (5%).  This sample size also has 
80% power to detect an 11.6% difference in responder rates between the treatment 
groups when the responder rates are in the same range as above.  
10.2. Randomization and Stratification 
A computer generated randomization schema will be made available centrally to all 
clinical centers that meet the requirements for participation in the study via an 
interactive web response system (IWRS).  The IWRS can be accessed with a 
computer by [CONTACT_6975] a study-issued user ID and password implemented to 
limit access and document a user log.  The packaging and labeling of the study drug 
kits will be based on a separate drug packaging randomization schedule.  Upon 
satisfaction of the eligibility criteria, study site personnel will call into the IWRS and 
obtain permission to randomize the subject.  The IWRS will determine which drug 
package for the site to administer to the subject based on a randomization schedule 
where each treatment is allocated once using a block size of 4 within each study site. 
Hence, randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_6976]/or partial block sizes randomized.   
10.3. Analysis Sets 
Safety Analysis Set: 
All subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug will be included in all 
analyses of safety data.  Such subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment 
actually received. 
Intent to Treat (ITT) Analysis Set: 
All subjects who meet the study entry inclusion/exclusion criteria, receive at least one 
dose of study drug, and have at least one valid week of efficacy assessment data 
(minimum of 4 days) will be included in the ITT analysis set.  Subjects will be 
analyzed according to the treatment group into which they were randomized.  The 
ITT analysis set will be the primary analysis set for efficacy analysis. 
10.4. Procedures for Handling Missing Data 
      The primary analysis will be based on the observed data where weekly SBMs and 
CSBMs will be standardized to 7-day frequencies. This amounts to missing days

Edition Date: [ADDRESS_374718] 2015   Page 44 of  73 Supersedes Date: NA during the week being imputed with the mean for the non-missing days.  A valid 
week will require at least [ADDRESS_374719] to these items. However, the average weekly stool consistency 
and the average weekly straining score will be calculated on the observed number of 
responses without any standardization. For the purposes of calculating an average, 
days with no stools reported (i.e., a 0 was recorded for the answer to IVRS question 
6) will be scored as [ADDRESS_374720]’s endpoint value 
represents the last experience while receiving study drug.  
 
      Otherwise, all other observed data will be used in the analyses. 
10.5. Methods of Pooling Data 
      For the purpose of adjusting for investigator effects in statistical models, investigator 
sites will be pooled into groups based on geographic region and number of subjects 
enrolled with an aim for comparable sample sizes among pooled investigator sites. 
The goal of the pooling strategy will be to avoid less than a minimum number of 
subjects per pooled investigator site.  The size of a pooled investigator site would 
generally not be larger than the total number of subjects enrolled at the highest 
enrolling individual investigator site. The pooled investigator sites will be used in all 
applicable analyses where adjustment for investigator effect is desired.  
 Based on an average of 6 subjects per site to be enrolled, the primary pooled 
investigator site strategy will target 10 pools of approximately 60 subjects each 
(approximately 30 per treatment group per pooled investigator site). As a sensitivity 
analysis, a second pooling will have a target of 20 pools of approximately 30 subjects 
each (approximately 15 per treatment group per pooled investigator site). The actual 
designation of membership in a pooled investigator site cannot be made until the final 
enrollment quantities and final number of sites used is completed. The final pooling 
strategy will be defined before treatment unblinding, and will be provided as an 
addendum to the SAP. The goals stated above will be adhered to as closely as 
possible.

Edition Date: [ADDRESS_374721] 2015   Page 45 of  73 Supersedes Date: NA 10.6. Visit Windows 
      Daily IVRS diary data are planned for daily collection starting on the day of the 
Screening visit and continuing until the planned Week 16 (Visit 8 Day 113) RW  visit. 
 
      Weekly IVRS diary data are planned for each week of the 2-week screening period 
(when applicable), each week of the 12-week treatment period, and each week of the 
4-week RW  period.  
 
      For all IVRS efficacy data, the date collected will be used to calculate a relative study 
day (Rel Day). The relative study day will be calculated as the number of days from 
the day of first dose. The date of the first dose date is Day 1. The preceding day is 
Day -1, the day before that is Day -2, etc. There is no Day 0. 
 
      Actual study periods will be defined as follows for the purposes of the efficacy 
evaluations: 
 
 Screening/Baseline Period (Rel Days -14 through Day -1): For the average weekly 
CSBM s, average weekly SBMs, average weekly stool consistency, average weekly 
straining score, and average weekly abdominal symptom score (pain, discomfort, 
bloating, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and fullness), the most recent 7 days will be used to calculate 
Week -1 values (i.e., days -1 through -7) and remaining days will be used for Week - 2 
calculations (i.e., day -8 through -14 or more if applicable). The baseline for these 
variables will then be based on the average of the week -2 and week -1 values. While 
the screening period may vary somewhat from 14 days, it will generally be required 
that subjects provide two weekly ratings of the weekly IVRS diary questions during 
this period. 
 
 Treatment Period: 
• Week 1 (Rel Day 1- 7) 
• Week 2 (Rel Day 8-14), 
• Week 3 (Rel Day 15-21), 
• Week 4 (Rel Day 22-28), 
• Week 5 (Rel Day 29-35 ), 
• Week 6 (Rel Day 36-42), 
• Week 7 (Rel Day 43-49), 
• Week 8 (Rel Day 50-56), 
• Week 9 (Rel Day 57-63), 
• Week 10 (Rel Day 64-70), 
• Week 11 (Rel Day 70-77), and 
• Week 12 (Rel Day 78-84). 
      The week during which the day of the last dose occurs will be considered the last 
valid week during the 12-week treatment period, assuming it contains at least [ADDRESS_374722] valid week during the 12-week treatment period will be used as the endpoint 
week for weekly efficacy summaries.

10.7. Statistical Analyses 
      Summary tabulations will be presented that will display descriptive statistics for each 
treatment group. The number of observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 
median, and maximum values will be displayed for continuous variables, and the 
number and percent of subjects per category will be displayed for categorical data.  
For subject disposition, demographic and baseline characteristics, medical history, 
gastrointestinal disease history, and prior medications, an overall column (i.e., all 
subjects combined) will be included. 
 
Statistical analyses will be performed at the two-sided significance level of 0.050 
according to the testing procedure described below.  The testing procedure will 
preserve the experiment wise Type I error rate at 5%. All secondary p-values will be 
considered descriptive.   
10.7.[ADDRESS_374724] disposition, inclusion / exclusion criteria, and protocol deviations 
will be listed. 
      The number and percent of subjects in each analysis set will also be tabulated. 
10.7.2 Demographic and Background Characteristics 
      The treatment groups will be descriptively assessed for comparability of demographic 
and baseline characteristics. Variables included in this assessment will be the 
demographic characteristics of age at informed consent (years), gender, race, 
ethnicity, body weight (kg), and BMI (kg/m2). Screening values (week -1, week -2) 
and baseline values (average of week -1 and week -2) for average weekly CSBMs, 
average weekly SBMs, average weekly stool consistency, average weekly straining

      Weekly ratings of IBS severity and constipation severity will also be summarized for 
each of the 2 weeks of the screening period. Both categorical and continuous 
descriptive statistics will be used for the weekly ratings. 
   
      Medical history and gastrointestinal (GI) history will be summarized for the number 
and percentage of subjects for each body system by [CONTACT_6654]. 
Medical history includes verbatim terms recorded for the subjects. GI history includes 
duration (years) since IBS symptoms began before randomization, duration (months) 
since last colonoscopy before randomization, and whether colonoscopy findings are 
not significant. A summary table will be presented for each analysis set. Medical and 
GI history will also be listed. 
10.7.3 Prior/Concomitant Medication 
All prior and concomitant medications administered during the study will be coded 
using the latest available version of the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug 
Reference List. The number and percentage of subjects taking prior and concomitant 
medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_6977] (ATC) class 
and preferred name [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_6654].  A listing of all medications will 
be provided. 
10.7.4 Study Drug Exposure and Compliance 
      Days of exposure to study drug will be summarized with descriptive statistics by 
[CONTACT_6978]. Summary statistics will also be 
presented for percent compliance to study drug by [CONTACT_306119]. The percent compliance to study drug will be calculated as the total 
number of tablets dispensed minus the total number of tablets returned divided by 
[CONTACT_1192], times the number of days during the treatment period, then multiplied by 100. 
10.7.5 Efficacy Variables 
Efficacy variables in this trial will be captured via the IVRS on a daily basis (CSBM 
frequency, SBM frequency, consistency, straining, and abdominal symptoms of pain, 
discomfort, bloating, fullness, and crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) or weekly basis (IBS severity, and 
constipation severity) during the screening (baseline) period, the 12 week treatment 
period, and the RW  period.  Adequate relief of IBS symptoms and degree of relief of 
IBS symptoms will be collected weekly during the treatment period and RW period. 
The IBS-QOL will be collected by [CONTACT_306120]. Treatment satisfaction will be recorded at 
the end of each month during the treatment period and the end of the RW period.  Use 
of rescue medication is also collected daily throughout the screening, treatment, and 
RW periods.  Rescue medication usage is incorporated into the derivation of the 
efficacy variables but is not itself considered an efficacy variable. 
The primary efficacy variable will be the overall responder rate. An overall responder 
will be defined as a weekly responder for 6/12 weeks where both CSBM and

Edition No.: 1 CONFIDENTIAL Supersedes Edition: NA 
Edition Date: [ADDRESS_374726] 2015   Page 48 of  73 Supersedes Date: NA abdominal pain response criteria were met for the week. The CSBM and abdominal 
pain response criteria are defined below. The weekly overall responder rates will be 
summarized for each week of the treatment period and the RW period. 
The CSBM response criteria is defined as an increase of one or more change in 
average weekly CSBMs from baseline.  The definition of a CSBM is as follows: A 
CSBM is a SBM for which the subject responds “yes” to the following question; “Did 
you feel like you completely emptied your bowels?”  Any SBM which is preceded 
within [ADDRESS_374727] 
data reported for a given week (either due to a gap in reporting or due to 
discontinuation), the subject will be considered to be a non-responder for the week.  
A key secondary efficacy variable will be the overall CSBM responder rate. An 
overall CSBM responder will be defined as a weekly CSBM responder for 6/[ADDRESS_374728] 4 days of SBM 
reporting. The average weekly CSBMs and change from baseline (where baseline is 
the average of the 2-weeks during the screening period) for each week of the 
treatment period and 4-week RW period will be summarized.  Baseline for the 4-
week RW period will be the last week of the treatment period. 
The abdominal pain response criteria is defined as a decrease of 30% or more of 
percent change from baseline in average weekly worst abdominal pain. Abdominal 
pain will be scored daily using the scale 0 = No pain to 10 = very severe pain. The 
average weekly abdominal pain score will be calculated as the average score for all 
days during a valid week. Should a subject not have data reported for a given week 
(either due to a gap in reporting or due to discontinuation), the subject will be 
considered to be a non-responder for the week. The average weekly abdominal pain 
score and percent change from baseline (where baseline is the average of the 2-week s 
during the screening period) for each week of the treatment period and 4-week RW 
period will be summarized.  Baseline for the 4-week RW period will be the last week 
of the treatment period. 
A key secondary efficacy variable will be the overall abdominal pain responder rate. 
An overall abdominal pain responder will be defined as a weekly abdominal pain 
responder for 6/[ADDRESS_374729] of the overall responder rate, 
overall CSBM responder rate, and overall abdominal pain responder rate calculated 
using a 9/[ADDRESS_374730] met the responder criteria for the 6/12 week responder 
rates.  In addition, for the 9/12 week CSBM responder criteria, it is also required that 
the average weekly CSBMs for the week are ≥3.  A third set of key secondary 
efficacy variables consist of the durable overall responder rate, durable overall CSBM

Edition No.: 1 CONFIDENTIAL Supersedes Edition: NA 
Edition Date: [ADDRESS_374731] 2015   Page 49 of  73 Supersedes Date: NA responder rate, and durable overall abdominal pain responder rate. The durable 
responder rates use the same 9/[ADDRESS_374732] 3/4 weeks of the treatment period to meet the response criteria.  
For each of the three sets of efficacy variables described above (i.e., 6/12, 9/12, and 
durable responders), several sensitivity analyses will be done. Instead of assuming 
non-response for missing weeks or weeks with less than 4 days of valid diary data, a 
sensitivity analysis will be carried out imputing response for these weeks. Similarly, 
instead of assuming a 30% reduction for percent change from baseline in abdominal 
pain, these analyses will be repeated using a 40% reduction and a 50% reduction as 
response criteria. Note that for these last 2 analyses, the CSBM responder analyses 
will not be repeated, only the overall and abdominal pain responder rates.     
Secondary efficacy variables will include the following: 
The proportion of subjects with ≥ [ADDRESS_374733] the consistency of each of their bowel movements on a daily 
basis through the I
VRS utilizing the BSFS scale ( Appendix B ). The
 average weekly 
stool consistency
 will be calculated as the average score for all valid SBMs during the 
week.  For purposes of calculating an average, days with no stools will be scored a 0.  
Change from baseline for each week of the 12-week treatment period and 4-week RW 
period will be summarized using the observed data. Baseline for the 4-week RW 
period will be the last week of the treatment period. 
Straining will be
 scored for each SBM using the scale 1 = not at all, 2 = a little bit, 3 
= a moderate amount, 4 = a great deal, 5 = an extreme amount.  The average weekly 
straining score will be calculated as the average score for all valid SBMs during the 
week. Change from baseline for each week of the 12-week treatment period and 4-
week RW  period will be summarized using the observed data.  Baseline for the 4-
week RW period will be the last week of the treatment period. 
Abdominal discomfort, abdominal bloating, abdominal fullness, and abdominal 
crampi[INVESTIGATOR_6934] 0-10 point scale with 0 representing no 
presence of the symptom and 10 representing very severe presence of the symptom.  
The average weekly scores will be calculated as the average score for all days during 
a valid week. Percent change from baseline for each week of the 12-week treatment 
period and 4-week RW period will be summarized. In addition, responders at each 
week (i.e., 30% improvement from baseline)   and for 6/[ADDRESS_374734] week of the treatment 
period.

scores and constipation severity scores for each week of the study will be summarized 
as categorical and continuous data. Observed data will be used for the summaries.  
Baseline for the 4-week RW period will be the last week of the treatment period. 
Adequate relief of IBS symptoms (1 = yes, and 2 = no) will be asked on a weekly 
basis.  The percentage of subjects with adequate relief for each week of the study will 
be summarized using observed data. 
Degree of relief of IBS symptoms will be scored on a weekly basis using 
1=completely relieved, 2=considerably relieved, 3=somewhat relieved, 4=unchanged, 
5=somewhat worse, 6=considerably worse, 7=as worse as I can imagine. Degree of 
relief scores for each week of the study will be summarized as categorical and 
continuous data using observed data. 
The IBS-QOL is a validated quality of life tool used for IBS subjects (see Appendix 
D). Subjects will be asked to complete this assessment a Visit 2 (prior to treatment), 
Visit 6 (at the
 end of the 12-week treatment period), and Visit 7 (at the end of the 4-
week RW  period. The predetermined analysis provided with the tool will be used as

10.7.6 Efficacy Analyses 
All efficacy variables involving responder rates or proportions will be analyzed using a 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test with pooled investigator site as a stratification 
(adjustment) variable. Summary statistics will include the pairwise risk difference with 
placebo along with the asymptotic 95% confidence interval (CI). The adjusted relative 
risk (adjusted for pooled investigator site) will be based on the ratio of responder rates for 
placebo versus tenapanor 50 mg BID. The 95% CI versus placebo will also be presented 
for the adjusted relative risk. 
All continuous efficacy variables derived from the daily IVRS questions (i.e., average 
weekly CSBMs, SBMs, stool consistency, straining score, abdominal symptoms of pain, 
discomfort, bloating, fullness, and crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]), as well as the weekly IBS severity, 
constipation severity, and IBS QOL will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model with terms for pooled investigator site, treatment, and baseline as the 
covariable.  Degree of relief of IBS symptoms and treatment satisfaction will be analyzed 
using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with terms for pooled investigator site  
and treatment.   
When the ANCOVA model is implemented, the least square means (LSmeans) will be 
presented for the actual values and change/percent change from baseline values for each 
treatment group with the 95% CI. Statistical testing will only be carried out using the 
change/percent change from baseline since the p-values are the same between the two

Edition Date: [ADDRESS_374738] 2015   Page 53 of  73 Supersedes Date: NA analyses.  The LSmean difference versus placebo will also be presented with the 95% CI. 
When the ANOVA model is implemented, all of the above statistics will be presented for 
the actual values. 
A sequential testing procedure will be utilized to control the experiment wise Type I error 
rate for the
 primary efficacy variable. Because of the desire to also pre-specify key 
secondary efficacy variables, the sequential testing procedure will not inflate the overall 
5% level. The primary efficacy variable will be tested at the 5% level of significance.  If 
this test is significant, the first key secondary efficacy variable listed in Table 10-
1 will 
be tested at the
 5% level. If this test is significant, then the next variable is tested at the 
5% level. This procedure continues until one of the tests in the list results in a p-value 
>5%.  Variables up to this point in the list will be declared statistically significant.  
Interpretation of p-values for the secondary efficacy variables will be descriptive.   
In addition 
to the summaries of the efficacy variables described, figures will be provided 
depi[INVESTIGATOR_6937]/percent change from baseline for each treatment 
group at each assessment time. A secondary analysis will also include graphs depi[INVESTIGATOR_306109].

ECGs and physical examinations.  
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA adverse event coding system for 
purposes of summarization.  All adverse events reported will be listed in the data listings.  
Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be tabulated, where treatment emergent 
is defined as any adverse event which occurs after administration of the first dose of 
study drug and up through the final visit (up to planned Day 113), any event that is 
considered drug-related regardless of the start date of the event, or any event that is 
present at baseline but worsens in severity or is subsequently considered drug-related by 
[CONTACT_093].  TEAEs will also be tabulated by [CONTACT_6981] (possibly or probably drug-related, or unknown in relationship) and by 
[CONTACT_926].  Serious adverse events and TEAEs resulting in study discontinuation will be 
tabulated.   
Actual values and change from baseline values for clinical laboratory tests will be 
summarized for each visit collected during the study.The frequency of clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory test values will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570]. Shift 
tables will be derived for changes in laboratory tests from screening to Visit 4, 6, and 8. 
Vital signs will be summarized descriptively for actual values and change from baseline 
values by [CONTACT_6982]. Vital signs are collected at all study visits during the 
screening period, 12-week treatment period, and 4-week RW period. Baseline for the 
vital signs will be the average of results obtained during the screening period. 
 
Electrocardiogram results will be summarized descriptively for actual values and change 
from screening values by [CONTACT_6982] (Screening (Visit 1/Day -14), Week

11. ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS 
11.1. Good Clinical Practice 
The study will be conducted in accordance with the current GCP/ICH Guidelines and 
relevant regulatory requirement(s).  Compliance with this standard provides public 
assurance that the rights, safety and well-being of trial subjects are protected, consistent 
with the principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and that the 
clinical trial data are credible.  The Investigator will be thoroughly familiar with the 
appropriate use of the study drug as described in the protocol and Investigator’s 
Brochure.  Essential clinical documents will be maintained to demonstrate the validity of 
the study and the integrity of the data collected.  A Trial Master File will be established at 
the beginning of the study, maintained for the duration of the trial and retained according 
to appropriate regulations. 
11.2. Ethical Considerations 
The study will be conducted in accordance with ethical principles that have their 
origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  The IRB/IEC will review all appropriate study 
documentation in order to safeguard the rights, safety and well-being of the subjects.  
The study will only be conducted at sites where IRB/IEC approval has been obtained.  
The protocol, Investigator Brochure, informed consent, advertisements (if applicable), 
written information given to the subjects (including subject information material), 
safety updates, annual progress reports, and any revisions to these documents will be 
provided to the IRB/IEC by [CONTACT_737]. 
11.3. Subject Informed Consent and Information 
Prior to entry in the trial, the Investigator must explain to potential subjects or their 
legally acceptable representative, the trial and the implications of participation.  
Subjects will be told that their participation is voluntary and they may withdraw 
consent to participate at any time.  Subjects will be told that competent authorities 
and authorized Ardelyx personnel, its business partners or its CRO designee may

Edition Date: [ADDRESS_374741] 2015   Page 55 of  73 Supersedes Date: NA such access through an authorization meeting the requirements of the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.  Each subject (or their legall y 
authorized representative) that wants to participate in the study must sign and date the 
ICF (and other locally required documents) after the nature of the study has been fully 
explained prior to performing any study-related activities.  The subject (or their 
legally acceptable representative) will be given sufficient time to read the ICF and to 
ask additional questions.  After having obtained the consent, a copy of the informed 
consent document must be given to the subject.  In case the subject is unable to read, 
an impartial witness must attest the informed consent.  Subjects who are unable to 
comprehend the information provided can only be enrolled after consent by a legally 
acceptable representative.  
The consent form that is used must be approved by [CONTACT_6985].   
All reports and communications relating to the study will identify subjects by [CONTACT_6986].  A “Subject Screening Log” that reports on all subjects 
that were seen to determine eligibility for inclusion in the trial will also be completed 
by [CONTACT_737].  
11.4. Subject Confidentiality 
The collection and processing of data from subjects enrolled in this trial will be 
limited to those data that are necessary to investigate the safety, quality and utility of 
the investigational product(s) used in this trial.  These data will be processed with 
adequate precautions to ensure confidentiality. 
In order to maintain subject/subject privacy, all CRFs, study drug accountability 
records, study reports and communications will identify the subject by [CONTACT_6987].  The Investigator will grant monitor(s) and auditor(s) from 
Ardelyx, its designee(s) and regulatory authority(ies) access to the subject’s original 
medical records for verification of data gathered on the CRFs and to audit the data 
collection process.  The subject’s confidentiality will be maintained and will not be 
made publicly available except to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_6988]. 
11.5. Protocol Compliance 
The Investigator will conduct the trial in compliance with the protocol provided by 
[CONTACT_6989], and given approval by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC and the appropriate regulatory 
authority(ies).  Modifications to the protocol should not be made without agreement 
of both the Investigator and Ardelyx.  Changes to the protocol will require written 
IRB/IEC approval prior to implementation, except when the modification is needed to 
eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to subjects.  The IRB/IEC may provide, if 
applicable regulatory authority(ies) permit, expedited review and approval for minor 
change(s) in ongoing trials that have the approval of the IRB/IEC.  Ardelyx will 
submit all protocol modifications to the regulatory authority(ies) in accordance with 
the governing regulations.

to discuss the planned course of action  
11.6. Study Monitoring and On-site Audits 
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed by [CONTACT_306122], in order to comply with GCP guidelines.  Routine monitoring visits will 
be made to assure compliance with the study protocol, to review and compare the 
subject’s eCRF with source documents, to ensure adequate records of clinical 
supplies are maintained and to assess the continued suitability of the investigational 
site.  The Investigator agrees to allow the site monitors, and other authorized 
personnel or designees, access to the subject’s medical records, regulatory binder, 
study binder, and source documents as needed to assure the conduct of the study was 
within compliance.   
Upon completion of the study the site monitor will make a final assessment of the 
conduct of the study and inventory all clinical supplies to be returned to Ardelyx.  All 
unused study drug is to be returned to Ardelyx or designee.   
Regulatory authorities, the IEC/IRB, and/or Ardelyx’s clinical quality assurance 
group, its CRO designee or business partners may request access to all source 
documents, CRFs, and other study documentation for on-site audit or inspection.  
Direct access to these documents must be guaranteed by [CONTACT_737], who must 
provide support at all times for these activities. 
11.7. Case Report Form Completion 
An Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system will be used for this study.  Electronic 
case report forms (eCRFs) will be accessed for each subject.   
eCRFs will be completed for each randomized study subject.  It is the Investigator’s 
responsibility to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data 
reported in the subject’s eCRF.  Source documentation supporting the eCRF data 
should indicate the subject’s participation in the trial and should document the dates 
and details of study procedures, adverse events and subject status.   
The Investigator, or designated representative, should complete the eCRF pages as 
soon as possible after information is collected, preferably on the same day that a 
study subject is seen for an examination, treatment, or any other study procedure.  
Any outstanding entries must be completed immediately after the final examination.  
An explanation should be given for all missing data.   
Prior to submission within the EDC system, eCRFs must be reviewed for 
completeness and accuracy, and electronically signed and dated by [CONTACT_6991]. 
11.8. Drug Accountability/Retention  
Accountability for the study drug at the trial site is the responsibility of the 
Investigator.  The Investigator will ensure that the study drug is used only in 
accordance with this protocol.  Where allowed, the Investigator may choose to assign 
some of the drug accountability responsibilities to a pharmacist or other appropriate

the site, inventory at the site, use by [CONTACT_6992], and return to Ardelyx (or disposal 
of the drug, if approved by [CONTACT_6989]) will be maintained by [CONTACT_977].  These 
records will adequately document that the subjects were provided the doses as 
specified in the protocol and should reconcile all study drug received from Ardelyx.  
Accountability records will include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_6939] (if applicable), and subject numbers.  Ardelyx or its CRO designee will review 
drug accountability at the site on an ongoing basis during on-site monitoring visits. 
The Investigator acknowledges that the study drug supplies are investigational and as 
such must be handled strictly in accordance with the protocol and container label.  
Supplies should be dispensed under the supervision of the Investigator or designee.  
Study drug will be stored in a limited access area and under the appropriate 
conditions as specified on delivery.   
Unused or partially used bottles of study drug will be stored until the study monitor at 
the end of the study performs a final inventory.  At the completion of this trial, all 
unused, partially unused, or empty multiple-dose bottles must be returned to Ardelyx, 
or designee.   
11.9. Study Completion or Premature Closure 
The Investigator will complete the study and the eCRF in satisfactory compliance 
with the protocol within approximately 1 week of study completion.   
Ardelyx reserves the right to close the investigational site or terminate the trial at any 
time.  Reasons for the closure of an investigational site or termination of a trial by 
[CONTACT_6993]: 
 Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to subjects 
 Failure to enter subjects at an acceptable rate 
 Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements 
 Insufficient complete and/or evaluable data 
 Plans to modify, suspend or discontinue the development of the study drug 
Should the study be closed prematurely, all study materials (completed, partially 
completed, study drug, etc.) must be returned to Ardelyx. 
11.10. Record Retention 
All case report forms and all source documents (e.g., informed consent forms, 
laboratory reports, progress notes, medical histories, physical and diagnostic findings, 
diagnoses and dates of therapy prior to and during this study, drug 
dispensing/disposition records) that support case report forms of each subject must be 
retained in the files of the responsible Investigator for at least [ADDRESS_374744] 
approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending 
or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region; or at least [ADDRESS_374745].  These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if 
required by [CONTACT_1214].  The Investigator should take 
measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these records.  Under no

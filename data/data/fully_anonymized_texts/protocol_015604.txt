Technology ( CHeT )/Clinical Trials Coordination Center  
(CTCC)  Objectives  
 
 1. To establish and implement an infrastructure  for 
longitudinal remote follow -up of phase 3 trial cohorts : 
a. Transition from site -based to a centralized site and 
coordination center to manage all participant  
activity in virtual extensions of SURE -PD3, with 
projected enrollment of ≥70% of final trial cohorts , 
and core data collection in accordance with 
Parkinson’s  Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP)  
schedule of activities.  
b. Conduct an annual research visit (tele -visit) 
program and establish the feasibility and cross -
sectional reliability of tele -visit versus in -person 
visit assessments  in a subset of STEADY -PD III  and 
SURE -PD3 participants . 
c. Deploy  a smartphone application, based on the 
mPower study, for remote data collection in a 
clinical trial cohort as preliminarily characterized 
in the Smart 4SURE sub -study of SURE -PD3. 
d. Establish a mechanism for linking STEADY -PD III 
and SURE -PD3 study data with data collected 
through smartphone -based assessments, tele -
visits, and Fox Insight (FI),  a separate  longitudinal  
patient -reported outcomes  (PRO s) online research 
study.  
2. To compare  patient -driven  (smartphone, web-based 
surveys ) vs clinician -driven (tele-visit) outcomes  by:  
a. Correlating the smartphone and tele -visit 
platforms’ component and composite features, and 
their changes over years . 
b. Comparing the  smartphone and tele -visit 
platforms’ abilities to : i) measure PD progression  
and predict clinical events and changes in PROs ; ii) 
distinguish rapid vs slow progressors based on 
baseline  Movement Disorders Society -Unified 
Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS ) 
scores, dopamine transporter ( DAT) deficit (in 
SURE -PD3) or serum urate levels (in STEADY -PD 
III); iii) demonstrate persistence of any effects of 
isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_292698].  
c. Compari ng completion status and performance on 
FI and tele -visit PROs . 
3. To explore novel smartphone -based real -life mobility 
biomarkers of PD disability and its progression  that 
are normally inaccessible with traditional office 
measures. We will investigate the ability of passively 
collected smartphone data on ambulation and location  
to enable assessments of physical activity and

[CONTACT_292740]-HOME PD the STEADY-PD III and SURE-PD3 trials were active NINDS-funded phase [ADDRESS_357075], reducing participant burden, and enabling the collection of data beyond the usual epi[INVESTIGATOR_49564], in-clinic assessments. The objective of this study is to leverage modern technology to develop, pi[INVESTIGATOR_292699] a 100% virtual model for long-term follow-up utilizing tele-visit and smartphone platforms for quantitative monitoring of clinician- and patient-reported outcomes (PROs).  Study Platforms and 
Outcome Measures  Tele-visit platform  – Participants will complete a total of 
three tele -visits, which will occur at baseline, month 12, and 
month 24. Some activities will be completed either prior to 
or post tele -visit by [CONTACT_2299]. Assessments will 
include:  
x Review of reportable events  
x Review of concomitant medications  
x MDS-UPDRS parts 1a, 3, and 4 (where applicable)  
x Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)  
x Schwab & England Activities of Daily Living Scale 
(SEADL)  
x Clinician Global Impression  and Patient Global 
Impression  – Severity and Change  
x Determination of Falls  
x Performance of one complete set of active motor and 
cognitive smartphone application tasks  (when 
applicable)  
x Review of completion of MDS -UPDRS parts 1b and 2 , 
self-reported falls, and patient global impression – 
severity and change  (with direct link to survey sent 
ahead of visit)  
x Review of compliance with smartphone tasks and FI 
assessments where applicable  
x Preference and Burden Survey  
   Protocol Title: AT-HOME PD [Assessing Tele-Health Outcomes in Multiyear Extensions of PD trials]  
AHPD PROTOCOL_V3; Version date: 11/06/2019   Page 15 | 103  
Investigators  administering MDS -UPDRS part 3 (motor 
examination) will be neurologists or nurse practitioners who 
have obtained formal MDS -UPDRS certification  and will 
have additionally undergo ne joint training to reconcile 
scoring differences and minimize inter -rater variability. 
Tele-visits will be scheduled in either the morning or 
afternoon accor ding to participant preference and, for 
participants on symptomatic dopaminergic therapy, the 
MDS-UPDRS will be preferably performed in the usual ON 
state.  
 
FI web-based survey platform  – Participants  will be asked 
to complete a set of standard questionnaires every [ADDRESS_357076] assessments include:  
x The Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire, short -form 8 
item ver sion (PDQ -8) 
x MDS-UPDRS part 2  
x Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE)  
x Your Cognition and Daily Activities (PDAQ -15) 
x Euroqol Five (EQ -5D)  
x Non-motor symptoms questionnaire (NMS -QUEST ) 
x Geriatric Depression Scale, short form (GDS)  
x Parkinson’s Disease -Patient Reported Outcomes of 
Problems ( PD-PROP ) 
Participants are invited to complete additional PRO surveys 
about , but not limited to , symptoms, disease progression, 
quality of life , patient preference or general health.  
Smartphone session platform (mPower -based app)  – We 
will use mPower  2.0 developed by [CONTACT_292741].  mPower will include  active tasks to be 
completed (S cientific Aim (SA) 2) and allow passive collection 
of motor and mobility data with participant  permission (for 
SA3). 14-day smartphone sessions will occur every [ADDRESS_357077] morning or afternoon as their preferred 
window for completion and to consiste ntly complete the 
active tasks according to their selected preference.  
Motor Tasks:  
x Gait task - a 30 second walk   
x Finger tappi[INVESTIGATOR_91989] - 30 seconds of rapid finger 
tappi[INVESTIGATOR_292700]: AT-HOME PD [Assessing Tele-Health Outcomes in Multiyear Extensions of PD trials]  
AHPD PROTOCOL_V3; Version date: 11/06/2019   Page 16 | 103 x Resting tremor task - 30 seconds of holding phone  in 
each hand  
x Balance task - 30 seconds of standing still  
  Cognitive Assessments:  
x Digit span  
x Digit symbol substitution  
x Spatial working memory  
Enrolled participants will  also use the application to track 
their medication adherence relative to tasks and, optionally , 
self-reported symptoms and triggers . For those participants 
who optionally consent to passive data collection, the 
smartphone application will collect multiple  streams of 
passive data including: movement patterns captured by 
[CONTACT_292742],  and pedometer.  Study Compliance  Compliance with all three study platforms will be monitored.  
CHeT/CTCC will monitor compliance through tele-visits and 
patient interview during the visit . Sage  Bionetworks  will 
utilize push notifications  and Short Message Service  (SMS) 
reminders to encourage compliance with smartphone -based 
assessments . MJFF will send automated e -mail reminders 
to complete the quarterly assessments after approximately 
45 days and again after approximately 88 days.  CHeT/CTCC 
will receive quarterly compliance reports f rom Sage 
Bionetworks and from MJFF (until a publicly -accessible 
research dashboard becomes available through University of 
Southern [LOCATION_004]’s Laboratory of Neuro Imaging ( LONI )). Data Management  1) Data collected during tele -visits  will be entered and 
maintained in REDCap (a secure web -based survey and 
data management system ) and transferred to Synapse  (an 
open source collaborative platform, for analysis) .  
2) Survey data collected by [CONTACT_292743] (a 
secure online neuroscience dataset sharing system of 
USC’s) and then to Synapse .  
3) Data collected from smartphones  will be transferred to 
the Sage  Bionetworks maintained Bridge  server  and then 
to Synapse . 
4) All platform data will be transferred from Synapse to 
PDBP -DMR All data will be identified by [CONTACT_292744], the 
date, time of the visit,  and then transferred to the Sage 
Bionetworks managed Synapse. From Synapse the 
cleaned , processed , and event date and time transformed 
dataset will be transferred to the PDBP’s Data 
Management Resource (DMR) for further distribution to 
PDBP  investigators and will be made available to the wider 
research community through their qualified researchers 
program  [See Resource Sharing Plan ].

AHPD PROTOCOL_V3; Version date: 11/06/2019   Page 17 | 103 All the data being shared will be detailed in the data user 
agreement (DUA).  Statistical Analysis 
(by [CONTACT_292745])  SA 1 : We will use r esults from the REACT -PD study to 
establish a calibration of tele -visit (TV) assessments to 
predict in -clinic MDS -UPDRS scores (Aim 1b ). Lin's 
concordance correlation coefficient, r c, will be used to 
summarize accuracy of the calibrated TV estimates  vs. 
scores collected from in -person SURE -PD3 visits conducted 
close in time , accepting TV estimates as sufficiently accurate 
if rc > 0.8. If we observe insufficient concordance, we will re -
calibrate usin g all available data from both REACT -PD and 
the current study.  
SA 2 : The study sample  will be randomly split 2:1 into 
calibration and validation subsets. The calibration sample 
will be used to derive smartphone ( SP) measure s that best 
match the TV assessed composite scores of motor function 
(MDS -UPDRS part 3), non -motor function (MoCA total 
score) , subjective function (including clinical global 
impression [CGI] scores,  patient global impression scores,  
modified Schwab and Eng land ADL scores, and MDS -
UPDRS parts 1b and 2 scores), and estimates of MDS -
UPDRS part 1 -3 total scores  (Aim 2a) . The accuracy of 
calibrated SP measures will be tested in the reserved 
validation sample using Lin's concordance correlation 
coefficient, r c. If we observe insufficient concordance, we will 
recalibrate using all available data from both the calibration 
and validation samples.  
TV assessments and calibrated SP measures of disease 
progression will be compared generally and between  specific 
subsets of participant s expected to progress at different 
rates (Aim 2b). Each measure will be standardize d to 30% of 
the observed mean change over [ADDRESS_357078] errors will be used  
to estimate the relative sample size required using one or 
another measure for designs with equivalent power. The 
same approach will be used to identify measures that are 
sensitive to biological subgroups (e.g., among participant s 
stratified by [CONTACT_292746] -UPDRS progression over the 
first 2 years of in -clinic follow -up in the parent trials) or

AHPD PROTOCOL_V3; Version date: 11/06/2019   Page 27 | [ADDRESS_357091] will investigate novel strategies for measuring the progressive disability of PD using tele-visits from participants' homes and smartphone technology in order to overcome limitations of traditional clinical trials and thereby [CONTACT_292751]. 1. Tele-health alternatives to traditional in-clinic outcomes data collection a. Advantage of telemedicine (tele-visit) versus in-office research visits and current state of the field  Telemedicine, the use of real-time synchronous videoconferencing with patients, could revolutionize clinical trial design. Telemedicine-based virtual research encounters between participants and clinical investigators (tele-visits) can be conducted on readily available internet-enabled devices and in any location where privacy can be established. Numerous studies have shown that telemedicine is feasible for patients with PD (1,2). In the largest randomized controlled trial of telemedicine in PD to date, 91% of 388 scheduled telemedicine visits were completed (3). With some modifications, the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor component can be administered remotely and demonstrates good test-retest reliability and good overall agreement with in-person UPDRS motor assessment (1,4). A modified version of the UPDRS, with rigidity and postural instability items removed, has been shown to be reliable and valid (5). There have not been any published studies examining the remote administration of the MDS-UPDRS and evaluation is needed to determine if this is a valid and reliable tool when administered remotely. Non-motor assessments, including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), can also be feasibly administered remotely (6). The majority of patients are satisfied or more than satisfied with telemedicine visits (1, 3). Individuals are interested in participating in studies of telemedicine (3) and may be more interested in participating in trials that incorporate tele-visits delivered outside of the home (7). Telemedicine visits result in a reduction in distance travelled, time 
   Protocol Title: AT-HOME PD [Assessing Tele-Health Outcomes in Multiyear Extensions of PD trials]  
AHPD PROTOCOL_V3; Version date: 11/06/2019   Page 28 | [ADDRESS_357092] (8). The incorporation of tele-visits into clinical trials could reduce the burden on participants, enable individuals with greater disability or other (e.g., geographic or economic) travel barriers to participate, allow for long-term clinical trial follow up, enable a shift towards centralized raters (9), and allow for remote obtainment of informed consent (10,11).  b. Value of smartphone-based data acquisition – PD is readily monitored using remote sensors embedded in smartphones or wearables (12-14) due to the outward manifestations of the disease. While wearables have gained popularity for measuring gait within the context of clinical trials, smartphones provide a more flexible, less invasive approach for long-term at-home evaluation. Motor symptoms can be captured using smartphones using built-in accelerometers, pressure sensor in screens and microphones for assessment of phonation, and non-motor symptoms can be tracked by [CONTACT_292752]-reported outcomes (PROs) or other activities. Smartphones have the potential to provide objective, frequent, and sensitive assessments of PD. In the mPower study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), participants have been tracked longitudinally as they perform daily active tasks and PROs. The smartphone application associated with the mPower study was adopted by [CONTACT_46431] 12,[ADDRESS_357093] Biomarker Study. Preliminary evaluation of mPower features relative to in-clinic disease assessments – initiated through collaboration between Co-I Omberg and Dorsey – demonstrated that motor metrics captured by [CONTACT_292753]-clinic assessment of MDS-UPDRS motor exam (R=0.89, p<10-5 for tappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) and were able to identify daily fluctuations in disease burden associated with L-dopa administration or natural diurnal variations (15).  In addition to the ability for remote, self-administered monitoring of proxy for standard disease measures, smartphone assessments also provide multiple opportunities to extend understanding of disease beyond in-clinic measures including 1) the ability to evaluate the impact of disease on quality of life (see Aim 3), and 2) the ability to observe natural fluctuations in disease symptoms over time and in relation to environmental or lifestyle choices (16). In addition to their utility for remote administration of active disease evaluations, smartphones possess the capacity for passively monitoring the impact of PD on daily life over time. Novel measures of ambulatory and social behaviors may be extracted from smartphone (e.g., GPS map) systems to shed light on PD disability inaccessible with traditional in-office measures. Smartphones are generally carried around throughout the day and can provide a low burden approach to collect a continuous stream of passive data including movement patterns (travel distances and location displacements throughout the day), daily activity and exercise patterns, and communication patterns.  In contrast to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_292702], these patterns provide 
   Protocol Title: AT-HOME PD [Assessing Tele-Health Outcomes in Multiyear Extensions of PD trials]  
AHPD PROTOCOL_V3; Version date: 11/06/2019   Page 29 | [ADDRESS_357094]. This has proven problematic in studies of other potentially neuroprotective drugs. For example, the initial data from the DATATOP trial (17-19) conducted by [CONTACT_92075] (PSG) pointed to a disease-modifying effect of selegiline that was not supported by [CONTACT_127620]-term data at least in regard to the primary outcome (20). A more recent example is the inconclusive result of the ADAGIO study of rasagiline (21). Promptly initiated long-term follow up of the cohort would have been highly valuable for further data interpretation. Such an effort was undertaken but unfortunately with a gap of two years post completion of ADAGIO, accounting for a 42% dropout rate from the original cohort, which made data interpretation much less meaningful (22). Nevertheless, a number of important observations on major milestones of PD progression were made by [CONTACT_292754] (20-24). Similarly, follow-up studies evaluating the impact of initiating therapy with dopamine agonists versus levodopa have found that early differences do not necessarily result in longer duration benefits (25,26). Thus, the interpretation of multiple studies of several different potentially disease-modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_292703]-term follow up. Unplanned longer-term follow up of participants in these studies has generated valuable observations though conclusions have been limited by [CONTACT_292755]-hoc analysis.  AT-HOME PD is a 24-month observational study that will seamlessly transition from two parent trials to enroll the majority of their participants. This additional observation may not be sufficiently long to see emergence of long-term disability like postural instability and cognitive impairment, but most of the participants will be approaching the 6-7 year-mark from PD onset when the dopaminergic therapy (DT) ‘honeymoon’ has ended (27) and such events begin to manifest in earnest. Thus, the follow up of these merged phase [ADDRESS_357095] observational studies of a baseline de novo PD population, is likely long and large enough to provide insight into: 1) any persistent or delayed effect of isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_292704]-motor outcomes, and 2) milestones of disease progression in the current era of PD therapeutics. The cohort will be especially valuable as it is enriched by [CONTACT_292756] (with sequentially collected plasma samples +/- DAT imaging), which will be fully integrated into the PDBP database, and the dataset will be open to the public. The only other baseline de novo cohort of similar size is the Parkinson’s

AHPD PROTOCOL_V3; Version date: 11/06/2019   Page 30 | 103 Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI; clintrials.gov [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). While PPMI has a tremendously rich biologics dataset, it is an observational study that never had an interventional arm and currently does not incorporate telemedicine or smartphone assessments. The novelty of AT-HOME PD stems not only from long-term follow up of combined PD trial cohorts but also from accomplishing it by [CONTACT_292757].  The AHPD – SUPER-PD Tele-visit Validation sub-study is a single tele-visit occurring in close proximity to in-clinic assessments that will help evaluate the accuracy of tele-visit assessments.  a. Overview of STEADY-PD III (clintrial.gov [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), Phase [ADDRESS_357096] of isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_292705] (28), as well as a number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_292706] (29-33). The Phase 3 study was also supported by [CONTACT_292758]-label and Phase 2 multicenter safety, tolerability and dose selection studies (34,35). The primary hypothesis of the study is that patients with early PD treated with isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_292707] (36) score between baseline and 36 months in 336 participants with early PD not yet requiring dopaminergic therapy (DT). The STEADY-PD III study design and methodology have been published (37). b. Overview of SURE-PD3 (clintrial.gov [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Trial of Urate-elevating Inosine Treatment to Slow Clinical Decline in Early PD.  The primary objective of SURE-PD3 is to determine whether the urate precursor inosine dosed to moderately elevate serum urate over [ADDRESS_357097] a reduced risk of PD and a slower rate of progression. Our phase 2 trial demonstrated our ability to produce long-term CSF and serum urate elevation with adequate safety and tolerability (38). SURE-PD3 has been conducted at ~60 US PSG clinical sites.  Unique features of SURE-PD3 include its enrichment for participants with lower serum urate (predictive of faster clinical decline) and its exclusion of subjects without a striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) deficit demonstrated on a screening DAT scan, which can increase the likelihood of an accurate diagnosis of PD, in early, untreated disease. SURE-PD3, like STEADY-PD III, includes a biomarker sub-study with blood collected for DNA (e.g., for whole genome sequencing) and serial plasma sample storage. In addition, a follow-up DAT scan will be conducted in SURE-PD3 to estimate rates of striatal DAT binding site

AHPD PROTOCOL_V3; Version date: 11/06/2019   Page 31 | [ADDRESS_357098] of a clinical trial in PD. Participants were scheduled for a tele-visit within 2-4 weeks of a corresponding in-person STEADY-PD III visit over 12 months, with visit frequency dependent on the participant’s STEADY-PD III visit schedule. All clinical trial assessments performed at the preceding in-person visit were performed remotely during the tele-visit, including motor assessments, non-motor assessments, and orthostatic vital signs. Visits were performed on smartphones that were provided to participants. Study results:  1) Feasibility:  Preliminary data suggests that tele-visits are feasible. The study started recruitment in April 2016 and successfully completed recruitment of 40 participants within ~4 months. 38/40 participants completed all three tele-visits and 84% of tele-visits were completed within window. 2) Reliability:  There was excellent correlation between in-person visits and tele-visits for non-motor outcome measures. Intra-class correlation (ICC) coefficients for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), MDS-UPDRS 1A, MDS-UPDRS 1B, and MDS-UPDRS II were 0.78, 0.83, 0.88, and 0.90 respectively.  There was good correlation for the MDS-UPDRS Part III (ICC 0.53). 3) Value: Participant satisfaction has been positive with >90% of participants being satisfied or very satisfied with the convenience, connection, and comfort of the tele-visit. More than 75% of participants agreed or strongly agreed that they would be more interested in participating in future clinical trials if some visits could be conducted virtually.

AHPD PROTOCOL_V3; Version date: 11/06/2019   Page 32 | 103 Final longitudinal analysis will be completed once STEADY-PD III database is locked  2. Smart4SURE is an ongoing remote observational study embedding technology from mPower into the SURE-PD3 trial. Designed as a feasibility study, the primary aim is to determine the ability to track disease progression using remote assessment via a smartphone. Smart4SURE longitudinally collects measures of parkinsonian motor (speeded tappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], phonation, gait, balance, and resting/postural/action tremor) and non-motor (short-term memory) deficits via scheduled activity tasks and of PROs via periodic surveys. The sub-study and planned analyses are described in the SURE-PD3 protocol.  3. Readiness of both cohorts to transition to a virtual extension study and centralized coordination Both cohorts are prepared to efficiently transition to long term remote participant’s ascertainment and have necessary ethical and logistical provisions in place: 1) both studies have a consent clause asking for permission to be contact[CONTACT_5646], which may be obtained by a centralized coordination center; 2) both studies have agreed with the NINDS to use DMR to upload clinical datasets: 3) both studies are currently putting provisions in place to generate global unique identifiers (GUID) to link participants in study datasets; 4) both studies have met with all involved stakeholders to create a flow diagram and timeline for data and sample transfers; 5) both studies are conducted under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_292708] (PSG) and as such function under common PSG by-laws ensuring uniform governance and publication policy; and 6) both studies use the CTCC data coordination center, streamlining the current database development and transition plan. CTCC will be responsible for the project and data management of AT-HOME PD.     a. Readiness to recruit a new sub-study cohort  The study team is well-positioned to efficiently recruit participants from  SUPER-PD, which has the following necessary ethical and logistical provisions in place: 1) the study has a consent clause asking for permission to be contact[CONTACT_5646]; 2) the study currently generates global unique identifiers (GUID) to link participants in study datasets; 3) the study team is currently working on creating a flow diagram and timeline for data and sample transfers; and 4) the study uses the same data management system as AHPD (REDCap), streamlining new database development and transition planning. CTCC will be responsible for the project and data management of the AHPD – SUPER-PD Tele-visit Validation sub-study.     2. STUDY OBJECTIVE   2.1 Specific Aims:

Transition from site-based to a centralized site and coordination center to manage all participant activity in virtual extensions of STEADY-PD III and SURE-PD3, with projected enrollment of ≥70% of final trial cohorts, and core data collection in accordance with Parkinson’s Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP) schedule of activities. b. Conduct an annual research visit (tele-visit) program and establish the feasibility and cross-sectional reliability of tele-visit versus in-person visit assessments in a subset of SURE-PD3 and SUPER-PD participants. c. Deploy a smartphone application, based on the mPower study, for remote data collection in a clinical trial cohort as preliminarily characterized in the Smart4SURE sub-study of SURE-PD3. d. Establish a mechanism for linking STEADY-PD III and SURE-PD3 study data with study data collected through smartphone-based assessments, tele-visits, and Fox Insight (FI), a separate longitudinal patient-reported outcomes (PROs) online research study. 2.

Correlating the smartphone and tele-visit platforms’ component and composite features, and their changes over years. b. Comparing the smartphone and tele-visit platforms’ abilities to: i) measure PD progression and predict clinical events and changes in PROs; ii) distinguish rapid vs slow progressors based on baseline Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) scores, dopamine transporter (DAT) deficit (in SURE PD-3) or serum urate levels (in STEADY-PD III); iii) demonstrate persistence of any effects of isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_292698]. c.

The data collected over 2 years of serial (annual) tele-visits and (quarterly clusters of) smartphone assessments of the combined cohort will be characterized and compared to gauge their clinicometric properties and relative potential for monitoring clinical progression in future PD studies. Lastly, data collected passively (with participant permission) from the smartphone sensors will be explored as a novel strategy for mobility and socialization correlates of PD progression.

The first tele-visit will occur shortly after screening and then annually for two subsequent visits. Each visit will include a series of PROs, which will be completed by [CONTACT_215117], a cognitive test (MoCA), and clinician-conducted assessments including a modified MDS-UPDRS part 3, SEADL and CGI; see SOA.  • FI web-based survey platform – AT-HOME PD participants will be asked to complete a set of standard questionnaires every 3 months through a companion study called Fox Insight (FI). This online observational study, sponsored by [CONTACT_292759] J. Fox Foundation (MJFF), seeks to better understand experiences of daily living (EDL) in PD and how they change with disease progression. Over 22,[ADDRESS_357100] enrolled to complete web-based surveys (on a quarterly basis for up to 5 years) (https://foxinsight.michaeljfox.org).  The PRO data collected via FI are largely complementary and more extensive than those collected through the smartphone and tele-visit components, allowing for a comparison of motor and cognitive tasks. The modest overlap between a few surveys (e.g., MDS-UPDRS part 2 on EDL) is by [CONTACT_292760]-of-art web-based PRO data collection by [CONTACT_292761] (with respect to completion rates, variability and predictive power) by [CONTACT_292762], even if provided remotely via tele-visits. FI data, linked to a participant’s GUID, will be made available to the research team as well as PDBP and the broader research community through FI’s data repository (LONI). • Smartphone platform (mPower-based app) – The mPower application captures sensor data within the context of self-administered activity tasks (motor and cognitive). Processed sensor data is converted into multiple features that are evaluated individually and in aggregate as digital biomarkers for disease severity. Building on experience gained in the mPower and Smart4SURE studies, a new application will be deployed to assess motor and cognitive functions sensitive to PD progression (see SOA; Table 2). The mPower 2.0 app is compatible with Android as well as iPhone devices, and has been modified to allow passive collection of gait and mobility data with participant permission (for SA3). The application will include a defined set of tasks; described below under Study Procedures. As per the SOA, participants will be asked to complete a four to six-minute battery of motor tasks daily for at least [ADDRESS_357101] 10 daily activities and can be extended by 5 days if this minimum is not met.  3.1.1 Sub-Study Overview Individuals with PD from SUPER-PD will complete a single tele-visit within ±14 days of their SUPER-PD baseline or month 12 in-person study visit.  3.2 Discussion of Study Design      a. Rationale for Study

AHPD PROTOCOL_V3; Version date: 11/06/2019   Page 38 | [ADDRESS_357102], reduce participant burden, and allow for the collection of data beyond the usual epi[INVESTIGATOR_49564], in-clinic assessments. Demonstrating the utility of these relatively inexpensive accessible platforms for the measurement of PD progression would also establish the infrastructure for long-term follow up of participants after completion of interventional studies.   Long-term observation of participants from STEADY-PD III and SURE-PD3, together comprising ~600 early PD participants, would be invaluable not only in characterizing any persistent or delayed benefits of either treatment but also in the development of tele-health outcomes to facilitate future interventional trials in PD and of neurotherapeutics more broadly.   The objective of this study is to leverage modern technology to develop, pi[INVESTIGATOR_292699] a 100% virtual model for long-term follow up utilizing telemedicine and smartphone platforms for quantitative monitoring of clinician- and patient-reported outcomes (PROs).   The objective of the sub-study is to improve our estimates of the accuracy of tele-visit assessments relative to in-clinic assessments.      4. STUDY POPULATION      4.1 Participant Numbers     4.1.1 AT-HOME PD Participants  Approximately 420  All individuals with early idiopathic PD enrolled in the STEADY-PD III ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and SURE-PD3 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) studies (N≈600) who have consented to be contact[CONTACT_292763]. We expect approximately 70% of them (N≈420) to consent and participate in at least the tele-visit portion of the study. We expect approximately 80% of enrolled individuals (N≈340) to participate in the smartphone portion (and thus the smartphone vs tele-visit comparison) of the study. We expect approximately 70% of participants in the smartphone portion (N≈240) to consent to passive data collection (and thus contribute to Aim 3). We expect approximately 80% of enrolled individuals (N≈340) to participate in the FI portion of the study.  4.1.2 AHPD – SUPER-PD Tele-visit Validation Sub-study Participants

Only individuals currently enrolled in the SUPER-PD study will be eligible for participation in the sub-study.  Because of the nature of the study, an internet-enabled device with web-camera capacity or compatibility is necessary to participate. Participants without a camera will be provided with a suitable external camera.

STUDY PROCEDURES     5.1 Recruitment  Cohort Recruitment and Retention (SA1)  The study will recruit solely from STEADY-PD III and SURE-PD3. The sub-study will recruit solely from SUPER-PD.  All STEADY-PD III and SURE-PD3 participants who have consented to be contact[CONTACT_292765] (UR) for future research or independently contacts the UR will have their personal contact [CONTACT_3031], study-specific unique identifier, CTCC unique identifier, and GUID (where available) entered into a secure HIPAA-compliant database at the UR. These individuals will be contact[CONTACT_292766]-HOME PD study team member during or following their completion of the parent study. The AT-HOME PD study team member will provide an overview of the study, assess interest, and pre-screen for eligibility. Participants who have not already created a GUID will be required to create a GUID for this study.  Recruitment for the sub-study will occur either via telephone or during a SUPER-PD study visit by [CONTACT_292767]-HOME PD study team member.  AT-HOME PD study participants from STEADY-PD III cohort: A majority of STEADY-PD III participants (who consent to being contact[CONTACT_292768]) will have already completed their STEADY-PD III participation when this study commences and will be approached post-study completion. The remainder will be contact[CONTACT_292769].   AT-HOME PD study participants from SURE-PD3 cohort: All SURE-PD3 participants will be contact[CONTACT_292770]-PD3 visit in the planned treatment period.  AHPD – SUPER-PD Tele-visit Validation sub-study participants from SUPER-PD: SUPER-PD participants with PD (who consented to being contact[CONTACT_292768]) will be contact[CONTACT_292771]-PD study.  We have developed a proactive plan for recruitment and retention, relying on our experience with the parent studies. The STEADY-PD III and SURE-PD3 parent studies have had excellent retention, with both having enrolled ahead of schedule. We expect recruitment will be facilitated by [CONTACT_292772]-HOME PD study to which these parent study participants are uniquely able to contribute. We project that approximately 420 participants, or 70% of the original parent cohorts, will enroll in AT-HOME PD. We expect that essentially everyone will have access to an internet-enabled device that will support participation in tele-visits. According to the Pew Research Center, 88% of adults use the internet, including 87% of those aged 50-64 (http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheet/internet-broadband/) and 77% of adults own a smartphone, including 74% of those aged 50-64 
   Protocol Title: AT-HOME PD [Assessing Tele-Health Outcomes in Multiyear Extensions of PD trials]  
AHPD PROTOCOL_V3; Version date: 11/06/2019   Page 41 | 103 (http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheet/mobile/).  Moreover, the study procedures were reviewed by [CONTACT_292773].  In addition, although the pre-specified recruitment pool provides minimal opportunity to enhance racial and ethnic diversity of the study, we intend to maximize the proportion of minority participants who enroll by [CONTACT_292774]-PD III or SURE-PD3 who is interested and otherwise eligible to enroll but does not have the requisite technical resources. For these participants the costs of standard internet access and/or a smartphone/data plan (above the reimbursement payment) would be reimbursed. We anticipate enrolling a relatively high proportion of women given their enrichment in SURE-PD3 (due to a screening process that targets people with lower serum urate, and given women, on average, have a substantially lower serum urate than men).  If AT-HOME PD study participants will be considered for any future follow up research their contact [CONTACT_292775] (UR) secure HIPAA compliant database based on original consent. If the subject declined contact [CONTACT_292776], the subject will be allowed to contact [CONTACT_292777].  Considering the low participant burden of remote data collection, an inherent advantage of the outcome measures under investigation, we anticipate a modest dropout rate of ~15% from the tele-visit component over the two-year extension study. In addition, recruitment and retention will be motivated by [CONTACT_292778] (to be paid in three installments following each tele-visit via check) to regular communication with participants. Formative research through patient interviews indicates that long-term data collection in a remote setting will only be sustainable with a smartphone application that is specifically designed to meet the needs and interests of the participant population. Based on initial interviews, engagement strategies will focus on altruism, self-exploration, education, and community. These are implemented through the application using news feeds, infographics, participation dashboards, and notifications. Importantly, participants will be provided with the option to view the outcomes of their assessments in a manner that was highly effective at promoting engagement within mPower but was not feasible during the smartphone sub-study (Smart4SURE) of SURE-PD3.  5.[ADDRESS_357104] (RSRB) and the Office of Research and Project

As part of the eConsent document, potential participants will be provided with the contact [CONTACT_19297] a study team member in the event that they have study-related questions. If there is no response to the emailed eConsent link, the participant will be sent follow-up reminder(s).  In order to ensure that passive data collection does not have a major negative impact on overall enrollment, participants will be asked to opt into passive data collection as an optional sub-study in the mPower application.    The participant’s screening visit will be scheduled during their prescreen phone call with an AT-HOME PD team member. If requested during the initial contact, an AHPD study team member will email the current UR IRB approved informed consent form to the participant and schedule a follow-up phone call to complete the prescreening visit and/or schedule the participant’s screening visit.  At the screening visit, via video conference (VC), which is described in detail below, a study team member trained in human participant’s protection in accordance with UR IRB procedures will verify that the participant understands why the study is being done, what will happen during the study, possible risks and benefits, how personal information will be protected, and what to do if there is a problem or question. The study team will ensure that prospective participants have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the details of the study to allow them to make an informed decision whether or not to participate. Prospective participants will be provided with an opportunity to ask questions.  The study team member will verify the identity of the participant (via photo ID or by [CONTACT_292779]) and electronically record in REDCap that informed consent has been confirmed.   5.3 Schedule of Activities   See Schedule of Activities (SOA) for AT-HOME PD study and sub-study activities.     5.4 Participant Identification Numbers (ID) Number    For all prospective participants with whom the study team has been able to establish contact, the study team will create a new record in REDCap assigning the potential participant a prescreening unique participant identifier. This record will be used to complete the pre-screening process and eConsent process. If the participant appears eligible on the basis of pre-screening questions and provides eConsent, the study team will create a new record in REDCap assigning the potential participant their Global Unique Identifier (GUID) as their unique ID.    Within REDCap, the participant’s contact [CONTACT_292780]-visits. This contact [CONTACT_292781]: AT-HOME PD [Assessing Tele-Health Outcomes in Multiyear Extensions of PD trials]

Global Unique Identifier (GUID)  Participants may have already been assigned a Global Unique Identifier (GUID) as part of their participation in STEADY-PD III or SURE-PD3. For those participants who have not already created a GUID, a study team member will create a GUID for them.  Sub-study participants will have already been assigned a GUID as part of their participation in SUPER-PD.  The GUID is a universal participant ID that enables researchers to share and track participant data across multiple studies without exposing any personally identifiable information. The GUID Tool uses multiple pi[INVESTIGATOR_292711] (first name [CONTACT_133113], presence of middle name, middle name, last name [CONTACT_133113], data of birth, city of birth, country of birth, and sex at birth) to generate a unique 10 (14 if created manually)-character ID.  5.5 Study Visits a. Pre-Screening Call The Pre-Screening Call will be conducted via telephone by [CONTACT_292767]-HOME PD team member.  For SURE-PD3 participants it should generally occur within approximately 90 days after the participant’s last SURE-PD3 visit in the planned treatment period.  It is expected to take approximately 10-15 minutes to complete.  The following activities will be completed: x Overview of the study and assessment of interest  If the individual is interested in participating:  x Pre-screen questionnaire for eligibility x eConsent (link to REDCap emailed) x Technology survey (automatically follows eConsent in REDCap) b. Screening Visit (within 30 days following eConsent) The Screening Visit will be conducted remotely using a web-based video platform (VC). For SURE-PD3 participants it should occur after the final SURE-PD3 visit in the planned treatment period. It is expected to take approximately 30 minutes to complete.  The following activities will be completed:  x Verify consent (see 5.2 Process of Consent) x Verify participant’s identity (photo ID or answering verification questions) x Verify eligibility (see below) x Demographics x Test connection x Creation of FI Account (see below) x Creation of GUID (if not already created)

All of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria must be met unless a study PI [INVESTIGATOR_292712] a waiver for certain criteria. More detail regarding this process and instructions for the requirements for waivers can be found in the Operations Manual.   Eligibility Identification: The study team member will verify the participant’s identity at the time of eConsenting.  The study participant will be asked to verify their identity by [CONTACT_292782]. The identity verification will be done by [CONTACT_292783]-visit and this information will not be collected. If a photo ID is not available, every effort will be made to verify the participant’s identify by [CONTACT_292784]: i. ask the participant to repeat their name [CONTACT_245281]. ask the participant to state their year of birth iii. ask the participant to provide their address of record  If for any unforeseen reason the study team member is unable to verify the identity of the participant by [CONTACT_292785], the study team member will document the reason and continue with completing the eConsenting process and enrolling the eligible participant in to the study. This will ensure that the study is able to meet the recruitment numbers (from a limited patient population), as well as ensure that the study is able to enroll all - otherwise eligible - participants. FI Account Creation:  A study team member will create a FI account for the participant using email address and GUID. If the participant is already enrolled in FI, the participant will receive an email notifying them that their FI profile has been linked to the AT-HOME PD study. If the participant is not already enrolled in FI, he/she will receive an email from FI with instructions regarding how to verify their new account.  Once this has been done, the participant will be prompted to complete the registration and consent process for FI.   SimplyBook.me Orientation: A study team member will introduce the participant to the SimplyBook.me HIPAA-compliant scheduling software, which will be used to schedule tele-visits and send tele-visit reminders. The participant will be asked to choose whether they would like to schedule tele-visits in the morning or afternoon and all tele-visits will be scheduled according to their preference. Follow-up tele-visits will preferentially be scheduled with the same provider, unless that is logistically impossible (due to staffing schedules or the like). In order to reduce variability related to diurnal fluctuation, participants should select the same time window (morning or afternoon) for performance of smartphone tasks.

This will create a mPower account for the participants in the Sage Bionetworks Bridge service. During the baseline tele-visit the study team member will help the participants to download and install the application. After installation, the study team member will review proper performance of each task and direct the participant towards helpful resources in the event that they have any further questions about the tasks. A study team member will remotely supervise the participant while he/she completes a complete set of smartphone tasks. d. Smartphone Sessions (Baseline, Month 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24) x 14-day smartphone sessions will occur on a quarterly basis. x Given diurnal variation in active task performance, participants will be asked to select morning or afternoon as their preferred window for completion and to consistently attempt to complete the active tasks according to their selected preference. x Participants will be notified one day before the start of each 14-day session  During these 14-day sessions, participants will be asked to complete daily [ADDRESS_357108] 10 daily activity sets they can optionally continue for up to 5 additional days.

Premature Withdrawal Visit  Premature withdrawal will be defined as withdrawal from the tele-visit component (or the full study) prior to completion of the month [ADDRESS_357110] the right to withdraw from the study, or any individual component of the study, at any time without prejudice. Although not anticipated, an investigator may withdraw a participant from the study if participation places the participant at undue risk or if the participant dies or experiences another reportable event that precludes further study participation. In all other circumstances, all participants should be retained in the study regardless of compliance to limit bias from informative drop-out.  In the event of premature withdrawal from the study, the Premature Withdrawal (PW) Visit procedures and evaluations should be completed whenever possible whether or not the withdrawal is determined at a regularly scheduled study visit or at an unscheduled visit.  Reasons for withdrawal of the participant prior to completion of the study must be stated in the eCRF for all study participants who were enrolled in the study.  The premature withdrawal tele-visit is expected to take approximately 60 minutes to complete.

Following completion of the visit, participants will be emailed a direct link to REDCap to complete this survey.  g. Passive Data Collection For participants that optionally consent to passive data collection, the smartphone application will collect multiple streams of passive data: movement patterns captured by [CONTACT_292787] (including GPS) and motor activity patterns captured by [CONTACT_292788]. To reduce issues relating to patient privacy concerns, movement patterns will be collected using displacement vectors without storing actual GPS coordinates. To reduce burden relating to use of data plans for data transfer, the application will transfer data on a daily basis and preferably using a Wi-Fi connection. In order to ensure that monitoring is naturalistic, participants will not be given any instructions regarding how or when to carry their smartphone. 5.5.1 Sub-study Study Visits a. Pre-Screen  The Pre-Screen will be conducted via telephone or during a potential participant’s SUPER-PD study visit by [CONTACT_292767]-HOME PD team member. It is expected to take approximately 10-15 minutes to complete.  The following activities will be completed: x Overview of the study and assessment of interest  If the individual is interested in participating:  x Pre-screen questionnaire for eligibility x eConsent (link to REDCap emailed)  b. Tele-Visit (within 14 days of SUPER-PD baseline or month 12 study visit) ¾ The tele-visit will be conducted remotely using a web-based video platform and is expected to take approximately 30 minutes to complete. 
   Protocol Title: AT-HOME PD [Assessing Tele-Health Outcomes in Multiyear Extensions of PD trials]  
AHPD PROTOCOL_V3; Version date: 11/06/2019   Page 50 | 103 ¾ For participants on symptomatic dopaminergic therapy, the Movement Disorder Society – Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part [ADDRESS_357111] dopaminergic medication intake will be recorded.   The following assessments will be completed during the tele-visit: x Verify eligibility and eConsent  x MDS-UPDRS part 3  x Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) x Reportable Events   6. ASSESSMENTS      6.1 Primary Assessments  a. Pre-Screening Questionnaire  The pre-screening questionnaire includes questions regarding access to an internet-enabled device that will support participation in tele-visits, possession of a web-camera, and possession of a suitable smartphone.  b. Technology Survey    Survey questions were originally adapted from the Pew Internet & American Life Project Question database. The survey includes questions regarding access and use of specific technology and prior experience with tele-visits.    c. Movement Disorders Society Unified PD Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) The MDS-UPDRS will be conducted per the Schedule of Activities. The MDS-UPDRS was designed by [CONTACT_292789] (e.g., by [CONTACT_292790]) while preserving its overall format. The MDS-UPDRS has four parts: x Part I (non-motor experiences of daily living), comprising  Part Ia concerning behaviors that are assessed by [CONTACT_292791]  Part Ib that is completed by [CONTACT_292792], but independently of the Investigator. x Part II (motor experiences of daily living), designed to be a self-administered questionnaire like Part Ib, but similarly can be reviewed by [CONTACT_292793]. 
   Protocol Title: AT-HOME PD [Assessing Tele-Health Outcomes in Multiyear Extensions of PD trials]  
AHPD PROTOCOL_V3; Version date: 11/06/2019   Page 51 | 103 x Part III (motor examination) has instructions for the rater to give or demonstrate to the patient; it is completed by [CONTACT_292794]. Given the remote nature of our evaluations, we will administer a modified version of part III that does not include assessment of rigidity or postural instability. x Part IV (motor complications) with instructions for the rater and also instructions to be read to the patient. This part integrates patient-derived information with the rater's clinical observations and judgments and is completed by [CONTACT_29975]. Complete Part IV only if ST has been initiated.  Participants will self-administer Parts Ib and II, through completion of REDCap surveys, but the study team member will review responses for completion and ask the participant to complete it during the tele-visit if incomplete. Use of MDS-UPDRS is responsive to core instrument recommendations for the Quality of Life subdomain of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Common Data Elements (CDEs) for PD, and to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance encouraging use of PROs as a substantial portion of the responses are patient-reported.  The investigators are neurologists or board-certified nurse practitioners who have received formal MDS-UPDRS certification (by [CONTACT_292795]) and will have additionally undergone joint training to reconcile scoring differences and minimize inter-rater variability. Ideally, the same Site Investigator should assess all participants on parts Ia, III, and IV (when applicable) of the MDS-UPDRS at all study visits.  D. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) In early PD, when cognitive deficits occur, they are subtle and mild, and the participants usually perform in the normal range of the widely used Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE). The MoCA is a rapid screening instrument like the MMSE but was developed to be more sensitive to patients presenting mild cognitive complaints. It is designated an NINDS CDE for PD. The MoCA assesses short-term and working memory, visual-spatial abilities, executive function, attention, concentration, language and orientation. As completion of the MoCA requires performance of some tasks on paper, the participant will be sent a copy of the relevant portions of the MoCA (trail-making, cube copying) prior to the tele-visit. Ideally, this will be sent in a sealed envelope and the participant will be asked to open the envelope only during their tele-visit.  However, it may alternatively be sent via email with instructions to print immediately prior to the tele-visit. During the tele-visit, the participant will be instructed on how to complete these tasks and will be asked to display their responses such that they can be visualized and evaluated by [CONTACT_118734]. The total score ranges from 0 to 30 (highest function).  
   Protocol Title: AT-HOME PD [Assessing Tele-Health Outcomes in Multiyear Extensions of PD trials]  
AHPD PROTOCOL_V3; Version date: 11/06/2019   Page 52 | 103 E. Modified Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living Scale (SEADL) The SEADL is an Investigator and participant assessment of the participant’s level of independence. The participant will be scored on a percentage scale reflective of his/her ability to perform acts of daily living. Printed scores with associated descriptors range from 100% to 0% in increments of 10%, where 100% is “participant has full ability and is completely independent; essentially normal” and 0% is “vegetative functions such as swallowing, bladder and bowel functions are not functioning; bedridden”. Scores should be coded in increments of 10, (i.e. 090, 080, 070). This assessment will be completed jointly by [CONTACT_292796].  F. Clinical Global Impression and Patient Global Impression Scales (CGI) The CGI is an observer-rated scale that measures illness severity (CGIS) and global improvement of change (CGIC). Each component of the CGI is rated separately; the instrument does not yield a global score.  The CGIS is rated on a 7-point scale, with the severity of illness scale using a range of responses from 1 (normal) through to 7 (amongst the most severely ill patients). CGIC scores range from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Similarly, the PGI is a patient-rated scale that measures illness severity (PGIS) and global improvement of change (PGIC).    g. Falls Assessment Falls will be assessed using two questionnaires, which have been incorporated into an on-going large prospective study (PPMI). The self-reported falls assessment is a 1-item questionnaire that will be completed by [CONTACT_2299]. The determination of falls assessment, which will be completed by [CONTACT_093], includes questions about freezing of gait and falls over two time periods (the past week and the past 12 months).  6.2 Smartphone Assessments  The following motor activities will be completed by [CONTACT_2299]: ● Gait Task - A 30 second walking task where the participant will walk with their phone in their pocket to measure gait using the phone accelerometer and gyroscope.  ● Finger Tappi[INVESTIGATOR_292713] - A 30 second speeded tappi[INVESTIGATOR_292714].  ● Resting Tremor Task - A 30 second task in each hand where the participants hold the phone with their hand in their lap while the phone records accelerometer and gyroscope readings. 
   Protocol Title: AT-HOME PD [Assessing Tele-Health Outcomes in Multiyear Extensions of PD trials]  
AHPD PROTOCOL_V3; Version date: 11/06/2019   Page 53 | 103 ● Balance task - A standing task where the participant tries to stand still while the phone measures accelerometer and gyroscope readings.  The participant will be asked to complete cognitive tasks, which may include the following:  x Digit Span - A short term memory test in which the participant reports back a series of numbers that were displayed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_292715]. x Digit Symbol Substitution Tests - A neuropsychological test sensitive to brain damage, dementia, age and depression. It consists of (e.g. nine) digit-symbol pairs followed by a list of digits. Under each digit the subject should write down the corresponding symbol as fast as possible. x Spatial Working Memory - A neuropsychological test that tests memory and manipulation visuospatial information.  6.3 Fox Insight (FI) Assessments  FI is a separate online research study with a separate consent process. As such, the assessments will not be described in detail. The following validated assessments are included in FI:    The Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire, short-form 8 item version (PDQ-8)  MDS-UPDRS part 2   Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE)  Your Cognition and Daily Activities (PDAQ-15)  Euroqol Five (EQ-5D)   Non-motor symptoms questionnaire (NMS-QUEST)  Geriatric Depression Scale, short form (GDS)  Parkinson’s disease-Patient Reported Outcomes of Problems (PD-PROP) The complete list of assessments can be found in the SOA. Participants are also invited to complete additional PRO surveys about, but not limited to, symptoms, disease progression, quality of life, patient preference and general health. 6.4 Safety Assessments (see Section 9 Reportable Events)    As this is a minimal risk observational study that does not involve a drug or device intervention, adverse events are not anticipated and will not be assessed. Safety assessments will be limited to the collection of reportable events either spontaneously offered by [CONTACT_292797] a study team member during a tele-visit.     6.5 Assessment of Participant Compliance  At each tele-visit, the Investigator and/or study team member will assess the participant’s compliance with the study requirements. This 
   Protocol Title: AT-HOME PD [Assessing Tele-Health Outcomes in Multiyear Extensions of PD trials]  
AHPD PROTOCOL_V3; Version date: 11/06/2019   Page 54 | 103 will include checks of protocol compliance, including completion of surveys for tele-visits, smartphone tasks (where applicable), and FI survey completion (where applicable). More detail regarding the monitoring of compliance can be found in Section 5.5.  While we will strive to retain all participants, we will consider successful participants to be those who complete at least six of nine smartphone-based test batteries over [ADDRESS_357112] to pay for research procedures.  8. PAYMENT FOR PARTICIPATION  Participants will be compensated $50 for each tele-visit completed, as applicable (baseline, month 12 and month 24) for a total of up to $[ADDRESS_357113] internet access and/or a smartphone/data plan (above the compensation amount) will be reimbursed for minority participants currently enrolled in STEADY-PD III or SURE-PD3 who are interested and otherwise eligible to enroll but do not have the requisite technical resources.   9. RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  9.[ADDRESS_357114] used to evaluate the memory or thinking: it is meant to be challenging. x During the tele-visits the study team will watch the participant walk, and there is a possibility that they could fall.  x Another risk is breach of confidentiality if someone were to access the study information without authorization. Because this study involves collecting personal, identifiable information, there is a potential for invasion of privacy or breach in confidentiality. Accidental release of information to the public may occur due to

Smartphone Application There are a few additional risks to participating in the smartphone assessments: x Other people may glimpse the study notifications and/or reminders on the smartphone and may become privy to the information that the participant is enrolled in this study. This can make some people feel self-conscious. x There is a potential for invasion of privacy or breach of confidentiality. The data collected through the  mPower app will be encrypted on the smartphone, transferred electronically and stored securely in Synapse. Sage team will separate the participant account information (name, email, contact [CONTACT_3031], etc.) from the study. x Sage will not access the personal contacts, other apps, text or email message content, or websites visited.   9.[ADDRESS_357115] at any time. Participants can take breaks as needed.   x If they typi[INVESTIGATOR_292716] (such as a cane or walker) or with the help of a caregiver, they will only be asked to walk under their usual conditions. Participants will not be asked to try to walk if they typi[INVESTIGATOR_292717] a wheelchair or if they or the investigator has concerns about the risk of falling. If a participant does fall during the visit, or have another medical event during the tele-visit that requires emergent evaluation, the study investigator or a team member will assist in contact[CONTACT_292798]. x Every effort will be made to maintain confidentiality and protect personal information obtained as a result of this study. x Study team will assign a GUID number instead of labeling the information collected from the participant with their name (or medical record number). Study team will use GUID instead of the name [CONTACT_292827]. Information about the GUID number will be kept in a secure system. Only the study investigators and some technical staff for AHPD, STEADY-PD III or SURE-PD3 studies and some FI clinical operations staff will have the key to link the coded study data to the participant name [CONTACT_292828].  x Study will use a HIPAA compliant, secure video-conferencing system for the tele-visits. Note: real time video conferencing will be used to complete the assessments which will not be recorded. x The software that will be used for the surveys and to store the information from the tele-visits has been specifically designed to protect the privacy of research subjects and access to the database is restricted.

Benefits may include contributing to the future research advances and experiencing new ways of tracking and measuring the disease.  9.4 Alternatives to Participation If the participant elects not to participate in the study, there are no alternatives available.  10. CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  10.1 Required Therapy  There is no restriction on medications in this study. All concomitant medications will be recorded.  11. PARTICIPANT WITHDRAWALS/DROPOUTS   Participants will be advised in the written informed consent forms that they have the right to withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice and may be withdrawn at the Investigator’s or sponsor’s discretion at any time.  Premature withdrawal will be defined as withdrawal from the tele-visit component (or the full study) prior to completion of the month [ADDRESS_357117] attempts may include phone calls, emails, and physical mail. Such efforts should be documented in the source documents. A participant may withdraw or be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:  • Administrative  1. Withdrawal of consent 2. Participant deemed lost to follow-up 3. Premature withdrawal of study

Other reportable event that precludes further study participation  Participant premature withdrawal should be reported to the CTCC Project Manager within 5 business days of site’s knowledge of the event. The Demographic form must be completed for all study participants who provide informed consent. This includes participants who completed the study or withdrew/were withdrawn from the study or were screened and provided consent but did not start the study.   The Conclusion of Study Participation form should be completed for all participants who have been enrolled. If a participant withdraws due to a reportable event, the site must ensure that the event is captured on the reportable event form.  12. REPORTABLE EVENTS   Based on the nature of the study, routine adverse events will not be collected. In this study, the following pre-specified events that are thought to be relevant to the safety and feasibility of the study population will be considered Reportable Events (RE). REs will be assessed at the tele-visits and reported on the RE log within 72 hours of the event, or the CHeT Site Investigator’s knowledge of the event.  x Compromise of confidentiality x Loss of competence to consent x Withdrawal from the study x Severe depression and suicidal ideation x Suicide attempt x Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_292718] (non-elective) medical issues (including childbirth) x Any psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] x Participant intends to or has participated in another research study involving experimental interventions x Any neurologic event (e.g., TBI, Seizure, etc.) x Identification of a safety concern warranting referral for medical evaluation x Identification of a safety concern warranting referral for psychiatric evaluation x Death  Although not a reportable event the enactment of the Medical Safety Escalation Plan should be reported to the CTCC PM  Enactment of the Medical Safety Escalation Plan (see section 9.2)

The purpose of the Medical Safety Escalation Plan is to responsibly manage complex or acutely escalating medical issues that may arise during a tele-visit to ensure participant safety.  13. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  Planned analyses are summarized here. Additional details will be included in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). In the event of a conflict between the protocol and the SAP, the SAP will take precedence. 13.1 Data Processing and Quality Control (QC) for Smartphone (SP) Based Measures: Data QC and cleaning: As data from the SP are deposited on a daily basis into Synapse, we will have a clear measure of compliance and engagement.  Additionally, data streams can be monitored for quality. Data scientists and statisticians at Sage Bionetworks have developed an extensive pi[INVESTIGATOR_292719] (e.g., https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/mpowertools). These tools will be adopted and expanded to monitor and QC passive data streams. During the development stage of the application we will run small scale internal experiments where user use Android and iOS devices concurrently to establish bounds on differences between devices. Data processing/feature extraction: Quality processed data will be summarized into features using extensions of our feature extraction pi[INVESTIGATOR_292720]. These include but are not limited to time and frequency domain statistics, energy and entropy of frequency spectrum from the tri-axial accelerometer, along with absolute displacement measurements. For displacement information (Aim 3b) data will be summarized into variables such as furthest distance traveled, frequency of trips, average daily distance etc. Also, additional specific features will be selected based on previously published 
   Protocol Title: AT-HOME PD [Assessing Tele-Health Outcomes in Multiyear Extensions of PD trials]  
AHPD PROTOCOL_V3; Version date: 11/06/2019   Page 59 | [ADDRESS_357119] reliability across time. Data analysis will be performed as described in SA 3.B and 3.C below.  13.2 Statistical Analysis Plan  Aim 1: To evaluate concordance between in-clinic and tele-visit MDS-UPDRS assessments (Aim 1b), we will use results from the REACT-PD study to calibrate tele-visit assessments to in-clinic MDS-UPDRS scores, matching means and standard deviations cross-sectionally. We will use Lin's concordance correlation coefficient, rc, to summarize accuracy of the calibrated tele-visit estimates vs. scores collected from in-person SURE-PD3 and SUPER-PD visits conducted close in time, accepting tele-visit estimates as sufficiently accurate if rc > 0.8. If we observe insufficient concordance, we will investigate contributions of bias, scale difference, and imprecision and re-calibrate using all available data from both REACT-PD and the current study. Aim 2: We will assess the calibration and correlation between tele-visit (TV) and SP metrics both cross-sectionally and longitudinally (Aim 2a). We will generate SP-derived metrics that best match composite scores of motor function (MDS-UPDRS part 3), non-motor function (MoCA total score), subjective function (including global impression (CGI) scores, Schwab and England ADL scores, MDS-UPDRS parts 1b and 2 scores, and estimates of MDS-UPDRS part 1-3 total scores. We will randomly split our sample 2:[ADDRESS_357120] the accuracy of calibrated SP measures in the reserved validation sample using Lin's concordance correlation coefficient, rc. If we observe insufficient concordance, we will investigate contributions of bias, scale difference, and imprecision and re-calibrate using all available data from both the calibration and validation samples.  We will compare TV vs. calibrated SP measures of disease progression generally, as predictors of future clinical events and changes in patient reported outcomes, and between specific subsets of participants expected to progress at different rates (Aim 2b) due to biology or treatment. After calibration, we will estimate the standard error for a treatment-group comparison from a two-arm trial using measure-specific variance components from a bivariate random-slopes linear mixed model for each pair of TV and SP measures and assuming an assessment schedule appropriate for each measure, e.g., annual for TV measures and quarterly for SP measures. Preferred measures would have smaller standard errors, and specifically, the ratio of squared standard errors provides an estimate of the relative sample size required. We will use the same approach to identify measures that are significantly more sensitive to biological 
   Protocol Title: AT-HOME PD [Assessing Tele-Health Outcomes in Multiyear Extensions of PD trials]  
AHPD PROTOCOL_V3; Version date: 11/06/2019   Page 60 | 103 subgroups (e.g., among participants stratified by [CONTACT_292799]-UPDRS progression over the first 2 years of in-clinic follow-up in the parent trials) or treatment-based subgroups (e.g., participants randomized to Isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_292701]). To compare TV assessments and SP measures with respect to their accuracy in predicting future clinical events and changes in patient reported outcomes, we will use the same 2:1 training: validation split and train separate models using TV and SP metrics collected over the first year of follow-up to predict clinical events and changes in PROs over the second year of follow-up. Clinical events will include droppi[INVESTIGATOR_61217] 80% on the modified Schwab and England ADL and experiencing a fall. PROs of interest will include summary scores from the PDQ-8, EQ-5D, and PDAQ-[ADDRESS_357121] logistic regression with participant-specific and participant x form random effects (Aim 2c). Concordance between PROs assessed during TVs vs. those obtained online via FI will be estimated using Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (Aim 2c). Aim 3:  We will evaluate the feasibility to collect and use passive data to track disease progression.  Passive data collection will come in two flavors - displacement tracking that captures a participant’s life space, i.e. their mobility patterns and collection of accelerometer and gyroscope readings when the participants are walking throughout the day. The walking data will be analyzed exactly the same as the actively collected data as described in Aim 2. The displacement tracking requires more care and will require us to first determine feasibility of data collection (Aim 3a) and extensive norming before assessing ability to track progression (Aim 3b).  Evaluation of Data Collection: The first component of this Aim will focus on evaluating the feasibility of collecting passive data from individuals over a 2- year time period. This includes addressing two potential barriers to data collection: (1) Participant willingness to provide permission for passive monitoring and (2) the ability to collect passive data continuously over a 2-year period despi[INVESTIGATOR_292721]. Hypothesis: 70% of AT-HOME PD participants who participate in the smartphone component will consent to collection of passive data. 
   Protocol Title: AT-HOME PD [Assessing Tele-Health Outcomes in Multiyear Extensions of PD trials]  
AHPD PROTOCOL_V3; Version date: 11/06/2019   Page 61 | 103  This will be evaluated by [CONTACT_292800]-study.  Hypothesis: Passive data will be collected in a persistent manner for the full 2-year study in at least 75% of consented individuals. Data collection will be monitored on a continuous basis.  We will evaluate the ability to use passive motor measures to predict relative changes in disease severity within a participant. Due to the highly individualized nature of activity patterns, it is unknown whether passive data can be used to derive absolute measures of disease severity. However, we expect that relative changes in activity patterns over time will provide a mechanism to track disease progression on an individualized basis.  Features from displacement data such as total daily movement, number of daily trips, etc. will be generated and normed per individual before evaluation of disease progression using the same methods as described in SA 2b.  We will evaluate the use of passive measures to directly assess disease severity. The longitudinal nature of the displacement data provides the ability to identify personalized changes in disease burden over time and to evaluate whether changes in activity patterns over time are comparable to changes in disease severity as evaluated within the other components of this study. By [CONTACT_292801]-visit evaluations we can test the ability to track disease severity. Daily displacement will be evaluated per individual relative to: finger tappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], gait assessment, and overall composite score for smartphone-based motor evaluation using passive data collected during the burst periods using Lin's concordance correlation coefficient, rc Likewise we will perform the same analysis on the tele-visit assessments.  Anticipated outcomes and alternatives:  The overarching goal of Aim [ADDRESS_357122] assessments – providing a way to reduce clinic burden and cost by [CONTACT_292802]. The use of these data also provides a mechanism to augment existing severity measures by [CONTACT_292803]. While not explicitly described in this proposal, the data collected within the program can be used to evaluate additional approaches to passive monitoring. For example, collection of accelerometer data provides the opportunity to develop an algorithm to monitor gait and balance from daily activities rather than formal assessments. Such assessments are exploratory for PD assessment but have demonstrated utility in the context of other neurological disorders.  13.3 Go/No-go Milestones, Challenges and Opportunities    
   Protocol Title: AT-HOME PD [Assessing Tele-Health Outcomes in Multiyear Extensions of PD trials]  
AHPD PROTOCOL_V3; Version date: 11/06/2019   Page 62 | 103 Our systematic approach to building the study’s main tele-health assessment platforms and then sequentially recruiting its sub-cohorts suggests realistic prospects of meeting our project timeline and of reaching pi[INVESTIGATOR_292722]/No-go milestones set at 75% of recruitment and retention goals to ensure a reasonable likelihood of accomplishing our SAs. However, in the event that a milestone was not achieved then NINDS program staff would determine in discussion with the SC whether the study should be continued and/or adapted.  Just as our infrastructure plans (under SA1) rely on logistical capabilities, our experimental hypotheses (under SAs 2 and 3) depend on scientific assumptions, which if challenged would lead us to consider contingencies accordingly. For example, the ability to compare disability progression measured by [CONTACT_21060]-health platforms relies on true disease progression during two years of cohort follow up. However, this period coincides with the so-called ‘honeymoon’ phase of treatment after DT initiation when observable motor progression may be modest due to early, uncomplicated medication titration (40). Anticipating this possible pi[INVESTIGATOR_292723], we will incorporate an adjustment for levodopa dose equivalents in our motor score-based progression analysis. We will also explore dopa-resistant cognitive outcomes and would proactively consider options to further extend the cohort into subsequent phases of non-motor and dopa-resistant disability accumulation. In addition, we will remain open to new opportunities to leverage the project’s resources; for example, adopting potentially more sensitive wearable technologies in this rapi[INVESTIGATOR_292724], or assessing events to which the study cohort may be uniquely suited such as the impact of parent trial results, which should be announced during the follow-up period.      13.4 Sample Size Determination  SA 1b.

From Synapse the fully transformed dataset will be transferred to the PDBP’s Data Management Resource (DMR) and further distributed to the wider research community. See Resource Sharing Plan for more detail.  Specifically, 1) data collected during tele-visits will be entered and maintained in REDCap (a secure web-based survey and data management system routinely employed by [CONTACT_292813]/CTCC) with GUIDs, date and time of visit as identifiers, where it will be accesses via an application program interface (API) by [CONTACT_292814]. 2) Survey data collected by [CONTACT_292815], stored, and accessed from a FI researcher portal developed by [CONTACT_292816] (USC’s Laboratory of Neuro Imaging which specializes in secure archival and sharing of neuroscience data) with GUIDs, date and time of visit as identifiers from which automated data transfer to Synapse will be configured 3) Data collected from participant smartphones will be transferred from users’ phones in real time on completion to the Sage Bionetworks-maintained Bridge server, where data will be aggregated, coded, and transferred to Synapse with GUIDs,

The Bridge server is actively maintained by a team of engineers at Sage Bionetworks and has been effectively used to manage  smartphone-based research studies including Smart4SURE and mPower. Synapse is a scientific data management and research collaboration platform designed and actively maintained by [CONTACT_292814] (http://synapse.org).  All the SP and FI data will be aggregated and cleaned within Synapse prior to combination with the tele-visit data using GUIDs, date and time of visit as key identifiers. Data combined from all three platforms is further transformed in Synapse using a random number of days that will be added to all dates for that subject, to obscure actual dates but maintain durations and relative dates. Standard pi[INVESTIGATOR_292727]. Accelerometer readings, click streams etc. are converted into hundreds of distinct measures of disease severity capturing different aspects of the PD that correspond to multiple phenotypic subtypes of behavior. Sage Bionetworks will continue to monitor and update both quality control methodology and features being extracted as new devices and technology are used by [CONTACT_117311]. Once cleaned and processed compatible data will be deposited in the PDBP’s DMR (see Data Sharing Plan).

Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), an Internet accessible Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system for data management will be utilized for this study. The REDCap system is designed to ensure timeliness and accuracy of data as well as the prompt reporting of data from the study on an ongoing basis to the study principal and co-investigators. REDCap is a free, secure, HIPAA-compliant, web-based application used for electronic capture and management of research and clinical study data. The REDCap system, developed by [CONTACT_50222], provides an intuitive user interface to enter, audit, monitor, and export data. It also helps users create web-based surveys. Data review and query processing will be done through interaction with the CHeT/CTCC and site personnel. Once the data are entered into REDCap, it is immediately stored in the central study database located at the URMC Data Center and is accessible for review by [CONTACT_141418].  Any changes to the data will be fully captured in an electronic audit trail.  The cycle of electronic data entry, review, query identification/resolution, and correction occurs over the course of the study period until all participants have completed the study.    Aggregated data, where event dates and times are transformed, will be made available through Synapse using version data snapshots to the Biostatistics Center. Once the Biostatistics Center and the CHeT/CTCC, in conjunction with the Sponsor and the principal investigator, agree that all queries have been adequately resolved and the database has been deemed “clean”, the database will be officially signed off and deemed locked. All permissions to make changes (append, delete, modify or update) to the database are removed at this time.   The [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (MGH) Biostatistics Center will be responsible for creation of analytical databases and the statistical analysis plan. Data management staff at the CHeT/CTCC will facilitate creating the data management plan, however, each collaborator will be individually responsible for data collection specific to their platform as well as providing documentation to be added to the overall data management plan.  There will be a data user agreement put in place for the use and transfer of data between CTCC and Sage Bionetworks. The University of [COMPANY_002]ster Information Security Office has reviewed and approved methods of data transfer and storage with entities outside the University [including Sage Bionetworks].  16. INVESTIGATOR/SITE  The protocol, informed consent form, and advertisement notices will be approved by [CONTACT_292817] (RSRB). The CHeT Site Investigator is responsible for providing copi[INVESTIGATOR_292728],

AHPD PROTOCOL_V3; Version date: 11/06/2019   Page 71 | 103 which were furnished to him/her, to all physicians and other study personnel responsible to them who participate in this study. The CHeT Site Investigator will discuss this information with them to assure that they are adequately informed regarding the study drug and conduct of the study. The CHeT Site Investigator must assure that all study staff members are qualified by [CONTACT_8640], experience and training to perform their specific responsibilities.  17. SAFETY MONITORING  All aspects of the study will be monitored by [CONTACT_292818] (GCP) and applicable regulations. There is no clinical monitor or safety monitoring committee for this study. The Steering Committee will review collected reportable events on a quarterly basis.  17.1 Study Committees   a. Steering Committee  The Steering Committee (SC) is composed of the [ADDRESS_357136] Principal Investigators (PIs), study biostatistician, and independent investigator members of the Parkinson Study Group with expertise in PD and allied fields of study, a patient advocate, and scientific or programmatic officers of partner institutions. The roles of SC Chair and Co-chair are filled by [CONTACT_292819] [INVESTIGATOR_292729]’s Multiple PI [INVESTIGATOR_292730]. The SC is responsible, along with the Sponsor, for the design of the study protocol and analysis plan and oversees the clinical trial from conception to analysis and publication.  17.2 Case Report Forms      Utilizing Electronic Data Capture (EDC). Site will enter participant information and data into an electronic case report form (eCRF) in the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) application - REDCap. The eCRFs are used to record study data and are an integral part of the study and subsequent reports. Authorized study personnel will each be granted access to the EDC tool via provision of a unique password-protected user-ID that will limit access to enter and view data. Data should be directly entered into the EDC system at the time of the participant’s tele-visit.  Data will be directly entered into eCRFs via computer stations connected remotely to the central server through an Internet browser. In the event of REDCap unavailability paper CRFs will be used and the data will be entered when REDCap is available.     CHeT Site Investigator approval of eCRFs: 
   Protocol Title: AT-HOME PD [Assessing Tele-Health Outcomes in Multiyear Extensions of PD trials]  
AHPD PROTOCOL_V3; Version date: 11/06/2019   Page 72 | 103 An approval from the CTCC Site Investigator is required on the following eCRFs:  x Signature [CONTACT_23094]  A form with the Investigator signature, either wet or electronic signature, will be uploaded into the database.   It is the CHeT Site Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that entries are proper and complete. Error checks will be implemented in the EDC based upon specifications defined in the data management plan.  At the conclusion of the study, the CTCC Data Management Team will create a PDF file depi[INVESTIGATOR_292731]. The PDF file should be printed for each participant in the study and filed in the participant’s binder.  17.3 Primary Source Documents  The Investigator will maintain primary source documents supporting significant data for each participant in REDCap. Any relevant telephone conversations with the participant regarding the study or possible adverse events and attempts to reach participants by [CONTACT_292820]/or compliance will also reside in REDCap.  17.4 Closeout Visit   Following the completion of the study, the study team will ensure all the data is entered and queries are resolved, any protocol deviations are documented appropriately, all relevant study data has been retrieved, and that the Investigator has copi[INVESTIGATOR_120882]-related data/information on file.  17.5 Closeout Plan  A study closeout plan will be developed that provides information about study close-out procedures and timelines internally as well as externally. Full details will be documented in the operations manual.  18. PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH FINDINGS  Publication of the results of this trial will be governed by [CONTACT_292821], Steering Committee and in accordance with the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICJME) Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals (http://www.icmje.org/urm_main.html).  Any presentation, abstract, or manuscript will be made available for review by [CONTACT_292822].

AHPD PROTOCOL_V3; Version date: 11/06/2019   Page 73 | 103 19. RESOURCE SHARING PLAN  Data will be collected across individual sites (U. [COMPANY_002]ster for tele-visit data; Sage Bionetworks for smartphone data; MJFF-sponsored portal in LONI for FI data). Data from all three sites will be aggregated in a centralized location using Synapse. Synapse is a cloud based scientific data management and research collaboration platform designed and actively maintained by [CONTACT_292814] (https://www.synapse.org/) that is used to coordinate data across dozens of consortia and collaborations. All data will be aggregated within Synapse using GUIDs, event dates and times as unique identifiers. Following aggregation, event dates and times are transformed by [CONTACT_292823] a random first visit for analysis and for distribution to the PDBP Data Management Resource (DMR) on a recurring, regular basis that complies with NINDS program requirements. Data is cleaned on an on-going basis, however, until the database is locked changes in data may occur. Deposition will use standard DMR protocols for clinical and PRO data. Because the DMR is not yet set up to receive sensor data, the appropriate deposition protocols will be developed in collaboration with the DMR. As these are developed, we have the alternative of working with NINDS to develop a system that provides PDBP and DMR-approved investigators with access to sensor data directly through the Synapse platform.  Data sharing will be performed in two additional ways. The smartphone data, tele-visit data, and FI data will be distributed for secondary use through the mobile health data repository that Sage Bionetworks has developed and that is also housed in Synapse. The shared study dataset will be made available to qualified researchers who are registered users of Synapse and who have agreed to use the data in an ethical manner, to do no harm and not attempt to re-identify or re-contact [CONTACT_4317]. No name [CONTACT_122541] [CONTACT_292824]. Researchers will have access to the shared study data but will be unable to map any particular data to the identities of the participants. The qualified researcher program is operated through an IRB-approved Synapse data governance plan. For more information about the data practices in the context of the Synapse research platform, see the Synapse Governance Overview (http://docs.synapse.org/articles/governance.html). In addition, data will be collected as part of FI, an IRB-approved web-based study.  All data collected through FI will be automatically deposited into a research portal hosted at LONI (http://www.loni.usc.edu/) for use by [CONTACT_292825].  The code used to run the smartphone application developed for this study will be made public through github (https://github.com/) and made available to the research community for reuse under an open license. The study will be registered at clinicaltrials.gov.

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
The Physiologic Pacing Registry is a prospective, observational, multi-center registry perfo rmed to gain a broader 
understanding of 1) physiologic pacing implant and follow-up wo rkflows, including pacing and sensing 
measurements and 2) the clinical utility in creating a 3-dimens ional electro-anatomical map of cardiac structures 
prior to physiologic pacing device implants based on the clinic al site’s routine care.  The registry will include 
patients undergoing implantation of an Abbott pacemaker, defibrillator, or a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) pacemaker (CRT-P) or CRT defibrillator (CRT-D) according to the clinical site’s routine care.  Only 
patients scheduled to receive an Abbott device may be enrolled to ensure proper device data collection for future software and other physiologic pacing product development. The decision to provide physiologic pacing therapy 
and selection of devices for implant are at the discretion of t he implanting physician. Abbott will collect data on the 
use of all commercially available leads and associated implant tools based on the physician’s discretion as part of 
routine clinical practice within the registry.   
 
This registry will be conducted in accordance with this Clinica l Plan. All investigators involved in the conduct of 
the registry will be qualified by [CONTACT_8640], training, or exper ience to perform their tasks and this training will be 
documented appropriately. 
1.1 Background and Rationale 
 Background 
Patients with cardiac disease may  exhibit symptoms associated with electrical conduction abnormalities, such as 
bradycardia and/or sinus node dysfunction, thereby [CONTACT_26128] a permanent dual-chamber 
(atrioventricular) or single-chamber (ventricular) pacemaker.  However, these pacing modalities are associated with alteration of the normal elect rical conduction due to right ven tricular (RV) api[INVESTIGATOR_26099],
1,2,[ADDRESS_25179] of care 
treatment for patients with ven tricular dyssynchrony is implant ation of a CRT system to activate the left ventricle 
and resynchronize the electrical conduction within the heart.  However, CRT is not always feasible due to difficulty in placing the left ventricular lead. Furthermore, the percenta ge of CRT non-responders remains high, up to 30-
40%.
7,8 
 An alternative and potentially m ore effective pacing strategy for patients with electrical conduction abnormalities is 
physiologic pacing. Physiologic pacing is achieved by [CONTACT_26129] a pacing stimulus to a cardiac conduction structure, such as the bundle of His or left bundle branch (LBB ) of the His-Purkinje system, with a permanent lead. 
Physiologic pacing activates the heart through the native His-Purkinje conduction system, thus offering the most 

ABT-CIP-[ZIP_CODE] Ver. C

consent of Abbott.
 Page [ADDRESS_25180] electrical dyssynchrony.  Physiologic pacing has emerged as a feasible and 
safe alternative to pacemaker therapy and CRT with clinical and  electrophysiological advantages. 
 
On such example of physiologic pacing includes activation of the His bundle.  The concept of His bundle pacing (HBP) was first described by [CONTACT_26130]’s native His-Purkinje system via pacing in 
both dogs and humans.
[ADDRESS_25181] s tudy of permanent HBP showed implant success 
in 12 of 18 patients (67%) with chronic atrial fibrillation aft er ablation of the atrioventricular junction.14,15 A 
subsequent study of permanent HBP  several years later demonstra ted a success rate of 65% in patients with AV 
block using standard pacing leads with retractable screws and m anually shaped stylets.[ADDRESS_25182] narrower paced QRS, (as 
compared to intrinsic or CRT p aced), shorter implant times, imp roved quality of life, improved left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF), and impr oved [LOCATION_001] Heart Associati on (NYHA) classification17,18,19 in lieu of a left 
ventricular lead.20 From these early studies, research ers found that QRS changes occur with different morphologies 
when undergoing permanent HBP 21,22, 23 and the morphology presentation is dependent upon: 1) the volt age output 
of the pulse generator 2) the anatomical position of the HBP lead and 3) the anatomical structure of the His bundle region.  Identification of the H BP morphology is important to l ocate the optimal lead implant location and pacing 
configuration. These three characteristics also play a key role  in the degree of electrical capture during HBP, 
resulting in either selective (pure His-bundle capture) or non- selective (surrounding fibrous tissue also recruited 
along with His-bundle) pacing.   
 
Another example of physiologic pacing is direct stimulation of the left bundle branch (left bundle branch pacing – 
LBBP). Indirect stimulation of the left bundle branch was first  demonstrated by [CONTACT_26131]-Sherif et al 
12 in CRT-indicated 
patients by [CONTACT_26132], thereby  [CONTACT_26133] (LBBB). 
Direct LBBP was first reported by [CONTACT_26134] 26, [ADDRESS_25183] stimulation are emerging 
and may be assessed through this registry as well.  
 
One major goal of physiologic pacing is to provide a consistent  reduction in QRS duration. Physiologic pacing 
provides an opportunity to ensure the normalization of the QRS;  however, many technical challenges remain, 
including: lead delivery, accura te His-Purkinje capture (selective vs. non-selective), and maintenance of stable 
pacing thresholds over time.  The data collected from this regi stry will offer further evidence on the utility of 
physiologic pacing implants and currently available tools, as well as the potential advantages of enhanced localization of physiologic pacing structures using a 3-dimensi onal mappi[INVESTIGATOR_16816].

 Rationale for Conducting this Clinical Registry 
In the recent recommendations from the His Bundle Pacing Collab orative Working group24, the authors suggested 
that technical challenges of achieving permanent HBP has been an obstacle to its reliable application in routine 
clinical practice. These technical challenges include difficult y in locating and placing a pacing lead at the 
appropriate His bundle location due to its small size and the s urrounding fibrous tissue. There are additional 
concerns related to maintaining chronic pacing due to high thre sholds and lead dislodgement. Pacing the LBB as 
known today has similar challeng es in locating and navigating t he pacing lead to a small target. 
The Physiologic Pacing Registry will be conducted to gain a deeper understanding of device implants for physiologic pacing and follow-up workflows, including the use o f any lead delivery tools, to help inform Abbott’s 
product and clinical data development efforts. Additionally, the registry will provide a broader understanding of the clinical utility in mappi[INVESTIGATOR_26100], such as the bundle of His and Left Bundle Branch, with the use of Abbott’s EnSite Cardiac Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_26101] a physiologic pacing device implant.

5.[ADDRESS_25187] Population 
The patient population for this registry is potential subjects undergoing implantation of an Abbott pacemaker, 
defibrillator, or CRT-P/D with any market released pacing lead as part of a physiologic pacing procedure according 
to the clinical site’s routine car e. The decision to provide ph ysiologic pacing therapy and selection of devices for 
implant are at the discretion of the implanting physician. 
This registry will consecutively approach patients scheduled to receive an Abbott device to enroll male and female 
subjects who are eligible for the above-mentioned device implan t. Subjects must meet all eligibility criteria and 
provide written informed consen t prior to conducting any regist ry-specific procedures not considered standard of 
care.  
5.[ADDRESS_25188] Screening 
Members of the site’s research team (physician and/or research coordinator, or other delegated and qualified 
personnel) previously trained to this Clinical Plan must screen potential patients for eligibility and should document screening efforts onto a site-specific screening log. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria may participate in this registry.

Potential patients meeting incl usion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be fully informed about the registry, 
following the established infor med consent process (described in Section 5.2.2). They w ill be asked to sign an 
Informed Consent form if they wis h to participate in the regist ry. These patients should also be entered onto the 
site-specific screening log.  Once a duly dated and signed Informed Consent form is obtained,  the registry-specific screening procedures may 
begin.  
The following assessments are pe rformed as part of the screening process: 
 Medical History  
 Cardiovascular Baseline Measures   
Subject data will be collected following enrollment
 into the registry. 
 Informed Consent 
The Patient Informed Consent form must receive approval from th e Sponsor and EC/IRB prior to beginning 
registry enrollment.    The Investigator or his/her authorized designee will conduct th e Informed Consent process, as required by 
[CONTACT_26137]’s EC/IRB. This process wi ll include a verbal discussion with the patient on all 
aspects of the registry that are  relevant to the patient’s decision to participate, such as details of registry procedures, 
anticipated benefits, and potential risks of registry participa tion. Patients must be info rmed about their right to 
withdraw from the registry at any time and for any reason without sanction, penalty or lo ss of benefits to which the 
patient is otherwise entitled. Withdrawal from the registry will not jeopardize their future medical care or relationship with the investigator.   During the discussion, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her au thorized designee will avoid any improper influence 
on the patient and will respect the patient’s legal rights. The  patient shall be provided with the Informed Consent 
form written in a language that is understandable to the patient and has been approved by [CONTACT_16018]’s EC/IRB. The 
patient shall have adequate time to review, ask questions and consider participation. If the patient agrees to 
participate, the Informed Consent form must be signed and dated  by [CONTACT_26138]-specific procedures. The signed original will be filed in the subject’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26107], and a copy will be provided to the  subject. 
 In addition, an authorization for use and disclosure of the subject’s protected health inf ormation, in accordance with 
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), must be obtained from the subjects or their legal representative.  
Failure to obtain informed consen t from a subject prior to enrollment should be reported to the Sponsor within 5 
working days and to the reviewing center’s EC/IRB according to the EC/IRB’s reporting requirements. 
 
If, during the registry, new information becomes available that can significantly affect a subject's future health and medical care, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her authorized designee will provide this information to the subject. 
If relevant, the subject will be asked to confirm their continuing informed consent in writing.

(including all deaths) and all adverse events related to the pr ocedure and/or device, whether serious or not, 
throughout the time period define d above and will report to the  Sponsor on a CRF. Additional information 
regarding an adverse event should be updated within the appropr iate CRF.  
 Unchanged, chronic, non-worsening or pre-existing conditions ar e not adverse events and should not be reported.  
An off-line form will be made available to allow the investigator to report serious adverse events in the event the 
entry cannot be made in the EDC. This does not replace the EDC reporting system. All information must still be 
entered in the EDC system as soon as feasible.   Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
The investigator will report all serious adverse events, includ ing all deaths, to the Sponsor as soon as possible but 
no later than outlined below.  
 
Clinical Site Reporting timelines 
All Sites All serious adverse events must be reported to the Sponsor no l ater than 3 calendar days 
from the day the site personnel became aware of the event or as per the investigative 
site’s local requirements, if the requirement is more stringent  than those outlined. 
 The date the site staff became aware the event met the criteria  of a serious adverse event must be recorded in the 
source document.  The Investigator will further report the serious adverse event to the local EC/IRB according to the institution’s EC/IRB reporting requirements. 
 Complaint Reporting 
During the registry, the investigator will be responsible for r eporting all complaints. A c omplaint is defined as any 
written, electronic or oral communication that alleges deficien cies related to the identity, quality, durability, 
reliability, safety, effectiveness or performance of a device a fter it is released for distribution. 
 If the complaint does not involve an adverse event, the investi gator must notify the Post-Market Surveillance 
Department by [CONTACT_26144] l to 
as soon as possible after becoming aware of the complaint.  This information will not be collected on a CRF 
for the registry. 
 
If the complaint involves an adve rse even
t, the investigator mu st complete an Adverse Event CRF, including the 
information on the complaint a nd submit to the Sponsor as soon as possible. 
 
 Device Deficiency/Malfunction Reporting  
Device deficiency is defined as an inadequacy of a medical device related to its identity, quality, durability, 
reliability, safety or performan ce, such as malfunction, misuse  or use error and inadequa te labeling. This includes 
the failure of the device to meet  its performance specification s or otherwise perform as intended. Note: performance 
specifications include all claims made in the labeling of the d evice.

 Sites should report all device de ficiencies/malfunctions for any Abbott product used to the Sponsor on the 
appropriate CRF form. The investigator must report all device d eficiencies/malfunctions to the Sponsor as soon as 
possible but no later than outlined below.  
 
Clinical Sites Reporting timelines 
All Sites Device deficiencies/malfunctions for any Abbott product used must be reported to 
the Sponsor no later than 3 calendar days from the day the site  personnel became 
aware of the event or as per the investigative site’s local req uirements, if the 
requirement is more stringent than those outlined.
Sites should return all devices to the Sponsor which are not im planted or not remaining in the subject.  In addition, 
sites should report device deficiencies/malfunctions to the IRB /EC per the investigative site’s local requirements. 
The Sponsor will provide an offline form to allow the investiga tor to report device deficiencies/malfunctions if the 
entry cannot be made in the EDC system. This does not replace t he EDC reporting system.  Sites must continue to 
enter all information in the EDC system as soon as feasible.  
 Procedure for Recording and Reporting Subject Death 
For all deaths, the investigator should record death informatio n in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26110]. 
The investigator should make all efforts to obtain details abou t the circumstances surr ounding the subject death. 
 
A subject’s death is an early c onclusion of the subject’s parti cipation in the registry. Therefore, the Investigator is 
required to complete the Withdrawal CRF.  Sites should report all death events as per the serious adverse  event reporting requirements stated in the ‘Adverse 
Event Reporting Requirements’ section (7.3.1).

There are no anticipated risks associated with participation in  this registry or any risks beyond those identified in 
the individual device Indication for Use. 
15.3 Steps Taken to Control or Mitigate Risks 
Physicians participating in this registry will be selected base d on their education, training, or experience in 
performing physiologic pacing procedures.  Therefore, physician s are expected to be aware of the known and 
foreseeable safety risks associ ated with the use of the devices , including the surgical and/or non-surgical treatment 
of these conditions.  The procedures outlined in this Clinical Plan are all standard of care according to the 
individual clinical site’s pr actice.  Additionally, clinical si tes will report all procedure and device-related adverse 
events to the Sponsor – all adve rse events will be monitored internally for safety surveillance purposes. 
15.[ADDRESS_25209] of care implant of a 
cardiac pacemaker, defibrillator, or CRT device.  There are pot ential unknown risks of physiologic pacing 
associated with the lead implant  procedure and long-term follow-up. Patients are indicated for an implant of a 
cardiac device and will undergo th e implant based on the clinic al site’s standard of care.  As such, patients 
participating in this registry h ave the same clinical benefit as those patients receiving a pacemaker, defibrillator, or 
CRT device.  There are potential benefits from receiving physio logic pacing. These benef its include the potential 
for sustained or improved ventricular function, as well as the potential benefits gained by [CONTACT_26150] a permanent lead for physiologic 
pacing.  Based on this information, the Sponsor believes the be nefits outweigh the risks associated with 
participation in the registry.

 APPENDIX IV: SUMMARY 
Registry Name [CONTACT_26161] – Post Market Registry 
Purpose The Physiologic Pacing Registry will be conducted to gain a dee per understanding of 
physiologic pacing device implants and follow-up workflows, inc luding device and 
programmer measurements to help  inform Abbott’s product and cli nical data 
development efforts. Additionally, the registry will provide a broader understanding of 
the clinical utility in mappi[INVESTIGATOR_26116] w ith the use of Abbott’s 
EnSite Cardiac Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_26117] w here mappi[INVESTIGATOR_26118] p rior to physiologic pacing 
device implan t.  
Objective(s) The Physiologic Pacing Registry will characterize implant and f ollow-up measures 
associated with physiologic paci ng device implants.  The regist ry will also compare 
implant and follow-up characteris tics for implants performed wi th and without utilizing

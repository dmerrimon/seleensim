Version: 06/16/[ADDRESS_421573] cancer.    
Human epi[INVESTIGATOR_104442] 2 (HER2)  has an  important role in cell survival, cell 
proliferation, cell maturation, metastasis  and angiogenesis, as well as exerting antiapoptotic effects  
(1)  HER2 -positive breast cancer accounts for approximately 2 5% of all cases of breast cancer.  In 
the setting of HER2 gene amplification or high levels of HER2 expression, the HER family of 
receptors and their associated signal  transduction pathways play a dominant role in cell growth 
and survival.  These tumors have a distinct natural history that, i n the absence of HER2 -directed 
therapy, is characterized by [CONTACT_340666] -free survival and an aggressive course in the metastatic 
setting.  Trastuzumab is monoclonal antibody directed against HER2.  Its anti -tumor activity is 
likely attributable to severa l different effects. Trastuzumab downregulates H ER2 expression on 
cell surface and activates p27 and p130.  Trastuzumab also sensitizes tumor cells to TNF and 
inhibits tumor angiogenesis by [CONTACT_340667].  In patients with HER2 -
amplifie d tumors , the overall response rate  to single -agent trastuzumab as a first -line therapy for 
metastatic breast cancer  is approximately  34%.  In a randomized study, Slamon et al .have shown 
that the addition of trastuzumab  improves survival in the adjuvant tr eatment of HER -positive  
breast cancer , although combined therapy with anthracycline -based regimens has been associated 
with cardiac toxicity  (2).  However, the non anthracycline -based regimens  combined with 
trastuzumab  have been associated with fewer acute toxic effects, and lower risks of  cardiotoxicity 
and leukemia.   Thus w hile trastuzumab  therapy results in  a significant improvement of disease free 
survival and overall survival , it is associated with cardiac toxicity resulting in symptomatic 
congestive heart failure and a significant dro p in left ventricular ejection function (3).  Identifying 
patients who are going to benefit from trastuzumab therapy will be of  critical  importance . 
Markers of Trastuzumab Resistance : Multiple trastuzumab  resistance mechanisms have 
been identified, including alternation of the of the HER2 protein that prevent trastuzumab binding 
and activation of downstream or parallel signaling pathways that support HER2+ breast cancer 
cell growth even in the presence of trastuzumab.   A shorted isoform of HER2, called p95-HER2 , 
lacks the trastuzumab binding site but is able to still promote breast cancer tumorigenesis (4).  The 
frequency of p95 -HER2 expression in patient samples has been reported to be up to 30 % (5, 6).  
Loss of the trastuzumab binding site will result in loss of 89Zr-trastuzumab  binding by [CONTACT_340668].  
Most studies to date have used Western blot, which has limited clinical utility, to identify 
the p95HER fragments. There is evidence that HER2 status may change during the course of the 
disease and after chemotherapy (7). In addition, d iscordance in HER2 expression across tumor 
lesions in the same patient has been reported (8-11). Thus,  the use of repeated biopsies during the 
course of the disease is encouraged (12, 13). However, repeated biopsies are not clinically feas ible 
due to their invasiveness and not all lesions are readily accessible to be biopsied (14). Therefore, 
a method that can reliably determine both the quantity and the functional status of tumor HER2 in 
individual lesions would be of critical importance in identifying patients who would benefit from 
HER2 -targeted therapy.  
Version: 06/16/2017  Page 9 Additional mechanisms for tr astuzumab resistance include activation of pSrc or activation 
of PI3-kinase signaling either by [CONTACT_23587]3CA gene mutation or deletion of PTEN  and upregulation of 
signaling from other receptor tyrosine kinases, IGF1R, EGFR, HER3, MET  and pMAPK (15, 16, 
33) .  These mechanism s of trastuzumab resistance would not be expected to al ter trastuzumab 
binding.   
Assessment of HER2 : In order to select the patients that are likely to benefit from HER -2-
targeted therapy, it is important to determine the status of HER -[ADDRESS_421574] cancer.  Currently, two 
types of tests, i.e. immunohistochemis try (IHC) that detects receptor overexpression and 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) that identifies HER -2 gene amplification, are used for 
the purpose (17-19).  Protein expression levels are scored as 0 or 1+ (zero or low), 2+ 
(intermediate) or high 3+.  Recent reports indicate a considerable degree of concordance between 
the two methods of detection on same tumor specimens.  While 100% concordance was observed 
in IHC 3+ readings when com pared with FISH, cases with 2+ IHC score were not very 
reproducible (20)  It is common practice to send scores of 2+ on IHC for FISH analysis, and 
patient s whose tissue is positive on FISH ( i.e. amplification >2.0) are offered trastuzumab.  Thus, 
such patients must have a confirmatory FISH test before administration of trastuzumab therapy.  
Though detection of HER -[ADDRESS_421575] is also found to be a better predictor of 
response to trastuzumab therapy and overall prognosis.   
Recently, ado -Trastuzumab Emtansine (T -DM1), a HER2 -targeted ADC consisting of a n 
antimicrotubule agent (DM1) linked to trastuzumab, has shown to be active in patients with 
trastuzumab and lapatinib refractory metastatic breast cancer . (34, 35, 36)   As the mechanism for 
this therapy is via binding to the extracellular domain of HER2,  the presence of this receptor is 
vital for this therapy to be efficacious.   
There is evidence that HER2 status may change during the course of the disease and after 
chemotherapy (7).  In additi on, discordance in HER2 expression across tumor lesions in the same 
patient has been reported  (8-11).  Thus,  the use of repeated biopsies during the course of the disease 
is encouraged (12, 13).  However, repeated biopsies are not clinica lly feasible due to their 
invasiveness and not all lesions are readily accessible to be biopsied (14).  Therefore, a method 
that can reliably determine both the quantity and the functional status of tumor HER2 in individual 
lesions would be of critical importance in identifying patients who would ben efit from HER2 -
targeted therapy .  
In vivo  measurement of the HER2 expression in  breast cancer could offer several 
advantages over current in vitro  methods. These include assessing the HER2 expression  of the 
entire tumor volume rather than just a part of th e tumor (addressing the intrinsic heterogeneity of 
receptor expression), assessing the biologic availability of HER2  in vivo , and evaluating the effects 
of therapy on HER2 expression of the tumor. In addition, in vivo imaging can simultaneously 
assess HER2  expression of the primary and metastatic lesions, many of which may be inaccessible 
to biopsy.  Efforts have been made to develop imaging agents for HER2 labeled with single photon 
radionuclides and positron emitting radionuclides for noninvasive in vivo  evaluation of HER2 
expression and localization of HER2 -overexpressing tumor lesions including inaccessible 
metastatic foci.  111In-trastuzumab, a single photon emission radiopharmaceutical , has been 
develop ed and tested in patients with breast cancer (21).  Perik et  al. have shown HER2 -specific 
uptake in patients with HER2 -positive metastatic breast cancer. 111In-trastuzumab imaging 
discovered unsuspected  HER2 -positive lesio ns in [ADDRESS_421576] cancer (21).  
In addition, there are several other radiopha rmaceuticals that have been used for clinical HER2 
imaging , such as 99mTc-labeled anti -HER2 rat antibody ICR12 .  99mTc-ICR12 was administered to 
[ADDRESS_421577] cancer , which  suggested that  this radiopharmaceutical  could be used for 
imaging of HER2 -positive disease  (22).  Currently, there are on -going clinical studies with both 
Version: 06/16/2017  Page 10 gamma -emitting and positron emitting radiopha rmaceuticals, such as 111In- and 64Cu-trastuzum ab 
and with 68Ga-trastuzumab F(ab′) 2 fragments  (23, 24).  
HER2  Imaging with PET: Positron emission tomography (PET) has been shown to have 
the ability to image radioligand binding quantitatively at tracer concentrations .  This  is a distinct 
advantage over conventional nuclear medicine using planar or SPECT imaging.  This has 
encouraged considerable efforts to develop positron emitting radionuclides such as 64Cu-
trastuzumab and 68Ga-trastuzumab F(ab′) 2 fragments , 68Ga-ABY -002 and 89Zr-trastuzumab (25).  
Limited clinical studies with 68Ga-ABY -[ADDRESS_421578] shown that high liver and renal uptake interferes  
with lesion detection in patients with metastatic lesions in the abdomen (26).  89Zr-trastuzumab 
using intact antibodies has the advantage over  the smaller HER2 -directed F(ab′) [ADDRESS_421579] monoclonal antibodies penetrate slowly but constantly into solid tumor 
tissue, ultimately resulting in higher accumulation in the tumor than is the case with small prote ins 
when  antibody fragments penetrate faster  into tumor tissue but show less tumor uptake because of 
more rapid clearance from the blood   (10).  In addition, f or immunoPET imaging, positron -emitting 
radiomet als such as 89Zr have an advantage over radiohalogens such as 124I because they are 
residualizing and are therefore retained within the target cell after internalization and intracellular 
degradation of the tracer.  This results in higher uptake in the tum or when an internalized antibody 
such as trastuzumab is used  (10).  Of the positron -emitting radiometals, 89Zr has the longest and 
therefore  most favorable half -life (78.4 h), allowing antibody imaging up to  7 days after the 
injection , the time needed for in vivo  circulation, optimal biodistribution and tumor targeting .  
Preclinical evaluation of 89Zr-trastuzumab showed that it displays superior image quality as 
compared to 111In-trastuzumab, given the high s patial resolution and sensitivity of PET  (27).  At 
Washington Univer sity, we have evaluated MDA435/LCCHER2/GFP/Luc (HER2 -positive) and 
MDA435/Lcc6Vector (HER2 -negative) cell lines, which overexpress and minimally express 
HER2, respectively, with 89Zr -trastuzumab.  Using flow cytometry, 
MDA435/LCC6HER2GFP/Luc cells demonstr ated elevated levels of HER2 expression in 
comparison to MDA435/LCC6Vector cells, which demonstrated minimal expression.  Both cell 
lines also express luciferase for bioluminescence imaging to confirm tumor growth.  In in vitro  
studies, the uptake of 89Zr -trastuzumab was 8.5 fold greater in HER2 -positive cells compared to 
HER2 -negative cells (p < 0.01).     
Dijkers  et al.  studied [ADDRESS_421580] cancer  with 89Zr-
trastuzumab -PET (28).  These  patients received 37 MBq of 89Zr-trastuzumab at one of three doses 
(10 or 50 mg for those who were trastuzumab -naive and 10 mg for those who were already on 
trastuzumab treatment). The patients underwent at least two PET scans between days [ADDRESS_421581] time for assessment of 
89Zr-trastuzumab uptake by [CONTACT_340669] 4 –[ADDRESS_421582] of the known lesions and some that had been

were 12.8 ± 5.8, 4.1 ± 1.6, and 3.5 ± 4.2 in liver, bone, and brain lesions, respectively, and 5.9 ±

adequate for 89Zr-trastuzumab -PET imaging.  The 50 -mg trastuzumab dose in naive patien ts is a 
good starting point for further optimization in future studies.  In patients undergoing treatment 
with trastuzumab at t he time of tracer injection, 10 mg trastuzumab was adequate for PET imaging.  
Higher doses of trastuzumab were not expected to im prove 89Zr-trastuzumab -PET imaging;

FDG -PET/CT Imaging:  The use of PET imaging with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)  for 
restaging breast cancer patients who have progressed on currently therapy and in predicting 
response to therapy in breast cancer is well documented and beneficial  (37,3 8).  FDG is transported 
into the cell via glucose transporters, but unlike glucose, FDG is not metabolized but is irreversibly 
phosphorylated by [CONTACT_340670]. Glucose  transport is upregulated in most 
cancers and the use of FDG PET imaging for restaging breast cancer patients who have progressed 
on current therapy is routinely used at our institution.  Biologic correlates of FDG uptake in breast 
cancer include mitotic activity index, histologic grade, tumor cel l density, as well as other markers 
of aggressiveness .  FDG -PET imaging has also proven useful in monitoring response to 
chemotherapy in the metastatic setting.    
Animal Toxicity Study  
Animal Toxicity studies were conducted at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center   The 
objective of the study was to evaluate the acute toxicity of a  single high dose intravenous infusion 
of cold Zr -DFO -Trastuzumab in mice 250 times  higher than the propose d clinical PET imaging 
dose for 89Zr-DFO -Trastuzumab.  
Zr-DFO -Trastuzumab  was tested at a dose level of 10 mg/kg  in B6D2F1mice (32 male and 
32 female) .  No unacceptable adverse events were observed for the test article during acute dosing 
or the followi ng 1 4-day observation period.  The study  conclude d that 10 mg/kg 89Zr-
DFOtraztuzumab   administered i.v. as a single dose is the No Observed Adverse Effect Level  
Dosimetry  (NOAEL in B6D2F1 mice ):  
The human radiation dosimetry estimates for the imaging agent 89Zr-trastuzumab  was 
calculated from mice dissection biodistribution data and from human S -values for 89Zr. Radiation 
dose estimates were calculated using the MIRD methodology. The human female and male adult 
model was used with the program OLINDA/EXM to cal culate the normal organ radiation dose 
estimates. A dosage of maximum of 2.[ADDRESS_421585] 
case specific activity of 0.2 mCi/m g, the 89Zr-trastuzumab  mass injected for a 2.5 mCi dosage 
would be 12.5 mg. The dosage giv en to mice and hamsters in the toxicity study was more than 30 
times the mass  (10 mg/kg)  as the proposed dosage to humans. Thus, favorable binding 
characteristics, animal biodistribution, dosimetry, and our ability to produce high -specific -activity 
product  combine to make 89Zr-trastuzumab  a candidate for human breast cancer imaging.

6.5.0 METHODS   
6.5.1 Study Design  
A singl e center, open -label,  baseline -controlled diagnostic imaging study de signed to 
assess the diagnostic quality of 89Zr-trastuzumab  imaging with PET.     
6.5.2 Patient Population   
Cohort 1: 12  adult women with Her2 -positive  primary, recurrent/metastatic breast 
cancer with lesion size ≥ 1.[ADDRESS_421595] radiological procedures: mammography, 
ultrasound, CT or MRI or physical examination  will be studied once with 89Zr-
trastuzumab -PET imaging. .  Patients who are o n trastuzumab based therapy can also 
participate.  Patients with recurrent/metastatic disease are required to have at least one 
measurable lesion  (as defined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1).. Written informed consent will be 
obtained prior to the PET imaging session .  89Zr-trastuzumab-PET images at [ADDRESS_421596] 
lesion detection rate.  89Zr-trastuzumab -PET images also will be correlated with all 
available imaging studies to assess lesion detec tion rate.  .  Cohort 1  subjects entered 
on study will be asked to undergo total body 89Zr-trastuzumab -PET imaging at two 
separate time points for purposes of calculating human dosimetry .   
 
Version: 06/16/2017  Page 16 Cohort 2: To evaluate whether tumor uptake 89Zr-trastuzumab correlates with tumor 
expression of HER2, only adult women with at least one measurable (based on RECIST 
1.1) primary or metastatic lesions, which has known HER2 status will be evaluated. 
HER2 -negative (0 or 1+, 2+ and FISH negative) and HER 2-positive lesions (3+ by [CONTACT_340672]) will be evaluated. A total of [ADDRESS_421597] time established from Cohort  1. 
Cohort 3: To evaluate preliminarily  if 89Zr-trastuzumab can predict patient response to 
the T -DM1 antibody drug conjugate .  To evaluate if loss of tumor binding of 
trastuzumab is the mechanism for acquired resistance to T -DM1 . Also, to identify 
metabolically active  tumor by [CONTACT_6789] -PET/CT in order  to map HER2+ metabolically 
active disease sites by 89Zr-trastuzumab .  In this Cohort, only adult women with at least 
one measurable (based on RECIST 1.1) HER2 -positive primary or metastatic /recurrent  
lesion  which is amenable to biopsy  will be evaluated. A total of 5 patients will be 
evaluated . Patients will undergo FDG -PET/CT followed by 89Zr-trastuzumab injection 
and imaging  at the best time established from Cohort  1 ([ADDRESS_421598] 89Zr-
trastuzumab injection) . These patients will also undergo a research tumor biopsy for in 
vitro analysis of known markers of resistant to H ER2-targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (such as PTEN, 
pAkt, pMAPK, and pSrc ) prior to starting T -DM1 -therapy . Optimal  pre-therapy  
scheduling will be FDG -PET/CT, biopsy, followed by [CONTACT_17838], and imaging 5 to 7 
days later .  However, due to anticipated scheduling conflicts other scheduling options 
will also be acceptable .  In addition, cohort 3 subjects will undergo  FDG -PET/CT an 
day 14 -28 of cycle 2 of T -DM1 therapy or immediately prior to administration of cycle 
3 of therapy.    
 
6.5.3  Infusion of Trastuzumab and 89Zr-Trastuzumab  
As suggested by [CONTACT_340673]. (28).  To minimize uptake of the radiotracer in normal 
tissues, trastuzumab -naïve  patients (OR patients who have received their last dose of 
transtuzumab therapy ≥ [ADDRESS_421599] of care therapy dose can be 
substituted for the 10 mg dose if scheduling permits.  The administration of a fixed small 
dose of unlabeled antibody to improve tumor -to-normal -tissue (T/N) uptake of the 
radiolabeled antibody is standard in this type of imaging procedure.  Infusion of 
trastuzumab will be prepared and administered in the trea tment area of the Siteman Cancer 
Center according to normal treatment protocol by [CONTACT_340674].  Following the infusion of trastuzumab 
subjects will be monitored for approximately [ADDRESS_421600] s as a result of the administrati on of the  small dose of 
trastuzumab for this study. However, as it is suggested for therapeutic dose, s ubjects who 
experience serious infusion reacti on (i.e., dyspnea, chest tightness, fever, rigor s or 
hypotension) during trastuzumab  administration will ha ve the infusion stopped.  
Continuation of dosing  and continuation on study  will be based on the severity and 
Version: 06/16/2017  Page 17 resolution of the event and will be at the discretion of the investigator  and the 
referring/treating physician. Any t reatm ent for an infusion react ion should  be administered 
per institutional practices .   
Immediately following release from the treatment area subjects will be transported 
to the clinical nuclear medicine facility or the CCIR for administration of 89Zr-trastuzumab .  
A maximum of 2.5 mCi (range 1-2.5 mCi)  of 89Zr-trastuzumab  will be injected 
intravenously  over a period of at least [ADDRESS_421601].  All PET imaging will be performed with a CTI/ Siemens Biograph  
40 PET/CT scanner, located on the 10th floor West Pavilion of Barne s-Jewish Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_340638] (CCIR) . The Biograph 40 is a 4 -ring PET scanner 
made up of a multi -LSO -detector ring system with 3D acquisition and reconstruction and 
109 image planes with an extended 21.6 cm axial field of view, enabling the detection of 
78% more photons (compared with a conventional -field-of-view scanner). The scanner 
features high spatial resolution (less than 5 mm in transaxial and axial dimensions) with 
Pi[CONTACT_3252] 3D ultra fast electronics for decreased dead -time and high signal -to-noise ratio .  
All patients will undergo r outine clinical staging as dictated by [CONTACT_340675]. The results of 89Zr-trastuzumab -PET will not be provided to the 
patient or the treating oncologist/surgeon unless , in the judgment of the principal 
investigator, the images demonstrate an unsuspected abnormality that may warrant further 
evaluation.   The results of baseline  FDG -PET/CT for cohort [ADDRESS_421602]’s medical record as this information is considered 
useful and relevant to patient management.  The results of the FDG -PET/CT scan 
performed after [ADDRESS_421603] FDG -
PET/CT imaging which clearly shows progression after two cycles of therapy should be 
known so that the treating physician can make an informed decision about continuing on 
therapy.  .   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] PET Imaging  Procedure  
All subjects entered on study will be asked to undergo total body (brain to 
upper thighs  or extended to include metastatic disease in the lower legs ) 89Zr-
trastuzumab -PET imaging .  
Subjects who enter on study in Cohort 1 will undergo whole body imaging twice 
within 7 days following administration of 89Zr-trastuzumab  to measure HER2 
density and calculate human dosimetry .  4 Subjects will be imaged at each of the 
following time points:   
 [ADDRESS_421604] injection.  
Version: 06/16/[ADDRESS_421605] injection    
A window of ± [ADDRESS_421606] at a 
maximum of 30  mAs (or  care dose calculated dose if less than 30 mAs)  and 120 
kVp (Biograph 40) . Average CT scan time is 15-[ADDRESS_421607] scan, emission 
images beginning at the top of the skull and proceeding down  through the upper 
thighs  will be obtained ( 1-10 min per bed position) .   
In addition to 89Zr-trastuzumab -PET imaging , Cohort  [ADDRESS_421608] be ≤ 200 mg/dL (or approved by [CONTACT_340676]) for FDG administration to occur.  10 -15 mCi of FDG will be 
administered intravenously f ollowed by a 50 -70 min uptake period.  Oral hydration 
or IV hydration (up to 500 ml) may be given during the uptake period.  Oral and IV 
contrast will not be routinely administered for FDG -PET imaging.   
Cohort [ADDRESS_421609] scan for attenuation 
correction will be obtained from the base of the brain to th e upper thighs (or 
adjusted higher or lower to include known sites of disease).  As described above a 
topogram will be obtained followed by a spi[INVESTIGATOR_25457].  The baseline CT scan 
(done prior to starting TDM -1 therapy) will be a maximum of 111 mAs (or care  
dose if calculated to be less)   the follow up scan performed after 2 cycles  of therapy 
will be a maximum of 50 mAs or case dose calculated.  Immediately after the 
attenuation scan emission imaging will be obtained at 2 -5 minutes per bed position.    
 
For safety analysis , all subjects will undergo vital sign measurement, 
clinical laboratory testing, and ECG testing  as specified in sections 6.5. 6, 6.5.7 and 
6.5.8 of the protocol.   No additional safety analysis is needed for FDG -PET/CT.   
 
6.5.[ADDRESS_421610] data 
according to the provided scanner manufacturer software package. PET images will be 
evaluated semiquantitatively by [CONTACT_340677] (SUV) and tumor -to-
normal tissue (T/N) ratio or tumor -to-muscle (T/M)  ratio. The SUV is widely used for 
assessment of regional tracer accumulation in oncological studies, is technically simple to 
perform, and makes imaging easier for the patient because longer dynamic imaging is not 
required. SUV is a decay -corrected measurement of activity per volume of tissue (nCi/mL) 
divided by [CONTACT_340678].  
Version: 06/16/2017  Page 19 Cohort 1:  Images will be assessed by [CONTACT_458], who will initially be 
blinded to all clinical information available (tumor size, location, and HER2  status). 
Overall image quality will be graded (using 4-point scale  with 1 being the worse and 
poor quality, not acceptable for di agnostic interpretation and 4 being good image 
quality, similar to routine clinical studies), the number of lesions (up to [ADDRESS_421611] intense 
lesions and in patients with multiple lesions, 2 in each organ), and the degree of 
confidence for malignancy of each l esion ( tumor foci will be graded on a five-point 
scale regarding the presence or absence of abnormal uptake: 1 = definitely normal; 2 = 
probably normal; 3 = equivocal; 4 = probably abnormal; and 5 = definitely  abnormal ).  
Semiquantitative analysis of the i mages will also be obtained.  F or all tumor foci 
(primary and metastases, if identified  and grade 4 or 5 on the malignancy confidence 
scale ) and main organs (i.e., blood pool, liver, kidney, bladder, etc.) , an SUV 
calculation (or T/N, T/M) will be performe d.  
Human Dosimetry  (results published (39):  Calculation from Cohort 1 images:  Using 
our standard image analysis software, regions of interest (ROIs) will be traced on the 
visible organs as visible on the PET/CT whole body images. Average organ activity 
concentration will be measured from large 3D ROI encompassing most of the organ 
volume. Decay corrected to injection time activity concentrations will be expressed as 
fraction of injected activity and plotted as a function of time combing all data points 
from all twelve patients. Activity organ residence times will be calculated by [CONTACT_340679] -activity curves. Uptake/clearance functional fits of 
mono - or bi -exponential functions will be performed and analytical integration,  
accounted for physical decay, will be performed.   
It will be assumed that the lung and heart chamber residence times to be determined in 
proportion of their respective blood content which will be taken as [ADDRESS_421612] to the whole body blood volume  (29). The blood content of the major 
organ are taken to be: 550mL in heart, [ADDRESS_421613] human size of 
70 kg with 5.1 liter of blood (29).  The red marrow residence times will be calculated  
from the formula of Wessels et al. (30) for intact antibody.

 where RMCEFF = 0.19 for the red marrow extra 
cellular fluid fraction (RMECFF), HCT, the hematocrit value taken as 0.39 and M RM 
and M blood -patient are the mass of red marr ow and mass of blood in the patient (31) Since 
activity in the blood is assigned to each major organ, 72% of the blood residence time 
will be assigned to the remainder of the body. All unaccounted for activity will be 
assumed to be excreted. This value is expected to be small due to the long ret ention 
time of mono -clonal antibodies.  
 
The calculated residence times will be used with the program OLINDA/EXM for 89Zr 
and using the adult human female model to calculate the individual organ radiation 
dose, the whole -body dose and the effective dose. Do ses will be reported in rad/rem 
per mCi injected or rad/rem  
Cohort 2: Images will be evaluated by [CONTACT_340680] (graded on a five -
point scale regarding the presence or absence of abnormal uptake: 1 = definitely 
negative; 2 = probably negative;  3 = equivocal; 4 = probably positive; and 5 = definitely 
positive) and semiquantitatively (SUV and T/N) with the knowledge of the location of 
Version: 06/16/2017  Page 20 the lesion with known HER2 status. The uptake of 89Zr-trastuzumab will be correlated 
to the HER2 status of each l esion. It is expected that a significant difference (p < 0.05) 
in 89Zr-trastuzumab tumor uptake between HER -positive and HER2 -negative lesions 
will be seen .  
Cohort 3: 89Zr-trastuzumab images will be evaluated by [CONTACT_340680] 
(graded on a fiv e-point scale regarding the presence or absence of abnormal uptake: 1 
= definitely negative; 2 = probably negative; 3 = equivocal; 4 = probably positive; and 
5 = definitely positive) and semiquantitatively (SUV and T/N) with the knowledge of 
the location o f the lesion with known HER2 status.  The uptake of 89Zr-trastuzumab will 
be correlated to response to T -DM1 therapy and the markers of resistant to H ER2-
targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] .  FDG -PET/CT images will be evaluated according to standard 
clinical practice with generation of a clinical report, and inclusion of images and report 
to the participant’s medical record  (only for the baseline FDG -PET/CT) .  The second 
FDG -PET/CT is considered research and the results of the study will not be reported, 
however, the treati ng oncologist will be inform ed of the results if there is a finding that 
may impact patient management or is life threatening. Additional study specific 
analysis will consist of SUV measurement of six most intense lesions (not more than 2 
lesions per organ ) in order to assess change in FDG uptake after therapy and assess 
metabolic response . 
 
6.5.[ADDRESS_421614] in the same position (supi[INVESTIGATOR_340639]). Although allergic  or 
other immediate adverse  reactions are not anticipated , subjects will be monitored for at 
least [ADDRESS_421615] injection in an ar ea where emergency equipment is avai lable. Vital signs 
will be obtained pre-injection  (within 30 minutes prior to  injection  of 89Zr-trastuzumab ), 
within 10-[ADDRESS_421616] on the imaging table and at 
discharge after the scan has been completed.  . Vital signs will include the f ollowing: h eart

temperature. The following changes from baseline will be considered noteworthy:   
 Heart rate:    > 20 beats per minute  
 Systolic blood pressure  > 20 mm Hg  
 Diastolic blood pressure  > 10 mm Hg

6.5.9  Cohort 3 Research Biopsy Procedure  
  All subjects enrolled in cohort 3 will undergo a biopsy of th e suspec ted p rimary  or 
recurrent/metastatic  lesion  prior to initiation of T -DM1 therapy .  If a biopsy has already 
been scheduled as part of the subject’s standard of care she will be asked to provide 
additional tissue at the time of biopsy.  If biopsy is n ot needed per standard of care the 
biopsy will be required for research purposes only.  The type of biopsy (CT guided, 
ultrasound guided, etc) will be determined by [CONTACT_340681] a diagnostic specimen.  It is preferred that the biopsy be the first 
research procedure followed by [CONTACT_340682] -PET/CT, 89Zr-trastuzumab injection and 
imaging  5 to 7 days after injection.  H owever , other scheduling options will be 
determined based on availability of the various modali ties on an individual basis.   
 
Biopsy specimens will be sent to the AMP Core lab  at the Washington University School of 
medicine where they will be formalin -fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE).  Upon completion 
samples will be transferred to the secure lab of one of the primary breast oncologists ([CONTACT_340700] or 
[CONTACT_65576]) where they will be securely stored at ro om temperature until all cohort  [ADDRESS_421620] been enrolled and completed study procedures.  Batch processing of all samples for 
phospho -MAPK, phospho -Akt,, phospho -Src, PTEN and HER2 will occur for research purposes 
only.   If applicable and if informed consent for storage of future research was obtained any 
remaining tissue samples will be transferred to the lab manager for enrollment into an a pplicable 
tissue bank or for use in retrospective  or current research projects.  Remaining tissue samples for 
those who did not consent to future use will be destroyed per current lab practices.  
 
Version: 06/16/2017  Page 23 6.6.0  Drug Preparation   
 89Zr-trastuzumab will be prepared as previously described  by [CONTACT_340683] (29).  89Zr-
oxalate w ill be produced via the 89Y(p,n)89Zr transmutation reaction on the CS -15 cyclotron 
(Cyclotron Corporation, Berkeley, CA) as described previously (30, 31).  The resulting 89Zr-oxalate  
is produced with a specific -activity of 8.1-15.4 GBq/mol (220 -418 mCi/mol).   Trastuzumab  
(HerceptinTM, Genentech, South  San Francisco, CA) is incubated with  Df-Bz-NCS (Macrocyclics, 
Dallas, TX) in 0.[ADDRESS_421621], Df -Bz-NCS -trastuzumab, is 
purified via Zeba Spin Desalting Columns (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_340645], Rockford, IL).  89Zr is 
complexed wi th Df -Bz-NCS -trastuzumab in 0.5 M HEPES buffer pH 7.0 at 37oC for 1h with 
constant agitation at 850 RPM.  89Zr-Df-Bz-NCS -trastuzumab is purified with Zeba Spin Desalting 
Columns and radiochemical purity determined by [CONTACT_186355] -ITLC with 50 mM DTPA and analytic al 
size-exclusion chromatography (Superose 12 10/[ADDRESS_421622], NJ ).   
 
6.7.0 Statistics   
Study Endpoints:  
The primary endpoint of the study is the 89Zr-trastuzumab uptake in tumors and normal 
structures including the blood pool, liver, intestine, kidneys and bladder evaluated by [CONTACT_340684] (SUV) and tumor -to-normal tissue ratio (T/N). The secondary 
endpoint of the study is the tumor expression of HER2 that is HER2 -negative (0 or 1+, 2+ 
by [CONTACT_340685]) and HER2 -positive (3+ by [CONTACT_340686]) correlates 
with 89Zr-trastuzumab tumor uptake.  
 
Study Design:  
This is a study aiming to demonstrate the feasibility of using 89Zr-trastuzumab -PET in 
breast cancer patients by [CONTACT_340687]2 -positive tumors. The sampling method is non -
random. For Specific Aim 1, twelve  HER -positive patients will be imaged to determine the 
imagining time for optimal image quality based on visual a nd semi -quantitative analysis of 
the images. Images will be independently evaluated by [CONTACT_340688]. Inter -rater reliability 
will be examined. For Specific Aim 2, the differentiating power of 89Zr-trastuzumab -PET 
on HER2 expression will be examined on 20 HE R2-negtive and 20 HER2 -positive patients 
using the optimal imaging time established by [CONTACT_45438] 1. The 5 patients enrolled to 
cohort 3 will be used as pi[INVESTIGATOR_340646] a larger trial specific to this patient population 
only.   
 
Accrual:  
The rate o f accrual for the study is expected to be about [ADDRESS_421623] with 80% power at a 2 -sided 0.05 significance level, 
the designed sample size (n=20 patients/group) will allow us to detect a minimum of 91% 
SD between -group difference, where SD represents the standard deviation of 89Zr-
trastuzumab uptake in a po oled data. Previous study on 89Zr-trastuzumab -PET and HER2 -
positive tumors in breast cancer (29) showed that the coefficients of variance 
(CV=SD/Mean) of relative uptake values (RUVs) on normal tissues ranged from .65 – 
Version: 06/16/2017  Page 24 1.66, assuming similar variability w ill be seen in this study, this sample size will allow us, 
with 80% power at [ADDRESS_421624] a between group difference of 
60% - 150% normal tissue means.  
 
Data Analysis  
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample wil l be summarized using 
descriptive statistics. For Specific Aim 1, Cohen's kappa coefficient will be calculated to 
measure inter -rater agreement on images quality and lesion detection. For Specific Aim 2, 
the association between 89Zr-trastuzumab uptake valu es (e.g., SUV, T/N) and HER2 
expression on tumor will be examined via Wilcoxon rank sum tests, Spearman -Brown 
correlation coefficients, and scatter plots. Bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_340647] a 
method of inference which does not rely on a specific unde rlying distribution considering 
sample size is small. The changes in vital signs and clinical laboratory tests will be listed 
to evaluate the safety of 89Zr-trastuzumab -PET.  
 
Cohort 3: The association between tumor uptake of 89Zr-trastuzumab and response to T -
DM1 and markers of HER2 resistance will be examined via Pearson and/or Spearman’s 
rank correlation coefficients . Imaging measurements such as SUV for 89Zr-trastuzumab 
and FDG uptake w ill be collected on all patients at baseline and after 2 cy cles of T -DM1. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize each type of measurements at each time 
point, including mean, median, range, overall across all patients and by [INVESTIGATOR_163792].  Given 
40~44% response rate, we may have [ADDRESS_421625] at each time point.  
 
6.8.0 Risks and Benefits  
The potential risks from this imaging protocol are expected to be very low. Expected risks 
include discomfort from th e placement of intravenous catheter (s) for injection of  trastuzumab,  and 
89Zr-trastuzumab  (and FDG for cohort 3) , radiation exposure from the injection of 89Zr-
trastuzumab  (and FDG for cohort 3)  and from low dose CT scan used for attenuation correction  
and discomfort from lying still on the imaging table . Whenever possible, injection site will be 
contra lateral to the known tumor site  if a primary breast or axillary lesion is present . Blood 
samples will be obtained for safety analysis . There is a slight ris k of bruising and a remote risk of 
infection from the placement of the intravenous catheter (s). Although  unlikely, there is a rare 
chance of having patients suffer an allergic or other immediate adverse reaction to trastuzumab or 
89Zr-trastuzumab . To minimize the risks to subjects, intravenous catheters will only be placed by 
[CONTACT_21724]. All studies will take place under the supervision of the Principal Investigat[INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] 
a collaborating physician. Additionally, the PET scanner is located within  the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_340648].  
At standard therapeutic doses Trastuzumab can be cardiotoxic.  HER2 negative subjects 
who enter on study as part of cohort [ADDRESS_421626] a norm al ejection fraction as 
determined by [CONTACT_340689].  Although, a significantly higher risk of 
congestive heart failure has been reported  in regimens in which trastuzumab was given for more 
than six months than in regimens without tra stuzumab ( risk ratio (RR)  5.39; 90% confidence 
interval  (CI) 3.56 to 8.17, p < 0.[ZIP_CODE]). A shorter treatment period did not appear to be associated 
with an increase in the risk of congestive heart failure (RR 0.50; 90% CI 0.07 to 3.74, p = 0.57) 
(32). In addition, the risk of congestive heart failure has been reported to be  significantly higher 
when trastuzumab was  given sequentially with chemotherapy (RR 11.05; 90% CI 3.46  to 35.29, p 
< 0.0007) and concurrently (RR 3.90; 90% CI 2.42  to 6.28, p < 0.[ZIP_CODE]) (32). Establishing baseline 
cardiac function for this subject population is done as a precaution in case abnormal cardiac 
Version: 06/16/[ADDRESS_421627] 
during the scan.  Risks from RVG include r adiation exposure, discomfort from lying on the 
imaging table and from the IV injection of stannous pyrophosphate and technetium -99m necessary 
to perform the imaging procedure.    
Radiation Exposure: This research project involves radiation exposure to participants from 
the i.v. injection of 89Zr-trastuzumab  and 2 whole -body PET/CT scans . The total amount of 
radiation exposure received, when averaged over the entire human body, is e quivalent to a uniform 
whole -body exposure of approximately 4.86 rem for cohort 1 subjects and 4.47 rem for cohort 2  
HER2 positive  subjects  (4.[ADDRESS_421628]) .  Cohort 2 HER2 negative subjects who receive RVG 
imaging at screening to determine study eligibility will receive an additional 0.65 rem of exposure 
for a total of 5.12 rem.  Cohort 3 subjects  (with updated radiation dosimetry based on calculations 
and pu blished data from cohort 1 subjects (39) will receive  up to  7.83 rem of total exposure  (3.[ADDRESS_421629] 
scans, and 0.16 to 0.29 rem additional exposure depending on the type of biopsy procedure 
performed).   . 
Research tumor biopsy: Research biopsy will be performed by [CONTACT_340690] -guidance  according to stand ard of care procedure. The risks related to the biopsy are 
described below  
 
Likely/Common  
• Pain or discomfort  
• Bruising around the biopsy site  
• Redness around the biopsy site  
• Discomfort from the pressure of the probe during the ultrasound procedure  
• Pain, discomfort, bleeding, bruising, and allergic reaction from the numbing 
medication  
• Drowsiness, slurred speech, staggering gait (clumsy or uncoordinated walking), poor 
judgment, and poor reflexes from the sedative  
 
Less Likely/Less Common  
• Swelling  
• Excessive bleeding  
• Drainage  
 
Rare  
• Infection at the site where the biopsy needle penetrates though the skin  
• There is also the possibility that having this procedure may shift some cells from the 
tumor into the surrounding tissues that come in conta ct with the biopsy needle.  This 
means that if there are cancer cells present there is a slight risk they could spread to 
that area.   
 
Although subjects who participate in this early phase [ADDRESS_421630] carcinoma  far outweigh the minimal risks anticipated.  It is anticipated that this 
study will contribute to the understanding of the performance of the 89Zr -trastuzu mab-PET/CT in 
evaluating HER2 status and the interaction of HER2 with trastuzumab based therapy in breast 
Version: 06/16/2017  Page 26 cancer.  Ultimately, 89Zr-trastuzumab -PET/CT may provide clinically important information about 
HER2 expression that can be used to select patients wi th trastuzumab or T-DM1 therapy and to 
assess the effectiveness of therapeutic strategies targeted to treat HER2 -positive cancer . 
6.9.[ADDRESS_421631].  A patient file 
will be kept in the Research Coordinators’ office (Room 1017C ) located on the 10th floor of the 
Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology in Barnes -Jewish Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_340649]. Each file will 
contain a copy of the original signed conse nt form, as well as documentation necessary to prove 
patient eligibility to participate in this research study. Specific documentation of imaging 
procedures will also be maintained in this patient file. Original signed consent forms will be 
maintained in a  separate file also located in the coordinators’ office. All digital data associated 
with 89Zr-trastuzumab -PET imaging is maintained on the PET acquisition computer. Raw data 
files are backed up on password protected encrypted external hard drive(s) . All i maging data is 
also backed up on DVD after it has been transferred to a desktop PC. Processed data will be stored 
on the P rincipal Investigator 's password protected desktop.   CRF's  and patient files will be stored 
in the study coordinators' office. Entrance to the PI's and coordinators' offices requires admission 
through two separate locked doors.    
6.10.0  Regulatory and Reporting Requirements   
6.10.1  Adverse Events (AEs)  
 
Definition:  any unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject who receives 89Zr-
Trastuzumab and PET/CT  imaging, including any abnormal sign, symptom, or disease.   
The event does not necessarily have to be causally related to injection of 89Zr-Trastuzum ab 
or PET/CT imaging to qualify as an adverse event, just temporally related.   
 
Grading:  the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4 .0 will be utilized for all 
toxicity repo rting .  A copy of the CTCAE version 4 .0 can be downloaded from the CTEP 
website.  
 
Attribution (relatedness), Expectedness, and Seriousness:  the definitions for the terms 
listed that should be used are those provided by [CONTACT_9930]’ Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP).  A copy of this guidance can 
be found on OHRP’s website:  
http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html  
 
6.10.2  Unanticipated Problems  
 
Definition:  
 unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristic s of the subject population being studied;  
 related or possibly related to participation in the research (in this guidance 
document, possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, 
Version: 06/16/[ADDRESS_421632] been caused by t he procedures involved in the 
research); and  
 suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously 
known or recognized.  
 
6.10.3  Noncompliance  
 
Defini tion:  failure to follow any applicable regulation or institutional policies that govern 
human subjects research or failure to follow the determinations of the 
IRB.   Noncompliance may occur due to lack of knowledge or due to deliberate choice to 
ignore regu lations, institutional policies, or determinations of the IRB.  
 
6.10.4  Serious Noncompliance  
 
Definition:  noncompliance that materially increases risks, that results in substantial harm 
to subjects or others, or that materially compromises the rights or welfare of participants.  
 
6.10.5  Protocol Exceptions  
 
Definition:  A planned deviation from the approved pro tocol that are under the research 
team’s control. Exceptions apply only to a single participant or a singular situation.  
 
Research imaging protocols which involve the injection of radioactive tracers can produce 
unique situations not common to standard tre atment protocols.  In the even t a situation 
occurs which requires deviation from this protocol – for example less than expected tracer 
production, problems with the scanner, patient unable to tolerate the imaging protocol as 
described, the principal invest igator will have final authority over whether or not a study 
is completed.  Any protocol deviations will be documented on the PET imaging data form.  
Deviation such as less than expected tracer production can be accounted for during data 
analysis and will not necessarily result in cancellation of the scan.  Similarly, adjusting 
imaging procedures to accommodate patient comfo rt can also be accounted for at the time 
images are reviewed.   
 
Except as described above, p re-approval of all protocol exceptions mus t be obtained prior 
to the event.  
 
6.10.6  Reporting to the Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) and the Quality 
Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee (QASMC) at Washington 
University  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_340650]:

investigator) at immediate risk of  death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does 
not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death.  
 Report any serious, unexpected adverse experiences, as well as results from animal 
studies that suggest sign ificant clinical risk within 15 calendar days  after initial 
receipt of this information.  A serious adverse drug experience  is defined as any 
adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
o Death  
o A life-threatening adverse drug experience  
o Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
o A persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., a substantial disruption 
of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
o A conge nital anomaly/birth defect  
o Any other experience which, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  
 
An unexpected adverse drug experience  is defined as any adverse drug experience, 
the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the current investigator 
brochure (or risk information, if an IB is not required or available).  
 
For the purposes of regulatory reporting, a causality a ssessment of definitely related, 
probably related, or possibly related will be managed as “related,” and unrelated or unlikely 
related will be managed as unrelated.”

This consent form describes the research study and helps  you decide if you want to participate.  It 
provides important information about what you will be asked to do during the study, about the risks and 
benefits of the study, and about your rights as a re search participant . By [CONTACT_340693].  
 If you have any questions about anything  in this form, you should ask the research team for 
more information.   
 You may also wish to talk to your family or friend s about your participation in this study . 
 Do not agree to participate in this study  unless the research team has answered your 
questions and you decide that you want to be part of this study.  
 
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY?  
This is a research study .  We invite you  to participate in this research study because you  have been 
diagnosed with new or recurrent breast cancer which has been tested for a protein called human 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169] (HER2).  HER2 is a protein which helps cancer cells to grow.   HER2 positive 
breast cance r cells have excess HER2 .  Currently, there are treatments approved  by [CONTACT_116100] (FDA)  to target H ER2.  One approved treatment is a drug called 
trastuzumab (also known as Herceptin ).  Trastuzumab targets HER2 and kills the cancer cells.  
Trastuzumab can be used alone or with other drugs in the treatment of breast cancer.   
 
One problem with the current way breast cancers are diagnosed and treat ment decisions are made is that 
we must rely on biopsies or small samples of tissue that are taken from the tumor  to tell us what types of 
cancer cells are present .  A tumor may not be uniform in the type of cells present so the biopsy sample 
may not accurately represent the actual function of t he cells within the tumor.  Additionally, just because 
a tumor was classified as, for example, HER2 positive at initial diagnosis , recurrent or metastatic tumors 
may not have the same characteristics.   
 
The primary goal of this research imaging study is t o see if a radioactive labeled form of trastuzumab 
called 89Zr-trastuzumab can provide more information about the location and function of HER 2 positive 
cells within the body .  A radioactive labeled form of trastuzumab is the FDA approved medicine 
trastuz umab which has a very small amount of a radioactive element called zirconium attached to it.  
This labeled form of trastuzumab allows us to image it within the body to confirm it is going to known 
cancer cells within the body . We will also be looking at ho w accurate 89Zr-trastuzumab imaging is in 
tumors classified has HER -2 negative.  The safety of 89Zr-trastuzumab and the amount of the radioactive 
tracer that is found in normal cells when it is injected into the blood stream and how  the amount of 89Zr-
trastuzumab in the tumor cells and normal tissues changes over time is also being studied.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THIS STUDY?  
To participate in this study you will be asked to read and sign this consent form before any study 
procedures are performed.  Your study doctor will determine if you are eligible to participate by 
[CONTACT_340694], medical records, current medications, and imaging scans.  
 
Standard medical procedures that are part of your regular cancer care and probably would be done even 
if you do not join the study will be reviewed along with those procedures that are do ne for research 
purposes only.  
 
If you are one of the first [ADDRESS_421671] to evaluate how 
well your heart is functioning before you will be entered on study.  Trastuzumab, when given over a 
period of time at treatment doses (dose much higher than you will receive in this study) can cause heart 
failure (inability of the heart to properly pump blood).   You may receive  either a MUGA (multi -gated 
acquisition scan) or an ECHO (echocardiogram).  Both of these test s take pi[INVESTIGATOR_340652].  A MUGA scan uses a small amount of a radioactive tracer to label the blood 
cells so the scanner is able to take the pi[INVESTIGATOR_499].  For the MUGA scan you will receive two injections 
about [ADDRESS_421672] 3 months it will not need to be repeated.   
 
All Patients:  Infusion/Injection Visit  Day [ADDRESS_421673] of two parts : trastuzumab infusion followed by 89Zr-
trastuzumab injection.   For both parts of the visit an IV will be needed.  The IV will be inserted into an 
upper extremity  vein such as one in your arm or  hand.  If you are a woman capable of becoming 
pregnant, you wi ll have a blood or urine pregnancy test performed to confirm you are not currently 
pregnant before you will be allowed to receive the infusions . Blood , if not previously obtained in the 
past [ADDRESS_421674] laboratory t esting ( routine testing of your 
blood counts and organ function will be obtained.  Standard laboratory testing is used to monitor the 
safety of 89Zr-trastuzumab so these tests will be repeated several times during the study.  Each time, 
approximately [ADDRESS_421675] one time only  before you 
receive trastuzumab.  
 You will be asked to provide a urine sample  (if not previously obtained in the past 21 days)  for 
standard laboratory testing .

Version #  04.18.2016  Page 3 of 11  Your weight will be measured and your vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate and 
temperature) will be collected . 
 You will receive an infusion of trastuzu mab into the IV lin e.  The amount of trastuzumab you 
will receive is less than what is given as a standard treatment dose.  This dose of trastuzumab is 
not intended to treat you but only to saturate or fill up the normal cells in your body so that the 
cancer cells will be ready to receive the 89Zr-trastuzumab.   
 Following the infusion of trastuzumab you will be monitored for approximately [ADDRESS_421676] any reactions.  Your vital signs may be checked several times during this 
monitor ing period.  
 You will be transported to the  positron emission tomography  (PET) facility for injection of 89Zr-
trastuzumab.   
 At the PET facility and before the injection of 89Zr-trastuzumab , an electrocardiogram (ECG or 
tracing of your heart) will be obtained along with your vital signs.  For this test, up to 12 self -
adhesive electrodes (small blunt pi[INVESTIGATOR_340653]) will be attached to your skin on your arms, legs 
and chest.  The areas where t he elec trodes will be placed will be cleaned and sometimes  the area 
may need to be shaved.   
 The injection of 89Zr-trastuzumab will be given to you into your IV line over a period of 1 -2 
minutes.  After the injection you will be monitored for approximate ly 30 minutes.  You vital 
signs will be measured and additional ECG tracing s of your heart will be taken during this time.   
 
The total amount of time you will need to be at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_340654] 3 – 3 ½ hours.  No 
PET imaging will occur on th e infusion day.  You will be transported from the chemotherapy area of 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_340655] 89Zr-trastuzumab .  This is done so the 
amount of 89Zr-trastuzumab  you will receive can be measured in a special counter immediately 
before the injection.   
 
PET Imaging – Days 1-7 
If you are in cohort 1, you will be scheduled to return to the PET facility on 2 separate days for 
imaging.  You will be asked to return at one of the following time points:  [ADDRESS_421677] imaging time point will be determined from the cohort 1 images.

On each imaging (s) day you will be questioned to see if you have had any changes in your 
medication or health since your last visit.  Your vital signs and an ECG re cording of your heart will 
be obtained along with a sample of blood  and urine for standard laboratory testing  (approximately 3 
teaspoons of blood will be drawn from a vein in your arm) .   
 
The scanner will be a combination PET/CT scanner and is used to tak e pi[INVESTIGATOR_340656].  PET 
scanners allow us to image the function of different cells and organs in the body .  The CT scan 
(computed tomogr aphy) is a type of x -ray scan  that images the anatomy (size or structure) of the 
body in two dimensions.  The comb ined PET/CT scanner is a special type of scanner that allows us 
to image both structure (CT) and function (PET) following the injection  of 89Zr-trastuzumab.   You 
will be asked to  lie on the PET imaging tab le for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_499] .  Your arms will be positioned to rest at 
your side or comfortably above your head.  Your body will be scanned from your head through your 
upper thighs.  Each scan will take approximately [ADDRESS_421678] my samples or research data to use in future research studies?   
As part of this study, we are obtaining PET/CT images o f you. By [CONTACT_340695]. We would like to use your 
PET/CT images for other research projects in the future. These future studies may provide additional 
information that will be helpful in understanding your cancer type or how the PET/CT scanner obtains 
and processes the images, but it is unlikely that what we learn from these studies will have a direct 
benefit to you. It is possible that your images might be used to develop tests, determine future 
treatments. There are no plans to provide financial compensation to you should this occur.  This means 
we will store your images and may use it for studies going on right now as well as studies that are 
conducted in the futu re.  Your images may be used to develop investigational tests, treatments, drugs, or 
devices that are not yet approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

of trastuzumab is even less than what you will receive from the trastuzumab infusion no additional side 
effects other than those listed above are expected.   
 
PET /CT Imaging:  
 Mild / Likely:    Discomfort from lying still on the imaging table  
Life Threatening / Rare:  Malfunction of worn or implanted electronic medical devices  from 
the CT scanner  
 
 
Radiation Exposure:  This study will expose you to radiation from the injection of an investigational 
radioactive drug , 89Zr-Trastuzumab and from CT scanning used as part of each PET/CT scan.  Cohort [ADDRESS_421680].  The 
radiation exposure you will receive is  equal to a uniform whole body exposure which is about 97 % 
(cohort  1) or 89% (cohort 2  HER 2 positive  or cohort 2 HER 2 negative patients who receive ECHO or no 
cardiac testing ) or 99%  (cohort 2 HER2 negative  patients who receive MUGA scan ) of the allowable 
annual dose for radiation workers.  The risk from this level of radiation exposure is too small to be 
measured and is small when compared with other everyday risks .  If you want to know more about 
radiation exposure, please see the “Radiation Fac t sheet” on the Guidelines page of the Human Research 
Protection Office website, at http://hrpo.wustl.edu or ask the study staff for a copy . 
 
Because certain research studies are subject to specific radiation exposure limits, it is important that you 
inform us if you have been in any other research studies in the last 12 months that involved exposure to 
radiation for research purposes (from x -rays, CT scans, PET scans or other nuclear medicine 
procedures).   It is also important that you tell future investigators about your participation in this 
research study if you are asked to participate in another research study.  
 
IV Placement and Blood Drawi ng: 
Mild / Likely:  discomfort from placement of the IV in your arm or hand or from the needle 
used to draw blood  
Serious / Less Likely:  There is a slight risk of bruising, some people feel dizzy or faint when an 
IV is placed or blood is drawn from them  
Life Threatening / Rare:  There is a rare risk of infection at the site of IV placement or blood 
drawing.  
 
ECG:  You may feel discomfort from the placement and removal of the electrode patches from the skin. 
Remaining still while the ECG is taken (less than 1 minute) may cause anxiety.     
 
Vital Signs :  You may feel discomfort from the squeezing of the blood pressure cuff around your arm.   
 
Reproductive Risks:  
If you are a woman of childbearing potential, you will be required to have a pregnancy test before you 
may receive the infusion of Trastuzumab or the 89Zr-Trastuzumab.

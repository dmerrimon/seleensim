2020Due to discontinuation of hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5/500 mg tablets, 
the rescue medication has been changed to 5/[ADDRESS_114832] visit.
Background 
and RationaleThe effective treatment of pain is important to both patients and to wider society; 
inadequately controlled pain negatively affects quality of life and function, and 
in a post-surgical environment, it affects the functional recovery, the risk of 
post-surgical complications, and the risk of persistent postsurgical pain.
Finding alternatives to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], can expand safe and effective options in pain 
management to meet this important public health need and help to reduce the 
public health burden from adverse outcomes related to prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].
Meloxicam is a member of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
group of medications that exhibit anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity in 
clinical studies. NSAIDs have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of acute 
pain, however current oral formulations of meloxicam are not suitable for the 
treatment of acute pain due to a relatively slow absorption. In contrast, an IV 
formulation of meloxicam has recently demonstrated efficacy in models of acute 
pain.
Meloxicam [Co-crystal of Meloxicam: Salicylic acid (1:1)] (hereafter 
MECC-SA) is being developed to provide a rapid absorption of meloxicam from 
an oral dose. 
This is the first assessment of efficacy of MECC-SA in subjects with acute pain; 
however, it is anticipated to provide analgesia to these subjects due to the rapid 
absorption demonstrated in Study The efficacy dose-response 
profile of MECC-SA is currently unknown and the purpose of this study is to 
establish an understanding of the dose-response relationship for this formulation.
The dental pain model is considered an ideal model of post-surgical acute pain 
as it has high assay sensitivity and is highly predictive of efficacy in later stage 
models. It is also ideal as the surgery, the anesthetic regimen, and perioperative 

Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 4 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 Confidentialcare protocols can be standardized across patients. The dental surgical model has 
demonstrated the efficacy of analgesic medications across a range of different 
pharmacology, including NSAIDs and opi[INVESTIGATOR_50942], more specifically, has 
demonstrated efficacy for an IV formulation of meloxicam.

Methodology This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 
dose-response study, randomizing approximately [ADDRESS_114834] had dental surgery (removal of ≥[ADDRESS_114835] molars) performed. Subjects 
will receive study drug on Day 1.
The study design is consistent with research design recommendations of the 
IMMPACT (Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in 
Clinical Trials) group for trials involving subjects with short-duration acute pain.
Subjects will attend screening at Visit 1, to occur within [ADDRESS_114836] the operation performed on Day 1 using appropriate local 
anesthesia and sedation (performed using nitrous oxide and a local injection of 
lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]). Subjects will also receive prophylactic antibiotics 
post-surgically.
Pain Intensity (PI) (using a 0-10-point numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) where [ADDRESS_114837] pain imaginable) will be assessed during the 
[ADDRESS_114838] scores a NPRS ≥5 and a rating of 
moderate or severe pain on a 4-point categorical pain rating scale (i.e., none, 
mild, moderate, severe) during this time they will be eligible for randomization. 
A diary will be used to record the pain scores.
Subjects will be randomized to receive either MECC-SA (10 mg QD, 
15 mg QD, 10 mg BID or 15 mg BID) or placebo. 
Dosing of study medication must be within 15 minutes of the eligible pain score.
PI [INVESTIGATOR_103835] (NPRS) will be measured at 15, 30, and [ADDRESS_114839] dose of study medication, as 
well as immediately before any rescue medication and/or at the time of early 
termination.
Pain relief assessment (using a 5-point scale - none = 0, slight = 1, moderate = 2, 
good or a lot = 3, and complete = 4) will be measured at 15, 30, and [ADDRESS_114840] dose of 
study medication, as well as immediately before any rescue medication and/or at 
the time of early termination.
A Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of pain control will be made at [ADDRESS_114841] dose, rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 to 4, where 0-poor, 1-fair, 
2 good, 3-very good, or 4-excellent and/or at the time of early termination. 
The times to first perceptible relief and meaningful pain relief will be determined 
using the double-stopwatch technique. The time to onset of first perceptible 
relief (time that the first watch is stopped) is defined as the post dose time at 
which the subject first begins to feel pain relief. The time to meaningful pain 
relief (time that the second watch is stopped) is defined as the post dose time at 
which the subject begins to feel meaningful pain relief. 
Rescue medication of immediate release hydrocodone/acetaminophen will be 
allowed at any time, but subjects will be encouraged to wait until at least [ADDRESS_114842] dose at Day 1.
Subjects will be discharged from the clinic following the 24-hour assessments; if 
the subject requires a longer duration of in-patient assessment due to reasons 
associated with the surgery this is acceptable.
A final follow up telephone call will occur approximately [ADDRESS_114843] will include those related to gastrointestinal 
(GI) AEs, particularly bleeds and those related to serious cardiovascular (CV) 
events.
Unless consent is withdrawn, subjects who prematurely terminate study drug 
will have discharge procedures performed at that time or at an early termination 
(ET) visit scheduled as soon as possible.
Study 
TreatmentTreatments to be received during the study will include one of the following 
treatment arms:
1. MECC-SA 15 mg QD.
2. MECC-SA 10 mg QD.
3. MECC-SA 15 mg BID.
4. MECC-SA 10 mg BID.
5. Placebo BID.
To maintain the blind due to differences in appearance between the tablets, 
subjects will receive in a double dummy design, two tablets when dosed (one 
that is representative of a 10 mg tablet and one that is representative of a 15 mg 
tablet). Due to the double dummy design, neither the subject, nor the 
Investigator will know what treatment a subject receives. To maintain the blind 
between QD and BID arms, subjects assigned to QD arms will receive placebo at 
the second dose. Per the clinic procedures, subjects will also be blindfolded 
during dosing.

Planned 
Number of 
SubjectsN=110 subjects (N=22/treatment arm) to give approximately N=100 evaluable 
subjects for the primary endpoint (N=20/treatment arm).
Statistical 
MethodsThe primary efficacy endpoint is the overall (summed) pain intensity difference 
over 0-24 hours (SPID 0-24).
 
 
 
 
 
 

Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 10 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 Confidential 
 
 
To analyze the primary endpoint, a 3-parameter E max model will be fitted to the 
SPID 0-24 standardized means (observed mean for each dose and placebo 
divided by [CONTACT_103884]) for placebo and [ADDRESS_114852] sizes will be 
estimated from the E max model together with their 95% confidence intervals and 
p-values. Baseline pain intensity score (PI) will be used as a covariate in the E max 
model. The numerical dose values will be 10, 15, 20, 30 and 0 for 10 mg QD, 
15 mg QD, 10 mg BID, 15 mg BID and placebo respectively.
Additional models may be explored utilizing a Multiple Comparison Procedure – 
Modeling (MCP-Mod) approach.
If the E max model fails to converge, and no other suitable models are identified 
using MCP-Mod, an Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to assess 
the difference between treatment groups for SPID 0-24. The ANCOVA model 
will include treatment and study site as fixed effects and baseline PI [INVESTIGATOR_103840] a 
covariate. The difference between MECC-SA and placebo will be estimated 
from the least squares means (LS means) along with the 95% confidence interval 
(CI) and associated 2-sided p-values. In addition, the standardized effect sizes 
for each dose will be calculated by [CONTACT_103885].
PK parameters for meloxicam and salicylic acid (C max, pAUC 0-4, pAUC 0-24) will 
also be calculated.

Protocol MECC-TBZ-[ADDRESS_114868]-operative pain.
1.2 Background and Rationale
The effective treatment of pain is important to both patients and to wider society; 
inadequately controlled pain negatively affects quality of life and function, and in a 
post-surgical environment, it affects the functional recovery, the risk of post-surgical 
complications, and the risk of persistent post-surgical pain [1].
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_103842], sometimes unnecessarily or 
inappropriately, leading to extensive misuse of these powerful medications and culminating 
in the current health crisis. It is estimated that [ADDRESS_114869] to the US economy of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_103843] $504 billion [ 2], with a drug overdose rate in 2015 of 16.3 per 100,000 [3], increasing to 
21.7 per 100,000 in 2017 [4]. Clearly the misuse of opi[INVESTIGATOR_103844] a huge impact both on 
individual patients and their families but also on the wider society. The Centers for Disease 
Control have also determined through a meta-analysis that opi[INVESTIGATOR_103845] a greater likelihood of long-term opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] [5]. Therefore, 
reducing opi[INVESTIGATOR_103846]. Advice 
from groups such as Washington State Agency Medical Directors’ Group is that post-surgical 
use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_103847] [6].
Alternatives to opi[INVESTIGATOR_103848]. 
Meloxicam is a member of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) group of 
medications that exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic and analgesic activity in clinical 
studies. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment 
of chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis [7] and acute 
pain [8]; [9]. NSAIDs are currently recommended by [CONTACT_103886] [10] and have indications for the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA); however, most recent treatment guidelines for RA have focused on disease 
modification rather than analgesia [11]; [12]. NSAIDs are considered generally safe for 
short-term use with the following exceptions: patients with NSAID-exacerbated respi[INVESTIGATOR_23697], patients with prior myocardial infarction who are receiving antithrombotic therapy, 
patients with asthma, and patients with a history of renal disease [13].
The apparent primary mechanism of action of meloxicam, and of other NSAIDs, is the 
reduction of prostaglandin (PG) production through its inhibitory activity against 
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 24 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 Confidentialcyclo-oxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) [14]. Meloxicam is currently approved in oral 
formulations in [LOCATION_003] as a treatment for chronic diseases: osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, 
and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis pauciarticular and polyarticular course (at the 7.5 mg dose 
only in children that weigh ≥60 kg). An IV formulation of meloxicam is currently approved 
in [LOCATION_003] for the management of moderate-severe pain. 
Meloxicam is available in tablet form; (MOBIC® [Boehringer Ingelheim] and various generic 
forms and QMIIZ® orally disintegrating tablets [Tersera Therapeutics]) and in capsule form 
(VIVLODEX® [Iroko Pharmaceuticals]). MOBIC is approved at doses of 7.5 and 15 mg once 
per day and VIVLODEX is approved at doses of 5 and 10 mg once per day. Meloxicam has 
been extensively studied in humans as MOBIC and VIVLODEX in chronic pain indications, 
including osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Meloxicam has also recently been approved 
by [CONTACT_103887]® (Baudax Bio, Inc) at a dose of 30 mg 
for the management of moderate-severe pain.
Based on the demonstration that meloxicam is effective for the treatment of chronic pain such 
as osteoarthritis at doses of ≥7.5 mg/day and that this effect is mediated by [CONTACT_103888], a concentration of approximately 1090 ng/mL, which is similar to the steady 
state concentration of 7.5 mg meloxicam, would be considered sufficient for mediating an 
analgesic response [15]. Ex vivo assays performed on samples taken from subjects receiving 
7.[ADDRESS_114870] demonstrated an 83% inhibition of COX-2 [15].
Gastrointestinal (GI) AEs were the most frequently reported AEs in all treatment groups 
across MOBIC trials, reflective of the safety profile of meloxicam. The most commonly 
reported AEs in both short-term and long-term studies of MOBIC in osteoarthritis are 
summarized in Table 3.

Higher doses of MOBIC (22.5 mg and greater) have been associated with an increased risk of 
serious GI events,  
 
MECC-SA contains salicylic acid as a co-former, this is at a low dose (up to 11.6 mg for BID 
dosing of MECC-SA 15 mg) which is anticipated to have negligible physiological effects. 
However, it is acknowledged that salicylic acid (and acetylsalicylic acid) at higher doses can 
cause adverse effects, such as local gastrointestinal effects such as ulceration of the GI tract, 
particularly when administered with other NSAIDs. As the potential for local GI toxicity for 
salicylic acid is not known all GI symptoms should be assessed and documented.
As discussed in the most recent specific Cochrane Review of meloxicam [16] and the general 
review of NSAIDs for the treatment of acute pain [8], current oral formulations of meloxicam 
(e.g., MOBIC and VIVLODEX) are not indicated for, nor are they suitable for, the treatment 
of acute pain due to the delayed absorption of the product. 
Meloxicam however, has demonstrated efficacy in a number of clinical studies using 
intramuscular (IM) and intravenous (IV) formulations, including short-term studies in dental 
extraction [17]; [18] and post-bunionectomy surgery [19]; [20]. Furthermore, some data are 
suggestive that IM meloxicam has a more rapid onset than oral meloxicam in rheumatoid 
arthritis pain [ 21] and sciatica [22].

 especially as ANJESO 
(IV meloxicam) 30 mg has a reported C max of 7972.5 ng/mL and an AUC inf of 
121437.6 ng.hr/mL.
Acknowledging that a BID dosing regime is planned in this study, and based on the fasted 
data from Study , predicted exposure for BID dosing of MECC-SA are 
summarized in Table 6.
 

Protocol MECC-TBZ-[ADDRESS_114873].
Salicylic acid is used as the co-former in the MECC-SA tablets. Considering that meloxicam 
is a BCS Class II compound, the rate-limiting step for meloxicam absorption is solubility. 
The intended use of salicylic acid in MECC-SA is to increase the rate of absorption of 
meloxicam by [CONTACT_103889]. The dose of salicylic acid (5.8 mg and 
11.6 mg considering QD and BID dosing of MECC-SA 15 mg, respectively) used in 
MECC-SA formulation is considered as a subtherapeutic dose (approved oral clinical doses 
of acetylsalicylic acid are in the range of 50- 325 mg/day) with negligible physiological 
effects. Whilst the side effect profile of acetylsalicylic acid is well known, including local 
effects on the GI tract, it is acknowledged that the local side effects of its metabolite (via 
hydrolysis in the GI tract, liver and plasma) salicylic acid when given orally are unknown, 
although a fraction of acetylsalicylic acid is metabolized to salicylic acid in the GI tract prior 
to absorption. Considering the low dose of salicylic acid in the formulation, MECC-SA is not 
considered a new fixed combination drug.
Based upon the available data, it can be considered that salicylic acid that is incorporated into 
MECC-SA is (1) at sub-therapeutic levels with negligible physiological effects and (2) 
enhances the effectiveness of meloxicam by [CONTACT_103890]. Therefore, the product would not be considered a new 
fixed-combination drug.
The efficacy dose response profile of MECC-SA is currently unknown, and the purpose of 
this study is to establish an understanding of the dose response relationship for this 
formulation.

Protocol MECC-TBZ-[ADDRESS_114874] not been used to treat acute pain due to slow 
absorption of the drug. A rapi[INVESTIGATOR_103849] a similar overall exposure (and lower than 
that of IV meloxicam) to that of other oral meloxicam products the safety profile should be 
similar. 
This is the first assessment of efficacy of MECC-SA in subjects with acute pain, however it is 
anticipated to provide analgesia to these subjects due to the rapid absorption demonstrated in 
study  It is estimated that a 15 mg dose of MECC-SA would exceed 
1090 ng/mL within 30-45 minutes of dosing, therefore acute analgesia could be anticipated at 
or around this time. Assuming linearity of exposure for meloxicam, a 10 mg dose of 
MECC-SA would exceed 1090 ng/mL at around 1.25 hours. It can therefore be anticipated 
that a 10 mg dose would achieve acute analgesia, however it may not be as efficacious as 
15 mg. 
As some studies of ANJESO [19]; [20] might indicate some loss of efficacy prior to 24 hours 
whereby [CONTACT_103891], the inclusion of BID doses of MECC-SA will assess whether BID dosing 
provides a better duration of action than QD dosing.  
 
 
 
The administration of MECC-SA 15 mg BID should therefore be 
well tolerated.
As MECC-SA will be administered under controlled conditions in a clinic-based study, the 
risks and benefits to individual subjects can be carefully assessed; rescue medication will be 
available to subjects (whether taking active or placebo) if the pain associated with the 
surgical procedure is too great post-dose.
The use of placebo in the study is appropriate to ensure that any change from baseline in pain 
assessments related to the study drug can be adjusted for the ‘placebo-response’ that is 
common in pain studies. All subjects will be allowed to use rescue medication if the pain 
associated with the surgical procedure is too great post-dose.
Complete information for MECC-SA may be found in the Single Reference Safety 
Document, which for this study is the MECC-SA Investigator’s Brochure.

(Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials) group for trials 
involving subjects with short-duration acute pain [23].
The dental surgical pain model has been in widespread use for over 50 years, is well 
characterized, and is frequently used to investigate the pharmacodynamic properties of 
analgesic molecules (onset/offset, dose response, and potency). Efficacy in the dental model 
is highly predictive of efficacy in later stage models and has a high assay sensitivity [24]. The 
model is also ideal as the surgery, the anesthetic regimen, and perioperative care protocols 
can be standardized across patients. 
The dental surgical pain model has demonstrated the efficacy of analgesic medications across 
a range of different pharmacology, including NSAIDs and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] [24] and specifically has 
demonstrated efficacy for an IV formulation of meloxicam [18] recently approved as 
ANJESO.
This study will specifically identify if MECC-SA has efficacy in a model of acute 
post-operative pain and will enable the identification of the most appropriate dose and regime 
of MECC-SA to continue in development.

Protocol MECC-TBZ-[ADDRESS_114899] (e.g., max/min thermometers) should be checked immediately for any 
temperature excursions. Devices used for temperature monitoring should be regularly 
calibrated. Affected material must be placed into quarantine until the impact of the excursion 
has been assessed and confirmed by [CONTACT_103897]. 
The investigator must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or other 
disposition of the study drug. If Mylan supply drug accountability forms these must be used. 
Alternatively, Mylan may approve use of standard institution forms. In either case, the forms 
must identify the study drug, including batch or code numbers, and account for its disposition 
on a subject-by-subject basis, including specific dates and quantities. The forms must be 
signed by [CONTACT_47510], and copi[INVESTIGATOR_103852].
At the end of the study, Mylan will provide instructions as to disposition of any unused 
investigational product. If Mylan authorizes destruction at the study site, the investigator 
must ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental 
regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by [CONTACT_103897]. Destruction 
must be adequately documented.
5.[ADDRESS_114900] Identification (SID) number, randomization number and study 
medication, as well as site drug inventory control will be managed by [CONTACT_103898]/Web Response system (IVRS/IWRS). A manual containing complete 
instructions for internet or telephone access and use will be provided to each site prior to 
study start. At their first clinic visit, the IVRS/IWRS will assign a SID. Each SID will be 
unique and serve as the primary subject identifier throughout all phases of the study. The SID 
must appear on all CRF pages, source documents, laboratory data, ECG and diary data. 
Subjects qualifying to enter the study drug treatment phase, will be assigned an additional 
“randomization number” by [CONTACT_21926]/IWRS at randomization. Subjects will be allocated to 
treatment within blocks for the given allocation ratio.
At Visit 2 (Day 1) eligible subjects will be randomized to receive MECC-SA (10 mg QD, 
15 mg QD, 10 mg BID or 15 mg BID) or matching placebo in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio through the 
IVRS/IWRS.
5.[ADDRESS_114901] unblinding will be managed by [CONTACT_103899]/IWRS. 
Protocol MECC-TBZ-[ADDRESS_114902]-Dose
Rescue medication of immediate release hydrocodone/acetaminophen (5/325 mg) will be 
allowed to treat breakthrough pain, subjects will be encouraged to refrain from rescue 
medication until at least 1-hour post-dose. A dose of rescue medication will be allowed as 
needed up to once every two hours. A maximum of 6 tablets (equivalent to 30 mg 
hydrocodone and 1950 mg acetaminophen) will be allowed; if a subject requires greater than 
this the subject should be withdrawn from the study.
Pain Intensity will be measured immediately before any rescue medication is administered.
5.8 Concomitant Medications
All concomitant medications taken during the study (from signing informed consent to 
post-study follow-up) must be recorded with indication, daily dose, and start and stop dates of 
administration in the CRF. All subjects will be questioned about concomitant medication at 
each clinic visit and at follow up.
Medications taken prior to dosing with study medication will be documented as a prior 
medication. Medications taken after dosing with study medication will be documented as 
concomitant medications.
Subjects will abstain from all prohibited medications as described in the exclusion criteria 
section of this protocol (Section 4.2.2). Use of prohibited medication during the study will be 
deemed a protocol deviation and such subjects will be assessed by [CONTACT_103900] (e.g., for safety reasons – see 
Section 4.2.3).
5.[ADDRESS_114903]. Accelerated removal 
of meloxicam by 4 g oral doses of cholestyramine given three times a day has been 
demonstrated in a clinical trial [ 25].
5.10 Treatment Compliance
Subjects will be dosed in the clinic on Visit 2 (Day 1) of the study, a visual check of the 
subject’s mouth and hands will be made to ensure compliance of dosing.
[ADDRESS_114904] the nature, purpose, and risks of the study 
explained to them by [CONTACT_093]. They will be provided with a written copy of the 
informed consent form (ICF) for the study and given sufficient time to consider the study’s 
implications before deciding to participate. Subjects agreeing to participate in the study will 
sign the ICF and be given a duplicate copy before undergoing any screening or pre-screening 
(if required) procedures. A unique SID will be issued at the time of consent by [CONTACT_54537]/IWRS 
system. 
Once a subject enrolls in this trial the site will make every effort to retain the subject for the 
planned duration of the trial. Clinical trial site staff are responsible for developi[INVESTIGATOR_103853]. Elements of this plan may include the following.
Thorough explanation of the complete clinical trial visit schedule and procedural 
requirements during the informed consent process and re-emphasis at each clinic visit.
A simple explanation of the key data and key time points that are critical for the trial's 
successful analysis, and the importance of all the treatment groups to the overall 
success of the trial.
Discussion at screening, and subsequent regular review of possible barriers to clinic 
visit attendance and full study participation and compliance.
Collection of contact [CONTACT_103901] (address, phone numbers, email), 
which is regularly reviewed at subsequent clinic visits.
Use of appropriate and timely study visit reminders.
Immediate and multifaceted follow-up on missed clinic visits.
In cases where the subject does not return for the rescheduled visit or cannot be reached to 
reschedule the missed visit, the site should make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_103902]-TBZ-[ADDRESS_114905]'s medical record. Should the subject continue to be 
unreachable, then and only then will he/she be considered to have withdrawn from the study 
with a primary reason of "Lost to Follow-up." For all other subjects withdrawing from the 
study, an alternative reason for discontinuation should be recorded in the CRF. Regardless of 
site plans to support and retain subjects within the trial, subjects may voluntarily withdraw 
from the trial for any reason and at any time.
For a subject that completes the study and all procedures it is anticipated that the duration of 
study would be approximately 1.[ADDRESS_114906] prior to enrollment.
6.1.1 Screening (Visit 1)
Subjects will commence screening procedures within [ADDRESS_114907] will need to be discussed with 
Mylan or designee to consider potential for re-screening (if re-screening is agreed, the subject 
will need to be re consented and assigned a new SID via IVRS/IWRS). Re-screening for 
other reasons may be possible following discussion with the Mylan or designee. If 
re-screening occurs this will be clearly documented within the site file.
At Screening (Visit 1), the following will be completed; procedures can be performed in a 
different order, but informed consent must be obtained prior to any procedures and the 
12-lead ECG must be performed prior to vital signs or obtaining blood samples.
Written informed consent.

Hematology and chemistry will be analyzed by a local laboratory. Urinalysis will be 
conducted at the laboratory and if urine is positive for blood, protein, nitrites, or leukocyte 
esterase, will be analyzed via microscopy/culture by a laboratory. 
Additionally a urine drug test will be performed at Screening (Visit 1) and on admission at 
Visit 2 (Day 1). If a subject has a positive test for amphetamines but is prescribed medication 
such as to treat ADHD, they would still be acceptable at the Investigator’s discretion.
Blood volumes to be collected and blood and urine sample handling instructions will be per 
the local laboratory’s standard procedures. The Investigator will provide collection materials 
for packaging and shipment of samples to the laboratory.
Any clinically significant findings in laboratory safety data should be recorded as an AE. 
Determination of clinical significance and seriousness will be based on the Investigator's 
medical judgment.
7.3.3 Vital Signs - Blood Pressure and Pulse Rate
Blood pressure (BP) and pulse rate (PR) will be measured at Screening (Visit 1), Visit 2 (Day 
1), and Visit 2 (Day 2) at times specified in Table [ADDRESS_114927]’s arm supported at the level 
of the heart and recorded to the nearest mmHg after [ADDRESS_114928]. Where possible, the 
same arm (preferably the dominant arm) will be used throughout the study.
The same size blood pressure cuff, which has been properly sized and calibrated, will be used 
to measure blood pressure each time. The use of automated devices for measuring BP and PR 
are acceptable, although, when done manually, PR will be measured in the brachial/radial 
artery for at least 30 seconds. Any clinically significant changes in BP and PR should be 
recorded as an AE. Determination of clinical significance and seriousness will be based on 
the Investigator's medical judgment.
7.3.4 12-lead ECG
In this study, 12-lead ECGs will be recorded using clinic ECG devices. ECGs should be 
collected at measured at Screening (Visit 1), Visit 2 (Day 1), and Visit 2 (Day 2) at times 
specified in Table [ADDRESS_114929] be ≤470 msec for female or ≤[ADDRESS_114930] to be 
eligible (See Section 4.2.2). 
In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead 
placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality. It is important that leads are placed in the 
same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG recordings. Any clinically 
significant ECG abnormalities measured at screening should be assessed for their effects on 
subject eligibility of the study and recorded in medical history. ECG parameters will not be 
recorded in the CRFs, but any clinically significant changes between the screening and 
subsequent ECGs should be recorded as an AE. Determination of clinical significance and 
seriousness will be based on the Investigator's medical judgment.

samples ≥[ADDRESS_114934] operating procedures.
As part of understanding the pharmacokinetics of the study drug, samples may be used for 
metabolite identification and/or evaluation of the bioanalytical method. These data will be 
used for internal exploratory purposes and will not be included in the clinical report. 
Protocol MECC-TBZ-[ADDRESS_114935] information will be provided to the investigator 
site prior to initiation of the study.
7.5 Restrictions
Study restrictions include all items listed in the Lifestyle Guidelines (Section 4.4) and the 
concomitant medications as described in the exclusion criteria section of this protocol 
(Section 4.2.2) and will be prohibited throughout the duration of the study. If concomitant 
medications change during the study, a discussion between the Principal Investigat[INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a 
Medical Sub-Investigator along with Mylan should occur, and a decision to continue or 
discontinue the subject will be made based on the medication’s pharmacology and 
pharmacokinetics.
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study 
will be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be dated and maintained 
by [CONTACT_456]. This document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any 
major modifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also be 
reflected in a protocol amendment.
8.1 Sample Size Determination

The per protocol analysis set (PP) will include all subjects in the ITT who had no major 
protocol violation that would impact on the primary efficacy endpoint. Significant protocol 
deviations are defined in Section 9.[ADDRESS_114936] of major 
protocol deviations will be finalized prior to database lock and unblinding as part of the final 
blinded data review (BDR). Data will be summarized and analyzed according to the treatment 
a subject actually received at randomization.
8.2.4 Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set
The pharmacokinetic analysis set (PK) will include all subjects who receive a dose of study 
medication and who provide at least one post dose concentration sample for the Population 
PK analysis.

Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 Confidential8.3 Statistical Analyses
8.3.1 Definition of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s)
The primary efficacy endpoint is the overall (summed) pain intensity difference (SPID) over 
0-24 hours.
8.3.2 Primary Analysis of Primary Endpoint
The primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be based on the intention-to-treat 
(ITT) population. 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the overall (summed) pain intensity difference over 
0-24 hours (SPID 0-24).
A 3-parameter E max model will be fitted to the SPID 0-24 standardized means (observed 
mean for each dose and placebo divided by [CONTACT_103884]) for placebo and 
[ADDRESS_114937] sizes will be estimated from the E max 
model together with their 95% confidence intervals and p-values. Baseline pain intensity 
score (PI) will be used as a covariate in the E max model.
The numerical dose values will be 10, 15, 20, 30 and 0 for 10 mg QD, 15 mg QD, 10 mg 
BID, 15 mg BID and placebo respectively.
Additional models may be explored utilizing a Multiple Comparison Procedure – Modeling 
(MCP-Mod) approach [27].
If the E max model fails to converge, and no other suitable models are identified using 
MCP-Mod, an Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to assess the difference 
between treatment groups for SPID 0-24. The ANCOVA model will include treatment and 
study site as fixed effects and baseline PI [INVESTIGATOR_103840] a covariate. The difference between 
MECC-SA and placebo will be estimated from the least squares means (LS means) along 
with the 95% confidence interval (CI) and associated 2-sided p-values. In addition, the 
standardized effect sizes for each dose will be calculated by [CONTACT_103907].
Impact of Protocol Allowed Rescue Medication Use
For the primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint a 2-hour windowed last observation 
carried forward (W2LOCF) approach will be used whereby [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_103857] a 
given rescue medication will be carried forward to replace the PI [INVESTIGATOR_103858] 2 hours following the rescue dose.
8.3.3 Secondary/Sensitivity Analysis of Primary Endpoint
Analyses for the primary endpoint will be repeated for the PP (8.2.3).
As a sensitivity analysis of the W2LOCF approach, a W4LOCF will also be used whereby 
[CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_103857] a given rescue medication will be carried forward to replace the 
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 59 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 ConfidentialPI [INVESTIGATOR_103859] 4 hours following the rescue dose. The analysis 
will be conducted in both the ITT and the PP analysis sets.
8.3.4 Missing Data
The amount of missing data is expected to be minimal given the short duration of the study.
Missing pain assessments for subjects who discontinued early due to lack of efficacy, 
an AE, or intolerance to study drug will be imputed using a baseline observation 
carried forward (BOCF) approach.
Missing pain assessments due to other reasons for discontinuing will be imputed using 
a last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach.
In addition to the BOCF/LOCF approaches outlined above, missing data may be 
imputed using appropriate multiple imputation (MI) methods. Further information 
will be provided in the SAP.
Intermittent missing pain assessments between two non-missing scores will be 
imputed using linear interpolation. 
The impact on the computation of the primary efficacy endpoint and the methods for 
handling missing data may be assessed in secondary/sensitivity analyses and any pre-planned 
analyses will be fully described in the SAP. As this is a Phase [ADDRESS_114938]-hoc analyses may be carried out in order to more fully understand the data.
8.3.6 Definition and Analysis of the Secondary Endpoints
All hypotheses will be tested at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. Nominal p-values will 
be presented for all secondary endpoints without adjustment for multiple comparisons (since 
this is a Phase 2 study).
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary SPID Endpoints and TOTPAR
The SPID endpoints for the time intervals 0-2, 0-4, 0-8, 0-12 and 12-24 hours will be 
analyzed using the E max/ANCOVA model used for the analysis of the primary endpoint.
The TOTPAR endpoints for the time intervals 0-2, 0-4, 0-8, 0-12, 12-24 and 0-24 hours will 
be analyzed using the E max/ANCOVA model used for the analysis of the primary endpoint.
[IP_ADDRESS] Pain Intensity Differences (PID) Over Time
PID scores over time will be analyzed using a longitudinal mixed model for repeated 
measures (MMRM) with fixed effects for treatment, study site, time, treatment by [CONTACT_103908] [INVESTIGATOR_32005]. Subject will be fitted as a random effect. Variance 
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 60 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 Confidentialestimation will be based on an unstructured covariance matrix. Missing data will be assumed 
to be Missing At Random (MAR). Least squares means (LS means) will be plotted by [CONTACT_103909]-relieving efficacy of both MECC-SA and placebo over 24 hours.
[IP_ADDRESS] Time to Event Endpoints
The following analysis methods apply to the time-to-event endpoints listed:
Time to perceptible pain relief (PPR).
Time to meaningful pain relief (MPR).
Elapsed time from the start of study medication to first rescue medication 
administration.
Time to event endpoints will be analyzed and plotted using Kaplan-Meier methodology and 
differences between MECC-SA and placebo evaluated using the log-rank test. The median 
time to event will be calculated and presented.
[IP_ADDRESS] Responder Endpoints
The following analysis methods apply to the responder endpoints listed:
Proportion of subjects with overall pain reductions from baseline of ≥30% and ≥50% 
within [ADDRESS_114939] dose based on the PI [INVESTIGATOR_103835]. Both these analyses 
will be presented for both methods of handling rescue medication use (W2LOCF and 
W4LOCF approaches).
Proportion of subjects using rescue medication during 0-24 hours.
Patient’s Global Assessment (PGA) of pain control for 0-24 hours after the initial 
dose scored on the 5-point scale will be dichotomized and the percentage of subjects 
reporting a PGA score of 2 (good) or better defined as a responder.
The number and percentage of responders in each treatment group will be summarized. A 
comparison between MECC-SA and placebo will be evaluated with the odds ratio (OR) and 
corresponding 95% confidence interval from a logistic regression model with treatment group 
and baseline PI [INVESTIGATOR_17174] a covariate.
[IP_ADDRESS] Frequency of Rescue Medication Use 
The frequency of rescue medication use will be summarized and graphically presented for the 
0-[ADDRESS_114940] dose of study treatment.
8.3.7 Pharmacokinetics
For all pharmacokinetic data analyses, the PK population will be used.
Samples for PK determination of drug concentrations of meloxicam and salicylic acid, in 
plasma will be determined by a bioanalytical laboratory using validated bioanalytical 
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 61 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 Confidentialmethods. Details of the validated bioanalytical method used will be provided in a separate 
bioanalytical report.
The plasma concentration data for meloxicam and salicylic acid will be listed, summarized on 
the basis of time intervals, and plotted using a scatter plot with time relative to the preceding 
meloxicam dosing time. Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, 
number of subjects, and coefficient of variation) will be calculated for plasma concentrations 
for each time interval and by [CONTACT_1570].
Population PK (PPK) analysis of meloxicam and salicylic acid concentrations will be 
performed using modeling. The PPK analysis will be conducted and reported separately. 
Details of the PPK model building will be described in a separate PPK analysis plan.
If the dose-response relationship cannot be established in this study (for example, no doses 
are effective, or all doses are equally effective) then exploratory exposure-response analysis 
may be conducted using individual predictions of exposure from the PPK analysis in this 
study. Outcomes from this analysis will be reported separately, if conducted.
8.3.8 Safety Analyses
Analysis of all safety data will be performed on the Safety Population and will be presented 
by [CONTACT_83352].

Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 Confidential10 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SAFETY REPORTING
The adverse event collection period begins at signing of informed consent and continues until 
the telephone End of Study (EOS) Visit. Adverse events occurring during this period need to 
be reported to the sponsor according to Section 10.3. The Investigator is also responsible for 
notifying the sponsor if he/she becomes aware of any adverse event after the study period has 
ended and it is considered related to the study medication (i.e., an adverse drug reaction). 
Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until its resolution or until it is judged by [CONTACT_28824] [INVESTIGATOR_103863].
10.1 Definitions
Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily 
have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
Note: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory or physical findings, symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.
Clinically significant changes from baseline in laboratory assessments, vital signs, and 
physical examination are to be recorded as adverse events. Clinically significant 
abnormalities include:
a result associated with accompanying signs/symptoms 
a result that requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention 
a result that leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy 
a result considered to be an adverse event by [CONTACT_103921], in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an adverse event. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does 
not require reporting as an adverse event. 
An abnormal safety assessment (e.g., laboratory, vital signs, ECG) associated with a 
clinical diagnosis that has been recorded as an AE does not require a separate AE 
entry
Events meeting the definition of an AE also include:
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 67 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 ConfidentialSigns, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug or drug-food 
interaction.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
treatment or a concomitant medication. (Please refer to the Section 10.2 for further 
details) 
A symptom or medical complication related to a protocol-mandated intervention, 
including screening procedures
Serious Adverse Event
Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious. A serious adverse event  is any AE 
that is: 
fatal
life-threatening
NOTE: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103864]: In patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31561] 24 hours in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103865]. An 
elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88909] a condition present before exposure to the study drug or a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81539] a diagnostic evaluation of an AE, does not qualify the condition or 
event as an SAE. Further, an overnight stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103866], 
organization or accommodation problems and without medical background does not need to 
be considered an SAE.
oEvents NOT to be reported as SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23741]: 
Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not 
associated with any deterioration in condition 
Treatment, which was elective or pre-planned, for a pre-existing 
condition that is unrelated to the indication under study and did not 
worsen 
Admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103867] (e.g., no access to local ambulatory medical 
care) 
Treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling 
any of the definitions of serious given above and not resulting in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103868]-TBZ-2001 Page 68 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 ConfidentialHospi[INVESTIGATOR_103869]: Rehabilitation 
facilities, Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593], Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] (e.g., caregiver relief), Skilled 
nursing facilities, Nursing homes 
results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity
a congenital anomaly or birth defect
an important medical event (medically significant)
oNote: medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether 
it is appropriate to consider other situations serious, such as important medical 
events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103870] / or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition 
above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.
oThe seriousness criterion of “medically significant” should only be selected 
when none of the other seriousness criteria apply to the event but the 
investigator still considers the event as serious.
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as 
non-serious adverse events. 
Adverse Drug Reaction
All noxious and unintended responses to an investigational product related to any dose of the 
investigational product should be considered adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The phrase 
“responses to an investigational product” means that a causal relationship between an 
investigational product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility. All AEs judged by 
[CONTACT_96949] a reasonable causal relationship to 
an investigational product will be designated as ADRs.
All AEs, with the causal relationship to the study drug reported as “possible”, “probable” or 
“definite” will be considered ADRs. If the relationship to the study drug is not given, then the 
AE must be treated as if the relationship were “possible.”
Expected/Unexpected Adverse Event
An expected AE is defined as one whose nature, severity or outcome is consistent with the 
applicable reference safety information described of the study drugs. 
An AE is to be considered unexpected if the nature, severity or outcome is not consistent with 
the applicable product reference safety information.
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 69 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 ConfidentialPreexisting Condition
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be 
considered as baseline medical history and not reported as an AE. A baseline or preexisting 
condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the frequency, intensity, or the 
character of the condition worsens during the study period.
General Physical Examination Findings
Any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse 
event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event. 
Post-study Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event
At the last scheduled contact [CONTACT_103922](s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes 
might reasonably be related to participation in this study. The investigator should notify the 
study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has 
discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study. 
The sponsor should also be notified if the investigator becomes aware of the development of 
cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has 
participated in this study. 
10.2 Special Situations
The following situations may by [CONTACT_121] a serious outcome and should be evaluated 
for expedited reporting to the sponsor.
Any diagnosis of Cancer or Neoplasm is to be reported as a serious adverse event.
Emergency Room Visits:  Events that result in emergency room visits that do not 
result in admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103871]; 
however, these events should be evaluated for one of the other serious outcomes (e.g., 
life-threatening, other serious [medically significant] events).
Overdose: Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless this is an 
intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming intent; this should be 
reported regardless of sequelae. Signs and symptoms associated with accidental 
overdose are to be recorded as adverse events or as serious AEs. If adverse events 
associated with overdose fulfil any of the serious criteria (as defined in section 
‘Serious Adverse Event’), a completed SAE report form is required to be submitted.
Reports of Drug-drug interaction and Drug Abuse and Medication Errors: drug 
interactions or abuse of the study medication must be recorded as AEs. Medication 
errors will be captured as protocol deviations while any associated signs or symptoms 
must be recorded as AEs on the CRF. In addition, any serious consequence of drug 
Protocol MECC-TBZ-[ADDRESS_114946] given that MECC-SA is an NSAID will include the 
following:
Myocardial Infarction/Unstable Angina
Stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA)
Heart Failure
Cardiac Arrhythmia (Atrial & Ventricular)
Gastrointestinal haemorrhages NEC
Gastrointestinal ulceration and perforation
Any AESI should be reported per the SAE reporting process per Section 10.5.
10.[ADDRESS_114947] seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_28812], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148]. Information on all adverse events should be 
recorded immediately in the source document, and in the appropriate adverse event module of 
the case report form (CRF). Information to be collected includes AE name [CONTACT_81620] (in 
standard medical terminology) and final diagnosis, event description, time and date of onset, 
clinician’s assessment of severity, seriousness, relationship to study product (assessed only 
by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis), action taken with the study 
drug, treatment for the event and time (if available) and date of resolution/stabilization of the 
event.
Any findings from protocol specified safety assessments that are associated with the 
indication being studied are not to be reported as AEs or SAEs, unless judged by [CONTACT_99479]’s condition. 
All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal results of diagnostic procedures should be 
grouped under one diagnosis on the CRF where possible and appropriate.
The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution or stabilization.  
Adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to 
determine the outcome. Any adverse event that occurs after the study period and is related to 
the study treatment or study participation should be recorded; and if serious, the investigator 
should also immediately report it to the Sponsor.
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 71 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 Confidential10.4 Classification of an Adverse Event
10.4.1 Severity
The Investigator will assign a severity rating to each AE. For purposes of consistency, the 
following scale is to be used:
Grade [ADDRESS_114948]'s usual function.
Grade [ADDRESS_114949]'s usual function.
Grade [ADDRESS_114950]'s usual function.
It is important to distinguish between severe AEs and Serious AEs. Severity is a classification 
of intensity, whereas an SAE is an AE that meets any of the regulatory specified criteria (see 
definitions, Serious Adverse Event).
10.4.2 Causality
For all adverse events, sufficient information should be obtained by [CONTACT_47515]. The investigator is required to assess causality 
of each AE.
An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a 
reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE. The 
Investigator must make an assessment of the relationship of each AE (serious and 
non-serious) to the study treatment(s) and record this relationship in the CRF.
Factors that need to be considered when making a causality assessment include: Temporal 
relationship, Clinical and pathological characteristics of the event(s), Pharmacological 
plausibility, Exclusion of confounding factors (medical and medication history), Drug 
interactions, De-challenge/re-challenge, Dose relationship.
A suspected relationship (definite, probable, possible) between the events and the study 
medication means, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship. Receipt of additional or clarifying information may warrant reassessment of 
causality. The Investigator is responsible for assessing relationship of AEs to study treatment 
in accordance with the following definitions:
Category Causality Description
DEFINITE Causal relationship is certain For example: the temporal relationship between 
drug exposure and the adverse event (AE) 
onset/course is reasonable, there is a clinically 
compatible response to de-challenge, other causes 
have been eliminated; the event must be definitive 
pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a 
satisfactory re-challenge procedure if necessary.
PROBABLE High degree of certainty for For example: the temporal relationship between 
drug exposure and AE onset/course is reasonable,

Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 ConfidentialCategory Causality Description
causal relationship there is a clinically compatible response to 
de-challenge (re-challenge is not required), and 
other causes have been eliminated or are unlikely.
POSSIBLE Causal relationship is 
uncertainFor example: the temporal relationship between 
study treatment exposure and the AE onset/course 
is reasonable or unknown, de-challenge 
information is either unknown or equivocal; could 
also be explained by [CONTACT_19699].
UNLIKELY Causal relationship is
improbableAnother explanation is more likely such as disease, 
environment, or other medication.
Does not represent a known reaction to study drug.
UNRELATED/NOT 
RELATEDNo possible relationship The temporal relationship between drug exposure 
and the AE onset/course is unreasonable or 
incompatible, or a causal relationship to study drug 
is impossible
For SAEs, if the relationship to the study treatment(s) is considered to be unlikely or not 
related, an alternative suspected etiology should be provided when possible (e.g., 
concomitant medications, intercurrent illness/events, study-related procedure).

RECOVERED/RESOLVED where the subject recuperated and is free of any 
pathological conditions resulting from the prior disease or injury.
RECOVERED WITH SEQUELAE where the subject recuperated but retained pathological 
conditions resulting from the prior disease or injury. 
NOT RECOVERED/NOT RESOLVED (i.e. ongoing) where the subject has not recuperated 
from the condition or injury and the event is still considered ongoing.

the principal cause of death and assign Fatal outcome to that event. Other concurrent ongoing 
AE/SAEs present at the time of death would remain Not recovered/Not resolved.
UNKNOWN can be selected if none of the other situations apply or are known. Follow-up 
should be conducted to obtain one of the preceding outcomes.

complying with their local EC’s reporting requirements. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_103874]’s study file.
10.5.4 Investigator Reporting of Pregnancy: Notifying the Study Sponsor 
All subjects who participate in the study should be counseled on the need to practice adequate 
birth control and on the importance of avoiding pregnancy during study participation as 
Protocol MECC-TBZ-[ADDRESS_114957] been exposed to the study drug(s), should be followed-up in order 
to collect information on the:
outcome of the pregnancy,
outcome for both mother and fetus (malformation/anomalies diagnosed since initial 
report)
development of the child after birth (developmental assessment, infant illnesses, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], breastfeeding)
Healthy newborns should be followed-up at 1 month after birth to confirm no congenital 
anomalies were subsequently detected (if possible).
While pregnancy itself is not considered an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or an SAE. A 
spontaneous abortion is always considered to be a SAE and will be reported to the Sponsor.
Elective termination (i.e., without medical reasons) of an uncomplicated pregnancy is 
considered an elective procedure and not an AE; nevertheless, Mylan requests the outcome 
(e.g., elective termination) be reported within 24 hours of awareness and sent as a follow-up 
on the Delivery and Infant Follow-up Form). 
Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy brought to the investigator’s attention 
after the subject has completed the study and considered by [CONTACT_103925], must be promptly reported to Mylan PSRM.
If the study center becomes aware of a pregnancy in a female partner of a male subject, study 
personnel should contact [CONTACT_103926] a partner pregnancy ICF.

Changed To
Higher doses of MOBIC (22.5 mg and greater) have been associated with an increased risk of 
serious GI events,  
 
MECC-SA contains salicylic acid as a co-former, this is at a low dose (up to 11.6 mg for BID 
dosing of MECC-SA 15 mg) which is anticipated to have negligible physiological effects. 
However, it is acknowledged that salicylic acid (and acetylsalicylic acid) at higher doses can 
cause adverse effects, such as local gastrointestinal effects such as ulceration of the GI tract, 
particularly when administered with other NSAIDs. As the potential for local GI toxicity for 
salicylic acid is not known all GI symptoms should be assessed and documented.

Protocol MECC-TBZ-[ADDRESS_114962]
Changed From
Salicylic acid is used as the co-former in the MECC-SA tablets. Considering that meloxicam 
is a BCS Class II compound, the rate-limiting step for meloxicam absorption is solubility. 
The intended use of salicylic acid in MECC-SA is to increase the rate of absorption of 
meloxicam by [CONTACT_103889].

Salicylic acid is used as the co-former in the MECC-SA tablets. Considering that meloxicam 
is a BCS Class II compound, the rate-limiting step for meloxicam absorption is solubility. 
The intended use of salicylic acid in MECC-SA is to increase the rate of absorption of 
meloxicam by [CONTACT_103889]. The dose of salicylic acid (5.8 mg and 
11.6 mg considering QD and BID dosing of MECC-SA 15 mg, respectively) used in 
MECC-SA formulation is considered as a subtherapeutic dose (approved oral clinical doses 
of acetylsalicylic acid are in the range of 50- 325 mg/day) with negligible physiological 
effects. Whilst the side effect profile of acetylsalicylic acid is well known, including local 
effects on the GI tract, it is acknowledged that the local side effects of its metabolite (via 
hydrolysis in the GI tract, liver and plasma) salicylic acid when given orally are unknown, 
although a fraction of acetylsalicylic acid is metabolized to salicylic acid in the GI tract prior 
to absorption. Considering the low dose of salicylic acid in the formulation, MECC-SA is not 
considered a new fixed combination drug.
1.4 Ethics and Benefit-Risk Considerations

The age of subjects (including those aged 16-18 years) is reflective of the population of 
subjects needing the removal of third molars. The use of NSAIDs in adolescent subjects is 
common, with side effects similar to those of adult subjects [28]; [29]. Further, the systemic 
exposure of meloxicam in adolescent subjects is similar to that of adult subjects [30].

For all pharmacokinetic data analyses, the PK population will be used.
Samples for PK determination of drug concentrations of meloxicam, in plasma will be 
determined by a bioanalytical laboratory using validated bioanalytical methods. Details of the 
validated bioanalytical method used will be provided in a separate bioanalytical report.
The plasma concentration data for meloxicam will be listed, summarized on the basis of time 
intervals, and plotted using a scatter plot with time relative to the preceding meloxicam 
dosing time. Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, number of 
subjects, and coefficient of variation) will be calculated for plasma concentrations for each 
time interval and by [CONTACT_1570].
Population PK (PPK) analysis of meloxicam concentrations will be performed using 
modeling. The PPK analysis will be conducted and reported separately. Details of the PPK 
model building will be described in a separate PPK analysis plan.
If the dose-response relationship cannot be established in this study (for example, no doses 
are effective, or all doses are equally effective) then exploratory exposure-response analysis 
may be conducted using individual predictions of exposure from the PPK analysis in this 
study. Outcomes from this analysis will be reported separately, if conducted.

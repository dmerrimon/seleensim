PRÉCIS  
Background   
• T-cell receptor alternate reading frame protein (TARP) is expressed by [CONTACT_472357] 95% of prostate cancer specimens. 
TARP is immunogenic and hence is a target antigen for vaccination.  
• The immunogenicity of TARP peptides can be augmented through epi[INVESTIGATOR_472308].  
• Two HLA -A*0201 TARP peptide epi[INVESTIGATOR_472309] T -cell 
responses: TARP27 -35 and TARP29 -37. Substitution of Val for Leu at position 9 in 
TARP29 -37, results in a peptide wit h increased binding affinity (TARP29 -37-9V) that 
induces antigen specific T cells able to recognize wild type and multiple modified TARP 
peptides. The affinity of the TARP [ADDRESS_605607] but overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_472310], is high enough t hat no enhancement was required.  
• Stage D0 prostate cancer patients have no evidence of visceral or bony metastatic disease but 
have persistently elevated or rising PSA levels (biochemical progression) and are at 
increased risk for disease progression.  Sin ce they lack much of the immune dysfunction 
associated with the high tumor burden characteristic of end -stage metastatic disease, they are 
an ideal population in which to study therapeutic vaccination to slow or prevent disease 
recurrence and progression.  
• Dendritic cells (DC) are the most potent antigen -presenting cells of the immune system and 
are being studied extensively for anti -tumor activity in a broad spectrum of cancer patients.  
• As the optimal method for therapeutic immunization with peptide vaccine s in patients with 
cancer is unclear, vaccination with TARP peptides in Montanide® ISA 51 VG adjuvant plus 
Sargramostim will be studied in a randomized fashion with autologous, TARP peptide -
pulsed DCs in HLA -A*0201 Stage D0 prostate cancer patients.   
 
Objectives  
• Determine the safety and toxicity of TARP peptide and TARP peptide -pulsed dendritic cell  
vaccination in patients with Stage D0 prostate cancer.  
• Determine the T -lymphocyte immune responses to  TARP peptide vaccination with 
Montanide® ISA 51 VG plus S argramostim or autologous dendritic cells as measured by 
[CONTACT_238062], IFN - ELISPOT and 51Cr release CTL assays.  
 
Eligibility  
• Males > 18 years of age with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

infection with full recovery); HIV negative.  
• No use of investigational agents within 4 weeks of study enrollment or use of 
immunosuppressive or immunomodulating agents within 8 weeks of study entry.  
• No other concurrent  anticancer therapy or prior prostate cancer vaccines expressing TARP or 
HLA A2.

Note: patients receiving medications for urinary symptoms such as Flomax or 5 -alpha 
reductase inhibitors (finasteride and dutasteride) on a chronic stable dose for at least 3 
months are allowed .  
 
Study Design  
• This is a randomized, prospective, pi[INVESTIGATOR_472311] a mixture of wild type 
(TARP27 -35) and epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] -enhanced (TARP29 -37-9V) TARP peptides in HLA -A*0201

available at the very end of their week 0 visit as a control vaccine to assess cytotoxic T 
lymphocyte responses.  
• TARP Peptide vaccines will be administer ed every three weeks at weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15, 
with a sixth and seventh booster dose of vaccine at Week 48 and 96.  Follow -up will be

immunologic response, then no further patients will be enrolled.  If 2 or more of these 
patients develop an immunologic response, we will accrue 11 additional patients for a  
maximum total of up to 20 patients in each arm. A stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_472312].

1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1.1.1 Primary Objectives   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Determine the safety and toxicity of TARP peptide and TARP peptide -pulsed dendritic 
cell vacc ination in patients with Stage D0 prostate cancer naïve to androgen deprivation 
therapy (ADT).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Determine the T -lymphocyte immune responses to TARP peptide vaccination with 
Montanide® ISA 51 VG plus GM -CSF or autologous dendritic cells as measured by 
[CONTACT_472361], IFN - ELISPOT and 51Cr release CTL assays.  
1.1.2 Secondary Objectives   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Determine the effect of TARP peptide vaccination on serum prostate specific antigen 
doubling time (PSADT).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Determine the effect of TARP peptide vaccination on PSA growth rate a nd regression 
rate constants.  
1.2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.2.1 Peptide Vaccines  
Elucidation of the crystal structure of the MHC and of the peptides bound 1 , and discovery of 
anchor-residue sequence motifs accounting for binding specificity of peptides to MHC 
molecules2 provided the visual and m echanistic answer to how T cells recognize antigens in the 
form of short peptides. The observation that short peptide segments (8 -10 amino acids) fit into a 
groove in the MHC molecule, combined with knowledge of the amino acid sequences of tumor 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_322], prompted the use of peptides as therapeutic agents in the treatment of cancer. These 
observations were followed by [CONTACT_472362] 3. Several s trategies have been developed both to 
improve immunogenicity and to steer the immune system toward desired types of responses. 
Peptides have been administered loaded on autologous DCs in an attempt to enhance their 
immunogenicity and improve on peptide vac cination efficacy. However, individual peptides will 
each be useful only in patients with appropriate HLA molecules presenting that peptide.  
In a study of vaccination with p53 peptide -pulsed dendritic cells in HLA -A2+ patients with 
progressive advanced bre ast cancer, a significant fraction of breast cancer patients (8/19 
evaluable patients) obtained stable disease (SD) or minor regression4.  The effect of p53 -specific 
immune therapy was supported by: [CONTACT_472363] p53 expression of tumor and 
observed SD; therapy –induced p53 specific T cells in 4/7 patients with SD but only 2/9 patients 
with PD; and significant response - associated changes in serum YKL -[ADDRESS_605610] 
two of the four melanoma peptides (MART -1/MelanA, tyrosinase, MAGE -3, and gp100) used in 
the vaccine5.  Similarly, in a phase I study of HL A-A2-bindingMUC1 peptide pulsed DC

CC Protocol 09 -C-0139  L, Version Date:  01/10/2019    
 -8- vaccination in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, development of MUC1 peptide -
specific T -cell responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was seen in the six (of twenty) 
patients with objective responses6.  Consistent with the observed correlations between induction 
of peptide -specific immune responses following DC vaccination and clinical outcomes is a trial 
of CA9 -peptide -pulsed mature dendritic cells in patients with renal carcinoma7: none of the 
immunom onitoring assays documented evidence of CA9 -peptide -specific immunity and no 
clinical responses were observed.  
1.2.2 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_472313], commonly referred to as epi[INVESTIGATOR_472314], can improve the efficacy o f vaccines through several means: 1) increasing affinity 
of peptide for MHC molecules 8-10, 2) increasing T cell receptor (TCR) triggering 11-13, or 3) 
inhibiting p roteolysis of the peptide by [CONTACT_472364] 8,14,15.  Whenever the peptide sequence 
is altered, it is important to demonstrate that the T cells induced still recognize the native peptide 
sequence.   There is precedent for epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] -enhanced peptides showing greater efficacy in clinical 
trials10. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] -enhanced subdominant peptides can by[CONTACT_472365][INVESTIGATOR_472315] c by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_472314]16. 
1.2.[ADDRESS_605611] -studied clinical model of peptide vaccination is malignant melanoma.  Rosenberg and 
colleagues evaluated vaccination with native gp100 peptide 209 -217 and found that it produced 
only low levels of T cell reactivity in 2 of 8 melanoma patients analyzed whereas an epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] -
enhanced gp100 (209 -2M) peptide generated strong T cell reactivity in 10 of 11 patients 
immunized 10.  Nevertheless, only a single objective clinical response was repo rted.   
Immunization with the epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] -enhanced peptide, 209 -2M, combined with high dose IL -2 
treatment, produced objective clinical anti -tumor responses in 42% of patients, although T cell 
reactivity was observed in <10% of patients. In the adjuvant settin g, Smith et al. 17 found a 
vaccination frequency of every two or three weeks resulted in a median frequency of CD8+ cells 
binding 209 -2M tetramers of 0.34% after 6 months compared with 0.02% bef ore vaccination, 
whereas less frequent vaccination gave substantially lower responses of 0.03%. The impact of 
age was striking.  In patients under 60 years old the median number of tetramer positive CD8+ 
cells induced by [CONTACT_472366] 0.64%, whereas in t hose over 60 it was 0.08%.  In other studies 
using this peptide, addition of either IL -12 18 or GM -CSF 19 increased this  percentage slightly.    
Immunization with tyrosinase peptide has been significantly less effective despi[INVESTIGATOR_472316]. Immunization with the tyrosinase 370D peptide in Incomplete Freund’s Adjuvant 
with or without cytokines, including IL -12 18  or GM -CSF 19, only rarely resulted in low numbers 
of tetramer positive CD8 cells or cytokine production. The levels of 370 D-responsive cells has 
been low (0.01 -0.03% of input cells) by [CONTACT_472367] 20.  The use of peptide vaccines may be 
additionally complicated by [CONTACT_472368].  Most studies used IFA but Schaed et al.[ADDRESS_605612] 50% of patients show ed low -
level ELIPSOT responses with QS21 or GM -CSF as adjuvants.  
Recent peptide -pulsed DC -based vaccines have yielded more promising and clinically significant 
results against a variety of tumors when associated with the induction of peptide specific 
immu ne responses and include: disease stabilization in pts with p53 expressing advanced breast 
cancer4; prolonged survival in subsets of patients with metastatic malignant melanoma 
Abbreviated Title:  TARP Peptide Vaccine Prostate Cancer  
CC Protocol 09 -C-0139  L, Version Date:  01/10/2019    
 -9- vaccinated with melanoma peptides5; and objective responses and disease stabili zation in 
patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma6.  In addition, HER2/ neu peptide vaccination alone 
has been associated with reduced recurrence rates in disease -free, conventionally treated, high -
risk breast cancer patients21.  These results must be  balanced against clinical trials with negative 
outcomes: a trial of CA9 -peptide -pulsed mature dendritic cells failed to show any clinical benefit 
in patients with progressive renal cell carcinoma7, while a randomized trial of autologous DC 
vaccines pulsed  with MHC class I and II -restricted peptides could not be demonstrated to be 
more effective than dacarbazine (DTIC) in patients with stage IV metastatic melanoma22.  These 
contrasting outcomes reflect the evolving understanding of dendritic cell biology an d delivery, a 
refinement of tumor antigens and peptides selected, and the optimization of patient populations 
that are candidates for therapeutic dendritic cell vaccination.  
The importance of epi[INVESTIGATOR_472317] (CEA) peptide13, using peptide -pulsed 
FLT3 ligand -expanded DCs to immunize patients with advanced colorectal cancer.  Five of 12 
patients immunized developed > 1% tetramer -positive CD8+ T cells an d two had clinical 
responses.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_472318], some principles emerge.  
Immunization with native peptide sequences is often insufficient to generate reactive T cells and 
clinical responses in most patien ts.  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] -enhanced peptides can generate T cell responses, 
but not always clinical tumor responses. Adjuvants, including cytokines and costimulatory 
molecules, improve the immunogencity of peptide vaccination.  Paradoxically, combining 
peptide vaccinati on with IL -[ADDRESS_605613] evaluated 
mutated ras and p53 pepti des in patients with lung and colon cancer.   
In study 94 -C-0031, a phase I/II trial of mutant ras and p53 peptides in a variety of cancers, both 
CTL responses and interferon -gamma responses to the peptide vaccine were statistically 
significantly correlate d with median survival times (393 vs 98 days, p = 0.04, and 470 vs 88 
days, p = 0.02, for the two types of immune response, respectively)23. 
In study 99 -C-0023, a phase I/II trial of vaccination with mutant Ras peptide -pulsed DCs in HLA 
A2.1 patients with colorectal cancer, two groups of patients were eligible for study participation: 
patients with evidence of metastatic disease and patients without evidence of disease but at high 
risk for recurrence.  One of 15 patients enrolled in the metastatic arm devel oped a detectable 
immunologic response but there were no objective tumor responses, although occasional patients 
showed regression of individual metastatic lesions.  There were no immunologic responses 
among the four patients accrued to the adjuvant arm wi thout metastatic disease.  
Abbreviated Title:  TARP Peptide Vaccine Prostate Cancer  
CC Protocol 09 -C-0139  L, Version Date:  01/10/[ADDRESS_605614] therapy, 
twelve patients were screened for the study  and two patients were eligible for enrollment.  Of the 
two patients enrolled, only one was evaluable for immune responses to p53 vaccination and there 
was no evidence of vaccine -induced immunologic reactivity.  The other patient experienced 
rapid disease progression following completion of vaccination and could not be evaluated for 
immune response.  
These trials of peptide -pulsed dendritic cells were not successful in demonstrating an acceptable 
level of immunization with mutated ras or p53.  This may be du e to the relatively low binding 
affinity of the mutated  ras peptides for HLA -A*0201; successful immunization of patients with 
peptides appears to require epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] -enhanced peptides as discussed earlier.  Another challenge 
that has made use of ras and p53 pe ptides particularly difficult is the need to treat patients whose 
tumor cells express the mutated sequences for this approach to be beneficial.  Only one in three 
patients screened for eligibility for the ras trial was eligible, increasing the amount of sc reening 
required to identify potential candidates.  In addition, in both these studies, the dendritic cell 
vaccines were administered intravenously.  It has become clear from the emerging literature on 
therapeutic dendritic cell cancer vaccination that int radermal delivery results in optimal 
immunogenicity. For this reason we have looked for other peptides that are more universally 
expressed that would be attractive targets for immunization and are administering the TARP 
peptide -pulsed dendritic cell vaccin es in this study intradermally.   
1.2.[ADDRESS_605615] cancer has recently been described 
24 .  This 58 amino acid pro tein, T -cell receptor γ alternate reading frame protein (TARP), was 
identified with the expressed sequence database.  The mRNA is initiated in the Jγ [ADDRESS_605616] cancer tissues26 and determined that TARP 
is expressed in androgen -sensitive (LNCaP) bu t not in androgen -independent (PC3) prostate 
cancer cell lines, implicating the role of TARP in prostate cancer progression27.  The protein is 
expressed both by [CONTACT_472369] 95% of prostate 
cancer specimens positiv e for its expression.  Oh et al determined two HLA -A2 epi[INVESTIGATOR_472319] T cell responses 28.  These sequences map to amino ac ids 27 -35 and 29 -37.  
TARP27 -35 was found to bind with an affinity that was 10 times greater than that of TARP29 -
37.   These peptides were demonstrated to be immunogenic by [CONTACT_472370] A2Kb transgenic 
mice (expressing human HLA -A*0201) with dendritic cells pulsed with these peptides or with 
DNA encoding the peptide.  Dendritic cell immunization produced a higher level of immunity 
than DNA immunization and as expected due to its higher binding affinity, TARP27 -35 
produced a higher level of CD8+ T cell respons e than TARP29 -37. 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_472320].  Amino acid substitutions in the TARP27 -35 peptide 
did not increase binding affinity but two amino acid substitutions in TARP29 -37 did produce 
Abbreviated Title:  TARP Peptide Vaccine Prostate Cancer  
CC Protocol 09 -C-0139  L, Version Date:  01/10/2019    
 -11- higher binding affinity peptides.  For TARP29 –37, Arg at position 3 and Leu at position 9 were 
substituted with Ala (TARP29 –37-3A) and Val (TARP29 –37-9V), respectively.  Substitution at 
position 3 with Ala in TARP29 –[ADDRESS_605617] increase in the binding affinity of the 
peptide.  Although TARP29 –37-9V showed a lower binding affinity to HLA -A2 than TARP29 –
37-3A did, substitution of Leu at position 9 with Val did enhance the binding affinity compared 
with th e wild -type peptide, TARP29 –37.  When the immunogenicity of these peptides was 
evaluated in A2Kb transgenic mice both of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] -enhanced peptides produced a higher 
percentage of CD8+ T cells specific than the wild type sequence.  It was also shown tha t T cells 
generated with the epi[INVESTIGATOR_472321]29 -37 sequences reacted with targets pulsed with the 
wild type TARP29 -37 peptide in the mouse.  
Although immunogenicity of these peptides was demonstrated in the mouse it is important to 
confirm their immuno genicity and cross reactivity in humans.  Studies of these peptides in 
human cells showed that TARP29 -37, TARP29 –37-3A, and TARP29 –37-9V were immunogenic 
in human T cells.  TARP29 –37-9V specific T cells recognize targets pulsed with all three 
peptides equa lly well whereas TARP29 –37-3A specific T cells recognized only targets pulsed 
with TARP29 –37-3A, and that TARP29 –[ADDRESS_605618] that the TARP29 –37-3A peptide w ould 
not be appropriate for immunization in humans whereas the TARP29 –37-9V would be more 
likely to generate T cells that recognize the wild type sequence.  Human T cells specific for 
TARP27 -35 recognized targets pulsed with that sequence as anticipated.  In addition to their 
ability to kill targets pulsed with TARP peptides, CD8+ T cells specific for TARP peptides were 
able to kill human tumor targets that were HLA A2 positive and that expressed TARP sequences.  
The availability of tetramers that react wit h CD8+ T cells specific for TARP provide a simple 
means of evaluating the ability to stimulate immunity to the TARP peptides.  In a limited survey 
tetramer positive cells ranged from 0.66% to 3.9% of the CD8+ T cells in prostate and breast 
cancer patients compared with .01 -.6% in normal controls.  
1.2.6 Dendritic Cell Vaccination with TARP  
This antigen will be presented on the patient's own HLA -A*[ADDRESS_605619] been found to be marginally effective when 
presenting peptides to the animal’s immune system.  This is due to the presence of vascular 
endothelial growth factor, present in many cancers, including colo rectal cancers bearing ras 
mutations, that inhibits dendritic cell maturation.  However, cells from the same tumor bearing 
animals, matured ex vivo , are extremely effective in presentation to the immune system 31,32.

Labeur et al have compared both the cell 
surface markers and the functional activity of 
dendritic cells cultured with GM -CSF and IL -

dendritic ce lls.  T cell response was monitored in peripheral blood and draining lymph nodes.  In 
patients vaccinated with peptide in adjuvant T cell responses were seen in 42% of peripheral 
blood samples and 80% of lymph nodes whereas in patients vaccinated with pept ides pulsed on 
dendritic cells 11% showed response in the blood and 13% in the nodes.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_472323].  This

cells are ineffective in producing a cytolytic T cell response compared with mature dendritic 
cells.  Another possible disadvantage with immature dendritic cells is their ability to induce 
tolerance.  This study wi ll address in a randomized fashion the immunogenicity of TARP

Following apheresis to remove peripheral blood monocytes for dendritic cell preparation as well 
as peripheral blood mononuclear cells for flow cytometry and immunologic studies at their week 
0 visit, all patients will undergo intranasal vac cination with live attenuated influenza vaccine 
(FluMist ) when seasonally available.  Attenuated influenza vaccine is being administered as a 
control vaccine to characterize the patient’s innate ability to generate immune responses to 
vaccination.  Conser ved HLA -A*[ADDRESS_605629] not received the vaccine.  Studies in children 8 -36 months of

peptides emulsified with Montanide® ISA 51 VG and GM -CSF administered by [CONTACT_472371] (SC) injection.  Patients in Arm B will receive peptide -pulsed dendritic cells 
administered intradermally in two vaccination sites.  Each peptide will be pulsed on dend ritic 
cells separately in order to assure adequate binding of the peptide and cells will not be washed to 
remove free peptide after pulsing.  Following verification of mature dendritic cell validation 
markers and release standards, the separately peptide -pulsed dendritic cells will be recombined 
for administration.  Refer to Appendix 2 for details concerning the production of peptide –pulsed 
dendritic cells by [CONTACT_472374]. Marianna Sabatino, Hanh Khuu, Susan Leitman , & David Stroncek.  
For both groups vaccinations will be administered at weeks 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 for a total of five 
vaccinations with a booster dose of vaccine at Weeks 48 and 96 . Patients will be monitored for 
immediate adverse event vaccine reactions (VS, clinical assessment) for [ADDRESS_605631]

vaccines), 18 (after 5 vaccines), 24, 36 , 48, 60 and 96 ; Note: apheresis will be performed at 
weeks 0, 24 , 48 and 96.   Refer to Appendix 3 for details of specimen tube, collection and 
Abbreviated Title:  TARP Peptide Vaccine Prostate Cancer  
CC Protocol 09 -C-0139  L, Version Date:  01/10/2019    
 -23- processing and to Appendix 4 for descriptions of the immunology assays.  Additional 
exploratory analyses of TARP immunologic responses will be performed at Weeks 60, 72, 96, 
108, 120, 132 and 144.  
 
A positive immunological response to class I TARP peptides is defined as:  
➢ A three -fold increase over baseline in the number of positive cells by [CONTACT_472378] 
➢ A three -fold increase over baseline in the number of positive cells by [CONTACT_20129] - ELISPOT 
assay.  
➢ Positive assays must be confirmed at two study time points to be considered a definitive, 
vaccine -induced positive result.  
➢ Week 24 immunologic responders  will b e allowed to receive an additional dose of TARP 
peptide vaccine at Week 36.  
➢ The study time points at which a positive immunologic response is documented will be 
noted for every patient enrolled on the study.   
 
Hence a patient will be considered a responde r if they demonstrate a positive response as 
described above in either the tetramer or the IFN - ELISPOT assays.  51Cr release cytotoxic T 
lymphocyte (CTL) assays using T2 cells as targets will only be performed in patients 
documented to have a positive te tramer or ELISPOT response and will not be utilized in the 
assessment of immunologic response.  
 
A positive 51Cr release CTL assay will be defined as:   
➢ The percent lysis observed against TARP peptides is at least [ADDRESS_605638] control peptides AND  
➢ Greater than or equal to a 10% difference in the TARPT peptide percent lysis vs. control 
peptide percent lysis at more than one effector to target cell ratio.   
5.2.2 PSADT Response Criteria  
PSADT was chosen as a  surrogate marker for biochemical response to vaccination based on the 
Prostate -Specific Antigen Working Group’s consensus Guidelines on PSADT.[ADDRESS_605639] been validated in multiple data sets,40-42  PSADT will be calculated 
using the Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer Center cancer information pr ostate nomogram for 
PSA doubling time found at: 
http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/shared/forms/Nomograms/flash/load.cfm?t ype=Prostate&width=5
86&height=505&title=Prostate%20Nomogram  recommended in the Prostate Specific Antigen 
Working Group Guidelines.  The PSADT is calculated assuming an exponential increase in 
serum PSA and first order kinetics.  The formula takes into acc ount the natural logarithm of 2 
divided by [CONTACT_472379] a linear regression of the natural log of PSA on time.  
All PSA values used in the calculation should be 0.20 ng/ml or greater and follow an increasing 
trend.  PSA values need not b e consecutively increasing and all values obtained during a 
maximum period of [ADDRESS_605640] current 
disease activity b ecause in some men PSADT may change over time. Multiple studies concur 
that men with a PSADT < 3 months are at extremely high risk for metastatic disease progression

 -24- and death with prostate cancer mortality approaching 100%; for this reason they have been 
excluded from participation in this study. In contrast, men with a slow PSADT i.e. > [ADDRESS_605641] an extremely low risk of death from prostate cancer.  
The following general guidelines39 regarding PSA determinations and calculation of PSADT 
used in this p rotocol will be adhered to (refer to Appendix 5, PSADT Calculation Guidelines)  
 
Pre-Enrollment/Baseline and On Study PSADT:  
➢ PSADT will be calculated using the Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer Center cancer 
informati on prostate nomogram for PSA doubling time found at: 
http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/shared/forms/Nomograms/flash/load.c fm?type=Prostate&w
idth=586&height=505&title=Prostate%20Nomogram  
➢ Minimum requirements for PSADT include > 3 PSA measurements over > 3 months.  
➢ The interval between PSA measurements must be > 4 weeks.  
➢ For patients receiving 5 -alpha reductase inhibitors (5ARI ) e.g. finasteride or dutasteride, 
only PSA values obtained after at least 3 months on therapy may be used to calculate 
PSADT.  
➢ Calculated PSADT values will be reported in months  
➢ The same laboratory must have performed PSA values used in the calculation of PSADT.  
➢ All PSA values used in the calculation should be > 0.20 ng/mL and follow a rising trend 
although all values need not be consecutively rising.  
➢ All values obtained over a maximum period of [ADDRESS_605642] the 
patient’s current disease activity.  
➢ PSA values obtained within < 2 weeks of instrumentation, documented infection 
(prostatitis), or radiation proctopathy should be omitted  from inclusion in PSADT 
calculations.  
On Study PSADT will be calculated at baseline and weeks 12, 24, 36, 48 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 
120, 132, and 144.  
Exploratory comparisons of percent change in PSADT will be done among the following time 
points:  
➢ Pre-Enrollment/Baseline PSADT vs. Wee k 3-12 PSADT/  
➢ Pre-Enrollment/Baseline PSADT vs. Week 24 PSADT  
➢ Pre-Enrollment/Baseline PSADT vs. Week 36 PSADT  
➢ Pre-Enrollment/Baseline PSADT vs. Week 48 PSADT  
➢ Week 24 PSADT vs. Week 36 PSADT  
➢ Week 36 PSADT vs. Week 48 PSADT  
➢ Additional exploratory analyses of  PSADT will be performed of Pre -Enrollment/Baseline 
PSADT vs. Weeks 60, 72 and 96 and Week 48 PSADT vs. Weeks 96, 108 and 144 
PSADT.

(assessed in all patients at weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, and 144.)  
➢ PSAD T response  is defined as:  
o a > 50% increase  in calculated PSADT OR

➢ Week 24 PSADT responders  will be allowed to receive an additional dose of TARP 
peptide vacc ine at Week 36.  
5.3 TOXICITY CRITERIA  
This study will utilize NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 
3.0, published June 10, 2003, for toxicity and adverse event monitoring and reporting.  (Refer to 
http://ctep.info.nih.gov/reporting/ctc_v30.html ). All clinical treatment areas will have access to a 
copy of CTCAE version 3.0.  
[ADDRESS_605643] adequate power to identify if one arm is 
associated with a significantly improved immunologic response rate as compared to the other, as 
such detection may require very large numbers of patients given the potential similarity of t he 
arms. Furthermore, there is no requirement that only one arm be selected for further 
development. Should both arms demonstrate adequate immunologic responses, then future 
studies will consider either or both arms depending on immune responses, feasibili ty, toxicity 
and other outcomes such as PSADT.  
 
Patients will initially be screened for HLA -A*0201 positivity.  HLA -A*0201 patients will then 
undergo comprehensive protocol eligibility screening and if found to be eligible, will be enrolled 
in the study.  Upon enrollment patients will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to receive TAPR 
peptide vaccination with Montanide  ISA51 VG plus GM -CSF (Arm A) or TARP peptide -
pulsed dendritic cells (Arm B).   
 
Abbreviated Title:  TARP Peptide Vaccine Prostate Cancer  
CC Protocol 09 -C-0139  L, Version Date:  01/10/2019    
 -26- For each arm, using an acceptable immunologic response rate of 4 0% (p1=0.40) and an 
unacceptable rate of 10% (P0=0.10) and using a two -stage optimal design (Simon R, Controlled 
Clinical Trials  10:1-10, 1989) with alpha = 0.05 and beta =0.10, we will initially accrue 9 
patients in each arm. An unacceptable response rate  of 10% (or less) and an acceptable response 
rate of 40% were determined based on historical clinical trial response rates to vaccines and 
immune -based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_72911].4-7  If 0-1 patients develop an immunologic response as 
defined in Section  5.2.1 , then no further patients will be enrolled.  If 2 or more of these 9 patients 
develop an immunologic response, we will accrue 11 additional patients for a maximum total of 
20 patients per arm.  If 2 -4 of 20 has an  immunologic response, then the results from this arm 
will be considered inadequate for further investigation. If 5 or more of these 20 has an immune 
response, we will be able to conclude that the vaccine on the given arm is worthy of further 
development i n this population on the basis of immune response. Under the null hypothesis 
(p0=0.20), the probability of early termination is 77%.  
 
There is no requirement that only one arm be selected for further development; should both arms 
demonstrate adequate immun ologic responses, then future studies will consider either or both 
arms depending on immune responses, feasibility, toxicity and other outcomes such as PSADT.  
 
As stated in Section  3.3.[ADDRESS_605644] exposure to excessive toxicity: If more than one of the first nine subjects on a given arm 
experiences dose limiting toxicity (defined in Section  3.3.1 ), enrollment will cease for that arm 
and revisions to the treatment will be discussed with the IRB and FDA. This is because 1/9 has 
an upper one -sided 90% confidence interval limit of 37%, while 2/9 has an upper one -sided 90% 
confidence interval limit of 4 9%; the former would be marginally acceptable as a rate of toxicity 
while the latter is not. In addition, any unusually severe toxicity noted may result in temporary 
suspension of accrual pending re -evaluation of the agent. All toxicities noted will be tab ulated by 
[CONTACT_16624], for each arm. Any such toxicities that appear in at least [ADDRESS_605645].  
 
The percent of patient s who meet PSADT response criteria as outlined in section  5.2.2  will also 
be evaluated as a secondary endpoint.  In addition, exploratory comparisons of PSADT among 
study time points will be performed as outline d in Section s 3.1 and 5.2.2 .  Given that there will 
be 6 separate comparisons of PSADT, we will only report differences with p<0.01 as being 
statistically significant  while other differences with 0.01 < p <0.05 will be considered to be 
trends. Appropriate 95% confidence intervals will be constructed and reported which takes into 
consideration the two -arm nature of the design.  No formal comparison will be undertaken si nce 
the study does not have adequate power to address this comparison properly.  
 
It is expected that 1 -2 patients per month may be enrolled onto this study. Based on accrual of 
18-20 patients per year, accrual should be completed in approximately 2 to 2.5 years if all 40 
patients were to be required. To allow for the possibility of inevaluable patients, an accrual 
ceiling of 43 will be used.

subjec t’s participation in the research  
• If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the investigator will 
provide details about the action taken with respect to the test drug and about the patient’s 
outcome.  
 
7.1.2 Suspected adverse reactio n 
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable 
possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relation ship between the drug and the 
adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
 
7.1.3 Unexpected adverse reaction  
An adverse event or suspected  adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in 
the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, 
if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the r isk information 
described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. 
"Unexpected”, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in 
the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of d rugs or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the 
particular drug under investigation.  
7.1.4 Serious  
An Unanticipated Problem or Protocol Deviation is serious if it meets the definit ion of a Serious 
Adverse Event or if it compromises the safety, welfare or rights of subjects or others.

An adver se event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view of the 
investigator or the sponsor, it result s in any of the following:  
• Death,  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life function s 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardi ze the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.

The failure to comply with applicable NIH Human Research Prot ections Program (HRPP) 
policies, IRB requirements, or regulatory requirements for the protection of human research 
subjects.  
7.1.10   Unanticipated Problem  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that:  
•  Is unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in rela tion to  
(a) the research risks that are described in the IRB -approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; Investigator’s Brochure or other study documents, and  
(b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; AND  
• Is related or  possibly related to participation in the research; AND

7.4 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
7.4.1 Principal Investigator/Res earch Team  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_472336], prospective 
randomized study, as required by [CONTACT_472381].  Based on the minimal risk and the limited number of subjects to be 
studied, monitoring by a Data Safety Monitoring Board is not warranted for this trial.  There will 
be continuous close monitoring of protocol -related toxicity by [CONTACT_472382] r.  The study research nurse coordinator and/or data manager will 
generate a bi -weekly (or weekly) reports of all on -study laboratory data with correspondent 
toxicity grading according to CTCAE v3.[ADDRESS_605650] (VRC) surveillance adverse event data for review by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_472337].  In addition, study 
summaries will be generated every 6 months and forwarded to the FDA.  Ad verse events will be 
reported to the IRB as described in section  7.2. Decisions regarding revision of the protocol or 
consent will be promptly communicated to the IRB and FDA.       
7.4.2 Sponsor Monitoring Plan  
As a s ponsor for clinical trials, FDA regulations require the CCR to maintain a monitoring 
program. The CCR’s program allows for confirmation of: study data, specifically data that could 
affect the interpretation of primary study  endpoints; adherence to the prot ocol, regulations, and 
SOPs; and human subjects protection. This is done through independent verification of study 
data with source documentation focusing on:  
• Informed consent process  
• Eligibility confirmation  
• Drug administration and accountability  
• Adverse events monitoring  
• Response assessment.  
The monitoring  program also extends to multi -site research when the CCR is the coordinating 
center.  
This trial will be monitored by [CONTACT_264347]. Monitors are qualified 
by [CONTACT_472383]. Personnel monitoring this 
study will not be affiliated in any way with the trial conduct.

Since our referral population is the nation, we should obtain referrals representative of the 
national composition of r aces.  In addition, HLA -A*0201 positivity is not restricted to a 
particular racial or ethnic group: it is present in 49.54% of Caucasians, 33.74% of African -
Americans, and 55.87% of Orientals. Hence the requirement for HLA -A*0201 positivity should 
not prec lude our ability to accrue a racially and ethnically diverse population representative of 
individuals affected by [CONTACT_472384].15  
Participants will be accrued through web -based advertisements, community -based contacts and 
referrals of patients from oth er studies at the Clinical Center.  This protocol will also be 
advertised on the NCI PDQ Clinical Trials database as well as through ClinicalTrials.gov.  
8.2 EVALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS  
The benefit of vaccination with peptides is unknown.  Alt hough several patients in our previous 
Phase I peptide vaccine studies mounted immune responses to various peptides, the benefit or 
clinical significance of these immune responses remains unknown.  However, in animal models, 
immune responses have been corr elated with both a decrease in measurable disease and a 
subsequent resistance to tumor challenge (Ref).  In this study, we will determine the impact of 
vaccination on PSADT, a well established surrogate marker that is a predictive factor of longer 
time to metastases, prostate -cancer death and all -cause adverse clinical outcomes.30-[ADDRESS_605652] frequent adve rse event is local

TARP is a 58 amino acid protein found on cells of prostate origin and i s over expressed in over 
90% of patients with prostate cancer and about half of patients with breast cancer. Because the 
peptide mimics portions of a prostate protein found naturally in the body, there is a chance for 
development of an autoimmune reaction to it and may result in the possible development of 
inflammation in the prostate gland.

9.6 MONTANIDE®  ISA  51 VG  (NSC  737063)  CLASS IFICATION :  ADJUVANT  
9.6.[ADDRESS_605666] Description   
Montanide® ISA 51 VG (vegetable -grade) is an oil -based adjuvant composed of a highly refined 
mannide monooleate (Montanide 80), a surfactant, in a mineral oil solution (Drakeol 6VR). The 
mannide monooleate is synt hesized from raw materials of vegetable origin.  Montanide® ISA 51 
VG, when mixed with an equal part of an aqueous solution, is designed to form an injectable 
water -in-oil emulsion. Comparative analysis of the chemical compositions of the previous 
animal -grade formulation (Montanide® ISA 51) and current vegetable -grade formulation 
(Montanide® ISA 51 VG) oleic acid sources shows a final product with similar chemical and 
applicative properties (e.g., emulsion stability and viscosity).  
9.6.2 How Supplied   
Montanid e® ISA [ADDRESS_605667] vials at controlled room temperature.  
9.6.4 Stability  
Montanide® ISA 51 VG  is stable at room temperature until the expi[INVESTIGATOR_472344]. The solution contains no preservatives; once the vial is entered, discard any  
remaining solution after 3 hours.  Withdraw and administer peptide vaccine emulsions 
immediately after preparation.  
9.6.5 Toxicity   
Toxicities related to Montanide® ISA [ADDRESS_605668] included erythema at the injection site, rare 
granuloma formation and low -grade fever.   
9.6.6 Peptide Vaccine Preparation   
To prepare a water -in-oil emulsion vaccine, consisting of the peptide (aqueous phase) and the 
adjuvant  Montanide  ISA 51 VG (oil phase), combine equal parts of the peptide and the 
adjuvant  and su bject the mixture to h igh sheer forces using the following method:  
 
Syringe Method of Emulsification (Investigator’s Preference): Arm A Patients 101 -110 
For preparation of emulsions of water -soluble peptide antigens in an adjuvant oil phase for 
immunization a modification of th e "double hubbed needle method" will be employed.  In this 
method two sterile 2.5 ml glass Hamilton syringes (TLL (PTFE Luer Lock) w/o slots #[ZIP_CODE], 
Hamilton Co., Reno,Nev) with Teflon plungers and male Luer Lock tip connectors are used.  
Abbreviated Title:  TARP Peptide Vaccine Prostate Cancer  
CC Protocol 09 -C-0139  L, Version Date:  01/10/2019    
 -38- The materials are  kept sterile at all times.  The adjuvant, Montanide® ISA 51 VG (0.8 ml) is 
drawn up completely in one syringe using a sterile [ADDRESS_605669] or (3/4 
inch, 24 gauge, #[ZIP_CODE], Hamilton Co., Reno,Nev) is attached to the adjuvant syringe and the 
plunger is pushed carefully to allow the adjuvant to fill the connector space. The peptide aqueous 
solution (0.82 ml total) is then drawn up into the other glass syringe with a sterile [ADDRESS_605670] achieved by [CONTACT_472395] a non -slippery surface or blue diaper. The material is 
passed back and forth between the two syringes by a rocking motion in which the plungers are 
alternately pushed in and out by [CONTACT_472396]. As the emulsion 
forms, increased resistance should be noted, the emulsion should appear homogeneous (opaque 
white) with no trapped air bubbles. Following emulsification,  almost the entire emulsion (1.5 ml) 
should be drawn up in o ne syringe, detached from the Teflon connecter assembly and a sterile 23 
gauge needle attached to the syringe. Gently push the emulsion into the needle until a small drop 
is visible at the tip.  The peptide -adjuvant emulsion is now ready for immunization.  
 
Modified Syringe Method of Emulsification: Arm A Patients 111 -120 
For preparation of emulsions of water -soluble peptide antigens in an adjuvant oil phase for 
immunization, a modification of the "double hubbed needle method" will be employed.  In this 
meth od two sterile [ADDRESS_605671] plastic Luer Lock tip syringes (manufactured by [CONTACT_472397], [LOCATION_013]) are used.  The materials are kept sterile at all times.  The adjuvant, 
Montanide® ISA 51 VG (0.8 ml) is drawn up completely in one syringe  using a sterile [ADDRESS_605672] stopcock (manufactured by B. Bruan Medical, Inc., Bethlehem, PA) is attached to the 
adjuvant syringe and the plunger is pushed c arefully to allow the adjuvant to fill the connector 
space. The peptide aqueous solution (0.82 ml total) is then drawn up into the other plastic 
syringe with a sterile [ADDRESS_605673] water -in oil -emulsion.  Peptide will then be emulsified as follows:  
➢ 20 “pre -emulsion cycles” will be performed (a cycle is defined as one bass back and 
forth between the two syringes).  The pre -emulsion cycles are to be performed slowly , 
such that 20 cycles are performed over approximately 1 minut e.  The pre -emulsion 
cycles are a necessary and important step in the quality of the final emulsion.  
➢ Following the pre -emulsion cycles, 100 additional cycles will be performed such that 
the additional 100 cycles are performed over approximately 1 minute.  
Abbreviated Title:  TARP Peptide Vaccine Prostate Cancer  
CC Protocol 09 -C-0139  L, Version Date:  01/10/2019

CC Protocol 09 -C-0139  L, Version Date:  01/10/[ADDRESS_605685] peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC) with a target number of 
at least 2.2 ×109 monocytes. Lymphocytes will also be cryopreserved. Apheresis will be 
performed in the Clinical Center (CC) Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM) using 
approved standard operating procedures. Bilateral peripheral venous access will be used for 
apheresis whenever possible. Alternatively, a temporary femoral central venous catheter (CVL) 
will be placed for collection. If this is necessary, the patient will be  admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_472349]. The CVL will be inserted by [CONTACT_472407] (e.g., Critical Care, Interventional Radiology, General Surgery) with the assistance of 
anesthesiology as indicated. The pa tient will remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_472350]. 
Prophylactic intravenous CaCl2 and MgSO4 infusions may be administered during apheresis to 
treat or prevent citrate toxicity at the discretion of the DTM physician per routine.  
 
Patient Cell Process ing 
 
All cell processing will be conducted in accordance with approved DTM policies and 
procedures.  
 
TARP Peptide -Pulsed Dendritic Cells  
 
Background:  Autologous dendritic cells prepared from peripheral blood monocytes will be 
loaded with 2 different TARP -derived peptides.  These peptides are made of amino acids 27 -35 
and 29 -37, namely TARP 27 -35 and TARP 29 -37-9V, comprised of HLA -A2-restricted epi[INVESTIGATOR_472351] T cell response. TARP 29 -37-9V contains a substitution that 
has been s hown to enhance its binding affinity. Different fractions of autologous dendritic cells 
will be pulsed individually with only one of these peptides and the two fractions will be 
combined before administration to the patient.  
 
Formulation and Preparation : Autologous peptide -pulsed dendritic cell vaccines will be 
prepared under GMP conditions from cryopreserved patient monocytes. Autologous monocytes 
for dendritic cell culture will be enriched from peripheral blood MNC apheresis collections by 
[CONTACT_472408] -flow el utriation, aliquoted into at least 6 vials with ~ 333 x 106 cells/vial and 
cryopreserved for future preparation of the dendritic cell products. After thaw, the monocytes 
will be placed into a 5 day culture with rhIL -4 and rhGM -CSF to generate immature dend ritic 
cells, followed by [CONTACT_472409] -, and pulsed with TARP 
peptide. After removing peptide -pulsing media, dendritic cells will be concentrated down at 40 x 
106 cells/ml in infusion media (Plasma -Lyte A containing 10% au tologous heat inactivated 
plasma).  The final peptide -loaded, volume -reduced mature dendritic cell product will be 
prepared in sterile syringes for fresh administration intradermally.  A validated manufacturing 
process described in the Department of Transfu sion Medicine, Clinical Center, NIH standard 
operating procedures will prepare the dendritic cell vaccine product. Detailed standard operating 
procedures for processing, labeling, storage, and quality assays are available on site in the Cell 
Processing Sec tion of the Department of Transfusion Medicine.

 -51- Appendix 4 Description of Immune Response Assays  
 
Monitoring of humoral and cellular immunologic responses will be performed at study weeks 0, 
12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60, 96, 108, 120, 132, and 144.  Apher esis to ensure adequate numbers of 
cells for dendritic cell vaccine preparation (subjects randomized to Arm B) and for assessment of 
immunologic responses (all subjects) will be performed at weeks 0, 24, 48 and 96.  The 
procedures involved in each assay ar e outlined below.  
 
Separation of PBMCs  
 
At week 0 and subsequent non-apheresis  time points (weeks 12, 18, 36, 60, 72, 84, 108, 120, 
132, and 144) blood will be drawn for immunological assays in 6 10ml green top tubes 
containing heparin.  This will be divid ed into aliquots, diluted with PBS 1:2 and 12 mls of 
Ficoll -Hypaque will be layered under 30 ml of the diluted patient sample.  The cells will be spun 
at 2000 rpm for 30 minutes.  The cells at the interface of the ficoll and the serum will then be 
collecte d and washed X 2.  
 
Tetramer Assay (All Patients)  
 
Utilizing HLA A2.[ADDRESS_605687] vaccination will be stained with these tetramers and the 
precursor frequency (if a ny) will be determined at baseline and following TARP vaccination.  
 
IFN- ELISPOT Assay (All Patients)  
 
Lymphocytes will be separated from heparinized blood using density gradient centrifugation and 
then be placed in human AB serum with 10% DMSO for storag e in liquid nitrogen.   At week 24, 
samples from weeks 0, 12, [ADDRESS_605688] -vaccination peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).  Additional ELISPOT assays will be preformed using samples 
from weeks 0, 24 and 48 as well as extension year (48 -96 and 96 -144) timepoints.  
 
Briefly, 96 -well MultiScreenTM -HA (n itrocellulose) plates are coated with capture mAb against 
human IFN -
 overnight at RT.   Effectors will be thawed and cultured overnight in RPMI 1640 
plus 10% human AB serum.   Plates are washed and blocked for 2 h with RPMI 1640 plus 10% 
human AB serum.   C1R.A2, antigen presenting cells (APC), are irradiated with 20,000 rad and 
pulsed for 2 h at 37ºC with either TARP peptide, Flu matrix peptide, a negative control peptide 
(TAX peptide) or a positive control peptide (CEF peptide pool - see notes below).  Non -pulsed 
C1R.A2 APC will be incubated in tandem and will serve as a negative control.  1 x 105 PBMC 
are added to each well followed by [CONTACT_472412] - or non -pulsed C1R.A2 cells at an effector:APC ratio 
of 1:1.   Each sample is run in six replicates to control for var iability.  HLA -A2 binding Flu 
matrix peptide 59 -66 serves as a positive control for inherent cellular reactivity.   In addition, 
PBMC from two "normal" HLA -A2-positive individuals with previously determined levels of 
FMP - or CMV -peptide T -cell precursors ar e run as assay controls.  Cells are incubated for 24h 
and lysed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) -Tween (.05%).   Biotinylated antihuman IFN - 
Abbreviated Title:  TARP Peptide Vaccine Prostate Cancer  
CC Protocol 09 -C-0139  L, Version Date:  01/10/2019    
 -52- antibody in PBS -Tween containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) is added and the plates are 
incubated overnight  at 4°C. Plates are then washed and incubated with streptavidin -alkaline 
phosphatase for 2 h at RT.   Spots are visualized with BCIP -NBT substrate and subjected to 
automated evaluation using the ImmunoSpot Imaging system (Cellular Technology LTd, 
Cleveland,  OH).   ELISPOT assays will be performed by [CONTACT_472413] ([CONTACT_472426]) at NCI Frederick.    
 
NOTE:  The CEF peptide pool from Mabtech may be used as HLA.A2 positive control peptides 
as alternatives to flu matrix peptide (FMP) as an HLA.A2 positive control.  The CEF peptide 
pool is a pool of 23 HLA class I restricted T cell epi[INVESTIGATOR_472353], Epstein -
Barr virus and influenza virus. The peptide has been shown to stimulate the release of IFN -γ 
from CD8+ T-cells in individuals with certain highly frequent HLA types (HLA: A1, A2, A3, 
A11, A24, A68, B7, B8, B27, B35, B44).   Chosen epi[INVESTIGATOR_472354], whose cumulative frequencies represent >100% of Caucasian individual s. 
The 23 peptides cover 11 HLA types. The CEF peptide pool has proven useful as a peptide 
specific positive control in ELISPOT, CTL and intracellular cytokine assays using human 
PBMC. Original pool described by [CONTACT_472414]. al  
 
51Cr Release CTL Assay (Pat ients with Evidence of Positive Tetramer and IFN - ELISPOT 
Responses)  
 
3 X 106 cells/well in a 24 well plate will be in vitro pulsed for 7 days in the presence of the 
following conditions:   
1) 10 
 M of the TARP 27 -35 peptide (Native/WT peptide)  
2) 10 
 M of the TARP 29 -37-9V peptide (Epi[INVESTIGATOR_472307])  
3)  
   flu matrix peptide (lower concentration due to potent stimulation 
peptide).   
 
On day one 1000 U/ml IL -7 will be added and on day three cultures will be supplemented with 
20 IU IL -2/ml.  On d ay 7, cells will be harvested and plated to result in fixed effector to target 
cell ratios.  Cells initially cultured with native or epi[INVESTIGATOR_472355] [ADDRESS_605689] targets pulsed with 1 µM flu matrix peptide and 50 µM of 
TAX negative control peptide, and 50 µM of CEF positi ve control peptide. Targets will be 
labeled with 150 
 Ci [51Cr] sodium dichromate.  All target cells will then be washed three times 
and 3,000 labeled targets aliquoted into each well in a 96 -well tissue culture plate that has 
already been plated with effe ctor cells.  At this point, both the effector and target cells will be 
suspended in complete T cell medium with 10% fetal calf serum and with a 10 fold excess of 
K562s (over targets).  The plate will be incubated at 37o C for four hours.  Supernatants will  be 
harvested using a Skatron supernatant harvesting device and the samples counted on a gamma 
counter.  Spontaneous release values will be obtained by [CONTACT_472415] X -100.   
 
The percent specific lysis is determined, on triplicate samples, by [CONTACT_51632]:  percent 
specific lysis = 100 X (experimental release - spontaneous release)/(maximum release - 
Abbreviated Title:  TARP Peptide Vaccine Prostate Cancer  
CC Protocol 09 -C-0139  L, Version Date:  01/10/2019    
 -53- spontaneous release).  The percent specific lysis of targets with TA RP  and control peptide will 
be compared to the percent specific lysis of targets without peptide.  If these are significantly 
different using student’s t test and if there is a greater than 10% difference at more than one 
effector:target ratio, we will co nsider the CTL assay to be positive.   
 
NOTE Regarding Immunologic Response Testing:  Assays will be run in batch for specimens 
from weeks 0. 12, 18 and 24.  Samples with reactivity at week 24 will be used as a comparator 
control for batch assays for speci mens run from weeks 36, 48 60 and 96.  
 
Restimulation Assay Following Apheresis at Weeks 0, 24, 48 and 96 (All Patients)  
 
The restimulation assay will be performed by [CONTACT_472416].  Once apheresis is collected, prior to  monocyte elutriation  (week 0 only), 10 ml of 
apheresed PBMCs should be sent to the NCI Frederick Clinical Support Laboratory for 
processing.  These cells will be placed in a three week cytotoxicity assay in which they are 
stimulated repeatedly with the mi xture of TARP peptides with which they were vaccinated and 
flu matrix peptides as a control. A fraction will also be cryopreserved for future immunologic 
assays.  Following these repeated stimulations, cells with then be tested on targets pulsed with 
each of these three peptides and on HLA A2.1 positive tumor cells expressing TARP.  
 
Lymphocyte Subsets for FACS Analysis  
 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be tested for the following markers via flow cytometry; 
CD3, CD4, CD8, CD3 -/CD16/56+, CD3+/CD16/CD 56+.  Additional testing will be done on all 
patients in the research laboratory.  We plan to use these markers to determine whether 
vaccination has caused a change in the number of these cells circulating in the peripheral blood 
and in the expression of c ell surface markers.  This assay will require three purple top tubes.  
 
Multiparameter Flow Cytometric Analysis of NKT Cells  
 
Analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_80959]. Jane Trepel. NKT cells will be identified by 
[CONTACT_472417].  Ma rkers may include, but are not limited to, Va24, Vb11, CD3, 
CD1d tetramer, CD4, CD8, and Hoechst [ZIP_CODE] for identification of viable cells.  If sample 
permits, PBMC may be placed in culture for NKT cell activation, i.e. with -galactosylceramide, 
incubated at 37 C, and intracellular cytokines such as IFN -, IL-4, IL -13 may be evaluated 
using multiparameter flow cytometry.  If sample permits, immune cell subsets that contribute to 
regulation of the NKT axis, i.e. Tregs, may be analyzed.

Measurement of Function -Associated mRNAs in Whole Blood: [CONTACT_472427].  
 
To be performed on the last 10 subjects enrolled in the 09 -C-0139 TARP vaccine study.  
 
Function -Associated mRNAs:   One 10ml green top sodium heparin tube  
(Weeks 0, 12, 18 and 24)  
 
➢ Blood will be drawn into one 10ml green top tube.  
➢ Add 60 L each of blood into three 8 -well strips (provided by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Mitsuhashi). Strips 
contain PHA, HAG, PBS, rI L2, rIFN , CEF, LPS/ZA, TARP27 -35 and TARP EE -29-
37). 
➢ Incubate at 37 C for 4 hours.  
➢ Store in -80C freezer until ready for shipment to [CONTACT_472428]  
➢ Note:  specimen should be drawn before 1pm to allow adequate time for specimen 
processing and four hour in cubation by [CONTACT_472420].

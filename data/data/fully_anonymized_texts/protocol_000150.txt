SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX007-CL202 Amendment 1 
16 April 2015 
 
 
The Protocol UX007- CL202 (dated 14 July 2014) has been modified by [CONTACT_11827] [ADDRESS_550995] also been made to provide supportive information and rationale for the proposed changes (along with minor edits for consistency and clarity) but are not det ailed in this summary.  
1. Sponsor’s Responsible Medical Officer and associated Medical Monitor contact [CONTACT_3031] ( title page and Section 10) have been updated to: 
 
2. A study schematic was added to the synopsis and the body of the protocol. 
Rationale: A study schematic will assist the reader in visualizing the course of the 
study.  
 
3. Inclusion Criterion 2 (synopsis and Section  7.3.1) was updated to allow inclusion of 
patients who have failed conventional therapy and who ha ve documented severe 
unmet need. Similar changes were made to Sections 7.1, 7.3, and 7.6.5 
Rationale: This change was made to allow inclusion of patients with sev ere unmet 
need not previously eligible for this study.  
 
4. Inclusion Criterion 7 (synopsis and Section  7.3.1) was updated to provide additional 
detail as to the acceptable methods of contraception required for inclusion into this 
study. A similar change was made in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
 
Rationale:  This change was made to clarify the contraception language. 
 
5. Added Exclusion Criterion Number 2 indicating that p atients qualifying for any other 
clinical trial designed to progressively evaluate the safety and efficacy of triheptanoin in LC-FAOD are not eligible for this study . 
Rationale:  This change was made for clarification. 

Protocol Number:  UX007- CL202  
Amendment 1:  16 Apr 2015  
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 3 
6. Exclusion criterion Number 4 in the synopsis and Section 7.3.2 was updated to 
exclude breastfeeding mothers from participation in this study.  
Rationale: This change was made for clarification and to ensure that breastfeeding 
mothers are not enrolled into the study.  
7. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_210664]  [IP_ADDRESS] were updated to state that Regulatory A uthorities, 
as well as Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and Ethics Committees (ECs), will be 
informed should unexpected and possibly, probably, or definitely drug- related SAEs 
occur and /or if the study is paused or stopped. Language was also added stating that, 
if paused or stopped, the trial will only be restarted following approval by [CONTACT_18332] .  
 
Rationale: This change was made to clearly convey that Regulatory Authorities will 
be contact[CONTACT_435044]. 
 
8. The Peabody Developmental Motor Scales  (PDMS) and the Cli nical Global 
Impression (CGI) scales were removed as efficacy variables in the study . 
Rationale: The PDMS was removed  because gross motor function does not appear to 
be a problem for younger FAOD patients. The CGI scales were removed  because pre-
treatment assessments for comparison are not available for this pool of patients. 
Removal of these assessments will also alleviate patient burden. 
9. A visit window of ±1 week was added to the phone visits in the schedule of events.  
Rationale: This change was made to reduce site and patient burden. 
10. The definitions for AE relatedness were updated in Section  8.5.3. 
Rationale: This change was made to standardize the definitions across protocols. 
11. Text was added to Section 8.5.1 noting that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_435020] (e.g. for elective surgeries) are not considered SAEs. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11819] -existing conditions that are schedule d after study enrollment are 
considered SAEs. 
Rationale: This change was made for clarification. 
12. Sections 8.5.1, 8.5.4, 8.5.5, and 8.5.6 were updated to define the sponsor’s 
responsibilities with regard to re porting SAEs/S[LOCATION_003]Rs.  
Rationale:  These changes were made in accordance with European Directive 
2001/20/EC.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX007-CL202 Amendment 2 
21 Dec 2015 
 
 
The Protocol UX007- CL202 (dated 16 April 2015) has been modified by [CONTACT_11827] [ADDRESS_550996] also been made to provide supportive information and rationale for the proposed changes (along with minor edits for consistency and clarity) but are not detailed in this summary.  
1. Updated the medical director contact [CONTACT_18904] , MD to , 
DO. This change affected Sections 8.5.7, 10, and the cover page.  
 
2. Changed the term “Screening” to “ Baseline” in Exclusion Criterion Number 4. 
Similar changes were made to Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and 8.1.1. 
Rationale: This change was made to clarify an earlier oversight.  
 
3. Deleted the sentence: “For subjects completing the UX007-CL201 study, the last 
evaluable ECHO will serve as Baseline for this study ” in Footnote 7 of Table 2.1 an d 
in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Rationale: Since t he last echocardiogram (ECHO) in the UX007-CL201 study is 
performed at week [ADDRESS_550997] transpi[INVESTIGATOR_435021] 
a repeat ECHO (UX007-CL202 requires an ECHO be performed annually).  
  
4. Additional detail was added to Table 2.1 (Footnote 6) re garding the performance of 
the 12MWT.  
 
Rationale: This change was made for clarity and patient convenience. 
 
5. Added pancreatic lipase inhibitors and  removed oral salicylates from the list of 
prohibited medications.  
Rationale:  Pancreatic lipase inhibitors were added as prohibited medications 
because in vitro studies have shown that pancreatic lipases hydrolyze triheptanoin; 
therefore inhibitors of pancreatic lipases (e.g. orlistat) should be avoided while taking UX007. Salicylates are not routinely prescribed in children because of concern

for potential association with Reye’s syndrome; however, they may be used at the 
physician’s discretion. They may also be recommended as low dose daily treatment for adult subjects with risk for cardiovascular disease or those at risk for colon cancer. 
6. Updated text in Sections 7.5.4 (Safety Measures & General Assessments ) and [IP_ADDRESS] 
(Adverse Events).  
Rationale:  This change was made for clarification.

The Protocol UX007- CL202 (Version 2 dated 21 December 2015) has been modified by 
[CONTACT_11827] [ADDRESS_550998] of the study is summarized below.   
1. 
The protocol was updated to clarify the total duration of the study. Specifically, the phrase 
“whichever occurs first” was included indicating that patients will be treated with “UX007 
for up to 3 years or until market approval , whichever occurs firs t.” This change affects  the 
synopsis (Rationale, Study Design and Methodology, and Duration of Treatment) , Section 5, 
Section 5.4 , Section 7.1, and Section 7.4.4. 
Rationale: This change was made per guidance from Regulatory Authorities and for 
clarification .

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  
SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX007-CL202 Amendment 4 
16 September  2016 
 
 
The Protocol UX007- CL202 (Version 3 dated 12 April 2016) has been modified by 
[CONTACT_11827] [ADDRESS_550999] also been made for consistency and clarity but are not included in this summary.  
1. The length of study participation was increased to 5 years  (60 months; end of 
treatment visit).  This change affected multiple sections of the protocol including the 
schedule of events ( Table 2.1) and Section 7.1 ( Overall Study Design and Plan ). 
Rationale: This change was made to ensure subjects are eligible to continue receiving  
study medication under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_435022] [ADDRESS_551000].  
2. The following statement was added to Sections 7.1 (Overall Study Design and Plan) and 7.4.4 (Selection of Doses and Study Duration) : Subjects who switch from medium 
chain triglycerides (MCTs) to UX007 may transition at the same dose and then titrate, 
as appropriate.  
Rationale:  This change was made to ensure a safe transition for those subjects 
formerly on MCT therapy. 
3. Inclusion Criterion #2 (Section 7.3.1, and corresponding information throughout) was 
updated to specifically include treatment -naïve (i.e., naïve to both UX007 and 
food-grade triheptanoin) patients. 
Rationale:  Text was updated to provide clarification. This is not a change to the study 
eligibility.  
4. Inclusion Criterion #6 (Section 7.3.1, and corresponding information in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] [Pregnancy Testing] ) regarding pregnancy testing and contraception 
was updated as follows: 
• Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at 
Baseline and be willing to have additional pregnancy tests during the study. 
Females considered not of childbearing potential include those who have not experienced menarche, ar e post-menopausal (defined as having no menses for 
Protocol Number:  UX007 -CL202 
Amendment 4:  [ADDRESS_551001] 12 months without an alternative medical cause), or are permanently 
sterile due to total hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], or bilateral oophorectomy. 
• Participants of child -bearing potential or ferti le males with partners of 
child-bearing potential who are sexually active must consent to use a highly -
effective method of contraception as determined by [CONTACT_435045] [ADDRESS_551002] dose of study drug. 
• Examples of highly effective contraception methods w ere added to 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Rationale: The change provides clarification of study requirements. 
 
5. The 12-Minute Walk Test (12MWT) efficacy assessment was removed from the 
protocol (e .g., from Section 7.5.2 [Clinical Efficacy Measures]  and the schedule of 
events [Table 2.1]). 
 
Rationale: Continuing to use the 12MWT assessment in this open-label, single- arm 
extension is unlikely to yield informative data. Removal of this assessment will reduce the burden to subjects  and investigational sites participating in the study. 
 
6. The Pediatric Evalu ation of Disability Inventory – Computer Adaptive Test 
(PEDI-CAT efficacy assessment was removed from the protocol  (e.g., Section 7.5.2 
[Clinical Efficacy Measures ] and the schedule of events [ Table 2.1]). 
Rationale: Continuing to use the PEDI -CAT assessment  in this open-label, single-
arm extension is unlikely to yield informative data. Removal of these assessments will reduce the burden to subjects  and investigational sites participating in the study. 
 
7. A Safety Follow -up Phone Call was added to the schedule of events (Table 2.1) and 
relevant sections of the protocol (e.g., Sections 7.4.4 [Selection of Doses and Study 
Duration] and 7.5.1 [Schedule of Events]). 
 
Rationale: This change was made to align language with other Ultragenyx protocols 
based on requests from Regulatory Authorities to standardize how adverse event information is collected [ADDRESS_551003]’s Safety Follow -up 
Phone Call. This change affected multiple sections of the protocol including Sections 7.1 (Overall Study Design and Plan)  and 7.5.1 (Schedule of Events), and the 
schedule of events ( Table 2.1). 
 
Rationale: This change was made to align language with other Ultragenyx protocols 
based on requests from Regulatory Authorities to clarify the end of study.  
Protocol Number:  UX007- CL202 
Amendment 4:  16 September 2016  
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 4 
9. The statement in Section [IP_ADDRESS] (Prohibited Medications) was edited to be clearer: 
MCT oil and metabolic formulas containing significant contributions from MCT oil, 
including coconut oil, must not be used after the first dose of study medication. 
Rationale:  This change was made for clarity. 
10. Section [IP_ADDRESS] (LC -FAOD Major Events) was updated to state that if  events occur 
that represent  a substantive change in the nature or an increase in frequency from a 
subject’s prior medical history, the event should be reported as an adverse event (AE). 
Rationale:  This change was made to ensure that major LC- FAOD events are 
captured as AEs. 
11. Subject-reported fatigue, exercise tolerance, muscle pain, and activity l evel efficacy 
recording  was removed from the protocol (e .g., from Section 7.5.2 [Clinical Efficacy 
Measures] and the schedule of events [ Table 2.1] ). 
Rationale:  Continuing to record subject-reported symptoms of muscle weakness and 
fatigue in this open-label, single-arm extension is unlikely to yield informative data. Removal of this assessment will reduce the burden to subjects participating in the study. Note: Ne w or worsened events of fatigue and muscle pain will still be collected 
as adverse events as described under Section 
8.5 (Reporting and Follow-up of 
Adverse Events) . 
12. Section [IP_ADDRESS] (Growth and Weight Evaluations) was updated to state that height, 
weight, and head circumference (if applicable) data will be used to evaluate subject growth using published normative data, when available. 
Rationale:  This change was made to clarify how the growth and weight evaluations 
will be assessed. 
13. Section 8.4.3 (Record Retention) has been updated to state that all study records must 
be retained for at least [ADDRESS_551004] retention. 
 
Rationale:  This administrative change to mandate retention of records for at least 
[ADDRESS_551005] with records retention. 
 
14. Updated language in Section 8.5.4 (Adverse Event Reporting). 
Rationale:  This change was made so the language would be aligned with the most 
current Ultragenyx protocol template.

The Protocol UX007-CL202 (Amendment 4 dated 16 September 2016) has been modified by [CONTACT_11827] [ADDRESS_551006] 
also been made for consistency and clarity but are not included in this summary.  
1. Pharmacokinetic (PK) measurements were added to evaluate UX007 and UX0 [ADDRESS_551007] sites  (minimum of  12 subjects) in 
Section 7.5.4, the Schedule of E vents in Table 2.1, and Section  7.6.4. PK analysis was 
also added as a study objective in Section 6. 
Rationale : A PK sub-study was  added to c haracterize the steady -state PK of UX007 
and UX007 metabolites in subjects with LC -FAOD. 
2. Section 7.1 was modified to include dosing greater than the target range of 25-35% at 
the Investigator’s discretion. 
Rationale: Dosing greater than the upper level of the target range has been included 
to allow subjects who enroll with a baseline UX007/triheptanoin dose greater than 35% to maintain th at dose on UX007-CL202. Investigators may also dose individual 
subjects above target range at their discretion ; it is recomme nded that doses above 
35% are discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to administration. Anecdotal 
evidence from subjects on UX007-CL201 receiving MCT doses above 35% at 
Baseline and from subjects transitioning into UX007-CL202 with UX007/triheptanoin doses above 35% from Investigator-Sponsored Trials or Compassionate Use support that higher oil doses are safe and tolerable. 
3. Section [IP_ADDRESS] was modified to specify that the genitourinary component of the 
physical exam will be performed as age-appropriate at the Investigator’s discretion. 
Rationale : This modification was added to clarify that the genitourinary examination 
scope should be performed at the I nvestigator's discretion based on clinical judgement 
and/or safety need.  
4. Primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints were added within the synopsis and 
Section 7.6.2.  Additional information on endpoint analysis wa s provided within

[CONTACT_11827] [ADDRESS_551008] also been made for consistency and clarity but are not included in this summary.  
1. The study duration ( Section 7.1 and throughout) has been extended from [ADDRESS_551009] . The study duration has been extended to allow subjects to continue to 
receive study drug until UX007 is commercially available.  An End of Study Visit was 
added in the case of commercial availability.   
2. The planned number of subjects ( Section 7.3, Section  7.6.6, and throughout) was 
increased from approximately 100 subjects to approximately 150 subjects as the 
study continues to enroll subjects from investigator sponsored t rials (ISTs) and 
UX007-naive subjects.  
3. Exclusion criterion #3 was modified in the synopsis and in Section  7.3.2 to allow 
exclusion of subjects who may be at increased risk of hypersensitivity adverse effects 
per the judgment of the Investigator.  
4. Inclusion criterion #2 was modified in the synopsis and in Section  7.3.1 from “severe 
unmet need” to “clear unmet need” to more accurately reflect th e clinical presentation 
of LC-FAOD in the study population. 
5. Additional clarifying language was added to Section  [IP_ADDRESS] and the Schedule of 
Events (Table 2.1) to allow for echocardiogram assessments performed as routine 
care within 30 days prior to the scheduled clinic visits.  
6. Additional clarifying language regarding the lymphatic portion of the physical examination was added to Section [IP_ADDRESS] to ensure that the exam scope is 
age-appropriate and at the Investigator’s discretion based on clini cal judgement .

2 SYNOPSIS  
TITLE OF STUDY:  
An Open-label Long -Term Safety and Efficacy Extension Study in Subjects with Long -Chain Fatty 
Acid Oxidation Diso rders (LC -FAOD) Previously Enrolled in UX007 or Triheptanoin Studies  
PROTOCOL NUMBER:  
UX007-CL202 
STUDY SITES:  
Approximately 10 sites globally  
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:  
Phase 2 
RATIONALE:  
Long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LC-FAOD) are caused by [CONTACT_435047], leading to deficiencies in energy metabolism. 
The metabolic deficiency can deplete energy sources, resulting in serious clinical manifestations 
including hypotonia, rhabdomyolysis, liver dysfunction andhypoglycemia, and car diomyopathy. 
These LC -FAOD major events are not sufficiently controlled in many patients by [CONTACT_435048], usually consisting of avoidance of fasting, low -fat/high-carbohydrate diet, dietary medium chain 
triglycerides (MCT oil) , and/or carnitine supplementation.  MCT oil, an even chain fatty acid, can 
provide medium chain fatty acids that by[CONTACT_435049] -FAOD pathway defects but may not 
restore energy metabolism fully. In addition to supplying medium c hain fatty acids, UX007 
(triheptanoin), a specialized medium odd-chain (C7) triglyceride, also replaces deficient mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates via the generation of 3 -carbon intermediates, thereby 
[CONTACT_435050].  
Triheptanoin has been studied in many types of LC-FAOD for approximately 20 years. Published 
reports describe profound clinical responses to triheptanoin, including improved physical capacity and a reduction of frequency and severity of major LC -FAOD event s (rhabdomyolysis, hypoglycemia, 
liver function and hepatomegaly, and cardiomyopathy ). Numerous LC-FAOD patients have 
participated, or are actively participating in multiple clinical studies or treatment programs with UX007/triheptanoin conducted by [CONTACT_435051].   
This open-label long -term safety  and efficacy  study will provide an opportunity for LC -FAOD 
patients to be treated with UX007 for up to [ADDRESS_551010] 
participated in other studies or treatment programs with UX007/trihepta noin or be treatment naïve and 
have clear unmet need  but would be consolidated into one program for long- term triheptanoin 
treatment and consistent safety monitoring. The study is designed to obtain long -term safety 
information and evaluate maintenance of efficacy in a diverse LC -FAOD population

The safety endpoints in this study are:  
• Incidence and severity of treatment emergent AEs  (primary safety endpoint)  
• Vital signs  
• Incidence of laboratory abnormalities  
• Concomitant medications 
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY:  
The study is a n interventional, open -label, long-term safety and efficacy  extension study of UX007 
treatment in approximately  [ADDRESS_551011] participated in prior clinical studies or 
treatment programs with UX007/triheptanoin or are treatment  naïve (i.e., naïve to both UX007 and 
food-grade  triheptanoin) , have failed conventional therapy , and have clear unmet need.  UX007  dosing 
will be targeted at 2 5-35% of total caloric intake. If a subject has been receiving a lower dose of 
UX007/triheptanoin, the individual may continue treatment at the current dose.  If  however, the 
subject has symptomatic disease or clinical signs of exercise limitation while on UX007  doses below 
the target range, the Investigator should consider titrating the dose to 25-35% of total caloric  intake. 
UX007 doses above 35% of total caloric intake may be considered  as needed at the discretion of the 
Investigator  on an individual basis ; it is recommended that doses above 35% are discussed with the 
Medical Monitor prior to administration . If a subject has been off UX007/triheptanoin treatment for 
> [ADDRESS_551012] day that protocol -specified assessments (including telephone 
contact) are conducted for the last subject in the study.  
If UX007 becomes commercially available during the study, each subject will return for an End of  
Study Visit; this will be recorded as study completion rather than early termination. For subjects not 
immediately continuing UX007 through another mechanism (ie, commercial product, IST, or compassionate use), a
 Safety Follow -up Phone Call will be conducted 30-[ADDRESS_551013] dose of 
investigational study drug.  
The continued effects of UX007 treatment on clinical and physiologic disease of the skeletal muscle, 
the liver a nd the heart will be assessed. Creatine kinase (CK) will be measured as a b iomarker of

Protocol Number:  UX007 -CL202 
Amendment 6: [ADDRESS_551015](S), DOSE AND  MODE OF ADMINISTRATION:  
UX007 is colorless to light yellow oil packaged in 1L round, translucent high-densi ty polyethylene 
(HDPE) bottles. UX007 will be administered orally (PO) with food or by [CONTACT_435054]; usually 
four times per day: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed, at the target dose range of 25-35% of total 
calories. The dose may be divided into smaller more frequent doses wi th food as needed. The  dose 
may be mixed with small amounts of food or drink (including formula) as indicated in the  
administration guideline. If a subject has been receiving a lower dose of triheptanoin, the individual may continue treatment at the curren t dose provided there is no evidence of symptomatic disease or 
clinical signs of exercise limitation. UX007 doses above 35% of total caloric intake may be considered 
as needed at the discretion of the Investigator  on an individual basis ; and it is recommended that doses 
above 35% are discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to administration.  If a subject has been off 
UX007/triheptanoin treatment for >  [ADDRESS_551016] to UX007 may 
transition at the same dose and then titrate, as appropriate. 
REFERENCE THERAPY, DOSE AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION:  
The study is designed as an op en-label interventional trial. Therefore, no reference therapy or placebo 
will be administered.  
DURATION OF TREATMENT:  
Subjects may receive UX007 treatment for up to 7 years (84 months) during the study or until 
commercial availability  of UX007 in any region, whichever occurs first. The end of study is  defined as 
the last day that protocol -specified assessments (including telephone contact) are conducted for the 
last subject in the study.  
CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION:  
The concept for evaluation is to study the long-term safety and continued effects of UX007 on energy 
metabolism and clinical events associated with LC-FAOD. Biologic and clinical assessments will be 
conducted throughout the  [ADDRESS_551017] panel of safety assessments.  
Clinical Efficacy Variables:  
 Functional disability and c ognitive development  (instrument selection based on age):  
 Medical Outcomes Study 10 -Item Short Form (SF-10) OR Medical Outcomes Study 
12-Item Short Form (SF-12)  
• Cardiomyopathy  and cardiac function  measured by [CONTACT_18585]; includes ventricle size, ejection 
fraction and shortening f raction 
• LC-FAOD major events inclusive of skeletal myopathy (rhabdomyolysis), hepatic (hypoglycemia) 
and cardiac disease ( cardiomyopathy ) events. Defined as any visit to the ER/acute care, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], emergency intervention (i.e. any unscheduled administration of therapeutics at home or in the clinic), or any similar event whether caused primarily by [CONTACT_29864]-FAOD or by [CONTACT_435055] i llness complicated by [CONTACT_29864] -FAOD. The event type, levels of relevant laboratory

parameters (including CK, glucose, and BNP/tro ponin), the number of days hospi[INVESTIGATOR_435024], and the type and number of days of treatment and intervention will be recorded.  
Biomarkers & LC-FAOD Laboratory Measures:  
• Biomarkers of clinical manifestations:   
 Skeletal myopathy:  CK  
 Hepatic disease:  fasting serum glucose and liver enzymes (ALT, AST, GGT)  
• Laboratory measures of LC-FAOD disease activity , including total and free plasma carnitine , 
plasma acylcarnitines, and urine organic acids  
Pharmacokinetics of UX007 and Metabolites 
• Plasma levels of UX007 
• Plasma levels of UX007 metabolite s, including heptanoate, b eta-hydroxypentanoate (BHP) , and 
beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB ) 
Safety & General Assessments:  
Safety events will be collected as adverse events (AE) or serious adverse events (SAE).  Study 
assessments to evaluate safety include:  
• Clinical laboratory tests  
• Vital signs  
• Physical examination  
• Concomitant medications   
• Growth rate, height and weight :  The amount and rate of growth in pediatric and adolescent 
subjects will be measured using standard methods and compared to baseline height and weight, and head circumference, if applicable ( subjects ≤ 36 months of age ), and to normal growth rates 
and publi shed LC-FAOD growth rates, if available.   
STATISTICAL METHODS:  
A full description of the planned analyses will be provided in a Statistical Analysis Plan.  
The primary efficacy endpoint, ie annualized MCE event rate, will be calculated using all MCE events collected post -UX007 treatment through the end of study. The primary analysis of the annualized 
MCE rate is descriptive statistics using mean, standard deviation (SD), median, quartiles, minimum, and maximum values. Two-sided 95% confidence interval will also be provided when appropriate. Annualized event rates for MCE by [CONTACT_92920] (ie, rhabdomyolysis, cardiomyopathy and hypoglycemic events) will be calculated and summarized in a similar fashion as with the primary efficacy endpoint.  
In addition, for subj ects who have historical event rate data collected, comparisons of pre- and 
post-UX007 treatment annualized event rates for overall MCE events will be conducted. In addition, 
intra-patient comparisons of pre - and post-UX007 treatment for MCE events by [CONTACT_47041] t type might be 
considered if sample size permits.  
Protocol Number:  UX007 -CL202 
Amendment 6: [ADDRESS_551018] deviation (SD), median, 
quartiles, minimum, and maximum values were tabulated by [CONTACT_77433]. For categorical variables, the 
counts and proportions of each value were tabulated. Two-sided 95% confidence interval will also be 
provided when appropriate. Efficacy data collected for age-specific assessments (e.g. SF -10/12) will 
be summarized for subjects in that age group only.  Other age -specific summaries may be provided for 
measures collected across all age groups.  
PK Analyses 
Summary  statistics of plasma concentration will be provided fo r UX007 and metabolites. PK 
parameters such as area under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC), time to maximum plasma 
concentration (Tmax), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), and trough plasma concentration (Ctrough) will be estimated for participating subjects.  
Safety Analyses  
All AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
The incidence and frequency of AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC), Preferred 
Term (PT), severity, and relationship to  UX007 treatment, if possible. A by-subject listing will be 
provided for those subjects who experience a SAE, including death, or experience an AE associated 
with early withdrawal from the study or study drug treatment.  
Clinical laboratory data will be summarized b y the type of laboratory test. The frequency and 
percentage of subjects who experience abnormal clinical laboratory results (i.e. outside reference 
ranges) and/or clinically significant abnormalities will be presented for each measurement.

5 INTRODUCTION  
Long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders ( LC-FAOD) are caused by  [CONTACT_435058], leading to inadequate energy 
metabolism . LC-FAOD can result in serious and potentially life -threatening  clinical 
manifestations, including  rhabdomyolysis, hypotonia/weakness, hypoglycemia, and 
cardiomyopathy.  The  clinical manifestations are usually managed through the avoidance of 
fasting, a low-fat/high-carbohydrate diet, supplementation with  medium chain triglycerides 
(MCT oil) and/or carnitine supplementation. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_2391], many patients still suffer 
significant morbidity and mortality. The mortality rate can be above 50% for subjects 
diagnosed symptomatically and treated with the standard of care (Baruteau et al. 2012).   
Triheptanoin (UX007), a highly purified medium -odd-chain triglyceride consisting of [ADDRESS_551036] that LC -FAOD patients failing current therapy can 
exhibit profound positive clinical responses to triheptanoin ( Roe et al. 2002) ; (Barone 2012) ; 
(Vockley et al. 2015) ; (Vockley et al. 2016) ; (Vockley et al. 2017) ; (Vockley et al. 2018). 
A retrospective medical record review study (UX007-CL001) has been conducted to 
formally assess the clinical outcome of triheptanoin treatment in [ADDRESS_551037] been participating in an ongoing compassionate use program ( IND-106011) for  up 
to [ADDRESS_551038] triheptanoin is effective in reducing serious and potentially life-
threatening  energy crises as indi cated by a 69% decrease in the number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_435025] (Vockley et al. 2015). The results imply the possibility to 
reduce major medical events, and provide the basis for further evaluation of UX007 in 
prospective clinical studies to verify this effect on the clinical manifestations and major 
events of LC- FAOD disease. 
A completed Phase 2 clinical trial (UX007-CL201) evaluated  the safety and effectiveness of 
UX007 in LC -FAOD patients who continued to suffer the effects of LC-FAOD disease 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_391726]. Following completion of a 24- week Treatment Period and 54-week 
Extension Period, subjects from UX007 -CL201 were eligible to continue treatment  in this 
extension study (UX007 -CL202).  Numerous LC- FAOD patients have also participated, or 
are actively participating in multiple clinical studies or compassionate use treatment 
programs with UX007/triheptanoin conducted by [CONTACT_435051].  
This open-label long-term safety extension study will provide an opportunity for these patients and treatment-naïve patients (i.e., naïve to both UX007 and food-grade triheptano in) 
with clear unmet need to be treated with UX007 for up to [ADDRESS_551039], under a single standardized 
protocol. The study is designed to obtain long-term safety information and eval uate 
maintenance of efficacy in a diverse LC -FAOD population.

LC-FAOD frequently overlap and include rhabdomyolysis, hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, 
cardiomyopathy, hypotonia and developmental delay, as well as sudden infant death (reviewed in (Roe et al. 2002). 
Clinical surveys suggest patients with LC-FAOD as a group have an overall premature 
mortality rate from birth of about 50% or higher when diagnosed symptomatically and 
treated (Baruteau et al. 2012).  Mortality may now have been reduced by [CONTACT_435059], including diligent prevention of fasting combined with 
the use of low fat/high carbohydrate diets, carnitine supplementation in some cases, and MCT oil supplementation  (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_435026]. 2009). MCT oil has medium even -chain fatty 
acids that can be metabolized by [CONTACT_435060] -chain fatty acid oxidati on 
enzymes that are distinct from those affected in LC -FAOD and should therefore  by[CONTACT_435061]-FAOD block.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_435027], Spi[INVESTIGATOR_435028], including MCT oil with compliance of ≥ 80%, still had significant problems ( Spi[INVESTIGATOR_435026]. 2009).  
Lindner and colleagues studied the outcome of expanded newborn screening on major decompensation events in different c lasses of disease diagnosed in S outh-West [LOCATION_013] 
(Lindner et al. 2011). The 16 patients (6 very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase  [VLCAD], 
5 L-3-hydroxy- Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase  [LCHAD], 2 carnitine- acylcarnitine translocase 
[CACT] deficiency , 3 multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase [MADD]) in the group had a 25% 
rate of major decompenstion after only 2 years of follow-up. 
5.2 Brief Overview of UX007 (Triheptanoin) Development  
A brief overview of existing information on UX007 (triheptanoin) is provided below; a 
comprehensive review of the data is contained in the Investigator’s Brochure ( IB) provided 
by [CONTACT_435062]. (Ultragenyx ), which should be reviewed prior to initiating 
the study.   
Protocol Number:  UX007 -CL202  
Amendment 6: [ADDRESS_551041]  
UX007 is a liquid, intended for oral (PO) administration. UX007 is highly puri fied 
triheptanoin, a triglyceride of 3 fa tty acids with 7 carbons each. UX007 is manufactured by 
[CONTACT_435063]. The molecular formula and structure 
are as follows:  
Molecular Formula: C 24H44O6  
Structure:  
 
Triheptanoi n is metabolized to heptanoate, which in turn is further metabolized to 4 - and 
5- carbon ketone bodies and the 3-carbon propi[INVESTIGATOR_435029] (derived from the 5-carbon ketones).  Therefore, UX007 is designed as a pro-drug that is metabolized to heptanoate to provide substrate rep lacement as an odd-carbon medium-chain fatty acid for both fatty acid 
metabolism and anaplerosis (replacement of tricarboxylic acid [ TCA] cycle intermediates) 
required for generation of energy. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Mechanism of Action  
The mechanism of acti on of UX007  in restoring energy metabolism is dependent on its 
medium chain length a s well as its odd -carbon properties.  UX007 can be metabolized by 
[CONTACT_29864]-FAOD patients into free heptanoate which can traverse the mitochondrial membrane 
without the carnitine carrier. The free heptanoate from UX007 is then metabolized by a 
different set of medium chain fatty acid oxidation enzymes, by[CONTACT_435064] -FAOD. The heptanoate is converted to  both 
propi[INVESTIGATOR_49376]-CoA and ace tyl-CoA required for energy metabolism ( Figure [IP_ADDRESS].1).  
The restoration of energy metabolism is accomplished by [CONTACT_373595]: 1) the a cetyl-CoA 
is condensed into citrate, the first step of the energy generating TCA cycle, and 2) the 
3-carbon unit in propi[INVESTIGATOR_49376]- CoA resupplies the TCA cycle intermediates that may be 
secondarily deficient in these patients. The production of propi[INVESTIGATOR_49376]- CoA is specific to 
odd-carbon fatty acids and is responsible for the anaplerotic properties of UX007, which are believed to be critical for restoring the energy deficiency state in LC -FAOD.

Figure [IP_ADDRESS].1:  Mechanism of  Action 
 
Propi[INVESTIGATOR_49376]-CoA is a particularly efficient compound for restoring depleted TCA cycle 
intermediates due to the low succinyl-CoA concentration which can differ by 2-3 orders of magnitude compared to other compounds in TCA cycle intermediate pools. Propi[INVESTIGATOR_49376]- CoA is 
an anaplerotic substrate for all tissues, and is also gluconeogenic in the liver , kidney cortex , 
and brain ( Kinman et al. 2006) ; (Gu et al. 2010 ); (Marin-Valencia et al. 2013). Pro duction of 
anaplerotic propi[INVESTIGATOR_49376] -CoA stimulates acetyl -CoA oxidation, NADH production, and ATP 
regeneration, which should result in improved cardiac and skeletal muscle function.  Although it is clear that even -carbon medium -chain triglycerides such as MCT oil can help 
LC-FAOD patients  by [CONTACT_435065], the additional effect of anaplerosis, and subsequent 
gluconeogenesis, is believed  to be responsible for the further benefits observed in 
triheptanoin  clinical programs . 
In addition to restoration of energy metabolism, UX007 reduces the production of toxic fatty acid intermediates by [CONTACT_435066]-chain fatty acids, thus suppressing lipolysis. UX007  provides an 
efficient source of energy f rom fatty acids  for muscles, potentially preserving  glucose and 
glycogen stores during periods of fasting . This leads to a potentially more stable energy state 
whereby [CONTACT_435067][INVESTIGATOR_435030].   

Protocol Number:  UX007 -CL202  
Amendment 6: [ADDRESS_551042] been 
published and furthe r support the safety of UX007. These studies provide data on the 
absorption, and metabolism of triheptanoin when administered intravenously and PO at doses up to 40% the recommended caloric intake.  Triheptanoin is metabolized rapi[INVESTIGATOR_435031] a series o f energy containing metabolites, including heptanoate, C4- and C5-ketone 
bodies (Kinman et al. 2006), ( Deng et al. 2009 ).   
Nonclinical studies in rats have demonstrated that triheptanoin is hydrolyzed to heptanoate and glycerol, which are efficiently absorbed by [CONTACT_4852] ( Kinman et al. 2 006). A study  in 
mice infused with intravenous 
13C-heptanoate at 50% the caloric requirement demonstrated 
increased plasma 13C-enriched glucose levels over baseline plasma glucose levels, 
confirming that heptanoate is a substrate for gluconeogenesis in the liver ( Marin-Valencia et 
al. 2013). Gu et al . also showed that triheptanoin infusion can generate glucose and also 
increase glycogen stores in liver (Gu et al. 2010 ). 
The acute oral toxicity of triheptanoin was performed in rats at four dose levels ranging from 0.5 ml/kg (n= 2) to 5 ml/kg (n=5M/5F). There were no deaths or signs of toxicity at any time throughout the duration of the study and up to [ADDRESS_551043] dose ( IND-[ZIP_CODE]) .   
A 9 month oral toxicity  study in rats was performed with an experimental oil containing 
64% triheptanoin to determine the effects of a diet containing triheptanoin on animal growth, lipid digestibility, clinical chemistry, and toxicity in liver, kidney, and small intestine ( Ataide 
et al. 2009). After [ADDRESS_551044] diet supplemented with soybean oil as the lipid source.  
A Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) 9-month chronic toxicology study in juvenile Yucatan

toxicity in mini-pi[INVESTIGATOR_435032] 50% of their daily caloric intake from UX007. Systemic exposure to UX007 was evident from the dose- related increase in its primary 
metabolites (heptanoic acid and C5 ketone bodies). No accumulation was seen after [ADDRESS_551045] level (NOAEL) for systemic toxicity following oral 
administration of UX007 to juvenile Yucatan minipi[INVESTIGATOR_435033] 50% of daily caloric intake.

Amendment 6: [ADDRESS_551046] been treated with triheptanoin for up to 
approximately 20 years. The clinical experience supports the safety of triheptanoin when 
administered at approximately 35% of daily caloric intake in pediatric patients as young as 
neonates. 
Triheptanoin has been studied for over a decade in a large cohort of LC -FAOD patients   
(Roe et al. 2002), ( Roe et al. 2006 ), (Roe et al. 2008), ( Barone 2012). Patients with other 
disorders have also been treated with triheptanoin, including those with pyruvate carboxylase deficiency (Mochel et al. 2005), Huntington’s disease (Mochel et al. 2010), adult 
polyglucosan body disease (APBD, a form of glycogen storage disorder due to brancher enzyme deficiency; (Roe et al. 2010 ), and Pompe disease (also known as glycogen storage 
disease type II [GSD-II] or acid maltase deficiency; (Roe et al. 2006). Ultragenyx also 
evaluated  UX007 as treatment for Glut1 deficiency syndrome (Glut1 DS). The use of UX007 
in the Glut1 DS indication is no longer under clinical development as the clinical studies did 
not meet their primary efficacy endpoints.  
Roe and colleagues described triheptanoin treatment of 3 subjects with VLCAD  
(Roe et al. 2002). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] [ADDRESS_551047] with cardiomyopathy had a shortening fraction (SF) of 19% prior to treatment which improved to 
30% after 1 month on triheptanoin therapy.  
A cumulative summary of triheptanoin treatment was reported for 48 LC -FAOD patients by 
[CONTACT_435068] ( Roe et al. 2006). Following initiation of triheptanoin, a large decrease in 
hepatomegaly/hypoglycemia in nearly all patients was observed. Substantial decreases in 
rhabdomyolysis even t frequency, and a decrease in cardiac disease were also reported . 
Roe and colleagues described the impact of triheptanoin treatment in 7 patients with carnitine 
palmitoyltransferase  type II (CPT  II) deficiency  (Roe et al. 2008). During the 18 month 
assessment period, there were no rhabdomyolysis events or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and all patients returned to normal physical activity within 2 months following initiation of triheptanoin.  
The treatment was well tolerated when triheptan oin was consu med over a 20-30 minute 
period (Roe et al. 2008 ).  
In total, [ADDRESS_551048]. Charles Roe and 
colleagues in a study sponsored by [CONTACT_435069] ( IND-[ZIP_CODE]). A subset of 
subjects continued triheptanoin treatment for up to [ADDRESS_551049]. Jerry Vockley and their treatment continued ( IND-106011). Some of these patients 
have been reported to exhibit profound clinical responses to triheptanoin including reduction of frequency and severity of rhabdomyolysis events, reduction or elimination of

hypoglycemia events, improved physical capacity, and resolution of cardiomyopathy ( Roe et 
al. 2002);  (Barone 2012). Anecdotal evidence suggests triheptanoin treatment i s well 
tolerated and does not result in excess weight gain with proper management of caloric intake 
(Barone 2012).   
A retrospective medical record review study  (UX007-CL001) was  conducted for LC-FAOD 
subjects who have been treated with triheptanoin for 0.6 – 13 years under the aforementioned 
treatment program  (Vockley et al. 2013). The study evaluated the impact of triheptanoin 
treatment on the rate and extent of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54992] 20 of 24 patients who consented to be part of the study. A total of 120 individual charts were evaluated, which covered 241 years of patient data and included a total of 319 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. The study compared the major medical event rate before and after initiation of triheptanoin treatment including the total number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_435034], muscle rupture, hypoglycemia, or cardiomyopathy. Results demonstrated  significant decreases in the number 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_435035] (6 9%; p < 0.05), and the mean number 
of hypoglycemia events per year (96%; p<0.01) after initiation of triheptanoin treatment (Vockley et al. 2015).  
In the Phase 2 study, UX007-CL201, the frequency and duration of major clinical events including rhabdomyolysis, hypoglycemia, and cardiomyopathy were consistently reduced during 78 weeks of UX007 treatment compared with the 78-week pre-UX007 period (Vockley et al. 2018), supported by [CONTACT_435070]001. In addition to total events, a clinically meaningful reduction in events leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_435036], indicating an effect of UX007 on the most serious manifestations of LC -FAOD. Walking distance improved for the [ADDRESS_551050] 
(12MWT) in UX007-CL201, indicating that subjects maintained pace and exhibited increased stamina throughout the entire distance walked, consistent with an improvement in energy metabolism. In addition, both workload and duration improved during cycle ergometry testing following 24 weeks of UX007  treatment , with an observed 60% mean 
increase in workload over Baseline, suggesting the potential for improved exerc ise capacity 
following treatment with triheptanoin  (Vockley et al. 2017 ). 
5.[ADDRESS_551051] of care for these patients is not sufficient to prevent all LC-FAOD 
manifestations, and is still associated with a high mortality rate (Baruteau et al. 2012 ).   
Over 500patients with various disorders, including LC -FAOD patients ranging from neonates 
to adults, have been treated with triheptanoin for up to approximately  20 years with evidence 
of clinical benefit and no significant safety issues reported. Published reports indicate that 
triheptanoin has imp roved a wide range of LC-FAOD symptoms in the subjects studied and 
some LC-FAOD patients failing current therapy can exhibit profound positive clinical

Data from pharmacokinetic and toxicity studies indicates that trihepta noin is well absorbed 
after oral dosing and is well-tolerated without overt toxicities at doses as hig h as 1.14 g/kg 
for [ADDRESS_551053] common treatment- related treatment- emergent 
adverse events ( TEAEs) were gastrointestinal (GI) in nature. Of these most frequently 
reported TEAEs were diarrhea and abdominal pain, which were mild or moderate in severity, 
and mostly occurred during up-titration of the initial dose of triheptanoin, and lasted a median duration of 3 days. Where it was deemed clinically necessary in the judgment of the Investigator, treatment- related GI events may be managed with UX007 dose reductions. 
The adverse drug reactions  for triheptanoin in subjects with LC -FAOD are diarrhea , 
abdominal pain (including preferred term s of abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, 
abdominal discomfort, abdominal distention, and gastrointestinal pain), vomiting and nausea. 
Overall the risk -benefit ratio of triheptanoin /UX007 appears to be favorable based on the 
safety record to date and the benefit observed in published observational studies, 
compassionate use programs, and Ultragenyx clinical trials.

At the time of protocol development, triheptanoin had been studied in many types of 
LC-FAOD for more than 13 years. Published reports describe profound clinical responses to 
triheptanoin, including improved physical capacity and a reduction of frequency and severity of major LC-FAOD events (rhabdomyolysis, hypoglycemia, liver function and hepatomegaly, and cardiomyopathy).  Numer ous LC-FAOD patients have participated, or are 
actively participating in multiple clinical studies or treatment programs with UX007/triheptanoin conducted by [CONTACT_435051].

6 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective of the study is to: 
• Evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of UX007 in LC- FAOD subjects  
The secondary objectives of the study are to:  
• Evaluate the effect of UX007 on energy metabolism in LC- FAOD 
• Evaluate impact of UX007 on clinical events associated with  LC-FAOD  
The objective of the pharmacokinetic sub- study is to:  
• Characterize the steady -state pharmacokinetics ( PK) of UX007 and UX007 metabolites 
in subjects with LC -FAOD.

participated in prior clinical studies or treatment programs with UX007/triheptanoin , or 
who have failed conventional therapy and have documented clear  unmet need (in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_435037]). UX007 dosing will be targeted at 25 -35% of total caloric 
intake. If a subject has been receiving a lower dose of UX007/triheptanoin, the individual 
may continue treatment at the current dose. If however, the subject has symptomatic disease or clinical signs of exercise limitation while on UX007 doses below the target range, the Investigator should consider titrating the dose to 25-35% of total caloric intake. UX007 doses above 35% of total caloric intake may be considered as needed at the discretion of the Investigator on an individual basis; it is recommended that doses above 35% are discussed 
with the Medical Monitor prior to administration.  If a subject has been off 
UX007/triheptanoin treatment for > [ADDRESS_551057] day that protocol- specified assessments 
(including telephone contact) are conducted for the last subject in the study. If UX007 becomes commercially available during the study, each subject will return for an 
End of Study Clinic Visit ; this will be recorded as study completion rather than an early 
termination. For subjects not immediately continuing UX007 through another mechanism 
(ie, commercial product, IST, or compassionate use), a Safety Follow -up Phone Call will be 
conducted 30-[ADDRESS_551058] dose of investigational study drug.  
The continued effects of UX007 treatment on clinical and physiologic disease of the skeletal 
muscle, the liver and the heart will be assessed.  Creatine kinase (CK) will be measured as a 
biomarker of skeletal myopathy. The metabolic effects on the liver and  energy homeostasis 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_435071].  Cardiac 
disease will be assessed by [CONTACT_435072] (ECHO).   
The impact of UX007 treatment on major clinical events will also be assessed throughout the 
study. Major events are defined as musculoskeletal, hepatic, and cardiac events caused by [CONTACT_29864]-FAOD, or intercurrent illness complicated by [CONTACT_29864] -FAOD, resulting in any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
ER visit, or emergency intervention (any unscheduled administration of t herapeutics at home 
or in the clinic).  In subjects for which prior medical events data have already been collected 
during a prior UX007 protocol the effect of UX007 treatment on major clinical events 
during this study will be compared with the subject’s available historical information for the

Proprietary and Confidential  Page 32 
Given the acute -on-chronic nature of LC -FAOD, subjects will be eligible to continue 
maintenance UX007 treatment for up to 7 years ( 84 months) or until commercial availability 
of UX007 in any region, whichever occurs first . The treatment duration is intended to 
provide additional long-term safety information and provide sufficient insight on sustained 
clinical effects in LC-FAOD patients  under a single study protocol. 
7.[ADDRESS_551059] participated in clinical 
studies or compassionate use programs with UX007/triheptanoin, or who have failed conventional therapy and have documented clear  unmet need (in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_16205]). Most subjects in this study will have prior treatment exposure to 
UX007/triheptanoin, although it is possible to enroll treatment -naïve individuals if prior 
study participation involved assignment to a control treatment arm. 
The inclusion criteria are structured to enroll subjects with various types of LC- FAOD 
(CPT-I, CPT-II, VLCAD, LCHAD, TFP, or CACT deficiencies).   
Many LC- FAOD patients are seriously impacted  by [CONTACT_435073]. 
Triheptanoin has been administered previously to LC -FAOD patients, including newborns, 
infants, children, and adults. The experience reported in clinical studies and compassionate 
use programs suggests a favorable risk/benefit profile fo r the target study population. 
The Sponsor has taken all reasonable measures to ensure the protection and safety of this 
population. Appropriate pediatric expertise will be available at all trial sites, and efforts will 
be focused on minimizing risk, fear, pain and distress for this population during conduct of 
the study. 
7.3.[ADDRESS_551060] meet all of the following criteria: 
1. Male or female, 6 months of age or older 
2. Prior participation in a clinical study assessing UX007/triheptanoin treatment for 
LC-FAOD.  Study Sponsors/Collaborators include: Oregon Health & Science University, 
University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], and Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Patients who received UX007/triheptanoin treatment as part of other clinical studies; investigator sponsored trials (IST) ; expanded access/compassionate use treatment programs; or patients who are 
treatment naïve (i.e., naïve to both UX007 and food- grade triheptanoin), have failed 
conventional therapy and, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2511] I nvestigator and Sponsor, have 
documented clear  unmet need, may also be eligible at the discretion of the Sponsor. 
3. Confirmed diagnosis of LC- FAOD including:  carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT I or 
CPT II) deficiency, very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency, long chain 3-hydroxy- acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) deficiency, trifunctional protein 
(TFP) deficiency, or carnitine -acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) deficiency. Information

on diagnosis will be obtained from medical records and should include confirmed 
diagnosis by [CONTACT_435052], fatty acid oxidation probe studies in cultured fibroblasts, and/or mutation analysis. 
4. Willing and able to complete all aspects of the study through the end of the study, including visits and tests, documentation of symptoms and diet, and adminis tration of 
study medications. If a minor, have a caregiver(s) willing and able to assist in all 
applicable study requirements. 
5. Provide written informed consent (subjects aged ≥ 18 years), or provide written assent (where appropriate) and have a legally authorized representative willing and able to provide written informed consent, after the nature of the study has been explained and prior to any research -related procedures.  
6. Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine  pregnancy test at Baseline 
and be willing to have additional pregnancy tests during the study. Females considered not of child-bearing potential include those who have not experienced menarche, are post-menopausal (defined as having no menses for at least  12 months without an 
alternative medical cause), or are permanently sterile due to total hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], or bilateral oophorectomy.  
7. Participants of child ‐bearing potential or fertile males with partners of child -bearing 
potential w ho are sexually active must consent to use a highly effective method of 
contraception as determined by [CONTACT_435053] [ADDRESS_551061] dose of study  drug. 
7.3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
Individuals who meet any of the following exclusion criteria will not be eligible to participate 
in the study: 
1. Diagnosis of MCAD deficiency, short- or medium-chain FAOD, ketone body metabolism 
defect, propi[INVESTIGATOR_435023] 
2. Patient qualifies for any other clinical trial designed to progressively evaluate the safety 
and efficacy of triheptanoin in LC- FAOD 
3. Any known hypersensitivity to triheptanoin that, in the judgment of the Investigator, places the subject at increased risk for adverse effect s 
4. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding an infant at Baseline or planning to become pregnant 
(self or partner) at any time during the study   
5. Have any co -morbid conditions, including unstable major organ- system disease(s) that in

Protocol Number:  UX007 -CL202  
Amendment 6: [ADDRESS_551062] or Investigator due to poor enrollment or noncompliance, as applicable.  
Subjects may be removed from the study for the following reasons: 
• Occurrence of an unacceptable adverse event ( AE) 
• An illness that, in the judgment of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_435038], might place 
the subject at risk or invalidate th e study  
• At the request of the subject, Investigator, or Ultragenyx, for administrative or other 
reasons 
• Protocol deviation or unreliable behavior 
If the reason for removal of a subject from the study is an AE, the AE and any related test or procedure results will be recorded in the source documents and transcribed onto the Case Report Form (CRF). Each clinically significant abnormal laboratory value or other clinically meaningful abnormality should be followed until the abnormality resolves or until a decision is made that it is not likely to resolve. If such abnormalities do not return to normal within [ADDRESS_551063] dose of 
investigational study drug, even if the Early Termination Visit does not occur. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35640] a Grade 3 or higher SAE that is unexpected and possibly, 
probably, or definitely related to UX007 (Section 8.5.3) that represent s a change in the nature 
or an increase in frequency of the serious event from their prior medical history will be assessed, by [CONTACT_737],  as to whether the subject will  continue on the study.   
Commonly occurring LC -FAOD medical events include rhabdomyolysis, cardiomyopathy, 
hypoglycemia, and other events as described in the IB. If a subject experiences a major LC-FAOD medical event, which represent s a change in the nature or an increase in 
frequency of the serious event from their prior medical history, the Investigator should determine whether the subject should be discontinued from the study. In these cases, the

Regulatory Authorities, as w ell as the IRBs/ECs, will be informed s hould unexpected and 
possibly, probably, or definitely drug-related SAEs occur, a full evaluation of the event will 
be performed in order to make a decision regarding what actions to take, including whether to recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098]. Regulatory Authorities, as well as IRBs/ECs, will be 
informed if the study is paused or stopped. If the Sponsor deems it appropriate to restart the 
trial following an internal safety review, this will be done only following approval by [CONTACT_18332].  
7.4 Treatments  
7.4.1 Reference Therapy  
The study design is open- label; all subjec ts will receiv e investigational product. No placebo 
or reference therapy wil l be administered in this study.   
7.4.[ADDRESS_551065] , triheptanoin, will be administered orally (PO) with food  
or by [CONTACT_435054] (usually four times per day: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed), 
at the target dose rang e of 25-35% of total calories. The dose may be divided into smaller 
more frequ ent doses with food as needed. The dose may be mixed with small amounts of 
food or drink (including formula) as indicated in the Study Drug A dministration Guidelines. 
If a subject has been receivi ng a lower dose of triheptanoin, the individual may continue 
treatment at the current dose provided there is no evidence of symptomatic disease or clinical signs of exercise limitation.  If a subject has been off UX007/triheptanoin treatment 
for > 1 month or is treatment naïve, the dose will be titrated following the Study Drug 
Administrati on Guidelines. UX007 doses above 35% of total caloric intake may be 
considered as needed at the discretion of the Investigator on an individual basis; it is recommended that doses above 35% are discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to administration. 
7.4.[ADDRESS_551066]  
UX007 is a colorless to light yellow oil packaged in 1L round, translucent high-density 
polyethylene (HDPE) bottles . UX007 should be stored at room temperature. The study drug 
was manufactured, packaged, and labeled according to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) 
regulations. 
Protocol Number:  UX007 -CL202  
Amendment 6: 01 October 2019  
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 36 
7.4.4 Selection of Doses and Study  Duration  
The UX007 dose and regimen is selected based on the extensive information derived from 
over 13 years of clinica l experience in LC-FAOD at the time of protocol development. 
These data show an age- dependent dose related to the relatively higher energy requirements 
for young children versus older children versus adults. The target dose is 25-35% of to tal 
calories by [CONTACT_435074]007, as tolerated, which is equivalent to approximately 2-4 g/kg in young 
children, decreasing to 1-2 g/kg for older children and adolescents, and 1 g/kg for adults. 
Since this treatment is a substrate replacement therapy and not an enzym e inhibitor or other 
type of drug class, dosing is individualiz ed based on  tolerability, metabolism , and energy 
needs. The following information provides support for the UX007 dose and regimen: 
• Clinical doses used in the compassionate use program and previous clinical studies   
(IND-[ZIP_CODE]) ; (Roe et al. 2006) 
• Barone and colle agues reported safety and efficacy of triheptanoin administered at 
1-2 g/kg/day to 22 LC -FAOD patients (aged 1.5 – 58 years) ( Barone 2012). 
• Roe and colleagues reported safety and efficacy of triheptanoin administered at a dose 
level between 2 .6 - 4.0 g/kg/day to 3 VLCAD patients (aged 2-8 years)  (Roe et al. 2002) 
• Consultations with physicians and dietitians experienced in the administration of triheptanoin to LC-FAOD patients  in clinical practice resulted  in consensus on a dose of 
triheptanoin titrated to comprise 25 – 35% of daily caloric intake  
: personal communication). 
Based on these data, the target dose range for UX007  will be an estimated 25 -35% of daily 
caloric intake.   
• If a subject has been receiving a lower dose of UX007/triheptanoin, the individual 
may continue treatment at the current dose.  If however, the subject has symptomatic 
disease or clinical signs of exercise limitation while on UX007 doses below the target 
range, the I nvestigator should consider titrating the dose to 25 -35% of total caloric 
intake.   
• If a subject has been receiving a dose of UX007/triheptanoin greater than 35% total 
caloric intake, the individual may continue treatment at the current dose at the 
Investigator’s discretion. Investigators may also dose individual subjects above target 
range as needed at their discretion ; it is recommended that doses above 35% are 
discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to administration. 
• If a subject has been off UX007/triheptanoin treatment for > [ADDRESS_551067] to UX007 may transition at the same 
dose and then titrate as appropriate.  

Protocol Number:  UX007 -CL202

• Daily caloric intake will be established based on the most recent diet ary analysis  in 
the medical record , and collected periodically duri ng the study.  
o For patients over [ADDRESS_551068] as necessary for normal weight gain/growth  based on the study diet diary analysis.  
Subject participation duration in this extension study will be up to 7 years ( 84 months) or 
until commercial availability  of UX007 in any region, whichever occurs first . The total 
UX007 treatment duration per subject will vary depending on prior exposure from participation in clinical studies a nd compassionate use programs. The 7-year study duration 
will provide a continued treatment option and enabl e a long-term assessment of the safety 
and efficacy of UX007 in subjects with LC -FAOD under a single study protocol.
 The end of 
study is defined as the last day that protocol- specified assessments (including telephone 
contact) are  conducted for the last subject in the study. 
7.4.5 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
[IP_ADDRESS] Prohibited Medications  
Subjects may not be enrolled if they are unwilling to discontinue use of a substance that may 
confound study objectives. The following medications are prohibited during the study  and 
must be discontinued at minimum [ADDRESS_551069] dose : 
• Valproate products (e.g. Depacon, Depakote, Depakene, Stavzor, and their generics) 
• Pancreatic lipase inhibitors (e.g., Orlistat) d ue to possible inhibition of metabolism of 
triheptanoin   
The following medications are prohibited during the study and must be discontinued prior to the first dose:  
• MCT oil and metabolic formulas containing significa nt contributions from MCT oil, 
including coconut oil, must not be used after the first dose of study medication

[IP_ADDRESS] Permitted Medications 
Other than the medications specificall y prohibited in this protocol, s ubjects may receive 
concomitant medications as required.  Medications (investigational, prescription, over-the-
counter, and herbal) and nutritional supplements taken during the [ADDRESS_551070] will be 
dispensed an adequate supply of study drug to comprise 25- 35% total daily caloric intake  
(or prescribed dose). Additional study drug will be shipped to the subject between clinic visits.  UX007 will not be dispensed at the Month 84 (end-of- treatment visit), End  of Study, 
or Early Termination visits  (as applicable) . The subject will maintain a weekly diary to 
record adherence to prescribed treatment. The diary will be reviewed upon each indicated 
visit and an estimate of overall treatment compliance will be made by [CONTACT_7893] . Subjects 
will be instructed to return all used (empty study drug containers) study drug to the site at the 
next visit.  Site personnel will maintain a record of all medication dispensed to each subject  
and returned to the site. 
7.[ADDRESS_551071] UX007 -CL201 visit will be used for 
Baseline data to avoid duplication. Follo wing the signing of informed consent at the Baseline 
visit, subjects will complete required assessments and return for clinic  visits at 6 month 
intervals (± 2 weeks) to assess long -term safety and efficacy . The study coordinator will 
telephone the subject/ caregiver at specified int ervals (± 1 week) for additional safety 
monitoring.  
A Safety Follow-up Phone Call will be conducted 30-[ADDRESS_551072] information on 
any ongoing or new AEs, SAEs, and concomitant medications. Appropriate follow-up should continue until all safety concerns, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], are resolved. The end of study is defined as the last day that protocol- specified assessmen ts (including telephone 
contact) are conducted for the last subject in the study. 
Protocol Number:  UX007 -CL202  
Amendment 6: [ADDRESS_551073] will retur n for an 
End of Study Clinic Visit ; this will be recorded as study completion rather than an early 
termination . For subjects not immediately continuing UX007 through another mechanism 
(ie, commercial product, IST, or compassionate use), a Safety Follow -up Phone Call will be 
conducted 30-[ADDRESS_551074] dose of investigational study drug.  
The parameters to be assessed  in Study UX007- CL202, along with timing of assessments, are 
provided in the Schedule of Events  (Table 2.1). Where  caregiver assessments are required, 
the same individual should complete the assessment for consistency or reporting when 
possible. Refer to the Study Reference Manual for additional details on specific assessments.   
7.5.2 Clinical Efficacy Measures 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Functional Disability and Cognitive Development 
Functional disability often limits daily activities of living and health -related quality of life in 
patients with LC -FAOD. Individuals with LC -FAOD may also have delayed cognitive 
development. Functional disability and cognitive development will be asses sed at clinic visits 
as specified in Table 2.1. Parameters will be evaluated using the following age appropriate 
validated health assessment questionnaires:  
• The Medical Outcomes Study 10- Item Short Form (SF -10) is a 10 -item caregiver 
completed questionnaire designed to assess generic health -related quality of life in 
healthy and ill pediatric populations ( Saris-Baglama et al. 2006) . The 10 items were 
adapted from the Child Health Questionnaire and utilize a 4 -week recall period. 
Responses are used to generate 2 component su mmary scores: physical component 
summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS). Higher global scores are associated with better quality of life. The SF-10 will be administered to caregivers of 
subjects aged 6 through 17 years. The SF-10 will be administered -at the Baseline visit 
and at 6 month intervals thereafter (or Early Termination).  
Protocol Number:  UX007 -CL202  
Amendment 6: 01 October 2019  
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 40 
• The Medical Outcomes Study 12- Item Short Form (SF -12) is a 12 -item interview and 
self-administered questionnaire designed to assess generic health -related quality of life in 
healthy and ill adult populations ( Ware et al. 1996). The 12 items in the SF- 12 are a 
subset of the items in the SF-36 and measure physical functioning, role limitations due to 
physical health problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality (energy/fatigue), social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. Responses are used to generate 2 component summary scores: physical health (PCS) and mental health (MCS). Higher global scores are associated with better quality of life. The standard 
version of the instrument with a 4- week recall peri od will be used in this study. 
The SF-12 will be administered to subjects 18 years of age and older. The SF-12 will be 
administered at the Baseline visit and at 6 -month intervals thereafter (or Early 
Termination).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Cardiomyopathy and Cardiac F unction 
ECHO will be performed at the Baseline Visit and annually thereafter  at clinic visits 
indicated in Table 2.1 (or if performed as routine care within 30 days prior to the Baseline or 
indicated clinic visits) or Early Termination  if not performed within 6 months prior to 
termination . Additional tests may be performed if any abnormalities are detected or if 
medically indicated.  
ECHO efficacy variables include ventricle size, ejection fraction (EF) , and shortening 
fraction (SF), as described within the Study Reference Manual .  
[IP_ADDRESS] LC-FAOD Major Events  
Major LC -FAOD events include skeletal myopathy (rhabdomyolysis), hepatic 
(hypoglycemia) and cardiac disease ( cardiomyopathy) events, and are defined as any visit to 
the ER/acute care, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], emergency intervention (i.e. any unscheduled 
administration of therapeutics at home or in the clinic), or any similar event whether caused primarily by [CONTACT_29864] -FAOD or by [CONTACT_435056]- FAOD. The event 
type, levels of relevant laboratory parameters (including CK, glucose, and BNP/troponin), the number of days hospi[INVESTIGATOR_435039], and the type and number of days of treatment and intervention will be recorded.  
By [CONTACT_108] , events requiring inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_435040], are classified as a serious adverse event ( SAE) or serious suspected adverse reaction , and will be 
reported as described in Section  8.5. If the event represents a substantive change in the nature 
or an increase in frequency from a subject’s prior medical history , the event should be 
reported as an adverse event (AE) and  the Investigator should evaluate whether the subject 
should be discontinued from the study.   
Protocol Number:  UX007 -CL202  
Amendment 6: [ADDRESS_551075] to continue as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_737]. Information on 
the incidence of major rhabdomyolysis events will be collected at each visit.  
7.5.3 Biomarkers & LC -FAOD Laboratory Measures  
A panel of biomarkers will be assessed as clinical indicators of skeletal myopathy and 
hepatic disease. CK is a useful marker in the investigation of skeletal muscle disease.  The presence of CK suggests that muscle cells somewhere in the patient are sufficiently 
energy deficient to over- contract and rupture, providing an ongoing chronic or non- acute 
total CK release. Chronic elevations of CK have been reported to indicate patients at risk for 
major rhabdomyolysis events, although no quantitative relationship has been established yet.   
Assessing glucose levels is central to the management of hypoglycemia associated with 
LC-FAOD. Samples for fasting serum glucose (as tolerated) will be collected on arrival to 
the clinic; the length of fast, the date and time of the last dose of study medication, and  time 
of collection will be recorded on the CRF. Relevant liver enzymes, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) will be evaluated as indicators of liver injury related to LC-FAOD.   
Biomarkers and r elevant indicators of LC- FAOD are summarized in  Table [IP_ADDRESS].  
Blood samples will be collected at each clinic  visit to assess relevant biomarkers and 
laboratory measures  of LC-FAOD. For each sample collection, the duration of fasting and 
time elapsed since last study drug administration will be recorded on the CRF.  Where possible, assessment of certain parameters (i.e. glucose, ALT, AST, GGT) will be 
performed as part of the routine clinical laboratory test panel to avoid unnecessary duplication of testing ( see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). Refer to the Study Reference Manual for 
additional details.

Plasma UX007 and t he following UX007 metabolites will be assessed:  
• Beta-hydroxypentanoate (BHP ) 
• Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) 
• Heptanoate 
7.5.5 Safety Measures & General Assessments  
General assessments include medical history, concomitant medications, demographics, and growth. Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_5205], frequency, severity and relatedness of AEs and SAEs, including clinically significant changes from baseline to scheduled 
timepoints in vital signs, weight, physical examination, and clinical laboratory evaluations.  Pregnancy testing (or pregnancy of partner, if needed) will also be conducted  as appropriate .  
Refer to the Study Reference Manual for addi tional details.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Medical History  and Triheptanoin Treatment History  
Medical history  will be obtained for all subjects not previously enrolled in UX007-CL201. 
General medical information includes subject demographics (date of birth, ethnicity, and sex) and a history of major medical illnes ses, diagnoses, and surgeries. The review will also 
include an assessment of major medical conditions associated with LC-FAOD, including 
clinical or subclinical rhabdomyolysis, cardiomyopathy, hypoglycemia, and 
hypotonia/exe rcise intolerance.  Any available sibling history of LC- FAOD will be noted 
including relationship  and outcome.

LC-FAOD maintenance treatment history, including triheptanoin treatment history,  and 
relevant concomitant medications will be recorded (start date, stop date, dose, dose regimen).  
Other LC-FAOD treatments  include MCT oil (including coconut oil), carnitine supplements, 
other standard of care treatments, and all other relevant concomitant medications (e.g. diuretics, inotropes, seizure medications, supplements, etc.). Medications include 
prescription, over- the-counter, herbal and nutritional supplements . Any relevant concomitant 
therapy, including physical/occupational therapy will be recorded.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Growth and Weight Evaluations 
At each clinic visit , measurements of height and weight will be collected for each 
subject us ing a stadiometer and a scale. Head circumference will be obtained for subjects 
≤ 36 months of age. Height, weight, and head circumference (if applicable) data will be used 
to evaluate each subject’s growth using published normative data, whe n available . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include seated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) measured in 
millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), heart rate (HR) in beats per minute, respi[INVESTIGATOR_189325], and temperature in degrees Celsius (°C).  Vital sign measurements will be 
performed at every clinic visit before any additional assessments are completed .   
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examination  
Complete physical examinations will be performed at the Baseline visit and at 6 -month 
intervals (or Early Termination). Physical examinations will include assessments of general appearance; head, eyes, ears, nose, and  throat; the  cardiovascular, dermatologic, lymphatic, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, genitourinary , musculoskeletal, and neurologic systems.  
The lymphatic exam scope should be as per age-appropriate standard of care, at the 
Investigator’s discretion based on the clinical judgement and/or safety need. If a PI [INVESTIGATOR_435041] f or a lymphatic exam, it is not necessary to perform. 
The genitourinary exam scope should be non- invasive and as per age -appropriate standard of

concern may, at the discretion of the Investigator (an d/or Medical Monitor), have additional 
blood samples taken for  safety laboratory tests. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy Testing  
Female subjects of childbearing potential will have urine pregnancy tests as described in the 
Schedule of Events ( Table 2.1). Females considered not of childbearing potential include 
those who have not experienced menarche, are post-menopausal (defined as having no 
menses for at least 12 months without an alternat ive medical cause); or are permanently 
sterile due to total hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], or bilateral oophorectomy.  
Protocol Number:  UX007 -CL202  
Amendment 6: [ADDRESS_551077] be reported (Section [IP_ADDRESS]); pregnant subjects will b e 
discontinued from the study. Additional pregnancy tests may be performed at any time in 
which pregnancy status is in question. A serum pregnancy test will be performed in the event of a positive or equivocal urine pregnancy test result, or can be performed if pregnancy test by [CONTACT_11864].   
Experience with UX007 (triheptanoin) in pregnant women is limited. The study drug may 
involve risks to a pregnant female or unborn baby [CONTACT_435075]. 
Sexually active fertile males or females of child‐bearing potential must use highly effective 
contraception during heterosexual intercourse throughout the study period and for 30 days 
after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35648]. Examples of highly effective methods (CTFG 2014) include: 
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 
• Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 
• Intrauterine device (IUD) 
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomized partner  
• Sexual abstinence (i.e., refraining from heterosexual inter course during the entire period 
of risk associated with the study treatments, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject)  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events  
All AEs will be recorded from the time the subject signs the informed consent  through 
[ADDRESS_551078] administration of study drug. Assessments of AEs will occur at each study visit  (phone and clinic). At each visit subjects will be asked about any new or 
ongoing AEs since the previous visit. The determination, evaluation, reporting, and 
follow-up of AEs will be performed as outlined in Section  8.5.   
Clinically significant changes from Baseline in physical examination findings, vital signs, weight, and clinical laboratory param eters will be recorded as AEs or SAEs, if appropriate.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications will be reviewed and recorded in the subject’s CRF at each study 
visit (phone and clinic) . Medications (investigational, prescription, over- the-counter, and 
herbal) and nutritional supplements taken during the 30 days prior to Baseline will be 
reviewed and recorded. At each subsequent visit, change in medications since the previous visit will be recorded.  A discussion of concomitant medications is provided in Section  7.4.5. 
Protocol Number:  UX007 -CL202

[IP_ADDRESS] Dietary Assessment  
The initial 3 -day diet history recorded will be reviewed by [CONTACT_435076]. Subjects and/or caregivers will maintain a record of the subject’s daily diet 
using a diary for [ADDRESS_551079] measures used in other diseases and 
conditions that imp air muscle, liver, and heart function.   
Where possible, additional validated, age-appropriate, patient-reported outcomes were 
included to assess functional disability, cognitive development and health- related quality  of 
life (i.e. SF-10/12). ECHO is a routine, non-invasive procedure inflicting minimal 
pain/distress for the subject, while providing relevant indicators of cardiac disease.  
Additional relevant biomarkers of LC-FAOD disease status will be assessed using blood 
samples. Where possible, timing of assessments has been coordinated with standard safety 
laboratory tests to minimize risk and discomfort and avoid unnecessary duplication of 
testing. 
The safety parameters to be evaluated in this study  include standard assessments such as 
recording of medical history, AEs and SAEs, physical examination, vital signs, serum 
chemistry, concomitant medications, and other routine clinical and laboratory procedures.  
7.6 Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample Size  
Because the completeness of the data affects the integrity and accuracy of the final study 
analysis, every effort will be made to ensure complete, a ccurate and timely data collection, 
and to avoid missing data. The detailed method for analyse s along with procedures for 
accounting for missing, unused, and spurious data will be presented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP); the information below is intended as a guide to planned analyse s.  
7.6.[ADDRESS_551080]-dose efficacy assessment  will be included in the efficacy analysis; 
the evaluable set  only includes subjects who com plete at least 80% of treatment doses and 
assessments. A complete treatment dose is defined as at least 25% of caloric intake from 
UX007.

Subjects with historical medical events collected will be analyzed separately for changes in 
the rates of medical event s and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_435043].  Individual genetic disease types will be 
analyzed together in separate subset populations.  Subsets based on dominant clinical 
phenotype may also be analyzed. Subsets may also be defined based on prior study 
participation  assessing UX007 treatment . Other analysis subset populations wil l be defined in 
the SAP.

median, quartiles, minimum, and maximum values. Two -sided 95% confidence interval will 
also be provided when appropriate. Annualized event rates for MCE by [CONTACT_92920] (ie, 
rhabdomyolysis, cardiomyopathy and hypoglycemic events) will be calculated and summarized  in a similar fashion as with the primary efficacy endpoint.  
In addition, for subjects who have historical event rate data collected, comparisons of pre- and post-UX007 treatment annualized event rates for overall MCE events will be 
conducted. In addition, intra-patient comparisons of pre- and post -UX007 treatment for MCE 
events by [CONTACT_435077].  
Summary  statistics will be produced  for all exploratory  endpoints using all available 
assessments. For continuous variables, the number of observations and the mean, standard deviation (SD), median, quartiles, minimum, and maximum values were tabulated by [CONTACT_77433]. For categorical variables, the counts and proportions of each value were tabulated. Two-sided 95% confidence interval will also be provided when appropriate. Efficacy data 
collected for age- specific assessments (e.g. SF -10/12) will be summarized for subjects in that 
age group only. Other age- specific summaries may be provided for measures collected across 
all age groups.

8.5 Reporting and Follow -up of Adverse Events  
8.5.1 Definition of Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the 
use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE  can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) products. 
A suspected adverse reaction  is any adverse event  for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event . For the purposes of expedited safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
drug and the adverse event . Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty 
about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event  caused by a drug. 
Life-threatening adverse event or lif e-threatening suspected adverse reaction is an adverse 
event or suspected adverse reaction that, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, 
places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event  
or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death. 
A serious adverse event ( SAE) or serious suspected adverse reaction is an adverse event  or 
suspected adverse reaction that at any dose, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, 
results in any of the following outcomes:  
Protocol Number:  UX007 -CL202  
Amendment 6: 01 October 2019  
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 55 
• Death 
• A life-threatening adverse event 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• Persistent or significant incapacity or disability (substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions) 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Note that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11818] (e.g. for elective surgeries) are 
not considered SAEs. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11819]- existing conditions that are  
scheduled after study enrollment are considered SAEs.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition. 
8.5.2 Severity of Adverse Events  
Wherever possible, t he severity of all AE s will be graded using the NCI  CTCAE Version 4.0.  
The majority of AEs can be graded using this system. 
If an AE cannot be graded using the CTCAE criteria, it should be graded as mild, moderate, 
severe, life-threatening, or death using the following definitions.  
• Mild (Grade 1) : Awareness of signs or sy mptoms, but easily tolerated and  are of a minor 
irritant type, causing no loss of time from normal activities. Symptoms do not require 
therapy or a medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient.  
• Moderate (Grade 2) : Events introduce a low level of in convenience or concern to the 
participant and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by [CONTACT_11884]; moderate experiences may cause some interference with functioning. 
• Severe (Grade 3) : Events interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and generally 
require systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually incapacitating. 
• Life-threatening (Grade 4) : Events that place the participant at  immediate risk of death 
or are disabling.  
• Death (Grade 5) : Events that result in death.  
Protocol Number:  UX007 -CL202  
Amendment 6: 01 October 2019  
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 56 
To make sure there is no confusion or misunderstanding of the difference between the terms 
"serious" and "severe," which are not synonymous, the following note of clarification is 
provided. The term "severe" is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical signific ance (such as severe headache).  This is not the same as 
"serious" which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject's life or fun ctioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as 
a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
8.5.3 Relationship of Adverse Events to Stu dy Drug 
The Investigator will assess the potential relationship of the AE to study drug using the 
following descriptions. 
Categories of attributions for “Unrelated” events:  
• Unrelated:  This category applies to an AE that is clearly not related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure. 
• Unlikely Related:  This category applies to an AE that is doubtfully related to the 
investigational agent/procedure.  
Categories of attributions for “Related” events: 
• Possibly Related:  This category applies to an AE that may be related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure. 
• Probably Related:  This category applies to an AE that is likely related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure.  
• Definitely Related: This category applies to an AE that is clearly related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure. 
For the purposes of reporting to regulatory agencies, AEs deemed as Definitely, Probably or 
Possibly Related will be considered Related and those deemed Unrelated  or Unlikely  Related 
will be considered Unrelated . 
8.5.4 Adverse Event Reporting  
[IP_ADDRESS] General 
All AEs (i.e. any new or worsening in severity or frequency of a preexisting condition) with 
onset after the subject signs consent for study participation must be promptly documented on 
the CRF. The Investigator is responsible for evaluating all AEs, obtaining supporting documents, and ensuring documentation of the event is adequate. Details of the AE must include severity, relationship to study drug, duration, and outcome.  
Protocol Number:  UX007 -CL202  
Amendment 6: [ADDRESS_551093] a comment in the source document by [CONTACT_35718], recovered with sequelae, or stabilized.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Drug Reactions, and Requirements for Immediate Reporting  
Ultragenyx or its designee must be notified of any SAE that occurs at any time during the reporting period within 24 hours of the Investigator, designee, or site personnel’s knowledge of the event. SAEs will be reported by [CONTACT_35720].  
Follow-up SAE information must be submitted in a timely manner as additional information 
becomes available. All SAEs regardless of r elationship to study drug must be followed to 
resolution or stabilization if improvement is not expected.  
All deaths, regardless of causality, occurring from the signing of the informed consent until 
[ADDRESS_551094] dose of study drug are to be reported as SAEs to Ultragenyx or its 
designee within 24 hours of knowledge.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy in Subject or Partner , and Requirements for Immediate 
Reporting  
Ultragenyx or its designee must be notified of the occurrence of any pregnancy in a subject 
or subject’s  partner that occurs  during the reporting period within 24 hours of the 
Investigator, designee, or site personnel’s knowledge of the event. Pregnancies will be reported by [CONTACT_435081]. Re ported pregnancy of a subject or a subject’s partner, while participating in the 
study, will be monitored for the full duration and/or followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known. In the event of a pregnancy in the partner of a subject, the Investigator should make every effort to obtain the female partner’s consent for release of protected health information. 
Ultragenyx or its designee must be notified of the outcome of the pregnancy within 24 hours 
of the Investigator, designee, or site personnel’s knowledge of the outcome. Pregnancy outcomes will be reported by [CONTACT_435082].

8.5.5 Communication Plan  
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting  
Ultragenyx or its designee will submit suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]R) to appropriate Regulatory Authorities (including Competent Authorities in all 
Member States concerned), Ethics Committees, and Investigators as per local laws and regulations. Fatal and life -threatening S[LOCATION_003]Rs w ill be submitted no later than [ADDRESS_551095] knowledge of the event and follow-up information submitted within an additional eight (8) days. All other S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be submitted within [ADDRESS_551096] knowledge of the event.  
The Investigator will notify the IRBs/ECs of SAEs and urgent safety matters, in accordance 
with IRB/EC requirements and local laws and regulations. A copy of this notification must 
be provided to Ultragenyx or its designee.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Urgent Safety Matters and Non -S[LOCATION_003]R Report ing 
Principal Investigators are required to report any urgent safety matters to Ultragenyx or its 
designee within 24 hours. Ultragenyx or its designee will inform the Regulatory Authorities, ECs, and Investigators of any events (e.g. change to the safety profile of UX007, major 
safety findings) that may occur during the clinical trial that do not fall within the definition of a S[LOCATION_003]R but may affect the safety of subjects participating in the clinical trials, as required, in accordance with applicable laws a nd regulations. The reporting period for urgent safety 
issues is the period from the signing of the ICF through [ADDRESS_551097] dose of 
study drug. 
The Investigator will notify the IRBs/ECs of urgent safety matters, in accordance with 
IRB/EC req uirements and local laws and regulations. A copy of this notification must be

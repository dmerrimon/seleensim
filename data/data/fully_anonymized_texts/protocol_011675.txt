 1. Background and Significance:   
Surgical site infection (SSI) following colorectal  surgery  is a frequent complication and 
results in higher morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. SSI following adult colorectal 
surgery  is a frequent complication that has been reported to occur in 5%-30% of cases 
nationally. Vanderbilt ’s SSI reported rate of infections in colorectal surgeries is currently 8%. 
Treatment for SSI can be challenging often requiring revision surgery, long-term antibiotics, 
and prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. The accurate identification of risk factors is thus important in 
the development of strategies to prevent these potentially devastating infections.  Vanderbilt 
performs approximately 1,000 colorectal cas es per year.   
 
The New CDC -definitions for surveillance of surgical site infections (1992) take into account 
3 classes of surgical site infections (SSI): superficial incisional SSI, deep incisional SSI, and 
organ/space SSI. The most prevalent  host-related risk factors for development of SSI are 
advanced age, morbid obesity, disease severity, an ASA score > 2, prolonged preoperative 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], and infection at distal sites. Microbial contamination of the surgical site occurs 
mainly during the surgical in tervention.  
 
Although exogenous contamination from the surgical suite may be of concern, especially in 
clean operations, most surgical site infections are caused by [CONTACT_307724]'s 
own skin flora. SSI rates vary according to the type and d uration of the surgical procedure. 
Proper surgical technique is probably the most important factor in the prevention of SSI.  
 
Modification of patient risk factors should be attempted whenever possible through use of 
adequate protocols for antimicrobial pr ophylaxis with antibiotics should be followed. Routine 
surveillance of surgical site infections is beneficial for SSI prevention and early detection. 
Additional prevention aimed at decreasing number of microorganisms  on patient’s skin pre -
operatively may d ecrease rates of SSI. Prior studies have reported daily use of 2% 
chlorhexidine  gluconate cloths has decreased rates of nosocomial bloodstream infections 
in those with central line cath eters. Another study reported decreasing SSIs up to 50% when 
nursing st aff instituted utilization of 2% chlorhexidine  gluconate cloths pre -op and daily post -
op cleansing in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. However, use of chlorhexidine  cloths pre -operatively has not been 
routinely instituted. Many hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307718] a protocol for their use. 
Therefore study of such a population may prove worthy, as currently VUMC colorectal 
patients use chlorhexidine  cloths  preoperative on the abdomen, groin and buttoc ks the night 
before surgery and again the morning of surgery.  
 
This study proposes a randomized, controlled trial of colorectal patients  of 2% chlorhexidine 
gluconate skin preparation cloths for the prevention of post op s urgical site infections in 
colore ctal patients .  
 
2. Hypothesis:  
Use of 2% chlorhexidine  gluconate cloths pre -operatively  and daily post-operatively 
(neckline to toes) will decrease surgical site infections ( SSI) by 30%  (study group)  when  
compared to patients who use chlorhexidine  cloths night before surgery and morning of 
surgery  (control group) . 
 
 
3. Study Objectives:  
 Randomize  consented patients pre -operative ly to either the study group (of 2%  
chlorhexidine  gluconate cloths pre -op night before  day of surgery and daily post -
Version:  09/14/2017

 op cleansing) or the control group with follow -up through discharge for evaluation 
of SSI  
 Evaluation for SSI development at 30 day (+ /-) post -op visit.  
 Measure change in skin flora by [CONTACT_307725] (baseline),  pre-
operative , day [ADDRESS_376611],  and at 
the 30 day follow up.   
 
4. Methods:  
Patients scheduled for colorectal surgery  will be evaluat ed and approached for interest. 
Consented subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (approximately 75 subjects per 
treatment arm)  through a block randomization table. Those enrolled into the study arm will 
receive the 2% chlorhexidine gluc onate cloths and  instructions for use from research 
personal. The subject will wash themselves neck to toe using Chlorhexidine gluconate wipes 
per study instructions the night before . Study staff will perform the CHG wipe application  on 
the day of surgical procedure. They  will then  receive post -op daily skin cleansings per 
protocol by [CONTACT_307726] [ADDRESS_376612] .  
 
Subjects  randomized to the control arm will receive Chlorhexidine gluconate wipes and 
instructi ons for use  per the previous colorectal surgical policy  (prior to September 2017) .   
 
On the day of surgery all subjects will have a n abdominal skin swab culture taken after 
cleansing with Chlorhexidine gluconate wipes.  We will also obtain abdominal  skin swab 
cultures at site of incision  post-op day 4, or  day  of discharge and at the 30 day follow up  
(+/- 7 days ). 
 
Both groups will be evaluated daily by [CONTACT_307727]-
op day [ADDRESS_376613].  A high definition pi[INVESTIGATOR_307719] (pi[INVESTIGATOR_307720] ) Additional  evaluation  will take place  at the 
[ADDRESS_376614]-operative  hosp ital units (eg:  not on 3/4 RW or 9 N/S).

150 patients will be enrolled.  
 
7. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:  
 
 Inclusion Criteria  
1. Patients > 18 years old scheduled for a colorectal surgical procedure  ASA>2 OR 
pre-operatively hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307721]  
1. Unable to consent  
2. Known allergy to any of the ingredients contained in SAGE chlorhexidine gluconate 
cloths  
3. Curre nt infection or history of abdominal  infections.  
4. Patients on chronic steroids or immunosuppressive medications.  
 
8. Data Collection:

10. Statistical Plan:  
We are planning a study of independent cases and controls with 1 control(s) per case.  Prior 
data indicate the rate of infection in the control group (those with risk factors, including 
superficial SSI) is 0.5, then just [ADDRESS_376615] a 50% or g reater reduction, with 
80% power. We can also design a statistical analysis plan that uses the grade of SSI instead 
of binary yes/no to indicate presence of SSI. This should increase the power as well, for 
instance, if the SAGE cloths reduce the severity o f (but does not completely prevent) 
infection in some patients.  
 
11. Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
All reasonable efforts will be made to keep a patient’s protected health information (PHI) 
private and confidential.   There will be limited access to electronic  medical records and de -
identification of all records.   Federal privacy guidelines will be followed when using or 
sharing any protected health information.  
 
Data will be stored in Redcap, a secure web -based database conforming to the latest 
Vanderbilt IS security policies. Data from the study will be reported only in the aggregate.  
 
A member of the research team at Vanderbilt University will travel to the other sites to assist 
with data collection. Under the supervision of each site’s PI, Vanderbilt resear ch team 
members will view research records and collect data as identified above. Medical records 
will be stored separately from the data and remain on -site. All de -identified data -points will 
be entered directly into Redcap, a secure web -based database. No  identified information 
will leave the site.  
 
 
All study staff have completed employee education regarding patient confidentiality and 
have completed Human Subjects protection education (CITI course) as specified by [CONTACT_219430].  
 
Through these inte rventions, we expect risks to privacy to be minimized.  
 
12. Follow -up and Record Retention  
Research Records will be retained by [CONTACT_307729] a period of six 
(6) years after the submission of the final report and close -out procedures on the research 
project for which the Research Records were prepared.  
 
The retention of t he original Research Records shall be the responsibility of the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_307723], but at all times shall remain the 
property of Department of Anesthesiology, unless otherwise specified by [CONTACT_2371], regulation or 
agreement.

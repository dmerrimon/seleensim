 1.2 Background and Rationale  
1.2.1 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_456753] -Risk Multiple  Myeloma  
In 2018, there were over 30,000 new cases of multiple myeloma (MM) and over 10,[ADDRESS_583629] been  identified  using clinical  biomarkers such as 
β2-microglobulin and albumin. Based on these two ma rkers, patients were classified into 3 risk - 
category groups in the International Staging System for Myeloma (ISS). With the advent of analytical methods that can diagnose chromosomal translocations, such as Fluorescence In Situ 
Hybridization (FISH), genomic changes were found to be independent risk factors for prognosis 
of multiple  myeloma  regardless  of treatment.  Based  on the International Myeloma Working Group 
(IMWG) consensus, high- risk chromosomal instabilities include translocations of the IgH locus 
on chromosome 14 with an oncogene such as FGFR3/MMSET on chromosome 4 (t(4;14)) or c - 
MAF  on chromosome 16 (t(14;16)) or MAFB  on chromosome 20 (t(14;20)).
3 These  translocations 
are observed in 15%, 4% and 1% of the newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) patients, 
respectively.4,5 Beside translocations, deletion of p53 on chromosome 17p, non-hyperdiploid 
karyotype, deletion  13 by [CONTACT_15314], and gain 1q/loss of 1p (seen  in 7%, 50% 44%, 30% of newly 
diagnosed multiple  myeloma  patients,  respectively)  are also associated  with poor survival. 4,[ADDRESS_583630] on the outcome of multiple myeloma  patients  while  their combination further reduces  overall  survival. For example,  the triple 
combination of an adverse IgH translocation, gain(1q), and del(17p) was associated  with a median 
overall  survival (OS)  of 9.1 months.
6 Chromosomal aberrations  showing improved outcomes were 
also identified, such as trisomies 3 and 5.7,8 When both favorable and unfavorable cytogenetics 
coincide in the same patient, the unfavorable findings tend to dominate the clinical  pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103]8,9. 
1.2.2 Definition of High -Risk Multiple  Myeloma  
High risk disease is defined by [CONTACT_456773].3 IMWG defines high-r isk disease as either R -
ISS Stage III or by [CONTACT_456774]- risk cytogenetic abnormalities (CAs). 3 R-ISS Stage III is 
defined as serum β -microglobulin ≥5.5 mg/L and either high risk CA by [CONTACT_456775].10 
High –risk CAs are 1) t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), del(17/17p), non- hyperdiploid karyotype, 
gain(1q), del 13, gain 1q, or a high- risk signature [CONTACT_456798] (GEP).  
 
1.2.[ADDRESS_583631]  of t(4;14) and possibly del(17p) on CR, PFS,  and 
OS.11-[ADDRESS_583632] -transplantation deep 
response rate (VGPR or better) were similar in high -risk cytogenetics (del(17p) and t(4;14)) and 
standard risk cytogenetics when bortezomib was used in the induction treatment.13 An integrated 
analysis of phase III trials demonstrates PFS benefit in patients with t(4;14) but lacking del(17p) and in del(17p) lacking t(4;14) but not in patients carrying both abnormalities.
16 Thus, a 
bortezomib- based induction regimen, and if patient is eligible followed by [CONTACT_456776]/ASCT, ideally  shortly after completion  of 6-[ADDRESS_583633] -negativity  in only 20% of patients17 and CR only 
in 30-35%18,[ADDRESS_583634] in frontline therapy but 
receive PI/lenalidomide  based  regimen,  achieve 15% CR20 and with addition of cyclophosphamide 
35% CR with only half of them being MRD negative.21 Thus, there is clear need for intensifying 
the upfront treatment in this patient population. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_305244], there is no consensus on the 
appropriate subsequent therapy for these patients. Prevailing approaches include proteasome 
inhibitor/immunomodula tory drug combination maintenance, a second autotransplant, or even an 
allotransplant.3,16,[ADDRESS_583635]  combined with 
a bortezomib -based treatment regimen partially abrogates poor PFS in patients carrying both 
t(4;14) and del(17p)16, and limited  data with RVD  maintenance given up to [ADDRESS_583636]-transplant 
suggests some benefit in a group with del p53, del 1p; (t(4;14) or t(14;16)) with an sCR rate of 
50%.[ADDRESS_583637] are limited by [CONTACT_456777]- related mortality (TRM), approaching 40% 
for myeloablative transplantations.[ADDRESS_583638]-line therapy  was originally  developed using multi- 
color flow cytometry,25 which has been widely used in several trials for multiple myeloma.26,27 
Due to their superior sensitivity, genomic testing like Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) or IgH 
became the preferred method of MRD testing. Specifically, flow cytometry -based MRD assa ys 
can detect 1 myeloma cell in 100,000 bone marrow cells; current genetic MRD assays can detect [ADDRESS_583639] testing should and will become a primary regulatory efficacy endpoint.3,22,34 
1.2.5 CAR- T Therapy in Multiple  Myeloma  
B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), also known as tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 
member 17 (TNFRSF17) or CD269, is consistently and selectively expressed on normal plasma 
and myeloma cells.35 For this reason, it is a preferred target antigen for CAR immunotherapy of 
MM. Upon engagement by [CONTACT_344752], i.e., TNFSF13 (APRIL: a proliferation- inducing ligand; 
CD256) and TNFSF13B  (BAFF:  B cell-activating  factor;  also known as BLYS  or CD257), BCMA 
supports survival of plasma  cells.[ADDRESS_583640] BCMA was originally developed at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and was introduced into CD3+ cells using a viral transduction system that inserts the gene permanently into the genome of  the T -cell. At the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 9x10
6 
cells/kg, 63% of the patients achieved very good partial response (VGPR) or better.[ADDRESS_583641] Bio’s anti- 
BCMA -CAR T -cell construct has completed its phase II trial in relapsed refractory patients who 
progressed after at least 2 lines of therapy demonstrated an impressive 85% overall response rate (ORR) with 45% of the patients having CR or better response.
38,[ADDRESS_583642] originally 
developed in China was recently evaluated in relapsed refractory patients during a Phase I  multi-

 center trial in [LOCATION_003] and showed  100% ORR with 61% of the patients achieving CR or better.[ADDRESS_583643] recorded serious instances of cytokine release syndrome 
(CRS)  and neurological toxicity.  In the recent  American  Society  of Blood and Marrow  Transplant 
(ASBMT) consensus meeting, CRS was defined as “a supraphysiologic response following any 
immune therapy that results in the activation or engagement of endogenous or infused T cells 
and/or other immune  effector  cells.  Symptoms c an be progressive, must  include fever  at the onset, 
and may include hypotension, capi[INVESTIGATOR_7946] (hypoxia) and end organ dysfunction.”[ADDRESS_583644] 14 days following the infusion. Severe cases appear to occur closer to the time of infusion and the severity of CRS was reported to correlate with peak CAR T -cell levels as 
mentioned above as well as disease burden
42,43 and addition of preconditioning 
chemotherapy.43,44,46,47 
Neurotoxicity associated  with CAR T- cell treatment,  now named  “Immune effector  cell-associated 
neurotoxicity syndrome” (ICANS) in the ASBMT consensus panel document, is described as “a disorder characterized  by a pathologic process  involving the central  nervous system  following any 
immune therapy that results in the activation or engagement of endogenous or infused T cells and/or other immune effector cells. Reported neurologic toxicities include headaches, confusion, 
alterations in wakefulness, hallucinations, dysphasia, ataxia, apraxia, facial nerve palsy, tremor, 
dysmetria,  and seizures
43-45,48- 53. Neurotoxicity  has been  reported  in several  anti-CD19  CAR T- cell 
trials and severe cerebral edema lead to death in a small number of patients54,55. However, it has 
occurred  less frequently in anti-BCMA  CAR T- cell trials37,39. Factors  that underlie CRS  like peak 
CAR T -cell levels44,46,54,[ADDRESS_583645] been developed for CAR T -cell-re lated CRS and neurotoxicity and 
this protocol uses grading developed based on ASBMT consensus criteria.41

 Safety, Adverse Events, Protocol Deviation and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_166175]  
5.1 Definitions  
5.1.1 Adverse Events  (AE)  
An adverse event  (AE)  is defined  as any reaction,  side effect,  or untoward event  that occurs  during 
the clinical trial associated with the use of a test article in humans, whether or not the event is considered  related  to the treatment  or clinically  significant.  For this study, AEs will include events 
reported  by [CONTACT_102],  as well as clinically  significant abnormal findings on physical examination 
or laboratory  evaluation. A new illness,  symptom, sign or worsening of a pre- existing  condition or 
abnormality is considered an AE. An abnormal laboratory value will be considered an AE if the laboratory abnormality is characterized by [CONTACT_456782]: 
• Results in discontinuation from the  study 
• Is associated with clinical signs or  symptoms 
• Requires treatment or any other therapeutic intervention 
• Is associated with death or another serious adverse event, including  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• Is judged by [CONTACT_456783], including clinically significant abnormal findings on laboratory evaluations, regardless 
of severity, will be followed until satisfactory resolution.  
 
5.1.[ADDRESS_583664] article  caused  the adverse event.  For the purposes of IND safety  reporting, “reasonable 
possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the test article and the adverse event.  A suspect ed adverse reaction  implies  less certainty  about causality  than adverse 
reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a test  article.  
 
5.1.3 Serious Unexpected Adverse Reaction  (S[LOCATION_003]R)  
An adverse event  or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  "unexpected"  if it is not listed  in the 
investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information 
described  in the general  investigational plan or elsewhere in the current  application. "Unexpected" 
also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of the test article or as anticipated  from the pharmacological 
properties of the drug but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the test article under investigation. 

DC11B Clinical Trial protocol, v 1.0  Page 34 of 61

Do not disclose or use except as authorized by [CONTACT_456772].   
 5.1.4 Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view of the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following:  
• Death within 30 days of Descartes -11 infusion 
• Grade 4 or 5 CRS, infusion reaction,  neurotoxicity 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (except for protocol - 
mandated ~24- hour admission for observation due to new -onset fever)  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions 
• A congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a SAE experience when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this  definition. 
 
 
5.1.[ADDRESS_583665] to report any sus pected adverse event(s) that 
might reasonably be related to participation in this study. The investigator should notify the Sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has discontinued or 
terminated study participation if th e event may reasonably be related to this study. The Sponsor 
should also be notified  if the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer  or of 
a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated in 
this study.  
 
5.2.2 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_456758] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise as  
DC11B Clinical Trial protocol, v 1.0  Page 35 of 61

Do not disclose or use except as authorized by [CONTACT_456772].   
 below. Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the 
condition meets  the criteria  for an adverse event.  Neither  the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in the following circumstances:  
 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] a preexisting condition. Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if 
the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was  uneventful. 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], 
unless there is clinical  worsening or an increase  in frequency  of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_456759]. 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_456760] -mandated 24- hour observation following new onset of fever 
following infusion of  Descartes -11. 
 
 
5.2.[ADDRESS_583666] be followed up to 
determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the 
presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital  abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn 
complications. Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Study Pregnancy Form and reported by [CONTACT_63405]. Pregnancy  follow -up should be recorded  on the same  form  and 
must include an assessmen t of the possible relationship to the study treatment of any pregnancy 
outcome. Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported on the SAE Report Form. 
Pregnancy outcomes must be collected for the female partners of any males who took study 
treatment  in this study. Consent to report information  regarding these  pregnancy outcomes should 
be obtained from the  mother. 
 
5.2.[ADDRESS_583667] during the adverse  event  recording  period  (defined  in  Section 5.2.1), the investigator must seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_71997], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148]. Information on all adverse events should be recorded 
immediately in the source document, and in the appropriate adverse event module of the case 
report form (CRF). All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures 
results  should be recorded  in the source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis. 
To the extent possible, adverse events should be recorded as a diagnosis and symptoms used to make the diagnosis recorded within the diagnosis event. Do not list symptoms if a diagnosis can 
be assigned. 
 
Conditions that were already present at the time of informed consent should be recorded in the 
Medical History CRF. Any condition listed in a subject’s medical history for which the severity 
increases at the time of, or post -Descartes -11 infusion, should be ca ptured as an adverse event.  
 
Adverse events (including lab abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a 
diagnosis whenever  possible, rather  than individual underlying signs and symptoms. When  a clear 
diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a separate Adverse Event. The clinical  course of each event  should be followed until resolution, stabilization,  or until 
DC11B Clinical Trial protocol, v 1.0  Page 36 of 61  
This document is the confidential property of the Cartesian Therapeutics.  
Do not disclose or use except as authorized by [CONTACT_456772].   
 it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause. As detailed as 
possible, each adverse event should be evaluated to determine:  
 
• The severity grade (CTCAE Version 5.0 Grade  1-5) 
• Its duration (start and end dates)  
• Its relati onship to the study treatment:  Is there a reasonable possibility  that the AE is related  to 
Descartes -11- No (unrelated) or Yes. If yes - is the event definitely, probably, possibly or 
unlikely related to the investigational treatment (Descartes -11). 
• Action taken with respect to study or investigational treatment (none, dose adjusted, 
temporarily interrupted, permanently discontinued, unknown, not  applicable)  
• Whether medication or therapy taken (i.e., no concomitant medication/non- drug therapy, 
concomitant medication/non-drug therapy) 
• Whether it is serious, as defined in Section  5.1. 
 
All adverse events should be treated appropriately. If a concomitant medication or non-drug therapy  is given, this action  should be recorded  on the Adverse Event CRF.  Adverse events  should 
be entered into the eCRF system within [ADDRESS_583668]. Once an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its resolution or until it is 
judged to be permanent, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if 
necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study treatment, the 
interventions required to treat it, and the  outcome. 
 
Progression of malignancy (including fatal outcomes), documented appropri ately in the medical 
records,  should not be reported  as a serious adverse event.  Adverse events  that occur  concurrently 
with the progression of malignancy but that are not related to disease progression (i.e., deep vein 
thrombosis) will be reported as an a dverse event as described  above. 
 
5.2.[ADDRESS_583669] be reported as follow -up information is received. An SAE occurring at a 
different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one 
should be reported separately as a new  event.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Sponsor Notification by [CONTACT_456784] 5.[ADDRESS_583670] symptoms if a diagnosis can be assigned. At the time of the 
initial notification, a serious adverse event (SAE) re port form should be filled. Following 
parameters will be asked in the form:  
• Subject  information  
• A description of the event (if there is a diagnosis, it should be  included) 
• Date of  onset 
DC11B Clinical Trial protocol, v 1.0  Page 37 of 61  
This document is the confidential property of the Cartesian Therapeutics.  
Do not disclose or use except as authorized by [CONTACT_456772].   
 • Current status  
• Whether study treatment was  discontinued 
• The reason why the event is classified as  serious 
• Investigator assessment of the association between the event and study  treatment  
• Concomitant medications when the event  happened 
• Narrative summary of the  event  
 
Follow-up information  on this event  should be reported  when  received.  The follow-up information 
should describe 1) whether  the event  has resolved  or continues, 2) if and how it was treated,  and 
3) whether the patient continued or withdrew from study participation.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  IRB Notification by [CONTACT_456785]:  
 
• Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, in terms 
of severity or frequency. For  example:  
• Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more frequent than 
initially  expected.  
• Chan ge in FDA safety labeling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device, or biologic 
used in a research  protocol. 
• Breach of  confidentiality.  
• Change to the protocol taken  without prior  IRB review  to eliminate  apparent  immediate  hazard 
to a research  participant. 
• Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks, or the complaint 
cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
• Protocol violation (meaning an accidental or unintentional deviation from the IRB approved protocol) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_456761].  
 
Deaths that occur during the study should be reported within the IRB -specified time frame. 
For reportable deaths, the initial submission to the IRB may be made by [CONTACT_456786].  The AE/Unanticipated  Problem Form is required  as a follow up to 
the initial  submission. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  FDA Notification by [CONTACT_456787]. These written notifications of adverse events are referred to as IND safety reports. The sponsor m ust 
report an IND safety report as described in: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/U

 The following  describes  the safety  reporting requirements  by [CONTACT_456788]:  
 
• Within  7 Calendar Days any study event  that is unexpected,  fatal or life-threatening  suspected 
adverse reaction.  
• Within  [ADDRESS_583671] on the Sponsor’s behalf,  consult with 
site investigators, review and synthesize safety information from the various clinical sites, and to apply study- stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]. All decisions by [CONTACT_456789], 
including the application of study- stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_456762] -escalation rules, will be documented in the 
study record.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_583672] the outcome (objectives), or 
compromises the safety and welfare of the subjects, the deviation must be reported to the medical monitor within three business days. Include the following information on the Sponsor -supplied 
exception/deviation form: protocol number, subject study number, description of the exception/deviation from protocol and rationale. Ensure all completed exception/deviation forms 
are signed by [CONTACT_456790]. Once approval of the exception request or acknowledgement of the deviation has been granted by [CONTACT_456791], the exception or deviation will be submitted to IRB 
and all other applicable committees.  
 
Other dev iations should be explained in a memo to file (example: a subject missing a visit is not 
an issue unless a critical/important treatment or procedure was missed and must have been performed at that specific time).  
 
5.5 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_456763] a regulatory authority decision, change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_456764]. Additionally, recruitment may be stopped for 
reasons of particularly low recruitment, protocol violations, or  inadequate data recording. 
Specifically, study will be stopped if:  
 
• Study Sponsor or a Regulatory Body decides for any reason that subject safety may be 
compromised by [CONTACT_456792]. 
• The Sponsor decides to discontinue the development of the intervention to be used in this 
study.

The study will be paused if:  
 
• There is death that is reasonably attributed to study drug within the first [ADDRESS_583673] 
infusion 
• Two subjects with Grade [ADDRESS_583674] to sample size: the primary endpoint will be the proportion of responders, 
i.e., patients  who are MRD -negative with sCR at the Day [ADDRESS_583675] -negative 
sCR at the end of consolidation, as observed in the literature. We determined that this natural rate 
is 10%.19,31,64,69-73 For purposes of power calculations, we assume that the response rate will be 
35%. With these assumptions, a sample size of 34 will provide 80% power to detect a one -tailed 
difference at the 95% confidence  level.

 Ethical Considerations  
7.1 General  Issues  
This study is to be conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice 
(FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable 
government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures. 
 
This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted i ndependent 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) for formal approval of the study conduct. The decision of the IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the investigator and a copy of 
this decision  will be provided to the sponsor before  commencement  of this study. The investigator 
should provide a list of IRB members and their affiliations to the  Sponsor. 
 
All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and providing sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this 
study. The consent form will be submitted with the protocol for review and approval by [CONTACT_271490]. The formal consent of a subject, using the IRB -approved consent form, must be 
obtained before that subject  is submitted  to any study procedure. This consent form  must  be signed 
by [CONTACT_17257], and the investigator -designated research 
professional obtaining the  consent. 
 
7.[ADDRESS_583676] limited life expectancies. Subjects from both genders and all 
racial/ethnic groups are eligible for this study if they meet the eligibility criteria. To date, there is 
no information that suggests that differences in disease response would be expected in one group 
compared to another. It is not considered reasonable to administer a previously uncharacterized 
cell therapy to preg nant or lactating women. Children do not develop MM. Efforts will be made 
to extend accrual to a representative population, but in this preliminary study, a balance must be struck  between  patient  safety  considerations and limitations  on the number of individuals exposed 
to potentially toxic and/or ineffective treatments on the one hand and the need to explore gender and ethnic aspects of clinical research on the other hand. If differences in outcome that correlate 
to gender or to ethnic identity are noted, accrual may be expanded, or a follow -up study may be 
written to investigate those differences more  fully.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_583677]  files,  and records  kept at the 
pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico -technical departments involved in the clinical trial. 
 
7.4.2 Case Report  Forms  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collecti on instrument for the study. All  data 
requested on the CRF must be recorded. All entries will be entered into an electronic data  capture 
system (eCRF). The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_379197], accurate, and that entry and updates are performed in a timely  manner.  
 
7.4.[ADDRESS_583678] ensure anonymity of the patients; patients must not be identified by [CONTACT_456793]. Signed informed consent forms  and patient  enrollment 
log must be kept strictly confidential to enable patient identification at the site. Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of the Health 
Insurance Portability  and Accountability  Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed 
subject authorization informing the subject of the  following: 
 
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this  study 
• Who will have access to that information and why 
• Who will use or disclose that  information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their  PHI. 
 
If a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the 
ability  to use all information  collected  prior  to the revocation  of subject  authorization. For subjects 
that have revoked authorization to collect  or use PHI,  attempts  should be made to obtain permission 
to collect at least vital status (i.e., that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study 
period. 
 
7.4.4 Records  Retention  
It is the sponsor’s responsibility to retain study essential documents f or at least [ADDRESS_583679]. These documents 
should be retained for a longer period if required by a Regulatory Body.

4 Safety,  Adver  se Events,  Pr otocol  Deviation  and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_166175]  
4.1 Definitions  
4.1.1 Adverse Events  (AE)  
An adverse event  (AE)  is defined  as any reaction,  side effect,  or untoward event  that occurs  during 
the clinical trial associated with the use of a test article  in humans, whether or not the event is 
considered  related  to the treatment  or clinically  significant.  For this study, AEs will include events 
reported  by [CONTACT_102],  as well as clinically  significant abnormal findings on physical examination 
or laboratory  evaluation. A new illness,  symptom, sign or worsening of a pre- existing  condition or 
abnormality is considered an AE. An abnormal laboratory value will be considered an AE if the laboratory abnormality is characterized by [CONTACT_79924] t he following: 
• Results in discontinuation from the  study 
• Is associated with clinical signs or  symptoms 
• Requires treatment or any other therapeutic intervention 
• Is associated with death or another serious adverse event, including  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• Is judged by [CONTACT_456783], including clinically significant abnormal findings on laboratory evaluations, regardless of severity, will be followed until satisfactory resolution.  
 
4.1.[ADDRESS_583691] article  caused  the adverse event.  For the purposes of IND safety  reporting, “reasonable 
possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the test article and 
the adverse event.  A suspected  adverse reaction  implies  less certainty  about causality  than adverse 
reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a test  article.  
 
4.1.3 Serious Unexpected Adverse Reaction  (S[LOCATION_003]R)  
An adverse event  or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  "unexpected"  if it is not listed  in the 
investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an 
investi gator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information 
described  in the general  investigational plan or elsewhere in the current  application. "Unexpected"  
DC11B Clinical Trial protocol, v 1.[ADDRESS_583692] article under 
investigatio n. 
 
4.1.4 Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view of the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following:  
 
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a SAE experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or s urgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this  definition. 
 
 
4.1.[ADDRESS_583693] to report any suspected adverse event(s) that 
might reasonably be related to participation in this study. The investigator should notify the 
Sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has discontinued or 
terminated study participation if the event may reasonably be related to this study. The Sponsor 
should also be notified  if the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer  or of 
a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated in this study.

 condition meets  the criteria  for an adverse event.  Neither  the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in the following  circumstances:

the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was  uneventful. 
• Hospit alization or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_238586], 
unless there is clinical worsening or an increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_456770].

determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the 
presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn 
complications. Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Study Pregnancy Form and reported 
by [CONTACT_63405]. Pregnancy follow -up should be recorded  on the same  form  and 
must include an assessment of the possible relationship to the study treatment of any pregnancy outcome. Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported on the SAE Report Form. 
Pregnancy outcomes must be collected for the female partners of any males who took study 
treatment  in this study. Consent to report information  regarding these  pregnancy outcomes should 
be obtained from the  mother. 
 
4.2.4 Recording of Adverse Events  
Information on all adverse events should be recorded immediately in the source document, and in 
the appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF). All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures  results  should be recorded  in the source document, 
though should be grouped under one diagnosis. To the extent possible, adverse events should be recorded as a diagnosis and symptoms used to make the diagnosis recorded within the diagnosis 
event. Do not list symptoms if a diagnosis can be  assigne d. 
 
Adverse events (including lab abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a 
diagnosis whenever  possible, rather  than individual underlying signs and symptoms. When  a clear 
diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a separate Adverse Event. The clinical  course of each event  should be followed until resolution, stabilization,  or until 
it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause. As detailed as possible, each adverse ev ent should be evaluated to determine:  
 
• The severity grade (CTCAE Version 5.0 Grade  1-5) 
• Its duration (start and end dates)  
• Its relationship to the leukapheresis procedure Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to procedure - No (unrelated)  or Yes. If yes - is the event definitely, probably, possibly 
or unlikely  related

Do not disclose or use except as authorized by [CONTACT_456772].   
 • Action taken with respect to study or investigational treatment (none, dose adjusted, 
temporarily interrupted, permanently discontinued, unknown, not  applicable)  
• Whether medication or therapy taken (i.e., no concomitant medication/non- drug therapy, 
concomitant medication/non-drug therapy) 
• Whether it is serious, as defined in Section  5.1. 
 
All adverse events should be treated appropriately. If a concomitant medication or non-drug 
therapy  is given, this action  should be recorded  on the Adverse Event CRF.  Adverse events  should 
be entered into the eCRF system within [ADDRESS_583695]. Once an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its resolution or until it is 
judged to be permanent, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if 
necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study treatment, the 
interventions required to treat it, and the  outcome. 
 
Progression of malignancy (including fatal outcomes), documented appropriately in the medical records,  should not be reported  as a serious adverse event.  Adverse events  that occur  concurrently 
with the progression of malignancy but that are not related to disease progression (i.e., deep vein thrombosis) will be reported as an adverse event as described above. 
 
4.2.[ADDRESS_583696] be reported as fol low-up information is received. An SAE occurring at a different time 
interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one should be reported separately as a new event.

initial notification, a serious adverse event (SAE) report form should be filled. Following 
parameters will be asked in the form:  
 
• Subject  information  
• A description of the event (if there is a diagnosis, it should be  included) 
• Date of onset 
• Current status  
• Whether study treatment was  discontinued 
• The reason why the event is classified as  serious 
• Investigator assessment of the association between the event and  procedure 
• Concomitant medications when the event  happened 
• Narrative summary  of the  event

 Follow-up information  on this event  should be reported  when  received.  The follow-up information 
should describe 1) whether  the event  has resolved  or continues, 2) if and how it was treated,  and 
3) whether the patient continued or withdrew from study participation.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  IRB Notification by [CONTACT_456785]:  
 
• Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, in terms 
of severity or frequency. For  example:  
• Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more frequent than 
initially  expected.  
• Breach of  confidentiality.  
• Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate 
hazard to a research  participant.  
• Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks, or the complaint 
cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_827].  
• Protocol violation (meaning an accidental or unintentional deviation from the IRB approved 
protocol) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_456771].  
 
Deaths that occur during the study should be reported within the IRB -specified time frame. 
For reportable deaths, the initial submission to the IRB may be made by [CONTACT_456786].  The AE/Unanticipated  Problem Form is required  as a follow up to 
the initial  submission. 
 
5. Ethical Consider  ations  
5.1 General  Issues 
This study is to be conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice 
(FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures. 
 
This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted i ndependent 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) for formal approval of the study conduct. The decision of the IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the investigator and a copy of 
this decision  will be provided to the sponsor before  commencement  of this study. The investigator 
should provide a list of IRB members and their affiliations to the  Sponsor. 
 
All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and providing sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this 
study. The consent form will be submitted with the protocol for review and approval by [CONTACT_271490]. The formal consent of a subject, using the IRB -approved consent form, must be 
obtained  before that subject  is submitted  to any study procedure. This consent form  must  be signed 
DC11B Clinical Trial protocol, v 1.[ADDRESS_583698] benefit of the procedure. These subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_1268] [CONTACT_19618]’s clinical trial at a site that has an open treatment protocol 
involving Descartes -11. Subjects  identified  for the Descartes -[ADDRESS_583699] ensure anonymity of the patients; patients must not be identified by [CONTACT_456796]. Signed inf ormed  consent forms  and patient  enrollment 
log must be kept strictly confidential to enable patient identification at the site. Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of the Health 
Insurance Por tability  and Accountability  Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed 
subject authorization informing the subject of the  following: 
 
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this  study 
• Who will have access to that information and  why 
• Who will use or disclose that  information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their  PHI. 
 
If a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability  to use all information  collected  prior  to the revocation  of subject  authorization. For subjects 
that have revoked authorization to collect  or use PHI,  attempts  should be made to obtain permission 
to collect at least vital status (i.e., that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study 
period.

 1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND/OR SCHEMA 
 
This is a phase  I/II pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], rando mized trial that will compare enoxaparin to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_618860]. The goal of this study is to determine whether a  randomized trial 
comparing these  different antithrombotic strategies in patients with canc er and  ische mic 
stroke is safe and feasible. Patients will be randomized to six months of enoxaparin or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_618861]. 
 
2.0 OBJECTIVES AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS 
 
Primary aim: To determine whether a randomized trial comparing enoxaparin to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_618862]. All potentially eligible patients will be rigorously screened  for 
and approached  by a study investigator for en rollment. The primary feasibility outcome will 
be defined as an enrollment rate of ≥30% for eligible patients. Second ary feasibility 
outcomes will be defined as a dropout or crosso ver rate of ≤20% for randomized patients, 
and adhe rence  to study drug in ≥75% of enrolled patients. 
 
Seconda ry aims: (1) To obtain a preliminary evaluation of the safety of enoxaparin and 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_618863]. The safety endpo ints will 
cons ist of intracranial he morrhage, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, major bleeding, 
and death. (2) To obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of enoxaparin and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_618864] a future 
multi-center trial. Secon dary efficacy endpo ints will include recurrent ischemic stroke, other 
thromboembolic events and several functional o utcome asse ssments. 
 
3.0 BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE 
 
Cerebrovascu lar disease  is second  only to metastases as a CNS manifestation of canc er 
(Graus et al 1985 ). Ischemic strokes, which account for ha lf of these  events, frequently arise 
from unusual  stroke mechanisms due to acquired hypercoagulability from the cancer or 
complications of its therapy (Graus et al 198 5; Seok et al 201 0; Navi and  Segal 200 8). Many 
factors contribute to this prothrombotic state, including secreted procoagulant substance s, 
inflammatory cytokines, increased  affinity between tumor ce lls and blood, endo thelial 
dysfunction, and abno rmal protein metabolism (Caine et al 2002). In the largest au topsy - 
based  series to date, the two leading causes of symptomatic ische mic stroke were marantic 
endoca rditis and cerebral intravascu lar coagulation, both manifestations of hypercoagulability 
(Graus et al 1985 ). Based on these  histopathologic correlations and few anecdo tal case 
series, so me experts and guidelines recommend anticoagulation as the first-line treatment 
for seconda ry stroke prevention in patients with cancer  and ischemic stroke (Salem et al  
2004;  Rogers 2010). In addition, many ph ysicians favor heparin over warfarin because  of 
data from small case  series and extrapolation from a trial on  venous  thromboembolic disease  
(Graus et al 1985; Lee  et al 2003 ). 
 
Conversely, most modern clinical se ries of patients with systemic canc er and ische mic stroke 
have not supp orted a prominent role of hypercoagulability in stroke pathophysiology. In fact, 
one large observational s tudy found  coagulopathy and marantic endocarditis to account  for

 only 12% and 3% of all strokes, respe ctively (Cestari et al 200 4). Another similar study found 
atherosclerosis to be the most common cause  of ische mic stroke in patients with malignanc y, 
and thus proposed antiplatelet agents to be sufficient therapy for most patients with canc er 
and stroke (Chaturvedi et  al 199 4). Furthermore, many historic indications for anticoagulation 
in ische mic stroke in the non-cancer popu lation have not been  suppo rted by [CONTACT_618892] 
(Chimowitz et al 2005; Mohr et al 200 1). Given the conflicting observational da ta and the 
increased  risk of bleeding from bone  marrow supp ression and frequent invasive procedu res 
in patients with cance r, a clinical trial is nece ssary to determine the optimal seconda ry stroke 
prevention regiment (e.g., anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents) for these  patients. 
 
Our proposed  study would be a significant step in optimizing the management of patients 
with systemic cancer a nd acute ische mic stroke because  it would determine if a clinical trial 
comparing anticoagulant (enoxaparin) and antiplatelet therapy (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]) in patients with 
cancer  and stroke is feasible, and it would provide a preliminary evaluation of the safety of 
these  different strategies. The former question is particularly germane as patients with 
cancer may be hesitant to enroll in a seconda ry stroke prevention trial be cause of conc erns 
over potential medication interactions and the dynamic nature of onco logical ca re. Once 
completed, the findings from this study would streamline the methodo logical planning and 
sample size calculations for a larger, multi-center trial that would conc lusively determine the 
ideal an tithrombotic regiment for these  patients. Such a trial would enhance  physician 
practice patterns, ultimately leading to decreased  morbidity and improved patient outcomes. 
 
4.0 OVERVIEW OF STUDY  DESIGN/INT ERVENTION

Sloan-Kettering Cancer  Center (MSKCC ), Weill Cornell Medical Center (WCMC) or New 
York-Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_307] (NYPH )/Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) as an 
inpatient or outpatient with an acute ischemic stroke within the prior four weeks.  Patients will 
be randomly assigned to receive 6 months of subcutaneous  enoxaparin (1 mg/kg BID with a 
maximum starting dose  of 100 mg BID) or 6 months of oral asp irin (81 mg per day  unless a 
higher dose  is preferred by [CONTACT_618893] a conco mitant medical cond ition, 
such  as coronary artery disease,  although the maximum acce ptable dose  will be 325 mg per 
day).

and can receive study drug within 1 week of randomization. 
 
5.0 THERAPEUTIC/D IAGNOSTIC AGENTS 
 
Enoxaparin sodium (Lovenox  ®)  is a low-molecular weight heparin that is approved by [CONTACT_618894], total hip and knee 
replacement, and  medical pa tients with immobility during acute illness; the treatment of acute 
deep  vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism; the prophylaxis of ischemic complications of 
unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction; and the treatment of acute ST- 
segment e levation myocardial infarction. It is also frequently used  “off-label” for the 
prevention of recurrent stroke and other thromboembolic events in patients with ische mic 
stroke and hypercoagulable states, including active cance r. 
 
Enoxaparin is manufactured by [CONTACT_13225]-Aventis U.S., Inc. and is derived from the intestinal 
mucosa  of pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]. It is available as prefilled syringes (30 mg/0.3 ml, 40 mg/0.4 ml), graduated 
prefilled syringes (60 mg/0.6 ml, 80 mg/0.8 ml, 100 mg/1 ml, 120  mg/0.8 ml, 150 mg/1 ml), or 
multiple dose  vials (300 mg/3.0 ml). It is administered subc utaneous ly once or twice a day 
depend ing on the indication. Commercially available drug will be used  for this study. 
 
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (originally Bayer ®), also known as acetylsalicylic acid, is an over-the-counter 
salicylate drug manufactured by [CONTACT_618895], that has an 
antiplatelet effect by [CONTACT_618896]. It is approved by [CONTACT_618897], coronary artery disease,  and myocardial infarction, as 
well as the treatment of rheumatological cond itions and pain. It is administered orally or per 
rectum, and  is available in chewable, enteric-coated, immediate-release, and controlled- 
relase forms; available doses  include 60, 8 1, 120, 162, 200, 300, 325, 50 0, 650, 800, and  
975 mg. For this study, subjects will be told to preferentially purchase  regular immediate- 
release  81 mg tabs for oral use  . However, other oral formulations (e.g., chewable, enteric- 
coated, or co ntrolled-release forms) and  higher d oses up to [ADDRESS_822727] ELIGIBILITY

7.0 RECRUIT MENT PLAN 
 
A total of 40 patients will be recruited from the Neurology inpatient and  consultation 
censuses  at the main MSKCC campus, MSKCC outpatient ce nters, WCMC and 
NYPH /CUMC through screening condu cted by [CONTACT_618898]. MSKCC is expected to accrue [ADDRESS_822730] sign 
written informed consen t. There are no gender or  racial restrictions. 
 
In order to satisfy all of the study’s feasibility endpo ints, MSKCC, WCMC and NYPH /CUMC 
staff will screen all ischemic stroke patients and will systematically record the total number of 
patients with ischemic stroke, the total number with ische mic stroke and active systemic 
cance r, the total number that a re eligible for the trial (and if not e ligible the reason (s) why), 
the total number approached for enrollment, and the total number en rolled. 
 
Patients who drop out of the study before the 3-month timepoint for reaso ns other than a 
safety or efficacy event or death will be replaced.  
 
Potential research subjects will be identified by a member of the patient’s treatment team, a 
protocol investigator, or resea rch team. If the investigator is a member of the treatment team, 
MEMORIAL SLOAN-KETTERING  CANCER CENTER 
IRB PROTOCOL  
IRB#: 12-264 A(11) 
Amended: 06 -APR-2016  
Page  8 of 29  
 he or she  will screen their patient’s medical records for suitable research study participants 
and discuss  the study and their potential for enrolling in the research study. Potential 
subjects contact[CONTACT_108540]/research 
staff of the study. 
 
The principal investigators may also screen the medical records of patients with whom they 
do not ha ve a treatment relationsh ip for the limited purpose  of identifying patients who would 
be eligible to enroll in the study and to record appropriate contact [CONTACT_618899]. 
 
During the initial con versation between the investigator/research staff and  the patient, the 
patient may be asked to provide certain health information that is necess ary to the 
recruitment and  enrollment process. The investigator/research staff may also review portions 
of their medical records in order to further assess  eligibility. They will use the information 
provided by [CONTACT_5363]/or medical record to confirm that the patient is eligible and to 
contact [CONTACT_108541]. If the patient turns to to be ineligible for the 
resea rch study, the research staff will destroy all information collected on the patient du ring 
the initial con versation and medial records review, except for any information that must be 
maintained for sc reening log purposes. 
 
In most case s, the initial con tact with the prospe ctive subject will be conduc ted either by [CONTACT_449818], investigator, or the resea rch staff working in consu ltation with the treatment 
team. The recruitment p rocess  outlined presents no more than minimal risk to the privacy of 
the patients who are screened  and minimal PHI will be maintained as part of a screening log. 
For these  reason s, we seek a (partial) limited waiver of authorization for the purposes  of (1) 
reviewing medical records to identify potential research subjects and obtain information 
relevant to the enrollment process; (2) con versing with patients regarding poss ible 
enrollment; (3) hand ling of PHI contained within those  records and provided by [CONTACT_565937]; and  (4) maintaining information in a screening log of patients approached  (if 
applicable). 
 
This limited waiver will app ly only to MSKCC . Any participating sites that require a limited 
waiver must ob tain it from their own local IRB/Privacy Board (PB) via a separate protocol 
addendum  or request. It is the respons ibility of the MSKCC staff to confirm the participating 
data collection site(s) have a limited waiver approved by [CONTACT_9918](s)/PBs.

9.0 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  PLAN 
 
9.1 Subcu taneous  Enoxapar in 
 
Half the study patients (n=20) will be rando mized to subcu taneous enoxaparin. This medicine 
will be injected twice daily at a dose of 1 mg/kg with a maximum starting dose of 100 mg BID. 
Patients who weigh more than 100 kg will start at a dose  of 100 mg BID; their subs equent 
dosing will be guided by [CONTACT_618900]. Treatment is routine, and shou ld 
begin within 7 days of randomization (either inpatient or ou tpatient) and continue for 6 
months. A registered nurse will teach  patients randomized to the enoxaparin arm how  to 
perform subc utaneous  injections; in cases  of significant patient hand icap, a  surrogate of the 
patient will be taught to perform the injections. 
 
9.2 Oral Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_618866] (n=20) will be randomized to oral asp irin. The medicine will 
be administered daily at a dose  of 81 mg unless a conc omitant medical condition, such  as 
coronary artery disease, dictates a higher dose  of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_618867] 
(maximum dose  325 mg daily). Treatment is routine, and shou ld begin within 7 days of 
rando mization (either inpatient or outpatient) and  continue for 6 months. 
 
9.3 Medications to Avoid 
 
The following medications shou ld be avoided during the course of the study in order to 
reduce  the risk of bleeding side effects: clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (Plavix®), prasugrel (Effient®), ticlopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] 
(Ticlid®), cilostazol (Pletal®), dipyridamole (Persantine®, Aggrenox®), ticagrelor (Brilinta®), 
abciximab (Reopro®), antithrombin (Atryn®), antithrombin III (Thrombate III®), argatroban 
(Argatroban ®), dab igatran (Pradaxa®), dalteparin (Fragmin®), danapa roid (Orgaran®), 
Desirudin (Iprivask®), fondapa rinux (Arixtra®), lepi[INVESTIGATOR_8412] (Refludan ®), tinzaparin (Innohep ®), 
warfarin (Coumadin®), rivaroxaban  (Xarelto®), api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]  (Eliquis®), urokinase 
(Abbokinase ®, Kinlytic®), reteplase (Retavase®), and tenec eteplase (TNKase®), 
 
Alteplase (Activase®) should also be avoided in patients randomized to the enoxaparin arm;

 10.0 EVALUATION D URING TREATMENT/INT ERVENTION  
 
Routine blood tests consisting of CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel  (see append ix F), 
PT, PTT, INR, D-Dimer, and fibrinogen will be performed at 2 weeks (+/- 4 days) and 1 
month (+/- 4 days) after treatment initiation for safety and efficacy purposes in accordance 
with standard clinical practice. 
 
Patients will be evaluated by a study investigator at 1 month (+/- 1 week), 3 months (+/- 1 
week), and  6 months (+/- 1 week) after treatment initiation by [CONTACT_618901], which can occur at 
MSKCC’ s main hosp ital and Basking Ridge, Commack and West Harrison regional ne twork 
sites, WCMC, and NYPH /CUMC. The clinical visit will cons ist of history taking and physical 
examination, and will assess  for adherence  to study drug (using the 8-point Morisky 
medication adherence  scale) and any symptoms or signs of clinical thromboembolism, 
bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], or s erious adverse events. The study investigator will also assess 
functional o utcomes by [CONTACT_746] a modified Rankin Scale (mRS), a National Institute of 
Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS ), and a Karnofsky Performance  Status Scale (KPSS ). 
Investigators administering the mRS and NIHSS will be certified to do so. If patients are 
unavailable for an in-person follow-up or their medical cond ition prohibits them from 
participating, then the patient or their surrogate will be interviewed instead by [CONTACT_618902]. Telephone  interviews will cons ist of the 
same assessments as the clinical visit except that there will be no physical examination or 
NIHSS, as these  interventions can only be performed in person. 
 
The 8-point Morisky medication adhe rence  scale (MMAS) is a validated and reliable drug 
adhe rence  scale that is commonly used  to monitor adherence  over the course of a treatment 
(see append ix A) (Morisky et al 2008 ). The scale cons ists of eight questions on medication- 
taking beha vior and was originally developed  to evaluate patient adherence to blood 
pressu re medicines but has been  effectively used for numerous chronic disorders. Response 
choices are yes/no for items 1 through 7, while item 8 cons ists of a 5-point Likert scale. For 
items 1 through 7, each  response  “no” equals 1 point and each response  “yes” equals 0 
points, except for item 5, in which a “yes” respon se equals 1 point and a “no” response 
equals 0 points. For item 8, if a patient chooses response  “0”, they receive 1 point, while 
responses  “1”, “2”, “3”, and “4” equate to 0.75, 0 .5, 0.25, and  0 points, respectively. The 
MMAS will be completed by [CONTACT_618903] (1, 3, and 6 months) and 
study drug adherence  will be defined as a mean total score of ≥[ADDRESS_822732] 
demonstrated this cutpoint to effectively differentiate between low and medium or high 
adhe rence.  
 
The mRS is a validated and widely used  neurological disability scale that measu res patients’ 
ability to perform activities of daily living. The score ranges from 0  to 6, with 0 indicating no 
symptoms and 6 representing death (see append ix B). Patients’ scores will be calculated by 
a study investigator sho rtly after the interview with the assistance  of a structured 
questionna ire (for reference only). All study investigators performing the mRS will have 
completed an instructional cou rse and be certified in calculating the score prior to the start of

The KPSS is a reliable and commonly used  performance  scale that quantifies canc er 
patients’ functional status (Karnofsky and Burchenal 1949;  Ma et al 2010 ). The score is often 
used  by [CONTACT_618904]’ eligibility for clinical trials, estimate prognosis, 
and predict toxicity and likelihood  of response  to therapy. The score ranges from 100  to 0, 
where 100 is normal with no signs of disease  or patient complaints and 0 is death (see 
append ix E). Patients’ scores will be calculated by a study investigator shortly after the 
neurologic examination that will evaluate patients’ activity level and  need  for assistance. All 
study investigators performing the score will work primarily in a cancer ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_618869].

11.0 TOXICITI ES/SIDE EFFECTS 
 
The greatest risk to patients is hemorrhage from study drugs, pa rticularly the low molecular 
weight hepa rin enoxaparin. This medication has never been  systematically assessed  in 
cancer  patients with acute stroke, so  rates of major hemorrhage must be estimated from 
studies of patients with cancer  or stroke in isolation. 
 
The low molecular weight heparin, dalteparin, was assoc iated with a 6% 6-month rate of 
major bleeding but only one case  (0.3% of coho rt) of intracranial hemorrhage in a large

 rando mized trial of patients with canc er and deep  vein thrombosis (Lee et al 2003 ). Low 
molecular weight hepa rin has also been  associated with a slightly increased  risk of major 
hemorrhage in stroke trials performed in the general popu lation (Bath et al 2001; T OAST 
investigators 1998 ). However, canc er patients are intrinsically hypercoagulable, so a small 
excess risk of major he morrhage may be outweighed by [CONTACT_618907]. 
Furthermore, desp ite little suppo rtive data, an ticoagulation is routinely used  for the treatment 
of ischemic stroke in patients with canc er, highlighting the need  for a trial to assess  the 
safety and feasib ility of this practice. 
 
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_618871] a small increased risk of systemic and intracranial 
hemorrhage (1-2% overall rate of major bleeding, mostly due to gastrointestinal 
hemorrhages); however, its cardiovascular benefits clearly outweigh these risks (CAST 
Collaborative group 1997; IST Collaborative group 1997 ). 
 
If intracranial he morrhage or major bleeding occurs (see definitions in section 12.0), the 
patient’s study drug (enoxaparin or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]) will be discon tinued, and  the patient will be 
referred for emergency medical evaluation. Furthermore, dose  modifications will not be 
allowed for participants experiencing these  major side effects while in this study. Therefore, 
any unaccep table toxicity reported by a participant will be cons idered reason for removal 
from the study, unless otherwise indicated by [CONTACT_618908] /or co -principal 
investigator. 
 
In the event of minor b leeding or other minor adverse events, the study drug can be held 
temporarily at the discretion of the treating physician. In such circumstances, the study drug 
shou ld be restarted at a later time point when deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_1963]. 
Adverse events will be graded  using version 4.0 of the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events. 
Other potential risks to patients from study drugs include: 
Enoxaparin 
 
• <10%: injection site ecchymosis and hematoma, easy  bleeding from minor cuts or 
wounds,  elevated liver enzymes. 
• <5%: an emia, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, thrombocytopen ia. 
• <1%: a llergic reaction, heparin-induced  thrombocytopen ia. 
 
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 
 
• <10%: easy  bleeding from minor cu ts or wounds.  
• <5%: d yspeps ia, nausea or vomiting, dizziness.  
• <1%: a llergic reaction, renal d ysfunction, hea ring loss or tinnitus. 
 
If a patient is discovered at any time to have a platelet count < 70 ,000/mm3, hemoglobin < 7 
gm/dl, PTT > 80 second s, INR > 3, or c reatinine > 2.5 mg/dl because  of chemotherapy or 
other medical reason s, then the patient’s study drug will be temporarily discon tinued  and 
weekly, relevant blood tests will be performed. The study drug will only be reinstituted if the 
abno rmal laboratory values return to acce ptable levels as deemed by [CONTACT_618909] /or co - 
principal investigator. Treating physicians will also be enco uraged to contact [CONTACT_618910]-KETTERING  CANCER CENTER

12.0 CRIT ERIA FOR TH ERAPEUTIC R ESPONSE/OUTCO ME ASSES SMENT 
 
Primary safety and secondary efficacy outcomes will be assessed  for by  a study investigator 
at 1 month (+/- 1 week), 3 months (+/- 1 week), and 6 months (+/- 1 week)  after initiation of 
treatment by [CONTACT_618911] /or surrogate via an in-person visit or phone 
conversation and by [CONTACT_618912]. The occurrence of an outcome 
will be dichotomized as yes or no, a lthough a single patient may have multiple outcomes. 
The outcomes of interest are defined as follows: 
 
Safety Outcomes 
 
Intracranial Hemorrhage: Acute extravasation of blood into the brain parenchyma, 
suba rachno id space, subdural spac e, or epi[INVESTIGATOR_618872], 
surgical exploration, or autopsy. 
 
Symptomatic Intracranial Hemorrhage: Intracranial bleeding associated with any clinical 
deterioration or assoc iated with death. 
 
Major Bleeding: Bleeding assoc iated with death; any intracranial hemorrhage; or a systemic 
hemorrhage requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], blood transfusion, or surgery. 
 
Efficacy Outcomes 
 
Ischemic Stroke: New neurologic deficit(s) with CT or MRI evidence  of acute ischemia in a 
referable location, and  no clinical or  radiologic indication of a non-cerebrovascular mimic as 
the etiology of the deficit(s). 
 
Transient Ischemic Attack: Transient neurologic deficit lasting less than [ADDRESS_822736] or

Myoca rdial Infarction: Any combination of two of the following three criteria: chest pain, 
elevated cardiac enzymes (as per spec ific laboratory guidelines), or d ynamic ECG cha nges 
cons istent with ische mia. 
 
Deep Vein Thrombosis: Thrombosis of the deep  venous  circulation diagnosed via Doppler

14.0 BIOSTATISTICS 
 
Patients will be rando mized at registration to receive 6 months of subcutaneous  enoxaparin 
or 6 months of oral asp irin. Please  see section 15.2 for de tails about this proces s. 
 
The enrollment rate will be the proportion of eligible patients who enroll in the study. The 
study will be cons idered feasible if the lower bound of the 95% confidence  interval (CI) of the 
enrollment rate exceeds 30%.  Therefore, our feasibility criterion will be met if [ADDRESS_822738] 
100 (40%; 95%  CI, 30.3-50.3%) screened  and eligible patients enroll. However, even if our 
feasibility criterion is not met, we will con tinue to target up  to another 50  patients (for a total 
of 150 targeted patients) in an attempt to enroll [ADDRESS_822739] a  30% recruitment rate in eligible 
patients and a 10% dropout rate among randomized patients, and  given that MSKCC, 
WCMC and  CUMC care for app roximately 280  total pa tients with cancer and recent stroke 
per year, and  roughly 15% of these  patients would be eligible for this trial (based  on 2015 
data and the current e ligibility criteria), we anticipate a total en rollment period of [ADDRESS_822740] 
clinically relevant differences in efficacy outcomes. All outcomes will be assessed  for 
occu rrence approximately at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after initiation of the study 
drug, and  are defined in detail in the Criteria for The rapeu tic Respo nse/Outcome 
Assess ment section. 
 
The primary feasibility outcome will be the enrollment rate among eligible patients (i.e., 
screened  patients that fulfill all subject inclusion and exclusion criterion regardless of whether 
they are approached  for enrollment by  a study investigator); our target enrollment rate is

 ≥30%. Patients who enroll into the study but then dropout or c rossover will still be cons idered 
succes sfully enrolled. 
 
Seconda ry feasibility outcomes will be the dropout or crosso ver rate among randomized 
patients and the study drug adhe rence  rate among enrolled patients; the target dropout or 
crosso ver rate is ≤20% and the target adhe rence rate is ≥75%. Study drug adhe rence  is 
cons idered a dichotomous variable for individual patients in this study and will be determined 
by [CONTACT_941] 8-point MMAS. Patients whose  mean total MMAS sco re is ≥[ADDRESS_822741] of intracranial hemorrhage, symptomatic intracranial 
hemorrhage, major bleeding, and  death. Because  the study’s target sa mple size is small and 
our second ary aim is to only obtain preliminary data on the safety of study drugs (not to 
perform formal analysis of safety data), there will be no pre-spec ified stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_618874]. However, an external MSKCC da ta and safety monitoring board will periodically review 
all potential ad verse events and will have the authority to stop further enrollment based  on 
any safety concerns. 
 
Seconda ry efficacy outcomes will include: recurrent ischemic stroke; all strokes (ischemic or 
hemorrhagic); a thromboembolic event composite cons isting of recurrent ischemic stroke, 
transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, pu lmonary embolism, 
or systemic arterial thrombosis; the modified Rankin Scale at 1, 3  and 6 months (van Swieten 
et al 1988); the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale at 1, 3 and 6 months (Brott et al 
1989 ); and  the Karnofsky Performance  Status Scale at 1, [ADDRESS_822742] will be used  to compare the 
rates of safety and efficacy outcomes between groups  for dichotomous variables, and 
analysis of covariance  (ANCOVA) will be used  to evaluate differences in continuous 
variables over time accounting for pre-treatment values. Our primary analysis will use the 
intention-to-treat p rinciple, but we will also perform a second ary as-treated analysis. 
Therefore, for our primary (intention-to-treat) ana lysis, outcomes will be analyzed acco rding 
to patients’ rando mized study drug, regardless of prior anti-thrombotic use in the period 
between stroke onset and study drug initiation or the duration of study drug. 
 
Since this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_618875], we will be 
unde rpowered to detect any significant d ifferences between groups  for our seconda ry 
efficacy outcomes. However, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_618876], and thus more accu rately perform sample size calculations in the future for a 
fully-powered trial.

16.1.1 Quality Assurance  for Participating Sites 
 
Each site participating in the accrual of participants to this protocol will be audited by [CONTACT_618916],  data verification and 
source documentation. Audits may be accomplished  in one of two ways: (1) selected 
participant records can be audited on-site at pa rticipating sites or (2) source documents for 
selected participants will be sent to MSKCC for audit. Audits will usua lly be determined by 
[CONTACT_618917], but can a lso be prompted by [CONTACT_618918]. 
 
Audits will be conduc ted at least once  shortly after initiation of participant recruitment at a 
site, annua lly during the study (or more frequently if indicated), and  at the end or closeout of 
the trial. The number of participants audited will be determined by [CONTACT_618919].

 The audit will include a review of source docu mentation to evaluate compliance  for: 
 
• Informed conse nt documents and procedures 
• Adherence  to eligibility criteria 
• Protocol d efined treatment 
• Required base line, on study and follow-up protocol testing 
 
 
• IRB doc uments (submitted amendments, annual  continuing review reports, SAEs) 
• Case Report Form sub missions to MSKCC : timeliness  and accuracy 
 
A wrap-up session will be conduc ted at the participating site and preliminary findings will be 
discussed  with the participating site PI [INVESTIGATOR_618880]. The preliminary results will be 
sent to the MSKCC PI. 
 
Each audit will be summarized and a final report will be sent to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_618881] 30 days of the audit. The report will include a summary of findings, 
participant by  [CONTACT_618920], spec ific recommendations on any performance  and/or 
shortcomings and request for co rrective action, when necess ary. When corrective action is 
required, the participating site must reply within 45 days of receipt of audit report with their 
corrective action plan.

16.2 Data and Safety Monitoring 
 
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center 
were approved by [CONTACT_30589] 2001.  The plans address the 
new policies set forth by [CONTACT_30590] “Policy of the National Cancer 
Institute for Data and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Trials” which can be found at: 
http://www.cance r.gov/clinicaltrials/conduc ting/dsm-guidelines/page1. The DSM Plans at 
MSKCC were established  and are monitored by [CONTACT_166996]. The 
MSKCC Data and Safety Monitoring Plans can be found  on the MSKCC Intranet a t: 
http://inside2/clinresea rch/Documents/MSKCC %20Data%20and%20 Safety%20Monitoring% 
20Plans.pdf 
 
There are several different mechan isms by [CONTACT_30592], safety, 
and quality, including several institutional and  departmental process es. For instance, at the 
institutional level, there is protocol monitoring, compliance  and data verification audits, 
therapeutic response, a nd staff educ ation on clinical resea rch QA. Additionally, there are two 
institutional committees—the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) for Phase  I 
and II clinical trials, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for Phase  III clinical 
trials—that are respons ible for monitoring the activities of our c linical trials program and 
report to the Center’s Research Counc il and  Institutional Review Board. 
 
During the protocol de velopment and  review process, each protocol will be assessed  for its 
level of risk and degree of monitoring required. Every type of protocol (e.g., NIH spo nsored, 
indus try sponspo red, NCI coop erative group, etc…) will be addressed  and the monitoring

Deviations and Violations 
A protocol de viation on this study is defined as a request to treat a  research participant who 
does  not meet all the eligibility criteria, pretreatment evaluation, or who requires alteration in 
their study plan. If a deviation from this protocol is proposed  for a potential or existing 
participant at MSKCC or a participating site, approval from the MSKCC IRB/PB is required 
prior to the action. Participating sites shou ld contact [CONTACT_30596] [INVESTIGATOR_618882]/PB. 
 
A protocol violation is anything that occu rs with a participant, which deviated from the 
protocol without prior approval from the MSKCC IRB/PB. For p rotocol violations that are 
identified after they occur, the participating site should report to MSKCC as soon  as poss ible. 
The MSKCC PI [INVESTIGATOR_30500]/PB. 
 
Participating sites shou ld report deviations and violations to their institution’s IRBs as soon as  
poss ible per that site’s institutional guidelines. Approvals/acknowledgments from the 
participating site IRB for protocol de viations and violations shou ld be submitted to MSKCC as 
received. 
 
Other correspondence  
Participating sites shou ld submit other co rrespon dence  to their institution’s IRB acc ording to 
local guidelines, and submit copi[INVESTIGATOR_618883] .

approval letters referencing protocol version date and amendment n umber, IRB app roved 
protocol, append ices, informed conse nt forms, deviations, violations, and approval of 
continuing reviews) is maintained in the regulatory binder on site and sent to MSKCC . 
 
A regulatory binder for each site will also be maintained at MSKCC ; this binder may be paper 
or electronic. 
 
After study closure, the participating site will maintain all source documents, study related 
docu ments and CRFs for 3 years. 
 
16.4 Noncom pliance

IRB PROTOCOL  
IRB#: 12-264 A(11)  
 This study intends  to obtain more in-depth information about the safety and feasibility of two 
commercially available drugs, eno xaparin and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], in canc er patients with acute ische mic 
stroke. The findings of the proposed  pi[INVESTIGATOR_618885] 
a larger, fully-powered clinical trial that will assess  for efficacy. 
 
The potential risks for participants in this study are easy  brusing, skin irritation, pain at the 
injection site, dyspeps ia, dizziness,  diarrhea, nau sea and vomiting, hea ring loss, tinnitus, 
impaired liver function, thrombocytopen ia, ane mia, major bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, 
and allergic reactions. Participants who experience major ad verse events (e.g., major 
bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, severe allergic reactions) caused  by [CONTACT_618923]. 
 
All resea rch spec ific assessments proposed  for this study are also used  for the assessment 
of non-protocol p atients; the burden caused to patients by [CONTACT_618924]. 
 
This protocol will not include children because  most pediatric cancers are hematologic in 
origin and may not induce as much hypercoagulability as the more common carcinomas of 
adulthood  (Rogers 2012). Furthermore, strokes are extremely rare events in children. 
 
17.1 Privacy 
 
MSKCC’ s Privacy Office may allow the use and disclosure of protected health information 
pursuant to a completed and signed Resea rch Authorization form. The use and disclosure of 
protected health information will be limited to the individuals desc ribed in the Resea rch 
Authorization form. A Resea rch Authorization form must be completed by [CONTACT_9532] [INVESTIGATOR_166975] (IRB/PB). 
 
17.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Repor ting 
 
Any SAE must be  reported to the IRB/PB as soon as possible but no  later than 5 calendar 
days. The IRB/PB requires a Clinical Resea rch Database  (CRDB ) SAE report be submitted 
electronically to the SAE Office at  [EMAIL_203]. 
 
A serious adverse event is any adverse events that: 
 
• Results in death. 
• Is life-threatening. 
• Requires inpatient hosp italization or prolongation of an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• Results in a persistent or s ignificant disability or incapac ity. 
• Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
• Additionally, important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or 
require hosp italization may be cons idered SAEs when, based  on appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or su rgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
 
The CRD B SAE report should contain the following information: 
Fields popu lated from CRDB: 
 
• Subject’s name (generate the report with only initials if it will be sent ou tside of

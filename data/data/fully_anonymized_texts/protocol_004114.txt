CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY  
Amendment 4  
Date: 9 November  2018 
 
RATIONALE AND SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
A summary of major changes covered by [CONTACT_11827] 4 to the 270-302 protocol is 
provided below: 
1. Some visits during Year [ADDRESS_817802] been designated as optional mobile nursing 
or lab  draw -only visits. 
Rationale : The number of full study visits at the site through Week [ADDRESS_817803] visits via a mobile nursing professional (similar to the option already available 
starting in Year 2 of the study) .  For subjects who must still go to the site for all 
assessments, this amendment will decrease the time they will spend on -site. 
As part of this change, several minor adjustments have been made to the Schedule of 
Events: 
• The PBMC assessment at Week 34 has been eliminated . 
• The VWF -Ag assessment at Week 38 has been moved to Week 36. 
• The exploratory biomarker assessment at Week 13 has been moved to Week  12. 
• The urinalysis assessment at Week 38 has been moved to Week 36. 
• At visits where the mobile nursing or lab  draw -only option is used, physical 
examination and vital signs assessments will not be performed.  
• At mobile nursing visits , the service will collect information regarding  adverse 
events , changes to concomitant medications, bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], and FVII use.  For 
lab draw -only visits, this information will be collected by [CONTACT_6624], by [CONTACT_616770].

Proprietary and Confidential 9 November 2018 
2. Development of anti-F VIII inhibitory antibodies (inhibitors) has been added as an 
Event of Special Interest for safety reporting purposes. 
Rationale : While development of FVIII neutralizing antibodies has not yet been observed 
in BMN [ADDRESS_817804] has been removed. 
Rationale : Based on the lack of correlation observed between FVIII activity levels and 
Direct Thrombin Activity test results in Study 270-201, it has been determined that samples 
for this exploratory test will no longer be collected in Study 270-302. 
4. Changes have been made to correct minor errors and for purposes of clarity and 
consistency.  
Refer to Section  25 for a summary of revisions to Amendment 3 (dated [ADDRESS_817805] 2018).

TITLE OF STUDY:  
A Phase 3 Open -Label, Single -Arm Study To Evaluate The Efficacy and Safety of  BMN  270, 
an Adeno- Associated Virus Vector –Mediated Gene Transfer of Human Factor VIII at a dose of 
4E13 vg/kg in Hemophilia A Patients with Residual FVIII Levels ≤ 1 IU/dL Receiving 
Prophylactic FVIII Infusions 
PROTOCOL NUMBER : 
270-302 
STUDY SITES:  
Approximately 40 sites worldwide. 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:  
Phase 3  
STUDY RATIONALE:  
Hemophilia A (HA) is an X- linked recessive bleeding disorder that affects approximately 1 in 
5,000 males.  It is caused by [CONTACT_616771] (FVIII), an 
essential cofactor in the intrinsic coagulation pathway. This disorder can be either inherited, due 
to a genetic aberrancy, or an acquired immunologic process, leading to insufficient quantities of 
FVIII or a dysfunct ional FVIII, but all are characterized by a defective coagulation process.  The 
clinical phenotype of HA patients generally correlates tightly with the level of residual expression. Severe HA is classified as FVIII activity less than 1% of wild -type (<  1 IU/dL), 
moderate disease comprises 1 -5% of wild -type activity and the mild form is 5 -40% activity. The 
clinical manifestations of severe HA are frequent spontaneous bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], predominantly in joints and soft tissues, with a substantially increased risk of death from hemorrhage when the 
brain is involved.  Subjects with moderate disease can exhibit manifestations similar to those seen in patients with severe HA, resulting in a comparable bleeding phenotype.   
Treatment of severe HA presently consists of intravenous injection of plasma-derived or 
recombinant human FVIII protein (rhFVIII) concentrates, both as prophylaxis 2-3 times per 
week, and at the time of a bleed, to prevent or control bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], respectively. The half- life for FVIII ([ADDRESS_817807] approved products) necessitates frequent infusions, 
and although a major advance in the treatment of HA, it remains common for severe HA patients to continue to have multiple bleeding events on prophylactic therapy (median ABR of 1- 4 wit h 
prophylaxis treatment in a recently published retrospective observational study ( Berntorp, 
2017) and between 1-2 in 6 prospective FVIII interventional studies) and on-demand-only 
therapy (median ABR of 4.5 -18 in a recently published retrospective study ( Berntorp, 2017 ) and

between 20 -60 in 6 prospective FVIII interventional studies). The consequence of multiple 
bleeding events is the development of debilitating multiple-joint arthropathy and substantially 
increased risk of death. Chemical modification (eg, direct conjugation of polyethylene glycol 
(PEG) polymers) and bioengineering of FVIII (eg, FVIII -Fc fusion proteins) improve half- life by 
[CONTACT_3450] 50%, and thus, show promise in reduced dosing and maintaining activity levels 
above a 1% trough for a greater proportion of the dosing interval. However, patients with severe 
HA who are treated with extended half-life FVIII remain dependent on multiple infusions to 
maintain critical levels of FVIII activity. There is therefore a strong unmet need for a ful ly 
preventive treatment of HA to give patients a FVIII level compatible with a normal and 
hemorrhage- free life.  
Gene therapy offers the potential of disease-modifying therapy by [CONTACT_504253] a single intravenous infusion of a vector encoding the 
appropriate gene sequence for long -term epi[INVESTIGATOR_504237]. Hemophilia A is well-suited for a 
gene replacement approach because clinical manifestations are attributable to the lack of a single 
gene product (FVIII) that circulates in minute amounts (200 ng/ml) in the plasma. Tightly 
regulated control of gene expression is not essential, and even modest increases in the level of 
FVIII ( any increase of the plasma level by 2 ng/ml induces an increase in activity of 1% ) can 
ameliorate the severe form of hemophilia A.  Thus, relatively small changes in endogenous FVIII activity can result in clinically relevant improvements in disease phenotype. Finally, the circulating FVIII response to gene transduction can be assessed using  validated quantitative 
rather than qualitative endpoints that are easily assayed using established laboratory techniques.  
Several different gene transfer strategies for FVIII replacement have been evaluated, but adeno- associated viral (AAV) vectors show the greatest promise. They have an excellent and 
well-defined safety profile, and can direct long- term transgene expression with tropi[INVESTIGATOR_616739], such as the liver (for serotypes 2, 5 and 8 among others).
  
Indeed, an ongoing gene therapy clinical trial for a related disorder, hemophilia B, has established that stable (median follow -up of 3.2 years) expression of human factor IX (hFIX) at 
levels that are sufficient for conversion of their bleeding phenotype from severe to moderate or 
mild is achievable following a single peripheral vein infusion of AAV8- hFIX vector. Several 
participants in this trial have been able to discontinue factor prophylaxis without suffering spontaneous hemorrhages, even when they undertook activi ties that previously resulted in 
bleeding. Thus, gene therapy treatment has resulted in a substantial improvement in their quality 
of life ( Nathwani, 2014).  
BMN 270 is an AAV5- based gene therapy vector that expresses the SQ form of hFVIII under the 
contro l of a hybrid human liver -specific promoter ( Figure  1).

STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN:  
This is a Phase 3, single-arm, open-label study in hemophilia A patients with residual FVIII 
levels ≤ 1 IU/dL  treated continuously with prophylactic exogenous FVIII for a minimum of one 
year prior to enrollment . Subjects will be enrolled at approximately [ADDRESS_817811] high-quality, well-documented historical data available concerning previous bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_616741] 12 months in order to be eligible to enroll 
in the study. 
Approximately 40 adult subjects with severe HA will receive a 4E13  vg/kg dose of BMN  [ADDRESS_817812] 
12 months of well-documented high- quality historical da ta concerning previous bleeding 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_616742], while approximately 35 subjects will enroll in the study after having completed approximately 6 months’ participation in the BioMarin-sponsored 
non-interventional study 270-902, in which bleeding and FVIII use data prior to gene therapy will be prospectively collected.

In order to minimize bias in the ongoing study and to assure safe and ethical conduct of the 
clinical trial, an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), consisting of experts in 
clinical trials, statistics, and hemophilia, has been convened. The DMC will have sole access 
during the trial to amalgamated FVIII activity levels, FVIII usage, and bleeding data and review 
available safety and efficacy (eg, FVIII activity) dat a during the study on an ongoing basis; they 
may determine, based on emerging data and the risk/benefit profile, that further enrollment at 4E13 vg/kg should be discontinued in favor of a different dose of BMN 270, not to exceed 
6E13 vg/kg.  If the DMC rec ommends a dosing modification, then additional subjects may be 
enrolled, up to a total of approximately 40 subjects, at the new BMN  270 dose level (regardless 
of the number of subjects previously enrolled at 4E13 vg/kg).

efficacy endpoint for the interim analysis involves hFVIII activity, as measured by [CONTACT_616775], achieved post -BMN 270 infusion, as detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP).  
Adjustment for multiplicity of the interim analysis at Week  26 and the final analysis at Week  52 
will be described in the SAP (regardless of the interim analysis results, the study is planned to continue upon the DMC’s recommendation, and the final analysis will be performed at 
Week  52). At the final analysis at Week  52, the secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested 
hierarchically.  
The secondary efficacy endpoints at the interim analysis (Week 26) will be summarized descriptively.   
The tertiary endpoints will be analyzed at the interim (Week 26) and final (Week 52) analyses, 
irrespective of the aforementioned hierarchical testing.  
Details of the interim analysis, including the control of Type I error rate, will be specified in the 
SAP.  
Analysis of safety endpoints will be primarily descriptive. The incidence of AEs will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, relationshi p to study drug, seriousness, and 
severity. Clinical laboratory test values, vital signs, vector shedding and immune response 
parameters will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_765].

7 INTRODUCTION 
Hemophilia A (HA) is a n X-linked recessive bleeding disorder that affects approximately 
1 in 5,000 males (Nathwani, 1992). It is caused by [CONTACT_616776] (FVIII) gene 
that codes for FVIII protein, an essential cofactor in the coagulation pathway. Clinical manifest ations of severe FVIII deficiency are frequent unprovoked bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_616751]. Treatment in Western countries (Berntorp, 2012)  consists of intravenous 
injection of plasma -derived or recombinant FVIII protein concentrates at the time of a 
bleed to control it or prophylactically to prevent bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. The short half- life for 
FVIII (~8 -12 hours) necessitates frequent infusions and makes this treatment prohibitively 
expensive for the majority of the world’s hemophilia A patients. These individuals develop debilitating arthropathy and have a substantially increased risk of death from hemorrhage in life (Stonebraker, 2010) . Chemical modification or bio engineering of FVIII may 
improve half- life to 18 -19 hours (Kaufman, 2013). However, these extended half- life FVIII 
variants do not eliminate the need for lifelong FVIII protein administration (Hay, 2012) .  
Gene therapy offers the potential of disease-modifying therapy by [CONTACT_616777] (hFVIII) following a single administration of vector. Hemophilia A is well-suited for this approach because its clinical manifestations are attributable to the lack of a single gene product (F VIII) that circulates in low amounts 
(100-200 ng/ml) in the plasma. Tightly regulated control of gene expression is not essential, and a modest increase in the level of FVIII (a plasma level of 2  ng/ml protein 
leads to a 1% expression) can ameliorate the severe phenotype (Srivastava, 2013) ; thus, the 
therapeutic goal for gene therapy is a modest increase in hFVIII. Finally, the consequences of gene transfer can be assessed using simple quantitative rather than qualitative endpoints that can be easily assaye d in most clinical laboratories.  
BMN  270 contains the cDNA for the B-domain- deleted SQ FVIII with a liver -specific HLP 
transcription promoter. The expression cassette is inserted between AAV2 ITRs, and this genome is packaged in the AAV5 capsid.  A comprehensive review of BMN  270 is 
contained in the IB  supplied by [CONTACT_189447]. Investigators are to review this document prior 
to initiating this study.  
7.1 Nonclinical Studies  
The nonclinical program supports a single IV infusion of BMN 270, the planned clinical route of administration, for the treatment of hemophilia A in male patients. This nonclinical program took into account the guidelines and reflection papers for gene therapy medicinal

products under EMA Advanced Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_504239]. The primary 
pharmacodynamics (PD), pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicity of IV BMN  270 were 
characterized in a series of single dose studies in species that were vector permissive and responsive to the transgene including normal CD- 1 mice, a B - and T- cell deficient mouse 
model of hemophilia A (B6;129S- F8
tm1Kaz/J x B6.129S6- Rag2tm1Fwa N12; FVIII KO x 
Rag2), and normal cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys. Some PD studies evaluated additional PK, immunogenicity and toxicity endpoints. 
Results of the nonclinical program to date are detailed in the IB supplied by [CONTACT_189447].  
Investigators are to review this document prior to initiating this study.  
7.2 Previous Clinical Studies  
Study BMN 270-201 is an ongoing Phase 1/2, dose- escalation study to assess the safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of BMN 270 in patients with severe hemophilia A (FVIII 
<1 IU/dL).  Subjects received a single BMN [ADDRESS_817861] been enrolled at one of 4 dose levels (6E12, 2E13, 4E13, and 6E13 vg/kg). 
A comprehensive review of safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity results from 270-[ADDRESS_817862] data cut is contained in the IB  supplied by [CONTACT_189447]. Investigators are to 
review this document prior to initiating this study.  
7.3 Study Rationale 
Hemophilia A (HA) is an X -linked recessive bleeding disorder that affects approximately 1 
in 5,000 males.  It is caused by [CONTACT_616771] (FVIII), an essential cofactor in the intrinsic coagulation pathwa y. This disorder can be either 
inherited, due to a genetic aberrancy or an acquired immunologic process, leading to insufficient quantities of FVIII or a dysfunctional FVIII, but all are characterized by a defective coagulation process.  The clinical phenotype of HA patients generally correlates tightly with the level of residual expression. Severe HA is classified as FVIII activity less than 1% of wild type (< 1 IU/dL), moderate disease comprises 1-5% of wild -type activity 
and the mild form is 5 -40% activi ty. The clinical manifestations of severe HA are frequent 
spontaneous bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], predominantly in joints and soft tissues, with a substantially increased risk of death from hemorrhage when the brain is involved.  Subjects with moderate disease can exhibit manifestations similar to those seen in patients with 
severe HA, resulting in a comparable bleeding phenotype.   
Treatment of severe HA presently consists of intravenous injection of plasma derived or 
recombinant human FVIII protein (rhFVIII) concentrates both as prophylaxis 2-3 times per 
 270-302 Amendment 4 Page 30 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 9 November 2018 
week, and at the time of a bleed, to prevent or control bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], respectively. The 
half-life for FVIII ([ADDRESS_817863] approved products) necessitates frequent 
infusions, and although a major advance in the treatment of HA, it remains common for severe HA patients to continue to have multiple bleeding events on prophylactic therapy (median ABR of 1-4 with prophylaxis treatment in a recently published retrospective observational study ( Berntorp, 2017) and between 1 -2 in 6 prospective FVIII interventional 
studies) and on- demand -only therapy (median ABR of 4.5-18 in a recently published 
retrospective study (Berntorp, 2017) and between 20-60 in 6 prospective FVIII interventional studies). The consequence of multiple bleeding events is the development of debilitating multiple -joint arthropathy and substantially increased risk of death. Chemical 
modification ( eg,
 direct conjugation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymers) and 
bioengineering of FVIII ( eg, FVIII-Fc fusion proteins) improve half- life by [CONTACT_3450] 
50%, and thus, show promise in reduced dosing and maintaining activity levels above 1% trough for a greater proportion of the dosing interval. However, these extended half- life 
FVIII variants remai n dependent on multiple infusions to maintain critical levels of FVIII 
activity in severe HA patients. There is therefore a strong unmet need for a fully preventive treatment of HA to give patients a FVIII level compatible with a normal and hemorrhage- free life.  
Gene therapy offers the potential of disease-modifying therapy by [CONTACT_616778] a single intravenous infusion of a vector encoding the appropriate gene sequence for long-term epi[INVESTIGATOR_504237]. Hemophi lia A is well-suited 
for a gene replacement approach because clinical manifestations are attributable to the lack of a single gene product (FVIII) that circulates in minute amounts (200 ng/ml) in the plasma. Tightly regulated control of gene expression is not essential, and even modest increases in the level of FVIII (any increase of the plasma level by 2  ng/ml induces an 
increase in activity of 1%) can ameliorate the severe form of the disease.  Thus, relatively small changes in endogenous FVIII activity can result in clinically relevant improvements in disease phenotype. Finally, the circulating FVIII response to gene transduction can be assessed using validated quantitative rather than qualitative endpoints that are easily assayed using established labor atory techniques. 
Several different gene transfer strategies for FVIII replacement have been evaluated, but adeno -associated viral (AAV) vectors show the greatest promise. They have an excellent 
and well -defined safety profile, and can direct long term transgene expression with tropi[INVESTIGATOR_616752] (for serotypes 2, 5 and 8 among others).

The current study is a Phase 3, single-arm, open- label study designed to assess whether, in 
an expanded sample, BMN 270 at a dose of 4E13 vg/kg can safely alter the clinical 
phenotype of hemophilia A patients with residual FVIII activity ≤ 1 IU/dL.  
7.[ADDRESS_817864] received 4E13 or 
6E13 vg/kg doses of BMN [ADDRESS_817865].  Based on the effectiveness of transient oral corticosteroid used to suppress a presumed cytotoxic T- cell 
response in prior studies with hepatic transduction with AAV vectors ( Mingozzi, 2013), 
subjects were treated with [ADDRESS_817866], which has been attributed to an interaction between one or more of his antiretroviral therapy medications and/or unsuspected underlying hepatic disease with BMN  270. In addition, there has been one 
subject with Gilbert’s syndrome in the ongoing 270-[ADDRESS_817867] led to the exclusion of subsequent HIV-positive subjects and requirement of liver tests at Screening that are <1.25 times the upper limit of the normal range in the ongoing 270-301 and 270-302 clinical studies. Of note, two HIV-positive subjects in 270-301 and one presumed Gilbert’s syndrome subject in 270-[ADDRESS_817868] that transient elevations in liver enzymes are expected following AAV- based gene 
therapy for the treatment for hemophilia B without any long -term concerns of hepatic 
injury (Manno, 2006); (Nathwani 2011); (George, 2016); (Miesbach, 2016 ), (Pasi, 2017).  
At the highest dose tested in 270-201 (6E13 vg/kg), the majority of subjects achieved FVIII levels above 50 IU/dL at [ADDRESS_817869]-infusion. Similarly, subjects who received 4E13 vg/kg have achieved FVIII levels within or approaching the normal range. Subjects in both cohorts also reported markedly decreased bleeding compared with pre- study rates and 
the ability to discontinue prophylactic FVIII infusions. Subjects at all dose levels continue to be followed. 
 270-[ADDRESS_817870], there is a potential risk of acute, systemic 
hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) with BMN  270. No hypersensitivity 
reactions were observed during dosing of BMN [ADDRESS_817871] in the 4E13 vg/kg cohort. The subject was treated with acetaminophen, and the fever resolved within 48 hours (see Investigator’s Brochure for full details). Infusion- related reactions, 
including allergic reaction, maculopapular rash, and presyncope, have been reported from ongoing, actively dosing clinical studies of BMN 270. All of the infusion- related reactions 
were effectively managed clinically and resolved without any clinical sequelae. Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for additional details.  
The current data available for BMN 270 does not yet permit adequate assessment of the benefit:risk profile of this investigational drug. Given the monitoring measures in place in the clinical protocol(s) to minimize the risk to subjects participating in the existing studies, the identified risks are justified by [CONTACT_616779].  Each subject in 270-[ADDRESS_817872] a comprehensive surveillance plan that monitors LTs during the study, and elevations in LT will be addressed according to the guidelines set forth in the protocol. Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_504259].

9 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a Phase 3, single-arm, open- label study in hemophilia A patients with residual FVIII 
levels ≤ 1 IU/dL  treated continuously with prophylactic exogenous FVIII for a minimum of 
one year prior to enrollment . Subjects will be enrolled at approximately [ADDRESS_817874] high-quality, well- documented historical data available concerning 
previous bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_616741] 12 months in 
order to be eligible to enroll in the study.  
Approximately 40 adult subjects with severe HA will receive a 4E13 vg/kg dose of BMN  [ADDRESS_817875] 12 months of well- documented high-quality historical data concerning 
previous bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_616742], while approximately 35 subjects will enroll in the study after having completed approximately 6  months’ participation in the 
BioMarin -sponsored non-interventional study 270-902, in which bleeding and FVIII use 
prior to gene therapy will be prospectively collected. 
 
In order to minimize bias in the ongoing study and to assure safe and ethical conduct of the clinical trial, an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), consisting of experts in clinical trials, statistics, and hemophilia, has been convened.  The DMC w ill have sole 
access during the trial to amalgamated FVIII activity levels, FVIII usage, and bleeding data and will review available safety and efficacy (eg, FVIII activity) data during the study on an ongoing basis; they may determine, based on emerging data and the risk/benefit profile, that further enrollment at 4E13  vg/kg should be discontinued in favor of a different dose of 
BMN 270, not to exceed 6E13 vg/kg.  If the DMC recommends a dosing modification, then 

 270-302 Amendment 4 Page 36 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 9 November 2018 
additional subjects may be enrolled, up to a total of approximately 40  subjects, at the new 
BMN  270 dose level (regardless of the number of subjects previously enrolled at 
4E13 vg/kg).  
An interim analysis is planned after approximately [ADDRESS_817876] and 
bleeding remains to be established, Investigators should strive to minimize bias by [CONTACT_616780][INVESTIGATOR_504250]. 
In subjects who experience recurrent bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], the Investigator and Medical 
Monitor will discuss whether to resume prior FVIII prophyla xis. 
Subjects who do not respond to BMN 270 treatment  
 
ay, at the Investigator’s discretion and after 
discussion with the Medical Monitor or Sponsor- designated Data Monitor , follow an 
abbreviated visit schedule after Week  [ADDRESS_817877]’s ALT values are elevated, and subsequent dosage adjustments made, after consultation between the Investigator and the Medical Monitor.  Management of ALT elevations is discussed in more detail in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Any safety signal may trigger a review of the data and possible additional immunogenicity studies or other diagnostics deemed necessary that include an assessment of cellular immune responses using collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

g Blood samples will be collected from subjects to evaluate biochemical, molecular, cellular, and genetic/genomic aspects relev ant to hemophilia A, coagulation, and/or AAV gene transfer, 
and to develop assays used for these evaluations.   Subjects may choose to opt out of the exploratory genetic/genomic research being done to study or try to discover genes that are not yet 
known to be associated with hemophilia A. While exploratory samples will be collected at the time points indicated above, tes ting of these  samples (including those for TGA assay, and 
any other exploratory assessments) will be performed only as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1034].  
h Should the screening visit occur within [ADDRESS_817880] s who do not complete dosing within 9 0 days will be required to re -consent and undergo all screening procedures.  Subjects may not undergo smart rescreening more than 
once.  
j Only the hFVIII inhibitor level (Bethesda assay with Nijmegen modification) assay must be done at smart rescreening.  
k With the exception of the collection of samples for PCR vector DNA analysis, assessments on the day of infusion must be performed prior to the infusion. Subjects will fast for at least 
8 hours prior to pre -infusion laboratory sampling on the day of the infusion visit.  On the day of the BMN  270 Infusion, vital signs will be  monitored prior to the infusion, during the 
infusion every 15 minutes (±  5 minutes), and following the infusion hourly (± 5 minutes) for at least [ADDRESS_817881]’s stay in the  clinic. Shedding samples for PCR of vector 
DNA (blood, saliva, urine, semen, stool) should be collected between [ADDRESS_817882] been determined to meet all study eligibility criteria.  
m In case of hypersensitivity or adverse drug reaction, safety assessment, including physical examination and vital signs, will  be done and additional blood samples will be collected  
 
 In-patient observation can be extended and additional blood sample s can be collected if deemed necessary at the 
discretion of the Investigator and Medical Monitor.

9.2 Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Control Group 
Study 270-302 is designed to be a Phase 3, single-arm, open- label study in hemophilia A 
patients with residual FVIII levels ≤ 1 IU/dL previously treated with prophylactic exogenous 
FVIII. Hemophilia A patients who provide written informed consent, meet the entry criteria definition of residual FVIII activity, have well-documented historical data for the previous [ADDRESS_817891] antibodies to AAV5 will be eligible to enroll in the study.  
Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled at the 4E13 vg/kg BMN [ADDRESS_817892]-infusion, safety and 
efficacy will then continue to be assessed long -term for approximately a total of 5  years.  
During enrollment, the DMC will review available safety and efficacy data on an ongoing basis and may decide to recommend dosing subjects at a different dose level (not to exceed 6E13 vg/kg) based on emerging data from 270-302 and their overall benefit:risk assessment. 
Study 270-[ADDRESS_817893] will be compared to a 
pre-treatment assessment of safety (liver function) and efficacy (number of bleeds, use of 
FVIII replacement therapy).  
9.3 Selection of Study Population 
Approximately 40 adult hemophil ia A patients with residual FVIII levels < 1 IU/dL may 
enroll into the study.  
Additional criteria for participation in the study are provided in Section  9.3.[ADDRESS_817894] meet a ll of the following inclusion 
criteria:  
1. Males ≥ 18 years of age with hemophilia A and residual FVIII levels ≤ 1 IU/dL as

individuals under ordinary conditions. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_427671]) should be monitored at 15 minute (±5 minutes) intervals throughout the time period of the infusion.  
As with any infused biological product, there is a potential risk of acute, systemic 
hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) with BMN  270. Dosing will be 
administered at a qualified infusion site, with appropriate resuscitation equipment and medication available and easily accessible.  
Clinical staff administering BMN 270 should be trained appropriately in recognizing and managing the signs and symptoms associated with potential hypersensitivity, anaphylactic, and anaphylactoid reactions. Additionally, the Investigator should be fam iliar with 
Sampson’s criteria for defining anaphylaxis (Sampson, 2006; Appendix 1).   
Should symptoms of potential hypersensitivity occur, the infusion may be slowed or halted at 
the Investigator’s discretion, with consideration of the subject’s clinical condition. If the infusion is halted, it should only be restarted if the Investigator considers it safe and appropriate to do so. Antihistamines, anti- pyretic, and/or corticosteroid administration is 
permitted prior to restarting an interrupted infusion by [CONTACT_288449]- related reaction. At the 
restart, the infusion rate may be adjusted  
 
with careful monitoring of the subject. 
In case of hypersensitivity or adverse drug reaction, safety assessment, including physical examination and vital signs, will be done and additional blood samples will be collected

beyond [ADDRESS_817907] subjects how to recognize signs and symptoms of potential (delayed) hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis, and to contact a medical practitioner or seek emergency care in case of such an event.  
9.4.5 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria (refer to Section  9.3.1 and Section  9.3.2) may be 
enrolled into the study. Approval by [CONTACT_616786]. Upon their enrollment into the study, subjects will be assigned a unique subject number. 
Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled at 4E13 vg/kg.

Subjects on prophylactic FVIII therapy will discontinue their regular treatment regimen 
starting 4 weeks after the day of infusion and switch to an “on-demand” schedule. FVIII replacement  therapy can always be taken as needed by [CONTACT_616787][INVESTIGATOR_1865]; the subject must carefully record his treatment and bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_616759]. Prophylactic FVIII use can be used on a case- by-case basis and in consultation with 
the Medical Monitor to prevent bleeding in extenuating circumstances (eg, peri-operative).   
In addition, information on FVIII usage and bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_616760]-documented and available and will be collected from subject s for the [ADDRESS_817912]’s well- documented medical and FVIII usage history are 
provided in the On Site File Binder. 
In order to enab le rigorous comparisons of pre-study versus on- study FVIII usage and 
bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], the Medical Monitor will review each screened patient’s prior bleed and 
hemophilia medication logs to determine if they are of "high -quality".  Elements that will be 
assessed to judge the quality of such historical data may include, but are not limited to, the 
following: 
• Date, type (eg, joint, muscle, other), location of bleeds 
• Date, name, dose (calculated in IU/kg), and reason for use (eg, usual prophylaxis, 
one-time pr ophylaxis, treatment for bleed, surgery) of hemophilia medications. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Therapeutic Glucocorticoid Treatment of Elevated Hepatic Transaminases  
Therapeutic oral corticosteroids (prednisone or converted equivalent) should be initiated 
when either of the following occurs post-BMN [ADDRESS_817913] and after consultation with the Medical Monitor: 
• ALT ≥ 1.5x ULN or ALT > ULN & > 2x baseline value in [ADDRESS_817914] been ruled out, or ALT ≥ 3x ULN in 
2 consecutive assessments within 48 hours (refer to Table [IP_ADDRESS].2) 
o Whenever possible, a confirmatory lab draw for ALT should be performed, along wi th FVIII activity, prior to initiating oral 
corticosteroids.

o Corticosteroids may be delayed if elevations in ALT are clearly not related 
to BMN 270 (eg, elevated in ALT with concurrent increase in CPK due to intensive exercise)  
The prescribed regimen for therapeutic oral corticosteroids is detailed in  Table 9.1.6.  
Changes to the corticosteroid regimen should be made as follows:

FVIII levels; and  
• There is no concern for adrenal insufficiency post -withdrawal  
Increasing 
Corticosteroid 
Dose  If ALT level is increasing or FVIII level is decreasing while on oral corticosteroids, any 
increases in oral corticosteroid dosing should be made only upon consultation with the 
Medical Monitor  
For any scenarios that are not accounted for in the above table, a discussion should take place between the Investigator and 
Medical Monitor regarding corticosteroid dose adjustments.  
 
After discontinuation of oral corticosteroids, labs for ALT and FVIII levels will be measured 
once a week for 4 weeks to ensure stability in values.  
Following initiation or completion of therapeutic oral corticosteroids, if ALT elevation ≥1.5x ULN or ALT 
 ≥  ULN &  ≥  2x baseline value is reported, corticosteroid management 
decisions will be based on discussions between the Investigator and Medical Monitor. Modification of the corticosteroid regimen may take into consideration possible confounders for the ALT elevation and impact on FVIII expression.   
Management and monitoring of reactions to corticosteroids should be determined by [CONTACT_3786]’s clinical judgment in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor. This includes the contraindicated use of NSAIDs during corticosteroid treatment and specific monitoring not already covered by [CONTACT_616788]. The use of COX-2 inhibitors, while not contraindicated during corticosteroid treatment, should be limited, if possible.  Practical management to prevent complications related to oral corticosteroid therapy may be undertaken at the discretion of the Investigator (eg, evaluation of glucose intolerance,

the start of oral corticosteroid treatment and then 1  week and 13 weeks after the completion 
of oral corticosteroid treatment in subj ects with a history of hepatitis B or hepatitis C. All 
adverse events (including any adverse events suspected to be caused by [CONTACT_616789]) should be reported as outlined in Section 10 of the protocol. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring of HIV- Positive Subjects  
HIV-positive subjects who have previously enrolled in 270-302 should continue anti-
retroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed and follow routine monitoring of CD4 count and viral 
load ( US Dept Health Human Services, 2014).  No alterations in the monitoring are indicated 
for enrolled immunocompetent HIV-positive subjects who receive corticosteroids as part of their enrollment in 270-302. 
9.4.9 Treatment Compliance  
Study drug will be administered to subjects at the study site and/or the dosing facility by a 
qualified health care professional.  The quantity dispensed, returned, used, lost, etc. must be

9.7.1 Safety and Efficacy Measurements Assessed  
The Schedule of Events ( Table 9.1.1 through Table 9.1.5) describes the timing of required 
evaluations.
 
9.7.2 Primary Efficacy Variables  
[IP_ADDRESS] FVIII Activity  
The primary efficacy variable is change of the hFVIII activity, as measured by [CONTACT_616775], during Weeks 49-[ADDRESS_817918]’s hFVIII activity during Weeks 49-[ADDRESS_817919] has used FVIII within 72 hours of a measurement day, all efforts should be made

achieved; The 72-hour wash-out period is only intended for subjects who have achieved FVIII ≥ 5 IU/dL at [ADDRESS_817920] not resumed FVIII replacement therapy.  
In the event of an FVIII activity level decline during the study: 
• If FVIII activ ity has declined at least 20% from the peak but less than 35% and has 
declined for at least 2 consecutive assessments, FVIII activity and LTs should be 
repeated every 7 days until FVIII activity is stable or increasing 
 270-302 Amendment 4 Page 66 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 9 November 2018 
• If FVIII activity has declined >35% f rom the peak and has declined for at least 
2 consecutive assessments, FVIII activity and LTs should be repeated every 72 hours 
until FVIII activity is stable or increasing  
Note that fluctuations in FVIII activity are common, and if no clear trend indicating a decline 
in FVIII activity is observed, then this additional testing may be deferred (upon consultation between the Investigator and the Medical Monitor) until either a more clear trend of decline has been demonstrated or until the FVIII activity levels stabilize or increase.  
Subjects who do not respond to BMN 270 treatment

9.7.4 Tertiary Efficacy Variables  
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient -Reported Outcomes (PRO)  
The Haemo -QoL-A questionnaire is a validated hemophilia -specific health -related quality of 
life questionnaire for adults ( Rentz, 2008). It consists of 41 questions covering six domains 
(Physical Functioning, Role Functioning, Worry, Consequences of Bleeding, Emotional 
Impact and Treatment Concerns). Items are answered on a 6 -point Likert -type scale, ranging 
from 0 (None of the time) to 5 (All of the time).  Higher scores mean better health -related 
quality of life or less impairment for a particular subscale ( Haemo -QoL Study Group, 2017).  
Details regarding the Haemo -QoL-A assessment will be included in the On Site File Binder.  
The EQ -5D- 5L instrument is a self -reported questionnaire designed to measure general 
health status (The EuroQol Group, 1990) (Brooks, 1996). The EQ -5D-5L is composed of 
2-parts:  a descriptive system that assesses 5 levels of perceived problems (mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) in 5 dimensions and the 
EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) assessment for overall health.  A sample copy of the EQ-5D-5L and additional information are provided in the On Site File Binder. 
The Haemophilia Activities List (HAL) measures the impact of hemophilia on self -perceived 
functional abilities in adults ( Van Genderen, 2006).  The instrument consists of multiple 
domains including lying/sitting/kneeling/standing, leg and arm function, use of transportation, self-care, household tasks, and leisure activities where subjects are asked to rate their level of difficulty with activities of daily living on a 6 -point Likert -type scale from 
1 (Impossible) to 6 (Never). For some items, subjects are given the choice to answer ‘Not applicable’.  A sample copy of the HAL and additional information are provided in the On Site File Binder.  
The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment plus Classroom Impairment Questions: Hemophilia Specific (WPAI+CIQ:HS) instrument is designed to measure the effect of disease symptom severity on work productivity and classroom productivity (if applicable) (Recht, 2014).  The WPAI+CIQ:HS questionnaire yields scores related to work/classroom 
absenteeism, reduced on -the-job effectiveness, overall work/classroom impairment, and 
activity impairment.  WPAI+CIQ:HS outcomes are expressed as impairment pe rcentages, 
with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity ( Reilly, 2002).  A 
sample copy of the WPAI+CIQ:HS and additional information are provided in the On Site File Binder.

immunogenicity assessment to evaluate FVIII - and capsid -specific cellular immunogenicity. 
FVIII - and capsid -specific cellular immunity will be assessed by [CONTACT_616791].  
9.7.6 Pharmacodynamics 
The FVIII protein concentration and activity level as measured by a validated immunoassay and by a validated FVIII activity assay, respectively, will be used for plasma prof iles; FVIII 
protein and activity will be used to determine PD parameters.  
9.7.7 Exploratory Assessments 
Blood samples will be collected from subjects at the time points indicated in Table 9.1.1, 
Table 9.1.2, Table 9.1.3, Table 9.1.4, and Table 9.1.5 to evaluate biochemical, molecular, 
cellular, and genetic/genomic aspects relevant to hemophilia A, coagulation, and/or AAV gene transfer, and to develop assays used for these evaluations.  Subjects may choose to opt out of the exploratory genetic/genomic research being done to study or try to discover genes that are not yet known to be associated with hemophilia A. 
All biomarker samples collected in this study may be used for exploratory biomarker 
research, including evaluation of additional biomarkers not specifically listed in the protocol.  In addition, samples collected for other purposes in this study may be used for exploratory research once testing for the primary purpose has been completed.

 270-[ADDRESS_817925] -infusion study visits may also be used to 
assess the magnitude of biomarker changes.  
During Years 2 -5, at applicable sites, certain study assessments may be performed by a 
mobile nursing (MN) professional at the patient's home or another suitable location, such as 
their school or office, to improve access and convenience for patients participating in the study. The Sponsor may select a healthcare company that will be responsible for providing MN services for participating sites (the MN vendor). The MN vendor is responsible for ensuring that all MN professionals are licensed, qualified, and in good standing, as per applicable regulations, and that appropriate background checks have been performed. If the investigator at a participating site determines that MN services  are appropriate for a patient 
and the patient gives written informed consent to participate in MN visits, the MN network will communicate with the patient and the patient’s site. MN visits will be allowed for the Q4W (during Year 2) and Q6W (during Years 3-5) visits; the Q12W visits and End of Year visits during Years 2-5 will not be performed by [CONTACT_616792].  
MN visits may also be available during Year 1 at Weeks 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 30, 31, 33, 35, 38, 42, 46, and 50 (as indicated in the Schedule of Events).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Liver and Hepatitis Testing  
Subjects will be screened for evidence of previous or active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection at Screening; hepatitis B screening should include HBsAg , HBsAb, and HBcAb.   
Subjects with documented results showing an absence of active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection (as measured by [CONTACT_616793] B or positive RNA testing for hepatitis C) [ADDRESS_817926] ory of hepatitis B or hepatitis C who receive therapeutic oral 
corticosteroids prior to Week 16 do not need to complete the Week 16 reactivation assessment; instead, they will be tested for hepatitis B and hepatitis C reactivation at the time points listed  in Table 9.1.6.

[IP_ADDRESS] HIV Testing  
HIV testing will be performed at Screening.  Subjects with documented negative results 
within the last 30 days prior to screening do not need to be retested. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs, Physical Examinations and Other Observations Related to Safety 
Vital signs will include seated systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_11943], and temperature. Any clinically significant change in vital signs will be recorded as an 
AE. 
Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and temperature will be assessed at Screening, Baseline, and at the beginning of each visit during the Post- Infusion Follow -Up and Long- Term Follow -Up periods.  On the day of the BMN 270 
Infusion, vital signs will be monitored prior to infusion, during the infusion every 15 minutes (± 5 minutes), following the infusion hourly (± 5 minutes) for at least [ADDRESS_817930]’s stay in the clinic.  Any abnormal vital sign assessments should be repeated, and both values should be recorded in the eC RF. 
A complete physical examination is necessary during Screening/Baseline, at Week  26 and 
52 and every 52 weeks thereafter; at other visits, brief physical examinations may be performed at the discretion of the Investigator based on the subject’s clinical condition. Particular attention should be given to signs of bleeding, as well as assessing possible hemarthroses.  During Year 1, at visits where the MN services are used or shortened lab  
draw -only visits are conducted at the sites, the physical examinati on and vital signs 
assessments indicated in the Schedule of Events will not be performed. 
 270-302 Amendment 4 Page 75 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 9 November 2018 
A complete physical examination  will include general appearance (head, eyes, ears, nose, and 
throat), cardiovascular, dermatologic, lymphatic, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, genitourinary, 
musculoskeletal, and neurologic systems. 
A brief physical examination will include general appearance, cardiovascular, dermatologic, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and neurologic assessments. 
Height will be recorded at Screening only.  Weight will be recorded at Screening and then 
every 4 weeks thereafter through Week 52, and at the second Q12W visit each year and at every End of Year visit during Years 2-5. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Vector Shedding  
During the Post-Infusion Follow-Up period, subjects will undergo testing of various bodily 
samples to look for evidence of vector shedding for possible viral transmission.  Bodily fluids will be tested by [CONTACT_940] (PCR).  Fluids tested will include: 
• Blood 
• Saliva  
• Semen  
• Urine  
• Stool 
Vector shedding will also be extensively studied in the present clinical trial, at the time points 
indicated in Table 9.1.2, Table 9.1.3, Table 9.1.4, and Table 9.1.5. Testing will continue until 
at least [ADDRESS_817931] PCR testing in semen every 4 weeks 
(during Year  2) and every 6 weeks (during Years 3-5) until 3 consecutive negative sa mples 
are documented (or upon consultation between the Investigator and Medical Monitor). Subjects who meet the definition of treatment failure and wish to follow an abbreviated schedule (refer to Section  12.7) but who have not cleared vector shedding from all fluids 
must still provide samples for assessment every 4 weeks (during Year 2) or every 6 weeks (during Years 3 -5) until vector shedding has cleared. Such subjects may provide samples on 
the designated study visit dates either at the sites or through use of a MN professional. 
Samples may be fractionated prior to shedding analysis in order to better characterize the 
presence, structure, and location of vector DNA and/or vector capsid within each matrix.  If needed, the fractionation may be performed with samples collected specifically for shedding 
 270-302 Amendment 4 Page 76 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 9 November 2018 
analysis (saliva, blood, semen, urine, feces).  Alternatively, the vector DNA characterization 
during shedding analysis may utilize already fractionated exploratory samples obtained from the above biofluids, such as exploratory plasma samples, exploratory PBMC samples, and red blood cells recovered during PBMC/plasma isolations.  
Fractionation of semen to collect purified sperm separately from non- sperm cells may be 
performed in parallel at any visit where semen samples are collected.  The shedding analysis 
of a fractionated semen sample will only be performed if vector DNA was detected in the whole semen sample for the same visit.  Fractionation of semen during shedding analysis 
may be stopped if purified sperm tested positive for vector DNA on at least three visits, or if purified sperm tested negative for vector DNA on at least three consecutive visits.
 
Contraception use may need to be extended beyond [ADDRESS_817932] had 3 consecutive negative semen samples (upon consultation between the Investigator and Medical Monitor). 
Details for sample collection and storage are provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
 270-[ADDRESS_817933] of monitoring and recording protocol-defined AEs and SAEs; 
measurement of protocol- specified hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis variables; 
measurement of protocol-specified vital signs; and other protocol-defined events of special interest that are deemed critical to the safety ev aluation of the study drug. 
10.1.1 Adverse Events  
For this protocol, an adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the 
use of study intervention.  
Events meeting the AE definition include: 
• Exacerbation o f a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. 
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction. 
Events not meeting the AE definition include: 
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_99479]’s condition. 
• The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless mor e severe than expected for the subject’s 
condition. 
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. 
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). 
• Anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 
 270-302 Amendment 4 Page 78 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 9 November 2018 
[IP_ADDRESS] Bleeding and Suspected Bleeding Events  
All bleeding events and suspected bleeding events, regardless of the need for exogenous 
FVIII therapy as treatment, should be captured in subject diaries and recorded on the designated bleeding eCRF.  Bleeding events and suspected bleeding events should not be reported as adverse events, with the following exception: 
• All bleeding events and suspected bleeding events which meet one or more of the 
criteria for being serious (refer to Section  10.2) should be re ported as serious adverse 
events (whether or not they are bleeding events that are normal sequelae of 
hemophilia, and whether or not they required exogenous FVIII as treatment). 
10.2 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
• Note: Life -threatening refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at 
the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_91259]: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. If the investigational product preparation, infusion, and post-infusion observation period require transfer to an inpatient setting for completion, in the absence of an AE, this will not be considered an SAE (refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the event is serious.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen 
from baseline is not considered an AE.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect in the child or fetus of a subject exposed to IP 
prior to conception or during pregnancy 
 270-302 Amendment 4 Page 79 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 9 November 2018 
• Is an important medical event or reaction – that, based on medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject or require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed above  (eg, anaphylaxis)  
10.2.[ADDRESS_817934] (EOSI)  
The following EOSI need to be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of site awareness, 
irrespective of seriousness, severity or causality:  
• Elevation of ALT  ≥ 1.5x ULN or ALT > ULN & >2x baseline value, regardless of 
whether that elevation triggers an initiation or modification of oral corticosteroid 
treatment  
• Thromboembolic event 
• Systemic hypersensitivity, anaphylactic, or anaphylactoid reactions (refer to 
Appendix 1) 
• Development of anti-FVIII inhibitory antibodies (inhibitors) 
10.3 Methods and Timing for Capturing and Assessing Safety Parameters  
10.3.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study AE reporting period is as follows:   
• After informed consent but prior to initiation of study drug, only SAEs associated 
with any protocol- imposed interventions will be collected; AEs occurring during this 
time period should be recorded on the Medical History eCRF.   
• After informed consent is obtained and following infusion of study drug, the reporting period for all non-serious AEs and SAEs begins and continues for 
approximately 5  years or until study discontinuation/termination, whichever is longer.  
The criteria for  determining, and the reporting of SAEs is provided in Section 10.2.  
10.3.2 Eliciting Adverse Events  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or S AEs. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about AE 
occurrences.  The Investigator will record all relevant AE/SAE/EOSI information in the subject’s medical record and AE Case Report Form (eCRF).  
10.3.[ADDRESS_817935] or medically qualified designee will assess AEs for severity, relationship to study drug, and seriousness (refer to Section 10.2 for SAE definitions).  These assessments must be made by a study clinician with the training and 
 270-302 Amendment 4 Page 80 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 9 November 2018 
authority to make a diagnosis (eg, MD/DO, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, or 
DDS).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Seriousness  
The Investigator will assess if an AE should be classified as “serious” based on the seriousness criteria enumerated in Section  10.2.  Seriousness serves as a guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity  
Severity (as in mild, moderate, or severe headache) is not equivalent to seriousness, which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. The Investigator will determine the severity of each AE, SAE and EOSI using the NCI CTCAE v4.03. Adverse events that do not have a corresponding CTCAE term will be assessed according to the general guidelines for grading used in the CTCAE v4.03 as stated in Table [IP_ADDRESS].1. 
Table [IP_ADDRESS].1:  Adverse Event Grading (Severity) Scale  
Grade  Description  
1 Mild: asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not 
indicated  
2 Moderate: minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate 
instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)a 
3 Severe  or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening : hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]; disabling; limiting self -care ADLb 
4 Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  Grade 4 and 5 AEs 
should always be 
reported as SAEs  5 Death related to AE  
a Instrumental ADL refer to the following examples: preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, 
managing money.  
b Self-care ADL refer to the following examples: bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding oneself, using the toilet , taking 
medications, not bedridden.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Causality 
The Investigator will determine the relationship of an AE to the study drug and will record it 
on the source documents and AE eCRF.  To ensure consistency of causality assessments, Investigators should apply the guidance in Table [IP_ADDRESS].1. 
 270-302 Amendment 4 Page 81 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 9 November 2018 
Table [IP_ADDRESS].1:  Causality Attribution Guidance  
Rela tionship  Description  
Not Related  • Exposure to the IP has not occurred  
OR 
• The administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are not reasonably 
related in time  
OR 
• The AE is considered likely to be related to an etiology other than the use of the IP;  that is, there are no facts, evidence, or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship to the IP.  
Related  • The administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are reasonably 
related in time  
AND  
• The AE could possibly be explained by [CONTACT_616794] 
 • The administration of IP and the occurrence of the AE are reasonably related 
in time  
AND  
• The AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_189579].  
 
Factors suggestive of a causal relationship could include (but are not limited to): 
• Plausible temporal relationship  
• Absence of alternative explanations  
• Rarity of event in a given patient or disease state  
• Absence of event prior to study drug exposure 
• Consistency with study product pharma cology  
• Known relationship to underlying mechanism of study drug action 
• Similarity to adverse reactions seen with related drug products  
• Abatement of AE with discontinuation of study drug, and/or recurrence of AE with 
reintroduction of study drug 
The Investigator’s assessment of causality for individual AE reports is part of the study 
documentation process.  Regardless of the Investigator’s assessment of causality for 
 270-[ADDRESS_817936] only one diagnosis, sign, or symptom per event field on the AE eCRF (eg, nausea and 
vomiting should not be recorded in the same entry , but as 2 separate entries).  
In order to classify AEs and diseases, preferred terms will be assigned by [CONTACT_616795], using MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) terminology.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms  
The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. Using accepted medical terminology, 
enter the diagnosis (if known).  If not known, enter sign(s) and/or symptom(s).  If a diagnosis subsequently becomes available, then this diagnosis should be entered on the AE (or SAE, as appropriate) eCRF, replacing the origi nal entries where appropriate.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events  
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (eg, cascade events) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252].  For example, if severe diarrhea is known to have resulted in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the AE eCRF.  However, medically important events that may be linked and/or separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the AE eCRF.  For example, if severe hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be recorded separately on the AE eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  
A persistent AE (duration of adverse event > 7 days) is one that extends continuously, 
without resolution, between subject evaluation time points.  Events that change in severity necessitate the recording of an additional AE.  AEs that do not have a change in severity should be recorded only once on the eCRF. 
 270-[ADDRESS_817937]’s ALT increases again, that should be re ported as two adverse events – the 
initial ALT increase, and the second ALT increase.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values 
Laboratory test results will be recorded on the laboratory results pages of the eCRF, or appear on electronically produced laboratory reports submitted directly from the central laboratory, if applicable. 
Any laboratory result abnormality fulfilling the criteria for a SAE or EOSI should be reported 
as such, and recorded in the AE eCRF. 
Any laboratory result abnormality of CTCAE Grade [ADDRESS_817938] to confirm the abnormality and any one or more of the following conditions i s met:  
• Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]  
• Requiring a change in concomitant therapy (eg, addition of, interruption of, 
discontinuation of, or any other change in a concomitant medication, therapy or 
treatment).  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ  toxicity  
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management (eg, change of dose, 
discontinuation of study drug, more frequent follow-up assessments, further 
diagnostic investigation, etc.) 
This applies to any protocol and non-protocol specifie d safety and efficacy laboratory result 
from tests performed after the first dose of study medication that falls outside the laboratory 
reference range and meets the clinical significance criteria.  
This does not apply to any abnormal laboratory result that  falls outside the laboratory 
reference range but that does not meet the clinical significance criteria (these will be analyzed and reported as laboratory abnormalities), those that are considered AEs of the type explicitly exempted by [CONTACT_760], or those which are a result of an AE that has already been reported.  
 270-[ADDRESS_817939] to clinical outcomes (eg, increased rate of bleeding, worsening of joint disease).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pre-existing Conditions 
A pre -existing condition is one that is present prior to administration of BMN  270.  Such 
conditions should be recorded as medical history on the appropriate eCRF. 
A pre -existing condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE during the study only if the 
frequency, intensity, or character of the condition worsens during the study period.  It is 
important to convey the concept that a pre-existing condition has changed b y including 
applicable language in the verbatim description of the event (eg, more frequent  headaches).  
[IP_ADDRESS] General Physical Examination Findings 
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a pre- existing 
condition (refer to Sect ion [IP_ADDRESS]).  During the study, any new clinically significant 
findings and/or abnormalities discovered on physical examination that meet the definition of an AE (or an SAE) must be recorded and documented as an AE or SAE on the AE eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or Surgery 
Any AE that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_308413] (refer to Section  10.2).  
There are some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_616763] t here 
is no occurrence of an AE.  These scenarios include planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216412]: 
• Perform a protocol -mandated efficacy measurement  
• Undergo a diagnostic or elective surgical procedure for a pre- existing medical 
condition that has not worsened 
• Insert an in -dwelling IV catheter (such as a Port -a-Cath or other brand, if applicable) 
for administration of study drug or FVIII replacement therapy 
• Receive scheduled therapy (study drug or otherwise) for the study indication 
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the AE reporting period (refer to Section 10.3.1), regardless of 
attribution, will be recorded on the AE eCRF and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor as an SAE.  
 270-[ADDRESS_817940] “Unexplained Death” or “Death of Unknown Cause” on the AE eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy  
Although not an AE per se, pregnancy in the partner of a subject taking trial medication 
should be reported expeditiously to the Sponsor to facilitate outcome monitoring by [CONTACT_1034].  Pregnancy in partner should be reported during the period up to [ADDRESS_817941]’s partner (with that partner’s consent) through resolution of the pregnancy (delivery or termination) and to report the resolution on the Pregnancy Follow-up eCRF. In the event of pregnancy in the partner of a study subject, the Investigator should make every reasonable attempt to obtain the woman’s consent for release of protected health information. 
Abortion, whether therapeutic or spontaneous, should always be classified as an SAE (as the 
Sponsor considers these to be medically significant), recorded on the AE eCRF, and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor as an SAE. 
10.5 Reporting Requirements  
10.5.1 Expedited  Reporting Requirements  
All SAEs and EOSI that occur during the course of the AE Reporting Period (refer to 
Section  10.3.1), whether or not considered related to study drug, must be reported by [CONTACT_616796] [ADDRESS_817942] information that fully documents the event before notifying BPV of an SAE.  BioMarin may be required to report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities within 7 calendar days of being notified about the event; therefore, it is important that Investigators submit any information requested by [CONTACT_189463]. IND safety reports will be submitted within 7  calendar days for 
fatal or life -threatening unexpected suspected adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs)  and within 
[ADDRESS_817943] or Independent Ethics Committee Reporting 
Requirements  
Reporting of SAEs to the Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB) will be done in compliance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the IEC/IRB and with applicable regulatory requirements. Adequate documentation must be 
obtained by [CONTACT_616797]/IRB was properly and promptly notified as required. 
10.6 Follow- up of Subjects after Adverse Events  
After the initial AE/SAE/EOSI report, the Inves tigator is required to proactively follow each 
subject at subsequent visits/contacts. A ll AEs/SAEs/EOSI will be followed until resolution, 
stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up. Resolution 
of AEs/SAEs/EOSI (with dates) should be documented on the AE eCRF and submitted to 
BioMarin Pharmacovigilance and in the subject’s medical record to facilitate source data 
verification.  
For some SAEs and EOSI, the Sponsor may follow up by [CONTACT_756], fax, electronic mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], consultant report, or autopsy report) deemed necessary to appropriately evaluate the SAE or EOSI report.  
10.[ADDRESS_817944] to report, to the 
Investigator and/or to BPV directly, any subsequent SAEs that the subject’s personal physician(s) believes might be related to prior study drug.  
The Investigator should notify the study Sponsor of any death or SAE occurring at any time after a subject has discontinued or terminated study participation, if the Investigator believes that the death or SAE may have been related to prior study drug. The Sponsor should also be notified if the Investigato r should become aware of the development of cancer or of a 
 270-[ADDRESS_817945] the safety of subjects, and that the appropriate regulatory bodies should be notified according to their respective regulations. According to the European Union (EU) Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC, “…in the light of the circumstances, notably the occurrence of any new event relating to the conduct of the trial or the development of the investigational medicinal product w here that new event is likely to affect the safety of the 
patients, the Sponsor and the Investigator shall take appropriate urgent safety measures to protect the patients against any immediate hazard. The Sponsor shall forthwith inform the competent authorities of those new events and the measures taken and shall ensure that the IRB/IEC/REB is notified at the same time.”  
The reporting period for these events which may require the implementation of urgent safety measures is the period from the time of signing of the ICF through the completion of the last study visit or at the Early Termination Visit (ETV). Investigators are required to report any events which may require the implementation of urgent safety measures to BioMarin within 24 hours. 
Examples of si tuations that may require urgent safety measures include discovery of the 
following: 
• Lack of study scientific value, or detrimental study conduct or management 
• Discovery that the quality or safety of the IP does not meet established safety 
requirements

diseases, based on the original terms entered on the eCRF.  
All AEs will be coded using the current version of MedDRA. The incidence of AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_386001] n class, preferred term, relationship to study drug, and severity. A 
by-subject listing will be provided for those subjects who experience a serious AE (SAE), 
including death, or experience an AE associated with early withdrawal from the study or study dru g.  
Clinical laboratory data will be summarized by [CONTACT_11876]. For each clinical laboratory test, descriptive statistics will be provided on Baseline as well as all subsequent visits. Descriptive statistics for physical examination results  and vital signs will also be

14.8 Analysis Populations 
The intention- to-treat (ITT) population is defined as all subjects who receive BMN 270 
infusion, and the modified intention- to-treat (mITT) population is defined as subjects who 
receive BMN [ADDRESS_817978]’s safety is compromis ed without immediate action. In 
these circumstances, immediate approval of the chairman of the IRB/IEC/REB must be sought, and the Investigator should inform BioMarin and the full IRB/IEC/REB within 2 working days after the emergency occurs.  
With the exception of minor administrative or typographical changes, the IRB/IEC/REB must review and approve all protocol amendments. Protocol amendments that have an impact on subject risk or the study objectives, or require revision of the ICF, must receive approval from the IRB/IEC/REB prior to their implementation.  
When a protocol amendment substantially alters the study design or the potential risks or burden to subjects, the ICF will be amended and approved by [CONTACT_189628]/IEC/REB, and all active subjects must again provide informed consent.

15 DATA MONITORING COMM ITTEE 
An independent DMC will be convened for this study. The duties of the DMC will include: 
• Conducting an ongoing review of individual subject safety and efficacy data during 
the study. 
• Recommending whether to enroll subjects at a different dose level (not to exceed 
6E13 vg/kg) based on emerging data from 270-302 and the overall risk/benefit analysis of BMN  270. 
• Reviewing ongoing safety and efficacy data for comparability of drug manufact uring 
lots within 270-302 and between 270-201 and 270-302. 
• Making other recommendations on the conduct and reporting of the trial based on their evaluation of clinical data, including data from 270-301.
 
Details on the composition of the committee, frequenc y of meetings, and other committee 
functions and parameters are included in the DMC Charter and in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan (SAP).  
 270-[ADDRESS_817979] INJURY  
There will be no charge to study subjects to be in this study. BioMarin will pay all costs of 
tests, procedures, and treatments that are part of this study. In addition, after IRB/IEC/REB 
approval, BioMarin may reimburse the reasonable cost of travel for study- related visits in 
accordance with BioMarin’s travel and reimbursement policy. BioMarin will not pay for any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], tests, or treatments for medical problems of any sort related solely to the study subject’s disease. Costs associated with such hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], tests, and treatments should be billed and collected in the way that such costs are usually billed and collected outside the study. 
The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_189584] a study subject 
has been injured by [CONTACT_141551]. Any subject who experiences a study -related injury should be instructed by [CONTACT_616800] a pre -specified medical institution if possible, or at the 
closest medical treatment facility if necessary. The subject should be given the name [CONTACT_4007] a person to contact [CONTACT_187696], and assistance with, treatment for study- related injuries. The treating physician should bill the subject’s health insurance 
company or other third party payer for the cost of this medi cal treatment. If the cost of the 
medical treatment is not covered by [CONTACT_187697], then either BioMarin or the institution may pay for reasonable and necessary medical services to treat the injuries  caused by [CONTACT_191684]. In some 
jurisdictions, BioMarin is obligated by [CONTACT_44533] -related injuries without prior 
recourse to third party payer billing and/or regardless of fault. If this is the case, BioMarin will comply with the law.  
 270-[ADDRESS_817980] be completed using a web–based application developed and validated. Study site personnel will be trained on the application and will enter the clinical data from source documentation. Unless explicitly allowed in the eCRF instructions, blank data fields are not acceptable.  
In the event of an entry error, or if new information becomes available, the value will be 
corrected by [CONTACT_187698]. In compliance with ICH GCP Guidelines and 21 CFR  Part 11, the system will 
require the personnel making the correction to enter a reason for changing the value. The documented audit trail will include the reason for the change, the original value, the new value, the time of the correction and the identity of the operator. 
BioMarin’s policy is that study data on the eCRFs must be verifiable to the source data, 
which necessitates access to all original recordings, laboratory reports, and subject records. 
In addition, all source data should be attributable (signed and dated). Th e Investigator must 
therefore agree to allow direct access to all source data. Subjects must also allow access to their medical records, and subjects will be informed of this and will confirm their agreement when giving informed consent. If direct source d ocument verification of study data by [CONTACT_616801], then the Investigator must make available facilities and/or personnel to allow GCP -compliant source verification to occur. 
Examples of such methods include certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_216406], or other GCP- compliant means agreed between the 
Investigator and the Sponsor. 
A site monitor designated by [CONTACT_308589] l source 
documents at the study site and evaluate them for completeness and accuracy before 
designating them as “Source Data Verified” (SDV). If an error is discovered at any time or a clarification is needed, the site monitor, or designee, will create an electronic query on the 
associated field. Site personnel will then answer the query by [CONTACT_187701]. The site monitor will then review the response and determine either to close the query or re–query the site if the  response does not fully address the question. 
This process is repeated until all open queries have been answered and closed.  
Before a subject’s eCRF casebook can be locked, data fields must be source data verified and 
all queries closed. Refer to the Stu dy Monitoring Plan for details on which fields must be

source data verified.  The Investigator will then electronically sign the casebook, specifying 
that the information on the eCRFs is accurate and complete. The Data Manager, or designee, will then set the status of the forms, visits, and the entire casebook to Locked. Upon completion of the CSR, an electronic copy of each site’s casebooks will be copi[INVESTIGATOR_99628] a compact disk (CD) and sent to each site for retention with other study documents. 
 270-[ADDRESS_817981] the monitors. The Investigator and staff are responsible for being present or available for consultation during routinely scheduled site visits conducted by [CONTACT_189478]. 
Members of BioMarin’s GCP Compliance Department or designees may conduct an audit of 
a clinical site at any time before, during, or after co mpletion of the study. The Investigator 
will be informed if an audit is to take place and advised as to the scope of the audit. Representatives of the FDA or other Regulatory Agencies may also conduct an audit of the study. If informed of such an inspection, the Investigator should notify BioMarin immediately. The Investigator will ensure that the auditors have access to the clinical supplies, study site facilities, original source documentation, and all study files.  
 270-[ADDRESS_817982] notify BioMarin of any change in the location, disposition or custody of the study files. The Investigator /institution must take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of essential documents, that is, documents that individually and collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a study and the quality of the data produced, including paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_44460] (eg, subject charts) as well as any original source documents that are electronic as required by [CONTACT_25435].  
All study records must be retained for at least [ADDRESS_817983] approval of a marketing 
application in the US or an ICH region and until (1) there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in the U.S. or an ICH region or (2) at least [ADDRESS_817984] elapsed since 
the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IP. The Investigator /institution should retain subject identifiers for at least [ADDRESS_817985] with retention should Investigator /institution be unable to continue maintenance of subject files for the full 15 years. It is the responsibility of BioMarin to inform the Investigator /institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.

Appendix  1:  Sampson’s Anaphylaxis Criteria 
According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food Alle rgy and 
Anaphylaxis Network (NIAID/FAAN) Second Symposium on the definition and 
management of anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 
3 criteria are fulfilled: 
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, 
mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen  lips-tongue-uvula) 
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING  
a. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] [PEF], hyp oxemia)  
b. Reduced blood pressure (BP) or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely  allergen for 
that patient  (minutes to several h ours):  
a. Involvement of the skin- mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen 
lips-tongue-uvula) 
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia)  
c. Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)  
3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient  (minutes to several 
hours): 
e. Infants and children: low systolic blood pressure (age specific) or greater than 30% decrease is systolic BP  
f. Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mmHg or greater than 30% decrease from that person’s baseline.

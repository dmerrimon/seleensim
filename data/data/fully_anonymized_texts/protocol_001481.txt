 OBJECTIVE: We discuss our study protocol, which involved the use of five targeted training 
domains in the KineAssist ®-MX robotic treadmill device aimed to challenge participants, who 
were at least four months post -stroke, in various walking conditions. The training domains were 
to provide similarities to real life walking challenges they may encounter during community -
ambulation.  
 
Study Center:  All study meetings, participant assessments and training  sessions were conducted 
at the UAB Locomotor Control and Rehabilitation Robotics Laboratory.  
 
 
METHODS/DESIGN: DEVICE  
 
KineAssist ®-MX  
The KineAssist® -MX (KA -MX) is a self-driven treadmill that 
allows users to control the speed and direction (forward or 
backward) of the belt. Pelvic forces are detected by [CONTACT_703348], and an embedde d 
computer sets the velocity of the belt based on the amount and 
direction of the forces applied. It offers a body weight support 
mechanism , which allows individuals to freely practice a variety 
of exercises and skills that simulate real world activities w hile 
also catching the user in the event of an unintended fall or loss 
of balance.

balance and fall risk, Geriatric Depression  Scale (Yesavage, et al., 1982) as a measure of 
emotional state, Activities -Specific Balance Confidence S cale (Powell & Myers, 1995) as a 
measure of participants’ confidence in performing ambulatory tasks without loss of balance, 
Dynamic Gait I ndex (An, et al., 2016) as a measure of participants’ ability to modify balan ce 
demands during walking, Modified Mini -Mental State E xam (Folstein et al., 1975) as a measure

Training Paradigms  
Participants had targeted biweekly trainings based on assessments (differs from PT pre-post 
evaluations) . There were five training domains: hyperspeed, aerobic, strength, locomotor 
challenge , and balance (Table 2). Each b iweekly training focus was selected  based on the scoring 
of all domains assessed during biweekly assessments. Training sessions were three times a week 
and designed to last 30 minutes  excluding time for setup and dismount (heart rate monitor, 
transition in and out of KA -MX device) and calcu lations (heart rate and blood pressure) ; 
however, it could also be longer depending on the number of rest breaks taken by [CONTACT_703349] . Each session consisted of multiple bouts

4 
 (5 minutes each) depend ing on the training domain. Participants were encouraged to aggregate 
bouts with training progression (i.e., minimize rest breaks) . Manual assistance by [CONTACT_703350][INVESTIGATOR_703336].  
 
Participant Body Weight Support Determination: The par ticipant’s body weight support 
(BWS) was attained by [CONTACT_2363] a [ADDRESS_955036] at 0%, 10%, 20%, and 30% BWS in the 
KineAssist -MX device. The lowest BWS that generated the hi ghest comfortable walking speed 
(CWS)(0.08 m/s, FWS) was used for the training to allow for individualization of the training 
session. It was calculated  for each training session.  
 
Heart Rate and Blood Pressure:  Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) was monitored 
throughout the training and during respective challenges/activities. Prior to training, the target 
heart rate was determined according to the Karvonen formula (Karvonen & Vuorimaa, 1988)  and 
adjusted based on whether participants were on beta b lockers. Participants targeted 60 -80% of 
their heart rate reserve during the 30 -minute training sessions. If they exceeded 80% of their 
heart rate reserve, participants were given a seated or standing rest break to allow their HR to fall 
below 60% of their  target before continuing with training. Pre and post session training, BP was 
monitored. If it was too low or too high, participants were allowed to rest for approximately 10 
minutes before their BP was rechecked. If it remained the same, they were dismis sed to go home 
or to visit their primary care physician before returning for another visit. In some cases, 
participants were placed in the KA device and carefully monitored to see if their BP would 
remain the same (still low or still high) or improve. If i t improved with exercise, then they were 
cleared to begin training; otherwise, they were allowed to go home.

Training Domains:  
 
Hyperspeed  Domain  
The goal of the training was to challenge the participants to walk at their fastest successful speed 
(FSS)  without loss of balance . The participant trained at their ideal BWS according to the BWS 
level determination  (see above) . 
 
Determination of  FSS:  The participant ta rgeted  walking at a maximum of their CWS + 0.2m/s. 
The speed of the treadmill belt was gradually increased until reach ing CWS + 0.2m/s. The 
participant  was instructed to maintain that speed for 10 steps at a maximum of 20 seconds. 
Success or loss of balance was recorded, and the participant  was asked whether they we re willing 
to try  a faster speed. If so, they were  instru cted to target the p reviously recorded FSS + 0.2m/s, 
and again to maintain the speed for 10 steps at a maximum of 20 seconds. This co ntinued  until 
five 20 -second attempts  at FSS we re completed with incremental increases based on the 
previously successful F SS or the participant  could no longer  walk a t the targeted speed or 
declined  to go faster. Between FSS attempts , the participant  gradually walked  up to their CWS 
and maintained  that speed for 40 seconds before targeting 10 steps at the FSS. This was  repeat ed 
until the 5 rounds are complet ed whereby [CONTACT_703351] 40 seconds at their CWS . 
The bout lasted  approximately five minutes.  
PROTOCOL: MACHINES ASSISTING RECOVERY FROM STROKE   
 
 
[ADDRESS_955038] for 2 -3 minutes (seated or standing based on preference) and 
their heart  rate was checked  to ensure that i t fell below their 60% target before continuation with 
the next five -minute bout.  The training process was  repeated until three tot al bouts we re 
completed.  The next training session used the FSS from the previous session as the initial target 
of the first bout.  
 
Aerobic Domain  
This domain allowed  the participant to walk for six [ADDRESS_955039] break or their target hear rate 
exceed ed 80% of their heart rate reserve target . BWS support was selected based on the BWS 
level determination. Heart rate was  recorded every minute and the participant was asked to rate 
how hard they per ceived themselves to be  working after eve ry two minutes according to the 
Borg Scale (rating of 6 – 20; Noble et al., 1983; Borg et al., 1987).  This was done to have both a 
physiological and subjective measure of exertion. We were interested to know if both  measures 
were correlated .   
 
After completion of each [ADDRESS_955040]. The process was repeated until a full 30 minutes of training was 
completed. Distance was recorded using  a Stanley wheel placed at the front of the treadmill belt 
to measure the distance of the moving belt during each 5 -minute bout yielding total distance 
traveled by [CONTACT_2299].  
 
Strength Domain   
BWS was selected according to the BWS determination leve l. The participant was instructed to 
walk at their CWS for 30 seconds then for 12 steps (with both legs) with the addition of the 
appropriate amount of  horizontal resistance .  
 
Resistance Determination:  Resistance was applied by [CONTACT_20683] a deadband level of force (i.e. 
amount of force required to initiate belt movement using the self -drive mechanism of the 
KineAssist -MX).   For the first bout of the session, the participant targeted 20% of their CWS 
and an initial deadband of 5N. Additional 5N was added if  the initial +5N was insufficient  to 
reduce speed by 20% . For every 12 -step interval, 5N was added to increase the challenge level. 
The task was considered “too hard” only when there was a 20% drop in walking speed.  
Following the [ADDRESS_955041] 12 steps at 
resistan ce, 2nd 30 seconds at CWS, 2nd 12 steps at resistance up until the 5th interval. Heart rate 
was recording between intervals (i.e., directly after completion of 12 steps at respective 
deadbands).

 Locomotor Challenge  Domain  
Tasks were  demonstrated prior to starting . BWS was selected according to BWS determination 
level.  
 
Long s teppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] : This test was designed to train the participants to take long steps in order to 
simulate common challenges posed in the real world of steppi[INVESTIGATOR_703339] , 
such as puddles of water or potholes . The participant was instructed to walk at their CWS  and 
take the longest step he/she can with the non -paretic leg . After examination of the participant’s 
heel strike position  (point 0), an infrar ed laser was aligned with that position and the participant 
was instructed to step over the laser line while walking. Successful completion of a trial 
constituted 5 consecutive strides (5 steps each leg) taken with heel strike at or past  the laser line. 
Three tries are given to pass each trial. Passing resulted in the increase of laser position by [CONTACT_703352].  
 
Speeding up and slowing down : This task was used to simulate  and help improve the speed up 
and slow down one does throughout ambulation.  Using the spee d up/slow down setting in the 
KA-MX devise, “nominal speed” was set to the participant’s CWS, “hold time” was set to 10 
seconds, “plus/minus” was set to  0.2 m/s and “trials” was set to [ADDRESS_955042] as they could.   
 
Head t urns : This task was designed  to simulate the need to turn  and observe different directions 
during ambulation  without losing balance . The participant began by [CONTACT_703353]. At [ADDRESS_955043] combinations of the sequences such as “look up and down, close your eyes, open 
your eyes and look forward.”  This cycle continued per each minute of training .   
 
Hurdles : This task simulated and trained for steppi[INVESTIGATOR_703340]. The 
participant was instructed to step over a hurdle posi tioned at a [ADDRESS_955044] barely able to clear the hurdle . 
This was practiced for  5 minutes per foot  (i.e., one bout per foot).  
 
Backward perturbation  during forward walking : This task was designed to simulate the 
interruptions (other people or objects) encountered during walking and improve the individual ’s 
reactionary balance contro l. The perturbation push program on the KA device was set to a 
default of 0.[ADDRESS_955045] pe rturbation was introduced approximately every 
10 sec onds. If the perturbation was tolerated well by [CONTACT_2299]  (i.e. no loss of balance) , the 
distance and peak velocity was increased by [CONTACT_479271] 0.[ADDRESS_955046] break.   
PROTOCOL: MACHINES ASSISTING RECOVERY FROM STROKE   
 
 
[ADDRESS_955047] walking : This task simulated the act of walking backwards without the loss of 
balance. The participant was instructed to walk backwards in the KA device for 5 minutes (one 
bout) at a speed that attained their target HR. In an y event that the participant fell with  the KA 
safety catch was engaged, the task was reset on the device and the 5-minute  period continued 
uninterrupted.  
 
Walking with foam shoes : This task simulated walking on uneven surfaces and surfaces of 
varying height, and also intended to improve the pa rticipant’s proprioceptive ability. Foam 
blocks were attached to the participant’s shoe s while seated in the device. We had two heights, 
2” and 4” and  initially began with the thin foam. The participant was instructed to put their 
weight into the shoes to avoid slack and walk at their CWS to attain target HR. If the foam size 
did not pose a struggle for the participant  (i.e., successful maintenance of CWS) , it was changed 
to thicker foam (4 inches)  until reaching the 5 -minute stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_703341].  
 
Narrow steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] : This task was designed to simulate narrow steps one has to take in an 
environment with a narrow walking path (e.g. hallway). The participants were instructed to take 
the narrowest step that they could. A l aser beam was fitted to this narrowest step. The goal was 
to challenge the participant rather than induce a loss of balance . Once the step width distance 
was the determined, the participant was instructed to walk at their CWS within that width for 5 
minute s (one bout) . The trial was repeated for the second bout.    
 
Sideways walking : This task was designed to simulate  sideways walking in the environment 
when one is required to turn to maneuver a path.  The participants were instructed to walk 
sideways towards their affected or weaker limb at their CWS for [ADDRESS_955048] level of each 
activity they could perform, successfully repeating it three times within 5 minutes of training 
nonconsecutively per bout before moving on to the next level of difficulty within the 5 -minute 
timeframe. For all nine challenges, one c hallenge bout trained with one leg leading and the next 
bout trained with the opposing leg leading. The t asks were demonstrated prior to starting.  
 
Step onto Step : This simulated the act of walking up and down stairs in an environment. The 
participant s were instructed to first step up with their right or left leg and the other leg following, 
and then back down leading with leg they stepped up with first. It was repeated as many times as 
needed within the 5 -minute bout timeframe until 3 successful attempts w ere completed. T he 
steps were progressively increased by 1-inch intervals following successful completion of the 
task without a loss of balance  until 5 minutes was up.   
 
PROTOCOL: MACHINES ASSISTING RECOVERY FROM STROKE   
 
 
[ADDRESS_955049] Step Length : To determine the participants’ longest step, they were instructed  to take 
the longest step they could leading with their right or left leg without losing their balance. It was 
repeated two more times. The longest step out of the three was used as the initial training goal. A 
laser beam was aligned with that distance and  participants were instructed to use their right or 
left heel to pass the laser beam  then bring the other leg to meet it ensuring that both heels pass 
the laser beam . Once the task was successfully completed 3x, the step length was increased by [ADDRESS_955050] step length until 5 minutes were up.  
 
Slippery Surface: Participants were instructed to step onto a slippery surface plate leading with 
their right or left foo t then followed by [CONTACT_703354]/slippi[INVESTIGATOR_58448]. They were to attempt to hold the step for three 
seconds before steppi[INVESTIGATOR_703342]/left fo ot. Starting off , 
the slippery surface was set to an angle of 0 . The level of slipperiness was increased by 1  until 
the task was successfully completed three times. Participants were trained at the level of 
slipperiness at which they could not hold on for three seconds three times.  
 
Steppi[INVESTIGATOR_703338] : Similar to steppi[INVESTIGATOR_703343], participants stepped onto the foam leading 
with their right/left leg followed by [CONTACT_703355]. The foam was progressively increased by [CONTACT_703356].  
 
Forward P erturbation : Partic ipants stood comfortably in the KA device with their eyes facing 
forward  and walked at CWS.  Forward perturbation was introduced (default of 0.48 peak velocity 
and 0.40 distance) by [CONTACT_703357] a step. If a step was needed, it was done with the designated 
foot used for the bout training (right or left). After taking the step, they returned their  foot back 
to the staring position. The perturbation was gradually increased (0.1 increments) after three 
successful attempts to push the participants harder until they were forced to take one and then 
two steps. The goal was to train participants at the l evel at which they needed to take two steps to 
recover their balance until they were able to take only one step.  
 
Backwards Perturbation: Similar  to forward perturbation, participants stood comfortably in the 
device with their eyes forward  and walked at C WS. They were pulled backward at the waist and 
instructed to try to hold their balance without taking a step. Only one step was required if a step 
was needed to catch their balance. It was to be taken with the designated foot used during bout 
training and returned to the starting positon. The level was increased after the defined successful 
attempts. Training was conducted at the level at which they took more than one step until they 
were able to take only one step.   
 
Forward Reach: Participants stood stra ight and tall in the device with eyes facing forward and 
one foot behind the other (feet are foot length apart with front foot ahead of back foot). They 
were instructed to ball their non -paretic hand into a fist and use it to reach forward as far as they 
could without losing their balance. They were to touch a target located in front of them with their 
fist. Upon touching the target, they were to stand up as quickly  as they could without losing their 
balance. The distance of reach was determined,  and the fo rward reach was repeated two more 
PROTOCOL: MACHINES ASSISTING RECOVERY FROM STROKE   
 
 
[ADDRESS_955051] distance reached. It was repeated with both feet in front 
of them.  
 
Sit to Stand:  The goal for this challenge was to have the participant stand up from the lowest seat 
level possible without a loss of balance or the aid of their hands for support. They were to sit 
down on a step with their right/left foot in front of the other and stand without using their hands 
for support or changing their feet positon. Three successful repetitions resulted in lowering the 
seating distance by 1 -inch increments until failure until the participant fails to complete 3 
repetitions. Participants were then tr ained at that level.  
 
Hurdle:  Participants’ step height was first determined. They were instructed to step over the 
hurdle with their right/left leg then bring the other leg over to meet it. Step height was increased 
by [CONTACT_703358]. Training was 
conducted at the highest height reached until three successful clearance attempts were attained 
before increasing the height by 1 -inch for the next level.  
 
Steppi[INVESTIGATOR_703344] a very low level of walking 
ability where by [CONTACT_703359]. They were trained on taking steps 
in the KA device during the  training sessions. After two weeks of training, an assessment will be 
attempted. If they were not able to complete the assessment, then they returned to step training; 
otherwise, they move d forward with the appropriate training domain as dependent on the 
assessment scores. Notice the expected progression of standing levels within the standing 
category as indicated in Fig 1. Because taking steps were often a challenge for participants, they 
may require the assistance of the research assistant to give them a push forward to initiate or 
increase steps taken using the KA force sensor or joystick mode  as well as to help participants 
get into their target HR zone.  
 
Assessments  
Participants were assessed at biweekly intervals during the 10 -week training period by a graduate 
research assistant to deter mine what t raining was to be conducted for a two -week period  (Table . 
The first assessment was conducted on the second visit (after PT initial evaluation) to determine 
what training domain to begin with. There were six assessments in total (initial, end of  week 2, 
end of week 4, end of week 6, end of week 8 , and final – end of week 10).  The following 
assessments after the first, evaluated participants beginning with the highest level achieved in the 
previous assessment for each domain.

1. Participants were to take 
long steps towards a 
laser beam target (heel 
strike past laser beam) at 
their CWS; Progressive 
increase in distance by 1 
inch 
 
2. Participants were to 
walk at their CWS 
within a laser beam 
target of certain widths, 
which progressively 
narrowed if successful at 
the previous width target  
 
3. Participants walked at 
CWS. With introduction 
of perturbation, they 
were to catch thems elves 
without a loss of 
balance. If successful, 
perturbation was 
successfully increased 
until failure; Initial 
assessment setting of 
perturbation was 0.48 
m/s initial speed and 0.4 
m as distance

Scoring the Assessments  
PROTOCOL: MACHINES ASSISTING RECOVERY FROM STROKE   
 
 
14 
 Scoring for each domain of the assessment categorized performance as levels 0 to 3 (0 – basic, 1 
– deve lopi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 2 – competent, and 3 – expert). The participant’s lowest scored domain was their 
targeted training for the following two weeks. Within domain where multiple activities were 
assessed, the scores of were averaged to obtain an overall score. In the ev ent of a tie  of scores 
between domains , the domain not previously trained was targeted. It was also possible for 
participants to remain training at the same domain after each round of asses sment based on 
scoring. Figure [ADDRESS_955053] reach, BW - body weight, PUSH – forward perturbation, PULL -

Statistical Analysis Plan : 
Statistical analysis will be performed using Repeated  measures ANOVA (subject x pre/post). 
Primary outcome measures will be pre vs post changes in BBS (primary balance measure), in the 
10m walk test speed, and [ADDRESS_955054] Sc ale (SIS) – Mobility Score, and the ABC.   A significance level of 
p<0.05 will be used to determine statistical significance.

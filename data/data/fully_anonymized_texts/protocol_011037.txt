Statistical 
Considerations : Study Population : The intent to treat (ITT) population in this study consists of all 
patients who are enrolled and treated.  
Trial Success, Safety : The primary safety analysis is Major Adverse Events 
(MAE) , as previously defined. This analysis is limited to patients enrolled in the 
Trial Phase (i.e., roll-in patients are not included and will be reported as a separate 
feasibility group). The primary endpoint is to show that the % of patients with an 
MAE is statistically superior to that in the Endologix open surgical historical 
control group at [ADDRESS_1184306], using significance level α=0.025. Multivariable analyses will be 
used to assess predictors of trial success.  
Trial Success, Effectiveness : The primary effectiveness analysis is Treatment 
Success , as previously defined. This analysis is limited to patients enrolled in the 
Trial Phase (i.e., roll-in patients are not included and will be reported as a separate 
feasibility group). The primary endpoint is to show that the % of patients with 
Treatment Success is statistically superior to the target rate of 80% at one year. 
The hypothesis test will be evaluated using the exact binomial distribution as a 
one-tailed test, using significance level α=0.05. Multivariable analyses will be 
used to assess predictors of trial success.  
Additional Evaluations : Appropriate statistical methodology will be used to 
analyze all additional evaluations.

4.1. OBJECTIVE  
The objective of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Endologix Fenestrated 
Stent Graft System for the endovascular repair of juxtarenal or pararenal (JAA/PAA) aortic 
aneurysms in suitable patients.  
 
4.2. BACKGROUND  
An extensive summary of current scientific literature regarding surgical and endovascular techniques 
and devices used in the repair of JAA or PAA is provided in the Clinical Investigator’s Brochure 
(CIB). A brief summary is provided below: 
An arterial aneurysm is a permanent, localized dilatation of an artery with an increase in diameter of 
50% or more than the normal artery diameter. Although any artery may develop an aneurysm, most 
commonly an aneurysm is seen in the abdominal aorta, thoracic aorta, popliteal artery or common 
iliac artery. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a progressive disease characterized by [CONTACT_622049], gradual expansion, and eventual rupture of the abdominal aorta if left untreated. AAA 
is the most common type of aortic aneurysm, with more than 90% occurring inferior to the renal 
arteries. This vascular disorder causes significant mortality and morbidity in the aged population and 
is a leading cause of death.2  
The complexity of AAA is commonly characterized based on location and involvement with visceral 
vessels. Infrarenal AAA generally involves the infrarenal aorta and may involve the aortoiliac 
vasculature. A subset of infrarenal AAA extends up to the level of but does not involve the renal 
arteries, and is termed juxtarenal AAA (JAA). A small proportion of AAA involves the renal arteries 
and as such is termed pararenal AAA (PAA).  Extension of the disease to and beyond the superior 
mesenteric artery (SMA) or celiac artery (CA) into the thoracic aorta describes thoracoabdominal 
aneurysms. These more complex aneurysms are beyond the scope of this study. 
It is estimated that approximately 25% to 40% of infrarenal AAA are not suitable for endovascular 
repair due to unfavorable proximal neck anatomy (e.g., highly angulated, dilated, short [JAA], or 
encroaching on or involving the renal arteries [JAA or PAA]).3,[ADDRESS_1184307] US studies of endovascular 
AAA repair, including that for the Endologix Powerlink System, the infrarenal non-aneurysmal neck 
length and angulation to the aneurysm sac requirements are ≥15mm and ≤60°, respectively; shorter

aneurysm repair. J Vasc Surg 2001;34:1050-4.  
4Arko FA, Filis KA, Seidel SA, et al. How many patients with infrarenal aneurysms are candidates for endovascular repair? J 
Endovasc Ther  2004;11:[ADDRESS_1184309] sought to extend a totally endovascular technique to repair 
of these aneurysms. To consider application of an endovascular method to JAA or PAA repair, it is 
essential to maintain the patency of visceral vessels (i.e., renal arteries; SMA; CA). Browne and 
colleagues reported their feasibility experience in the construction and implant of home made 
fenestrated stent grafts using Dacron graft and stainless steel Z-stents in the canine model.[ADDRESS_1184310] described the use of ‘homemade’ fenestrated stent grafts fashioned 
by [CONTACT_622050]/PAA. 
Although cited as technically feasible in some patients, the broad application of this approach does 
not appear to be generally accepted by [CONTACT_47044].  
A number of single center and several multicenter reports of a custom device based on the Cook 
Zenith stent graft are available in the literature. The key limitation to this approach is the need to 
customize the design and manufacture of each stent graft to a particular patient anatomy. This 
requires a lengthy period of time for planning, manufacture, and delivery of the device. More 
recently, several publications attempt to propose methods for modifying this customization algorithm 
to broaden the applicability of a particular device to more than one patient. That is, to create an ‘off-
the-shelf’ fenestrated stent graft device.  
Endologix, Inc. has developed a Stent Graft System based on the approved AFX design that is 
specifically intended as a potential ‘off-the-shelf’ endovascular repair option for JAA/PAA. This 
design couples the commercially available bifurcated stent graft with a fenestrated/scalloped 
proximal extension and renal stent grafts with the intent to be applicable to approximately 80-90% of 
patients presenting with JAA/PAA.

This is a multicenter, prospective, single arm clinical trial. Patients with JAA/PAA who are suitable 
candidates for endovascular repair using the Endologix Fenestrated Stent Graft System will be 
considered for enrollment. 
After this protocol and the patient informed consent form are reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_851792], potential patients will be offered 
participation in the study. This will be accomplished through the patient’s reading of the informed 
consent form in the patient’s native language and discussion of the study with the patient by [CONTACT_851793]. Agreement to participate and to attend all follow-up visits will be 
documented with the patient’s signature [CONTACT_273314], with appropriate signatures of 
the site investigator and an impartial witness. 
After providing written informed consent, screening and eligibility determinations will be performed. 
Patients will undergo a high resolution, contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography (CT) 
scan of the relevant aortic and aortoiliac vasculature within three months of the scheduled procedure. 
Evaluation of the aortic and vascular anatomy suitability per this protocol, as depi[INVESTIGATOR_851782], will be performed by [CONTACT_851794]. Other tests 
include a physical examination, review of patient medical history for exclusionary conditions, 
selected blood chemistry and hematology analyses, and ankle-brachial index determination. 
Upon acceptance for enrollment, patients will be scheduled for the endovascular repair procedure.  
Note: An investigational site may not enroll more than 20% of the total Trial Phase enrollment. 
Following patient discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the first follow-up visit will be made at one month (±2 
weeks). A CT scan will be performed to assess aneurysm morphology and device integrity and 
patency, as well as the status of the renal arteries and implanted stent grafts. Subsequent follow-up 
will be made at six months, one year, and annually to five years. 
Continued patient follow-up beyond five years is outside of the scope of this study. Nonetheless, all 
patients should be monitored and evaluated per the institutional standards of care for patients who 
receive an endovascular stent graft.

7.1. DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
Bifurcated and Fenestrated Stent Grafts 
Bifurcated stent grafts ( Figure 1 ) are composed of a CoCr alloy wire stent cage† with a thin-walled, 
high density expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft cover that is attached proximally and 
distally to the stent cage with polypropylene suture. Bifurcated devices have body lengths ranging 
from 60 to 100mm. Limb dimensions include lengths ranging from 30mm to 55mm and diameters of 
13 or 16mm to accommodate various patient anatomies. Devices are delivered endoluminally via the 
femoral artery over a .035” guidewire using a disposable catheter system having an introducer sheath. 
T
he pre-loaded stent graft is inserted and upon deployment and withdrawal of the delivery system, 
expands to the indicated diameter. Accessory limb extensions in straight, stepped, flared, and tapered 
configurations are available.  
Figure 1. Bifurcated Stent Graft  Figure 2. F enestrated Stent Graft Design  
  
The investigational fenestrated proximal extension stent graft system consists of two primary 
components: an implantable fenestrated/scalloped stent graft and a disposable delivery catheter 
system. The pre-loaded stent graft is inserted endoluminally via the femoral artery over a .035” 
guidewire and upon deployment and withdrawal of the delivery system, expands to the indicated 
diameter. 
                                                      
†The incoming wire is certified to meet ASTM F1058:2002, Standard Specification for Wrought 40Cobalt-20Chromium-16Iron-
15Nickel-7Molybdenum Alloy Wire and Strip for Surgical Implant Applications (UNS R30003 and UNS R30008).

permission from Endologix, Inc. The fenestrated proximal extension stent graft ( Figure 2 ) is composed of a CoCr alloy wire stent 
cage (having the same elements as the bifurcated device above) with a thin-walled, high density 
continuous ePTFE graft cover that is attached proximally and distally to the stent cage with 
polypropylene suture. The stent grafts have total lengths of [ADDRESS_1184314] a distal segment with 28mm diameter and 4 or 6cm length to ensure significant overlap 
(at least 3cm) with the bifurcated stent graft. The proximal segment has diameters of 24, 28, 32, and 
36mm, indicated for vessel diameters between [ADDRESS_1184315] proximal edge of the stent graft is present to align below the SMA and CA. The 
midsection contains oversized unsupported graft having circular 3-mm diameter fenestrations that 
can expand up to 10mm for cannulation of the renal arteries and introduction of appropriate renal 
stent grafts. Each of the fenestrations and scallop are reinforced using the same polypropylene suture 
used to attach the graft to the stent. For visualization under fluoroscopy, each fenestration includes a 
radiopaque marker encased in the graft around its circumference; the scallop includes radiopaque 
markers encased within the graft at the sides, and a marker at the center of its distal edge.  
T
he mid-section of each stent has two ‘W’ stent segments (anterior and posterior) that serve to attach 
the proximal stent segment to the distal stent segment, while maintaining an open area laterally to 
avoid interference with the renal arteries or fenestrations. The ePTFE graft is continuous throughout 
the extension, with sutures present only at the ends, around the fenestrations, and at the scallop. 
Unique to this device, the graft is produced having a 28mm distal diameter, a 24 to 36mm proximal 
diameter (depending on the device), and a 35 to 47mm (depending on the device) midsection 
diameter. The distal and proximal graft segments conform to the stent diameter, whereas the mid 
section contains the fenestrations for the renal arteries and is loose fitting. This feature permits the 
fenestrations to be moved in situ  to accommodate renal artery locations that are up to 35mm away 
radially from the nominal location. Eight models are designed to accommodate patient anatomies 
where the renal arteries are at approximately the same level, and another [ADDRESS_1184316] is retracted and the constraints removed, the self-
expanding stent graft is allowed to expand within the vessel under the control of the implanting 
physician. The catheter is compatible with a 0.035 inch guidewire. 
The 22Fr OD delivery system has integrated guide sheaths. The guide sheaths are preloaded through 
each of the fenestrations allowing for cannulation of the renal arteries prior to deployment of the 
stent graft. Radiopaque markers are present on the distal ends of the delivery system outer sheath, of 
the left sheath (one marker) and of the right sheath (two markers). The delivery system contains a 
hub and sideport for flushing. The catheter is compatible with a 0.035 inch guidewire. 
Refer to the IFU in Attachment 1for additional information on the delivery system.

8.6. STUDY PROCEDURES AND EVALUATIONS  
8.6.1. Informed Consent 
The patient, or his/her legal representative, is to be informed about the study and provide 
written consent. Confirmation of written consent will be recorded on the SCREENING AND 
BASELINE CRF for verification by [CONTACT_622063].  
8.6.2. CT Scan Protocol 
Patient enrollment into this study is based on the independent physician review and 
assessment of Core Lab produced three-dimensional reconstructions of high resolution, 
contr ast-enhanced spi[INVESTIGATOR_92312]. To ensure consistency, below are the requirements for 
acquisition of the CT Scan: 
 Only high resolution, contrast-enhanced spi[INVESTIGATOR_622032].  
 Data must be uncompressed. 
 Preferred maximum slice spacing is 1mm.  In no case should it exceed 2mm. 
 The preferred protocol, shown below, is easier to attain with a multi-row scanner. If the 
preferred protocol cannot be used, an alternate protocol is provided. 
 Instruct patient not to move during scan. Do not move table height, position, or field of 
view during scan. If such movement occurs, repeat scan in its entirety. 
 Send data to the core lab identified in §2 via CD or per Core Lab instructions. Questions 
can also be forwarded to the Core Lab directly as identified in §2.

Fenestrated Stent Graft System Pi[INVESTIGATOR_851780] . This document and the information contained herein may not be reproduced, used or disclosed without written 
permission from Endologix, Inc. 8.7. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
Throughout the course of the study, all adverse events will be recorded on the applicable Adverse 
Event CRF and in the patient’s medical records. The seriousness, date of onset, date of resolution, 
severity, action taken, relationship to the device, and relationship to the procedure will be identified 
by [CONTACT_737]. 
8.7.1. General Definitions 
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable clinical occurrence in a patient administered a 
product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE 
can therefore be any unintended sign, symptom or disease temporally associated with the use 
of an investigational product, whether or not related to the use of the product. 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that results in death, is life threatening, requires in-
patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_622037], results in persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity, or that is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
An unanticipated adverse event (UAE) is any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any 
life threatening problem or death caused by [CONTACT_1282] a device, if that effect, 
problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, degree of incidence. 
Additionally, an unanticipated adverse event includes any other unanticipated serious problem 
associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. 
Severity of an AE is a clinical determination of the event intensity. The severity assessment 
for a clinical AE should be completed using the following definitions as guidelines: 
Mild (+1): Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated. 
Moderate (+2): Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity. 
Severe (+3): Incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity. 
NOTE: An event that is fatal should be recorded as death on the ADVERSE EVENT  CRF. The 
cause of death will be detailed on the Serious Adverse Events  section of the form. 
Relationship to device or procedure of an AE is a judgment determination made by [CONTACT_622067] a logical connection between device use (e.g., delivery system 
manipulation) and the occurrence of the AE.  
8.7.2. Reporting of Device or Procedure Related Events 
For all patients, Investigators shall submit to Endologix and to the reviewing Ethics 
Committee or IRB a report of any adverse device-related or procedure-related event, 
including, but not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88521] [ADDRESS_1184328] learns of the event. Each of these events will be investigated by [CONTACT_325296]. If 
it is determined that a UAE has occurred and presents an unreasonable risk to subjects, all 
investigations or parts of investigations presenting that risk will be terminated. Termination of

Fenestrated Stent Graft System Pi[INVESTIGATOR_851780] . This document and the information contained herein may not be reproduced, used or disclosed without written 
permission from Endologix, Inc. the investigation will occur within five (5) working days after notice of the effect is received 
at Endologix. The terminated investigation will not be resumed without the approval of the 
ethics committee/IRB.   
8.7.3. Reporting of SAEs 
Any SAE occurring during the study period must be recorded on the appropriate ADVERSE 
EVENT  CRF and Seri ous Adverse Events  section of the CRF.  
For any SAE, fax the A DVERSE EVENT  coversheet and supporting information within [ADDRESS_1184329] 
be followed and outcomes reported. The Investigator should supply to Endologix and the 
responsible ethics committee/IRB with a complete, written case history (AE forms) and any 
additional requested information (e.g., other diagnostic testing, discharge reports, autopsy 
reports, etc.). 
Deaths 
For any patient death, regardless of cause or timing, an autopsy should be requested. If the 
family has agreed to the conduct of an autopsy, a copy of the autopsy report is required.  
A
 device explant kit will be provided to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_622038]. To request a kit, contact [CONTACT_325296] (see 
Section 2.[ADDRESS_1184330] information). 
Every attempt should be made to obtain as much detailed information on the events or 
conditions leading up to the death as possible. If the patient was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], a copy of the 
discharge summary source document is required. 
 
Secondary Interventions  
For patients that experience any non -diagnostic invasive secondary treatment of the groin 
access areas or of the abdominal aortoiliac vessels (e.g., hematoma drainage, vascular 
exploration for bleeding, iliac stenting, thrombectomy, additional device placement for 
endoleak, embolization for Type II endoleak, etc.), it is important to identify the area, region 
or vessel segment that is involved and the specific procedure performed on the relevant 
ADVERSE EVENT CRF. A copy of the discharge summary source document is required.

Investigators shall submit to Endologix and to the reviewing ethics committee/IRB a report of 
any unanticipated adverse device effect occurring during an investigation as soon as possible, 
but in no event later than [ADDRESS_1184331] specific deviations, (e.g. unauthorized use of a 
study device outside the study, unauthorized use of a study device by a physician who is not 
listed in the Clinical Study Agreement, etc.) will be reported in writing. Investigators will also 
adhere to procedures for reporting study deviations to their IRB in accordance with their 
specific IRB’s reporting policies and procedures. 
For reporting purposes, deviations may be classified as major (e.g., failure to obtain written 
informed consent; unauthorized use of study device by a physician who has not completed the 
Endologix training or who is not on the Study Signature [CONTACT_94618]) or minor.(e.g., failure to 
perform a hematocrit blood test; visit outside of window). 
Som
e information collected in this study is not essential to the study endpoints and will not be 
considered deviation if absent.  
8.7.7. Clinical Events Committee Review 
Overview 
The clinical events committee (CEC) identified in §[ADDRESS_1184332] in Endologix. 
Process 
Endologix will provide independently to the CEC the complete case report form event text 
that details all deaths and the events as reported by [CONTACT_50329]. This 
information will be provided without identification of the site name, and will identify patients 
by [CONTACT_622069]. Non-serious events or events that are reported as 
clearly unrelated events will not be assessed by [CONTACT_15741]. The CEC will review events and any 
follow-up data requested from Endologix. This may include copi[INVESTIGATOR_622040], operative notes, discharge summaries, death summaries, and autopsy reports.  
The CEC will document the event categorization for each event individually. Meeting notes 
and supporting information, requests for documentation, etc. will be maintained.  
Event Definitions 
The following event definitions will be applied to the Primary Endpoint Analysis during this 
study. Where possible, events will be categorized as being related to the endovascular 
procedure/bifurcated device, to the fenestrated device, or to the renal stent graft device. 
 Death : Any death occurring during the study period, regardless of cause. 
Death will be further subcategorized as early (within 30 calendar days from the date of the 
procedure) or late (>30 days). It will also be subcategorized as aneurysm-related or not 
aneurysm-related. 
Aneurysm-related death  is defined as: any death occurring within 30 days from the date of 
the procedure, regardless of cause, and death due to aneurysm rupture or following any 
procedure intended to treat the aneurysm.  
 Procedural Technical Failure : An event occurring procedurally or within [ADDRESS_1184333]-
procedurally that meets one or more of the following criteria: 
o Aortic Stent Graft Failure  is defined as a failure of the bifurcated or fenestrated 
proximal extension stent graft to be delivered and deployed, such that the procedure i s 
not completed, or the device failure results in a serious complication, or a residual 
Type I or III endoleak that cannot be resolved during the index procedure; 
o Renal Stent Graft Failure  is defined as a failure of the renal stent graft to be delivered 
and deployed, such that the procedure is not completed, or the device failure results in 
a serious complication.  
 
 M
ajor Adverse Event : An event occurring during the trial that meets one of the following 
criteria: 
o All-Cause Death  (see above).  
o Bow
el Ischemia : the lack of adequate blood flow to the intestines that requires

o Myocardial Infarction : the presence of raised levels of one or more cardiac biomarkers 
in comparison to laboratory reference ranges;  
o Paraplegia : Paralysis of the lower extremities inclusive of the lower trunk.  
o Renal Failure : the need for temporary or permanent dialysis or >0.5mg/dL increase in 
pre-operative serum creatinine level at two consecutive intervals; 
o Respi[INVESTIGATOR_60064] : pneumonia or respi[INVESTIGATOR_622041] [ADDRESS_1184334]-procedure; 
o Stroke : a sudden development of neurological deficit due to vascular lesions of the 
brain such as hemorrhage, embolism, or thrombosis that persists for >24 hours. 
o Blood Loss >1,000cc : Estimated blood loss during the index procedure ≥1,000cc. 
 
 Other Definitions : 
o Aneurysm Enlargement : Core Lab reported aneurysm sac diameter increase of >5mm 
in late follow-up as compared to the initial post-operative measurement. 
o Aneurysm Rupture : internal bleeding or leaking of blood from the aneurysm 
subsequent to the index procedure. 
o Conversion to Open Repair : open surgical repair of the abdominal aortic aneurysm  due 
to unsuccessful delivery or deployment of the stent graft, due to complications or other 
clinical situations that precluded successful endovascular treatment, or at any time 
following initial successful endovascular treatment for any reason. 
o Cardiac Morbidity : acute myocardial infarction (diagnosed based on measured levels 
of one or more cardiac biomarkers in comparison to laboratory reference ranges); new 
onset heart failure (an acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_622042]/or pulmonary edema ); intractable or malignant arrhythmia 
requiring cardioversion or pacemaker placement; or coronary intervention (coronary 
artery by[CONTACT_15806] [CABG] or percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]).  
o Clinically Significant Device Migration : Core Lab reported aortic stent graft 
movement >10mm from the original implant location resulting in an intervention or in 
a serious complication. 
o Renal
 Dysfunction : a reduction in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 
>30% from the preoperative value; 
o Secondary Procedure : any non-diagnostic intervention after the index procedure 
intended to correct or repair an endoleak, limb occlusion, migration, aneurysm sac 
expansion and/or a device defect; 
o Stent Graft Occlusion : Intervention for aortic or renal stent graft occlusion or as 
reported by [CONTACT_851800].

then flow through the stent graft and is excluded from the aneurysmal portion of the aorta. 
The disadvantages of open surgical repair are: general anesthesia is required, it is a major abdominal 
surgery (large incision), has a significant surgical complication rate, and typi[INVESTIGATOR_286081] a long hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l 
stay and recovery. EVAR enables local or regional anesthesia to be used, uses a minimally invasive groin 
incision for catheter-based access, and has been reported in US clinical studies to offer a lower operative 
complication rate, reduced blood loss and procedure times, and shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. In contrast to open 
repair, EVAR is a relatively new treatment, long term results have not been fully established, and life-
long surveillance is recommended to verify stent graft integrity and patency and continued aneurysm 
exclusion. Currently, five device systems are FDA-approved and marketed in the US for endovascular 
infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. All of these devices require the introduction of catheter-
based treatment devices varying in outer diameter profile from 20Fr to 25Fr (ipsilateral). Standard 
vascular exposure is indicated for access. Prospective clinical study results support the safety and 
effectiveness of these stent grafts through early follow-up (to 30 days) and in late follow-up to one year 
and to up to five years. These and other devices are CE Marked and are available in other international 
regions. One custom device is available in Europe for JAA endovascular repair; however, no ‘off-the-
shelf’ endovascular devices are currently commercially available. No device is currently approved in the 
US for the endovascular repair of juxtarenal or pararenal aortic aneurysm. 
As with any procedure there are risks of serious complications, such as death. The inclusion and 
exclusion criteria for this population have been carefully established to limit the risk of mortality and 
morbidity in this population. The overall risk will be evaluated on an individual basis and discussed with 
each patient. All of the potential adverse events outlined previously could cause prolonged illness, 
permanent impairment of daily function or, in rare cases, death. Possible treatments could include, but 
are not limited to, emergency cardiac or vascular surgery.  
Eligibility criteria that exclude patients who are at higher risk for experiencing an anticipated adverse 
event have been selected to reduce the potential risks to patients who participate in this study. In 
addition, the assessment of patient anatomy for enrollment by [CONTACT_622071]. 
Pre-procedural high resolution, contrast-enhanced CT scanning and intraprocedural arteriography will be 
used to identify and target the aortic anatomy to facilitate the proper introduction, delivery, and 
deployment of the endovascular repair devices. Physician experience, rigorous application of a common 
protocol, and careful performance of the procedure with close monitoring of the patient after the 
procedure will also help to minimize risks. 
The alternative to endovascular repair of JAA/PAA is open surgical repair.

10.1 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
All primary analyses will be conducted on an intention to treat (ITT) basis with imputation for 
missing data as described in the Patient Accountability and Missing Data section below. Whereas 
ITT is a concept intended to be applied to randomized trials, its use in this analysis will imply that 
patients will be analyzed based on the attempt to implant trial devices during the procedure.  Patients 
who complete the trial through 12 months will comprise the completed cases (CC) population. CC 
patients who do not have protocol violations that can affect outcome will comprise the per protocol 
(PP) population. Additional analyses will be conducted in the CC population. 
10.2 PATIENT ACCOUNTABILITY AND MISSING DATA 
The proportion of patients with documented follow-up at each interval will be presented 
descriptively. The number of diagnostic, laboratory, and clinical evaluations will be tabulated by 
[CONTACT_6492]-up interval. Also, a listing of patients who initially consent but do not undergo a procedure 
due to withdrawal of consent will be given. However, these patients will not be included in any 
analysis. 
Information on missing or withdrawn patients will be tabulated presenting the number and proportion 
of patients eligible for and compliant with each follow-up examination.  Patients who withdraw from 
the trial will be tabulated with the reasons for the withdrawal. Additional sensitivity analyses will be 
performed as described below.   
The evaluation of patients with missing data presents a special concern in ITT analyses. All clinical 
studies analyze the results based on the completed cases ( i.e., those who complete the trial).  Because 
missing patients do not have final data, they present a problem for ITT analyses. The statistical 
community recommends that multiple sensitivity analyses be conducted to determine the robustness 
of the result in patients who complete the study.10,11,12,13  The intention of these analyses is to 
demonstrate that the results obtained from the evaluable patients are not biased. 
As a result, sensitivity analyses using multiple imputations will be conducted to evaluate the 
robustness of the study result accounting for missing observations. The primary effectiveness 
endpoint analysis will be based on an unbiased imputation of the determination of success or failure.   
It is expected that the number of patients with missing effectiveness data at one year will be 
approximately 15 patients (i.e., 15%).  The missing value for these patients will be assigned by a 
simple random sample from the patients with outcomes at one year.  This system is denoted the “Hot

(LOCF). Another sensitivity analysis will entail considering the subject lost to follow-up to have 
failed the endpoint. A third analysis will impute the missing result as having succeeded the endpoint. 
A final analysis will impute the missing value by a generating a random number and comparing it to 
the value of the performance goal for effectiveness. 
A comparison of baseline characteristics of the patients with missing data and those without missing 
data will be done to determine if there is evidence that the data are not missing at random (it is not 
possible to determine that data are missing at random). If the missing at random assumption is clearly 
violated by [CONTACT_643794], it is usually possible to find a sub-group that are not missing at 
random who have to be imputed differently, such as assigning the worst score to patients in the sub-
group.  For example, the proportion of patients missing an outcome may be much greater at a given 
study site which may also have a higher rate of failure.  Those patients from that site may be assigned 
a failure and the baseline comparisons of the remaining patients will be rechecked to see if the 
imbalances are resolved. If this resolves the missing at random difficulty, the sub groups will be 
given special scores and the remaining patients will be imputed as described above.   The resolution 
of
 the imbalance will be retested by [CONTACT_851802].   
The primary imputation will be done 10 times with 10 different seeds to initiate the random selection 
and the combined P-value for the 10 imputations will be obtained by a method described in Rubin 
(1987) and in the SAS manual for PROC MIANALYZE. The seeds to be used for the 10 imputations 
are selected from a pseudo-random number table in Steele and Torrie (1960) and are [ZIP_CODE], [ZIP_CODE], 
[ZIP_CODE], [ZIP_CODE], [ZIP_CODE], [ZIP_CODE], [ZIP_CODE], [ZIP_CODE], [ZIP_CODE], and [ZIP_CODE].[ADDRESS_1184337]-operatively (from day [ADDRESS_1184338]). Events within six months and one year, respectively, are those occurring up to and 
including 183 days and 365 days following the procedure. 
For categorical variables, summary statistics will include counts and proportions. Confidence limits 
for proportions will generally be given; for binary variables the confidence limits will be computed

range. Groups will be compared using t-tests or analysis of variance, or Kruskal-Wallis tests will be 
used to compare more than two groups (such as trial sites). When multiple comparisons are 
performed after ANOVA, Scheffé’s method will be used. The exact Wilcoxon test will be used to 
compare continuous variables where severe departures from normality are observed. 
For ordinal variables, comparisons will be performed using the exact Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Unless 
otherwise specified, the exact form of each algorithm will be the default of SAS® Version 9.[ADDRESS_1184340] trial site. It is not possible to determine the number of patients below 
which this aggregation will occur until after enrollment is completed, but generally trial sites with 
four or fewer patients may be combined. 
10.5 POOLING  
Data pooling incorporates two factors: combination of data across trial sites and the actual method of 
obtaining an estimate of the endpoint from combined data.  Data will be combined from multiple trial 
sites for the trial analyses. The justification for this pooling is made on a clinical basis with three 
critical factors: The basis for pooling comes from: 1) The trial sites must implement one common 
protocol; 2) The sponsor must provide very close monitoring of study site compliance; and, 3) the 
trial sites must use common data collection procedures.[ADDRESS_1184341] patients will be obtained by [CONTACT_41680] a weighted average of 
the proportions at each site with the weight being the inverse of the variance of the proportion at that

If the heterogeneity P-value is greater than 0.15, an analysis of the primary effectiveness endpoint by 
[CONTACT_851803] (1993) method will be done. 
10.6 PRIMARY SAFETY ANALYSIS  
10.6.1 The Primary Safety Hypothesis 
The primary safety research hypothesis to be tested is that the rate of Major Adverse Events 
(MAE s) at [ADDRESS_1184343] group is less than the rate of MAE at 30 days in the control 
group.  The null and alter native hypotheses are provided below.  
H0:
 Pt ≥ Pc  vs. H 1: Pt < P c,  where: 
Pt is the MAE rate at [ADDRESS_1184344] group;  
Pc is the MAE rate at 30 days in the historical surgical control group. 
 
10.6.2
 Sample Size 
The primary trial safety variable is the rate of MAEs (as previously defined) at 30 days 
following treatment with the Fenestrated Stent Graft System. In the U.S., the alternative for 
these patients with juxtarenal or pararenal aortic aneurysm is open surgical repair. The open 
surgical concurrent control group enrolled in the original Endologix trial between 2000 and 
2003 (that served as the basis for approval of the bifurcated stent graft under P040002) 
consisted of patients with aneurysms of these types. Of the 66 control patients enrolled in that 
trial, 3.0% had a suprarenal aneurysm, 21% had a pararenal aneurysm, and the remaining 
patients (76%) had a juxtarenal aneurysm or infrarenal aneurysm unsuitable for endovascular 
repair with the Endologix bifurcated device. These patients have completed full five year 
follow-up as documented in the Endologix PMA final report approved by [CONTACT_13229] 2009 
(P040002/R008).  
Owing to the availability of patient-level data within the Endologix PMA P040002 for this 
historical surgical control group with more complex aneurysms as intended to be enrolled in 
this trial, it is reasonable to consider it for sample size generation for the safety endpoint. The 
MAE incidence at [ADDRESS_1184345] group and this surgical control 
group is tabulated below:

Blood Loss ≥1,000cc  11 (5.7%)  38 (58%)  
 
Thus, the 30-day MAE rates were 8.3% (endovascular test group) and 67 % (surgical control 
group). To be conservative and to account for the fact that in the present trial, only more 
complex juxtarenal or pararenal aneurysms will be treated endovascularly, the rate for the test 
arm has been increased to 16.6%. It is expected that the rate of MAEs within 30 days in the 
treatment group in this trial will be smaller than that of the historical surgical control group as 
noted above. The sample size for this trial is calculated by [CONTACT_851804] a superiority trial. 
The primary hypothesis to be tested in this analysis is the following: 
H0: Pt ≥ Pc vs. H 1: Pt < P c,  where 
Pt is the MAE rate at [ADDRESS_1184346] group;  
Pc is the MAE rate at 30 days in the historical surgical control group.

f we assume that P t = 0.166, P c = 0.670, one-sided alpha = 0.025, and power = 80%, a very

l number of patients (<10) are required in the treatment group to test the above 
hypothesis, given [ADDRESS_1184347] to be 0.434 for there to be 81% power with an alpha of 0.025.   
 
10.6.3
 Propensity Score Analysis 
Because it is expected that there will be differences between the treated and control patients 
that might bias the comparison, a propensity score analysis will be attempted. This analysis 
will be done by [CONTACT_55467] (i.e., not affiliated with Endologix or with the 
primary study statistician, RP Chiacchierini and Associates) without knowledge of the 
primary safety outcomes that are adjudicated by [CONTACT_123337]. 
Furthermore, this analysis can be performed after all test patients are enrolled, and before the 
endpoint is reached by [CONTACT_16983]. The independent statistician will be required to document 
Endologix, Inc. February 27, [ADDRESS_1184348]. 
A non-parsimonious logistic regression analysis modeling treatment assignment by [CONTACT_851805]. Covariates for this analysis will be age, gender, ASA class, 
cardiac/coronary artery disease (a composite variable to include arrhythmia, CHF, prior MI, 
CABG/PCI, heart valve repair/replacement), histories of cancer, cerebrovascular disease, 
coagulopathy, COPD, diabetes, hypertension, liver disease, peripheral arterial occlusive 
disease, renal failure, smoking history, and aneurysm diameter. For the propensity score 
analysis, in covariates where missing data occurs, the missing data will be imputed by [CONTACT_851806] (greater than 10% of the sample size).  In that case, the missing value 
will be imputed by [CONTACT_567084].  If the variable is quantitative, the following steps will 
complete the imputation (stratified hot deck imputation): 
1. A histogram will be computed;  
2. A uniform random number between 0 and 1 will be chosen and compared to the relative 
frequency of the bars in the histogram to determine the range of the value. 
3. A second uniform random number will be generated, multiplied by [CONTACT_851807]; the integer portion of this product will be added to lower limit of the 
range to obtain the imputed value.    
If the variable is categorical, the correlation of the cases with other covariates will be 
evaluated to determine if there is a relationship between the value of the variable with missing 
data and a function of other covariates used in the analysis that results in ordinal integer 
values (perhaps the sum of a subset of several covariates that are present could be used).  If 
there is a significant correlation between the variable with missing values and the function, a 
cross tabulation of the subjects with scores for the variable with missing data and the function 
values will be formed.  The value of the missing observation will be assigned by [CONTACT_57148] a 
uniform random number and comparing that random number to the relative marginal 
frequency of the distribution of observed values for the given score of the function.  If no 
function can be found to be correlated with the data, the values will be assigned by [CONTACT_851808].      
The model will be obtained by [CONTACT_851809]. The final propensity 
model will contain all covariates for the first evaluation of balance. The propensity score 
analysis will be done without knowledge of MAE results for the test group. This is made 
possible by [CONTACT_851810]; their adjudicated results are not part of the clinical database but are separately 
maintained in a dedicated CEC database. 
The data will be divided into quintiles. Within the quintiles, the baseline characteristics are 
evaluated by [CONTACT_851811] a characteristic for which a statistically significant difference was observed 
Endologix, Inc. February 27, [ADDRESS_1184349] or control groups in a given stratum (less than two patients to allow 
estimation of the variance for continuous or ordinal covariates), the analysis will be attempted 
by [CONTACT_851812].  If the data are still too sparse, tertiles will be used.  While dividing the 
data into quintiles accounts for about 90% of the bias in measured variables, quartiles 
accounts for about 85% bias reduction, and tertiles account for about 80% bias reduction.19,20 
The sole rationale for acceptability of the degree of adjustment will be based on the F-
statistics for continuous or ordinal covariates or the chi-square statistics for categorical 
covariates.17 
If significant imbalance remains, the analysis involving the control group will be abandoned 
and an alternative analysis of the performance goal discussed in §10.6.[ADDRESS_1184350] will be done as follows: the differences will be computed within each 
propensity stratum and the test will be done using the method of Mehrota and Railkar using

If the P-value from either test above is less than a one-sided 0.025, then the null hypothesis for 
this analysis will be rejected in favor of the alternative indicating that the new patients have a 
statistically significantly smaller rate of MAE than the historical surgical control group.   
A descriptive analysis and a Kaplan-Meier analysis of the MAE composite at 30 days will be 
presented. The descriptive analysis will present the rates for the composite MAE and each 
individual adverse event that is part of the composite with corresponding 95% exact 
confidence intervals. 
To determine those factors that may be associated with MAE, a supportive covariate analy ses 
will be performed by [CONTACT_851815]. Covariates for these analyses will be age, 
gender, ASA class, cardiac/coronary artery disease (a composite variable to include 
arrhythmia, CHF, prior MI, CABG/PCI, heart valve repair/replacement), histories of cancer, 
cerebrovascular disease, coagulopathy, COPD, diabetes, hypertension, liver disease, 
peripheral arterial occlusive disease, renal failure, smoking, selected aneurysm characteristics, 
propensity class (numerical classification of the stratum  based on patient’s propensity score), 
plus any variables found to be out of balance in the comparability analyses. Because there is 
no exact congruence of study sites between the test and control groups it is not possible to 
account for study site in this analysis. To observe the effect of study site, a multivariable 
ana
lysis will be done only in the test patients to determine if the study site remains a 
significant influence to the rate of MAE when other covariates are included in the analysis.  
Often the differences in study site responses are the result of differences in baseline 
characteristics the patients at that site such that when a model includes both the study site 
effect and the covariates effect, the study site no longer retains statistical significance.

If the z has a P-value less than a one-sided alpha of 0.025, the null will be rejected and the 
alternative will be accepted. 
Similar to the strategy employed above, to determine those factors that may be associated with 
MAE, a supportive covariate analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_851816]. Covariates for these analyses will be age, gender, ASA class, cardiac/coronary 
artery disease (a composite variable to include arrhythmia, CHF, prior MI, CABG/PCI, heart 
valve repair/replacement), histories of cancer, cerebrovascular disease, coagulopathy, COPD, 
diabetes, hypertension, liver disease, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, renal failure, 
smoking, maximum aneurysm diameter, and study site. The final model will be reduced by 
[CONTACT_851817] a P-value less than 
0.05. 
10.7 PRIMARY EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS  
10.7.1 Primary Effectiveness Hypothesis 
The primary effectiveness research hypothesis is that the treatment success rate at one year 
exceeds a performance goal of 80%. The null and alternative hypothesis is presented below. 
H0: P ≤ 0.80 vs. H a: P > 0.80 
Where P is the rate of Treatment Success as defined in §10.7.2. 
 
Endologix, Inc. February 27, [ADDRESS_1184355]-
operatively. Treatment Success is a composite of clinically-relevant outcomes, including 
procedural technical success and absence of: aneurysm rupture, conversion to open repair, 
Type I endoleak after 30 days; Type III endoleak; clinically significant migration; aneurysm 
enlargement; or secondary intervention for resolution of endoleak, limb occlusion, migration, 
aneurysm sac expansion and/or a device defect.  
The sample size is obtained by [CONTACT_643803] 2008. A 
sample size of [ADDRESS_1184356] 80.58% power against a null 
performance goal of 80% if the proportion of Treatment Success is 90% or higher for alpha = 
a one-sided 0.05.  It is estimated that the rate of Treatment Success will be greater than 90%.  
It is anticipated that the drop-out rate of the trial will be 15% or less. Because the larger of the 
two sample sizes after adjustment for loss to withdrawal is the one for effectiveness, 82/0.85 
= 97 patients will need to be recruited for this trial. 
10.7.3 Analysis Plan 
The primary effectiveness analysis will compare the Treatment Success  rate as defined 
previously to a target rate of 80%. The null and alternative hypotheses are defined below. 
 
H0: Pt ≤ 0.80 
 
H1:
 Pt > 0.80 
 
Where P t = the proportion of treated patients who meet the Treatment Success definition.  The 
observed proportion of patients with Treatment Success at one year post-procedure will be 
tested with the exact binomial distribution under the null hypothesis given in the inequality 
above.  The formula for this expression is presented below.

Where x t is the number of successes at one year and n t is the number evaluated.  If the one-
si
ded P-value is less than 0.05, the null hypothesis will be rejected and the study hypothesis 
w
ill be demonstrated. 
If the study site success proportions across study site are not homogeneous, then the method 
of Fleiss described above will be used in the Test arm only to obtain a weighted estimate of 
the proportion successful.  The mean proportion is found the same way as the first equation 
above. The test statistic becomes a z-statistic with the following formula:

If the z < 1.645 (P=0.05, one-sided), then the null hypothesis will be rejected in favor of the 
alternative and the primary effectiveness endpoint will be achieved.  
To determine those factors that may be associated with Treatment Success, covariate analyses 
will be performed by [CONTACT_851818]. Possible covariates eligible 
for these analyses will be age, gender, ASA class, cardiac/coronary artery disease (a 
composite variable to include arrhythmia, CHF, prior MI,  CABG/PCI, heart valve 
repair/replacement) , cancer, cerebrovascular disease, COPD, diabetes, hypertension, liver 
disease, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, renal failure, smoking,  maximum aneurysm 
diameter, and study site.  Because there are too many possible covariates to include in a model, 
sc
reening is necessary to reduce the number of eligible covariates for consideration in the 
final model. Screening logistic regression models to i nclude only the covariate, will be used. 
If the P -value for the screening model for the covariate is less than 0.20, the covariate will be 
included in the competition for the final model . The final model will be obtained by [CONTACT_851819] P -v alue less than 0.[ADDRESS_1184358] a statistically significant relationship to the MAE rate.

his or her care. 
Each investigator is responsible for supervising all procedures conducted under this protocol at 
his or her institution.  
Furthermore, the investigator is responsible for ensuring that data are completely, accurately, and 
promptly recorded on each patient’s CRFs and related documents are available to verify the 
accuracy of the CRFs, and for ensuring the clinical monitor has access to all necessary records to 
ensure the integrity of the data.  
d) Core Lab and Independent Physician Assessor : The Core Lab is responsible for the processing 
and assessment of all submitted CT scans preoperatively and imaging postoperatively and for 
reporting of results. The independent physician assessor is responsible for evaluating the Core 
Lab processed baseline CT scan to determine patient anatomical suitability for enrollment. In 
addition, for patients deemed anatomically eligible, the independent physician assessor is 
responsible for recommending the size of renal stent graft for each artery. 
e) Data Management Group : The data management group is responsible for database development, 
validation, control and management of input from monitored CRFs, maintenance, and reporting 
for statistical analysis.

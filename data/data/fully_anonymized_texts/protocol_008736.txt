BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE: 39 
1. Achieving glycemic goals in type 2 diabetes has multiple beneficial health 40 
consequences. 41 
There are over 25 million patients with diabetes in the US [1], a disease with tremendous 42 
health, social, and economic implications. Studies like [LOCATION_006]PDS [2, 3]  and Kumamoto [4, 43 
5] have established an undeniable link between hyperglycemia and micro- and even [ADDRESS_407376] of the population with diabetes, particularly in minority 48 
groups and those with lower level of education, still does not reach glycemic targets [6-49 
8]. Given the large epi[INVESTIGATOR_296547] [ADDRESS_407377] of healthcare – a very timely concern for 52 
our healthcare system[9-11]. 53 
 54 
2. Treatment guidelines for type 2 diabetes advocate insulin treatment for patients with a 55 
HbA1c>10%. [ADDRESS_407378] been published by [CONTACT_203292]/EASD [12] and AACE 57 
[13], with the purpose of providing guidance to healthcare providers caring for patients [ADDRESS_407379] line therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes in addition to lifestyle 60 
changes [2, 12-14]. There is no general agreement as to what is the best way to advance [ADDRESS_407380] not achieved target HbA1c levels with monotherapy [12, 62 
13]. The current ADA and AACE guidelines both recommend an individualized approach [ADDRESS_407381], patient’s 64 
preference, and profile of available medications [12, 13] It is generally accepted that 65 
patients with HbA1c level >10 % have a low probability of achieving ideal glycemic 66 
target of <7.0% with any of the traditional oral hypoglycemic agents, or even after basal 67 
insulin-only initiation. Therefore such patients will require prandial insulin, whether 68 
administered as a mixed formulation or basal-bolus regimen in order to archive glycemic 69 
goals [6, 12, 13, 15-26]. 70 
 71 
3. Insulin is a very effective glucose lowering agent, but it is associated with multiple 72 
side effects and shortcomings. 73 
Patients with a very elevated HbA1c (>10%) are traditionally thought to have more 74 
advanced disease [2, 6] as well as glucotoxicity [27, 28],  which coupled with the need to 75 
lower HbA1c by >3% to reach glycemic targets, make insulin an obvious treatment 76 
choice [15, 29]. Insulin is considered the most effective hypoglycemic agent and 77 
therefore capable of lowering HbA1c into target range regardless of baseline glycaemia 78 
[15]. Yet an insulin based treatment regimen, when implemented correctly and 79 
intensively, takes a significant toll on the patient’s lifestyle by [CONTACT_37228] a higher 80 
commitment to disease management in the form of more frequent self-monitoring, 81 
multiple daily injections, requires more frequent dose adjustments, and a greater 82 
investment in insulin-related diabetes education [30, 31]. Furthermore, insulin treatment 83 
U1111-1145-7585      PROTOCOL VERSION 3.1       05/06/[ADDRESS_407382] undesirable side effects: weight gain and 84 
hypoglycemia [30, 32]. [ADDRESS_407383] patients with diabetes are overweight and obese, development of which is often the 89 
initial event in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes [1, 33, 34]. Using therapeutic 90 
agents that focus primarily on blood glucose control but promote further weight gain 91 
seems counterintuitive, as this further worsens insulin resistance, which in turns results in 92 
an increase in insulin requirement, thus fueling a vicious cycle which promotes disease 93 
progression [35]. A Swedish study confirmed the deleterious effects of weight gain after 94 
diabetes diagnosis, as it demonstrated that patients with newly diagnosed diabetes who 95 
gain, rather than lose or maintain weight, are at a significantly increased risk of 96 
cardiovascular death [36]. [ADDRESS_407384] on patients’ life and beyond. Even 101 
seemingly minor hypoglycemic events create treatment related anxiety, heighten social 102 
anxiety, can limit or interfere with the patients’ professional and social life, and can lead [ADDRESS_407385] medical consequences like dementia, cardiovascular risk, 105 
seizures, and even death [30]. It also carries a great financial burden both in direct cost [ADDRESS_407386] wages and work absenteeism [31]. 107 
The effects of hypoglycemia reach beyond the patient, affecting the psychological, social, 108 
and financial well-being of the whole family [37]. [ADDRESS_407387] overall 111 
benefit, rather than a glucose-centric approach. 112 
With an ever increasing focus on personalized patient-centric treatment [12, 13], there is [ADDRESS_407388] on quality of life and treatment 117 
satisfaction [31, 37, 38]. The increase in treatment acuity related to insulin translates into 118 
higher healthcare related costs, a very timely concern for our economy [9-11, 31].  [ADDRESS_407389] been a relatively recent addition to our diabetes treatment 123 
armamentarium. They exert many beneficiary actions, counteracting many of the basic 124 
pathophysiologic determinants of diabetes: enhance glucose stimulated insulin secretion, 125 
suppress glucagon production, promotes satiety, decreases food intake, improves insulin 126 
sensitivity, lower ectopic fat deposition (i.e. liver steatosis, visceral fat), etc. GLP-1 127 
agonists lower HbA1c by 1.5-2%, have a very low risk of hypoglycemia, and promote 128 
weight loss – all very desirable effects in patients with type 2 diabetes [35]. While this 129 
U1111-1145-7585      PROTOCOL VERSION 3.1       05/06/[ADDRESS_407390] line agent after metformin failure. 134 
 135 
8. The combination of basal insulin and GLP-1 agonists has been proven to be safe and 136 
very effective. 137 
A meta-analysis of pooled data from across the LEAD program demonstrated that in 138 
patients with baseline HbA1c of > 9%  liraglutide was better than glargine as an add on to 139 
oral hypoglycemic medications with average reduction in HbA1c of 1.9% [39]. Several [ADDRESS_407391] is added 141 
to  background therapy and compared to basal insulin, with the additional benefit of 142 
weight loss and minimal hypoglycemia [40-43]. GLP-[ADDRESS_407392] has also demonstrated 143 
superiority when added to maximized basal insulin therapy and metformin, when 144 
compared to prandial insulin alone [40, 44-48]. Furthermore, treatment with GLP-[ADDRESS_407393] effective and simple strategy to achieve near normal glycemia in 151 
patients with a baseline HbA1c < 10%, while avoiding the side effects of weight gain, [ADDRESS_407394]-prandial 153 
hyperglycemia, weight gain, and hypoglycemia from the association of basal insulin to 154 
orals agents [40, 41, 43-48]. It is still not known whether these favorable effects extent to [ADDRESS_407395] a baseline HbA1c 156 
>10%. Liraglutide reduces blood glucose by [CONTACT_329708] [ADDRESS_407396] on HbA1c and weight loss was found to be largely 158 
independent of diabetes duration and baseline HbA1c [39]. Treatment with GLP-1 159 
agonists has also been associated with low secondary failure rates, durable and sustained 160 
long term blood glucose control, and durability of the initial weight loss [39, 42, 49].  [ADDRESS_407397] properties of GLP-1 agonists and simplicity of use, we 163 
propose they could represent a viable alternative to intensive insulinization in 164 
patients with very uncontrolled (HbA1c >10%) type 2 diabetes. 165 
 166 
The aim of this study is to compare a GLP-1 plus basal insulin treatment regimen to a 167 
basal-bolus treatment regimen in patients with very uncontrolled (HbA1c>10%) type [ADDRESS_407398] to all other variables.  173 
 174 
U1111-1145-7585      PROTOCOL VERSION 3.1       05/06/[ADDRESS_407399] we treat this – unfortunately – significant [ADDRESS_407400] – representing [ADDRESS_407401] control in addition to that observed in our study and a small step 189 
in alleviating the huge shortage of endocrinologists nationwide. 190 
 191 
We are uniquely positioned to perform this study for multiple reasons: (1) we serve [ADDRESS_407402] county hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329692] 193 
overrepresented; (2) our county hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77690] a closed healthcare system, where all 194 
actual health-care related costs incurred by [CONTACT_329709]; 195 
(3) the PI (and sub-I) have extensive clinical experience with this study population; 196 
(4) the PI [INVESTIGATOR_329693], with proven track record of [ADDRESS_407403] challenging research protocols. 199 
 200 
 201 
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES: 202 
We plan to evaluate a new GLP-1 based treatment strategy for patients with very 203 
uncontrolled (HbA1c>10%) type [ADDRESS_407404] basal-bolus 204 
insulin regimen. 205 
 206 
Primary Specific Aim: To determine the non-inferiority of the basal insulin-GLP-[ADDRESS_407405] combination therapy to full basal-bolus insulin combination therapy in patients 208 
with very uncontrolled (HbA1c>10%) type 2 diabetes. 209 
 210 
Specific aims: [ADDRESS_407406] to a disease and patient- 212 
relevant composite outcome of effectiveness (HbA1c <7%) and safety (no 213 
hypoglycemia and no weight gain); [ADDRESS_407407] to treatment burden (number of 215 
daily shots, amount of glucose self-monitoring, need for treatment titration); [ADDRESS_407408] to quality of life [as measured 217 
by a disease specific (DQOL) questionnaire and general heath (SF-36) 218 
questionnaire]; 219 
U1111-1145-7585      PROTOCOL VERSION 3.1       05/06/[ADDRESS_407409] to all healthcare related costs: [ADDRESS_407410] of the pharmacologic agents, glucose monitoring supplies, all other 221 
pharmacologic (non-study related) and non-pharmacologic healthcare related 222 
costs (outpatient and inpatient, diabetes related and non-diabetes related). We will 223 
also compare actual physician time spent during office visits and non-visit related 224 
care of these patients. While no actual dollar amount can be attached to this 225 
(phone visits and longer office visits required by [CONTACT_329710] 226 
education are not customarily reimbursable) time commitment is of great 227 
relevance to our physicians who care for these very complex patients. 228

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS 269 
Study type: 270 
 Single Center (UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, TX) 271 
 Randomized 272 
 Single blind (evaluator) 273 
 Two treatment arms (treatment and control) 274 
 Length of intervention: 6 months 275

 Non-inferiority trial for primary outcome 277 
 278 
Study Design:  [ADDRESS_407413] a prospective, randomized, single blind, two-arm, parallel trial 280 
comparing two treatment regimens (liraglutide, detemir, and metformin versus aspart, 281 
detemir, and metformin) in patients with very uncontrolled (HbA1c>10%) type 2 282 
diabetes. The investigator performing the study related measurements will be blinded to 283 
the patients’ treatment assignment. 284

 8obtained from Parkland Health and Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48214] (PHHS), which represents the study 292 
site. 293 
 294 
Rationale for study Design  295 
 The randomized design, with stratification for pertinent variables, will allow us to [ADDRESS_407415] to treat 297 
patient population. 298 
 A 3-7 day run-in period was introduced in order to ensure patient compliance with 299 
study procedures prior to randomization. 300 
 The patient-guided titration schedule for basal insulin is well validated in the 301 
literature and should help to lower fasting glucose level within a shorter period of 302 
time. 303 
 A 6-month intervention period was chosen as nadir HbA1c after initiation of a 304 
treatment regimen is achieved by [CONTACT_159753], therefore allowing us to evaluate the 305 
full effectiveness of these interventions.  306

approach their treatment. 362 
 363 
Rationale for Study Location 364 
Only patients from the PHHS system will be recruited. PHHS is a county hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329697] 365 
provides comprehensive care (primary, specialty, inpatient and outpatient) to the indigent [ADDRESS_407419]. 370 
 371 
Randomization Criteria 372 
1. Patient returned a fully completed 7-point glucose profile – suggesting likely [ADDRESS_407420] may withdraw consent at any time. 377 
2. Severe drug-related side effects including (but not limited to) acute pancreatitis, 378 
severe nausea and/or vomiting, renal failure, diagnosis of medullary thyroid [ADDRESS_407421]’s diabetes control remains unchanged or becomes worse. 382 
U1111-1145-7585      PROTOCOL VERSION 3.1       05/06/[ADDRESS_407422] is unable to keep appointments or to follow the researcher’s instructions. [ADDRESS_407423] Replacement 389 
Subjects who withdraw or become ineligible will not be replaced. A drop-out rate of 12% 390 
is estimated and already calculated in the recruitment plan. 391 
 392 
Study Schedule 393 
Recruitment: 394 
We will recruit patients from the following locations within the PHHS: emergency room 395 
(only if discharged home after the evaluation), primary care clinics, any specialty clinic 396 
(including diabetes clinic). Eligible patients will be informed about the trial by [CONTACT_2030] 397 
treating physician. If agreeable, they will be contact[CONTACT_329713] a screening 398 
appointment scheduled as soon as feasible (within days).  399 
 400 
Screening Visit (visit 1): 401 
During the screening visit patients will complete the informed consent process and will 402 
undergo a complete assessment for all inclusion and exclusion criteria. A complete 403 
medical history and comprehensive physical examination will be performed. Blood will 404 
be drawn (if not done within the past 7 days) to assess for all eligibility criteria (HbA1c, [ADDRESS_407424], if applicable). Patients will receive an [ADDRESS_407425] with information about participation in the study. Patients will be 407 
asked to complete a 7-point glucose profile on the day prior to their next visit. 408 
 409 
Randomization (visit 2):  410 
Randomization will occur at the second visit (3-7 days from visit 1-screening). The study 411 
statistician will generate a blocked randomization scheme (1:1) stratified by “any insulin 412 
treatment at time of screening” (yes/no) and BMI (cutoff 37 kg/m2 – the average BMI of 413 
this study population in our PHHS Diabetes Clinic). 414 
 415 
At this visit we will obtain a full baseline evaluation of all outcome parameters. All 416 
patients will meet with the dietician to received education regarding recommended 417 
lifestyle modifications. Patient will undergo diabetes education as well as teaching 418 
regarding insulin injection and titration. 419 
 420 
Phone follow-up/ Drug titration visit: 421 
At 2-wk from randomization (visit 3) a phone visit will take place to assess for safety 422 
parameters (particularly hypoglycemia) and perform protocol-driven treatment titration. 423 
 424 
Follow-up visits:  425 
At 1-, 3-, and 6-months (visits 4, 5, 6) patients will be followed-up in person for interim 426 
(and end of study, respectively) evaluations of all outcome parameters, as well as 427 
U1111-1145-7585      PROTOCOL VERSION 3.1       05/06/[ADDRESS_407426] visit in the study. 429 
 430 
Interventions: 431 
Both groups will either continue or initiate treatment with metformin. To minimize 432 
gastrointestinal side effects metformin will be initiated at 500 mg daily (or continued at 433 
current dose) and titrated weekly in 500 mg increments to the final dose of 1000 mg 434 
twice daily (or maximum tolerated dose which should be at least 500 mg BID). 435 
 436 
Both groups will be initiated on basal insulin detemir. If new to insulin, this will be 437 
started at 0.3 units/kg once daily at bedtime and self-titrated based on the study protocol 438 
(see detemir patient self-titration table). If already on basal insulin, will take the total 439 
daily dose of basal insulin and perform a 1:1 dose conversion  to insulin detemir, which 440 
will be administered once daily at bedtime, followed by [CONTACT_329714]. Additionally, 441 
physician-directed titration will occur, if needed, during the scheduled phone and/or 442 
office visits, as well as any unscheduled patient-initiated visits (phone/in person, if 443 
applicable). All patients new to insulin will be seen by [CONTACT_329715] 444 
instruction in insulin injection techniques. 445

 448 
Patients randomized to liraglutide will stop any insulin products besides detemir (if 449 
applicable), initiate liraglutide at 0.6 mg/day, and  dose escalate weekly to 1.2 mg/dl and 450 
final dose of 1.8 mg/dl. Patients who develop significant and persistent gastrointestinal 451 
side effects  are allowed to down-titrate  the dose of liraglutide to 1.2 mg/dl  for [ADDRESS_407427] resolve.   453 
 454 
Patients randomized to meal-time insulin will initiate insulin aspart before each meal. 455 
Aspart insulin will be initiated at a dose of 0.3 units/kg/day divided among the number of 456 
meals taken daily. Meal-time insulin titration, if needed, can be either patient driven (see 457 
table below) or physician-directed during the scheduled follow-up visits (phone or in 458 
person), as well as any unscheduled patient-initiated visits (if applicable). 459

 573 
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PARTICIPATION IN THE STUDY: 574 
Risks of Liraglutide: 575 
  576 
Very common (reported by [CONTACT_726] 10 percent  of the patients): 577 
 -  Gastrointestinal adverse events are the most common side effect of liraglutide 578 
and reported in up to 41% of patients. Nausea is seen in approximately 13% of [ADDRESS_407440] 2 weeks. It 580 
tends to be mild, dose-related and decline over time. In some patients the nausea 581 
can be more severe and be associated with vomiting which is usually transient 582 
and self-resolving. 583 
 584 
Common (reported by 5-10 percent of the patients) 585 
 Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) - - The risk of having hypoglycemia with 586 
liraglutide is higher if taking it with another medicine that can cause 587 
hypoglycemia, such as a sulfonylurea or insulin. In some people, the blood 588 
glucose may get so low that they need another person to help them. The dose of 589 
your sulfonylurea medicine or insulin may need to be lowered while using 590 
liraglutide.  591 
 Headache and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_329700] 7-9% of 592 
patients treated with liraglutide. A similar percentage of patients developed 593 
headaches with placebo or comparator drug.  594 
 595 
Uncommon side effects (reported by 1-5 percent of the patients):  596 
 Injection site reactions (e.g., injection site rash, erythema) were reported in 597 
approximately 2% of liraglutide treated patients in the five clinical trials of at [ADDRESS_407441] 26 weeks duration. Less than 0.2% of liraglutide-treated patients 599 
discontinued due to injection site reactions. 600 
 601 
Very rare  side effects (affects less than 1 percent of patients)  602 
 Acute pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) - there have been few reported 603 
event of acute pancreatitis presenting with persistent severe abdominal pain 604 
(usually accompanied by [CONTACT_492]). Patients  experiencing the above symptoms [ADDRESS_407442] the  study doctor who will decide on whether they should 606 
discontinue the trial medication and /or require additional diagnostic procedures. 607 
 Rarely, a severe form of allergic reaction (anaphylactic reaction) with additional [ADDRESS_407443] heart beat 609 
U1111-1145-7585      PROTOCOL VERSION 3.1       05/06/2014 
 16etc. has been reported with marketed use of Liraglutide. Patients experiencing 610 
these symptoms  should seek immediate medical help and inform the  trial doctor 611 
as soon as possible.  612 
 Kidney failure – Liraglutide may cause nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, leading to 613 
loss of fluids (dehydration). Dehydration may cause kidney failure which can [ADDRESS_407444] never had 615 
kidney problems before. Drinking plenty of fluids may reduce the risk of 616 
dehydration.  617 
 618 
Other potential risks related to liraglutide: 619 
 Hyperglycemia  (too high blood glucose) can occur, especially if there is 620 
insufficient treatment. . The symptoms of hyperglycemia include increased 621 
urination, feeling thirsty, losing appetite, feeling sick (nausea or vomiting), 622 
feeling drowsy or tired, flushed, dry skin, dry mouth and a fruity (acetone) smell 623 
of the breath. If not treated, these symptoms may develop into a serious condition 624 
called diabetic ketoacidosis which may even lead to death.  625 
 Thyroid tumors, including cancer -During the drug testing process, the medicine [ADDRESS_407445] to 631 
be surgically removed. Fibrosarcomas (cancer underneath the skin) were seen at 632 
the point of injection (skin) in male mice that underwent a 2 year study of 633 
liraglutide. These fibrosarcomas were attributed to the high local concentration 634 
of drug near the injection site. The liraglutide concentration in the preparation 635 
used for humans is 10 times higher than the concentration used in mice. It is not 636 
known if liraglutide will cause fibrosarcomas in people. 637 
 638 
Risk of insulin detemir and aspart:  639 
 640 
Very common (1-10 in 100 patients): 641 
 Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) is the most common adverse reaction of insulin 642 
therapy and may be life- threatening if severe and not treated appropriately. 643 
 Mild-moderate weight gain is expected with any insulin therapy 644 
 645 
Less common (less than 1 in 100 patients): 646 
 Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur 647 
with any insulin products, including detemir insulin or aspart insulin. 648 
 Other adverse reactions associated with detemir insulin and/or aspart insulin 649 
include injection site reactions, lipohypertrophy, rash, itching. 650 
 Needles and insulin pens should never be shared. 651 
 652 
Risk of Metformin:  653 
 654 
Very common (1-10 in 100 patients): 655 
U1111-1145-7585      PROTOCOL VERSION 3.1       05/06/2014 
 17• Abdominal or stomach discomfort 656 
• Decreased appetite 657 
• Diarrhea 658 
• Bloating 659 
• Low serum Vitamin B12 levels without clinical manifestations 660 
 661 
Precautions:  662 
 Lactic Acidosis: Lactic acidosis is a very rare, but serious, metabolic complication 663 
that can occur due to Metformin accumulation during treatment with Metformin 664 
HCl; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis 665 
may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, 666 
including diabetes mellitus.  Metformin should be discontinued immediately and 667 
health care provider should be promptly notifed if unexplained increase in 668 
breathing rate, muscle aches, fatigue and unusual somnolence occur. 669 
 Patients with Renal disease or renal dysfunction (e.g., as suggested by [CONTACT_329723] <30 670 
ml/min) should not use metformin 671 
 Metformin should be temporarily discontinued 48h prior to radiologic studies [ADDRESS_407446] materials 48h prior to 673 
procedure to avoid increased risk of development of lactic acidosis and restarted 674 
24h after the procedure. 675 
 Excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic should be avoided while 676 
receiving Metformin. 677 
 678 
SAFEGUARDS AND PRECAUTIONS TO MINIMIZE RISKS/HARMS: 679 
 Hypoglycaemia epi[INVESTIGATOR_329701]- 680 
glucose monitoring. Review of blood glucose diary and hypoglycaemic events 681 
will be discussed during office, phone visits and as needed. Patient will be 682 
instructed during randomization visit on how to proper handle mild, moderate and 683 
severe hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_329702] 684 
according to study protocol. Those instructions will be reinforced as needed 685 
during the study.  686 
 687 
 Should any patients randomized to liraglutide treatment experience persistent 688 
hyperglycemia (defined as Hb1c>10%) at the 3-mo visit (visit 5), meal-time [ADDRESS_407447] group 690 
 691 
 Should any patients randomized to the “standard of care” group  experience 692 
persistent hyperglycemia (defined as HbA1c>10%) at the 3-mo visit (visit 5), 693 
treatment and insulin titration will continue as scheduled.    694 
 695 
 Patients will be monitored closely for any drug-related side effects. They will be [ADDRESS_407448] phone line, so they 697 
can immediately report any problems or concerns. Instructions will be given on 698 
possible side effects and how to avert/minimize them. 699 
 700 
U1111-1145-7585      PROTOCOL VERSION 3.1       05/06/2014 
 18 Only qualified personnel will perform blood draws to minimize the risk of 701 
complications. 702 
 703 
 Patients are allowed to skip questions on the questionnaire should they feel that 704 
the question might pose a psychological burden.      705 
 706 
 707 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS: [ADDRESS_407449] a non-inferiority hypothesis comparing the 6-month change from 710 
baseline in HbA1c between the two treatment groups, with a non-inferiority margin of 711 
0.4%. We conservatively estimate the standard deviation of the difference at 0.5% based 712 
on results from reported studies with similar design[44, 45, 47]. Using a one-sided alpha [ADDRESS_407450] with other 715 
scenarios (Hintze, J. (2011). PASS 11. NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, Utah, [LOCATION_003]. 716 
www.ncss.com ). We will need to randomize [ADDRESS_407451] this hypothesis assuming 717 
a 12% drop-out rate (estimated drop-out rate based on our extensive prior experience 718 
with similar population and length of study). We plan to screen 120 patients to account 719 
for approximately 20% anticipated screen failures. [ADDRESS_407452] (H0: Diff >= NIM;

 728 
Randomization  729 
Treatment assignment will occur at the second visit. The study statistician will generate a 730 
blocked randomization scheme (1:1) stratified by “any insulin treatment at time of 731 
screening” (yes/no) and BMI (cutoff 37 kg/m2 – the average BMI of this study 732 
population in our PHHS Diabetes Clinic), programmed using SAS Proc Plan. 733 
 734 
Statistical Analysis Plan 735 
All statistical analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_4305] (Beverley Huet), who 736 
has extensive experience in clinical trials analysis.  737 
Primary analysis: The primary analysis will be intention-to-treat (ITT) which will include [ADDRESS_407455] basal-bolus insulin 740 
regimen will be assessed using a 95% confidence interval for the between treatment 741 
group net difference (month 6 minus month 0) in HbA1c at 6 months. This 95% [ADDRESS_407456] square means estimated 743 
from a mixed model repeated measures analysis. Non-inferiority of liraglutide treatment 744 
will be concluded if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval is less than the non-745 
inferiority margin of 0.4%.    746 
 747 
Secondary analyses:  We will also perform a per-protocol analysis comparing HbA1c [ADDRESS_407457] the null hypothesis. The per-protocol population is defined as the population who 750 
continued the assigned intervention as randomized for the duration of the study period. 751 
Secondary outcomes include the composite endpoint of HbA1c<7% with no 752 
hypoglycemia and no significant weight gain, a binary variable, which will be compared 753 
between the randomized study groups with a logistic regression model. The odds ratio 754 
and corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be reported.  From healthcare related [ADDRESS_407458]-effectiveness ratios will be summarized as point estimates with 95% 756 
confidence intervals, accounting for the skewness in the distribution of the ratio[50]. [ADDRESS_407459] analyses will be performed to further assess variables such as treatment 758 
failure and quality of life weights. Multiple logistic regression models will be constructed 759 
to evaluate any association of baseline covariates on treatment efficacy.   Binary 760 
secondary endpoints will also be assessed with logistic regression models. Group 761 
comparisons and changes from baseline over time (study visits) of continuous secondary [ADDRESS_407460] 763 
will be used to compare the pre-specified “treatment failure” end-point between groups.  764 
Safety endpoints and hypoglycemic and other adverse events will summarize in detail 765 
with descriptive statistics. The analysis of safety data will be performed for the ITT 766 
population. 767 
Model assumptions regarding normality and covariance structure will be carefully 768 
assessed. Nonparametric tests or data transformations will be used if necessary to meet 769 
assumptions. Statistical analysis will be performed with SAS software (SAS Institute, 770 
Cary NC), particularly Proc Mixed for linear models with both fixed and random effects. 771

ETHICS: 793 
Ethical Considerations: 794 
1. Exclusion of non-English speakers- while translators are available during working 795 
hours, the investigators are worried that no translator will be available to assure 796 
safety measures at all times. 797 
2. Compliance with Insulin Regimen- At times patients are not compliant with 798 
complicated insulin regimens and providers often continue to uptitrate insulin 799 
dosage when patients remain above HbA1c goal.  If patient compliance improves 800 
once enrolled in the study, there is a higher risk of hypoglycemia.  Every effort 801 
will be made at all visits to determine exactly what amount of insulin the patient 802 
is taking and the overall compliance. 803

Auxiliary Supply 893 
Subjects will use their own glucose monitors, lancet devices, and lancets. They will be 894 
provided with log books.  895 
Randomization 896 
Treatment assignment will be made using stratified blocked randomization at visit 2. The 897 
stratification variables will be prior insulin use and BMI (cut off 37 kg/m2).   The 898 
randomization code will be generated by [CONTACT_329728], and 899 
consecutively numbered envelopes will be created. The investigator opens the next 900 
envelope at the randomization visit to determine the group assignment of the patient. 901 
 902 
Blinding 903 
This study is only blinded to the investigator performing the study assessments. The 904 
study is not blinded to the patient, nor the study doctor who will be providing diabetes 905

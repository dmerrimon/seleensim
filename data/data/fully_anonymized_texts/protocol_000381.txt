Primary Analysis Plan & Rationale Null Hypothesis:  There is no diff erence in cumulative daily in-
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_326699]. 
Statistical Method:  Student’s t-test. 
Rationale: 80 subjects will provide 80% power to detect a statistically 
significant effect with 2-sided alpha error set at 0.[ADDRESS_403182] is 19% absolute reduction in cumulative daily in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_326700].

1.2 Overview of Clinical Studies 
Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_326709] a variety of surgical specialties in both wound 
infiltration and regional nerve block.  Comparison of studi es is limited by [CONTACT_326799], placebo versus active control, and varied primary and secondary 
outcomes.  
The initial trials of Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_326710] [6].  In comparison 
to placebo, subjects undergoing hemorrhoidectomy had lower cumulative pain score and 
lower cumulative opi[INVESTIGATOR_326711] 72 hours after surgery [7].  In 
comparison to Standard Bupiv acaine, subjects undergoing breast augmentation had lower 
mean pain score at 12 hours and no differenc e for the remaining hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] [8].  
Subsequent trials have evaluated Liposomal B upi[INVESTIGATOR_326712] [9].  In

Version #: 9.0 Version Date: 11/5/[ADDRESS_403186] 48 hours [ 10, 11].  The most common adverse events 
associated with Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_326713], emesis, and/or 
constipation.  Cardiac and neurologic toxicity were not reported [6, 9].   
Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_274688]-a pproved for single-dose infiltration into the surgical site 
to produce postsurgical analgesia since 2015 and brachial plexus regional nerve block 
since 2018.  In clinical practice and research, it is also being used off-label for other forms 
of regional nerve block (includi ng intercostal nerve block).   
In thoracic surgery, there are two published studies that were both observational and 
retrospective.  They evaluated intercostal nerv e block versus epi[INVESTIGATOR_326714] h thoracotomy and minimally  invasive techniques [12, 
13].  Rice et al showed that there was no difference in pain sc ores, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], or 
postoperative complications betw een groups.  However, Khalil et al showed that there 
were lower mean pain scores on postoperative day one and three, no difference in opi[INVESTIGATOR_16445], and lower pulmonary complications  in subjects that received Liposomal 
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] [ Error! Bookmark not defined. ].  There is also an unpublished randomized, 
placebo-controlled trial in subjects that underwent thoracotomy and intercostal nerve 
block.  They did not find a di fference in pain scores or  total opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]. 
There are currently three regi stered clinical trials at  ClinicalTrials.gov evaluating 
Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_326715].  The Mayo Clinic  is performing a non-
inferiority trial of epi[INVESTIGATOR_326716] [14].  Inova Health Care Services 
is performing a trial assessing local wound infi ltration with Liposomal  Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_326717] s ubjects undergoing thoracoscopy [1 5].  [LOCATION_005] General 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_326718] a trial evaluating intercostal nerve block with Liposomal 
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], Standard Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], Standard  Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_21153], and normal 
saline in subjects undergoing vide o-assisted lung resection [16] .  Each of these studies 
address questions different fro m this proposal.  Moreover, th e results from these studies 
are not expected within the next year. 
[ADDRESS_403187] wall can result in splinting, 
atelectasis, and pneumonia [17].  There are a variety of multim odality analgesic strategies 
currently employed in the clinical setting;  however, the optimal strategy to provide 
analgesia while minimizing analgesic-rela ted complications is unknown.  With the 
development of Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], a su stained-release formul ation of Standard 
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], there has been renewed interest  in regional intercostal nerve blockade. 
Currently, most centers utilize some combinati on of epi[INVESTIGATOR_326719] a, systemic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], 
acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and gabapentin [18].  While this 
approach has proven effective, systemic opi[INVESTIGATOR_326720].  In the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], over 15% of pa tients receiving oxycodone will experience

 altered mental status, nausea, or  constipation [19].  In addition, it is essential to investigate 
other pain control strategies in considerat ion of the ongoing opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] a buse epi[INVESTIGATOR_901] [20].  
In regard to epi[INVESTIGATOR_326721], its placement is operator dependent, is limited by [CONTACT_326800], cannot be used in subjects on antip latelets or anticoagulants, requires frequent 
postoperative monitoring, is associated w ith postoperative hypotension and urinary 
retention, and can result in epi[INVESTIGATOR_326722]-threatening 
[21, 22]. 
Intercostal nerve blockage with Liposomal Bupi [INVESTIGATOR_326723] a sustained-release formul ation of Standard Bupi [INVESTIGATOR_10319].  Standard 
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_326724] 8 hours, but Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_326725] 96 hours [3].  Liposomal Bupi [INVESTIGATOR_274688]-approved for single-dose 
infiltration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical anal gesia since 2015 and brachial 
plexus regional nerve block since 2018.  Its use for other forms of regional nerve block 
(including intercostal nerve block)  is considered off-label.  
Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_326726], in cluding thoracic surgery.  The actual volume 
and breakdown of use in thoracic surgery is unknown; nonetheless,  over the half the 
audience at the Society of Thoracic Surgery Annual Conference in  January [ADDRESS_403188] been  only two observational studies 
within thoracic surgery [12, 13].  They  compared Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_326727] t echniques.  The results from these studies 
are subject to systematic erro r with selection bias and confounding.  In addition, as the 
proportion of minimally invasive to open surg ery has increased with  the use of robotic-
assisted thoracic surgery [23] , many centers have eliminated  epi[INVESTIGATOR_326728] t question is Liposomal  Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_326729]. 
As discussed in Section 1.2, there are ongoing tria ls that will provide less biased evidence 
in thoracic surgery assessing both local wound infiltration and intercostal nerve block with 
Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].  The Minimally Invasive Thoracic Surgery Intercostal Nerve 
Block Study is unique, because it will a ssess intercostal nerve block and wound 
infiltration with Standard B upi[INVESTIGATOR_326730]-assisted 
and robotic-assisted lung resection. 
A final consideration is the ec onomic impact of Liposomal Bupi [INVESTIGATOR_10319].  The direct costs 
of Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_326731] [ADDRESS_403189] costs of Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_326732] e $340 [24].  If Lipos omal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_326733], there could be cost  savings through a reduction in use of other 
pain medications and postoperative compli cations.  Alternatively, if Liposomal 
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_326734], it will only add to the economic burden on the 
health care system. 
2.1 Risk / Benefit Assessment 
The risks associated with Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_326735].  
The most common adverse events include na usea, emesis, and/or constipation and are

Version #: 9.0 Version Date: 11/5/2019 Pa ge 13 of 37 
 expected to occur in >10% of subjects.  Less common adverse events include dizziness, 
altered mental status, and hypers ensitivity reactions with urtica ria and/or pruritis.  Very 
rare, but serious adverse events  include neurologic toxicity  with seizures and apnea, 
cardiac toxicity with atriove ntricular nodal conduction abno rmalities and cardiac arrest, 
and hypersensitivity reaction with anaphylaxis.  Serious adverse events can be preventable 
with appropriate education, dos ing, and administration.  Most serious adverse events are 
found to be dose-related due to improper intr avascular injection, inappropriate dosing, or 
slow metabolic degradation in patients w ith hepatic dysfunction [6].  For more 
information regarding adve rse events, see prescribing information [2].   
To minimize risk and limit the occurrence of serious adverse events, subjects will not be 
eligible for the study if they have evidence of hepatic dysfunction.  In the operating room, 
dosing of Standard Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_326736] d upon subject weight (See Section 8.3.2).  
The medication will be administered with pr oper technique by [CONTACT_326801] a blood vessel.  
On the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_111494], continuous cardiac te lemetry will be used on all subjects and 
nursing will assess the mental status of each subject per shift.

4 STUDY DESIGN 
4.1 Study Overview 
This is a single center, d ouble-blind, randomized, active-comp arator controlled clinical 
trial.  80 subjects undergoing minimally invasi ve lung resection will be randomly assigned 
to one of two study groups: a one-time intr aoperative intercostal nerve block and wound 
infiltration by [CONTACT_326795][INVESTIGATOR_326738].  Each subject will 
receive standardized postoperative pain manage ment.  Evaluations will be taken at three-
time points - preoperative clinic visit, index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_326739], and 
postoperative clinic visit.  Scr eening data will be reviewed to  determine subject eligibility.  
Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered 
into the study.  Total duration of subject participation will be 30 days.  Total duration of 
the study is expected to be 8 months.  The treatment reg imens are outlined below.

5 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION 
5.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
 Cumulative Daily In-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_326741].  Cumulative daily in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_326742] a surrogate endpoint of 
pain and is commonly used in the literature.  It provides objective da ta that are recorded 
on every subject in the medi cation administration record. 
5.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
 Cumulative Daily In-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_326696]: 0 (no pain) – 10 (most pain)  
Pain Scores are a measure of the subject’s post operative pain that are recorded every four 
hours by [CONTACT_60397].  They are limite d by [CONTACT_423]’s pe rception of pain, 
concomitant pain medication use, and corre lation with an abstract scaling system.  
 
 Mean Time to First Opi[INVESTIGATOR_5536] (hours)  
Time to first opi[INVESTIGATOR_188793] a surrogate mark er of postoperative pain.  It is limited by 
[CONTACT_326802]. 
 
 Mean Time to Ambulation (hours)  
Time to ambulation is a downstream marker of  postoperative pain control.  Ambulation is 
limited by [CONTACT_326803] d/or physical disability. 
 
 Pulmonary Complications: Pneumonia and Atelectasis requiring Bronchoscopy (y/n)  
Pulmonary complications are a downstream ma rker of postoperative  pain control as 
subjects with chest wall postoperative pain co mmonly splint with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  Splinting is 
associated with atelectasis and pneumonia. 
 
 Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_326743] B upi[INVESTIGATOR_326744] (y/n):  
- Gastrointestinal- nausea, emesis, constipation  
- Hypersensitivity- pruritis, urticaria, anaphylaxis  
- Cardiac- atrioventricular heart block, cardiac arrest

11 ADVERSE EXPERIENCE REPO RTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
11.1 Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation of a 
patient administered a pharmaceutical product an d that does not necess arily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment.  An AE is therefore any unfavorab le and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), sy mptom or disease temporally associated 
with the administration of an investigationa l product, whether or not related to that 
investigational product.  An unexpected AE is one of a ty pe not identified in nature, 
severity, or frequency in the current Investig ator’s Brochure or of greater severity or 
frequency than expected based on the inform ation in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
The Investigator will probe, via discussion w ith the subject, for th e occurrence of AEs 
during each subject visit and record the information in the site’s source documents.  
Adverse events will be recorded in the patien t CRF.  Adverse events will be described by 
[CONTACT_24109] (start and stop dates and times), severity, outcome , treatment and relation to 
study drug, or if unrelated, the cause. 
AE Severity The National Cancer Institute’s Common Te rminology Criteria fo r Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 3.0 will be used to assess an d grade AE severity, including laboratory 
abnormalities judged to be  clinically significant.  The modified criteria can be found in the 
study manual.  If the experience is not covered in the modifi ed criteria, the guidelines 
shown in Table 1 below should be used to grade severity.  It should be pointed out that the 
term “severe” is a measure of intensity and that a severe AE is not necessarily serious. 
Kratz, Johannes R. Confidential 
 
Version #: 9.0 Version Date: 11/5/2019 Pa ge 25 of 37 
 Table 1.  AE Severity Grading 
Severity (Toxicity Grade)  Description  
Mild (1) Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention or therapy required. The subject may be aware of the sign or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well. 
Moderate (2) Mild to moderate limita tion in activity, no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required. 
Severe (3) Marked limitation in activity,  medical intervention/therapy required, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125]. 
Life-threatening (4) The subject is at risk of death due to the adverse experience as it 
occurred. This does not refer to an experience that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
 
AE Relationship to Study Drug The relationship of an AE to the study dr ug should be assessed using the following the 
guidelines in Table 2. 
Table 2.  AE Relationship to Study Drug 
Relationship 
to Drug  Comment  
Definitely Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_11125]; and that is not explained by [CONTACT_41846]. 
Probably An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected respon se pattern to the suspected drug; that is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_11125]; and that is unlikely to be explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_82978]. 
Possibly An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to that suspected drug; but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors. 
Unrelated An event that can be determined with  certainty to have no relationship to the study 
drug. 
11.2 Serious Adverse Experiences (SAE) 
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at a ny dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes: 
 death 
 a life-threatening a dverse experience 
 inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43242] 
 a persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
Kratz, Johannes R. Confidential 
 
Version #: 9.0 Version Date: 11/5/2019 Pa ge 26 of 37 
  a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other important medical even ts may also be considered an SAE when, based on 
appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardi ze the subject or requi re intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed.  
11.2.1  Serious Adverse Experience Reporting 
The study site will document all SAEs that oc cur (whether or not related to study drug) 
per UCSF CHR Guidelines .  The collection period for all SAEs will begin after informed 
consent is obtained and end after procedures fo r the final study visit have been completed. 
In accordance with the standard operating proced ures and policies of the local Institutional 
Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), the si te investigator will report 
SAEs to the IRB/IEC.   
11.3 Protocol Defined Important Medical Fi ndings Requiring Real  Time Reporting 
The following medical findings that occur will require real time reporting by [CONTACT_326812]: 
 Cardiovascular: Bradycardia,  Heart Block, Ventricular Ar rhythmia, and/or Cardiac 
Arrest requiring intervention 
 Neurologic: Seizure 
 Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis

Version #: 9.0 Version Date: 11/5/2019 Pa ge 30 of 37 
 methods to be used in reports to be consid ered by [CONTACT_4318].  Subsequent DMC meetings 
will be held to review at 1/3 and 2/[ADDRESS_403212] of the study.  Significant safety 
events may include, but are not  limited to, the following:  
 A death or life-threatening condition sustained by a pa rticipant, re gardless of 
causality  
 An unexpected serious safety issue ne wly identified duri ng the development 
program that could expose part icipants to unnecessary risks  
 Any other concern regarding particip ant safety raised by [CONTACT_326815]  
- Meeting Format  
DMC meetings will be conducted in person.  
- Voting  
DMC recommendations will be agreed upon by [CONTACT_326816].  In event of a split 
vote, the DMC Chair will cast the deciding vote.  
- Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_326772] s hould continue as planned, proceed with 
modifications, or be terminated.  The justifi cation to terminate the study may be due to the 
DMC's analysis that there is overwhelming effectiveness, futil ity, or safety issues.  If the 
DMC votes to terminate the study, a final study report will be made.  
15 STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS 
Prior to the analysis of the final study data, a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will 
be written describing all analyses that will be performed.  The SAP will contain any modifications to the analysis  plan described below.   
15.1 Data Sets Analyzed 
All eligible patients who are randomized into  the study and receive the intervention will 
be included in the analysis.  
15.2 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
The following demographic variables at screen ing will be summarized: age, gender, race 
and ethnicity, height, weight, comorbid conditions, smoking hist ory, lung function, 
indication for surgery, pr ior thoracic surgery. 
15.3 Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
Null Hypothesis: There is no difference in cumula tive in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_326773] e block and wound infiltration Liposomal 
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_326774]. 
Kratz, Johannes R. Confidential 
 
Version #: 9.0 Version Date: 11/5/2019 Pa ge 31 of 37 
 Student’s t-test will be used to assess the me ans of the cumulative total of in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_326775].  It is presumed that the data will be normally distributed.  If this 
assumption is not met, transformation or nonparametric tests (Ma nn-Whitney U test) will 
be used.  Moreover, as there are only 40 subj ects per group, it is po ssible that we do not 
achieve effective randomization.  If this occurs, we will ut ilize linear regression adjusting 
for age, sex, race, comorbidity, diagnosis, and procedure performed.  A power of 0.8 and 2-sided alpha error set at 0.05 will be used  to assess for statistical significance. 
15.4 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
 Cumulative Daily In-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_326696] (0-10)  
 Mean Time to First Opi[INVESTIGATOR_5536] (hours)  
 Mean Time to Ambulation (hours)  
 Pulmonary Complications: Pneumonia and Atelectasis requiring Bronchoscopy (y/n)  
 Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_326743] B upi[INVESTIGATOR_326744] (y/n):  
- Gastrointestinal- nausea, emesis, constipation  
- Hypersensitivity- pruritis, urticaria, anaphylaxis  
- Cardiac- atrioventricular heart block, cardiac arrest  
- Neurologic- dizziness, altere d mental status, seizure

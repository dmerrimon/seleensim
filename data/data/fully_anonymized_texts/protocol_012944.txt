1.0 Rationale and Specific Aims  
 
The purpose of this feasibility study is to obtain pi[INVESTIGATOR_664569] R01 submission (June 
2017). The goals of that submission will be to conduct a clinical trial of n -[ADDRESS_897628] higher smoking cessation rates and less 
nicotine c ravings compared to women allocated to placebo . We intend to use this preliminary data to inform a 
future randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial of n -3 LCPUFA supplementation for tobacco 
cessation.  
 
Our specific aims are:  
 
SA1: To successfully recruit and randomize 40 pregnant, current smokers into a clinical trial of n -3 LCPUFA 
supplementation.  
 
SA2: To assess the tolerability of 4 gm/day n -3 LCPUFA supplementation in pregnant, current smokers over a 
4-week period  
 
SA3: To determine the effect of 4 grams/day n -3 LCPUFA supplementation for 4 -weeks on smoking cessation 
rates, cigarettes smoked per day, and self -reported nicotine cravings in pregnant smokers  
 
2.0 Background  
 
Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable mortality and quitting s moking significantly reduces the 
risk of tobacco -related diseases (1).  Smoking is considered the most important modifiable risk factor for 
adverse pregnancy outcomes and is associated with preterm deliveries, growth restriction of infant s, pre-term 
related deaths, and sudden infant death syndrome (2-5). It is estimated that almost 11% of American women 
report smoking during pregnancy with higher rates in younger women with lower educational levels (6, 7) . 
Rates of quitting smoking during pregnancy have been  reported ranging from 35 -75% with risk factors for lack 
of quitting including lower educational status, smoking 10 or more cigarettes a day, multipar ity, and coexisting 
psychiatric problems (6-8).  For these particular high -risk individuals promoting smoking cessation can be 
challenging given concerns regarding both the safety and efficacy of currently FDA -approved pharmacologic 
treatment in pregnancy and breast feeding women.  As such, currently there are limited pharmacologic 
approaches for smoking cessation in this high risk group of pregnan t women.  The identification of safe and 
effective adjuvant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_664570] a powerful clinical  
impact on maternal -fetal health outcomes.  
 
n-[ADDRESS_897629] anti -inflammatory effects and are possibly cardio -protective (9).  We and others have found 
that red blood cell phospholipid (RBC) membrane concentrations of long -chain n -3 (LC) PUFAs (EPA and 
DHA) are significantly reduced in smokers compared to non -smokers (10-14).  The mechanisms behind this 
relative n -3 LCPUFA deficiency are not known , however , possible reasons include 1) dietary differences;  2) 
preferential lipid peroxidation of n -3 PUFA versus n -6 PUFAs; and 3) tobacco -related changes in endogenous 
n-[ADDRESS_897630] a role in behavior.  In 
animal m odels, n -3 PUFA deficiencies result in structural changes in nervous tissue which impacts 
dopaminergic and serotonergic systems and correction of these deficiencies can reverse these changes (15-
18).  In particular, n -[ADDRESS_897631] and dependence (19, 20) . Nicotine results in an elevation of dopamine in 
the nucleus accumbens which is associated with the pleasurable sensations related to nicotine use (21, 22) . 
As such, it has been hypothesized that correcting the hypofunctioning dopamine rgic system through n -3 
FORTUNE Trial  
Protocol Version 2.4, April 26, 201 7 
 
LCPUFA supplementation might reduce the symptoms of withdrawal associated with smoking cessation and 
reduce nicotine cravings (23). 
 
Recently, two small scale, double -blind, randomized control trials have found that supplementation with n -3 
LCPUFA reduces signs of nicotine dependence (24, 25) . It is important to note that neither of these studies 
recruited subjects who wished to quit smoking and at no time during either study was smoking cessation 
encouraged.  Rabinovitz randomized 50 healthy smokers to either 4750 mg of EPA + DHA per day for 30 days 
or placebo (24).  The study re ported only [ADDRESS_897632], even 30 days after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_52399], i ndividuals allocated to the n -3 
LCPUFA group reported lower levels of tobacco cravings compared to the placebo group. Zaparoli et al 
randomized 63 healthy -smokers to either 1023 mg/d EPA + DHA or placebo for 90 days (25).  Loss of follow -up 
was considerable in this study with only 62% of the participants completing the study (38% drop out).  The 
study was analyzed using an intention -to-treat design.  A statistically significant difference was seen in nicotine 
dependence between the n -3 PUFA  and placebo group with a 23% reduction in dependence score for smokers 
allocated to n -[ADDRESS_897633] in the use of fish oil supple ments in pregnancy.  A meta -analysis of 11 randomized trials of 
fish oil supplementation versus no supplementation found no differences in cognitive, language or motor 
development between the intervention and control arms. Of note, only two of these studie s provided above 2 
grams per day of n -3 LCPUFA, possible under dosing the intervention (26). In general most interventional 
studies have included few smokers and smoking  status was only assessed at baseline (27). Thus it is unclear 
how adequately dos ed n-[ADDRESS_897634] reported 
being fishy “burps” with no differences in bleeding complication s, nausea, emesis, diarrhea, or abdominal pain 
(28).  Although several expert panels recommend pregnant and lactating women to consume at least 200 to 
300 mg/day of DHA on average, no formal guidelines exist advocating the use of supplements (29, 30) .   
 
3.0 Summary of Study Plan  
 
Design  
Eligible patient s will be pregnant women who are currently smoking seen at Vanderbilt University Medical 
Center.  The study is a single -site, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel arm trial design.  The 
two arms  included one treatment arm and one placebo arm.  Treatment will be 4.2 grams/day of EPA + DHA. 
Placebo will be [ADDRESS_897635] a 
medical chart review and participants who are potentially eligible will be invited for Clinic Visit 1 (baseline).  
 
Clinic Visits  
Clinic Visit 1: After eligibility is co nfirmed, consent will be obtained. A brief medical history will be obtained. 
Participants will complete  four questionnaires.  Questionnaires will be administered by [CONTACT_664591] .  Blood , urine, and exhaled CO measurements will be collected.  
Participants will be dispensed a four-week supply of medication.  Participants will be given a pi[INVESTIGATOR_69642].

through electronic prescreening  to identify potentially eligible candidates by [CONTACT_664592], 
Research Derivative, and StarPanel  OR direct referral from the TTS OR OB or self -referra l; 2) medical record 
review  for a preliminary check of eligibility criteria; 3) initial participant contact  [CONTACT_664593], determine interest, and arrange for a face -to-face visit; 4) 
contact[CONTACT_664594]; and 5) mailing the introductory packet . 
 
4.4.1  Identification of potential participants  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Electronic prescreening  
 
Vanderbilt University Medical Center has invested heavily in infrastructure to recruit subjects for clinic al trials 
and we will utilize all of our potential resources. Potentially eligible participants will be identified through 
multiple sources.  
 
We will utilize SUBJECT LOCATOR  as a recruitment tool to identify potential research subjects based on data 
available in VU clinical systems (e.g. STAR Panel, WizOrder, Clinic Scheduling). The SUBJECT LOCATOR 
FORTUNE Trial  
Protocol Version 2.4, April 26, 201 7 
 
program is part of a toolset available through VICTR that enables teams to specify inclusion/exclusion criteria 
for a specific study. The inclusion/exclusion cr iteria are codified for computable use and combined with data 
coming through VU Clinical Systems to proactively identify individuals who might qualify for a study. Once a 
'match' is made, research study personnel are alerted using confidential messaging or  a secure web portal.  
 
We will identify pregnant women by [CONTACT_664595] 28 days as 
potential subjects. We will identify smokers by [CONTACT_664596] “cigarettes”, 
“cigarettes/day”,  “pack/day”, “ppd” within the problem list and clinical notes. We will also search using ICD -10 
codes for tobacco use disorder s (listed below ).

Search algorithm for RESEARCH DERIVATIVE :  
 
The Research Derivative is a database of clinical and related data derived from the Medical Center’s clinical 
systems and restructured for research. Data is repurposed from VU’s enterprise data warehouse, which 
includes data from StarPanel, VPI[INVESTIGATOR_46427], and ORMIS (O perating Room Management Information System), EPIC, 
Medipac, and HEO among others. The medical record number and other person identifiers are preserved 
within the database. Data types include reimbursement codes, clinical notes and documentation, nursing 
records, medication data, laboratory data, encounter and visit data, among others. Output may include 
structured data points, such as ICD [ADDRESS_897637] will include identifying individuals’ ages [ADDRESS_897638] 180 days AND with a value ≥ 1000. RD will be searched to identify individuals with upcoming clinic 
visits (any clinic).  Smoking status will be queried using the RAN/CIF forms.  Information that will be captured 
and transmitted to [CONTACT_664615] via a secure file t ransfer will include: name, MRN, phone number.

In addition, in conjunction with the ongoing inpatient Tobacco Treatment Service in VUH, [CONTACT_664616] and the 
TTS are partnering with Obstetrics providers, whose support we are enl isting to begin the process of smoking 
cessation treatment as early as possible in the pregnancy .  If the TTS identifies a  potentially eligible participant 
in performing their clinical duties they will contact [CONTACT_60306]. Murff by [CONTACT_664597]/cell (615 835 -9617 pager/615

During the identification of potential participants , study personnel will initiate a subject as a potential participant 
adding identified individuals to an Excel  database.  The datab ase will be called the Master Eligible File . The 
choice of the Excel databases it to allow for the immediate destruction of the PHI on potential participants who 
were not eligible for the study. The form will be utilized to ensure records for potential sub jects are not 
reviewed twice or a potential subject who was not interested in participating is not contact[CONTACT_664600]. The Excel 
database will document:

5.0 Agent Administration  
 
Intervention will be administered on an outpatient basis. Reported AE’s and potential risks are described in 
Section 6.2.  
 
5.1 Dose Regimen and Dose Groups  
 
The whole intervention period lasts for 4 weeks (range: 3 weeks 5 days – 4 weeks and 2 days):  
 
Control Arm: Placebo Olive oil supplement capsules 5 grams/daily in five (5) daily capsules (n=20)  
 
Expe rimental Arm: Lovaza® 4.2 grams/daily in five (5) daily capsules  (n = 20)  
 
5.2 N-3 LCPUFA Administration  
 
Lovaza® is purchased from GlaxoSmithKline (Research Triangle Park, NC) and placebo is purchased from 
Swanson Health Products (Fargo, ND). The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_17027] l purchase placebo.  The Vanderbilt Investigational 
Drug Service (IDS) will purchase Lovaza®. The Vanderbilt IDS will be responsible for the storage (controlled

room temperature 59° F – 86 ° F and under low humidity and low light), preparation of all inves tigational 
agents, and maint enance of  accurate drug storage and dispensing logs.  
 
Participants allocated to fish oil supplementation will be instructed to take five Lovaza® capsules each 
containing 465 mg of EPA and 375 mg DHA daily; this will provide a t otal daily dose of [ADDRESS_897644] been conducted in smokers to assess the effects of supplemental 
n-3 LCPUFAs on nicotine cravin gs (24, 25) . While both studies reported a statistically  significant  reduction in 
self-reported nicotine cravings in the intervention arms, a reduction in cigarettes smoked per day was only 
seen in the study of high -dose n -3 LCPUFA (> 4 grams/day) as opposed to low dose n -3 LCPUFA (1 
gram/day). These studies would suggest a dose effect and as such we are using a high -dose n -3 LCPUFA 
intervention for this pil ot study.  
 
Each participant will receive three bottles give n at a single dispensing time (Visit 1) : 
 Bottle 1 -3 labelled “Weeks 1 -4” (154 capsules).  
Bottle s 1-3 will be dispensed at Clinic Visit 1  (Baseline Visit). The prescription ( Appendix B: Visit Materials ) 
and the signed consent document (for Clinic Visit 1 only) will be faxed to the Vanderbilt IDS. The Vanderbilt 
IDS will transport the capsules to the CRC unit. Either the CRC nurse o r study staff will give the bottles to the 
participant.  Partici pants will be instructed to take the study medication with food to decrease the risk of GI 
upset and to store the medication in a refrigerator. Refrigeration of the product is to reduce the risk of 
eructation and “fishy” taste in the mouth.  The y will be i nstructed not to freeze the capsules.  To enhance 
tolerability subject will be given the following dose -escalation schedule.  
 
 Day 1: Take 2 capsules  
 Day 2: Take 3 capsules  
 Day 3: Take 4 capsules  
 Day 4: Take 5 capsule s 
Participants are allowed to take all 5  capsules at one time or in divided doses.  Participants will be advised to 
maintain the same dosing pattern over the course of the study to improve compliance.  Participants will be 
given a pi[INVESTIGATOR_664572] a visual memory aide at Clinic Visits 1 ( Appendix B: Visit Materials ).  Between Clinic 
Visits 1 to 2 and 2 to 3, subjects will receive a single telephone reminder to encourage  medication compliance 
using a standardized telephone script ( Appendix C: Telephone/Email Reminder Scripts ).  This message 
can be left either on a voice mail or with a different household member if the participant allows. In addition, 
alternative message options (email communications) will be allowed for medication and visit reminders if the 
participant indica tes these as their preferred method of communication.  Standardized telephone  and email 
reminders are in Appendix C: Telephone/Email Reminder Scripts . 
 
If the participant is unable to stay at the clinic to receive the capsules  or run out of study medicatio n before the 
final visit can be scheduled , the pharmacist at the Vanderbilt IDS will mail the capsules via FedEx within one 
business day of the Clinic Visit. Research staff will follow -up with a phone call to the participant to ensure 
receipt of the study agent.

7.6 Methods for Clinical Procedures  
 
Blood Sample Collection Procedure  
Blood samples will be collected at all Clinic Visits. Blood will be dra wn into one EDTA tube (all 3 visits), one 
heparin tube for plasma  (visit 1 only),  and one red top tube for long term storage (visit 1 and visit 3 only).  
  
End-Exhaled CO Procedure  
Participants will be advised to hold their breath for 15 seconds before blowing in the device .  The results of the 
device will be recorded into the REDCap da tabase.  
 
Collection of Oral Flora  
Participants will be advised swish 1 -2 tablespoons of Scope (or generic equivalent) in their mouth for 5 
seconds and then spit into a specimen collection container. This sample will be transported to the Molecular 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_664577].  
 
 
8.0 Criteria for Evaluation and Endpoint Determination  
 
8.1 Primary Endpoint  
 
The primary outcome will be reduction in total number of cigarettes per day from baseline to 4 -weeks.  
 
8.2 Secondary Endpoint  
 
The secondary outcome s will include: 1) reduction in the Fagerström Tolerance Questionnaire and 2) point 
prevalence abstinence at 4 weeks biochemically confirmed by [CONTACT_124702] -expi[INVESTIGATOR_33514].  
 
Safety and tolerability outcomes will include: 1) reported AEs and 2) the rate of d iscontinuation of study 
medication due to side effects . 
 
8.3 Off-Agent Criteria  
 
Participants may stop taking the study agent for the following reasons:  
 
1) Individuals who reports minor GI symptoms such as dyspepsia, heartburn or diarrhea who do 
not wish to remain on trial  
2) Noncompliance with study agent  
3) Medical contraindication  
 
Participants who go off -agent will be withdrawn from the study  
 
8.4 Off-Study Criteria

Protocol Version 2.4, April 26, 201 7 
 
RBC phospholipid membrane fatty acid analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_664607] -Lipid Lab ([CONTACT_664617], Director).  
 
Nicotine and tobacco metabolites will be determined using the VUMC Clinical Laboratories (ARUP).  
 
Blood specimens will be processed within the CRC and stored in the -80°C freezers in the Molecular 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_664578] ([CONTACT_651314], Director).  
 
Oral microbiome specimens will be processed in the Molecular Epi[INVESTIGATOR_664578] ([CONTACT_664618], Director).  
 
 
9.2 Collection and Handling Procedur es 
 
End-Expi[INVESTIGATOR_664579] (Bedfont Instruments) to assess end -expi[INVESTIGATOR_33514]. Participants 
will be advised to hold their breath for 15 seconds before blowing in the device.  Output is in CO ppm  and hb% . 
Subjects self -reporting abstinence may have smoking status confirmed biochemically using end expi[INVESTIGATOR_33516].   Biochemically validated abstinence will be defined as end expi[INVESTIGATOR_664580] 10 
ppm.  
 
Serum Cotinine and 3 -hydroxycotin ine  
Nicotine metabolites will be measured using an isotope dilution -high performance liquid chromatography/ 
atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry using a commercially available testing 
center. The assay requires 1.5 ml of serum .  Serum cotinine has an advantage over end -expi[INVESTIGATOR_664581] a greater period of abstinence detecting nicotine exposure for up to 14 days as opposed to 12 -24 
hours for expi[INVESTIGATOR_33559] . 
 
Urine  nicotine and metabolites testing   
Nicotine metabolites will be measured using a quantitative liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry 
using a commercially available testing center. The assay requires 4 ml of urine.   The assay measures 3 -
hydroxycotine, anabasine, cotinine, nicotine and nornicotine.  
 
Determination of RBC Phospholipid Fatty Acid Analysis  
Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_664582] -Lees (113).  Fatty acid methyl esters are identified by 
[CONTACT_664608].  Inclusion of the internal standard, dipentadecanoyl 
phosphatidylcholine (C15:0), permits quantitation of phospholipid amount in the sample.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_897653] to be drawn into a serum, heparin, and EDTA.  
Blood samples will be collected at study baseline (wee k 0) (12 ml -three tubes), the study midpoint (week 2) 
(4ml-one tube)  and the end of the study (week 4) (8 ml -two tubes) .  Collected blood will be used for the

Required Phlebotomy Materials:  
o Tourniquet  
o Non-latex disposable  gloves  
o Evacuated Tubes  
o 70% alcohol pads  
o [ADDRESS_897654] or tabletop.  
o Assess the patient’s veins to determine the best puncture sit e.  Observe the skin for the vein’s 
blue color, or palpate the vein for a firm rebound sensation.  
o Tie a tourniquet 2” proximal to the area chosen.  If the tourniquet fails to dilate the vein, have the 
patient open and close his fist repeatedly.  Then ask h im to close his fist as you insert the 
needle and to open it again when the needle is in place.  
o Clean the venipuncture site with an alcohol pad using friction for [ADDRESS_897655] longer, but always remove it before withdrawing the needle.  
o Continue to fill the req uired tubes, removing one and inserting another.  Gently rotate each tube 
as you remove it to help mix the additive.  Order of fill is lavender/green/red  
o After you’ve drawn the sample, place a gauze pad over the puncture site, and slowly and gently 
remove t he needle from the vein.  When using an evacuated tube, remove it from the needle 
holder to release the vacuum before withdrawing the needle from the vein.  
o Apply gentle pressure to the puncture site for [ADDRESS_897656] syringes, needles, and used gloves in the appropriate containers.  
 
Special Considerations  
o If the patient has large, distended, highly visible veins, perform venipuncture without a 
tourniquet to minimize the risk of hematoma  
o If the patient has a clotting disorder or is receiving anticoagulant therapy, maintain firm pressure 
on the venipuncture site for no less  than 5 minutes after withdrawing the needle to prevent 
formation of a hematoma.  
Blood processing  
o Blood specimens will be stored in CRC refrigerator.  
o All specimen’s will be labeled with date, participant ID #, study title , visit number,  and PI [CONTACT_2300]

Urine  sample allocation  
o Prior to long term storage in -80°C urine will be aliquoted into [ADDRESS_897658] uncommon and generally trivi al 
side effects.  In 1997 the Food and Drug Administration rules that an intake of up to 3 g/day of marine omega -3 
fatty acids are Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) (135)   (http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA -
IMPACT/2002/February/Day -26/i4327.htm ). This ruling specifically considered the possible effects of fish oil on 
bleeding time, glycemic control, and LDL cholesterol.  Fish oil supplements have been used in several large 
randomized controlled studies of cardiac patients. (136)  In some trials doses as high as 12 g/d for durations of 
[ADDRESS_897659] been well tolerated. (137)   In addition, fish oil supplements have been used in over X randomized 
controlled studies of pregnant wom en and are well tolerated. The most common side effect of fish oil is a fishy

Adverse Event Attribution  Guidelines  
The possibility that the AE is related to the study agent will be classified as one of the following: not related, 
unlikely, possible, probable, definite.  
 
10.2 Serious Adverse Events  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that  
1) Results in death  
2) Is life-threatening  
3) Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_664585] 2.4, April 26, 201 7 
 
4) Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
5) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.   
Plan for unanticipated AE reporting  
SAEs and unanticipated AEs will be reported immediately by [CONTACT_664610]  
(Chasiety Turner HS#1) .  An Adverse Event Report form will be complete d and retu rned to the VU IRB within 2 
working days.  
 
Plan for annual reporting of AEs  
Annual reports are submitted to the VU IRBs and will contain a) the number of adverse events and an 
explanation of how each event was handled, b) the number of complaints and how e ach complaint was 
handled, c) the number of subject withdrawals and an explanation of why the subject withdrew or was 
withdrawn, and d) the number of protocol violations and how each was handled.  
 
11.0 Study Monitoring  
 
11.1 Data Management  and Security  
 
Confidentiality and ethical considerations will be addressed as follows.  All identifying documents, data and 
specimens collected as a result of this study will be retained by [CONTACT_093].  Access to this material will be 
available only to the researc h investigator and his staff.  Paper (hard) copi[INVESTIGATOR_664586] 
a locked file cabinet.  Electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_664587] a password protected database on a 
secured server.  If results of this study are to be published,  only code numbers will be used for identification.  
Participants will not be identified by [CONTACT_2300].  
 
11.2 Case Report Forms  
 
Participant data will be collected using protocol -specific case report forms (CRFs) in REDCap. All CRFs will be 
approved by [CONTACT_664611]. Study staff will enter data into the electronic research record either 
directly.  The primary source of data collection and storage will be REDCap.  REDCap offers a secure, 
password -protected web -based record..  
 
11.[ADDRESS_897660] or permission -based access. All identifying 
information will be removed and/or deleted from the participant records at [ADDRESS_897661] (HIPAA), Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) and the 
Vanderb ilt IRB regulations and guidelines.

FORTUNE Trial  
Protocol Version 2.4, April 26, 201 7 
 
12.1 Study Design/Description  
 
The study is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel arm trial design.  The two arms include 
one treatment arm and one placebo arm.  Treatment will be 4.2 grams/day of E PA + DHA. Placebo will be [ADDRESS_897663] not powered the study to account for drop -
outs 
 
12.2 Randomization  
 
The study includes two groups and randomization in permuted blocks.  Randomization will be stratified based 
on daily cigarette use (≤5 cigarettes per day/> 5 cigarettes per day).  
 
12.[ADDRESS_897664] -
intervention cigarettes per day, we will perform a Wilcoxon (Mann Whitney) rank sum test evaluated at a 5% 
significance level.  This data analysis plan will be carried out  using statistical software SAS® (Cary, North 
Carolina) or statistical package R ( R Development Core Team, 2008 ).  
 
For our primary outcome we will compare the change in total number of cigarettes smoked per day from 
baseline to 4 -weeks.  We will compare the change outcome at 4 -weeks between arms using logistic regression 
using repeated measured ANOVA.  
 
For our primary outcome, if we assume a baseline number of cigarettes per day of 11 with a SD of 5 (34), we 
should be able to detect a reduction by 41% in cigarettes  per day in smokers allocated to the n -3 LCPUFA arm 
compared to placebo with 80% power.  
 
12.5 Secondary Objective, Endpoint(s), Analysis Plan  
 
Secondary outcomes include : change in the Fagerström Tolerance Questionnaire  and point prevalence 
abstinence at 4 week s biochemically confirmed by [CONTACT_124702] -expi[INVESTIGATOR_33514].  We will compare the change 
outcome at 4 -weeks between arms using logistic regression using repeated measured ANOVA.  
 
The Fagerström Tolerance Questionnaire is on a 10 -point Likert scale. Estimating  a baseline score of 7.3 ± 
1.6(35) we have 80% power to detect a difference of [ADDRESS_897665] used n -3 LCPUFA supplementatio n in pregnant women who are interested in 
quitting. We estimate a 50% abstinence rate in all comers. With [ADDRESS_897666] 24%

the study from the Vanderbilt IRB. Should changes to the study become necessary, protocol amendment will 
be submitted according to VUMC guidelines.  
 
13.2 Informed Consent  
 
All potential study participants will be given a copy of the IRB -approved Informed Consent to review. The 
Investigator will explain all aspects of the study in lay language and answer all questions regarding the study. If 
the participant decides to participate in the study, she will be asked to sign and date the Informed Consent 
document. The study agent will not be released to a participant who has not signed the Informed Consent 
document. Subjects who refuse to participate or who withdra w from the study will be treated withou t prejudice.  
 
13.3 Other  
 
This trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and the applicable 
regulatory requirements  
 
13.4 Financing, Expenses, and/or Insurance  
 
Participants will be compensated $ 225 for participation (i.e. Clinic Visit 1 $ 75, Clinic Visit 2 $ 75, Clinic Visit 3 
$75) if all the procedures are completed. This is to compensate for any financial cost due to travel and the 
inconvenience of blood draws. The participant compe nsation plan will be pro -rated based on the number of 
study visits completed. Participants who complete the entire study will receive a total of $ 225. Participants will 
sign the Reimbursement Form ( Appendix B: Study Visit Forms ) which will be submitted to the Division of 
General Internal Medicine and Public Health for processing.  Subjects will be told to expect  at least 2 -4 weeks 
for payment.

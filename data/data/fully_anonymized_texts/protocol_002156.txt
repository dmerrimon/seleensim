Version 2.0, 26April 2019
The primary  reasons for am ending this protocol are to:
Delete peak Forced Expi [INVESTIGATOR_21581] 1 Second (FEV 1) from the secondary  
efficacy  endpoints as it was added in error and this endpo int is not m easured .
Update the study  period.
Update the inclusio n criteria to include only pat ients wi th body  mass index 
(BMI) ≤35.
Delete the expected number of patients in the [LOCATION_002] (US) versus non -US 
sitesas the number o f patients in the US sites might be less than originally  
planned .
Removeinterim futilit y analysis as it is determined no interim futilit y analysis is 
to be conducted. Patient recruit ment into the study  has been faster than planned 
and all pat ients are expected to be enro lled before the time po int at whi ch the 
interim analysis was planned to be completed. Many  patients will also have 
completed treatm ent at that timepo int. The value of the fut ility analysis has 
therefore been determined to be limited.
Incorporate the updated Hy’s Law (Version 2.0, dated 10 January  2019) in the 
Clinical Study  Protocol  Appendix D .
All changes made to specific sect ions in the protocol were also implemented elsewhere in 
the protocol and in the synopsis, where applicable. Major changes to the protocol are

International Co -ordinating Investigator
  
Study centre (s) and number of patient s planned
It is planned that approximately 714 patientswith asthma symptom atic on low dose inhaled 
corticosteroi d (ICS)will be rando mised into the study, 102 patients per arm.
The study  will be conducted in approximately 100 centres in 8 countri esin Europe, United 
States (US) , South Africa, and Japan.
Study period Phase of development
Estimated date of first patient enrolled Q12019 Phase 2b
Estimated date of last patient completed Q32019 Phase 2b
Study design
This is a rando mised, pl acebo -controlled, double -blind study  with an open -labelactive 
comparator ICS (fluticasone furoate [FF])arm to assess the efficacy and safet y of AZD7594
administered once daily (QD) by [CONTACT_487403] a 12-week treatment 
period to pati ents wi thasthma symptom atic on low dose ICS.
The primary  object ive is to determine the efficacy of AZD7594 as assessed by [CONTACT_487404][INVESTIGATOR_4034] 1second (FEV 1)at Week 12, when compared 
to placebo ,with the aim o f select ing doses to advance to Phase 3 studi es.Secondary  efficacy 
assessments include asthma control  questi onnai re (ACQ -5), fractional exhaled nitric oxide 
(FENO),forced vital capacit y (FVC), peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_11311] (PEF), rescue medicat ion use, 
night -time awakenings ,daily  asthma symptom s as recorded in an electroni c diary  (eDiary) , 
and “CompE x”, a com posite endpoint for severe exacerbat ions of asthma which combines
severe exacerbat ionsand d iary events (ie, combinati on of  eDiary  variables) .
Other secondary  object ives of the study include the descript ion of the (steady  state) 
pharmacokinet ics (PK) and the pharmacodynamics (assessment of cortiso l suppression) of 
AZD7594 in a subset of patients. Only selected sites that are capable of doing qualit y PK (and

8(122)cortisol) sampling will part icipate i n the PK subset. The safet y and tol erabilit y of AZD7594 
will also be evaluated in relat ion to pl acebo.
Exploratory  objectives will include the use of Forced Oscillat ion Technique (FOT) (as a 
measure of small airways invo lvement ) for pati ents in the U S and Eu rope, a genomics (Gx) 
analysis .
The study  will consist of a Run-inPeriod(Visits 1 to 3) , a Treatment Period (Visits 4 to 7) and 
a Follow -up Contact (Visit 8) .
In addit ion, all patients will be provided a short -acting beta 2agonis t (SABA )
(salbutamo l/albuterol) as rescue medicat ionfor use throughout the run-in and treatm ent 
periods.
All patient s will sign informed consent form (ICF) prior to parti cipat ing in any study -specific 
procedures .
The Run-in Period will t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_31228] 21 -28 day s (up to a m aximum of 35 days , if Visi t3 is 
repeated )and will consist of 3 visits: a Screening Visit (Visit 1), a Reversibilit y Visit (Vi sit 2) 
and a Rando misat ion Visit (Visit 3) . Patients found to be eligible at Visit 1 (Screening Visit)
will discont inue all asthma medicat ions and switch to low dose budesonide (200 µg twice a 
day [BID]in Europe and 180 µg BID in US) and rescue medicat ion will be taken as needed. 
Visit1 (Screening Visit) and Visit 2can occur the same day, unless the patient is taking a 
long-acting beta agonist (LABA), fixed dose combinat ion ICS/LABA treatment or a 
long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), in which case the patient will return for Visit 2
between 2 to 7 day s after Vi sit1to allow sufficient time to wash -out thei r asthma 
medicat ions.
Visit 2 will  occur wi thin 7 days of Visit 1 and will assess reversibilit y (increase of FEV 1
≥12% and ≥200 mL after administration of a short -acting bronchodilator). All pat ients should 
refrain from taking SABA for 6 hours prior to reversibilit y testing. If a pati ent does not m eet 
reversibilit y criteria, Vi sit 2can be repeated once within 1 week. If reversibilit ycriteria are 
not achieved at the repeat attempt, the patient will bediscont inued from the study .
If reversibilit y criteria are m et at Visit 2, patients will proceed to Visit 3 . Randomisat ion will 
occur at Visit 3, within 21 to 28 day s of Visit 1. At Visit 3,patients who remain symptomat ic 
while on low dose budesonide (as assessed by [CONTACT_487405] > 1over the 
previous 7 days or use of a SA BA on ≥3 day s of the previous 7 days) and m eet FEV 1criteria 
(≥40% to ≤90% predicted at either −45 or −15 minutes pre -dose) will be rando mised to one o f 
7possible treatment arms (see below). If patients do not meet eligibilit y (especially  symptom  
criteria or lung funct ion criteria),Visit 3 can be repeated once within 1 week. If this occurs, 
additional budesonide may  need to be provi ded to the pati ent to ensure that the patient has 
run-in medicat ion (budesonide) available throughout the run -in period.
Patients who are uncontrolled duri ng the Run -in Peri od (as per an ACQ -5 score of ≥3 or daily  
rescue medication(SABA) use of ≥12 puffs for ≥ 3 consecutive days) or those wi th <80%

Sample Siz e Determination
Approximately  102 patients will be rando mised to each arm ( overall randomisat ion rati o 
1:1:1:1:1:1:1 )in order to ensure at least [ADDRESS_626390] 80% power to detect a difference in the primary endpo int, ie, a difference of 
175mL in change fro m baseline in trough FEV 1at Week [ADDRESS_626391] imated 15% dropout rate. The targeted total number 
of patients to be randomised is approximately  714patients.
Interim futility analysis 
Not applicable .
Primary efficacy analysis
The primary  variable is the change fro m baseline in trough FEV 1at Week 12 .Baseline for 
FEV 1will be defined as the mean of the 2 measured values fo r the cor responding variable 
(2measurements 30 minutes apart, at −45 minutes and −15 minutes, before IP administration), 
on Day  1. Trough will be defined as the mean of the 2 FEV 1measurements 30 minutes apart 
([ADDRESS_626392] dose). 
The change from baseline in trough FEV 1will be analysed using a MMRM wit h treatment, 
visit, treatment by  [CONTACT_487409] (US, Japan, and Rest of the World[RoW] ) as 
fixed effects, and baseline FEV 1and baseline FEV 1by [CONTACT_487410]. The within-patient correlation will be modelled using the unstructured covariance 
matri x. The Kenward -Roger approximat ion will be used to estimate denominator degrees of 
freedo m.The m ain co mpar isons will be between each AZD7594 dose and placebo at 
Week 12.The comparison between active co mparator (FF) and placebo will be used for bench 
marking.
To control  type I error rate for the primary  efficacy endpo int comparisons at Week 12, a 
sequent ial hierarchical step -down approach will be used. This approach starts from testing the 
highest dose versus placebo first, using a two -sided alpha of 0.05. If this p -value is ≤0.[ADDRESS_626393] p -value >0.[ADDRESS_626394] 
dose versus placebo is tested.
The primary  analysis will be based on the full analysis set (FAS) population and addit ionally  
for sensi tivity purposes on the per protocol (PP) populat ion. Further subgroup analyse s will  be 
done to evaluate treatment effects for trough FEV 1at Week 12.

The fo llowing variables are secondary  efficacy  variables:
Change from baseline in trough FEV 1at Week s2, 4, 8, and average over the treatment 
period
Change from baseline in FENOat Week s2, 4, 8, 12, and average over the treatment 
period(analysis to be done on natural log -scale and resul ts back -transform ed to linear 
scale)
Change from baseline in trough FVC at Week 12 and average over the treatment 
period
Change from baseline in ACQ -5 at Week 12 and average over the treatment period
Change from baseline in average m orning PEF over the treatment period
Change from baseline in average e vening PEF over the treatment period
Change from baseline in averag e daily use of rescue medicat ion over the treatment 
period
Change from baseline in percent night -time awakening days over the treatment period
Change from baseline in average daily asthma symptom score over the treatment 
period
Change from baseline in percentasthm a control  days over the treatm ent peri od
Change from baseline in percent rescue -free days over the treatment period
Change from baseline in percent symptom -free days over the treatment period
Time to first CompEx event, time to recurrent CompEx ev ent, and Com pEx event rate
Similar mixed models for repeated measures as for the primary  variable will be used for the 
analysis at specified visit week. Analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA )with treatm ent and regi on 
(ie, US, Japan, and RoW ) as fixed effects, and baseline as covariate will be used for the 
analysis of aver age over the treatment period. No mult iplicit y adjust ments will be applied for 
the secondary  variables .
Com pEx will be analy sed with a Cox proporti onal hazards m odel, a m arginal  means/rates 
model, and a n egative bino mial model for time to first event, time to recurrent event, and 
event rate (due to observat ion time per patient) respectively, with region and treatment 
included as covariates in all models .

15(122)PK analysis
Sampling for PK analysis will be done in a subset of patients. Steady  state PKparam eters of 
AZD7594 will be derived using non -compart mental methods with Phoenix®WinNonlin® 
Versi on 6.[ADDRESS_626395] ics will be presented: n, 
geom etric mean, geom etric coefficient of variat ion, arithmetic m ean, ari thmet ic standard 
deviat ion (SD), m edian, minimum and maximum based on the PK analysis set. Plasma 
concentrations that are below lower limit of quant ificat ionwill be handled as described in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP).
Combined i ndividual  plasma concentrati on per dose l evel (spaghetti  plots) will be presented in 
linear and semi -logarithmic scale with separate plots for each dose level.
Figures for the geometric mean concentration -time data will be presented for all doses 
overl aid on the sam e plot, in both a linear and semi -logarithmic scale.
Addit ional graphical presentations of PK data may be added at the discretion of the PK 
scientist. More details will be provided in the SAP.
All plasma PK parameters will be listed for each pati ent and summarised by [CONTACT_487411]. For t max only n, median, minimum  and maximum will be 
reported.
Data from pat ients excluded fro m the PK analysis set will be included in the data list ings, but 
not in the descriptive stat istics or in the inferential statist ics.
Dose proporti onalit y of AZD7594 on Week 12 (Day  84) will  be assessed graphically  and 
analysed using the power model approach with the natural logarithm of PK parameters ( Css,max
and AUC τ)as the dependent variable and the l ogari thm of the dose as the independent 
variable.

28 (122 )1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study
AZD7594 is a non-steroi dal, potent and sel ective m odulator of the gl ucocorti coid receptor 
(GR) under development for once daily (QD) inhaled treatment of chronic obstructive 
pulmo nary disease (COPD) and asthma .
Inhaled corticosteroi ds(ICSs) are the cornerstone of the rapy for asthm a patients of all severit y 
levels .The Gl obal Initiative for Asthma (GINA) 2018guidelines (GINA , 201 8), as well as the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) guideline on the clinical investigation of medicinal 
products for the treatment of asthma ( CHMP/EWP/2922/01 Rev.1 , 2015 )recommend ICS as 
first-line treatment for all asthmat ic patients requi ring regul ar anti -inflammatory  therapy .ICS 
have been shown to improve symptom control, lung funct ion and qualit y of life; reduce 
exacerbations, asthma -related hospi [INVESTIGATOR_487355] .However, ICS have known 
side-effects wi th long-term use. Therefore, a GR agonist with a better therapeutic index 
(balance between desired and undesired effects) than current ly available ICSs couldimprove 
the available treatment options for asthma patients.
The GRis a well -known target and there is extensive clinical experience with GR agonists 
used asICSs .Besides co mmo n local adverse react ions such as hoarseness and oral 
candidiasis, which are inconvenient for the patient but not of a serious nature, GR agonists 
have the potential to cause systemic side -effects such as effects on the hypothalamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-
adrenal (HPA) axis and effects on bone mineral densit y and (in children) growth velocit y.
These systemic effects are rare, and generally related to long -term treatment wi th high doses
(Christensson , 2008 ).
AZD7594 is a non -steroi dalGR m odulator andmay have several potential benefits over 
convent ional ICS .Non-clinical pharmaco logy studies in the Sephadex rat model, known to 
provi de reasonable est imates of the relative potency o f GR agonists inhumans, indicate that 
the therapeutic index may be improved for AZD7594 compared with current ly marketed 
inhaled stero idal GR agonists such as flut icasone propi [INVESTIGATOR_16847] .The high select ivity of 
AZD7594 for the GRover other steroid nuclear hormone receptors and the high degree of 
plasma protein binding (>99%) could also theoretically be beneficial .
AZD7594 has a predi cted 24-hour duration of its effect that coul d improve convenience, and ,
potenti ally adherence to prescribed treatment, an acknowledged challenge in current COPD 
and asthma management .
Theaim is to develop AZD7594 as a once daily  inhaled non-steroi dalselect ive GR modulator
(SGRM) , whi ch may  ultimately  lead to better di sease control of both COPD and asthma 
through improved efficacy and compliance. The overall rat ionale for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a once daily  
AZD7594 in adry powder inhaler (DPI) is to provide a safe and e ffective future treatment 
option for both asthm a and COPD pati ents.

29 (122 )1.[ADDRESS_626408] acebo after a 12 -week treatment period in pat ients with asthma 
symptom atic on low dose ICS. The comparison between placebo and an active comparator 
(fluticasone furoate [FF]) will be used for bench marking. AZD7594 (steady  state) 
pharmacokinet ics (PK) of the multiple dose levelsof AZD7594 will be assessed in a subset of 
patients .In addition, 24-h ourplasma cortiso l sampling will be carried out to assess cortiso l 
suppressio n as a measure of HPA axis suppressio n, a well -known class -effect of inhaled ICS
(Dahl, 2006 ; Wlodarczyk et al , 2008 ).The target populat ion inclu des male and female 
patients, aged 18 to 85years with body  mass index (BMI) ≤35, with a clinical diagnosis of 
asthma as per the criteria of the GINA 201 8and EMA guidelines ( GINA , 201 8) 
(CHMP/EWP/2922/01 Rev.1 , 2015 ) who are symptomat ic on lowdose ICS and demonstrate 
bronchodilator reversibilit y (increase of trough forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_4034] 1 second [ FEV 1]
≥12% and ≥200 mL after administration of a short -acting bronchodilator) .
A placebo -controlled, double -blinded design has been chosen to limit the occurrence of 
conscious and unconscious bias in the conduct and interpre tation of  theclinical study  arising 
from the influence thatthe knowl edge of treatm ent may  have on the recrui tment and 
allocat ion of pat ients.It is considered the optimal approach according to Int ernational C ouncil  
forHarm onisat ion (ICH) E9 “Statistical principles in clinical studi es”.The active comparator 
(FF) will be open -label. An overall 1:1:1:1:1:1:[ADDRESS_626409] ics of the treatment 
groups will be minimised. FF was chosen as an active co mparator at the recommendat ion of
the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )because of the once daily  dosing, and the need to 
demonstrate efficacy .
The inclusio n of a placebo arm is considered the most reliable method to minimise pat ient and 
Invest igator bias according to ICH E10 “ Choice of control group in clinical trials ”, 
ICH/364/96 guideline adopted by [CONTACT_487415] (CPMP), 
CPMP/EWP/562/98 and the FDA. The use of placebo is also recommended by [CONTACT_487416] -finding studies for moderate- severe asthma.
The proposed dose levels o f AZD75 94 in this study  range f rom 50µg to 720 µg QD
(delivered dose) .Doses have been selected based on the safety , tolerabili ty, PK, and 
pharmacodynamics informat ion generated in previous AZD7594 clinical studie s.Three 
AZD7594 dose levels (58 µg, 250 µg and 8 00µg [delivered doses]) have been tested in a 
2week incomplete block crossover study  in asthmatic pat ients.There was a clear dose

highest effect obse rved in the [ADDRESS_626410] dose (720 µg) is predicted to be <10%. 
The proposed dose levelsshoul d adequately  cover the therapeutic dose range .
For further details, refer to the Invest igator’s Brochure (IB).
1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment
Patients parti cipating in the early  clinical  studi es of AZD7594 will obtain no individual 
benefit from their participat ion in the studies .The aim o f the early studi es is to enable further 
investigat ions in pat ients to evaluate and develop AZD7594 as a once daily  select ive inhaled 
GR m odulator f or treatm ent for COPD and asthma, with an acceptable side -effect profile 
compared to inhaled GR agonists already on the market.
Data havebeen gathered from previous clinical experience wit h GR agonists, non -clinical 
safet y pharmaco logy and toxi cology studi es and clinical studies wit h AZD7594 .The GR is a 
well-known target and there is extensive clinical experience wit h GR agonists use a s ICSs .
The side -effect profile of inhaled GR agonists is well -known and consists of local effects 
including oropharyngeal candidiasis, dysphonia and cough, as well as systemic effects such as 
skin thinning and bruising, endocrine/metabo lic effects (includ ing HPA suppression), 
osteoporosi s and (in children) reduced growth velo city(Dahl, 2006). Pneumonia has also been 
noted wi th ICS use, especially  in patients with severe COPD (GOLD, 2017 ).Although 
AZD7594 is not a steroid, given the shared target, theside-effect profile is potentially similar . 
In preclinical studi es,AZD7594 displayed features ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_171394] a potent GR agonist . Findings in 
humans can be monitored and are expected tobe reversible .In the clinical studies conducted 
to date, AZD7594 was generally safe and well tolerated, though HPA suppressio n was seen at 
inhaled delivered doses higher than [ADDRESS_626411] no findings 
of concern that would preclude proposed clinical studies with inhaled administration of 
AZD7594 .Intravenous and oral dosing o f AZD7594 (single doses) are also supported by  [CONTACT_487418].
The developme nt of any AE, abnormalit y in laboratory  variables or any  other safet y variables 
will be closely  monitored and evaluated on an ongoing basis during the clinical studies. Data 
from patients and healthy vo lunteers involved in the current and future AZD7594 clinical  
studi es will be m onitored f or electrocardiogram ( ECG ), spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (only  in pat ients with 
asthma or COPD), clinical chemistry , vital signs, adverse events ( AEs)andPK.To further 
investigate the effect of AZD7 [ADDRESS_626412] acebo arm .The use of the placebo arm may  increase the ri sk of

studi es. This approach has previously been used safely  in moderate -to-severe asthma 
popul ations to study  the efficacy  of FF(Bleeker et al , 2012 and Busse et al , 2012 ).
Patients enrolled in the trial will be requested to take pro tocol -defined asthma medicat ions 
only.All pat ients will be provided with a short -acting beta 2agonist (SABA) 
(salbutamo l/albuterol) to be used as rescue medication throughout the run-in and treatm ent 
periods. Although som epatientmay have an increased risk of deterioration based on a 
decrease in their total inhaled steroid dose, this risk will be minimi sed by [CONTACT_487419], 
symptom  reporting, and contact [CONTACT_487420]. The Investigators will carefully 
monitor the patients throughout the study , and evidence of asthma progression (through study  
visits and eDiary  recordings of lung funct ion, symptom score, and rescue inhaler use ), will 
trigger an alert to the local clinician as well as the medical mo nitor. Patients wh ose asthma is 
not con trolled on l owdose ICS during the Run -in Period will be discontinued fro m the study , 
and pat ients are free to withdraw from participation in the study  at any  time. Upon com pletion 
of the study , pati ents are not restri cted in the choic e of medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

comparator ICS (FF)arm to assess the e fficacy and safet y of AZD7594 administered QDby 
[CONTACT_487421] a 12-week treatment period to patients with asthma
symptom atic on low dose ICS.
The study  will be conducted in approximately 100 centres in 8 countri es in Europe, United 
States (US) , South Africa, and Japan. It is planned that approximately 714 patients will be 
rando mised into the study , 102 patients per arm .The total durati on of  the study  will be 
between 113 to 135days for each individual pat ientand is planned to run approximately
12months(it should not exceed 18 months).

[CONTACT_487422][INVESTIGATOR_4034] 1second (FEV 1)at Week [ADDRESS_626414] ing doses to advance to P hase 3 studi es.
All patients will sign an informed consent form (ICF) prior to participat ing in any 
study -specific procedures. 
The study  will consist of a Run -in Period (Visits 1 to 3) , a Treatment Period (Visits 4 to 7) and 
a Follow -up Contact (Visit 8) (Figure 1). All pat ients will be provided budesonide for the 
run-in period, a SABA ( salbutam ol/albuterol ) as rescue m edicati onfor use throug hout the 
run-in and treatment periods and will be randomly  assigned to AZD7594, FF, or placebo 
during the treatment period. Patients will record daily symptoms, peak flow, and rescue 
medicat ion use in eDiaries.

and ≥200mL after administration o f a short -acting bronchodilator) , a Rando misat ion Visit 
within 21 to 28 day s of Visit 1 (Visit3).
Patients found to be eligible at Visit 1 will discont inue all asthma medications and switch to 
low dose budesonide (200 µg twice a day  [BID]in Europe and 180 µg BID in US) and rescue 
medicat ion will be taken as needed .Visit1(Screening Visit) and Visit 2can occur the same 
day, unless the pati ent is taking medication that precludes reversibilit y testing, including 
long-acting beta agoni st (LABA) , fixed dose combinat ion ICS/LABA treatment orlong-acting 
muscarinic antagoni st (LAMA), in which case the patient will return for Visit 2 between 2 to 
7days after Vi sit1,to allow sufficient time to wash -out thei r asthma m edicati ons.
All patients should refrain fro m taking SABA 6 hours pri or to reversibilit y testing .If a patient 
does not m eet reversibilit y criteria, Visit 2can be repeated once within 1week .If 
reversibilit ycriteria are not achi eved at the repeat attempt, the patient will be discontinued 
from the study .

budesonide (as assessed by [CONTACT_487405] >1over the previous 7 days or use of 
a SABA on ≥3 days of the previous 7 days) and meet FEV 1criteria ( ≥40% to ≤90% predicted
at either −45 or −15 minutes pre -dose) will be randomised to one of 7 possible treatment arms
(see below) .If pat ients do not meet eligibilit y (especi ally symptom  criteria or l ung function 
criteria) , Visit 3 can be repeated once within 1 week. If this occurs, addit ional budesonide may  
need to be provided to the patient to ensure that the patient has run -in medicat ion (budesonide) 
available throug hout the run -in period.

WOCBPshoul d be stable on their chosen method of highly  effect ive birth control for a 
minimum o f 3months pri or to Visit 1 , and willing to use this for the ent ire duration of  
the study  (from the time they  sign the inform ed consent), and for [ADDRESS_626426] ive methods of birth control are defined as those which result in a low failure rate 
(ie, less than 1% per y ear) when used consistent ly and correctly. These include:
Female sterilisat ion (ie, docum ented bilateral  tubal ligat ion)
Horm onal methods of contraception associated with inhibit ion of ovulation 
(including levonorgestrel intrauterine system [eg, Mirena™], 
medroxyprogesterone injections [eg, Depo Provera™], etonogestrel implants [eg, 
Implanon™, Norplan™], normal and low dose combined oral pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], 
norel gestromin/ethinylestradiol transdermal system, intravaginal device [eg, 
ethinylestradio l and etonogestrel], an d desogestrel  [eg, Cerazette™])
An intrauterine device (IUD) (provided co ils are copper -banded)
True abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifest yle of the 
patient) and m ale sterilisat ion (if only one sexual partner, with the appropriate 
post-vasectomy documentation o f the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). Periodic 
abstinenc e (eg, cal endar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods) and 
withdrawal  are not acceptabl e methods of contraception. 
Women will  be considered postmenopausal if the following age -specific requirements 
apply:
Women under [ADDRESS_626427] 
been amenorrheic for 12 months or more fo llowing cessat ion of exogenous hormonal 
treatm ents AND with luteinizing hormone ( LH)andfollicle -stimulat ing hormone 
(FSH)levels in the post menopausal range.
Women over [ADDRESS_626428] been 
amenorrheic for 12 m onths or more fo llowing cessati on of  all exogenous horm onal 
treatm ents.
Women who are considered to be postmenopausal without documentation of 12 -month 
amenorrhea and receiv ing horm one replacement therapy  (HRT ),will have to use one of 
the non -horm onal highly -effective contraception methods in addit ion to HRT ,or 
discontinue HRT and to use hormonal highly -effective method for at least 3 month s
prior to Visit 1 .

discontinuat ion will  be considered at the di scret ion of eit her the Invest igator or the 
patient regardl ess of the causal relat ionship to the IP .AE should be indicated as the 
reason for discont inuat ion.
 Development of protocol -specific criteria ; In these cases, patients must be discont inued 
from the IP:
Patient wi th any asthma -specific withdrawal criteria described below:

46 (122 ) Protocol  deviat ion: After rando misation , any protocol  deviat ions detected should be 
corrected when possible and the patient should be allowed to continue .The fo llowing 
will lead to discont inuat ion of treatment: protocol deviat ions that coul d affect patient’s 
safet y (eg, illness requiring treat ment(s) which in the clinical judgement of the 
Invest igator [or after discussion wit h the study medi calmonitor] might invalidate the 
study  by [CONTACT_487429]); deviat ions due to patient non -compliance wi th the 
study  protocol .
 Failure to meet rando misat ion criteria: Vi olations of  inclusion and/or exclusio n criteria 
detected after randomisat ion.See Secti on 3.5for pati ents not fulfilling 
inclu sion/excl usion criteria but detected after randomisat ion.
 Lost to follow -up/Non-attendance :In these cases, every effort should be made by [CONTACT_487430]’s attendance as soon as 
possible .Every  effort (at least 3 documented attempts) should be made to contact [CONTACT_487431] m edical records .If the patient c annot be reached 
after that, a registered mail letter will be sent to the patient and will be docum ented in 
the medical records.
 Pregnancy: In case of pregnancy ,the pati ent will be immediately  discontinued from  the 
study  (see Sect ion 6.6.1 ).
 Patient wi thdrawal due to death.
 Other: Study  cancellat ion or any  other reason not described above.
Generally before discont inuat ion of a patient from the study , a discussio n between the 
PAREXEL Medical Monitor and theInvestigator is encouraged, as much as feasible.

47 (122 )3.11.2 Withdrawal of the informed consent
Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time ( IP administration andstudy
assessments), without prejudice to further treatment.
If a patient withdraws consent to the use of donated bio logical samples, the pati ent is 
withdrawn from  further study  parti cipat ion, as collection of the bio logical samples is an 
integral  part of the study .This does not apply for withdrawal o f consent for Gxsample.
A patientwho withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of 
any AE .The Invest igator will fo llow-up AEs outside of t he clinical study .The pat ient will 
return the eDiary  as well as the IP .
If a patient withdraws fro m participat ion in the study , then his/her enrolment/randomisat ion 
code cannot be reused. Withdrawn patients willnot be replaced.
Regardless of the reason for terminat ion, all data available for the patient at the time of 
discontinuat ion of fo llow-up m ust be recorded in the eCRF .All reasons for withdrawal o f 
consent must be documented.
3.12 Discontinuation of the study
The study  may be stopped if, in the judgement of [COMPANY_008], trial pat ients are placed at 
undue risk because o f clinically significant findings that:
 Meet individual stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_103414] 
 Are assessed as causally related to study  drug,
 Are not consi dered to be consistent with cont inuat ion of the study
Regardless of the reason for terminat ion, all data available for the patient at the time of 
discontinuat ion of fo llow-up m ust be recorded in the eCRF. All reasons for discont inuat ion of 
treatm ent m ust be docum ented.
In terminat ing the study, the Sponsor will ensure that adequate considerat ion is given to the 
protecti on of  the pati ents’ interests.

Patients who are unable to produce ac ceptable spi[INVESTIGATOR_487383] m ust not be included in the 
study .The pat ient should be co mfortable before the test; tight clothing should be loosened to 
allow the thorax to move freely. Each m anoeuvre com prises 1 “set of tests”: at least
3measurements (curves ) that are technically  adequate are needed according to the 
acceptabilit y and repeatabilit y criteria of the ATS/ERS spi [INVESTIGATOR_487384] .If both the 
acceptabilit y and repeatabilit y criteria are met, and the data are considered optimal for the 
specific pat ient, the manoeuvre sessio n can conclude after 3 measurements .If 1 or both of 
these cri teria are not m et, or the data generated are not consistent with the patients normal 
optimal efforts with no pot ential to improve then, a maximum of 5 addit ional tests (up to a 
total of 8tests) should be performed unt il either both cri teria are m et, unl ess the pati ent is ti red

5.6 Exploratory objectives: Pharmacogen omics sub -study
5.6.1 Collection of optional genom ic samples
The patient’s consent to participate in the geno micresearch co mponents of the study is 
optional. 
Ablood sample for genomic research will be obtained fro m thepatients at Visit 3, ie, after
rando misat ion, but pri or to IPadministration , and only  after pati ents agree and sign the 
additional genomic s ICF. Although DNA variants are stable parameters , early  sample 
collect ion is preferred to avo id int roducing bias t hrough excluding patients who m ay withdraw 
due to an AE, such patient would be important to include in any geno micanalysis. If for any  
reason the sample is not drawn at Visit 3, it may be taken at any visit unt il the last study visit.
Only one sample should be co llected per patient for genomic s during the study . 
Samples will  be collected, l abelled, stored and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory  Manual.

6. SAFETY REPORTING AND MEDICAL MANAGEM ENT
The P Iis responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study  are f amiliar with the 
content of this sect ion.
The Investigator will closely mo nitor any  AE and will adopt the necessary  clinical measures 
to ensure the safet y of the patients until the resolut ion of the AEs.
6.[ADDRESS_626467]. An undesirable medical condit ion 
can be symptoms (eg, nausea, chest pain), signs (eg, tachy cardi a, enlarged liver) or the 
abnorm al resul ts of an investi gation (eg, l aboratory findings, ECG). In clini cal studi es, an AE 
can include an undesirable medical condit ion occurring at any  time, including Run-inor 
wash -out peri ods, even if no study  treatm ent has been administered.
The term  AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs.
6.2 Definitions of s erious adverse event
A SAE is an AE occurring during any study  phase (i e, screening, treatment, fo llow-up), that 
fulfils one or more of the fo llowing cri teria:
 Results in death
 Is immediately life -threatening
 Requi res in -patient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_72916] 
 Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y or substantial disrupt ion of the 
abilit y to conduct normal life funct ions
 Is a congenital abnormalit y or birth defec t

Date 26 April 2019
73 (122 ) Is an important medical event that may jeopardi ze the patient or m ay requi re medical 
intervent ion to prevent o ne of the outcomes listed above
For further guidance on the definit ion of a SAE, see Appendix G.
6.3 Recording of adverse events
6.3.1 Time period for collection of adverse events
AEs will be co llected fro m the time of signature [CONTACT_487490]-in, 
as well as the Treatment peri od and including the follow -up peri od (Foll ow-up Contact [CONTACT_487446]).
6.3.2 Follow -up of unresolved adverse events
Any AEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last AE assessment in the study  will be fo llowed 
up by  [CONTACT_325391], but without further recording in the 
eCRF .[COMPANY_008] retains the right to request addit ional inform ation for any  patient with 
ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study , if judged necessary .
6.3.3 Variables 
The fo llowing vari ables will be collected for each AE:
 AE (verbat im)
 The date when the AE started and stopped
 Maximum intensit y
 Whether the AE is serious or not
 Invest igator causalit y rating against the IP (y es or no)
 Action taken with regard to IP
 AE caused pat ient’s withd rawal from  study  (yes or no)
 Outcom e
In addit ion, the fo llowing vari ables will be collected for SAEs:
 Date AE m et cri teria for SAE
 Date Invest igator became aware of SAE
 AE is seri ous due to (ie, seri ousness cri teria)
 Date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_487390]7594
Study Code D3741C00007
Version 2.0
Date 26 April 2019
74 (122 ) Date of discharge
 Probable cause of death
 Date of death
 Autopsy  performed
 Causa lity assessment in relat ion to s tudy procedure(s)
 Causalit y assessment in relat ion to other medicat ion
 Descript ion of AE
For grading the intensit y of an AE, the fo llowing intensit y rating scale will be used:
1. Mild: awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated (acceptable)
2. Moderate: disco mfort sufficient to cause interference with normal act ivities 
(disturbing)
3. Severe: incapacitat ing, with inabilit y to perform  norm al activities (unac ceptable)
AEswill be recorded only  once wi th their maximum  intensity.
It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs .Severit y is a measure of 
intensity whereas seri ousness is defined by [CONTACT_362028]6.2.An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may  be consi dered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2.On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disabili ty may be considere d a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2.
6.3.4 Causality collection
The Investigator will assess causal re lationship between IP administration and each AE, and
answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do y ou consider that there is a reasonable possibilit y that 
the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_33249]?’
For SAEs ,causal relat ionship will also be assessed for other medicat ion and study  procedures .
Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any  study  procedure the causal relationship is 
implied as ‘yes’.
A guide to the interpretation of the causalit y quest ion is found in Appendix G.

All AEs spontaneously reported by  [CONTACT_487447]: ‘Have y ou had any  heal th problems since the 
previous visit/y ou were l ast asked?’ , or revealed by  [CONTACT_487448] .When co llecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to 
recording a list of signs and symptom s.However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other 
signs or symptom s that are not generally  part of  the di agnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or 
symptom  will be recorded separately .
6.3.[ADDRESS_626468] val ues and vi tal signs shoul d therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfi l 
any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for discontinuat ion of treatment with the IP.
If deteri oration in a laboratory  value/vi tal sign i s associ ated wi th clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom  will be reported as an AE and the associated lab oratory  resul t/vital sign 
will be considered as addit ional informat ion.Wherever possible the reporting Invest igator 
uses the clinical, rat her than the laboratory term (e g, anaemia versus low haemoglo bin value). 
In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms , clinically  relevant deteri orations in non -
mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s).
Deteri oration of  a laboratory  value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should 
not be reported as an AE/SAE.
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examinat ion 
as com pared wi th the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE
6.3.7 Hy’s Law
Cases where a patient shows elevat ions in liver bio chemistry  may require further evaluat ion 
and occurrences o f AST or AL T ≥3×ULN together with TBL ≥2×ULN may  need to be 
reported as SAEs .Please refer to Appendix Dfor further instruction on cases of increases in 
liver biochemistry  and evaluat ion of Hy’s Law.

6.7 Medi cation e rror
For the pu rposes of this clinical study ,a medicati on error i s an unintended failure or mistake 
in the treatment process for an [COMPANY_008] study  drug that ei ther causes harm to the patient 
or has the potential to cause harm to the patient .
A medicat ion error is no t lack of efficacy  of the drug, but rather a human or process rela ted 
failure while the drug is under control  of the study  centre staff or patient.
Medicat ion errors include situations where an error :
Occurred
Was i dentified and intercepted before the patient received the drug
Did not occur, but circumstances were recognis edthat coul d have led to an error
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
Drug name [CONTACT_33165] n
Dispensing error eg,medication prepared incorrectly ,even if i t was not actually  given to 
the pati ent
Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of 
administration

 Drug not sto red as instructed eg,kept in the fridge when it should be at room 
temperature 
 Wrong patient received the medication (excluding IVRS/IWRS errors)
 Wrong drug administered to patient (excluding IVRS/IWRS errors)
Examples of events that do not require report ing as medicat ion errors in clinical studies:
 Errors related to or resulting fro m IVRS/IWRS -including those which lead to one of 
the above listed events that would otherwise have been a medicat ion error 
 Patient acci dentally  missed drug dose(s) eg,forgot to take m edicat ion
 Accidental  overdose (will be captured as an overdose)
 Patient failed to return unused medicat ion or em pty packaging
 Errors related to background and rescue medicat ion, or standard of care medicat ion in 
open -labelstudi es, even if an AZ product 
Medicat ion errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may  occur as a consequence of the 
medicat ion error.
If a medicat ion error occurs in the course of the study , then the Invest igator or other site 
personnel will inform the appropri ate [COMPANY_008] r epresentatives wit hin [ADDRESS_626475] igator to ensure that all 
relevant informat ion is completed wi thin 1 o r 5calendar days if there is a SAE associ ated wi th

8.3.1 Full analysis set
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) population is defined as all pat ients randomised and receiving at 
least [ADDRESS_626485] on the analysis o f 
the PK data ( eg, disallowed medicat ion, or incorrect study  medicat ion received) .All protocol 
deviat ions that occur during the study  will be considered for their severit y/impact and will be 
taken into consideration when pat ients are assigned to the PK analysis set.
The exclusio n of any  patients or time poi nts from the calculat ion of the PK parameters will be 
docum ented by  [CONTACT_487456](s) for exclusio n.The available 
concentration data and PK parameter data for any  patients excluded fro m the PK analysis set

The Per Protocol (PP) populat ion is defined as a subset of the FAS popul ationconst ituted by  
[CONTACT_487457]  (eg, m et all  inclusi on/exclusi on criteria liable to affect the efficacy  assessment).
8.3.6 Protocol deviations
Deviat ions from  the protocol  will be assessed as “important” by [CONTACT_487458] .Important devi ations from the protocol  may lead to the exclusio n of 
patients f rom the PP set and/or other analysis sets .Deviat ions will be defined before database 
hard l ock and unblin ding.Important devi ations will include the fo llowing: 
Violation of incl usion and/or exclusio n criteria
Patients who developed withdrawal criteria during t he study but were not withdrawn
Wrong study  treatm entor incorrect dose administered
Administrati on of prohibi ted concomi tant m edicat ions that are expected to influence the 
measurement of the primary endpo int
All important protocol deviations will be listed by [CONTACT_487459] .Further 
details will be described in the SAP.
A Blind Data Review Meet ing (BDRM) will be held before database hard lock and

appropriate by  [CONTACT_194713] . Continuous vari ables (laboratory  parameters, ECG, and 
blood pressure) will be summarised using descript ive statist ics (n, m ean, SD, minimum, 
median, and maximum) as appropriate by [CONTACT_487471]. Where applicable, 
data will be summarised for the observed value, and for the corresponding change fro m 
baseline/screening. Categorical variables will be summarised in frequency tables (counts and 
percentage) as appropriate by [CONTACT_487472]. 
Change from baseline will be calculated as the differences between the post -dose value at 
each time point and the morning value prior to first administration of the IP. 
For all variables, including blood pressure, digital ECG parameters, and laboratory  tests, the 
baseline values will be defined as the values obtained prior to the first morning IP 
administration on Day  [ADDRESS_626498] ing

110(122)Appendix D Actions Required in Cases of Increases in Liver 
Biochemistry and Evaluation of Hy’s Law
1.Introduction
This Appendix describes the process to be fo llowed in order to ident ify and appropriately 
report Potential Hy’s Law ( PHL )cases andHy’s Law (HL)cases .It is not intended to be a 
comprehensive gui de to the m anagement of el evated liver biochemistries.
During the course of the study  the Invest igator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry .The Investigator is responsible for determining whether a patient meets PHL 
criteria at any  point during the study .
All sources of l aboratory  data are appropri ate for the determinat ion of PHL and HL events; 
this includes samples taken at scheduled study  visits and other vi sits including central  and all 
local laboratory  evaluat ions even if co llected outside of the study  visit s; for exam ple, PHL 
criteria coul d be m et by  [CONTACT_362047] ( ALT )from a central laboratory 
and/or elevated total bilirubin ( TBL )from a local laboratory .
The Investigator will also review adverse event (AE) data (for example, for AEs that may 
indicate elevat ions in liver biochemistry ) for possible PHL events.
The Investigator participates, together with [COMPANY_008] clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meet ing PHL criteria to agree whether HLcriteria are met. HL 
criteria are met if there is no alternat ive explanation for the el evations in liver biochemistry  
other than Drug -Induced Liver Injury  (DILI) caused by  [CONTACT_33159] ( IP).
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for 
reporting AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs )according to the outcome o f the review and 
assessment in line with standard safet y reporting processes.
2.Definitions
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL)
Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST )or ALT ≥ 3× upper limit of normal ( ULN )together with
TBL ≥ 2×ULN at any  point during the study  following the start of study  medicat ion
irrespect ive of an increase in alkaline phosphatase ( ALP).
Hy’s Law (HL)
AST or ALT ≥ 3×ULN together with TBL ≥ 2×ULN, where no other reason, other than the 
IP, can be found to exp lain the co mbinat ion of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicat ing 
cholestasis, viral hepat itis, another drug.
For PHL and HL the elevat ion in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (ie, on the 
same day ) the el evati on in TBL, but there is no specifi ed timeframe within which the 
elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur.

111(122)3.Identification of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
In order to i dentify  cases of PHL i t is important to perform a comprehensive review of 
laboratory  data for any  patient who m eets any of the fo llowing i dentificat ion criteria in 
isolation or in combinat ion:
ALT ≥3×ULN
AST ≥3×ULN
TBL ≥2×ULN
When a pat ient meets any of the PHL identificat ion criteria, in isol ation or in co mbinat ion, the 
central  laboratory  will immediately  send an alert to the Invest igator (also sent to [COMPANY_008] 
representative).
The Investigator will also remain vigilant for any  local  laboratory  reports where the PHL
ident ificat ion criteria are met, where this is the case the Investigator will:
Notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative
Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by  [CONTACT_122647]
Com plete the appropri ate unscheduled laboratory  electroni c Case Report Form ( CRF )
module(s) wi th the ori ginal  local laboratory  test resul t
When the identif ication criteria are m et from central  or local laboratory  resul ts the Invest igator 
will wit hout del ay:
Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Section 2 within this Appendix 
for definit ion) by [CONTACT_487487] (including both 
central  and l ocal laboratory  resul ts)
4.Follow -up
4.1 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not met
If the patient does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:
Inform  the [COMPANY_008] representative that the patient has not met PHL criteria
Perform  follow-up on subsequent laboratory  resul ts according to the guidance provided 
in the Clinical Study  Protocol
4.2 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met
If the patient does meet PHL criteria the Investi gator will :
Notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative who will then inform the central Study Team.

For patients that met PHL cri teria prior to starting IP, the investigator is not required to 
submit a PHL SAE unless there is a significant change in the patient’s condit ion.
Note: A ‘significant’ change in the patient’s condit ion refers to a clinically  relevant

isolation or in combinat ion, or a clinically  relevant change in associated symptoms. The 
determinat ion of whether there ha s been a significant change will be at the discret ion of 
the Invest igator, this may be in consultat ion with the Study  Physician if there is any 
uncertaint y.
The Study  Physician contacts the Invest igator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an 
approach f or the study  patients’ follow-up (including any  further l aboratory  testing) and the 
continuous review of data. Subsequent to this contact [CONTACT_48887]:
Moni tor the pati ent until liver biochemistry  parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically 
indicated . Com pletes fo llow-up SAE Form as required.
Invest igate the aetiology of the event and perform diagnostic investigat ions as discussed 
with the Study  Physician. This includes decid ing which tests available in the Hy’s Law 
lab kit should be used. 
Com plete the 3Liver eCRF Modules as informat ion beco mes available .
5.Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
The instructions in this Section should be fo llowed for all cases where PHL cri teria are m et.
As soon as possible after the bi ochemistry  abnormalit y was ini tially detected, the Study  
Physician contacts the Invest igator in order to review available data and agree on whether 
there is an alternat ive explanat ion for meeting PHL cri teria other than DILI caused by  [CONTACT_33249] , 
to ensure timely analysis and reporting to health authorities within 15 calendar days from date

113(122)Physician will also be involved in this review together with other subject matter experts as 
appropriate.
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the Invest igator will fo llow the 
instructi ons bel ow.
Where there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevat ions, 
a determination of whether the alternat ive explanatio n is an AE will be made and 
subsequent ly whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:
If the alternat ive explanat ion is not an AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appro priate eCRF.
If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE : update the previously submitted PHL SAE 
and AE eCRFs accordingly wit h the new informat ion (reassessing event term; causalit y 
and seriousness criteria) fo llowing the AZ standard processes .
If it is agreed that there is noexplanat ion that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IP:
Send updated SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to [COMPANY_008] standard 
processes.
The ‘Medically  Important’ seri ous cri terion shoul d be used if no other serious 
criteria apply .
As there is no alternat ive explanation for the HL case, a causalit y assessment of 
‘related’ should be assigned.
If, there i s an unavo idable delay of over 15 cal endar day sin obtaining the informat ion 
necessary  to assess wh ether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that 
there is no alternat ive explanation unt il such time as an informed decisio n can be made:
Provi des any  further update to the previously submitted SAE of Potential Hy’s Law, 
(report ter m now ‘Hy’s Law case’) ensuring causalit y assessment i s related to IP and 
seriousness cri teria is m edically important, according to Clinical Study Protocol process 
for SAE reporting.
Continue fo llow-up and review according to agreed plan. Once the necessary  
supplementary  informat ion is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine 
whether HL criteria are still met. Update the previously submitted PHL SAE report 
following Clinical Study  Protocol process for SAE reporting, according to the outcome 
of the review and amending the reported term if an alternative explanat ion for the liver 
biochemistry  elevat ions is determined.

Rationale and Objectives
[COMPANY_008] intends to collect and store deoxy ribonucleic acid (DNA) for geno micresearch 
to explore how genomic variat ions may affect clinical parameters, risk and prognosis of 
diseases, and the response to medicat ions.Geno micresearch may lead to better understanding 
of diseases, better diagnosis of diseases or other improvements in healt h care and to the 
discovery  of new diagnosti cs, treatm ents or m edicati ons.
In addit ion, collect ion of DNA samples from populat ions wit h well described clinical 
characterist ics may lead to improvements in the design and interpretation of clinical trials and, 
possibly , to geneti cally guided treatment strategies.
Genomic Research Plan and Procedures
Selection of genomic research population
Study selection record
All patients will be asked to participate in this genomic research. Participation is vo luntary 
and if a patient declines to participate there will be no penalt y or loss of benefit. The patient 
will not be excluded from any aspect of the ma in study .
Inclusion criteria
For inclusio n in this geno micresearch, patients must fulfil all of the inclusio n criteria 
described in the main body  of the Clinical Study  Protocol  and:
 Provi de inform ed consent for the genomic sampling and analyses.
Exclusion criteria
Exclusio n from this geno micresearch may  be for any  of the excl usion criteria specified in the 
main study  or any  of the fo llowing:
 Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant
 Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusio n in [ADDRESS_626510] ion
Discontinuation of patients from this genomic research
Specific reasons for discont inuing a patient fro m this geno micresearch are:
Withdrawal o f consent for geno micresearch: Patients m ay withdraw from  this geno mic
research at any  time, in dependent of any decisio n concerning participat ion in other aspects of 
the main study .Voluntary  discont inuat ion will not prejudice further treatment. Procedures for 
discontinuat ion are outlined in Sect ion 7.5of the main Clinical Study  Protocol .

116 (122 )Collection of samples for genomic research
A blood sam ple for genomic research will be obtain ed from the pati ents at Visit 3. Although 
DNA is stable, early sample co llection is preferred to avoid introducing bias through 
excluding pat ients who may wit hdraw due to an AE, such patients would be important to 
include in any geno micanalysis. If for any  reason the sam ple is not drawn at Visit 3, it may be 
taken at any  visit until the l ast study  visit. Only one sample should be collected per patient for 
geno mics during the study .Samples will  be collected, l abelled, stored and shipped as detailed 
in the Laboratory  Manual.
Coding and storage of DNA samples
The processes adopted for the coding and storage of samples for genet ic analysis are 
important to maintain pat ient confident iality.Sampl es will  be stored for a m aximum  of [ADDRESS_626511] acing the information on the sample tube. Thereafter, the sample will be 
ident ifiable by [CONTACT_33160], unique number only. This number i s used to i dentify the sample 
and corresponding data at the [COMPANY_008] geno mics laboratori es, or at the designated 
organi sation.No personal details identifying the individual will be available to any  person 
([COMPANY_008] emplo yee or designated organi sations working with the DNA).
The link between the patient enrolment/rando misatio n code and the second number will be 
maintained and stored in a secure environment, with restricted access at [COMPANY_008] or 
designated organi sations.The link will be used to ident ify the relevant DNA samples for 
analysis, facilitate correlat ion of genoty pic resul ts wi th clinical  data, all ow regulatory  audi t 
and to trace samples for destruction in the case of withdrawal o f consent.
Ethical and Regulatory Requirements
The principles for ethical and regulatory  requi rements for the study , incl uding this geno mics 
research component, are outlined in Section 8of the m ain Clinical Study  Protocol .
Informed consent
The geno miccomponent of this study  is opti onal and the pati ent may  parti cipate in other 
components of the m ain study  without parti cipat ing in the geno miccomponent. To participate 
in the geno miccomponent of the study the patient must sign and date both the consent form 
for the m ain study  and the geno miccomponent of the study. Copi [INVESTIGATOR_487399]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_487400].

117(122)Patient data protection
[COMPANY_008] will not provide individual genoty pe resul ts to patients, any  insurance co mpany, 
any emplo yer, their family members, general physician unle ss requi red to do so by  [CONTACT_2371].
Extra precautions are taken to preserve confident iality and prevent genomic data being linked 
to the i dentity of the pati ent.In exceptional circumstances, however, certain individuals might 
see both the genomic data and the pe rsonal  identifiers of a patient. For example, in the case of 
a medical emergency , an [COMPANY_008] Physician or an Invest igator might know a patient’s 
ident ity and also have access to his or her geno micdata. Also Regulatory Authori ties may  
requi re access to the relevant files, though the patient’s medical information and the geno mic
files woul d rem ain physically  separate.
Data management
Any genoty pe data generated in this study  will be stored at a secure system at [COMPANY_008] 
and/or designated organi sationsto analyse the samples.
The results from this geno micresearch may be reported in a separate report fro m the CSR or 
published in scient ific journals.
[COMPANY_008] and its designated organisat ions may share summary results (such as geno mic
differences fro m groups of individuals with a disease) fro m this geno micresearch wit h other 
researchers, such as Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], Academic Organi sationor Heal th Insurance Co mpanies. This 
can be done by [CONTACT_33161], where they can be combined wit h 
the resul ts of similar studies to learn even more about healt h and disease. The researchers can 
only use this inform ation for healt h related research purposes. Researchers may see summary 
resul ts but they  will not be able to see individual patient data or any  personal  identifiers.
Some or all  of the clinical datasets from the main study  may be merged wi th the geno micdata 
in a suitable secure environment separate from the clinical database.
Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample Size
The number of patients that will agree to participate in the geno micresearch is unknown. It is 
therefore not possible to establish whether sufficient data will be collected to allow a formal 
statist ical evaluat ion or whether only descript ive statist ics will be gene rated. A SAP will be 
prepared where appropriate.

Further Guidance on the Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
Life threatening
‘Life -threatening’ means that the patientwas at immediate risk of death from the AEas it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the patient’s 
death .‘Life -threatening’ does not mean that had an AEoccurred in a more severe form it 
might have caused death ( eg, hepatit is that resolved without hepatic failure).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_487401] a serious AE , although the reasons 
for it may be ( eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema) .Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2144]/or surgical 
operati ons planned before or during a study  are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the patientwas enrolled in the study, prov ided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected way  during the study .
Important medical event or medical intervention
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important m edical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in 
death, hospi [INVESTIGATOR_72913], disabili ty or incapaci ty but may jeopardize the patientor may  requi re 
medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definit ion of serious .These 
shoul d usual ly be considered as serious.
Simply stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_33095]; medical 
judgement must be used.
Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone 
treatm ent
Hepatotoxicit y caused by [CONTACT_33153] l (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment 
with N-acetylcysteine
Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
Blood dy scrasias ( eg, neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or 
convuls ions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_487402] o f drug dependency  or drug abuse

120(122)Time Course .Exposure to suspect drug .Has the patient actually received the suspect 
drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relat ionship to the administration of the 
suspect drug?
Consistency wit h known drug profile .Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowl edge of the suspect drug (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or drugs of the same 
pharmaco logical class? Or could the AE be ant icipated from its pharmaco logical 
properties?
De-challenge experience .Did the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_72918]?
No al ternative cause .The AE cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_73011], other drugs, other host or environmental factors.
Re-chall enge experi ence.Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced 
after having been stopped? [COMPANY_008] would not normally  recommend or support a re -
challenge.
Laboratory  tests .A specific laboratory invest igation (if performed) has confirmed the
relationship.
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
Is this a recogni sed feature of overdose of the drug?
Is there a known mechanism?
Causalit y of ‘related’ is made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of a causal  relationship for the individual case.The expressi on 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relat ionship.
The causalit y assessment is per formed based on the available data including enough informatio n 
to make an informed judg ement .With limited or insufficient information in the case, it is likely 
that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.
Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study has deteriorated due to lack o f effect 
shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y.

Date: 26-Apr-[ADDRESS_358217] clinical trial is to evaluate the safety of plasmapheresis
performed on the NexSys@ PCS device with Percent Plasma Nomogram (PPN) feature. The
clinical trial is designed to assess if the incidence rate of significant hypotensive
(vasovagal/hypovolemia) adverse events per donation in donors undergoing plasmapheresis in the
experimental group is NOT inferior to that seen in donors in the control group. This incidence rate
is defined as at least one (1) significant hypotensive (vasovagal/hypovolemia) adverse event
according to the plasma center adverse event reporting system, based on the IQPP definitions, per
plasmapheresis procedure (See Appendix I IQPP Standard for Recording Donor Adverse Events).
For the purpose of this clinical trial, a hypotensive (vasovagal/hypovolemia) adverse event will be
determined to be significant if it fulfills one or more of the criteria defined in rows 1.2
(Hypotensive: Prefaint, No LOC (moderate)) or 1.3 (Hypotensive: LOC (brie0) or 1.4
(Hypotensive: LOC (prolonged)) or 1.5 (Hypotensive; Severe (With or Without LOC) or 1.6

SUMMARY OF THE STUDY DESIGN t.2.
1.2.1. BACKGROU]{D
Prior to 1992, there was no standard nomogram used by [CONTACT_294169]. Each
manufacturer produced their own unique nomogram. These various nomograms were based on
the variables of height, weight, and hematocrit. Traditionally, the plasma collection operator used
a series of lookup tables to determine the appropriate plasma collection volume and would enter
this volume manually into the corresponding plasmapheresis device. These earlier nomograms
had a number of benefits. The use of both height and weight to determine the target collection
votume was a step toward incorporating BMI, ensuring that those who appeared to have less total

plasma volume would donate less. These types of nomograms also utilized the donor's hematocrit
to further tailor the collection volume to the donor's biometric data.
In addition to the lack of consistency between devices, the shortcoming of this approach was the
stepwise calculation output. Prior to 1992, devices could not be programmed to automate all of
the targeting steps. This left room for human error in the manual calculation of target collection
volume. To reduce this error by [CONTACT_294170], the nomogram variables (height, weight,
and hematocrit) were grouped by [CONTACT_294171]. However, this simplification led to a significant
decrease in specificity. For example, a small change in weight, height, or hematocrit could change
the range group the donor belonged to, thus, having a large impact on the target collection
volume.
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_294161], additional risk of
miscalculation/human error has remained, Given the possibility of the same site using devices
from different manufacturers, multiple versions of lookup tables on the donor floor could occur
simultaneously. The risk of a nomogram being used with the wrong device prompted the Center
for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) to publish the current Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) nomogram in 1992,
1.2.2, GENERAL STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN

effectiveness of a PPN feature using the NexSys@ PCS during plasmapheresis. In an effort to
prevent bias, the clinical trial will be blinded to select members of the sponsor study team in

Date: 26-Apr-[ADDRESS_358218] to hide this from them with certainty (e.g.,
collection volume in bottle, time of procedure). The clinical trial is designed to collect
approximately 24,000 plasmapheresis procedures from around 5,000 - 6,000 donors. Donors will
be randomized 1:1 to the experimental group undergoing plasmapheresis using NexSys@ PCS
with the PPN feature or the control group undergoing plasmapheresis using NexSys PCS@ with
YES@ technology. As repeat donations by [CONTACT_294172], the donor will remain in
the same study group during the entire course of the clinical trial. The sample size of the clinical
trial may be reevaluated based on the number of donations and observed significant hypotensive
(vasovagal/hypovolemia) adverse events according to the plasma center adverse event reporting
system, based on the IQPP definitions. Prior to enrollment, all subjects will be required to provide
written consent.
1.2.3. RANDOMIZATION
Donors will be randomized 1:l to the experimental or control groups. As repeat donations by [CONTACT_294173], the donor will remain in the same study group during the entire course
of the clinicaltrial.
The randomization will target equal allocation of the number of donors in each study group per
site. Adverse Event (AE) incidence rates and the expected proportions in the sample groups are
expected to be drastically different between the following groups: Males vs females and first-time

donors vs repeat donors. Thus, randomization will be further stratified by [CONTACT_183947]'s gender and
first-time donor status. As the expected number of repeat donations is expected to be highly
correlated with the AE incidence, stratification by [CONTACT_294174]. This final step of the stratification will be possible
under the condition of the availability of historic data through which calculation of expected
number of donations for repeat donors could be completed.
Stratified permuted block randomization procedure with variable block sizes will be used. The
sizes of the blocks will randomly vary with possible values of 6,8 or 10.
Allocation of subjects to clinical trial groups will proceed based on the block randomization
procedure as outlined above. Once subjects are enrolled, they will be randomly assigned to the
experimental or control group and the assignment information will be synchronized with the
Nexlynk@ system. The randomization system will provide a confirmation report containing the
subject number and the randomization code. Sponsor will be monitoring the implementation of
the randomization procedure for the QC purposes.
Allocation Miss-Assignment means administration of a study procedure other than that which was
provided by [CONTACT_294175]. Example: a subject was randomized to the Control
group but received the Experimental procedure.
In the event of a protocol deviation caused by [CONTACT_294176]-Assignment the following
procedure will be used:

allowed to continue donating to the study group associated with the administered

o If the donor happens to donate in both study groups (Allocation Miss-Assignment
happens after the first donation or it happens twice) the donor will be discontinr,red. The

Correlation structure within patients will be assumed to be exchangeable, Derivation of the final
correlation model is currently in progress. The correlation structure can also be defined with the
use ofthe historic data from the current study centers.
The above modeling will be used to obtain estimates of difference in proportions of significant

in each study arm. Thus, formal hypothesis testing will be conducted if there are more than 2
severe hypotensive (vasovagal/hypovolemia) adverse events in any of the two study arms.
Estimates of significant hypotensive (vasovagal/hypovolemia) AE incidence rates will
provided separately for experimental and control groups along with their 95oh CIs based on
modeling framework outlined in the primary analysis section.
Secondary analysis rvill also include the estimation of significant hypotensive
(vasovagal/hypovolemia) AE by [CONTACT_294180]. Modeling framework outlined in
the primary analysis section with an additional covariate representing total volume of the
collected plasma will be used. Similar statistical modeling framework will be used to estimate the
incidence rates of significant hypotensive (vasovagal/hypovolemia) AE by [CONTACT_134379], and
the number of collection cycles.
Survival analysis will be used to analyze the time-to-AE (significant hypotensive
(vasovagal/hypovolernia)) data. Time to event is defined as time between the procedure start and
the occurrence of the AE. Kaplan-Meier curves will be presented. Non-parametric Log-Rank tests
will be conducted to evaluate differences between the two study groups. Survival modeling and
hazard estimation will be used to obtain parameter estimates for the variables of interest.
Other secondary objectives will be assessed with the use of continuous and discrete modeling
techniques whenever applicable. Assessment and comparison of the relative rates will be
conducted using repeat rneasure models and descriptive statistical techniques.

DONOR STATUS
First-time donors are defined as those who have never undergone plasmapheresis prior to the
study. This status will be collected as combination of the donation site historic records and self-
reporting by [CONTACT_4866]. This information will be collected prior to randomization as follows:
If the donor previously donated at the clinical site then he/she will be automatically in the repeat
donor group. If no record of prior donation exists at the site, then donor will self-report the first-
time donor status.
There will be two separate analyses for these subgroups performed as follows:
. Analysis one: lncidence rates of significant hypotensive (vasovagal/hypovolemia) AE will
be compared between the experimental and control arms separately in the first-time and
repeat donors, using the data from the first donations only.
. Analysis lwo: Incidence rates of significant hypotensive (vasovagal/hypovolemia) AE will
be compared between the experimental and control arms separately in the first-tirne and
repeat donors, using the data from entire ITT dataset (i.e. all donation).

5. SAMPLE SIZE CONSIDERATIONS
In order to evaluate the operating characteristics of the study design and the analysis
methodotogy, extensive Monte-Carlo simulation study was conducted, The experiment was
designed with an objective to mimic the real study as closely as possible (with assumptions
presented in Appendix 3). The historic data on significant hypotensive AE rates, study population
demographics, first-time donor status etc. was analyzed to inform the simulation study.
This experiment evaluated the relationship between number of subjects, number of donations and
the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis for the various assumptions of the true AE rates.
Type I error was evaluated for multiple scenarios when the true AE rate of the experimental arm
was unacceptably large: Pli,pr,- Pctt > 6
NI margin 5 is set at level of 0.0015 (0.15%). For the power analysis, 5,000 simulations were
conducted and power was calculated as follows:
Power - N(rej-ect H) * rooo/oNri-
Power is calculated for rejecting Ho at significance level of 2.5% (using 975% one-sided CI for
the AE rate difference).

The variable First comer is generated from Binomial distribution with the mean parameter p1trer
conter: 0.[ADDRESS_358229] comer - B(pfirst comer)
Where First comer: I for first comers, First comer: 0 for repeat donors.
GENERATION OF ADVERSE EVEI{TS
AEs forthe patients are generated using the method of Emrich and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_294164].
The corresponding function for generating AEs uses the mean vector Mean AE, and the
correlation matrix Corr AE to generate AEs for the patients. Correlation between first donation
and other donations within a patient is assumed to be 0.1, while the correlation between repeat
donations is assumed to be 0.5.
For example, correlation matrix Coru AE for a patient with 4 donations is:

1. SYNOPSIS
Protocol Title: An Open-label, Single-arm Phase II Safety Study of Nivolumab in 
Participants with Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Ca ncer Who Have 
Progressed During or After Receiving at Least One Prior Systemic Regimen
Study Phase:
Phase 2
Rationale:
A less frequent administration of nivolumab has the potential for  improved convenience for 
patients and reduce administrative burden. A flat dosing is exp ected to reduce prescription 
dosing errors, shorten pharmacy preparation time, and improve e ase of administration. Extending 
the dosing interval to 4 weeks would provide increased flexibility between clinical visits, as 
compared to Q2W dosing schedule.
A dose of 480 mg Q4W was selected based on equivalence to the ap proved 3 mg/kg every 
2 weeks at the median body weight of ~80 kg in nivolumab-treated  participants. A PPK model 
predicted overall nivolumab average exposures across participan ts with a wide range of body 
weight from 480 mg Q4W to be similar to that from 3 mg/kg Q2W. Although the flat dose is 
expected to lead to higher exposure in lighter patients, relati ve to the exposure in heavier patients 
given the relationship between nivolumab PK and body weight, th e predicted median and 95th 
percentile of e xposures are maintained below those in 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, which was 
established as a safe and well-tolerable dose across multiple t umor types. There was no clinical 
meaningful relationship between nivolumab exposure or body weight and frequency or severity 
of AEs. Therefore, a 480 mg Q4W is expected to be safe and tole rable in those patients.
Research Hypothesis
There is no formal hypothesis. The safety profile of less frequen t dosing regimen of 480 mg of 
nivolumab every 4 weeks is expected to be similar to that of 3 m g/kg of nivolumab every 
[ADDRESS_1222638] adverse events will be descriptive.
Study Population:
Participants ≥ [ADDRESS_1222639] 1 prior systemic r egimen.
Key Inclusion:
•ECOG Performance Status ≤ 1
•Participants with histologically documented NSCLC (SQ or NSQ) wh o present with Stage 
IIIB/Stage IV disease (according to version 7 of the Internatio nal Association for the Study 
of Lung Cancer Staging Manual in Thoracic Oncology), or with rec urrent or progressive 
disease following multimodal therapy (radiation therapy surgica l resection, or definitive 
chemo radiotherapy f or lo cally advanced disease).

•All participants with non-squamous histology must have been test e d  f o r  E G F R  m u t a t i o n  
status; use of regulatory -approved test is strongly encouraged.  ALK mutation testing is not 
required for this study. Participants with non-squamous histolo gy must be tested for EGFR 
mutations (including, but not limited to, d eletions in exon 19 and exon 21 [L 858R] 
substitution). Participants who are positive on sensitizing EGF R mutations should have 
received EGFR inhibitors prior to study entry. 
•Participants must be naïve to IO therapy.
•Participants must have at least [ADDRESS_1222640] v1.1 
criteria for solid tumors response assessment. Participants with  lesions in a previously 
irradiated field as the sole site of measurable disease will be  permitted to enrol l, provided the 
lesion(s) have demonstrated clear progression and can be measured accurately.
1) Key Exclusion Criteria
•Active brain metastases or leptomening eal metastases. Participants with brain metastases are 
eligible if these have been treated there is no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  - evidence 
of progression for at least [ADDRESS_1222641] is acceptable.
•There must also be no requirement for immunosuppressive doses o f systemic corticosteroids 
(> 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) for at least 2 weeks prior  to study drug administration.
Objectives and Endpoints:

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Sample Size Determination 
Approximately 200 participants will be enrolled in order to tre at up to 120 participants. This 
number of treated participants was chosen to provide descriptiv e analysis to estimate incidence 
rate of high-grade (Grades 3- 4 or Grade 5), drug -related, s elect A E and rate of immune-mediated 
adverse events in all tr eated particip ants with nivolumab alternate dosing schedule. Ove rall, the 
safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy is manageable and gener ally consistent across 
completed and ongoing clin ical trials with no MTD reached at an y dose tested up to 10 mg/kg. 
Most AEs were low-grade (Grade 1 to 2) with relatively few related high-grade (Grades 3 to 4) 
AEs. Rates of high-grade (Grades 3-4 or Grade 5), drug-related, sel ect AE and rate of 
immune-mediated adverse events by [CONTACT_875481] 2L NSCLC C heckMate 063, 017 and 
057 were low and <7%. Nivolumab monotherapy has been extensivel y studied in multiple tumor 
types, including melanoma, NSCLC , RCC, cHL, Head and Neck and UC  with body weight 
norm alized dosing (mg/kg). PPK modelling predicted median and 95th percent ile of e xposures 
are maintained below those in 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, which was  established as a safe and 
well-tolerable dose across multiple tumor types. There was no c linical meaningful relationship 
between nivolumab exposure or body weight and frequency or seve rity of AEs. Therefore, a 
480 mg Q4W is expected to be safe and tolerable in those patient s.
The table below shows the 95% Confidence Intervals for differen t AE rates for a sample size of 
120 participants.

3. INTRODUCTION
Nivolumab (OPDIVO®) was approved in the [LOCATION_002] (US) to t reat patients with metastatic 
squamous cell NSCLC with p rogression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. The approval  
was based on the results of Study CA209017, a rando mized trial of nivolumab versus do cetaxel. 
The median overall survival (OS) for participants in the nivolu mab arm was 9.2 months versus 
6 months for those in the docetaxel arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.5 9). Improvement in survival was 
observed for nivolumab regardless of PD-L1 expression; however,  there was a trend for better 
efficacy for those with PD-L1-positive tumors. A single-arm tria l (Study CA209063) of 
[ADDRESS_1222669] 1 additional systemic regimen, showed  a 15% overall res ponse rate 
(ORR); 59% of these participants had response durations of 6 mo nths or longer. A second Phase 3 
study, Study CA209057 demonstrating superior OS of nivolumab ve rsus docetaxel in participants 
with previously-treated non squamous NSCLC with a 27% reduction in risk of death (HR = 0.73; 
P = 0.0015). Interaction P-values reported for PD-L1 expression subgroups by [CONTACT_102425] s uggested a clinically im portant s ignal of a predictive association. 
Nivolumab also significantly improved ORR versus docetaxel (P =  0.0246), with ORR as high as 
36% in participants with PD-L1-expressing tumors. OS approximat ely doubled with nivolumab 
versus docetaxel across the PD-L1 expression continuum. In cont rast, no difference in OS was 
seen between nivolumab and docetaxel when PD-L1 was not express ed in the tumor.
In general, nivolumab has been well toler ated to date, with a favorable safety profile consistent 
with anticipated toxicities based on an immunostimulatory mecha nism of action. Nivolumab has 
been studied and is widely approved in multiple indications. Ex tensive details on the safety profile 
of nivolumab are available in the Investigator Brochure.
Overall, the safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy is managea ble and generally consistent 
across completed and ongoing clinical tr ials with no maximum tol erated dose (MTD) reached at 
any dose tested up to 10 mg/kg. Most AEs were low-grade (Grade 1 to 2) with relatively few 
related high-grade (Grade 3 to 4) AEs. There was no pattern in the incidence, severity, or causality 
of AEs with respect to nivolumab dose level. Additional details on the safety profile of nivolumab, 
including results from other clinical studies, are also availab le in the nivolumab IB.
Decreasing the frequency of administration of nivolumab has the potential for improved 
convenience for patients and to reduce administrative burden. A flat dosing is expected to reduce 
prescription dosing e rrors, shor ten phar macy preparation time, and improve ease of administrati on. 
Extending the dosing interval to 4 weeks would provide increase d flexibility between clinical 
visits, as compared to Q2W dosing schedule. The development of n ivolumab is ongoing to provide 
additional data on the optimal dose and frequency of nivolumab administration that balances
quality of life and compliance for patients in addition to effi cacy and safety. This study will
evaluate the safety profile of a less frequent dose administrat ion.

3.2 Background
3.2.1 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Background
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer and cancer-related d eaths globally, accounting for 
1.8 million new cases and 1.6 million deat hs worldwide in 2012.1Between 2004 and 2010, 
according to the SEER database, the overall 5-year survival rat e was 21.4%.2The majority of 
patients were diagnosed with advanced or metastatic disease. Pr ognosis for these patients remains 
dismal, with 5-year survival rates of < 5%. Approximately 85% o f lung cancer is NSCLC, and of 
these, approximately 80% are non-squamous, and 20% are squamous  histology. The use of 
platinum-based chemotherapy doublets, given for up to [ADDRESS_1222671]-line chemotherapy doublets include cisplatin or c arboplatin in 
combination with antimicrotubule agents, gemcitabine, or pemetr exed. Overall response rates with 
these platinum doublets is approximately 30-35%. Progression-fr ee survival (PFS) has remained 
about 4 to 5.5 months, with an overall survival (OS) of about [ADDRESS_1222672] immune response through a number of mechanism s, including down regulation 
of tumor-specific antigen expression and presentation, secretio n of anti-inflammatory cytokines, 
and upregulation of inhibitory ligands. T cell chec kpoint regulators such as CTLA-4 and 
programmed death-1 (PD-1, CD279) are cell surface molecules tha t, when engaged by [CONTACT_875483], induce signaling cascades down-regulating T ce ll activation and proliferation. 
One proposed model by [CONTACT_773478] T cell checkpoint inhib itors derive antitumor activity is 
through breaking of immune tolerance to tumor cell antigens.
Nivolumab (BMS-936558) is a fully human, IgG4 (kappa) isotype m Ab that binds PD-1 on 
activated immune cells and disrupts engagement of the receptor with its ligands PD-L1 
(B7-H1/CD274) and PD-L2 (B7-DC/CD273), thereby [CONTACT_875484].

BMS-936558 Nivolumab
Nivolumab (Opdivo ®) has recently been approved in the [LOCATION_002] (US) to treat  patients with 
advanced (metastatic) squamous c ell and nonsquamous cell lung cancer whose disease has 
progressed during or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Approva l of nivolumab in advanced 
NSCLC was based on 2 Phase 3 trials (CheckMate 017 and CheckMat e 057) which demonstrated 
survival benefit over docetaxel across histologies. The approva l in squamous NSCLC was based 
on the results of CA209017, a randomized trial of nivolumab ver sus docetaxel. The median OS 
for patients in the nivolumab arm was 9.2 months versus 6 month s for those in the docetaxel arm 
(HR = 0.59). Improvement in survival was observed for nivolumab  regardless of PD-L1 
expression, though there was a trend toward better efficacy for  those with PD-L1 expressing 
tumors. A single-arm trial (CA209063) of [ADDRESS_1222673] 1 ad ditional systemic regimen showed 
a 15% objective response rate (ORR); 59% of participants with a n ORR had response durations of 
6 months or longer.
The approval of nivolumab for the treatment of non-squamous NSC LC is based on a second Phase 
3 study, CA209057, which met its primary endpoint of superior O S of nivolumab versus docetaxel 
in patients with previously treated non-squamous NSCLC at a prep lanned interim analysis. 
Patients in the nivolumab arm had a 27% reduction in risk of de ath (HR = 0.73; P = 0.0015). 
Interaction P values, reported for PD L1 e xpression s ubgroups by [CONTACT_857105], suggested a clinically important signal of a  predictive association. Nivolumab 
also significantly improved ORR vs docetaxel (P=0.0246), with O RR as high as 36% in patients 
with PD-L1 expressing tumors. OS approximately doubled with niv olumab vs docetaxel at 1%, 
5% and 10% PD-L1 expression level. In contrast, no statisticall y significant difference in OS was 
seen between nivolumab and docetaxel when PD-L1 was not express ed in the tumor, although 
these patients also experienced durable responses, and the safe ty profile was more favorable for 
nivolumab vs docetaxel.[ADDRESS_1222674]-line metastatic and the early stage NSC LC settings. A detailed description 
of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety o f nivolumab is  provided in the Investigator’s 
Brochure and local package insert.
3.2.2 Nivolumab Mechanism of Action
Cancer immunotherapy rests on the  premise that tumors can be re cognized as foreign rather than 
as self and can be effectively attacked by [CONTACT_20397]. An effective immune 
response in this setting is thought to rely on immune surveilla nce of tumor antigens expressed on 
cancer cells that ultimately results in an adaptive immune resp onse and cancer cell death. 
Meanwhile, tumor progression may depend upon acquisition of tra its that allow cancer cells to 
evade immunosurveillance and escape effective innate and adapti ve immune responses.7,8,9
Current immunotherapy efforts attempt to break the apparent tol erance of the immune system to 
tumor cells and antigens by [CONTACT_875485]. T-cell stimulation is a complex process

involving the integration of numerous positive as well as negat ive co-stimulatory signals in 
addition to antigen recognition by [CONTACT_941] T- cell r eceptor (TCR).10Collectively, these signals govern 
the balance between T-cell activation and tolerance. 
PD-1 is a member of the CD 28 family of T-cell co -stimulatory re ceptors that also includes CD28, 
CTLA-4, ICOS, and BTLA.11PD-1 signaling has been shown to inhibit CD-28-mediated 
upregulation of IL-2, IL-10, IL-13, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and Bc l-xL. PD-[ADDRESS_1222675] genetic factors. Thus, PD-1 deficiency or inhibition is no t accompanied by a universal loss of 
tolerance to self-antigens.
In vitro, nivolumab (BMS-936558) binds to PD-1 with high affini ty (EC50 0.39-2.62 nM), and 
inhibits the binding of PD-1 to its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 (IC 50 ≤1 nM). Nivolumab binds 
specifically to PD-[ADDRESS_1222676] by [CONTACT_102428] a reproducible enhancement 
of both proliferation and IFN-γ release in the mixed lymphocyte  reaction (MLR). Using a CMV 
restimulation assay with human PBMC, the effect of nivoluma b on antigen specific recall response 
indicates that nivolumab augmented  IFN-γ secretion from CMV spe cific memory T cells in a 
dose-dependent manner versus isotype-matched control. In vivo b lockade of PD-1 by a murine 
analog of nivolumab enhances the anti-tumor immune response and  results in tumor rejection in 
several immunocompetent mouse tumor models (MC38, SA1/N, and PAN02).13
3.2.3 Nivolumab in NSCLC
PD-1 is a 55 kD type I transmembrane protein primarily expresse d on activated T  cells, B cells, 
myeloid cells, and antigen presenting cells (APC).14Binding of PD-1 to PD-L1 and PD-L2 has 
been shown to down-regulate T- cell activation in both murine and human systems.15,16,17,18In 
particular, PD-L1 has been shown to be upregulated on several c ancers types including NSCLC 
and, in some cases, correlated to negative prognosis.19,20,21,22,23PD-1/PD-L interactions may also 
indirectly modulate the response to tumor antigens through T-ce ll/APC interactions. Therefore,

(mg/kg). Nivolumab PK was determined to be linear, with dose pr oportional exposures over a dose 
range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg. Nivolumab c learance and volume of dist ribution was found to increase 
with increasing body weight, but the increase was less than pro portional, indicat ing that mg/kg 
dose represents an over-adjustment for the effect of body weigh t on nivolumab PK. A flat dosing 
is expected to reduce prescription dosing errors, shorten pharmacy preparation time, and improve 
ease of administration. Extending the dosing interval to [ADDRESS_1222678] increased flexibility between clinical visits, as compared to Q2W 
dosing schedule. 
A 480 mg Q4W regimen was selected based on equivalence to the a pproved 3 mg/kg every 
2 weeks at the median body weight of ~80 kg in nivolumab-treated  participants. A PPK model 
predicted overall nivolumab average exposures across participan ts with a wide range of body 
weight from 480 mg Q4W to be similar to that from 3 mg/kg Q2W. Although the flat dose is 
expected to lead to higher exposure in lighter patients, relati ve to the exposure in heavier patients 
given the relationship between nivolumab PK and body weight, th e predicted median and 95th 
percentile of e xposures are maintained below those in 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, which was
established as a safe and well-tolerable dose across multiple t umor types. The simu lated median 
and 95th prediction interval of nivolumab summary exposures acr oss body weight range (35 to
160 kg) are predicted to be maintained below the corresponding observed highest exposure 
experienced in nivolumab, ie, 95th percentile following nivolumab  10 mg/kg Q2W from clinical 
study CA209003. Thus, while participants in the lower body weight ranges would have greater 
exposures than 80 kg participants, the exposures are predicted to be within the range of observed 
exposures at doses (up to 10 mg/kg Q2W) used in the nivolumab c linical program, and are not 
considered to put participants at increased risk. There was no c linical meaningful r elationship 
between nivolumab exposure or BW and frequency or severity of A Es. Therefore, a 480 mg Q4W 
is expected to be safe and tolerable in those patients. In term s of efficacy, 480 mg Q4W is expected 
to result in similar efficacy given a flat exposure-response re lationship and same dose intensity. 
Overall, the benefit-risk profile of nivolumab 480 mg Q4W is exp ected to be similar to approved 
regimen 3 mg/kg Q2W, and it is recommended for further investiga tion in this study.
3.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment
Participants with advanced or metastatic NSCLC who progress wit h first-line therapy represent a 
great unmet need. The clinical activit y of nivolumab observed to date in NSCLC suggests the 
potential for improved clinical outcomes as monotherapy. A flat  dosing is expected to reduce 
prescription dosing e rrors, shor ten pharmacy preparation time, a nd improve ease of administrati on. 
Extending the dosing interval to [ADDRESS_1222679] increased flexibility between clinical visits, as compared  to Q2W dosing schedule. 
Overall, the safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy is managea ble and generally consistent 
across completed and ongoing clinical trials with no MTD reache d at any dose tested up to 
10 mg/kg. Most AEs were low-grade (Grade 1 to 2) with relatively  few related high-grade (Grade 3 
to 4) AEs. There was no pattern in the incidence, severity, or causality of AEs with respect to

Corticosteroid and/or bronchodilator therapy may also be admini stered as appropriate. If the 
infusion is interrupted, then restart the i nfusion at 50% of the original infusion r ate when 
symptoms resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 mi nutes, the rate may be 
increased to 100% of the original infusion rate. Monitor partic ipant closely. If symptoms recur, 
then no further nivolumab will be administered at that visit.
•For future infusions, the following prophylactic premedications  are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equiv alent) and/or acetaminophen/parac etamol [ADDRESS_1222717] 30 minutes before nivolumab inf usions. If necessary, 
corticosteroids  (up to 25 m g of Sol uCortef or equivalent) may be used.

following initial improvement; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14138] [eg, renal 
impairment, pulmonary infiltrate s]. Grade 4: Life-threatening; pressor or ventilatory 
support indicated).
•Immediately discontinue infusion of nivolumab. Begin an IV infu sion of normal saline and 
treat the participant as follows: Recommend bronchodilators, epi [INVESTIGATOR_238] 0.2 to 1 mg of a 
1:1000 solution for subcutane ous administrati on or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution

until the Investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will no t recur. Nivolumab will be 
permanently discontinued. Investigators should follow their ins titutional guidelines for the 
treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor partici pant until recovery of the 
symptoms.
In case of late-occurring hypersen sitivity symptoms (eg, appear ance of a localized or generalized 
pruritus within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given (eg, oral 
antihistamine or corticosteroids).

•Renal
•Pulmonary
•Hepatic
•Endocrinopathy
•Skin
•Neurological
The above algorithms are fo und in the nivolu mab Investigator Brochure, as well as in Appendix [ADDRESS_1222718] 1.1 defined PD as long as the following cri teria are met:
1) Investigator-assessed clinical benefit
2) Tolerance of study drug3) Stable performance status
4) Treatment beyond progression will not d elay an imminent intervention to prevent serious
complications of disease progression (eg, CNS metastases)
5) Participant provides written informed consent prior to receiv ing additional study treatment, 
using an ICF describing any reasonably fores eeable risk s or discomforts, or other alternative 
treatment options.
The decision to continue treatment beyond initial progression s hould be discussed with the BMS 
Medical Monitor and documented in the study records.
A radiographic assessment/ scan should be performed within 8 wee ks of original PD to determine 
whether there has been a decrease in the tumor size , or continued PD. The assessment of clinical 
benefit should be b alanced by [CONTACT_2085] j udgment as to whether the participant is c linically 
deteriorating and unlikely to receive any benefit from continue d treatment with nivolumab.
If the investigator feels that the participant continues to ach ieve clinical benefit by [CONTACT_166862], the participant should remain on the trial and conti nue to receive monitoring according 
to the Time and Events Schedule ( Section 2 ).
For the participants who con tinue study the rapy beyond progressi on, further progression is defined 
as an additional 10% increase in tumor b urden volume from time of init ial PD. This includes an 
increase in the sum of all target lesions and/ or the development of new measurable lesions. 
Treatment s hould be disconti nued permanently upon documentation  of further disease 
progression.
New lesions are considered measureable at th e time of init ial progression if the longest diameter 
is at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which mus t have a short axis of at least 
15 mm). Any new lesion considered non-measureable at the time of  initial progression may

Participants with global deterioration of health status (as d etermined by [CONTACT_093]) who 
require discontinuation of  treatment without obj ective evidence of disease progression at the time 
of treatment discontinuation should be reported as ‘symptomatic  deterioration.’ Every effort 
should be made to document objective progression (ie, radiograph ic confirmation) even after 
discontinuation of treatment.

The investigational product should be stored in a secure area a ccording to local regulations. It is 
the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that investiga tional product is only dispensed to 
study participants. The investigational product must be dispens ed only from official study sites by 
[CONTACT_20443].
The product storage manager should ensure that the study treatm ent is stored in accordance with 
the environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity)  as determined by [CONTACT_20444]. If 
concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the study treat ment arise, the study tr eatment
should not be dispensed and contact [CONTACT_20445].Study treatment not supplied by [CONTACT_551301].
Investigational product documentation (whether supplied by [CONTACT_20447]) must be maintained that 
includes all processes required to ensure drug is accurately ad ministered. This includes 
documentation of drug storage, administration a nd, as applicable, storage temperatures, 
reconstitution, and use of required processes (eg, required dil uents, administration sets).

different from the study drug must be documented in the concomi tant therapy section of the CRF.
Supportive care for disease-related symptoms may be offered to all participants on the trial.
Palliative (limited-field) radiation therapy and palliative sur gical resection are permitted if the
following criteria are met:
1) The lesion being considered for palliative therapy is not a t arget lesion or a non-target lesion 
used for tumor assessment.
2) The case is discussed with the BMS Medical Monitor (including  discussion of whether 
progression has occurred).
[IP_ADDRESS] Imaging Restriction and Precautions
If a participant has a known allergy to contrast material, loca l prophylaxis standards may be used 
to obtain the assessment with c ontrast if at all possible, or u se the alternate modality. In cases 
where contrast is strictly contraindicated, a non-contrast scan  will suffice. Should a participant

of the abdomen and pelvis may be obtained.
Study-related MRI imaging will be performed per the frequency s pecified in the protocol. 
Investigators may obtain additional follow-up MRI scans as medi cally indicated. For other locally 
performed imaging, it is the local  imaging facility’s responsib ility to determine, based on 
participant attributes (eg, alle rgy history, dia betic history, and renal status), the appropriate 
imaging modality, and contrast regimen for each participant. Im aging contraindications and 
contrast risks should be considered in this assessment. Partici pants with renal insufficiency should 
be assessed as to whether or not they should receive contrast, and if so, what type and dose of 
contrast is appropriate. Specific to MRI, participants with seve re renal insufficiency (ie, estimated 
glomerular filtrati on rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) are at increased risk of nephrogenic systemic 
fibrosis. MRI contrast should not be given to this participant population, who should be excluded 
from the study. In addition, par ticipants with surgically implan ted devices (pacemaker, deep brain 
stimulator, met allic imp lants, etc) that are incompatible with MR I should not undergo such 
imaging techniques. The local imaging fa cility a nd investigator should determine the appropriate 
precautions or guidelines that s hould be instituted for partici pants with tattoos, body pi[INVESTIGATOR_2982], or 
other body art.
The ultimate decision t o perform MRI in an individual particip ant in this study rests with  the site
radiologist, the investigator, and the standard set by [CONTACT_141428] l Ethics Committee.
7.8 Treatment After the End of the Study
At the conclusion of the study, participants who continue to dem onstrate clinical benefit will be 
eligible to receive BMS supplied s tudy treatment for the maximum  treatment duration specified in 
protocol (see Section 7.1.1 ). Study treatment will be provided via an extension of the study , a 
rollover study requiring approval by [CONTACT_875488], or through 
another mechanism at the discretion of BMS.
BMS reserves the right to terminate access to BMS supplied stud y treatment if any of the following 
occur: a) the study is terminated due to safety concerns; b) the development of nivolumab is 
terminated for other reasons, including but not limited to lack of efficacy and/or not meeting the 
study objectives; c) the participant can obtain medication from a  government sponsored or private 
healt h program; d) therapeutic alternatives become available in the l ocal market. In all cases BMS 
will follow local regulations.8. DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA
8.[ADDRESS_1222722] (and non-i nvestigational product at the 
discretion of the investigator) for a ny of the following reasons:
•Participant’s request to stop study tr eatment. Par ticipants who request to discontinue study 
treatment w ill remain in the study and must continue to be followed for pr otocol specified 
follow-up procedures. The only exception to this is when a part icipant specifically withdraws

In the case of pregnancy, the investigator must immediately not ify the BMS Medical 
Monitor/designee of this event. In the event a normal healthy f emale par ticipant become s pregnant 
during a clinical trial, the study t reatment must be discontinue d immediately. In most cases, the 
study treatment will be permanently discontinued in an appropria te manner (eg, dose tapering if 
necessary for participant safety). Please call the BMS Medical M onitor within 24 hours of 
awareness of the pregnancy. If the investigator d etermines a possible favorable benefit/risk ratio 
that warrants continuation of study treatment, a discussion bet ween the investigator and the BMS 
Medical Monitor/designee must occur.

9. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
•Study procedures and timing are summarized in the Schedule of A ctivities. 
•Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed.
•All immediate safety concerns must be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue 
treatment.
•Adherence to the study design requirements, including those spe cified in the Schedule of 
Activities, is essential and required for study conduct.
•All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to con firm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria before treatment assignment. The investigat or will 
maintain a screening log to record details of all participants s creened and to confirm eligibility 
or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable.
•Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clini cal management (eg, blood count) 
and obtained before signing of  informed consent may be utilized for screening or baseline 
purposes provided the procedure meets the protocol-defined criteria and has been performed 
within the timeframe defined in the Schedule of Activities.
Additional measures, including non-study laboratory tests should be performed as clinically 
indicated or to comply with local regulations. Laboratory toxici ties (eg, suspected drug induced

all study dr ug related toxicities resolve, re turn to baseline, or are deemed irreversible. 
If a participant shows pulmona ry-related signs (hypoxia, fever)  or symptoms (eg. dyspnea, cough, 
fever) consistent with possible pulmonary adverse events, the participant should be immediately 
evaluated to rule out pulmonary toxicity, according to the susp ected pulmonary toxicity 
management algorithm in the BMS-936558 (nivolumab) Investigator  Brochure and Appendix [ADDRESS_1222734] in accordance with the Schedu le of Activities ( Section 2 ), 
according to RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1222735] with oral/intravenous contrast or 
contrast-enhanced MRI is the preferred imaging modalities for a ssessing radiographic tumor 
response. If a participant has a known allergy to contrast material, please use local prophylaxis 
standards to obtain the assessment with contrast if at all poss ible, or use the alternate modality. In 
cases where contrast is strictly contraindicated, a non-contras t scan will suffice. Screening 
assessments should be performed within 28 days of start of study  treatment. Brain MRI is the 
preferred imaging method for evaluating CNS metastasis, and ass essment is required during 
screening in participants with a known history of treated brain  metastases. All known or suspected 
sites of disease (including CNS) should be assessed at screenin g and at subsequent assessments 
using the same imaging method and technique. If more than one method is used at screening, then the most accurate method according to RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1222736] surveillance MRI 
approximately every 12 weeks, or sooner if clinically indicated.
9.1.1 Imaging Assessment for the Study
Radiographic tumor assessments  will be c onducted at Week 8 ( ±7 days) and every 8 weeks 
(±7 days) up to 2 years or until disease progression (or un til discontinuation of study therapy in 
patients receiving nivolumab b eyond progression), lost to follo w-up, or withdrawal of st udy 
consent. Participants who discontinue earlier than 2 years or co mpleted 2 years of treatment but 
achieve SD/PR/CR at the end of F ollow-up Visit [ADDRESS_1222737] imag ing scans every 3 months (12 
weeks ±7 days) until documented radiographic disease progression or up to  a maximum duration 
of [ADDRESS_1222738] dose. Tumor assessments for all participa nts should continue as per protocol 
even if dosing is interrupted. Tumor measurements should be mad e by [CONTACT_875490]: 02
Date: 10-Jul-[ADDRESS_1222739] for each a ssessment whenever possible. Assessment o f partial assessment response 
(PR) and complete response (CR) must be confirmed at least [ADDRESS_1222740] 1.1 (see Appendix 3for details of RECIST 1.1). 
Central imaging assessments are not planned for this study; how ever, copi[INVESTIGATOR_875478], if determined to be necessary by [CONTACT_20444]. At the Sponsor’s 
discretion, scans may be collected centrally to be reviewed by [CONTACT_499847].
9.2 Adverse Events
The definitions of an AE or serious adverse event (SAE) can be f ound in Appendix 7 .
AEs will be reported by [CONTACT_2299] (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
participant's legally authorized repre sentative). 
The investigator and any designees are responsible for detectin g, documenting, and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain resp onsible for following up AEs that 
are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the s tudy, or that caused the participant to 
discontinue before completing the study. 
Contacts for SAE reporting specified in Appendix 7.
9.2.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information
The collection o f nonserious AE i nformation should begin at initiation of study treatment until [the 
follow-up contact], at the timepoints specified in the Schedule  of Activities ( Section 1 ). Nonserious 
AE information should also be collected from the start of a plac ebo lead-in period or other 
observational period intended to establish a baseline status fo r the participants.
Sections 5.6.1 a nd 5.6.2 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) repr esent the Reference Safety 
Information to determine expectedness of serious adverse events for expedited reporting. 
Following the participant’s written consent to par ticipate in the study, all SAEs, whether related 
or not related to stud y drug, must be co llected, including thos e thought to be associated with 
protocol-specified procedures.
All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening peri od and within [ADDRESS_1222741] be collected that relate to any later 
protocol-specified procedure (eg, a follow-up skin biopsy).
The investigator must report any SAE that occurs after these ti me periods and that is believed to 
be related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure.
•Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatm ent but after obtaining informed 
consent will be recorded on the appropriate section of the eCRF section.
•All SAEs will be rec orded and reported to Sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as i ndicated 
in Appendix 7 . 
•The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of this being 
available.

Investigators are not obligated  to actively seek AEs or SAEs in  former study participants. 
However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a dea th, at any time after a participant 
has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the ev ent reasonably related to the study

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Definition of immune-mediated adverse events (IMAEs) 
Immune-mediated AEs are specific events (that include pneumonit is, diarrhea/colitis, hepatitis, 
nephritis/renal dys function, rash, and endocrine [adrenal insufficiency, 
hypothyroidism/thyroiditis, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus,  and hypophysitis]) for which 
participants received immunosuppressive medication for treatment  of the event, with the exception 
of endocrine events (hypothyroidism/thyroiditis, hyperthyroidis m, hypophysitis, diabetes mellitus, 
adrenal insufficiency), which are included regardless of treatm ent since these events are often 
managed without immunosuppression. 
Immune-mediated AEs are specific events (or groups of PTs descr ibing specific events) that 
include pneumonitis, diarrhea/coli tis, hepatitis, nephritis/ren al dysfunction, rash, endocrine 
(adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism/thyroiditis, hyperthyroi dism, diabetes mellitus, and 
hypophysitis), and other specific events, considered as potenti al immune-mediated events by 
[CONTACT_1697], that meet the definition summarized below: 
•those occurring within [ADDRESS_1222742] dose 
•regardless of causality
•with no clear alternate etiology based on investigator assessme nt, or with an immune-mediated 
component 
•treated with imm une-modulating medication (Of note, adrenal ins ufficiency, 
hypothyroidism/thyroiditis, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus,  and hypophysitis are 
considered IMAEs regardless of immune-modulating medication use , since e ndocrine drug 
reactions are often managed without immune-modulating medicatio n).

9.2.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported  or elicited  during open-ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a participant. (In order to preven t reporting bias, participants s hould 
not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
Every adverse event must be assessed by [CONTACT_294856] r egard to whether it is considered 
immune-mediated. For events which  are potentially immune-mediat ed, additional information will 
be collected on the participant’s case report form.
9.2.3 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
•Nonserious AEs should be follo wed to resolution  or stabilizatio n, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Section Appendix 7 ).
•Follow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause interr uption or discontinuation of 
study treatment and for those present at the end of study treat ment as appropriate.
• All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on  the nonserious AE page of 
the CRF (paper or electronic). Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs 
and/or laboratory abnormalities t hat are reported/identified du ring the course of the study.
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to  proactively follow each participant

10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
10.1 Sample Size Determination 
Approximately 200 participants will be enrolled in order to treat up to 120 participants. This 
number of treated participants was chosen to provide descriptiv e analysis to estimate incidence 
rate of high-grade (Grades 3-4 or Grade 5), drug-related, selec t AEs and rate of immune-mediated 
AEs in all treated participants with nivolumab alternate dosing s chedule. Overall, the safety profile 
of nivolumab monotherapy is manageable and generally consistent  across completed and ongoing 
clinical trials with no MTD reached at any dose tested up to 10  mg/kg. Most AEs were low-grade 
(Grade 1 to 2) with relatively few related high-grade (Grades 3 to 4) AEs. Rates of high-grade 
(Grades 3-4 or Grade 5), drug -related, select AEs and rate of immune-mediated AEs by [CONTACT_875492] 2L NSCLC CheckMate  063, 017 and 057 were low and <7 %. Nivolumab monotherapy 
has been extensively studied in multiple tumor types, including  melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, cHL, 
Head and Neck, and UC with body weight normalized dosing (mg/kg) . PPK modelling predicted 
median and 95th percentile of exposures are maintained below th ose in 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks,26
which was established as a safe and well-tolerable dose across multiple tumor types. There was no 
clinical meaningful r elationship between nivolumab exposure or body weight and frequency or 
severity of AEs. Therefore, a 480 mg Q4W is expected to be safe  and tolerable in those patients.

1. EVALUATION OF LESIONS
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes w ill be categorized measurable or non-measurable as 
follows:
1.1 Measurable
Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least one dime nsion (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
1. [ADDRESS_1222764] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 m m)
2. 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which can not be accurately measured 
with calipers should be recorded as non-measurable)
3. [ADDRESS_1222765] x-ray
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathol ogically enlarged and measurable, a lymp h node 
must be ≥[ADDRESS_1222766] scan (CT scan slice thi ckness recommended 
to be no greater than 5 mm).
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by [CONTACT_875506]. Pathological nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet th e criterion of a short axis of 
≥[ADDRESS_1222767] in which the image 
is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition  
may be axial, saggital or coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. For e xample, 
an abdominal node which is reported as being 20 mm x 30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm and 
qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20 mm should be recorded as the node 
measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axi s ≥10 mm but < 15 mm) should 
be considered non-target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered 
non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed.
1.2 Non-Measurable
All other lesions are considered non-measurable, including smal l lesions (l ongest d iameter 
< 10mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to < 15 mm short axis) as w ell as truly 
non-measurable lesions. Lesions  considered truly non-measurable  include: leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory  breast disease, lymphangitic 
involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_143985].

2. BASELINE DOCUMENTATION OF ‘TARGET’ AND ‘NON-TARGET’ 
LESIONS
When more than one meas urable lesion is present at baseline all  lesions up to a maximum of five 
lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) represent ative of all involved organs should 
be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measur ed at baseline (this means in 
instances where patients have only one or two organ sites invol ved a maximum of two and four 
lesions respectively will be recorded).
Target lesions should be selecte d on the basis of their size (l esions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should b e those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on  occasion, the largest lesion does 
not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstan ce the next largest lesion which 
can be measured reproducibly should be selected.A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axi s for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis i s added into the sum. The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize  any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes s hould be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Mea surements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ 
(more details to follow). In additi on, it is possible to record multiple nontarget lesions involvi ng 
the same organ as a single item on the case record form (eg, ‘multiple en larged pelvic lymph nodes’ 
or ‘multiple liver metastases’).
3. RESPONSE CRITERIA
3.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nod es 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axi s to < 10 mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesio ns, taking 
as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesio ns, taking 
as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the basel ine sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20% , the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the a ppearance of one or 
more new lesions is also considered progression).
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.

3.1.1 Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions
[IP_ADDRESS] Lymph nodesLymph nodes identified as target lesions s hould always have the actual short axis measurement 
recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline  examination), even if the nodes 
regress to below 10 mm on study. This means that when lymph nod es are included as target lesions, 
the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal 
lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < [ADDRESS_1222768] achieve a sho rt axis < 10 mm. For PR, SD and 
PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesions.
[IP_ADDRESS] Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’
While on study, all lesions (nodal and non-nodal) r ecorded at baseline s hould have their actual 
measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2 mm). 
However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as  target lesions at baseline 
become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel co mfortable assigning an exact 
measure and may report them as being ‘too small to measure’. Wh en this occurs it is important 
that a value be recorded on the case report form. If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_13051], the meas urement should be recorded as 0  mm. If the lesion is believed to 
be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a defa ult value of 5 mm should be assigned 
(Note: It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph n odes since they usually have a definable 
size when normal and are freque ntly surrounded by [CONTACT_857155] i n the retroperitoneum; however, 
if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen b ut too small to measure, a default 
value of 5 mm s hould be assigned in this circumstance as well). This default value  is derived from 
the [ADDRESS_1222769] slice thickness (but should not be changed with varying CT slice thickness). The 
measurement of these lesions i s potentially non-reproducible, t herefore providing this default 
value will prevent false responses or progressions based upon m easurement error. To reiterate, 
however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measur e, that should be recorded, even if it 
is below 5 mm.
[IP_ADDRESS] Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment
When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the  fragmented portions should be 
added together to calculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, a s lesions coalesce, a plane between 
them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diam eter measurements of each 
individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such tha t they are no longer separable, the 
vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the m aximal longest diameter for the 
‘coalesced lesion’.
3.2 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to d etermine the tumor response for the 
group of non-target lesions. While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need 
not be measured and instead should be assessed only qualitative ly at the time points specified in 
the protocol.

•Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and norm alization of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10mm short axis). 
•Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintena nce of 
tumor marker level above the normal limits.
•Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression (see comments below) of existing non-
target lesions. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesion s is also considered 
progression).
3.2.1 Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non-Target Disease
The concept of progression of non-target disease requires addit ional explanation as follows:
[IP_ADDRESS] When the patient also has measurable disease
In this setti ng, to achieve ‘unequi vocal progression’ on the basis of the no n-target disease, there 
must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target  disease such that, even in presence 
of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has inc reased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy (see examples in Appendix 2  and further details below). A modest 
‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usu ally not sufficient to qualify for 
unequivocal progression status. The designation of over all progression solely on the basis of 
change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely 
rare.
[IP_ADDRESS] When the patient has only non-measurable disease
This circumstance arises in some trials when it is not a criter ion of study entry to have measurable 
disease. The same general concepts apply here as noted above, h owever, in this instance there is 
no measurable disease assessment to factor into the inte rpretati on of an increase in non-measurable 
disease burden. Because worsening in non-target disease ca nnot be easil y quantified (by [CONTACT_108]: 
if all lesions are truly non-measurable) a useful test that can  be applied when assessing patients for 
unequivocal progressi on is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden bas ed on the change 
in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the inc rease that would be required to 
declare PD for measurable disease: ie, an increase in tumor bur den representing an additional 73%
increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase dia meter in a measura ble lesion). 
Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from ‘trace’  to ‘large’, an increase in 
lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be de scribed in protocols as ‘sufficient 
to require a change in therapy’. If ‘unequivocal progression’ i s seen, the patient should be 
considered to have had overall PD at that point. While it would  be ideal t o have objective criteria 
to apply to non-measurable disease, the very nature of that dis ease makes it impossible to do so; 
therefore the increase must be substantial.
3.2.2 New Lesions
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progres sion; therefore, some comments 
on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specific  criteria for the identification of 
new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequi vocal: ie, not 
attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in im aging modality or findings thought 
to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new ’ bone lesions may be simply

healing or flare of pre-existing lesions). This is particularly  important when the patient’s baseline 
lesions show partial or complete response. For example, necrosi s of a liver lesion may be reported 
on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is not.
A lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical locat ion that was not scanned at baseline 
is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progressio n. An example of this is the patient 
who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain ordered which 
reveals metastases. The patient’s brain metastases are consider ed to be evidence of PD even if 
he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and follow-up 
evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is definitely 
a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the dat e of the initial scan. While FDG-
PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes  reasonable to incorporate the use 
of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly 
possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET ima ging can be identified according 
to the following algorithm:
1. Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at foll ow-up is a sign of PD based 
on a new lesion.
2. No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up: I f the positive FDG-PET at 
follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654],  this is PD. If the positive 
FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow-up 
CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression o ccurring at that site (if so, the 
date of PD will be the d ate of the initial a bnormal FDG-PET scan). If the positive FDG-PET 
at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on C T that is not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.
3.[ADDRESS_1222770] response recorded from th e start of the study treatment until 
the end of treatment taking into account any requirement for co nfirmation. The patient’s best 
overall response assignment will depend on the findings of both  target and non-target disease and 
will also take into consideration the appearance of new lesions . Furthermore, depending on the 
nature of the study and the protocol requirements, it may also require confirmatory measurement.

aIf a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen  at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR 
criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR). Best 
response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was me t. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed 
when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still p resent and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the 
first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR sh ould be changed to PR and the best response is PR.

A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner 
is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. 
If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
•Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study 
and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
•It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception whe n complete abstinence is 
elected. 
•WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in Section 2. 
•Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abs tinence 
NOTES:

bHormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with t he study drug, which may reduce the efficacy 
of the contraceptive method.  Hormonal contraception is permissible only when there is sufficient evidence that 
the IMP and other study med ications will not alter hormonal exposures such that contracept ion would be 
ineffective or result in increased exposures that could be potentially hazardous.  In this case, alternative methods of contraception should be utilized.

CASE REPORT FORMS
An investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories designed 
to record all observations and other d ata pertinent to the investig ation on each individual treated 
or entered as a control in the investigation. Data that are derived from source documents and reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source document s or the discrepancies must be 
explained. Additional clinical information may be collected and  analyzed in an effort to enhance 
understanding of product safety. CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities 
that are reported or identified during the course of the study.
For sites using the Sponsor or designee electronic data capture tool, electronic CRFs w ill be 
prepared for all data collection fields except for fields speci fic to SAEs and pregnancy, which will

APPENDIX 7 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS: 
DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR RECORDING, 
EVALUATING, FOLLOW UP AND REPORTING
ADVERSE EVENTS
Adverse Event Definition:
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical oc currence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation parti cipant administered study drug and 
that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (suc h as an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the us e of study drug, whether or not 
considered related to the study drug.
All nonserious adverse events (not only those deemed to be trea tment-related) should be collected 
continuously during the tr eatment period a nd for a minimum of  [ADDRESS_1222780] to whether it is considered 
immune-mediated. For events which  are potentially immune-mediat ed, additional information will 
be collected on the participant’s case report form.
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any 
dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the participa nt was at risk of  death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypotheticall y might have caused death if it were 
more severe)

economic inadequacy, caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, a dministrative 
reason)
oadmission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absen ce of any other 
SAEs (applies to oncology protocols)
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) th at may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based up on appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the participant or may requi re intervention [e.g., medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed i n the definition above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treat ment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or co nvulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].) Potential drug indu ced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 9.2.7 for the definition of potential DILI.) 
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (e.g., pathogenic  or nonpathogenic) via the study 
treatment is an SAE. 
Although pregna ncy, overdose, cancer, a nd potential drug induce d liver injury (DILI) are not 
always serious by [CONTACT_8661], these events must be h andled as SAEs. (See Section 9.2.5  
for reporting pregnancies).

EVALUATING AES AND SAES
Assessment of Causality
The causal relationship to study drug is determined by a physic ian and should be used to assess 
all adverse events (AE ). The causal relationship can be one of the following:
Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between stud y drug administration and 
the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship betw een study drug 
administration and the AE. 
The term "reasonable causal relationship" means there is eviden ce to suggest a causal 
relationship. 
Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
If only limited information is i nitially available, follow- up reports are required. (Note: Follow-
up SAE reports must include the same investigator term(s) initi ally reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity  or relationship to study d rug or if new i nformation 
becomes available, the SAE re port must be upd ated and submitted  within 24 hours to BMS (or 
designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the in itial SAE report.
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or stabilization.

REPORTING OF SAES TO SPONSOR OR DESIGNEE
•SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnan cies must be reported to BMS 
(or designee) within 24 hours of awareness of the event.
•SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report Form; pregnancies on a Pregnancy Surveillance 
Form (electronic or paper forms).
•The preferred method for SAE data reporting collection is throu gh the eCRF.
•The paper SAE/pregnancy surveillance forms are only intended as  a back-up option when 
the eCRF system is not functioning.
oIn this case, the paper forms are to be transmitted via email o r confirmed 
facsimile (fax) transmission to:
SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact [CONTACT_20491].
SAE Facsimile Number: Refer to Contact [CONTACT_20491].
For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC), electronic submission is the 
required method for reporting. In the event the electronic syst em is unavailable for transmission, 
paper forms must be used and submitted immediately. When paper forms are used, the original paper forms are to remain on site.
SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pregnancy reporti ng): Refer to Contact 
[CONTACT_20491].
All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening peri od and within [ADDRESS_1222781] dose of study treatment. For participants randomized/assigned to treatment a nd never tr eated 
with study drug, SAEs should be collected for 30 days from the date of enrollment.

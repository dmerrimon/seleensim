1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Introduction 
Down syndrome (DS) is a common disorder, occurring in 1 per 800 births,1-3 which 
translates to approximately 5,400 children with DS born in the [LOCATION_003] annually. 4 Hallmarks 
of the syndrome include intellectual disability, hypotonia and craniofacial anomalies, and 
congenital cardiac defects occur in 50% of individuals.5 Common comorbidities include 
hypothyroidism, obesity, and the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Untreated OSAS is associated with significant morbidity such as growth failure,
[ADDRESS_1190781] early mortality compared to the general population.  It is therefore incumbent upon health care practitioners to diagnose and treat comorbidities, such as OSAS, in order to optimize health and cognitive/behavioral function, increase survival, and maximize health -related quality of life. Individuals with DS are predisposed to OSAS 
due to craniofacial features (midface hypoplasia, glossoptosis), hypotonia, comorbid obesity, and hypothyroidism.
[ADDRESS_1190782] shown a prevalence of OSAS in children with DS 
between 45 and 55%.23-25 Thes e rates are markedly higher than that of typi[INVESTIGATOR_788962]24,25 in whom the prevalence of OSAS is about 2%.26  
Adenotonsillectomy (AT) is considered first-line treatment for childhood OSAS.27 However, 
available data indicate that polysomnography (PSG) improves in only a portion of children with DS after AT.

(PAP) therapy initiation due to persistent OSAS after AT, and PAP appears to be an important feature of the experience of living with DS.
29 PAP has been shown to be highly 
effective at resolving polysomnographic manifestations of OSAS in children and adolescents, including those with DS and other disabilities.
30,31  However, PAP as a 
treatment for OSAS has not been well -studied in children with DS. Furthermore, 
patient/family reported outcomes are an important knowledge gap long overdue in this population. 
1.2 Relevant Lit erature and Data 
DS Prevalence and morbidity :
  Down syndrome (DS) is a common disorder, occurring in1 
per 800 births,1-3 which translates to approximately 5,400 children with DS born in the [LOCATION_003] 
annually.4 Hallmarks of the syndrome include intellectual disability, hypotonia and 
craniofacial anomalies. Congenital cardiac defects occur in  50% of individuals.5 Common 
comorbidities include hypothyroidism, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome 
(OSAS).  DS is also associated with premature death and earl y-onset Alzheimer’s disease.[ADDRESS_1190784] 
early mortality compared to the general population.  
DS and OSAS: I ndividuals with DS are predisposed to OSAS due to craniofacial features 
(midface hypoplasia, glossoptosis, hypotonia), comorbid obesity, and hypothyroidism.[ADDRESS_1190785] shown a prevalence of OSAS in children with DS between 45 and 55%.23-25 
   3 
These rates are markedly higher than that of typi[INVESTIGATOR_6249] 24,25 in whom the 
prevalence of OSAS is about 2%.26 Untreated OSAS is associated with significant morbidity 
such as growth failure,6 systemic7-9 and pulmonary hypertension,10,11 endothelial 
dysfunction,12,13 and cognitive and behavioral deficits.14-19 It is therefore incumbent upon 
health care practitioners to diagnose and treat comorbidities, such as OSAS, in order to 
optimize health and cognitive function, increase survival, and maximize health- related 
quality of lif e in youth with DS and OSAS.  
Treatment of OSAS in Children with DS: Given the high prevalence of OSAS, the 
American Academy of Pediatrics published a clinical report focused on the care of children with DS in 2011.
[ADDRESS_1190786] of obesity as a risk factor for OSAS. Adenotonsillectomy (AT) is considered first-line treatment for childhood OSAS.

available data indicate that polysomnography (PSG) improves in only a portion of children with DS af ter AT.

(PAP) therapy initiation due to persistent OSAS after AT.29 PAP has been shown to be 
highly effective at resolving polysomnographic manifestations of OSAS in children and adolescents, including those with DS and other disabilities.
30,31  Importantly, studies indicate 
that PAP also reduces symptoms of OSAS and improves school performance, behavior, mood, daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_596315] (QOL) in typi[INVESTIGATOR_392403].
30,[ADDRESS_1190788] 
patient -reported outcomes and other physiological responses, indicating a need for studies 
that inform the medical community not only about healthcare provider-relevant outcomes but also about family-relevant outcomes related to the experience of living with DS and OSAS. In addition, RCTs that examine a range of relevant qualitative, clinical and physiological outcomes are lacking. These studies, such as the current proposal, could inform families and the medical community about variation in responses and provide the framework for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a “precision medicine” approach for future single- or multiple -
staged approaches, matching the best intervention to the individual child defined by [CONTACT_855078] -relevant, clinical, physiological and/or genetic factors.  
PAP adherence in children with DS : T
 here is a dearth of literature regarding PAP 
adherence in children, and even less in children with DS.34-36  Generally, PAP is inherently 
difficult for individuals to use regularly.  In addition to the daily burden of putting the equipment on each night and discomfort of wearing a mask with pressurized air being administered while sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], common side-effects include nasal symptoms (e.g., nasal dryness, rhinorrhea, congestion and epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]), eye irritation, skin pressure sores or dermatitis, and aerophagia. Some patients suffer from feeling closed-in by [CONTACT_855079] (e.g., claustrophia).  Not surprisingly, PAP efficacy is limited by [CONTACT_50221].
[ADDRESS_1190789] reported improved adherence over time.29,39 Importantly, the 
few studies, all retrospective, including children with DS under the larger umbrella of children with developmental disabilities (DD), have shown better adherence in children with DD compared to typi[INVESTIGATOR_6249].
29,39 Hawkins et al reported that DD was a 
positive predictor factor for PAP adherence (OR = 2 .55, 95%CI = 1.27–5.13; p = 0.007),29 
and our group has showed that at 3 months after PAP initiation, adherence was 86.7% [33.9-
   4 
97.9%] of nights in children with developmental disabilities and 62.9% [30.8-87.8%] in 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_6249] (p=0.01).39  
 
1.3 Compliance Statement  
This study will be conducted in full accordance all applicable Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_855071] a Research Policies and Procedures and all applicable Federal and state laws and 
regulations including 45 CFR 46.  All  epi[INVESTIGATOR_48478]. 
The investigators at CHOP and CCHMC will perform the study in accordance with this protocol. CHOP investigators will obtain verbal consent, CCHMC will obtain written consent, and will report unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others in accordance with Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137069]. Collection, recording, and reporting of data will be accurate and will ensure the privacy, health, and welfare of research subjects during and after the study. 
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The purpose of this multi- center  study is to further characterize the experience of living with 
DS and OSAS.  
2.1 Primary Objective (or Aim)  
• The primary objective of this study is to identify the perceptions, beliefs, and family-
relevant outcomes regarding the treatment of OSAS with PAP in children with DS. 
3 INVESTIGATION AL PLAN  
3.1 General Schema of Study Design  
Cross -sectional study 
3.2 Study Duration, Enrollment and Number of Sites  
This is a multi- center outpatient study  to be performed at 2 clinical sites: Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_855072]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Forty  Caregivers of children 
with DS and OSAS treated with PAP and their children will be enrolled. The study comprises one 30-minute open- ended semi -structured interview  per caregiver.  The duration 
of the interview is approximate. It will last up to 30 minutes as some families may want to include more details.  
3.3 Total Number of Study Sites/Total Number of Subjects Projected 
3.3.[ADDRESS_1190790] will be 1 day. 
3.3.2 Total Number of Study Sites/Total Num ber of Subjects Projected

4.1.1 Visit 1  
• Open -ended semi -structured interviews will be conducted over the phone and audio 
recorded . 
4.[ADDRESS_1190791] Completion/Withdrawal  
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to their care.  They 
may also be discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator if they fail to 
keep the phone interview appointment repeatedly. The Investigator or the Sponsor (if applicable) may also withdraw subjects who violate the study plan, or to protect the subject for reasons of safety or for administrative reasons.  It will be documented whether or not each subject completes the clinical study. If the Investigator becomes aware of any serious, related adverse events after the subject completes or withdraws from the study, they will be recorded in the source documents and on the CRF. 
4.3.[ADDRESS_1190792] Review  
• Date of birth  of child 
• Race, ethnicity, maternal education  of child and parent 
• Zip code of the family  
• Sleep study results of child 
• PAP information  of child: date of initiation of treatment, titration study, adherence  
   7 
• Child comorbidities  
 
5.2 Interview  
Semi -structured interviews will explore such key constructs as knowledge/belief about 
OSAS and PAP therapy, routines and resources that promote or limit PAP use, barriers, self-
efficacy, and communication and attitudes about PAP. T he interviews will be performed 
with the parent and that they will be audio- recorded.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_1190793] descriptive summaries (e.g. means and standard deviations for continuous variables such as age and percentages for categorical variables such as gender).  
6.3.2 Analysis of Interviews  
Data Analysis: Interviews will be transcribed by [CONTACT_855080], a professional transcription 
company. Audio files are loaded onto a secure site. In the process of transcription, all identifying information will be removed. Password protected transcripts are returned to the Mixed Methods Research Lab where they are loaded into a password protected NVivo file on a secure server in the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health. Datagain has a business use agreement with the University of Pennsylvania. Once transcripts are verified for accuracy, the audio file will be destroyed. The study team will create a codebook by [CONTACT_14664] a line by [CONTACT_855081]. The investigators will identify key ideas in the transcripts and will use these key ideas to form codes. Each code will be operationalized and decision rules for their application will be included in the definition. Once the codebook is stabilized, the team will double code the first five transcripts and will use the interrater reliability function in NVivo to ascertain agreement. 
   8 
Once 95% agreement has been achieved,  the team  will code the remaining transcripts, 
checking interrater reliability every fifth transcript.  
Coded data will be summarized, examined for patterns and used to identify factors 
associated with adherence and non -adherence as well as implementation.  
6.[ADDRESS_1190794] allowed for up to 20 interviews per site so that we can assure that saturation has been achieved.  
7 SAFETY MANAGEMENT  
7.1 Clinical Adverse Events 
Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study.  
7.2 Adverse Event Reporting 
Since the study procedures are not greater than minimal risk, SAEs are not expected. If any 
unanticipated problems related to the research involving risks to subjects or others happen during the course of this study (including SAEs) these will be reported to the IRB in accordance with CHOP IRB SOP 408: Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects. AEs that are not serious but that are notable and could involve risks to subjects will be summarized in narrative or other format.  
[ADDRESS_1190795] 
protected NVivo file on a secure server at CHOP . Access to data will be limited to 
study team me mbers. Demographic and PAP data will be entered and saved in a 
CHOP -based REDCap  system . All identifiers will be saved in the system.  
2. Security.  Same as above.  
 
   9 
3. Anonymization, de-identification or destruction.  All PHI identifiers and HIPAA 
related documents (consents, HIPAA authorization forms) will be deleted [ADDRESS_1190796] obtaining IRB approval or 
determination of exemption . The investigator will obtain a data use agreement between 
provider (the PI) and any recipi[INVESTIGATOR_5772] (including others at CHOP) before sharing a 
limited dataset (dates and zip codes).  
8.3 Regulatory and Ethical Considerations  
8.3.1 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
• Principal Investigator : [INVESTIGATOR_855073]. This will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events. Since the study procedures are not greater than minimal risk, SAEs are not expected. The PIs responsibility will be to assure that appropriate study data are communicated to the participant’s family and physicians and that appropriate referrals or interventions are initiated.  
• Institutional Review Board: CH OP will be the central IRB of this study. It  is the 
responsibility  of the Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_855074],  including a copy of the informed  consent.  Approval from 
the reviewing IRB  of the inform ed consent form  must be obtained prior to screening  
or enrolling any participants.  The clinical  site’s  Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_855075]-
approval, notification  of protocol and/or consent form changes, adverse even ts, and 
termination  of the study according to the appropriate IRB requirements. Risk 
Assessment  
Interviews and record reviews.  As with any study that involves collecting data, it is 
possible that someone who is not involved with the study may get access to participants’ confidential information. Every precaution will be taken to secure participants' personal information to ensure confidentiality. At the time of participation, each par ticipant will be 
assigned a study identification number. This number will be used on data collection forms and in the study database instead of names and other private information. A separate list that links each participant's name [CONTACT_855082]. 
   [ADDRESS_1190797] benefits: There are no direct benefit to the subjects.  
Indirect benefits:  Findings derived of this study will help increasing the understanding of the 
experience of living with DS and OSAS, and provide useful information for a future 
intervention trial of adherence to PAP in this population. 
8.3.[ADDRESS_1190798] any future medical care.  
 
8.6 Payment to Subjects/Families  
8.6.1 Payme nts to participants for time and inconvenience (i.e. compensation)  
• Participants at CHOP will receive a $[ADDRESS_1190799] for their participation.  
• Participants at Cincinnati will receive a $50.[ADDRESS_1190800] (ClinCard).

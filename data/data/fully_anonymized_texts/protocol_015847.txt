 1 INTRODUCTION  
The Dale and Betty Bumpers Vaccine Research Center (VRC), National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases  (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH)  in Bethesda, Maryland,  is 
dedicated to translating the latest knowledge of disease pathogenesis and  immunology into new 
vaccine strategies to provide safe and effective means to prevent and control infectious diseases.  
Western Equine E ncephalitis Virus (WEE V), Eastern Equine E ncephalitis  Virus (EEEV ), and 
Venezuelan Equine E ncephali tis Virus (VEE V) are transmitted by [CONTACT_180318] e an 
acute infection associated with severe morbidity that can persist for several weeks, months or even years  [1].  T hese encephalitic a lphaviruses are classified as Category B bioterrorism agents 
by [CONTACT_7698] (CDC) and the need to develop effective 
vaccines and therapeutics against these organisms is considered a high priority [ 2].  Alphaviruses 
are of significant interest for tactical weapons development (biological warfare) due to  their 
relative stability and highly infectivity  to humans in  aerosol  form .  The viruses can be 
inexpensively produced in large quantities and can yield either incapacitating or lethal infections.  
Public health demands and preventive bioterrorism measures support the need for a safe and 
immunogenic vaccine.  The product, VRC -WEVVLP073-00- VP (or WEVEE) , is a trivalent 
vaccine intended to elicit broad spectrum protection against WEE V, EEEV and VEEV exposure.  
The study is designed as a first-in-human Phase I  study to evaluate the dose, safety, tolerabilit y 
and immunogenicity of the WEVE E Vaccine.  
1.[ADDRESS_212111] a 
positive sense, single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) genome encoding structural and non-
structural proteins.  The non- structural genes inclu de replication proteins RNA polymerase and 
helicase.  Structural genes include the capsid, protein 6K and envelope proteins ( E1, E2 and E3). 
These viruses are transmitted in nature through infected mosquitoes, widely circulate in North, Central and South America, causing periodic epi[INVESTIGATOR_180285] [ 1].  Highly pathogenic in animals and 
humans, the pathology of these viruses is often associated with encephalitis and other 
neurological manifestations [ 1, 3].  Acute clinical manifestations include  fever, headache, 
lymphopenia, myalgia and ma laise.  Severe neurological disease including fatal encephalitis can 
also occur in humans, with e stimated case- fatality rates  of ≤1% for VEE V, 8-15% for WEE V, 
and 30- 70% fo r EEEV [ 4, 5].  There is no  effective antiviral treatment for any of these 
encephalic viruses, so treatment remains supportive [ 3]. 
Alphavirus infection can be confirmed by [CONTACT_180319][INVESTIGATOR_13858] .  The best method for virus identification is by [CONTACT_180320] -capture enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA)  using monoclonal antibody- based antigen -capture (MA C-
ELISA) in the acute-phase.  Other detection  methods includes the seroconversion of individuals 
between acute and convalescent phases and the isolation of virus from the brain following fatal 
encephalitis  [3, 6, 7 ].
  
1.[ADDRESS_212112]: VRC -WEVVLP073-00 -VP  
PROTOCOL VRC 313, VERSION 1.0  PROTOCOL DATE: JANUARY [ADDRESS_212113] because of the potential use of these viruses as biological weapon s.   
VLPs are multiprotein structures that mimic the organization and conformation of authentic 
native viruses without the viral genome.  Due to the absence of the viral genome, the VLP s 
cannot replicate.   VLPs contain viral surface proteins that present repetitive linear and 
conformational epi[INVESTIGATOR_180286] T and B cell immune responses and therefore, 
are useful as vaccines.   
VRC previously developed VRC- CHKVLP059 -00-VP, a Chikungunya virus (CHIK V) VLP 
vaccine.  Th is vaccine demonstrated induction of neutralizing antibodies and protection against 
CHIKV  infection by [CONTACT_180321] a rhesus macaque model [ 8].  Under IND [ZIP_CODE], 
a Phase 1 clinical trial demonstrated that the vaccine was safe and highly immunogenic in healthy adults  [9] and a Phase 2 clinical trial in CHIKV -endemic regions is pending final 
analysis . 
VRC -WEVVLP073-00- VP (or WEVEE) is a trivalent WEE,  EEE, and VEE  VLP vaccine 
produced by [CONTACT_180322] V VLP vaccine and is  intended to elicit broad 
spectrum protection against targeted alphaviruses.  
1.3 Rationale for the Use of  Aluminum –Based Adjuvant  
Adjuvants improve the immune response to many vaccines [ 10, 11].  The most common 
aluminum-based adjuvants includes aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, alum  (potassium 
aluminum sulfate), or mixed aluminum salts [12, 13].  Several phenomena contribute to the 
effect of alumi num hydroxide based adjuvants: a ‘repository effect’ which  occurs when the 
antigens aggregate on the adjuvant particle and are deposited t o the immune cell for long 
duration to induce immune responses, a pro-phagocytic effect, and possibly the activation of the 
pro-inflammatory  nucleotide like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) dependent pathway s [13].  
Aluminu m-based ad juvants often improve humoral and innate responses and may lead to 
increased antibody titers, rapid induction of responses, reduction in size or frequency of doses, increased breadth of responses to overcome pathogen diversity, induction of long- lasting 
immune memory responses, and induction of response to overcome poor immune systems in 
elderly and young children [ 14-17].  Alu minum is generally well tolerated , and adjuvants have a 
demonstrated safety profile over more than six decades  of use [ 14, 15]. 
1.3.1 Animal Experience with WEVEE VLP and Aluminum -based Adjuvants  
Preclinical studies were performed to evaluate the immunogenicity of the trivalent WEVEE VLP 
vaccines alone and with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant in rabbits and mice.  
Mice (n=5/dose) received two intramuscular ( IM) injections with WEVEE alone or WEVEE plus 
alum on days [ADDRESS_212114] was observed after priming immunization. WEVEE at 15 mcg + alum generated higher antibody responses than other doses of WEVEE with alum.   Description of the rabbit and non-human primate (NHP) studies can be found in the 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB).

 1.4 Previous Human Experience  
There is no human experience w ith VRC -WEVVLP0 73-00- VP.  Previous human experience 
with similar products and with aluminum hydroxide  adjuvants are described below. 
1.4.1 VRC- CHKVLP -59-00- VP (CHIK VLP) Vaccine and  Other VLP Vaccines  
VRC -CHKVLP059 -00-VP:  The CHIKV VLP vaccine was assessed in  a Phase 1 open- label, 
dose- escalation study (VRC 311, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) [ 9].  A ll injections were well tolerated with no 
reported arthralgia or fever after vaccination and no reported  serious adverse events (SAEs).  
Solicited reactogenicity parameters  were either none or mild; 36% of vaccinees reported mild 
local reactogenicity and  40% reported mild systemic reactogenicity at least once following 
vaccination [ 9].  Neutralizing antibodies were detected in all subjects  by [ADDRESS_212115] vaccination in all dose groups.  Neutralization 
titers of vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_180287], 
suggesting a potentially durable protective response to the vaccine [ 9].  Antibodies were detected 
by [CONTACT_180323] 80-100% of subjects in all three dose groups and geometric mean titers (GMT) 
were not significantly different between the groups except at week 24.  S tudy results fo und no 
significant difference in group GMT [ADDRESS_212116] dose. 
This alphavirus CHIKV VLP vaccine was advanced to Phase 2 clinical  evaluation in November 
2015 in protocol VRC 704 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  Between November 18, 2015 to October 20, 2016, 
400 subjects were randomly enrolled into two groups: CHIKV VLP vaccine (n = 201) or PBS placebo (n = 199). Of the 201 participants in the CHIKV VLP vaccine group, 192 received both 
vaccinations, and 180 completed the study to week 72. Of the 199 participants in the PBS 
placebo group, 192 received both placebo vaccinations, and 193 completed the study to week 72. 
The CHIKV VLP vaccine was well tolerated, with no SAE related to vaccine reported. For local 
reactog enicity, including pain/tenderness, swelling or redness, 64 (32%) vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_180288], rated as mild or moderate in severity. For systemic reactogenicity, 
including malaise, myalgia, headache, chills, nausea, joint pain and temperature, 87 (44%) 
vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_180289], rated as mild or moderate in severity. One 
vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] (0.5%) experienced a headache graded as severe after the second vaccination. In comparison to placebo, the only significant diffe rence in local reactogenicity was 
pain/tenderness at the injection site (p -value = 0.005) and there were no significant differences 
observed in other solicited systemic reactogenicity parameters in vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
Overall, [ADDRESS_212117] occurred 
in 11 subjects (neutropenia, bradycardia, hypotension, viral infection, rash, chest pain, dry lips, 
light headedness, fever, myalgia, gastroenteritis, abdominal pain, anemia, alanine aminotransferase increase, and two hematomas. Of these, AEs (75%) occurred in 8 subjects in 
the vaccine group, and four AEs (25%) occurred in three subjects in the placebo group. All 
potentially related adverse events resolved without clinical sequelae.    
Other VLP Vac cines :  VLP s are considered highly immunogenic and are known to elicit high ly 
neutralizing antibody titers .  The FDA has approved several prophylactic VLP vaccines 
including hepatitis B vaccines (Engerix® and Recombivax HB®, GlaxoSmithKline and [COMPANY_006], 
respectively) and human papi[INVESTIGATOR_27509] (HPV) vaccines (Cervarix® and Gardasil®,

 GlaxoSmithKline and [COMPANY_006], respectively).  Several other VLP vaccine candidates, such as 
vaccines for influenza, Norwalk and parvovirus, are in pre- clinical or Phase I testing [ 18, 19].  
1.4.[ADDRESS_212118] been used for protection of laboratory workers and other at- risk 
personnel under FDA  IND applications [ 20].  A live -attenuated VEE V vaccine was develo ped by 
[CONTACT_941] U .S. Army and tested  in 821 laboratory workers ; minor side- effects (malaise, headache, 
fever, chills, myalgia, sore throat, nausea, arthralgia, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, erythema, rash, urticarial, vasovagal response) were noted in 23% of vaccines  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_180290].  At the end  of the study, the prime -boost regimen of the live -attenuated 
VEE V vaccine prime (TC-83) followed by [CONTACT_180324] V vaccine boost (C-84) induced 
long- lasting immune response; however, the investigator s concluded that a more immunogenic, 
less reactogenic, single -dose vaccine is needed  [21]. 
Immunologic interference was revealed in sequential or same-day administration of previous generation s of inactivated and live-attenuated alphavirus vaccines in animal models and in 
humans [ 22-25].  In a retrospective data analysis study with 766 volunteers immunized through a 
special immunization program at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases ([LOCATION_003]MRIID), subjects who received inactivated EEE V and WEEV vaccines before the 
live-attenuated VEE V vaccine had significantly lower rates of antibody response than subjects 
receiving VEE V vaccine before EEE V and WEEV vaccines (66.7% and 80.6%, respectively, 
p=0.026) [ 24].  Similar findings were reported for the same- day/different arm administration of 
inactivated EEE V and WEEV vaccines in a cohort of 1401 volunteers immunized through the 
same program .  The overall primary response rate for EEE V vaccines was 66% and for WEEV 
vaccine was 42%  [25]. 
1.4.[ADDRESS_212119] been used in vaccines for many decades and with a demonstrated safety profile  [26].  Aluminum is the most common adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by 
[CONTACT_1622]  [27, 28].  Aluminum- containing vaccines have been associated with erythema, 
subcutaneous nodules, contact [CONTACT_180325], granulomatous inflammation  [26, 29].  A 
specific limitation  is neurotoxicity in patients with decreased renal function [ 27].  
Aluminum-based adjuvants promote strong humoral immune responses, and therefore, are 
incorporated in vaccines against diseases where neutralizing antibodies are required for 
protection such as diphtheria, tetanus and hepatitis B [ 17].  The licensed HPV VLP vaccines, 
Gardasil ([COMPANY_006] & Co, Inc.) and Cervarix (GlaxoSmithKline), have alum inum in the

4 STUDY DESIGN AND CLINICAL PROCEDURES  
This is a Phase I, randomized, open-label, dose- escalation study to examine the dose, safety, 
tolerability, and immune response to the WEVEE vaccine alone or with alum  adjuvant at three 
doses (6 mcg, 30 mcg, and 60 mcg) in healthy adults.   Eligible s ubject s will be randomized to 
WEVEE alone or WEVEE plus alum administration in each dose group.  The product will be 
administered IM in the deltoid muscle via needle and syringe at Day 0 and Week 8 in each dose group.  The hypothes es are that this vaccine will b e safe and elicit specific immune responses to 
WEE, EEE and VEE viruses.

4.[ADDRESS_212133] (IRB) approved advertising.  To 
identify potential study subjects, study staff may discuss the VRC [ADDRESS_212134] sign s an informed consent form 
(ICF).  The screening process may occur over one visit or multiple visits in order for the site to 
fully assess each subject’s eligibility to participate in this study.   Screening evaluations must all  
be completed within the 28-day screening window.  The ICF may be signed more than 28 days 
before study randomization and does not need to be re-signed if outside of this window, unless required by [CONTACT_779]’s IRB or an updated form becomes available. 
Assessment of Understanding : The Assessment of Understanding (AoU) is a tool to help study 
staff confirm the subject’s understanding of the consent information.  The AoU must be 
completed  at least once before the subject signs the ICF.  Incorrect answers on the AoU must be 
reviewed with the subject. Study clinicians must review the ICF with each potential subject.  Before screening procedures 
can be performed, informed consent must be obtained, and the form must be signed, dated  and 
timed  by [CONTACT_180329] a witness .  Any member of 
the research/clinical team can be a witness, but a consenter and a witness should not be the same 
person at the same time.

site-specif ic forms as needed, adding relevant information as required by [CONTACT_180330] . 
During Screening : 
• Medical History and Physical Examination : Study clinicians must obtain a medical 
history and perform a physical examination including collection of vital signs, height 
and weight within 28 days before randomization. 
• Injection Site Assessment : Clinicians should assess potential injection sites in the 
deltoid muscle.  Clinicians should avoid administering an injection in an area that has an injury , local skin problem or significant tattoo that interferes with evaluation of the 
injection site after product administration.  
• Pregnancy Prevention Counseling and Pregnancy Testing : Study clinicians must 
complete pregnancy prevention counseling on female subjects of childbearing potential to evaluate if subjects are able to meet the birth control eligibility criteria.   Pregnancy 
test results must also be confirmed as negative for these subjects during screening.   
• HIV Prevention Counseling : During screening, HIV counseling must be completed on 
all subjects being tested for HIV to ensure the subject is aware of how to reduce risk of and avoid HIV infection.  Every attempt must be made to provide the HIV test results to the subjects.  
• Blood Sample Collection : 
− Samples for clinical evaluation of eligibility criteria must be c ollected  no more 
than 28 days before randomization. Tests may be repeated as needed based on clinical judgment to confirm eligibility or if there is a suspected change in health status.  
− Samples for research must be collected during screening  per Schedule of 
Evaluations (Appendix III).  However, research samples obtained more than 28 days before randomization do not need to be repeated. Some samples collected during screening may be used for as say validation and site proficiency testing.  
• Eligibility Review : Based on results from the physical examination, medical history 
evaluation, blood tests and any additional health assessments performed during screening, the study clinicians will determine if subjects qualify to be randomized and receive the study product, and confirm this by [CONTACT_180331].  For subjects who are not eligible, the reason(s)  for 
ineligibility  must be recorded.

4.2.4 Randomization 
Visit 02 (Day 0) is defined as the day of study randomization and first product administration. 
If a subject presents with fever or other signs of illness during the first product administration 
visit, do not randomize the subject and do not order or administer study product.  Instead, review 
PRODUCT: VRC -WEVVLP073-00 -VP  
PROTOCOL VRC 313, VERSION 1.0  PROTOCOL DATE: JANUARY [ADDRESS_212137]’s medical hist ory and conduct a targeted physical examination, as needed.  If there 
are no exclusionary findings or significant illness and the subject becomes well, the 
randomization visit may be rescheduled within the 28-day allowable screening period.  If Visit 
[ADDRESS_212138] for randomization. 
Before Randomization :  
• Pregnancy Prevention Counseling and Pregnancy  Testing : Pregnancy prevention 
counseling must be conducted, and pregnancy test results must be confirmed negative 
for females of childbearing potential.  
• Medical History Review and Targeted Physical Examination : Review health status 
and current medication s including recent vaccinations, measure vital signs, and re- assess 
potential injection sites.  
• Eligibility Confirmation : Eligibility criteria must be reviewed prior to randomization in 
the study database.  
Randomization : Subjects are electronically randomized upon entry in the database to the open 
dose group to receive vaccine alone or vaccine plus alum, based on a randomization plan prepared in advance by [CONTACT_180332].   Randomization and product administration 
must both occur on the same day at Visit 02 (Day 0).  
Baseline Values for Future Health Assessments : Visit [ADDRESS_212139] was not performed at Visit 02 or if results were not obtained due to an error, the values that were obtained during screening evaluations may be used as the baseline for all future safety assessments.  
4.2.5 Study Schedule  
The Schedule of Evaluations in Appendix III provides details on the study schedule and the 
permitted visit windows.  A clinician should discuss the target dates and timing of the study 
vaccination(s) and sample collections before completing a randomization to help ensure that the subject can comply with the projected schedule. 
The schedule of study visits, permitted windows for completing the visits, and evaluations 
performed at each visit are shown in Appendix III.  After randomization, deviations from the visit windows in completing study visits an d study product administrations are discouraged and 
will be recorded as protocol deviations, but are permitted at the discretion of the IND Sponsor. 
Important Information about Shifting Study Visits  
Study visits are scheduled a specific number of days apart in order to obtain blood samples for 
safety and research data at critical time points after each product administration.  Note that these 
days are calendar days and not working business days.  Therefore, the “Day of Study” is important to consider wh en scheduling or rescheduling a subject visit.  All study visits are 
scheduled based on the date of the most recent product administration.  Below is further explanation on scheduling.

 Visit 02 (Day 0) = first product administration visit.  Study Visits 02A through [ADDRESS_212140] administration.  
Visit 05 = second product administration visit.  Study Visits 05A through [ADDRESS_212141] be scheduled 
based on the date of Visit 05.  For example, if Visit 05 occurs +/-[ADDRESS_212142] also be moved ahead +/-[ADDRESS_212143] : Pregnancy prevention counseling must be conducted, and 
pregnancy test results must be confirmed negative for females of childbearing potential.  
Subjects must be clinically evaluated with a medical history review and injection site assessment. Blood samples must be collected after randomization but prior to product administration per Appendix III.  
Ordering Study Products : The s ite must follow standard operating procedures to order study 
product from the Pharmacy. 
Product Administration Procedures : It is recommended, but not required, that the first 
vaccination be administered into the non-dominant arm.  It is preferred, but not required, to 
alternate arms for  a subsequent product administration, if applicable.  When choosing an arm for 
the product administration, clinicians should consider whether there is an arm injury, local skin 
problem or significant tattoo that precludes the adminis tration of the study product or will 
interfere with evaluating the arm after product administration .  All product administrations will 
be administered IM into upper arm deltoid muscle by [CONTACT_115557].   
For groups receiving adjuvant, the adjuvant wil l be added  by [CONTACT_180333].  
Prior to each product administration, the syringe MUST be inverted 5 times .  “Inversion ” of 
a prepared syringe is defined as a gentle, complete 180 degree rotation, do not “ shake ” the 
syringe.  
For the Second Product Administration: If a subject presents with fever or other signs of 
significant illness on the day of the product administration visit, do not order or administer study 
product.  Unscheduled visits may be used to evaluate the subject’s condition and the administration visit should be rescheduled within the allowable visit window. 
If a subject is undergoing evaluation and/or treatment for a medical condition at the time of the 
second scheduled administration visit, then vaccinations should be delayed until the condition has resolved or is considered stable.  Contact [CONTACT_180334] .  
To schedule a product administration visit outside of the allowable visit window, the site must  document PI [INVESTIGATOR_41473]. 
Post Product Administration Procedures : Following product administration , all subject s will 
be observed for a minimum of 30 minutes.  Vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, pulse , and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) will be collected  at least  [ADDRESS_212144]: VRC -WEVVLP073-00 -VP

Card” to use as a memory aid, on which to record temperature and symptoms daily for [ADDRESS_212146] the day’s highest measured temperature and measurement of the largest  
diameter of rednes s and swelling at injection site.   
Subjects will be trained and encouraged to use a secure electronic database but have the option to 
complete a paper diary card.  When the parameters are recorded directly by [CONTACT_180335] , the subject’s electronic record will be the source for these data.  The paper diary 
card may be used as a source document.  When neither a paper  nor electronic diary card is 
available, the study clinician will note the source of reactogenicity information recorded in the study database.    
The solicited signs and symptoms on the diary card will include  the following parameters: 
pain/tenderness at injection site , erythema (redness)  at injection site , induration (swelling) at 
injection site , temperature, unusually tired/feeling  unwell, muscles aches (other than at injection 
site), arthralgia (joint pain) , headache, chills  and nausea.   
Follow-up on subject well-being will be performed by [CONTACT_756] [ADDRESS_212147] administration  that may r equire clinical evaluation include

vaccine at any time during the study will be recorded in the database (clinicians should work 
with subjects regarding the timing of licensed vaccines relative to product administration ).  
Otherwise, the concomitant medication changes throughout the study will be recorded in the subject’s chart as needed for general medical records, but will not be recorded in the database.  
4.3    Dose Escalation  
There will be two dose escalation  review s in this  study.  The Protocol Safety Review Team 
(PSRT, Section 8.8.1) will conduct an interim safety review of all available data at the time of 
the review .  The PSRT must assess the data as showing no significant safety concerns before 
escalation to the next dose. 
Randomization will begin in Group 1 (6 mcg WEVEE) and Group 2 (6 mcg WEVEE + alum ).  
No more than one subject will be randomized and vaccinated per day  for the first 3 subjects at 
each dose.   
1) The first interim safety review for dose escalation will be conducted when safety data for 
the first 3 subjects to receive 6 mcg WEVEE become available for the visit two weeks 
after vaccination  (Visit 03 /Day 14) .  Subject  randomization s and vaccination s in Group 1 
and Group 2 may continue during the interim safety review ; however, randomizations 
should be completed prior to beginning Group 3 and 4 randomizations. 
If the  6 mcg dose of WEVEE is assessed as not showing safety concerns by [CONTACT_111153], 
randomization can begin for Group 3 and Group 4.  
Randomization will proceed in Group 3 (30 mcg WEVEE) and Group 4 (30 mcg WEVEE + 
alum ).  
2) The second interim safety review for dose escalation will be conducted when safety data  
for the first 3 subjects to receive 30 mcg WEVEE  become available for the visit two 
weeks after vaccination  (Visit 03 /Day 14).  Subject randomizations and vaccinations in 
Group 3 and Group 4 may continue during the interim safety review ; however, 
randomizations should be completed prior to beginning Group 5 and 6 randomizations. If the 30 mcg dose is assessed as safe, randomization can begin for Group 5 (60 mcg 
WEVEE) and Group 6 (60 mcg WEVEE + alum ). 
If an initial study vaccination is not completed or there are discontinuations from the study 
before there are sufficient data to conduct the dose escalation review, then extra subjects may be randomized at the same dose level  in order to have the requisite data on at least 3 subjects in 
these groups.  The IRB will be provided with documentation of the safety review process and notification of the dose escalation.  Consultation with the IRB and FDA, if needed, as per study pause criteria ( Section 4.4
) will occur if indicated by [CONTACT_33828].   One outcome of a dose 
escalation rev iew may be to  recommend evaluation of additional subjects at the current dose 
level and reassess for safety before proceeding to a higher dose level.

 4.4    Pausing and Resuming the Study  
4.4.1 Criteria for Pausing the Study  
The Protocol Chairs, in consultation with site PI , will closely monitor and analyze study data as 
they become available and will make determinations regarding the presence and severity of AEs.  
The administration of  study products and  new enrollments will be paused and the IND Sponsor 
will be promptly notified according to the following criteria:  
• One (or more) subject experiences a SAE  assessed as related to the study product 
(with or without adjuvant). 
• Two  (or more) subjects experience the same Grade [ADDRESS_212151] (with or without adjuvant). Pause is not required for s elf-
limited  solicited reactogenicity (generally defined as resolved within 2 days of onset) 
following any study vaccination.  
• Three (or more) subjects experience the same or similar Grade 3 solicited AE  (other 
than injection site redness or swelling) lasting > [ADDRESS_212152] administration s.  The review to make this decision will occur as follows:  
• The IND Sponsor, with participation by [CONTACT_180336] d site PI, will conduct the 
review and make the decision to resume or close the study for any SAEs  or AEs  that meet 
the criteria for pausing the study.  
o As part of the pause review, the reviewers will also advise on whether the study needs 
to be paused again for any subsequent AEs of the same type.  The FDA and the IRB 
will be notified of SAE and Grade 3 or higher pause reviews and of the IND Sponsor’s decisions.

5 SAFETY AND ADVERSE E VENTS  
5.1    Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, including any abnormal sign (e.g., abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of study  treatment, whether or not considered related 
to the study product.

 Each AE  will be graded according to the T able for G rading S everity of Adverse Events  (see 
Appendix IV ).  The following guidelines will be used  to determine when or not an AE should be 
recorded in the study database:  
• From the time that subject signs the ICF, only AE that meet the definition of a SAE as 
described in Section 5.2 that occur within 24 hours of a screening visit will be reported.  
• Solicited AE s (i.e, reactogenicity parameters) will be recorded in the study database per 
diary card entries  for [ADDRESS_212157] resolution information for any reactogenicity symptoms that are not resolved within 7 days.  
• Unsolicited AEs and attribution assessments will be recorded in the study database from 
receipt of the first product administration  through the visit scheduled for [ADDRESS_212158] administration , only SAEs (as 
detailed in Section 5.2
) and new chronic medical conditions that require ongoing 
medical management  are recorded throu gh the last study visit.  
5.2    Serious Adverse Events   
The term “serious adverse event” (SAE) as defined in US 21 Code of Federal Regulations  (CFR ) 312.32 as follows: “ an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious”

hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events 
that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47022], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in 
this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.”  
“Life threatening” refers to an AE  that at occurrence, represented an immediate risk of death  to 
the subject . An event that  hypothetically may cause death if  it occurs  in a more severe form  is 
not considered life- threatening. Similarly, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_180294] r an elective procedure is not 
considered a SAE .

5.3.1    IND Sponsor Reporting to the FDA  
It is the responsibility of the IND Sponsor to make the determination of which SAEs are “serious 
and unexpected suspected adverse reactions” (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) as defined in 21 CFR 312.32. 
• Suspected adverse reaction  means any AE  for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the AE. 
• Unexpected adverse e vent means an AE that is not listed in the IB or is not listed at 
the specificity or severity that has been observed.   
All S[LOCATION_003]Rs, as determined by [CONTACT_9533], will be reported to the FDA as IND Safety 
Reports.  All  IND Safety Reports will be provided to the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_180295]. 
The IND Sponsor will submit an IND Annual Report of the progress of the investigation to the 
FDA as defined in [ADDRESS_212161]  
The site should following the reporting procedures and requireme nts established by [CONTACT_180338].  
The definitions below are provided as guidance and should not supersede the site ’s IRB policies.

5.4.1 Unanticipated Problem s 
An unanticipated problem (UP) is defined as any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all three of the following criteria: 
PRODUCT: VRC -WEVVLP073-00 -VP  
PROTOCOL VRC 313, VERSION 1.0  PROTOCOL DATE: JANUARY 9 , 2019  
 
Page 28 of 66 
 
 • unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency in relation to the research risks that are 
described in the protocol, informed consent , IB, other study documents or in 
consideration of the characteristics of the subject population being studied; and  
• related to participation in the research; and  
• suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater r isk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
Serious UP: An UP that meets the definition of a SAE or compromises the safety, welfare or rights of subjects or others. 
An UP that is not an AE ( UPnonAE) is an unanticipated problem that does not fit the definition 
of an AE , but which may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], involve risk to the subject, affect 
others in the research study, or significantly impact the integrity of research data.  Such events 
may also  be considered a UP.  For example, we will report occurrences of breaches of 
confidentiality, accidental destruction of study records, or unaccounted- for study drug.  
5.4.2 Protocol Deviations 
A protocol deviation is defined as any change, divergence, or departure from the IRB -approved 
study procedures in a research protocol.  Protocol deviations are designated as serious or non-serious and further characterized as : 
• Those that occur because a member of the research team deviates from the pro tocol. 
• Those that are identified before they occur, but cannot be prevented. 
• Those that are discovered after they occur.  
Serious Protocol Deviation: A deviation that meets the definition of a SAE  or compromises the 
safety, integrity of the data, welfare or rights of subjects or others. 
5.4.3 Non-Compliance  
Non-compliance is the failure to comply with applicable NIH Human Research Protections 
Program (HRPP) policies, IRB requirements, or regulatory requirements for the protection of 
human subjects.  Non -complian ce is further characterized as serious, continuing or minor. 
“Serious non-compliance” is defined as non- compliance that  
• Increases risks, or causes harm, to participants  
• Decreases potential benefits to participants  
• Compromises the integrity of the NIH-HRPP  
• Invalidates the study data  
“Continuing non-compliance” is non- compliance that is recurring.  
“Minor non-compliance” is non-compliance that is neither serious nor continuing.

6 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
6.1    Overview  
This study is a Phase I, randomized, open-label, dose- escalation study  to examine  the dose, 
safety , tolerability,  and immunogenicit y of  VRC -WEVVLP073-00- VP (WEVEE) alone or with 
alum adjuvant at Day 0 and Week 8 .  The primary objective relates to safety and tolerability; the 
secondary and exploratory objectives relate to the immunogenicity of the study product.   
6.2    Endpoints  
6.2.1 Primary  Endpoints: Safety  
Assessment of product safety will include clinical observation and monitoring of hematological 
and chemical parameters.  Reactogenicity will be closely monitored for [ADDRESS_212162] administration  and safety evaluated by [CONTACT_180340] 36 weeks.  
The following parameters will be assessed  for all study groups : 
• Local reactogenicity signs and symptoms for 7 days after each injection  
• Systemic reactogenicity signs and symptoms for 7 days after each injection  
• Laboratory measures of safety   
• AEs  
• SAEs  
• New chronic medical conditions    
6.2.2 Secondary Endpoints: Immunogenicity  
The immunogenicity endpoints are antigen -specific antibody responses as evaluated by  [CONTACT_166193]-
specific neutralization assays.  The primary time point for immunoge nicity evaluation is 4 weeks 
after the second vaccination. 
6.2.3 Exploratory Endpoints: Immunogenicity 
Exploratory immunogenicity endpoints are measured by [CONTACT_166193]- specific  neutralization assay s, 
ELISA,  and other research tests as described in Section 1.[ADDRESS_212163]: VRC -WEVVLP073-00 -VP

the probability of not observing any event is at least 90%.  Within each group (n=5), there is over 
90% chance to observe at least [ADDRESS_212165] 0. 37 and over 90% chance to 
observe no SAE if the true rate is no more than 0. 02. 
Probabilities of observing 0 or more than 1 SAE  within each group are presented in Table 2 for a 
range of possible true event rates.  These calculations provide a more complete pi[INVESTIGATOR_180296].  
Table 3 gives the u pper and lower bounds for 95% exact binomial confidence intervals of the 
true SAE rate at all possible numbers of events within each group (n=5).  If none of the 5 vaccines experience serious adverse events, the 95% exact 2 -sided upper confidence bound for 
the SAE rate is 0. 522.

 6.4.3 Safety Analysis 
Reactogenicities  
The number and percentage of participants experiencing each type of reactogenicity sign or 
symptom will be tabulated by [CONTACT_926].  For a given sign or symptom, each participant’s reactogenicity will be counted once under the maximum severity for all assess ments.  
Adverse Experiences  
Adverse experiences are coded into Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
preferred terms.  The number and percentages of participants experiencing each specific adverse 
event will be tabulated by [CONTACT_22056].  For the calculations in these tables, each participant’s adverse experience will be counted once under the maximum severity or strongest recorded causal relationship to treatment. 
A complete listing of adverse experiences for each p articipant will provide details including 
severity, relationship to treatment, onset, duration and outcome. 
Local laboratory values 
Boxplots of local laboratory values will be generated for baseline values and for values measured 
during the course of the s tudy.   Each boxplot will show the 1st quartile, the median, and the [ADDRESS_212171] receiving a schedule different from the assignment, then an as- treated analysis 
will be performed. 
If assay data are qualitative (i.e., positive or negative) then analyses will be performed by 
[CONTACT_180341].  Binomial response rates will be presented with their corresponding exact 95% 
confidence interval estimates.   Fisher’s exact tests will be used to compare the two vaccine 
groups to each other.  Missing responses will be assumed to be missing at random, i.e., 
conditional on the observed data the missingness is independent of the unobserved responses.  Graphical descriptions of the longitudinal immune responses will also be given. 
Some immunologic assays have underlying continuous or count-type readout that is often 
dichotomized into responder/nonresponder categories.  For these assays, graphical and tabular 
summaries of the underlying distributions will be made.  These summaries may be performed on 
transformed data ( e.g., log transformat ion) to better satisfy assumptions of symmetry and 
homoscedasticity.

INTRODUCTION 
We invite you to take part in a research study at the  [Insert Site name  [CONTACT_180376]]   
The study is sponsored by [CONTACT_7681] (NIH) in Bethesda, MD, [LOCATION_003].  You 
can decide if you want to take part in this study or not. There is no penalty or loss of benefits if you choose not to take part .  Please ask questions and talk about this study with anyone you 
want.   Take as much time as you need to decide.  You will be given a copy of this consent form. 
SCREENING  
Before you can take part in this experimental study, your health will be checked so we can decide if you qualify to participate .  You will need to sign this consent form before screening.  If 
you qualify, then you may take part in the vaccine study. 
Screening includes a physical exam and blood tests to check your health.  We will ask you about 
your health history.  If you are a female who is able to have children, you will be asked about the possibility of you becoming pregnant while in the study.  You will be tested for pregnancy and for HIV .  During screening, we will collect some blood to store for research.  We will review the 
test results with you and tell you if the results show that you are eligible to join the study.   
PURPOSE OF THE STUDY  
This is the first study in people of this experimental vaccine for the prevention of Western  equine 
encephalitis virus , Eastern  equine encephalitis virus, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus 
infection.  The word “Encephalitis” means swelling of the brain, which occurs in some people who get infected by [CONTACT_180348].   “Experimental” means that the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) has not approved this study vaccine for general use in the public.  The FDA  allows it to 
be used for research only.  We do not know if this  vaccine works.   The main purpose of this 
study is to see if the experimental vaccine is safe and  if there are any side effects.  We also want  
to study the immune response to this vaccine.  
BACKGROUND   
These [ADDRESS_212203] seen in horses, that’s  why they were  named “equine”.   Western, 
Eastern and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses are very similar to each other and cause a 
similar type of disease in humans.  The virus es are passed to humans by [CONTACT_1046].  Infection 
from these viruses can cause fever, chil ls, discomfort, feeling sick, muscle pain and then 
headache, vomiting, restlessness, irritability, seizures , coma and death.

 STUDY PRODUCTS  
Vaccines are given to teach  the body to prevent or fight an infection.  In this study , we are testing 
an experimental  vaccine that was developed by [CONTACT_33862] (VRC) at the NIH. 
It is named  VRC -WEVVLP073 -00-VP, but is  also called  the “WEVEE ” vaccine .  This vaccine 
is intended to help the body to make an immune response to Western, Eastern and Venezuelan 
equine encephalitis viruses. 
The WEVEE vaccine: Most vaccines are made of proteins that are injected into a muscle. 
Proteins are natural substances that  the body and viruses use as building blocks. The WEVEE 
vaccine is a type of vaccine known as a virus- like particle (VLP)  vaccine. This is  because it is 
made up of  proteins from  the Western, Eastern and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses that 
make particles that look like the outside surface of these 3 viruses. The body’s immune system may respond to these particles by [CONTACT_180349] .  
However, there are no live or killed viruses in the vaccine, so you cannot get infect ed with any of 
these [ADDRESS_212204] called 
an adjuvant. Adjuvants are substances that may make your body’s response to the vaccine better.  The 
adjuvant in this study will be  alum inum hydroxide (alum).   Alum  has been used for over 60 years 
in billions of vaccinations with licensed vaccines and has been found to be safe.  The use of alum as an adjuvant in this study has been reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_1622]. 
ELIGIBILITY  
You are eligible to take part  in this study if  you are: 
• between 18 and 50 years of age  
• in general good health without significant medical problems  
• willing to get  the WEVEE vaccine  
• willing to give b lood samples for future research  
• additionally, if you are a female who is able to  become pregnant: willing to use birth 
control from at least 21 days before randomization through the end of the study 
STUDY PLAN  
About 30 people will take part in this study.  You will be in the study for about 36 weeks (8 
months) and have about 9 clinic visits and 2 telephone contacts .  You will get 2 vaccinations, 
each by [CONTACT_17838] (shot) in the upper arm muscle.  This is called an intramuscular “IM” injection.  
We will check you for any side effects from the vaccine.    
We will tell you if we learn anyth ing new during this study that might cause you to change your 
mind about staying in the study.  At the end of the study, we will tell you when study results may be available and how to learn about them.

 If you agree to take part in the study, you will be randomly assigned (like pulling a number from 
a hat) to get either : 
• The WEVEE vaccine alone (Group 1, Group 3, and Group 5) or,  
• The WEVEE vaccine mixed with alum (Group 2, Group 4, and Group 6).  
Once enrolled, you will know which group you are in.  
The study will start by [CONTACT_180350] a dose of 6 mcg in Group 1 or Group 2.  We 
will review the data after about 2 weeks to make sure th is vaccine dose has no safety concerns  
before we star t randomizing people to get the next dose of 30 mcg in Group 3 or Group 4. We 
will review the data for this dose after about 2 weeks to make sure this  vaccine dose has no 
safety concerns  before we start randomizing people to the 60 mcg dose in Group 5 or Group 6.

STORED SAMPLES  
Some of the blood we draw from you during the study will be used by [CONTACT_180351]. Blood samples  will be stored for future re search to learn more about WEVEE, vaccines, the immune system, and/or 
other medical conditions. 
The results from the research done with your stored samples are not meant to be used for medical 
care.  They will not be given to your health care provider and will not be put in your medical record.  
You may not take part  in this study if you are not willing to have your blood samples stored for 
future analysis.  
Labeling of Stored Samples :  Your stored samples will be labeled by a special code or number 
and not your personal information.  Only the study team can link this code to you.  Any 
identifying information about you (like name [CONTACT_40234]) will be kept as confidential as   
allowable  by [CONTACT_2371].  
Risks from Stored Samples :  The re is a risk of unplanned release of information from your 
medical records.  The chance that this information will be given to an unauthorized person 
without your permission is very small.  Possible problems with the unplanned release of information include discrimination  when applying for insurance or employment.  Similar 
problems may occur if you give  information yourself or agree to have your medical records 
released.  
Future Studies :  In the future, other investigators at NIH or outside of NIH may wish to study 
your sto red samples.  When the study team shares your stored samples, they will be marked with 
a code, but will not have any identifying information on them.  Some information about you, like your gender, age, health history, or ethnicity may also be shared with o ther researche rs.  Any

privacy of study participants . 
Your stored samples will be used only for research and will not be sold.  The research done with 
your s amples  may be used to make new products in the future, but you will not get payment for 
such products. 
Making your Choice: You cannot take part in this study if you do not want us to collect or store 
your blood samples. If you agree to take part in this study, you must also agree to let us keep any of your samples for future research.  
HUMAN DATA SHARING  
To advance science, it is helpful for researchers to share information they get from studying humans by [CONTACT_180352].   Researchers can then study the information 
combined from many studies to learn even more about health and diseases.  
If you agree to take part in this study, some of your data will be placed into one or more 
scientific databases.  We will remove identify ing information like your name, address, and birth 
date.  The data may then be used for future research and shared broadly for research purposes.  Only researchers who are approved to access the database may be able to see and use your information. You wil l not get any direct benefits from future research that uses your data and 
information.  
POSSIBLE STUDY RISKS  
Possible  risks of injections:  Temporary stinging, pain , redness, soreness, itchiness, swelling, 
bruising, or a cut in the arm.  There is a very s mall chance of infection.  
Possible  risks of any vaccine:  Fever, chills, rash, aches and pains, nausea, headache, dizziness, 
and feeling tired and/or unwell.  These reactions are usually greatest within the first [ADDRESS_212208] 1 to 3 days.  Over-the-counter medicine, like acetaminophen 
(Tylenol) or ibuprofen, may be used to help relieve these symptoms.   
Very rarely, a serious allergic reaction may occur shortly after any vaccination.  This is called 
“anaphylaxis” and may be life -threatening.  While you are waiting in the clinic after the 
vaccination, we will watch you for anaphylaxis.  Treatment for anaphylaxis will be given right 
away if it occurs.   
Possible  risks  of blood d rawing :  Pain, bleeding, bruising, feeling lightheaded, fainting , or 
rarely, infection at the site where the blood is taken. 
Possible  risks of WEVEE  Vaccine:   The WEVEE  vaccine has not been given to people before 
and it may have unknown risks or side effects .  It has been tested in mice  and monkeys.  The 
vaccine did not have any severe side effects and met the safety criteria to be tested in humans.  In 
a study  of a similar product, a chikungunya virus VLP vaccine was well tolerated with no 
reported joint pain or fever after vaccination.  No seri ous adverse events were reported .   
Possible  risk of aluminum hydroxide s uspension:   Aluminum adjuvants have been found to be 
safe for over [ADDRESS_212209] been associated with reactions of 
the skin (erythema), bumps in the skin (subcutaneous nodules), contact [CONTACT_180353].

 Possible r isks during Pregnancy :  We do not know the possible effects of the study vaccines on 
a fetus or nursing infant.  Women who are able to become pregnant must have a negative 
pregnancy test before each study injection and agree to practice adequate birth control beginning at least [ADDRESS_212210] also tell the clinic if you think that you are or might  be pregnant during this study.  If 
you become pregnant, you will not get any  more  injections.  However, you will be asked to 
continue with follow- up visits so we can check your health .  You will also  be asked about the 
outcome of your pregnancy.  
Possible  other r isks:  The safety of the vaccine tested  in this study is unknown.  It is unknown if 
the study injection will affect how you respond to any future infection with WEVEE or to any other WEVEE vaccines that you may get in the future. 
You may not donate blood at a blood bank while taking part in this study .  You may not donate 
blood for one year after your last study in jection.  
POSSIBLE BENEFITS  
This study is not designed to benefit you or protect you from infection from these viruses.  Others may benefit in the future from the information that will be learned from the study . 
COSTS TO YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION 
There are no costs to you for taking part  in this study.  We will not charge you or your insurance 
carrier for any health evaluations or services.  You or your health insurance will have to pay for 
all costs for m edical care that you get outside this study.  It is possible that you may  have some 
costs  that are not covered by [CONTACT_180354] .

 APPENDIX IV: ASSESSMENT OF RELATIONSHIP TO VACCINE  
AND  
GRADING SEVERITY OF ADVERSE EVENTS

PROTOCOL VRC 313, VERSION 1.0  PROTOCOL DATE: JANUARY 9 , 2019  
 
Page 61 of 66 Assessment of Causality Relationship of an Adverse Event to Study Vaccine:  
The relationship between an adverse event (AE) and the vaccine will be assessed by [CONTACT_178140]. 
Definite ly Related . The AE and administration of study agent are related in time, and a 
direct association can be demonstrated.  
Probably Related . The AE and administration of study agent are reasonably related in 
time, and the AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_33857].  
Possibly Related . The AE and administration of study agent are reasonably related in 
time, but the AE can be explained equally well by [CONTACT_33858]. 
Not Related . There is not a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study 
agent.  
For purposes of preparing data reports in which AE attributions are limited to “ Related ” or “Not 
Related ”, in this protocol, the “Definitely, Probably and Possibly” attributions  will be  mapped 
to the “Related” category.  The definitions that apply when these two categories alone are used are as follows:  
Related  – There is a reasonable possibility that the AE may be related to the study agent.  
Not Related  – There is not a r easonable possibility that the AE is related to the study 
agent.  
Grading the Severity of Adverse Events:  
The FDA Guidance for Industry (September 2007): “Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials” is the basis for the severity grading of AEs in this protocol. Several modifications were made to the table as follows: 
“Emergency room visit” is not automatically considered a life -threatening event; these 
words have been removed from any “grade 4’ definition where they appear in the 
table copi[INVESTIGATOR_33786]. 
Any laboratory value shown as a “graded” value in the table that is within the 
institutional normal range will not be severity graded or recorded as an AE. 
Severity grading  for hemoglobin decrease on the basis of the magnitude of decrease from 
baseline is not applicable at the grade 1 level; only absolute hemoglobin will be used to define grade [ADDRESS_212223] 
(Erythema/Redness and Induration/Swelling) included added text “requiring medical attention”.  
[ADDRESS_212224] was rem oved from the definition for PT increase. 
 
When not otherwise specified in the table, the following guidance will be used to assign a 
severity grade:

Grade 5 (Death):   Death is assigned a Grade 5 severity.

Purpose of the Letter of Amendment   
The purpose of this LoA is to update the protocol as described below. New text is shown in bold, 
deleted text in  strikethrough.  
 1. Title  page 
Correct a typo in the IND number as follows: BB-IND [PHONE_3861]  
 
2. Section 4.1, Inclusion Criteria  
Clarify inclusion citerion #9 as follows: “White blood cell (WBC) and  differential either within 
institutional normal range or accompanied by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_128147]”  3. Section 4.2.2, Screening  
Since a witness signature [CONTACT_180379], the following text  is to be modified as 
follows: “Before screening procedures can be performed, informed consent must be obtained, and the form must be signed, dated and timed by [CONTACT_180355] a witness. Any member of the research/clinical team can be a witness, but a 
consenter and a witness should not be the same person at the same time.” 
 
4. Section 4.2, Clinical Procedures and Evaluations 
Add a new sub- section “ Birth Control ” to clarify that: 
• Adequate methods of reversible/temporary birth control  for women generally include: 
abstinence; condoms, male or female, with or without a spermicide; diaphragm or cervical 
cap with spermicide; intrauterine devices and other prescription methods (such as contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], hormone implants, injections, patches and others); or a male partner 
who has previously undergone a vasectomy. 
 
• Permanent birth control for women  include s: 
 
- Hysterectomy or partial hysterectomy are both forms of permanent birth control 
- Tubal ligation or Essure implant:  FDA has prevented sales of Essure in the U.S. since 
Dec. 2018, but health care providers may continue to implant current devices for 1 year 
from date of purchase if they review the black box warning and “Patient -[CONTACT_180386]” with  the patient.  

− M
enopausal (menses ceased for at least 1 year and no other biological or physiological 
cause in medical history)  
Women who have permanent birth control do not need pregnancy testing .  
 
5. A

- U
nder “Study Plan” clarify that the length of the study is 9 months as follows: “ You 
will be in the study for about 36 weeks (8 9 months) and have about 9 clinic visits and 
2 t

Volume (blood volumes increased  by 1 m L) is attached  
 
No changes to the to the study conduct, subject’s risks and to content of the informed consent are 
indicated based on this LoA. 
The changes described herein will be incorporated into the next version of protocol VRC 313 if amended  in the future. 
Also with this LoA, we submit for approval a modified Assessment of Understanding (AoU) to which we added a line to indicate the time when the AoU was conducted .

You Are Being Asked to Be in a Research Study 
Concise presentation of key concepts 
 
You are being asked to be in a research study. A research study is designed to answer a scientific question. If 
you agree and are eligible to be in the study, you will be one of up to 40 people who are participating in this 
study at Emory.  
 
Why is this study being done?  
This study is being done to answer the questions: Is the WEVEE vaccine safe and tolerable to give people? Is 
it safe and tolerable at all three different dose levels? Is it safe and tolerable both with and without adding 
aluminum hydroxide (alum) to the vaccine? You are being asked to be in this research study because you are 
between the ages of [ADDRESS_212253] to be in the study?  
It is your decision to be part of this research study. You do not have to be in it. Before you make your decision, 
you should take time to learn about the study. 
 
What do I have to do if I choose to participate in this study? 
If you are eligible and want to participate in the study, you will participate for 9 months (9 study visits).  The 
researchers will ask you to do the following : receive [ADDRESS_212254] blood samples drawn and keep a symptom diary after 
each injection.  ALL study procedures will be paid for by [CONTACT_1758].    
 
Is this study going to help you?  
This study is not designed to benefit you directly. If you are in the study, you will be helpi[INVESTIGATOR_180310] .  
 
What are the risks or discomforts I should know about before making a decision?   
The study will take time. The vaccine that is being tested may not work and may even cause harm. All studies 
have some risks.  Some risks are relatively small, like being bored or losing time.  Some are more serious – for 
this study, these include irritation at the injection site, allergic reaction, flu-like symptoms, loss of privacy, and 
breach of confidentiality.  A fu ll list of expected risks, their frequency and severity are in the “What are the 
possible risks and discomforts?” section of this document.  
 
Alternatives to Joining This Study 
You may choose not to participate in this study. If you do choose to participate, you may change your mind and 
withdraw from the study at any time. 
 
Costs 
You WILL NOT have to pay for any of the study procedures. 
 
What Should I Do Next?

You can take a copy of this consent form, to keep. Feel free to take your time thinking about whether you 
would like to participate. You may wish to discuss your decision with family or friends. Do not sign this consent 
form unless you have had a chance to ask questions and get answers that make sense to you.  By [CONTACT_103820], you will not give up any legal rights. 
 
A description of this clinical trial will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, as required by U.S. law. This 
Web site will not include information that can identify you. At most the Web site will include a summary of the 
study  results. You can search this Web site at any time. 
 
What is the purpose of this study? 
The purpose of this study is to test an experimental vaccine against viral encephalitis. This is the first study in 
people of this experimental vaccine for the prevention of Western equine encephalitis virus, Eastern equine 
encephalitis virus, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus infection.  The word “Encephalitis” means 
swelling of the brain, which occurs in some people who get infected by [CONTACT_180348].  “Experimental” means 
that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved this study vaccine for general use in the public.  
The FDA allows it to be used for research only.  We do not know if this vaccine works.  The main purpose of 
this study is to see if the experimental vaccine is safe and if there are any side effects.  We also want to study 
the immune response to this vaccine. 
 
Western, Eastern and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses are very similar to each other and cause a 
similar type of disease in humans. These [ADDRESS_212256] seen in horses; that’s why they were named 
“equine”.  The viruses are passed to humans by [CONTACT_1046].  Infection from these viruses can cause fever, 
chills, discomfort, feeling sick, muscle pain and then headache, vomiting, restlessness, irritability, seizures, 
coma, and death. There are no viruses in the vaccine, and therefore you can’t get infected by [CONTACT_29500]. 
 
We expect that 30-40 people will receive a vaccine on this study. In order to find enough people, we may 
screen up to 120 people .

What is the vaccine being used in this study? 
Vaccines are given to teach the body to prevent or fight an infection.  In this study, we are testing an 
experimental vaccine that was developed by [CONTACT_33862] (VRC) at the National Institutes of 
Health (NIH). It is named VRC-WEVVLP073- 00-VP; it is also called the “WEVEE” vaccine.   This vaccine is 
intended to help the body to make an immune response to Western, Eastern and Venezuelan equine 
encephalitis viruses. 
 
The WEVEE vaccine: Most vaccines are made of proteins that are injected into a muscle. Proteins are natural 
substances that the body and viruses use as building blocks. The WEVEE vaccine is a type of vaccine known 
as a virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine. This is because it is made up of proteins from the Western, Eastern and 
Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses that make particles looking like the outside surface of these 3 viruses. 
The body’s immune system may respond to these particles by [CONTACT_180349].  
 
However, there are no live or killed viruses in the vaccine, so you cannot get infected with any of these [ADDRESS_212257] you from Western, Eastern and Venezuelan equine encephalitis 
viruses’  infection. 
 
Some people in this study will get the WEVEE vaccine mixed with another study product called an adjuvant. 
Adjuvants are substances that may make your body’s response to the vaccine better.  The adjuvant in this 
study will be aluminum hydroxide (alum).  Alum has been used for over 60 years in billions of vaccinations with 
licensed vaccines and has been found to be safe.  The use of alum as an adjuvant in this study has been 
reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_1622]. 
 
Who can take part in this study?  
You may be eligible to take part in this study if you are: 
 between 18 and 50 years of age 
 in general good health without significant medical problems  
 willing to get the WEVEE vaccine 
 willing to give blood samples for future research  
 Additionally, if you are a female who is able to become pregnant: willing to use birth control from at 
least 21 days before randomization through the end of the study 
 
What will I be asked to do? 
 
Screening  
Before you can take part in this experimental study, your health will be checked so we can decide if you qualify 
to participate.  You will need to sign this consent form before screening.  If you qualify, then you may take part 
in the vaccine study. 
 
Screening includes a physical exam and blood tests to check your health, including for HIV.  We will ask you 
about your health history.  If you are a female who is able to have children, you will be asked about the 
possibility of you becoming pregnant while in the study.  You will be tested for pregnancy either by [CONTACT_180357].  During screening, we will collect some blood to store for research.  We will review the test 
results with you and tell you if the results show that you are eligible to join the study.   
 
Study Procedures 
About 30 to 40 people will take part in this study.  You will be in the study for about 36 weeks (9 months) and 
have about 9 clinic visits and 2 telephone contacts.  You will get 2 vaccinations, each by [CONTACT_17838] (shot) in the 
upper arm muscle.  This is c alled an intramuscular “IM” injection.  We will check you for any side effects from

We will tell you if we learn anything new during this study that might cause you to change your mind about 
staying in the study.  At the end of the study, we will tell you when study results may be available and how to 
learn about them. 
 
If you agree to take part in the study, you will be randomly assigned (like pulling a number from a hat) to get 
either: 
 The WEVEE vaccine alone (Group 1, Group 3, and Group 5) or,  
 The WEVEE vaccine mixed with alum (Group 2, Group 4, and Group 6).  
 
Once enrolled, you will know which group you are in.  
 
The study will start by [CONTACT_180350] a dose of 6 mcg in Group 1 or Group 2.  We will review the 
data after about 2 weeks to make sure this vaccine dose has no safety concerns before we start randomizing 
people to get the next dose of 30 mcg in Group 3 or Group 4. We will review the data for this dose after about 
2 weeks to make sure this vaccine dose has no safety concerns before we start randomizing people to the 60 
mcg dose in Group 5 or Group 6.

research only, to study your immune response to the vaccine.  Results of these research tests are not used to 
check your health and will not be given to you. 
 
Who owns my study information and samples? 
If you join this study, you will be donating your samples and study information.   You will not receive any 
compensation if your samples or information are used to make a new product. If you withdraw from the study, 
data and samples that were already collected may be still be used for this study.   
 
Stored Samples 
Some of the blood we draw from you during the study will be used by [CONTACT_180358]. Blood samples will be stored for future research to 
learn more about WEVEE, vaccines, the immune system, and/or other medical conditions. 
 
The results from the research done with your stored samples are not meant to be used for medical care.  They 
will not be given to your health care provider and will not be put in your medical record.  
 
You may not take part in this study if you are not willing to have your blood samples stored for future 
analysis. 
 
Labeling of Stored Samples :  Your stored samples will be labeled by a special code or number and not your 
personal information.  Only the study team can link this code to you.  Any identifying information about you (like 
name [CONTACT_40234]) will be kept as confidential as allowable by [CONTACT_2371]. 
 
Risks from Stored Samples:   There is a risk of unplanned release of information from your medical records.  
The chance that this information will be given to an unauthorized person without your permission is very small.  
Possible problems with the unplanned release of information include discrimination when applying for 
insurance or employment.  Similar problems may occur if you give information yourself or agree to have your 
medical records released. 
 
Future Studies:   In the future, other investigators at NIH or outside of NIH may wish to study your stored 
samples.  When the study team shares your stored samples, they will be marked with a code, but will not have 
any identifying information on them.  Some information about you, like your gender, age, health history, or 
ethnicity may also be shared with other researchers.  Any future research studies using your samples will be 
conducted in a way that protects the rights and privacy of study participants.

may be used to make new products in the future, but you will not get payment for such products. 
 
Making your Choice: You cannot take part in this study if you do not want us to collect or store your blood 
samples. If you agree to take part in this study, you must also agree to let us keep any of your samples for 
future research. 
 
What are the possible risks and discomforts? 
Possible  risks of injections:  Temporary stinging, pain, redness, soreness, itchiness, swelling, bruising, or a 
cut in the arm.  There is a very small chance of infection. 
 
Possible  risks of any vaccine:  Fever, chills, rash, aches and pains, nausea, headache, dizziness, and 
feeling tired and/or unwell.  These reactions are usually greatest within the first [ADDRESS_212261] 1 to 3 days.  Over-the-counter medicine, like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen, may be used 
to help relieve these symptoms.   
 
Very rarely, a serious allergic reaction may o ccur shortly after any vaccination.  This is called “anaphylaxis” and 
may be life-threatening.  While you are waiting in the clinic after the vaccination, we will watch you for 
anaphylaxis.  Treatment for anaphylaxis will be given right away if it occurs.   
 
Possible  risks of blood drawing:  Pain, bleeding, bruising, feeling lightheaded, fainting, or rarely, infection at 
the site where the blood is taken. 
 
Possible  risks of WEVEE Vaccine:  The WEVEE vaccine has not been given to people before and it may 
have unknown risks or side effects.  It has been tested in mice and monkeys.  The vaccine did not have any 
severe side effects and met the safety criteria to be tested in humans.  In a study of a similar product, a 
chikungunya virus VLP vaccine was well tolerated with no reported joint pain or fever after vaccination.  No 
serious adverse events were reported.   
 
Possible  risk of aluminum hydroxide suspension:   Aluminum adjuvants have been found to be safe for 
over [ADDRESS_212262] been associated with reactions of the skin (erythema), 
bumps in the skin (subcutaneous nodules), contact [CONTACT_180359].   
 
Possible risks during pregnancy :  We do not know the possible effects of the study vaccines on a fetus or 
nursing infant.  Women who are able to become pregnant must have a negative pregnancy test before each 
study injection and agree to practice adequate birth control beginning at least [ADDRESS_212263] also tell the clinic if you think that you are or might be pregnant during this study.  If you become 
pregnant, you will not get any more injections.  However, you will be asked to continue with follow-up visits so 
we can check your health.  You will also be asked about the outcome of your pregnancy. 
 
Possible  other risks:  The safety of the vaccine tested in this study is unknown.  It is unknown if the study 
injection will affect how you respond to any future infection with WEVEE or to any other WEVEE vaccines that 
you may get in the future. You may not donate blood at a blood bank while taking part in this study.  You may 
not donate blood for one year after your last study injection.  
 
It is possible that the researchers will learn something new during the study about the risks of being in it.  If this 
happens, they will tell you about it. Then you can decide if you want to continue to be in this study or not.  You 
may be asked to sign a new consent form that includes the new information if you decide to stay in the study.

Will I benefit directly from the study?  
This study is not designed to benefit you or protect you from infection from these viruses.  Others may benefit 
in the future from the information that will be learned from the study. 
 
Will I be compensated for my time and effort? 
You will be compensated for your time and inconvenience as follows for study visits: Screening Visit (1 visit): 
$40; Vaccination Visits (2 visits): $ 80 each ; Follow Up Visits (6 visits) : $60 each. 
 
We may ask you to do extra visits to repeat lab tests or to further assess a safety concern. In those cases, you 
will receive $[ADDRESS_212264] completed. You will get $ [ADDRESS_212265] (ClinCard) that automates 
reimbursements. The ClinCard will be provided by [CONTACT_180360] (screening).  
 
All payments are made using a personal payment card. We issue this to you for free. The payment 
card is a prepaid debit card. It can be used exactly like a MasterCard. We load money onto your card 
electronically every time you need to be paid. The card scheme is run by [CONTACT_180361], an independent 
company specializing in payments for research studies and clinical trials. To issue your card, we need 
to give Greenphire some of your personal information. Banks and other financial institutions can 
access this information if they need to verify your identity when you use your card.  
 
Emory University is required by [CONTACT_180362]. To do this, Emory 
University Department of Finance needs to keep your Social Security Number on file. We are asking 
you to allow us to communicate your name, address, date of birth, research study name [CONTACT_180381]. If you want to receive 
e-mail or text alerts when payments are made to you, we will ask you to provide your e-mail or phone 
number as well. All of this information will be stored on computers owned by [CONTACT_180363] e.  Greenphire 
will not have access to any other information collected during this study. Full instructions about using 
your card are included when we issue it. Please ask if you have any questions or concerns about the 
card scheme.  
 
We would also like the option of compensating you in the form of cash, check or gift card if ClinCard 
accessibility is not available.  You will be asked to fill out a tax form, including your Social Security or 
Taxpayer Identification Number, in order to be reimbursed, depending on the amount and method of 
payment. Some payment methods involve mail coming to your house, which may be seen by [CONTACT_180364]. You can decline payment if you are concerned about confidentiality, or you can 
talk to the study team to see if there are other payment options. You will need to fill out a W-9 form. 
 
What are my other options?

The Certificate does not stop Emory from making the following disclosures about you: 
 
 Giving state public health officials information about certain infectious diseases. 
 Giving law officials information about abuse of a child, elderly person or disabled person. 
 Giving out information to prevent harm to you or others. 
 Giving the study sponsor or funders information about the study, including information for an audit or 
evaluation. 
 
Storing and Sharing your Information  
To advance science, it is helpful for researchers to share information they get from studying humans by [CONTACT_180365].  Researchers can then study the information combined from many studies to 
learn even more about health and diseases.  
 
If you agree to take part in this study, some of your data will be placed into one or more scientific databases.  
We will remove identifying information like your name, address, and birth date.  The data may then be used for 
future research and shared broadly for research purposes.  Only researchers who are approved to access the 
database may be able to see and use your information. You will not get any direct benefits from future 
research that uses your data and information.  
 
In general, we will not give you any individual results from the study of the samples you give us. If we find 
something of urgent medical importance to you, we will inform you, although we expect that this will be a very 
rare occurrence. 
 
Genetic Testing 
Some genetic tests are done in research studies to see if genetic differences in people cause different types of 
immune responses.  Genetic testing will not be done in this study, but may be performed on stored samples at 
later time.  If genetic tests are done at a later time, your name [CONTACT_180383].  These tests are not used to check your health and 
we will not tell you the results.

The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) is a federal law that generally makes it illegal for health 
insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you based on your 
genetic information. This law generally will protect you in the following ways:  
• Health insurance companies and group health plans may not request your genetic information that we 
get from this research. 
• Health insurance companies and group health plans may not use your genetic information when 
making decisions regarding your eligibility or premiums.  
• Employers with [ADDRESS_212267] genetic discrimination by [CONTACT_55173], 
disability insurance, or long-term care insurance, and does not apply to employers with less than 15 
employees. 
 
In addition to GINA, the State of Georgia has laws that prohibit insurers from using genetic testing information 
for any non-treatment purpose.  However, like GINA, this state law protection has exclusions: life insurance 
policies, disability income policies, accidental death or dismemberment policies, Medicare supplement policies, 
long-term care insurance policies, credit insurance policies, specified disease policies, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_180311], blanket accident and sickness policies, franchise policies issued on an insurance policy written as a 
part of workers’ compensation equivalent coverage, or other similar limited accident and sickness policies.  
 
Privilege  
In the State of Georgia, in some circumstances your genetic information has may have special legal 
protections cal led “privilege.” This means that the information cannot be used as evidence in a court. By 
[CONTACT_180366]. Other 
protections described in this form will still apply. There are also other confidentiality protections for research 
data in general under Georgia state law.    
 
Who will monitor the study?  
This study will be monitored by a group of physicians and scientists associated with the NIH.  This group will 
review the study information and will pay close attention to any reactions.  If there are serious side effects, 
study injections may be delayed or canceled. 
 
Your research study charts may be reviewed by [CONTACT_180367].   
 
Conflict of Interest 
The NIH developed the investigational product being used in this research study.  The results of this study 
could play a role in whether the FDA will approve the study product for sale at some time in the future.  If 
approved, the future sale of the study product could lead to payments to NIH and some NIH  scientists.  By U.S. 
law, government scientists are required to get such payments for their inventions.  You will not get any money 
from the development or sale of the product.   
 
Medical Record 
If you have been an Emory Healthcare patient before, then you already have an Emory Healthcare medical 
record.  If you have never been an Emory Healthcare patient, you do not have one.   An Emory Healthcare 
medical record will be made for you if an Emory provider or facility gives you any services or procedures for 
this study.

they cannot be removed, we will take steps to limit access to them.  
 
Emory Healthcare may create study information about you th at can help with your care.  For example, the 
results of study tests or procedures.  These study results will be put in your Emory Healthcare medical record. 
Anyone who has access to your medical records will be able to have access to all the study informa tion placed 
there.  The confidentiality of the study information in your medical record will be protected by [CONTACT_180368].  State and federal laws may not protect the research information from disclosure.  We will 
ask for your authoriza tion if we need to obtain any information from your medical record.  
 
We will also keep a separate research record of all study tests and procedures that we will use for research 
purposes.  For this study, those items include: safety laboratory tests and pregnancy tests. This research 
record will not be a part of your medical record.  
 
Tests and procedures done at non -Emory places may not become part of your Emory medical record. Also, if 
you decide to be in this study, it is up to you to let your other hea lth providers know.  
 
In Case of Injury  
If you believe you have become ill or injured from this research, you should contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Edupuganti  at 
telephone number . You should also let any health care provider who treats you know that you 
are in a research study.   
 
If you get ill or injured from being in the study, Emory will help you to get medical treatment. We will provide 
emergency treatment for any immediate reactions to the study products at the Hope Clinic. Neither Emory nor 
the sponsor will pay for your medical treatment  you may receive outside of the Hope Clinic. Your insurer will be 
billed for your treatment costs.  If you do not have insurance, or if your insurance does not pay, then you will 
have to pay these costs.    
 
Emory and the spo nsor have not, however, set aside any money to pay you if you are injured as a result of 
being in this study or to pay for this medical treatment. For Emory, the only exception is if it is proven that your 
injury or illness is directly caused by [CONTACT_180369]. “Negligence” is the failure to follow 
a standard duty of care. You do not give up any legal rights you may have by [CONTACT_55825], including any 
right to bring a claim for negligence.  
 
Costs  
There will be  no costs to you fo r participating in this study, other than basic expenses like transportation . You 
will not be charged for any of the research activities.  If the study procedures result in any medical 
complications that would not fall under “injury” as discussed above, the  cost of treatment for those 
complications may be charged to you or your insurance.   
 
Withdrawal from the Study  
Your participation in this study is completely voluntary.  You can choose to stop taking part in the study at any 
time.  There is no penalty or  loss of benefits for choosing to leave the study.  
 
If you get the first injection but not the second, we still want you to continue with all planned follow -up visits 
until the end of the study.  It is important that we continue to check your health even i f you do not get the 
second vaccination.

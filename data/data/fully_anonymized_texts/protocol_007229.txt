 Low Versus Moderate to High Dose Vitamin D for Prevention of COVID -19 
 
I. Background:  
 
There is an urgent need for effective interventions to prevent  and treat  COVID -19.Vitamin D deficiency has 
recently been  identified as  potentially  contributing to  the  spread of COVID -19 and vitamin D  supplementation has 
been identified as having potential in prevention and treatment.1 There is evidence that vitamin D can prevent 
or improve outcomes in many infectious and inflammatory conditions,  including acute and chronic respi[INVESTIGATOR_58776], and an increasing understanding of its immunomodulatory  and anti -inflammatory functions. A recent 
meta -analysis  found  a 70%  reduction  in viral  respi[INVESTIGATOR_297713] D deficiency 
randomized to vitamin D treatment.[ADDRESS_363311] that nearly  half the  US population  is vitamin  D deficient,  with higher  rates  among persons  with  darker  
skin  and/or lower  sun  exposure,  including those  living  in higher  latitudes  in the  winter,  nursing  home  residents  and  
health care  workers,  who  also  have greater  risk of COVID -19.3,4,5,[ADDRESS_363312] recently analyzed internal data at the University of  Chicago Medicine and found that the risk  of 
testing positive for COVID -19 is 77% higher for vitamin D deficient  persons who are not treated.[ADDRESS_363313] 
been  attributed  to vitamin  D dosages  that  are  too  low,  infrequent,  or fail to  account  for  baseline  vitamin  D levels,  
dietary  sources  or sun  exposure.   Dose  is very  important;  the  recommended  daily  allowance  (RDA)  of 600 IU/day  
and  definition  of sufficient  level  (≥30  ng/ml)  are  based  on effects  on bone  heath,  not immune  function,  for  which  
needs  are  not  known.  The  Institute  of Medicine  (IOM)  has  recommended  4,000IU/day  as safe  for  regular  
consumption  but  did  not  recommend  higher  doses  based  on the  lack  of clear  evidence  of benefit  for  higher  doses  
and  some evidence of possible toxicity, especially hypercalcemia and resulting falls in older persons.11 
However,  humans  evolved  under  conditions  of sun  exposure  that  would  produce  10,000- 25,000  IU/day  – far  more 
than  recommended  by [CONTACT_297734], and lifeguards have vitamin D levels of 50 -100 ng/ml.[ADDRESS_363314] found low rates of side effects (e.g., hypercalcemia) with doses as high as 10,000 IU/day.13 
Experimental studies to define  ideal  vitamin  D dosing  are  justified  in populations  with  different  needs  for,  risks  of, 
and  preferences  related  to vitamin  D treatment.  Randomizing  subjects  to a minimal dose of vitamin D (e.g., 400 
IU/day) or a high dose (e.g.,  10,000 IU/day) might  seem  to maximize  statistical  power  to assess  the  effectiveness  
of vitamin  D in COVID -19. However, some potential research subjects may consider the high dose to carry 
unnecessary risks , so we propose offering subjects the option to be randomized to moderate dos e, 
4,000IU/day, if they are not comfortable to maximize participation. 
 
In this context, the proposed study is innovative most importantly because it proposes to perform a randomized 
clinical trial to prevent COVID- 19.  
 
II. Purpose : 
 
We propose to seek to recruit participants  to be randomized  to low versus high (10,000 IU/day) or low versus 
moderate ( 4,000 IU/day) dose vitamin D  and  pool  these  populations  for  our  primary  analyses.  The  study  will  focus  
on health care workers  and other individuals from Chicagoland communities  with  elevated  risk  of exposure  to 
COVID -19.  In addition to their high exposure rates to COVID -19, focusing  on health care workers is also useful 
because they have high rates of vitamin D deficiency due to indoor work and long hours, are likely to tolerate 
high  doses  of vitamin  D given  their  generally  good  health,  and  have  ready  access  to monitoring  for  dose  toxicity.  In 
addition to HCWs, we have decided to expand our focus to include other adults in Chicagoland communities. 
Due to vaccine distribution in the coming months prioritizing HCWs, we want to offer the potential benefits of 
vitamin D in COVID- [ADDRESS_363315] prioritized access to vaccines, or choose to be 
vaccinated at present. Thus,  our  overall  aim  is to compare  the  risks  of COVID -19 in health  care  workers  and 
Vitamin D Intervention           Version 21   Updated 10.31.2024

 other Chicagoland adults at  increased  risk  of COVID -19 randomized to low  (400 IU/day)  vs. moderate  
(4,000 IU/day)  or high  (10,000 IU/day)  dose  vitamin  D. Our specific  aims  are:  
 
Aim 1:  To compare  the risk  of developi[INVESTIGATOR_297714] -[ADDRESS_363316]  willingness  to be randomized  
to different  doses.  
 
Aim 2:  To compare COVID -[ADDRESS_363317] of vitamin D may be to decrease symptomatic disease we  hypothesize  that there may 
be little or no  difference  in seroconversion.   
 
Aim 3:  To compare  COVID -19 outcomes  (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  ICU  stay,  ventilator  use,  death)  in health care workers  
and other Chicagoland community members   at increased risk of COVID -[ADDRESS_363318] 
immune response in the context of COVID -19. Therefore, we are adding additional Aims 4- 6. 
 
Aim 4: Create a biobank of PBMCs from a panel of 500 individuals with well characterized levels of 
vitamin A and D.  We propose to cryopreserve PBMCs derived from ~[ADDRESS_363319] of genetics to inter -individual differences in immune response and its 
interaction with vitamin A and D levels .  
  
Aim 5: Evaluate the impact of vitamin A and D levels on immune function.  We will 
perform  immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_297715] a panel of 30 antibodies that allow characterizing the different 
immune cell populations found in circulation, as well as their functional status. Using these data we will ask if there is an association between the prevalence of certain immune cell population or functional potential and 
vitamin A and D levels.  
 
  
Aim 6: Evaluate the impact of vitamin A and D levels on PBMC gene expression levels.  We will 
perform  transcriptional profiling of PBMC from a panel of 100 individuals enriched for individuals on the two 
extremes of the distributions of vitamin A and D levels. These data will be used to identify changes in gene 
expression levels  that differ between individuals showing low - vs high- vitamin A/D levels.

 Protocol 20 -2183 will use existing samples drawn under this protocol (further described in Section III) to 
analyze the following aims:  
 
Aim 7: To test the hypothesis that oral vitamin D3 intervention will inhibit the renin-  angiotensin system and 
reduce the incidence and/or severity of C OVID -19 infections. A dose response will be tested in this study by 
[CONTACT_23992] 400 IU to 4,000 IU to 10,000 IU vitmin D3.  
 
III. Description of protocol methodology:  
 
Summary  
To meet our aims, we propose a 2,000- person two -arm, double- blinded randomized controlled trial in HCWs 
and other Chicagoland community adults at University of Chicago Medicine (UCM) and Rush University (RU) 
selected to ensure safe administration of low compared to moderate or high dose vitamin D that will randomize 
half the subjects to low dose vitamin D therapy ( 400 IU/day)  and half to  moderate ( 4,000 IU/day)  or high  
(10,000  IU/day).  
 During the consent process, s tudy participants will be able to choose between being randomized between the 
low versus high
 dose  strateg y or the low dose versus  moderate dose strategy. Moderate and high dose 
treatment participants will be combined  for  analysis  as described  below.  The  moderate  and  high  treatment  doses  
were  chosen  with  help  from  our  clinical  advisory  committee because  they are generally considered safe and 
potentially effective among persons who meet our inclusion criteria based on medical history and baseline laboratory values (normal calcium and PTH, and
 negative  COVID -19 antibodies).  The  low dose was selected to 
ensure that all subjects had a high likelihood of a total vitamin D intake that met the recommended daily 
allowance  (RDA).14,[ADDRESS_363320] for PTH >85pg/dL but have 
calcium levels <10mg/dL and low vitamin D ( <30ng/ mL) will be eligible to continue in the study because those 
who have elevated PTH, but low vitamin D and normal calcium likely have secondary hyperparathyroidism due 
to low vitamin D levels. However, since there is some risk that the PTH elevation in these patients is not due to 
low vitamin D,  but instead primary hyperparathyroidism , we will check their calcium levels [ADDRESS_363321] been previously disqualified but now 
meet the inclusion criteria to continue in our  study to see if they still would like to participate. If they would like 
to, we will dispense them their randomized dose of vitamin D and follow up with calcium testing in 
approximately one month.  Our exclusion criteria has therefore been modified to exc lude those with 
PTH>85pg/dL but with calcium ≥ 10mg/dL and normal levels of vitamin D ( ≥30ng/mL).  
 
Dose, Frequency, and Administration of the Intervention  
Subjects will receive one  bottle of a [ADDRESS_363322] any remaining pi[INVESTIGATOR_297716] 3-6 months of follow -up if recruited after October 1, 2022 . A low -dose treatment arm (400 IU) will be 
compared with those in the moderate ( 4,000 IU/day) to high (10,000 IU/day) treatment arm. Subjects will 
retrieve blinded bottles containing a 9- month supply of vitamin D at the DCAM pharmacy if they live or work 
closer to UCM,  and at the Rush University Professional Office building, [ADDRESS_363323]. Suite 739 if they 
live or work closer to Rush. In the event subjects are unable to pi[INVESTIGATOR_297717] D bottles in these physical 
locations, bottles will be mailed to an address they provide. The source of the intervention will be the University 
of Chicago Investigational Drug Service where the bottles will be distributed to DCAM and James Moy’s lab at 
Rush.  
 
1) Dosing.  The  proposed  trial  will  compare  high  dose  (10,000  IU/d)  or moderate  dose  (4,000  IU/d)  to low dose  
(400 IU/d)  vitamin  D as opposed  to lower  doses,  e.g.,  2,000 IU/d  maximum  dose  in the Harvard  trial.  Schwartz  et 
al. (left panel  below)  show  that  800  or 2000  IU/d produce  average  levels  of only  about  35  ng/ml  compared  to 40-45 
ng/ml  for 4000 IU/d and  55 ng/ml  for 50,000  IU/week. Data  from Mc  Cullough  et al. (Panel A,  B below)  shows  that  
long- term  administration  of 10,000  IU/d  produces  much  higher  steady  state  vitamin  D levels  (about  95 ng/ml)  com-
pared  to 5000  IU/d,  producing  about  60 ng/ml . Given  the  data  discussed  above  on uncertainty  about  the  optimal  
vitamin  D intake/lev els for immune function, this innovation in our proposed trial is potentially highly significant.  
  
 
2) Safety for higher dosing.  As stated above, there is strong ev idence that safety risks up to 10,000 IU/d are 
minimal. Nevertheless, our study  provides both frequent lab monitoring for side effects and education to enable 
subjects  to recognize and respond to any symptoms of side effects if they occur . We also screen out 
participants with co -morbidities that predispose them to adverse outcomes from higher dose vitamin D 
supplementation. We have another vitamin D/COVID -19 study in progress with medically complex  patients  that 
will provide data on effectiveness and safety under intensive monitoring in that population.  
 
Procedures and Materials  
 
Blood labs will be taken from subjects at intake, 3 months, 6 months and, if in the 9- month cohort,  9 months.  If 
subjects are in the 2023  cohort (defined as recruited on or after January 1, 2023 ) blood labs will be taken from 
subjects at intake, [ADDRESS_363324]. Labs for Rush subjects will be 
drawn by [CONTACT_297735].  
 
Intake labs will measure baseline calcium and PTH levels, presence of COVID -19 antibodies, baseline vitamin 
D levels , and vitamin A levels . Where possible given constraints related to sample storage, analysis and 
available funding for free vitamin D measurement, vitamin D measurements will include free vitamin D levels 
measured by [CONTACT_46096], as well as total vitamin D levels.  
 For Aim 7, Intake labs for UCM subjects will additionally measure vitamin D- binding protein (DBP) , RAS 
components  (Renin, Ang II, soluble ACE and ACE2), bradykinin, i nflammation markers  (IL-6, TNF -a, IL-1b and 
CRP ), and SARS- CoV-2 antibodies agains S -protein and N -protein.

Page 5 of 25 
 Follow -up labs (excluding the final lab) will measure PTH levels, calcium levels , vitamin A levels for those who 
have high baseline vitamin A, and vitamin D levels for monitoring of the intervention’s safety  and outcomes,  
and COVID -19 antibodies for monitoring of the outcome. Records of these levels will be kept by [CONTACT_297736].  
 
Final labs will measure calcium levels, vitamin D levels for monitoring of the intervention’s safety and 
outcomes, and COVID -[ADDRESS_363325] baseline labs in March 2023 and final labs in June 2023 (3 months 
later). This is due to the end of study funding in June 2023. This is further specified in Section IV, Table 4 below.  
 
Testing for calcium, PTH,  and vitamin D  will be done at UCM (UCMC, River East, or Ingalls) or Rush (James 
Moy’s lab) , with the site for each subject selected based on which site is most convenient for the subject . 
Vitamin A, which will be drawn only from UCM subjects, will be sent to an outside lab for analysis. Throughout 
the study period we will tell subjects about calcium, PTH and vitamin D  lab results only if they suggest a safety 
concern for which we would like them to seek care from a medical professional.  Except in the instance of a 
safety concern, s ubjects will be blinded to their vitamin A& D levels , calcium and PTH  throughout the study to 
ensure protocol compliance. At the end of their time in the study, we will provide test results to subjects as indicated in “Study Completion Email V4”. At the end of the intervention period for all participants in this 
protocol, we will unblind parti cipants to their vitamin D dose assignment as indicated in “Dose Unblinding Email 
V1”. We will do this at the end of the intervention for all participants because we, as the study team, are also 
currently blinded to dose assignments until the end of the intervention period for all participants. For 
participants who transition to participate in protocol 20- 0847, unblinding will occur at the end of the intervention 
period for all participants in that study. Blood draws for COVID -[ADDRESS_363326] baseline data on subjects’ current medications and supplements with doses (e.g., 
multivitamin, zinc, calcium, vitamin D), average time outside per day (specifying direct vs. indirect sun 
exposure), Fitzpatrick skin type, exercise habits, diet, sleep habits, possible COVID -19 symptoms such as 
fever, cough,
 GI problems,  and  other  influenza -like  symptoms.  Subjects  will  also  be asked  to report  suspected  
exposure  to the  virus  (e.g.  if a family  member  falls  ill),  specific  occupation,  and  demographic  information.  Subjects  
will  also  be asked  to evaluate  risks  of exposure. Participants  will  also  be asked  in the  intake  surveys  for  the  name  
[CONTACT_297766] D Intervention           Version [ADDRESS_363327]  of information  of 1-2 people  who  could  reach  them  and  answer  follow -up questions  if they  cannot  be 
reached  or answer  questions  themselves.  Follow -up surveys  at months  3, 6, and   9 will  ask  the  participant  (or  proxy  
if needed)  whether  the  participant  has  had  a clinically  confirmed  diagnosis  of COVID -19, and  the  date  if so,  ask  
about  rates  of study  medication adherence, and assess for changes in the intake questions about use of other 
supplements, sun exposure, diet, exercise, and COVID -[ADDRESS_363328] 
added some questions on the baseline and follow -up surveys that evaluate additional possible risk factors for 
COVID -19 outcomes.  These risk factors —hypertension,  diabetes, and mood—are shown to have possible 
linkages to vitamin D  levels . These factors are receiving increased attention in the context of COVID -19 risk 
and its relationship to low vitamin D levels.16 While available evidence suggests there is a link  between 
hypertension/cardiovascular disease17,18,19, diabetes and metabolism,20,21 depression22,23,24/anxiety25,  and 
vitamin D levels, to-date no causal relationship has been established. This is supported by [CONTACT_297737],17,18,[ADDRESS_363329], vitamin D, and 
these risk factors  by [CONTACT_297738], both already enrolled and new, about these factors.  
 
 
For Aims 4- 6, we will draw baseline vitamin A for 1,000 UCM subjects  and draw vitamin A 3 months later  for 
those UCM subjects who are high at baseline. Of these initial vitamin A samples, w e aim to cryopreserve 
samples from 500 individuals, and perform RNA sequencing on a subset of 100 individuals. Once we reach 
this number, we will submit an amendment removing these analyses from the consent form and the blood 
draw/analysis protocol. Becaus e cryopreservation and RNA sequencing involves obtaining 20mLs of additional 
blood from subjects and involves genetic sequencing, we will ask subjects in the consent form whether they 
would like to opt -in to provide more blood during their baseline visit f or these measurements.  
 
IV. Probable duration:  
 The study period, including recruitment, enrollment, and analysis, will last [ADDRESS_363330] until March 31, 2023, so one 
year longer,  to enroll our target of 2,000 subjects. Once enrolled, subjects’ participation will last up to [ADDRESS_363331] 
extension through June 30
th, 2023 and anticipate hearing back sometime Spring 2022 with an answer . Should 
we receive this second extension, we will continue the study through June 2023. In this case, w e will adapt to 
the study timeline specified in Table 3 and Table 4, rather than Tables  1 & 2, specified below.  In either 
scenario, some subjects will participate in our study for 9 months, and others for 3 -6 months, depending on 
when they are recruited to the study (see tables for thes e dates )_.Based on our understanding of vitamin D 
levels in the blood over time including seasonal variation, we believe subjects who participate on treatment for 
[ADDRESS_363332] our analyses for 
this cohort accordingly.

that some participants may not complete their surveys in time ("overdue participants"). We plan to continue to 
follow up with overdue participants beyond the study's end date to ensure that participants have the 
opportunity to complete their final survey. We will do so via multiple modalities (text , email and phone) and at 
different times of the day to increase response.

meeting)  DSMB will review longitudinal testing 
data by [CONTACT_297739] [ADDRESS_363344] , and 
at Rush University (RU)  on the near west side campus , Oak Park, and South Loop locations. Subjects will be 
recruited from all of these specified locations.  
 
Subjects closer to UCM will pi[INVESTIGATOR_297717] D bottles  at DCAM pharmacy , and subjects closer to RU will 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_297717] D bottles from  the Rush University Professional Office building, [ADDRESS_363345]. Moy’s 
laboratory on site. Venipuncture will be performed by [CONTACT_297740] & Immunology Clinical Research Site of Rush University Medical Center, in Suite 739 of the Rush 
Professional Building.  One of the tubes  of blood will be transported by a research assistant to the Rush 
University Medic al Center's Clinical Chemistry Laboratory for determination of PTH, calcium and vitamin D 
levels.  Another  tube of blood will be kept at the Allergy & Immunology Clinical Research Site for pi[INVESTIGATOR_7049]/drop

VI. Special precautions, including dose modifications  
 
Vitamin D Intervention           Version 21   Updated 10.31.2024  
 
Page 12 of 25 
 We will not make modifications of the vitamin D dose based on the study design. As described in Section XI, 
“Monitoring Subject Safety”, subjects will be advised to cease vitamin D supplementation if specific lab values  
 
VII. Description of experimental controls  and use of placebos :  
 
In this  2,000- person two- arm, double- blinded randomized controlled trial , we will randomize half the subjects to 
low dose vitamin D therapy ( 400 IU/day) , which will serve as the control group,  and half to moderate ( 4,000 
IU/day)  or high  (10,000  IU/day). Participants will have the option of being randomized to the high versus low 
strategy or the moderate versus low strategy. The  low dose was selected to ensure that all subjects had a high 
likelihood of a total vitamin D intake that met the recommended daily allowance  (RDA).  
 
VIII. Type and number of experimental subjects:  
 
We plan to recruit 2,000 health care workers  and other Chicagoland community members. HCWs will be 
primarily  employed at the University of Chicago Medicine (UCM) - Hyde Park , River East , or Ingalls,  and Rush 
University  (RU) at the Rush University Medical Center, Rush Oak Park Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and Rush South Loop clinics.  
At UCM, ~[ADDRESS_363348] been diagnosed with COVID -19 as of late June,  out of a reduced pool working non-
remotely of about 3,000 persons over 4 months, for a monthly incidence of about 2% of working HCWs per 
month. During the summer months, a s COVID -19 rates declined and stabilized in Chicago, the monthly 
incidence at UCM has fallen to about 1% per  working  HCW  per  month,  but  this  reflects  continued  closure  of most  
ambulatory  services,  which  are  now among the  highest  risk  services  given  COVID -19 testing  of all inpatients  but  
not outpatients. Indeed, our inpatient COVID -19 unit  has  reported  zero  HCW  infections. Thus the relative odds of 
infection appear to be several times higher in high  risk  HCWs  than  low  risk  HCWs.  In the  presence  of appropriate 
personal protective equipment, high risk HCW groups  based  on the  UCM experience and the literature are 
persons working in high volume ambulatory settings (e.g.,  primary  care,  ophthalmology), the emergency 
department, radiology, respi[INVESTIGATOR_297720], nursing, patient transport,  custodial  and  food  services.  We  will  
prioritize  recruitment of these groups,  and since ambulatory  care  is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_297721], we think that 3% is a 
reasonable estimate for the baseline monthly incidence in our study subjects.  We think this is a conservative 
estimate as it is similar to the rate in the general local population.  As COVID -[ADDRESS_363349] gaps in vaccines, and lower prority access to 
vaccines for many outside the health care/front line professions —all  resulting in potential lower rates of 
vaccination among the general population and a continued risk of infection.  
 
The sample size was chosen to have at least 80% power to detect a 25%  or larger decrease in the hazard of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_35910] -19 between study arms at p<0.05 assum ing a 30% baseline COVID -19 incidence rate over  
the study period, in line with the 3% per month incidence cited above.  
 
 
Individuals are eligible to enroll in the study if they:  
1. Are 18 years or older.  
2. Live or work in the Chicagloland area ( Illinois counties:  Cook, Lake, McHenry, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, 
Grundy, Will, and Kankakee; Indiana counties: Lake and Porter).  
3. Are interested in vitamin D as a potential preventive measure against COVID -19 in which they self -
administer a daily dose of vitamin D during the 9 -month study period.  
4. Are willing to attend the laboratory for drop -in appointments at UChicago Medicine, Ingalls Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  or 
Rush University Medical Center  every 3 months at up to 4 time points over up to a 9-month period for 
blood draws measuring COVID -19 antibodies, calcium, vitamin D and PTH levels.  
Vitamin D Intervention           Version 21   Updated 10.31.2024  
 
Page 13 of 25 
 5. Are willing to complete self -report measures at  up to 4 time points over the course of up to 9 months by 
[CONTACT_12550] a 15- minute survey at intake by [CONTACT_297743] 10- minute web -based follow -up 
surveys.  
 
Individuals are excluded from the study if  they: 
1. Report being pregnant , planning to become pregnant,  and/or report breastfeeding during the study 
period.  
2. Report a history of chronic kidney disease, including a history of abnormal GFR and/or creatinine.  
3. Report a history of hyperparathyroidism.  
4. Report a history of increased falls.  
5. Report a history of hypercalcemia.  
6. Report a history of gastrointestinal absorptive disorders, including having undergone bariatric surgery.  
7. Report a history of kidney stones ([ADDRESS_363350] year or 2 in lifetime).  
8. Report already taking more than 400 IU of vitamin D daily  as recommended by [CONTACT_134585] , excluding multivitamins and excluding supplements that include vitamin D and calcium 
together , unless permission is received from the prescribing health care provider to participate. In this 
case,  no more than 1,000 IU vitamin D may be taken daily in addition to the study medication and we 
would limit the subjects to participation in the low vs. moderate arm of the study, producing a maximum 
dose of 5,000  IU per day. We note that the NAM recommended a maximum dose of 4,000 IU per day 
without medical supervision based on evidence that 5,000 was safe and known uncertainty about the precision of dosing in 5,000 IU supplements available over the counter. Howev er, since we are testing 
the dosage of our 4,000 IU supplements to high precision and these  patients would be taking their 
original supplements with a labelled dose of 1,000 IU or less, we think that the combination of our 4,000 IU supplements and the pati ent’s original supplement of up to 1,[ADDRESS_363351] another study of vitamin D an COVID (IRB# 20-0847),  
in which we are not measuring these levels, for which it is more important to not substantially exceed 
NAM maximum level of 5,000 IU per day. The approach described here allows us to align the approach 
in these two studies.  
9. Report taking D2.  
10. Report a history of sarcoidosis.  
11. Screen positive for hypercalcemia (  at UCM, defined as >10.4  mg/dL and at Rush, defined as >11.2 
mg/dL) ) during the initial blood test . 
12. Screen positive for hyperparathyroidism (PTH> 85 pg/dL) during the initial blood test  with calcium 
≥10mg/dL and normal levels of vitamin D ( ≥30ng/mL)   
13. Have vitamin D levels of >100ng/mL at study start, or >250ng/mL during follow -up      
labs.  
14. Are unwilling to provide blood samples during quarterly blood tests.  
15. Are unwilling to take daily vitamin D.  
 
IX. Description of statistical analysis  
 
The higher doses we propose, with 4 ,000 or 10,000 IU/d are expected to maximize the vitamin D treatment 
effect if one exists compared to a lower high dose as in a  Harvard study  currently underway which explores 
2,000IU/day vitamin D . While the Harvard study gives vitamin D in the context of acute infection or household 
exposure so vitamin D levels may not respond quickly enough to affect outcomes (perhaps both for treatment 
and prevention), our proposed design seeks to raise vitamin D l evels in advance of sustained risk in a set of 
HCWs and other community members at increased risk of COVID -19, increasing both the likelihood of having 
therapeutic dosing and the underlying risk of COVID -[ADDRESS_363352], and 
therefore increases overall statistical power.  
 
Vitamin D Intervention           Version 21   Updated 10.31.2024  
 
Page 14 of 25 
 For our primary outcome of COVID -19 infection as measured by [CONTACT_297744] -
19 (or viral PCR when available) and secondary outcomes of COVID -19 antibody seroconversion and disease 
severity (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], ICU stay, ventilato r use, death), hazard models will be employed to assess the effect 
of each vitamin D dosing strategy on the outcome. We will first develop hazard ratios for between- group 
analyses on the primary outcome using log- rank tests, and then develop Cox proportional hazard models to 
model the hazard function on a set of covariates including but not limited to, moderate or high vitamin D dose, 
baseline vitamin D levels, age, gender, race, ethnicity, sun exposure, sleep habits, exposure of cohabitants, 
job type, and study site. We will also control for randomization date to adjust the underlying hazard function for 
COVID -[ADDRESS_363353] 80% power to detect a 25% or larger decrease in 
the hazard of developi[INVESTIGATOR_297722]-19 between study arms at p<0.05 assuming a 30% baseline 10 -month 
COVID incidence over the study period, in line with the 3% monthly incidence cited above. As finding that a 
higher dose has no effect or a paradoxical adverse effect on COVID incidence would both lead to use of a 
lower dose given even the small risks of higher dose vitamin D, Ruxson and Neuhauser would argue for use of 
a 1-sided test, resulting in 80% power to detect a 20% or larger decrease.  
 
X. Potential risks and benefits to subjects:  
 
Potential Risks  
A potential risk of this intervention is vitamin D -mediated hypercalcemia. Given the exclusion criteria which 
screens for those at increased risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_114236], th is risk is anticipated to be low and will be 
monitored for throughout the intervention period via quarterly lab draws regularly reviewed by [CONTACT_431], the 
DSMB, and the Clinical Advisory Committee. In addition, high doses of vitamin D have been associated with an 
increased risk of falls . Our exclusion criteria also attempts to minimize the likelihood of this risk by [CONTACT_297745][INVESTIGATOR_297723]. This risk will also be monitored in 
subject self -reports during survey administration. We believe this risk to be low in this study population. As with 
any study that involves blood draws, participants will also be exposed to the minimal risks of phlebotomy 
including pain, infection, and venous damage. These risks will be mitigated by [CONTACT_297746]. Since protected health information (PHI) is collected on web- based software, there is also a risk 
to loss of confidentiality, which we believe to be minimal. Precautions to minimize these risks are detailed 
below.  
 
Protections Against Potential Risks  
The risks as described in “Potential Risks” we believe to be unlikely and will be mitigated whenever possible. The nature of the intervention and all risks will be fully described to subjects, moreover, subjects will be 
informed that they can choose to dis continue and withdraw from the study at any time. Subjects can also 
choose to not answer any question on the survey. For the risk of loss to confidentiality, all members of the study team will maintain strict standards for confidentiality, further described in Section XIV and thus not 
repeated here. The risk of complications due to venipuncture will be mitigated by [CONTACT_297747]. The risks of complications due to higher doses of vitamin D will be mitigated 
with the exclusion criteria as outlined above during preliminary screening and through subject education of 
symptoms for fall risk. Vitamin D- mediated hypercalcemia will be mitigated by [CONTACT_297748]. Subjects at UCM will be referred to their primary care provider if they experience these 
symptoms or have calcium levels of 10.5- 12 mg/dL  and subjects at Rush will be referred to their primary care 
provider if they experience these symptoms or have calcium levels of 11.3- 12mg/dL. For all subjects, if  calcium 
laboratory values are 12.1mg/dL -14mg/dL, subjects will be advised to go to urgent care and if values are 
greater than 14 mg/dL subjects will be advised to seek care at an emergency room. Subjects will be provided

Page 15 of 25 
 with the pager number of an on -call physician at UCM and Rush primary care group that they can use in the 
event of emergent symptoms.  
 
Potential Benefits  
Health care workers (HCWs) and those who reside in diverse metropolitan communities with high community 
spread of COVID -19 are of special public health relevance because of their 1) increased exposure to COVID -
19, 2) frequent contacts with individuals  at increased risk of infection and adverse outcomes if infected, and 3) 
frequent contact [CONTACT_297749] s who could spread COVID -19. We intentionally do not seek a representative 
sample because our primary goal is to learn if vitamin D treatment is efficacious in r educing COVID -[ADDRESS_363354] of this work w ould be significant for the reasons above.  
 
XI. Monitoring of safety:  
 
The current study represents a multi -site clinical trial in which the risks inherent to the intervention are of 
minimal risk to participants given the long- standing use of vitamin D supplementation with few adverse events. 
The protocol’s exclusion criteria and monitoring plan limit the likelihood that subjects will develop a severe 
medical condition during the course of this study. Commensurate with these risks, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Meltzer, with 
support from the Clinical Advisory Committee and co- investigators Drs. Moy, Schram, Bandi, and Prochaska, 
will conduct regularly monitoring of safety which will be overseen by a formal Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The independent DSMB will be comprised of three experts, a Chair and two members, who will 
provide regular oversight for this multi -site study. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_297724] , one 
of whom will be the Chair. These individuals are senior faculty members and hold expertise in clinical trial 
oversight and design, biostatistics, endocrinology, pulmonology and critical care medicine.  
 
The protocol’s safety and monitoring guidelines as described below have been created in collaboration with the 
already -identified members of the Clinical Advisory Committee, a committee of interdisciplinary clinicians who 
will provide the PI [INVESTIGATOR_297725]. If funded, the protocol will be overseen by [CONTACT_297750]. The DSMB will work closely with the PI, co -investigators, and Clinical  Advisory Committee, monitoring 
the intervention on an ongoing basis and meeting quarterly to review intervention data and provide 
recommendations as needed for modifying the intervention. Study analysts will work with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-
Investigators to send l aboratory data to the DSMB regularly for review.  
 
Ensuring subject safety  
The proposed study will be supervised by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_297726], with oversight by [CONTACT_297751] (UCM BSD IRB). All 
subjects will undergo written informed cons ent. Additional safety precautions include: 1) exclusion of 
individuals for whom higher dose vitamin D supplementation is more likely to be unsafe, 2) written materials on possible side effects of vitamin D supplementation provided at consent (I.e., risk o f falls, symptoms of 
hypercalcemia), 3) monitoring of calcium levels to detect toxicity, 4) participants will be advised to report 
adverse events (email and study phone number provided), 5) independent testing of vitamin D supplements to 
ensure accurate po tency, 6) rigorous infection control practices to mitigate the spread of COVID -19 at 
UChicago Medicine where testing is performed and 7) well -trained research staff.  
 
Monitoring of the intervention 
To monitor for toxicity, calcium levels will be checked at study initiation to assess for baseline hypercalcemia 
and at each subsequent blood draw (3, 6, and 9 months) to monitor for incidental or study -induced 
hypercalcemia. If study participants are found to be hypercalcemic, they will be told to cease vitamin D

 supplementation. For UCM patients with a calcium level 10.5- 12 mg/dL and for Rush patients with a calcium 
level of 11.3- 12mg/dL, patients will be instructed to consult with their primary care physician. For patients with 
a calcium level of 12.1- 14 mg/dL, patients will be referred to urgent care. For patients with a calcium level 
greater than 14 mg/dL, patients will be referred to the emergency room. These participants will continue to 
undergo monitoring blood draws and surveys and may resume vitamin D suppl ementation per study protocol 
with a physician note. Based on conversations with our Clinical Advisory Board and prior studies, we expect very few people to become hypercalcemic due to study medication. The DSMB will also conduct an interim 
analysis of COV ID-[ADDRESS_363355] (DSMB) Charter  
 
Trial Monitoring The trial will be monitored by [CONTACT_297752], 
pulmonology, and biostatistics . The DSMB members are: Edward Naureckas, MD, DSMB Chair, Theodore 
Karrison, PhD, and George Bakris, MD.  
 
Monitoring Frequency  
The DSMB will meet to review initial laboratory values and quarterly  thereafter  to review the overall protocol 
administration, review adverse events, and trends in laboratory values for determination of safe progression of 
the study. DSMB members will schedule additional meetings as needed to review adverse events. In addition 
to these quarterly meetings, Board members, along with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706]- Investigators, will receive regular data 
reports from phlebotomy  with all subjects’ laboratory values, with higher values indicated. Board members will 
keep in close contact [CONTACT_118735] [INVESTIGATOR_7706]- Investigators to refer individual patients to seek outside care for high 
laboratory values, in addition to the resources provided to subjects to seek care, such as an on -call pager for 
primary care.  
 
Adverse Event Management  
Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems will be reported to members of DSMB 
by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_297727]. These events will be managed by [CONTACT_978], Co- PI, and Co -
Investigators at the direction of the DSMB and UChicago Medicine Biological Sciences Division Institutional Review Board.  
 
XII. Payment to subjects:  
 
N/A 
  
XIII. Procedures to obtain and record informed consent :  
 Consent will be sought by [CONTACT_297753] a virtual consent 
procedure (APPENDIX A). In the event a potential subject has difficulty with the virtual consent method, we will 
meet the subject in our research offices to sign the consent form in- person by [CONTACT_297754]. Since we are seeking healthy volunteers from the community , we do not believe 
any individual will require determination for capacity to consent.  
 
After a potential subject expresses interest via email , in-person,  or phone, potential subjects will complete the 
preliminary screening of self -reported underlying health conditions as described in the exclusion criteria via a 
screening phone call from the CRC/RA  and consent will be sought virtually . In rare instances when subjects 
have difficulty signing the consent form vitually, the RedCap eConsent will be provided to them in -person by 
[CONTACT_297755] . Both subjects who sign the consent form 
virtually and in- person will receive a signed copy of the consent form to the email address provided at the start 
of the RedCap eConsent form . For those signing in- person , signed consents will be printed by [CONTACT_32236].  
 
At the beginning of the consent process, subjects will be asked to verify their identity by [CONTACT_297756] a photo of their diver’s license, state ID, passport or employee ID.  They will be 
asked for their email address where a signed copy of the consent form will be sent for their records. In the 
consent form, subjects will be informed about the nature of the intervention, that they will be receiving a daily 
dose of vitamin D, either low or moderate/high, and must self -administer this dose each day. They will be 
informed about the nature of the intervention, that they are blinded to the dose they receive. Subjects will be 
Vitamin D Intervention           Version [ADDRESS_363356] a safety concern. They w ill be educated about the risks 
of the study as described above in “Potential Risks”. Subjects will be informed about what will be done if they 
are found to be hypercalcemic: First, they will be told to cease vitamin D supplementation. Subjects  at UCM  
with a calcium level 10.5 -12 mg/dL and at Rush with a calcium level 11.3 -12mg/dL will be instructed to consult 
with their primary care physician. All s ubjects with a calcium level of 12.1- 14 mg/dL will be referred to urgent 
care. All subjects with a calcium level greater than 14 mg/dL will be referred to the emergency room. These 
participants will continue to undergo monitoring blood draws and surveys and may resume vitamin D supplementation per study protocol with a physician note.  
 Subjects will then be instructed to select their randomization preference on the consent form. If a potential 
subject says they are already taking a supplement or supplements  that contains  2,000IUs or less  of vitamin D  
in total , they may continue to take those supplements  while part of the study , however, they will only be 
allowed to enroll in the arm that randomized them between [ADDRESS_363357] to screen for 
abnormal PTH and calcium levels, obtain baseline 25(OH) vitamin D levels, and determine the presence of 
COVID -[ADDRESS_363358] s, to improve compliance with vitamin D supplementation and 
screen for patients who may only be interested in joining the study to obtain baseline labs / antibody levels, 
subjects will be called and offered the opportunity to withdraw from the stu dy after initial lab results are 
available, prior to randomization. We will also tell subjects about their other lab results if they suggest a safety 
concern and are outside normal ranges outlined in the exclusion criteria. If potential subjects have declined to 
withdraw at this initial stage, we will proceed with randomization.  
 Summary of Consent Frorm Versions:  
 
For those consented March 31 2022- December 31, 2022:  We will use consent form V ersion 10  (UCMC) or 
Version 11 (Ingalls), both in English and Spanish. This is because these consent forms are written for those 
who participate in the study for 6 -9 months. Subjects who consent before October 1, 2022 will be in the study 
for 9 months . Subjects who consent on or after October 1, 2022 will be in the study for 6 months. This 
information is also clarified in these consent forms and in Table 3 of Section IV above. Version 10, like Version 8, has  language for opt -in labs while Version 11 does not. We will use consent form Version 4 for Rush 
subjects.  
 
For those who consented using UCM Consent Version 8 or 9 , or Rush Consent Version 3  (thus who consented 
on or after January 1, 2022 and in follow up for less than 6 months), we wish to allow for the option to re-
consent these subjects on UCM Consent Version 10 or 11, or Rush Consent Version 4,  to allow these subjects 
to participate in the study for a full 9- month period (and would thus receive 4 total blood tests and 4 follow -up 
surveys). This re- consent is entirely voluntary. If these subjects do not wish to re- consent, they will end their 
time in the study June 30, 2022.  
 For those consented January 2023- March 31, 2023:  We will use consent form Version 12 (UCMC) or 
Version 13 (Ingalls), both in English and Spanish. With the removal of the final PTH lab approved in 
Amendment 54, we will then use consent form Version 14 (UCMA) or Version 15 (Ingalls), both in English in 
Vitamin D Intervention           Version [ADDRESS_363359]  language for opt -in labs while Version 13 and 15 do not.  
 
 
XIV. Procedures to m aintaining  confidentiality:  
 
Electronic study data will be maintained on password- protected, encrypted devices in locked offices at UCM 
and RUMC , including internally using the standard of minimum necessary PHI, assigning subject IDs to each 
subject and using that as the mode of identification rather than name [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or MRN . All study staff will have up -
to-date HIPAA training. Consent forms will be stored in HIPPA -compliant lab share drives maintained by [CONTACT_297757]. Paper forms as related to the study will be stored in locked filing cabinets at UCM and RUMC  in the site PI’s office suites .

XVI. Description of recruiting methods :  
 
Given the current risk of COVID -19, we will use virtual recruiting as much as possible. We will recruit using a 
variety of mechanisms, including emails, flyers, presentations, and social media posts.  
 
We plan to recruit at UCMC and Ingalls Memorial, and at Rush University near west side, South Loop and Oak 
Park locations.  
 
For employee recruitment: We will begin by [CONTACT_297758], which typi[INVESTIGATOR_297728]. While we will recruit in 
diverse settings across both sites, we will prioritize recruitment of health care work ers in outpatient ambulatory 
settings given the higher likelihood of exposure to outpatients and given greater COVID -19 testing of 
inpatients . At both sites we will prioritize front line clinicians, research and other staff (e.g., clinical research 
coordinators, cafeteria and custodial workers) with the greatest likelihood of exposure based on contact [CONTACT_297759]. We expect these criteria to result in a population that significantly over represents 
African American persons, addressing a high- risk population since African Americans and HCWs are at 
increased risk of COVID -19, incr easing our statistical power. Our outreach efforts will also prioritize participants 
who are older, where infection risk and adverse outcomes are more likely.  As vaccines are rolled out to 
healthcare workers, we will also prioritize those less likely to have access to the vaccine right away.   
 For community recruitment:  We will begin by [CONTACT_297760].

 • For individuals newly enrolled in the study, we will send them a welcome email using either “Welcome 
and Share Email” scripts to ask them to share with their networks information about the study just after 
they consent to the study.  
• For individuals  who have been enrolled in the study  for more than one month,  we will reach out them 
individually via email  using the Existing Subject email scripts  to inform them that in light of vaccine 
prioritization to HCWs, we are expanding our recruitment to adults in Chicagoland communities to give 
them access to the possible of benefits of COVID -[ADDRESS_363361] the FAQ sheet to their family members , friends , or others in their network  
who they think may be interested.  
• For groups of HCWs who we have reached already with recruitment materials, we will follow up with 
those groups  using the Community Listserv scripts and inform them that in light of vaccine prioritization 
to HCWs, we are expanding our recruitment to adults in Chicagoland communities to give them access 
to the possible of benefits of COVID -[ADDRESS_363362] it those in their networks who they think might be interested in participating.  
• For HCWs who we have not yet reached out to about participating in the study, we will use the  
Community listserv  script s to both ask them if they are interested and ask if they could share the 
information with those who may be interested in their networks.  
• For individuals who have previously been disqualified at enrollment due to ever having a self -reported 
positive PCR test or a positive baseline antibody test, we will contact  [CONTACT_297761]. We will have these individuals enroll using the same processes for new 
subjects.  
 
For community recruitment other than  HCWs and the social networks of study participants , we will begin by 
[CONTACT_297762] a variety of community 
organizations via phone or email. We will also recruit in Chicagoland neighborhoods, handing out brochures 
and/or flyers to local businesses.  
 
For community recruitment, we use the "Joint Interest Form - RedCap" on iPads or laptops when we are 
recruiting. RCs, RAs and Americorps members, when a potential participant indicates interest in learning more about the study, will enter potential participant information into this form so they can be later followed up with 
by [CONTACT_297763]. This will allow the study team to answer questions and, as applicable, conduct screening, in a 
private setting at a time convenient for the potential participant.  
 
We will ask relevant community organizations’ leaders to disseminate study flyers, FAQ sheets, and listserv 
announcements to their organization and will seek permission to present at meetings. We will allow community 
organization leaders to decide what is the most appropriate mechanism to reach out their group, and we will 
provide them with the relevant recruitment materials accordingly. We will also leverage existing community 
relationships to recruit using social media. These include study staff tweeting recruitment announcements 
about the study  and asking for help in re- tweeting the message, and our group providing social media posts to 
organizations to post themselves via Twitter, Instagram (via InstaStory or on the feed), Snapchat, Facebook (via Story or their wall) , or NextDoor.  
 
We will run also paid advertising campaigns on Facebook and Instagram. The Harris School of Public Policy 
social media team will manage these campaigns, and ads will be posted from the Harris social media accounts. We will target the ads to people over age [ADDRESS_363363] Chicago- related 
interests, such as Chicago Public Schools or the White Sox. This targeting will increase effectiveness and 
efficiency of the ad campaign.   
 
We will also be using a recruitment website, for which we provide the text (see Vitamin D joint study text). This 
website will recruit for both this study and for protocol 20- 0847 (same PI) due to their overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_297729] i nterventions and instruments. If participants are interested in this study

 (study option 2), they will be taken to a RedCap form (see RedCap form  text) where they will provide contact 
[CONTACT_3031].  
 
Below we provide a list of specific community organizations that we plan to reach out to for recruitment. We will update this list with new organizations in an amendment as we identify them.

Interested subjects will be directed to a recruitment line staffed by [CONTACT_297764], if recruited from an in-
person setting, will complete the Joint Study Interest form in RedCap and be contact[CONTACT_297765] a 
later time to review the study and eligibility requirements in a private setting . Once potential subjects are 
Vitamin D Intervention           Version [ADDRESS_363364] extension in Spring 
2022, through March 31, 2023 (see above timelines) . For HCW recruitment, t hough our primary recruitment 
approaches will be virtual, the research team will also hang posters throughout UCM /Ingalls  campus es and 
Rush University , including showing these posters electronically with approval from UCM/Rush marketing teams 
in areas with screens providing employee announcements,  and place flyers in departmental mailboxes. For 
community recruitment, we wil l similarly follow primar ily virtual recruitment approaches and distribute  flyers for 
dissemination at the physical location as appropriate.  
 
To maximize retention rates, our CRCs and study staff will monitor completed drop- in laboratory visits 
according to the [ADDRESS_363365] not completed the survey. 
Laboratory visits will occur for all tests at the same time during study sites’ laboratory hours to minimize inconvenience to subjects.  
 
XVII. Notification of primary physician:  
 
Subjects’ primary care physicians will not be notified of subjects’ involvement in the proposed research. One 
exception to this is if a subject is counseled to seek care from their primary care physician due to an abnormal 
laboratory result or symptom as described above.  
 
XVIII . Anticipated coordination between inter -departmental faculty :  
 
We have created a Clinical Advisory Committee to support our multiple research lines investigating the 
relationship between vitamin D and COVID -19 and plan to regularly coordinate with the faculty on this 
Committee.  
 
Our multidisciplinary clinical advisory committee will provide continued guidance on administration of the study 
protocol and  will support the PI [INVESTIGATOR_297731].  Committee members and expertise include: 
Raphael Lee MD, ScD (surgery, dermatology, basic science), Tamara Vokes MD (endocrinology), Marc 
Bissonnette MD (gastroenterology), Tipu Puri MD, PhD (nephrology), Julian Solway MD (pulmonary, 
translational researc h), Mark Ratain MD (oncology, clinical pharmacology), and Kevin Colgan MA (pharm acy). 
Members of the Committee will meet quarterly with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_297732].  
 
XIX. Pregnancy test  
 Subjects will not be asked to take a pregnancy test before or during the study. We will ask potential subjects 
during recruitment screening to self -report pregnancy. If a potential subject self -reports pregnancy, they will be 
excluded as noted above. Upon enrollment, subjects will be asked to inform the study team if they become pregnant  during the study.

 XX. Rationale for excluding women/minorities and/or children:  
 
We will not recruit those who are considered special populations. We are excluding pregnant and 
breastfeeding women because they have unique guidelines for supplementation and to protect the fetus and infants. We are excluding children, prisoners, and neonates due to the study design and study population.  
  
APPENDIX A: Virtual consent method  
 
1. Once interest has been expressed and the individual has been screened for eligibility  in the RedCap intake 
form, RC/RA will call procced to the eConsent form.  
 
2. RC/RA will ask permission to send the consent form electronically to the potential subject to review the 
components of the study over the phone.   
 3. After a subject has opened the electronic consent form, the RC/RA will verify their identify with their driver’s license, state ID, passport or employee badge, review the consent form with them, answer any questions to 
ensure they understand the study adequately enough to proceed with their participation.  
 
 
3. Subject will sign electronically and the signed consent form will deliver back to the RedCap consent project . 
Subject will have an option to download a .pdf version of the consent form at this time.  
  
4. RC/RA will review to make sure consent form is valid. Then, RC/RA will sign & date the consent form under 
“Person Obtaining Consent”. RC/RA will also obtain the PI [INVESTIGATOR_297733].  RC/RA will keep a copy 
of this consent form in the study files.  
  
 
5. The RC/RA will send the intake survey to the subject for completion.

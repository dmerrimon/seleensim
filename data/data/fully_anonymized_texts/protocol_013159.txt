Research Question and Aims 
 Hypothesis:  
This research addresses the following “big-pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103]” questions: “Is the density notification law recently adopted in AZ 
having the intended impact on patients receiving mammography at a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC)?” and 
“Are there positive or negative unintended consequences to this legislation?” We hypot hesize that sending standard-
language (as determined by [CONTACT_214541]) notification about breast density along with a woman’s mammogram results is a 
sub-optimal method of notification. Furt her, we hypothesize that the goals of ed ucating women about their breast density, 
(including the impact that dense breast tissue can have on mammogram sensitivity and overall risk of breast cancer) and 
encouraging a discussion with their health care provider a bout breast cancer screening options, may not be achieved by 
[CONTACT_214542]. We propose to 
answer these questions by [CONTACT_14664] a 3-arm randomized trial.  All arms will receive the standard density notification 
letter, but [ADDRESS_257797] density. Thus, the 3 study arms are:

 usual care (standard density notification only), enhanced (sta ndard density notification + wr itten educational materials on 
breast density), and interpersonal (standa rd density notification + written educati onal materials on breast density + verbal 
interaction with a promotora /health educator). 
 
The impact of this research can only increase as additiona l states mandate that women attending mammography screening 
(many of whom have never hear d of breast density before) receive written no tification about their breast density and its 
role in breast cancer risk. Particularly in FQHC’s and othe r community settings where breast imaging experts may not be 
on staff and patients may have limited E nglish proficiency, lower health liter acy, and fewer economic resources, it is 
critical that density notification occur in ways that optimi ze receptivity and comprehension, minimize anxiety and worry, 
and enhance self-efficacy and intention to continue screening and pursue supplemental breast screening, if appropriate.  
 
Aims, purpose, or objectives:  
Specific Aim 1: Compare anxiety as well as knowledge gained between  breast density notification approaches (usual 
care, enhanced, interpersonal). We hypothesize that Latinas randomized to the interpersonal group (receiving a density 
notification letter that is accompanied by [CONTACT_214543], plus interaction with a promotora ) will have less 
anxiety and more knowledge gained relative to e ither the usual care or enhanced study groups.  
Specific Aim 2: Compare adherence to next routine screening mammogram between breast density notification 
approaches (usual care, enhanced, interpersonal).  We hyp othesize that Latinas randomized to the interpersonal group 
(receiving a density notification letter that is accompanied by [CONTACT_214543], plus interaction with a 
promotora ) will be more likely to adhere to next screening mamm ogram relative to either the usual care or enhanced 
study groups. 
Specific Aim 3: Whether or not the interpersonal group is found to have more favorable outcomes, we will examine the 
experience of the promotora  in order to understand their conversations with  patients, identify patients’ concerns about 
their notification, and understand contextual factors related to implementation of the intervention. If the interpersonal 
approach is found to be successful, this  aim will inform refinement of the edu cational intervention for dissemination; if 
the interpersonal approach is not found to be successful, this aim will provide insight about potential shortcomings. This 
aim will involve qualitative inquiry.  Exploratory Aim 1:  Estimate the financial impact of the promotora  intervention by [CONTACT_746] a cost analysis 
Exploratory Aim 2: Examine the association between perceived BC risk and preferences for informed decision making. 
We hypothesize that Latina women with a higher perceived ri sk will report a greater desire for involvement in the 
decision to get a mammogram and more likely to report that they made the final decision to get mammography.  
Exploratory Aim 3. Examine the association between risk communication and preferences for informed decision making. 
We hypothesize that Latina women interested in knowing their risk will report a greater desi re for involvement in the 
decision to get a mammogram and more likely to report that they made the final decision.  
 
Background ( Include relevant experience, gaps in cu rrent knowledge, preliminary data, etc .):  
 
Drs. Radecki Breitkopf (PI) and Vachon (PI) have been conducting research at Mountain Park Health Center (MPHC) 
since January 2012. The Mountain Park  Mammography Screening Study (MPMSS) has demonstrated the feasibility of 
conducting research in the MPHC mammography suite and estab lished a cohort of over 2,100 women, of whom 85% are 
Hispanic/Latina. The cohort was built over a 30 month peri od with one part-time CRC; the proposed study would support 
full-time recruitment efforts at MPHC, thus, recruitment of 2,[ADDRESS_257798] (EMR) and collect data via an interviewer-facilitated questionnaire to exam ine risk profiles in this population.

Our experience has provided valuable data for planning the proposed study. For instance, MPHC patients are receptive to 
research participation; over 95% of wo men approached for the cohort study provi ded informed consent. While the time 
burden for the proposed study will be greater than for the cohor t study, common features suggest patients will be similarly 
receptive; being minimal risk, related to breast cancer preven tion, involving questionnaires, and requiring permission to 
share health information with Mayo Clinic researchers.  
Ongoing analysis of our cohort data provides evidence that the proposed study is highly relevant to the MPHC patient 
population, as age- and BMI-adjusted percent density of th e breast tissue was found to be similar between Latinas at 
MPHC and non-Hispanic whites in a long-standing Mayo Clin ic patient cohort, thus Latinas and non-Hispanic whites 
appear to share a major independent risk factor for breast cancer. Furthermore, we conducte d brief assessments of English 
language proficiency, health lite racy, and awareness of breast density for some  of the MPMSS participants and our data 
show that the MPHC screening mammography population reflects an important target group for educational interventions 
in the context of new density legislation. Specifically, our data reveal limited English prof iciency: the percentage of 
women indicating “not too well” or “not at all” for unde rstanding spoken English was 75%, for speaking English, 77%, 
and for reading English, was 72%. With regard to health lite racy, 47% of women were “somewhat confident” or less that 
they could fill out medical forms by [CONTACT_1029]. Importantly, on ly 8% of women indicated that they had heard of the term 
‘breast density.’ Eighty-seven percent of women who enrolle d in the cohort during the first [ADDRESS_257799] density and provides evidence that 
the MPHC mammography screening population is a relatively stable one, and that longitudinal research is feasible. 
 Drs. Radecki Breitkopf (PI), Rhodes (Co-I), and Vachon (PI) led a national cross-sectional survey (in English and 
Spanish) of awareness and knowledge regarding breast dens ity using a probability-based sample of U.S. women of 
mammography screening age (40-74 years). Overall, 58% of wo men had heard (were aware) of breast density; awareness 
was associated with age > 50 years; white , non-Hispanic race/ethnicity; and higher income and educational attainment (all 
P<0.001). We included two knowledge items in the survey. The first item tested understanding of the masking effect of 
density: “ If a woman has dense breasts, what impact does this have on the ability of a mammogram to correctly detect 
cancer?” with four response options: Dense breasts make it ea sier to see cancer on a mammogram; Dense breasts do not 
impact the ability to see cancer on a mammogram; Dense br easts make it more difficult to see cancer on a mammogram; 
and I don’t know. A total of 49% of res pondents correctly indicated that dense br easts make it more difficult to see cancer 
on a mammogram. After adjusting for awareness of breast de nsity (Hispanic women had lower awareness), knowledge of 
the masking effect did not differ by [CONTACT_545]/ethnicity ( P=0.21). The second item tested knowledge that density is an 
independent risk factor for breast cancer. Fifty-three percen t of women correctly indicated that having dense breasts puts 
you at increased risk of breast cancer, with no differences by r ace/ethnicity after adjusting for awareness (P=0.61). In sum, 
this study identified disparities in breast density awareness by r ace/ethnicity, age, education, income and insurance status.  
 
Analyses of the national data restricted to Hispanic women ( n=143) demonstrated poor unde rstanding of key risk factors 
for breast cancer, low awareness of breast density (24%), f eeling anxiety about learning their own breast density (59% 
agree or strongly agree), and willingness to seek additional scr eening if the ability of their mammogram to detect cancer 
was compromised by [CONTACT_214544] (20-39%, depending on cost). When asked “What impact does breast density have on a 
mammogram?” 68% of Hispanic women sel ected the response “I don’t know.”  
 
This study will utilize our prior research experience at MPHC  and apply the knowledge that we learned conducting the 
national survey study. In short, we are well-prepared to conduct the proposed study. Mandatory notification imposed by 
[CONTACT_214545][INVESTIGATOR_214537], which are 
assumed to be positive. Moreover, notif ication is gaining momentum in the absence of clear guidelines regarding 
appropriate supplemental screening for women with dense breast  tissue and counseling regarding breast cancer risk. We

C:\Users\slj19\Downloads\LLEAD _protocol_v7.doc Page [ADDRESS_257800] a randomized trial to compare behavi oral and psychological outcomes among Latinas who receive 
notification per the mandate (usual care) relative to two enhanced approaches that are theory informed, culturally 
consistent, and novel in this context. Our findings will fill critical gaps in  our knowledge and understanding of how this 
policy affects women who are already vulnerable to disparities. It will provide evidence on the feasibility and efficacy of a 
portable intervention to increase knowledge of breast density, and be able to determine approximate costs of intervention 
delivery in a FQHC setting. 
Study Design and Methods 
 
Methods:  Describe, in detail, the research activities  that will be conducted under this protocol :   
 
The study will be conducted at MPHC in the mammography suite. The mammography suite is equipped to screen one 
patient at a time; there is ample space in the unit for research activities to ta ke place. We will attempt to make pre-
recruitment phone calls to women on the screening mammogr aphy patient logs, alerting them to a possible study 
opportunity on the day of their appointment, and to enable them to plan for a little extra time at the clinic if they think the y 
may be interested in participating [Attachment 1]. Women entering the mammography suite will be given a study 
brochure [Attachment 2a] and if receptive, complete a brief screener to determine study eligibility [Attachment 2b]. The 
study will be introduced to the patient prior to undergoing ma mmography by a trained Spanish/English bilingual clinical 
research coordinator (CRC). If the patient is willing to participate, she will be asked to provide written informed consent 
[Attachment 3] and authorization to release medical records [Attachment 4] for this research study. She will then be 
randomized to one of the three notification approaches (study groups) – usual care, enhanced/written education 
[Attachment 5], interpersonal.  
 All consented patients will be asked to complete a baseline (T1) survey [Attachment 6] that includes:  demographic 
characteristics; breast density risk f actors (parity, age at menarche, menopau sal status, hormonal contraceptive use, 
breastfeeding, and age at first birth); Family history of breast cancer; and mammography screening history (approximate 
lifetime number of mammograms, number of times recalled, number of breast bi opsies). The primary outcome measure 
for Aim [ADDRESS_257801] ate anxiety subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory 
(STAI). This measure was select ed because of its known psychometric properties, its use in the mammography literature, 
and our own experience with its use in an interventi on study involving Latinas attending cancer screening. Additional 
psychosocial measures will include health  literacy, cancer fatalism, self-efficacy to return for mammography at the next 
screening interval, breast cancer worry, perceived risk of br east cancer using numerical, verbal and comparative estimates, 
and the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Informa tion System (PROMIS) measure (short form) addressing 
depressive symptoms. Knowledge will be assessed using tw o previously developed items for the national survey 
regarding density as an independent risk factor and as havi ng a masking effect as well as additional items derived from the 
written education materials. Our selection of short form assessments where available carefully balances capturing a 
comprehensive set of important psycho social measures while reducing respondent  burden. We have chosen published 
measures with favorable psychometric properties and use existing measures where available. Administering the 
depression measure from the PROMIS Initiative ( www.nihpromis.org ) will utilize an important resource for validated 
patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and position our study results within a larger, cross-institute NIH initiative. Based on 
our experience at MPHC, an intervie wer-facilitated mode of survey comple tion is preferred by [CONTACT_214546]-
administered surveys and results in higher quality data. We will provide paper survey s in English and Spanish; 
participants can mark their own answers or follow along a nd mark their answers as questions are read to them by [CONTACT_214547]. We anticipate the study assessments will take approxima tely 30 minutes to complete. The study coordinator will 
review the responses to the PROMIS items related to de pression following completion of the T1 survey. Based on the 
responses, the study coordinator will follow the steps in th e Plan for Depression Questions [Attachment 18]. If the plan

Questions and using the Script for Depr ession Questions Follow-up [Attachment 19]. 
 
Additional data will be abstracted from the MPHC EMR [A ttachment 7] including: body mass index, breast density 
category, screening mammogram results (normal or abnormal), and attendance and outcome of any additional/supplemental breast screening (breast ultrasound, MRI, etc.), or breast procedures (breast biopsy). These 
additional data will position our study to  contribute to understanding risk prof iles for breast cancer among Latinas and 
inform risk-based screening. 
 
Follow-up (T2) Assessment. Participants will be contact[CONTACT_66696] u
sing Mayo Clinic or Mountain Park 
telephone that will display the Mountain Park phone number. [Attachment 8] approximately [ADDRESS_257803] their mammogram to complete a follow-up survey [Attachment 9]. If the study staff is unsuccessful in reaching the 
participant by [CONTACT_756], the T2 survey w ill be mailed to the participant with a cover letter [Attachment 10] and return 
postage-paid envelope. If the patient has not actively refused or withdrawn, or completed the T2 assessment, study staff will attempt to follow-up by [CONTACT_756]. Study staff may also se nd a certified letter asking the participant to call them and 
schedule a time to complete the survey (see Attached reminder letter). If telephone and mail contacts are not successful, 
participants will be coded in RAVE as a non-responder at T2. The CRC will collect  the data over the telephone and mark 
the answers on a paper survey for double data entry by [CONTACT_214548] (SRC). The CRC will ask questions 
designed to measure acceptability of the method by [CONTACT_214549]. Knowledg e will be re-assessed using the same items  described in the baseline assessment. 
Women will be queried about their own breast density as a check that the mailed notification was read and processed. 
Anxiety, depressive symptoms, perceived risk of brea st cancer, self-efficacy, and breast cancer worry measures 
administered at baseline will be repeated. Behavioral inten tion to return for a screening mammogram at the recommended 
interval will also be assessed. All wome n will be asked if they discussed thei r breast density with their health care 
provider. Women with dense breasts will be asked if they discussed supplemental screening options with their health care 
provider (e.g., breast ultrasound, MRI). Questions will a ddress whether each of these activities occurred, and if not, 
whether they are pending (requested by [CONTACT_102]). If not  requested, intentions rega rding these behaviors will be 
measured. The study coordinator will review the responses to the PROMIS items related to depression following completion of the T2 survey. Based on the responses, the study coordinator will follow the steps in the Plan for 
Depression Questions [Attachment 18]. If the plan calls fo r study personnel to contact [CONTACT_102], she will do so in 
accordance with the Plan for Depression Questions and using the Script for Depression Questions Follow-up [Attachment 
19].
 
 
Follow-up (T3) Assessment. Participants will be contact[CONTACT_214550]. [Attachment 11] approximately [ADDRESS_257804] survey [Attachment 12]. Reminder calls and a T3 survey 
mailing with cover letter [Attachment 13] will follow the pro cedures outlined for the T2 assessment. Study staff may also 
send a certified letter asking the participant to call them and schedule a time to complete the survey (see Attached 
reminder letter). Study staff may also approach patients in clinic if they present to the mammography unit for screening.. If telephone, in-person and mail contacts are not successful, participants will be coded in RAVE as a non-responder at T3. The T3 assessment will include repeated measurement of anxiety, depressive sy mptoms, breast cancer worry, perceived 
risk, and discussion of their breast density with their health care provider. It will include questions regarding information 
seeking about the topic of breast density and re-assess breast de nsity knowledge. Intentions rega rding future utilization of 
mammography and supplemental breast screening will be m easured. Attendance at mammography will be queried to 
capture self-reported screening behavior that may have occu rred elsewhere and would not be documented in the MPHC 
EMR; however this is unlikely because many patients receive low-cost mammography through special programs at MPHC. All women will be queried at the T3 assessment a bout their attendance at mamm ography; these self-report data 
Minimal Risk Protocol Template [IRB [ZIP_CODE].007]  Effective: March 8, 2016 
 
C:\Users\slj19\Downloads\LLEAD _protocol_v7.doc Page 6 of 14  
 will be corroborated with EMR data. Women who indicate th ey received a mammogram else where will be asked where 
and when this occurred. The study coordinator will review  the responses to the PROMIS items related to depression 
following completion of the T3 survey. B ased on the responses, the study coordinator will follow the steps in the Plan for 
Depression Questions [Attachment 18]. If the plan calls fo r study personnel to contact [CONTACT_102], she will do so in 
accordance with the Plan for Depression Questions and using the Script for Depression Questions Follow-up [Attachment 
19]. 
 
Follow-up (T4) Assessment. We will identify women enrolled in LLEAD who have completed a mammography since 
January 1, [ADDRESS_257805] cancer risk factors (i.e., family history, prior biopsy),  
and new items measuring risk communication, medical mistrust, provider trust, preferences for informed decision making, 
and social determinants of health (i.e ., housing and food insecurity, transportation). Participants  will have the option to 
complete the survey by [CONTACT_648], mail, email, or web-based platfo rm (Zoom). All participants will receive an emailed and/or 
mailed letter notifying them about changes to the protocol, th e purpose of the follow up survey with oral consent, and 
contact [CONTACT_19297] a bilingual research coordinator to complete the survey using a nother modality. The mailed letter 
will include a paper copy of the survey in English and Spanish with a pre-stamped enve lope, and a QR code that 
participants can scan to complete the follow-up survey on their phone in Englis h or Spanish. Approximately two weeks 
after the initial mailing/email, eligible participants will receive a reminder letter and email to complete the survey. Participants not responding to the em ail or mailed letters will receive a fo llow-up call from a bilingual research 
coordinator to elicit if the participant received the materials, if they would be interest ed in completing the survey, 
preferred mode of completion, and to obtain oral consent. Participants will be contact[CONTACT_1006] 4 times (2X by [CONTACT_2319]/email, 
2X by [CONTACT_648]) before they will be considered non-responders.  
 Adherence to subsequent mammography screening or follo w-up testing (diagnostic mammography, breast ultrasound), 
and delay in attending follow-up care will be ascertained fro m the EMR. We will record attendance (yes or no) at 
screening mammography [ADDRESS_257806] the number of weeks of delay in attending a follow-up appointment as a “ time to adherence” variable; women who are adherent will be 
assigned a delay score of “0.” It has been shown that dela ys in diagnosis of breast cancer as short as 3 months are 
associated with decreased surviv al, therefore we will also consider delay as a dichotomous variable: follow-up of an 
abnormal screening mammogram was received within 3 months of  the scheduled appointment (not delayed) or sometime 
thereafter (delayed). Any uptake in supplemental breast screening among women with dense breasts will be captured in the EMR review.  
Women
 will be compensated a maximum of $100 upon co mpleting this study. They will be given $25 upon 
completion of the T1 (baseline) assessment, $25 upon completion of the T2 assessment, $25 upon completion of 
the T3 assessment, and $25 upon comp letion of the T4 assessment.  
 
Aim 3 Data Collection.  Subsequent to completing the delivery of th e interpersonal intervention with a patient 
[Attachment 14], the promotora  will complete a form with open- and cl ose-ended questions about the encounter 
[Attachment 15]. It will document standard  information related to the conversation, such as what questions the patient 
asked and whether there were issues the promotora  was unable to address, as well as serve as self-reported information on 
intervention delivery adherence. Once every 1-2 weeks, the promotora  will respond to a set of longer, reflective questions 
Minimal Risk Protocol Template [IRB [ZIP_CODE].007]  Effective: March 8, 2016 
 
C:\Users\slj19\Downloads\LLEAD _protocol_v7.doc Page 7 of 14  
 related to patient encounters, the intervention context, and othe r factors relevant to her role and the implementation of the 
intervention [Attachment 16]. A member of the research team will regularly review entries and provide feedback or ask 
for clarification from the promotora  as needed. This iterative approach to concurrent data collection and initial data 
analysis will ensure the data collection is robust and can ad apt and include new questions or issues as they emerge. This 
process will also act as a log for capturing any adaptations or va riations to the intervention over time. Finally, calls audio-
recorded for fidelity monitoring may also serve as qualitative data that capture information on patient perspectives. 
 
If at any point a woman withdraws from the study, she will not receive future contacts and the study team will not collect 
additional data. Upon withdrawal, study st aff will provide written confirmation that  the participant has withdrawn from 
the study [Attachment 20]. 
 
Resources:  Describe the available resources to conduct the research (personnel, time, facilities, mentor 
commitment, etc.) :  
 
Financial resources for this study include a 5-year NIH/NIMHD grant, the PI’s base budget funds, and supplemental funds 
from the Mayo Clinic Cancer Population Sciences program. The grant budget includes funding for study personnel 
time/effort, travel for training and site visits, building secure databases in RAVE, and data entry and analysis. MPHC has 
approved the use of their facility (mammography suite space) for the conduct of this research. 
 The study will employ a promotora  who is also staff at MPHC and who is familiar with the patient population, clinic 
setting, language, and culture of the st udy population. She will undergo careful training in the delivery and documentation 
of each interaction in which breast density results are discu ssed with study patients. Training by [CONTACT_15957]-I [CONTACT_214558] will ensure 
that the promotora  is knowledgeable about MBD, can respond factually to patient questions, and defer questions 
appropriately to the patient’s health care provider. Tr aining by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Vachon and [CONTACT_214559] will ensure that the 
promotora  fully appreciates the need for consistent delivery of the information as part of a research protocol, including 
documenting departures from protocol. When the promotora  calls each patient, the following material will be available: 
the mammogram report, the density notification letter, and a written “interac tion guide” that is based on factual 
information about MBD and tailored to th e language and literacy appropriate for th is setting. With patient permission, 
calls may be audio-recorded for monitoring by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_214538]. 
 We will record at least 50% of the encounters during the first month of promotora 
intervention delivery or until [ADDRESS_257807] with adherence items  (presence or absence of intervention components outlined in the interaction 
guide) as well as ratings of intervention delivery competence based on program theory [Attachment 17]. The expected 
performance level will be at least 95% on the adherence items. Retraining will ta ke place if lower performance is found. 
The fidelity checklist will also be reviewed at the end of this case review and any necessary changes will be made before 
instituting long-term fidelity monitoring.   
Long-term monitoring will begin when the 95% performan ce measure is met. From that point on we will randomly 
sample 20% of promotora interactions over the course of the st udy and the two observers will compare results monthly. If 
performance falls below 95%, we will address reasons and sample at 50% again until performance improves. 
 
We will manage the study data using RAVE and REDCap da tabases designed specifically for the study. These systems 
are located behind the Mayo Clinic firewall. Users must ha ve a Mayo Clinic provided ID/password to connect to the 
databases and their ID must be specifically authorized in order to access study data. Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_214539]. The tools are HIPAA-compliant, can be set up to use branching logic and field validation to help improve 
the accuracy of data entry, and the data can be easily e xported for statistical analysis. Administration of survey 
assessments (T1, T2, and T3) will occur by [CONTACT_214551]-facilitated by [CONTACT_214552]. Surveys will be

 With patient permission, calls will be audi o-recorded for monitoring by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_214540]. Audio recordings will be obtained on a portable audio-recording 
device and uploaded at the end of each day. The device will kept  in a locked cabinet at all times when not in use. Audio 
files will be labeled only by [CONTACT_214556] a secure study server which is located behind the 
Mayo Clinic firewall with limited access by [CONTACT_214557].  After a 24-hour period (enough time 
for the server to be backed up to guard against data loss), the audio files will be permanently deleted from the portable 
device. Transcription of files will be performed internally at Mayo Clinic, utilizing secure file transfer processes and 
Spanish language translators (as needed). 
 
HIPAA Identifiers and Protected  Health Information (PHI) 
 
Protected health information is medical  data that can be linked to the subject directly or through a combination 
of indirect identifiers.   Maintaining identifiers (including a code) during the conduct of the study a llows you to return to the medical 
record or data source to delete duplic ate subjects, check a missing or quest ionable entry, add new data points, 
etc. De-identified data is me dical information that has been stripped of all HIPAA identifiers so  that it cannot be 
linked back to the subject. De-identified data is rarely  used in the conduct of a research study involving a chart 
review.    Review the list of subject identifi ers below and, if applicable, check th e box next to each HIPAA identifier 
being recorded at the time of data co llection or abstraction.  Id entifiers apply to any subj ect enrolled in the study 
including Mayo Clinic staff,  patients and their relatives  and household members.  
 Internal  refers to the subject’s identifi er that will be maintained at  Mayo Clinic by [CONTACT_5984].

  Power Statement : 
   
A total of 2,[ADDRESS_257810] density 
notification: usual care, enhanced, or interpersonal a pproaches (approximately 667 women per group) (see Figure 1). 
Applying a 10% attrition rate between enrollment and the firs t follow-up time point and an additional 20% after one year, 
we have planned for a sample size of 1,800 (2,000*0.90, 600 per group) for T2 measures and a sample size of 1,400 (2,000*0.70, 466 per group) for T3 measures.  
 
Aim 1  will compare the percent change in anxiety (STAI) from baseline between the three study groups at one month 
(T1) and 1 year (T3) following notification. Assuming the pe rcent change may likely range from -100% to +100% (range 
of 200 percentage points), we conservati vely assume a standard deviation of 50 pe rcentage points (range/4) in the percent 
change measure. We will have 80% power (along with 1.7% ty pe-I error rate) to detect a difference of 9.[ADDRESS_257811] 
80% power to detect a difference of 10.6 (466 per group).   
 The second outcome will be knowledge regard ing breast density, measured ordinally as the number correct of 3 key items 
(range 0-[ADDRESS_257812]). This will be tested with pairwise Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, for which the null hypothesis is that the 
probability of someone answering more items correctly in one gr oup versus another is 0.5 (i.e . equal chance). At T2, with

Aim 2  will compare adherence to next routine screening ma mmogram between the three notification groups. This 
outcome “adherence to next annual screening” is pertinent to all 2,000 women and will be obtained via EMR. A sample 
size of 666 in each group will yield 80% power to detect a diffe rence of 9 percentage points between the any two of the 
groups (type-I error rate 1.7%) based on a chi-square test.

Data Analysis Plan:   
Analytic Approach for Specific Aim [ADDRESS_257816] density notification approaches (usual care, 
enhanced, interpersonal).  Anxiety will be  measured using the state anxiety scale w ithin the State Trait Anxiety Inventory 
(STAI). Items within this scale are rated on a [ADDRESS_257817] for baseline anxiety 
levels, we will calculate the percent change in anxiety from baseline at each follow-up: 100*(follow-up anxiety – baseline 
anxiety) / baseline anxiety. We hypothesize that there will be less increase in anxiety for the interpersonal group as 
compared to the enhanced or usual care groups.  The percent change will be compared between the three notification 
study groups with pairwise t-tests at one month as well as at one year following notification. To account for three pairwise comparisons within each time point, P-values less than 0.[ADDRESS_257818] density will be measured as the number of statements  answered correctly as previously 
described. The number of items answered correctly (range of 0- 3) will be compared between the three notification groups 
with pairwise Wilcoxon-rank-sum tests at one month as well as at [ADDRESS_257819] density notification approaches 
(usual care, enhanced, interpersonal). This information w ill be obtained from the EMR. The percentage of women who 
adhere to their next routine screening mammogram will be compared between the three notification groups with pairwise chi-square tests. We hypothesize that women randomized to the interpersonal group will be more  likely to adhere to next 
screening mammogram relative to either the usual care or enhanced study groups. To account for three pairwise 
comparisons P-values less than 0.[ADDRESS_257820]

Protocol  and Sta �s�cal Analysis Plan  
Summary  
Obesity is a major public health problem that disproportionately affects rural men 1and 
promotes the development of  chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular 
disease,  arthritis, and cancer 2. This study proposes to evaluate a 6- month mobile self -
monitoring application (app) with Wi -Fi scale and text messaging intervention (MT+: 
mobile technology  plus) for achi eving weight loss in overweight and obese rural men. 
Weight loss interventions  for rural men constitute a gap both in the literature and current 
NIH-NINR research  portfolios. Using a pragmatic randomized controlled trial and 
community engaged research (CEn R) approaches, this study aims to: 1) determine the 
feasibility and acceptability of a  smart phone self -monitoring app ( Lose -It Premium) plus 
SMS text -based and daily weighing  via Wi -Fi scale intervention (MT+) for achieving 
weight loss, 2) determine preli minary  efficacy of MT+ to a comparison group receiving 
only a self - monitoring app ( Lose -It Basic ) (MT) in achieving the outcomes of weight 
loss (kg and % body weight -primary) and  improved dietary and physical activity (PA) 
behaviors (secondary) at 3 and 6 months postbaseline,  and 3) determine quantitative 
and qualitative indicators of community capacity to support a contextually relevant 
weight loss intervention. Eighty men (ages 40- 69) with BMI  of 28 kg/m 2 or higher will be 
randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to intervention group (MT+) or  comparison group (MT). 
Men will complete baseline assessments (weight (kg), % body fat,  BMI, height, blood 
pressure (BP), health history, dietary intake, PA intensity) and receive orientation to the 
mobile technologies ( Lose -It app features, SMS, Wi -Fi scale). Men will track their 
dietary intake, PA, and weight on the Lose- It app for [ADDRESS_407772] -measure assessments (weight -kg, % body fat, BMI, dietary intake, PA  
frequency/intensity, and technol ogy usability surveys) will be collected at [ADDRESS_407773] -baseline, two groups (n=8 each) of MT+ 
completers will be  purposively selected to share their perceptions of the intervention 
efficacy in evaluative  focus groups. A community advisory board (CAB) comprising local 
leaders within the men's  social network, together with investigators and UNMC student 
nurses will gui de community  outreach efforts for study recruitment, implementation, and 
evaluation. Study findings will be evaluated with the CAB to inform local dissemination, 
future intervention revision, and determination of community capacity for support of a 
larger clinical trial.  
 
Purpose  
 
The specific aims of this study are:  
 
Aim #1: Determine the feasibility and acceptability of a MT+ intervention for achieving  
weight loss in rural overweight and obese men. The aim will specifically address groups by 1) participation rates including number of men recruited and randomized over a 6 
month period; 2) retention rates; 3) feasibility, usability, satisfaction ratings; 4) 
adherence record of  logging by [CONTACT_330050]; and 5) evaluative focus 
group feedback.  
 
Aim #2: Dete rmine preliminary efficacy of a MT+ intervention to a comparison group  
receiving only a basic self -monitoring app (MT) in achieving 1) weight loss (primary), 
and 2)  improved dietary and PA behaviors (secondary) at [ADDRESS_407774] -baseline in rural men.  
 
Aim #3: Determine quantitative and qualitative indicators of community capacity (resource  mobilization, learning opportunities -skills development, partnership linkages, 
participatory  decision -making, and leadership) to su pport a relevant weight loss 
intervention for rural  men.  
 Feasibility Substudy Aim: To determine the feasibility of men currently enrolled in our  
clinical trial to wear an activity sensor (Actigraph GT9X) for seven continuous days to  
objectively measure thei r continuous physical activity among the total volume of activity  
bouts across three gait dimensions: intensity, symmetry, and variability.  
 Background and Rationale  
 
Obesity is disproportionately prevalent among rural men.  Overweight/obesity rates  
among midlife and older men in Nebr aska have tripled in the past 20 years, with 30% of  
men obese (n=133,470) 3, 4. Associated with overweight and obesity, rural midlife men 
are at  higher risk for metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease (CVD) 5. Our 
preliminary  study findings showed a hi gh number of (CVD) risk factors (hypertension, 
etc.) among rural  men 6. The implication of high prevalence of overweight and obesity in 
rural men is a reduced life expectancy compared to rural women 7, and overall poorer 
health than urban men, 1 which contributes to increased economic and psychological 
burden to rural women  and families. 8,9 Historically, rural men were less likely to be 
overweight and obese due to the high levels of physical activity invo lved in agriculture 
(Ag)- based occupations. Recently, the mechanization of Ag- service industries has 
shifted men's work roles to more sedentary,  technology -driven lifestyles, increasing the 
likelihood of developi[INVESTIGATOR_330031]/obesity.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_330032], no self -
monitoring mobile technology interventions for weight  loss in rural, U.S. males were 
found. Men, compared to women, are less likely to use weight  control practices, 10 
attempt weight loss, or participate in weight loss programs. 11-13 Access to weight loss 
resources is one reason. 14 Rural men tend to exhibit dominant masculine  
norms, 15 which view help -seeking behaviors and health promotion strategies as 
feminine and weak. 6, 15 Health promotion activities oriented to rural men's work roles are 
preferred. [ADDRESS_407775], or similar situations address locally relevant  
issues.
17 National Institutes of Health (NIH) 18 advocates for community engagement in  
clinical trials to improve recruitment/retention, research quality, relevance, and enhanced research impact in addressing health disparities.
19 Community -engaged 
research (CEnR)  with underserved, rural A g populations has demonstrated positive 
outcomes for 1)  improving service access, 20, 21; 2) establishing service learning 
opportunities for college students 22; 3) healthcare training models, and 4) garnering 
local health priorities for  action. [ADDRESS_407776] to provide 
information about the feasibility of  engaging rural men into clinical research with mobile 
technologies using community leaders  from the men's social networks. CEnR strategies 
applied in our study supported 100%  recruit ment and retention of our sample. [ADDRESS_407777] (CAB). 
Community outreach via nurses has  demonstrated improved study engagement and 
completion rates in previous pragmatic  RCTs in rural Ag settings. [ADDRESS_407778] that funds this proposal requi res the involvement of 
undergraduate students in the research plan. Undergraduate student nurses  
are a community outreach and engagement resource for rural communities because of 
their previous experience as a student nurse on the rural, UNMC Northern Divi sion 
campus in Norfolk, NE. Not only does the student's formal training in community 
outreach / community  engagement as a component of their NRSG 413-  Population-
Centered Care course provide them with the skills to conduct community outreach and 
engagement planning, but they are more likely to plan meaningful and locally effective 
outreach strategies that can enhance partnership building for CAB and subject 
recruitment.  
 Self-monitoring eating and activity with smartphone- based applications helps  
overcome disparities related to access to weight loss resources in rural men.  Self-
monitoring (SM) of eating, activity, and weight is one of the most effective behavior -
change techniques for weight loss.
33-[ADDRESS_407779] 
acceptable when it was easy to use,  conveniently accessible, and feasible to wear 
across their varied work settings and roles. 6 
 
New smartphone- based apps, such as the Lose -It app, permit real -time engagement 
with users for tracking of eating and activity and don't require the wearing/managing of 
additional  devices or paper -pencil self -monitoring, which may enhance adherence with 
dietary logging,  satisfaction, and usability among adults. [ADDRESS_407780] recorded greater weight loss 
outcomes associated with the  increased frequency of SM of eating and activity. 43Lose -
It's incorporation of evidence- based behavioral strategies for weight loss and persuas ive 
technology lends to its superiority  among other mobile weight loss apps, 44-45 including its 
access on a variety of platforms  including android, iPhone, web, and tablet. 46 We 
propose to compare 1) a publicly available free version of a smart phone app ( Lose- It 
basic) (MT) that permits a convenient, ready to use application that could potentially be 
recommended by [CONTACT_330051] 2) a more comprehensive self -
monitoring smart phone- base app ( Lose- It Premiumwhich  includes a social compar ison 
group), combined with behavior change SMS  messaging and daily self -weighing with a 
Wi-Fi scale (MT+). Our goal is to assess efficacy  in overcoming disparities related to 
weight loss resources for rural men. The intent is to compare the Lose- It Basic a pp (free 
version) (MT) for tracking of daily weight, dietary intake,  and physical activity with its 
companion, Lose- It Premium (paid version), that tracks a wider  range of SM metrics for 
up-loading of weight with a Wi -Fi scale, physical activity, dietary,  goal setting, and a 
private social comparison group, which enhances the value in the realtime tracking of 
these measures with comparison of past performance to one's goals,  previous 
accomplishments, and the performance norms of similar groups. 47-50Both the  premium 
version of Lose- It app and the Nokia Body+ Smart Scale are publicly available for  
purchase.The premium version of the app costs 40.00 per year and offers enhanced 
goal setting functions and personalized weekly report for tracking progress. The Noki a 
Body+  Smart Scale costs 100.00 to purchase and syncs with the Lose- It app (either 
version) to provide real -time progress towards tracking weight loss goals.  
 
Text messaging is an effective channel for promoting SM behaviors to achieve weight  
loss among rural men.  Text messaging provides motivation, knowledge, and social  
support for behavior change. 40, 51- 54 When supported by [CONTACT_330052], text  
messaging has been effective for improving SM behaviors (reducing weight, improving  
eatin g, increasing physical activity), 52, 55- 57 resulting in greater than 5% baseline body 
weight  loss after 3 months. 51 Behavior change augmented by [CONTACT_330053], yet allowing access to the message at the 
convenience of the  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. Daily receipt of text messages at 8:00am, with content 
presented in a novel and non-repetitive fashion, has been documented as the preferred 
frequency and time for  men, [ADDRESS_407781] the specific 
motivations for  and barriers to physical  activity 61and healthy eating identified by [CONTACT_10664], 
39can encourage behavioral support outreach  to family and friends, and should use 
concise language 40and humor. 6 An example of a text  message targeting interpersonal 
support for beh avior change: Today, tell one friend or  family member what your favorite 
healthy snacks are. When targeting weight loss, men's  preference for the content of text 
messaging has ranged from behaviors to be enacted and avoided, strategies for 
overcoming chall enges and creating healthy food environments, and  healthy living 
challenges. 56, 62- 63 This study seeks to build on the available evidence from our  
preliminary study and other available evidence that text messaging may enhance 
selfmonitoring  and behavior change for weight loss.  
 Social Ecological Perspective (SEP) frames multiple influences on rural men's health behaviors. Rural men are less likely to implement their own physical activity and weight  
loss interventions due to access constraints and environment al influences.
6, 64 Thus,  
combining individual health behavior change approaches with environmental -based 
support  is necessary. 65SEP asserts that the degree of fit between a persons biological, 
behavioral,  and sociocultural needs and the environmental resources available to them 
serves as a key determinant of health. 66 This MT+ intervention applies SEP to impact 
multiple, nested layers of active and passive influence on men's health behaviors for 
weight loss. 66 Use of the Lose- It app and Wi -Fi scale enable intrapersonal behavior 
change through the daily SM behavior of log ging eating,  activity, and weight. Real - time 
feedback via the app promotes individual evaluation of  eating and activity behaviors. 
The real -time social comparison and group support provided via the Lose- It app and 
text messaging promote interpersonal support to influence behavioral change. The use 
of CEnR strategies, through the CAB involvement and student  nurse outreach, permit 
social networking and improved community -level support for rural  men's weight loss. 
Social networking will garner resources to inform locally relevant social  marketing 
strategies and enhance study recruitment. The CAB will provide input across all  
stages of the study, supporting the relevance of the intervention and optimizing the  
engagement of local resources. (See Figure 1). Serrano and colleagues 43report of a 
largescale weight loss study using the Lose- It app (n=12,427,196) found that 15% of app 
users  lost 5% of more of their baseline body weight. Subsample analyses from this 
study indicated that higher intensity app use (SM frequ ency) and the use of custom app 
features  characterized higher levels of weight loss success (73% achieved clinically 
significant  weight loss) - suggesting that customizing SM information via Lose- It app to 
particular  subgroups could enhance weight loss succ ess. Key behavioral factors found 
to be related to varying proportions of weight loss success can be enhanced by [CONTACT_330054] -monitoring,  real-time feedback from self -monitoring which permits self -
evaluation, and the receipt of prompts supporting e ating and activity behavior change. 
These behavioral  elements are associated with improved weight loss and decreased 
occurrence of weight  regain. 34 Social support and customizable goal setting are 
additional evidence- based behavioral strategies associated with optimum weight loss. 34 
Therefore, we plan to compare the efficacy outcomes between the widely available 
Lose- It Basic app (free) with a custom  version of the Lose- It app ( Lose -It Premium-  paid 
$40) supplemented with intrapersonal,  interpersonal, and c ommunity -level supports to 
maximize self -monitoring behaviors for  weight loss success.  
 In summary, this study addresses a significant health disparity among overweight and  
obese rural men: access to and engagement with mobile technologies to achieve weight  
loss. Meeting the study aims will provide intervention protocol testing for application in a  
larger, fully powered R01 clinical study. This R01 will generate new scientifi c knowledge 
as there are few weight loss inquiries targeted to men in the U.S., and no such analyses 
were  found with rural men. Scientific knowledge gained through community -engaged 
partnerships  addresses a significant barrier to progress in the field of r ural mens weight 
loss research by  [CONTACT_330055], retention, and local preferences for this hard- to-
reach, underserved  population. This study will have a substantial effect on 
strengthening the research environment at the UNMC -College of Nursings (C ON) 
Northern Division (ND), located in  Norfolk, NE (population 22,400, RUCA code 4-
micropolitan area core) by [CONTACT_330056]. This study also has the potential to impact nursing science through 
the training of future nurse researchers in rural  research.  
 
This study is innovative in that 1) it applies an intervention shown to be effective for weight  loss in other populations, SM, to an unstudied and underserved population of 
overweight  and obese rural , U.S. men, 2) while SM was found to be feasible and 
acceptable in our  preliminary study, the delivery of a more comprehensive MT+ 
intervention (SM app with social comparison group, Wi -Fi scale, and SMS via 
smartphone intervention) has not been studied, and 3) the integration of CEnR with a 
pragmatic RCT is a novel way to design and deliver a weight loss intervention that 
facilitates local buy -in and is sensitive to context. The use of student nurses to support 
community outreach, the CAB to inform all stages of the study, and the use of both 
qualitative and quantitative data methods/analyses will support  maximum community 
engagement for comprehensive understanding of SM eating and  activity for weight loss. 
By [CONTACT_330057], we  hope to ignite new 
opportunities for inquiry in this area based upon the ongoing, nurtured research 
relationships that community -engaged approaches have established and through  
learning from the experiences of others.
[ADDRESS_407782]. Eisenhauer (PI) led  
an interdisciplinary team, which included two doctoral students and one MSN student, to  
examine the feasibil ity and acceptability of an mHealth SM intervention that included 
health related text messages and the use of the FitBit One® (fitness monitor) with a 
comparison app to log daily food intake and monitor activity. Using CEnR strategies, 
eight community  leaders from six rural towns participated by [CONTACT_330058],  sharing materials about the study, and verifying their interes t in 
participating prior to contact  [CONTACT_118735]. Twelve rural men were recruited and 
participated in an initial assessment and orientation session. For three weeks, they 
received text messages and used the FitBit One®  to self -monitor eating and activity, 
after which they attended a 90- minute focus group session. FitBit One® and text 
messaging were acceptable and useful; however, the food log options needed 
adaptation to reflect dietary norms of rural men. 6This preliminary study  informs the 
proposed study by  [CONTACT_330059]. 6 This study will continue  
using CEnR strategies, but will recruit a larger sample, utilize text messaging, and use a  
smartphone app designed for weight loss ( Lose -It) with enhanced features for 
monitoring eating and activity. Obesity prevention and access to resources to promote 
healthy eating and activity is a local priority by [CONTACT_330060] 
68and among lay community members in our study region. 23 
 
  
Undergraduate students are a CEnR resource for rural communities.  This study will  
expose 42 undergraduate and 2 graduate assistant student nurses (GAs) from the 
College  of Nursing (CON) Northern Division (ND) to rur al research. The two graduate 
assistants will not be asked to participate in the study for purposes of data collection. 
Rather these  students will work in role of research assistant, for which they do not need 
consents but  rather listed as a team members on the IRB protocol.  The CON ND 
campus has 96 enrolled students, and 70% of the student body are from  
Northeast Nebraska. Senior -level undergraduate student nurses (n=42) during their  
populations health course are currently trained in community engagement and partnership building for health promotion. Study months 1- 4, students will participate in 
groups of 6- 8 (on a clinical rotation schedule to maintain feasibility) in designing and 
evaluating community outreach strategies (recruitment, social marketing for businesses,  
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/adapting community engagement strategies for community leaders, best  
practice approaches for facilitating CAB) which will permit students critical analysis of and experience with community outreach and engagement. Under the direct supervision 
of their  course faculty and in collaboration with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_330033], students will 
develop,  implement, and evaluate community outreach strategies for community 
engagement.  Activities may include 1) developi[INVESTIGATOR_330034], 
2) strategically  determining recruitment material dissemination, 3) establish community  
resource maps, and 4) identifying community leaders and lay persons to foster study 
engagement. Not only will  the students formal course training provide them with the 
skills necessary to conduct these  roles in this research study, but their understanding of 
the rural region makes them a valuable resource, as they are more likely to plan 
meaningful and locally effective outreach strategies. Two graduate- level students will be 
hired as graduate assistants on the project.  The involvement of rural students fr om the 
ND in a community -based pragmatic trial has  high impact. Through nurturing future rural 
nurse researchers and clinical nurses by [CONTACT_330061]/outreach 
principles that work best with rural populations, this  creates the potential to stimulate 
research on this campus and in this rural region. The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_330035]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_330036] l

Sub-study  
 
Physical activity behaviors (mode, intensity, and duration) are linked to promoting  
healthy weight, maintaining overall health, optimizing func tional abilities such as gait 
and mobility patterns, and reducing risk of disability 3. Knowledge about physical activity  
behaviors among hard -to-reach rural men is limited. In our current feasibility trial (R15) 
for promoting weight loss in rural men, we are using smart phones to measure mens 
step count  as a general indicator of total physical activity. This method does not allow 
for complex  analysis of activity quantity or quality, nor does it produce reliable gait data 
because of step count underestimation  due to phone non- carrying time 4. Wearable 
sensor -based multidimensional gait analysis is a quantitative method for predicting 
critical biomechanical  measures of physical activity in specific populations and in real -
world settings 5. To our  knowledge, there has been no established objective baseline for 
complex analysis of  physical activity behaviors, such as activity pattern analyses using 
a multidimensional gait  metric in rural men.  
 
Accrual  
 A total of 8- [ADDRESS_407783] members (CAB), 42 student nurses from the  
UNMC Northern Division NRSG 413 Population Centered Care course, and 80 rural male  subjects (40 per group) are needed to achieve the proposed objectives.  The 
sample will consist of 80 men (40/group) who meet the inclusion criteria.  Hertzog 
74suggested that [ADDRESS_407784] size with which to perform a power 
analysis for  subsequent research, so 40 participants per group will be sought, for a total 
of 80. Some participants will likely not complete the study, so we will enroll 80 men to 
allow for up to a 30% attrition rate. Power for the repeated measures analysis of 
variance (RM -ANOVA) was  determined using G*Power 3.1.9. A within- between 
interaction will be the primary test of  significance (time*group interaction).  Assuming a 
small effect size (f=.10),75 a significance level of .05, 3 time points, and an estimate of 
.5 for the correlation between time points, 164 participants (82 per group) would be 
needed to have 80% power. Because this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_27041], a smaller sample size is 
justified, and the results of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_330037] a future study.  
Purposeful  justification for the total number of community advisory board members and  
student nurses is based upon their informat ion rich knowledge of the rural context as 
either  community leaders or students in a rural college of nursing. Justification of the 
total sample size desired for the community advisory board is based upon optimal group 
function /  interaction (8 -10 persons) documented in previous advisory board work in 
agricultural based locales (Kingman, Yoder, Hodge, Ortega, & Field, 2004). Justification 
for inclusion of 42 student nurses was based upon the aim of the R -15 AREA NIH 
mechanism to expose undergraduate students  to research. Community outreach is a 
concept taught in NRSG 413-  Population Centered Care. It was deemed feasible to 
involve all students enrolled in this  NRSG 413 course to the community outreach activity 
of this study - without excluding any  student.

 Feasibility Substudy: We would like to recruit 15 men, newly joining and currently enrolled in our weight loss trial, via convenience sampling (asked in the calendar order 
they present for  their baseline, 3- month, or 6- month assessment visit in the current  
clinical trial) to participate  in this sub -study. Both arms in our clinical trial receive the 
same education/instruction about  physical activity (i.e. goal of 10,000 steps per day).

Methods  
 
This team will use multiple strategies to recruit rural  
men based upon approaches that have been used successfully i n this region and  
demonstrated positive outcomes for recruitment and retention. 6, 23, 76, [ADDRESS_407789]. In study months 1- 4, formal and 
informal  community leaders within rural men's social network/region  (i.e., farmers, 
insurance  sales/machinery -implement dealers, extension board staff, and community 
health workers)  will be sought via community outreach strategies identified by [CONTACT_330064] (ND)  student nurses and the PI. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_330038] a CAB  to inform the local priority issue of overweight/obesity among 
rural men. The CAB  composition will include [ADDRESS_407790] practice in Ag- centered communities 79, 80. Meetings will also be available via 
Zoom video chat technology to CAB members, which is freely  accessible on the internet 
and feasible to use in low -band width internet locales via smartphone, PC, tablet, o r 
laptops, to limit access barriers (weather, time) which might  inhibit attendance. 
Community leaders will be encouraged to co- lead the CAB meetings  supporting mutual 
partnership and leadership development. CAB members will assist  recruitment by 1) 
informing the approach, material content and imaging, and targeted venues for social 
marketing, and 2) the dissemination of recruitment materials and direct  referral of 
eligible participants. CAB members will be given the option to refuse to have their  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_330039], consistent with CEnR principles.  
 
UNMC Northern Division Student Nurses Enrolled in NRSG 413-  Population Centered 
Care  course receive training in community outreach / community engagement as an 
expected course outcome. Students in this course will spend 2 hours of their assigned 
course clinical  time in group discussion with the principal investigator, Christine 
Eisenhauer, who is an  advanced practice public health nurse. The discussion will 
involve planning community  outreach and community engagement strategies for our 
study region that may enhance recruitment and retention of CAB members and 
subjects. Students will be asked to identify  strategies for enhancing the planned 
community outreach and community engagement  specific to rural populations for this 
study. Activities will include determining strategic  recruitment material dissemination, 
creating community resource maps, and identifying  community leaders and lay persons 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_330040]. Prior to beginning the discussion, students 
will be asked to complete a short survey about their  understanding of the public health 
nurse role in community outreach /  community  engagement. The students will be asked 
to complete the same survey post discussion to determine if the discussion experience 
enhanced their understanding of this role.  
 
Intervention: The proposed feasibility study is a pragmatic RCT. Rural men (ages 40-
69) will be recruited over a 12 month period to obtain a target enrollment of 80 subjects.  
Subjects will either be allocated to the intervention (Lose- It Premium with social 
comparison group, Wi -Fi scale for self -monitoring, plus SMS support messages for 
weight loss - MT+)  (n=40) or the comparison group (Lose- It Basic - MT) (n=40). These 
group sizes reflect  oversampling by 30% in each group to allow for attrition, based upon 
attrition rate averages.  
 Following informed consent and completion of baseline visit, eligible participants will be randomized 1:1 to either intervention or comparison group. Participants  randomized to the MT+ group will receive Lose -It Premium version (value 
$40) and Wi -Fi Nokia Body+ scale ($100). Participants randomized to the MT group will 
receive Lose -It Basic version (free) plus a $25 stipend for their participation in each 
assessment point (3).  The men will be randomly assigned to the intervention and 
comparison groups as they are enrolled using an allocation schedule created by [CONTACT_330065].  The research nurses will not be blinded to the group assignment as 
they must conduct the app download on the subject's phone and conduct orientation 
training of the app with the subject that is  specific to their assignment (basic app vs. 
premium app). Randomization will be predetermined using a random number generator 
and urn randomization to ensure equal  sample sizes.  
 A comparison group (MT) (n=40) of men will  receive the Lose- It Basic app. The basic 
app permits daily self -monitoring of eating and physical  activity and manual logging of 
daily weight. MT participants will be asked at  baseline to self -monitor their eating, 
activity, and weight daily. They will receive no text  message prompts for self -monitoring, 
self-monitoring trend reports, or peer interact ion via    group. MT participants will 
complete assessments at baseline, 3 and 6 months postbaseline.  MT participants will 
only receive text message reminders for their assessment visit  appointment times.  
 Description of the Intervention Group (MT+).  Lose-It Premium permits enhanced  
customization of goal setting, app automated self -monitoring reminders, customized 
email  reports that outline self -monitoring trends important in supporting motivation and 
confidence during periods of behavioral action. The Nokia Wi -Fi scale will provide 
automated coaching,  rewards and recording of weight synced to the Lose- It app 
permitting immediate feedback  and visual maps of weight trends.   
 Research Staff Support -Reminder Prompts : MT+ participants will have research staff  
support available via phone. They will also receive reminder prompts for self -monitoring 
via text an d phone when non- adherence with self -monitoring of dietary intake, physical 
activity  or weight is incomplete for 5 days of greater.  
 
Social Comparison Group: MT+ participants will be enrolled in a private social 
comparison group on Lose -It Premium comprised of other intervention group subjects 
from this study  (same group composition as their texting subgroup). The purpose of the 
social group is to provide social c omparison of others self -monitoring experiences 
providing a mechanism to influence judgment and behavior change towards ones own 
self-monitoring. The social  group will also provide social support to MT+ participants 
while completing the trial to promote long- term success. 81, [ADDRESS_407791] topi[INVESTIGATOR_330041] (ie. 10,000 steps per day for physical activity or 8- 10 
glasses of water per day). Men will also be  encouraged to post useful strategies and 
progress reports related to self -monitoring and weight loss. Participants will be 
encouraged to post a minimum of weekly.  
 
Text Messages : A text message library will be developed by [CONTACT_330066] 51, 59, 83, 84 and 
preferred by [CONTACT_10664]. 56, 62, 63 Text message content will include a variety of topi[INVESTIGATOR_330042], nutrition and physical activity behaviors to be enacted and avoided, SM portion control, strategies for overcoming barriers, and health living challenges. Content 
for text  messages will be adapted from healthy eating and physical activity promoting 
resources that  include USDA Choose My Plate
85and CDC and Prevention: Physi cal 
Activity 86including  targeted aerobic physical activity, monitoring of body weight, 
behaviors needed to sustain weight loss, promoting success and rewarding oneself, 
preventing failure and avoiding  temptations. 51 Messages will also target interpersonal 
support surrounding weight loss  behaviors (i.e. Tell your partner/friend about a way you 
have found to get in more physical  activity steps a day). See exemplar of text messages 
in attached documents. Additional text  messages developed will be submitted to IRB for 
approval. CAB members will inform the content of the text messages for local relevance 
prior to dissemination with the MT+  participants.  
 Research nurses will conduct face- to-face assessments and surveys with participants at  
baseline, [ADDRESS_407792] two evaluative focus  
groups with a purposively selected subsection of the intervention group (n=8 per group) to obtain perspec tives on perceived outcomes and utilization of behavioral strategies 
from the  intervention and the feasibility and acceptability of the technologies. (See 
Figure 2) . 
 Procedures / Data Collection and Management.  CAB.  The community advisory board 
(CAB) will t rial Lose- It Premium, including the social  comparison group page, during 
study months 1- [ADDRESS_407793] that contain no personal identifiers (ie. [EMAIL_6452]). These email 
accounts will be  used only for the purpose of setting up a Lose- It account and receiving 
automated Lose- It account reports. No personal communication with subjects will 
happen through these email  accounts. At baseline, both groups will receive an 
informational packet with verbal  instruction focused on a lifestyle change plan for 
healthy eating and activity to accomplish weight loss. Our goal is that the participants 
will demonstrate a weight loss of 5% or more of  their baseline body weight, which is the 
minimum weight loss documented to produce a decrease in health risks (diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease, hypertension).
100-101. 
 Smartphone Use: Each subject will be asked to wear their smart phone during waking  
hours on their hip or in a pocket.  
 Nutritional Plan:  Recommended approaches for achieving negative energy balance  
through reduced caloric intake and increasing physical activity to recommended levels 
will be provided with the primary goal of losing 1- 2 pounds a week during the 3 month 
intervention. Participants caloric eating plan goals will be calculated by [CONTACT_330067] -It app 
based on their age, gender, height,  and activity level tracked in the app.  
 
Physical Activity Plan:  Current recommendations from public health agencies and  
scientific organizations including the NHLBI,(102) DHHS/CDC,
103, 104 and the ACSM 104, 
105outline physical activity as an important part  of weight management.  
Participants will be advised to gradually meet minimal targets 10,000 steps per day 
(goal PA  outcome on Lose - It apps) and 150 minutes a week of moderate- intensity or 
greater activity.  
 Daily Self -Weighing:  Participants will be provided instructions for measuring and 
recording their weight daily. All participants will be 1) oriented to the text messaging 
process, 2)  respond to a test text message to ensure receipt. Participants will receive an 
orientation,  with written instructions and physical demonstration, to Lose -It Basic app. 
Instructional  content will include how to post nutritional intake, recording physical acti vity 
and weight.  Participants will be asked to wear their smart phone during waking hours 
over the next [ADDRESS_407794] their self -measured weight daily. Assessment visits at 3 and 6 months pos t-
baseline will evaluate the participants change in biomarkers, self -report scales, and 
ongoing engagement with the Lose- It app and other health technologies. Each man will 
make an appointment for his  next reassessment at the end of each visit. The nurse will 
text a visit reminder 2 weeks prior  to the next appointment.  
Additional Instructions for MT+.  At the conclusion of the baseline visit, those participants  
randomized to the MT+ group will be given instructional training with demonstration for 
use of the 1) Nokia Body+ Wi -Fi scale, 2) instructional pi[INVESTIGATOR_330043] -Fi scale 106and the Lose -It Premium version app 
features, and 3) a technology support phone number. The GA will call the men within 
two days of their  baseline visit to verify their success in using these feature and answer 
any questions.  Investigators will monitor app usage statistics for MT+ participants daily 
and a GA will  provide reminder prompts via text message, followed by [CONTACT_25600], when 
non-adherence is  observed for greater than [ADDRESS_407795] 
research staff for technical  support via phone. Remind.com will be used to send the text 
messages. Remind.com  provides free text messaging to any smartphone device 
through SMS and doesnt require app download. MT+ participants will receive a text 
message at 8:00am throughout the 3-month intervention peri od. MT participants will 
only receive a text reminder related to their  next assessment point appointment by [CONTACT_330068].  
 
Lose- It Account Retention Option for Subjects at end of Study: As subjects have  
matriculated through our study, many have request ed their desire to retain their Lose- It 
account food log and physical activity data. Because we set up the accounts using dummy  username [CONTACT_304231] - the men are not able to retain their log information in 
Lose- It (basic or premium accounts) unless we conduct a username [CONTACT_330078]. We consulted with our community advisory board members on 1-
14-19- whom  
were in full support of offering subjects an option to change ownership of their Lose- It 
acco unt upon study completion. We have written and tested a procedure for changing  
username [CONTACT_2383] (See Protocol for Lose- It accounts at the end of the study  
document) that will permit the subjects to select/input a password that is not known to us which  will ensure the privacy of their Lose- It account after the time of password 
change. We  will inform the subjects of this option for change of ownership at their 6-
month visit, at which time a revised written consent will be obtained. For those subjects 
who have already  completed the six month visit, we will contact [CONTACT_330069]. Those completers who desire this option will be provided a 
telephone call during which an electronic version of the revised written consent wi ll be 
obtained (as consistent  with our procedures for obtaining informed consent at point of 
enrollment).  
 Focus Groups.  Two evaluative focus groups will be held at [ADDRESS_407796] -baseline with 
a purposive sample of intervention group completers stratified ac cording to their weight 
loss outcome (successful/unsuccessful in achieving 5% baseline body weight loss) to 
solicit their  perceptions on the MT+ intervention efficacy, including 
acceptability/feasibility.
107 Use of two  focus groups permits cross -case compa rative 
analysis of the intervention. 70, 108 Focus group participants will receive $25 for their 
attendance and will be asked to maintain confidentiality  of the contents of the focus 
group discussion. The 90- minute focus groups will be held at the  same community 
center as the assessments and audio recorded. The PI, an experienced focus group 
moderator, will lead the discussion with a semi -structured interview guide informed by 
[CONTACT_330070]. The focus group  
questions will be pretested by [CONTACT_330071], who will also serve as 
scribes during the focus groups, noting non- verbal expressions/gestures, interactions, 
and other  impressions that occur during the group discussion. Questions will be aimed 
at eliciting the  men's experience and perceptions: How did you find the experience of 
tracking your eating,  activity, and weight with the Lose- It app?, How did you find the 
experience of participating in a group comparison page with other study participants ? 
Immediately after the interviews,  the moderator and scribes will write reflective notes as 
to the groups interaction, which created/sustained the descriptive detail shared and 
provide peer -debriefing. The audio files  will be transcribed verbatim. Collectively, the 
interview transcript, peer -debriefing, and reflexive memos will create a decision trail 
which will serve as an audi t trail to demonstrate accountability. 109Audio recordings will 
be deleted after being used to assure the accuracy of  written transcripts during analysis.

After providing informed consent, th e men will be oriented to the ActiGraph GT9X by [CONTACT_330074]. The men will be instructed to wear the ActiGraph GT9X on their right 
hip continuously for seven days 5,6,7, only removing the device for bathing. Subjects will 
also be provided with written  instructions for device use in addition to the hands -on 
demonstration, a troubleshooting number, an activity questionnaire to capture 
recreational and vocational  activity, and postage- paid return envelope. After wearing the 
device for seven days, the men will mail the device back to the UNO investigators, Drs. 
Knarr and Youn. Those men who return the device as indicated will be issued/mailed a 
$25.00 incentive for their participation.  Phone and text reminders will be sent to subjects 
on the eighth day (the day after  completing the 7- day testing) reminding them to return 
their ActiGraph by [CONTACT_330075]. Those men not returning the Actigraph after the phone and 
text reminder will be sent a mailed letter encouraging them to return the device with a 
reminder that fai lure to return the device will result in no incentive received for their 
participation.  
 Analysis:  Accelerometers that  contain a minimum of five 10- hour days, including both 
weekday and weekend days, of  tracking will be eligible for analysis
7, 8. Our collaborating 
investigators -UNO biomechanical  engineer, [CONTACT_330079], and Information Science and 
Technology Specialist, [CONTACT_330080], will  supervise the advanced analyses of our ActiGraph 
data with their UNO graduate students  across four forms: 1) Traditional ActiGraph 
analysis (raw accelerations and step counts per  15 second bouts, 2) Custom bout and 
sedentary analysis, 3) Nonlinear activity pattern analysis, and 4) Applying deep- learning 
and advanced analytics 5,9. Subjects who participate in this sub- study will be mailed a 
single -page, individualized, easy to read, plain language,  
graph report containing their peak activity and sedentary times, as well as a report of  
minutes of minimum, moderate, and vigorous physical activity from their 7- day 
measurement period. Subjects will be given the same troubleshooting number to call if 
they have any questions regarding interpreting this individualized physical activity 
report.  
 Statistica l Analysis  
 Descriptive statistics will be calculated on all variables,  including frequencies and 
percentages for recruitment/r etention, demographic, and categorical variables. Means 
and standard deviations will be calculated for all continuous  variables and measures at 
each time point. Feasibility and acceptability analyses for aim 1  are largely descripti ve, 
as we will be assessing participation rates and percentages of  
eligible men and which were the more effective recruitment methods. Qualitative content  analysis, as described by [CONTACT_330076] (110) will guide interpretation of 
the focus  group findings from the intervention participant groups. The interview 
transcript, reflective  memos and observation notes taken during each focus group will 
comprise one unit of  analysis for within/across case comparison. The topi[INVESTIGATOR_330045] -structured intervi ew guide will be extracted and organized. The researcher will 
read the transcripts for  substantive coding. Data facts will be organized under a priori 
coding categories. The  categories are named a priori because they are built into the 
interview guide ques tions. A  data fact will be defined as those data elements that 
recurred in the interview without lack of  consensus or were least participant to errors in 
inference (111). All data provided in a response to each question will be coded together. 
Incomplete, competing, or alternative  topi[INVESTIGATOR_330046] a priori will be aggregated by [CONTACT_330077]. These topi[INVESTIGATOR_330047].(112). A data matrix will be used to display the coded data to search for 
patterns across coding categories. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_330048], supporting iterative analysis . Data categories will be  re-
contextualized into an account that makes sense for the entire studys data set. 
Meaning,  the findings are integrated to provide new understanding or explanation to the 
interpretation of the intervention outcome data (112). Peer -debriefing and audit 
checking will occur weekly  across the analysis by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_330049].  
 Aim #2: Determine preliminary efficacy of a MT+ intervention to a comparison group  
receiving only a basic self -monitoring app (MT) in achieving 1) weight loss (primary),  
and 2) improved diet and increased PA (secondary) at [ADDRESS_407797] size estimates. Huynh- Feldt corrected F -tests will b e 
used in order to account for any possible violation of sphericity. If there is a higher than 
expected attrition  rate, a maximum likelihood estimation method (e.g. mixed models) will 
be used instead of  RM-ANOVA in order to utilize all available data and n ot delete cases 
in a listwise manner.  Overall weight lost at follow -up will be assessed via an 
independent groups t -test. Outcome  variables that are not normally distributed will either 
be transformed or assessed with nonparametric  methods.  
 Aim #3: Determin e quantitative and qualitative indicators of community capacity  
(resource mobilization, learning opportunities -skills development, partnership  
linkages, participatory decision-  making, leadership) to support a relevant weight  
loss intervention for rural men.  For aim 3, multiple indicators of community capacity will  
be used to evaluate support for the weight loss intervention applying best practice  
recommendations (113), 1) CAB - assessed community capacity change survey report 
by [CONTACT_133111], participation level of members (i.e. # meetings, activities, resources allocated,  
partnership/network linkages, leadership roles assumed), member attrition with reasons,  
Qualitative indicators of community capacity in CAB include perceived benefits/skills gained,  barriers and fa cilitators of retention, proposed strategies to increase retention, 
CAB evaluation of student outreach activities, 2) STUDENTS - clinical log of community 
outreach activities (type, number, hours) developed, implemented, and outcome, 
leadership activities  (dissemination via honors projects, clinical conference and class 
presentations). Qualitative indicators of community capacity among students will include 
perceived skill development,  and leadership confidence. Graduate level students help in 
training sessi ons, data collection and implementation of intervention.  
3) PARTICIPATORY DECISION - MAKING as an  indicator of community capacity will be 
evaluated via CAB survey and tracked ongoing through study. PI [CONTACT_79161]- field notes 
will record student -engaged activities and time points.  
 
SubStudy Aim:  To determine the feasibility among a convenience sample of rural men  
currently enrolled in our Rural Men's health study to wear the Actigraph GT9X (single  
wearable sensor) for seven continuous days to measure their physical activity among the total volume of activity bouts across three gait dimensions: intensity, symmetry, and  
variability.

2.1 Background and Rationale
Why Is This Study Being Conducted?
Psoriasis is a chronic debilitating immune -mediated disease characterized by [CONTACT_82642], erythematous, scaly plaques involving the skin.  In most developed 
countries, prevalence is between 1.5 and 5%.[ADDRESS_90066] on psychosocial and economic status.2  It is inc reasingly 
recognized that psoriasis is more than a superficial disease, with up to 30% of patients having joint 
involvement and a high correlation between psoriasis and obesity, diabetes, depression, metabolic 
syndrome, and cardiovascular disease.3  While the majority of mild psoriasis patients are managed with 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_12491], those with moderate or severe and/or refractory disease usually require phototherapy 
and/or systemic therapy.
Oral systemic agents provide modest efficacy; therefore, patients are increasingly being treated with 
biologi c agents, such as Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) -alpha inhibitors (etanercept or adalimumab), the 
interleukin (IL) -12/23 inhibitor (ustekinumab),4and IL -17A inhibitors (secukinumab and ixekizumab).  
Ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting the common p40 subunit of IL -12 and IL -23, was 
approved for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in 2009, and for Crohn's disease in 
2016.
Secukinumab and ixekizumab are anti -IL-17A antibodies and have been approved by [CONTACT_24623] 
(US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment 
of psoriasis in 2015 and 2016, respectively.  In addition, other recently approved systemic agents for the 
treatment of psoriasis include an IL -17RA inhibitor (brodalumab), IL -23p19 inhibitors, guselkumab and 
tildrakizumab.  Mirikizumab, another IL -[ADDRESS_90067] that IL -23 is disproportionately involved in the maintenance of 
chronic psoriasis.6  IL-23 is thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of psoriasis via induction and 
maintenance of Th17 type cells, and other IL -23 responsive cells.  This is supported by [CONTACT_82643] -17A (the cytokine produced by [CONTACT_78443]17 cells), IL -
17RA, and direct blockade of IL -[ADDRESS_90068] effective anti -TNF and anti -IL-12/23 agents 
provide approximately 75% improvement in psoriasis in about 50 to 80% of patients and these 
responses can be lost over time.  While the anti -IL-17A, -IL-17RA, and -IL-23p19 agents 
(i.e., secukinumab, ixekizumab, brodalumab and guselkumab) may provide better efficacy than anti -TNF 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_82620], they require monthly or every other month i njections .5,7-9
Risankizumab is approved for use in moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in the [LOCATION_002] 
(US) , the European Union (EU), Japan, Canada, Brazil, and Switzerland, with additional global reviews of 
marketing applications ongoing.  Clinical studies are ongoing evaluating risankizumab for use in the 
treatment of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, PsA, hidradenitis suppurativa, and atopic dermatitis.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Risankizumab is a humanized mAb of the immunoglobin (Ig) G1 subclass directed towards IL -23p19.  The 
antibody (Ab) has been engineered to reduce Fcγ receptor and complement binding and potential 
charge heterogeneity.  Risankizumab binds with high affinity to human IL -23.
Today there are multiple treatments with different modes of action available to treat plaque psoriasis 
efficiently.  The risankizumab clinical program assessed the efficacy versus placebo an d other commonly 
used biological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_82621] 1 year.  Risankizumab showed 
high levels of sustained clearance in these clinical trials.  A head -to head randomized controlled trial 
(RCT) is ongoing to compare risankizum ab versus secukinumab up to [ADDRESS_90069] this switch has on patient's 
quality of life and treatment satisfaction.
This study aims to evaluate whether those suboptimal responders on secukinumab or ixekizumab 
benefit significantly from a switch to risankizum ab with regards to skin symptoms, as well as quality of 
life and psoriasis symptoms.
Clinical Hypothesis
Risankizumab will significantly improve skin symptoms and quality of life in subjects with moderate -to-
severe plaque psoriasis who had a suboptimal res ponse to secukinumab or ixekizumab.
2.[ADDRESS_90070] sh own that 
risankizumab has no inhibitory effects on IL -12, the inhibition of which has been associated with 
increased risk of serious infections .10,11  Selective IL- 23 inhibition may not increase risk of serious 
infection, including mycobacterial infections .12  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_82622], 
many subjects still do not respond adequately to these treatments, or gradually lose response over time.  
In Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of risankizumab in subjects with psoriasis, the majority of subjects 
receiving risankizumab achieved 90% improvement of their disease and risankizumab was well 
tolerated.  Recently, positive top -line results were observed from [ADDRESS_90071] a 90% improvement in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI 90) 
and a static physician global assessment (sPGA) score of clear or almost clear (sPGA 0 or 1) for 
risankizumab (150 mg) treatment versus ustekinumab, placebo and adalimumab.13-15  The safety profile 
was consistent with that observed in Phase 2 clinical trials, with no important identified risks for 
risankizumab.  As with many immune modulating agents, risankizumab may impair immune function 
resulting in a risk of infection.  This will be monitored by [CONTACT_82644] (AEs) during the 
treatment and obser vation periods.  In addition, subjects with clinically important active infection will 
not be included in the study.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].In the Phase 3 clinical trial program for risankizumab, up to 57% of subjects had prior exposure to 
biologics including IL -17 inhibitors.  Consistent PASI 90 responses were observed regardless of prior 
psoriasis treatment, including those who were bio -naïve or who reported prior biologic exposure to 
IL-17 inhibitors at Week 16 (74 -77%) and Week 52 (78 -81%).16  Even in subjects who reported failing 
prior biologics (including those with primary or secondary non -response), risankizumab treatment 
resulted in high levels of PASI 90 response.  In terms of safety, the Phase 3 clinical trials ranged from 
30% prior biologic exposure in UltIMMa –1 and –2 to 57% in IMMhance and there were no differences 
observed in the safety profile across the trials.  Furthermore, no additional safety concerns were 
identified in the [ADDRESS_90072] 6 months and are experiencing a sub -optimal response.
As with many immune modulating agents, risankizumab may impair immune function, resulting in a risk 
of infection.  This will be monitor ed by [CONTACT_82645].  In addition, subjects with active infection will not be included in the study.
Subjects with a positive QuantiFERON® -TB (or interferon gamma release assay [IGRA] equivalent)/ TB
skin test result for TB must fulfill entry criteria as specified in Section 5.1of this protocol.  IL -23 inhibition 
is not known to increase the risk of T B infection or impair the response to TB infection in animal 
models .17,18  Thus, subjects with positive QuantiFERON® -TB Gold testing (or IGRA equivalent)/TB skin 
test who have latent TB (defined by [CONTACT_13144]) are not required to be treated (unless 
recommended by [CONTACT_82646]) with anti- TB therapy prior to receiving 
risankizum ab but should be carefully monitored for any sign of TB reactivation.
Published literature indicates that inhibition of IL -[ADDRESS_90073] of IL -23 p19 inhibition in animal models, both for pre -existing and tumor -induction 
models.22  While there is not enough clinical information at this time to rule out a risk of cancer with 
risankizumab, this risk is considered small.
Although rare, a potential for hepatic AEs i s under constant surveillance by [CONTACT_23274].  
Therefore, this study requires timely detection, evaluation, and follow -up of laboratory alterations in 
selected liver laboratory parameters to ensure subjects' safety.
Increases in major adverse cardiovascular (MACE) events, including myocardial infarction, 
cerebrovascular accident, and cardiovascular death, were initially reported with anti- IL-12/[ADDRESS_90074] not been observed in longer term studies.  While the likelihood o f increased 
MACE is small, all suspected cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (serious or non -serious) observed 
in this study will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_82647] (CAC).  The 
committee will remain blinded to treatment allocation (Section 6.2).

practice would switch those patients to another biologic to improve skin symptoms and patient's quality 
of life.  Current international guidelines for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis adopted "skin 
clearance" as a new treatment goal, as newer biologic treatments are able to provide this clearance to a 
majority of patients, which directly links to the improvement of patient's quality of life and 
workability .24-26

3.5 Safety Parameters
Safety evaluations include AE monitoring, physical examinations, vital sign measurements, 
electrocardiograms (ECG), and clinical labor atory testing (hematology, chemistry and urinalysis) as a 
measure of safety and tolerability for the entire study duration.
3.6 Biomarker Research
For subjects who consent, optional samples (whole blood, serum, plasma and tissue) will be collected at 
specific visits as listed in the Optional Biomarker Research Sample Activity Schedule ( Appendix E) to 
evaluate known and or novel disease related or drug related biomarkers.  Types of biomarkers may 
include nucleic acids, proteins, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], and/or metabolites.  The objective of research is to analyze 
samples for biomarkers that will help to understand psoriasis, related conditions, response to treatment 
with ris ankizumab or similar compounds.  Research on samples collected in [LOCATION_013] will be limited to 
psoriasis and risankizumab.  Research may also include changes in epi[INVESTIGATOR_7009], gene expression, and

should be advised on the continued scientific importance of their data even if they discontinue 
treatment with study drug early.
Premature Discontinuation of Study (Withdrawal of Informed Consent)
If a subject prematurely discontinues study participation (withdrawal of informed consent), the 
procedures outlined for the Premature Discontinuation visit (PD visit) shou ld be completed as soon as 
possible, preferably within [ADDRESS_90098] dose of study drug may be completed to ensure all treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs)/serious adverse events (SAEs) have been resolved.
For subjects to be considered lost to follow -up, reasonable attempts must be made to obtain 
information on the subject's final status.  At a minimum, [ADDRESS_90099]'s source documentation.
In the event a subject withdraws consent from the clinical study, biomarker research will continue 
unless the subject explicitly requests analysis to be stopped.  When [COMPANY_013] is informed that samples are 
withdrawn from research, samples will not be analyzed, no new biomarker analysis data will be 
collected, and the samples will be destroyed.  A subject may withdraw consent for optional biomarker 
research at any time and remain in the clinical study.  Data ge nerated from biomarker research, before 
subject withdrawal of consent, will remain part of the study results.

the investigator is responsible for notifying independent ethics committee (IEC)/independent review 
board (IRB), regulatory authorities (as applicable), and [COMPANY_013].
6SAFETY CON SIDERATIONS
6.[ADDRESS_90105]/device.  Complaints associated with any component of this investigational 
product must be reported to [COMPANY_013].
Product Complaint
A product complaint is any complaint related to the biologic or drug component of the product or to the 
medical device component(s).
For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or packaging, product 
appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the 
labelin g/instructions (e.g., printing illegible), missing components/product, device not working properly, 
or packaging issues.
Product complaints concerning the investigational product and/or device must be reported to [COMPANY_013] 
within 1 business day of the study s ite's knowledge of the event.  Product complaints occurring during 
the study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion.
Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
Page 24 of 89

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].this treatment.  An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), sy mptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the 
product.
The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs on a routine basis 
throughout the study.  All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during the study will not be considered an AE if the 
surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre- existing condition and/or the surgery/procedure has 
been pre -planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre -existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly 
during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the cond ition 
for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE.
If an AE, whether associated with study drug or not, meets any of the following criteria, it is to be 
reported to [COMPANY_013] clinical pharmacovigilance or contract research organization (CRO) (as appropriate) 
as an SAE within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the SAE (refer to Section 4.3 of the 
Operations Manual [ Appendix G] for reporting details and contact [CONTACT_3031]).
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would have resulted in 
immediate fatality if medical interve ntion had not been taken.  This does 
not include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a 
more severe form.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_82628]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This does not include an 
emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in 
fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the 
activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not intended to 
include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as 
headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).
Page 25 of 89 
STUDY M19 -164  |  Version 2.0  |  EudraCT [ADDRESS_90106] and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above 
(i.e., death of subject, life threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongatio n of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion 
or stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  Examples of such 
events include allergic bronchospas m requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.
All adverse events reported from the time of study drug administration until 140 days (20 weeks) after 
discontinuation of study drug administration will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously 
reported by [CONTACT_423].  In addition, SAEs and protocol -related nonserious AEs will be collected from 
the ti me the subject signs the study -specific informed consent.
[COMPANY_013] will be responsible for Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) reporting for 
the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) in accordance with global and local requirements.
Adve rse events will be monitored throughout the study to identify any of special interest that may 
indicate a trend or risk to subjects.
Areas of Safety Interest
Infections, especially opportunistic infections, are a theoretical risk with immunomodulators.  Su bjects 
will be screened and monitored throughout the study for Areas of Safety Interest (ASI).  Screening 
procedures are outlined in the Activity Schedule ( Appendix D).
In consideration of the ASI, the following supplemental report form(s) must be completed if AEs in any 
of the following areas are reported during the study ( Table 2).

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].The investigator will use the following definitions to as sess the relationship of the AE to the use of study 
drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is 
sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is 
insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
Pregnancy
While not an AE, pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_90107] be 
discontinued (Section 5.5).  If a pregnancy occurs in a study subject, information regarding the 
pregnancy and the outcome will be collected.
The preg nancy outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly is 
considered a SAE and must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within 24 hours after the site becomes aware of the 
event.
6.2 Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee (CAC)
An independent adjudication committee will adjudicate all observed cardio -and cerebro -vascular events 
and will remain blinded to treatment allocation.  The events that are adjudicated and the adjudication 
process will be detailed in the Cardiovascular Adjudication Commi ttee (CAC) Charter.  Dedicated eCRFs 
will be used as outlined in Table 2.
In addition, the site may be contact[CONTACT_82656].
6.3 Anaphylaxis Adjudication Committee
While no concerns with anaphylaxis/systemic hypersensitivity have been identified with the use of 
risankizumab, the sponsor has established an independent, blinded, expert committee to adjudicate 
events of anaphylaxis ba sed on pre -specified definitions.  This independent external Anaphylaxis 
Adjudication Committee (AAC) will adjudicate suspected anaphylactic reactions and will remain blinded 
to treatment allocation. The event terms to be adjudicated and the adjudication process are detailed in 
the AAC Charter.  A supplemental Hypersensitivity Reactions Signs and Symptoms eCRF will be used to 
collect information pertinent to the events.  In addition, the site may be contact[CONTACT_82657].
If a suspe cted systemic hypersensitivity reaction occurs at the investigative site, subjects should be 
tested for tryptase and histamine levels.  If a systemic hypersensitivity reaction such as anaphylaxis is 
observed or reported while the subject is not at the inve stigative site, every effort should be made to 
obtain tryptase and histamine levels from the treating facility to help better characterize the diagnosis.

Baseline visits and are switched to risankizumab at Baseline (Week 0).
For ease of description, Period A refers to Weeks [ADDRESS_90109] of the study.
The Primary Analysis for all efficacy endpoints pertaining to Period A will be conducted after all 
continuing subjects completed Week 16 and all data pertaining to Period A are cleaned and when a 
database lock will occur to enable the analysis.  This is the one and final efficacy analysis for Period A.  
The resul ts will be included in an interim clinical study report to support the efficacy and safety 
evaluation of the initial 16 weeks of treatment.
The Primary Analysis for all efficacy endpoints in Period B will be conducted at the study completion.
The statistic al analyses will be described and fully documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  The 
SAP will be finalized prior to the database lock for the Primary Analysis for Period A.  The statistical 
analyses will be performed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc ., Cary, North Carolina, [LOCATION_003]).
7.2 Definition for Analysis Population
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population, which is defined as all subjects who have at least [ADDRESS_90110] ion 
will be used as Baseline for safety and efficacy analyses.  Descriptive statistics will be reported at 
baseline, primary time point of Week 16 and at study end of Week 52 in overall population and clinically 
important subgroups.  Categorical endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_82658], percentages, and 
associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs).  Continuous endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_3163], 
standard deviations as well model based least square means, standard errors, and the 95% CIs after 
accounting for relevant baseline characteristics.  Stratified analysis by [CONTACT_82659].

data due to COVID -19 (NRI -C) fo r categorical endpoints and mixed effect model repeat measurements 
(MMRM) for continuous endpoints.  As -observed analysis will also be performed to handle missing data 
as sensitivity analysis for the primary and secondary endpoints.
Non -Responder Imputatio n incorporating multiple imputation to handle missing data due to COVID -19 
(NRI- C):  Missing data due to a COVID -19 infection or logistical restrictions related to the COVID -19 
pandemic will be handled through multiple imputation (MI).  Missing data at a s cheduled assessment 
visit due to reasons other than the COVID -19 pandemic will be handled by [CONTACT_82660].
Details on the efficacy analyses are provided in the SAP.
Sample Size Estimation
There is no published literature or clinical trial data to acc urately estimate the primary endpoint of sPGA 
0/1 response rate at Week 16 for this study population –suboptimal response of subjects treated with 
secukinumab or ixekizumab.  The assumption for risankizumab sPGA 0/1 response rate at Week 16 is 
expected to be between  based on the subjects who self -reported as prior IL -17 failure in 
Phase 3 trials ULTIMMA 1 & 2 and IMMhance.
The statistical precision measured by [CONTACT_2016]- width of 95% confidence interval (CI) is the main criteria for 
sample size determ ination.  By [CONTACT_82661], a choice of 250 subjects is 
associated with a half- width of no more than  across all possible response rates ( Figure 2).

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].A total of 250 subjects will be enrolled in this study.  From historical data of enrollment of the psoriasis 
studies conducted by [CONTACT_26282], the projected screen failure (SF) rate is .  Thus,  subjects will be 
needed to be screened to enroll 250 subjects.
7.4 Statistical Analyses for Safety
The safety analyses will be carried out using the Safety Analysis Set.  Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_2695], 
physical examination, laboratory assessments, and vital signs.  Analysis details will be specified in the 
SAP.
Adverse events will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Treatment -
emergent AEs are defined as those that began or worsened in severity after the first dose of study drug 
and within 140 days (20 weeks) after the last dose of study drug.  The number and percentage of 
subjects experiencing TEAEs will be tabulated using t he MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and preferred 
term (PT), by [CONTACT_926], and by [CONTACT_82662].  Summaries 
(including percentages and events per 100 patient -years) of SAEs, deaths, AEs leading to discontinuat ion 
and Area of Safety Interest (ASI) will be provided as well.  Pre -treatment AEs will be summarized 
separately.
For selected laboratory and vital signs, mean change from baseline and percentage of subjects with 
evaluations meeting criteria for pre -defined Potentially Clinically Significant (PCS) values will be 
summarized.
7.5 Interim Analysis
The interim analysis for all efficacy and safety data of Period A (Week 0 –16) will be conducted after 
50% of all continuing subjects completed Week 16 visit and when an interim database lock will occur to 
enable the analysis.  The goal is to preliminarily assess response rates and potentially enable a potential 
earlier scientific communication.

adverse event).
i. The ECG should be performed prior to blood collection.  For subjects with a normal ECG taken within 90 days of Screening, a r epeat ECG at Screening will not be required; 
provided all protocol -required documentation is available, and nothing has changed in the subject's health status since the time of the test that warrants a repeat test.
j. At Screening visit until prior to the first dose of study drug, serious AEs and protocol -related non -serious AEs that occur after a subject signs the informed consen t have to be 
collected.  From the time of first study drug administration until 140 days (20 weeks) following discontinuation of study treatment has elapsed, all AEs and SAEs will be 
collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_423].  I f appropriate, a targeted physical exam should be performed.  If an anaphylactic reaction is suspected, a 
serum tryptase and a plasma histamine sample will be drawn.
k. For all female subjects of childbearing potential, collect urine for pregnancy test at Baseline and all subsequent visits when the female subjects will receive study drug.  More 
frequent pregnancy tests will be performed throughout the study if required per local/country requirements.  If urine pregnan cy test (which is performed at the site) is 
negative, begin or continue dosing.  If urine pregnancy test is positive, withhold study drug dosing and perform a serum preg nancy test.  Pregnant subjects must discontinue 
from study drug treatment.  Refer to Section 6.1Complaints and Adverse Events for additional details.
l. A urine dipstick macroscopic urinalysis will be completed by [CONTACT_2237].  A microscopic analysis will be perfor med in the event the dipstick results show leukocytes, 
nitrite, protein, ketones, or blood greater than negative or glucose greater than normal.
m. HIV testing will be performed at Screening Visit.  The Investigator must discuss any local reporting require ments to local health agencies with the subject.  The site will report 
confirmed positive results to their health agency per local regulations, if necessary.  If a subject has a confirmed positive result, the Investigator must discuss with the subject 
the potential implications to the subject's health and subject should receive or be referred for clinical care promptly.  A subje ct will not be eligible for study participation if test 
results indicate a positive HIV infection.  [COMPANY_013] will not receive results from the testing and will not be made aware of any positive result.
n. FSH should be tested at Screening if the female subject is < 55 years of age AND has had no menses for ≥ [ADDRESS_90125] is necessary (pregnancy is an exclusion criterion).  If still borderline ≥ [ADDRESS_90126] can be enrolled into the study.
p. TB testing will be performed at Screening Visit.  Refer to Tubercu losis Testing section of the Operations Manual for further information.
q. Lipid testing required at Baseline (Week 0), Week 16, and Week 52.  A minimum [ADDRESS_90127] ances, the non -fasting status will be recorded in study source documentation and lab requisition.
r. Study drug will be administered at the study site by [CONTACT_1747] (e.g., study nurse) after all study procedures have been completed.
Note: Visit window is ± 3 days for the visits Week 4 up to Week 16, and ± 7 days thereafter.  Any of the procedures may be performed at an unscheduled visit at the discretion of

A complete medical and surgical history including history of hepatitis B vaccination, tuberculosis (TB) 
screening, tobacco, alcohol, and drug use will be taken at screening.  The subject's medical a nd surgical 
history will be updated at the Study Baseline (Week 0) visit.  This updated medical history will serve as 
the baseline for clinical Drug and Alcohol Screen.
Subjects should have no history of clinically significant (per investigator's judgment) drug or alcohol 
abuse within the last [ADDRESS_90136] Questionnaires
Subjects will complete t he self -administered patient -reported outcome (PRO) instrument (when allowed 
per local regulatory guidelines).  Subjects should be instructed to follow the instructions provided with 
the instrument and to provide the best possible response to each item.  Site personnel shall not provide 
interpretation or assistance to subjects other than encouragement to complete the tasks.  Subjects who 
are functionally unable to read any of the instruments may have site personnel read the questionnaire 
to them.  Site pers onnel will encourage completion of the instrument at all specified visits.
The subject should complete the questionnaires before site personnel perform any clinical assessments 
and before any interaction with site personnel has occurred to avoid biasing th e subject's response.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].PROs will be completed prior to any clinical assessments and treatment administration following the 
schedule of activities outlined in the protocol.
Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)
The DLQI is a self -administered, 10 -question questionnaire covering 6 domains (symptoms and feelings, 
daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and bother with psoriasis treatment) 
(Appendix 8.1).  The response options range from 0, not affected at all, to 3, very much affected.  This 
gives an overall range of 0 to 30 where lower scores mean better quality of life.
Psoriasis S ymptoms Scale (PSS)
The PSS is a 4 -item patient -reported outcome (PRO) instrument that assesses the severity of psoriasis 
symptoms in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis (Appendix 8.2).  The symptoms included are:  
pain, redness, itching and burning from psoriasis.  Current symptom severity is assessed as a daily diary, 
using a 5 -point Likert -type scale ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe). The PSS was developed based 
on published evidence supporting the development of two similar, proprietary PRO instruments:  the 
Psoriasis Symptom Inventory and the Psoriasis Symptom Diary.
Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication Version 9 (TSQM -9)
The abbreviated 9 -item TSQM (TSQM -9) assesses patient's satisfaction with medication through 9 items 
representing 3 domains:  Effectiveness (3 items), Convenience (3 items), and Global Satisfaction scale 
(3items), scored by [CONTACT_82666] 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher satisfaction 
(Appendix 8.3).
The TSQM -[ADDRESS_90137] medication use.
A score can be obtained for each domain by [CONTACT_82667] a 0 –
100 scale (0 = complete dissatisfact ion, 100 = maximum satisfaction).  Higher values indicate higher 
satisfaction, better perceived effectiveness, lower burden associated to side -effects, and better 
convenience.
3.5 Efficacy Assessments
Efficacy assessments will be recorded on paper worksheets a nd entered into the electronic case report 
form (eCRF) and conducted at the study visits specified in the protocol.  To minimize variability, the 
same assessor should evaluate the subject at each visit for the duration of the trial.  A back -up assessor 
should be identified.  The assessor must be a qualified medical professional (e.g., nurse, physician's 
assistant, or physician).  Any assessor must have completed training for skin assessments (PASI, BSA, and 
sPGA) as detailed by [CONTACT_3211] , and be competent in performing such assessments.  It is the responsibility 
of the site investigator to ensure that all assessors are qualified and trained to perform assessments and 
that all training is documented.  If the assessor is not available, the pre -identified back -upassessor 
should perform such assessments.

Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI)
The PASI is a measure of psoriasis severity.  Four anatomic sites –head, upper extremities, trunk, and 
lower extremities –are assessed for erythema, ind uration and desquamation using a 5 -point scale 
(Appendix 8.4).  Based on the extent of lesions in a given anatomic site, the area affected is assigne d a 
numerical value.  Since the head, upper extremities, trunk and lower extremities correspond to 
approximately 10, 20, 30 and 40% of body surface area, respectively; the PASI score is calculated using 
the formula:
PASI = 0.1(Eh + Ih + Dh)Ah + 0.2(Eu + Iu + Du)Au + 0.3(Et + It + Dt)At + 0.4(El + Il + Dl)Al
Where E, I, D , and A denote erythema, induration, desquamation, and area, respectively, and h, u, t , and 
ldenote head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities, respectively.  PASI scores range f rom 
0.0to 72.[ADDRESS_90138] possible degree.
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_82631] 3 or less represent mild disease, scores over 3 and up and including 15 represent 
moderate disease and scores over 15 are conside red to be associated with severe disease.
Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA)
This sPGA is a 5 -point score ranging from 0 to 4, based on the physician's assessment of the average 
thickness, erythema, and scaling of all psoriatic lesions (Appendix 8.5).
The assessment is considered "static" which refers to the patient's disease state at the time of the 
assessments, without comparison to any of the patient's previous disease states, whether at Baseline or 
at a previous visit.
Body Surface Area (BSA) – Psoriasis
The subject's right or left hand should be selected as the measuring device.  For purposes of clinical 
estimation, the total surface of the palm plus five digits will be assumed to be approximately equivalent 
to 1%.  Measurement of the total area of involvement by [CONTACT_82668] 
(Appendix 8.6).
3.6 Biomarker Research Sampling
For subjects who consent, optional samples (whole blood, serum, plasma, and tissue) will be collected 
for biomarker research.  Please refer to Section 2.1for the schedule of biomarker research sample 
collections.  All biomarker samples should be labeled and shipped as outlined in the study -specific 
laboratory manual.  [COMPANY_013] (or people or companies working with [COMPANY_013]) will store the samples and 
data in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  The sample s may be 
retained while research on risankizumab (or drugs of this class) or psoriasis and related conditions 
continues, but for no longer than 20 years after study completion, or per local requirement.

3.10 Physical Examination
A complete physical examination will be performed at the designated study visits a s specified in 
Section 2.1.  The physical examination performed on Baseline (Week 0) will serve as the baseline 
physical examination for the entire study.  Any significant physical examination findings after the 
first dose will be recorded as adverse events.  All findings, whether related to an AE or part of each 
subject's medical history, will be captured on the appropriate eCRF page.
At any time, a symptom -directed physical examination can be performed as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1275].
3.11 Study Drug Administration
Study drug will be administered to subjects beginning at Baseline (Week 0) and as specified in 
Section 2.1.  All subcutaneous (SC) doses of risankizumab will be administered by [CONTACT_82669] [ADDRESS_90144] time (to the nearest 
minute) of study drug administration will be recorded on eCRFs.  The first dose of study drug will be 
administered after all other Baseline (Week 0) procedures are completed.  Injection site locations 
include lower abdomen, thigh, or outer upper arm.  Study drug administration instruction for 
risankizumab pre -filled syringes (PFS) will be provided to the site. 
Monitoring for Hypersensitivity Reactions
Therapeutic protein products, such as biologics, may elicit a range of acute effects, from symptomatic 
discomfort to sudden, fatal reactions and may encompass a wide range of clinical events, including 
anaphylaxis and other events that may not be directly related to antibody (Ab) responses, such as 
cytokine releas e syndrome.
Subjects should be closely monitored at the site for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions, 
including allergic reactions and anaphylaxis, for approximately [ADDRESS_90145] be present during the injections.
All appropriate medical support measures (e.g., diphenhydramine, steroids, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], oxygen) for the 
treatment of suspected hypersensitivity reactions should be available for immediate use in the event 
that a suspected hypersensitivity reaction occurs.  Subjects who manifest any new signs or symptoms 
during the injection should be monitored for appropriate resolution prior to leaving the site.  Subjects 
are encouraged to report any symptoms related to a possible injection -related reactions or local 
injection site reaction or late phase reactions to the site any time during the study.  A patient 
information card listing the symptoms of these reactions will be provided to the participants.
Subjects will be monitored throughout the study for signs and symptoms suggestive of hypersensitivity 
reactions, including allergic reactions and anaphylaxis.  In the event of a suspected 
anaphy lactic/systemic hypersensitivity reaction, in addition to the standard AE eCRF, the supplemental 
Hypersensitivity Reaction Signs and Symptoms eCRF should also be completed by [CONTACT_779].  The clinical 
criterion for diagnosing anaphylaxis is provided in Appen dix 8.7for reference; symptoms of anaphylactic 
reaction usually occur within 24 hours after exposure to an allergen.  These are guidelines that are u sed 
to help diagnose anaphylaxis.  The investigator is encouraged to report any suspected reactions.
In the event of a suspected anaphylactic reaction, blood and serum samples should also be collected as 
described in Section 3.12 .
3.12 Clinical Laboratory Tests
A certified laboratory will be utilized to process and provide results for the clinical laboratory tests 
(Table 1).  Laboratory reference ranges will be obtained prior to the initiation of the study.  Instructions 
regarding the collection, processing, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_82632].
The blood samples for serum chemistry tests will be collected following a minimum [ADDRESS_90146] for 
Baseline (Week 0), Week 16, and Week [ADDRESS_90147] measurement prior to 
the initial dose of study drug.
Blood draws should be performed after all questionnaires, clinical assessments, and vital sign 
determinations are obtained.  Unscheduled clinical labs may be obtained at any time during the study if 
deemed ap propriate per investigator's discretion.
For any laboratory test value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be clinically 
significant, the investigator should apply the standard of care for medical evaluation and treatment per 
local guidelines:
The investigator will repeat the test to verify the out- of-range value.
The investigator will follow the out -of-range value to a satisfactory clinical resolution.
A laboratory test value that requires a subject to be discontinued from study drug or requires a subject 
to receive treatment will be recorded as an AE.

Pregnancy testing should not be performed for postmenopausal women.  Determination of 
postmenopausal status will be made during the Screening period based on the subject's history and 
confirmed by [CONTACT_82671], if appropriate.
A pregnant or breastfeeding female will not be eligible for participation or continuation in this study.
Pregnant subjects must discontinue from study drug treatment.  Refer to Section 6.[ADDRESS_90150] will be performed for all female subjects of childbearing potential (defined in 
the protocol) at Screening.  The serum pregnancy test will be sent to and performed by [CONTACT_11378].  If the serum pregnancy test i s positive, the subject is considered a screen failure.  If the 
serum pregnancy test is borderline, it should be repeated to determine eligibility.
If the repeat serum pregnancy test is:
Positive, the subject is considered a screen failure;
Negative, the s ubject can be enrolled into the trial;
Still borderline ≥ 3 days later:  If no clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_82633], the borderline results will be considered 
documentation of continued lack of a pos itive result and the subject can be enrolled into the 
study.
Urine Pregnancy Test
A urine pregnancy test will be performed for all females of childbearing potential at the Baseline Visit 
prior to the first dose of study drug.  Additional urine pregnancy t ests for female subjects of childbearing 
potential will be performed at visits indicated in Section 2.  More frequent pregnancy tests will be 
performe d throughout the study if required per local/country requirements.
If the urine pregnancy test (which is performed at the site) is negative, dosing may begin or continue.  If 
the urine pregnancy test is positive, dosing should be withheld and a serum pregn ancy test performed.  
Pregnant subjects must discontinue from the study.
Follicle -Stimulating Hormone
Follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) should be tested at Screening if the female subject is ≤ 55 years of 
age AND has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND has no history of permanent surgical sterilization.
Hepatitis B and C Testing
All subjects will be tested for the presence of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) at 
Screening ( Figure 1).  Subjects with hepatitis B (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBs Ag] positive [+] or 
detected sensitivity on the HBV DNA polymerase chain reaction [PCR] qualitative test) or hepatitis C 
(HCV RNA detectable in any subject with anti- HCV antibodies) will be excluded.  Subjects who have been 
Page [ADDRESS_90151] hepatitis B and are HBs Ab positive may be enrolled.  If HBs Ag is negative but 
Hepatitis B core antibodies (HBc Ab) total is positive, HBV DNA will be quantified.  If HBV DN A level is 
undetectable at Screening, the subject can participate in this trial.  
Where mandated by [CONTACT_5277], subjects with HBs Ab+ and/or HBc Ab+ and negative HBV DNA 
at screening should have HBV DNA PCR testing performed every 12 weeks (q12w).   HBV DNA PCR testing 
q12w is not necessary when the subject has a history of HBV vaccine and is HBs Ab+ and HBc Ab –.
Per regional requirements:  for subjects with HBs Ab (+) and/or HBc Ab (+) at Screening, the HBV DNA 
PCR test should be performed as outli ned in the Operation Manual Section 2.1.  In cases where the 
recurrence of HBV -DNA is observed, the subject should be discontinued from the study drug .  Retesting 
is not necessary for subjects that have a history of HBV vaccine and are HBs Ab (+).
If HCV antibodies are positive, HCV RNA will be quantified.  If HCV RNA level is undetectable at 
Screening, the subject can participate in this trial.

* A positive test result for HBs Ab is expected for subjects who have had a HBV vaccination.  For subjects without a history of
HBV vaccination (and where mandated by [CONTACT_5277]), a positive result fo r HBs Ab requires HBV DNA PCR testing.
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Testing
Human immunodeficiency virus testing will be performed at Screening.  The Investigator must discuss 
any local reporting requirements to local health agencies with the subjec t.  The site will report 
confirmed positive results to their health agency per local regulations, if necessary.  If a subject has a 
confirmed positive result, the Investigator must discuss with the subject the potential implications to the 
subject's health and subject should receive or be referred for clinical care promptly.  A subject will not 
be eligible for study participation if test results indicate a positive HIV infection.  [COMPANY_013] will not receive 
results from the testing and will not be made aware o f any positive result.  In case a screened subject

QuantiFERON -TB Gold Test [or IGRA equivalent] and the [COMPANY_003] Skin Test are required per local 
guidelines, the [COMPANY_003] Skin Test will be performed according to standard clinical prac tice.
The [COMPANY_003] Skin Test should be read by a licensed healthcare professional between [ADDRESS_90154].
The reaction will be measured in millimeters (mm) of induration and induration ≥ 5 mm is 
considered a positive reaction.  The absence of induration will be recorded as "0 mm," not 
"negative."
If subject had a positive QuantiFERON- TB Gold (or IGRA equivalent) or [COMPANY_003] test at Screening, the 
test should not be repeated.  Subjects who have had an ulcerating reaction to the TB Skin Test in 
the past should not be re -exposed and should not be tested by a [COMPANY_003] skin test.
If the TB screening test (either [COMPANY_003] or the QuantiFERON -TB Gold test [or IGRA equivalent]) is 
positive, or if there is a repeat indeterminate QuantiFERON -TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent) 
upon retesting, subjects may participate in the study if further work -up(according to local
practice/guidelines) establishes conclusively that the patient has no evidence of active TB.  If the 
presence of latent TB is established, subjects are not required to be treated with prophylactic 
anti- TB therapy prior to or during the study, if the subje ct is considered low risk (i.e., no risk 
factors identified using the TB risk assessment questionnaire or defined by [CONTACT_82673]) for reactivation.
If the subject is diagnosed with active TB , the subject should not be randomized in the study and 
should not receive study drug.  Subject will be considered as a screening failure .
If the subject is diagnosed with active TB after being randomized, the subject should not receive 
any further study d rug and follow the Premature Discontinuation Visit procedure.
If TB (latent or active) is diagnosed during the study, it is also necessary to report it as an AE in the 
source documents and eCRFs.  In the case of a TB -related AE, a TB supplemental form tha t provides 
additional information will be completed by [CONTACT_1719].

Clinical criteria for diagnosing anaphylaxis are provided in Appendix 8.7.  Blood tests to be conducted in 
the event of a suspected anaphylactic reaction are:
Serum tryptase:  15 minutes to 3 hours of symptom onset, and no later than 6 hours (as tryptase
may remain elevated for 6 or more hours after the onset and therefore may still be informative 
if obtained after 3 hours); 
a follow -up tryptase level should be collected a minimum of 2 weeks after the recorded 
event or at the next study visit.
Plasma his tamine:  5 to 15 minutes of symptom onset, and no later than 1 hour.
Subjects will be closely monitored on site during study drug administration at Baseline (Week 0), 
Week 4, Week 16, Week 28, and Week 40.  A medical person qualified in the treatment of a cute 
hypersensitivity reactions must be present during the injections.  The duration of the post -dose safety 
surveillance is for [ADDRESS_90155] laboratory work done at a local lab, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or other facility.  Local lab results should 
be obtained along with reference ranges and kept with the subjects' source documentation.  Local lab 
results should be reviewed by [CONTACT_82674].
If laboratory samples cannot be obtained, study drug administration may be continued provided the 
investigator has reviewed all prior laboratory results and confirms and discusses with the subject that 
there is no safety concern for the subject to continue use of the study drug in the absence of current 
labs.  The subject should be scheduled for laboratory draws as soon as feasible.

The PASI is an established measure of clinical efficacy for psoriasis medications.1
The PASI is a tool that provides a numeric scoring for subjects overall psoriasis disease state, ranging 
from 0 to 72.  It is a linear combination of percent of sur face area of skin that is affected and the severity 
of erythema, induration, and desquamation over four body regions.
The endpoints used are based on the percent reduction from baseline, generally summarized as a 
dichotomous outcome based on achieving over an X% reduction (or PASI X), where X is 50, 75, 90 and 
100.
To calculate the PASI, the four main body areas are assessed:  head (h), trunk (t), upper extremities (u) 
and lower extremities (l) .  These correspond to 10, 30, 20 and 40% of the total body area respectively.
The area affected by [CONTACT_82679] a percentage of the total area 
of that anatomic site and assigned a numerical value according to the degree of psoriatic involvement as 
follows:
0 = no involvement
1= < 10%
2 = 10% to < 30%
3 = 30% to < 50%
4 = 50% to < 70%
5 = 70% to < 90%
6 = 90% to 100%
The signs of severity, erythema (E), induration (I) and desquamation (D) of lesions are assessed using a 
numeric scale 0 –[ADDRESS_90161] possible 
involvement; scores are made independently for each of the areas, h, t, u and l and represents a 
composite score for each area.  The signs of severity, erythema (E), induration (I) and desquamation (D)
of lesio ns are assessed using a numeric scale 0 to 4:
0 = No symptoms
1 = Slight
2 = Moderate
3 = Marked
4 = Very marked

OPERATIONS MANUAL FOR CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL M19 -164 Version 2.0
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Assignments for the following body regions are as follows:
Neck:  include with the head
Buttocks:  include with the lower extremities
Axillae:  include with the trunk
Genitals:  include with the trunk
The inguinal canal separates the trunk and legs anteriorly
The PASI for each body region is obtained by [CONTACT_82680], then multiplying the r esult by [CONTACT_82681].  Since 
the head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities correspond to approximately 10%, 20%, 30%, 
and 40% of BSA, respectively, the PASI is calculated according to the following f ormula:
PASI = 0.1(E h+ Ih+ D h)Ah+ 0.3(E t+ It+ D t)At+ 0.2(E u+ Iu+ D u)Au+ 0.4(E l+ Il+ D l)Al
where E, I, D, and A denote erythema, induration, desquamation, and area, respectively, and h, u, t, and 
ldenote head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities, respectively.  PASI ranges from 0.[ADDRESS_90162] degree.
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_82631] 3 or less represent mild disease, scores over 3 and up and including 15 represent 
moderate disease and scores over 15 are considered to be associated with severe disease.

This Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) is a 5 -point score ranging from 0 to 4, based on the 
physician's assessment of the average thickness, erythema, and scaling of all psoriatic lesions.
The assessment is considered "static" which refers to the patient's disease state at the time of the 
assessments, without comparison to any of the patient's previous disease states, whether at Baseline or 
at a previous visit.
A lower score indicates less body coverage, with [ADDRESS_90163] clear.  The efficacy 
assessor scores the erythema, induration and scaling of all psoriatic lesions from 0 –4 based on the 
following descriptors:
Erythema
0    Normal (post -inflammatory hyper/hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_22765])
1    Faint, diffuse pi[INVESTIGATOR_82637]
2    Mild (light red coloration)
3    Definite red coloration (Dull to bright red)
4    Bright to Deep red coloration of lesions
Induration (Plaque Elevation)
[ADDRESS_90164] detectable (possible slight elevation above normal skin)
2    Mild thickening (slight but definite elevation, typi[INVESTIGATOR_82638])
3    Clearly distinguishable to moderate thickening (marked definite elevation with rough or sloped 
edges)
[ADDRESS_90165] edges (marked elevation typi[INVESTIGATOR_82639])
Scaling
0    No scaling
1    Minimal focal scaling (surface dryness with some desquamation)
2    Predominately fine scaling (fine scale partially or mostly covering lesions)
3    Moderate scaling (coarser scale covering most or all of the lesions)
4    Severe/coarse scaling covering almost all or all lesions (coarse, nontenacious scale 
predominates)

Anaphylaxi s3is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria is fulfilled:
1.Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, 
or both (e.g., generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips -tongue -uvula)
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING
a.Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, 
hypoxemia)
b.Reduced blood pressure (BP) or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction 
(e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)
2.Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely allergen for that 
patient (minutes to several hours):
a.Involvement of the skin -mucosal tissue (e.g., generalized hives, itch -flush, swol len lips -
tongue -uvula)
b.Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, 
hypoxemia)
c.Reduced BP or associated symptoms (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)
d.Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., c rampy abdominal pain, vomiting)
3.Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours):
a.Infants and children:  low systolic BP (age specific) or greater than 30% decrease in systolic 
BP*
b.Adults:  systolic BP of less t han 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that person's 
baseline.
PEF = peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229]; BP = blood pressure
* Low systolic BP for children is defined as less than 70 mm Hg from 1 month to 1 year, less than (70 mm Hg + [2 × age]) 
from 1 to 10 yea rs, and less than 90 mg Hg from 11 to 17 years.
Serious Systemic Hypersensitivity Reaction:   A hypersensitivity reaction is a clinical sign or symptom, or 
constellation of signs or symptoms, caused by [CONTACT_82683].  A systemic hypersensitivity reaction is a hypersensitivity reaction that does 
not occur at the local site of study drug administration (e.g., not an injection site reaction).  A serious 
systemic hypersensitivity reaction is a systemic hypersensitivity reaction that fulfills criteria for a serious 
adverse event.
In the event of an anaphylactic reaction, blood samples will be drawn per Section 3.12 after the onset of 
the reaction.  This will include:  histamine and tryptase.  Separate instructions for the collection, 
handling, storage and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_82640].

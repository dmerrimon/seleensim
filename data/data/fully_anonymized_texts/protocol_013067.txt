 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
 Background and Rationale Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, autoimmune disease that causes inflammation and destruction of the brain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831].  This condition is the leading cause of non- traumatic 
disability among young adults, and affects nearly half a million Americans and 2.[ADDRESS_623015] 42-70% of MS patients, and constitute a major cause of loss of employment, caregiver stress, and reduced quality of life.
1-[ADDRESS_623016] is hindered by a poor understanding of factors that influence its severity, or common medical comorbidities that may increase patients’ vulnerability to its effects.   
 Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder characterized by [CONTACT_484787][INVESTIGATOR_484775]. Growing evidence suggests that nocturnal hypoxia caused by [CONTACT_484788],
6-[ADDRESS_623017] pressure (PAP) therapy may improve cognitive dysfunction in individuals who do not have MS.
11, [ADDRESS_623018] one fifth of MS patients  carry a diagnosis of OSA, while a 
substantially higher proportion of patients (more than half) may have undiagnosed OSA.  Furthermore, new data from our group suggest that OSA severity is closely related to reductions in cognitive performance in MS subjec ts.
[ADDRESS_623019], identification and treatment of OSA could provide new opportunities improve cognition in persons with MS.    Objectives , Aims,  and Endpoints  
The objectives of this randomized, rater- blinded clinical trial are to 1) determine the effects of 
OSA on specific domains of cognitive function in patients with MS; and 2) assess the effects of OSA treatment with positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy on cognitive dysfunction in MS patients.  
 For Aim 1, subjects with MS (n~175) who screen positive on a commonly used screening tool for OSA (STOP -Bang questionnaire)
[ADDRESS_623020] nocturnal 
polysomnography (PSG). For s ubjects who have a recent diagnosis of OSA based on recent 
(within 1 year) in -lab clinical University of Michigan Sleep Laboratory PSG who have not yet 
started using PAP treatment  compliantly , their  in-lab clinical PSG data will be used for baseline 
Page 6 of 30 
 analyses .  After adjustment for clinical confounds and other PSG outcomes, we will assess the 
extent to which apnea severity as reflected by [CONTACT_484789].    For Aim 2, subjects who meet criteria for OSA on baseline PSG or recent U -M Sleep Lab  in-lab 
clinical PSG (n ~140) will be randomized into one of 2 groups: expedited positive airway 
pressure ( PAP) therapy, followed by [CONTACT_484790] [ADDRESS_623021]-PAP (Group 1, 
n~93), or standard care PAP therapy which will commence following completion of month 3 testing (Group 2, n~47).  Mean changes from baseline in cognitive test scores will be compared between groups.    Assessments The aims of this study are to assess the relationship between sleep apnea severity and cognitive dysfunction in MS patients with OSA (Aim 1), and to examine the effects of positive airway pressure (PAP) on cognitive function in MS patients with OSA (Aim 2).    N~175 patients who screen positive for high OSA risk on a validated screening questionnaire (STOP -Bang), or who already carry a diagnosis of OSA but are not yet using PAP on a 
compliant basis  will be invited to participate.   
 Consenting subjects with  STOP -Bang scores positive for >=[ADDRESS_623022] a University of Michigan Sleep Laboratory 
PSG will undergo baseline (month 0) in -lab PSG and baseline neuropsychological (cognitive) 
testin g.  Subjects who have a recent diagnosis of OSA based on recent (within 1 year) in -lab 
clinical University of Michigan Sleep Laboratory PSG who have not yet started using PAP treatment  compliantly will undergo baseline cognitive testing and their in -lab clinical PSG data 
will be used for baseline analyses.  Subjects who have a diagnosis of OSA based on non- UM in -
lab PSG or PSG > 1 year prior to screening will undergo new  baseline PSG and baseline 
cognitive testing.  Subjects who meet criteria for OSA on baseline or clinical PSG (n ~140, anticipated) will then be 
randomized into one of 2 groups (2:1 randomization): immediate treatment with PAP (Group 1, n~93) followed by [CONTACT_484791] [ADDRESS_623023]- PAP; or standard of care 
application of PAP at 3 months, after completion of repeat neuropsychological testing (Group 2, n~47).  Analyses will focus on relationships between standard PSG measures (including the Respi[INVESTIGATOR_72210], oxygen desaturation index, and minimum oxygen saturation), innovative new quantitative PSG measures and cognitive test scores, as well as mean changes 
from baseline in individual and composite cognitive test scores following treatment with PAP therapy.  Statistical Methods  Analyses will focus on relationships between standard PSG measures (Respi[INVESTIGATOR_72210], oxygen desaturation index, and minimum oxygen saturation), innovative new quantitative PSG measures and cognitive test scores, as well as mean changes from baseline in individua l 
cognitive scores following treatment with PAP therapy.

test scores and other covariates.  We will also examine the association of PAP use as a continuous variable, based on mean nightly hours of use per month, on 3-month individual cognitive test scores, controlling for baseline scores.

 1. INTRODUCTION 
 1.1 Indication 
The proposed study will assess the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea severity and 
cognitive dysfunction in MS patients with OSA (Aim 1), and examine the effects of positive airway pressure (PAP) on cognitive function in MS patients with OSA (Aim 2) . 
 1.[ADDRESS_623025] common and disabling consequences of multiple sclerosis .    
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, autoimmune disease that causes inflammation and destruction of the brain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831].  In addition to physical disability, MS patients suffer disproportionately from a variety of complications that negatively impact quality of life, including cognitive dysfunction.  Cognitive dysfunction is one of the most consequential symptoms of MS, spanning multiple domains of function including processing speed, working memory, learning, executive function, visual-spatial processing, and language function.  It is experienced by 42-70% of MS patients and is a major cause of loss of employment, caregiver stress, and reduced quality of life.
1-[ADDRESS_623026] more difficulty carrying out some activities of daily living. Even individuals with MS who are not considered to be “cognitively impaired” per se, and those whose functioning may remain in the normal range, may experience mild to moderate declines in cognitive functioning which could contribute to distress and functional impairments.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_484776], there are no definitive treatments for cognitive dysfunction in MS.  While cognitive rehabilitation in MS may help to enhance information processing and general level of function, this approach is still considered relatively new, and its utility remains under investigation.  Adjunctive treatments aimed at improving cognitive functioning are sorely needed.   Furthermore, the identification of appropriate strategies to prevent and remediate cognitive dysfunction in MS is hindered by a poor understanding of clinical features that may influence its severity, or comorbidities that may increase patients’ vulnerability to its effects.  Further efforts are needed to identify and address clinical factors that could cause or exacerbate cognitive dysfunction in MS, and to identify patients who are most vulnerable to these effects . 
 Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and consequential medical disorder that causes cognitive dysfunction in the general population.    
Obstructive sleep apnea (OS A) is a common disorder of sleep and breathing.  The condition is 
characterized by [CONTACT_484787][INVESTIGATOR_484777], hypoxia, and arousal during sleep.  This growing epi[INVESTIGATOR_484778] 10 -20% of Americans, and is a well-
recognized  risk factor for many serious health consequences including hypertension, stroke, 
heart disease, and diabetes.
15, [ADDRESS_623027] Pr essure (PAP), which is delivered by a 
mechanical device and mask interface, splints the upper airway open during sleep and effectively 
Page 9 of 30 
 ameliorates many of the symptoms caused by [CONTACT_24086].  This air pressure can be continuous 
(CPAP), bi -level (BiPAP), or auto- adjusting (AutoPAP). 
 Obstructive sleep apnea is also an established cause of cognitive dysfunction in the general population.
6-9, 11, 12 10 Sustained intermittent hypoxia that arises f rom OSA in non- MS patients 
has been linked to myelin and axonal injury, gray matter atrophy, as well as impaired executive function, long-term visual and verbal memory, visuospatial/constructional abilities, and attention.
11, 19, 20 21, 22  Furthermore, treatment of OSA with PAP therapy has been shown to 
improve executive dysfunction, delayed long-term verbal and visual memory, attention/vigilance, global cognitive functioning, and gray matter volume in OSA patients without MS, but the effect of OSA and its treatment with PAP therapy has not been studied in the context of comorbid MS.  Clinical Rationale  
Whereas the detrimental effects of OSA on cognition are well- established in the general 
population, the relationship between OSA and cognition has been virtually unstudied in patients with MS - a population that is particularly vulnerable to myelin and axonal damage by [CONTACT_484792].  This is a clinically relevant intersection, as MS is associated with a disproportionately high prevalence of OSA: new data from a recent study at our clinics show that at least 20% of MS patients suffer from clinically definite OSA, and up to 56% are at risk for OSA based on a validated screening tool (STOP-Bang).
23, [ADDRESS_623028] affected in patients with MS, while controlling for other sleep - and MS- related variables that may influence these relationships.  
 Hypotheses 
Hypothesis 1: Sleep apnea severity, as reflected by [CONTACT_484793] [respi[INVESTIGATOR_50139] (RDI), oxygen desaturation index (ODI), and minimum oxygen saturation (Min O2)], as well as innovative new quantitative approaches, will be associated with reduced MACFIMS scores.  
 Hypothesis 2: Group 1, in comparison to Group 2, will show greater improvement from baseline in MACFIMS scores, on repeat MACFIMS testing at month 3.  1.3 Safety  
 Risks  
This study presents minimal potential risks to participants. There are no alternatives to these data collection procedures. Participants may choose to not participate in any part of this voluntary study. Potential risks include: Discomfort during completio n of study questionnaires or 
Page 10 of 30 
 cognitive testing, and/or discomfort related to sleep studies or wearing PSG equipment. The 
study team will take all reasonable steps to minimize these risks.  
 Study Questionnaires: The questionnaire battery, which requires the participants to reflect upon 
and report on their physical and emotional symptoms may cause mild emotional distress. Baseline and follow up questionnaires are expected to take approximately 30 minutes on average; during this time , participants may experien ce physical pain, fatigue, or boredom. 
Participants will have the option to take breaks and may elect to complete the questionnaires on another day if they are too tired or distressed. In addition, the names and contact [CONTACT_484794] b e noted on the consent form and participants can contact [CONTACT_484795]. 
 Cognitive Testing: Cognitive testing is expected to take the average participant approximately 90 
minutes to complete. During that time, it is possible that the participant may exper ience 
discomfort in the form of fatigue, physical pain, or boredom. In addition, if the participant perceives that they are not performing well, they may feel frustrated or emotionally distressed. The examiner who administers the cognitive tests will monitor the participant for signs of discomfort and distress and, as needed, will offer breaks and/or encouragement in the form of normalizing any emotional distress. In the event that a participant becomes extremely physically or emotionally uncomfortable, he or she may elect to discontinue testing or continue the remainder of the testing on another day.  In-
laboratory overnight Polysomnography (sleep study) and Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) 
titration:  The baseline sleep study (PSG)  should not be painful and generally has few 
complications. Sensors or electrodes are placed on the scalp, face, chest, limbs, and a finger.  The equipment records brain activity, eye movements, chin muscle activity, heart rate and rhythm, blood pressure, and the amount of oxygen in your blood.  Elastic belts are placed around the chest and belly to measure chest movements and the strength and duration of inhaled and exhaled breaths. Additional sensors will measure airflow at the nose and mouth.  Wires attached to the sen sors transmit the data to a computer in the next room. The wires are very thin and 
flexible. They are bundled together so they don't restrict movement, disrupt sleep, or cause other discomfort. The most common side effect is mild irritation where electrode s come in contact 
[CONTACT_8124]. It may also be stressful to sleep away from the comfort of the subject’s  normal 
sleep environment. Subjects may sleep poorly in the lab, and as a result feel sleepy on the day after the study . For this reason, subjects are encouraged to ask someone to drive them to the 
sleep laboratory and take them home on the next morning.  Skin integrity is checked by [CONTACT_484796].  If subjects have a skin reaction at the site of a sensor used to monitor sleep or heart rate, th e technologist will move it to another site and use a different type of tape or glue. If 
subject’s skin should become irritated at multiple sites or in any severe manner, the study will be stopped. Any skin irritation at sites where sensors were placed is expected to resolve after the study on its own, usually in hours or at most a day or two.   U
nless already performed for clinical purposes at U-M Sleep lab within the past year, 
participants who are diagnosed with OSA on baseline PSG will then undergo PAP titrations * to 
determine the ideal PAP machine setting (s), and participants will be prescribed clinical C PAP or 
BiPAP machines  by [CONTACT_484797] .   
 
Page [ADDRESS_623029] clinical care for OSA.  It involves wearing an apparatus that 
includes a hose and a mask (that covers the nose, or nose and mouth), connected to a small machine that blows air into the airway during sleep. The degree of air pressure given depends on the subject’s apnea severity, and the supplied air pressure can be continuous or change with the subject’s  breathing pattern.  This in -laboratory PAP titration sleep test uses the same sensors and 
has the same complications as t he baseline sleep study, but the subject will also w ear a mask 
attached to a PAP machine during sleep for this test, so that the sleep technicians can determine 
which type of mask and airway press ure are most appropriate . Masks can be uncomfortable and 
create a feeling of claustrophobia.  Air pressure may d ry out nasal passages. Subjects will be 
encouraged to  alert the staff in the sleep laboratory to any other concerns, discomfort, or 
comp lications that arise during the  PSG or  PAP titration. A doctor will always be on call for any 
unexpected health emergencies.  
 *In some cases, insurance carriers will not cover the cost of an in -laboratory PAP titration, and 
instead will recommend an “auto-adjusting” PAP machine (also known as AutoPAP , or APAP ) 
so that patients  diagnosed with OSA may begin PAP without requiring a PAP titration.  
AutoPAP differs fro m a CPAP in that it uses  algorithms to sense subtle changes in the user's 
breathing and deliver only the amount of pressure necessary to keep the airway open.  AutoPAP can be also set to  a straight CPAP mode , if determined necessary by [CONTACT_484798], therefore 
offering more flexibility than a CPAP or BiPAP machine.  In cases where AutoPAP is recommended by [CONTACT_2299]’s insurance carrier and no medical or PSG  contraindications to 
AutoPAP exist, participants will be allowed to waive their in -lab PAP titration and start 
AutoPAP therapy according to their PAP randomization assignment.  PAP Therapy : 
  There may be skin irritation related to the  PAP mask, and masks can be 
uncomfortable and create a feeling of claustrophobia. There are multiple choices and sizes for sleep masks, and the provider will work with the subjects to find the most comfortable mask. There may be difficulty tolerating the forced air, but the pressure settings can be adjusted by [CONTACT_484799]. Subjects might experience a dry stuffy nose which can be treated with a saline nasal spray  or humidified air that can be run through the PAP machine. 
The providers o f these machines are very familiar with resolutions to and they will try and assist 
subjects in order to resolve any issues.  Confidentiality:  The records of this study will remain confidential and protected; however, there 
is a risk for a breach of confidentiality. This risk is minimal, because a number of precautions have been taken  in order to protect confidentiality. All data collected  will be kept secure and in a 
locked offic e. Records will be coded and identifying information (such as name [CONTACT_484823]) will be removed and stored on a key in a separate location so that confidential information cannot be traced back to the subject. Only authorized members of the research team will have access to study records.  Standard care PAP  
 treatment arm (for Group 2 ):  Given that most consequences of OSA take 
months to years to manifest (cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome), we do not anticipate any significant long- term side effects from deferri ng PAP for 3 months for Group 2.  
Identification of sleep disordered breathing will be facilitated by [CONTACT_107890]. Nonetheless, to avoid hazardous short- term consequences of OSA caused by [CONTACT_484800] 12 of 30 
 sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (e.g., motor vehicle accidents), ESS scores >= 16 on baseline or follow- up visits will 
be cause for study exclusion/discontinuation.  This cutoff was chosen based on data that 
demonstrate an ordinal increase in risk of sleepy driving accidents with increases in ESS score, particularly in subjects with ESS scores > 15.  We will also consider extreme OSA (RDI>60 respi[INVESTIGATOR_484779], or unstable ECG rhythms on PSG) to be exclusionary, regardless of ESS score. For subjects who are not considered to be high risk per these criteria, we do not expect the risk of participating in this trial and having no CPAP for 3 months to exceed the risk encountered in routine clinical practice, as wait times for sleep clinic evaluations, subsequent sleep clinic referral, PSG, CPAP titration, and CPAP initiation at home currently ofte n amount to 
3 months or longer at U- M sleep clinics.  
  Alternative treatments and procedures:  This study does not include an intervention. Therefore, there are no applicable alternative treatments or procedures.  
 As with any research study, there may be additional risks that are unforeseeable.     2.  STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
 2.1 Objectives  
The objectives of this randomized, rater- blinded clinical trial are to 1) determine the effects of 
OSA on specific domains of cognitive function in patients with MS; and 2) assess the effects of OSA treatment with positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy on cognitive dysfunction in MS patients.

(PROMIS , www.nihpromis.org/ ), in group 1 vs group 2. 
 
3.  STUDY DESIGN  
N~175 patients who screen positive for high OSA risk on a validated screening questionnaire (STOP -Bang) given during routine MS Clinic appointments at the University of Michigan will 
be invited to participate. Additional subjects may be recruited from the community through a U-M electronic clinical trials registry  (UMclinicalstudies.org); a clinicaltrials .gov posting; print or 
electronic newspaper advertisement; fliers at the medical center and in the community; and from study advertisements posted by [CONTACT_484803].  Potential subjects who contact [CONTACT_412205], or are referred by [CONTACT_484804], and have not completed a STOP -Bang questionnaire, will be asked the STOP -Bang questions via telephone 
during a pre-screening interview.  If their STOP -Bang assessment indicates a risk for sleep apnea 
(score >=2 risk factors for sleep apnea) , they will be invited to participate.  If their STOP -Bang 
score is below a 2, they will not be eligible for the study.    Subjects who endorse a pre-existing diagnosis of OSA who are not yet using PAP therapy on a compliant basis - but who express an interest to start using it - will also be invited to participate.  
 Consenting subjects with elevated STOP -Bang scores or those who are at high risk for OSA will 
undergo baseline (month 0) PSG and baseline neuropsychological testing (MACFIMS) ( see 
figure ).  Subjects who already have recent U -M in -lab PSG  (within 1 year) indicating O SA will 
also undergo baseline cognitive testing, and their in -lab clinical PSG data will be used for 
baseline analyses.  Subjects who have a diagnosis of OSA based on non- UM lab PSG or PSG > 1 
year prior to screening will undergo baseline PSG and baseline cognitive testing.  Subjects who meet criteria for OSA on baseline  or clinical  in-lab PSG (n ~140, anticipated) 
will then be randomized into one of two  groups (2:1 randomization): immediate treatment 
with PAP (Group 1, n~93) followed by [CONTACT_484791] [ADDRESS_623031]-PAP; or standard of care application of PAP at [ADDRESS_623032]-randomization, after completion of repeat neuropsychological testing (Group 2, n~47) .  Analyses will focus on 
relationships between standard PSG measures (Respi[INVESTIGATOR_72210], oxygen desaturation index, and minimum oxygen saturation), innovative new quantitative PSG measures and MACFIMS scores, as well as mean changes from baseline in individual and composite MACFIMS scores following treatment with PAP therapy.

  5.  STUDY TREATMENTS  
 5.1 Allocation to Treatment (see also 6.4) Randomization Process: Subjects who meet all I nclusion/E xclusion criteria , including OSA on 
baseline or clinical PSG , will be randomized (2:1 randomization) to expedited PAP therapy 
(Group 1, n~93), or standard care PAP therapy (Group 2, n~47), after the subject has signed consent, completed the baseline activities,  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_484807] y (RDI < or >=30) to minimize imbalances in apnea severity between groups.  
 5.[ADDRESS_623035] Pressure (PAP) Therapy : Unless already performed at 
U-M sleep lab within the past year, all subjects who are diagnosed with OSA on baseline or clinical  PSG  (n~140) will undergo PAP titrations * and be prescribed  clinical PAP therapy by 
[CONTACT_484808]’s treating sleep provider.  PAP therapy is considered standard clinical care for patients with obstructive sleep apnea. PAP is a mode of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_484782] (or nose and mouth) to splint the upper airway open during sleep. PAP therapy can be delivered at a continuous pressure (CPAP), at different levels during inspi[INVESTIGATOR_32715] (BiPAP), or at a range of auto- adjustable levels 
depending on the patient’s breathing (AutoPAP)*.  In order to determine which pressure setting 
most effectively treats an individual’s sleep apnea, an overnight PAP titration study is typi[INVESTIGATOR_80454].  This study is similar to a PSG in terms of overnight monitoring but also involves fitting of various masks which are then hooked up to the subject and PAP machine to test the effectiveness of various PAP setting s, and to determine which mask/setting  is most tolerable for 
the subject.  PAP titration s tudies will be scored by [CONTACT_484809] a board- certified sleep physician, who will th en place an order for PAP equipment at 
appropriate settings with a local durable medical equipment (DME) provider. DME will be covered by [CONTACT_423] ’s insurance.   
Page 17 of 30 
  
* In some cases, insurance carriers will not cover the cost of an in-laboratory PAP titration, and instead will recommend an “auto -adjusting” PAP machine (also known as AutoPAP, or APAP) 
so that patients diagnosed with OSA may begin PAP without requiring a PAP titration.  AutoPAP differs from a CPAP in that it uses algorithms to sense subtle changes in the user's breathing and deliver only the amount of pressure necessary to keep the airway open.  In cases where AutoPAP is recommended by [CONTACT_2299]’s insurance carrier and no medical or PSG contraindications to AutoPAP exist, participants will be allowed to waive their in -lab PAP 
titratio n and start AutoPAP therapy according to their PAP randomization assignment. 
 6.  STUDY PROCEDURES  
 6.1 Screening /Baseline  Visit  
Subjects will be seen at  one of several University of Michigan clinical or research study sites for 
baseline visit activities , including but not limited to the Michigan Clinical Research Unit 
(MCRU), or the Department of Neuropsychology testing suite in the Med-Inn Building.  Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria will be reviewed, and informed consent will be obtained by 
[CONTACT_114007].  Consenting subjects who meet el igibility criteria at screening  will be 
enrolled and receive their baseline evaluation, where they will undergo the following assessments:  
 1)  Demographic information 
2)  Focused m edical and surgical history as it relates to multiple sclerosis,  sleep , and 
cardiopulmonary history 3)  Medication review  
4)  Assessments of height, weight, and neck circumference  
5)  Expanded Disability Status Scale self -report questionnaire  
(a self -reported measure of MS -related disability)   
6)  Pregnancy test (for females of childbearing age) 
(if a pregnancy test was performed within the past month, that result may be 
used and the test does not need to be repeated)  
7)  Fatigue, insomnia, and sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_124884] (see 7.2 ) 
8)  Pain , anxiety, and qua lity of life assessments (see 7.2 )  
9) Baseline neu ropsychological testing (see 6.2)*  
10) Unless already done clinically at U -M sleep lab within the past year, baseline 
polysomnography (PSG, see 6.3) 
  *If subjects are unable to complete baseline neuropsychological testing on the day of their baseline visit, this will be scheduled within 3 weeks of screening/basel ine visit.  
 6.2 Cognitive (Neuropsychological) Testing  
The Minimal Assessment of Cognitive Function in MS (MACFIMS)
26, 27 is a validated, 90-
minute neuropsychological battery comprised of a collection of standardized cognitive tests 
Page 18 of 30 
 which assess 5 main cognitive domains that ar e commonly affected in MS: processing 
speed/working memory, learning, executive function, visual-spatial processing, and language 
function, using [ADDRESS_623036] measures.  Endorsed by [CONTACT_484810] (CMSC), it is one of the mo st accepted neuropsychological batteries in the field.  All 
MACFIMS testing will be performed by [CONTACT_11136], trained psychometricians who are part of the 
pool of technicians in the department of Psychiatry at the University of Michigan. All psychometricians are directly supervised by [CONTACT_484811].D.-level neuropsychologist in Psychiatry ; furthermore, [CONTACT_484825], a clinical psychologist who is a co -investigator on this 
project will oversee all neuropsychological data collection and extraction.  Components of the MACFIMS , include in this study are as follows:  
Symbol D ig
it M odalities T est (SDMT) : Consists of a series of [ADDRESS_623037] (PASAT): Patients listen to a series of audiotaped digits 
and must add each consecutive digit to the one immediately preceding it.  Digits presented at 
two different rates (every 2 seconds or 3 seconds).  Scores reflect the total number of correct responses at each presentation rate (PASAT -2 or PASAT -3). Two alternate forms, Form A 
and F orm B , will used in this study.   
[LOCATION_004] Verbal Learning Test  
 (CVLT -II): Subjects learn a [ADDRESS_623038] (list A), the recall 
of which is examined over a course of [ADDRESS_623039] (interference list, List B), after which time the original list is reassessed after a [ADDRESS_623040] – R evised (BVMT -R): Assesses spatial learning and 
memory using a matrix of simple abstract de signs presented in three trials (10 seconds each). 
Subje cts are asked to recall (immediate and after a delay) and recognize the designs from 
distractor designs.  Form [ADDRESS_623041] (JLO) :  Measure of visual -spatial abilities.  Subjects are 
required to identify the angle defined by [ADDRESS_623042] (COWAT): Measure of phonemic fluency, in which subjects 
are as ked to name [CONTACT_484824] h [ADDRESS_623043] total number of words generated across all 3 trials. T wo 
alternate versions ( CFL/PRW ) of the COWAT will be used .  
 
Nine - hole Peg Test  (NHPT): Using a standard NHPT board, subjects place plastic pegs into [ADDRESS_623044] is scored as 
Page 19 of 30 
 the time (seconds) it take s the subject to complete the task. Two trials on both dominate and 
non-dominate hands are completed.  
 
Trail Making Test (Part  A and B): Both parts of the Trail Making Test consist of 25 circles 
distributed over a sheet of paper. In Part A, the circles are numbered 1 – 25, and the patient 
should draw lines to connect the numbers in ascending order. In Part B, the circles include both numbers (1 – 13) and letters (A – L); as in  Part A, the patient draws lines to connect the 
circles in an ascending pattern, but with the added task of alternating between the numbe rs 
and letters (i.e., 1-A-2-B-3-C, etc.). The patient should be instructed to connect the circles as quickly as possible, without lifting the pen or pencil from the paper. Time the patient as he or she connects the "trail." Results for both TMT A and B are reported as the number of seconds required to complete the task; therefore, higher s cores reveal greater impairment . 
 
The North American Adult Reading Test ( NAART ) - 35: The NAART is a widely used to 
estimate verbal intellectual ability/verbal intelligenc e.  The test consists of a list of [ADDRESS_623045], and their score is based on the number of correctly pronounced words (according to American and Canadian punctuation rules). Because scores on the NAART are thought to reflect basic aspects of crystalized intelligence and are not expected to change, this test will only be administered once – at baseline.  
 
Go/No -go test: The GNG task involves the presentation of letter stimuli one at a time every 
500 ms on the computer screen.  After a brief training session, participants are instructed to quickly press a button each time they see the target letters X, Y or Z: either 1) ea ch time the 
target letters are presented (go trials), or only when the target letters are presented in alternating non-repeating fashion (no- go trials). Reaction time and accuracy are recorded.  
 
T
wo fixed batteries of these tests (see table  2 below) will b e created. O rder of administration of 
Fixed Test Battery A and Fixed Test Battery B will be randomized across subjects.

6.3 Baseline PSG  visit * 
Page 20 of 30 
 Conventional In -lab Overnight Polysomnography (PSG):  Procedures and scoring will follow the 
latest American Academy of Sleep Medicine Scoring Rules.[ADDRESS_623047] measures will include: 
total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency, sleep latency (SL [minutes from lights out to first 30 
seconds of any sleep stage]), wake after sleep onset, total arousal index (TAI, average number of EEG arousals per hour of sleep), % total sleep time spent in stage 1, 2, 3, and REM sleep, the Respi[INVESTIGATOR_72210] (RDI - total number of apneas, hypopneas and respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]- related 
arousals per hour of sleep)central apnea index (total number of central apneas per hour of sleep), oxygen desaturation index (ODI, number of desaturation events >=3% below baseline oxygen saturation levels), minimum oxygen saturation (Min O2), and % of sleep time with O2 saturation ≤ 88%.  PSG’s will be scored by a single, experienced, technologist , masked to treatment group.  
Scoring will be reviewed and confirmed, and studies interpreted, by a board- certified sleep 
specialist.    Innovative PSG Signal Analysis Algorithms: In addition to conventional PSG measures, PSG data will also be analyzed usi ng a novel PSG algorithm that has never been applied to sleep or 
cognitive research in MS patients. This will involve no changes to the subject’s overnight PSG procedure or experience.  This novel method, invented and patented by [CONTACT_3252]-investigators Drs. Chervin and Burns,
29, 30 uses variations in EEG power (for specific frequency bands) during 
discrete phases of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_50126] (early expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], late expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], early inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and late inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) to detect subtle, cortical microarousals not visible on standard visual inspection of the PSG.28- [ADDRESS_623048] on cerebral cortical function among MS patients.  Specifically, respi[INVESTIGATOR_50126]- related EEG changes (RCREC), which reflect cortical 
microarousals, will be computed to detect subtle disturbances in respi[INVESTIGATOR_484783]/hypopnea measures, which will then be correlated with MACFIMS scores.  The study team has also pi[INVESTIGATOR_484784] – temporal patterns of sleep stages rather than simpler total sums or percentages of stage 1, 2, 3, and REM sleep – to discriminate between disordered and normal sleep when standard measures fail to do so.  These techniques also will be applied to sleep recordings, to identify additional sleep- related 
predictors of cognitive dysfunction beyond conventional measures of nocturnal respi[INVESTIGATOR_484785].  
 *For subjects who have a recent diagnosis of OSA based on recent (within 1 year) clinical University of Michigan Sleep Laboratory PSG, these clinical PSG data will be used for  the same 
baseline analyses  above.   
 6.4 Rand omization 
Randomization Process/Blinding: Subjects who meet criteria for OSA on baseline or clinical  
PSG (n~140, anticipated) will be randomized (2:1 randomization) to determine whether they will 
receive ex pedited PAP therapy (Group 1, n~93), or standard of care PAP therapy (Group 2, 
n~47).  Computer- based r andomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_484812] (RDI < or 
>=30) to minimize imbalances in apnea severity between groups. PSG technicians, PSG interpreters, and study staff who conduct and score neuropsychological tests will remain blinded to group allocation for the duration of the study. The subject, PI, co-investigators, coordinators, and statistician will not be blinded.   Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_484813] 21 of 30 
 assignment that determines whether they will be scheduled for immediate PAP titration 
(Group 1) or delayed PAP titration after their month 3 cognitive testing.   6.5 PAP titration  (After randomization for Group 1, and following month 3 cognitive testing for Group 2) 
Standard AASM guidelines will be followed in laboratory-based PAP titration studies designed to determine effective continuous PAP (CPAP) or bilevel PAP (BiPAP) settings, when necessary, for subjects with OSA.  Studies will be scored by [CONTACT_484814] a board- certified sleep physician . Clinicians involved in the study or the subject’s 
treating sleep provider will th en place an order for PAP equipment at appropriate settings with a 
local durable medical equipment (DME) provider. DME will be covered by [CONTACT_423] ’s 
insurance.  The DME company will provide subjects with equipment, instruct them on proper use at home, an d provide supplies as needed.  PAP titrations can be waived if subjects have had a 
recent U -M sleep lab clinical PAP titration within the past year.  In cases where AutoPAP is 
recommended by [CONTACT_2299]’s insurance carrier and no medical or PSG contraindications to AutoPAP exist, participants will be allowed to waive their in -lab PAP titration and start 
AutoPAP therapy according to their PAP randomization assignment. Adherence of PAP therapy will be monitored by [CONTACT_484815] t he PAP machines.

 7.  ASSESSMENTS  
 
7.1 Primary Endpoint Assessments 
Cognitive performance (primary outcome measure of interest) will be assessed with formal 
neuropsychological testing (see section 6.2).  Sleep apnea severity (primary predictor of int erest) 
will be assessed with overnight polysomnography (see se ction 6.3). 
 7.2 Exploratory 
Measures of sleep quality and sleep fragmentation, as well as Innovative PSG Signal Analysis 
Algorithms  (secondary predictors of cognitive performance ), will be assessed with overnight 
polysomnography (see section 6.3). 
 
Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (ESS):  The ESS is an [ADDRESS_623053] 
objective polysomnographic measures.  A score ≥10 suggests excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]. 
 
Krupp’s Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS): The FSS is a validated, [ADDRESS_623054]’s clinical improvement.  Many if not most past studies on MS- related fatigue 
have used the FSS.  
 
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) : The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) is a 7- item questionnaire with 
5-point Likert scale responses designed to assess the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia in adults. 
[ADDRESS_623055] moderate clinical insomnia.   
 
Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) /Quality of Life in 
Neurological Disorders (NeuroQol): The federally -funded Patient Reported Outcomes 
Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders 
(NeuroQoL) are two integrated system s of highly reliable and responsive as sessment tools that 
use modern measurement theory to assess patient -reported health related quality of life .  Using 
validated item banks and standardized metrics, PROMIS and NeuroQoL reliably measure 
patient -reported outcome measures (PROM’s) for clinical research.  PROMIS  and NeuroQoL  
measures, derived from large question banks, can be given as static short forms (t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 7-8 
items in length).  Measures can be used as primary or secondary endpoints in clinical studies that assess treatment effect for multiple symptoms including  quality of life,  pain, anxiety, fatigue and 
sleep quality  (www.nihpromis.org/ ; 
 www.neruoqol.org). 
 
 7.2.1 General Medical History  
General medical history will be assessed at baseline and in all follow -up visits.  Subjects will be 
queried about any chronic or ongoing health conditions that require treatment (which will be recorded in the CRF).  Subjects will also be asked to provide their list of medications and allergies.  
 7.2.2 Concomitant Medication Use

Multiple Sclerosis is a disease with many disease-related symptoms and complications , and there are 
many common mild side effects associated with PAP therapy .  Due to the patient population and the 
nature of the disease, as well as the lack of experimental interventions in this study (only standard of care procedures and treatments will be used)  we would like to implement the following AE/SAE 
collection /reporting guidelines: 
 
SAE events that meet all 3 of the following criteria will be collected and submitted:  
•     Serious;  •     Related ; and  
•     Unanticipated  
 In addition, the following AEs will be collected and submitted:  
 •     Any AE that results in a change to research  
 9.0 DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS  
 9.1 Sample Size Determination  
Estimates (means and standard deviations) are derived from our recent data that evaluated SDMT scores among MS subjects referred for overnight PSG, and previously published interventional studies in that evaluated the effects of medical interventions on components of the MACFI MS in MS patients. We have chosen to focus on SDMT score as the primary outcome 
variable of interest, as the SDMT encompasses multiple domains of cognitive function, is frequently used in MS clinical studies as a reliable measure of cognitive impairment, and is sensitive to changes in intervention.   
 
Based on a power analysis of two sample means (unequal sample sizes, with 2:1 randomization) with a 0.[ADDRESS_623057] an 86.3% power to detect a 5 -point difference in SDMT score between groups, 
on month 3 testing, for hypothesis 2.  Similarly, using individual MACFIMS components as outcome variables (in separate models), a multiple linear regression power analysis shows that a sample size o f n=140 subjects will yield 88% power to detect an R-square difference of 0.[ADDRESS_623058] (% PAP use per month, as a continuous measure), assuming the R-squared explained by [CONTACT_484819] 0.3.    Although we predict a low dropout rate due to the short duration of the study, if we assume a dropout rate of 15% (10 dropouts per group), we will still have a power of 81.2% power to detect a 5-point difference in SDMT score between groups, on month 3 testing.   
 9.2 Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
Page 26 of 30 
 Aim 1: Multivariate linear regression models will be used to analyze the effects of  baseline PSG -
derived standard measures of sleep disordered breathing (including RDI, ODI, minimum O2 
saturation), on individual cognitive test scores (continuous outcome variables of interest, in separate models) for Aim 1, controlling for other sleep, serological, and clinical variables.  
Additional models that use computed respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y cycle- related EEG changes (calculated as the 
maximum difference between the mean EEG powers associated with each of the 4 respir atory 
cycle segments  as predictor variables ) will be used to evaluate the effects of respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -related 
cortical microarousals on cognitive test scores, controlling for other clinical and sleep- related 
variables.  Separate models that use computed temporal patterns of sleep stages as predictors of 
cognitive test scores will also be constructed.  
 Aim 2: Multivariate linear regression models will be used to test the effects of Group effect  on 3-
month (“post”) cognitive test scores, controlling for baseline (“pre”) test scores.  We will also examine the association of PAP use as a continuous variable, based on mean nightly hours of use per month, on 3-month individual cognitive test scores, controlling for baseline scores. Separate models will be used for each cognitive test of interest. Predictor variables that are unbalanced between groups despi[INVESTIGATOR_484786].  
 T
o evaluate early e ffects of PAP therapy on cognitive scores, sleep stage dynamics will also be 
assessed during PAP titrations to determine whether changes in sleep stage stability  predict 
improvements on cognitive test scores in separate models.

(Group [ADDRESS_623060] ) on tertiary outcome measures including daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (ESS 
scores), fatigue ( FSS, PROMIS scores), and anxiety, pain, and quality of life (PROMIS scores ).   
 10. MONITORING  
 10.[ADDRESS_623061] ceased.  Subjects who are not already established patients in the U-M MS/sleep clinic will be referred for expedited sleep clinic follow  up following their PSG 
diagnosis of OSA.  Whenever possible, these clinical visits will occur in tandem with study visits.  
 Although none of the measures in this study assess self- harm, in the event that a participant 
mentions suicidal ideation or other severe mental distress that could result in harm to self or others, [CONTACT_484826] (Co-Investigator), who is a licensed psychologist, will contact [CONTACT_484820] a standard self-harm/suicide assessment, taking appropriate action (e.g. referral for mental health services, contact[CONTACT_217090]) as needed.   All 
safety related incidents will be rep orted to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_217053].  
 10.2 Monitoring Plan and Information  
Page 27 of 30 
 To assure adequate protection of the rights of human subjects, per 21 CFR 312.50 and 312.53, 
the study will be monitored to ensure that the study is implemented in accordance with the protocol and applicable federal and local regulations, that proper informed consent procedures were followed and to insure the integrity and quality of the data.  A qualified trial monitor will be selected, per 21 CFR 312.53(d) to monitor the tr ial in 
accordance with the protocol and all applicable regulatory requirements.  A monitoring plan will be established to ensure the quality and integrity of the data through pre-investigation, periodic site visits, review of advers e events/subject records, etc.  The Michigan Institute for Clinical and 
Health Research (MICHR) will assist with the selection and support of the monitor assigned for this proposed clinical investigation and prepare the monitoring plan.   11.  DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
 11.1 CRFs / Electronic Data Record  
CRFs , in paper or electronic format, will be utilized and maintained by [CONTACT_5984].  Entries 
made in the CRF must be verifiable against source documents, unless the CRF is considered to be the source document.    11.[ADDRESS_623062] Retention  
Per 21 CRF §312.62, study records will be retained for a minimum of [ADDRESS_623063] (IRBMED, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI).  12.[ADDRESS_623064] will be informed that participation in the study is 
voluntary and that he/she may withdraw from the study at any time and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her subsequent medical treatment or relationship with the treating physician.  This informed consent will be given by [CONTACT_3553] a standard writ ten statement, written in non -
technical language. The subject should read and consider the statement before signing and dating it, and should be given a copy of the signed document. No patient can enter the study before his/her informed consent has been obtained.  
 The informed consent form is considered to be part of the protocol, and will be submitted for IRB approval.

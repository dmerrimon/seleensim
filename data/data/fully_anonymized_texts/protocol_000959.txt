Study enrollment will be extended if the following 2 conditions hold:  (1) 7 or more 
patients of t he 21 eligible patients experience a CR or PR, AND (2) there are patients who 
failed to receive 2 courses of treatment and undergo radiographic evaluation of tumor 
burden after the 2nd course for reasons be unrelated to disease progression.  Thus accrual 
will be extended to “replace” patients who terminated treatment early for reasons of 
adverse events or toxicity or decisions unrelated to disease progression; patients who fail to 
receive 2 courses because of early progression will not be “replaced”.  Altho ugh all eligible 
patients who begin treatment will be included in the primary analysis, this extension will 
permit an estimate of the response rate in those patients who could receive 2 courses of 
therapy.

NCI Protocol #:  9653  
Version Date:  February 20, [ADDRESS_545610] not received any prior chemoth erapy for the 
advanced disease and who are not eligible to receive cisplatin -based chemotherapy .  
 
1.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to estimate the objective respon se rate  of gemcitabine -
eribulin (GE) when given to cisplatin ineligible patients with advanced or unresectable urothelial 
carcinoma who have not received any prior chemoth erapy for the advanced disease.  O bjective 
response is defined as either a complete r esponse (CR) or a partial response (PR) based on 
RECIST v1.1.  
 
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives are (1) to estimate the median progression -free survival (PFS), and (2) 
to summarize the toxicity profile (using CTCAE v4 criteria) of the GE regi men in these patients.  
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study Disease (s) 
Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder remains one of the most challenging and lethal urologic 
cancers. It is the second most common genitourinary (GU) cancer next to prostate cancer with a 
2013 estimated i ncidence of 72,570 (69,250 in 2011) and has risen to be the second most deadly 
GU cancer with 15,210 estimated deaths in 2013 (14,990 estimated bladder cancer deaths in 
2011)1,2. Many of these patients will have superficial disease at diagnosis (75 -80%); however, 
approximately two thirds of those who present with muscle invasion will go on to develop 
regional or systemi c disease. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_431318], 5 -year survival rates for patients with invasive bladder cancer remain suboptimal 3. 
Virtually all deaths from bladder cancer result from muscle invasive disease that recurs or 
meta stasizes after local therapy4. 
 
Platinum -based regimens are the mainstay of treatment for recurrent or metastatic bladder 
cancer5. The MVAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin) regimen has 
produced response rates of 40 to 70% with 13 to 28% of patients having complete responses in 
Phase II and III trials6,7. The gemcitabine -cisplatin  (GC)  doublet has shown a similar response 
rate and survival as the MVAC combination, but a reportedly better toxicity profile7. However, 
the median overall survival of patients treated with either regimen is still only between 12 and 14 
months and less than 10% of pa tients become long term disease -free survivors7-10.  
 
In addition, patients affected with this disease are often elderly and have multiple comorbid 
conditions  such as renal insufficiency and congestive heart failure, which preclude them from 
receiving platinum -based therapy. It is estimated that 50% of patients are cisplatin -ineligible due 
to renal function impairment, compromised performance status, and/or com orbid conditions 
(such as congestive heart failure, among others) preventing them from receiving high volume 
hydration11. While it is less clear what precise pr oportion of the cisplatin -ineligible patients have

Version Date:  February 20, 2017  
 
7 renal impairment as the sole reason for ineligibility, data from the adjuvant setting (i.e., patients 
fit enough to undergo radical surgery) suggest that between 25 -50% of patients had a creatinine 
clearan ce of <60ml/min depending on the formula used for calculation and up to 40% of patients 
over [ADDRESS_545611] of care. There still 
is an ongoing need for the development of active agents to fill this void. Eribulin is a notable 
candidate to fulfill this role, given its reliance principally on hepatic metabolism and its 
promising singl e agent activity in early clinical trials13. 
 
2.2 Eribulin E7389  
Halichondrin B is a potent antimitotic agent due to its inhibition of tubulin polymerization and 
microtubule assembly. It has remarkable in vitro  and in vivo  activity in a number of human 
tumor models, including melanoma, oste ogenic sarcoma, lung and colon cancer14,15. 
Of the 180 compounds that were screened, eribulin (previously E7389, E R 086526, and NSC -
707389) was shown to retain significant in vitro as well as in vivo efficacy in a variety of human 
tumor xenograft models, including breast, colon, melanoma and ovarian cancer models16. 
Eribulin showed sub -nM in vitro growth inhibition against several human cancer cell lines and 
was found to induce a G 2-M cell cycle arrest in association with the disruption of mitotic 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_36874]17. Further studies showed that prolonged mitotic blockage by [CONTACT_431330]18. The studies in xenograft models demonstrated [ADDRESS_545612] toxicity19. 
 
In light of this very promis ing anticancer activity , preclinical studies with eribulin were 
undertaken in rats and dogs. These studies showed that eribulin exhibits rapid and extensive 
tissue distribution in rats and dogs with an extended terminal t 1⁄[ADDRESS_545613] completed accrual. In a 
CTEP sponsored phase I trial conducted by [CONTACT_431331], eribulin was 
given as a weekly bolus intravenous injection three weeks out of four, starting at 0.125 
mg/m2/wk. The first part of the trial was a rapid escalation phase, which ended with a grade 3 
alkaline phosphatase elevation at 0.5 mg/m2/wk. The second part of the trial consisted of a 
standard 3x3 dose escalation, which ended at 2.0 mg/m2/wk with one grade 3 febrile neutropenia 
and one grade 4 neutropenia. The MTD was 1.4 mg/m2/wk. Non -hematological toxicities 
included hypoglycemia, hypophosphatemia and fatigue. Of 38 evaluable patients who had 
refractory or advanced solid tumors, two had a partial  response (one bladder, see below), three 
had minor responses and twelve had stable disease lasting a median of 4 months (range 2 -14)13. 
Of these, three patients had heavily pretreated bladder cancer. One experienced  a partial response 
and the other two had stable disease for 24 weeks.  
NCI Protocol #:  9653  
Version Date:  February 20, 2017

The pharmacokinetic studies undertaken in this study demonstrated tri -phasic elimination with a 
rapid distributive phase followed by a prolonged elimination from plasma resulting in a terminal 
t1/2 of 36 -48 hours. At the MTD, plasma levels remained at con centrations (median of 0.8 nM, 
range 0.2 - 2.5 nM) well above those required for in vitro toxicity for more than one week. A 
small fraction of drug (< 10%) was excreted unchanged into the urine and no circulating 
metabolites were detected13. 
 
The two Eisai -sponsored trials are looking at  different schedules of administration of a 1 -hour 
intravenous infusion of eribulin. In one , the drug is given weekly for three weeks out of four 
(study #101), and in the other the drug is given once every three weeks (study #102). Twenty -six 
patients have  been enrolled to the first study (#101), with doses ranging from 0.5 to 2.8 mg/m2. 
Grade 3 neutropenia and grade 3 fatigue were reported at the 0.5 mg/m2 dose level but the MTD 
for this schedule has not been reported21. Eighteen patients have been enrolled to the second 
study (#102), with doses ranging from 0.25 to 4 mg/m2. Neutropenia was found to be the dose -
limiting toxicity in this study, with the MTD expected to be at 2mg/m2 on this schedule. Four 
patients have had stable disease for more than [ADDRESS_545614] and lung cancer that are ongoing are 
evaluating the 1.4 mg/m2/wk dose administered as an intravenous bolus for three out of every 
four weeks. Accrual to these trials is ongoing but the safety da ta collected up until this point 
suggests that dosing [ADDRESS_545615] recently, a CTEP sponsored p hase I trial of GE demonstrated safety of the combination at 
1000 mg/m2 of gemcitabine and 1.4 mg/m2, of eribulin  where each of the agent was given on 
days 1 and 8 of a 21 day cy cle24. More details on this study are discussed in 2.4. 
 
2.3 Gemcitabine  
Gemcitabine is a pyrimidine antimetabolite, 2'deoxy -2'difluoro -cytidine (gemcitabine) has been 
introduced into clinical practice for urothelial and a range of other tumors. In preclinical systems 
gemcitabine showed very signif icant activity against experimental solid tumors 25 and human 
tumor xenografts 26. It is acti vated intracellularly to the triphosphate, 2'deoxy -2'difluoro -cytidine 
5'-triphosphate (dFdCTP) and in this form is incorporated into DNA 27-29.  Gemcitabine e ntry to 
cells requires the presence of the nucleoside transporter system, with cells deficient in this 
transporter being gemcitabine resistant 27. The activity of gemcitabine is cell cycle specific with 
blockade at the G1/S phase transition, perhaps suggesting that RR inhibition is an important 
contributor to gemcitabine antineoplastic effect.  
 
In the initial  phase I clinical trial, the drug was given over a 30 minute infusion weekly for three 
weeks every four weeks.  The maximum tolerated dose was 790 mg/m2 with myelosuppression 
predominantly thrombocytopenia and anemia being the dose limiting toxicity 7,30. However, 
subsequent studies have shown that considerably higher doses can be given safely, particularly  to 
patients with little or no prior therapy.  In patients with non -small cell lung cancer and no prior 
therapy, O'Rourke  et al. found that 2500 mg/m2 given over 4 hours every two weeks was below

9 the MTD 31.  Initial pharmacokinetic studies showed a rapid elimination of the drug with a 
median half life of eight minutes.  The drug was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_431319] 2',2' -difluorodeoxyuridine which had a longer half life, with a median of [ADDRESS_545616] bladder cancer was noted in t he phase I study by 
[CONTACT_431332]. in 14 patients receiving gemcitabine at doses greater than 875 mg/m2, they 
observed 1 CR and 2 PR 32.  A response rate of 28% was observed in a pha se II trial in 
previously untreated patients with bladder cancer 33.  Subsequently, the combination of 
gemcitabine and cisplatin was assessed in a phase II trial with a response rate of 41% 34. This 
combination was then compared to MVAC in a randomized phase III trial and found to produce 
equivalent response and survival  with better quality of life 7. De Mulder et al. noted response rate 
of 8.1% or [ADDRESS_545617] combination regimens for urothelial cancer including MVAC36,37, 
GC7, PGC38 and MCAVI11 as well as single agent39 and as will be discussed was tried in 
combination with eribulin in a CTEP sponsored trial - see 2.4. 
 
2.4 Rationale  
Based on the preliminary evidence of clinical activity of eribulin in metastatic urothelial 
carcinomas, we propose a phase II study of this drug given at a dose of 1.4 mg/m2 in 
combination with gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 on days [ADDRESS_545618] eribulin to be well -tolerated in 
patients with renal dysfunction at the MTD previously defined for patients with normal renal 
function (i.e. 1.4 mg/m2/week). Gemcitabine can be given at full dos es to patients with a CrCl > 
30ml/min.  
 
The Phase II study of single agent eribulin in first line advanced urothelial cancer patients was 
completed and presented at ASCO 2010 with a response rate of 38%, median TTP 3.[ADDRESS_545619] of care for urothelial cancer, for example with gemcitabine: respons e rate 22.5 -
28% and overall survival 5 -12.5 months, and cisplatin: response rate 12% and overall survival 
8.2 months33,37,39. 
 
The phase I study in renal impaired patients was also presented at ASCO 2010 suggesting that 
full dosing of eribulin is feasible and ef ficacious in patients with creatinine clearance values 
down to 20 mL/min41. Eribulin also has significant activity in patients who have progressed after 
platin regimens for advanced or metastatic disease. In a recent NCI -CTEP sponsored phase II 
study of eribulin in platinum -treated tubulin naive advanced urothelial cancer, overall RR was 
36% (95%CI: 21, 53%), including 1 CR, 7 PR, and 6 unconfirmed PR. [Confirmed RR was 2 1% 
(95%CI: 9, 36%)]. Stable disease for ≥12 weeks was seen in 12  patients (31%). PD was best 
response in 11  patients (28%). At median follow -up of 5.9 (1.4, 17.1) months, median PFS was 
4.1 months (2.6, 6.4). Median OS was 9.6 months (5.3, ∞) (16  patients died). PFS was associated

10 with Bajorin risk group (p=0.005 for trend). Toxicities included grade 3/4 neutropenia (24), 
grade 3 febrile neutropenia (3), grade 1/2 sensory neuropathy (14), grade 3 hyperglycemia (1), 
grade 1 hyponatremia (8), grade 1/2 alopec ia (16), grade 1 leg fatigue & aching (2)42. 
 
Most recently a CTEP -sponsored phase I dose escalation trial of GE has been conducted which 
tested four dose levels of thi s doublet. Gemcitabine -Eribulin doses were as follows: 800 -0.7, 
1000 -0.7, 1000 -1.0 and 1000 -1.4 mg/m2. Safety for the highest dose level was established and 
evidence of antitumor activity for this regimen was seen24. A summary of the findings in this 
trial is provided courtesy of [CONTACT_431344] from the Ottawa Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  (personal 
communication)24. In this trial, 45 patients were included in the study in 3 cohorts: pretreated 
(n=21), gynecologic cancers expansion cohort (n=10), and chemo -naïve (n=14). The initially 
planned Day 1, 8, and [ADDRESS_545620] common 
grade 3 -4 toxicities included: neutropenia (24), leukopenia (16), lymphopenia (12), ALT rise (7), 
fatigue (7), AST rise (5), thrombocytopenia (4), anemia, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting (2 each). 
Non-hematological toxicities and specifically neuropathy were minimal. Efficacy assessments 
showed evidence for anti -tumor activity in each of the pre -defined cohorts. In the pretreated 
cohort, disease control rate (DCR) was 48% (SD 8, PR 2, PD 7, inevaluable 4 , n=21).  In the 
gynecologic cancers expansion cohort, DCR was 80%, including 9 ovarian cancers (SD 6, PR 1, 
PD 2) and 1 endometrial cancer with SD.  In the chemo -naïve cohort, DCR was 57% (SD 8, PR 
2, PD 3, inevaluable 1).  
 
Eribulin is approved by [CONTACT_38785] A for use in metastatic breast cancer previously treated with 
chemotherapy after demonstrating an overall survival advantage over physicians’ choice in the 
EMBRACE trial43.

NCI Protocol #:  9653  
Version Date:  February 20, 2017  
 
13 3.2.7 Pregnant women are excluded from this study because eribulin  is an anti -tubulin 
agent with the potential for teratogenic or abo rtifacient effects. Because there is an 
unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of 
the mother with eribulin and gemcitabine , breastfeeding should be discontinued if the 
mother is treated with  eribulin a nd gemcitabine .  
 
3.2.8 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -positive patients with inadequate CD4 
counts or those who are on combination antiretroviral therapy with strong CYP3A4 
effects are in eligible for this trial  
 
3.2.9 QT prolongation has been observed in patients  that received Eribulin and 
therefore:  
• Patients with baseline QTc prolongation greater than grade [ADDRESS_545630] 
be mo nitored with ECG (EKG) exams,  for the first 3 cycles of treatme nt. 
Eribulin time to Cmax after infusion is about 10 minutes, and half life is 
40 minutes44. ECG (EKG) should be performed  between 10 to 40 minutes 
after eribuli n administration (on day 1 and day 8 of treatment) . Continued 
ECG (EKG) monitoring beyond cycle 3 can be done at the discretion of 
the treating physician.  
• Patients with congenital long QT syndrome are excluded from this study . 
• Other medications known to pr olong QT interval should be discontinued 
and if not possible, patient is excluded from this study .  Refer to 
http://crediblemeds.org  for lists of drugs that may cause QT prolongation.  
 
3.3 Inclusion of Women and Minoriti es 
 
Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.

4.1.2 CTEP Associate Registration Procedures / CTEP -IAM Account  
The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) Identity and Access Management 
(IAM) applic ation is a web -based application intended for use by [CONTACT_33976] (i.e., 
all physicians involved in the conduct of NCI -sponsored clinical trials) and Associates 
(i.e., all staff involved in the conduct of NCI -sponsored clinical trials).  
 
Associates w ill use the CTEP -IAM application to register (both initial registration and 
annual re -registration) with CTEP and to obtain a user account.  
 
Investigators will use the CTEP -IAM application to obtain a user account only. (See 
CTEP Investigator Registration Procedures above for information on registering with 
CTEP as an Investigator, which must be completed before a CTEP -IAM account can be 
requested.)  
 
An active CTEP -IAM user account is needed to access all CTEP and CTSU (Cancer 
Trials Support Unit) websites and applications , and is critical to the conduct of this study, 
including document access, patient enrollment, and clinical data submission.  
 
Additional information can be found on the CTEP website at

4.2 Site Registration  
 
This study is supported by [CONTACT_6818] (CTSU).  
 
Each investigator or group of investigators at a clinical site must obtain IRB approval for this 
protocol and submit IRB approval and supporting documentation to the CTSU Regulatory Office 
before they can be approved to enroll patients.  Assignment of site r egistration status in the 
CTSU Regulatory Support System (RSS) uses extensive data to make a determination of whether 
a site has fulfilled all regulatory criteria including but not limited to: an active Federal Wide 
NCI Protocol #:  9653  
Version Date:  February 20, 2017  
 
15 Assurance (FWA) number, an active roster  affiliation with the Lead Network or a participating 
organization, a valid IRB approval, and compliance with all protocol specific requirements.  
 
Sites participating on the NCI CIRB initiative that are approved by [CONTACT_33978]. For sites 
using the CIRB, IRB approval information is received from the CIRB and applied to the RSS in 
an automated process.  Signatory Institutions must submit a Study Specific Worksheet for Local 
Context (SSW) to the CIRB via IRBManager to indicate their intent to open the study locally.  
The CIRB’s approval of the SSW is then communicated to the CTSU Regulatory Office.  In 
order for the SSW approval to be processed, the Signatory Institu tion must inform the CTSU 
which CIRB -approved institutions aligned with the Signatory Institution are participating in the 
study.

protocol or the enrolling investigator’s status with the NCI or their affiliat ed networks.  
 
4.3 Patient Registration  
 
4.3.1 OPEN / IWRS  
 
Patient enrollment will be facilitated using the Oncology Patient Enrollment Network 
(OPEN).  OPEN is a web -based registration system available to users on a 24/7 basis .  It 
is integrated with the CTSU Enter prise System for regulatory and roster data interchange  
and with  the Theradex Interactive Web Response System (IWRS)  for retrieval of patient 
registration/randomization assignment.  Patient enrollment data entered by [CONTACT_33979] / IWRS will automati cally transfer to the NCI’s clinical data management system, 
Medidata Rave.  
 
For trials with slot reservation requirements, OPEN will connect to IWRS at enrollment 
initiation to check slot availability.  R egistration staff should ensure that a slot is 
available and secured for the patient before completing an  enrollment.  
 
• Site staff with the appropriate roles will reserve slots using IWRS 
(https://open.ctsu.org/ ).  
• City of Hope Cancer Center will receive notification via the IWRS when a slot has been 
reserved. An email will be sent from the City of Hope Cancer Center to the site 
requesting further information such as: the patient initials, tumor type and potential start 
date. The spot will show as ‘pending approval’ in the system until the site sends a 
REGISTRATION FORM/ELIGIBILITY CHECKLIST (see CTSU website) 
accompanied with the signed consent, baseline labs, pathology report, CT/x -ray reports to 
the City of Hope Cancer Center at [EMAIL_407]  for review and confirmation  of 
eligibility.  
• Once the Registration has been reviewed, the City of Hope Cancer Center will either 
approve or disapprove the request depending on confirmation of patient eligibility. If 
approved, the City of Hope Cancer Centre will update the spot to ‘reserved’ in IWRS.  
• The site can now enroll the patient into the study in OPEN  
* At the time of registration the treatment arm will be randomly assigned  
 
NCI Protocol #:  9653  
Version Date:  February 20, 2017

treatment  information.   Please print this confirmation for your records.   
 
4.3.2 OPEN/IWRS User Requirements  
 
OPEN/IWRS users must meet the following requirements:  
• Have a valid CTEP -IAM account ( i.e., CTEP username [CONTACT_2383]).  
• To enroll patients or request slot reserv ations:  Be on an ETCTN Corresponding  
or Participating Organization roster with the role of Registrar.  
• To approve slot reservations or access cohort management:  Be identified to 
Theradex as the “Client Admin” for the study.  
• Have regulatory approval for t he conduct of the study at their site.  
 
Prior to accessing OPEN/IWRS , site staff should verify the following:  
• All eligibility criteria have been met within the protocol stated timeframes.  Site 
staff should use the  registration forms provided on the CTSU we b site as a tool to 
verify eligibility.  
• If applicable, all patients have signed an appropriate consent form and HIPAA 
authorization form.

4.4 General Guidelines  
 
Following registration, patients should begin protocol treatment within  7 days.   Issues that would 
cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Principal Investigator.  If a patient does not 
receive protocol therapy fo llowing registration, the patient’s registration on the study may be 
canceled.  The Study Coordinator ([EMAIL_593] ) should be notified of cancellations as soon as 
possible.  
 
5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Agent Administration  
 
Treatme nt will be administered on an outpatient  basis.  Reported adverse events and potential 
NCI Protocol #:  9653  
Version Date:  February 20, 2017  
 
18 risks are described in Secti on 7.  Appropriate dose modifications  are described in Section 6 .  No 
investigational or commercial agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_431320]'s malignancy.  
 
5.1.1 Gemcitabine and Eribulin  
Gemcitabine should be administered before Eribulin.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Eribulin ( E7389 ) Administration  
 
Eribulin will be administered on an outpatient basis  after ge mcitabine  as an intravenous bolus 
over 2 -5 minutes, once a week for two weeks in a row (on Day s 1 and 8) of a 21 day cycle.   
The patient’s starting dose will be 1.4 mg/m2/week.  The dose may be reduced for individual 
patients in subsequent cycles dependin g on toxicity (Section 6.2); there will be no intra -
patient dose escalation.    
 
 Reported adverse events (AEs) and potential risks of eribulin  are described in Section 7.1. 
Appropriate dose modifications for eribulin  are described in Section 6.2.  No invest igational 
or commercial agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_431321] n those described in Section 5  (Treatment Plan) 
may be administered with the intent to treat the patient’s malignancy.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Gemcitabine Administration  
 
Gemcitabine at a dose of 1000mg/m2 will be administered  intravenously over 30 minutes 
before eribulin once a week for two weeks in a row (on Day 1 and 8) of a 21 day cycle.  
 
The patient’s starting dose will be 1000  mg/m2/week.  The dose may be reduced for 
individual patients in subsequent cycles depending on toxicity (Section 6.2); there will be no 
intra-patient dose escalation.    
 
Reported adverse events (AEs) and potential risks of gemcitabine  are described in Section 0. 
Appropriate dose modifications for gemcitabine  are desc ribed in Section 6.2.  No 
investigational or commercial agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_431322] 5.0 
(Treatment Plan) may be administered with the intent to treat the patient’s malignancy.  
 
 
5.2 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Car e Guidelines  
 
Prophylactic antiemetic therapy will be given  as per institutional policy . 
 
Erythropoietin may be administered for anemia/fatigue at the investigators’ discretion, however 
prophylactic use of granulocyte/platelet colony stimulating factors is  not permitted . If the patient 
experiences febrile neutropenia as a documented toxicity on this study then granulocyte colony 
stimulating factors may be used in line with institutional and ASCO guidelines.   
 
Antidiarrheal medications, potentially including  loperamide, along with supplemental fluids and 
other supportive measures are recommended at the discretion of the investigator.  
NCI Protocol #:  9653  
Version Date:  February 20, 2017  
 
19  
All supportive measures consistent with optimal patient care will be given throughout the study.  
Patients should be cautioned about the concomitant use of cimetidine, trimethoprim, or other 
agents that interfere with creatinine secretion or the creatinine assay.   
  
5.3 Duration of Therapy  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event (s), treatment may continue until one o f 
the following criteria applies:  
 
• Disease progression,  
 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  with a 14 day 
delay in protocol scheduled treatment , 
 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
 
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study , or 
 
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable 
for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
 
Note: if a patient is to come off protocol apart from for disease progression then the 
treating physici an should contact [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_431323] ([EMAIL_8228] ). 
 
5.[ADDRESS_545633] .  In addition, p atients 
removed from study for unacceptable adverse event (s) will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization of the adverse event  and will then be followe d every 3 months, as above . 
 
5.5 Criteria for Removal from Study  
 
Patients will remain on -study for 36 months after going off treatment, progression of disease  or 
initiation of new treatment, (whichever comes first)  or at death or patient withdrawal of consent . 
The reason for study removal and the date the patient was removed must be documented in the 
Case Report Form.  Every effort should be made to evaluate patients for a date and details of 
progression should they come off treatment for reasons other than pro gressive disease and in all 
cases for survival unless consent is specifically with drawn for that follow up.

Management of anemia (RBC transfusion,  erythropoietin, etc) need not delay treatment at the 
discretion of the treating physician.  
 
Fatigue and other laboratory and non -laboratory toxicities not listed above or under dose 
modifications (6.2, 6.3 and 6.4) may not require treatment delays and ma y be managed at the 
discretion of the treating physician.  
 
Laboratory evaluations must be repeated within [ADDRESS_545636] treatment delayed by 1 week to allow 
for rec overy of organ function. Patients who cannot be retreated within 2 weeks of the originally 
scheduled Day 1 or Day 8 treatment  should be removed from study.  
 
Patients with grade 1 QTc elevation are monitored with ECG (EKG) exam ination  after 
eribulin  treatme nt between [ADDRESS_545637] after 6 treatments with eribulin is low, and therefore continuation of ECG (EKG) 
monitoring for eribulin beyond the third cycle is left to the discretion of the treating 
physician.  Patients with prolongation of QTc to grade [ADDRESS_545638] ECG 
(EKG) undertaken at intervals until this resolves and have their ongoing involvement 
discussed with the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_431323] ([EMAIL_8228] ).

treatment (bot h eribulin and gemcitabine) will be held until toxicities resolve to a grade that 
would allow treatment to proceed. If patient cannot be treated  (retreated) within 2 weeks of the 
originally scheduled Day 1 or Day 8 treatment , then treatment with eribulin w ill be discontinued .  
 
• There will be no dose modifications for grade 1 or 2 to xicities that recover to a grade 
0 or 1 or otherwise meet laboratory re -treatment parameters in 6.1 prior to the

   which resolves to a grade 0 or 1 prior to the next cycle of treatment, or within 
a  2 week delay, the patient may be retreated with eribulin at one dose level 
lower . If a lower dose is not possible  due to a prior dose reduction , then 
treatment with eribulin will be discontinued . 
 
• If a patient experiences a grade 3 or 4 hematolo gical toxicity  attributable to eribulin , 
excluding:  
o Leuk openia  
o Lymphopenia  
 
  which resolves to a grade 0 or 1, prior to the next cycle of treatment, or 
within a ≤ 2 week delay, the pat ient may be retreated with eribulin one dose 
level lower  or at the same level with G -CSF support based on the preference 
of the treating physician . If a lower dose is not possible due to a prior dose 
reduction, then treatment with eribulin will be disconti nued .

6.3 Dose modifications for gemcitabine  
 
• If gemcitabine is discontinued for any reason other than disease progression, patients may 
continue to receive eribulin . In cases of disease progression, combination treatment will be 
discontinued.  
 
• Gemcitabine doses held on day 8 of a cycle where day 8 dose of eribulin is administered will 
not be made up at a later date.  
• If more than one dose reduction applies, then use th e lowest. Doses that are reduced at any 
point in a cycle will not be subsequently increased.

7. ADVERSE EVENTS :  LIST AND REPORTIN G REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
following list of AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an observed AE (Section 7.2) will 
determine whether the event re quires expedited  reporting (via CTEP -AERS ) in addition  to 
routine  reporting.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_545644] (s) (CAEPR s) 
 
The Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of 
reported and/or pot ential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform 
presentation of events by [CONTACT_6764]. In addition to the comprehensive list, a subset, the 
Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and 
is identified with bold and italicized text. This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are 
protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting to NCI (except as noted below).  Refer to the 
'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements ' 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf   for 
further clarification. Frequency is provided based on 2318 patients. Below is the CAEPR for 
NCI Protocol #:  9653  
Version Date:  February 20, 2017  
 
25 Eribulin Mesylate (E7389; Halichondrin B Analog).  
 
NOTE : Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF  they exceed the grade noted in parentheses 
next to the AE in the SPEER.  If this CAEPR is part of a combination protocol using mul tiple 
investigational agents and has an AE listed on diff erent SPEERs, use the lower of the grades 
to determine if expedited reporting is required.

FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor (NCI) ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or not 
they are considered related to the invest igational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] e xisting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] ≥ 24 
hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be li fe threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. (F DA, 21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
 
ALL SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST  be immediately reported to the NCI via AdEERS 
within the timeframes detailed in the table below.

7.5 Secondary Malignanc y 
 
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy ( e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the  initial neoplasm.  
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an 
NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP -AERS . Three options are available to describe the event:  
 
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy ( e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia 
[AML])  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
• Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be 
reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in ea ch protocol.  
 
7.6 Second Malignancy  
 
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a 
metastasis from the initial malignancy).   Second malignancies require ONLY routine reporting 
via CDUS  unless otherwise specified .

8.[ADDRESS_545654] description and storage: (Gemzar®, Lilly Oncology) The gemcitabine will not 
be provided by [CONTACT_431336]. Gemcitabine 
is commercially available in vials containing either 200 mg or 1 g of gemcitabine HCl 
(expressed as free base) formulated with mannitol (200 mg or 1 g, respectively) and 
sodium  acetate (12.5 mg or 62.5 mg, respectively) as a sterile lyophilized powder. 
Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment. 
The recommended diluent for reconstitution of gemcitabine is 0.9% Sodium Chloride 
Injection withou t preservatives. Due to solubility considerations, the maximum 
concentration for gemcitabine upon reconstitution is 40 mg/mL. Reconstitution at 
concentrations greater than 40 mg/mL may result in incomplete dissolution, and should 
be avoided. When prepared as directed, gemcitabine solutions are stable for 24 hours at 
controlled room temperature 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F). Solutions of reconstituted 
gemcitabine should not be refrigerated, as crystallization may occur. Please refer to the

NCI Protocol #:  9653  
Version Date:  February 20, [ADDRESS_545658] – Solid Tumors  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be  evaluated for disea se at baseline prior to 
treatment start and then  re-evaluated for response every 6 weeks  (i.e. after every 2 cycles ).  For 
patients who achieve a CR or PR, the next set of scans will serve as confirmatory scans, provided 
that they are obtained at least 4  weeks following initial documentation of objective response.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) guideline 
(version 1.1)45.  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor 
lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST 
criteria.  
 
11.1.[ADDRESS_545659] one dimension (longest diam eter to be recorded) as ≥[ADDRESS_545660] 
x-ray or as ≥[ADDRESS_545661] be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might  or might not 
be considered measurable.  If the investigator thinks it appropriate to include them, the 
conditions under which such lesions should be considered must be defined in the 
protocol . 
 
Malignant lymph nodes.   To be considered pathologically enlar ged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥[ADDRESS_545662] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only 
NCI Protocol #:  9653  
Version Date:  February 20, 2017  
 
39 the short axis will be measured and followed.  
 
Non-measurable disease .  All other lesions (or sites of disea se), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), 
are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmo nitis, inflammatory breast disease, 
and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non -measurable.  
 
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions (n either measurable nor non -measurable) 
since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if n on-
cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions.  
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be  identified as target 
lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved 
organs, but in addition should be those that lend them selves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself 
to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be 
measured reproducibly should be selected.  A  sum of the diameters (longest for non -
nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, 
then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used 
as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable 
dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesions  over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but 
the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow -up.  
 
11.1.3  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of  treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the 
treatment.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based 
NCI Protocol #:  9653  
Version Date:  February 20, 2017  
 
40 evaluatio n is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
Clinical lesions   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial ( e.g., skin nodu les and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm diameter as 
assessed using calipers ( e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by 
[CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as  measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_545663] 
slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be 
twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body 
scans).   
 
Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol 
should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body  scans should be performed 
with breath -hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
 
PET-CT  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a  combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a 
PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast) , 
then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be 
used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over 
time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which 
may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy   The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological re sponse when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where 
recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 
Tumor markers   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially abo ve the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered 
in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent 
ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published 
[JNCI 96:487 -488, 2004; J Clin Oncol  17, 3461 -3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol  26:1148 -1159, 
2008].  In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -[ADDRESS_545664]-line trials in ovarian cancer [ JNCI  92:1534 -1535, 2000].  
 
Cytology, Histology   These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
NCI Protocol #:  9653  
Version Date:  February 20, 2017  
 
41 responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell t umors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease is mandatory to  differentiate between response or stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
FDG -PET  While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis 
of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
 
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.  
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive FDG -
PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow -up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal 
FDG -PET scan).  If the positive F DG-PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing 
site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this 
is not PD.  
c. FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual  radiographic abnormality is thought to represent 
fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be 
prospectively described in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623] -specific medical 
literature for the indication.  However, it must be  acknowledged that both approaches 
may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy 
resolution/sensitivity.  
 
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding  tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
11.1.4  Response Criteria  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <1 0 
mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the 
NCI Protocol #:  9653  
Version Date:  February 20, [ADDRESS_545665] on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  
the appearance of one or m ore new lesions is also considered progressions).  
 
Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesi ons 
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis).  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  Appearance of one or  more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non -target lesions.  Unequivocal progression  
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall 
disease status change, not a single lesion increase.     
 
Althou gh a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_33954], and the progression 
status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal 
Investigator).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the tre atment started).  The patient's best 
response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria.

Note :  Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment  without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be 
reported as “symptomatic deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to document the 
objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

this category when no lesions can be measured is not advised  
 
11.1.5  Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response :  The durati on of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first 
date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference 
for progressive disease the s mallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met 
for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 
Duration of stable diseas e:  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

Progression -free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment 
to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.   Patients who begin another 
cytoreductive therapy prior to prior to progressing will be censored at the tim e of their 
last disease evaluation prior to starting the new treatment.  Patients who have not yet 
progressed or died will be censored at the time of their last disease evaluation.  
Progression of disease (PD) will be defined as described above and as asse ssed at the 
local treating institution .

13. STATISTICAL CONSID ERATIONS  
 
This is a Phase II/Screening trial.  Currently there is no highly effective “standard of care” for 
patients with advanced urothelial cancer who are not suitable candidates for receiving cisplatin -
based therapy ; and in this setting , the gemcitabin e-carboplatin combination (GC) is often used.  
Based on the results of this screening trial, if the activity of GE is sufficiently promising  based 
on the overall response rate , then the next step would be to plan a randomized Phase II trial of 
GE vs. GC ;  if GE demonstrates superiority in terms of progression -free survival (PFS), then a 
Phase III study would be considered .  After discussion with CTEP, it was determined that for GE 
to be considered sufficiently promising for further study in this population of patients with 
advanced urothelial cancer who are not suitable candidates for receiving cisplatin -based therapy , 
that GE should have  a response rate that was clearly greater than 20% and not significantly less 
than 50%.  
 
13.1 Study Design / Endpoints  
 
Primar y Endpoint .  The primary endpoint in this trial is objective response rate defined as either 
a confirmed complete response (CR) or a confirmed partial response (PR) based on RECIST 
v1.1 (described in Section 11.1 above) . 
 
Study Design .   This trial will us e a Simon two -stage Optimum design, with a false -positive error 
rate of 9%  when the true objective response rate is 2 0% and a false -negative error rate of 9% 
when the true response rate is 50% .  A total of [ADDRESS_545675] 7 
NCI Protocol #:  9653  
Version Date:  February 20, 2017  
 
49 patients. If 2 or more responses are observed , the trial will continue to a total of 21  patients .   If 7 
or more patients of the 21 experience a CR or PR then th is will be evidence that the true response 
rate of GE is greater than 20% and not significantly less than 50%.  
 
Study enrollment will be extended beyond 21 patients treated to 21 response -evaluable patients if 
the following 2 conditions hold:  (1) 7 or mor e patients of the 21 eligible patients experience a 
CR or PR, AND (2) there are patients who failed to receive 2 courses of treatment and undergo 
radiographic evaluation of tumor burden after the 2nd course for reasons be unrelated to disease 
progression.  Thus accrual will be extended to “replace” patients who terminated treatment early 
for reasons of adverse events or toxicity or decisions unrelated to disease progression; patients 
who fail to receive 2 courses because of early progression will not be “re placed”.  Although all 
eligible patients who begin treatment will be included in the primary analysis, this extension will 
permit an estimate of the response rate in those patients who could receive 2 courses of therapy.   
Accrual will be assessed on a quar terly basis.  
 
Secondary Endpoints .  The secondary endpoints  are (1) progression free survival calculated from 
the date of start of GE treatment to the date of progression or death prior to progression  (as 
defined in Section 11.1.6) , and (2) toxicity as gra ded by [CONTACT_12397] v4 . 
 
Monitoring Safety/Tolerability .  Safety and toxicity will be reviewed monthly at the CCCP Data 
Coordinating Meetings, in which all toxicities (especially Grade 3+) are assembled and 
reviewed.  The first 7 patients treated with the com bination of gemcitabine and eribulin  will be 
specifically monitored during these calls.  In addition, safety boundaries (using a modified 
sequential probability ratio test) will be used to flag an unexpected number of patients who 
experience unacceptable t oxicity (TOX).    
 
In th is Phase II /screening  trial, unacceptable toxicity (TOX) will be defined as any toxicity 
related to treatment, that results in failure to complete two courses of GE, or treatment related 
death at any time on treatment.  Patients who  have  not yet completed  the first 2 course s of GE, or 
who do not complete 2 courses of treatment and do not experience an unacceptable toxicity, will 
not be considered at risk for TOX (for purposes of applying these toxicity monitoring boundaries 
only).  
 
Criteria for flagging an excessive number of patients with TOX are based on the sequential 
probability ratio test with =0.15, =0.10, po=0.10 and p a=0.25. Every time a patient is classified 
as having had a TOX, the cumulative number of patients (X) who ha ve experienced a TOX will 
be compared to the number of patients (N) who are at risk.  If the number of patients, N, is 
greater than N X, the number given in the bottom row of the Table below, then the boundary has 
not been crossed . If N is less than or equa l to N X, then the boundary has been crossed and a 
careful review of all the toxicities and tolerability will be initiated.  
 
Table:  Boundary for Monitoring Toxicity  
X: # pts who experienced a TOX  2 3 4 5 
Nx:  Boundary crossed if # pts. At risk (N) is  Nx 2 8 14 20 
 
These rules were selected to ensure a small  chance that the boundary would not be crossed  if the 
NCI Protocol #:  9653  
Version Date:  February 20, 2017  
 
50 true chance of TOX  were less than 10% and a reasonable chance that the boundary would be 
crossed  if the true chance were 2 5-30%. The Table b elow summarizes these probabilities.  The 
values in the table below are based on 10,000 simulations and are accurate to 0.01 (based on a 
95% confidence interval).  
     
Table: Probability  that the Toxicity Monitoring Boundary is Crossed  Because Too Many Pat ients 
Experienced a TOX  
True Chance of an Unacceptable Toxicity (TOX)  10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 
Probability of Suspending Accrual to Review Toxicities   0.08 0.24 0.45 0.64 0.80 
 
13.2    Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
This trial will enroll a minimum of 7 eligible pat ients who begin treatment and a maximum of  up 
to 25 -29 patients, depending on how many patients will be replaced because they did not receive 
2 courses.  
 
This trial is expected to accrue patients at a rate of approximately 2 patients per month.  
 
This stud y is open to men and women and to all racial and ethnic categories.  Based on the 
accrual to our nearly completed trial of eribulin as a single agent in advanced bladder cancer 
(NCI # 7435),  we would expect the following accrual to this trial.  
 
Accrual Tar gets (for n=21)  
Ethnic Category  Sex/Gender  
Females   Males   Total  
Hispanic or Latino  0 + 2 = 2 
Not Hispanic or Latino  6 + 13 = 19 
Ethnic Category: Total of all subjects  6 + 15 = 21 
Racial Category   
American Indian or Alaskan Native  0 + 0 = 0 
Asian  0 + 2 = 2 
Black or African American  0 + 0 = 0 
Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander  0 + 0 = 0 
White  6 + 13 = 19 
Racial Category: Total of all subjects  6 + 15 = 21 
 
13.3   Stratification Factors  
 
Not applicable in this study.  
 
13.4    Analysis of Results   
 
The outcome status (in terms of toxicity,  number of course begun,  amount of eribulin and 
gemcitabine received  (and percent of planned) , reason off treatment, tumor response,  and 
NCI Protocol #:  9653  
Version Date:  February 20, 2017  
 
51 progression /survival ) of all patients registered in this study, will be reporte d. All eligible patients 
who begin treatment will be included in the primary analysis of response and progression -free 
survival. All toxicities experienced by [CONTACT_25547].   
 
Toxicity .  All observed toxicities will be summ arized in terms of type (organ affected or 
laboratory determination such as absolute neutrophil count), severity (by [CONTACT_12397] v 4.0), and 
time of onset (i.e. course of treatment).  Tables will be created to summarize these toxicities and 
side effects, over all, by [CONTACT_410164]  – possibly by [CONTACT_431339], if numbers 
permit . 
 
Clinical Outcome .  The overall response rate will be calculated as the ratio of the number of 
eligible patients who experienced a confirmed CR or PR (by [CONTACT_393]  v1.1) divided by [CONTACT_431340] ; 90% confidence intervals will be constructed.  
A secondary estimate (more conservative) of the overall response rate will count in the 
numerator, only those patients who experienced a c onfirmed CR or PR AND  who received 2 or 
more doses of eribulin.  PFS will be measured from the start of treatment on Day 1, until 
progression, death, or the start of another treatment; patients who have not progressed, but who 
begin another treatment, will be censored at that time, for the measure of PFS.  This is a 
secondary endpoint , and will be summarized with a Kaplan -Meier plot and confidence intervals 
(at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months).   Overall survival will also be summarized in a manner similar to PFS.  
 
13.5    Reporting and Exclusions  
 
Evaluation of toxicity.   All toxicities experienced by [CONTACT_431341].   For purposes of applying the criteria to monitor 
toxicity /safety , only those patients who comp lete the first [ADDRESS_545676] be assessed for response to 
treatment, even if there are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are  ineligible.   Each 
patient will be assigned one of the following categories:  1) complete response, 2) partial 
response, 3) stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) 
early death from toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, 
insufficient data).    
 
All patients who met the eligibility criteria (with the exception of those who never received any 
protocol treatment ) will be included in the primary analysis of the response rate.   Patients in 
response categories 3-[ADDRESS_545677] 2 
doses of eribulin  and had disease reassessment after the 2nd course, or who had progressive 
disease prior to completing 2 courses .

52 14. CCCP POLICIES FOR MO NITORING CONSORTIUM TRIALS  
 
The protocol principal investi gator (PI) is responsible for monitoring the conduct and progress of 
this Phase I I trial, including the ongoing review of accrual, data and toxicities, as well as the 
accumulation of reported adverse events from other trials testing the same drug(s).  The 
participating clinicians and their designees are responsible for timely submission of adverse 
event reports (see Section 7.0) and case report forms.  The Data Coordinating Center for the 
CCCP Consortium is responsible for providing the PI [INVESTIGATOR_431327] e submitted case report 
form data in summary and detail in a timely fashion.   Although the PI [INVESTIGATOR_342884], it is the Data Coordin ating Center of the CCCP that distributes all 
submitted SAE reports to the appropriate individuals, including the local protocol principal 
investigators, at each of the participating institutions.   
 
The Data Coordinating Center posts a summary (accrual, t oxicities, and responses) of each 
CCCP initiated trial on the CCCP website.  In this way, each PI [INVESTIGATOR_25499] -to-date 
information on the status of his or her trial.  In consultation with the collaborating statistician, the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_431328]: 
 
(a) for Phase I trials, all dose limiting toxicities and decisions regarding dose escalation, 
expansion, as well as decisions to terminate escalation, and  
(b) for Phase II trials, the toxicities and therapeutic endpoints referred to in the statistic al 
plan.  
 
The Data Coordinating Committee meets monthly to review data management and data quality 
issues – completeness of data submissions as well as accuracy in terms of built -in, computerized 
logic checks.  Any issues identified and the corrective plan s are presented to the Internal 
Committee and at the next CCCP teleconference meeting for review and approval.  
 
14.[ADDRESS_545678] of CCCP trials occurs at several levels:  
 
1. The Data Coordinating Center for the CCCP flags all trials that are  approaching a 
decision in terms of toxicity (for both Phase I and Phase II trials) or responses (for Phase 
II trials).  Decisions are made by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_431329] ( U01 Cooperative Agreement or 
N01 Contract, as appropriate) or his or her designee, and are communicated to the 
participating centers by [CONTACT_431342]. At the monthly 
teleconferences, the accrual of each open protocol is reviewed.  
 
2. For C TEP sponsored Phase I trials, data are reported to the NCI -designated clinical 
trials monitoring service (CTMS) which will audit patients’ records on each protocol – at 
each CCCP institution; this audit is initiated by [CONTACT_472].   
 
3. An independent CCCP DSMC wil l review CCCP trials every [ADDRESS_545679] of 5 voting members ( 3 medical oncologists or hematologists involved in 
NCI Protocol #:  9653  
Version Date:  February 20, 2017  
 
53 Phase I/II cancer clinical trials but not participating in CCCP studies, a patient 
representative and a statistician) and a non-voting CCCP statistician.   
 
a. DSMC meetings will take place twice a year.  Addition al meetings will be 
convened if necessary.  
b. This DSMC will review each CCCP trial in terms o f accrual, toxicity/safety, 
and adherence to trial design, audit results, and likelihood of successful completion.   
c. The DSMC will report to the CCCP leadership.

Effects of intramuscular oxytocin on sensory function in healthy volunteers 
with ultraviolet burn injury to the skin
Informed Consent Form to Participate in Research

[INVESTIGATOR_128558] a research study. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the 
effects of oxytocin (naturally occurring hormone) given by [CONTACT_358739] (IM; into the 
muscle) injection, has on your nerves and tissues after exposure to a small amount of ultraviolent 
(UV- B) radiation (mild sunburn) on your skin. You are invited to be in this study because you 
are a healthy subject. Your participation in this research will involve 5 study visits. 
Participation in this study will involve receiving thermal heat testing, exposure to a small amount 
of UV- B radiation (a mild sunburn), vibratory sensory testing and IM administration of 
oxytocin.  All research studies involve some risks.  A risk to this study that you should be aware 
of is discomfort from the thermal/sensory/UV testing and IM injection.  There is not the 
possibility that you may benefit from participation in this study.  
Your participation in this study is voluntary.  You do not have to participate in this study if you 
do not want to.  This is not a treatment study and there are no additional choices. You will not 
lose any services, benefits, or rights you would normally have if you choose not to participate. 
The remainder of this form contains a more complete description of this study. Please read this 
description carefully. You can ask any questions if you need help deciding whether to join the 
study. The person in charge of this study is James C. Eisenach, M.D. If you have questions, 
suggestions, or concerns regarding this study or you want to withdraw from the study his/her

10/17/2019INTRODUCTION
You are invited to be in a research study. Research studies are designed to gain scientific 
knowledge that may help other people in the future. You are being asked to take part in this 
study because you are a healthy adult. Your participation is voluntary. Please take your time in 
making your decision as to whether or not you wish to participate. Ask your study doctor or the 
study staff to explain any words or information contained in this informed consent document that 
you do not understand. You may also discuss the study with your friends and family.
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?
The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effects of oxytocin given by [CONTACT_358740] (IM) injection, has on your nerves and tissues after exposure to a small amount of 
UV- B radiation (mild sunburn) on your skin. 
In this study oxytocin will be compared to placebo. A placebo is a substance, like a sugar pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], 
that is not thought to have any effect on your disease or condition. In this study you will receive 
the active study medication, oxytocin and the placebo which is not active, on different visits. 
Placebos are used in research studies to see if the drug being studied really does have an effect.
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THE STUDY?
We will enroll 10 people at this research site. In order to identify the 10 subjects needed, we may 
need to screen as many as 12 because some people will not qualify to be included in the study.
WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE STUDY?
You will have 5 visits to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) at Wake Forest Baptist Medical 
Center; study visit 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_447686] the following tests and procedures:
PROCEDURES
Vital Signs: we will monitor your blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation (amount 
of oxygen in your blood).  
Laboratory Testing: female participants of child-bearing potential will have a urine 
pregnancy to determine that they are not pregnant. 
Thermal Heat Testing: we will train you to accurately describe pain from a small (about the 
size of a penny) and a large (about the size of a half dollar) probe. The tip of the heat probe that 
will be applied to the skin on your forearm is about the size of a penny.  The tip of the heat probe 
that will be applied to your calf is about the size of a half dollar. The thermal heat probe will be

temperature up to a temperature that is hot (122 ºF) and uncomfortable, but does not burn your 
skin.
Vibratory/Sensory Testing: Oscillatory motion can be termed as the repeated motion in 
which an object repeats the same movement over and over.
UV-B Testing: we will expose small areas of your skin to a light that will give you a mild 
sunburn in small areas (about the size of a dime).
Intramuscular injection of Oxytocin: we will give you an injection of oxytocin or placebo 
into the muscle in your arm.  
Study Visit 1
You will report to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) or Pi[INVESTIGATOR_343304] 2. You will review and 
sign the Informed Consent. After informed consent is adequately obtained, a detailed medical 
history will be obtained. During this visit we will measure your blood pressure, heart rate, and 
we will place a clip on your finger which will measure the oxygen in your blood. Female 
participants of child-bearing potential will provide a urine sample for a pregnancy test. We will 
perform thermal heat training by [CONTACT_358741] 100°F to 122 °F 
with a 5 second presentation of varying temperatures to your forearm. We will ask you to rate 
each stimuli using an 11 point numerical verbal scale (NRS) anchored at [ADDRESS_447687] a slightly larger probe on your 
lateral calf and warm the area to a temperature of 113F for [ADDRESS_447688] with filaments (similar to a paint brush 
bristle) and have you tell us when they become sharp or prickly.
Finally, we will place the inside of your wrist on a device that will vibrate. We will ask you to 
tell us when you first feel the vibration or sensation. We will then expose three areas on your calf 
to the UV-B light; the areas will be about the size of a dime and will produce a small area of 
redness.

your calf and warm the area to a temperature of 113F for [ADDRESS_447691] on the arm that was 
exposed to the UV burn and we will ask you to rate the sensation you feel in the area of the UV 
burn when we touch you with different filaments (similar to a paint brush bristle).
After the baseline measurements have been completed we will apply the smaller thermal probe to 
the area on your wrist where the UV burn is, and heat the area to a temperature of 104F for 5 
minutes.  During this five minute warming period we will ask you to give a pain rating each 
minute for any pain you are experiencing. Immediately after this heating we will give you an 
injection into your arm of oxytocin or placebo.  We will repeat the vibration/sensory testing  on 
your wrist 4 more times, the filament testing 3 more times, the 113F temperature for 5 minutes 
(on the calf) 2 additional times, and the 104F temperature for 5 minutes (on the wrist) [ADDRESS_447692] the slightly larger thermal

10/17/2019we are studying include:
Heat Probe 
You may experience brief pain during the thermal heat testing.
Vibratory Testing
You may experience a mild vibration in fingers/hand/forearm.
UV-B
UV radiation causes mild sunburn, and may blister or hurt for a few days.  The sunburned skin 
will almost always tan in normal individuals, and may tan more darkly than the surrounding skin 
for several weeks to several months. It is possible that the darker patches of skin may be present 
on your legs for up to a year. Long-term darkening (discoloration) or scarring is possible, but 
rare in people with normal skin and a history of normal tanning.
Oxytocin
Oxytocin is approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for use in the dose and route 
of administration we are using. We will monitor you for many theoretical problems such as 
changes in your blood pressure, how fast your heart is beating, and your urge to breathe. We will 
treat any side effects that you may experience if the changes are enough to concern us.
There is the possibility of a feeling of being flushed (warm feeling), headache and increased 
heart rate with no significant change in blood pressure during or immediately after the injection. 
These events have been reported by [CONTACT_10132] a previous study of oxytocin administration. 
The events were short lived, lasting approximately 12-[ADDRESS_447695] use a reliable method of birth control while participating in this

intrauterine device (IUD), DepoProvera, tubal ligation, or vasectomy of the partner (with 
confirmed negative sperm counts) in a monogamous relationship (same partner). An acceptable, 
although less reliable, method involves the careful use of condoms and spermicidal foam or gel 
and/or a cervical cap or sponge. We encourage you to discuss this issue further with your

Title 
Phase Ib /II Study of Pembrolizumab with Lanreotide  Depot  for Gastroenteropa ncreatic 
Neuroendocrine Tumors (PLANET)  
Objectives  
The primary objective is : 
1. To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) by [CONTACT_119549]  (RECIST) version 1 .1 to pemb rolizumab in combination with lanreotide d epot in 
subjects with progressive, advanced or metastatic gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine 
tumors (GEP -NETs ). 
The secondary objectives are:  
1. To assess the safety of pem brolizumab in combination with l anreotide d epot in subjects 
with GEP -NETs.  
2. To assess progression free s urvival (PFS) of pem brolizumab in combination with 
lanreotide d epot in subjects with GEP -NETs. 
3. To assess the overall survival (OS) of pem brolizumab in combination with lanreotide d epot 
in subjects with GEP -NETs. 
4. To evalua te the ORR  by [CONTACT_119541] -Related Response Criteria (irRC) to pembrolizumab in 
combination with lanreotide depot in subjects with progre ssive, advanced or metastatic 
GEP -NETs . 
The exploratory objectives are:  
1. To characterize c hanges in circulating immune cells in subjects with GEP -NETs treated 
with pembrolizumab in combination with lanreotide  depot .  
2. To determine whether safety and efficacy param eters (ORR , PFS, OS) correlate with PD -
L1 expression within the tumor in pre -treatm ent specimens . 
3. To explore the  correlation between blood -based biomarkers and clinical outcomes.  
Patient Population  
Patients must have a non-resectable, recurrent, or metastatic well or moderately differentiated 
gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumo r (GEP -NETs) with at least one measurable 
lesion of the disease on imaging and evidence of radiological tumor progression within the last 
12 months.  
Study Design  
The study will be conducted in two stages: 1) Safety Run-In and 2) Expanded Cohort.  
Safety  Run-In:  The first stage will include a safety run-in of 6 patients treated with

1.0 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
Neuroendocrine tumors of the gastro intestinal (GI) tract and pancreas (GEP -NETs) are generally 
indolent tumors which are nonetheless lethal once they become metastatic (1,2). Treatments include 
surgery, ablative procedures including embolization for liver metastases, systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_744105] (mTOR) or the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors 
(3).  For patients with symptoms associated with hormone hypersecretion in neuroendocrine tumors, 
somatostatin analogues (SSA) are generally used (4).  Fu rthermore, recent studies suggest 
somatostatin analogues also have antitumor effects (5,6).  For example, the CLARINET study 
demonstrated that first -line treatment with Lanreotide Autogel/Depot, a somatostatin analogue (SSA), 
significantly prolonged progre ssion free survival (PFS) among patients with metastatic nonfunctioning, 
somatostatin receptor -positive enteropancreatic NETs of grade 1 or 2 (Ki -67 <10%) (6). However, 
patients ultimately have progression of disease, indicating the need for additional the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_744106]. Because immune cells have been demonstrated to infiltrate neuroendocrine tumors (7), 
one class of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_744107]. Indeed, 
while the anti -proliferative effects are likely direct effects mediated through the somatostatin receptors, 
somatostatin analogues such as lanreotide also may have immunomodulatory effects as somatostatin 
receptors are present on human lymphocytes and monocytes (8).  Interferon alpha also has  been used 
to treat neuroendocrine tumors with anti -tumor benefit similar to that of the somatostatin analogues (9).  
It is not known whether interferon is acting through immune mechanisms or other anti -proliferative or 
anti-angiogenic mechanisms. Interfer on and lanreotide have been tested as a combination which was 
tolerable, but did not yield additive benefits; however, because the immunomodulatory molecules PD -
[ADDRESS_1017674] been identified within neuroendocrine carcinomas (10), we hypothesize that a 
combination of an immunotherapy (anti -PD-1 antibody) with a different mechanism of action when 
combined with lanreotide will have greater anti -tumor activity.  
1.2 Study Drugs  
1.2.1  Pembrolizumab  
The programmed cell death 1 (PD -1) pathway represents a major immune control switch, which may 
be engaged by [CONTACT_108652] T -cell immune surveillance. Pembrolizumab 
(KEYTRUDA®, MK -3475) is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of 
the immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD -1 
and its ligants, programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD -L1) and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD -L2). 
This blockade enhances functional activity of the target lymphocytes to facilitate tumor regression and 
ultimately immune rejection.  
[COMPANY_006], Sharp & Dohme Corporation, a subsidiary of [COMPANY_006] & Co., Inc. ([COMPANY_006]), is studying 
pembrolizumab for various oncology indications. Overall, as of [ADDRESS_1017675] been 
exposed to pembrolizumab in [COMPANY_006] sponsored clinical trials (approximately 6713 subjects received 
pembrolizumab monotherapy, approximately 876 subjects received pembrolizumab in combination w ith 
one or more other chemotherapy or biologic agents, and approximately 2244 subjects received 
comparator treatment alone). As of the various data cutoff dates for the  KEYTRUDA®  Investigator

ongoing, Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials sponsored by [CONTACT_44873].  
On 04 -Sep-2014 the [LOCATION_002] (US) Food and Drug Administrat ion (FDA) granted accelerated 
approval to KEYTRUDA® for treatment of patients with advanced or unresectable melanoma who are 
no longer responding to other drugs. KEYTRUDA® is the first approved drug that blocks PD -1. 
KEYTRUDA® is intended for use following  treatment with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_445645] (IPI), a type of immunotherapy. 
For melanoma patients whose tumors express a gene mutation called BRAF V600, KEYTRUDA® is 
intended for use after treatment with IPI [INVESTIGATOR_1238] a BRAF inhibitor, a therapy that blocks activity of BRAF 
gene  mutations. The recommended dose of KEYTRUDA® is 2 mg/kg administered as an intravenous 
(IV) infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks (Q3W).  
On 22 -Jul-2015 the European Commission (EC) approved KEYTRUDA® for the treatment of advanced 
(unresectable or metasta tic) melanoma in adults. The EC approval of KEYTRUDA® was based on data 
from 3 clinical studies (KEYNOTE [KN]001, KN002, and KN006) conducted in more than 1,[ADDRESS_1017677] -line 
and previously -treated patients with advanced melanoma. KEYTRUDA® received EC regula tory 
approval based on Phase [ADDRESS_1017678] of care for 
advanced melanoma. This approval allowed mark eting of KEYTRUDA® in all 28 EU member states at 
the approved dose of 2 mg/kg Q3W. With the EC decision, KEYTRUDA® is now approved in more than 
[ADDRESS_1017679]-2015 the US FDA granted accelerated approval for KEYTRUDA® to treat patients with 
advanced (metastatic) non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has progressed after other 
treatments ans with tumors that express a protein called PD -L1. KEYTRUDA® is approved for use with 
a companion diagnostic, th e PD -L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx test, the first test designed to detect PD -L1 
expression in non -small cell lung tumors. The FDA -approved dose of KEYTRUDA® is 2 mg/kg Q3W.  
On 18 -Dec-2015, the US FDA expanded the label to include the approval of KEYTRUDA® for the 
treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. This expansion now includes the initial 
treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with pembrolizumab. The FDA -
approved dose of KEYTRUDA® is 2 mg/kg Q3W . 
On 02 -Aug-2016 the EC approved KEYTRUDA® for patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
NSCLC, at a dose of 2 mg/kg Q3W, in patients whose tumors express PD -L1 and who have received 
at least [ADDRESS_1017680] received approved therapy for these mutations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA®. The EC 
approval allows marketing of KEYTRUDA® in all 28 EU member states. The approval is based on 
findings from KN010, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_647253]® signi ficantly improved overall survival 
(OS) compared to standard of care chemotherapy.  
On 05 -Aug-2016 the US FDA approved KEYTRUDA®, at a fixed dose of 200 mg Q3W, for the treatment 
of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  (HNSCC) with disease 
progression on or after platinum -containing chemotherapy. Under the FDA’s accelerated approval 
regulations, this indication for KEYTRUDA® is approved based on tumor response rate and durability 
of response. For HNSCC patients, PD -L1 testing is not needed prior to use of KEYTRUDA®. The FDA -
approved dose of KEYTRUDA® is [ADDRESS_1017681] -growing clinical development program for KEYTRUDA® both as

[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background  
The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformati on has 
been known for decades. Accumulating evidence shows a correlation between tumor -infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in various malignancies.  In particular, the 
presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T -cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells seems to 
correlate with improved prognosis and long -term survi val in many solid tumors.  
The PD -[ADDRESS_1017683] hijacked by [CONTACT_13207].  The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T -cells under healthy 
conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including autoimmune 
reactions.  PD -1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA -
4 which has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its 
ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD L2).  The structure of murine PD -1 has been resolved.  PD -1 and family 
members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable -type (V -type) domain 
responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is resp onsible for the binding of signaling 
molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor 
tyrosine -based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif (ITSM).  
Following T -cell s timulation, PD [ADDRESS_1017684] from that of CTLA -4 as both molecules 
regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_77971].  PD -1 was shown to be expressed on activated 
lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, B -cells, T regs and Natur al Killer cells.  
Expression has also been shown during thymic development on CD4 -CD8- (double negative) T -cells 
as well as subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells.  The ligands for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are 
constitutively expressed or can be induced i n a variety of cell types, including non -hematopoietic tissu es 
as well as in various tumors .  Both ligands are type I transmembrane receptors containing both IgV - 
and IgC -like domains in the extracellular region and contain short cytoplasmic regions with n o known 
signaling motifs.  Binding of either PD -[ADDRESS_1017685] ion in 
peripheral tissues.  Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD -L1, a variety of cancers were 
demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T -cell inhibitor.  PD -1 has been suggested to regulate 
tumor -specific T -cell expansion in subjects with melanoma (MEL).  This suggests that the PD -1/PD -L1 
pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion and should be considered as an attractive target 
for therapeutic intervention.  
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal  antibody (mAb) of the

Non-Clinical Toxicology Summary  
In the 1 -month and 6 -month toxicology study in cynomologus monkeys, pembrolizumab, intravenously 
administered once a week and once every other week respectively up to a dose of 200mg/kg, resulted 
in no adver se treatment -related effects. In tissue cross -reactivity studies of pembrolizumab in human 
and monkey tissues, the expected on -target staining of mononuclear leukocytes membranes was 
demonstrated in both species. Off -target cross -reactivity staining was al so noted in both species but 
was limited to the cytoplasm of various cell types/tissues and the stroma (extracellular connective tissue 
matrix), and was considered related to experimental methodological artifacts, i.e. tissue processing for 
IHC, which are well recognized limitations of tissue cross -reactivity studies and, thus not considered 
toxicologically relevant.  
There was no impact seen on male or female fertility based on evaluation of the Cynomolgus monkeys 
used in the [ADDRESS_1017686], 
no reproductive or developmental toxicity studies were conducted with pembrolizumab. Therefore , 
inclusion of women of childbearing potential in clinical trials should be in accordance with the study 
protocol and applicable regulatory guidance (e.g., ICH M3(R2): Nonclinical Safety Studies for the 
Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Author ization for Pharmaceuticals).  
Clinical Trial Summary  
As of the data cutoff dates for Version 11 (01 -Sep-2016) of the Pembrolizumab Investigator’s Brochure, 
pembrolizumab monotherapy and combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_622426] 
9833 sub jects, with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, in [COMPANY_006] sponsored trials.  
Clinical Pharmacology  
The PK profile of pembrolizumab, with low clearance and limited volume of distribution, is typi[INVESTIGATOR_647255]. Exposure to pembrolizumab  is approximately linear in the dose range of clinical 
relevance (1 to 10 mg/kg and at 200 mg). Furthermore, pembrolizumab has a low potential fo eliciting 
the formation of ADAs.  
Efficacy  
For this Pembrolizumab IB (Version 11, 01 -Sep-2016), efficacy data a re available for a total fo 1572 
melanoma subjects treated with pembrolizumab in KN001, KN002, and KN006; 1529 subjects with 
NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab in KN001 and KN010; and [ADDRESS_1017687] -in-human study conducted to evaluate clinical activity of 
pembrolizumab as a single agent in two cancers, melanoma and NSCLC. The ORR demonstrated the 
antitumor activity of pembrolizumab in subjects with melanoma (ipi[INVESTIGATOR_445645] -naïve and previously 
treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_445645]).  
PLANET Protocol Version 5.0                          PI: [INVESTIGATOR_744104]_ 07Sept2021  CONFIDENTIAL                                                                       Page 14 of 68                                                                            
 KN002 was a randomized Phase 2 study comparing two doses of pembrolizumab to investigator’s 
choice chemotherapy in subjects with unresectable or metastatic (advanced) melanoma, who had 
progressed after prior treat ment with IPI [INVESTIGATOR_647256] (and/or MEK) inhibitor in subjects with BRAF -mutant 
melanoma. The study demonstrated superior PFS for both pembrolizumab treatment arms compared 
to the chemotherapy control arm. Treatment with pembrolizumab led to an ORR that was >[ADDRESS_1017688] whether pembrolizumab was superior 
to IPI [INVESTIGATOR_647257] -primary efficacy en dpoints of PFS and OS in IPI -naïve subjects with unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma. This study demonstrated statisticaly significant improvements in OS and PFS for 
subjects randomized to pembrolizumab compared to subjects randomized to IPI. In the 10 mg/ kg 
treatment groups (Q2W and Q3W), 185 subjects experienced objective responses that ranged from 1.4 
months to 8.2 months in duration.  
KN010 was a randomized, adaptively designed Phase 2/[ADDRESS_1017689] progressed after multiple prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Profile  
Pembrolizumab is safe and well tolerated, as evidenced by a low rate of toxicity Grade 3 to 5 drug -
related AEs (13.8%), discontinuations due to AEs (11.9%), and deaths due to drug -related AEs (3.9%). 
Furthermore, the frequency of immune -mediated adverse reactions (AEOSIs) is low, and these events 
are readily managed in the clinical setting.  
The safety and efficacy data generated to date provide a favorable benefit -risk assessment for the use 
of pembrolizumab as a treatment for subjects with advanced/metastatic melanoma, NSCLC, and 
HNSCC.  
There are no specific safety concerns based on the result s of nonclinical studies. Pembrolizumab has 
the same mechanism of action as other anti -PD-[ADDRESS_1017690] in 
cancer subjects.  
Pembrolizumab is generally well -tolerated and demonstrates a favorable safety profile in comparison 
to chemotherapy. Pembrolizumab is an immunomodulatory agent, and based on this mechanism of 
action, immune -mediated AEs are of primary concern. The important identified risks for pembrolizumab 
are of an immune -mediated nature, and include the following: pneumonitis; colitis; hepatitis; nephritis; 
endocrinopat hies that include hypophysitis (including hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_647258]), thyroid disorder (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism) and Type 1 diabetes mellitus; uveitis; 
myositis; Guillain -Barré syndrome; pancreatitis; and severe skin react ions. Information on the nature 
and frequency of these identified risks is included in the Reference Safety Information of Version 11 of 
PLANET Protocol Version 5.0                          PI: [INVESTIGATOR_744104]_ 07Sept2021  CONFIDENTIAL                                                                       Page 15 of 68                                                                            
 the Investigator’s Brochure. The majority of immune -mediated adverse events were mild to moderate 
in severity, manageab le with appropriate care, and rarely required discontinuation of therapy.  
In addition, two important potential risks have been identified, although the data available thus far for 
these events does not provide sufficient evidence of a causal relationship t o pembrolizumab. The two 
important potential risks are: a) myasthenic syndrome, and b) an increased risk of severe complications 
(such as early severe graft versus host disease and venoocclusive disease) of allogenic transplant in 
patients with hematologic  malignancies who have previously been treated with PD -[ADDRESS_1017691] data on these potential risks in order to further characterize 
their potential relationship to pembrolizumab.  
Further details regarding report ing and management of immune -related AEs (irAEs) in general are 
described below.  
In addition to the immune -related risks noted above, infusion -related reactions are also an important 
identified risk for pembrolizumab; however, they are not considered immun e-mediated. Information 
regarding the nature and frequency of infusion -related reactions is included in the Reference Safety 
Information in Version 11 of the Investigator’s Brochure.  
Immune -Related Adverse Events  
Based on the mechanism of action of pembrol izumab and similar immunomodulatory agents, the 
Sponsor is interested in all potential irAEs, and encourages appropriate investigation of signs and 
symptoms suggestive of these.  
Consultation with the appropriate medical specialist should be considered whe n investigating a possible 
irAE. These events can occur after the first dose to several months after the last dose of treatment. Mild 
irAEs are usually treated symptomatically and infrequently require dosing delays or discontinuation. 
Higher grade and pers istent lower grade irAEs typi[INVESTIGATOR_647259] (such as tumor 
necrosis factor blockers), when systemic steroids are not effective. Early recogn ition of irAEs and 
initiation of treatment are critical to reduce the risk of complications, since the majority of irAEs are 
reversible with the use of steroids and other immune suppressants.

 cont. Table [IP_ADDRESS].1 All A EOSI Adverse Reactions Considered Expected for Pembrolizumab 
(Presented by [CONTACT_647298])  
 
Nephritis : Five additional cases of the AEOSI nephritis were observed in the Reference Safety Dataset; 
however, they are not contained in t he preceeding table because the reported AE coding at the time 
did not include an AEOSI nephritis term. The coding for each of these 5 cases has since been updated 
after the data -lock of the Reference Safety Dataset as follows, and each of the terms below is 
considered an AEOSI adverse reaction expected for pembrolizumab:  
 Tubulointerstitial nephritis: n=2 (in addition to 4 cases already included in above table), for an 
overall frequency of n=6 (0.2%)  
 Nephritis: n=2 (0.1%)  
 Autoimmune nephritis: n=1 (0%)  
Therefore, based on the addition of the above 5 cases, the overall frequency for the AEOSI nephritis in 
the Reference Safety Dataset should be n=9 (0.3%)  
Colitis : One event in the Reference Safety Dataset was initially counted as an AEOSI of colitis. 
However, it was later determined that the subject did not have colitis, and had been included in the 
Reference Safety Dataset summary of colitis due to data entry errors. Therefore, the overall frequency 
of the AEOSI colitis should be n=48 (1.7%), and the frequency  for the individual event of colitits should 
be n=45 (1.6%)  

PLANET Protocol Version 5.0                          PI: [INVESTIGATOR_744104]_ 07Sept2021  CONFIDENTIAL                                                                       Page 19 of 68                                                                            
 Infusion -Related Reactions : One subject had an event of anaphylactoid reaction that was not counted 
as an infustion -related reaction since this term was not part of the terms list for the AEOSI in fusion -
related reactions at the time  of reporting. Therefore, the incidence of AEOSI infusion -related reactions 
in the Referense Safety Dataset should be n=71 (2.5%). The term “anaphylactoid reaction” (n=1 [0%]) 
is considered an AEOSI expected for pembroli zumab.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Selection  
PN001  is being conducted to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of single agent pembrolizumab .  
The dose escalation portion of this trial evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, 
administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors.  All three dose levels were 
well tolerated and no dose -limiting toxicities were observed.  This first in human study  of pembrolizumab  
showed evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels 
(1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W).  No MTD has been identified to date.  10.0 mg/kg Q2W, the 
highest dose tested in PN001, will be th e dose and schedule utilized in Cohorts A, B, C and D of this 
protocol to test for initial tumor activity.  Recent data from other clinical studies within the pembrolizumab  
program has shown that a lower dose of pembrolizumab  and a less frequent schedule m ay be sufficient 
for target engagement and clinical activity.  
PK data analysis of pembrolizumab  administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic clearance, 
limited volume of distribution, and a long half -life (refer to IB).  Pharmacodynamic data (IL -2 release  

PLANET Protocol Version 5.0                          PI: [INVESTIGATOR_744104]_ 07Sept2021  CONFIDENTIAL                                                                       Page 20 of 68                                                                            
 assay) suggested that peripheral target engagement is durable (>21 days).  This early PK and 
pharmacodynamic data provides scientific rationale for testing a Q2W and Q3W dosing schedule.   
A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed using ser um concentration time data from 
[ADDRESS_1017693] a wide therapeutic range based on the melanoma indication.  
The differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg Q3W body weight 
based regimen are anticipated to remain well within the established exposure margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for 
pembrolizumab  in the melanoma indication. The exposure ma rgins are based on the notion of similar 
efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e. 
5-fold higher dose and exposure). The population PK evaluation revealed that there was no significant 
impact of tumo r burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between the NSCLC and 
melanoma indications. Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in exposure between different 
indication settings.  
The rationale for further exploration of 2 mg/kg and comparab le doses of pembrolizumab in solid tumors 
is based on: 1) similar efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab when dosed at either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg 
Q3W in melanoma patients, 2) the flat exposure -response relationships of pembrolizumab for both 
efficacy and saf ety in the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q3W, 3) the lack of effect of tumor 
burden or indication on distribution behavior of pembrolizumab (as assessed by [CONTACT_499422]) and 4) the assumption that the dynamics of pembrolizumab target en gagement will not vary 
meaningfully with tumor type.  
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is based on 
simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed dose of 
200 mg e very 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent with those obtained with 
the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in the exposure range 
established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy re sponse and 3) will maintain individual 
patients exposure in the exposure range established in melanoma that are well tolerated and safe.  
A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians and to 
reduce potential for  dosing errors.  A fixed dosing scheme will also reduce complexity in the logistical 
chain at treatment facilities and reduce wastage.  
1.2.2 Lanreotide Depot  
Lanreotide is an octapeptide analogue of somatostatin.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Back ground  
Lanreotide is a well -established peptide analogue of the natural hormone somatostatin, in which the 
biochemical stability of the peptide has been increased by [CONTACT_744123]. Like 
native somatostatin, lanreotide inhibits the s ecretion of many hormones (including GH), and has anti -
proliferative activity. Somatostatin is a peptide naturally produced by [CONTACT_744124]. Somatostatin produced by [CONTACT_744125][INVESTIGATOR_744109] e 
synthesis and release of GH and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Therefore, in diseases involving 
increases of GH, such as acromegaly and some cancers, somatostatin has a use in inhibiting GH 
production. Somatostatin produced by [CONTACT_744126] 5.0                          PI: [INVESTIGATOR_744104]_ 07Sept2021  CONFIDENTIAL                                                                       Page [ADDRESS_1017694] been developed for medicinal use. Lanreotide is a 
synthetic octapeptide with a biological activity similar to naturally occurring somatostatin. The compound 
is character ised by [CONTACT_46917] D -Tryptophan in the amino acid ring, increasing stability, and by [CONTACT_46918] D -beta Nal outside of this ring, which increases its selectivity. The terminal amine function 
reduces binding to central nervous system (CNS) receptor s. Lanreotide exhibits high affinity for the 
somatostatin Type 2 (SSTR2) and Type 5 (SSTR5) receptors found in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_304], GH secreting 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_44079], NETs and the digestive tract. The product has a much lower affinity for somatostatin 
Type 1, 3 and 4 receptors.  
Lanreotide has been developed in the following formulations:  
 Immediate release  
 Microparticle prolonged release (lanreotide PR 30 and 60 mg)  
 Lanreotide Autogel 60, 90 and 120 mg  
Marketing authorisation has been granted for lanreotide MPF (indicated for the treatment of acromegaly, 
NETs, and also for thyrotropic adenoma and digestive fistulae in some countries), and for lanreotide 
Autogel formulation (indicated for acromegaly and NETs). The immediate release formulation (IRF) is 
not registe red. The lanreotide PR 30 mg (MPF) is administered by [CONTACT_33813] (i.m.) injection every 
7, [ADDRESS_1017695], Australasia, 
and North, Central and South America.  
Lanreotide depot for i njection is  available as 60 mg/0.2 mL, 90 mg/0.3 mL, and 120 mg/0.5 mL single -
use prefilled syringes  
Lanreotide depot injection is a somatostatin analog indicated for: 1) the long -term treatment of 
acromegalic patients who have had aninadequate response to or cannot be treated with surgery 
and/orradiotherapy; and 2) the treatment of patients with unresectable, well -or moderately -
differentiated, locally advanced or metastatic gastroenteropancreaticneuroendocrine tumors (GEP -
NETs) to improve progression -free survival.

Non-Clinical Toxicology Summary  
PLANET Protocol Version 5.0                          PI: [INVESTIGATOR_744104]_ 07Sept2021  CONFIDENTIAL                                                                       Page [ADDRESS_1017696] been assessed based on plasma lanreotide concentrations in anima ls compared 
with humans after administration of lanreotide Autogel 120 mg (1.7 mg/kg based on a body weight of 
70 kg).  
The toxicity of lanreotide was extensively studied in rodents and dogs and no acute or chronic toxicity 
hazard was detected. Repeated sub cutaneous injection of lanreotide Autogel for up to 26 weeks in rats 
and up to 39 weeks in dogs did not cause systemic target organ toxicity at plasma concentrations of 
approximately 200 - to 400 -fold (rats) and 16 - to 23 -fold (dogs), the exposure observed after 
administration of lanreotide Autogel 120 mg to humans. Chronic administration of lanreotide produced 
a reduction in growth rate (decreased body weight gain, decreased weight of some organs) in rats and 
dogs and gallbladder dilatation in dogs which we re considered related to the pharmacological activity 
of the product.  
The effects on the GI tract of animals were similar to those in humans. No overt signs of pancreatic or 
gallbladder toxicity were observed in the chronic toxicity studies in rats and dog s. 
In standard tests, lanreotide showed no tendency to cause damage to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). 
Two-year rodent carcinogenicity studies of lanreotide administered once daily by [CONTACT_744127] e achieving 12 - to 30 -fold (at 10 mg/kg/day 
in mice) and 2.5 - to 2.7 -fold (at the highest dose tested of 0.5 mg/kg/day in rats) the human plasma 
concentration after administration of the MRHD of 120 mg. An increase in neoplastic changes with 
lanreotide com pared to controls was observed at the injection sites for doses of approximately 20 - and 
90-fold (mice) and 1.8 -fold (rats) the human plasma level at the MRHD. The neoplastic changes 
observed at the injection site of rodents were probably caused by [CONTACT_7419] -term irritation of the 
subcutaneous tissue rather than damage to DNA and are not considered a cause for concern with 
regard to the safe use of lanreotide Autogel in patients.  
Reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits showed that lanreotide did not in terfere with normal 
embryonic development in pregnant animals despi[INVESTIGATOR_744110]. There was a tendency to reduce female fertility but only at doses that 
reduced body weight gain. At these  doses this effect is an expected outcome of inhibition of GH 
secretion. The fertility of males was unaffected by [CONTACT_744128] 2 subsequent generations were unaffected by [CONTACT_744129] t o the parents 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_744111] 1 of its metabolites in the maternal milk.  
The local tolerance of lanreotide Autogel after chronic subcutaneous injection in rats and dogs revealed 
the presence of nodules at the injection sit e after each administration. The histopathological changes 
(granulomatous inflammation and/or fibrosis) observed at the injection site following lanreotide Autogel 
administration appear to be a normal reaction of the subcutaneous tissue to the presence of a foreign 
body.  
Studies with lanreotide Autogel or IRF indicate that lanreotide is not harmful to the immune system of 
animals. Lanreotide causes less stimulation to the immune system of humans than in rats and dogs. 
Toxicology studies of the impurities p resent in lanreotide Autogel were conducted using high doses 
compared to those intended for human use. No safety concerns were identified during these studies.  
Based upon the pharmacology, PK, safety pharmacology and toxicology studies (including 
cardiovas cular tolerance), lanreotide Autogel is considered to be safe for chronic use in humans.  
Clinical Trial Summary

 In terms of NET, the main effects of lanreotide are reducing carcinoid syndrome symptoms associated 
with NET and tumor stabilization. As of May 14, 2014 (Lanreotide IB Version 14.0), the main efficacy 
parameters used to assess the effect of lanreotide in NET studies were the number of symptom 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (mainly diarrhoea and flushing) and PFS. Reductions in tumor biomarkers have also been 
observed i n patients with NET.  
The efficacy of lanreotide Autogel (60, 90 and 120 mg) in the treatment of symptoms associated with 
carcinoid NET was investigated in an open, multicentre, dose titration clinical study (Study 718).  
Lanreotide Autogel was administered  by [CONTACT_744130] 4 -week intervals for 6 months 
to assess the relief of clinical symptoms in patients diagnosed with symptomatic carcinoid NET. 
Seventy -one patients were treated and included in the ITT population, 35 were included in the P er 
Protocol (PP) population, and [ADDRESS_1017697] troubleso me to each patient and this became the 
“target symp tom”. A response was defined as a reduction of ≥50% in the mean daily number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_744112] (i.e., the number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_744113]) compared with baseline. Symptom assessments w ere recorded in patient diaries. 
The response rate was approximately 40%.  
The secondary efficacy analyses included an evaluation of the efficacy of lanreotide Autogel in the relief 
of clinical symptoms (diarrhoea and/or flushing) after each month of treatm ent. The changes from 
baseline for both flushing and diarrhoea were clinically and statistically significant for each month 
(Months 1 to 6). In Study 166, 9/30 patients had NET -related symptoms at baseline; after lanreotide 
treatment, symptoms were totally  controlled in [ADDRESS_1017698] (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid 
Tumors). In this study, lanreotide Autogel provided good symptomatic control of diarrhoea and flushing 
in patients with malignant carcinoid syndrome.  
Another phase III study (Study 726) has been completed, which investigated the effect of lanreotide 
Autogel 120 mg on PFS in patients with well - or moderately well -differentiated, non -functioning entero -
pancreatic, neuroendocrine tumors.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Profile  
The safety results from NET studies were similar to those from acromegaly studies. The most common 
treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were GI disorders, including diarrhea  and abdominal  pain. 
Other common TEAEs were asthenia, fatigue, headache, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, nausea, anorexia, 
cholelithiasis, flatulence, intestinal obstruction, injection site pain, back pain, hyperglycaemia and 
dizziness.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Selection  
According to prescribing information (revised date 12/2004), the recommended dose of lanreotide depot 
is 120 mg administered every 4 weeks by [CONTACT_447049]. There is no recommended dose 
adjustment for mild or moderate renal impairment. There is insufficient information to recommend a 
dose for patients with severe renal impairment or with hepatic impairment of any severity.  However, in 
order to match the lanreotide dosing to the dosing of pembrolizumab (every 3 weeks), a dose of 90mg

 administer ed every 3 weeks (same dose intensity as the 120mg every 4 week dose) by [CONTACT_744131].  
1.3  Study Rationale  
In the proposed study, we aim to study the combination of pembrolizumab with lanreotide depot (the  
formulation available in the US) in patients with unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic GEP -NETs, who 
have had progression in the prior 12 months in order to establish that full dose of each agent is tolerable 
in combination and to explore the clinical a ctivity of this combination on outcome measures including 
response rate, disease free survival/progression free survival, and overall survival, and we will also 
study the side effect profile of pembrolizumab in this setting.   Furthermore, in order to under stand the 
effect of pembrolizumab and lanreotide depot on immune parameters, we will explore the effect of this 
combination on circulating immune cells and determine correlations of clinical parameters with PD -L1 
expression in tumor.  
The response rate to l anreotide depot was not reported in the final publication of the CLARINET trial 
but in a prior study of lanreotide (9) one of 25 patients experienced a partial response to single agent 
and two of 28 patients experienced a response to interferon plus lanreo tide depot. In a more recent 
study, the response rate was 4% (11). Therefore, the response rate to lanreotide depot is likely to be 
10% or less. Further, this study may enroll patients who have previously progressed on somatostatin 
analogues so it is unlik ely that lanreotide depot alone will lead to clinical responses in these patients. 
The response rate to pembrolizumab for neuroendocrine tumors is not reported as there have been few 
patients with neuroendocrine tumors treated with pembrolizumab. Thus far,  the malignancies for which 
anti-PD-[ADDRESS_1017699] demonstrated greater than 10% 
response rates and in general, response rate of 20% or greater. With the projected number of 
participants (n=26), the difference b etween 10% and 25%  in the proportion of patients respon ding can 
be detected with adequate power . 
Because the immune profile (including regulatory T cells, myeloid derived suppressor cells, T cell 
subsets, dendritic cells) in the peripheral blood of neuroen docrine tumor patients in general and the 
immune response to anti -PD-[ADDRESS_1017700] not been well described, we 
will analyze these cell populations in the peripheral blood of patients on the clinical trial (12). Further, 
because the validity of PD -L1 as a biomarker of response to anti -PD-1 antibody therapy is still under 
evaluation and has been observed to be associated with outcome in some tumors but not others (13), 
we propose to correlate clinical responses (tumor regressi on) with PD -L1 expression within pre -
treatment tumor specimens.

to the original criteria and will be used for this study.   
Refer to Appendix A  for definition of target lesions, methods of me asurement and all other related 
criteri a for RECIST version 1.1. The following summarizes the definitions of the criteria used to  
determine objective tumo r response for target lesions :  
 Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
 Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum diameters.   
 Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the s um of diameters of target lesions, taking 
as reference  the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline  sum if that is the smallest on 
study). In addition to  the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate  an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm. (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also  considered 
progression).  
 Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for  PR nor sufficient increase to qualify 
for PD, taking as  reference the smallest sum  diameters  while on study.

6.2 Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab will be provided for this study by [CONTACT_44873] & Co ., a sterile, non -pyrogenic lyophilized 
powder for intravenous infusion supplied in single -use Type I glass vial containing [ADDRESS_1017732] is preservative -free, white to off -white powder and free from visible foreign  
matter.   It is reconstituted with 2.3 mL sterile water for injection (WFI) to yield a 2.4 mL solution 
containing 25 mg/mL of pembrol izuma b. The reconstituted vial contains an excess fill of 10 mg 
(equivalent to 0.4 mL of reconstituted solution) to ensure the recovery of label claim of 50 mg 
pembrolizumab  per vial (equivalent to 2 mL of reconstituted solution).  
6.2.1   Storage  and Handling  
Pembrolizumab Powder for Solution for Infusion vials should be stored at refrigerated conditions (2 – 8 
°C). Prior to r econstitution, the vial of lyophilized powder can be out of refrigeration (temperatures at or 
below 25°C (7 7°F) for up to 24 hours. Following reconstitution with sterile water for in jection, 
Pembrolizumab  infusion solutions should be prepared in 0.9% Sodiu m Chloride Injection, USP (normal 
saline) or regional equivalent and the final concentration of pembrolizumab in the infusion solutions 
should b e between 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL.  If normal saline is not available, 5% Dextrose Injection, 
USP or regional equiv alent (5% dextrose) is permissible.  T he preferred diluent is 0.9% Sodium Chloride 
and 5% dextrose is only permissible if normal saline is not available.  
Pembrolizumab solutions may be stored at room temperature for a cumulative time of up to [ADDRESS_1017733] solution in vials, room 
temperature storage of admixture solutions in the IV bags and the duration of infusion.   In addition, 
reconstituted vials and/or IV bags may be stored under refrigerat ion at 2 °C to 8 °C (36 °F to 46 °F) for 
up to 20 hours. If refrigerated, allow the vials and/or IV bags to come to room temperature prior to use.   
Refer to Pembrolizumab Pharmacy Manual  for additional drug product stability and handling guidelines.  
6.2.2  Administration  
Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered in an outpatient setting as a 30 min ute IV infusion on Days 
1 of each cycle  (+/-7 days for C2 and all subsequent cycles) .  Every effort  should be made  to target 
infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  However, given the variability of infusion 
pumps , a window of -5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 
min/+10 min).  
Refer to Pembrolizumab Pharmacy Manual specific instructions for the preparatio n of the 
pembrolizumab infusion fluid and administration of infusion solution.

9.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
9.1 General Analysis Considerations  
Percentage of PD -L1 + cells by [CONTACT_4658], the percentages of the lymphoid and myeloid cells in peripheral 
blood, and levels of th e cytokines/angiogenesis/inflammatory serum and plasma markers  will be listed 
and summarized using the descriptive statistics (minimum, maximum, mean median, std).  The PD -L1 
expression and peripheral blood lymphoid and myeloid cell percentages will be co rrelated with the 
response by [CONTACT_744139] [ADDRESS_1017742] based on the distribution and structure of the data (i.e., 
either parametric or non -paramet ric methods will be used depending on the measurement of the 
corresponding endpoints).  
A cohort of patients will be enrolled to assess the primary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR) in 
this patient population. A safety run -in will be conducted in th e first 6 patients enrolled.  A starting dose 
level (full, standard doses of each drug) is planned for this study . If one or fewer subjects meet 
discontinuation criteria, this dose level will be determined to be safe and the trial will continue . If 
disconti nuation criteria are met in  2/6 patients at the starting dose level, then the study will be 
redesigned. This study is expected to accrue a minimum of 6 evaluable subjects in the safety run-in 
portion of the study.  
9.1.1  Primary Endpoint  
Objective Respo nse Rate (ORR). CT or MRI scans and blood tumor markers will be repeated every two 
cycles.  Tumor response  defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)  will be assessed 
using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1. 1).   
ORR will be estimated by t he 90% Exact Lower Confidence Bound (LCB)  for the binomial proportion . 
An ORR of less than 10% will be considered not to be of clinical value, If the 90% LCB is >= 0.1 , the 
regimen will be considered efficacious . With 26 patients studied the LCB will be approximately 0.1 if 5 
responses are observed.  
If a sufficient number of responses are observed,  duration of response (DOR) will be summarized for 
subjects who achieve confirmed PR or CR using the Kaplan -Meier product -limit me thod. The median 
DOR (and two -sided 95% CI) will also be calculated. In addition, the percentage of responders still in 
response at different time points (3, 6 and 12 months) will be presented based on the KM plot.  
PLANET Protocol Version 5.0                          PI: [INVESTIGATOR_744104]_ 07Sept2021  CONFIDENTIAL                                                                       Page 46 of 68                                                                            
 The magnitude of reduction in tumor burde n will be summarized descriptively (such as a waterfall plot)  
based on change in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions relative to baseline . 
9.1.2  Secondary Endpoints  
PFS: defined as time from start of the treatment until documented disease p rogression or death from 
any cause (those for whom event of progression or death not observed will be censored  at the time of 
the last response assessment ). 
OS: defined as time from start of the treatment till the patient’s death from any cause (patient wh o are 
still alive at the end of the study will be censored).  
If sufficient events are observed, PFS and OS will be estimated by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier method.  
Safety and Tolerability  Monitoring : The safety and tolerability of Lanreotide Depot plus pembrolizumab 
will be primarily assessed by [CONTACT_251644] -related AEs leading to drug discontinuations during 
the first 12 weeks of treatment. The regimen will be considered safe if <33% of patients treated require 
dosing discontinuation for study drug related t oxicity  in the first 12 weeks (e.g., 0 of 3, ≤1 of 6, < 2 of 9, 
≤3 of 12 or ≤5 of 18 patients). This will be assessed continuously throughout the study.  A patient will be 
considered evaluable for safety if treated with at least one dose of study regimen . In addition, safety 
and tolerab ility will be analyzed by [CONTACT_20497], serious adverse events, and specific 
laboratory abnormalities (worst grade). Toxicities will be graded using the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCA E) version 4.0.  
Descriptive statistics (counts, percentages) will be used to summar ize safety parameters (adverse 
events, serious adverse events, adverse events leading to discontinuation, deaths) for all treated 
subjects.  Safety summaries will be present ed by [CONTACT_744140].  
9.1.3  Exploratory Endpoints  
Descriptive statistics (minimum, maximum, mean median, std)  will be provided for p ercentage of PD -
L1 + cells by [CONTACT_4658], the percentages of the lymphoid and  myeloid cells in peripheral blood, and levels of 
the cytokines/angiogenesis/inflammatory serum and plasma markers.   
For analysis of the immune monitoring data from the 2 polychromatic flow cytometry panels, we will 
perform initial analysis using statisti cal graphics (e.g. box -plots) of the cell subset relative frequencies 
and trend s over time. To assess the impact of cell subsets of interest (listed in Section 8.[ADDRESS_1017743] based on the distribution and structure of the 
data (i.e., either parametric or non -parametric methods will be used  as appropriate ). 
Given the limited sample size, all biomarker analyses will be considered exploratory.

 10.0 SAFETY  
Refer to  Study Manual  for required reporting forms.   
10.1 Adverse Event s 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to 
have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can theref ore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol -specified procedure, whether or 
not considered related to the medi cinal product or protocol -specified procedure.  Any worsening (i.e., 
any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is 
temporally associa ted with the use of the supporting company product (s), is als o an AE . 
Changes resulting from normal growth and development that do not vary significantly in frequency or 
severity from expected levels are no t to be considered AE s.  Examples of this may include, but are not 
limited to, teething, typi[INVESTIGATOR_744115] a physiologically appropriate time.  
Supporting company  product includes any pharmaceutical product, biological product, device, 
diagnostic agent or protocol -specified procedure, whether investi gational (including placebo or active 
comparator medication) or marketed, manufactured by, licensed by, prov ided by [CONTACT_647323].  
AEs may occur during  the course of the use of supporting company  product (s) in clini cal trials or within 
the follow -up period specified by [CONTACT_760], or prescribed in clinical practice, from overdose (whether 
accidental or intentional), from abuse and from withdrawal.  
Progression of the cancer under study is  not considered an AE  unless  it is consid ered to be drug related 
by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator.  
AEs will be documented  from the date of first dose of study drug through [ADDRESS_1017744]  be recorded on the CRF.  
10.2 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event ( SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occur rence that at any dose:  
1. Results in death.  
2. Is immediately life -threaten ing (ie,  in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2511] I nvestigator, the AE places the subject at 
immediate risk of death; it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death).  
3. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1666].  
4. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. (Note: The term “disability” refers to 
events that result in a substantial disruptio n of a subject’s ability to conduct normal life function.)  
5. Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.

 6. Is an important medical event (Note: The term “important medical event” refers to an event that, 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, may not be immedia tely life -threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of 
the other serious outcomes listed under the def inition of SAE. Examples of important medical 
events include intensive trea tment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; 
blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of product 
dependency or product abuse.)  
SAEs and/or foll ow up to SAEs including death due to any cause other than progression of the cancer 
under study , that occurs from the date of the first dose of study drug through [ADDRESS_1017745] 
dose of study drug , whether or not related to study drug(s) , must  be recorded on the CRF and must be 
reporte d within [ADDRESS_1017746] be followed until resolution, return to  baseline condition, or stabilization .  Any SAEs that 
are ongoing at the time the clinical database is closed will be reported to supporting companies  as 
unresolved.  
The initial report for each SAE or death should include at minimum the following informati on: 
 protocol number and title  
 patient initials, study identification number, sex, age  
 date the event occurred  
 description of the event  
 seriousness criteria  
 event causality or causal relationship  
 study drug name(s)  
 dose level and cycle number at the time th e event  occurred  
 description of the patient’s condition  
 study status of patient at time of report  
 responsible i nvestigator name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_647324] I nvestigator should report a diagnosis or a syndrome rather than individual signs or symptoms. The 
Investigator should also try to separate a primary AE  considered as the foremost untoward medical 
occurre nce from secondary AE s which occurred as complications. Whenever possible, t he Investigator

laboratory testing. *  
*NOTE :  These criteria are based upon avail able regulatory guidance documents. The 
purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an 
additional evaluation for an underlying etiology.  
10.3.1  Medication Overdose and Error  
For purposes of this trial, an o verdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 1,000 mg or 
greater (≥5 times the indicated dose).  No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose 
of pembrolizumab. Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinicall y indicated.  In the 
event of overdose, the subject should be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive 
treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  
If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of st udy drug(s), the adverse 
event(s) is reported as a SAE, even if no other seriousness criteria are met. Refer to SAE reporting 
procedures in Section 10.2 . 
If a dose of pembrolizumab meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without any associated 
clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non -serious ECI, using 
the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.” Refer to ECI reporting 
procedure s.

Accordingly, source documents include, but are not limited to, laboratory reports ( including normal and 
abnormal results), radiology reports , subject diaries, biopsy reports, ultrasound photographs, subject 
progress notes, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_744119].  
Whenever  possible, the original recording of an observation should be retained as the source document; 
however, a photocopy is acceptable provided that it  is a clear, legible, and exact duplication of the 
original certified document.   
When clinical observations are entered directl y into an electronic medical record system (i.e. in lieu of 
original hardcopy records),  the electronic record can serve as the s ource document if the system has 
must be validated to meet the FDA requirements for ele ctronic records and signatures (i.e. meets 21 
CFR Part 11  compliant).   
Regulations require that Investigators maintain information in the study subject’s medical  records  which 
corroborate data recorde d on the CRF.  In order to comply with these regulatory requirements, the 
following information will be maintained and made ava ilable as required by [CONTACT_95702]  [INVESTIGATOR_1461] (s), 
monitors, and/or regulatory inspectors:

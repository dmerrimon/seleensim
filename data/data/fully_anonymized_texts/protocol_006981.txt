Abstract  
We will conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2269] (RCT) study. One hundred inmates with OUD 
releasing from WA State prisons to community corrections supervision in King County, WA will be 
enrolled (the county has a population of 2 million residents out o f a state population of 7 million). 
Half of the subjects will receive treatment as usual, for instance outpatient drug counseling, and 
half will receive 6 months of intervention. The aims of this study are to determine: 1) whether study 
procedures can be i mplemented with fidelity, 2) whether offenders can be enrolled and maintained 
in the study, 3) which medications/treatment options subjects select and their experiences and 
satisfaction with the interventions, and 4) preliminary intervention effect size on  outcomes of 
interest including recidivism, drug use, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and treatment enrollment and retention.  
Introduction  
One-third of heroin users are incarcerated each year primarily due to criminal activity related to 
their drug use and “ policy changes and interventions are urgently needed to reduce the negative 
consequences of opi[INVESTIGATOR_772087] -entry” (Fox et al., 2015) . The number of heroin users 
and the number dying from opi[INVESTIGATOR_772088] 
U.S. while pharmaceutical opi[INVESTIGATOR_113843] a common pathway into heroin and a persistent overdose 
risk (Jones et al., 2015; Peavy et al., 2012) .   
The time shortly after release from prison is a period of greatly increased risk for fatal opi[INVESTIGATOR_46229] (Binswanger et al., 2013; Merrall et al., 2010) . Opi[INVESTIGATOR_772089] (MAT) reducing criminal activity, re cidivism, improving

v03-20-2017   Page 2 of 19 functioning, decreasing mortality and transmission of infectious diseases like HIV and HCV, and 
substantially reducing costs (Clark et al., 2011; MacArthur et al., 2012; Nolan et al., 2014; Nordlund 
et al., 2004; Tkacz et al., 2014; Tsui et al., 2014; Wh ite et al., 2014) . A major challenge in breaking 
the cycle of addiction and criminality and related morbidity and mortality is seamlessly getting 
people onto MAT as they leave incarceration. This is a matter of simultaneously building interest in 
treatm ent among newly released inmates and increasing and facilitating access to ongoing services.  
Great interest in this topic has been expressed locally as indicated by [CONTACT_293601] 2016 release of 
Washington State’s Interagency Opi[INVESTIGATOR_772090] , co-authored by [CONTACT_6283]. Banta -Green and Fotinos, 
collaborators on this project. A main strategy in the Workplan is to “Optimize access to chemical 
dependency treatment services for offenders who have been released from prison into the 
community…”i. Numerous challenges exist to providing effective services to releasing prison 
inmates with OUD, including: 1) identification of the population at risk, 2) inmates’ often modest 
knowledge and misperceptions of MAT as well as limited  motivation and self -efficacy for  accessing  
treatment, 3) lack of continuity of care between the relatively protected prison environment and 
effective services in the community and 4) maintaining ongoing utilization of MAT to support 
recovery and reduced consequences related to opi[INVESTIGATOR_173668] e.  
This innovation initiative, based on evidence -based practices, will develop, implement, and assess 
the feasibility of procedures to provide effective services for offenders with OUD releasing from WA 
DOC prisons. We will aim to facilitate linkage to on going MAT in the community following release 
from custody beginning with an initial intervention aimed to educate inmates so they can make 
informed decisions regarding medication options.  
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has markedly increased eligibility for  health insurance coverage for 
releasing offenders, such that a very high proportion of offenders releasing from WA DOC prisons 
qualify for Medicaid coverage. Since 2014, WA DOC has launched an effort to enroll as many 
releasing offenders as possible into Medicaid coverage effective at the time of release resulting in a 
substantial majority of inmates obtaining Medicaid coverage. We are fortunate that WA HCA 
(Medicaid) has undertaken several initiatives to promote better integration of healthcare services 
including integrating medical, mental health, and substance use disorder treatment that should 
facilitate this study and support sustainability long term (see letter of support).  
The crux of this innovation initiative is building motivation and self -efficac y for and ready access to 
adequate coordinated care for releasing offenders with OUD to initiate and maintain MAT. Given 
that MAT has the best evidence base for effective treatment of OUD, facilitating access to MAT 
(accompanied by [CONTACT_772129] a s appropriate) will be the major thrust of the initiative. 
Our intention is to make appropriate treatment (buprenorphine, methadone, and long -acting -
naltrexone) available, with the particular treatment approach selected on a case -by-case basis by 
[CONTACT_772130]. We will be working with community based partners who will be 
providing MAT including, but not limited to [CONTACT_772148], co -investigator and Evergreen Treatment 
Services (see letter of support). These partners will be responsible for all  medical and related care

Potential Subjects Identified  
Recruitment, baseline interviews, and some follow -up interviews (if convenient for the subject) will 
take place in community corrections offices (CCOs) throughout King County. We will concentrate 
initially on offices in Seattle  and South King County . Department of Corrections (DOC) will run 
weekly reports on inmates for upcoming releases to King County CCO facilities. DOC will n otify CCO 
staff that a potential subject will be released to that facility. Once released, we will approach, 
recruit and enroll them during their first visit at the community corrections office and randomize to 
treatment as usual or intervention.  
Obtain I nformed Consent  
Written informed consent will be obtained from all subjects who wish to participate in the study. 
Subjects will also be asked to complete HIPAA authorization agreements for treatment and medical 
records information and other secondary data sources.  
Eligibility Screening  
Subjects will be men or women aged [ADDRESS_1060024] mild severity for Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition ( DSM -5) criteria for diagnosis for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (e.g. 
 
Treatment Navigation for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_71081]  
v03-20-2017   Page 6 of 19 opi[INVESTIGATOR_9825]). Subjects will be asked to complete an eligibility screening questionnaire. The 
items covered are general demographics , proximity to the research settings, drug us e questions, 
and DSM [ADDRESS_1060025].  
 
 
Baseline Assessments  
Eligible subjects will undergo baseline assessments and provide information on personal 
information and health:  
1) Opi[INVESTIGATOR_772092]. This assessment captures opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], overdose 
history, past treatment and feelings about future treatment.  
2) Education, Employment, Income and Housing: This assessment captures other demographic 
information related to subject’s resources and social stability.  
3) Overdose Risk Assessment: This assessment is  used to determine the potential for future 
overdose based on prior overdose history, current drug use practices and social context for 
current drug use. This assessment is not standardized but is compi[INVESTIGATOR_772093].  
4) World Health Organization Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test 
(WHO -ASSIST v.3). This is a multi -item tool to determine areas of substance use and misuse. 
This assessment battery screens for recent and lifetime use of a variet y of substances, 
including illicit drugs, alcohol, pharmaceuticals and tobacco products.  
5) EQ-5D-3L: This validated quality of life measure asks about problems in mobility, self -care, 
usual activities, pain and discomfort, anxiety and depression and overall health.  
Locator information:  
Subjects will be asked to provide a number of sources to ensure they can be contact[CONTACT_51095] -up 
visits. However, because we anticipate a number of subjects to have unstable housing, subjects may 
be enrolled if they provide at least one primary source of locator information.  
Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized to receive either standard of care or the study intervention. We will 
recruit equal numbers of subjects in the intervention and control arms of the study.  
Follow -up Visits  
Follow -up visits will occur at 1and 6 months after enrollment. Interviews will be by [CONTACT_14379] -
person . Assessments given at the baseline interview will be repeated at each follow -up point. In 
 
Treatment Navigation for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_71081]  
v03-20-2017   Page 7 of 19 addition to the assessments subjects will be asked q uestions in the intervention arm about how 
well the treatment  navigation process is working.  
 
 
Secondary Data Sources  
Secondary data on health care and drug treatment utilization will be obtained from Washington 
State (separate IRB action pending) using th e following sources:  
 Division of Behavioral Health and Recovery (DBHR) data for drug treatment admissions 
data (formerly TARGET)  and King County Behavioral Health and Recovery Division   
 The Comprehensive Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_772094] (CHARS) for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614]  
 Criminal History data extracted from Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) and 
Department of Corrections (DOC) by [CONTACT_772132] (WSIPP)  
 Emergency Department Information Exchange data for emergency department visits 
administered by [CONTACT_772133].  
In the event of a subject death during the study we will request information on cause of death from 
the King County Medical Examiner’s Office or Vital Records from Washington Department of Health. 
If we are unable to locate a subject during the course of the study or at final follow -up we will utilize 
the King County Jail Inmate Look -up Service. At no time will subjects be contact[CONTACT_772134].  
Intervention Description  
Subjects in the intervention arm will additionally begin a discussion with the interventionist about 
whether they are interested in treatment and medication choices for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2537]. The 
interventionist, called a Trea tment Navigator, will use a decision tool based on the SAMSHA guide 
to medication assisted treatment in order to help make an informed decision about treatment 
choices. A treatment decision may be made during the baseline visit or at some later visit. Once  a 
decision is reached, the Treatment Navigator will meet with the subject periodically to assist with 
entering treatment and help with locating other social services as needed within the community. 
The meetings are neither structured nor scripted and the subjects will determine the agenda based 
on their areas of concern. The Treatment Navigator will, however, emphasize getting into 
treatment as quickly as possible once a decision is made. The Treatment Navigator and the subject 
will determine the schedule of meetings and will continue throughout the 6 month study period, 
with more visits anticipated at the start of participation, and fewer visits anticipated at the end.  See 
Appendix A for the Treatment Decision Making Guide.

v03-20-2017   Page 8 of 19 Study Medication  
The medication, naloxone, is being used for an indicated condition, opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211]. The specific 
formulation of Naloxone we will use is Narcan® nasal spray, 4mg naloxone hydrochloride from 
ADAPT Pharma.  
At usual doses, naloxone is relatively free of adver se effects. Because the duration of action of 
naloxone may be shorter than that of the narcotic being reversed, patients being treated for opi[INVESTIGATOR_772095].   
Administration of naloxone to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -dependent patients may provoke an acute withdrawal 
syndrome (including body aches, diarrhea, tachycardia, fever, runny nose, sneezing, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2657], 
sweating, yawning, nausea or vomiting, nervousne ss, restlessness or irritability, shivering or 
trembling, abdominal cramps, weakness, and increased blood pressure). Withdrawal reaction are 
not life threatening. Agitation and paresthesia have been infrequently reported with the 
postoperative use of nalox one hydrochloride injection.  
Hypersensitivity reactions, such as allergic reactions, are theoretically possible, but have never been 
documented with naloxone.  We will ask about allergic reactions to naloxone during the baseline 
interview and at each of th e three follow up interviews. Any allergic reactions will be reported to 
the University of Washington’s human subjects division.  
Subjects will be educated about withdrawal reactions. The overdose intervention training and all 
education materials will clea rly and strongly encourage calling [ADDRESS_1060026] clinical 
and research expertise relevant to the study.  They are not directly involved in study procedures. 
They will meet during the period of study planning, one month and 4 months after the study is 
initiated.  The committee will receive reports on the progress of the study prior to the meeting, 
including the number and characteristics of subjects and those who declined to participate.  Any 
serious adverse events (SAE) will be discussed with the committee to determine if the risks of SAE 
could be modified by [CONTACT_772135].  Other reports will be provided as the 
committee requests. Committee membership will be determined prior to study initiation.  
Drug a ccountability  
Study medication will be ordered and prescribed by [INVESTIGATOR_204994] -Ross Pharmacy in Seattle. Upon receipt, 
the investigator is responsible for taking inventory of the investigational agent. A record of this 
inventory will be kept and usage will be docu mented. Any unused or expi[INVESTIGATOR_772096].  
Adverse event reporting   
The risks expected from trials employing behavioral interventions are presumed minimal and the 
medication being prescribed for possible future use is designed to be used to prevent a fatal 
overdose with side effects being rare. However, given the nature of  ongoing drug and/or 
medication use the population studied in this trial is possibly at risk for an overdose.  Adverse 
events (AEs) will be categorized as serious or non -serious, as related or not related to the study, and 
as expected or unexpected. An AE is defined as any reaction, side effect, or untoward event that 
occurs during the course of the clinical trial. Stable chronic conditions, such as substance abuse, 
which are present prior to clinical trial entry and do not worsen, are not considered AEs. C ommon, 
minor ailments and complaints will be excluded from any type of documentation. These may 
include: colds, flu’s, cuts, scrapes, coughs, headaches, stomach complaints, and general fatigue.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) are defined as any fatal event,  any immediately life threatening 
event, any permanent or substantially disabling event, any event that requires or prolongs inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly or birth defect, or any event requiring intervention to prevent 
any of the previously  listed serious events. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_772097]’s (e.g. emergency room visit for a non - study -related injury that does not result in 
admittance). Normal childbirth and pre -planned elective procedures are not considered SAEs. 
AE/SAE’s will be elicited by [CONTACT_364337]/research interviewers at each assessment visit by [CONTACT_772136] 
(using the Adverse Events Worksheet).   
Disclosure of an AE/SAE may also occur in an unsolicited manner to a research or clinical staff 
member. The interviewers should be focused on gathering data to aid in determining study 
relatedness. Study -relatedness will be determined by [CONTACT_772137][INVESTIGATOR_71081]  
v03-20-2017   Page 10 of 19 the investigators. All AEs and SAEs will be recorded in the AE/SAE log and entered into the secured 
project database. AEs that are not study related do not require any further paperwork 
documentation besides the AE Log. In this  study, potential AEs that may be related to the study 
would be an increase in emotional distress in relation to discussion of past or current drug use 
behaviors or side effects of naloxone.   
University of Washington Adverse Events reporting requirements  
The term adverse event is generally used to refer to any untoward or unfavorable medical 
occurrence in a human subject, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam 
or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject's participation 
in the research, whether or not considered related to the subject's participation in the research. 
Adverse events encompass both physical and psychological harms. They occur most commonly in 
the context of biomedical research al though, on occasion, they can occur in the context of social 
and behavioral research.  
Unanticipated problems, in general, include any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of 
the following criteria:  
1. unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or fr equency) given (a) the research procedures 
that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research 
protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject 
population being studied;  
2. related or there  is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may 
have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]; and  
3. suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, e conomic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
The adverse event report form is to be used to report an adverse event where there is a reasonable 
probability that the event was attributable to a study procedure. The UW IRB defines reason able 
probability as "more likely than not" - that is, there is a greater than 50% likelihood of the event 
having been caused or partially caused by [CONTACT_772138].  
Per HSD policy the form is required to be submitted as soon as possible but no later than [ADDRESS_1060027] database. Data are backed up ni ghtly so there is minimal risk of data loss. Any edits to 
previously saved data are fully tracked in an electronic audit table and include the date/time stamp 
 
Treatment Navigation for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_71081]  
v03-20-2017   Page 11 of 19 and user ID of the person making the edit. Ongoing data monitoring will be the responsibility of the 
research coordinator.  
Confidentiality  
We will obtain a federal Certificate of Confidentiality (CoC), protecting participants against 
disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., drug use). The Department of Health and Human Services 
(HHS) office that iss ues the CoC will be advised of any changes in the CoC application information.  
Participant records will be kept confidential by [CONTACT_772139], secure separate storage of any documents that hav e participant identifiers, 
and secure computing procedures for entering and transferring electronic data.  
Study monitoring  
The monitoring of study records will be conducted on a regular basis by [CONTACT_23164]. 
The purpose of these visits is to e ncourage and assess regulatory compliance and to document the 
integrity of the trial progress. Monitoring activity will assure that submitted data are accurate and in 
agreement with source documentation and will also review regulatory/essential documents s uch as 
correspondence with the IRB. Areas of particular concern will be participant informed consent, 
protocol adherence, safety monitoring, IRB reviews and approvals, regulatory documents, participant 
records, study drug accountability, and principal inve stigator supervision and involvement in the trial. 
The research coordinator will ensure that staff are trained and able to conduct the protocol 
appropriately and that study procedures are properly followed. If additional training of study 
personnel is need ed, project staff will undertake or arrange for that training.  
Data monitoring  
Study data will be entered by [CONTACT_772140], study specific 
laptop computers.  Data will be captured using the REDCap  electronic data capture system which 
uses a secure connection to local REDCap servers located at ITHS. Only authorized users will be 
allowed access to the data entry system and no identifiable data will be entered into REDCap. 
Research staff will use pass word protected UW works for data entry.  
Data completion will be verified when study interviews are completed. Baseline data and study arm 
assignment will be captured by [CONTACT_772141].  Data 
will be managed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_67880], who will access study data 
from desktop computers connected via local area network to computer servers that are in a locked 
room in a locked office suite at the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute (ADAI). S imilarly, follow -up 
interview data will be entered directly into password protected, study specific laptop computers 
using REDCap, with data uploaded to servers at ADAI weekly.   
Health services and cost data will be obtained, cleaned and made into analyti c data sets by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Sears. Data will be transferred securely and stored on ADAI servers which are backed up nightly. 
The research coordinator will be responsible for the integrity of all study data and will prepare

interventions without supervision.  
Data Analysis  Plan  
Analyses will allow us to evaluate the aims of this study: 1) whether study procedures can be 
implemented with fidelity, 2) whether offenders ca n be enrolled and maintained in the study, 3) 
which medications/treatment options subjects select and their experiences and satisfaction with 
the interventions and 4) preliminary intervention effect size on outcomes of interest including 
recidivism, drug u se, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and treatment enrollment and retention. The number of 
subjects is not intended to be adequate to test the impact of the intervention, but rather to provide 
sufficient numbers of subjects to assess the feasibility of both research study  procedures and 
intervention components.  
The number and proportion of subjects retained at each step of the study will be documented and 
reported in a CONSRT diagram similar to the one in the Appendix for our current RCT. Baseline 
characteristics will be compared for each study arm to ensure rand omization was properly 
implemented. Bi -variate test statistics of differences in outcomes of interest will be compared by 
[CONTACT_772142]. Study analyses will begin prior  to study completion due to 
the fact that this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -feasibility trial and data will be used to determine if a full randomized 
trial is appropriate and what modifications to the study design are needed, this is different than 
procedures for a full RCT where analyses would await and complete, closed dataset. Data  will be 
used to determine the possible treatment effect sizes which will allow sample size estimates to be 
calculated for a future full scale randomized controlled trial.

Introduction  
 I’d like to share with you some information about treatment options and support you in making a 
decision about what types of treatments you would like to try. This will involve:  
1. describing what opi[INVESTIGATOR_772099]  
2. compare treatment options  
3. asking you some questions about your preferences for treatment  
4. providing you feedback about the tradeoffs, pluses and minuses, of treatment options you are 
interested in  
5. if you are interested in treatment we’ll work on a plan to get you started including finding a 
treatment provider if you are interested in a medication   
After today, I will continue to be available to work with you for six months to talk through how 
treatm ent is going, if you’d like to try a different type of treatment , and help you get  back on treatment 
if you stop.

v03-20-2017   Page 15 of 19 1. What is opi[INVESTIGATOR_772101]?  
To understand  opi[INVESTIGATOR_772101], it is helpful to look at the difference  between physical dependence 
on opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573] s and opi[INVESTIGATOR_772101]:  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_772102] : A physical condition in which the body gets used to  the amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573] s taken . 
This happens whether a person take pain pi[INVESTIGATOR_772103], Percocet or OxyContin or heroin. The body 
adapts by [CONTACT_772144][INVESTIGATOR_2573] s to feel the same effect (tolerance) and feeling terrible  (withdrawal) 
when opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573] s are reduce d or removed. This is normal and happens to anyone who takes opi[INVESTIGATOR_772104].  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_772105]. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_772106] 1) physically dependent on opi[INVESTIGATOR_772107] a 2) person’s thinking, and 3) relationships and ability to function.  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_772108] a chronic, relapsing medical condition,  meaning it lasts a long time and can keep 
coming back,  much like diabetes and high blood pressure . It can also be managed very well with 
medication and supportive services.  A person can be on treatment medications and be in recovery.  
Why might  opi[INVESTIGATOR_772109]? 
People releasing from pri son or jail are at very high risk for using opi[INVESTIGATOR_772110] . 
If not treated  opi[INVESTIGATOR_772111], social and psychological harm - both to the 
person with the disorder and others in their life . People with opia te use disorder are at increased risk for 
HIV, hepatitis , other serious health problems,  and dying from an overdose.

Three types of treatments may be combined, or you  may choose to do nothing at this point.  
 Watchful waiting , do nothing right now, but observe how you are feeling and what you are doing. 
Notice if you a re having cravings  or start using  opi[INVESTIGATOR_772112].  
1. Social support  such as organized groups  like narcotics anonymous  or smart re covery . Joining 
another social support group run by [CONTACT_772145].  
2. Professional counseling . Getting one on one counseling from a social worker, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], or chemical 
dependency professional.  
3. Treatment medicat ions  including methadone, buprenorphine/Suboxone, or long -acting -
naltrexone/Vivitrol.  
o Methadone  is an opi[INVESTIGATOR_772113] 24 hours and that is take n by 
[CONTACT_1966] . It is dispen sed at a methadone clinic (also called an opi[INVESTIGATOR_772114]) . At 
these programs most days you will be observed while you take your dose. You will also have 
regular urine drug testing as well as counseling. Methadone is a full opi[INVESTIGATOR_772115].

  RATIONALE   
The objectives of the study are to assess the effectiveness, duration of 
symptom relief, improvements on activity level and safety of one or 
more hylan G -F 20 injections for symptomatic early knee 
osteoarthritis (OA) tr eatment in younger, active patients over a three -
year period.   
•From a pain management perspective, reduction of knee pain knee 
pain will target a Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS)  
•Repeated hylan G -F [ADDRESS_820059] udy use of viscosupplementation for young 
individuals who are active.  Synvisc One injections, which are a single 
injection,  will be used to determine effectiveness of reducing pain and 
maintaining an active healthy lifestyle for younger patients aged 30 -
50 ye ars old.  
  
This study , for research purposes only, will  be an open label 
longitudinal cohort study with natural history over 3 years.  Subjects 
Protocol U CSF-SYNVISC-1 Confidential 
 
Version #001  Version Date: 5.17.[ADDRESS_820060], and 3 -day 
accelerometer data.  Subjects will receive a single 6 mL intra -articular 
injection of hylan G -F 20 in the target knee at baseline.  All ongoing 
treatments will be monitored at 6-month  intervals over the 3-year 
duration of the study.   Patients can receive any other conservative 
treatments (e.g., oral medications, physical or other therapy, 
acupuncture, etc., except other injection treatments) and current 
treatments will be documented during each patient encounter.  An 
initial injectio n of hylan G -F [ADDRESS_820061] 4 months following their previous 
injection and they meet the inclusion criteria  for pain levels on the 
following  WOMAC questions A1 (How much pain have you had 
walking on a flat surface?) , C8 (How much difficulty have you had 
going down the stairs?) , C9 (How much difficulty have you had when 
going up the stairs?) , C10 (How much difficulty have you had  when 
getting up from a sitting position?) and/or C23  (How much difficulty 
have you had while doing heavy household chores?) . Inclusion criteria 
for pain level is defined by [CONTACT_617521], severe, or extreme on 
all questions  A1, C8, C9, C10 and/or C23 . Those subjects who select 
mild or no pain levels on any of A1, C8, C9, C10 and/or C23 , will not 
meet the criteria for WOMAC pain level and retreatment.  Patients 
requiring three injections of hylan G -F [ADDRESS_820062] injection.  Otherwise, patients will be followed until they 
reach the 3-year follow up, or drop out for other injection treatments 
or surgical treatment.  Therefore, patients would potentially be able to 
receive up to 9 injections during the 3-year study . 
 
  PRIMARY 
OBJECTIVE S  
Specific Aim 1:  To identify whether injection of 6 mL hylan G -F 20 
decreases pain over 26 weeks in young (ages 30 to 50 years) active 
patients with symptomatic primary osteoarthritis of the knee not 
treated previously with hylan G -F 20.

(e.g., oral medications, physical or other therapy, acupuncture, etc., 
except other injection treatments) and current treatments will be 
documented during each patient en counter.

directly into the knee joint, it does not interfere with any medicine 
that your physician recommends, including pain relievers and anti -
inflammatory drugs.  
 
  EFFICACY 
EVALUAT IONS  Efficacy will be measured a nd evaluated using data from the 
following assessments : KOOS, Lysholm, SF -12, WOMAC, and 
Accelerometer  ™.

consistent with other similar studies (Tubach 2005, Bellamy 2010).  
The pr imary endpoint is defined as non -inferiority of the proportion of 
responders in our study relative to an external criterion for the 
responder proportion (Bellamy 2010).   
 
SECONDARY 
ENDPOINTS   
Survival analysis statistics will be performed to assess durati on of 
benefit from the hylan G -F [ADDRESS_820073] -treatment in a ctivity 
levels (using objective activity measures utilizing accelerometer and 
Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale) and quality of life scores 
(WOMAC, SF -12) will be determined. We will examine the time 
courses of longitudinal measures of pain score, activity  level, and 
quality of life over the entire three -year span of the study.  
 
SAFETY 
EVALUATIONS   
The repeat treatment phase evaluated the safety profile of a second 
injection of Synvisc -One. One hundred and sixty patients were treated 
during this phase of t he study, of which 77 patients received a second 
injection of Synvisc -One. These patients were followed for 4 weeks 
and out of 77 patients, only 4 (5.2%) experienced device -related AEs 
in the injected knee. All such events were mild to moderate and were 
treated symptomatically. Patients who developed injected knee AEs 
during the initial phase of the study, and who subsequently received 
repeat treatment, did not experience injected knee AEs upon repeat 
exposure to Synvisc -One.

ANALYSES   
There is no interim analysis planned. Serious adverse events will be

Version #001  Version Date: 5.17.[ADDRESS_820074] Knee Pain scores ≤ 3 on a 0 -10 pain scale, which is a threshold 
consistent with other similar studies (Tubach 2005, Bellamy 2010).    
The primary endpoint is defined as non -inferiority of the proportion of 
responders in our study relative to an external criterion for the 
responder proportion (Bellamy 2010).  Bellamy demonstrated in his 
paper from 2007 (table 3) that a B LISS response at any time during 
the study was achieved in 70% receiving appropriate care and Hylan 
G-F 20 and only in 38% of patients receiving appropriate care 
(P<0.0001).   We propose a non -inferiority delta of 20% relative to 
this external criterion, a nd thus the primary endpoint will be tested by 
a test of our sample proportion (p) with null hypothesis H0: p<0.50 
vs. alternative hypothesis H1: p >0.50. This test will be performed 
using the Wilson -Agresti method for testing a single binomial 
proportion a t a one -sided significance level of 0.025 (i.e. non -
inferiority will be satisfied if the 95% Wilson -Agresti (REF BROWN 
ET AL 2001) interval for the proportion of responders excludes the 
null rate of 0.50).  
 
STATISICS  
Secondary Endpoints   
For subsequent in jections, duration of response over time and median 
duration of response will be estimated using survival analysis 
techniques.   Inference for activity levels and quality of life will focus 
on changes from baseline to 3 months.   We will examine the time 
course for the longitudinal data on pain score, activity level, and 
quality of life measures across the three years of the study using 
mixed effects models.  
 
Rationale for Number 
of Subjects   
Power Calculation  
 Bellamy demonstrated in his paper from 2007 (table 3) that a BLISS 
response at any time during the study was achieved in 70% receiving 
appropriate care and Hylan G -F 20 and only in 38% of patients 
receiving appropriate care (P<0.0001).   A power calculation using a 
one-sample comparison of proportio n with hypothesized value sample 
size was performed to determine non -inferiority to the 70% results 
quoted by [CONTACT_617522]. Power calculations were measured using 
STATA’s SAMPSI calculator.  If we postulate a 20% non -inferiority 
limit (i.e. that at least 50% of  patients receiving G -F 20 will achieve a 
BLISS response), the sample size required to have 90% power and  
Protocol U CSF-SYNVISC-1 Confidential 
 
Version #001  Version Date: 5.17.12 Page 14 of 45 
  
∝=0.025 to show non -inferiority at 50% would be 70.  For a 10% 
non-inferiority limit with 90% power and ∝=0.025, the required 
sample size is 274, an d for 15% non -inferiority limit with 90% power 
and ∝=0.025, it is 124 patients.  These numbers do not allow for 
dropouts, therefore, we intend to recruit 150 subjects to account for 
dropout.  
Conservatively assuming a 20% rate of drop -out, the resulting sam ple 
size of n=120 has better than 90% power (one sided test with 
∝=0.025) to show non -inferiority assuming the true responder rate is 
65% (i.e. not quite as high as the 70% external reference).

chondrocyte metabolism and recent clinical studies [Ann Rheum Dis. 2004 May ; 
63(5):478-82; Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2005 Mar;13(3):216-24] provide support for a 
disease-modifying effect of Hylan G-F 20 therapy.   An evaluation of the non-clinical tests

There were no unresolved safety issues.   
1.[ADDRESS_820076] worsening of limitations in activities.2  In one study 
48.7% of limitations (n= 405) participants with knee symptoms were classified as 
experiencing a poor two-year outcome using a dichotomous outcome measure of 
activity.3  Prognostic factors for worsening of limitations in activities include increased 
pain, reduced ROM, and decreased muscle strength at 1-year follow-up; higher morbidity 
co
unt; and to a lesser extent poor cognitive functioning.   Continuing exercise is 
important, as there are numerous health benefits for reducing chronic diseases such as 
hypertension, diabetes and obesity.  While osteoarthritis is also a chronic disease, it is 
focal in nature whereas lack of exercise can result in increased incidence of systemic 
chronic diseases that have more detrimental health effects and health care costs.5  A single 
injection preparation of hylan G-F 20 (6 mL) has shown improvement over placebo in a 
double blind randomized control trial.1  Hylan G-F 20 has demonstrated improvements 
with repeated treatment of knee osteoarthritis using a series of three 2 mL preparations4; 
however, the effectiveness of repeated injections of the 6 mL is not yet known.   
Maintaining activity levels and pain tolerance are important in the younger age group as 
this translates to continuing good mobility and ability to work.   
A randomized, double-blind, saline-controlled, multicenter trial of 253 patients (mean age 
63 years) with moderate to severe OA knee pain. Most had radiographically confirmed 
Kellgren-Lawrence grade II or III OA at baseline. Patients initially received arthrocentesis 
and then either one 6-mL injection of Synvisc-One or one 6-mL injection of placebo 
(saline). Follow-up visits occurred at weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 26. The primary end point 
Protocol U CSF-SYNVISC-1 Confidential 
 
Version #001  Version Date: 5.17.12 Page 16 of 45 
 was the difference between the groups in the change from baseline in patient-assessed 
pain as measured by [CONTACT_617525] A score (average of 5 questions) over 26 weeks. A 
responder was defined as a patient with a ≥1 category improvement in WOMAC question 
A1 and no knee-related adverse events. The safety of repeat treatment (week 26) with 
Synvisc-One was assessed in all patients over a 4-week period. Acetaminophen rescue 
was permitted up to [ADDRESS_820077] any fluid removed (this procedure is called arthrocentesis [pronounced AR-
thro-sen- TEE-sis]) once a week for three weeks. Patients improved after SYNVISC 
treatment, but not more than patients who had arthrocentesis. This study was different 
from the German studies because the last time the two groups were compared was only 
two weeks after the last SYNVISC injection. The study was also different in other ways, 
including length of time that patients had to stop taking medicines before they could start 
treatment. The length of time patients had to stop taking medicines was two weeks in the 
German studies and, four weeks in the U.S. study. 
[ADDRESS_820078] possible negative side effects and short durations of symptom 
improvement.  Hylan G-F 20 in a single injection form can provide analgesic benefit and 
can be used as a treatment in younger patients not improving with traditional treatments. 
This study is for research purposes only.  
RISK / BENEFIT ASSESSMENT 
Young patients with osteoarthritis are typi[INVESTIGATOR_617513].  Randomized 
control trials for arthroscopy in arthritis patients do not show long term benefits.  Patients 
want conservative treatment with low side effect profiles which can improve their quality 
of life. Hylan G-F [ADDRESS_820079] better exercise tolerance with less 
pain. As shown in medical studies of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the

 knee, where approximately half received a single injection of SYNVISC and the other half 
either had fluid removed from the knee and/or received injections of the same volume of 
salt water (a “Saline Control” injection), the major benefits of SYNVISC are pain relief 
and improvement in other symptoms related to OA of the knee. 
 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
2.1 Primary Objective 
There are two primary objectives to this study:  
Specific Aim 1:  To identify whether injection of 6 mL hylan G-F 20 decreases pain over 
26 weeks in young (ages 30 to 50 years) active patients with symptomatic primary 
osteoarthritis of the knee not treated previously with hylan G-F 20.  
Specific Aim 2:  Though symptoms can be improved for periods up to [ADDRESS_820080] of repeated treatments of hylan G-F 20 will be studied. 
2.2 Secondary Objectives 
There are two secondary objectives to this study:  
Specific Aim 3:  To identify the effects of treatment with hylan G-F 20 on activity levels 
(using objective activity measures utilizing accelerometer and Physical Activity 
Enjoyment Scale (PACES)) and quality of life scores (WOMAC, SF-12) comparing 
baseline to treatment at 3 months. 
Specific Aim 4: is to understand the natural history of conservative treatment on this 
cohort of patients over a [ADDRESS_820081], and 3-day accelerometer data.  Subjects will 
receive a single 6 mL intra-articular injection of hylan G-F 20 in the target knee at 
baseline.  All ongoing treatments will be monitored at 6 month intervals over the 3 year 
Protocol U CSF-SYNVISC-1 Confidential 
 
Version #001  Version Date: 5.17.12 Page 18 of 45 
 duration of the study.  Patients can receive any other conservative treatments (e.g., oral 
medications, physical or other therapy, acupuncture, etc., except other injection 
treatments) and current treatments will be documented during each patient encounter.  An 
initial injection of hylan G-F [ADDRESS_820082] 4 
months following their previous injection and they meet the inclusion criteria for pain 
levels on the following WOMAC questions A1 (How much pain have you had walking on 
a flat surface?), C8 (How much difficulty have you had going down the stairs?), C9 (How 
much difficulty have you had when going up the stairs?), C10 (How much difficulty have 
you had when getting up from a sitting position?) and/or C23 (How much difficulty have 
you had while doing heavy household chores?). Inclusion criteria for pain level is defined 
by [CONTACT_617521], severe, or extreme on all questions A1, C8, C9, C10 and/or C23 . 
Those subjects who select mild or no pain levels on any of A1, C8, C9, C10 and/or C23 , 
will not meet the criteria for WOMAC pain level and retreatment.  Patients requiring three 
injections of hylan G-F [ADDRESS_820083] and 4.5 hrs of email/phone contact.   
3.2 This experimental Synvisc-One indication is for the treatment of pain in osteoarthritis 
(OA
) of the knee in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conservative non-
pharmacologic therapy and simple analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen).

[ADDRESS_820091] and Control Products 
There will be no control products in this study. 
Protocol U CSF-SYNVISC-1 Confidential 
 
Version #001  Version Date: 5.17.[ADDRESS_820092], Synvisc-One, has a unique composition. Synvisc-One, like SYNVISC® 
, is a mixture of two hylan polymers derived from American and Canadian chicken comb 
hyaluronan. Hylans are produced by [CONTACT_617527]-linking hyaluronan in two steps 
(shown in figure).  Synvisc-One is hylan G-F 20, meaning it is 80% hylan A fluid plus 
20% hylan B gel. This composition yields a molecular weight and viscoelastic properties 
that closely match healthy synovial fluid. 
Synvisc-One™ (hylan G-F 20) is an elastoviscous high molecular weight fluid containing 
hylan A and hylan B polymers produced from chicken combs. Hylans are derivatives of 
hyaluronan (sodium  hyaluronate). Hylan G-F 20 is unique in that the hyaluronan is 
chemically cross-linked. Hyaluronan is a long-chain polymer containing repeating 
disaccharide units of Na-glucuronate- N-acetylglucosamine 
Hylan polymers (hylan A + hylan B) 16 mg 
Sodium chloride 17 mg 
Disodium hydrogen phosphate 0.32 mg 
Sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate 0.08 mg 
Water for injection q.s. to 2.0 mL 
 
SYNVISC® (hylan G-F 20) and Synvisc-One® (hylan G-F 20) are indicated for the 
treatment of pain in osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee in patients who have failed to respond 
adequately to conservative non pharmacologic therapy and simple analgesics, e.g., 
acetaminophen.

7.3.3 Packaging and Labeling    
The package insert is attached. Synvisc-one is supplied in single use boxes that will 
contain the statement, “CAUTION-Investigational device Limited by [CONTACT_238618].”   The boxes will be labeled and shipped with this investigational 
packing to the UCSF Investigational Pharmacy .

7.4.1 Dosage/Dosage Regimen 
Subjects will receive a single 6 mL intra-articular injection of hylan G-F 20 in the target 
knee at baseline.  Patients can receive any other conservative treatments (e.g., oral 
medications, physical or other therapy, acupuncture, etc., except other injection 
treatments) and current treatments will be documented during each patient encounter.  An 
initial injection of hylan G-F [ADDRESS_820099] 4 
months following their previous injection and they meet the inclusion criteria for pain 
levels on the following WOMAC questions A1 (How much pain have you had walking on 
a flat surface?), C8 (How much difficulty have you had going down the stairs?), C9 (How 
much difficulty have you had when going up the stairs?), C10 (How much difficulty have 
you had when getting up from a sitting position?) and/or C23 (How much difficulty have 
you had while doing heavy household chores?). Inclusion criteria for pain level is defined 
by [CONTACT_617521], severe, or extreme on all questions A1, C8, C9, C10 and/or C23 . 
Those subjects who select mild or no pain levels on any of A1, C8, C9, C10 and/or C23 , 
will not meet the criteria for WOMAC pain level and retreatment.    Patients requiring

 7.4.3 Administration Instructions  
The syringe containing SYNVISC (hylan g-f 20) is intended for single use. The contents 
of the syringe must be used immediately after the syringe has been removed from its 
packaging. Precaution: Do not concomitantly use disinfectants containing quaternary 
ammonium salts for skin preparation because hyaluronan can precipi[INVESTIGATOR_617515]. 
SYNVISC (hylan g-f 20) (2ml) is administered by [CONTACT_90169]-articular injection once a week 
(one week apart) for a total of three injections. Strict aseptic administration technique 
must be followed. Using an 18- to 22-gauge needle, remove synovial fluid or effusion 
before each SYNVISC (hylan g-f 20) (2ml) injection. Do not use the same syringe for 
removing synovial fluid and for injecting SYNVISC (hylan g-f 20) however the same 18- 
to 22-gauge needle should be used. Twist the tip cap before pulling it off, as this will 
minimize product leakage. To ensure a tight seal and prevent leakage during 
administration, secure the needle tightly while firmly holding the luer hub. Inject the full 2 
mL in one knee only 
7.5 Supply of Study Drug at the Site 
SYNVISC (hylan g-f 20) is supplied in a 2.25 mL glass syringe containing one 2 mL (16 
mg) dose of hylan G-F 20. The contents of the syringe are sterile and non-pyrogenic. The 
injections will be sent in the standard approved market packaging, with one syringe pe r 
box. Replacements will be provided by [CONTACT_617529].    
7.5.1 Storage 
Investigational Pharmacy  
Study devices will be stored  in protocol-specific bins on wire rack shelving units in a 
locked room (M69C) adjacent to the Investigational Drug Service office.  Room 
temperature products are stored in protocol-specific bins on wire rack shelving units in a 
locked room (M69C) adjacent to the Investigational Drug Service office. Temperature is 
maintained between 20-25 degrees C. with occasional excursions within the range of 15-
30 degrees C. as per the USP definition for Controlled Room Temperature.  Two 
maximum/minimum thermometers (values recorded in whole degree C units) are used to 
track room temperature, one at the entrance and another at the other end of the storage 
racks; values are recorded on a daily basis. In addition, a Dickson temperature logger 
(values recorded every 5 minutes) is used to track temperatures on a continual basis.   
The room is also subject to continual monitoring by [CONTACT_617530], a wireless temperature 
monitoring system that sends text-page alerts to key personnel (pharmacist in charge in 
the main pharmacy and Investigational Drug Pharmacist) in the event of potential 
temperature excursions in storage areas. Awarepoint temperature sensors will send a page 
to the pharmacist in charge in the Inpatient Pharmacy and the PoR in the event of near 
excursions for all devices monitored by [CONTACT_617531]: room temperature, 
refrigerator and -20C freezer. In the event that the alarm is not addressed within 30 
minutes, an alert is sent out to the Pharmacy manager on call.  Max/min values are 
recorded daily on a month-specific paper record that is maintained in the room until the 
end of the month. After this, the records are stored in the IDS files. A copy of the logger 
readout is downloaded weekly and stored in the same IDS temperature files. The PoR will 
sign and date the temperature record and the printout of the logger data before filing. The

Version #001  Version Date: 5.17.12 Page 26 of 45 
 max/min thermometer at the door also measures relative humidity max/min. These values 
are recorded on the same record as the max/min temperatures.  Reports from the system 
can be downloaded at any time for documentation of appropriate storage.  Temperature 
monitoring devices are certified annual ly-biannually.  
The PoR will secure the supplies while in possession of the pharmacy.   Staff pharmacists 
have access to investigational agents; a copy of the key to the investigational drug storage 
room is on the narcotic key ring held by [CONTACT_617532]. Additional keys are in the possession of the IDS pharmacist and the 
Director of Pharmacy and [ADDRESS_820101] access to 
investigational agents; a copy of the key to the investigational drug storage room is on the 
narcotic key ring held by [CONTACT_617533]. Additional keys are in 
the possession of the IDS pharmacist, the Director of Pharmacy and [ADDRESS_820102] until the 
investigator administrates them. Temperatures in the Orthopaedic Institute are also 
monitored using the AwarePoint system. AwarePoint enables the Investigational 
Pharmacy to monitor the Orthopaedic Institute’s temperature remotely.   Temperature is 
maintained between 20-[ADDRESS_820103], will be responsible for maintaining accurate

paper based records, this pharmacy uses WebIDS/Vestigo, an internet based drug 
accountability system. The system will track inventory and expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659], generate 
prescription labels and recharge for services rendered.

10 ADVERSE EXPERIENCE REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
ADVERSE EVENTS 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation of a 
patient administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment.  An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated 
with the administration of an investigational product, whether or not related to that 
investigational product.  An unexpected AE is one of a type not identified in nature, 
severity, or frequency in the current Investigator’s Brochure or of greater severity or 
frequency than expected based on the information in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
The Investigator will probe, via discussion with the subject, for the occurrence of AEs 
during each subject visit and record the information in the site’s source documents.  
Adverse events will be recorded in the patient CRF.  Adverse events will be described by 
[CONTACT_24109] (start and stop dates and times), severity, outcome, treatment and relation to 
study drug, or if unrelated, the cause. 
AE Severity 
The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 3.0 should be used to assess and grade AE severity, including 
laboratory abnormalities judged to be clinically significant. The modified criteria can b e 
found in the study manual.  If the experience is not covered in the modified criteria, the 
guidelines shown in Table 1 below should be used to grade severity.  It should be pointed 
ou
t that the term “severe” is a measure of intensity and that a severe AE is not necessarily 
serious. Visit 2 – 6 months after  
injection Vis it 3 – 1

 Table 1.  AE Severity Grading 
Severity (Toxicity Grade)  Description  
Mild (1)  Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no 
medical intervention or therapy require d. The subject may 
be aware of the sign or symptom but tolerates it reasonably 
well.  
Moderate (2)  Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal 
medical intervention/therapy required.  
Severe (3)  Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention /therapy 
required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125].  
Life-threaten ing (4)  The subject is at risk of death due to the adverse experience 
as it occurred. This does not refer to an experience that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe.  
 
AE Relationship to Study Drug 
The relationship of an AE to Synvisc-One should be assessed using the following the 
guidelines in Table 2. 
Tab
le 2. AE Relationship to Study Drug 
Relationship  
to Drug Comment  
Definitely  Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows a reasonable 
temporal sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known 
or expected response pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by 
[CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_617517]; and that is not explained by 
[CONTACT_41846].  
Probably  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of the drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the 
suspected drug; that is c onfirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_455130]; and that is unlikely to be explained by [CONTACT_261237]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_82978].  
Possibly  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from admini stration 
of the drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to that 
suspected drug; but that could readily have been produced by a number of 
other factors.  
Unrelated  An event that can be determined with certainty to have no relationship to 
the study drug.  
10.1 Serious Adverse Experiences (SAE) 
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes: 
 death 
Protocol U CSF-SYNVISC-1 Confidential 
 
Version #001  Version Date: 5.17.12 Page 33 of 45 
 
 a life-threatening adverse experience 
 inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 a persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other important medical events may also be considered an SAE when, based on 
appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the subject or require intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed.  
 
10.1.1  Serious Adverse Experience Reporting 
Study sites will document all SAEs that occur (whether or not related to study drug) per 
UCSF CHR Guidelines .  The collection period for all SAEs will begin after informed 
consent is obtained and end after procedures for the final study visit have been completed.   
Institution and Investigator understand and agree that Investigator and Institution are 
obligated under applicable law and regulations to report any serious and related adverse 
event, if any, that occurs during treatment with the Product to the Institution’s IRB and to 
the governing regulatory authority in accordance with applicable filing timelines promptly 
after any such event occurs.  Prior to or at the time of filing any such report with the 
governing regulatory authority, Investigator, within [ADDRESS_820117] knowledge of such 
serious and related adverse event, will also transmit an information copy of the report to 
Genzyme via fax, attention: Genzyme PV, [PHONE_12793] or by e-mail to 
[EMAIL_11744]. In accordance with the standard operating 
procedures and policies of the local Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC), the site investigator will report SAEs to the IRB/IEC.

13 STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS 
Prior to the analysis of the final study data, a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will 
be written describing all analyses that will be performed.  The SAP will contain any 
modifications to the analysis plan described below.   
13.[ADDRESS_820123] Knee Pain score ≤ [ADDRESS_820124] (with 
20% non-inferiority threshold) of this response rate in comparison to an external criterion 
of 70% (Bellamy 2010).  Secondary endpoints include determining the duration of 
response after subsequent injection, determining the effects of treatment on activity levels 
and quality of life, and describing the three-year time course of each of the study 
endpoints.  The sample size will be n=150 subjects followed for up to 3 years after 
baseline injection. The power to conclude non-inferiority for a true response rate of 65% 
is better than 92%. 
13.2 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
The following demographic variables at screening will be summarized by: [CONTACT_545], gender, 
age, height and weight. 
13.[ADDRESS_820125] Knee Pain scores ≤ 3 on a 0-10 pain scale, 
which is a threshold consistent with other similar studies (Tubach 2005, Bellamy 2010).  
The primary endpoint is defined as non-inferiority (with 20% non-inferiority threshold) of 
the proportion of responders in our study relative to an external criterion of 70% for the 
responder proportion (Bellamy 2010). 
 
Primary Statistical Analysis: Define the true probability of a subject being a responder 
as 
 and the non-inferiority threshold  
 = 0.20.  We require the test of

 and Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale) and quality of life scores (WOMAC, SF-12) 
comparing baseline to treatment at 3 months. 
 
- Three year follow up:  Patients will be followed for up to three years.  We will 
examine the time courses of pain score, activity level, and quality of life over the entire 
three year span. 
13.4 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
Secondary Analyses: Secondary endpoints will be analyzed using confidence intervals as 
no specific hypothesis tests are being conducted. 
 
The following secondary analyses will be conducted: 
 
- Duration of response : Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis techniques, we will 
estimate the probability of duration of response over time curve (survival curve) and its 
confidence limits and also the median duration time and confidence interval.  Duration of 
response analyses will be conducted for the initial injection and also in the subset of 
patients that receive a follow-up injection. 
 
- Activity levels and quality of life:   We will estimate the average change and 
corresponding confidence limits from baseline to 3 months in each of the activity level 
measures (accelerometer test , walk test, Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale) and the 
quality of life measures (WOMAC, SF-12).  The confidence intervals will be constructed 
using one sample t-distributions; in the event of strongly skewed measures, we will either 
use bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_617519].   The average 
change and the endpoints of the confidence intervals can be referenced to external 
clinically important improvements for comparison. 
 
- Long term outcome:  We will examine the time course for the pain score, activity 
level, and quality of life measures across the three years of the study.  Estimates and 
confidence intervals will be derived using mixed effects linear models.  Specifically, for 
each longitudinal outcome measure, we will model it as a function of the (categorical) 
time point.  Intrasubject correlation will be accommodated by [CONTACT_5640] a compound 
symmetry, autoregressive, or general covariance structure depending on best fit according 
to BIC.  In the event of very non-normally distributed outcomes, we will employ 
normalizing transformations prior to the analysis.  These analyses will be conducted using 
the Mixed procedure in SAS. 
 
13.5 Interim Analysis 
There is no interim analysis planned. Serious adverse events will be monitored by [CONTACT_242425].

 13.6  Sample Size and Randomization 
Bellamy demonstrated in his paper from 2007 (table 3) that a BLISS response at any time 
during the study was achieved in 70% receiving appropriate care and Hylan G -F 20 and 
only in 38% of patients receiving appropriate care (P<0. 0001).   A power calculation 
using a one- sample comparison of proportion with hypothesized value sample size was 
performed to determine non -inferiority to the 70% results quoted by [CONTACT_617522]. Power 
calculations were measured using STATA’s SAMPSI calculator.   If we postulate a 20% 
non-inferiority limit (i.e. that at least 50% of patients receiving G -F 20 will achieve a 
BLISS response), the sample size required to have 90% power and ∝=0.025 to show non -
inferiority at 50% would be 70.   For a 10% non -inferiority limit with 90% power and 
∝=0.025, the required sample size is 274, and for 15% non -inferiority limit with 90% 
power and ∝=0.025, it is 124 patients.   These numbers do not allow for dropouts, 
therefore, we intend to recruit 150 subjects to account for dropo ut. 
14 DATA COLLECTION, RETENTION AND MONITORING 
14.1 Data Collection Instruments 
Study personnel will enter data into REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) . 
REDCap is a secure, web-based application designed to support data capture for research 
studies. Subjects will not be identified by [CONTACT_528058], but will be 
identified by a subject number and initials. 
14.2 Data Management Procedures 
Once data has been successfully entered into the database, the Biostatistics Consulting 
Unit (BCU) of UCSF’s Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) will perform 
data management and analysis for the study.  Most CTSI personnel have office space 
within the area occupi[INVESTIGATOR_617520]’s Mission Bay campus, along with desktop computers and 
access to departmental “cloud” computing resources.  These include secure data storage 
and access on a HIPAA-compliant server, along with SAS and Stata statistical software.  
The server room has state- of-the-art environmental controls and security features that 
include secure, limited access and alarm systems; floor-mount, locking server racks with 
built-in AC and mounted power strips; dedicated AC unit with temperature monitoring; 
dedicated circuit breaker and power distribution units; uninterruptible power supply 
equipment; and fire detection and suppression. Servers are protected by a firewall and 
anti-virus software. Files and databases are backed up daily. Back-up tapes are sent to an 
off-site record storage facility every two weeks, with a 2-month tape rotation.  
Access to network resources is granted based on documented authorization from a 
supervisor and permissions are based on user responsibilities. Each user is given a 
network account consisting of a unique username [INVESTIGATOR_1238] a user-designated password that 
must meet network security criteria. Before network access is given, users are required to 
train on university electronic security policies.   All procedures for the handling and 
analysis of data will be conducted using good computing practices meeting FDA 
guidelines for the handling and analysis of data for clinical trials.

of 1996, EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC). 
15.[ADDRESS_820133] operating 
procedures and policies of the IRB, and the Investigator will keep the IRB informed as to 
the progress of the study.  The Investigator will obtain assurance of IRB compliance with 
regulations. 
Any documents that the IRB may need to fulfill its responsibilities (such as protocol, 
protocol amendments, Investigator’s Brochure, consent forms, information concerning 
patient recruitment, payment or compensation procedures, or other pertinent information) 
will be submitted to the IRB.  The IRB’s written unconditional approval of the study 
protocol and the informed consent form will be in the possession of the Investigator 
before the study is initiated.  The IRB’s unconditional approval statement will be 
transmitted by [CONTACT_617536].  This approval must refer to the study by [CONTACT_38123]. 
Protocol and/or informed consent modifications or changes may not be initiated without 
prior written IRB approval except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the 
patients or when the change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the 
study.  Such modifications will be submitted to the IRB and written verification that the 
modification was submitted and subsequently approved should be obtained.   
The IRB must be informed of revisions to other documents originally submitted for 
review; serious and/or unexpected adverse experiences occurring during the study in 
accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the IRB; new 
information that may affect adversely the safety of the patients of the conduct of the study; 
an annual update and/or request for re-approval; and when the study has been completed. 
15.3 Informed Consent Form  
Informed consent will be obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH 
GCP, US Code of Federal Regulations for Protection of Human Subjects (21 CFR 
50.25[a,b], CFR 50.27, and CFR Part 56, Subpart A), the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA, if applicable), and local regulations. 
The Investigator will prepare the informed consent form, assent and HIPAA authorization 
and provide the documents to the Sponsor or designee for approval prior to submission to

Version #001  Version Date: 5.17.12 Page 41 of 45 
 the IRB/IEC.  The consent form generated by [CONTACT_93753]/IEC.  The written consent document will embody the 
elements of informed consent as described in the International Conference on 
Harmonization and will also comply with local regulations. The Investigator will send an 
IRB/IEC-approved copy of the Informed Consent Form to the Sponsor (or designee) for 
the study file. 
A properly executed, written, informed consent will be obtained from each subject prior to 
entering the subject into the trial.  Information should be given in both oral and written 
form and subjects (or their legal representatives) must be given ample opportunity to 
inquire about details of the study.  If appropriate and required by [CONTACT_1036]/IEC, assent 
from the subject will also be obtained.  If a subject is unable to sign the informed consent 
form (ICF) and the HIPAA authorization, a legal representative may sign for the subject.   
A copy of the signed consent form (and assent) will be given to the subject or legal 
representative of the subject and the original will be maintained with the subject’s records.

1.2 Secondary Objectives  
To determine:  
• Incidence of serious regimen related toxicity  based on transplant outcomes by [CONTACT_4475] 
100 
• Incidence of secondary graft failure at 100 days 
• Incidence of acute graft -versus-host disease (GVHD) at 100 days 
• Incidence of chronic GVHD at one year  
• Probability of survival at one year 
• Incidence of infections at 100 days, 6 months, and one year 
• Immune reconstitution at [ADDRESS_1196800] 
dose of TBI required (toxicity endpoint) without impairing the hematopoietic engraftment (safety endpoint) in FA patients.  TBI dose de- escalation was terminated in December 2007 due to 
secondary graft failure in 2 of 2 patients.  After December 2007, all patients are to be treated with the fixed dose of TBI 300 c Gy.  In November 2011 the treatment plan was revised to add  
“Arm 4,” which treats very high risk subjects using TBI without thymic shielding and without T-cell depleting the cell product regardless of source.  
  
3 BACKGROUND  
 
3.1 Fanconi Anemia  
Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetically and phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_858804], progressive bone marrow (BM) failure and marked predisposition to malignancy.  The FA phenotype is extremely variable.  Congenital malformations may range from none to many, often involving the major organ system, resulting in dysfunction in some patients
1-3.  Hematologic 
abnormalities occur in virtually all patients with FA, at a median age of 7 years (range, birth to 41 years).
4  Based on clinical data in the International Fanconi Anemia Registry 
(IFAR; n = 754 patients), the cumulative incidence of BM failure by [CONTACT_654] 40 was 90%.[ADDRESS_1196801] for FA   
 
              
11/16/2018      Page 9 of 37 Notably, some patients presented with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute 
myelocytic leukemia (A ML) without a prior diagnosis of aplastic anemia (AA).  Of the 
754 IFAR FA patients, 120 (16%) patients developed MDS or AML with a cumulative incidence of MDS or AML by [CONTACT_654] 40 years of 33%.  Based on a survey of FA patients by [CONTACT_858821], the median age of onset of leukemia was 11.[ADDRESS_1196802] 
an extraordinary risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_325851], Wilms tumor and medulloblastoma at a very young age.

3.2 Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for Fanconi Anemia  
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT) from an allogeneic donor is the only 
treatment with curative potential for patients with the hematological complications of Fanconi Anemia (FA).
1,10-[ADDRESS_1196803] for the treatment of FA were 
negative.  Poor outcomes were primarily the result of excessive regimen -related toxicity 
(RRT) and severe graft -versus -host disease (GVHD).  Conditioning regimens were those 
used for acquired AA, consisting of cylophosphamide (CY) at a dose of 200 mg/kg with or without irradiation.  Severe RRT was noted with a high proportion of patients dying early after transplant with impaired cardiac function, severe mucositis, skin toxicity, infection, gastrointestinal hemorrhage and hemorrhagic cystitis.  
  18% ± 9%

11/16/2018      Page 10 of 37 improved results.  Subsequently, survival markedly improved in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_858805].  Incidences of RRT, GVHD and graft failure, however, remained particularly high after unrelated donor BMT with very poor survival (18%) at 3 years (Figure 1).
[ADDRESS_1196805] in FA patients.   In 1995, we started to T cell deplete bone marrow from unrelated donors in an attempt to further reduce RRT and overcome the obstacle of GVHD in FA patients.
14  GVHD 
prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine A (CSA) for six months, and short course methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/d) between day 5 and 19.  For the entire cohort of 29 FA  
patients treated from 1995-1998, the incidence of grade 2- 4 acute GVHD was 8% with no 
patient having chronic GVHD.   In 1999, we added fludarabine (FLU) to the CY- TBI-ATG preparative regimen to 
overcome the high risk of graft failure, part icularly in patients with somatic mosaicism.  
Between April [ADDRESS_1196806] 2003, 45 FA patients were treated with FLU 175 mg/m
2, 
CY 40 mg/kg, TBI 450 cGy and ATG.  All recipi[INVESTIGATOR_858806] T cell depleted marrow (or umbilical cord blood if no marrow donor could be identified).  As in the prior studies, GVHD prophylaxis consisted of CSA for six months and short course methylprednisolone.  Of [ADDRESS_1196807] in this manner from 1999-2003, 44 engrafted, resulting in a cumulative incidence of 97% (95% CI, 91-100). The incidence of acute and chronic GVHD was low being 21% (95% CI, 9-33%) and 10% (95% CI, 1-19%).   Despi[INVESTIGATOR_858807], regimen related toxicity (RRT) and opportunis tic infections remained major obstacles to 
successful HSCT.  In this most recent cohort of patients, significant RRT occurred in all patients with everyone exhibiting significant mucositis requiring narcotics and 48% having significant hemorrhagic cystitis .  Other severe toxicities included pulmonary 
hemorrhage (n=9), interstitial pneumonitis (n=4), GI hemorrhage (n=6), renal failure (n=9), erythroderma (n=3), and severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (n=2).  While RRT was common, RRT was a direct cause of death in [ADDRESS_1196808] events (34 and 30, respectively) with fungal pathogens (n=12) and other pathogens (n=1) observed less frequently.    In 2003, we initiated a study to determine the effect of thymic shielding as a strategy to improve immune reconstitution and in turn reduce the risk of opportunistic infection.  Betwee n October 2003 and January 2006, 15 FA patients were treated with FLU 175 
mg/m
2, CY 40 mg/kg, TBI [ADDRESS_1196809] for FA   
 
              
11/16/2018      Page 11 of 37 with the addition of thymic shielding at the time of radiation therapy.  All recipi[INVESTIGATOR_858808] T  cell depleted marrow (or umbilical cord blood if not marrow donor could be 
identified).  Thirteen of 15 patients achieved neutrophil engraftment at a median of 12 days (range, 10-38 days), suggesting that thymic shielding has no deleterious effect on hematopoietic recovery.  Five of 15 patients developed severe acute GVHD and none has developed chronic GVHD thus far.  For this group of patients, the probability of survival at 1 year is 66% (95% CI 41- 91%).  Significant RRT occurred in all patients with all 
patients exhibiting significant mucositis requiring narcotics and more than 50% having significant hemorrhagic cystitis.  Other severe toxicities included pulmonary hemorrhage/interstitial pneumonitis, GI hemorrhage, renal failure and severe hepatic veno- occlusive disease.  While RRT was common, RRT was a direct cause of death in [ADDRESS_1196810] died, two died from graft failure, one from ARDS, one from renal failure and one from fungal infection.  
 
3.4 Non-TBI Based Regimens for Fanco ni Anemia Patients  
Long -term follow -up studies of FA patients indicate that approximately 40% of FA 
patients develop a malignancy within 15 – [ADDRESS_1196811].
15 Reported risk factors 
include exposure to irradiation and the development of chronic GVHD.6,15-19  Eliminating 
irradiation will also potentially reduce the risk of regimen related toxicity and GVHD.  In addition, the risks for cataracts, endocrinopathies and potentially infertility in women, will be reduced (the majority of FA males are infertile).  
 In non- FA patients with aplastic anemia, a multicenter prospective trial was conducted 
from 1994-1999 to determine the minimum dose of TBI sufficient to achieve sustained engraftment and to determine the tolerability and toxicity of the regimen.
20  All patients 
received an unrelated donor BMT after 3 cycles of 30 mg/kg ATG and 4 cycles of 50 mg/kg cyclophosphamide (CY) and TBI.  The starting dose of TBI was [ADDRESS_1196812] possible dose (200 cGy ) in 
combination with CY/ATG was sufficient to allow engraftment without inducing prohibitive toxicity.  The follow up to this trial is the current Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network trial in which fludarabine has been added to CY, TBI [ADDRESS_1196813].   At the University of Minnesota, we developed a 
non-irradiation based preparative regimen using fludarabine (FLU), CY and anti-thym ocyte globulin (ATG) followed by [CONTACT_145162] T- cell depleted (TCD) bone marrow 
(BM) or unmanipulated umbilical cord blood (UCB) for FA patients with HLA- matched 
related donors.  The goals of this trial were to potentially reduce the risks of malignancy, GVHD and other late effects, such as endocrinopathy and infertility.  GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and short course methylprednisolone.
21  Between April 2000 
and January 2006, 12 patients with FA (11 AA, 1 MDS) underwent related donor HCT using this regimen.  Stem cell sources were BM and UCB in 9 and 3 patients, respectively.  All patients demonstrated primary engraftment.  Median days to neutrophil and platelet engraftment were 11 days (range 9 – 13) and 38 days (range 19 – 381), respectively.   No patient developed GVHD after primary HCT.  The patient with MDS

11/16/2018      Page 12 of 37 relapsed with AML and a maternal donor recipi[INVESTIGATOR_858809].  
The Kaplan -Meier estimate of survival at 2 years is 100% at a median follow -up of 2.5 
years (range 1 .6 – 4.5).  The results of this study demonstrate that a FLU-based, non-
irradiation approach is effective for FA patients with AA undergoing genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_293638]-identical sibling HCT.
[ADDRESS_1196815] drastically improved engraftment rates from 66% to 98%.  As well, T cell depletion of bone marrow has decreased the rates of GVHD from 50 -70% to 
20-30%.  We have also shown that thymic shielding during TBI is well tolerated with no deleterious effect on engraftment or other transplant outcomes.  However, is too early to determine if thymic shielding speeds immune recovery.  
 We hypothesize that FA patients undergoing alternate donor HSCT can achieve neutrophil engraftment with the use of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and ATG, without the use of irradiation in a similar fashion as was accomplished in FA patients undergoing HLA -matched sibling donor HSCT.  It is anticipated that rates of regimen related toxicity 
and GVHD will be lower with this non-irradiation based approach, resulting in improved survival.  We also anticipate that risk for late malignancies will be reduced.  Al l patients 
will have immune function tests performed to study the pace of immune recovery.   Our plan is to build upon our sequential modifications in our approach to alternate donor HSCT for FA patients to improve survival without compromising engraftment after HSCT.  We will decrease the dose of TBI in each cohort, using FLU, CY and ATG, followed by T cell depleted BM or UCB.  The decision to proceed with each stepwise decrease in TBI (300 cGy to 150 cGy to no irradiation) will be based upon achieving adequate neutrophil engraftment in the current cohort of patients.  TBI dose de- escalation was terminated in December [ADDRESS_1196816] is to give T regulatory cells (Tregs) at the time of HSCT to help promote engraftment and reduce the risk of GVHD.  CSA inhibits the growth of T regs whereas sirolimus promotes their growth.  Therefore sirolimus has replaced CSA in this trial in anticipation of the future trial with T regs.

11/16/2018      Page 13 of 37 In September 2014, the protocol was revised to restore CSA as GVHD prophylaxis as it 
is better tolerated by [CONTACT_102].  Sirolimus (rapamycin) was deleted as future trials with T regs are on hold indefinitely (see previous paragraph).

4.4 Patient Registration with the Clinical Trials Office  
Upon completion of the screening evaluation, eligibility confirmation and obtaining 
written  consent, a designated study staff person will enroll the patient into OnCore.   
 
At the time of registration, the patient’s cell source/processing  will be indicated in 
OnCore as one of the following study arms: Arm 1:  bone marrow or peripheral blood processed using Isolex 300i (for patients 
enrolled through April 2010) 
Arm 2: UCB – no processing. If one or both of the cord blood units used for the graft is 
unlicensed, the participant will co -enroll on University of Minnesota protocol 
MT2011-13R “Infusion of Cell Populations from Unlicensed Umbilical Cord Blood Units.” 
Arm 3: bone marrow or peripheral blood processed using CliniMACS (for patients 
enrolled beginning with the September 2010 protocol version). Subjects enrolled on the October 31, 2016 version of the protocol will co-enroll on University of Minnesota Protocol MT2015-31 “ CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System as a HUD 
for Obtaining CD34+ Cell-Enriched Products” 
Arm 4: TBI with no thymic shielding and no T-cell depletion (processing using 
CliniMACS device) regardless of stem cell source  
 TBI dose de- escalation was terminated December 2007 due to secondary graft failure in 2 
of 2 patients.    
4.5 Patients Who Are Registered and Do Not Receive Study Treatment  
If a patient is registered to the study, and is later found not able to begin the preparative 
regimen (beginning with the first dose of fludarabine), for whatever reason, the patient

considered a screen/baseline failure and the reason for removal from study will be clearly indicated in OnCore. 
  
5 TREATMENT PLAN  
In order to provide optimal patient care and to account for individual medical conditions, 
investigator discretion may be used in the prescribing of all supportive care therapy (i.e. acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, G- CSF, antimicrobials, etc).  
 Patients will receive antifungal prophylaxis beginning 1 month prior to conditioning therapy, if possible.  Refer to section 5.3.  See appendices VI and VII for preparative and prophylaxis drug information including expected toxicities

11/16/2018      Page 16 of 37 TBI will be given in a single fraction of 300 cGy administered on day –[ADDRESS_1196824] scan.  Shielding of the thymus will not be performed for subjects enrolled in Arm 4 (‘very high 
risk’ as defined in section 4.1), as these subjects would be at an increased risk of relapse 
due to unradiated marrow in the sternum.    If necessary because of decreased attenuation through the lungs, lung compensators  will 
be designed to keep the dose to the lungs 300 cGy (+/-5%).  The position of these lung compensators will be determined by [CONTACT_858822].  Dose is prescribed at the midplane of the patient at the midpelvis.  The dose rate will be 26 cGy/minute. 
 
Cyclophosphamide  
Cyclophosphamide 10 mg/kg is to be given as a 2 hour infusion for 4 days for a total dose of 40 mg/kg.  Strict attention should be made to vigorous hydration, fluid balance and maintenance of good urine output. Mesna (10 mg/kg/day) in divided doses will be given on the same days as cyclophosphamide for 4 days for a total dose of 40 mg/kg per institutional guidelines.   
 
Fludarabine  
Fludarabine 35 mg/m
2 will be given IV over 30 minutes daily for 4 days for a total dose 
of 140 mg/m2. Preparation, administration and monitoring will be according to standard 
practice procedures.  
 
Methylprednisolone  
Methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg will be given IV over [ADDRESS_1196825] practice procedures.  
 
5.2 GVHD Prophylaxis  
 
Patients will receive cyclosporine A (CSA) and mycophenylate mofetil (MMF) as GVHD 
prophylaxis.   
Cyclosporine A (CSA)  
All patients (regardless of allograft source) will receive CSA therapy beginning on day – 3.   
 
Dosing of CSA will be per the University of Minnesota BMT Program guidelines.  The target CSA trough level will be 200 mg/L to 400 mg/L.  
 CSA taper begins at da y +180 or 1 month after control of GVHD.  Taper to zero by 10% 
weekly dose reduction over approximately [ADDRESS_1196826] for FA

days of absolute neutrophil count [ANC] > 0.5 x 109/L. 
 MMF will be given at a dose of 15 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours PO (to a maximum dose of 1 gram).  The MMF dose may be adjusted to tablet sizes of [ADDRESS_1196828] orders.   Patients will be eligib le for pharmacokinetic studies.  
  If the patient has acute GVHD requiring systemic therapy, MMF may be stopped 7 days after initiation of systemic therapy for acute GVHD (e.g. resolution of skin rash, vomiting, and diarrhea).

6 STEM CELL COLLECTION, PROCESSING  AND INFUSION 
 
6.1 Stem Cell Source Selection  
 
The following will be the preferential order of stem cells to be used, provided appropriate 
cell doses are available as detailed in sections 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4: 
 
1. Related donor matched at HLA -A, B, C and DRB1. Related donors will be evaluated 
and collected per MT2012 -14C. 
2. Related marrow donor mismatched at [ADDRESS_1196830] for FA   
 
              
11/16/[ADDRESS_1196831] blood will be used as the stem cell source.   
 
6.2 Bone Marrow Collection and Processing  
 Unrelated d onor bone marrow will be collected in the usual sterile manner using 
established parameters determined by [CONTACT_83500]. 
 
Refer to MT2012-14C for related donor collection guidelines.  A goal of ≥  5.0 x 10
8/kg (b ased on patient ideal body weight) nucleated bone marrow 
cells will be collected.  
 With the September 2010 amendment, CD34+ cells will be isolated from the bone marrow using the CliniMACS® Cell Selection System ( Miltenyi Biotec ).  Patients will 
be given al l isolated CD34+ cells.  Prior to activation of the September 2010 amendment, 
cell selection was done using the Isolex®300i System (Nexell Therapeutics, Inc.). “Very 
high risk (see section 4.1)” patients who are treated on Arm 4 (see section 4.3) will receive cell products which are not T -cell depleted using the CliniMACS or other cell 
selection device.  In August 2016, the University of Minnesota received approval to use 
the CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System as a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD) as protocol 
number MT2015-31. With the October 2016 amendment, we will be using MT2015-31 to co-enroll subjects needing CD34+ cell isolation.  
 Infusion will be according to the current University of Minnesota guidelines.  Each patient is to receive 1.0 x 10
5/kg CD3+ cells.  An add back infusion of CD3+ cells 
may be required to achieve this prescribed cell dose if an insufficient number are present in the CD34+ isolated cell fraction given to the patient.  Peripheral blood stem cells will be used only if bone marrow cannot be collected as BM 
and UCB are the preferred stem cell source.  PBSC will be collected and processed per institutional guidelines.   
6.[ADDRESS_1196832] blood products are thawed and filtered (170-micron) in the Molecular and Cellular Therapeutics (MCT) Lab.  
 Infusion will be according to the current University of Minnesota guidelines.

8.1 Definitions  
The following definitions are based on the Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 Part 312.32 (21CFR312.32(a)).    Adverse Event:   Any untoward medical occurrence asso ciated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.   Suspected Adverse Reaction:   Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.   
Life-Threatening Adverse Event Or Life -Threatening Suspected Adverse Reaction:  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-threatening” if, in the 
view of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death.  
   Serious Adverse Event Or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction:   An adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse event  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Important medical even ts that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition

10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
10.1 Study Design  
 
To date, TBI 300 cGy has shown that primary graft failure is no longer a concern.   We 
will no longer dose- escalate or de -escalate but instead try to give a precise estimate of 
donor engraftment with this preparative therapy .  
 
Approximately 91 patients will be treated at the acce pted dose. 
  The TBI dose de-escalation trial was terminated December 2007 due to secondary graft failure in 2 of 2 patients.  All patients transplanted after December 2007 will be prescribed TBI 300 cGy with the goal of evaluating the primary endpoint with more precision. As of January, 2013, there were 42 evaluable patients enrolled at the accepted dose level with one non- evaluable patient due to early death. Our goal is to reach 91 
evaluable subjects. One or two patients may be considered high risk and two patients considered very high risk (and treated) after October 2011; these patients will not be included in the evaluable population. With the addition of 49 patients at the accepted dose, the 3 patients in cohort 2 and the 6 potential patients in the high risk arm, our total enrollment on the protocol will be approximately 120. 
 
10.2 Sample Size Considerations  
  
All patients transplanted after December 2007 will be prescribed TBI 300 cGy with the goal of evaluating the primary endpoint with more precision. Specifically we would like 
to show that with the current estimated graft failure rate of 5.0%, we can show with 95% confidence that the true graft failure rate is less than 10%. To do this we will need to enroll an additional [ADDRESS_1196843] for FA   
 
              
11/16/2018      Page 25 of 37 will be estimated by [CONTACT_5263] -Meier methods.  Regimen -related toxicity will b e 
summarized by [CONTACT_858824]. 
 
10.4 Monitoring Guidelines  
 
Patients will be monitored for excess 100 day transplant- related mortality (>50%). With 
the change back to CSA from Rapamycin  09/29/2014, we will only be monitoring among 
the additional cohor t of 20 patients.  
 We hypothesize that the rate of TRM will be less than 25% based on current experience.  A rate that exceeds 50% is considered unacceptable. The power for TRM is preset at 90% with a type- I error of 5%. Therefore, the trial will be stoppe d if [ADDRESS_1196844] 19 . 
 Following completion of the TBI dose de-escalation phase of the study at the selected dose of TBI 300 cGy and the  change in regimen on November, 2012 stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877] s will 
be monitored for the cohort of 49 patients receiving Cy/Flu/TBI (300)/Methyprednisone:  This study will be monitored for primary graft failure by [CONTACT_4475] 42.  The study will be stopped (and reviewed) if there is an excess incidence of graft failure.  Based on our prior experience with this therapy in this population, we expect that the rate of primary graft failure will be approximately 5%. Our maximum tolerated  level will be 20%.  
 The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_858816] 5% and 80% respectively.  With these stipulations, the trial will be stopped if there is graft failure  in [ADDRESS_1196845] for FA   
 
              
11/16/2018      Page 26 of 37 recruitment are being made by [CONTACT_858825].  All minority patients with suitable unrelated BM donors will be actively encouraged to enroll in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. 
 
11.2 Monitoring  
 
The sponsor- investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by 
[CONTACT_1201], government regulatory bodies, and University of Minnesota compliance groups 
in addition to the m onitoring requirements of the Cancer Center’s Data and Safety 
Monitoring Plan (section 9).  The investigator will make available all study related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data, etc.).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study- related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.) will be available for 
trial related monitoring, audits, or regulatory inspections.  
 
11.3 Informed Consent  
 
The principles of informed consent described in FDA Regulations (21 CFR Part 50) will be followed to comply with Food and Drug Administration regulations.  A patient must give written consent prior to study participation which must be witnessed and dated.  The original consent will be retained by [CONTACT_258254].  A copy of the consent form will be given to the patient.  
 Once a suitable donor has been identified for an individual patient, the patient will be completely evaluated by a physici an who subsequently outlines the course of therapy.  
Assuming the donor and patient meet the medical requirements for undergoing the stem cell donation and transplant procedure, respectively, the patient will then be admitted to the inpatient unit where the course of therapy will again be reviewed.  The risks of the procedures to the patient will be discussed in detail.  The plan of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], including the potential risks and benefits will be presented as objectively as possible. 
 
11.[ADDRESS_1196846] 6 years after the study file is closed with the IRB and FDA.    
 In addition, the Clinical Trials Office (CTO) will keep a master log of all patients participating in the study with sufficient information to allow retrieval of the medical records for that patient. Please contact [CONTACT_102676].

11/16/[ADDRESS_1196850] delivery of the prescribed dose.  For example, the calculation method should be compared to a measurement using a unit density phantom with dimensions equal to the trunk size of an average patient.   The skin dose should be >90 % of the prescription point dose.  Beam spoilers may be used, if necessary, to ensure this.     Provided an a greement between measurements and calculations is established, the following 
technique is used to find the meter set or treatment time.  If differences are detected, modified terms or additional correction factors should be introduced.  For example, modified values for percentage depth dose, tissue- air-ratios and tissue-phantom- ratios are necessary for some 
treatment units when the patient is positioned at a long distance from the photon source and near the floor or one wall of the room.  Also, some deviati on from an exact inverse square decrease 
with distance has been demonstrated for certain room geometries.   Example calculation (central axis prescription point)  
MS=  meter set for linear accelerator  
D= prescribed dose per field  
PR= tissue -phantom ratio f or area, A and depth, d  
A= the area of the entrance surface presented by [CONTACT_102]'s 
trunk  
D= depth to midline at level of the umbilicus  
FSCF=  field size correction factor for field length, L, and field 
width, W  
U= the treatment unit calibration in units of cGy/meter unit  
ISCF=  inverse square correction factor  
 Similar calculations can be written for time treatment machines (Co 60 units) or for fixed SSD set ups.  In order to obtain uniformity among centers using T BI, the Percentage Depth Dose 
(PDD), Tissue Air Ratio (TAR) must be determined for a depth equal to the half- separation at 
the level of the umbilicus and for a unit density scattering volume having dimensions equal to the top-of-shoulder to bottom-of-pelvis measurement in one direction and equal to the width at the umbilicus in the other direction.  This second dimension will be equal to the AP thickness at the umbilicus for lateral field irradiation, and will correspond to the lateral width at this same le vel 
for AP/PA treatment.  
 
Prescription Point and Dose Rate 
 A midplane dose rate of [ADDRESS_1196851] at the low pelvis at the level of the mid -hip.  If the patient is short, he/she will be treated with a

corresponds to the usual thymus position.  A 5HVL cerrubend blocks will be fabricated and placed so as to block the thymus from both the anterior and posterior TBI fields.   The thymus blocks will be attached to the special TBI  stand brackets that secure the lung compensators.  
 
At the discretion of the treating investigator(s), thymic shielding will not be done in a small 
subset of patients who, based on their disease status at study entry and/or previous treatment history, woul d be at an increased risk of relapse due to the unradiated marrow in the sternum. 
 A beam “spoiler” or bolus will be used to ensure a full skin dose.  Testicular boosts (used for leukemia patients) will not be utilized.

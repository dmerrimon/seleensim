1.[ADDRESS_1162001] line therapy applicable to the majority of 
patients with multiple myeloma. However disease relapse is  inevitable and remains the primary 
cause of mortality in this cohort.  
1.1.1  Myeloma Cell Contamination:  
Myeloma cells contamination of the leukapheresis product has been demonstrated in previous studies , but, the contamination rate or percentage of patients with contaminated graft 
undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation is not well known.  
Mariette et al, 1994, used the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene radioactive fingerprinting 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to detect clonal cells in the graft from 10 patients. The 
sensitivity of the technique allowed the detection of one clonal cell among 10(4) normal blood 
mononuclear cells. A clonal band was detected in 4 of 11 leukapheresis  samples (36%).  
In another paper by [CONTACT_837164]. Blood 2014, myeloma cell contamination was checked by [CONTACT_837165], and was present at a median level of 62.7 myeloma molecules/million PBMCs (range 0 -11,951) after Cycle of chemo and 43.6 myeloma molecules/million PBMCs (range 0-
4,489) after Cycle 2 of chemotherapy. 2 out of 38 observations were free from tumor cell 
contamination (personal communication). 
The impact of contaminated leukapheresis product is disputed, however evidence from 
prospective study by [CONTACT_817385] (Gertz et al., 1997) suggest that myeloma graft contamination 
leads to poor disease free survival. This is further supported by a recent clinical study, which showed low graft contamination (< 4.5 x 10
5 plasma cell/kg of patient’s body weight) did result in 
improved PFS (Vogel, Kopp, Kanz, & Einsele, 2005). In that series the number of contaminating 
plasma cells in the harvested product was 0.08% (median) with a range of 0- 2.26%.  Authors did 
not state how many patients did not have tumor contamination (0% plasma cells in the 
harvested graft).  
1.1.2  Methods of Measurement of Minimal Residual Disease:  
In the International Myeloma Workshop held in Kyoto, Japan (2013), two methods to measure 
MRD were given emphasis, viz. flow cytometry and real time PCR for gene sequencing.  
 
Multiparametric  flow cytometry (MFC) is a novel way of checking for minimal residual disease.  
 As per the recently published ASBMT myeloma guidelines (Shah, Cal lander, Ganguly et al, 
2015), MRD testing after auto -HCT in MM can reveal patients at risk for poorer outcomes and 
should be considered for disease evaluation (Grade B). If MRD testing is attempted, 
multiparametric  flow cytometry following E uropean Myeloma Network  consensus guidelines 
should be the method of choice.  
 
1.1.3  Level of Detection:  
Rawstron AC et al published the consensus guidelines on multiparametric flow cytometry in 
multiple myeloma and related disorders which established the presently accepted methods for 
measuring minimal residual disease in myeloma samples (Rawstron et al. 2008). In their 
  Page [ADDRESS_1162002]  
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_837133], MD  
HSC # STUDY00002857  
guidelines paper they recommended, that i t is possible to detect neoplastic plasma cells by [CONTACT_837166] 0.01%. It is recommended that at least 100 
neoplastic plasma cell events should be acquired for accurate enumeration. Hence, according 
to the consensus 1) at least 0.01% clonal plasma cells and 2) at least [ADDRESS_1162003] 
would be considered as positive for minimal residual disease.  
1.1.4  Purging:  
Unfortunately multicenter studies with ex -vivo purging using CD [ADDRESS_1162004] did not improve progression free survival (Stewart et al., 2001). 
In vivo purging has been tried using various chemo- immunotherapeutic agents in diseases like 
lymphoma. PCR or minimal residual disease (MRD) negative products have been associated 
with improved progression free survival.   In vivo purging has not been done in patients with 
multiple myeloma. In patients with lymphoma, in vivo purging and PCR negative products have been shown to improve disease- free survival ( DFS).  
 For the purpose of the transplant, hematopoietic stem cells are mobilized from the bone marrow niche by [CONTACT_837167] G -CSF or G -CSF alone. Bortezomib is approved for 
treatment in all stages of myeloma. In a single arm study at our institution we had shown successful collection and mobilization of stem cells using Bortezomib/G -CSF strategy.  
In a recent study (Oakervee et al, 2007), use of bortezomib as induction therapy prior to stem 
cell transplantation did not adversely impact the mobilization and actually resulted in robust stem cell collection in all the enrolled patients. Bortezomib thus does not have any stem cell 
toxic effects. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of a combination of bortezomib and 
G-CSF in a tumor free stem cell mobilization.  
Ex vivo purging of stem cell products by [CONTACT_837168].  24-hour incubation with bortezomib at 80 nmol/L induced 
80% to 90% growth inhibition in the myeloma cell lines, however, it also markedly inhibited 
(80%) the growth of normal CD34+ cells. In contrast, a lower dose of bortezomib (20 nmol/L) for 
16 hours was sufficient to induce 70% to 90% growth inhibition in myeloma cell lines, with only 
20% growth inhibition in normal CD34+ cells (Yang H et al. 2011).  
In an attempt to decrease tumor contamination in the stem cell product by [CONTACT_837169], 
bortezomib was chosen as the drug of choice, as we already have experience in using 
bortezomib in the similar setting for stem cell mobilization (Abhyankar et al. 2013)  
We have already presented our experience of in vivo purging in lymphoma (Singh et al. 2015), 
and planning to extend the similar concept in plasma cell disorders . 
 1.2 Study Ag ent(s) Background and Associated Known Toxicities  
 
VELCADE® (bortezomib) for Injection  
 1.2.1  Scientific Background  
VELCADE
® (bortezomib) for Injection is a small molecule proteasome inhibitor 
developed by [CONTACT_24312], Inc., (Millennium) as a novel agent to treat 
human malignancies.  Bortezomib is currently approved by [CONTACT_837170] (FDA) for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma (MM).  It 
  Page [ADDRESS_1162005]  
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_837133], MD  
HSC # STUDY00002857  
is also indicated for the treatment of patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have 
received at least 1 prior therapy.  In the European Union (EU), bortezomib in 
combination with melphalan and prednisone is indicated for the treatment of patients with previously untreated MM who are not eligible for high -dose chemotherapy with bone 
marrow transplant.  Bortezomib is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of 
progressive MM in patients who have received at least [ADDRESS_1162006] is critical to the inhibition of tumor growth could also differ.   Bortezomib has a 
novel pattern of cytotoxicity in National Cancer Institute (NCI) in vitro and in vivo assays (Adams et al., 1999).  In addition, bortezomib has cytotoxic activity in a variety of 
xenograft tumor models, both as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy and radiation (Steiner et al., 2001; Teicher et al., 1999; Cusack et al., 2001; LeBlanc et al., 2002; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_149587]., 2002).  Notably, bortezomib induces apoptosis in cells that over 
express bcl -2, a genetic trait that confers unregulated growth and resistance to 
conventional chemotherapeutics (McConkey et al., 1999).  
The mechanisms of action leading up to apoptosis have been more clearly defined and include initiation of the unfolded protein response and direct/indirect effects on various molecular targets including cell cycle control proteins p27 and p21, cyclins, signal 
transduction molecules, transcription factors c -jun and HIF -1, tumor suppressor protein 
p53, angiogenesis factors, and many others.    Bortezomib is thought to be efficacious in 
multiple myeloma via its inhibition of nuclear factor κB (NF -κB) activation, its attenuation 
of interleukin -6 (IL-6)-mediated cell growth, a direct apoptotic effect, and possibly anti -
angiogenic and other effects (Hideshima et al., 2001).  
1.2.2  Nonclinical Pharmacology  
Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic studies were conducted in the rat and cynomolgus monkey.  Upon intravenous (IV) bolus administration, bortezomib displays a 
rapid distribution phase (t½ α <10 minutes) followed by a longer elimination phase (t½ β 
5–15 hours).   Bortezomib has a large volume of distribution (range 5– 50 L/kg).  The 
plasma PK profile is well described by a 2 -compartment model.  
The pharmacodynamic action of bortezomib is well established and can be measured 
through an ex vivo assay (20S proteasome activity) (Lightcap et al., 2000).  This assay was used to determine the duration of drug effect in lieu of the PK data in the early 
preclinical toxicology studies as well as to set a guide for dose escalation in humans.  
Following dosing with bortezomib in the rat and cynomolgus monkey, proteasome 
inhibition in peripheral blood had a half -life less than 24 hours, with proteasome activity 
returning to pretreatment baseline within 24 hours in monkey and within 48 to 72 hours in rat after a single dose of bortezomib.   Further, intermittent but high inhibition (>70%) of 
proteasome activity was better tolerated than sustained inhibition.  Thus, a twice- weekly 
clinical dosing regimen was chosen in order to allow return of proteasome activity 
towards baseline between dose administrations.

HSC # STUDY00002857  
1.2.3  Nonclinical Toxic ity 
Single -dose IV toxicity studies were conducted with bortezomib in the mouse, rat, dog, 
and monkey to establish the single- dose m aximum tolerated dose (MTD).  The MTDs 
were 0.25 mg/kg (1.5 mg/m2) and 0.067 mg/kg (0.8 mg/m2) in the [ADDRESS_1162008] sensitive 
species, rat and monkey, respectively.  
Repeat -dose multi -cycle toxicity studies of 3 and 6 months in the rat and 9 months in the 
monkey, each with 8- week recovery periods, were conducted to characterize the chronic 
toxicity of bortezomib when administered by [CONTACT_151194].  The MTD in the 6- month rat study was 0.10 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m2) and the 
key target organs were the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, hematopoietic and lymphoid 
systems.  The MTD in the 9- month monkey study was 0.05 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m2) and the 
key target organs were the GI tract, hematopoietic and lymphoid systems, peripheral 
nervous system, and kidney.  Full or partial reversibility was observed for each of the 
toxicities described to date.   
In general, the nature of the toxicity of bortezomib is similar across species, and target 
organs of toxicity in animals have been largely predictive of human toxicity.  The toxicity 
of bortezomib in animals is characterized by a steep dose- response with mortality seen 
at dosages above the MTD.  The cause of death at acutely lethal dosages is considered 
to be related to indirect cardiovascular (CV) effects of hypotension and vascular changes 
with secondary bradycardia and the cause of death in long -term studies has been 
attributed to GI or hematologic toxicity.  The pharmacologic effects of bortezomib on the 
CV system have been extensively characterized and have demonstrated that indirect 
effects on CV function occur only at acutely lethal dosages and are abrogated by [CONTACT_837171].  
Additional detailed information regarding the nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology of BORTEZOMIB  may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.2.4  Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics  
The clinical pharmacology characterization of bortezomib has been determined from 
phase 1 studies in subjects with solid tumors and hematological malignancies, and  
confirmed in phase  2 studies in subjects with multiple myeloma.  
Bortezomib demonstrates multi -compartmental pharmacokinetics. Following intravenous 
administration of 1.0 mg/m
2 and 1.3 mg/m2 dose, the mean first -dose maximum 
observed plasma concentrations of bortezomib were 57 and 112  ng/mL, respectively in 
11 patients with multiple myeloma and creatinine clearance values >  50 mL/min 
participating in a pharmacokinetics study.  In subsequent doses, mean maximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 ng/mL for the 1.0 mg/m
2 dose 
and 89 to 120 ng/mL for the 1.3 mg/m2 dose.  The mean elimination half -life of 
bortezomib upon multiple dosing ranged from [ADDRESS_1162009] dose.  Mean Total Body Clearances were 102 and 112 
L/h following the first dose for doses of 1.0 mg/m2 and 1.3 mg/m2, respectively, and 
ranged from 15 to 32 L/h following subsequent doses for doses of 1.0 and 1.3 mg/m2, 
respectively.  Clinical experience has shown that the change in clearance does not result 
in overt toxicity from accumulation in this multi- dose regimen in humans.  
In subjects with advanced malignancies, the maximum pharmacodynamic effect (inhibition of 20S activity) occurred within 1- hour post dose.  At the therapeutic dose of 
1.3 mg/m
[ADDRESS_1162010] dose was approximately 61%.

Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_837133], MD  
HSC # STUDY00002857  
The time course of proteasome inhibition in subjects is characterized by [CONTACT_758493], followed by [CONTACT_758494] 6 to 24 hours to within 50% of the pretreatment activity.  On the Day 1, 4, 8, and 11 schedule, variable (10% –30%) levels of proteasome 
inhibition have been observed at next scheduled dosing.  In theory, this advantage allows cells to recover proteasome activity for normal cellular housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_91780].  
The relationship between bortezomib plasma concentrations and proteasome inhibition 
can be described by a maximum effect (E
max) model.  The E max curve is initially very 
steep, with small changes in plasma bortezomib concentration over the range of 0.5 to 
2.0 ng/mL relating to large increases in the percent inhibition (0– 60%).  After that, a 
plateau occurs where marginal increases of proteasome inhibition are observed in spi[INVESTIGATOR_758482].  
1.2.[ADDRESS_1162012] been treated with 
bortezomib, including patients treated through Millennium -sponsored clinical trials, 
Investigator -Initiated Studies, the US NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), 
and with commercially available drug.  Bortezomib has been commercially available 
since 13 May 2003.  
 
The overall goal of the Millennium phase 1 program was to determine the MTD and 
dose- limiting toxicity (DLT) of bortezomib in a number of therapeutic settings involving 
subjects with various advanced malignancies.  In a Phase I trial in patients with 
refractory hematologic malignancies, the MTD for a twice weekly for 4 weeks of a 42 day 
cycle was 1.04 mg/m2/dose, with DLTs of thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, 
hypokalemia, fatigue, and malaise (Orlowski et al., 2002).  The toxicity was greatest during the third and fourth weeks of therapy. In the 3- week schedule of bortezomib 
monotherapy (4 doses, given on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21- day treatment cycle), the 
DLT occurred at 1.56 mg/m
2/dose (3 subjects with Grade 3 diarrhea and 1 with 
peripheral sensory neuropathy).  Therefore, the MTD at this schedule was 1.3 
mg/m2/dose.  In a 35 -day treatment cycle with 4 weekly doses of bortezomib 
monotherapy, the MTD was 1.6 mg/m2/dose and DLT included hypotension, tachycardia, 
diarrhea, and syncope.  
In phase 1 clinical studies, anti -tumor activity was reported in subjects with NHL, multiple 
myeloma, Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia, squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx, bronchoalveolar carcinoma of the lung, renal cell carcinoma, and prostate 
cancer.  
The safety a nd efficacy of bortezomib in subjects with multiple myeloma were 
investigated in two phase 2 clinical studies, studies M34100- 024 (subjects with first 
relapse) (Jagannath et al, 2004) and M34100- 025 (subjects with second or greater 
relapse and refractory to their last prior therapy) (Richardson et al, 2003).  In M34100- 025, [ADDRESS_1162013] 2 previous treatments received bortezomib, 1.3 mg/m
2 on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 
21-day treatment cycle.  The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant (EBMT) 
response criteria, as described by [CONTACT_149617] (Blade et al., 1998) were utilized to determine 
disease response.  CRs were observed in 4% of subjects, with an additional 6% of 
patients meeting all criteria for CR but having a positive immunofixation test.  PR or 
better was observed in 27% of subjects, and the overall response rate (CR, PR and

Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_837133], MD  
HSC # STUDY00002857  
minor response [MR] combined) was 35%.  Seventy percent of subjects experienced 
stable disease or better.   
The phase 3 study (M34101- 039) (Richardson et al, 2005), also referred to as the APEX 
study, was designed to determine whether bortezomib provided benefit (time to 
progression [TTP], response rate, and survival) to patients with relapsed or refractory MM r elative to treatment with high -dose dexamethasone.  The study was also designed 
to determine the safety and tolerability of bortezomib relative to high- dose 
dexamethasone, and whether treatment with bortezomib was associated with superior 
clinical benefit and quality of life relative to high- dose dexamethasone.  A total of 669 
patients were enrolled and 663 patients received study drug ( bortezomib:  331; 
dexamethasone: 332).  Patients randomized to bortezomib received 1.3 mg/m
2 I.V. push 
twice weekly on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 3- week cycle for up to eight treatment cycles 
as induction therapy, followed by 1.3 mg/m2 bortezomib  weekly on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 
of a 5 -week cycle for three cycles as maintenance therapy. Patients randomized to 
dexamethasone received oral dexamethasone 40 mg once daily on days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 of a 5 -week cycle for up to four treatment cycles as induction therapy, 
followed by [CONTACT_149618] 40 mg once daily on days 1 to 4 followed of a 4- week cycle 
for five cycles as maintenance therapy. The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant (EBMT) response criteria, as described by [CONTACT_149617] (Blade et al., 1998) were 
utilized to determine disease response.  There was a 78% increase in TTP for the 
bortezomib arm. Median TTP was 6.2 months for the bortezomib arm and 3.5 months for 
the dexamethasone arm ( P<.0001). CR (complete response) + PR (partial response) 
was 38% with bortezomib vs. 18% with dexamethasone ( P<.0001). CR was 6% with 
bortezomib vs. <1% with dexamethasone ( P<.0001). The CR + nCR rate was  13% with 
bortezomib vs. 2% with dexamethasone. In patients who had received only one prior line 
of treatment (bortezomib: 132; dexamethasone: 119) , CR + PR was 45% with 
bortezomib vs. 26% with dexamethasone ( P=.0035). With a median 8.3 months of 
follow -up, overall survival was significantly longer ( P=.0013) for patients on the 
bortezomib arm vs. patie nts on the dexamethasone arm. The probability of survival at 
one year was 80% for the bortezomib arm vs. 66% for the dexamethasone arm, which 
represented a 41% decreased relative risk of death in the first year with bortezomib 
(P=.0005). In patients who had received only one prior line of treatment, the probability 
of survival at one year was 89% for the bortezomib arm vs. 72% for the dexamethasone 
arm, which represented a 61% decreased relative risk of death in the first year with 
bortezomib ( P=.0098). Updated response rates and survival data were reported for 
M34101- 039 (Richardson ASH, 2005). The updated CR (complete response) + PR 
(partial response) rate was 43% with bortezomib. The CR + nCR rate was 16% with 
bortezomib. With a median 22 months of follow -up, overall survival was significantly 
longer for patients on the BORTEZOMIB  arm vs. patients on the dexamethasone arm. 
The median overall survival was 29.8 months (95% CI: 23.2, not estimable) for the 
bortezomib arm vs 23.7 months (95% CI: 18.7, 29.1) for the dexamethasone arm  
(hazard ratio = 0.77, P= 0.0272). The probability of survival at one year was 80% for the 
bortezomib arm vs. vs 67%  for the dexamethasone arm ( P=0.0002).

Prescribing physicians and health care practitioners are referred to their locally approved 
product label for bortezomib regarding indications and usage, contraindications, 
warnings, and precautions.  
The known anticipated risks of bortezomib therapy are presented in Table 1 later in this 
protocol (see section with title DRUG INFORMATION).   These risks are grouped 
according to the combined frequency observed in an integrated analysis of AEs in sponsored clinical studies of single- agent bortezomib dosed at 1.3 mg/m
2 twice weekly 
on a 21 -day schedule, in patients with multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. 
1.3 Other Agents  
G-CSF (Filgrastim)  or Filgrastim G -CSF Biosimilar (ZarxioTM) 
 Filgrastim is human granulocyte colony -stimulating factor (G -CSF) produced by [CONTACT_114474].  G -CSF stimulates the production, maturation, and activation of neutrophils 
and activates neutrophils to increase their migration and cytotoxicity.  Toxicities that are likely to 
occur include myalgias and medullary bone pain.  The bone pain can be generally controlled 
with non- narcotic analgesia.  Less likely side effects include fluid retention, pericardial effusion, 
local inflammation at the injection site and transient laboratory abnormalities including mild elevations in uric acid, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase, and leukocytosis.  Rare but serious side effects include reported cases of spleen swelling resulting in splenic 
rupture, adult respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS), and allergic reactions.  
1.[ADDRESS_1162016] of care approach and after using two doses of bortezomib as a  part of in vivo purging 
method used in a prior published study  (Abhyankar et al. 2013) . 
 Multiparametric flow cytometry will be  used to measure minimal residual disease (MRD)  in the 
harvested product of  patients with multiple myeloma.  
 Tumor contamination of the stem cell product is common in patients undergoing stem cell 
transplantation. Use of multi parametric flow cytometry in measuring low percentage  of plasma 
cells contaminating harvested stem cell product has never been used.  
 
MFC is the standard of care in measuring MRD. Contamination rate of > 0.01% with  >100 
plasma cells per flow will be considered as positive  for study purpose per guidelines (Rawstron 
AC et al, 2008).  
 
Bortezomib has been used as anti-myeloma drug during ex vivo purging. Role of bortezomib 
used prior to stem cell collection in lowering tumor contamination of the stem cell product is an 
intriguing concept that has not been tested.   
The rationale for bortezomib prior to the G -CSF is as follows:  
 Bortezomib causes thrombocytopenia;  similar to the manner in which cyclophosphamide is 
given followed by G -CSF for stem cell mobilization. Usually a cycle of bortezomib for myeloma 
therapy consists of [ADDRESS_1162017]  
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_837133], MD  
HSC # STUDY00002857  
Patients meeting eligibilit y criteria and who give informed consent will be randomized to receive 
mobiliz ation using bortezomib at 1.3  mg/m2 on day -11 and day -8 followed by  G-CSF  at 10 
mcg/kg  from day -4 to day -1  vs treatment with G -CSF 10 mcg/kg alone on days -4 through -1. 
For both groups s tem cell collection will be done on day 0 (window : + 4 days) per standard of 
care regimen and protocol with processing of 4  - 6 blood volumes. Stem cell enumeration by 
[CONTACT_837172]. The number of CD 34 positive cells (stem cell 
phenotype) / kg obtained each day of collection will be noted. G -CSF will be continued daily until 
adequate numbers of stem cells are obtained for the performance of a single autologous transplant (>  2.5 million CD 34 cells/kg o f recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22593]). Subsequently the data for 
engraftment of neutrophils and platelets will be monitored as is routine for all patients undergoing autologous transplant.  
Multiparametric Flow Cytometry will be used to determine presence (>0.01%)  or absence 
(<0.01%)  of malignant plasma cells in the harvested products. A positive flow cytometry also will 
have to have >100 plasma cells per analysis. 
Recently the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) panel approved definitions of 
immunophenotypic CR and molecular CR to be incorporated into the IMWG criteria.  In addition, 
several studies have prospectively employed m ultiparameter flow cytometry  (MFC) and shown 
improved outcome in MRD - negative patients after auto- HCT.   The European Myeloma 
Network (EMN) and ASBMT respectively  developed a consensus for plasma cell enumeration, 
sample preparation, gating and immunophenotype for clonality assessment  and guidelines for 
MRD assessment in patients with myeloma undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation 
(Rawstron AC et al, 2008 and Shah, Callander and Ganguly et al, 2015) .

4.1 Treatment Dosage and Administration  
Treatment will be administered only to eligible subjects under the supervision of the investigator 
or identified sub- investigator(s).  Subjects may be treated on an out -patient basis, if possible.   
 
Study treatment will be prepared under the supervision of a pharmacist, or appropriately 
qualified and trained personnel.  The amount (in mg) of drug to be administered will be 
determined based on body surface area.  Body surface area is to be calculated based on body weight using a standard nomo gram (S ee APPENDIX B).  
 
Treatment Regimen Group A  
Standard of Care Stem cell collection without in- vivo purging with Bortezomib.  G -CSF and 
Mozobil used if needed. Physician discretion will be used to advise on the plan which may 
include the continuation of Mozobil.  The provider has the discretion of collection outside the 
algorithm included in Appendix C (See Appendices C and D ).

Treatment Regimen Group B  
Bortezomib will be given SQ at 1.3 mg/m2 on day -11 and day -8 followed by [CONTACT_837175] -4 thru day -1 and continued until the collection is completed. 
Mozobil used if needed.   Physician discretion will be used to advise on the plan 
which may include the continuation of Mozobil.  The provider has the discretion of collection outside the algorithm included in Appendix C (See Appendices C and D ). 
NOTE S: 
1. There must be at least [ADDRESS_1162029] injection of bortezomib, if 
needed, for participant safety and convenience. Window: Day 0 (+4 days).  
4.2 Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications 
Before each drug dose, the subject  will be evaluated for possible toxicities that may have 
occurr ed after the previous dose(s).  Toxicities are to be assessed according to the NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.03.   
 
Subjects  who experience bortezomib- related neuropathic pain and/or peripheral sensory 
neuropathy after the first injection are to be managed as standard of care. No dose reduction 
will be necessary for Grades [ADDRESS_1162030]  has delayed or non-
engraftment of neutrophils and / or platelets the etiology of the delay will be  determined and if 
believed to be possibly related, then the study will be halted.  
 
Subjects  with mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin < 1.5 × ULN) do not require a starting dose 
adjustment.  Please note that subjects  with bilirubin levels >  1.[ADDRESS_1162031] are excluded from 
enrollment in this protocol.  
4.3 Concomitant Medications/Treatments  
Investigators should consider using antiviral prophylaxis in subjects being treated with bortezomib.

If one of the highly effective methods cannot be used, using 2 effective methods at the same time is recommended.   
 Male subjects , even if surgically sterilized ( i.e., status post vasectomy) must agree to 1 of the 
following:  
• Practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through  a minimum of [ADDRESS_1162034] 
transplant protocol until engraftment of neutrophil s (first of 3 days when absolute neutrophil 
count is equal or greater than 500 /uL) and platelets (day to platelet counts of more than 
20,000/uL ). Usua lly this is accomplished by [ADDRESS_1162035] the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any 
reason, without prejudice to their medical care.  The investigator also has the right to withdraw, and in some cases is required to withdraw subjects from the study f or any of the following 
reasons:

6.1 Definitions  
6.1.1  Adverse Event  [21 CFR 312.32(a)]   
An adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
 
An adverse event  (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a drug, and does not imply any judgment about 
causality.  An adverse event can arise with any use of the drug (e.g., off -label use, use in 
combination with another drug) and with any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.

cancer -related symptoms that have occurred in the last [ADDRESS_1162052], along with the associated signs, symptoms or diagnosis.  
As far as possible, each adverse event will also be described by:  
• its duration (start and end dates),  
• grading of severity,  
• its relationship to the study drug,  
• the action(s) taken,  
• outcome.  
6.1.2  Suspected Adverse Reaction [21 CFR 312.32(a)]  
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of safety reporting, 
‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser 
degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse 
event caused by a drug.  
 
Suspected adverse reactions are the subset of all adverse events for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event. Inherent in this definition, and in 
the requirement to report suspected adverse reactions, is the need for the sponsor to 
  Page [ADDRESS_1162053]  
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_837133], MD  
HSC # STUDY00002857  
evaluate the available evidence and make a judgment about the likelihood that the drug 
actually caused the adverse event.  
 
Factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the adverse event to study drug 
include:  
• The temporal sequence from study drug administration: The event should occur after the study drug is given.  The length of time from study drug exposure to event should 
be evaluated in the clinical context of the event.  
• Recovery on discontinuation (de -challenge), recurrence on reintroduction (re-
challenge):  Subjec t’s response after drug discontinuation (de -challenge) or subject’ s 
response after study drug re -introduction (re -challenge) should be considered in the 
view of the usual clinical course of the event in question.  
• Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases: Each report should be evaluated in 
the context of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any 
other disease the subjec t may have.  
• Concomitant medication or treatment: The other drugs the subjec t is taking or the 
treatmen t the subjec t receives should be examined to determine whether any of 
them may be suspected to cause the event in question.  
• The pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the study drug: The pharmacokinetic 
properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) of the test drug(s), 
coupled with the individual subject ’s pharmacodynamics should be considered. 
 
Attribution is the relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event and 
the study treatment. Attribution will be assigned as follows:  
• Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment.  
• Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment. 
• Possible – The AE may be related to the study treatment.  
• Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
• Definite  – The AE is clearly related to the study treatment.  
6.1.3  Unexpected [21 CFR 312.32(a)]  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has 
been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not 
consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or 
elsewhere in the current application… "Unexpected," as used in this definition,  also 
refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the 
investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurr ing 
with the Particular drug under investigation.  
 
This definition relies entirely on a listing of the adverse events or suspected adverse reactions in the investigator brochure…as the basis for determining whether newly 
acquired information generated from  clinical trials or reported from other sources is 
unexpected. This means that events not listed for the Particular drug under investigation in the investigator brochure are considered “unexpected” and those listed are considered 
“expected.”  When new adverse event information is received, it is the sponsor’s 
responsibility to determine whether the event is “unexpected” for safety reporting 
purposes.  
  Page [ADDRESS_1162054]  
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_837133], MD  
HSC # STUDY00002857  
6.1.4  Serious [21 CFR 312.32(a)]  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the  view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a 
life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20967], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the patient or patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
6.1.5  Life-threatening 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life- threatening” if, in the 
view of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or patient at 
immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse 
reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
6.2 Reporting Requirements for Adverse Events

a Incidence is assigned using the following convention:  very common ( ≥ 1/10); common ( ≥ 1/100 and 
< 1/10); uncommon ( ≥ 1/1000 and < 1/100); rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 and < 1/1000 ); very rare ( < 1/10,000, 
including isolated reports).  
b Acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disease is a MedDRA Lower Level Term which corresponds to a 
Preferred Term of Interstitial lung disease.  
Other medical events of interest that are considered not causally related to bortezomib include hepatic 
failure and QT prolongation.  Fatal outcomes have been reported.  
Women of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with bortezomib.  Genotoxicity testing has shown that bortezomib is negative in the in vitro Ames assay and in the in vivo 
micronucleus assay, but it is a clastogen in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay.   
Additional details on the potential risks of bortezomib may be found in the current Investigator’s 
Brochure.

9.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
9.1 Oversight and Monitoring Plan  
The Data Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC ) of the KUCC is responsible for monitoring 
subject  safety for this trial.  
The Data Safety Monitoring Committee will include at least two external members. These individuals will not have any appointment, volunteer or otherwise, or membership with either the 
KU Cancer Center or University of Kansas Medical Center.  
 The external DSMC members have been identified as: 
 
Rony Aboujawde, MD  
Mosaic Life Care, St Joseph, MO  
Rony.abou- [EMAIL_15884]
 
 [CONTACT_837208], Bolivar, MO  
[EMAIL_15885]
 
 
These members will serve as ad -hoc voting members for this protocol. This protocol will be 
reviewed at the beginning of each committee meeting and these external members will attend the meetings  by [CONTACT_648].  
 
The DSMC  is responsible for:  
• Review of all clinical trials conducted by [CONTACT_487713]  
• Review of all adverse events requiring expedited reporting as defined in the protocol  
• Submission of  recommendations for corrective action to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_837142]  
• Notification of  external sites participating in multi -institution  clinical trials coordinated 
by [CONTACT_837181].  
• The University of Kansas Cancer Center Quality Assurance Unit will audit study 
activity and reported data on at least a quarterly basis for any collaborating sites  
9.2 Safety Review and Oversight Requirements  
a) Serious Adverse Event  
Serious adverse events that require expedited reporting will be reviewed by [CONTACT_837182]. If determ ined to be 
  Page [ADDRESS_1162078]  
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_837133], MD  
HSC # STUDY00002857  
necessary by [CONTACT_9288] C, all participating sites will be notified of the event and of any 
resulting action within one working day of this determination.  
b) Review of Adverse Event Rates  
Once per month, adverse event rates will be monitored by [CONTACT_487715]. If any 
study has had 2 or more of the same SAE reported within one month, or more than 6 of 
the same SAE in 6 months, the DSMC will review summaries of SAEs, and discuss events  in detail with the PI. The DSMC  chair or designee determines whether further 
action is required.  The DSMC  Coordinator ensures that collaborating investigators and 
IRBs for all p articipating sites are notified of any resulting action.  
 
c) Study Safety and Progress – Quarterly Review  
An overall assessment of toxicities as described in the protocol is reviewed at quarterly  
DSMC  meetings.  This review enables DSMC members to assess whether significant 
risks are occurring that would warrant  study suspension/closure or protocol amendment. 
9.3 Data Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC) Reporting  
 
All Data Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC ) reports, including those recommending 
continuation of the study, are forwarded to the KUMC Human Subjects Committee  (HSC) .  Any 
DSMC  recommendations for modifications to the trial are forwarded to the Deputy Director of 
KUCC or their designee. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_837143]/she may alert 
all investigators about the potential action.  At this time the PI [INVESTIGATOR_837144] c ommittee’s decision. The

13.0 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Study Design/Study Endpoints  
This is an open label, randomized study intended to:  
 
• Estimate the proportion of subjects with positive plasma cell contamination 
(expressed as percentage as mentioned in the consensus guidelines; >0.01% 
and at least 100 cellular events) (Rawstron AC et al, 2008 and Shah, Callander 
and Ganguly et al, 2015) of harvested stem cell product by [CONTACT_837186] 1) by [CONTACT_837187] 2) 
after two doses of bortezomib as in vivo purging plus standard of care using 
GCSF with or without Mozobil.  
• Estimate the proportion of subjects who have a successful collection of stem cells (> 2 millio n CD34 cells/Kg of body weight) for autologous transplant in both 
treatment groups.  
• Estimate the percentage of CD 34 positive cells in circulating peripheral blood as 
a measure of mobilization on the days of collection 
13.2 Sample Size and Accrual  
• N=100 
• Patients will be randomized using sequential assignment of predetermined block randomized 1:1 treatment assignments provided by [CONTACT_837188].  
• Dichotomous yes or no response on tumor contamination of products in two study 
arms  
 
Justification for Sample Size  
 
YEAR  Number of Stem Cell 
Harvests  Number of Autologous 
Transplantations  
2011 60 71 
2012 78 94 
2013 100 102 
2014 87 89 
 
NOTE:  An average of 5 -7% patients failed to collect with or without Mozobil historically over 
the last four years at the KU BMT program.  
 
With 50 evaluable products in each treatment arm, 95% confidence interval  width  for the 
proportions of contaminated products will be no greater than 29% using the exact binomial 
method .   Contamination is defined as >0.01% cancer cells and at least 100 cellular events  
(Rawstron AC et al, 2008 and Shah, Callander and Ganguly et al, 2015) .

13.[ADDRESS_1162088]  demographics and clinical 
characteristics, including disease and transplant -related factors.    Estimates and 
95% exact binomial confidence intervals will be calculated for the primary 
endpoint, the proportion of subjects  in which the leukapheresis product was 
contaminated with tumor cells, within each treatment group. These estimates will provide critical information for designing future studies formally testing the 
effectiveness of this therapy.  Attrition is not expected since the primary endpoint is an assessment of the leukapheresis product.  All leukapheresis products are 
expected to be evaluable for contamination.  Should a product NOT be evaluable, it would conservatively be considered contaminated in the primary 
analysis.  Similar methods will be used to estimate and provide 95% exact 
binomial confidence intervals for the proportion of subjects who experience 
successful extraction of product for transplantation.   Summary statistics will be 
provided for  proportion of subjects who would have adequate number of  CD [ADDRESS_1162089] guidelines (Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy). 
KU BMT stem cell first week colle ction success over last 4 years had been 93%. 
Hence, if the collection rate falls below that i.e. if 7% or more patients fail to 
collect (as defined by [CONTACT_837189] 2 million/Kg CD 34 + cells with 
GCSF and with or without Plerixafor mobilization procedure); root cause analysis 
is done by [CONTACT_50783] (SOC -per QA team). This trial stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_837147].  
 
Based on a binomial probability calculation, after 25 patients (half way through) 
are enrolled in each arm, we will calculate the collection rate and if more than [ADDRESS_1162090] (Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy).  
 
NOTE:   Failure of mobilization
 is defined as a patient’s body’s failure to collect 
CD34+ cells at least 2 million/Kg after standard procedure of using G -CSF 
with or without Plerixafor.

In addition, as a routine and normal Standard of Care (SOC) process for KU BMT Stem 
Cell Lab , ongoing QA meetings are held, data is collected and analyzed for reporting 
purposes independent of any clinical trial. The data collected as a part of this  trial will be 
entered  by [CONTACT_837190] , and during the interim analysis will be avail able for 
analysis by [CONTACT_837191] .  Concurrently, data from the KU BMT Stem 
Cell Collection Lab will be made available to the KU Biostatistics Department, in order  to 
match the results and document congruity. The AEs and SAEs are posted in the CRIS 
environment of KUCC website. AEs and SAEs are also noted by [CONTACT_837192]. Any discrepancy will be addressed during the interim analysis or at any time if 
deemed necessary by [CONTACT_6802], BMT QI committee or  the KU Biostatistics 
Department.  In essence, three independent groups will have access to the data, i.e. 
DSMC, KU BMT QI committee and the KU Biostatistics Department.  Any discrepancy 
will be addressed immediately and will be brought to IRB attention.

APPENDIX D Guidance For Use Of Heparin And Mozobil In Performing Large Volume 
Apheresis  
 
Indications And Usage Of Heparin Anticoagulant  
 
A) Heparin may be used as an anticoagulant additive to ACDA on patients having a stem 
cell collection procedure in certain instances. Guidelines for heparin usage are to be 
determined on each patient by [CONTACT_398]34 assessment and a clinical assessment.  
1) For patients  on anticoagulant therapy, i.e., Coumadin, Lovenox, etc, do not use 
heparin as an anticoagulant.  
2) For patients with heparin induced antibodies, do not use heparin as an 
anticoagulant.  
3) All large volume collections procedures are dependent upon patient’s tolerance for procedure and other clinical/medical conditions, i.e., platelet counts, hypervolemia, 
dialysis, etc.  
 Circulating Peripheral Cd34 Count And Mozobil
® Usage 
 
A) Patients needing cells for one or multiple peripheral stem cell transplants. 2.5 x x106 
CD34/Kg is the desired goal for each transplant.  
1) If the CD34 count is less than 5 cells/ul , do not perform collection   
a. Give 10 mcg/kg G -CSF now.  
b. Administer Mozobil® that evening.  
c. Perform another peripheral CD34 count on the following morning. 
d. If on second day the CD34 count is less than 5 cells/ul , do not perform 
collection.  
e. The physician is to advise on the plan which may include the continuation of 
Mozobi l®. 
2) If the CD34 count is greater than 5 and less than 10 cells/ul , do not perform 
collection   
a. Give G -CSF now.  
b. Administer Mozobil® that evening.  
c. G- CSF will also be given 1 hour pre- collection the following morning, if the 
pre-collection WBC count is < 65K.  
d. Perform a larger volume collection (approximately 5 - 6 blood volumes) 
utilizing heparin/ACDA as th e anticoagulant. Each blood volume processed 
can reduce the patient’s platelet count by 10%. 
3) If the CD34 count is greater than 10 cells/ul, Perform collection as in 2)d. above.  
4) The provider has the discretion to perform a collection outside of this algorithm.  
 
  
  Page [ADDRESS_1162135]  
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_837133], MD  
HSC # STUDY00002857  
Post -Collection Results And Mozobil Usage  
 
A) If on the first day of collection the collected product contains LESS THAN 65% of the 
desired dose, use Mozobil® that evening.  G-CSF will also be given 1 hour pre- collection 
the following morning if the WBC count is <65,000.  
 
B) Goal    65% of goal  
2.5 x 106 CD34/Kg  (<1.63 x 106 CD34/Kg)  
5.0 x 106 CD34/Kg  (<3.25 x 106 CD34/Kg)  
7.5 x 106 CD34/Kg  (<4.88 x 106 CD34/Kg)  
 
Mozobil Dosage And Administration  
 
1) Notify BMT Pharmacist . To reach correct pharmacist call BMT Triage Nurse at 
[PHONE_17436] . The triage nurse will direct the call to the pharmacist.  
2) BMT Pharmacist to consult and write order for use of Mozobil®. 
3) Repeat Mozobil® dose up to 4 consecutive days.  
4) Select dose based on 0.24 mg/kg actual body weight (0.012 X patient’s actual body weight in kg = volume to be administered in mL).  
5) Maximum dose is 24 mg or 1 vial. (1.2 mL of a 20 mg/mL solution).  
6) Administer by [CONTACT_837193] 10 - 14 hours prior to initiation of 
apheresis.  
7) Renal impairment: If creatinine clearance is ≤ 50 mL/min, decrease dose by [CONTACT_31806]- third 
to 0.16 mg/kg.  
 
Adverse Reactions 
A) Most common adverse reactions (≥ 10%): diarrhea, nausea, fatigue , injection site 
reactions, headache, arthralgia, dizziness, and vomiting.

8. PROCEDURE NOTES/LIMITATIONS  
 
A. To ensure that immunoglobulin staining is intrinsic and not extrinsic, CD19 is stained in 
the same tube with Kappa and Lambda.  Also, the specimen is washed with PBS prior to staining to alleviate non- specific binding.
2 
B. The laboratory uses antibodies appropriate for the clinical situation. Pathologists review 
as necessary.  
C. The use of Hyaluronidase has been validated in BAL’s and fluids.  If these specimens are thick and mucoid add a few crystals of Hyaluronidase (found in Hematology’s freezer).   Wait until the sample liquefies then proceed with above procedure.  
D. There are numerous variables that may affect the staining properties or the identification 
of specific cell populations and thus result in inaccurate results.  These include the 
following:  
1. Patient’s disease state or therapy, such as immune- suppressive drugs, may affect 
the normal antibody staining characteristics.  
2. Purity of the gated cell population.  
3. Resolution between the positive and negative populations.  
4. Non-specific staining and auto -fluorescence.  
5. Cell count of population of interest may be too low to collect significant results. 
E. If the CS&T beads do not pass, the instrument should not be operated.  Refer to the 
troubleshooting information in the BD Cytometer Setup and Tracking Application Guide.  
F. If instruments are inoperable:  
a. For analyzer problems, call BD Bioscience at 1 -[PHONE_17437] and log the problem in 
the Action Log with a reference number.   
b. If one instrument is down, use the other instrument only and contact [CONTACT_837207].  
c. If both instruments are down the hematology supervisor or medical staff on call for hematology should be notified at this time.  
d. All testing should be sent to St. Luke’s by [CONTACT_30367].   Call the Flow Lab at St. Luke’s at 
[PHONE_17438] to let them know we are sending specimens. 
e. Have St. Luke’s fax flow cytometry requisition with indication of necessary information to be filled in.  
f. Use St. Luke's courier until 7:00 pm (816 -932-3850).  After hours use KU's courier, 
Quicksilver (321- 5959).  
g. Follow reference lab's protocol for collection and handling of specimens.

Summary of Changes for Revised Protocol Version 5.0 dated 11-21-2016 
 
• Previous Protocol Version 4.0 dated 04- 06-2016  
• Revised Protocol Version 5.0 dated 11- 21-2016  
 
General Comments 
This protocol  version i ncorporates the protocol clarification letter dated 05 -18-2016 
(allows use of filgrastim biosimilar), removes an inclusion criterion, and includes 
administrative updates & clarifications.  
 
Key Protocol Changes: 
Section  Summary of Change  Rationale  
3.1.5  Removed Inclusion Criterion:  
“Creatinine - within normal institutional limits”  Patients with increased 
creatinine/kidney disease 
would not be 
contraindicated for stem 
cell collection.  Bortezomib is the 
preferred myeloma drug 
for patients with kidney 
disease and using 
Bortezomib for mobilization may be of 
benefit for patients  with 
kidney disease.  Patients who meet all other 
enrollment criteria but 
have kidney disease 
and/or increased creatinine should not be 
excluded from the clinical 
trial. 
4.0 Adde d clarification for Treatment Group A & B:  
“Physician discretion will be used to advise on the 
plan which may include the continuation of 
Mozobil.  The provider has the discretion of collection outside the algorithm included in 
Appendix C .” Clarification  
Throughout  
 Added clarification for Adverse Event reporting:  
The s tudy ends 30 days after the participant’s last 
protocol therapy (collection) for the purpose of AE 
reporting.   If a reportable AE occurs within 30 
days after a participant’s collection, recording of concomitant medications should continue until 
resolution of the AE. Clarification - 
The last day should be 
the collection date 
because not all patients 
make it to AutoSCT.  
Throughout  
 Added that Filgrastim G -CSF biosimilar (Zarxio ) 
may/will be substituted for filgrastim  Clarification  
(institutional standard)

Summary of Changes for Revised Protocol Version 4.0 dated 04-06-2016 
 
• Previous Protocol Version 3.0 dated 03- 14-2016  
 
• Revised Protocol Version 4.0 dated 04- 06-2016  
 
General Comments 
This revised protocol version 4.0 dated 04-06-2016, incorporate s the addition of one 
exclusion criterion, a note (repeated in several places in the section on adverse events) 
regarding planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], and a study staff change as listed below:  
 
• Patients who have received more than 6 months of lenalidomide (Revlimid®) therapy 
prior to stem cell collection are excluded from this study.  
• NOTE:   For this study, planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_837138] a Serious 
Adverse Event.  
• Brea Lipe, MD was removed as a sub -investigator  
• Other minor version- related administrative protocol changes were also completed.  
• Changes to the consent form were completed for clarity of standard of care study 
processes related to stem cell collection and timing 
• It is our opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], because the changes clarify study procedures undergone by [CONTACT_141591]; any currently enrolled participants must re- sign this version of 
the consent form after IRB approval.  
 
Key Protocol Changes: 
Section  Summary of Change  Rationale  
3.2 Added Exclusion Criterion –Patients who have 
received more than 6 months of lenalidomide 
(Revlimid®) therapy prior to stem cell collection 
are  excluded from this study.  Excessive exposure to 
Lenalidomide (Revlimid® ) 
prior to stem cell harvest is  
known to adversely affect 
stem cell mobilization. Due 
to that fact, heavily pre-treated patients (   > 6 
months of  Lenalidomide 
exposure) will not be 
included in this trial.  
 
This added excl usion 
increases participant 
safety  
Sections:

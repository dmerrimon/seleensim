discontinued su bject); b) investigator -initiated discontinuation 
(e.g., for cause); c) loss to follow -up: cessation of participation 
without notice or action by [CONTACT_423]; d) sponsor -initiated 
discontinuation. Note that subject discontinuation does not 
necessarily impl y exclusion of subject data from analysis.

Title of Study  Randomized Controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of 
ON101 Cream  for the Treatment of Chronic Diabetic Foot Ulcers  
Study 
Objective(s)  The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the 
new treatment  of ON101 Cream  compared to Aquacel® Hydrofiber® 
dressing, applied to chronic diabetic foot ulcers for up to [ADDRESS_681814] safety information 
including adverse events and clinical laboratory abnormalities.  
Design and 
Methodology  
 This trial is designed as a randomized, evaluator blinded, active -
controlled, multi -center study comparing the efficacy and safety of 
ON101 cream  and Aquacel® Hydrofiber® dressing in the treatment of 
diabetic foot ulcers. An independ ent evaluator s who blinded to 
subjects’ treatment will evaluate whether the wound has healed. 
Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive either ON101 cream  
or Aquacel® Hydrofiber® dressing in a 1:1 allocation. The study 
treatment will be applied to th e selected ulcer for a maximum period 
of 16 weeks, until the wound/ulcer closure (wound size of 0)  for two 
consecutive visits at least [ADDRESS_681815] exited 
the study as treatment failure . After that, all subjects regardless of 
wound h ealing at the end of comparison period will be follow ed for 
12 weeks to investigate durability. During the follow -up period, 
Aquacel® Hydrofiber® dressing will be applied for subjects who have 
unhealed or with recurrent wound.  Each target  ulcer with wound 
photographs for blind assessment will be monitored at each 
scheduled visit.  
Two interim analys es are planned at about  118 and 212 subjects completed 
the comparison period or early withdrawn from study intervention. This 
will be about 50% and 90% of the tot al number of subjects will be 
randomized. T he final analysis will be conducted at the end of the study.  
Number of 
Subjects 
Planned  236 eligible subjects will be randomized; 118 in ON101 cream  group 
and 118 in Aquacel® Hydrofiber® dressing group  
Ensuring a t least 212 subjects.  
Number of 
Study Sites 
Planned  There will be around  15 study centers in Taiwan, US, and China. 
Other countries may be added.

Therapy  Aquacel® Hydrofiber® dressing  
Primary 
Variable  The primary efficacy outcome is the comparison of the incidence of 
complete healing of the target ulcer between the two treatment 
groups at the end of treatment.  
Secondary 
Variables   Time to complete ulcer healing,  
 Percentage change in ulcer surface area from baseline,  
 Percentage of subjects with a 50% reduction of ulcer surface area,  
 Incidence of infection of the target ulcer.  
Safety outcomes  include assessment of the incidence of treatment -
emergent adverse events, clinical laboratory values, and vital signs.  
Exploratory  
Variable  Recurrence of the target ulcer within follow -up period evaluated in 
those subjects who demonstrated complete wound  healing at the end 
of comparison period.  
Statistical 
Methods  The primary efficacy analysis, the rate of complete healing, will be 
based on the logistic regression model for the binary response that 
will be used to test for the differences in the treatmen t efficacy 
between ON101 cream  and Aquacel® Hydrofiber® dressing. The 
logistic model will include treatment group and the following 
prognostic factors: baseline wound size and baseline Wagner grade. 
The comparison between the two treatment groups will be p resented 
in term of the odd ratios, with p -values and associated 95% 
confidence intervals of the odds ratio. Two interim analys es will be 
conducted at about 118 and 212 subjects complete the comparison 
period  or early withdraw from study intervention on a sequential 
basis . This will be about 50% and 90% of the total number of 
subjects that will be randomized.  The final analysis will be conducted 
at the end of study. The futility/superiority of ON101 cream  will be 
assessed  using  the Lan-DeMets approach  which  the boundaries are 
determined by [CONTACT_525323] O’Brien -Fleming spending function.  
The wound size will be compared between groups by [CONTACT_525324] -variance (ANCOVA).  The method of Kaplan and 
Meier will be used to summarize the time to event data . The 
difference in time to complete ulcer healing  between the treatment 
groups will be analyzed by [CONTACT_63450] -rank test.  
For the safety parameters, numerical comparisons between treatment 
groups in adverse events (AEs), vital signs and safety laboratory 
results  based on change from baseline will be provided.

1.1 Background  
Current statistical data from the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and the  World Health 
Organization (WHO) show a dramatic worldwide increase in diabetes mellitus (DM). In 2000, 
nearly 250 million people were affected by [CONTACT_193875]. This  correspond s with a global prevalence that is 
estimated to be 2.8%; a near doubling  of this number -- to 400 million (a projected prevalence of 
4.4%) -- is expected in  the next two decades [1]. Because of its secondary complications, the life 
expectancy  of diabetic p atients is on average 10 years shorter than non -diabetics [2]. Diabetic foot  
ulcer (DFU) is a common secondary complication of DM, with an estimated 15%  of patients with 
diabetes expected to develop a foot ulcer within their lifetime [3].  More importantly,  DFU as the 
most common cause of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_525307] [4], resulting in lower extremity 
amputations in about 15% of cases [3].  
DFUs are the result of various etiological factors and are characterized by [CONTACT_525325] -
repair in a time ly and orderly manner [ 5]. DFU occurs as a consequence of the interaction of 
several contributory factors, which may be divided schematically into intrinsic (neuropathy, 
peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes severity) and extrinsic (wound infection, ca llus 
formation, and excessive pressure to the site) [ 6]. Several studies have examined the risk factors 
for the development of DFU. Most agree that a triad of factors contributes  to ulceration. These 
include the presence of peripheral neuropathy, foot defo rmities, and acute or chronic repetitive 
trauma.  In addition to the triad of risk factors described in the literature, impaired wound healing 
has been implicated as a significant cause for poor healing in the DFU. Other causes of poor 
wound healing in DFU include infection and ischemia.  
The cornerstones of DFU treatment have long been advocated as including: regular debridement, 
wound -pressure off -loading, re -vascularization when appropriate, adequate treatment of infection, 
and wound care. A fundamental to ol in the management of DFU is the assessment of the wound 
area, either by [CONTACT_525326] [7] or through wound tracings 
[7]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_525308], only a portion of ulcers (up to 50%) will be heale d 
after 12 - 20 weeks [7]. Furthermore, compelling evidence suggests that DFU that fail to heal 
within [ADDRESS_681821] [ 8]. 
As a result, treatments that address the underlying structural and functional impairments that 
contribute to prolonged wound healing are being investigated for their diagnostic and therapeutic 
[ADDRESS_681822] cells and by [CONTACT_525327]. The products of TTFCA (total triterpenic fraction of Centella 
asiatica) functioning at wound healing ha d been commercial available in the market.  
Eight pharmacological studies were conducted by [CONTACT_525328], 
Taiwan, to test for the effectiveness and mechanism of action of ON101 . Streptozotocin (STZ) 
was used to induce diabetic animals to establish the ulcer -healing model. In another diabetic 
animal model, db/db rat, ON101  also showed  ulcer -healing effects.  
From the histology study in ulcer tissues, the collagen contents in ulcers treated with the active 
ingredients of ON101  were significantly lower than those treated with placebo. Tissues treated 
with ON101  showed no inflammation and a very thin granulation tissue. In histopathology study, 
the intensities of positive CD71 (the marker of transit amplifying cell and an index of ulcer 
healing signal) in tissues treated with ON101  were significantly higher than those treated with 
placebo. These results revealed that ON101  could enhance cell renovation ability in ulcers.  
Seven GLP -compliant toxicity studies of ON101  were conducted at the Development Center 
for Biotechnology, Taiwan. And under the test conditions used, ON101  did not show any 
abnormal or positive response in three genotoxicity tests. In dermal irritability test, ON101  is 
neither an irritant nor a sensitizer in wounded skin. In acute toxicity study, ON101  drug 
[ZIP_CODE] 925 v6.0                                                       Oneness                                                     Page 16 of 54 substance exerted no adverse toxic effects in Sprague -Dawley (SD) rat s at the dose level up to 
5000 mg/kg via oral route. Oral administration of ON101  drug substance up 3000 mg/kg/day 
to SD rats did not induce any adverse effect during the 28 -day repeating dose study. 
Therefore, the 28 -day NOAEL for rats orally ingesting of  ON101  drug substance is 3000 
mg/kg/day.  
In a clinical research trial conducted at National Taiwan University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_35905] 11 subjects with 
Wagner -grade -3 chronic diabetic foot ulcers, treatment with ON101  for 2 weeks resulted in 
approximately 20% reduction  of wound size  and no serious adverse effects have been reported. Of 
the 1 1 evaluable subjects, the mean wound size  at baseline was 359 mm2 (20 – 2352 m m2), and 
decrease to 293 m m2 after 2 weeks of ON101 . 
Another clinical trial was carried out 30 subjects with Wagner -grade -1 chronic diabetic foot ulcers  
treated with ON101  for up to 12 weeks. The results showed that the incidence of healing by 12 
weeks was 50.0% and the time of 50% subjects reached healing was approximately 10 weeks. Of 
the 30 subjects,  treatment with ON101  for up to 12 weeks resulted in approximately 70% 
reduction of wound size. The average wound size at baseline was 577 mm2 (303 - 1225 mm2), and 
decrease to 163 mm2 for up to 12 weeks of ON101 . 
1.3 Summary of Key Safety Information for Study Dru gs 
Both previous trials did not show any adverse events caused by [INVESTIGATOR_45372]101 , as expected, ON101  
cream  is safe and well tolerated to the subjects with diabetic foot ulcer.  
1.4 Rationale for Trial Design  
New treatments that improve the number of ulcers that heal and /or speed up healing are urgently 
needed. The main purpose of our clinical trial is to demonstrate superiority of ON101  vs. 
Aquacel® Hydrofiber® in wound healing. Previous studies with ON101  showed that ON101  is 
associated with wound size reduction and imp roved healing rate. However, these studies were not 
adequately powered for wound healing rate as primary endpoint. This comparative study is 
importan t because the results may inform the choice in managing the DFU. The proposed study 
will provide 1 6 weeks d ata on wound healing rate in order to demonstrate superior benefits of 
ON101  compared to Aquacel® Hydrofiber® dressing on a clinically important outcome. Clinical 
healing and safety will be compared in diabetic patients with Wagner Grade 1 or 2 DFUs 
manage d with either of two primary treatments: ON101  cream  or Aquacel® Hydrofiber® dressing, 
both used within similar standard care including appropriate lower extremity off -loading.

2.[ADDRESS_681823] ive of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the new treatment of ON101 
cream  compared to Aquacel® Hydrofiber® dressing applied to chronic diabetic foot ulcers for up 
to [ADDRESS_681824] safety information including adverse events and 
clinical laboratory abnormalities.  
2.2 Study Design and Dose Rationale  
2.2.1 Study Design  and Rationale  
This trial is designed as a randomized, evaluator blinded, active -controlled, multi -center study 
comparing the efficacy and safety of  ON101 cream  and Aquacel® Hydrofiber® dressing in the 
treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. An independent evaluator s who blinded to subjects’ treatment 
will evaluate whether the wound has healed, defined as epi[INVESTIGATOR_525309]. Subject with 
Type 1 or 2 d iabetes mellitus (DM) and with Wagner Grade 1 or 2 diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) of 
neuropathic or neuro -ischemic etiology will be included in this study. If there is more than one 
ulcer on the foot, the most severity then largest ulcer that confirmed to the i nclusion/exclusion 
criteria will be selected for study evaluation. Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive either 
ON101 cream  or Aquacel® Hydrofiber® dressing in a 1:1 allocation. The study treatment will be 
applied to the selected ulcer for a maxi mum period of 1 6 weeks, until the wound/ulcer closure 
(wound size of 0)  for two consecutive visits at least [ADDRESS_681825] exited the 
study as treatment failure. After that, all subjects regardless of wound healing at the end of 
compar ison period will be follow ed for 12 weeks to investigate durability. During the follow -up 
period, Aquacel® Hydrofiber® will be applied for subjects who have unhealed or with recurrence 
wound.  Each target ulcer with wound photographs for blind assessment wi ll be monitored at each 
scheduled visit.  
Two interim analyses  will be conducted  at around 50% and 90% of study information; the final 
analysis will be conducted at the end of the study. The futility/superiority of ON101 cream  will be 
assessed using the Lan -DeMets method with O’Brien -Fleming  spending boundaries.  
2.2.2 Dose Rationale  
The study treatment, ON101  (1.25%),  will be applied two times daily . Data of preclinical 
studies using active components and ON101  can well justify the recommended dosing regimen of 
this study. In a sub -acute repeating dose study, the results indicated that SD rats ingested ON101  
drug substance at 3000 mg/kg for [ADDRESS_681826] to be nonirritant and does not cause any erythema or edema.  
Aquacel® Hydrofiber® dressing (ConvaTec) is a moisture retention dressing that consists of soft 
non-woven sodium carboxymethyl cellulose fi bers which form a gel on contact [CONTACT_525329]. 
Dressings will be changed daily, on alternate days or three times a week according to need, but 
not longer than [ADDRESS_681827] 2 weeks and is confirmed by a blinded 
independent evaluator . 
2.3.2 Secondary Variables  
The secondary efficacy outcomes are:  
 Time to complete ulcer healing,  
 The time of the origin al healing will be taken as the time to healing.  
 Percentage change in ulcer surface area from baseline,  
 Percentage of subjects with a 50% reduction of ulcer surface area,  
 Incidence of infection of the target ulcer.  
Safety outcomes include assessment of the  incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events, 
clinical laboratory values, and vital signs.

5.2 Dosing and Administration of Study Treatment s and Other 
Medications  
5.2.1 Dose/Dose Regimen and Administration Period  
The investigator will select the treatment area for each subject  at the baseline visit. During the 
treatment period, subject  will apply the study medication  (ON101 cream ) to the selected 
treatment area only.  The study cream  will be applied two times daily for a maximum period of 1 6 
weeks, until the wound/ulcer closure (wound size of 0)  for two consecutive visits at least [ADDRESS_681839] exited the study as lack of efficacy satisfactory (defined as a 
worsening of Wagner grade to level of 3).  
The surface area of  the ulcer will be estimated at each clinical visit in the following manner. 
Length is the longest edge -to-edge measurement of the ulcer; width is taken from a perpendicular 
axis to the length.  The study drugs will be applied in an amount to fully cover th e ulcer area. The 
maximum amount of ON101 cream  applied on the wound must not exceed 2 millimeter in 
thickness (or 1 cc for ulcer size of 5cm2). The investigator/study coordinator  will give a 
demonstration and will train the patients how to apply the medic ation at each clinical visit.  
Aquacel® dressing offers the unique gelling action of Hydrofiber® technology that absorbs and 
locks in exudate and bacteria. It provides excellent absorption and retention capabilities for 
moderate to highly exuding wounds, co nfirms to the wound surface to form an intimate contact, 
support ing wound healing by [CONTACT_1541] a moist wound healing environment. The Aquacel® 
Hydrofiber® dressing will be left in place for up to 7 days or changed earlier, depending on the 
extent of the ex udate produced by [CONTACT_525335].  
Both treatment groups will be covered by [CONTACT_525336], and subjects received 
accommodative footwear for non -plantar ulcers and off -loading for plantar ulcers to relieve the 
pressure from the ulcerated foot; the produ cts used are not specified.

If the administration of any concomitant treatment becomes necessary, it must be reported in the 
case report form and in the subject's medical records. As far as possible, minimum changes (dose, 
frequency ) should be made to the concomitant treatment during the study. However, concomitant 
medications should be kept to a minimum during the study. The sponsor must be consulted if 
there is any doubt, and a decision to withdraw the subject must be made jointly by [CONTACT_525337].

5.3 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
5.3.1 Demographics  
The following demographic data will be collected at scre ening.  
[ZIP_CODE] 925 v6.0                                                       Oneness                                                     Page 30 of 54  Sex

 Ankle -brachial index on target foot, determined by [CONTACT_525339]  
 Diabetes type and duration  
 History of previous medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (within  4 weeks prior randomization)  
 History of smoking and alcohol use  
Baseline characteristics will be collected at Screening or on Day 1 (before administration of study 
intervention) in accordance with the schedule as detailed in the Schedule of Assessments.  
5.3.2 Medical History  
A complete medical history will be recorded in the source documents and CRF. All details 
(including information related to the duration, i.e., the number of months or years), especially 
those regarding chronic and recurring illness will be r ecorded on the medical history page with 
special emphasis on medical history of the last 12 months prior to randomization. In addition, the 
following history on chronic complications will be collected separately: coronary artery disease 
(CAD), diabetic neu ropathy (DN), diabetic kidney disease (DKD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), 
diabetic peripheral arterial disease (PAD).  
5.3.3 Diagnosis of the Target Disease, Severity, and Duration of Disease  
Please refer to “Diabetic Foot Disorders: A Clinical Practice Guideline ( 2006 revision)” as 
Appendix 1.  
The following target ulcer characteristics should be collected before randomization:  
 Duration of diabetic foot ulcer  
 Ulcer severity (Wagner grade)  
 Ulcer etiology (Neuropathic, Neuro -ischemic)  
 Ulcer location (Plantar, Non -plantar) 
Although no single system has been universally adopted, the classification system most often used 
was described and popularized by [CONTACT_200800]. In the Wagner system, foot lesions are divided into six 
grades based on the depth of the wound and extent of tis sue necrosis.  
Grade 0: No open lesion, may have deformity or cellulitis  
Grade 1: Superficial ulcer  
Grade 2: Deep ulcer to tendon or joint capsule  
Grade 3: Deep ulcer with abscess, osteomyelitis, or joint sepsi s 
Grade 4: Local gangrene – forefoot or heel  
Grade 5: Gangrene of entire foot  
[ZIP_CODE] 925 v6.0                                                       Oneness                                                     Page 31 of 54 The major aetiologies of DFUs are neuropathy (nerve damage), neuroischaemia and peripheral 
vascular (arterial) disease. Some 40 –70% of DFUs are caused by [CONTACT_525340], 15 –24% by 
[CONTACT_525341] 15 –45% by [CONTACT_525342].  
The neuropathic foot is typi[INVESTIGATOR_525311]. The 
skin may be anyhdrotic (dry) and prone to fissuring and callosities. Ulcers often occur on the 
plantar surface, principally under the metatarsal heads in the forefoot. They are round and 
surrounded by [CONTACT_525343].  
The neuroischaemic foot is typi[INVESTIGATOR_525312], characterized by 
[CONTACT_525344]. The skin is usually atrophic, anyhdrotic and shiny. Hair growth 
is often mi nimal and atrophy of the subcutaneous tissues is apparent. Ischaemic ulcers often occur 
on the digits and heels, and are usually dry with vertical walls. Necrotic tissue may be present.

[CONTACT_525345] 2 weeks after study intervention until wound 
closure (wound size of 0) has  confirmed [ADDRESS_681842] 2 weeks and is confirmed by  a blinded 
independent evaluator . At each clinic visit after study intervention, digital photographs should be 
taken of study wound after the area had been carefully shaved to visualize t he wound margin and 
for better visualization of epi[INVESTIGATOR_525313].  
5.5 Safety Assessment  
5.5.1 Vital Signs  
Vital signs (including temperature, blood pressure, heart rate and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], all measured 
after 5 minutes in the sitting po sition) and weight will be taken at each scheduled visit or early 
permanently discontinued study intervention. The subject’s height will be recorded at the baseline 
visit. Significant adverse changes in vital signs occurring after the subject randomized in to this 
study will be recorded as adverse events.  
[ADDRESS_681843] of laboratory evaluations to be performed during the c ourse of the study 
according to the local laboratory instructions.  
Hematology:  hemoglobin, white blood cell (WBC) count total and differential, platelet count, red 
blood cell (RBC)  
Biochemistry:  glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), serum glutamyl -oxaloacetic trans aminase (AST), 
serum glutamic -pyruvic transaminase (ALT), albumin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 
fasting plasma glucose  
Urine or serum pregnancy test will be performed on women with child bearing potential at 
screening visit.  
Note: According  to th e changing of regional practice , the BUN test  can’t be conducted in local 
laboratory  in Mainland China . The BUN test  will be waived in Mainland China.  
5.5.4 Physical Examination  
A physical examination including vascular, neurological, and musculoskeletal status will be 
performed at screening, baseline visit, each bi -weekly visit (during comparative period), and 
scheduled visits during follow -up period.  
5.5.5 Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
An ECG will be performed at screening, week 16 and week 28  or early permanently di scont inued

The foot X -ray will be performed at screening visit.  
5.6 Adverse Events and Other Safety Aspects  
5.6.1 Definition of Adverse Events (AEs)  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered  a 
study treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An 
AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or 
not related to the study treatment.  
An abnormality identified during a medical test (e.g., laboratory parameter, vital sign, ECG data, 
physical exam) should be defined as an AE only if the abnormality meets one of the follo wing 
criteria:  
 Induces clinical signs or symptoms  
 Requires active intervention  
 Requires interruption or discontinuation of study treatment  
 The abnormality or investigational value is clinically significant in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070].  
Beginning when  the subject randomized, the investigator will closely monitor each subject for 
evidence of treatment intolerance and for the development of clinical or laboratory evidence of 
adverse events.  
Whenever possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symp toms are due to a common 
etiology (e.g., cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as 
“upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]”).  
5.6.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
A serious AE is any untoward medical occurrence that at  any dose:  
 Results in death,  
 Is life threatening (an event in which the <subject> is at risk of death at the time of the event; 
it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more 
severe),  
 Results in persistent or sign ificant disability/incapacity,  
 Results in congenital anomaly, or birth defect,  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28939] (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_525314]/observation/examination caused by [CONTACT_525346] s).  
 Other medically important events.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -
[ADDRESS_681844] or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These events, 
including those that may result in disability, should also usually be considered seriou s. Examples 
of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
The cause of death of a subject  in a clinical study, whether or not the event is expected or 
associated with the investigational agent, is considered a serious adverse event. Any event 
requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) that occurs during the course of a 
subject ’s participation in a clinical study must be reported as a serious adverse event.  
5.6.3 Criteria for Causal Relationship to the Study Treatment  
The investigator will also evaluate the relationship of each adverse event to study intervention 
according to  the definitions as follows. Adverse events that fall under either  “Unlikely ”, 
"Possible" or "Probable" or "Definitely"  should be defined as "adverse events whose relationship 
to the study treatments could not be ruled out".  
 Not related:  Adverse reactions associated with drug usage are clearly not related.  
 Unlikely:  Adverse reactions and drug usage on the timing is not reasonable (but 
not impossible), and the patients ' own illness or medicines (chemicals) 
indicated more reasonable explanation for this eve nt. 
 Possible:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
sequence to administration of the drug, but which could also be explained by 
[CONTACT_9153]. Information on drug 
withdrawal may b e lacking or unclear.  
 Probable:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent 
disease or other drugs or chemicals, and which follows a clinic ally reasonable 
response on re -administration (rechallenge) or withdrawal (dechallenge).  
 Definitely : Adverse reaction associated with medication usage is time sequential, 
which is credible and cannot be reasonably counted to the patients ' own 
illness or medicines (chemicals). The reaction after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_525315], as 
well as precise pharmacological phenomena or disease state, it appears 
similar reaction if re -dosing.  
5.6.[ADDRESS_681845] with 3 grades is to be used to measure the severity of adverse events, 
including abnormal clinical laboratory values.  
[ZIP_CODE] 925 v6.0                                                       Oneness                                                     Page 35 of 54  Mild:   No disruption of normal daily activities  
 Moderate:  Affect normal daily activit ies 
 Severe:   Inability to perform daily activities  
5.6.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
In the case of a serious adverse event (SAE), the investigator must contact [CONTACT_106374] (within  [ADDRESS_681846] possible time 
point).  
Information regarding serious adverse events will be transmitted to the sponsor using the Serious 
Adverse Event Form, which must be signed by [CONTACT_1697]. The initial report of a serious adverse 
event may be made by [CONTACT_6968] . It is preferable that serious adverse events be reported via email . A 
report of a serious adverse event must be followed by a completed Serious Adverse Event Form 
from the investigator.  
In addition, the suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) should also forward to 
IRB and health authority by [CONTACT_525347].  
5.6.6 Follow -up to Adverse Events  
All adverse events occurring during the study are to be followed up until resolved or judg ed to be 
no longer clinically significant, or until they become chronic to the extent that they can be fully 
characterized (all follow -up results are to be reported to the sponsor).  
Since it is unpredictable how long such a follow -up will take, data from t his follow -up generated 
after the subject's post study visit will be recorded by [CONTACT_093]. Full details regarding this 
follow -up will be described in the study report, whenever necessary.  
If during adverse event follow -up, the adverse event progres ses to an "SAE", or if a subject 
experiences a new SAE whose relationship to the study drug(s) cannot be ruled out, the 
investigator must immediately report the information to the sponsor.  
Even if the subject does not return to normal or to his or her pre vious state, the follow -up can be 
considered finished when the following procedures have been taken:  
 The investigator judges that the follow -up of the subject concerned is no longer necessary 
based on the progress made during the follow -up,  
 The reason fo r such a judgment is entered as a comment on the case report form for the 
follow -up, and  
 The sponsor judges that the reason is acceptable with regard to the safety of the subject 
concerned.  
[ADDRESS_681847] of the Study  
When new information necessary for conducting the clinical study properly is obtained, the 
sponsor should inform all investigators involved in the clinical study, IRB/IEC, as well as the 
regulatory authorities of such information, and when needed, should amend the subject 
information, written informed consent form and/or protocol on the matters covering the quality of 
the study drug, efficacy and safety, information necessary for conducting the clinical study 
properly, or documents to b e examined by [CONTACT_525348].  
5.6.[ADDRESS_681848] not deviate from or amend the protocol, excluding an emergency case 
for avoiding risks t o the subjects. When the investigator does not follow the protocol in order 
to avoid urgent risks for subjects, the investigator should take the following actions.  
 Describe the contents of the deviation or amendment and the reasons for it in a written not ice, 
and immediately send the document stating the deviation or amendment and the reasons to 
the sponsor and the head of the study site. Keep a copy of the notice.  
 Consult with the sponsor at the earliest possibility for cases in which it is necessary to a mend 
the protocol. Obtain approval for a draft of the amended protocol from the IRB and the head 
of the study site as well as written approval from the sponsor.

 When the sponsor is aware of information on matters concerning the quality, efficacy, and 
safety of the study drugs, as well as other important information that may affect proper 
conduct of the clinical study, the sponsor may discontinue the clinical study and send a 
written notice of the discontinuation al ong with the reasons to the investigator.  
 If an investigator intends to discontinue participation in the study, the investigator must 
immediately inform the sponsor of the discontinuation and the reason for it.   
[ZIP_CODE] 925 v6.0                                                       Oneness                                                     Page 38 of 54 7 STATISTICAL METHODOL OGY  
7.1 Sample Size  
The re cent phase 2 clinical trial was carried out 30 subjects with Wagner -grade -1 chronic diabetic 
foot ulcers  treated with ON101  for up to 12 weeks. The results showed that the incidence of 
healing by 12 weeks was 50% and the time of 50% subjects reached healin g was approximately 
10 weeks. Of the 30 subjects,  treatment with ON101  for up to 12 weeks resulted in approximately 
70% reduction of wound size. The average wound size at baseline was 577 mm2 (303 - 1225 
mm2), and decrease to [ADDRESS_681849] based on the incidence of complete 
healing of the target ulcer between the two treatment groups within 1 6 weeks. The ON101 cream  
will be considered  to be effective if the complete healing rate is superior to the corresponding 
endpoint of the Aquacel® Hydrofiber® dressing at two-sided 5% significance  level . The 
hypothesized complete healing rate difference between two treatment groups is 20%, assuming 
the rates are 50% for ON101 cream  and 30 % for Aquacel® Hydrofiber® dressing. This study is 
also planned two interim and 1 final analys is at around  50%, 90%, and 100% of study information, 
and the futility/superiority of ON101 cream  will be assessed using the Lan -DeMets alpha -
spending approach wi th an O’Brien -Fleming boundary . 
Under the assumption  described above and with a 1:[ADDRESS_681850] 80% power to detect a 
significant difference in complete healin g rate using  a 2-sided alternative at the 5%  nominal 
significance level.  Assuming the non-evaluability rate is 10%, a total of 236 subjects ( 118 
subjects for ON101 cream  and 118 subjects for Aquacel® Hydrofiber® dressing) will be enrolled 
into this trial. 
7.2 Analysis Set s 
In accordance with ICH recommendations in guidelines E3 and E9, the following analysis sets 
will be used for the analyses. Detailed statistical analysis information will be provided separately 
in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
7.2.1 Full Anal ysis Set (FAS)  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) principal will be applied on the “full analysis set (FAS)”.  The FAS 
includes all subjects who are randomized, irrespective of actual receipt of study intervention. This 
set will be the primary analyses population f or all efficacy data. Under the ITT principle, all 
participants once randomized are analyzed according to the condition to which they were 
originally assigned, regardless of adherence with the protocol or the occurrence of adverse events. 
Thus, using the I TT principle, participants who were randomly assigned to the ON101 cream  
group but who received partial or none of the ON101 cream , would still be followed and analyzed 
[ZIP_CODE] 925 v6.0                                                       Oneness                                                     Page 39 of 54 as if the participant received the ON101 cream . Participants randomly assigned to the A quacel®  
Hydrofiber®  dressing group but who received the ON101 cream  would be retained in the 
Aquacel®  Hydrofiber®  dressing group and analyzed as if they received only the Aquacel®  
Hydrofiber®  dressing.   
7.2.2 Safety Analysis Set (SAF)  
The “safety analysis set (S AF)” will include all randomized patients who received study 
intervention  to the selected treatment area. This set will be used for the analyses of safety data.  
Safety will be assessed according to the treatment subjects actually received at least one dose  of 
ON101 cream  or Aquacel® Hydrofiber® dressing . 
7.2.3 Supportive Analysis Population   
Subjects in FAS with eligible target ulcer at baseline will be included as modified ITT (mITT) 
population. mITT will be used for supportive analyses of efficacy data as appro priate.  
7.3 Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics  
The demographics and baseline wound characteristics (ulcer severity, etiology, location and size) 
of subjects will be collected at screening period or Day  1 (before study intervention applied). 
These  variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_525349]. For 
continuous variables, the number, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum 
values will be presented. Besides, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test will also  be performed 
for continuous variables to test the comparability for two randomized groups.  
For categorical variables, the numbers and percentages of subjects in each class will be listed, and 
the Fisher’s exact test for two treatment group comparison wil l also be performed.  
7.[ADDRESS_681851] 2 weeks  and is  confirmed by a blinded independent 
evaluator . 
This will be a multi -center study. It is anticipated that the number of participating centers can be 
large and the number of subjects enrolled a t each center could be small. As a result, the data from 
all centers will be pooled for statistical analyses.  
The hypothesis for the comparison is given as follows:  
H0:  The healing rates on ON101 cream  and Aquacel® Hydrofiber® dressing are the same  
H1:  The healing rates on ON101 cream  and Aquacel® Hydrofiber® dressing are not the same  
[ZIP_CODE] 925 v6.0                                                       Oneness                                                     Page 40 of 54 The number of percentage of subjects achieving the efficacy endpoints will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_525350]101 cream  group will be compared to the Aquacel® Hydrofiber® dressing  group with 
Chi-square test. The logistic regression model with treatment/intervention as fixed factor, and 
baseline wound size and Wagner grade as covariates will be applied to the primary analysis of 
primary endpoint. The results of the logistic regressi on model will be presented in term s of the 
odd ratio ( ON101 cream  versus Aquacel® Hydrofiber® dressing ), with p -values and associated 
95% confidence intervals of the odds ratio.  
The test intervention ( ON101 cream ) will be concluded to be superior to the co ntrol ( Aquacel® 
Hydrofiber® dressing ) in average if the null hypothesis (H 0) is rejected and the odds ratio higher 
than 1. To reflect the interim analysis, final analyses will be based on a Type I error rate (two -
sided) of  0.039611 . 
7.4.2 Analysis of Secondary V ariables  
The secondary efficacy variables will be analyzed using FAS population.  
 Time to complete ulcer healing:  
Time to complete ulcer healing will be calculated for all subjects from the day of the first study 
medication applied until the day that origi nal healing of target ulcer is first observed. Subjects 
who could not achieve complete ulcer healing at the last evaluation time point will be censored 
(non-healing) at the date of last evaluation. The median time to complete ulcer healing will be 
estimate d by [CONTACT_5263] -Meier method and two -sided 95% confidence interval will be reported. 
The log -rank test will be performed for comparing time to complete ulcer healing among two 
groups.  
 Percentage change in ulcer surface area from baseline:  
Summary statistics of  the measured wound size and the percentage change from baseline will 
be obtained for each group by [CONTACT_525351].  
For the analysis on the ulcer surface area,  the percentage change fr om baseline at each visit 
will be calculated using the actual wound size.  The wound size percentage change will be 
compared between groups by [CONTACT_525352] -variance (ANCOVA) adjusted with 
baseline measurement of sizes and baseline Wagner grade.  
 Percentage of subjects with a 50% reduction of ulcer surface area:  
The proportion of subjects who achieve 50% reduction of wound size from baseline to interim 
visit will be calculated for two groups and analyzed by a logistic regression model with 
treatment  as factor, and baseline wound size and Wagner grade as covariates.  
 Incidence of infection of the target ulcer:  
[ZIP_CODE] 925 v6.0                                                       Oneness                                                     Page 41 of 54 The incidence of infection of the target ulcer will be summarized and tabulated by [CONTACT_525353]. The incid ence of infection of target ulcer 
between two groups will be compared using Fisher’s exact test.  
7.4.3 Analysis of Exploratory  Variables  
The exploratory  variable will be analyzed for those subjects whose target ulcer complete healed at 
the end of comparative per iod, the recurrences  of target ulcer within 3 -month follow -up period 
will be  compared between two groups by  [CONTACT_3493]’s exact test.  
7.5 Analysis of Safety  
Adverse events will be regarded as Treatment Emergent (TEAE) if they started on or after the 
date and time o f administration of the first dose of study intervention or if they were present prior 
to the administration of the first dose of study intervention and increased in severity during the 
study.  
Adverse Events (AEs) will be coded using the standard Medical D ictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) dictionary and grouped by [CONTACT_525354]. TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_483033], by [CONTACT_525355]. If appropriate, the incidence of adverse events (preferred terms 
and system organ class) will be compared for each of the two treatment groups using Fisher’s 
exact test.  
For the clinical laboratory and vital signs data, the data will be tabulated by [CONTACT_525356]; descriptive statistics to be 
provided include: n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum. The differences 
between groups will be analyzed by [CONTACT_144406] (ANCOVA) with facto r being fitted 
for treatment, and baseline value fitted as a covariate. Subjects with laboratory data outside the 
normal range will be listed and abnormal values will be flagged.  
7.6 Interim Analysis (and Early Discontinuation of the Clinical 
Study)  
7.6.1 Early Disc ontinuation  
The Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC)  will review the results of the interim 
analysis for a possible early termination of the trial. The statutes of the IDMC  will be defined in 
advance and will be included in a separate charter. To a void possible bias, unless a decision is

Two Interim Analyses  will be conducted when  118, and 212 subjects complete  the comparison 
period or early withdraw from study intervention on a sequential basis.  This will be about 50% 
and 90% of the total number of subjects that will be randomized.  
The independ ent Data Monitoring Committee (I DMC) will review the results of the  interim 
analyses for a possible early termination of the trial due to an overwhelming efficacy results based 
on pre -defined alpha specified based on O’Brien -Fleming alpha -spending function specified in 
this protocol and detailed in the Statistical Analysi s Plan(SAP). The statutes of the IDMC will be 
defined in advance and will be included in a separate charter.  
The  Lan and DeMets version (Lan and DeMets, 1983) of the O’Brien -Fleming alpha -spending 
function is used to calculate the Type I Error rate alpha , to maintain the trial -wise 5% type I error. 
Because the 1st interim analysis  has been conucted at 124 subjects who complete the comparision 
period, the alpha boundary will be estimated base on 53%  information for the 1st interim analysis.  
The proporti on of the overall number of target subjects (a total of 236 subjects) included in the 
analyses at each point and alpha boundaries used to assess significance at each analysis are as 
follows.  
Analysis number  % of randomized 
subjects  Alpha Boundary

[ADDRESS_681854] all protocol -required data in the provided Case Report 
Form (CRF). In the interest of collecting data in the most efficient manner, the investigator or site 
designee sh ould record data (including laboratory values, if applicable) onto the CRF as soon as 
possible after the subject visit. CRFs and any supporting documents should be available for 
retrieval by [CONTACT_456]/delegated CRO at any given time. The investigator sho uld keep a copy of 
the CRFs and submit the original CRFs to the sponsor/delegated CRO.  
The monitor should verify the data in the CRFs with source documents to confirm that there are 
no inconsistencies between them. If the monitor finds no inconsistencies, the appropriate CRFs 
are collected.  
If any inconsistency is detected on the collected CRFs, the monitor or data manager should query 
the investigator/sub -investigator using the query resolution form. Resolution of the query should 
be prepared by [CONTACT_8647]/sub -investigator or site designee and provided to the sponsor.  
The monitor should verify the revised data of the CRFs with source documents and confirm that 
there are no inconsistencies between them, and also check that appropriate records on the 
correction/addition of data are maintained.  
For screening failures, the minimum demographic data (sex, age, race and screening date) and 
reason for screening failure will be collected in screening failure log (SFL), if applicable.  
The investigator is respo nsible to ensure that all data in the CRFs, and data correction report are 
accurate, complete and legible, and that all entries are verifiable with source documents. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_525316].

The sponsor will establish all the duties related  to the clinical study before requesting 
implementation of the study by [CONTACT_525363].  
10.1  Independent Data -Monitoring Committee (IDMC)  
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be formed to evalu ate the outcome 
and safety and tolerability issues that may arise during the conduct of the study according to 
the IDMC Charter. The IDMC will consist of [ADDRESS_681863] safety and to preserve the integrity of the trial. Independence is essential to ensure that 
IDMC members are objective and capable of an unbiased assessment of the trial‘s safety and 
efficacy data.  
The IDMC  will review  two formal interim efficacy and safety analyses  at the time when the 
118 and 212 subjects ( 50% and 90% of the total number of randomized subjects ) have 
completed the comparison period or early withdrawn from study intervention.  During the 
randomized portion of the study, the trial may be stopped early if the ON101 cream  arm 
appears to be insufficiently efficacious, significantly more efficacious, or if there are 
unacceptable toxicities.  
The critical nature of interim decision me ans that the investigators and the sponsor must 
provide complete, timely and accurate interim data. Following the interim review, the IDMC  
will forward to the sponsor its recommendation regarding whether to continue the study as 
planned.  
Apart from these f ormal interim analyses, the IDMC  may periodically monitor the overall 
safety results. To avoid possible bias, unless a decision is made to terminate the trial, the 
IDMC  will not disclose any results other than the recommendation to continue the trial.  
10.2 Inde pendent Evaluator  
An independent evaluator  who is blind ed to subjects ’ treatment will evaluate the wound 
healing status, especially on epi[INVESTIGATOR_525309], that may arise during the conduct  of the 
study . The independent evaluator  who will be  from outsi de of the sponsor company and 
outside of the study sites (investigators), and is an expert  in th e respective disciplines of the 
fields of clinical medicine, in particular expertise related to the disease being studied.  
[ADDRESS_681864] background data (eg, gender, age)  and the time of photo . The 
photographs  will be re -labeled according to the randomization list for photos  before they are 
sent to the  independent evaluator  for evaluation . The randomization pr ocess will also ensure 
that the  independent evaluator  does not receive the time sequence on photographs  of the same 
subject consecutively.

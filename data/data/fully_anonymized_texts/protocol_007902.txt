VAULT EVALUATION  AFTER  IMPLANTATION OF AN IMPLANTABLE COLLAMER LENS 
 
 
INTRODUCTION  
The i mplantable collamer lens (ICL) is  a lens designed to correct mid to high degrees of refractive error 
that is implanted in the posterior chamber of a phakic eye .  ICLs are a better alternative than older 
lenses designed to be placed in the  anterior chamber because they pose a lower risk of endothelial cell 
loss and are also more cosmetically appealing, since they are less visible externally.  
 Collamer lenses are made off a blend of a polymer and collagen making it highly permeable to oxygen and nutrients to prevent the lens from interfering with the exchanges of nutrients between the crystalline lens and the aqueous and therefore prevent the ca taract formation after implantation. Over 
the years , it became clear that the permeability of the lenses was not enough to prevent potential 
complications such as pi[INVESTIGATOR_350447], peripheral anterior synechia, pupi[INVESTIGATOR_32465], glaucoma and 
the cataract formation
1, which would also occur as the result of the contact [CONTACT_782033].  In order to further avoid the cataract formation, specially the ASCC1 – considered to be 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_782031]2 - the lenses went through design modifications and the latest model had 
the posterior face concavity increased aiming to completely vault the anterior crystalline lens capsule, resting only on the anterior zonular fibers.
[ADDRESS_1075266] the vault size more objectively, with the use of devices such as anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS -OCT), Pentacam or ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM), still there is no gold 
standard  to do so, and studies have already shown that indeed the measurements can differ among 
different techniques.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the vault after implantation of an implantable collamer lens (ICL) with the use of anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS -OCT), Pentacam and ultrasound 
biomicroscopy (UBM) to assess the following measurem ents: anterior chamber depth (ACD), horizontal 
white to white (WTW), sulcus to sulcus (STS ), and angle to angle (ATA).

after clinical observations, the investigator feels that it may be unwise to continue the study, he 
may stop the study.  
 
E. Study Completion: The study will be complete when all enrolled patients have completed Visit [ADDRESS_1075271] 
deviation of the outcome measure which we do not know; therefore, we consider this study a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251].  When estimating the sample size for a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the simplest method  is to apply a 
sample size rule of thumb. Browne6 suggests a general flat rule to ‘use at least 30 subjects or 
greater to estimate a parameter’.  Allowing 10 % for an assumed dropout rate , a total of [ADDRESS_1075272] descriptive statistics and other tests as deemed appropriate 
based on the characteristics of the data to be analyzed. All statistical tests will be two -sided and 
interpreted at a 5% significance level.  Data analysis will be conducted by a third -party  
consultant.  
  
C. Study Endpoints:

8. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT  
 A. Description  
The already FDA approved EVO ICL and EVO TICL lens es (Implantable Collamer® Lens) are  intraocular 
implant s manufactured from Collamer®,  a proprietary hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA)/porcine 
collagen containing biocompatible polymer material. The EVO  ICL lens contains a UV absorber made 
from a UV absorbing material. The lens features a plate -haptic design with a  central convex/concave 
optical zone and a 0.36 mm diameter central port; the lens incorporates a forward vault to  minimize 
contact [CONTACT_782036].  While the parent devices (non -EVO/non -central 
port Visian MICL lens and Visian TICL lens) require preoperative  peripheral iridotomies (PIs) to 
facilitate aqueous flow, the EVO/EVO+ ICL lenses include a central port that allows the  flow of 
aqueous humor through the lens, thus eliminating the need for PIs prior to implantation.   
 The EVO ICL lens features an optic diameter that varies with the dioptric power; the smallest optic diameter being  4.9mm and the largest 6.1mm. The EVO ICL lens is capable of being folded and 
inserted into the posterior chamber  through an incision of 3.5mm or less. The EVO ICL lens is 
intended to be placed entirely within the posterior chamber  directly behind the iris and in front of 
the anterior capsule of the human crystalline lens. When correctly positioned, the EVO ICL lens 
functions as a refractive ele ment to optically reduce moderate to high myopia with or without 
astigmatism.  
 
B. Treatment/Dosing Regimen 
The EVO non -toric ICL is  indicated to correct  myopia with spherical equivalent (SE) ranging from - 3.0 
D to ≤ -15.[ADDRESS_1075275] .   Additionally, t he EVO toric ICL (TICL)  is indicated for 
the correction of myopic astigmatism with SE ranging from - 3.0 D to ≤- 15.0 D (in the spectacle 
plane) with cylinder (spectacle plane) of 1.0 D to 4.0 D. 2. for the reduction of myopic astigmatism 
with SE ranging from greater than - 15.0 D to - 20.0 D (in the spectacle plane) with cylinder (spectacle 
plane)1.0 D to 4.0 D. 3.  
 
Both lenses are intended to be used in patients ( between 21 and 45 years of age ) with an anterior 
chamber depth (ACD) of 3.00 mm or greater, when measured from the corneal endothelium to the anterior surface of the crystalline lens and a stable refractive history (within 0.5 D for both spherical equivalent and cylinder for 1 year prior to implantation).  The lenses are intended to be  placed in 
the posterior chamber (ciliary sulcus) of the phakic eye.

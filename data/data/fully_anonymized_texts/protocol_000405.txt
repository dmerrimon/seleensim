Promoting informed decisions about rescheduling colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_560411] -19 (PRIMED -2): randomized controlled trial  
 
FUNDING

VERSION DATE  
January 6, [ADDRESS_736629] a 
significant impac t on cancer mortality rates. There is very limited data examining patients’ attitudes and 
concerns about seeking cancer screening in this environment. The aims of this study are to:  
 
Aim 1 : Assess anxiety, COVID risk tolerance , cancer worry, willingness to screen , barriers to  
colonoscopy, and preference for alternative colon cancer screening options for patients  aged 45 -75 who 
had their  screening or surveillance  colonoscopy delayed due to the pandemic .   
 
Aim 2:  Examine effectiveness of using a shared decision making approach with patients on the 
waitlist to decide about rescheduling their colonoscopy. We will randomly assign  patients to receive 
SDM tools or usual care. We will test hypotheses that compared to the control group, patients in 
intervention arm will (a) report higher shared decision making; (b) have stronger intention to follow 
through with colon cancer screening (whether colonoscopy, stool -based test or other approach); and (c) 
have less decisional conflict.  
 
Aim 3:  Follow all  patients on the waitlist and examine wait times and completed colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_560412], including gender, age, race and ethnicity, 
adjusting for cancer risk.  
 
 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October  15, [ADDRESS_736630] dropped 90% since February.ii  At [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(MGH)  alone, th e Gastroenterology (GI) department estimates that about 8,[ADDRESS_736631] 
been redeployed to COVID care duties. The department anticipates 2-3 months to  ramp up to about 
66% of prior volume  but do es not anticipate getting back to 100% in the next year due to new 
requirements for infection control that will i ncrease turnover time. To further complicate matters, 
public health officials warn that multiple waves of infection may occur over the next 12 -18 months, and 
each may cause additional restrictions on capacity, increasing backlogs even more. Managing demand  
with reduced capacity while planning for additional shutdowns represents a key new challenge for 
health care systems delivering care during this crisis.  Further, even if there is capacity, many patients 
may feel differently about the value of seeking heal thcare, including cancer screening, during the crisis. 
A recent poll showed that the majority of patients are unlikely to visit a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (62%) or specialist 
(64%), regardless of whether they live in a COVID hotspot.iii There are many challenges to resumin g 
healthcare during this crisis, and important research questions about how to do this in a safe, equitable 
and patient -centered manner. Some key questions includ e: How should patients be prioritized for 
routine screening procedures like colonoscopy? What role should  patients’ preferences play in the 
prioritization process? What do health systems need to do to ensure patients are comfortable accessing 
needed care? How can systems do this without furthering disparities or disadvantaging vulnerable 
population s?    
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -investigators have an existing PCORI -funded project , the PRIMED study,  that is examining 
the impact of training primary care physicians in shared decision making (SDM) on colorectal cancer 
screening decisions for patients aged [ADDRESS_736632]. Richter, is on the task force to 
determine policies for resuming GI services  at MGH and will serve as co -investigator on this study.  
Together with our stakeholders (including our patient partners and the Colon Cancer Alliance), we have 
designed two descriptive studies and a randomized controlled trial to examine whether shared de cision 
making will improve colon cancer screening decisions for patients aged [ADDRESS_736633] implications for managing 
the backlog of colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014], but will also help inform policies for  other screening tests and elective 
procedures.  
 
 
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
Briefly describe study design and anticipated enrollment, i.e., number of subjects to be enrolled 
by [CONTACT_17839] -wide and by [CONTACT_17840].  Provide a brief summary of the 
eligibility criteria (for example, age range, gender, medical condition).  Include any local site 
restrictions, for example, “Enrollment at Partners will be limited to adults although the sponsor’s 
protocol is open to both children and adults.”
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October  15, 2014    3   
Across all of the aims, we anticipate enrolling 645 participants study -wide. (Aim 1 , n=195  patients 
completing a survey; Aim 2, n=450 patients completing a survey in the study) .  
 
For Aim [ADDRESS_736634] a cross -sectional survey study target ing patients aged 45-75 who had their 
screening or surveillance colonoscopy postponed  or delayed due to the COVID pandemic . We will survey 
a random sub sample of these patient s. Table 1 includes  information on eligibility for the patient sample. 
We anticipate inviting 300 patients and estimate receiving 195 completed surveys.   
 
Eligible patients will be sent a  survey packet in the mail that will  include a cover letter signed by [CONTACT_560422] o f Quality and Safety  inviting their participation, an information sheet describing the study, an 
incentive ($10), and the survey . The cover letter will include information for participants to opt -out if 
they desire.  Patients will be asked to complete the s urvey and return it back to study staff. Consent is 
implied with return of the survey.  
 
For Aim 2, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial that will enroll patients who have to reschedule 
colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  We will  randomly assign about [ADDRESS_736635] to either 
intervention or control arm. The intervention arm will receive a shared decision making  worksheet  that 
will cover (a) presenting pros and cons of three screening options (first available colonoscopy (wai t time 
estimated to be ~6 months), stool -based test (with consideration that if positive, a follow -up 
colonoscopy may still be delayed ~3 months), and delay colonoscopy one year); (b) contact [CONTACT_560423] ; and (c)  contact [CONTACT_560424] . GI clinicians will be recruited and complete an online SDM training 
prior to their visit with pa tients who have more questions and request a GI visit. The control group will  
receive the standard department guidance and policies on scheduling. We will invite patients to 
complete a survey to track SDM, decisional conflict, overall anxiety and cancer worry, preference for 
colonoscopy, concerns about accessing health care  and we will also track any testing received within [ADDRESS_736636] had their colonoscopy delayed that will be  
followed in this chart review portion of the study.

Briefly describe study procedures.  Include any local site restrictions, for example, “Subjects 
enrolled at Partners will not participate in the pharmacokinetic portion of the study.”  Describe 
study endpoints.
 
Working closely with co -investigators and staff in GI department, study staff will create a master waitlist 
of patients who had a previously scheduled colonoscopy postponed, who had a referral for a 
colonoscopy that has not been processed, and/or who shoul d have been contact[CONTACT_560425] a colonoscopy but were not due to COVID -[ADDRESS_736638] a packet that includes a cover letter signed by [CONTACT_560426] -out of the study, an 
information sheet describing the study, an incentive ($10), and the survey. Patients will also be given 
option to complete the survey via RedCap. Patients will indicate consent by [CONTACT_560427]. Survey 
responses will be entered into RedCap and analyzed by [CONTACT_3476]. On the survey, patients will be 
able to indicate if they are interested in participating in an optional short interview to follow -up on their 
survey responses. St aff will contact a selected subset of patients who agreed to set up the short 
interview.  
 
The research staff will track the number of participants screened , reason for ineligibility, the number 
sent invitation by [CONTACT_2319], the number who opted out or otherwis e declined participation and any reasons 
given for the refusal to participate . Limited information collected during the eligibility screening process 
will be kept for non -responders to examine non response bias.  
 
All study staff are Collaborative Institut ional Training Initiative (CITI) certified and will receive training 
from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_560413]. We will hold regular meetings to review 
screening, enrollment and completion data, to discuss protocol and standard operating proced ures, and 
to identify and mitigate any issues that arise.    
 
For studies involving treatment or diagnosis, provide information about standard of care at 
Partners (e.g., BWH, MGH) and indicate how the study procedures differ  from standard care.  
Provide information on available alternative treatments, procedures, or methods of diagnosis.
 
No tests or treatments will be administered as part of this study.   
For Aim 2, the s tandard of care is that patients may call the GI scheduling group to reschedule their 
colonoscopy o r GI schedulers may reach out to patients to reschedule a cancelled or postponed 
procedure. In the intervention arm, patients may still call the GI scheduling group to reschedule their 
colonoscopy or GI sch edulers may reach out to patients. In addition, patients will receive information 
about their options. The materials will direct patients who are interested in colonoscopy to call the GI 
scheduling group. Patients who are unsure or who would like to learn about other options will be 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October  15, [ADDRESS_736639] protected Partners se rver. Study papers 
(e.g. eligibility screeners, surveys)  that have been scanned or entered into a database will be disposed of 
in the confidential shredder. To address issues of psychological discomfort, research assistants will 
inform patients that they m ay refuse to answer any question and may withdraw from the study at any 
time. To address privacy and confidentiality issues, analytic database with outcomes data will not 
contain any identifying information and will be coded by [CONTACT_560428].  
 
 
Describe explicitly the methods for ensuring the safety of subjects.  Provide objective criteria for 
removing a subject from the study, for example, objective criteria for worsening disease/lack of 
improvement and/or unac ceptable adverse events.  The inclusion of objective drop criteria is 
especially important in studies designed with placebo control groups.
 
Although there are no written informed consent forms, Drs. Simmons and Sepucha are responsible for 
assuring that pa tient participants are adequately informed prior to engaging in any research procedures, 
that all subjects meet eligibility criteria, and that the study is conducted according to the IRB -approved 
research plan.  
 
There are no formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_560414].  
 
FORESEEABLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS  
Provide a brief description of any foreseeable risks and discomforts to subjects.  Include those 
related to drugs/devices/procedures being studied and/or administered/ performed solely for 
research purposes.  In addition, include psychosocial risks, and risks related to privacy and 
confidentiality.  When applicable, describe risks to a developi[INVESTIGATOR_17779].
 
There are minimal risks to individuals participating in this project. The main risks are the time and effort 
involved in participating (for patients estimated to be about 20 minutes for survey and about 30 minutes 
for the optional short follow -up interview ) and the potential loss of privacy.  
 
EXPECTED BENEFITS  
Describe both the expected benefits to individual subjects participating in the research and the 
importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result from the study.  Provide 
a brief, realistic summary of potential benefits to subjects, fo r example, “It is hoped that the 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October  15, [ADDRESS_736640] 25% of the enrolled subjects.”  
Indicate how the results of the study will benefit future patients with the disease/condition being 
studied and/or socie ty, e.g., through increased knowledge of human physiology or behavior, 
improved safety, or technological advances.  
 
There are no direct benefits to patients from completing the surveys. The potential benefit to society is 
that the study wil l help inform policies for how to incorporate patient’s preferences into prioritization 
process  for resuming procedures and services once it is safe to do so .      
 
Shared decision making (SDM) has been shown to increase patient knowledge, reduce decisional conflict 
and improve the match between patients’ pr eferences and their choices. Those patients randomized to 
the intervention arm may benefit as having knowledge of other screening options may help them get 
the care that they prefer .  
 
EQUITABLE SELECTION OF SUBJECTS  
The risks and benefits of the research must be fairly distributed among the populations that stand 
to benefit from it.  No group of persons, for example, men, women, pregnant women, children, 
and minorities, should be categorically excluded from the research without a good scientific or 
ethical reason to do so.  Please provide the basis for concluding that the study population is 
representative of the population that stands to potenti ally benefit from this research.
 
The patient recruitment is limited to men and women [ADDRESS_736641] patients seen by [CONTACT_560429] (>97%).

[CONTACT_560432] a link will be included in the cover letter . Patient consent for the study will be 
implied by [CONTACT_560433].  
• Staff will make up to three reminder phone calls. Study staff will send all non responders,  who 
did not opt out, one reminder paper survey packet  about four weeks after the initial packet . 
Study staff will then make up to 3 additional reminder calls to non -responders.   
• All participants who complete a survey will receive a thank you note.  
 
Clinician recruitment, Aim 2: 
• The department chair will send out an email notifying  clinicians about the study and may share 
study information at regular faculty meetings.  
• [CONTACT_86694] will follow up on the Chief’s communication and will reach out individually to 
clinicians via email and/or during regular meetings to describe the study and invite clinicians to 
join. The email will contain an information sheet for clinicians.  
• Clinicians will indicate consent by [CONTACT_560434]. Simmons and/or Sepucha indicating 
their interest to join the study.   
• Interested clinicians will complete a ~1 hour online shared decision making training session with 
study investigators and sen d availability for ~[ADDRESS_736643] a GI visit via the intervention.  
• All clinician participants will complete a short phone debrief after the intervention is complete 
and receive a thank you  email.  
 
Patient recruitment , Aim 2 :  
• Study staff will  work with the GI department to identify  patients whose colonoscopy has been 
delayed due to COVID -19 and meet the eligibility criteria in Table 1.  
• Study statistician will randomly assign patients on th e waiting list to either the intervention or 
control group . Patients in the intervention group will receive information in the mail  that 
describes available options for colon cancer screening and directions on who to call depending 
on patients’ preference for screening . The usual care group  will not receive the information .  
• About 6-8 weeks after the mailing , the research coordinator will send a survey packet that 
includes: a cover letter signed by [CONTACT_560435], an information sheet describing the study, an incentive ($10), and the 
survey. The cover letter will have information for participants who wish to opt out of the survey.

CONSENT PROCEDURES  
Explain in detail how, when, where, and by [CONTACT_17844], and the timing of consent 
(i.e., how long subjects will be given to consider participation).  For most studies involving more 
than min imal risk and all studies involving investigational drugs/devices, a licensed physician 
investigator must obtain informed consent.  When subjects are to be enrolled from among the 
investigators’ own patients, describe how the potential for coercion will be  avoided.
 
There are no formal written consent procedures in this project for patients  or clinicians . The research 
presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written 
consent is normally required.  
 
Eligible patient participants will be sent a cover letter  signed by [CONTACT_560436]. Consent wil l be implied by [CONTACT_560437].

Study staff will protect the privacy of research study participants as described in the Privacy and 
Confidentiality section. It is possible that participants may be upset by a question in the survey, and 
survey instructions will emphasize that subjects may  skip any question they do not wish to answer . 
Study  staff will review completed surveys weekly and if any complaints or concerns are raised, will flag 
those and send to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_532250] -investigators to address.    
 
Study data will be accessible at all times for the PIs to review. The project manager and PIs wi ll examine 
study conduct including enrollment, accrual, drop -outs, and protocol deviations on a weekly or every 
other week basis with the staff at each site. Study staff will review study related data including reminder 
phone calls to participants, partici pant surveys and will notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_560416] (AEs) immediately and any minor or potential ones at regular meetings. No 
SAEs are expected based on the minimal risk trial. However, the co -investigators will  revie w potentially

PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY  
Describe methods used to protect the privacy of subjects and maintain confi dentiality of data 
collected.  This typi[INVESTIGATOR_17786]/or medical 
record numbers; removing face sheets or other identifiers from completed 
surveys/questionnaires; proper disposal of printed computer data; limited access to study data; 
use of password -protected computer databases; training for research staff on the importance of 
confidentiality of data, and storing research records in a secure location.   
 
NOTE: Additional measures, such as ob taining a Certificate of Confidentiality, should be 
considered and are strongly encouraged when the research involves the collection of sensitive 
data, such as sexual, criminal or illegal behaviors.
 
 
Special efforts will be made to protect the privacy of subjects. We will have names and addresses of 
eligible participants and this information will be kept separate from the study data (e.g. survey  
response s). All patient participants will receive a code number and the surveys will only be identifi ed by 
[CONTACT_105751]. A separate password -protected electronic file will contain the codes linked to identifying 
information. Only the study staff and investigators will have access to this file. These will be kept as long 
as required by [CONTACT_74009].  After the study has been completed the personal contact 
[CONTACT_560440].   
 
The last page of the patient surveys for Aim 1 and Aim 2 will ask patients if they are interested in being 
recontact[CONTACT_560441] e in future research studies with the MGH HDSC study team. Responses from 
these questions, whether from the paper survey, or from the online survey, will be kept in a separate 
datab ase from survey responses.  
 
All files (e.g. eligibility screeners) that contain PHI will be kept in a locked file cabinet or in a secure 
offsite file storage location or on a password protected Partners shared drive.  
 
Patient confidentiality will be main tained as is routine for all patient care privacy guidelines. All research 
staff are CITI certified and will be trained on the importance of data confidentiality.

PARTNERS  
Specimens or data collected by [CONTACT_94883], indicate to whom specimens/data will be sent, what information will be sent, 
and whether the specimens/data will contain identifie rs that could be used by [CONTACT_94884]/data to individual subjects.
 
To promote research replicability, transparency and future use of the data, de -identified data sets will 
be created and will be available, by [CONTACT_32236], to  outside researchers. After the study results have been 
published, de -identified data sets will also be deposited in an open access service such as, ICPSR 
(https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ ). On ICP SR, individuals must register and agree to ICPSR’s 
Responsible Use statement prior to accessing datasets. Additionally, before a dataset is made available 
for access, ICPSR completes a detailed review of all datasets to assess disclosure risk. If necessary , ICPSR 
modifies data to reduce disclosure risk or limits access to datasets for which modifying the data would 
substantially limit their utility or the risk of disclosure remains high. No information that contains 
identifiers or that could be used to link  an individual to the data will be included in the de -identified data 
set.  The information sheets will contain the following language:  After the study is completed, all 
identifiable information will be removed from the data and after removal, the de -iden tified information 
will be deposited in an open access service to promote use of the data by [CONTACT_29091].   
 
Specifically address whether specimens/data will be stored at collaborating sites outside 
Partners for future use not described in the protocol.  Include whether subjects can withdraw 
their specimens/data, and how they would do so.  When appropriate, submit documentation of 
IRB approval from the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_17787].

When specimens or data collected by [CONTACT_94885], indicate from where the specimens/data will be obtained and whether the 
specimens/data will contain identifiers that could be used by [CONTACT_94886]/data to individual subjects.  When appropriate, submi t documentation of IRB 
approval and a copy of the IRB -approved consent form from the institution where the 
specimens/data were collected.

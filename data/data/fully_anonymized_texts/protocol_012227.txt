system is indicated for spi[INVESTIGATOR_54185] (SCS) as an aid in the management of chroni c 
intractable pain of the trunk and/or limb s. It is designed to deliver electrical stimulation to 
the spi[INVESTIGATOR_397529] (also called leads) placed in the dorsal epi[INVESTIGATOR_341006]. The study will use the commercially available IntellisTM neurostimulator and 
compatible SCS system components from Medtronic using stimulation parameters within the 
specifications approved for use in the approved indications . The study will stimulate the 
cervical dorsal columns of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. Section D of this Clinical Study  Plan provides 
detailed description of IntellisTM neurostimulator.  
 
A.2. PURPOSE OF THE INVESTIGATION  
The purpose of this post -market, o bservation  study is to characterize  the effectiveness and 
collect safety  data of DTM SCS  programming  on subjects with chronic, intractable unilateral 
or bilateral pain of the upper limbs . This study is a n observational , open -label, multi -center, 
prospective evaluation  of treatment outcomes resulting from the DTM SCS  programming 
approach relative to pretreatment measurements . The DTM SCS  programming approach  will 
be discussed in section B.1 of this Clinical Study  Plan.  
 
This investigation  will utilize a commercially available SCS system (IntellisTM neurostimulator 
and compatible SCS components) as is,  without any modification, and using FDA-approved 
parameters. Outcomes will be assessed via standardized tests.  
 
A.3. STUDY SIZE  
Approximately [ADDRESS_500315] c ompleted their 6-month visit will be offered 
to return for an additional  12-month visit.   This would increase their commitment to the study 
to 14 months.  
B.1. RATIONALE FOR STUDY  
It is estimated that about 20% percent of the population worldwide is affected by [CONTACT_397557]1. Chronic pain becomes a burden to the individual as this affects a 
person’s ability to carry out many daily life activities, such as exercising, walking, driving a car, 
attending social events, or performing ho usehold chores.  In the [LOCATION_002], chronic pain 
is considered one of the most pervasive and intractable conditions affecting at least one third 
of the population at an estimated cost of five hundred billion dollars per year, when 
combining health -relat ed expenditure and the cost -impact on loss of productivity and 
income2. Low back pain , neck pain and limb pain are among the most prevalent pain 
conditions worldwide, all of them ranked in the top [ADDRESS_500316] stimulation 
(SCS) is a proven therapy that has been in use for about 50 years for v arious types of chronic 
pain. It is currently indicated for the treatment of intractable chronic pain of the trunk and /or 
limbs. SCS is a reversible therapy that allows patients to evaluate the therapy for several days 
using an external neurostimulator (EN S) prior to receiving an implantable neurostimulator 
(INS) system5,6,7,8. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_307880] (SCS) utilizes pulsed electric fields that are applied 
to the dorsal section of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_397530], called leads, implanted in the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_13814].   
The c onventional  programming approach in SCS utilizes pulsed el ectric fields oscillating in the 
40-250 Hz frequency range. The electric field induce s a stimulation pattern  (paresthesia) , 
which  is steered by [CONTACT_397558] (pulse width) and  intensity of the applied electric field. The concept 
behind this programming approach  is that  the stimulation pattern induced by [CONTACT_397559]. Although proven effective for the treatment 
of intractable chro nic pain of the upper limbs by [CONTACT_397560] , the variability of the 
paresthesia sensation , including uncomfortable sensations, due to the motion of the neck  
________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________  
CONFIDENTIAL DTM -PROC -2020PM3   Page [ADDRESS_500317] limited the utilization of  the conventional SCS programming approach .  
The DTM SCS  programming approach relies on stimulation parameters that can be  set by [CONTACT_397561] , 
while providing pain relief on the affected limb(s) .  DTM SCS  programming will use stimulation 
parameters that are currently available in the device  to be used in this study.  
In a given therapy  group, DTM SCS  will provide programs with different pulse rates,  pulse 
widths  and intensities  for the goal of better pain relief.  For example, starting parameters may 
be a combination of a program with [ADDRESS_500318] MEET ALL of the following inclusion

this Clinical Study  plan will be reviewed prior to their participation in this investigation .   
B.5.3. BLINDING  
This open label, single -arm study is not blinded. All subjects eligible to participate will be 
trialed with commercially available Intellis trialing SCS system. Those who successfully trial 
DTM SCS  programming may be implanted with a co mmercially available Intellis SCS system.  
B.5.4. SAMPLE SIZE  
Primary Endpoint Assessment occurs at the 3-months follow up visit after activation of the 
implanted device . There is no statistical hypothesis to be evaluated in this study , but  it is 
believed  that approximately  [ADDRESS_500322] (IRB) 
approvals, and when written informed consent from subjects has been obtained.  Prior to 
enrollment, Investigators and clinical site staff will approach su bjects, who have been 
determined to be candidates for SCS therapy and talk about potential participation in the 
study.  Following informed consent, the eligibility of subjects to participate in the study will 
be assessed according to inclusion and exclusio n criteria outlined in this Clinical Study  Plan.  
Various assessments including pain intensity, evaluation of medical history and records, and 
the Investigator’s clinical judgment will be used in the selection process.  
B.6.1. SUMMARY OF STUDY PROTOCOL  
Potential study subjects will be identified from a pool of candidates for SCS therapy that 
are either affiliated with or referred to the clinical sites.  Advertisements of the study may 
be used for recruitment purposes, upon approval of the patient recruitmen t materials by 
[CONTACT_397563](s). An informed consent form (ICF) will be given to the potential subject for 
private evaluation. The Investigator or Study Clinical Staff will be available to respond to

CONFIDENTIAL DTM -PROC -2020PM3   Page [ADDRESS_500323] ’s response to 
DTM SCS . Commercially available stimulation leads and a commercially available  external 
neurostimulator (ENS) will be used during the Trial Phase. Subjects will evaluate DTM SCS  
therapy  based on pain intensity under optimal stimulation param eters  within the 
specifications of the device . Subjects  who have a "successful Trial Phase" (defined as a 40% 
or greater pain reduction from Baseline in their upper limb  pain) will proceed to permanent 
implantation of a SCS system.  
The implanted INS will be activated within [ADDRESS_500324] 
completed their 6 -month visit will be offered to return for an additional 12 -month visit.   
This would increase their commitment to the study to 14 months  Figure 1 summarizes the 
sequence of study -related assessments, procedures, and activities.  
B.6.2. PRE-SCREENING /CONSENT/ENROLLMENT  
Medical records of all subjects deemed by [CONTACT_397564] -identified and sent to a sponsor designated physician for pre -screening. 
De-identified medical records should include detailed medical and surgical history of the 
pain condition under study as well any information about comorbidities. Any imagin g 
studies (such as MRI, CT, X -ray) should be included for evaluation of the study candidate.  
Once the site has received confirmation that subject may be an appropriate candidate for 
this study, the site may proceed with the eligibility process. This de -identified pre -screening 
process assists in reducing unnecessary visits for subjects that would not be eligible for this 
study .

CONFIDENTIAL DTM -PROC -2020PM3   Page [ADDRESS_500326]’s pain condition and pain pattern as described in the Physician Implant 
Manual s. Stimulation will be delivered from an external neurostimulator (ENS).   
Anterior -posterior (AP) and la teral X -ray imaging will be done following lead placement  at 
the beginning of the Trial Phase. The subject should flex forward prior to the final AP and 
lateral X -ray imaging.  Additional Imaging may be required if lead migration is suspected 
throughout the trial.  
Stimulation therapy will be as follows:  
• Subjects will be given multiple program groups to try. Each DTM SCS  program group 
will have multiple parameters. The stimulati on parameters will be within the 
specifications described in the IntellisTM manuals.  Each DTM SCS  program group has 
at least two programs with diffe rent pulse rate in the [ADDRESS_500327]’s self -reported pain relief.  Adjustments to 
therapy will be attempted until at least 40% self -reported pain reductio n from baseline is 
achieved or until conclusion of the trial phase (no more than 10 days). Subjects will be 
assessed for study -related adverse events and medication usage during the duration of the 
Trial Phase.

CONFIDENTIAL DTM -PROC -2020PM3   Page 20 of 43 B.6.6 . END OF TRIAL ASSESSMENT  
At the end o f the Trial Phase, subjects will be assessed for pain intensity under optimal 
therapy parameters. Anterior -posterior (AP) and lateral X -ray imaging may be  done at the 
end of the Trial Phase. The subject will be assessed for study -related adverse events and  
medication usage.  
Subjects who have a "successful Trial Phase" (defined as a 40% or greater pain reduction 
from Baseline in the upper limbs  pain  and the subject would like to move forward to the 
implant phase ) will proceed to permanent implantation of a SCS system to evaluate DTM 
SCS programming . Permanent implantation of the IntellisTM SCS system will be scheduled. 
A threshold of 40% for the Tria l Phase was predetermined as the minimum pain reduction 
that warrants consideration of a permanent implant and an opportunity to achieve a 50% 
pain reduction as defined in the Individual Subject Success criterion (see Section B.7.3).   
Subjects who did not achieve 40% or greater pain reduction in upper limb  and do not 
receive permanent implantation  will exit the study after being followed up for two weeks 
after removal  of the leads to assess  study -related  adverse events.  
B.6.7. PERMANENT DEVICE IMPLANT (0 -60 DAYS FROM END OF 
SUCCESSFUL TRIAL PHASE)  
As described in section B.6.6, subjects who underwent a successful trial of DTM SCS  therapy 
and who agreed to continue into the next stage of the study will proceed to permanent 
implantation sta ge.  
Permanent percutaneous leads will be placed in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_397531] a vertebral level 
based on the subject’s pain condition and pain pattern as described in the Physician Implant 
Manuals. The implantable neurostimulator (INS) will be implanted by a traine d physician 
according to standard practice and following the Physician Implant Manual for the device.  
Anterior -posterior (AP) and lateral X -ray imaging will be obtained.  The standard practice 
of the study site will be followed for prophylactic pre -surger y antibiotics. Subjects will be 
assessed for study -related adverse events and medication usage.  
B.6.8 . DEVICE ACTIVATION (0 -14 DAYS FOLLOWING PERMANENT IMPLANT)  
Clinical personnel at the site will assess if healing of surgical wounds is sufficiently 
appro priate to start charging the INS. The INS will be initially programmed to the group 
therapy or set of stimulation parameters that provided adequate pain relief during the Trial 
Phase. Adjustments to therapy may be made based on patient response to a progra m group 
or set of stimulation parameters. The subject will be provided with instructions on how to 
operate the charger and patient remote control at this visit.  Subjects will be assessed for 
study -related adverse events and medication usage.

B.7. STUDY ENDPOINTS  
B.7.1. DEFINITION OF ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
All subjects who receive a permanent SCS system implant and complete the study  without 
any major protocol deviations (that would render their data unevaluable).   
B.7.2. EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT DEFINITIONS  
Primary Effectiveness Assessment:  For subjects who have a successful Trial Phase and 
receive a permanent implant, the Primary E ffectiveness Assessment occurs at the follow 
up visit 3 months after Device Activation.   
B.7.3. PRIMARY ENDPOINT  
Pain rating on the 10 cm Visual Analog Scale  (VAS) is  considered the primary outcome 
measure.  VAS is the most widely used outcome measure in assessing pain due to its 
documented reliability and validity, ease in administration, and minimal training 
requirements for the administrator.  
The primary effectiveness  endpoint is the percentage of implanted subjects who respond 
to DTM SCS  therapy at [ADDRESS_500336] 50% at 3 months after activation of the permanent SCS system 
(Device Activation) as compared with Baseline m easurement.  
B.7.4. SECONDARY ENDPOINTS  
The following secondary endpoints will be evaluated:  
• Change from Baseline in upper limb  pain mean VAS score determined at the 3 -month 
visit after device activation. This is calculated as: Change from Baseline in Upper 
Extremities Pain VAS = 3 -Month Visit Pain VAS – Baseline Pain VAS. A negative result 
reflects a decrease in Pain VAS  score , while a positive result reflects an increase in 
Pain VAS  score . 
• Change from Baseline in extend of disability as measured by [CONTACT_397575] ( PDI), evaluated at 3  months after device activation.  
• Frequency of treatment emergent adverse events . 
________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________  
CONFIDENTIAL DTM -PROC -2020PM3   Page 27 of 43 B.7.5. ADDITIONAL DATA COLLECTION  
The following will also be collected:  
• Comparison of mean change fr om Baseline in upper limb pain mean VAS score 
evaluated at 1, 3, 6 & 12months after device activation.  
• Subject Satisfaction, evaluated at 3, 6 & 12months after device activation.  
• Patient Global Impression of Change, evaluated at 3, 6 & 12 months after devi ce 
activation.  
• Quality of paresthesia at 3, 6 & 12 months.  
• Comparison of mean change from baseline in other pain mean VAS score evaluated 
at 3, 6 & 12 - month s after device activation (if available)  
• Activity level based on IntellisTM Adaptive -Stim data log . 
 
B.8. EVALUATION CRITERIA  
B.8.1. EFFECTIVENESS  
Results of the tests and standard questionnaires will be recorded in Case Report Forms at 
Baseline and during follow -up visits. Changes from Baseline will be calculated.   
Effectiveness will be measured for each subject using the following tests:  
• Pain  
• Visu al Analog Scale (VAS, 10 cm) at Baseline, End of Trial Phase, Months 1, 3, 6 and12 
months Disability  
Pain Disability Questionnaire at 3, 6 and 12 months  
• Impression of Change in Quality of Life  
Patient Global Impression of Change at 3, 6 and 12 months  
• Satisfaction with Therapy  
Subject Satisfaction Questionnaire at 3, 6 and 12 months  
• Paresthesia generated by [CONTACT_397576] 3, [ADDRESS_500337].

CONFIDENTIAL DTM -PROC -2020PM3   Page 28 of 43 B.8.3. SAFETY  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_397577] -related adverse events at all study visits with 
descriptive statistics.  
B.8.3.1 DEFINITIONS  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject associated with 
the use of the the rapy under the study whether or not related to the IntellisTM SCS system 
or the study procedures. An AE is also any event related to any underlying medical 
condition, present at baseline, which increases in severity or frequency by a clinically 
meaningful amount during the study as determined by [CONTACT_737]. Study -related is 
defined as relating to device, procedure or therapy.  
For all study -related adverse events, the Investigator will provide an assessment of the 
adverse event, its seriousness, treatm ent/intervention provided, relationship to the 
device/procedure /therapy , and resolution.  
As the effectiveness measure in this study is upper limb  pain, upper limb  pain do not need 
to be reported as an adverse event unless it meets the definition of a serious adverse 
event. Investigators may, however, report any other study pain -related adverse events 
during the study.   
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is an adverse event that  
• Leads to death  
• Leads to serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that either results in  
o a life -threatening illness or injury (life -threatening is defined as at risk of death at 
the time of the event), or  
o a permanent impairment of a body structur e or a body function, or  
o in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (in -patient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31561] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81539] a period of greater than 24 
hours), or  
o medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function,  
• Leads to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
An unanticipated adverse device event  (UADE) is a serious adverse event that was not  
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the Clinical Study  Plan , 
or any unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that related to the rights, 
safety, or welfare of subjects.  
Known adverse events related to the dev ice, procedure or therapy are listed in the section 
C. (Risk Analysis) of this Clinical Study  Plan.

C.  RISK ANALYSIS  
C.1. DESCRIPTION AND ANALYSIS OF ALL INCREASED RISKS TO SUBJECTS  
DTM SCS  programming approach will be used with a commercially available, FDA approved, 
IntellisTM SCS system , with parameters within the specifications for the indicated use . 
Anticipated potential adverse events resulting from the study are expected to be in line  with 
adverse events alr eady documented for SCS using a conventional programming approach.  
There are known risks associated with the use of any SCS system.  Known risks are associated 
with the implant procedure, the stimulation, the implanted device (not associated with 
stimulation) and external devices such as the charger and remote control. These are typi[INVESTIGATOR_397532]. Subjects will be informed of these anticipated risks in the study 
consent process.  
Risks of Surgery : 
Implanting a neurost imulation system has risks similar to spi[INVESTIGATOR_397533], including spi[INVESTIGATOR_397534] (spi[INVESTIGATOR_397535]), headaches, swelling, bruising, bleeding, 
infection, or paralysis.  
Subjects on anticoagulation therapy may be at higher risk for problems after surgery such as 
hematomas that could result in paralysis.  
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_397536] : 
The implantation of a spi[INVESTIGATOR_397537]. In addition to those normally associated with surgery, implantation or use 
of a neurostimulation system includes, but is not limited to, the fo llowing risks:  
• Allergic or immune system response to the implanted materials  
• Infection  
• Lead or neurostimulator erosion through the skin or migration  
• Leakage of cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872]  
• Loss of pain relief may return patients to their underlying pain condition  
• Persistent pain at the neurostimulator site  
• Placement of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_397538] a surgical procedure that may expose patients to 
risks of epi[INVESTIGATOR_307865] (bleeding), hematoma, or paralysis  
• Radicular chest wall stimulation  
• Seroma (fluid collection in pocke t where stimulator is placed) or hematoma at the 
neurostimulator site  
________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________  
CONFIDENTIAL DTM -PROC -2020PM3   Page 32 of 43 • Change in stimulation, possibly related to cellular changes around the electrode(s), 
shifts in electrode position, loose electrical connections, lead fractures, which has 
been described by [CONTACT_397580] (jolting or shocking 
sensation)  
• Over time,  there could be changes in the level of symptom control. In most cases, the 
physician can correct these changes without surgery.  
• Formation of excessive tissue around th e lead in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_397539], requiring surgical intervention. Time 
to onset can range from weeks to many years after implant.  
• The safety of this therapy is unknown for pregnancy, unborn fetus, or  delivery  
• Stimulation -dependent gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, incontinence or 
constipation  
• Stimulation -dependent bladder symptoms such as urinary retention, incontinence or 
frequency  
• Unexpected changes in stimulation - Electromagnetic interference, changes in 
posture, and other activities can cause a perceived increase in stimulation  
System Revision Risk : 
The Intellis Neurostimulator may require replacement in 9 years or earlier, regardless of the 
number of times the neu rostimulator is recharged.  It is possible that the system will need to 
be revised (explanted, replaced, or repositioned) earlier than 9 years.  Possible reasons for 
revision/explant may include infection, malfunction, and migration of the system 
component s.  The risks associated with system revision are equivalent to the commercially 
available systems.    
Pregnancy Risks  
Pregnant women are not able to take part in this study.  Female subjects must agree to not 
become pregnant during the study by [CONTACT_2329] a me dically acceptable method of birth control. If 
a subject becomes pregnant during this study, there may be risks to the unborn child that are 
not yet known.  Subjects will be advised and encouraged to notify the study doctor 
immediately if they think they a re or have become pregnant.  Subjects that become pregnant 
during the study will be instructed to turn the neurostimulator “OFF” and will be exited from 
the study.  
Radiographic Imaging  
As part of the study, subjects maybe required to have fluoroscopic or X -ray images taken of 
their thoracic spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] .  in addition to the imaging conducted to implant the leads.  This may be 
beyond what is standard of care.  The risk associated with these additional images has been 
considered and determined to be minimal since th e total radiation dose will be approximately 
the same as one CT scan of the abdomen.     
Study Risk Control Measures  
________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________  
CONFIDENTIAL DTM -PROC -2020PM3   Page 33 of 43 The following will be done to mitigate risks associated with the implanted system:  
• Investigators who are experienced with spi[INVESTIGATOR_397540]  
• Instructions will be given to the study participants to ensure they can properly use 
the patient programmer and recharger system  
• Subjects can turn off stimulation at any time during the study with the patien t 
programmer or recharger  
• Periodic monitoring of the study participants  
• Written materials that contain precautions, warnings, and contraindications, as 
well as instructions on the use of the devices will be available and/or provided to 
the clinicians and s ubjects  
Since the efficacy measure in this study is intensity of pain in the upper limb s, pain in these 
areas does not need to be reported as an adverse event unless it meets the definition of a 
serious adverse event. However, Investigators may, at their d iscretion, report any other pain -
related adverse events during the study.   
C2.  MINIMIZATION OF RISKS  
Neurostimulation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as SCS, are used as an aid in the management of chronic, 
intractable pain that cannot be effectively managed with medica tions and/or other 
conservative treatments alone. Patients considered for neurostimulation therapy have 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_397541].  
Medtronic has carefully designed and tested the IntellisTM AdaptiveStim Neurostimulation 
Systems to ensure the safety and performance for the treatment of chronic, intractable pain. 
Medtronic has completed an extensive risk analysis to ensure the identific ation of potential 
hazards and subsequent mitigation of these hazards to eliminate them entirely or reduce 
them to an acceptable level.   
The risks associated with the surgical implantation of the device, device use, and device 
failures are the same as tho se observed for commercially available SCS devices. With an 
existing pre -market application approval for the commercially available IntellisTM 
AdaptiveStim Neurostimulation Systems, an established safety profile of probable benefit 
outweighing risk already  exists for SCS Therapy for chronic back and/or leg pain. In most cases 
implantation of SCS is a reversible procedure and the system can be turned off or removed. 
Moreover, stimulation parameters are adjustable to minimize or reverse complications and 
maxi mize therapeutic effects. System output and programming parameters used with the 
proposed stimulation parameters are within the range of the commercially available Intellis 
AdaptiveStim Neurostimulation Systems. The anticipated benefits of the clinical out comes of 
SCS therapy per the study design outweigh the overall risk.

components of the IntellisTM SCS systems and their functions. They will also receive training 
on assessment tools.  Investigators will also  be reminded that the risk of serious injury to the 
patient increases as location of the selected needle insertion site progresses up the vertebral 
column —from a lower risk at a lumbar location to a higher risk at a cervical location.  
Therefore, they shou ld select a vertebral location that provides the widest and easiest access 
to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_397542].  All Investigators and study personnel mus t 
provide evidence of training in Good Clinical Practice (GCP) in the conduct of clinical trials with 
human participants.  
C3.  POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
It is possible that an individual subject  will experience no direct benefit from participating in 
the study . However, if a subject is benefiting from therapy, he/she will be allowed to keep the 
implanted device and accessories after completion of the study, with post -study care 
conducted by [CONTACT_423]’s personal physician.  
D.  DESCRIPTION OF THE DEVICE  
D.1. EACH  IMPORTANT COMPONENT, INGREDIENT, AND PROPERTY OF THE 
DEVICE  
D.1.1. DEVICE SYSTEM OVERVIEW  
The Intellis ™ system is a totally implantable spi[INVESTIGATOR_397543] a nd/or limbs. The 
system has been approved by [CONTACT_397581].   
The Intellis  system consists of a rechargeable implantable neurostimulator (INS) with [ADDRESS_500339] 
percutaneous  leads located in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13814]. The INS can be controlled by a Patient 
Programmer and/or a Clinician Programmer.   
Before permanent implantation, a trial phase of therapy lasting up to 10 days is required. 
Components of the system during trial includ e an External Neurostimulator (ENS) capable 
of delivering the same stimulation as the INS, and Stimulation Leads. Other components of 
________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________  
CONFIDENTIAL DTM -PROC -2020PM3   Page 35 of 43 the system include Clinician Programmer, Communicator, Patient Programmer, Extensions, 
Charger and charging system, and su rgical accessories.  
D.1.2. DEVICE SYSTEM DETAILS   
Only FDA approved, commercially available components will be used for the study.  
________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________  
CONFIDENTIAL DTM -PROC -2020PM3   Page 36 of 43 D.1.2.1 MAJOR COMPONENTS  
Implantable Neurostimulator: The Intellis neurostimulator ( INS, Model [ZIP_CODE], 
Medtronic, Minneapolis MN) will be used for the study. The INS is a multi -programmable, 
rechargeable device that delivers stimulation through one or two 8 -electrode leads. The 
stimulation settings are stored in programs. A program is a specifi c combination of pulse 
width, rate, and amplitude settings acting on a specific electrode combination (up to 16 
electrodes per program). Each of the [ADDRESS_500340] through the electrodes in the 
leads that are connected to the output terminals of the INS. The electrical pulses used for 
stimulation are generated using a  single current source.  The INS is designed to produce 
charge -balanced, biphasic rectangular pulses.  
The battery is recharged using an external charger that uses transcutaneous RF energy 
transmission. The INS is capable of communicating with the Charger to control the 
recharging function.   
The INS communicates with the Clinician Programmer and Patient Programmer (also 
called Patient Remote Controller). The Clinician Programmer is used to program the INS 
and the ENS. The Patient Programmer is used by [CONTACT_397582], change therapy programs, and turn stimulation on and off.  
External Neurostimulator (ENS) for Trial Phase:  The Medtronic Model [ZIP_CODE] Wireless 
External Neurostimulator (ENS) is part of a neurostimulation sys tem used for trial 
stimulation outside of the operating room. The ENS is powered by [CONTACT_397583]. The ENS is connected to leads implanted in the subject. The subject uses 
the ENS during the Trial Phase to evaluate the effectiveness o f SCS therapy prior to 
receiving a permanent implant. The ENS also communicates with the Clinician 
Programmer system and Patient Remote Controller, similar to the INS.  
Clinician Programmer System :  The Medtronic Model A710 Intellis ™ clinician programmer 
application resides on a tablet and is intended to be used by [CONTACT_397584] (Model [ZIP_CODE]) and IntellisTM INS (Model [ZIP_CODE] and [ZIP_CODE]) for pain 
therapy. The Clinician Programmer requires the use of a Commu nicator (Model 8880T2) 
to communicate with the INS.  
Patient Programmer:  The Patient Programmer (Model [ZIP_CODE]), also called Patient Remote 
Controller, is a handheld unit able to communicate with the INS or ENS.  The Patient 
Programmer is powered by [CONTACT_397585] 
a rechargeable battery after implant of the INS . The Patient Programmer is used by 
[CONTACT_397586], to turn on or off the INS or ENS, 
and to change some of thera py parameters such as stimulation amplitude.   
Charging System:   The Charging system (Model [ZIP_CODE]) is used by [CONTACT_397587].  It is a portable device powered by a 
rechargeable battery and can be held in one hand. Th e charging system used in this study 
________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________  
CONFIDENTIAL DTM -PROC -2020PM3   Page 37 of 43 is a commercially available charging system manufactured by [CONTACT_13735] (Minneapolis, 
MN) and fully compatible with the study INS.  
Stimulation Leads and Lead Extensions:   The study will use commercially available 
percutan eous eight -electrode leads manufactured by [CONTACT_13735] ( Vectris, Minneapolis, 
MN) and compatible with the INS and ENS to be used in this study. The leads are 
positioned percutaneously in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_397544]. The percutaneous leads are 
intended to be single use. Temporary or permanent percutaneous leads may be used 
during the Trial Phase of the study. The proximal end of these leads connect directly to 
the E NS. Permanent leads will be used during the Permanent Phase of the study. These 
may be connected to a Lead Extension. The leads or lead extensions are tunneled 
subcutaneously to connect to the INS. Commercially available lead extensions 
(Medtronic, Minneap olis, MN) compatible with the percutaneous leads and INS may be 
used in this study. As with any spi[INVESTIGATOR_397545], the risk of serious injury to the patient 
(e.g, hemorrhage, hematoma, or paralysis) increases as location of the selected needle  
insertion sit e progresses up the vertebral column —from a lower risk at a lumbar  location 
to a higher risk at a cervical location. Select a vertebral location that provides  the widest 
and easiest access to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_397546].  
D.1.2.2. SURGICAL ACCESSORIES  
The surgical accessories that will be used in the study will be commercially available 
devices.  
Torque Wrench:  A commercially available Torque Wrench is used to tighten the screws 
that lock a percutaneous lead into the INS and/or a lead extension. It also tightens  the 
screws that lock the lead extension into the INS when this is used.  
Lead anchors:  Lead anchors ma y be used to possibly prevent lead migration and/or lead 
strain. These are used to anchor the percutaneous leads to the supraspi[INVESTIGATOR_397547]. Lead anchors used in this study are commercially available (Medtronic, 
Minneapolis, MN) and designed to  slide freely over the lead length to the required fixation 
position. Surgical sutures are then tied around the anchor clampi[INVESTIGATOR_397548].   
Insertion Needle:   Percutaneous leads are implanted in the dorsal epi[INVESTIGATOR_397549].  An insertion needle contains a cannula and stylet that facilitate access 
to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_397550].  The insertion needle is a 14G epi[INVESTIGATOR_397551] 
a thin wall and a modified Touhy non -coring tip.  The cannula and stylet are designed to 
lock together and maintain the orientation of the tip of each component. The hub of the 
insertion needle has a standard luer fitting.

CONFIDENTIAL DTM -PROC -2020PM3   Page 38 of 43 Stylets:   Stylets are used to push and “steer” a percutaneous lead into the desired place 
within the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13814].  The distal end of the stylet could be straight or curved.  The 
implanter is able to use either one in order to comfortably maneuver a percutaneous lead 
through the epi[INVESTIGATOR_397552].  
Tunneling Tool:   A Tun neling Tool is used to create a subcutaneous tunnel that directs the 
percutaneous leads or lead extensions from the midline incision to the leads  from the INS 
implant site.  This is a single use tool.  
INS Template:   The INS Template is an aid to be used f or the implanter intended for proper 
sizing of the INS pocket within each subject.  
INS Port Plug:   An INS Port Plug is used to seal the port of the INS that is not in use when 
only one percutaneous lead is implanted.  
Lead Blank:   A Lead Blank is an optiona l aid made out of flexible stainless steel that has 
an outer diameter similar in size to the percutaneous lead. A lead blank can be optionally 
used to clear a path for the introduction of a percutaneous lead into the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13814].

CONFIDENTIAL DTM -PROC -2020PM3   Page 39 of 43 E.1.1. STUDY CLINICAL MONITOR  
The Sponsor will assign a Clinical Monitor(s) in order to fulfill the required Sponsor and 
monitoring responsibilities according t o the Study Monitoring Plan. The Study Monitoring 
Plan describes in detail who will conduct the monitoring, at what frequency monitoring 
will be done, at what level of detail monitoring will be performed, the distribution of 
monitoring reports, and key mon itoring activities and specifies the data to be reviewed 
over the course of the clinical study. The monitoring plan will facilitate compliance with 
Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and other relevant guidelines. The clinical study monitors 
will conduct monito ring visits in accordance with this plan. Monitoring may be conducted 
on-site or remotely.  
E.1.2. MONITORING PROCEDURES  
Monitoring visits to the clinical study  sites will be made either remotely or on-site 
periodically and according to the monitoring Plan .  These visits will ensure that 
Investigators and their staff understand and accept their defined responsibilities, 
assess compliance with current GCP guidelines, evaluate clinical trial progress, assess 
the continued acceptability of the site facilities,  evaluate compliance with this Clinical 
Study  plan, and verify the data entered on the CRFs.  
Investigators are to maintain, in an appropriate secure location, all source documents 
as required by [CONTACT_397589]. Source documents include signed inf ormed 
consents , subject completed questionnaires, laboratory results, supporting medical 
records, and any applicable electronic files.  These source documents will be used by 
[CONTACT_397590] . Clinical monitoring activities will include review and resolution of 
missing or inconsistent results to assure the accuracy of the reported data.  Where 
any discrepancies are noted, the Clinical Monitor will generate queries. Discrepanc ies 
will be resolved with the Investigator and/or an individual designated by [CONTACT_3786].  If data is incomplete, the Investigator will attempt to obtain the missing 
data.  The original source documents will remain stored in a secure location at the 
clinical sites as designated by [CONTACT_737].   
The safety and welfare of study subjects will be ensured by [CONTACT_397591], including proper documentation (Informed 
Consent Form) by [CONTACT_397592], and by [CONTACT_397593] -related adverse events as appropriate.  
The Clinical Monitor will summarize the evaluation and assessment of each 
monitoring visit in written reports. These reports will identify any issues with 
repeated data recording or reporting and will specify clear recommendations for 
resolution of noted deficiencies.  
________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________  
CONFIDENTIAL DTM -PROC -2020PM3   Page [ADDRESS_500341] and monitoring of the clinical investigation will be conducted in accordance 
with the Sponsor’s internal procedures.   
E.2. DATA Q UALITY ASSURANCE  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision 
of the site Investigator. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, 
completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported. The subject data will be 
entered on paper CRFs f ollowing the study visits. Study visit worksheets will be provided for 
use as source docume nt worksheets for recording data for each participant enrolled in the 
study.  All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure 
accurate interpretation of data. Data recorded on the CRFs should be consistent with the 
data recorde d on the source documents. Data will be reviewed to identify inconsistent or 
missing data as well as  study -related adverse events.  Data discrepancies will be addressed 
by [CONTACT_397594]/or during clinical site 
monitoring visits. The Sponsor and representatives of regulatory authorities are permitted to 
access study documents (e.g. Clinical Study  plan, CRFs, medical records/files) as needed. All 
attempts will be made to preserve the privacy and confidentiali ty of subjects.  
E.3. STUDY CONDUCT  
The Investigator agrees that the study will be conducted according to this investigation plan, 
the principles of GCPs as outlined in the [LOCATION_002] Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) - [ADDRESS_500342] o f the trial including those 
study -related  duties delegated to other appropriately qualified individuals and designated in 
the delegation of authority documentation.  The Investigator will assure that study staff 
cooperates with monitoring and audits, and w ill demonstrate due diligence in recruiting, 
screening, and retaining study subjects.  
The Investigator will also be responsible for filing an annual study progress report to the IRB 
as per IRB guidelines. The Investigator and/or Sponsor, as required by [CONTACT_397595], are 
required to report in writing to the IRB, notice of completion, termination, or discontinuation 
of the study. If the study is discontinued for safety concerns, the Investigator and/or Sponsor 
will notify the IRB immediately.  
The Invest igator is also responsible for recording and assessing the relationship to the study 
and the seriousness of study -related a dverse events. Investigators must report any study -
related serious  adverse event (SAE) to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_500343] be obtained from all subjects prior to study participation. Informed 
consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_397596] -designated healthcare 
professional as per GCP guidelines.  An informed consent form (ICF) wi ll be provided to 
potential subjects for their private evaluation. If a subject consents to participate, the ICF must 
be signed by [CONTACT_423].  Study ICF must be approved by [CONTACT_1201]. Signed ICFs will be retained 
in the subject's study records at the clini cal site.  Subjects may also be consented via a 
combination of mail and telephone calls. The Investigator  or delegate will document the 
telephone calls and follow -up by [CONTACT_397597]. Study staff  will then p rovide a photocopy to the subject .  
The ICF will be in compliance with the requirements set forth in [ADDRESS_500344] of an 
Investigator.  A formal change to this study under this Clinical Study  plan cannot be initiated 
by [CONTACT_397598]’s  approval, IRB approval, and the 
Investigator’s approval.  
Exception for Emergency Deviation :  An exception to the policy noted 
above is an emergency deviation to the Clinical Study  plan that  may be 
initiated by [CONTACT_397599],  
only in cases where a change is necessary to eliminate any immediate 
apparent hazard to subjects.  Emergency deviations must be reported to 
the Sponsor and the IRB no later than 24 hours following the emergency.  
Deviations from the Clinical Study  plan and study requirements (including GCP guidelines) will 
be revie wed by [CONTACT_397600]. Appropriate corrective

Sep 2020  Phase of development:  
Phase 1  
Objectives:  
• To investigate the effect of esomeprazole on the pharmacokinetics of pritelivir  
• To investigate the  pharmacokinetics of  pritelivir  metabolites AIC090015, AIC090105 and 
AIC090015-acylglucuronides  
• To investigate the safety and tolerability of pritelivir  
Trial design: 
This will be a single -center, open -label, 2 -period, fixed-sequence Phase 1 trial in 1 8 healthy adult male 
and female subjects (at least 7 subjects per sex ). All subjects will receive treatment 1 (T1; single dose of 
100 mg pritelivir  will be administered on Day  1) in the first period, followed by [CONTACT_3148] 2 (T2; single 
dose of 100 mg pritelivir  will be administered on Day  1 and 40 mg  esomeprazole will be administered qd 
from Day -3 to Day  1) in the second period. The wash -out period between pritelivir  administrations in T1 
and T2 is at least 4  weeks.  
Number of subjects (planned):  
18 
Diagno sis and main criteria for inclusion:  
Healthy adult male and female subjects (at least 7 subjects per sex ) of any ethnic origin, aged [ADDRESS_468583], dose and mode of administration:  
Oral 100  mg pritelivir tablets  
Oral 40  mg esomeprazole tablets (Nexium®) 
Duration of t reatment:  
In Treatment Period 1:  
Pritelivir:  single dose  of 100 mg on Day  1

Efficacy 
Not applicable.  
 Pharmacokinetics  
Primary variables:  
• AUC 0-∞, AUC 0-last, Cmax of pritelivir in plasma  
 
Secondary variables:  
• tmax, tlag, t1/2z, CL/F, V d /F, MRT of pritelivir in plasma  
• AUC 0-∞, AUC 0-last, Cmax, tmax, tlag, t1/2z, MRT of metabolites AIC090015, AIC090105 and AIC090015-
acyl glucuronides in plasma  
• The ratio between each of the metabolites AIC090015, AIC090105 and AIC090015-acyl 
glucuronides versus pritelivir will be calculated for AUC 0-∞, AUC 0-last 
 
Pharmacokinetic profile will be determined in each period on Day  1 for 360 hours . 
 
Pharmacogenomics/gene expression:  
• Post-hoc analysis of alleles associated with altered drug metabolis m/ disposition may be determined.  
 
Safety 
• Overall tolerability 
• Nature, frequency, duration, severity and causality of adverse events 
• Clinical laboratory parameters  
• Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate)  
• Standard 12-lead ECG

Statistical methods: 
Pharmacokinetic data  
The Pharmacokinetic Set (PKS) will include all subjects in the Safety Set (SS) with at least 1 plasma 
concentration time point for inclusion in the PK analysis. The PKS will be used for the PK analyses.  
Descriptive statistics will be calculated for plasma concentrations of pritelivir  and derived PK parameters. 
Statistics include sample size (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), %CV, geometric mean, median, minimum and maximum.  
The relative bioavailability of pritelivir  with respect to the  primary variables AUC
0-∞, AUC 0-last and C max 
will be explored based on the log transformed data with an analysis of variance model with treatment (as fixed effect) and subject (as random effect). Point estimates (GMR) and 90% confidence intervals (90% CIs) will be computed for the ratio T2 (test) /T1 (reference) to evaluate the effect of esomeprazole on 
pritelivir  PK under fasted conditions.  
Safety data 
Safety data analysis will be conducted on the Safety Set. Statistical analysis of the safety data will b e 
limited to descriptive summaries.  
The results of AE recording, vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, clinical laboratory investigations, and physical examinations will be listed by [CONTACT_374237]. 
All adverse events will be coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). Incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) that began after the start of trial treatment (post -dose on Day 1 to End of trial examination) will be summarized at 3 levels: the overall 
subject level (occurrence of at least one TEAE), primary System Organ Class level, and preferred term level. All adverse events will be listed together with information on onset, duration, frequency, intensity, seriousness, relationsh ip to IMP, outcome, and action taken.  
Laboratory data will be presented in summary statistics of raw data and change from baseline values (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum), and by [CONTACT_374238]. Vital signs will be summarized presenting statistics of raw data and change from baseline values (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum).  
ECG data will be summarized presenting statistics of raw data and change from baseline values (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum). In addition, 12-lead ECGs will be analyzed with a focus on the incidence and extent of QTc prolongation. QTc will be calculated according to Fridericia 
formula. Frequencies for classes of absolute values and differences from baseline will be provided 
according to the classifications defined by [CONTACT_12212]-E14.  
The World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO -DD) will be used for coding of concomitant 
medications (except IMPs).

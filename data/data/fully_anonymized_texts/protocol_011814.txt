3. INTRODUCTION  
Background/Significance  
Excessive weight  gain and its cardiometabolic  sequela  are frequent  complications of hypothalamic  
tumors,  a condition  known as hypothalamic  obesity  (HO). Most tumors in this region  are 
craniopharyngiomas  (CP),1 which  constitute  5–9% of childhood  brain  tumors.2,[ADDRESS_1226167] more features  of the metabolic  syndrome  compared  to matched  
controls.4,5 Overall,  a 3-19-fold higher  cardiovascular  mortality  had been  reported,6,7 and a recent  
nationwide population -based  study  in Sweden demonstrated  increased  rates for  cerebral  infarction  (7- 
fold),  death  due to  cerebrovascular  diseases  (5-fold), and type 2 diabetes  mellitus (6-fold) in CP patients  
in comparison  to the  general  population.[ADDRESS_1226168]  satiety  signaling  pathways.19, 26-28 Structural  damage in these  
nuclei  often  lead to uncontrolled appetite,  rapid  weight  gain,  central  insulin and leptin  resistance,  
decreased  sympathetic  activity,  low energy  expenditure (EE),  and increased  energy  storage  in adipose  
tissue.13,19  Recently,  our group developed  a semi-quantitative  assessment  of hypothalamic damage  on 
brain magnetic resonance  imaging  (MRI)  to predict  the risk for HO development  in CP .[ADDRESS_1226169] (GLP1RA)  in rats20

BMI reduction.  Using  these  data,  we have  designed  a prospective,  multicenter  trial that will examine the 
effects  of GLP1RA  on BMI,  cardiovascular  disease  (CVD)  risk factors,  energy  homeostasis  and other  
factors  in subjects  with HO secondary  to CP  or other hypothalamic tumors .

Protocol v. 10.0  7 November  2018   4. STUDY  DESIGN  AND METHODOLOGY  
Specific  Aims  and Hypotheses  
Specific  Aim 1: To test  effects  of GLP1RA on hypothalamic  obesity prospectively.  We hypothesize  
that treatment  with GLP1RA  will significantly  reduce  adiposity  in patients with HO. We furthermore  
hypothesize  that GLP1RA  treatment  will lead to increased satiety.  To this  end, we propose  to conduct a  
double blind, placebo -controlled,  randomized  trial of once weekly  extended  release exenatide (ExQW)  
on metabolic and  clinical  outcomes.  Following  baseline  testing,  48 patients  (10-25y at time of 
enrollment)  with HO will be  randomly  assigned  with equal  allocation  to ExQW or matching  placebo  
injection  for [ADDRESS_1226172]. 
 
Specific  Aim 2: To determine  effects  of GLP1RA  on cardiometabolic  risk factors.  We hypothesize  
that GLP1RA will also lead to (1) favorable  changes in  blood glucose,  lipid profile,  and inflammatory  
marker,  and (2) reduced  insulin secretion  during an  oral glucose  tolerance  test. In the same  cohort, we  
will examine  changes  in blood glucose,  lipid profile, inflammatory  markers, and insulin resistance by 
[CONTACT_877476].  
 
Specific  Aim 3: To explore  additional outcome  measures,  and predictors  of treatment  responses.  
HO represents  a disorder  of energy  homeostasis.  
Aim 3 A: To test the  hypothesis  that GLP1RA will  normalize  homeostasis  by [CONTACT_877477] . This and prior  hypotheses  allow  us to test potential  predictors  of treatment  outcomes.  
Aim 3 B: To test the  hypotheses  that (1) a lower hypothalamic lesion score and (2) lower fasting serum  
leptin as well as (3) higher pretreatment  hyperphagia will be associated  with better  BMI outcomes.  
The study  will include  brain lesion  scoring,  behavioral and hormonal  measures, free -living  total daily  
energy  expenditure by [CONTACT_877478]  (DLW),  energy  intake by 24h dietary  recall,  and activity  by 
[CONTACT_55629].  
 
Overview/Scope  
Study  Design  
The proposed study  is a multi -site 36-week  double -blind,  placebo -controlled  randomized  trial followed  
by [CONTACT_1629] 18-week open  label extension  with all patients  receiving  the GLP1RA treatment.  Therefore,  each 
subject  will be treated  for a total of 54 wk. Subjects will be  required  to travel  to one  of three  research  
sites (Seattle,  Nashville,  St. Paul).  A flowchart  for scheduled  study  visits (SVs)  is outlined below.  
Before  study  start,  there  will be an investigator  kickoff  and training  meeting  guided  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Yanovski  
from  Seattle  Children’s  to coordinate  and align  all assessments  and interventions.  In addition,  Seattle  
Children’s  radiology  center  will provide standardized  protocols  to the other  two imagin g centers  for 
consistent  imaging  techniques  and analyses.  During  the study  and after ending  the intervention,  there  
will be  bimonthly  investigator  phone  or video  conferences.  
 
Time Frame/Duration  
The timeline for research  activities  is four  years.   This is outlined  as: Years  1-3: Enrollment  and 
treatment  at 3 study  sites.  Years  3 and 4: hormonal  assays.  Year  4: completion of  final data analyses.  
 
Each  patient  will be in the  study  for [ADDRESS_1226173] effects  on energy  balance  in hypothalamic  obesity  
Protocol v. 10.0  7 November  2018   Data  Requirements  
A database  will be  designed for  this study  using  REDCap  (Research  Electronic  Data Capture)  hosted at 
the Institute of Translational Health  Sciences  of which Seattle  Children’s  and University  of Washington  
are partners.  REDCap  is a secure,  web-based  application  designed  to support data capture  for research  
studies,  providing  validated  data entry,  audit  trails,  and mechanisms  for securely  importing  and 
exporting  data.  It will reside on a  secure  server  with exclusive  access  by [CONTACT_877479].  Access  is tailored  for specific  roles  to maintain  blinding.  Subjects  are identified  with a study  
identification  number.  
 
Study  Measures  
Anthropometric  measures.  Anthropometric  measurements including  height, weight,  waist, and hip 
circumference as  well as Tanner  pubertal  staging  will be  collected  (see Fig. 1) at every  visit (except  6 
weeks).  Anthropometric  measures  were  selected  based  on (1) prior  demonstration  as a predictor  of child  
outcomes  in pediatric  weight control,  and (2) being  measures  of treatment  change.  Weight  and height:  
Participant  height  will be  assessed  as the average  of three repeated measures using  a calibrated  
stadiometer.  Weight  will be  assessed  in light clothing  as the average of three  repeated  measures  on a 
calibrated  electronic scale.  In addition,  we will measure  waist  and hip circumference. We  will take all 
measurements  three  times according  to guidelines  (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm ) and record  the 
average measurements.   Heart  rate (HR)  and resting  office blood pressure (BP) will be measured  with 
an aneroid  sphygmomanometer  according  guidelines  of the  National  High  Blood  Pressure  Education  
Program,51 as successfully  used in other multicenter  pediatr ic studies.52 Body  fat assessment:  BMI  will 
be calculated  as kg/m2. We  will use %  change in BMI to allow for comparison  over various  age groups.  
Dual  energy  x-ray absorptiometry  (DEXA)  will be adjusted  for height,  age, sex, and race as covariates,  
and used to measure body  fat as an additional  descriptive parameter  for adiposity.  
 
Energy  expenditure measures . There  is no previous study  examining  the impact of GLP1RA  treatment  
on EE in subjects  with CP, a  population suffering from  decreased  resting  metabolic rate and physical  
activity.53-56 Total daily  energy  expenditure  (total EE, kcal/day)  will be  measured  using  doubly  
labeled  water (DLW).  Total EE comprises  resting  metabolic rate,  thermic  effect  of meals, and physical  
activity  EE. All three  components can be accurately  determined  by [CONTACT_877480],  
DLW  under  free living conditions over a period  of two  wk.57,58  Through  periodic urine  collection,  DLW  
estimates  carbon dioxide production  by [CONTACT_877481]  (2H) and 
oxygen -18 (18O) from  the body.47 The DLW  is a reference method for measurements of average total  
EE for a period of  10-14 days in free -living  individuals tested  in a variety  of pediatric59-61 and adult62 
populations, and individuals  with various  diseases.63-65 The DLW  protocol  will be  coordinated  by [CONTACT_877482]  (M. Buchowski  – Director, see letter of  support) in  
collaboration  with the  Gas-Isotope -Ratio  Mass  Spectrometry  Laboratory  at Baylor  College of 
Medicine's  USDA/ARS  Children's  Nutrition Research  Center (DLW  Lab - Dr. W. Wang,  Director).  
Participants  from  all sites will receive  a DLW  sample  and will collect  urine  according  to the  protocol  
schedule.  Baseline urine samples  will be  collected  at the clinic visits while day  7 and day 14 samples  
will be  mailed from  home.   After  drinking  the doubly  labeled  water  at the site, subjects  will be  
instructed  to rinse  the glass  and to drink  the rinse  water;  they will be  asked  to repeat  this step (rinsing  
and drinking a total of two times). They  will be  asked to void and the urine  sample will be  discarded.  
The next two patient  voids (at 2 hours and 6 hours) will be  collected  for isotope analysis  (deuterium  and 
18O) at Baylor  University. Urine  samples  will be  collected  at day [ADDRESS_1226174] effects  on energy  balance  in hypothalamic  obesity  
Protocol v. 10.0  7 November  2018   Physical activity . In one of our prior studies  with CP patients,  we assessed  physical  activity  by 
[CONTACT_91152].54 In the proposed study,  subjects’ physical  activity  will be  measured  by [CONTACT_877483]3M accelerometer,  worn on the non-dominant  wrist.  To measure  activity  and sleep duration, subjects  
will wear  the actigraph  monitor  continuously  for [ADDRESS_1226175] used these  
devices  before.  The actigraphs  used are  small and unobtrusive, and can provide a  reliable  and valid  
estimate of children’s  moderate -to-vigorous  physical  activity.66-[ADDRESS_1226176]  Interview,73-75 will 
be used to complement  actigraphy  data with descriptive self-reported  assessments of physical  activity.  
 
Behavioral,  and psychosocial  measures.  Energy  intake will be  assessed  by [CONTACT_877484]- 
Administered  24-Hour  Dietary  Recall  (ASA24 -Kids,  
http://appliedresearch.cancer.gov/tools/instruments/asa24/),  which  is a validated web-based  free method  
of a 24h dietary  recall  for children  [ADDRESS_1226177]’s  parents  will furthermore  complete  the 
Child Eating Behavior  Questionnaire  (CEBQ),76  or the Adult Eating Behavior Questionnaire (AEBQ) 
which  measures  positive  and negative  eating  behaviors  (food responsiveness,  enjoyment  of food,  
emotional  overeating,  desire  to drink, satiety  responsiveness,  slowness  in eating,  emotional  undereating 
and fussiness)  and the Hyperphagia Questionnaire77, a 13- item questionnaire  developed  for use in 
patients  with Prader -Willi  syndrome  but that has also been used to study  hyperphagic  behavior  in other  
populations.78-[ADDRESS_1226178] . At study  visits 1, 3 and 4 (0, 18 and 36 wk), subjects  will have an OGTT  (900-1100 AM)  in 
the fasting condition,   followed  at study  visits 0 and 36 wk by  a standardized  mixed meal  caloric  
preload  (macaroni  & cheese at 1100 AM)  and a free buffet  meal  (at 1230 PM). The buffet  meal  is an 
objective measure of satiety  as it assesses  food intake  and choice  after a caloric  preload.  The 
standardized  test meal  preloa d will provide 12%of estimated  daily  caloric  requirements,[ADDRESS_1226179] meal  is to ensure that study  participants  are in an  
equally  fed state (together  with oral glucose,  total preload  will be 22 -27% of estimated  daily  caloric  
intake).  Ninety  minutes later,  an ad libitum buffet  meal  will be served  consisting  of a wide  variety  of 
food items  and more  than the child’s  estimated  daily  calorie  requirements  will be offered  (5,000  kcal).  
Participants  will have access  to the buffet  for 30 min, after which  calorie intake  and composition  of 
consumed  foods  will be  measured  by [CONTACT_877485].  Hunger and fullness  will be assessed  
every  30 min from  fasting  state before  starting  the OGTT  until the end of the buffet  meal using  visual  
analog  scales  (VAS)83 to assess  subjective appetite, reliable  in children  over age 7 y,84 and used by [CONTACT_877486].85 
 
Metabolic  outcomes.  Blood  glucose,  insulin, lipid  panel,  hemoglobin  A1c,  and as a measure  of low- 
grade inflammation  C-reactive  protein  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_5019]-sensitive  (hsCRP) testing  at a central  lab 
(Northwest  Lipid  Research  Laboratories,  Seattle).  Glucose  tolerance will be assessed  by a 2-hour oral 
glucose  tolerance  test. After  placement  of an intravenous  catheter  (IV),  a baseline  blood sample will be  
collected  for measurement  of hemoglobin  A1C, and insulin (processed  by [CONTACT_279868]). A  2-h OGTT  
(1.75  g/kg Glucola [maximum  75 g]) will then be performed  with sample collection  at 0’, 30’, 60’, 90’ 
and 120’ for measurement of glucose and  insulin.  Samples  will be  placed  on ice, and will be  
centrifuged.  Leptin,  total adiponectin,  α-MSH,  and soluble leptin  receptor  (sOB -R) are potential  
indicators  of leptin sensitivity,86-89 and will be  assessed  in fasting  state (leptin, total adiponectin,  and 
sOB-R, R&D Systems,  Minneapolis,  MN; α -MSH, Phoenix  Pharmac.,  Belmont,  CA, the  assay  cross

adiponecti n ratio provides information  regarding  the risk of metabolic syndrome.90-93 All endocrine  
measures  will be  performed at the PI’s lab at Seattle Children’s  Research  Institute.  In our laboratory,  
intra-assay  coefficients  of variation  (CV) are <8%, and inter-assay  CVs are <10% for these  methods.  
For all  assays,  all samples will be  run in duplicate.  
 
OGTT  derived  measures.  The assessment  of dynamic  changes  of glucose  and insulin secretion  has clear  
advantages  over static tests such as fasting  insulin and glucose  levels.  Calculation models  have  been  
established for using  OGTT insulin and glucose  data to calculate first  and second phase insulin  
secretion  that correlate  well with clamp  data,  and give surrogates  for β-cell function  and insulin  
sensitivity.94-97 In our study,  we will assess  insulin sensitivity  by [CONTACT_877487]  
(WBISI)  that encompasses both hepatic and  peripheral  tissue  insulin sensitivity.[ADDRESS_1226181] phase  insulin respons e to oral glucose  will be  calculated  by [CONTACT_877488]  (IGI),  which  is a surrogate  of the β-cell function,95 using  the formula:  IGI = (Ins 30 min- 
Ins0min)/(Gluc 30 min-Gluc 0min).94 Insulin  resistance  will be  also estimated  by [CONTACT_877489] (HOMA -IR).[ADDRESS_1226182]  resolution at 2 mm slice thickness  for T2- 
weighted  series.  These  parameters are substantially  improved  compared  to in vivo 1.5T (3 mm 
resolution)  work  of Makris100 in which a  segmentation  method for hypothalamus  subregions  using  7T 
scans  of ex vivo pathological  specimens  was developed  as a template.  We will assess  the topographic  
location  and size of damaged  brain areas  using  our established rating  system,  and also quantified  
measurement  of residual  lesion volume, ventricular  volumes , and hypothalamic  region  volumes,100 
using  a combination of  ITK-SNAP101 and MATLAB  (Mathworks,  Natick  MA)  for template  creation  as 
performed  in our previous  work.[ADDRESS_1226183] found  that this scoring  system  can be 
applied  effectively  even  with mildly  suboptimal  (fair to good) image quality.  We anticipate 40% of 
subjects  to undergo  MRI  examination  within [ADDRESS_1226184]  MRI scanner  techniques,  we do not anticipate  this will  
impede scoring  or quantifying  lesion/hypothalamic  region  volume. Furthermore,  where anatomical  
distortion  creates  deviations  from  the published  rule-set for  hypothalamic  sub-regions,  we will develop  
a new adaptive landmark  approach  to obtain  an estimate  of total lesion  and hypothalami c sub- 
measurement.  Given these  acquired  and measured  variables,  we anticipate  rating  and volumetric  indices  
will be  available  for the  entire  sample precluding  subjects where  patient  motion makes  hypothalamic  
sub-region  delineation  challenging  (anticipated  to be 5%).  All imaging  studies,  including  those obtained  
at other  facilities  will be burned  on CD and mailed to Seattle  Children's  to be analyzed  by a single  
central  reader blinded  to treatment  and clinical  data ([CONTACT_306294], neuroradiologist  at Seattle  Children’s)  to 
determine presence  and extent of  hypothalamic involvement  according  to our  scoring  system  and 
analytic methods proposed.  
 
Drug/Device,  Handling,  Storage  
The IND is:  [ADDRESS_1226185] effects  on energy  balance  in hypothalamic  obesity  
Protocol v. 10.0  7 November  2018   Rationale  for Medication  
Currently  available  GLP1RAs include  a variety  of schedules:  twice daily  (exenatide),  once daily  
(liraglutide),  and once  weekly  (exenatide,  albiglutide, and dulaglutide).  Alternatively,  levels  of native  
GLP-1 can be increased  by [CONTACT_877490]  4 (DPP -4), a protease  that rapi[INVESTIGATOR_877461] -1. However,  DPP-4 inhibitors  do not inhibit  appetite  or lead to body  weight  reduction.  
Liraglutide,  the active  ingredient  in Saxenda®, was recently  approved  as a weight  loss medication  
showing  a 7.3%  decrease  in body  weight  over a  56 wk trial in adults with severe  obesity.104,105  
However,  this drug  has not been  made available  for use in pediatric  studies  and this is not expected  to 
change in the  near future  (personal  communication with Medical  Director,  Obesity  at Novo Nordisk  
Inc). Therefore,  we decided to use  the extended -release GLP -[ADDRESS_1226186]  
issues  that could pose  barriers  to therapy.  This drug contains exenatide,  which  is a 39-amino -acid 
synthetic  version of  exendin -4 that shares  approximately  50% sequence  identity  with human  GLP-1. In 
previous  studies  of adults  with T2DM,  ExQW showed  slightly  larger  reductions in body  weight  
compared  with twice  daily  exenatide,  although  this difference was statistically  not different.[ADDRESS_1226187] 
frequent  with ExQW.33,106 -108  ExQW  contains  exenatide encapsulated  in microspheres  consisting  of a 
medical -grade biodegradable  poly-(d,l-lactide -co-glycolide)  polymer, which  has been used in other  
medical  applications  since  1984, and allows  for slow, continuous  release of the active agent into  
circulation  following  injection.34,[ADDRESS_1226188] weekly  phone  calls when  not coming for  a study  visit, to check  adherence  and any 
potential  
adverse  effects.  Any evidence for adverse  effects  will be  discussed  with the  PI [INVESTIGATOR_877462].  
 
All study  medication  will be  stored/locked  in the  investigational  pharmacy  under  appropriate  
temperature conditions.   Dispensing  and accountability  records will be maintained  by [CONTACT_877491].  
 
Analysis  
Analysis  plan and sample size calculations  by [CONTACT_45061].  
 
The research  team  includes personnel  with statistical  and data  management  expertise for overseeing  data 
collection,  storage methods, and the following analyses  (see letter  of support, [CONTACT_877516]).  Adherence  
data collected  during  the placebo  run-in phase  will be summarized  descriptively.  All subjects  
completing  the run -in phase  will go on to the  randomized treatment  phase.  The primary  analyses  will 
use the  intention -to-treat (ITT)  approach; i.e., subjects  will be  analyzed  according  to their randomized  
assignment  regardless  of treatment  received.  In addition, data  of all completers  will be  analyzed  
separately  as a sensitivity  analysis.  While  every  attempt will be  made  to collect  complete  data and retain  
all subjects,  all sample size  and power  calculations account  for dropout.  Statistical  methods  have been  
selected  to allow  for inclusion of partial  data.  All testing  is two -sided and α=0.05.  Repeated  measures  
analyses  will be  conducted using  SAS (SAS  Institute,  Inc., Cary,  NC, [LOCATION_003])  or R (The  R Foundation  for

Aim 1: To test effects  of GLP1RA  on hypothalamic obesity  prospectively.  
 
Sample:  Available  anthropometry  measures  will be  included  in the  analyses (see  also Fig. 1 below).  
 
Primary  outcome  analysis: For efficacy  analysis  the primary  outcome  is % change in BMI from week  0 
(baseline)  to 36 wk. A pi[INVESTIGATOR_91909]  (separating  the randomized  and run out phases)  linear mixed -effects  
mode l111 will be  fit with % change in BMI from baseline  to 36  wk as the outcome; treatment,  time,  and 
the interaction  between  treatment  and time  as factors of  interest;  and randomization stratification  
variables  (site,  age, and gender)  included as covariates. This model  is a generalization  of analysis  of 
covariance (ANCOVA)  that 
allows  all follow -up repeated  
measures  to be  included.  
Baseline  BMI will be  
considered  as an additional  
covariate.  A spatial  power  
within -subject  correlation  
matrix  will be  used to account  
for the correlated  repeated  
measures.  Separate  contrasts  
based  on the interaction  
between  treatment  and time will be used to specifically  test for a  significant  difference in % change  in 
BMI from baseline to [ADDRESS_1226192] - 
treatment  and 54 wk  (end of open  
label  extension). Additionally,  
descriptive summaries  will be

size of 24  subjects  per group  (19 evaluable)  will provide  85% power to detect  relative  treatment  effect  
sizes of 1 or  greater  (in absolute value)  for % change in BMI,  which is consistent with the  preliminary  
data.  
 
Expected  result:  We expect  GLP1RA  treatment  will reduce  BMI (primary  efficacy  endpoint).  Further  
we expect  that GLP1RA  treatment  will reduce total  body  fat mass  and increase  satiety  (assessed  by 
[CONTACT_877492]).  
 
Aim 2: To determine effects  of GLP1RA  on cardiometabolic risk  factors. Secondary  outcomes  analysis:  
Secondary  outcomes  are change in the  following  metabolic CVD  risk factors: blood glucose,  
triglycerides,  HDL  cholesterol,  and hsCRP. All continuous secondary  efficacy  endpoints  will be  
analyzed  using  similar  repeated  measures analyses  to those  previously  described for the primary  
outcome  to examine  differences  in the  change in secondary  outcomes, one at time,  from  baseline to [ADDRESS_1226198] whether  treatment  effects  are beneficial  during  the second  half of 
intervention.  Sample size and power:  Table [ADDRESS_1226199]  sizes in our  preliminary  
study  for between treatment  comparison  of change  from  baseline to 3 mo (dataset  from  previous  
study22). Assuming  a normal distribution of changes,  a type I error  rate of 0.05,  and dropout  rate of up to  
20%,  a sample size of 24  subjects  per group  (19 evaluable)  will provide 85%  power  to detect  relative  
treatment  effect  sizes of  1 or greater  (in absolute  value)  for changes  in cardiometabolic  risk factors  in 
patients  with HO, which  is consistent with the  preliminary  study.  
 
Expected  results  and benchmarks  for success  (secondary  efficacy  endpoints): We  expect  that GLP1RA  
treatment  will lead to improved  metabolic CVD  risk factors  (higher  HDL;  lower blood pressure,  blood  
glucose,  hsCRP, and triglycerides).  
 
Aim 3: To exp lore additional  outcome  measures,  and predictors  of treatment  responses.  
3a: Test GLP1RA  treatment on energy  homeostasis. Sample:  All available  EE and energy  intake  
measures  from DLW  analyses  and ASA24 dietary  recalls  at 0 and 36 wk will be  included  in the  
analyses  (see Fig. 1). Tertiary  outcomes analysis:  The tertiary  outcomes are  change  in EE and energy  
intake from  baseline to [ADDRESS_1226200]  sizes and  inform  the design of  
future studies.  
 
Sample size and power:  Assuming  a normal distribution of differences,  a type I error  of 0.05,  and a 
dropout  rate of up to 20%, a  final evaluable  sample size  of 19  subjects  per group  will provide  85% 
power  to detect  relative  changes  (average change  divided  by [CONTACT_525614]  (SD)  of the 
change)  in EE  in relation  to energy  intake or energy  intake in relation to EE of  approximately  [ADDRESS_1226201] effects  on energy  balance  in hypothalamic  obesity  
Protocol v. 10.0  7 November  2018   pooled SDs of EE per DLW  measures were 162 kcal/d and 155 kcal/d, respectively.  Assuming  a 
moderate  correlation  between  baseline  and follow -up measures  (r=0.5),  this would correspond  to 
detectable differences  of one pooled SD, or  162 kcal/d and 155 kcal/d,  respectively.  Expected  results  
and benchmarks  for success (exploratory  efficacy  endpoints):  We expect  that GLP1RA  will lead to 
increased  EE adjusted  for Δ  BMI and Δ energy  intake.  
 
3b: Determine predictors  of GLP1RA  treatment  success.  Sample:  Pretreatment metabolic parameters  
and EE measures  from  DLW  analyses  (see Fig. 1), and all available  outcomes measures  will be  included  
in the  analyses  (collected  at 0 and 36 wk). Outcome measures and  exploratory  analyses:  Potential  
predictors  will be  considered  one at a time.  Potential predictors  include  a hypothalamic lesion score;  
hyperphagia;  EE; and the metabolic predictors  leptin, adiponectin,  sOB-R, α-MSH,  HOMA -IR, WBISI  
including  a leptin/Ob -R ratio.[ADDRESS_1226202] -surgery  
lesion score (=standard  approach  for all subjects)  and the response to GLP1RA  treatment,  we will 
perform  a measurement study  using  high resolution  images  that would  allow  parcellation of  the 
hypothalamus  and surrounding  areas.  We expect  that we  will obtain images in the required  high 
resolution  quality  in a subgroup of patients  (50%;  n=24).  We will use these  images  for exploratory  
volumetric  as well as topographic  studies  and will test if lesion volume or  deficiencies  in certain  brain  
areas  are associated  with obesity  outcomes  or response  to treatment  using  analyses  similar  to those  
described  for lesion  score.  These  exploratory  measurement studies may be important  for generating  
future hypotheses.  A linear mixed -effects  model  will be fit with % change  in BMI  from  basel ine to 
follow -up as the outcome; treatment,  time,  the interaction  between  treatment and time,  the potential  
predictor,  and interactions between  the potential  predictor and treatment,  time and treatment  x time as 
factors  of interest.  Covariates and within -subject  correlation  matrix  are as described  for Specific  Aim 1.  
Exploratory  analyses  will examine  eating  behavior  and fat and total calorie  intake  as additional  
covariates.  A contrast  based on the interaction  between  the potential  predictor and treatment  x time will 
be used to estimate  the direction  and magnitude of the potential  predictor on treatment  response  at 36 
wk. Predictors  will be  standardized  to be unitless, dividing  by [CONTACT_877493].  
 
Sample size and power:  For this exploratory  aim no formal  power calculations  are conducted. Analyses  
will focus  on the  direction  and magnitude of effects for  use in planning  future studies. Expected  results  
and interpretation:  We expect  the degree of % change in BMI reduction  (1) is positively  associated  with 
the degree of hyperphagia assessed  by [CONTACT_877494],  and (2) higher  energy  expenditure at  baseline;  (3) is  
negatively  associated  with insulin and leptin resistance  as measured  by [CONTACT_877495],  HOMA -IR, and leptin at  
baseline,  and (4) is negatively  associated  with the  post-operative hypothalamic  lesion score (e.g.,  a 
higher  score indicating  greater  hypothalamic damage).  
 
5. SUBJECTS  
Subjects  
It is anticipated  approximately  16 participants  will be  treated  per year (5-6 per study  site) during  the first 
three  years  of the study.  We expect  to screen  80 subjects to get 48 subjects enrolled  and 38 to complete  
the study  (potential  dropout rate of rate of 20%).  Subjects  will be  between  the ages of 10 -25 y old at  
time of  enrollment  (11-27 y at end of intervention), and we expect  each patient to complete  the [ADDRESS_1226203].  
 
Enrollment  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_877463]/assent  subject  or designate  other qualified study  staff to do 
so. Qualified  participants  will start with a  2-week  placebo  run-in to test adherence to the  protocol.  
Immediately  afterwards,  subjects  will be  assigned  treatment  using  a permuted -block randomization  
(1:1)  with varying  block  sizes con structed by  [CONTACT_2005]’s  Core for  Biomedical  Statistics (CCBS)  of 
Seattle  Children’s  Research  Institute (SCRI)  stratified  by [CONTACT_82385], two age  groups  (10-14y, 15-25y),  
and gender.  This is a double -blind  study  (participants and investigators  both blinded). The  study  
statistician  will be blinded as well;  a second  statistician not involved in the conduct  of the  study  will be  
responsible  for the final preparation  of the randomization scheme.  Only  the independent  CCBS  
statistician  and dispensing  pharmacy  at each site will know assigned  study  medications.  It is anticipated  
approximately  16 participants  will be  treated  per year (5-6 per study  site) during  the first three  years  of 
the study.  We expect  to screen  80 subjects to get 48 subjects  enrolled  and 38 to complete the  study  
(potential  dropout rate of rate of 20%).  As we  would expect  many  of these  participants  to be 
prepubertal  as they  have  hypogonadotropic  hypogonadism by [CONTACT_877496],  pubertal  status  will 
not be used as an inclusion or  exclusion  criteria  for the study.

6. STUDY  PROCEDURES  
For the placebo -controlled portion  of the trial, each subject  will have  a screening  visit and 4 study  
visits  (weeks  0 [baseline],  6, 18, 36 [end of  randomized  trial]).  Week  36 will also mark  the 
beginning  of the  open  label  extension phase which  will continue until week  54. 
 
Screening  Visit:  The study  will be  explained to patients and their families  and written  consent/assent  
will be  obtained.  Medical  history  and concomitant  medications  will be documented.  Vital signs  will 
be recorded,  including  blood pressure,  heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_420138].  Body  weight  
(lightly  clothed) and  height  will be measured  with a  calibrated  electronic scale and calibrated 
stadiometer.  Hip and waist  circumference  measurements  will be  completed. A physical  exam 
including Tanner  staging  will be  done.  This visit will  also include:  
 Blood  draw  for safety  labs (electrolytes,  CBC, lipase,  amylase,  glucose,  transaminases  (ALT,  
AST),  creatinine,  hemoglobin  A1c,  and thyroid hormones [TSH and free T4, or  in patients 
with panhypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297],  free T4 only])  
o Blood  for carcinoembryonic  antigen  (CEA)  and calcitonin  samples  
 Blood  for DNA  extraction  will be  obtained  for genetic markers  (only  at select sites)  
 Urine  pregnancy  testing  (HCG)  will be  done  
 Instructions for 24h dietary  recall.  
 
Sexually  active  female  participants  are required  to use birth control,  unless they  have  documented  
gonadotropin  deficiency.  
 
Parents  and participants  (if appropriate)  will be taught  how to mix  and inject  the study  medication.  
Parents/participants  should perform  a return  demonstration  before mixing  the actual  study  medication.  
All teaching  will be  documented.  Prior  to leaving  the clinic,  parents/participants  will inject  the first 
dose of study  medication  under  supervision.  Dosing  will be  documented on the dosing  log.  
Participants  will be  dispensed  1 more vial of  study  medication (placebo)  to be  administered  at home  
the following  week.   The dose will be  identical  to the dosing  provided in the blinded portion  of the 
trial. 
 
Study  Visits  (SVs):  After  the initial screening  visit, there  will be  5 study  visits (see overview  and 
measures  in Fig. 1) to assess  adherence,  drug safety,  outcomes,  and to distribute  the drug  or placebo.  
Hypoglycemia medications will be adjusted  as needed.   During  the duration  of the treatment,  subjects  
with persistent  abdominal  pain and nausea/vomiting  will discontinue  study  medication  and be 
evaluated  for acute  pancreatitis  and cholecystitis.  In children,  most adverse  effects  are mild GI effects  
that are transient.117 Subjects  not tolerating  their current  dose will be discontinued  from  study  at PI’s 
discretion.  Study  medication  will resume if and only if no significant adverse  event is found and 
subjects  concur.  Subjects  need to fast and refrain  from  exercise  for ten hours  prior  to study  visits for  
fasting  blood draws.  Physical  exams including Tanner  staging,  and inspection  of injection  sites will 
be done  at all visits  (except  no Tanner  staging  at 6 weeks visit).  If a subject withdraws from the 
study or is withdrawn by [CONTACT_877498], subjects will be asked to complete SV4 
study procedures, not incl uding the DEXA scan.

7. RISKS/BENEFITS  
 
Potential Risks  
The subjects  participating  in this study  will be  exposed  to physical,  psychological,  and financial  risks.  
Participation  in all aspects  of the  research  will be  voluntary.  Subjects,  their parents  or their  legal  
guardians  will be advised  that they  can withdraw  without penalty  or refuse  participation  in any portion  
of the study  at any time.  Overall  there  are moderate risks to subjects.  There  is a risk of breach  of patient  
confidentiality.  
 
Potential risks to the  participants  enrolled  in the  study  include:  
 
1. Discomfort  from  hunger  due to 10h fasting  until 8:30 AM at four of the study  visits (week  0, 18,  
36, 54). 
2. Pain,  minor injury  (bruising),  nausea,  infection  or the development  of a localized inflammation  
(thrombophlebitis)  from  placement  of an intravenous  catheter  and obtaining  serial  blood  
samples.  Rarely  some  people faint.  
3. Loss of a small volume  of blood (16-20 ml at the screening  visit and  week  54 visits; 9 -13 ml at 
week  6 visit; and  32-36 ml per OGTT study  visit at weeks  0, 18,  and 36). 
4. Patients  will have a brain  MRI  if there  was no recent MRI within 6 months prior  to enrollment  in 
the study.  Potential risks from  the MRI  include  anxiety,  claustrophobic reactions  or discomfort  
due to high noise,  need to maintain a  fixed posture,  and/or  interference  between  unidentified  
metal  inside or  outside  the body  and the scanner.  The overall  safety  of MRI  is well established.  
All MRI  pulse sequences  used are within FDA  guidelines  for time-varying magnetic fields.  
Additionally,  echo -planar  imaging  (EPI)  conveys  the potential  for damage  to subjects'  hearing  as 
the EPI  [INVESTIGATOR_877465]  [ADDRESS_1226209] effects  on energy  balance  in hypothalamic  obesity  
Protocol v. 10.0  7 November  2018   decrease the sound delivered  by 40 dB,  greatly  reducing  the intensity  of the  sound. Participants  
will be  able to hear verbal commands given  via the sound attenuating  headphones  that are at the 
volume  level  of conversational  speech.  
5. This research  study  involves  exposure  to very  low dose radiation  from  two DEXA  whole  body  
scans . Each DEXA exposes the patient t o the equivalent of less than one day of background 
radiation.  
6. There is a slight risk of skin irritation  during  an ECG from  the electrodes  or gel that is used.  
 
7. Participants  may find it bothersome  to answer  the investigator’s  questions.  
 
8. Discomfort,  significant  hyperglycemia,  nausea,  a reaction  or sensitivity  triggered  by [CONTACT_877500]. Discomfort,  nausea,  or a reaction from  an unidentified  food allergy  or 
sensitivity  to used study  foods.  
9. The DLW  tracer is made up of  the stable  isotopes  of hydrogen  (2H) and oxygen  (18O) and 
therefore does  not gives  out harmful  radiation.  These  stable isotopes are found naturally  in our  
drinking  water  and in our  bodies.  These isotopes  have been used extensively  to measure body  
composition  and energy  expenditure in premature  infants,  newborns,  toddlers, children,  
adolescents,  and pregnant and lactating  women with no adverse  effects.   The deuterium  oxide  
has been used across  the world  to measure  human  breast  milk intakes  in infants  from  newborns  
to [ADDRESS_1226210] warfarin  is metabolized.  Exenatide is FDA approved  for 
treatment  of people  with diabetes.  Because  the treatment in this study  is investigational,  there  
may be risks  that we  do not know about  at this time.  
In a recent  multicenter  study  including  461 adults  with T2DM treated  with ExQW for 26 weeks,  
61% of patients  had one or  more  adverse events  (AEs).[ADDRESS_1226211] frequent  
were  injection site reactions  (10%  injection -site nodule, 4%  subcutaneou s nodule, 3%  injection - 
site pruritus,  3% nodule,  2% injection -site erythema),  followed  by 9% developed nausea,  7% 
nasopharyngitis,  6% diarrhea,  6% headache,  5% decreased  appetite,  5% constipation, 4%  
vomiting  , 3% dizziness,  3% upper  respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -tract infection,  3% abdominal pain, 2%  
dyspepsia,  2% unexpected therapeutic  response,  and 2%  bronchitis.  These results  were  similar  to 
another  clinical  trial of adults with T2DM  treated  with ExQW up  to 2 years.37 Here  80% of 
subjects  reported  at least one AE, most frequently  nausea  (17%), injection  site nodule (12%)  and 
nasopharyngitis  (12%).  Overall  expected  AEs associated  with the GLP -[ADDRESS_1226212]  ExQW may

DURATION study  trials  the rates of gastrointestinal  adverse  events  associated with ExQW  
treatment  were  for nausea 9.3 -26.4%,  diarrhea  6.1-18%,  vomiting  3.7-11%,  and constipation  
4.6-10.8%.34,109  For example,  in a study  of non-diabetic patients,  25% experienced  nausea  of 
mild to moderate  severity.118 The severity  and incidence  of nausea  does decrease over  time.  
Pancreatic AEs:  Controversial  data exist regarding  the risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_877466]-1 agonists.119,120  A recent  integrated  safety  analysis  from 19 completed  
randomized  controlled  trials,  composite exposure -adjusted  incidence  rates for pancreatitis  
among  exenatide twice  daily  users (n=3,261)  and a pooled comparator  group  (n=2,333) were  not 
statistically  different.121 However,  the current  package  insert  recommends  that ExQ W be  
discontinued  immediately  if pancreatitis  is suspected.  
 
Risk for hypoglycemia:  In a 24-week  monotherapy  study  of exenatide in subjects with type 2 
diabetes,  there  was an approximately  5% incidence  of minor hypoglycemia.122 These epi[INVESTIGATOR_877467],  glucagon  or further  medical  attention.  The addition  of exenatide to metformin  therapy  
does not increase the risk of hypoglycemia.123 The overall  reported  rates for mild hypoglycemia  
were  0-5%; symptomatic  hypoglycemia has  not been seen in non -diabetic  patients treated  with 
exenatide.118,124

Kidney  AEs:  Exenatide is cleared  by [CONTACT_877502].  There  have  been  post-marketing  
reports  of altered  renal  function in patients taking  exenatide.  It is not clear  whether  the alteration  
in renal  function  is due  to exenatide use, but the  FDA  recommends  that exenatide not be used in 
patients  with renal  impairment.  
Cardiovascular  AEs:  Exenatide may cause heart  rate to increase by [CONTACT_2902]  [ADDRESS_1226216] effects  on energy  balance  in hypothalamic  obesity  
Protocol v. 10.0  7 November  2018   in blood pressure  with exenatide therapy.109,122,130  In one 30 week  trial of exenatide  versus  
placebo,  the between -group  difference was a 4.4 mmHg  reduction  in systolic blood pressure  and 
3.4 mmHg  in diastolic  blood pressure  for the exenatide  group.131 The same  study  did show a  
between -group  difference  in heart  rate with a 3 beat per  minute (95% CI,  0.8-5.2) increase in the  
exenatide group.131 The clinical  importance of the increased  heart rate is unknown. The long 
term effects  of exenatide  on cardiovascular  even ts are unknown. Change  of QT interval  was 
small and clinically  insignificant.  Intervention  over periods  of more  than 6  months has shown  
small favorable  effects  on cardiovascular  risk factors and  biomarkers,  i.e. reductions  from  
baseline in systolic  blood  pressure,  total cholesterol and low -density  lipoprotein cholesterol  
(LDL),  as well as triglycerides.

Allergic reactions  and injection  site reactions:  Some  people  will have mild skin redness,  itching  
or bruising at the site of medication  injection.31,38  Rarely,  the medication  can cause  an allergic  
reaction.  Antibody  formation does occur with exenatide, as is expected  with an injected  amino  
acid.133 The prevalence of antibody  formation  was 27-28%.[ADDRESS_1226218]  was treated with epi[INVESTIGATOR_877468].  Injection  site reactions  are mild, include

at the three study  centers.  
Methods to Minimize Risks  
Risks will be  minimized  in a manner  specific  to each procedure  referenced  above.  The risk to  
participants’  privacy  is minimal and every  effort  will be tak en to maintain  confidentiality.  Risks to  
participants  are minimized  by [CONTACT_877503].  The investigators  of the three  study  sites are 
experienced  in reviewing and obtaining consent  and assent.  All study  procedures  will be  performed  by 
[CONTACT_877504].  The main risk is breach  of patient  
confidentiality.  However, this risk is minimized  by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_877469] a locked  office,  and 
maintaining  computerized  records  in the password  protected  REDCap  database. Researchers  are trained  
in HIPAA privacy  regulations  and other  applicable privacy  policies.  No information will be released,  
nor will participation  in the research  be acknowledged,  to any party  except  where  compulsory  according  
Page [ADDRESS_1226220] effects  on energy  balance  in hypothalamic  obesity  
Protocol v. 10.0  7 November  2018   to law or University  policy.  There  may be unknown or  unan ticipated  adverse  effects  from participation  
in this study  for which  the Principal  Investigators  and study  team will remain  observant.  
 
Any unanticipated  adverse  events  will be  reported  by [CONTACT_794487]’s according  to applicable  IRB policy.  
The Principal  Investigators  are fully engaged  in the  actual  performance of the study  and this ensures  that 
adverse  events  would be  readily  known  and reported  by [CONTACT_224045].  As per the  Office  
for Human  Research Protections  (OHRP)  guidelines,  appropriate assent  and parental  consent will be  
obtained  in this study.  
 
Blood  draws:  The minimum amount of blood needed  for assays  will be  drawn. Blood  will be collected  
through  phlebotomy  (screening  and visits at weeks  6 and 54) or a small intravenous line (visits  at weeks  
0, 18, and 36) after anesthetizing  the skin with anesthetic cream.  Blood  draws during  study  visits at  
weeks  0, 18, and 36 (OGTT  tests),  require  a total amount  of 32-36 ml blood: 16-20 ml blood at baseline,  
and additionally,  4 blood  draws  of each 4 ml at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after the oral glucose  load.  Lab 
parameters  at the screening  visit and study  visit 5  (36 weeks)  require each  16-20 ml blood, and 9-13 ml 
at study  visit 2 (6 weeks). Total  estimated  amount  of blood per subject  equals to  137-161 ml or less 
during  the whole  12-month study.  
 
Hyperglycemia:  The oral glucose  load (1.75  g/kg,  max. 75 g) can lead to significant  hyperglycemia.  All 
patients  will be  screened  for diabetes  before  the study  will be  started. Any patient  that meets  the criteria  
for diabetes  mellitus  will be excluded  from  the OGTT  and referred  to the  diabetes outpatient clinic  for 
treatment.  Any subject  with insulin -treated  diabetes  mellitus or poorly  controlled  type 2 diabetes will be 
excluded from  the study  (see exclusion criteria).  If patients  develop  diabetes during  the study,  
management  will be  coordinated with their primary  endocrinologist.  
 
Nausea  and abdominal  discomfort: Due  to the  transient nature  of the  abdominal  discomfort  and nausea  
related  to the  study  drug,  and in order  to prevent  self-imposed  drug holidays,  all patients  who 
experience nausea  or abdominal discomfort  are asked to contact  [CONTACT_2362].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_877470] -limited side effect.  
 
Meals:  At weeks  0, [ADDRESS_1226221] an OGTT  (9:00 -11:00  AM) in the fasting condition,  
which  will be  followed  at weeks  0 and 36 by a standardized  mixed meal  caloric preload  (macaroni  & 
cheese  at 11:00 AM)  and a free buffet  meal  (at 12:30 PM). The test meal  (macaroni  & cheese) will be 
followed  by [CONTACT_877505] a wide  variety  of food items  and 
more  than 100%  of the  subject’s estimated  daily  calorie  requi rements. Children  will have access to the  
buffet  for 30 min., after which  calorie intake  and composition  of consumed  foods  will be measured  by 
[CONTACT_877485]. Subjects  will be  screened  for food allergies  and sensitivities.  In addition,  
all meals  will be  prepared  fresh  by [CONTACT_877506],  and stored  
under  adequate  conditions. Duration  of fasting  is limited  to 9:[ADDRESS_1226222]  water.  
 
Neuroimaging:  All subjects  have  had previous brain MRI  scans  before  participation in this study.  
However,  all subjects  and their  parents  will be  fully informed  prior  to beginning  the study  about  the 
MRI  procedure  to reduce  anxiety.  Subjects in the MRI  magnet  will be able to talk to the experimenters  
at all times  during  the assessments,  and are monitored  by [CONTACT_98991]. Should claustrophobia occur,  subjects  
will be  instructed  that they can communicate to the  MR technologist  if they  want  to stop the scan.  
Subjects  will have the option to discontinue  the experiment  at any time, and they will not be  
discouraged  from d oing so. There  are planned procedures  to minimize  potential risks of metal  
Page [ADDRESS_1226223]  with contraindication  to neuroimaging  by [CONTACT_877507].  Participants  will be able to hear 
verbal  commands  given  via the  sound -attenuating  headphones  that are at the volume  level  of 
conversational  speech.  During  MR scanning,  the subjects  will be  monitored  by [CONTACT_877508].  If any 
problems  arise,  the study  will be  terminated  immediately.  Additionally,  the subjects  will be  given  a call 
button that can be used at any time to stop the study.  
 
The Principal  Investigators  will be accessible  to answer  questions  and relieve  anxiety  whenever  
possible. Subjects,  or their  parents/legal  guardians,  may withdraw at any time or  refuse to participate  in 
all or part of any procedure  without penalty.  Subjects,  or their  parents/legal  guardians,  will have  the 
option to discontinue the experiment  at any  time,  and they  will not be discouraged  from doing  so. 
 
Potential Benefits  
Individuals :  The subjects  will have a DEXA  scan which  provides  information  on their  bone  density  
and body  composition.  They  will receive information about their metabolism,  such as how many  
calories  they burn per day. All subjects  will receive  the study  medication  during  the second phase  of the 
study.  Subjects  receiving Exenatide may experience weight  loss. 
 
Society :  This research  will test a promising  drug intervention  in the  treatment  of hypothalamic obesity.  
Furthermore,  the proposed work  will help us understand the biological mechanisms  involved in the  
development  of hypothalamic  obesity.  CP tumors  are the most  common  suprasellar tumors of nonglial  
origin in children.[ADDRESS_1226224]  from an improved  understanding  of the etiology of  
obesity,  and in particular  of hypothalamic  obesity,  with the  potential to lessen  the burden  on individual  
suffering  as well as health care costs.

and any serious  adverse events (SAEs)  in real -time. All SAEs and dose-limiting  toxicities will be 
reported  to the  independent Data Monitoring  Committee  (DMC) and IRB according  to the  approved  
Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Plan.  
 
External  monitoring  for the study  is provided by [CONTACT_877510]  (ITHS)  
of the University  of Washington,  and includes  regular  onsite data monitoring  and regular  review  by [CONTACT_109393] (5 members),  and the study  team (i.e. Principal  Investigators  and co-investigator).  
 
 
 
Page [ADDRESS_1226225].  Each study  site will report  AEs to their IRBs  as well according  
to their IRB guidelines.  In addition,  all AEs are reported according  to Seattle Children’s  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_877471].  
 
Serious  adverse  events  and dose-limiting  toxicities  are submitted within  one day of learning  of the event  
to the  IDMC  via the REDCap  SAE reporting  system.  Serious  adverse events will be  listed by  [CONTACT_877511] (MedDRA) system.  Study  data and study  
conduct  reports are prepared  by [CONTACT_877512],  drop-outs, protocol  
deviations,  and AEs in aggregate.  These  reports, including  safety  lab measures,  SAEs and dose-limiting  
toxicities will be provided  to the  IDMC  and the  study  team on a semi-annual  basis for  review.  
 
Monitoring  Reports  
The DMC provides  a written report  to the  study  team with recom mendations  for study  modification,  
study  continuation/discontinuation  as relevant.  The study  team  is responsible  for forwarding  the report  
to the  IRB. 
 
Performance,  Safety, and  Treatment  Issues  
A report  will be generated  semi -annually  by [CONTACT_877513].  This report  will include performance information including  participant recruitment  and retention,  
study  conduct, data  collection,  quality  control,  and completion,  and protocol adherence.  This report  will 
also include  safety  information, including  any adverse  events or dose -limiting  toxicities. The  report  will 
also include  results  from  treatment  integrity/fidelity  assessments  to ensure  the adequate  and consistent  
provision  of treatment.

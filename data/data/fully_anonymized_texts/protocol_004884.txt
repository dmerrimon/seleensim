Background	and	Rationale	for	Study	Functional	use	of	the	upper	limb	during	tasks	requires	coordination	of	joints	of	the	upper	extremity	(van	Andel,	Wolterbeek,	Doorenbosch,	Veeger,	&	Harlaar,	2008).		Persons	with	central	nervous	system	(CNS)	dysfunction	often	have	difficulty	incorporating	their	affected	limb	effectively	and	efficiently	into	functional	activities	due	to	muscle	weakness	and/or	spasticity	(Gillen,	2011).		Poor	functional	use	of	the	affected	limb	and/or	motor	recovery	may	lead	to	development	of	learned	nonuse	of	the	affected	limb	(Taub,	Uswatte,	&	Pi[INVESTIGATOR_509202],	1999),	compensatory	movement	patterns	(Mackey,	Walt,	&	Stott,	2006)	as	well	as	muscle	or	joint	contracture	(Milazzo	&	Gillen,	2011).		This	may	further	interfere	with	their	occupational	performance	and	restrict	life	roles.			Traditional	rehabilitation	interventions	emphasize	motor	training	on	the	reduction	of	spasticity	(Gillen,	2011).		However,	active	movement	and	muscle	strength	of	forearm	supi[INVESTIGATOR_509203],	rather	than	spasticity	(Braendvik,	Elvrum,	Vereijken,	&	Roeleveld,	2010;	O’Dwyer,	Ada,	&	Neilson,	1996).		In	contrast,	task-oriented	functional	training	trials,	such	as	the	occupational	therapy	(OT)	task-oriented	approach	(Almhdawi,	2011;	Flinn,	1995)	and	the	Constraint-Induced	Movement	Therapy	(Page,	Levine,	&	Leonard,	2005;	Page,	Levine,	Leonard,	Szaflarski,	&	Kissela,	2008;	Taub,	Uswatte,	&	Elbert,	2002;	Taub	et	al.,	2006;	Wolf	et	al.,	2008),	have	demonstrated	promising	evidence	that	persons	with	CNS	dysfunction	benefit	from	the	training	in	improvement	of	increase	functional	use	and	motor	function	of	the	affected	limb.		However,	the	role	of	forearm	movements	is	not	addressed	in	rehabilitation	interventions	literature.

	2	Occupational	therapi[INVESTIGATOR_509204]	(Milazzo	&	Gillen,	2011;	Watanabe,	2004).		Most	orthotic	designs	are	static	and	aimed	at	the	wrist	and/or	hand	with	purposes	of	spasticity	reduction,	correction	or	prevention	of	deformity	(Milazzo	&	Gillen,	2011).		However,	the	effects	remain	controversial	(Lannin	&	Herbert,	2003).		Given	that	static	orthoses	may	interfere	with	functional	performance	and	may	further	develop	muscle	or	joint	contracture,	compensatory	movements	or	learned	nonuse	of	the	affected	limb	(Mell,	Childress,	&	Hughes,	2005;	Milazzo	&	Gillen,	2011),	a	dynamic	or	mobilization	orthosis	can	be	considered	to	assist	or	enhance	functional	use	of	the	affected	limb	during	functional	tasks	(Dunning	et	al.,	2008;	Farrell,	Hoffman,	Snyder,	Guiliani,	&	Bohannon,	2007;	Hoffman	&	Blakey,	2011;	Lannin	&	Ada,	2011;	Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7929]	&	O’Brien,	2008).		However,	research	evidence	regarding	the	effects	of	an	orthosis	that	assists	forearm	movements	for	this	population	found	in	the	literature	is	limited.			The	proposed	research	project	will	use	a	randomized	clinical	trial	to	investigate	the	efficacy	of	a	forearm	rotation	orthosis	combined	with	the	OT	task-oriented	approach	for	persons	with	a	hemeparetic	arm	on	functional	performance,	motor	function,	and	range	of	motion.	We	expect	that	the	results	would	significantly	improve	participants’	functional	performance	and	motor	function	as	well	as	prevent	or	reduce	secondary	complications	due	to	CNS	dysfunction.	The	results	may	also	benefit	the	rehabilitation	professions	in	developi[INVESTIGATOR_509205].

Objectives		The	primary	purpose	of	this	study	is	to	investigate	the	efficacy	of	a	forearm	rotation	orthosis	combined	with	the	OT	task-oriented	approach	for	persons	with	a	hemiparetic	arm.	Hypotheses	of	this	study	are	that	1)	participants	who	wear	the	forearm	rotation	orthosis	will	demonstrate	significantly	greater	improvement	in	functional	performance	and	active	range	of	motion	of	forearm	rotators	compared	to	those	who	do	not;	2)	all	participants	who	receive	the	OT	task-oriented	approach	intervention	will	demonstrate	significant	improvement	in	functional	performance;	and	3)	all	participants	who	receive	the	OT	task-oriented	approach	intervention	will	demonstrate	significant	improvement	in	motor	function	of	the	upper	extremity.		Study	endpoints	
Orthosis	for	stroke	Protocol	Number:	1309M42881	
	4	The	primary	endpoint	is	the	functional	improvement.	“Functional	improvement”	represents	improvement	in	the	performance	of	everyday	activities.	The	secondary	endpoints	are	active	range	of	motion	and	muscle	strength,	including	grip	and	pi[INVESTIGATOR_820],	of	the	involved	upper	extremity	as	well	as	orthosis	compliance.		Outcome	measures	for	the	primary	endpoint	include	the	Canadian	Occupational	Performance	Measure	(COPM)	for	self-perceived	functional	performance	and	satisfaction	with	performance,	the	Wolf	Motor	Function	Test	(WMFT)	for	quantitatively	measuring	the	motor	function	of	the	upper	extremity,	and	the	Motor	Activity	Log	(MAL)	for	measuring	participants’	actual	use	of	the	involved	arm	in	the	real	world.		Outcome	measures	used	for	the	secondary	endpoints	include	goniometric	measurements	for	active	and	passive	range	of	motion	(ROM),	hand-held	dynamometry	and	manual	muscle	testing	for	muscle	strength	of	the	upper	extremity,	Jamar	Dynamometer	for	grip	strength,	pi[INVESTIGATOR_509207],	as	well	as	information	collected	by	[CONTACT_509212]+	FuelBand	regarding	numbers	of	hours	they	wear	the	orthosis	everyday	throughout	the	study	period	for	adherence	with	the	orthosis.		Treatment	allocation		Participants	who	are	eligible	and	willing	to	participate	in	this	study	will	first	be	matched	with	the	severity	of	the	motor	function	of	the	involved	upper	extremity	measured	by	[CONTACT_509213]-Meyer	Motor	Function	Assessment.	Participants	will	be	classified	as	mild,	moderate,	and	severe	groups.	Participants	in	each	group	will	then	be	randomized	in	a	1:1	allocation	ratio	to	either	the	Group	A	or	B	(Figure	1).	The	primary	investigator,	Chih-Huang	Yu,	will	randomly	assign	eligible	participants	at	the	screening	session	using	sealed	envelopes	with	an	equal	number	of	both	intervention

	6	Sample	size	estimation	We	plan	to	enroll	30	participants	in	the	study.	Based	on	anticipated	number	of	screen	failures	and/or	withdrawals,	the	maximum	number	of	participants	whom	we	will	consent	in	order	to	achieve	the	scientific	objectives	of	this	study	is	40.	Note	that	the	number	of	participants	described	above	is	a	rough	estimate	of	the	sample	size	needed,	since	there	is	no	evidence	to	address	the	primary	question	of	interest.	This	proposed	project	involves	pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]/preliminary	investigation,	which	will	be	used	to	calculate	the	effect	sizes	that	need	to	be	used	for	the	future	study.	Participant	selection		The	target	population	for	this	study	is	stroke	patients	who	have	a	hemiparetic	arm.		Subjects	will	be	recruited	from	a)	local	hospi[INVESTIGATOR_509208],	including	advertising	at	Fairview	hospi[INVESTIGATOR_509209]	b)	the	Onsite	clinic	at	the	University	of	Puget	Sound	at	which	the	PI	[INVESTIGATOR_30647]	a	graduate	from	the	occupational	therapy	program.		Inclusive	criteria	in	this	study	include:	Participants		1)	Have	a	diagnosis	of	stroke	for	at	least	three	months,		2)	Be	18	years	of	age	or	older,		3)	Have	sufficient	cognitive	function	to	follow	three-step	verbal	instruction							and	provide	independent	consent,		4)	Have	appropriate	trunk	and	lower	extremity	function	that	does	not						interfere	with	performance	of	the	upper	extremity,		5)	Have	at	least	minimum	voluntary	movement	in	the	upper	extremity	(10		
Orthosis	for	stroke	Protocol	Number:	1309M42881	
	7						degrees	of	shoulder	flex/abduction,	10	degrees	of	elbow							flexion/extension),	and		6)	Not	receive	any	rehabilitative	interventions	concurrent	with	the	study.		Exclusive	criteria	include:		1) Severe	joint	deformities	or	contractures	of	the	affected	upper	extremity	that	limit	range	of	motion	required	for	functional	tasks,		2) Capability	of	voluntarily	extending	the	wrist	and	fingers	through	the	full		range,		3)	Have	serious	uncontrolled	medical	problems,	such	as	seizures	and	visual								impairment.		Interested	persons,	who	begin	pharmacological	treatments	for	management	of	spasticity,	such	as	Botox	and	Baclofen,	before	the	study	and	sustain	these	throughout	the	study	period,	will	be	permitted	to	participate.	Interested	persons	who	use	pharmacological	treatment	for	spasticity	reduction,	such	as	Botox	or	Baclofen,	and	then	stop	treatment,	are	excluded	until	they	are	at	least	[ADDRESS_658413]	use	of	the	medications.	Persons	who	enroll	in	the	study	while	using	Botox	or	Baclofen	will	be	removed	from	the	study	if	they	stop	that	treatment	during	the	study	period.

All	participants	will	wear	the	Nike+	FuelBand	at	the	wrist	level	throughout	the	study	period	and	will	be	informed	that	the	wristband	is	used	to	monitor	their	use	of	the	arms	during	a	day.	Participants	experiencing	the	orthotic	intervention	(Group	A)	will	wear	the	forearm	rotation	orthosis	on	top	of	this	wristband.	All	participants	will	receive	weekly	phone	calls	from	the	investigator	reminding	them	to	recharge	the	wristband	because	the	wristband	needs	to	be	recharged	by	[CONTACT_509215]	a	computer	or	any	device	with	USB	port	every	4-7	days.		Conditions	involving	OT	task-oriented	approach	intervention	consists	of	18	hours	of	intervention	time	(three	one-hour	or	two	1.5-hour	session	per	week)	of	functional	and	motor	training.	Each	session	will	concentrate	on	how	to	engage	the	affected	arm	actively,	effectively,	and	efficiently	in	functional	tasks	that	are	meaningful	to	the	participant.

	13	The	forearm	rotation	orthosis	(Figure	6)	is	consisted	of	a	commercial	fabric	wrist	orthosis	and	a	Latex-free	neoprene	strap.	This	orthosis	is	designed	to	assist	forearm	rotation	without	limiting	functional	elbow	flexion	and	extension.	During	the	phase	of	orthotic	intervention	only,	participants	will	be	asked	to	wear	the	orthosis	on	top	of	the	Nike+	FuelBand		of	their	affected	arm	during	functional	tasks	within	their	context.	The	primary	investigator	will	make	three	bi-weekly	phone	calls	during	the	experiment	phase	for	enhancing	adherence	with	orthosis	and	reminding	them	to	recharge	the	wristband.	Participants	will	also	be	asked	to	wear	the	orthosis	and	the	wristband	for	the	following	experiment	phase,	including	research	visits,	and	will	be	encouraged	to	continue	wear	it	within	their	context.	However,	they	will	be	asked	not	to	wear	the	orthosis	at	evaluation	sessions	to	maintain	the	integrity	of	the	design.

	14	proposed	study,	we	hypothesize	that	possible	risks	may	include	but	not	be	limited:	1)	skin	irritation	over	contact	[CONTACT_95557],	2)	increased	muscle	soreness	when	increased	use	of	the	arm,	and/or	3)	movement	restriction	of	the	involved	upper	extremity	during	functional	tasks.	Participants	will	need	to	remove	the	orthosis	immediately	and	report	to	the	primary	investigator	if	any	of	above	symptoms	develops.	Information	regarding	possible	risks	of	use	of	the	orthosis	is	included	in	the	consent	form	as	well	as	the	written	instructions	(Appendix	A).	The	primary	investigator	will	provide	verbal	education	and	written	instructions	regarding	orthosis	use	and	care	to	the	participants	after	orthosis	fabrication.			Data	collection	plan	and	schedule.	The	timing	of	screening,	randomization,	and	follow-up	visits	are	illustrated	in	Figure	2.	The	primary	investigator	will	screen	potential	participants’	eligibility	using	the	Mini-Mental	Status	Examination	(MMSE),	the	Short	Form	Fugl-Meyer	(S-FM),	and	ROM.	There	will	be	three	time	points	for	data	collection	(pretest,	posttest	1,	and	posttest	2).	Trained	occupational	therapy	students	recruited	from	the	University	of	Minnesota	and	University	of	Puget	Sound	will	serve	as	the	blinded	evaluators	to	implement	all	assessments	except	the	COPM	for	each	research	site.		The	primary	investigator	will	administer	the	COPM	to	obtain	information	that	will	be	used	to	guide	future	interventions.		Evaluation	Data	analysis	The	R	software	will	be	used	for	data	analyses.	Descriptive	statistics	will	be	used	to	analyze	the	demographic	data,	baseline	information,	and	adherence	with	orthosis	wearing.	The	linear	mixed-effects	model	regression	will	be	used	as	the	omnibus	test	for	examination	of	effect	of	intervention	involving	orthosis	across	time	in	comparison	of	that	without.	The

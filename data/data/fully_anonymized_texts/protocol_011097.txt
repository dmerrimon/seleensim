1.1 Study  Objectives
The aim  of this study to evaluate and examine, whether use of Hybrid Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) 
as adjunct to endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), will reduce the risk of residual or recurrent neoplasia 
at [ADDRESS_888642] and remove large, often asymptomatic polyps. Early 
                        detection and resection of  these colorectal polyps can prevent the development of colon cancer. 
                              Endoscopic polypectomy introduced  in 1970’s, is an effective technique to prevent of colorectal cancer, 
                              as demonstrated  in National Polyps Study. Endoscipc mucosal resection (EMR) is a technique
                        used for resection  of medium to large colon polyps. In this technique, fluid is injected into the 
                        submucosal creating  a cushion  between the mucosa and the muscolaris propria. An electrocautery 
                             snare is  then deployed to resect the polyp in a single (en-bloc) or multiple (pi[INVESTIGATOR_411181]) pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928]. Most of 
                             polyps > 2cm  are resected in pi[INVESTIGATOR_658692].  Although EMR is now considered standard of care with 
                              successful rate  resection of 85 % and low risk of complication (3-10% bleeding and 1% perforation), this  
                             technique has  inherent deficiencies, especially pi[INVESTIGATOR_658693]. This is particularly important if the polyp 
                        contains cancer.  Resection of scarred polyps using this technique is particularly challenging due to the  
                             non-lifting of  the polyp. Recurrence rates following pi[INVESTIGATOR_658694] 20%.1,2
                             Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD)  is an alternative approach that aims to remove non- 
pedunculated precancerous or cancerous lesions  over 20 mm in one pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959] (en-bloc resection rate of 
89.95% and lesion recurrence rate of 0.7%). However, due to its technical complexity and high 
complication risk (mainly bleeding and perforation, with complication rates approximately 8%), it is not 
the current standard of care and only performed by [CONTACT_658707].1 
Hybrid Argon  plasma coagulation (APC) is a new technique in which the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_658695] a cushion (normal saline/ diluted adrenaline and /or sodium 
hyaluronate solution) to protect the muscle layer and is  then ablated using spray argon coagulation to 
treat any microscopic residual disease that is the seed for local recurrence .[ADDRESS_888643] EMR.
In this  present time there is no study to evaluate the safety and recurrence rate of the Hybrid-APC 
assisted EMR for large colon polyps at their initial resection attempt

Page 4 of  21 (V.04/27/2017)2.2 Previous Data
In 2012  Tsiamoulos et.al.  in a single-center, retrospective case series report their experience in regards 
to   endoscopic  mucosal ablation (EMA) technique that can be used to complement the eradication of 
recurrent fibrotic colon polyps. In this study, of consecutive patients referred for endoscopic excision of 
recurrent benign colon polyps with severe submucosal fibrosis, fourteen patients (mean age 73 years; 9 
men, 5 women) with 15 recurrent colon adenomas (mean polyp size 30 mm, 9 proximal/6 distal) were 
included. EMA with a mean APC power setting of 55 W was applied. Complete polyp eradication was 
achieved in 9 of 11 patients (82%) at first or second completed follow-up. One patient needed 
laparoscopic colectomy because of cancer, and 1 underwent transanal endoscopic microsurgery for 
benign massive recurrence. The other 3 patients with small, easily treatable recurrence (≤3 mm) were 
followed by 1-year-surveillance. No perforations and no postpolypectomy syndrome were reported. 
They concluded that EMA appears to be a safe and easily applicable technique to assist the complete 
eradication of recurrent fibrotic colon polyps.3
A systematic review  and meta-analysis by [CONTACT_658708].al in 2016 compares the safety and efficacy of 
endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) in the treatment of 
flat and sessile colorectal lesions >20mm. They reviewed the literature published between January 2000 
and March 2014. Pooled estimates of the proportion of patients with en bloc, R0 resection, 
complications, recurrence, and need for further treatment were compared. A total of 11 studies and 
4678 patients were included. The en bloc resection rate was 89.9% for ESD vs 34.9% for EMR patients 
(RR 1.93 p<0.001). The R0 resection rate was 79.6% for ESD vs 36.2% for EMR patients (RR 2.01 
p<0.001). The rate of perforation was 4.9% for the ESD group and 0.9% for EMR (RR 3.19, p<0.001), 
while the rate of bleeding was 1.9% for ESD and 2.9% for EMR (RR 0.68, p=0.070). Therefore, the overall 
need for further surgery, including surgery for oncologic reasons and surgery for complications, was 
7.8% for ESD and 3.0% for EMR (RR 2.40, p<0.001). They concluded that ESD achieves a higher rate of en 
bloc and R0 resection compared to EMR, at the cost of a higher risk of complications.4
Manner et.al  in 2015 performed a prospective study, which evaluating the efficacy and safety of the new 
technique of Hybrid-APC which combines submucosal injection with APC in patients with dysplastic 
Barrett’s esophagus. In this study Patients who had a residual Barret’s Esophagus (BE) segment of at 
least 1 cm after endoscopic resection of early Barrett's neoplasia underwent thermal ablation of BE by 
[CONTACT_658709]-APC. Prior to thermal ablation, submucosal injection of sodium chloride 0.9% was carried out 
using a flexible water-jet probe. Surveillence upper GI endoscopy was carried out 3 months after 
macroscopi[INVESTIGATOR_658696]-Z-line and the former BE segment, 
and recording of stricture formation. Total of 60 patients were included in the study [55 pt male (92%); 
mean age 62 ± 9 years, range 42-79]. Ten patients were excluded from the study. In the remaining 50 
pt., Hybrid-APC ablation and surveillence endoscopy at 3 months were carried out. Forty-eight out of 50 
pt. achieved macroscopi[INVESTIGATOR_658697] a median of 3.5 APC sessions]. Freedom from BE 
was histopathologically observed in 39/50 patients (78%). There was one treatment-related stricture 
(2%). Minor adverse events of Hybrid-APC were observed in 11 patients (22%). It concluded that Hybrid-
APC was effective and safe for BE ablation in a tertiary referral center. The rate of stricture formation 
was only 2%.5
2.3 Study  Rationale
EMR has a recurrence  rate of up to 20% in large ≥20 mm lesions with a relatively low risk profile. ESD 
has a low 1-4% recurrence rate but higher risk profile. We are assessing if adjuvant hybrid APC with EMR 
drop the recurrence rate near ESD levels while maintaining the safety profile of EMR.

7.0 Study  Design and Procedures
7.1 Study  Design
This is a  prospective data collection study which patients with non-pedunculated large polyps ≥ 20mm 
undergoing endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR with adjuvant Hybrid Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) 
of the base and edges of the polypectomy site to fulgurate any potential microscopic residual disease. 
Resected polyps will be sent to the pathology laboratory where pathologist determine the final 
diagnosis of the polyps as per standard of care. We will collect the detail of the procedure, including, 
STUDY00008877
Approval: 2/15/2021
Page 9 of  21 (V.04/27/2017)general procedure  details, polyp characteristic, details of any adverse event may happen and the details 
of [ADDRESS_888647] at each center. All exams 
will be performed using high-definition colonoscopes with digital chromoendoscopy capability (e.g. 
Olympus 190 series). 
Lesions will  be identified using conventional colonoscopic views. Polyp characteristics will be recorded. 
Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) will be used for all resections: the polyp will be submucosally 
injected, so that the lesion will lift and demarcate from the submucosal layer. The submucosal injection 
creates a “cushion” between the mucosa and the muscularis propria. The idea is that mucosal lesions 
can be more safely removed. The applied injectate fluid will contain a lifting agent e.g. NaCl 0.9% and a 
dye agent e.g. methylene blue. The polyp will be resected with electrocautery snare. Following the 
resection of the polyp with the snare the submucosal area will be reinjected with saline  (NaCl 0.9%) and 
then thermally ablated using APC (Erbe Hybrid APC). Finally thermal ablation of the resection site with 
the hybrid APC will occur using start settings. Once resection is considered complete the mucosal defect 
may be closed with clips for situations include but not limited to control bleeding during the polyp 
resection. Patients will be monitored continuously as is routine for any colonoscopy performed in our 
institution. Patients will be observed for in the recovery room before discharge for any sign of 
complications. (See appendix 1) We will collect the detail of the procedure, including, general procedure 
details, polyp characteristic, details of any adverse event may happen and the details of 6 months follow 
up colonoscopy procedure.

Public Health Sciences. The primary end point is the rate (proportion of patients) of local recurrent or 
residual neoplasia at 6 months for the Hybrid Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) assisted EMR. Estimate of 
this recurrent rate will provided with 95% exact binomial confidence limits, which will then be compared 
to the historical rate of 15-20% recurrent rate for EMR alone. Statistical significance will be declared if 
the upper limit is smaller than 15%.  Even when significance is not reached, the confidence interval 
provides the plausible range of the local recurrent rate of the APC assisted EMR and helps to decide if a 
future study with a larger sample size is warranted. 
Summary statistics such  as percentage of male/female patients, percentage of polyps within the 
different location of colon, mean diameter of polyps, percentage rate of neoplasia recurrence after 6 
months , the percentage of each type of Polyps (Ip, IIa, IIb, IIc,  etc), and Percentage of successful 
resection will also be provided. SPSS 22 statistical software shall be used to perform statistical analysis.

19.0 Adverse  Event Reporting
19.1 Adverse  Event Definitions
For device  studies, incorporate the following definitions into the below responses, as written:
Unanticipated 
adverse
 device 
effectAny serious  adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem 
or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or 
death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence 
in the investigational plan or IDE application (including a supplementary plan 
or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a 
device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.
19.2 Recording  of Adverse Events
All adverse  events (serious or non-serious) and abnormal test findings observed or reported to   
                             study team  believed to be associated with the study drug(s) or device(s) will be followed until  
the event (or its  sequelae) or the abnormal test finding resolves or stabilizes at a level 
                             acceptable to  the investigator.
 An abnormal  test finding will be classified as an adverse event if one or more of the following  
 criteria  are met:
• The  test finding is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]
• The  test finding necessitates additional diagnostic evaluation(s) or medical/surgical intervention;       
including significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other therapy
                             Note: Simply  repeating a test finding, in the absence of any of the other listed criteria,  
                             does not  constitute an adverse event.   
• The  test finding leads to a change in study drug dosing or discontinuation of subject  
    participation in  the clinical research study
• The  test finding is considered an adverse event by [CONTACT_093].
19.[ADDRESS_888662] findings to 
determine 1) if the abnormal test finding should be classified as an adverse event; 2) if there is a 
reasonable possibility that the adverse event was caused by [CONTACT_5257](s) or device(s); and 3) if the 
adverse event meets the criteria for a serious adverse event.
If the  investigator’s final determination of causality is “unknown and of questionable relationship to the 
study drug(s) or device(s)”, the adverse event will be classified as associated with the use of the study 
drug(s) or device(s) for reporting purposes.  If the investigator’s final determination of causality is 
“unknown but not related to the study drug(s) or device(s)”, this determination and the rationale for the 
determination will be documented in the respective subject’s case history.
19.4 Reporting  of Adverse Reactions and Unanticipated Problems to the FDA  
19.4.1 Written  IND/IDE Safety Reports
STUDY00008877
Approval: 2/15/2021
Page 16  of 21 (V.04/27/2017)The Sponsor-Investigator  will submit a completed FDA Form 3500Ato the FDA’s Center for 
Devices and Radiological Health for any observed or volunteered adverse effect that is 
determined to be an unanticipated adverse device effect.  A copy of this completed form will be 
provided to all participating sub-investigators.
                                           The completed  FDA Form 3500Awill be submitted to the FDA as soon as possible and, in no
                                           event, later  than [ADDRESS_888663].   
If the  results of the Sponsor-Investigator’s follow-up evaluation show that an adverse effect that 
was initially determined to not constitute an unanticipated adverse device effect does, in fact, 
meet the requirements for reporting; the Sponsor-Investigator will submit a completed FDA 
Form 3500Aas soon as possible, but in no event later than [ADDRESS_888664] in light of the previous, similar 
report(s). 
Subsequent to the  initial submission of a completed FDA Form 3500A, the Sponsor-Investigator 
will submit additional information concerning the reported adverse effect as requested by [CONTACT_1556].

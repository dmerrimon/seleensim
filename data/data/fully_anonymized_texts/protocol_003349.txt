I. INTRODUCTION & RATIONALE  
 
CL discomfort is a complex phenomenon that has been defined by [CONTACT_155279] (CL) discomfort as a condition that results in “epi[INVESTIGATOR_155272], either with or without visual disturbance  resulting from 
reduced compatibility between the CL and the environment, which can lead to decreased wearing time and 
discontinuation of CL wear.”
1 A recent review by [CONTACT_155280].2 This same review alarmingly found that the frequency 
of CL dropout was about 20% across the many studies aimed at evaluating this condition, which is surprising given the introduction of better soft CL materials and daily disposable CLs over the past 20 plus years.
2  
 Dailies Total1 (DT1), which is a relatively new daily disposable CL , is a commonly used trouble shooting CL for 
patients who have failed with other CLs because DT1 utilizes advanced material technology that is specifically 
aimed at improving CL comfort. While DT1 is commonly used in these struggling patients , the literature 
currently lacks a targeted study aimed at understanding the frequency of success fully  refitting CL dropouts 
into this advanced  CL. Thus , the purpose of this study is to determine the frequency that past CL wearers who 
failed because of dryness or CL discomfort who can comfortable  wear  DT1.  
 
II. SPECIFIC AIM  
 
We plan to accomplish our goal by [CONTACT_155281]: 
 Aim:  
 
Determine the frequency of past CL wearers who failed because dryness  or CL discomfort who  can 
comfortably wear  DT1. Hypothesis 1: At least 50% of past CL wearers can comfortabl y wear  DT1 at one 
month  (Positive Visual Analog Scale Score  (VAS)  based upon +50/-50 VAS scale  with 0 as neutral ).  
 
Exploratory Outcomes  
 
A Likert questionnaire will be used to determine the following patient- reported outcomes  at 1 and 6 
months : 1. Likelihood of continuing to wear DT1, 2. Overall satisfaction while wearing DT1, Overall vision 
while wearing DT1, 3. End of day comfort while wearing DT1. The SPEED questionaries will  also be used to 
determine the frequency  of DT1 wears who can comfortable wear DT1 (scores ≤ 3).3   
 
III. STUDY DESIGN  
 Participants  
 This 6-month , three -visit clinical study will be conducted at the University of Alabama at Birmingham 
(Birmingham, AL, [LOCATION_003]) , the Southern College of Optometry (Memphis, TN), and ProCare Vision Center 
(Granville, OH). One month will be the primary outcome timepoint  because Young et al. found that most 
participants who dropped out of CLs in their study dropped out by 1 month (23% dropout) .
4 Participants  will 
also be called at 6 -months like in Young et al.’s study to determine the ultimate CL success frequency. This 6-
month  survey will be an exploratory outcome that will supported by [CONTACT_473] (not Alcon).  Participants  
will be recruited via clinic records, email, and fliers.  Participant s will be pre screened with an IRB approved  
phone script prior to the study visit to help determine if they qualify for the study . The reason why all 
potential participants  dropped out of CLs will be recorded even if they are not included in the study. Adult, 18 -

scores of ≤ 3 on the SPEED questionaries (no significant dry eye symptoms) .3 Participant s will be required to be 
able to wear DT1 Sphere  (astigmatism better than 0.75 D OD/OS) . Participants  will be required to provide a 
glasses prescription that is less than [ADDRESS_179678] feeding.

Sample Size  
 This pi[INVESTIGATOR_155275] a sample of 6 0 participants  (20/site)  to estimate the initial frequency that 
participants  can comfortably  wear DT1 at [ADDRESS_179679] 50% of participants  
can comfortable wear DT1 CLs. These should also be enough participants to evaluate exploratory patient 
reported outcomes  such as the likelihood of continuing DT1 after completing the study . An additional 5  
participants  per site are being requested in case someone fails the glasses prescription requirements for this 
study. Additional  participants  will only be recruited if needed.  
 Surveys and Clinical Tests  
 Visit 1 : Baseline  
 
1. Participant  History, Eligibility, Informed Consent:  Participants  will be asked to repeat the IRB approved 
screening survey at the study visit to verify that they are still eligible for the study.  All participants  will be 
screened with  the SPEED  questionnaire to understand their initial eye comfort  (scores ≤3 required) .6 The SPEED 
is being selected because it has been validated in both CL and non -CL wearers.  All relevant patient demographics 
will be collected  via a questionnaire developed by [CONTACT_473]. Non -eligible participants  will be dismissed 
at this time or rescheduled depending upon the reason for ineligibility. Eligible participants  will be enrolled, 
consented, and requested to sign a privacy document.  
 
2. Visual Acuity  with Spectacles : Visual acuity will be measured with a Bailey -Lovie high -contrast chart.  
 
3. Manifest Refraction: The investigator will determine the participants ’ refractive error with a phoropter, and 
binocular balance will be performed if best- corrected visual acuity is equal in between eyes. No more than 1.00 
D of sphere will be added beyond the initial blur balance starting point.  
 
4. Slit -Lamp Biomicroscopy: The investigator will use a slit -lamp biomicroscope to document normal and/or 
remarkable findings of the anterior eye structures: eyelashes (blepharitis), eyelids, conjunctiva, and cornea.  
Version 7 : 12/13/2021  
 
5. CL Fitting:  Participants will be fit in DT1 s phere  CLs. The CLs will be evaluated for centration, movement, 
coverage, and CL power adjustments will only be made if they improve Snellen visual acuity.  
 
Visit 2: [ADDRESS_179680] Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness (SPEED): The SPEED questionnaire will be completed.  
 
2. Visual Acuity with CLs: Visual acuity will be measured with a Bailey -Lovie high -contrast chart.  
 
3. Slit -Lamp Biomicroscopy:  The investigator will use a slit -lamp biomicroscope to document normal and/or 
remarkable findings of the anterior eye structures: eyelashes (blepharitis), eyelids, conjunctiva, and cornea.  
 
4. CL Evaluation:  The CLs will be evaluated for centration, movement, and coverage, and lens power 
adjustments will only be made if they improve Snellen visual acuity .  
 
Visit 3: 1 Month (Primary Endpoint)  
 
1. Stannard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness (SPEED): The SPEED questionnaire will be completed.  
 
2. Visual Analog Scale (VAS): The VAS will be completed.  
 
3. Investigator Survey : An exploratory questionnaire that probes topi[INVESTIGATOR_155276], dryness, comfortable 
wear time , and willingness to continue wearing the contact [CONTACT_155284] .  
 
4. Visual Acuity with CLs: Visual acuity will be measured with a Bailey -Lovie high -contrast chart.  
 
5. Slit -Lamp Biomicroscopy:  The investigator will use a slit -lamp biomicroscope to document normal and/or 
remarkable findings of the anterior eye structures: eyelashes (blepharitis), eyelids, conjunctiva, and cornea.  
 
6. CL Evaluation:  The CLs will be evaluated for centration, movement, and coverage, and lens power 
adjustments will only be made if they improve Snellen visual acuity.  
 
7. Study Completion:  The participants  will be compensated for their time, and they will be released  from the 
clinical segment of the study.  If participants like  the CLs, they will be given a prescription for the CLs, though 
they will be required to buy their own CLs.  The participants will also be educated that they will be called in 6 
months to understand their wearing experience  if they decide to continue wearing DT1 CLs .  
 Data Analysis  
 All data will be analyzed with Stata/IC 15 (StataCorp LLC; TX, [LOCATION_003]). The frequency of participants who have comfortable VAS scores will be calculated at both the 1 -month (primary outcome) and 6 -month visits 
(exploratory outcome) . The frequency of each Likert question and the SPEED will also be calculated.  
 Training of Study Personnel  
 Prior to enrolling any participants  all examiners will participate in a training session developed by [INVESTIGATOR_154159] D. 
Pucker, OD, PhD. This full investigator meeting will ensure that all study investigators are performing the 
Version 7 : 12/13/2021  
procedures in the same manner. Data from each investigator’s first participant  will also be monitored for quality 
control by [CONTACT_1758]’s coordinator before the investigator is allowed to see additional participants .

VI. Conclusions  
 
This project will describe the frequency of  past CL wearers who can comfortable  wear  DT1. These data are 
important because they  could provide credence for fitting struggling soft CL patients into DT1 , which could help 
curb the frequency of CL dropout and help grow the CL market.

Protocol Version 5.1: November 27, 2018 Page 6 of 38  1.0 OBJECTIVES 
1.1 Primary Objective  
To assess the efficacy of NEPA to prevent nausea and vomiting both during and after a highly emetogenic 
(BEAM) conditioning regimen for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The efficacy is 
measured  by [CONTACT_593401] (CR) defined as no emesis and no rescue therapy for hours 0-264 ([ADDRESS_782923] -chemotherapy). 
 
1.2 Secondary  Objectives  
To differentiate response to NEPA over different phases of chemotherapy-induced nausea. Specifically,  CR 
is assessed for hours 0 -144 (Acute phase) and hours 145- 264 (delayed phase), and Complete Protection 
(CP) defined as CR plus no nausea is assessed for hours 0- 144, 145-264, and the whole  period. 
 
 
2.0 BACKGROUND 
2.1 Chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting  (CINV) 
Abstract 
The management of chemotherapy- induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) during preparative regimens for 
Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) continues to be a poorly studied area and an unmet patient 
need. Still unaddressed in the most recent evidence based guidelines suc h as American Society of Clinical 
Oncology (ASCO) and Multinational Association Of Supportive Care In Cancer (MASCC), patients 
undergoing high dose antineoplastics as they prepare for autologous or allogeneic stem cell rescues have a 
high risk for emesis. Preparative regimens are generally multiple days of high dose chemotherapy, which result in the risk for a combination of acute and delayed emesis. NEPA with the combination of neurokinin 
[ADDRESS_782924] to address both types of CINV in a single 
agent. Thus we propose to use it to prevent CINV in patients receiving the BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan) preparative regimen. This regimen is a 6 -day therapy course with high dose 
(and highly emetogenic) chemotherapy on day [ADDRESS_782925]. However, there remains a need for safe, effective, and 
reliable agents to eradicate CINV. Furthermore, d elayed-onset CINV is increasingly recognized as more 
difficult to treat than acute -phase CINV. 
Protocol Version 5.1: November 27, 2018 Page 7 of 38  NEPA is a recently approved combination antiemetic,  containing fixed doses of netupi[INVESTIGATOR_053] (an NK1 receptor 
antagonist) and palonosetron (a 5HT3 receptor antagonist). Having pharmacologically distinct mechanisms, 
combined NEPA offers synergistic reduction and potential elimination of CINV. NEPA has previously 
been shown to be superior to palonosetron in single and multiple cycles of both highly1 and moderately1,[ADDRESS_782926] been made in understanding the underlying cause of 
chemotherapy- induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) as well as in managing it. CINV has three distinct 
subtypes – acute, delayed and anticipatory. While there have been improvements in the prevention of all 
three areas, CINV remains problem atic especially with highly emetogenic chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (HEC) and in 
the delayed -onset setting (occurring over 24 hours after chemotherapy administration).  
Several areas of the brain and their associated neurotransmitters have been implicated in the development 
of nausea and vomiting. Specifically,  the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) at the caudal end of the fourth 
ventricle in the area postrema lacks an effective blood brain barrier, permitting  chemical stimuli from blood 
and cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) to activate the CTZ and induce the sensation of nausea and the emesis 
response. Four major neurotransmitter systems, the dopaminergic (D 2), histaminic (H 1), serotonergic (5- 
HT3), and cholinergic (muscarinic), have been implicated in inducing this response and blockade of these 
receptors have been effective in managing nausea and  emesis. 
The subnucleus gelatinosus at the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), a convergence of afferent neurons from 
the vagal and vestibulary systems and efferents from the area postrema, has also been identified as critical 
for initiating emesis. In this area, the neurokinin [ADDRESS_782927] been largely associated with the activation of tachykinin family neurokinin 1 (NK
1) receptors (broadly distributed in the central and peripheral nervous systems) by 
[CONTACT_593402] P 4,5. As shown in in vitro and in vivo studies, netupi[INVESTIGATOR_593339] P mediated responses. 
In vitro administration of both netupi[INVESTIGATOR_593340]1 receptor.[ADDRESS_782928]  of    poorly 
Protocol Version 5.1: November 27, 2018 Page 8 of 38  controlled CINV. In this study, specific costs were highly variable, but reviewed studies agreed that CINV 
led to increased medication expenditure and inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department visits; 
however, the addition of palonosetron, a 5- HT3 receptor antagonist, reduced use of rescue medications  and 
the further addition of aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], an NK [ADDRESS_782929], provided benefit in certain populations 
receiving HEC.7 
 
Current Therapy  
Current treatment recommendations for management of CINV in highly emetic chemotherapy (HEC) are for triple therapy with an NK
[ADDRESS_782930] (NK 1RA), 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (5- HT3RA), and 
dexamethasone. Four 5- HT3RAs - ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, and palonosetron are available as 
antiemetics in the [LOCATION_002]. Palonosetron has demonstrated superiority over the other 5- HT3RAs 
because it helps to control delayed CINV in addition to acute CINV, whereas the other 5- HT3RAs 
(ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron) are primarily active only in acute CINV. Further, the addition of an NK
1RA, such as aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_325455], to antiemetic chemotherapy regimens has improved 
management of acute nausea/vomiting. Currently available NK 1RAs include aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], 
netupi[INVESTIGATOR_053], and rolapi[INVESTIGATOR_053]. Most prophylaxis regimens with [ADDRESS_782931] of therapy in HEC 8,9.  
In a study combining aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053],  palonosetron, and low-dose dexamethasone  prior to conditioning regimens 
for autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant, none of 18 analyzed patients had emetic failure and complete control was achieved in 78 % in the acute phase, 33% in delayed, and 17% in extended phases.
10 
Yet, nausea continued to occur in 78%, albeit not to a significant degree in 61%.[ADDRESS_782932] of ondansetron and dexamethasone 
where emesis is prevented in only 4- 20% of patie nts.10 While demonstrating a significant improvement, 
CINV continues to be inadequately managed (78% with some nausea), especially in delayed- onset nausea 
and vomiting (77% with delayed emesis). 
Inadequate nausea control contributes to the morbidity of HSCT with persistence of common side effects 
of conditioning regimens for bone marrow or stem cell transplant. CINV can impair nutrition, exacerbate 
mucositis, and overall negatively impact upon patients’ quality of life and functional capacity.  
 
2.2 Study Agents 
NEPA (300 mg netupi[INVESTIGATOR_053]/0.5 mg palonosetron), commercially available as Akynzeo®11, is an oral fixed 
dose combination product of netupi[INVESTIGATOR_053], a substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK 1) receptor antagonist, and 
palonosetron hydrochloride, a serotonin-3 (5-hydroxytryptamine 3; 5HT 3) receptor antagonist (RA). Both 
netupi[INVESTIGATOR_593341] -nausea and antiemetic agents.  
Protocol Version 5.1: November 27, 2018 Page 9 of 38  Each NEPA (Akynzeo®; 300 mg netupi[INVESTIGATOR_053]/0.5 mg palonosetron) capsule is composed of one white - 
caramel hard gelatin capsule which contains three tablets each containing 100 mg netupi[INVESTIGATOR_593342] 0.56 mg palonosetron hydrochloride (equivalent to 0.50 mg palonosetron). The inactive 
ingredients are microcrystalline  cellulose, sucrose fatty acid esters, povidone K-30, croscarmellose  sodium, 
purified water, silicon dioxide, sodium stearyl fumarate, magnesium stearate, mono- and di-glycerides of 
capryl/capric acid, glycerin, polyglyceryl oleate, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), gelatin, sorbitol, 
titanium dioxide, yellow iron oxide, and red iron oxide. It may contain traces of medium- chain triglycerides, 
lecithin, and denatured ethanol. 
 
NEPA Pharmacology 
Netupi[INVESTIGATOR_61666] a selective antagonist of human substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK 1) receptors, and palonosetron 
is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor and little or no affinity for 
other receptors.  
The receptor occupancy for the CINV dosing regimen of netupi[INVESTIGATOR_593343] a human Positron 
Emission T omography (PET) study. Netupi[INVESTIGATOR_593344] a NK 1 
receptor occupancy of 92.5%, 86.5%, 85.0%, 78.0%, and 76.0% in striatum at 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours, respectively,  after administration  of 300 mg netupi[INVESTIGATOR_053]. Co-administration of single dose netupi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 600 mg 
and palonosetron 1.5 mg had no significant effects on the QTc  interval. 
 
NEPA Pharmacokinetics  
After single dose administration of NEPA (Akynzeo) in healthy subjects, the peak plasma concentrations 
for netupi[INVESTIGATOR_593345] 5 hours. When administered  under fed condition, the 
systemic exposure to netupi[INVESTIGATOR_593346]. In 
cancer patients who received a single dose of NEPA (Akynzeo®) 1 hour prior to chemotherapy (docetaxel, 
etoposide, or cyclophosphamide), the C max and AUC of netupi[INVESTIGATOR_593347]. The mean C max and AUC of palonosetron in cancer patients were similar to those in 
healthy subjects. No significant  changes in pharmacokinetics of netupi[INVESTIGATOR_593348] 450 mg oral netupi[INVESTIGATOR_366866] 0.75 mg oral palonosetron were  co-administered.  
 
NEPA Elimination  
Following administration of a single oral 0.75 mg dose of [14C]-palonosetron to six healthy subjects, 85% 
to 93% of the total radioactivity  was excreted in urine, and 5% to 8% was eliminated  in feces. The amount 
of unchanged palonosetron excreted in the urine represented approximately 40% of the administered dose. In cancer patients, t½ was 48 ± 19 hours. After a single-dose of approximately 0.75 mg intravenous 
Protocol Version 5.1: November 27, 2018 Page 10 of 38  palonosetron, the total body clearance of palonosetron in healthy subjects was 160 ± 35 mL/h/kg (mean ± 
SD) and renal clearance was 66.5 ± 18.2 mL/h/kg.  
Netupi[INVESTIGATOR_529647]3A4,  thus caution with co-administration  of CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors/substrates 
should be followed.[ADDRESS_782933] of NEPA on CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors/substrates was similar to 
what is seen with netupi[INVESTIGATOR_529668]  12.

white crystalline powder, and is freely soluble in toluene and acetone, soluble in isopropanol and et hanol, 
and very slightly soluble in water.  
Netupi[INVESTIGATOR_593351] a single dose of netupi[INVESTIGATOR_053], netupi[INVESTIGATOR_593352] 15 minutes and 3 hours after dosing. Plasma concentrations reached Cmax in approximately 5 hours. 
There was a greater than dose- proportional increase in the systemic exposure with the dose increase from 
10 mg to 300 mg and a dose -proportional increase in systemic exposure with a dose increase from 300 mg 
to 450 mg. 
Netupi[INVESTIGATOR_593353] a large apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F: 
1982 ± 906 L) (mean ± SD). Human plasma protein binding of netupi[INVESTIGATOR_442505] 99.5% at drug concentrations ranging from 10-1300 ng/mL and protein binding of its major metabolites  (M1, M2 and M3) 
is greater than 97% at drug concentrations ranging from 100 to 2000 ng/mL. 
Netupi[INVESTIGATOR_593354], netupi[INVESTIGATOR_593355]: desmethyl 
derivative,  M1; N-oxide derivative,  M2; and OH-methyl derivative,  M3. Metabolism  is mediated primarily 
by [CONTACT_097]3A4 and to a lesser extent by [CONTACT_097]2C9 and CYP2D6. Metabolites M1, M2 and M3 were shown to bind to the substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1)  receptor. 
Mean C
max was approximately 11%, 47% and 16% of netupi[INVESTIGATOR_593356] M1, M2 and M3, 
respectively. Mean AUC for metabolites M1, M2 and M3 was 29%, 14% and 33% of netupi[INVESTIGATOR_053], 
respectively. The median T max for metabolite M2 was 5 hours and was about 17- 32 hours for metabolites 
M1 and M3.  
 
Palonosetron 
Protocol Version 5.1: November 27, 2018 Page 11 of 38  Palonosetron hydrochloride is chemically described: (3aS) -2-[(S)-1-Azabicyclo [2.2.2]oct -3- 
yl]2,3,3a,4,5,6-hexahydro-1-oxo-1H- benz[de]isoquinoline hydrochloride. The empi[INVESTIGATOR_24598]  
C19H24N2O.HCl, with a molecular  weight of 332.87. Palonosetron hydrochloride exists as a single isomer, 
is a white to off -white crystalline powder, and is freely soluble in water, soluble in propylene glycol, and 
slightly soluble in ethanol and 2-propanol. 
Palonosetron Absorption 
Following  oral administration, palonosetron is well absorbed with its absolute bioavailability  reaching 97%. 
After single oral doses using buffered solution mean maximum palonosetron concentrations (Cmax) and 
area under the concentration- time curve (AUC0-∞) were dose proportional over the dose range of 3.0 to 80 
μg/kg in healthy subjects. 
Palonosetron Distribution 
Palonosetron has a volume of distribution of approximately 8.3 ± 2.5 L/kg. Approximately 62% of 
palonosetron is bound to plasma proteins.  
Palonosetron Metabolism  
Palonosetron is eliminated by [CONTACT_593403] 50% metabolized to form two primary 
metabolites: N -oxide-palonosetron and 6-S-hydroxy- palonosetron. These metabolites each have less than 
1% of the 5- HT3 RA activity of palonosetron. In vitro metabolism  studies have suggested that CYP2D6 and 
to a lesser extent CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism  of palonosetron. However,  clinical 
pharmacokinetic parameters are not significantly different between poor and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates.  
 
2.3 Other Agents 
Dexamethasone 12 mg 1 hour prior (+/- 30 minutes) to chemotherapy on Day 1, then 8 mg PO daily on 
days 2 through 6. Dexamethasone will not continue on day 7 (SCT Day 0), as our subjects will receive 
hydrocortisone with stem  cell infusions as per our institutional standard. Additionally, with use of other 
NK1 antagonists during stem cell conditioning, our institutional protocols do not include dexamethasone 
on the day of st em cell infusion.  Patients on strong CYP 3A4 inducers or inhibitors would need to have 
those agents replaced with clinical alternatives  prior to beginning the study. Length of washout period will 
be [ADDRESS_782934] conditioning regimens. Combined use of netupi[INVESTIGATOR_407861] (NEPA) has been effective in managing CINV in single dose administration  of both highly and moderate emetogenic  chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  To 
determine the optimal netupi[INVESTIGATOR_593357]-dose administration, a phase II study randomized  
Protocol Version 5.1: November 27, 2018 Page 12 of 38  694 chemotherapy naïve patients to one of 5 antiemetic groups prior to receiving highly emetogenic 
chemotherapy (cisplatin): one of 3 doses of netupi[INVESTIGATOR_053] (100, 200 and 300 mg) with single dose palonosetron 
(0.5 mg), oral palonosetron alone (0.5 mg; PALO), and standard 3- day aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] (APR) and ondansetron; 
all in combination with dexamethasone.[ADDRESS_782935]; furthermore, the long 
half-life of netupi[INVESTIGATOR_593358].4 The 
combination of netupi[INVESTIGATOR_593359] a synergistic inhibition of the 
Substance P response in NG108- 5 cells, which express both 5- HT3 and NK1 receptors.14 Another in vitro 
study showed additive NK1 receptor internalization in NG108- 5 cells with combined administration of 
netupi[INVESTIGATOR_407861], potentially identifying the mechanism belying this synergistic inhibition of 
Substance P  response.6 
NEPA has been evaluated in its current formulation in a number of settings, including its phase II trial for 
dosage as noted above. NEPA has been evaluated in phase III trials for both singly dosed chemotherapy 
and over repeated cycles for highly and moderately emetogenic chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].1 However, it has not yet 
been evaluated specifically in moderately and highly emetogenic conditioning regimens for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).  
In a randomized phase III study, NEPA had a significantly higher complete response (no emesis and no rescue medication) compared with Palonosetron (PALO) alone following a moderately e metogenic 
chemotherapy (anthracycline-cyclophosphamide). Complete response was seen in 76.9% of NEPA patients 
compared with 69.5% given palonosetron. Importantly, this study included primarily women (98.2% NEPA; 97.9% PALO).
2 This study excluded those receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC), 
radiation therapy, or bone marrow or stem -cell transplant. 
While previously shown to be effective in single dose chemotherapy regimens, a multinational, double - 
blind study randomized  413 patients to receive either a single dose of NEPA and dexamethasone or a three- 
day dosing of aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], palonosetron and dexamethasone in multiple (at least six) cycles of both MEC and HEC
1. Again, patients were ineligible if preparing for HSCT. NEPA showed a small but consistent 
improvement in complete response (from 2- 7%) compared with aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053]/palonosetron over 6 
chemotherapy cycles.1 
In high-dose, highly- emetogenic chemotherapy, palonosetron needs to be dosed more frequently than 
netupi[INVESTIGATOR_593360]’s approximate  [ADDRESS_782936] with netupi[INVESTIGATOR_053]’s approximate 
90 hour half-life. As Einhorn et al. showed, palonosetron along with dexamethasone is effective in alternate-

System (eCRIS). This trial is  registered with ClinicalTrials.gov and the Clinical Trials Reporting  
Protocol Version 5.1: November 27, 2018 Page 17 of 38  Program (CRTP) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). This study will use using an electronic data 
capture (EDC) system on OHSU secure servers [electronic case report form (eCRF)], and patient 
information will be entered into the eCRF in real time. Registration of OHSU  patients will include the 
minimum of the following:  
• A completed  Eligibility Checklist signed by [CONTACT_093] 
• Signed copi[INVESTIGATOR_593361] -approved, informed consent form including HIPAA 
authorization.  
 
 
 
5.0 TREATMENT  PLAN 
5.1 Agent Administration  
Treatment  will be administered  either inpatient or outpatient . Reported adverse events and potential risks 
associated with NEPA ( netupi[INVESTIGATOR_053]/palonosetron) and dexamethasone are described in Section 7. No dose 
modifications for NEPA and dexamethasone are planned in this protocol. No investigational or commercial 
antiemetic  agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_593362]'s malignancy. The study regimen is described  below: 
NEPA 300 mg/0.5 mg PO will be administered 60 minutes (+/-30 minutes) prior to chemotherapy on Day 
1, Day 3, and Day 6. 
Dexamethasone  12 mg PO will be given 60 minutes  (+/-30 minutes)  prior to chemotherapy  on Day 1 and 8 
mg PO will be given on each additional day of conditioning chemotherapy (Days 2 through 6). Due to 
netupi[INVESTIGATOR_593363],  see section 7.2.1, this dose is equivalent to the standard 
dexamethasone dose of 20 mg/day. Dexamethasone will only be given on days that chemotherapy is  
received. 
HSCT Conditioning Regimen 
BEAM HSCT chemotherapy conditioning regimen:  
• Carmustine* 300 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 
• Etoposide 200 mg/m2/day IV days 2 through 5 
• Cytarabine 400 mg.m2/day IV on days 2 through 5 
• Melphalan 140 mg/m2 IV on day 6 
 
*In patients with BMI [ADDRESS_782944] of care and the ASBMT guidelines 
for obese patients. Dosing for Carmustine is based on a 40% adjusted body weight.  
 
5.2 Distribution  
A study investigator’s order will be entered into BEACON and sent to the investigational drug pharmacy. 
The pharmacy will supply the nursing floor with unit dose capsules.  
The doses are to be administered on the nursing floor by a research nurse and documented in the patient’s 
Protocol Version 5.1: November 27, 2018 Page 18 of 38  medical recor d. If the dose is unused, the medication will be returned to the investigational pharmacy.
Protocol Version 5.1: November 27, 2018 Page 19 of 38   
5.3 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive  Care Guidelines  
• All previously ordered scheduled antiemetics will be  discontinued. 
• Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_593364]. 
• Drugs interacting with NEPA are not allowed on study. Patients previously taking drugs that interact 
with NEPA, such as those metabolized through the cytochrome P450 system, may participate after a 
minimum washout period of 7 days. 
• In individuals with personal or family history of long QT syndrome, anti -arrhythmic medications and 
or other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation or electrolyte  abnormalities  will be minimized 
as discussed in exclusion criteria. 
 
All patients will receiv e rescue antiemetics per normal procedures and number of doses of each agent will 
be charted on the medication administration record and tracked by [CONTACT_593404]. If needed for patient 
comfort or safety, rescue medications may be administered  on a regularly scheduled basis at the physician’s 
discretion. The choice of rescue medications will be left to the health care provider’s discretion but dose 
and efficacy will be tracked. The actual time of first rescue medication from the start of conditioning therapy will be noted. Because there is a potential for interaction of NEPA with other concomitantly 
administered  drugs through the cytochrome P450 system, the case report form must capture the concurrent 
use of all other drugs, over -the-counter medications, or alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The principal investigator

transplantation in the outpatient bone marrow transplant/hematology clinic. Patients will be follow ed 14 
days (+/- 72 hours of day 20 as in Section 5.4) after receiving their last dose of NEPA for potential adverse 
events. This follow up visit may occur in the clinic or in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_593366]. 
 
5.4 Duration of  Follow-up 
Subjects will be monitored on study for a maximum of 20 days (11 days of initial evaluation plus end of 
study evaluation 14 days after receiving the final dose of NEPA) . End of study corresponds with HSCT 
Day +13; however, for clarity all study documentation will refer to study days 1- 20. End of study 
assessment must be performed within ±72 hours of the true day 20 (i.e. Between days 17- 23). The End of  
Protocol Version 5.1: November 27, 2018 Page 20 of 38  study evaluation will be completed at either the end of the study or at early termination. In the eve nt that 
therapy is stopped for a life -threatening allergy, or some other unreasonable toxicity, then patients will be 
followed for one month from the date therapy is stopped or until the resolution of the toxicity. If the 
toxicity is expected to continue the patient will be followed until the stabilization of that toxicity.  
 
5.5 Criteria for Evaluation 
Nausea will be assessed daily using a self-reported QOL/nausea assessment form (CINV Questionnaire; 
Appendix C) beginning on admission and continuing through Study Day 10. Patients will complete a daily CINV questionnaire, noting number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_593367] (0 -10). Emetic epi[INVESTIGATOR_593368]’s nurse, recorded on 
the daily medical record, and verified for number each day with the patient. If patient reporting is 
discordant with nursing records and this discordance cannot be reconciled, the maximal number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_71320] a given day will be used. Either retching (visceral contraction without the expulsion of stomach 
contents) or emesis (visceral contraction with the expulsion of stomach contents) will be considered an 
emetic epi[INVESTIGATOR_593369]. The actual time of first emesis from the start of conditioning therapy 
will be noted. The percentage of total food eaten and days of parenteral nutrition during the study period 
will be monitored for each patient  through the patient self -reported questionnaire . Meals are ad libitum 
and percentage is based on each patient’s des ired meal.  Patients will record their own number and 
percentage  of meals eaten in the daily CINV questionnaire (Appendix C). 
 
  
Definitions (assessed via daily CINV Questionnaire - Appendix C)  
 No Nausea = no reported nausea and <1 on the 0- 10 numerical  scale. 
 Mild Nausea = reported nausea and 1 -3 on the 0- 10 numerical  scale. 
 Moderate Nausea = reported nausea and 4 -6 on the 0- 10 numerical  scale. 
 Severe nausea = reported nausea and 7 -10 on the 0- 10 numerical  scale. 
 
 
Response Definitions:  
 Complete Response (CR): The complete absence of emesis, mild to moderate nausea, and no rescue 
therapy in subjects who have received all 6 days of chemotherapy and 4 days of observation . 
Patients who do not complete days 1-6 will not be included in calculation  of CR. 
 Complete Protection (CP): CR plus no nausea 
 Major Response (MR): One or two epi[INVESTIGATOR_593370] 5.1: November 27, 2018 Page 21 of 38   Minor Response (mR): One to two epi[INVESTIGATOR_593371] > 1 day but less than 3 days with any 
level of nausea. 
 Partial Response (PR) : Emesis with 2 or fewer epi[INVESTIGATOR_593372] 2 emetic epi[INVESTIGATOR_80756] > 3 days of the conditioning regimen. 
 Treatment Failure (TF) : More than 2 epi[INVESTIGATOR_593373] 2 emetic epi[INVESTIGATOR_80756] > 3 days of the conditioning regimen. Note: Emesis occurring 
within [ADDRESS_782946]’s legally authorized guardian/representative decide to withdraw themselves or the  subject from the study, all efforts will be made to complete and report the End of 
Treatment evaluations as thoroughly as possible.  
A subject may be withdrawn from the study, if, in the investigator’s expert medical judgment, the subject is non-compliant with the study requirements.  Subjects may be withdrawn at the discretion  of the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) or the investigator. A subject may also be discontinued from the study for the following  reasons: 
• If a patient experiences a grade 3 toxicity  that is attributed to NEPA the patient will be discontinued 
from the study and followed until resolution of the toxicity as described in section 10.2. 
• If the patient is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_593374] > 2.0 mg/dL a 
Child-Pugh Score should be calculated. If a patient develops hepatic insufficiency (Child- Pugh score 
> 9) then NEPA will be discontinued and they will be followed through Study Day [ADDRESS_782947] is withdrawn from the study: 
• The reason(s)  for withdrawal  must be documented in the subject’s medical record and eCRF.  
• The End-of-treatment  or Early Termination  visit should be performed  within 14 days (+/ -72 hours of 
true day 20) of last dose.  
• All subjects must be followed for safety until the time of the follow -up evaluation, until study drug 
related toxicities resolution , or until stabilization  of the adverse event, whichever is longer.  
If the sponsor investigator or regulatory authority discovers conditions during the study that indicate that the study or study site should be terminated, this action may be taken after appropriate consultation with 
Protocol Version 5.1: November 27, 2018 Page 22 of 38  the investigators. The sponsor -investigator has the right to terminate the study at any time. Reasons for 
terminating the study may include the following:  
• Incidence or severity of adverse events in this or other studies indicates a potential health hazard to 
subjects.  
• Subject enrollment is  unsatisfactory.  
• Data recording is  inaccurate or  incomplete.  
• Investigator(s) do not adhere to the protocol or applicable regulatory guidelines in study conduction.  
 
 
 
6.0        DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
NEPA dose adjustments or delays are prohibited. NEPA will be dosed under usual standard of care, 
including those with BMI >[ADDRESS_782948]. NEPA does not require dose 
adjustment for diminished renal function. In the event of toxicity judged by [CONTACT_593405], patients may be withdrawn from the study as noted in Section 5.6 and alternative antiemetics instituted for patient safety. Note that other agents which may potentially require dose adjustments due to an interaction with NEPA (see section 7.2) will be reviewed and adjusted 
appropriately by [CONTACT_593406].  
 
 
7.0 ADVERSE EVENTS: LIST AND REPORTING  REQUIREMENTS  
7.1 Adverse Events 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial. Sections 5 and 6 of the 
Prescribin g Information for NEPA (Appendix  B) identify known reported and theoretical  potential adverse 
events. Occurrence of hypersensitivity reactions or serotonin syndrome as described in section [ADDRESS_782949] for multiple days.  
Dexamethasone 
Protocol Version 5.1: November 27, [ADDRESS_782950] was not studied beyond 4 days. Administer a reduced dose of 
dexamethasone with NEPA.  
Midazolam 
When administered with netupi[INVESTIGATOR_053], the systemic exposure to midazol am was significantly increased. 
Consider the potential effects of increased plasma concentrations of midazolam or other benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_593375]3A4 (alprazolam, triazolam) when administering these drugs with NEPA. 
Interaction with chemotherapeutic agents  
The systemic exposure of chemotherapy agents metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 can increase when administered 
with NEPA. Chemotherapy agents that are known to be metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 include docetaxel, paclitaxel, etoposide, irinotecan, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, imatinib, vinorelbine, vinblastine, and 
vincristine. Caution and monitoring for chemotherapeutic related adverse events are advised in patients 
receiving chemotherapy agents metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A4.  
Interaction with oral contraceptives  
Clinically significant effect of NEPA on the efficacy of oral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel and 
ethinyl estradiol is unlikely.  
 
Effects of Other Drugs on NEPA  
Netupi[INVESTIGATOR_053], a component of NEPA, is mainly metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4.  
In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are 
involved in the metabolism of palonosetron.  
CYP3A4 Inducers  
Avoid concomitant use of NEPA in patients who are chronically using a strong CYP3A4 inducer such as 
rifampin. A strong CYP3A inducer can decrease the efficacy of NEPA by [CONTACT_593407][INVESTIGATOR_529597].  
CYP3A4 Inhibitors  
Concomitant use of NEPA with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole) can significantly increase the systemic exposure to the netupi[INVESTIGATOR_593376]. However,  no dosage adjustment is necessary 
for single dose administration of  NEPA. 
Serotoninergic Drugs  
Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability,  and neuromuscular symptoms) 
has been described following the concomitant use of 5- HT
3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic 
drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake 
inhibitors (SNRIs). 
Protocol Version 5.1: November 27, 2018 Page 24 of 38  7.3 Adverse Event  Characteristics  
CTCAE term (AE severity description and grade): The descriptions and grading scales found in the 
revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  version 4.03 will be utilized for 
AE reporting. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.03 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
Expectedness: Adverse Events can be ‘Unexpected’ or ‘Expected’ (see sections 5 and 6 of the current 
Prescribing Information attached to this document as Appendix B for known warnings and AEs).  
Causality of the AE : 
• Definite: the AE is clearly related to the study treatment; 
• Probable: the AE is likely related to the study treatment; 
• Possible: the AE may be related to the study treatment;  
• Unlikely: the AE is unlikely related to the study treatment;  
• Unrelated:  the AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment.  
 
 
7.4 OHSU IRB Reporting  of Unanticipated  Problems  and Adverse Events 
Unanticipated Problems (UPs) and Adverse Events (AEs) will be reported to OHSU IRB according to the policies, procedures and guidelines posted on the OHSU IRB web site: 
http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/about/services/integrity/policies/all- irb-documents.cfm.
  
Unanticipated Problems and Serious Adverse Events as defined below  must be reported to OHSU IRB 
within 5 business days after  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_54813]. If any of these require a change (as determined by 
[CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_127833]) to the protocol or consent form, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_593377].  
This study will use the Office for  Human Research Protections (OHRP) definition of unanticipated 
problems (UPs). UPs are defined as any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria: 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research pr ocedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being studied; 
• Related or possibly related to participation i n the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]); and 
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater  risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than previously known or recognized.  
 An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if it results in any of the 
Protocol Version 5.1: November 27, 2018 Page 25 of 38  following outcomes:  
• Death; 
• A life-threatening adverse event;  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life 
functions; or  
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect.

7.6 Regulatory Reporting  
For this investigator -initiated study, the OHSU Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_593378]. The sponsor - 
investigator is required to report SAEs to the FDA through the MedWatch reporting program, even if the 
trial involves a commercially  available agent. SAEs to be reported include any unexpected (not included in 
Protocol Version 5.1: November 27, 2018 Page 26 of 38  the prescribing information). SAEs occurring during clinical studies will be reported to FDA as MedWatch 
form (specified in the investigational new drug/biologic regulations using the FDA 3500 Voluntary 
Reporting form, which is available for submission onl ine at (and also available as a pdf): 
http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/ucm085568.htm ). 
Sponsor will report to FDA any identified and validated signal originated from the study and the final study 
report. 
 
7.7 Sponsor or Additional Reporting Requirements . 
Sponsor (i.e. Principal Investigator) will send to Helsinn Corporate Drug Safety ( drug- 
[EMAIL_10108] ) all the available information regarding any SAE (i.e. considered at least possibly 
related to NEPA), within [ADDRESS_782951] death will be reported to Helsinn within 7 calendar days, in alignment 
with FDA guidelines for IND Safety Reporting. Sponsor is responsible for performing signal detection as 
required by [CONTACT_470019] (Safety Assessment for IND Safety Reporting- Guidance for the Industry) and 
will report to Helsinn Corporate Drug Safety any signals  it might identify within 3 working days from 
identifying them. The notification  will include a report explaining which is the evidence and reason that 
has led sponsor to identify a signal. 
Helsinn Corporate Drug Safety may ask additional information to Investigator or Sponsor regarding the 
received serious adverse event or safety signal to better assess it, but will not in any why try to influence 
Investigator’s or Sponsor’s causality assessment.  
Sponsor will send to Helsinn the final draft of the study report and or of any publication prior to submitting 
it to an Authority or to a  publisher.

10.0 STUDY PROCEDURES AND SCHEDULE OF  EVENTS 
10.1 Screening/Baseline  Visit 
Investigator will obtain written informed consent from the patient prior to any study- driven tests or  
procedures. However, any tests or procedures done as part of standard care and within window per 
protocol may be used. All procedures must  be performed  prior to the first day of conditioning therapy. 
Screening  will occur within thirty days of enrollment.  This time frame is needed to facilitate pre-study 
screening  of potential subjects, who may come from all areas of the state. Investigator will ensure that 
subject satisfies all inclusion and exclusion criteria prior to enrollment. 
 
10.[ADDRESS_782955] will be followed for a maximum of 20 days  (+/-72 hours). The schedule of events in section 
10.5 indicates mandatory data collected at each time point for the trial, but it is expected that additional 
tests/procedures or visits may occurs as standard of care, which is entirely at the discretion  of the 
Protocol Version 5.1: November 27, [ADDRESS_782956] subjects 
Protocol Version 5.1: November 27, [ADDRESS_782957] care.  
 
 
10.3 End of Study/Early Termination 
End of study will be at Study Day 20 (equivalent to HSCT Day +13).This assessment must be performed 
within ±72 hours. The End of study evaluation will be completed at either the end of study or at early termination. In the event that therapy is stopped for a life -threatening allergy, or some other unreasonable 
toxicity, then patients will be followed for one month or until the resolution of the toxicity. If the toxicity is expected to continue the patient will be followed until the stabilization of that toxicity.  
 
10.4 Study Assessments and  Procedures  
Demographics and Medical History: Demographic data and a complete medical history will be collected 
during the screening periodto starting study treatment. Medical history in between visits should be documented at each study visit once study treatment has started. All transfusions including date, product 
transfused, number of units, and reason for transfusion should also be collected as part of the interval 
medical history. 
Concomitant Medications: All concomitant medications and treatments  must be recorded in the electronic 
case report form (eCRF). Any prior medication received up to [ADDRESS_782958]’s medical condition during the study will also be recorded in the eCRF. Prior and/ or ongoing medications will be reviewed 
during screening to determine subject eligibility. The medication record will be maintained following 
enrollment including any changes to the dose or regimen. Prior and concomitant medication including any 
prescription, over the counter or natural/herbal/multivitamin preparations taken will be  recorded. 
Physical Exam: Physical exams must be performed by a medically qualified individual such as a licensed 
physician, Physician’s Assistant or advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner as local law permits. The 
physical exam at baseline should be performed per institutional standards  and standard care physical 
exams done prior to patient consent may be used. All other physical exams will include an evaluation of 
any AEs or any previously reported symptoms or prior physical examination findings.  
Performance Status: ECOG or Karnofsky Performance Score will be determined and performed at 
screening as  indicated in the schedule of events in section 10.5. Refer to Appendix A for ECOG scale  and 
Karnofsky Performance Score conversion.  
Weight: Must be collected prior to treatment with NEPA and as indicated in section 10.5 Schedule of  
events 
Vital Signs: Resting vital sign measurements must be performed ±[ADDRESS_782959] include: blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_149939].  
Protocol Version 5.1: November 27, 2018 Page 32 of 38  Complete Blood Count: Local hematology will be collected per institutional standards and must include  
Protocol Version 5.1: November 27, 2018 Page 33 of 38  at minimum a white cell count, differential, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count.  Note: it is 
allowable to use labs from prior day for care of these patients, as dai ly labs are often perfor med 
immediately prior to midnight .  
Chemistry:  Local chemistry  will be collected per institutional standards and must include at minimum  the 
following: sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, calcium, alanine 
transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, albumin, total bilirubin. Note: it 
is allowable to use labs from prior day for care of these patients, s daily labs are often performed 
immediately prior to midnight.  
Pregnancy Test: A urine pregnancy test is required for all female subjects during screening for women of 
childbearing potential. If the urine pregnancy test is positive, serum pregnancy tests must be performed  per 
institutional standards. 
Adverse Event assessments: Toxicities and adverse experiences will be assessed at each visit using the 
NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events 4.03 (CTCAE). Adverse event collection will begin when subject takes their first dose of study drug and continues until the subject completes  the End of Study 
visit or until one month following toxicity on trial, whichever comes later (http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm
). 
All AEs at CTCAE grade 3 or 4 and All AEs related to gastrointestinal symptoms of any CTCAE grade for AEs should be recorded in the eCRF.  
Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical 
descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline:  
• Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not  indicated; 
• Grade 2 Moderate;  minimal, local or non-invasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate 
instrumental ADL; 
• Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]; disabling; limiting self -care ADL; 
• Grade 4 Life-threatening  consequences; urgent intervention indicated; 
• Grade 5 Death related to  AE. 
Adverse events are collected and summarized  after the completion  of each patient’s study period. As noted 
previously, SAEs are assessed immediately  and reported within [ADDRESS_782960]-related, treatment -emergent,  adverse events are prominent 
in this patient group, the clinical trial medical personnel (MDs) will determine if they are sufficient to 
require study cessation in the event that study efficacy end points are being met, which would otherwise 
allow study progression to the full patient complement. If such events are present and the decision is made 
Protocol Version 5.1: November 27, 2018 Page 34 of 38  to proceed, additional information will be provided to the CRRC and IRB for their examination  and review. 
 
CINV Questionnaire: Nausea will be assessed daily using the patient self -reported CINV Questionnaire; 
Appendix C) beginning on Day 1 and continuing through Day 11 (HSCT Day

Protocol Version 5.1: November 27, [ADDRESS_782963] 
Nausea will be assessed daily using the patient self -reported CINV Questionnaire (Appendix C) 
beginning on admission and continuing through Study Day 11. Emetic epi[INVESTIGATOR_593384]’s nurse and recorded on the daily medical record . They will be verified for number 
each designated visit day with the patient. Either retching (visceral contraction without the 
expulsion of stomach contents) or emesis (visceral contraction with the expulsion of stomach contents) will be considered an emetic epi[INVESTIGATOR_593369]. The actual time of first emesis 
from the start of conditioning therapy will be noted.  
 
The percentage of each meal eaten and days o f parenteral nutrition during the study period will be 
monitored for each patient. Meals are ad libitum and percentage is based on each patient’s desired meal. Patients will record their own number and percentage of meals eaten in the CINV 
Questionnaire (Appendix C).  
 
11.1 Definitions (assessed via a daily CINV  Questionnaire)  
11.1.1 No Nausea = no nausea and < 1 on the 0- 10 numerical  scale. 
11.1.2 Mild Nausea = reported nausea and 1 -3 on the 0- 10 numerical  scale. 
11.1.3 Moderate Nausea = reported nausea and 4 -6 on the 0- 10 numerical  scale. 
11.1.4 Severe nausea = reported nausea and 7 -10 on the 0- 10 numerical  scale. 
 
11.2 Response  Definitions:  
11.2.1 Complete Response (CR) : The complete absence of emesis, mild to moderate nausea, and 
no rescue therapy in subjects who have received all [ADDRESS_782964] without emesis and minor to moderate 
nausea will reclassify the patient from CR to MR.  
11.2.2 Complete Protection (CP): CR plus no nausea 
11.2.3 Major Response (MR): One or two epi[INVESTIGATOR_593385] 
11.2.4 Minor Response (mR): One to two epi[INVESTIGATOR_593371] > 1 day but less than 3 days 
with any level of nausea. 
11.2.5 Partial Response (PR) : Emesis with 2 or fewer epi[INVESTIGATOR_593386] 2 emetic epi[INVESTIGATOR_80756] > 3 days of the conditioning 
regimen. 
11.2.6 Treatment  Failure (TF): More than 2 epi[INVESTIGATOR_593387] 5.1: November 27, 2018 Page 37 of 38  regimen or 2 emetic epi[INVESTIGATOR_80756] > 3 days of the conditioning regimen. Note: Emesis 
occurring within 2 hours of infusing DMSO containing stem cells will not be considered 
an antiemetic  failure. 
 
12.0 DATA REPORTING/REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS  
 
12.1 Data Collection and  Storage 
Study outcome data will be captured in electronic case report forms (eCRFs) using an electronic data capture (EDC) system  stored and maintained on OHSU secure servers, 
which facilitates information being stored in a unified format and location. To further preserve confidentiality, PHI in the EDC system will be limited to just birth date and visit dates. The web -accessible EDC system is password pr otected and encrypted with role -
based security, and administered by [CONTACT_127895]. All users of the database are assigned a unique ID, username, and password and must complete training appropriate to their role before they are authorized to enter, access, and store data in the database.  
 
Basic accrual tracking information (demographic, consent, visit information) will be 
captured in OHSU’s electronic clinical information research system (eCRIS), hosted on 
OHSU secure servers and managed by [CONTACT_54830]’s information technology group at their data center in downtown Portland, Oregon. Any additional printed documents containing 
participant identifiers, such as those from the medical record to confirm eligibility, w ill 
be filed in binders and kept in a locked, secure location.  
 
Quality assurance will be conducted as outlined in section 12.8 under data safety and 
monitoring. 
 
12.2 Privacy, Confidentiality, and Data Security (required)  
Original data collection sheets will b e maintained as noted above. Only research staff will 
have access to the patient database for data entry and subsequent data analysis. All computers have locking workstations including the most recent versions of the PGP 
desktop which prevents access by [CONTACT_593409]. No data will be saved to a flash drive. 
All data will be de -identified once data collection is complete and no identifiable patient 
information will be used for subsequent publications or  presentations 
 
Protocol Version 5.1: November 27, [ADDRESS_782965] be reviewed and approved in 
writing by [CONTACT_269630] (CI) Clinical Research Review Committee 
(CRRC) and the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to any subject being 
consented on this study.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_782966]’s signature [CONTACT_593412], and for all subjects under the age of 18, the investigator must ensure that the informed consent is signed by [CONTACT_423]’s legally authorized representative. If a patient 
is not primary English- speaking, a translator and witness will be present and the subject 
may sign OHSU’s respective primary language consent short form after the full consent 
has been translated.  
 
A documented telephone consent may be obtained in cases where a subject may be 
unavailable for onsite consent due to subject resources or distance from site and where 
primary investigator considers telephone consent appropriate. Subject will undergo 
identity verification by [CONTACT_593410]. Patient will not undergo any study- driven labs or 
procedures outside standard of care prior to signing physical consent form.  
 For both onsite and telephone initial consent, the consent process will be documente d. At 
the time of onsite consent,  subject will receive a copy of their signed consent form , a 
copy of the signed consent will be maintained in the subject’s medical  record, and the 
original signed consent form will be maintained in the subject study binder .

subjects’ research, conducted or supported by [CONTACT_18121], unless there are clear and compelling 
reasons not to include them. Therefore,  proposals for research involving human subjects  must 
include a description of plans for the inclusion of  children. 
This protocol does not include children for the following  reason: 1. The number of children 
with this type of cancer is limited. 2. Additionally, no dosing or adverse event data are 
currently available on the use of this study agent in this way in subjects <18 years of age, 
therefore, children are excluded from this study but will be eligible for future pediatric 
trials with this study  agent. 
13. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Study Design 
This is a Phase II clinical trial designed according to Simon’s two- stage optimum design. 
The initial stage will enroll 13 subjects. If 3 or fewer subjects obtain a complete response 
Protocol Version 5.1: November 27, 2018 Page 42 of 38  (defined as no emesis or rescue therapy during 0- 264 hours), the trial will be stopped due 
to futility. If 4 or more subjects show a complete response, an additional 30 patients will 
be enrolled for a total planned enrollment of 43 subjects. This design has 80% power and 
one-sided 5% significance level to detect a complete resp onse rate of 20% (historical 
rate) vs. 40% (desired rate).  
Protocol Version 5.1: November 27, 2018 Page 43 of 38  13.2 Primary and Secondary Endpoints  
A primary endpoint is Complete Response (CR) defined as no emesis and no rescue 
therapy for hours 0- 264, [ADDRESS_782971] chemotherapy. 
 
A secondary endpoint is CR for hours 0- 144 (Acute phase), CR for hours 145-264 
(delayed phase), and Complete Protection (CP) rate defined as CR plus no nausea for hours 0-144, 145- 264, and the whole period.  
 
13.3 Analysis Populations 
An intent to treat (IIT) analysis set consists of all patients consented and enrolled regardless 
of the receipt of the study drug or completion of CINV assessments. The IIT analysis set 
is used to report the trial accrual. A safety analysis set consists of IIT patients who receive 
at least one dose of the study drug. The safety analysis set is used for safety evaluation. An 
efficacy analysis set consists of any patient who completes  4 or more days of this trial (i.e., 
receives 2 doses of NEPA), and the efficacy analysis set is used for the assessment of 
efficacy. 
13.4 Statistical Analysis  Plan 
13.4.1 Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
We will provide an estimate of CR and 95% confidence interval. Where appropriate, data 
visualization  techniques will be used to graphically  present the CR and CP rates over time. 
13.4.2 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
The proportion of patients with CR and CP for each time period will be provided along 
with 95% confidence interval. As exploratory analyses, the number of emetic epi[INVESTIGATOR_593388] 264 hours from start of therapy and as well as the number 
occurring in 0-24 hours and 0-144 hours (acute phase) vs. those which occur between 145- 
264 hours (delayed phase) from chemotherapy administration will be reported 
descriptively. Mean levels of nausea per day and median time to worse level of nausea via 
the CINV Questionnaire will be computed and reported descriptively. Time to first emesis 
and time to first rescue will be depi[INVESTIGATOR_162600] -Meier curves showing the  percentage 
of patients who had no emesis or rescue medication use for the acute and delayed time periods. Ability to take in oral nutrition and fluids and changes over the 5 day period will be calculated via reports from the CINV Questionnaire and reporte d descriptively. 
13.4.3 Interim Analyses and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_593389] 13 patients in Stage I. If the number of patients with CR is 3 or fewer, 
the trial will be closed due to futility (i.e., CR rate is unlikely to be 40%, the desired CR 
Protocol Version 5.1: November 27, 2018 Page 44 of 38  rate). Otherwise, the trial will continue until a total of 43 patients are enrolled. NEPA is 
considered promising and worth further investigation if there are 13 or more CRs among 
43 patients (i.e., CR rate significantly better than the standard of  care). 
Safety and tolerability  will be assessed via review of adverse events (AEs), vital signs, and 
laboratory values. Incidence of Grade 3 or higher NEPA related toxicity will be estimated 
along with 95% confidence interval for each major organ system defined in NCI C TCAE 
v4.03. 
13.5 Sample Size and  Power 
The complete planned study set is of 43 total patients. As above, 13 initial patients in Stage 
I will identify utility vs futility of this study, with a plan to proceed to the full 43 patient population (additional 30 subjects) if CR is 4 or more in Stage I. With a historical CR rate 
of 20% with standard of care compared with the desired NEPA response rate of 40% with 
5% significance  level and 80% power, 43 total subjects would adequately  power this study. 
Protocol Version 5.1: November 27, 2018 Page 45 of 38  13.6 Randomization Method 
N/A; non-randomized 
 
13.7 Handling of Missing  Data 
If a patient is unavailable for prompt evaluation  we would accept an evaluation  within a 24 
hour period due to medical necessity or patient inability to complete the CINV 
Questionnaire for m. Days missed will be reported and evaluated separately at the end of 
the study. If a patient is unable to complete the form due to illness, we will attempt to 
support form completion with minimal assistance  from study personnel or caregivers  (e.g. 
verbal instructions to circle their selection). For any patient who is unable to complete the 
CINV Questionnaire on the first [ADDRESS_782972] for complete enrollment, as those days a re 
considered vital for efficacy assessment.  For patients who are unable to complete the form 
on days 7- 10, study results will be noted separately in the final manuscript but will not be 
censored from the trial. Patients who complete 7 but fewer than 10 days of the CINV Questionnaire for any reason will be assessed in a secondary analysis. However if these occur in stage I the PI [INVESTIGATOR_593390]- completion and determine whether 
they are considered non- responders (e.g. too nauseated to fill out the form) vs. unable to 
complete the form for medical, scheduling, or other reasons outside of study controls. The 
latter patients would be replaced to support the stage I analysis, as it is crucial to ongoing 
study procedures but would not be replaced in stage  II.

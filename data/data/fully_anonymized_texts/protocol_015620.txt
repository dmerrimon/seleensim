1. PURPOSE OF PROTOCOL:  
 
Obesity and related comorbidities, such as type [ADDRESS_937310] embraced the results of recent controlled clinical trials demonstrating potent effects of bariatric surgical procedures to not only induce sustained weight loss but also to improve or 
normalize obesity -related comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes. Remarkably, surgery is superior to 
medical therapy for weight loss and diabetes, improves lifespan, and results in sustained improvement in 
glycemic control and reduced need for medications [1]. Such data have led to an explosion in the number of bariatric surgeries performed in the US – now over 200,000 annually [2]. While benefits of bariatric 
surgery are achieved with low operative mortality [3], longer -term intestinal and nutritional complications 
can occur.  
 One particularly challenging and sometimes severe complication of bariatric and other forms of gastric surgery (e.g. roux -en-Y gastric by[CONTACT_6476], sleeve gastrectomy, gastrectomy for ulcer, fundoplication for 
reflux esophagitis) is hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia [4]. While most commonly reported with roux -en-Y 
gastric by[CONTACT_6476], hypoglycemia has also been observed with sleeve gastrectomy, a procedure increasingly  
employed in the US [5]. P revalence estimates vary according to method of ascertainment, ranging from 
symptoms in 30% of patients to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_690842] <1%.  However, s tudies utilizing continuous 
glucose monitoring suggest substantial hypoglycemia occurs even in completely asymptomatic patients post- RYGB, ranging from 29 to 71 min/day of sensor glucose values <60 mg/dL. In one study, 75% of 40 

Form Revised March 2003 CHS #:2017-27  
Date: 7/15/2020 
unselected patients following RYGB had sensor glucose values <55 mg/dL, compared with none in 
nonsurgical controls. Hypoglycemia during glucose or meal tolerance testing is also common (10– 29%) 
after gastric by[CONTACT_690863]. 
H
ypoglycemia in this setting is defined as a documented plasma glucose level below 70 mg/dl in 
conjunction with symptoms and the relief of symptoms with the normalization of glucose levels. 
Hypoglycemia typi[INVESTIGATOR_40645] 1- 3 hours after meals, particularly meals rich in simple 
carbohydrates, and is not present after prolonged fasting [6]. A typi[INVESTIGATOR_690843], as revealed by [CONTACT_41131] (CGM), can be seen in Figure 1. In this patient, there was no 
fasting hypoglycemia, as expected. By [CONTACT_22242], food intake and rapid emptying of the gastric pouch triggers a brisk and excessive rise in glucose (1st purple arrow), with subsequent rapid decline in glucose precipi[INVESTIGATOR_690844] (red arrow). This pattern recurred after 
another meal (second purple, then red arrow), with treatment with glucose tablets resulting in temporary mild increase in glucose, then recurrent hypoglycemia (3rd arrow). 
Hypoglyce mic symptoms may be  autonomic 
(e.g., palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], lightheadedness, sweating) 
or neuroglycopenic (e.g., confusion, decreased attentiveness, seizure, loss of consciousness) in nature.  
E
arly in the post- operative period, hypoglycemia is usually mild, often  associated with dumpi[INVESTIGATOR_690845], and effectively treated with low glycemic index diets. Such mild, often unrecognized, hypoglycemia is increasingly recognized as a potential contributor to increased appetite and weight regain after surgery [7]. A subset of post- bariatric patients develops very severe hypoglycemia with 
neuroglycopenia, with loss of consciousness, seizures and motor vehicle accidents, typi[INVESTIGATOR_11730] 1-[ADDRESS_937311]- gastric surgery hypoglycemia reveal profound alterations in 
glycemic and hormonal patterns in the postprandial state occurring with altered gastric anatomy  [8]. 
Plasma insulin concentrations are inappropriately high at the time of hypoglycemia, indicating 
dysregulation of insulin secretion as an important mechanism [9]. While initial reports demonstrated pancreatic islet hypertrophy, pancreatic resection does not cure hypoglycemia [4] [10, 11], and excessive islet number has not been observed in all series [4] [10, 12- 14]. One candidate mediator of increased 
insulin secretion is GLP -1, an incretin peptide released from intestinal L -cells in response to meals, in turn  
stimulating insulin secretion in a glucose- dependent manner. Indeed, pos tprandial levels of GLP-1 are 
increased by >[ADDRESS_937312]- by[CONTACT_223781], are even higher in those with hypoglycemia, and correlate 
inversely with postprandial glucose levels [9, 15]. Furthermore, short- term pharmacologic blockade of the 
GLP-[ADDRESS_937313] -by[CONTACT_690864] [16], but increases GLP -
1 levels in some studies [17, 18]. Interestingly, plasma levels of counterregulatory hormones such as 
cortisol and glucagon do not differ in the postprandial state in patients with symptomatic  vs. asymptomatic 
hypoglycemia [9], but counterregulatory hormones are reduced during sustained hypoglycemia 
(hypoglycemic clamp) [19]. Additional gastrointestinal factors which could modify systemic metabolism 
include dietary composition, gut microbiota [20], bile acid composition [21], and intestinal adaptive responses [22]; these may influence absorption of glucose and other nutrients, intestinally -derived 
hormonal responses, and the magnitude of CNS -gut-liver regulatory loops. Finally, genetic variation could 
also contribute to alter ed hormonal responses and sensitivity [23].  Figure 1.  CGM  tracing in patient with PBH.

A
 cornerstone of therapy is dietary modification, aimed at reducing intake of high glycemic index 
carbohydrates [24]. Both diet and pre -meal acarbose [25] aim to minimize rapid postprandial surges in 
glucose wh ich are triggers for glucose- dependent insulin secretion. Additional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_690846] 
(to reduce incretin and insulin secretion) [26], diazoxide (to reduce insulin secretion) [27], calcium channel 
blockade (to reduce insulin secretion) [28], gastric restriction or banding (to slow gastric emptying) [29], and providing nutrition solely through a gastrostomy tube placed into the by[CONTACT_690865] [30]. 
Surprisingly, reversal of gastric by[CONTACT_690866] [4] [10, 11], suggesting the importance 
of underlying genetics and/or compensatory mechanisms which persist after surgical reversal. Finally, while pancreatic resection was initially employed for patients with life- threatening hypoglycemia [4], this 
procedure is not uniformly successful in remitting hypoglycemia and thus is not routinely considered at the present time.  
D
espi[INVESTIGATOR_690847], 
usually in combination, some patients continue to have frequent hypoglycemia. While hypoglycemia most commonly occurs in the postprandial state, it can also be observed in response to increased activity and emotional stress. Importantly, patient safety is additionally compromised when hypoglycemia unawareness develops with recurrent hypoglycemia. Patients are often disabled by [CONTACT_690867], leading to inability to drive or maintain employment, and causing fear of 
eating and exercise due to potential provocation of hypoglycemic events, cardiac arrhythmias [31], syncope, falls, and seizures. Thus, there is an urgent need for improved approaches to the prevention and treatment of severe hypoglycemia to maintain health, allow optimal nutrition, and improve safety in individuals with P BH.  
In ou
r extensive clinical experience caring for patients with hypoglycemia after gastric surgery, we have 
observed that personal (un masked ) continuous glucose monitoring can improve patient safety and 
reduce hypoglycemia. CGM alarms, both glucose threshold and rate of change alarms, can alert the patient to treat to raise glucose - before severe hypoglycemia occurs. This is particularly helpful for those 
patients with hypoglycemic unawareness, who develop neuroglycopenia without any warning symptoms 
[4]. In this context, and recognizing the lag between capi[INVESTIGATOR_690848], we advise 
patients to respond to the rate of change alarm, so that treatment can occur before neuroglycopenia 
develops.  
Thi
s approach is also similar to our strategy in ongoing studies of patients  with post- bariatric 
hypoglycemia, in which we are testing the ability of CGM used in conjunction with algorithm -based 
prediction of hypoglycemia to guide delivery of glucagon. While this approach is still under study, use of CGM to predict hypoglycemia in this context has again reinforced the potential utility of CGM alone to provide patients with real -time sensor glucose values and predictive alarms, allowing patients to detect 
imminent hypoglycemia and self- treat to prevent severe hypoglycemia and dangerous neuroglycopenia.  
Moreover, real -time glucose information will also provide patients with information about glucose 
responses to specific food types and quantity, potentially allowing them to better individualize dietary 
choices in order to prevent postprandial glycemic spi[INVESTIGATOR_690849].  
In pa
rallel with glucose measures, we will assess activity (using a FitBit Charge 2) to define the 
relationship between activity measures and hypoglycemia risk and begin to provide guidance for patients about predicted glycemic responses to activity.  
O
ur studies will also provide crucial data to guide next -step studies aimed at testing whether chronic 
CGM use could also reverse hypoglycemia unawareness, further improving safety and quality of life for this patient population.  

Form Revised March 2003 CHS #:2017-27  
Date: 7/15/2020 
The clinical relevance of severe hypoglycemia with neuroglycopenia is undeniable, as patient safety, 
cognition, and quality of life can be compromised. Given the continued increase in bariatric surgery and 
continued need for other forms of gastric surgery, the population of patients with hypoglycemia is 
expected to increase further, making the proposed studies essential for consideration of this approach to achieving safety.  
2.STUDY DESIGN:
The p
roposed study is designed to assess the efficacy of un masked personal CGM to reduce the 
frequency of hypoglycemia after gastric surgery. Specifically, we will analyze glycemic patterns during  unmask ed CGM wear, in comparison to the baseline of masked  CGM wear.  Initially study participants 
wore Dexcom G4 Professional (Pro) CGM devices , but as of July 2020 this has changed to the Dexcom 
G6 Pro.  The Dexcom G6 Pro is worn for 10 days masked and 10 days unmasked, as this is the life span 
of the G6 sensor / transmitter pairs which are single use. Please note that we have chosen to have a 
consistent masked monitoring first, as providing unmasked  data to participants first could alter their 
dietary or other patterns and reduce ability of the study to independently assess efficacy of the CGM intervention.

4.DATA ANALYSIS / SUBJECT SELECTION
Statistical and Analytical Plan 
All participants who have consented to the study and completed at least one monitoring period of CGM 
use will be included in the data analysis set. Adverse events, vital signs, physical examination, and 
laboratory safety variables (Screening to Final Visit) will be reviewed and summarized on an ongoing basis during the study to evaluate safety. Safety data will be presented in tabular and/or graphical format and summarized descriptively, where appropriate. Data will be stored using a secure, web-based application designed to support data capture for 
research studies (RedCap), providing: 1) an intuitive interface for validated data entry; 2) audit trails for 
tracking data manipulation and export procedures; 3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages; and 4) procedures for importing data from external 
sources. Data are stored and are backed up on a scheduled basis with data encryption for any regulated data types (private health data (PHI) which require backup media in an encrypted format. Data will be maintained in protected files at Joslin Diabetes Center. Only deidentified data will be 
transferred (via secure electronic file transfer) between collaborators. 
C
GM data, alarms, reported symptoms, need for assistance, hypoglycemia awareness scale, and 
timing of symptoms relative to sensor glucose levels will be recorded. We will also define CGM values, 
both during the day and night, using thresholds <55 (severe hypoglycemia)[32], 55-70 (moderate 
hypoglycemia), 70-180 (euglycemia), and >180 mg/dl (hyperglycemia). 
C
GM data will be analyzed in several ways: (1) minutes per day <70 mg/dl (primary analysis), (2) 
minutes per day <55 mg/dl, (3) number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_690853], (4) epi[INVESTIGATOR_690854] (<55 mg/dl, (5) epi[INVESTIGATOR_690855] (55-70 mg/dl), and epi[INVESTIGATOR_690856] (>180 mg/dl). In secondary analysis, data from days and nights (11 PM – 6 AM) will be 
analyzed separately. Activity measures, including total step number as well as  duration of activity as 
defined by [CONTACT_690870], will be analyzed to determine relationship to changes in sensor 

Form Revised March 2003 CHS #:2017-27  
Date: 7/15/2020 
glucose levels (Fitabase). For all data, paired analysis will be used to compare responses per 
participant for masked vs. unmasked  periods . 
Analyses will utilize either parametric (paired t tests) or non-parametric statistical tests (Wilcoxon signed-rank test), depending on data distribution for continuous variables, and chi square for categorical variables. 
Sample Size and Justification 
Approximately 40 subjects may be screened for this study, assuming approximately 30% will not meet inclusion criteria. To allow for potential drop-outs (assuming 20%), [ADDRESS_937317]-by[CONTACT_444657] (n=10, unselected for 
severity) demonstrate mean ± standard error of 63 ± 23 minutes/day for sensor glucose <70 [4]. This 
was a small cohort, (n=10), was unselected for severity, and utilized an early Medtronic diagnostic 
CGM system. The cohort proposed in this study is expected to have longer duration of hypoglycemia daily. However, we have used these data to estimate power for the current study. We estimate power of 98% to detect a 50% reduction (32 minutes) in time <70 with alpha 0.05 (2-sided) for paired comparison of masked and unmasked monitoring periods with a sample size of 20. As noted above, we 
expect power will be higher due to increased severity in this sample cohort; even with the conservative calculations, we should have adequate power (0.8) to detect differences between masked and unmasked periods as low as [ADDRESS_937318] completed the paired analysis of response to mask ed 
vs. unmask ed CGM analysis. At that time, power will be reassessed, and sample size will be adjusted if 
needed. 
Local Interim Data Analysis/Data Monitoring Plan 
Data will be stored using  a secure,  web-based application designed to support data capture for 
research studies  (such  as RedCap), providing: 1) an intuitive interface for validated data entry; 2)  
audit trails  for tracking  data manipulati on and export procedures; 3) automated export 
procedures  for seamless  data downloads  to common statistical  packages; and 4) procedures for  
importing data from external  sources.  Data are stored and are backed  up on a scheduled basis  with 
data encryption for any  regulated data ty pes (private health  data (PHI) which  require backup media in 
an encrypted format.  
Data will be maintained in protec ted files at Joslin  Diabetes  Center.  Only deidentified data will be 
transferred (via secure electronic file transfer) between collaborators.  
Data Safety Monitoring Plan:  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_690857]- approved protocol  and will review  all 
adverse events  and serious  adverse events. The Joslin study coordinator  will  also  perform  a  
periodic  review  of  all  data  from  phenotypic analyses. The members of the study team  will conduct 
regularly scheduled meeting approximately weekly as well as on an as -needed basis to review status of 
the trial inclusive of enrollment, oversight of informed consent, general conduct of the trial as well as 
reporting of any complications as needed to the NIH and IRB. 
5.POSSIBLE BENEFITS:
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of continuous glucose monitoring at reducing 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_690858].  This project is not designed to be of direct benefit to any individual subject, although it is hoped that through the knowledge gained from these studies there will be general benefit to persons with or at risk of 
development of hypoglycemia following gastric surgery.  Subjects enrolled in this study receive

Date: 7/15/[ADDRESS_937319].  
6.POSSIBLE RISKS:
Risk of Device Reuse:  This risk has been eliminated from this protocol as Dexcom sensors, 
transmitters and receivers will be used only by a single participant and thus  do not require sterilization. 
Glucometers  will not be cleaned or reused by [CONTACT_1766]. A new meter  will be given to each new 
participant.  
S
ensor inaccuracy:  
Participants wearing the Dexcom G6 Pro CGM may take up to 1000 mg of acetaminophen every 6 hours 
(4 grams per 24 hours), without affecting sensor accuracy. 
Sensor  placement may cause bleeding, infection, clot formation (all minimal risk), bruising, or 
discomfort.  
Phlebotomy  may cause blood loss and discomfort. The total volume of blood sampling is 
approximately  [ADDRESS_937320] 
elapsed.    
Screening Tests and Procedures: It is possible  that as a result of the screening process  a 
subject  may learn that they have a health disorder  that they were  unaware they had. Every effort 
will be made to help the participant obtain the care that they need. 
Breach of Confidentialit y: While  every  effort  will be made to protect the confidentiality  of 
participant identifiable information, there is the potential  loss of co nfidentiality  by [CONTACT_232642]. 
Inconvenience  and  Unkno wn  Risks:  Participants  may  be  inconvenienced  by  [CONTACT_690871]. There may be other risks from this study  not yet 
identified.  
Participants  can choose not to participate in the clinical research project and can withdraw 
consent at any time.  
7.CONSENT PROCEDURES:
S
ubjects will be recruited  from the Joslin Hypoglycemia Clinic. The study will be explained to the 
potential subject initially in the clinical setting or during a subsequent telephone screening session. The 
informed consent process will be inclusive of various types of education and counseling opportunities including an in-person or telephone screening, allowing for general overview of the procedures as well as options available for all subjects expressing interest in participation. 
Thos
e still interested after in person or telephone screening will be scheduled for screening visit(s) at 
the clinical research unit. The consent process will involve initial discussion of the purpose and scope of the research as well as risks and benefits. Ample opportunity will be provided for participants to read consent, share with family or other health care providers as well as have all questions answered by [CONTACT_1268] [INVESTIGATOR_690859]. The consent form will include a description of risks and benefits, alternative 

Form Revised March 2003 CHS #:2017-27  
Date: 7/15/[ADDRESS_937321] that the patient can withdraw from the study at any time with no change in his/her standard 
treatment. There can be no changes in the protocol without the prior agreement of the IRB. 
If the pati
ent consents to enroll in the study, and the consent form is signed, further evaluation in the 
form of the medical and screening visit will take place to determine eligibility. One copy of the consent 
form will be retained by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_162676].

 Page 3 of 63 Revis ed Template : November 10, [ADDRESS_383054] cancer survivors are at an increased risk of chronic conditions and compromised 
quality of life (QOL).1,2 Increased physical activity (PA) is associated with reductions in

mortality and improved QOL and survival.3-[ADDRESS_383055] -treatment ,7,8 and up to 70% do not meet 
public health recommendations for PA.9-12 Although many factors7,13-18 contribute to 
survivors’ low PA, a lack  of accessible, effective PA programs is a major barrier. Most 
existing PA interventions are resource -intensive, on -site programs tested in controlled 
efficacy trials with little chance of being translated into real -world practice.[ADDRESS_383056] -effective PA interventions that 
can be remotely delivered with greater dissemination and implementation (D&I) 
potential.18-[ADDRESS_383057] cancer survivors.15 However, PA inte rventions targeting 
these constructs typi[INVESTIGATOR_311157] (i.e. daily logs, support calls, feedback) delivered simultaneously 
making  it impossible to disentangle which intervention componen ts, at what levels, and 
in what combination(s) do, or do not, impact target constructs and maximize PA. Granular 
information about the effects of discrete components is needed to optimize intervention 
configuration so PA and scalability are maximized and b urden and cost minimized.20,24 
Using traditional study designs (i.e. randomized clinical trials) to test each component one 
at a time is inefficient in terms of time and expense. More efficient research methods must 
be used to simultaneously compare the effects of multiple i ndividual intervention 
components.   
 
The purpose of the present study is to apply the Multiphase Optimization Strategy 
(MOST)[ADDRESS_383058] a set of mobile health (mHealth) PA intervention 
components for breast cancer survivors that are targeted at social cognitive constructs 
known to impact PA uptake and designed with D&I in mind from the outset. MOST is an 
innovative multi -phase framework adapted from engineering that uses highly efficient 
factorial experiments to evaluate the individual and combined effect of intervention 
components. The present study will use a MOST approach to examine the effect of PA 
intervention components that vary on cost. These data will be used to assemble an 
intervention to be evaluated in a larger R01  that is optimized to yield the maximum 
increase in PA for the minimum cost. The proposed study represents the first systematic 
effort to use MOST to design a highly disseminable PA intervention for breast cancer 
survivors. The  resulting intervention will  have great potential for scalability because it 
engages relevant stakeholders (i.e. survivors, experts, community leaders) in the design, 
uses technology (smartphones) participants already own, requires no on -site visits, and 
recruits using the Army of Wo men,© a national breast cancer research registry the PI

Specific Aims : 
Aim #1. Use a patient -centered approach to select a set of five PA intervention 
components for breast cancer survivors designed to impact social cognitive 
constructs.  Although we have identified candidate app/intervention components, 
selection of which ones to test will be made based on consensus between investigators 
and relevant stakeholders including survivors, experts and community leaders (n=1 0 of 
each). Survivors (n=10 -20) will also be involved in iterative testing to determine app 
usability and functionality.  
 
Aim #2. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_311159] a [ADDRESS_383059] experiment.  A highly effic ient experimental design 
will be used for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_311160] (n= 256). Feasibility will be assessed by a) 
intervention reach, b) participant retention, and c) adherence to the intervention protocol. 
Acceptability will be assessed by [CONTACT_311198] e acceptability and usefulness of 
intervention components.   
 
Aim#3. Examine effects of the intervention components on PA.  The effect of the 
intervention components on changes in accelerometer measured PA (minutes/week) at 
[ADDRESS_383060] effects of individual components.   
 
Exploratory Aim. Examine potential effects of the intervention components on 
important patient -reported outcomes  (PROs) . We will examine the effect of each 
intervention component on changes in physical function, fatigue, depression and QOL at 
[ADDRESS_383061] cancer  (BC) prog ression and cardiovascular disease (CVD)  
risk in a [ADDRESS_383062] blood samples for future research to examine 
evaluate the extent to which e ach intervention component ameliorates a pro -inflammatory  
phenotype associated with BC progression and CVD risk (i.e. interleukin -6, tumor 
necrosis factor -alpha interleukin -10, c -reactive protein) and cardiometabolic biomarkers 
(i.e. glucose, triglycerides , total cholesterol and high -density lipoproteins) .  
 
1.2 Hypotheses to be tested . 
Aim #1. We hypothesize that a set of 5 components will emerge as favored by [CONTACT_311199].   
 
Aim #2. The primary hypotheses are: a) 75% of eligible survivors will agree to participate 
in the intervention; (b) enrollees will demonstrate engagement by [CONTACT_311200] >80% 
of the study days and using one or more additional app components at least weekly. 
Descriptive analyses (means, frequencies) will be used to describe these results

deleterious psychosocial (e.g. fatigue, depression, low self -esteem) and physica l side 
effects (e.g. nausea, vomiting, lymphedema, functional limitations)  that may be chronic 
or have a late onset and result in compromised quality of life (QOL).[ADDRESS_383065] cancer 
survivors are also  at an increased risk of early mortality and the development of both 
comorbid conditions28 and second primary cancers.29 Increased physical activity (PA) has 
been shown to be effective  for reducing these negative treatment -related side effects and 
improving QOL.5,[ADDRESS_383066] cancer survivors engage in moderate 
to vigor ous intensity aerobic PA for 150 minutes per week, with the benefits believed to 
be dose -dependent.31,32  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_311161], up to 70% of breast cancer survivors do not meet PA 
recommendations.9-[ADDRESS_383067] cancer 
survivors are on -site, intensive, professionally delivered multicomponent programs. The 
few home -based PA interventions involve a large number of face -to-face or phone 
counseling sessions and do not incorporate web or mobile technology.  Historically, 
design o f these time and resource intensive interventions has  largely neglected to 
engage stakeholders (i.e. clinicians, survivors) and ignored contextual barriers (i.e. cost, 
burden, and accessibility) that influence real -world intervention uptake and 
sustainabi lity.19 Thus, existing PA interventions are often not feasible for widespread 
dissemination and implementation (D&I).[ADDRESS_383068] cancer survivors 
continues to increase, it is of critical public health impo rtance to develop more 
disseminable, effective PA interventions to improve health and disease outcomes and 
reduce healthcare costs. The proposed study addresses this critical need by [CONTACT_311201] D&I in mind from the outset by [CONTACT_311202], 
using mobile technology for intervention delivery to increase reach and accessibility, and 
identifying “active” intervention components.  
Social Cognitive Theory (SCT)23 is well recognized as a useful framework for the design 
of PA interventions. However, t he full model has been applied less -frequently in research 
with cancer survivors.33 SCT34-36 specifies a core set of determinants (self -efficacy, goal -
setting, facilitators/barriers outcome expectations) and the mechanisms through which 
they work.[ADDRESS_383069] more positive outcome 
expectations, set higher goals, and are more likely to believe they are capable of 
overcoming barriers (see Figure 1). These relationships are all postulated to be reciprocal 
(i.e. higher self -efficacy is associated with higher outcome expectations and vice versa).

efficacy, realistic outcome expectations, facilitators/barriers (i.e. social support), and goal -
setting are associated with increased PA in breast cancer survivors.15,[ADDRESS_383071] involve simultaneous delivery of multiple intervention 
components (e.g. goal -setting activities, PA logs, social support) intended to target these 
constructs. While  this approach results in determination of overall intervention 
effectiveness, it provides little insight into which intervention components/SCT constructs 
were, or were not, effective. Identifying which intervention components maximize PA 
while minimizing  cost can help to determine which components should be included, 
eliminated or reduced to meet specific organization or individual needs.  
 
 
Physical activity (PA), breast cancer (BC) prognosis, and cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) risk. Overall  relative survival rates are high for breast cancer.  However, BC 
survivors (BCS) are still at risk for recurrence  and they demonstrate higher CVD incidence 
and mortality40 than healthy controls. CVD is also the leading cause of non -cancer death 
among BCS.[ADDRESS_383072] biologic mechanisms underlying the benefits of PA on BC progression and CVD 
risk in BCS are not well -established.

progression  via its effects on a number biobehavioral pathways , including 
inflammation.49,50 A pro-inflammatory  phenotype is associated with increased BC 
progression and mortality and CVD risk and mortality51-54 while  higher PA is associated 
with amelioration of a pro-inflammatory phenotype .55 Higher PA may be associated with 
further CVD risk and mortality reductions in BCS via its effects on cardiometabolic 
biomarkers.56 Figure 2 displays these pathways. The proposed study will contribute to the 
evidence needed t o advance a public health -level recommendation that BCS should 
engage in PA . Inflammatory biomarkers. Interleukin -6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor -
alpha (TNFα)  are pro -inflammatory cytokines secreted by [CONTACT_20405], infiltrating 
macrophages, and adipocyt es. Preclinical studies suggest TNFα is associated with 
increased angiogenesis and invasion57,58 and IL -6 promotes proliferation, inhibiting 
apoptosis and promoting conversion of noncancer cells into tumor stem cells.59 
Interleukin -10 (IL-10) is an anti -inflammatory immunosuppressive cytokine with both  pro- 
(reduces antigen presentation, cell maturation and differentiation which may allow tumor 
cells to evade immune surveillance mechanisms)60 and anti - (inhibits gene expression, 
cytokine synthesis by T cells and macrophages, and their antigen presentation)61 tumoral 
effects.62 C-reactive  protein (CRP) , an acute phase protein,  is a non -specific marker of 
chronic inflammation primarily regulated by [CONTACT_8668] -6. CRP may con tribute to a  pro -neoplastic 
environment by [CONTACT_246090], promoting angiogenesis, and favoring neoplastic 
spread and metastis.54 The pro -inflammatory phenotype propagated by [CONTACT_311203]: a) more prevalent in BCS than noncancer controls,63 b) associated with increased BC 
incidence, recurrence, progression and mortality51,52,64 -66 and c) associated with 
increased CVD risk53 and mortality67 via its contribution to the atherosclerotic disease 
process.[ADDRESS_383073] underlying mechanisms are unknown,  hypothesized 
effects include:  PA-associated reduction s in visceral fat mass; increased production and 
release of anti -inflammatory cytokines from contracting skeletal muscle and reduced 
expression of Tolllike receptors (TLRs) on monocytes.55 Cardiometabolic biomarker s. 
Higher levels of blood glucose (BG), triglycerides (TG), and total cholesterol (TC) and 
lower HDL -cholesterol (HDL -C) are associated with  increased risk of cardiovascular 
events .70-77 Regular PA improves liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue sensitivity to 
insulin resulting in decreased fasting insulin levels and the insulin respon se to glucose, 
resulting in increased glucose disposal rates.78 PA may improve lipid profiles via a number 
of mechanisms including enhancing skeletal muscles’ ability to utilize lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], increased 
lipoprotein lipase activity and increased lecithin -cholesterol acyltrans.[ADDRESS_383074] of intervention and PA dose on bioma rker outcomes.  Understanding the dose

[CONTACT_12134].80 The typi[INVESTIGATOR_311162] a randomized control trial (RCT) only allows us to draw conclusions 
about an entire treatment package when each intervention component may differentially 
influence intervention adherence, PA dose engaged in and h ealth outcomes. By [CONTACT_311205] (i.e. coaching calls, text messaging ,

moderators of these relationships  in the proposed study, we will gain important insight 
into the “dose” of: a) PA (i.e. intervention adherence and PA volume) needed to improve 
biomarkers of interest and b) intervention [i.e. which compone nts, at what levels, in what 
combinat ion(s)] needed to achieve these outcomes. We will also gain preliminary insight 
into whether the needed PA and intervention dose varies by [CONTACT_311206]. 
This will allow for more specific and personalized i ntervention prescriptions for specific 
outcomes for BCS.  
 
Dried blood spots . Remotely -delivered , technology -supported interventions have 
greater potentially scalability than intensive, on -site interventions and allow for larger 
sample sizes and greater geographic diversity. In contrast, the cost and logistics 
associated with collecting biomarker sam ples, often restricts the assessment of these 
outcomes in larger -scale technology -supported interventions. The self -collection of 
DBS—drops of whole blood collected on filter paper from a simple and inexpensive finger 
prick —proposed in this study provide a  minimally invasive, low cost, feasible and more 
generalizable method81 for measuring biomarkers in the context of a remotely -delivered 
PA intervention with a nationwide sample of BCS. Thus, findings will be more 
generalizable than other PA studies incorporating biomarkers in BCS.       
 
Research Team. The PI, [CONTACT_266890], has extensive experience designing and conducting 
similar physical activity studies in older adults and breast cancer survivors. The co -
investigators are nationally and internationally recognized experts in can cer survivorship 
(Penedo , Cella ), be havioral interventions (Spring, Ackermann, Penedo), mHealth 
(Spring), fractional factorial designs/methodology (Spring), and D&I sciences 
(Ackermann).  
2.[ADDRESS_383075].  The PI’s  dissertation used a [ADDRESS_383076] explained 41% and 49% of the variance in PA at 
baseline and follow -up, respectively.[ADDRESS_383077], via social support, goals and outcome 
expectations.15 Findings were largely consistent among changes in constr ucts over the 6 
month period and when using accelerometry to measure PA.  
Feasibility of recruitment and assessment via Army of Women©. The PI’s dissertation  
also supports the feasibility of recruiting breast cancer survivors via the Army of Women© 
and com pletion of the same, or similar, assessments to those in the present study. Within 
12 hours of recruitment initiation for this study , 2,500 women expressed interested in 
participating and recruitment was halted due to capacity limitations. Of that   number , 
1,631 (64%) responded to screening and qualified to participate. I randomized 500 of 
those women to wear accelerometers for 7 consecutive days. Only 4 refused to wear the 
device.  At baseline and follow -up, 1,527 women (94%) completed more than half of t he 
on-line questionnaires. Valid accelerometer data were obtained from 442 (89%) women 
at baseline; 370 (83.7%) of those women also had valid data at 6 month follow -up. 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Designing with Dissemination in Mind: Optimization of a mHeal th 
Physical Activity Intervention for  Breast Cancer Survivors  (Fit2Thrive)  
 Page 9 of 63 Revis ed Template : November 10, 2014  Reasons for missing accelerometer data at baseline and follow -up, respectively, were: 
did not wear (n=36 and n=40), insufficient valid wear time (n=8 and n=17), accelerometer 
malfunctioned (n=5 at both), lost in mail or by [CONTACT_3445] (n=4 and n=5) and submerged 
in water (n=1).  
Feasibility of mHealth intervention. Data from Pew82 indicate that, as of January 2014, 
58% of Americans own smartphones and 42% own tablet computers suggesting that a 
large proportion of breast cancers likely own this technology. Since we are recruiting from 
the Army of Women© which communicates via e -blasts, we expect these women to be 
relatively tech savvy and interested in mHealth interventions.  
DBS are valid for proposed biomarkers . In studies using self -collection of DBS, ≥90% 
of participant samples83,[ADDRESS_383078]. Funk’s has rigorously tested the performance 
parameters of the proposed i mmunoassay 
protocol  for IL -6, IL -10 and  TNFα to 
determine the limit of detection [range: 0.3 
pg/mL (IL -6) to 1.25 pg/mL (T NFα)], and 
assay linearity [range: 99.0% (IL6) to 113% 
(IL10) ]. Levels of within -assay precision and 
between assay variation are displayed in 
Table 1. Performance  parameters of the 
proposed CRP immunoassay by [CONTACT_311207]  (LHBR)  have also been rigorously  evaluated to 
determine the limit of detection (0.03 mg/l), within - (95.9%) and between - (109%) assay 
variance and assay linearity (95.4% -109% of expected). T he relationship between DBS 
and matched -serum CRP levels is strong and linear (R= 0.96). The Unive rsity of 
Washington Department of Laboratory Medicine (UWLM) , who will quantify 
cardiometabolic biomarkers, found  high correlations between TG (R = 0.97)  and BG (R= 
0.90)  in matched DBS and plasma samples . However, correlations between matched 
DBS and seru m samples for HDL-C (R=0.55) and TC  (R=0.58)  were less optimal85 which 
was unexpected, given  higher correlations were observed in comparisons using samples 
analyzed under controlled laboratory conditions. The reason for this discrepancy is 
unclear, but new assay standards are developed and these relations hips are being re -
established.  
Summary.  Our preliminary work provides evidence for the use of SCT to guide 
intervention design and demonstrates the feasibility of enrolling/retaining and assessing 
participants using Army of Women©.  National smartphone usage data suggest the 
acceptability of a mHea lth PA intervention.

Intervention development typi[INVESTIGATOR_311163], as a whole, has a significant effect 
in randomized clinical trials (RCT).[ADDRESS_383080] and which do not is necessary to continue to 
increase intervention effectiveness and efficiency. Because all intervention components 
are turned “On” in the treatmen t group and “Off” in the control group in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_311164], this 
information cannot be obtained. The Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST)25,[ADDRESS_383081] (efficacy x intervention reach) using available resources. MOST is 
an emerging methodology that may be particularly useful for designing mHealth 
interventions with D&I in mind from the start because of its emphasis on optimization, an 
iterative design process and public health impact.20,[ADDRESS_383082], 
like all theory -based approaches to intervention develop ment, starts by [CONTACT_311208], 
scientific literature, clinical experience, and results from previous studies to establish a 
conceptual model (Step 1a). Based on prior work, we am proposing to use SCT for this 
study. We will complete steps 1b to 3b as part o f the proposed project. Step 1b will involve 
further refinement of the model/component selection to inform Step 2, intervention/app 
design and usability testing . These steps will be performed in collaboration with relevant 
stakeholders (cancer survivors, c linicians, research experts).  Step 3a will pi[INVESTIGATOR_311165], acceptability, and effects on PA and important patient reported outcomes 
(PROs) of each of the intervention components and component combinations. Step 3b 
involves collection of partici pant feedback and evaluation of the intervention components 
and combinations. The present study will provide the necessary preliminary data to apply 
for future grants  steps 4a -5. The MOST framework has rarely been applied to the 
development of behavioral i nterventions, and to the best of our knowledge, has never 
been specifically applied to the development of a PA intervention in cancer survivors.

• Adults unable to consent  
• Individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers)  
• Pregnant women  
• Prisoners  
 
4.0 Study -Wide Number of Subjects :  
Phase 1.  We will recruit s takeholders includ ing breast cancer survivors (n= 30 for 
interviews ; up to 100  for usability testing), experts and clinicians (n=10 -15; e.g.

from local community organ izations (e.g. Gilda’s Club Chicago, the YMCA and American 
Cancer Society Illinois Chapter).  
 
Phase 2.  We plan to accrue a nationwide sample of 256 women to the intervention pi[INVESTIGATOR_311168].  Approximately 50% of these will be assigned to the buddy co ndition. As 
such we will accrue 128 buddies. We anticipate 80% of these “buddies” (n=102) will 
agree to participate in the optional questionnaire assessments. We will recruit up to [ADDRESS_383090] -intervention interviews.  
 
 
5.0 Study -Wide Recruitment Methods : 
5.1 When, where and how potential subjects will be recruited.  
Phase 1 . Women  will be recruited from the Army of Women (AOW) e -blast.© The AOW is 
an online initiative that connects breast cancer researchers with women who are wi lling 
to participate in research. The database currently consists of ≥375,000 women. Of these, 
~30% (112,500) self -report a breast cancer history. Women interested in participating in 
the current stud y will respond to the e -blast consenting to have their c ontact information 
released by [CONTACT_311210]. Their contact [CONTACT_311211] , then, be 
forwarded to the study investigator who will provide a description of the study and further 
screen for eligibility either via on -line screening question naires or telephone interview. 
Eligible breast cancer survivors will be offered the opportunity to participate and will 
complete informed consent.   
 
Community representatives will be recruited in conjunction with NU’s Center for 
Community Health (led by [CONTACT_15957] -I [CONTACT_311268])  via personalized e -mails and phone calls . 
Experts will be recruited through the RHLCCC and the PI’s, co-investigators’  professional 
networks  via listservs and personalized e -mails and phone calls .  
 
Phase 2.  Breast  cancer survivors  will be recruited through an e -blast sent to members of 
the Army of Women©, an online initiative that connects breast cancer researchers with 
women who are willing to participate in research. The database currently consists of 
≥375,000 women and men. Of th ese, ~30% (112,500) self -report a breast cancer history. 
Women interested in participating in the current study will respond to the e -blast.  Their 
contact [CONTACT_311212] a 
description of the study and further screen for eligibility either via on -line screening 
questionnaires or telephone interview. Eligible breast cancer survivors will be offered the 
opportunity to participate and will complete informed consent.  
 
If our recruitment goals are not be ing sufficiently met via the Army of Women© we will also 
post study fliers and advertisements on social media sites (i.e. Facebook, 
PatientsLikeMe) and on -line forums (i.e. Sisters Network, Nueva Vida, Living Beyond 
Breast Cancer). In addition we will send  recruitment emails to all women from previous 
studies who consented to being contact[CONTACT_311213]. All 
women who are recruited through these alternative strategies will be instructed to contact

Phase 1. We will select [ADDRESS_383096] 45-60 minutes . We anticipate expert/clinical 
stakeholders and community/advocacy partner interviews will last approximately 30 -45 
minutes . Survivors who participate in the app development process (n= 100) will 
participate in  up to  two app development sessions (approximately 1 hour each) and

 Page 16 of 63 Revis ed Template : November 10, 2014  possibly a  field testing of the app/intervention components  (duration of 5 to 14 days) . 
During the field testing, participants, will spend approximately 30 -60 minutes interacting 
with the study app  each day  including entering information and providing real time 
feedback to developers on features they do and do not  like. There is a chance 
saturation/consensus will be reached during the field testing before all survivors have had 
a chance to participate. Therefore, some survivors may not participate in the field testing 
and post-field testing app development session .  
Phase 2.  Survivors will participate in a [ADDRESS_383097]-intervention  intervi ew, will participate 
for approximately 30-45 minutes.  
7.2  Duration anticipated to enroll all study subjects.  
Table 2 details  the full study timeline. Specific details for each phase are as follows:  
 
Phase 1. We anticipate it will take 3 months to recruit/complete initial interviews , 3-6 
months to design/refine and program intervention/app components, and [ADDRESS_383098] cancer survivors (n= 100). We have planned 12 -18 
months f or intervention/app development and will meet bi -weekly with developers to 
ensure suffici ent progress towards this goal.  
 
Phase 2. We anticipate it will take [ADDRESS_383099]-intervention  interviews.

8.0 Study Endpoints  
8.1 Describe the primary and secondary study endpoints.  
Primary study endpoint: intervention feasibility/acceptability.  
Feasibility:  This will be measured during the intervention, immediately post -intervention 
and after the follow -up period. M easures include:  
• Intervention reach :  # of participants enrolled/# of eligible individuals  
• Participant retention : # of participants who drop out/# of participants randomized  
PROTOCOL TITLE: Designing with Dissemination in Mind: Optimization of a mHeal th 
Physical Activity Intervention for  Breast Cancer Survivors  (Fit2Thrive)  
 Page 17 of 63 Revis ed Template : November 10, 2014  • Intervention Adherence : % of weeks adhered to exercise prescription during 
interv ention period  
• Intervention Maintenance : % of weeks adhered to exercise prescription during 
follow -up period  
• Intervention component engagement:  
o During intervention : # of times, on average, participants interacted with each 
intervention component during intervention  
o During follow -up: # of times, on average, participants interacted with each 
intervention component  during follow -up 
o Total:  # of times, on average, parti cipants interacted with each intervention 
component  over intervention and follow -up 
 
Acceptability: This will be measured via a process evaluation immediately post -
intervention at 12 weeks and after the follow -up period  at 24 weeks . This evaluation will 
assess the following:  
• Perceived effectiveness of intervention components/app; use of app/intervention 
materials; plans to continue PA/app use; elements of intervention liked/disliked; 
satisfaction with program delivery, assessments and staff  
 
Secondary study endpoints:  Seconda ry study endpoints include physical activity (self -
report and objectively measured), social cognitive theory constructs (self -efficacy, 
outcome expectations, social support, physical activity enjoyment) ,  patient -reported 
outcomes (fatigue, health -related quality of life, cognitive functioning, physical functioning 
and depression)  and BC progression and CVD risk biomarkers . Secondary study 
endpoints will be assessed at baseline, post -intervention and at the end of the follow -up 
period. We will also assess c ovariates including demographic (i.e. marital status, number 
of children, height, body weight, occupation, age, income and education), breast cancer 
characteristics and history (date of diagnosis, type of treatment, length of treatment, 
disease stage, tumo r receptor status, recurrence, etc.) and general health history (i.e. 
comorbid conditions, height, weight, fruit and vegetable consumption, smoking history, 
etc.) Covariates will be assessed at baseline.

sessions may occur via the telephone or web (i.e. Skype), at the partner’s workplace or 
at some other public loc ation (i.e. library, coffee house). Breast cancer survivors’ 
interviews will be completed via telephone. Because we anticipate interest will be greater 
than capacity, we will select [ADDRESS_383105] session to further vet int ervention 
components .. Community and expert stakeholders will also be provided with a study 
information sheet at the end of their interview for their reference. The interview will take 
45-60 minutes  for community partners/experts and 30 -45 minutes for surv ivors .  
 
 App Development Session 1:  Following completion of the interviews with the survivor 
subgroup, all survivors will be invited to participate in the first app development session 
which will be a two -part on -line survey. The first part will ask survivors to provide feedback 
on their pre ferences and opi[INVESTIGATOR_311174]. The second part will present 
wireframes of potential components and solicit input on their perceived usefulness and 
effectiveness. All women (n=100) will participate in this session. Both parts of the session 
will ta ke up to [ADDRESS_383106] version 
of the intervention components. All components selected for testing will meet the following 
criteria: a) hypothesized to target one primary SCT construct and enhance PA adherence 
via pathways detailed in Figure 1; b) have a clear relative advantage in terms of influence 
on PA and cost/burden and c) are approved by [CONTACT_104977].  Particip ants will be sent an 
initial e -mail with a link to the survey and up to [ADDRESS_383107] Session : Survivors will be sent an 
email asking them to participate in a conf erence call to go over an executive summary of 
findings from the interviews and App Development Session 1. This session will ask 
survivors their opi[INVESTIGATOR_311175] (see attached 
guide). The conference call will be audi o recorded and then be used to reach consensus 
before proceeding with initial development of the app prototype.  
 
Field Test:   Survivors (n=100) will participate in an app field test. They will be assigned in 
waves of up to [ADDRESS_383108] tested it, or

session. Th e purposes of this field study is NOT to test how well  it works to increase PA, 
but rather to evaluate the app’s functioning and ease of use in everyday life. Participants 
will be explicitly instructed NOT to change their usual physical activity patterns a s part of 
this field test. They may be asked to enter some data on your behaviors, motivation and 
symptoms to test functionality of these components. However, participants will be 
explicitly instruct that these data do not necessarily need to reflect their  true ratings. These 
data will not be used for any purposes other than to test the functioning of the app.  
Participants will spend approximately [ADDRESS_383110] which will include providing any feedback  to developers in real -time, 
as they use the app, regarding features you do and do not like and functionality. Prior to 
the initiation of field testing participants will be sent an update e -mail and asked to indicate 
whether they own a Fitbit and how tech savvy they are so this information can be taken 
into account when reviewing their responses.   
 
App Development Session 2 :  Immediately after completing the field test, survivors will 
be asked to complete an on -line survey and/or attend a telephone or web -based session 
to provide feedback on the intervention features they liked and disliked and any ideas 
they have on what could be changed and/or improved.  Depending on the ability to 
schedule survivors this may be individual or involve up to [ADDRESS_383111] up to 60 minutes.   
• Wave 1  (n=10)  and Wave 3  (n=10 -20) of Field Testing  and App Development 
Session 2:  
o For the field test: Participants will be sent an email notifying them they have 
been selected and asking them to download and use the test version of the 
app for a minimum of 3 days over the course of a 7 -10 days. Participants 
will be provided with instructions on how to down load the app and provide 
feedback to the study team in real -time.  
o For App Development Session 2:  At the end of that period, participants will 
be sent the app post -field test survey and asked to complete it.  
o Participants will be sent up to 3 reminders for  each of the following tasks: 
using and providing feedback on the app and completion of the field test 
survey.   
• Wave 2  of Field Testing  (n=10 -15) and App Development Session 2:  
o For the field test: Participants will be sent an email notifying them they have 
been selected and asking them to complete the App Notification Field Test 
Survey . Participants will be sent up to 3 reminders to complete the survey.  
o For App Development Session 2:  Wave 2 partici pants will not complete this 
since they are not using the app .

potential  participants will first confirm interest in research participation  and proceed to 
complete screening questions assessing for eligibility criteria (e.g., demographics, cancer  
diagnosis, age).  After an individual passes the initial screening, they will automatically be 
redirected to complete the Physical Activity Readiness  
Questionnaire (PAR -Q).[ADDRESS_383115] informat ion 
and scheduling availability. Scored  PAR-Q respo nses will be reviewed to determine if 
physician approval  is required prior to participation. Those who require approval will be 
flagged for follow -up. 
• If not ineligible :  Participants will be thanked for their interest and directed to on -
line resources for  physical activity and nutrition for cancer survivors.  
• If eligible : Participants will be receive a  study orientation call. Prior to this call, 
they will be sent a copy of the informed consent  and a study overview  handout .

Assessments  
After completion of informed consent, women will 
be e -mailed  baseline study questionnaires via 
RedCap and notification that their accelerometer 
packet has been placed in the mail. The 
accelerometer packet  includes: accelerometer, accelerometer instructions, 
accelerometer log , printed copy of the  informed consent, a  self-addressed stamped return 
envelope  to return the accelerometer . Questionnaires will take approximately 30 -45 
minutes to complete and p artici pants will be asked to complete the  on-line study 
questionnaires  within 10 days of receipt. They will be asked t o wear the accelerometer 
for 7 consecutive day s starting on the day indicated on the log and mail it back to study 
investigators  at the end of t he 7 days period .

Intervention  Components  
CORE intervention . The CORE will be delivered to all par ticipants to build essential 
competencies needed to increase physical activity safely . The CORE  will include the 
following:  
• Educational website : This w ill provide participants with  information and  knowledge  
about the benefits for physical activity, safely progressing through an exercise 
program and strategies for effective ly changing and maintaining physical activity 
behavior (i.e. social support, goal -setting) . This site will be available as a 
standalone si te and embedded within the app .  
• Basic smartphone app : Features of this app include , but are not limited to, the  
ability to  monitor  and track  physical activity , pre-specified weekly physical activity 
goals  and feedback on progress.  
• Fitbit : Participants wi ll be instructed to wear the device on the provided belt clip or 
wristband during all waking hours  every day of the study  to assist in monitoring 
and tracking physical activity . The Fitbit will c ommunicate with the app  so data are 
integrated .  
Participants  will also be randomized to receive the following components :  
1. App+ : Participants assigned to this component will receive a “deluxe” version of 
the app .  This will include all of  the features of the basic app plus additional app 
modules  listed below.  
a. Weekly Goal -Setting  Tool: Allows to schedule activities for specific days of 
the week  and set reminders for these activities.  
b. Challenges : Provides weekly challenges (i.e. 5,000 step s/day challenge; 5 
min MVPA/day)  participants can enroll in and automatically tracks progress . 
Progressively harder challenges become “unlocked” as participants 
complete less intense challenges.  
c. Newsfeed : Space where study staff will post content includin g, but not 
limited to , Fit Studies  (lay summaries of physical activity research) , Fit 
Survivor Spotlights  (stories about women who have successfully changed 
their behavior) , Workout Ideas and other motivational content.   
 
2. Telephone Support  Calls . Participants assigned to this component will receive a 
call from study staff to check -on on their progress, provide motivation and 
troubleshoot any issues they may have. These calls will occur bi -weekly (6 total)  
during the initial 12 week intervention pe riod. All calls will be recorded for quality 
control.

 Page 25 of 63 Revis ed Template : November 10, 2014   
3. “On-line” Exercise Classes : Participants assigned to this condition will receive 
access to a digital download for a commercially available walking DVD and 
suggestions for weekly workouts from the same instructor’s YouTube channel on 
a private study YouTube playlist  that will only be  accessible to individuals assigned 
to this component of the intervention. These videos will be vetted by [CONTACT_311221]. Participants will also receive 
a weekly survey to indicate how frequently they used  this component.  
 
4. Fitbit “Buddy ”: Participants assigned to this condition will select a “buddy” from 
their personal life (friend, co -worker, child, spouse, sibling, etc.) to help support 
them. The buddy will be  mailed a Fitbit. Both the participant and “buddy” will 
receive training materials on how to make the most out of their relationship which 
will include how to use the social features of the Fitbit app, how to seek support 
(participant) and provide support (buddy),  and receive bi-weekly emails (6 total) 
during the initial 12 week intervention period geared towards facilitating social 
support. Participants will also receive a weekly survey to indicate how frequently 
they used this component.  
a. All buddies will receive  an email from the participant explaining the study, 
complete pre -screening and undergo an on -line consent.  
i. Buddies will be required to complete the PAR -Q and will be required 
to get physician consent if they fail.  
b. Buddy Involvement: As a “buddy” individ uals will be asked to agree to the 
following:  
i. Complete  on-line informed consent  
ii. Regularly wear the Fitbit  
iii. “Friend” the study participant on the Fitbit app  
iv. Share their Fitbit data with study investigators  
1. Fitbit study accounts for each individual buddy wil l be created  
by [CONTACT_311222]’s Fitbit data. E ach buddy will be asked to use the Fitbit 
account and password provided during their duration of 
participation in the Fit2Thrive Study .  
2. To fully protect confident ially, we will provide a study email 
address that will not include any personally identifying 
information to be used with the Fitbit app (i.e. F2Tbx100 and 
[EMAIL_6129] ). 
3. The RedCap study database is the only place where the 
identification number, the participant’s name, Fitbit email and 
Fitbit username [CONTACT_311263] [CONTACT_311223]  
4. Since participa nts will be allowed to keep the Fitbit device at 
the conclusion of data collection, all participants will also be 
instructed on how to change their Fitbit email and username 
[INVESTIGATOR_184723].  
v. Provide support to the study participant  
PROTOCOL TITLE: Designing with Dissemination in Mind: Optimization of a mHeal th 
Physical Activity Intervention for  Breast Cancer Survivors  (Fit2Thrive)  
 Page 26 of 63 Revis ed Template : November 10, 2014  vi. Complete  optional on -line surveys at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 
week follow -up.  
5. Text messages : Participants in this component  will receive regular messages that 
are motivational and target SCT constructs (i.e. “ The best way to stay on top of 
your game is by [CONTACT_311224]! Do that here and make things easier! ” ; 
“Exercise not only contributes to a healthier lifestyle, but it has also been shown to 
boost productivity and creativity. Be strong, think smart! ”) and provide feedback on 
intervention progress (i.e. ” You only met y% of your goal last week. It can be hard 
to fit exercise into your schedule, but remember every minute counts! ”).   
 
Follow -up 
At the end of [ADDRESS_383121] 
access to all “automated” intervention materials for the condition assigned . However, all 
regular contact [CONTACT_311225].   
 
Retention Plan  
To preven t attrition, study staff will develop good rapport with participants during 
recruitment and maintain the relationship throughout the study . Participants will be  
provided with a phone number to call immediately if they encounter any tech issues with 
the app lication  or Fitbit . Staff will convey reminders of scheduled assessments by [CONTACT_311226]. Participants will  also be incentivized $20 to complete baseline, 12 week and 24 
week assessments for a total of $60, and will be allowed to keep the Fitbit if they complete 
the 12 week intervention . Individuals who participate in the optional blood sample 
collection will be paid $ 15.00 at each time point ($ 45.00 total) upon receipt of thei r blood 
sample.   
 
Additionally, i n order to enhance subject retention we will occasionally send greeting 
cards for various holidays (i.e. Winter holidays, Thanksgiving, Breast Cancer Awareness 
month, birthdays, etc.) or milestones (i.e. study completion, half way through the study, 
etc.) via the USPS or an on -line service (i.e. Paperless Post or  Evite).  
 
If a participant does not track any activity via the app or Fitbit for 7 consecutive days, 
study staff will reach out to the participant via phone and/o r e-mail. If we are unable to 
reach a participant after [ADDRESS_383122] the participant’s 
emergency/locator contacts. Participants will identify two  emergency/ locator contacts  that 
may be notified if contact [CONTACT_311227]. Emergency/l ocator contacts  
will be associates of the participant who have a different telephone and email address 
from the participant  and who agree to serve as  emergency contacts for the participant. 
One locator/emergency contact [CONTACT_311228]. We 
will only attempt to contact a n emergency/ locator contact  [CONTACT_311229] [ADDRESS_383123] the 
participant’s designated emergency/ locator contact . We will only make one phone call 
attempt to reach a n emergency/ locato r contact . If we are unable to reach the contact , we 
will attempt to leave a voice mail.

during the preceding [ADDRESS_383125] on file in the event we are fail to reach the participant 
after 5 or more attempts . If participant reports “YES” to item 5A-5D (see RedCap form) , 
an adverse event form will be filed with the IRB. The non -spontaneous Adverse Events 
Questionnaire will not be given to buddies of BCS participants to complete  since they are 
not being specifically a sked or encouraged to increase their physical activity participaiton . 
All identified adverse events will be reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_311177] (includes subject’s name, date and event description). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_311178]-investigators , the IRB and NU Office for the Protection of Research 
Subjects to determine whether the event should be classified as ‘non -attributable’, 
‘possibly attributable’ or ‘attributable’ to the current project and ‘serious’ or ‘non -serious.’ 
Adverse event reports will be submitted to the IRB within 5 business  days of the event or 
notification to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_311179]. All serious adverse events will be 
reported to the RHLCCC Clinical Research Office for review by [CONTACT_311230]: Designing with Dissemination in Mind: Optimization of a mHeal th 
Physical Activity Intervention for  Breast Cancer Survivors  (Fit2Thrive)  
 Page 28 of 63 Revis ed Template : November 10, 2014  Committee, IRB, and the National Cancer Institute, as applicable, using appropriate 
forms. Any action to be taken will be recorded in the adverse event log.  
An adverse events is defined as an unanticipated problem which meets all of the 
following criteria:  a) unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given the 
research procedures described in protocol -related documents and the characteristics of 
the subject population being studied, b) related or possibly related to participation in the 
resear ch and c) suggests that the research places subjects or others at a different or 
greater risk of harm than was previously known or recognized. A ‘serious’ adverse event 
is defined as any event in which the outcome results in any of the following: death, a life-
threatening adverse drug experience, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929] (for > 24 hours), a persistent or significant disability/ incapacity or 
substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; a congenital anomaly 
or birth defect; important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, 
or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, 
based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the part icipant and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed, above. All other 
events will be considered ‘non -serious.’  
In addition to reporting any events as they occur to the IRB, a progress report and 
request for IRB re newal will be submitted the Northwestern University IRB annually. All 
non-serious adverse events will also be submitted to the RHLCCC Clinical Research 
office semi -annually. Furthermore, study progress reports will be submitted to the 
RHLCCC Clinical Resea rch Office Data Monitoring Committee semi -annually. These 
reports will include accrual, withdrawals, reported adverse events and compliance issues.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_383126] to how much time interviews,  and/or app development will involve. All 
interviews and telephone/web -based app development sessions and interviews will be 
digitally recorded  when possible ; digital files will be stored on a password -secured 
network drive. Recordings will be transcribed verbatim and de -identified.  Recordings will 
be destroyed at the end of the study. For intervention development, each  participant will 
be randomly assigned an identification number to  ensure confidentiality of data. All raw 
data will be de -identified and kept confidential . 
Although, t he purpose of this field test is NOT to test how well it works to increase 
physical activity, but rather to evaluate the app’s functioning and ease of use in everyday 
life and participants will be explicitly told NOT to change their PA behavior and that the 
data they  enter does not have to be accurate , we do recognize that some individuals 
may still attempt to increase their PA and to accurately respond to questions/prompts. 
Thus, we will follow  the same procedures detailed, below, for Phase 2.  
 Electronic versions o f all data will be kept on a password protected network with access 
limited to study investigators. Only the investigators will have access to participant data. 
Confidentially will be further maintained by [CONTACT_311231]. All staff with access to the data with have completed

the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) Training Modules.     
Phase 2.  All participants will be informed during screening and in their informed consent 
with respect to how much time the program, questionnaire completion, and all testing will 
involve. In addition, they will also be informed of the risks associated with partici pating 
in an exercis e program. Survivors and buddies  will be informed that participation is 
completely voluntary and they can discontinue at any point. They  will also be provided 
with the option “I prefer not to answer” for every question in the study so t hey can opt -
out of answering any questions for which they do not want to share responses or which 
make them uncomfortable.  
Breast cancer survivors will be provided with an exercise prescription to progress safely 
through the program to minimize risk  (see Table 5). All participants  will be able to contact 
[CONTACT_311232], e -mail or messaging through the app should 
they have any concerns regarding participation.  
 Each participant will be randomly assigned an identification number to ensure 
confidentiality of data. RedCap does require an e -mail address to send the patient 
reported outcome measure links to participants and thus, data will be temporarily linked 
to individuals’ e -mail addresses and first names which may be included in the e -mail for 
personalization purposes. However, these links will be removed when questionnaire data 
is downloaded and thi s data will then only be linked to the participant’s identification 
number. Nitro Study Tracker , NOTIS and the study RedCap tracking database are the 
only place s where the identification number and the participant’s name [CONTACT_311264] [CONTACT_473].  
For post -intervention interviews, a ll participants will be informed during screening and in 
their informed consent with respect to how much time interviews will involve. All 
interviews will be digita lly recorded  when possible ; digital files will be stored on a 
password -secured network drive. Recordings will be transcribed verbatim and de -
identified.  Recordings will be destroyed at the end of the study.  Table 5. Fit2Thrive Exercise Prescription

9.4 Study Measures.  
A. Phase 1  
Interviews  
• Questions for the interviews  are included in the Appendix. Questions will be related to 
their perceptions of specific intervention/app components, recommendations for 
features, changes or enhancements.  
App Development Session 1 Survey  
• This survey asks participants about their prefer ences and opi[INVESTIGATOR_311180]. Participants will also provide 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_311181]/wireframes of potential app features.  
 
Post -Field Test  Survey for Individuals Given the App to Test : 
• Participants will provide information on:  
o Learnability: E ase and time to learn system  
o Effectiveness: System’s ability to promote performance and 
productivity  
o Efficiency:  System’s ability to improve speed at which they perform  
o Errors:  Impact of errors on u sing system and ability to recover from 
errors  
o Flexibility:  System’s ability to provide different command or routes 
to achieve same goal 
o Memorability: Ability to remember how to use system next time and 
ability to re -learn system after periods of non -use 
o User Satisfaction:  Fondness, perceptions and opi[INVESTIGATOR_311182] (Wave [ADDRESS_383129])  
• Participants will be asked to rate app notification message content and 
provide any additional feedback for improving messages .  
 
B. Phase 2  
Primary Outcome Measures  
Feasibility:  This will be measured during the intervention, immediately post -intervention 
and after the follow -up period. Measures include:  
• Intervention reach :  # of participants enrolled/# of eligible individuals  
PROTOCOL TITLE: Designing with Dissemination in Mind: Optimization of a mHeal th 
Physical Activity Intervention for  Breast Cancer Survivors  (Fit2Thrive)  
 Page 31 of 63 Revis ed Template : November 10, 2014  • Participant retention: # of participants who drop out/# of participants randomized  
• Intervention Adherence : % of weeks adhered to exercise prescription during 
intervention period  
• Intervention Maintenance : % of weeks adhere d to exercise prescription during 
follow -up period  
• Intervention component engagement:  
o During intervention : # of times, on average, participants interacted with each 
intervention component during intervention  
o During follow -up: # of times, on average, participants interacted with each 
intervention component  during follow -up 
o Total:  # of times, on average, participants interacted with each intervention 
component  over intervention and follow -up 
 
Acceptability:  This will be measured via a process e valuation immediately post -
intervention and after the follow -up period. This evaluation will assess the following:  
• perceived effectiveness of intervention components/app; use of app/intervention 
materials; plans to continue PA/app use; elements of interve ntion liked/disliked; 
satisfaction with program delivery, assessments and staff  
 
Screening   
Physical Activity Readiness  Questionnaire  (PAR -Q).96 This pre -screening questionnaire 
assesses cardiovascular disease history, symptoms, risk factors and other hea lth issues. 
Women indicating ≥ [ADDRESS_383130] cancer survivor participants and buddies 
unless otherwise indicated. Assessment will be conducted at baseline, 3 weeks 
(survivors only), 12 weeks and 24 weeks.  
 
Mobile Device Proficiency Questionnaire.98 This survey assess both assessing both 
basic and advanced proficiencies  related to smartphone and tablet use across eight 
subscales: (a)  Mobile Device Basics, (b) Communication, (c) Data and File Storage, (d)  
Internet, (e) Calendar, (f) Entertainment, (g) Privacy, and (h) Troubleshooting  and 
Software Management.  
 
Demographics .  Data will be collected on participant’s current age, race, ethnicity, 
employment status, number of children, education, marital  status, income, height and 
weight.   
Breast Cancer History . Participants will be asked to indicate their current menopausal 
status and provide details on the prior breast cancer diagnosis including: date of 
diagnosis, stage of disease, treatment type and duration and hormone receptor status. 
Women will be asked to i ndicate similar data for any cancer recurrences or second

 Page 32 of 63 Revis ed Template : November 10, [ADDRESS_383131] of 20 chronic conditions including 
diabetes, heart disease, multiple sclerosis, depression, etc. and provide information of 
other general health behaviors (e.g. smoking, drinking, fruit and vegetable consumption, 
etc.). A slightly different version to capture potential cancer diagnoses will be used 
for buddy participants . 
Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) .99 The GLTEQ is a simple, self -
administered instrument that has been widely used in epi[INVESTIGATOR_904], clinical, and 
behavioral change studies and has been shown to be both a valid and reliable measure 
of PA participation. Participants will be asked indicate th e frequency and average amount 
of time they spent engaging in strenuous (e.g., jogging), moderate (e.g., fast walking), 
and mild (e.g., easy walking) exercise over the past seven days. Weekly frequencies of 
strenuous, moderate, and light activities are mul tiplied by [CONTACT_269615], five, and three, 
respectively. These values are added to obtain a total leisure activity score.  Test -retest 
reliability coefficient range from r=0.[ADDRESS_383132] cancer 
survivors will also answer a modified version asking them about their PA before 
diagnosis  at baseline.  
Actigraph Accelerometer (model wGT3X -BT, Health One Technology, Fort Walton 
Beach, FL) . The Actigraph is a valid and reliable objective PA measure .100,101 It is small, 
lightweight, has a rechargeable battery that lasts for up to 25 days and provides no 
feedback to participants. Participants will be instructed to wear t he monitor on the non -
dominant hip during all waking hours for 7 consecutive days, except when bathing or 
swimming. Activity data will be collected in one -minute intervals (epochs). Participants 
will record any time the accelerometer was not worn on a log . The ActiLife software will 
be used to derive wear time, identify outliers and summarize daily variables of the 
minute -by-minute data. Non -wear time will be defined as intervals of at least 60 
consecutive minutes of zero counts, with allowance for up to 2 minutes of observations 
of less than 100 counts/min within the non -wear interval.102A valid day of accelerometer 
wear wi ll be defined as ≥10 hours of wear time. Each valid minute of wear time will be 
classified according to intensity (counts/min) using commonly accepted activity count 
cut-points 102,103 as follows: sedentary (<100), light activity (100 -759), lifestyle activity 
(760-2019), and MVPA (≥ 2020).  This measure will only be used for breast cancer 
survivor participants.  
Sitting Time Questionnaire .104 Women will be asked to indicate the amount of time they 
spend on a typi[INVESTIGATOR_311183]: traveling to 
and from places, while at work, while watching television, wh ile using a computer at 
home in leisure time NOT including television (e.g. visiting friends, movies, dining out, 
etc.). Test -retest reliability coefficients were high for weekday sitting time at work,

for weekend days across all domains (r s=0.23 -0.74).104     
PROMIS Applied Cognition -General Concerns Short Form 8a.105 The PROMIS Applied 
Cognition General Concerns Short Form 8a will be used to assess participants’ 
frequency of perceived cognitive function over the past 7 days ranging  from 1 (not at al l) 
to 5 (very often). Higher scores reflect higher levels of cognitive concerns. The reliability 
of this measure ranges from α=0.90 to α=0.95.106 
 
PROMIS Physical Function Short Form 20a.105 The PROMIS Physical Function Short 
Form 20a will be used to assess participants’ physical function. The scale has two 
subscale limitations and interference. For the [ADDRESS_383133] 7 days on a 
scale from 1 (unable to do) to 5 (without any difficulty). For the 4 limitations items, 
patients will rate the degree to which their health  limits them in specific activities on a 
scale from 1 (cannot do) to 5 (not at all).  Higher scores reflect better physical function. 
The reliability of this measure ranges from α=0.90 to α=0.95.106  
 
PROMIS Fatigue Short Form 8a.105 The PROMIS Fatigue Short Form 8a will be used to 
assess participants’ frequency of fatigue symptoms ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very 
much) and fatigue interference ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (always) over the past [ADDRESS_383134] higher levels of fatigue. The reliability of this measure ranges from 
α=0.90 to α=0.95.106 
 
PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Short Form 8a.105 The PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Short 
Form 8a will be used to assess participants’ rating of overall sleep quality from 1 (very 
good) to 5 (very poor) and perceptions of specific characteristics of sleep quality on a 
scale ranging  from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). Higher scores reflect higher levels of 
sleep disturbanc e. The reliability of this measure ranges from α=0.90 to α=0.95.[ADDRESS_383135] 7 days on a 5 point scale from 1 
(never) to 5 (always). Higher scores reflect higher depressive symptoms. The reliability 
of this measures ranges from α=0.90 to α=0.95.106  
 
PROMIS Sleep -Related Impairment Short Form 8a . 105 The PROMIS Sleep –Related 
Impairment Disturbance Short Form 8a will be used to assess participants’ perceptions 
or sleep -related impairment on a scale ranging  from 1 (not at all) to 5 ( very much). Higher 
scores reflect higher levels of sleep -related impairment. The reliability of this measure 
ranges from α=0.90 to α=0.95.[ADDRESS_383136] interclass

0.27 to 0.81.107  
Exercise Self -efficacy Scale .108 The 6 -item Exercise Self -Efficacy Scale will be used to 
assess participants’ beliefs in their ability to exercise five times per week, at a moderate 
intensity, for 30 or more minutes per session at two week increments over the next 12 
weeks. Items will be rated on a 100 -point percentage scale with 10 -point increments, 
ranging from 0% (not at all confident) to 100% (highly confident).  The internal 
consistency for this measure has demonstra ted acceptability (α=0.90).108  
Barriers Self -efficacy Scale .108 The 15 -item Barriers Self -Efficacy Scale will be used to 
assess participants’ beliefs in their ability to exercise three times per week for the next 3 
months in the face of commonly exp eriences barriers to activity. Items will be rated on a 
100-point percentage scale with 10 -point increments, ranging from 0% (not at all 
confident) to 100% (highly confident).  The internal consistency for this measure has 
demonstrated acceptability (α=0.8 6).[ADDRESS_383137] demonstrated support for  exercise behaviors in the previous 3 months. 
The frequency for each item is rated once for both family and friends on a 5 -point Likert 
scale, ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (very often). The friend and family subscales have 
demonstrated acceptable internal c onsistency (α=0.84 and α=0.84, respectively).  109 
Effective Social Support for Physical Activity .110 This scale assesses perceptions of support 
given (for buddy) and received (for BCS). The scale assesses three different types of help or 
support: 1) Help wit h practical needs, 2) Advice or information, and 3) Emotional support. There 
will be a separate version for Buddies and breast cancer survivor participants assigned 
to the buddy condition only.  
Exercise Goal -setting Scale.111 This 10 -item scale will assess participants exercise -
related goal -setting, self -monitoring and problem solving and instructs participants to 
indicate the extent to which each of the statements describes them on a scale from 1 
(does not describe) to 6 (describes completely). This scale has demonstrated good 
internal consistency (α= 0.89). 111 
Multidimensional Outcome Expectations for Exercise Scale.112 This scale will assess 
participants’ social (4 items), self -evaluative (5 items), and physical (6 items) outcome 
expectations for exercise participation on a 5 point scale ranging from 1 (strongly 
disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).  The three subscales have demonstrated good internal 
consistency (α= 0.82 for physical outcome expectations, α= 0.81 for social outcome 
expectations, and α= 0.84 for self -evaluative outcome ex pectations).112 
Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale.113 This 18-item scale will assess the degree to which 
participants, at the current moment, enjoy doing any sort of physical activity.  This 18 -item 
scale rates enjoyment on a 7 -point bipolar scale (“It makes me depressed”…”It makes 
me happy”).  This measure has demonstrated good internal consistency in previous 
studies (α= 0. 93 to α= 0. 96).113

11.0 Data and Specimen Management  
11.1 Data Analysis Plan . 
Phase 1. Stakeholders will contribute to intervention component development via 
interviews  which will be digitally recorded; digital files will be stored on a password -
secured network drive . Recordings will be transcribed verbatim and de -identified. Three  
coders will independently review the de -identified transcripts, identify emergent themes, 
and assign initial codes using constant comparative analysis. This iterative process codes 
data based on identified conceptual themes.  Data will be organized using NVivo 
software. Coders will meet often to discuss and refine the emerging themes, and 
triangulate their perspectives. Once a final coding structure is identified, coders will 
independently return to the transcripts to re -examine them and recode as necessar y to 
ensure consistency. Disagreements will be resolved through deliberation and consensus. 
Analysis will identify  the three stakeholder groups (survivors, experts, community 
organizations)  perspecti ves on desirable components for inclusion.  All groups’ 
perceptions of components, how to implement  the proposed intervention and  strategies 
for tailoring intervention content, and tactics for overcoming challenges to implementation  
will be integrated. These components will be vetted via the  Breast Cancer Survivo r 
Stakeholder Advisory Board Session . After vetting from the advisory board, the final 5 
components will be selected for development.   
Once components to be tested are identified and the app is under development, usability 
testing will begin. For this, su rvivors will be given a defined set of tasks to complete. They 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Designing with Dissemination in Mind: Optimization of a mHeal th 
Physical Activity Intervention for  Breast Cancer Survivors  (Fit2Thrive)  
 Page 37 of 63 Revis ed Template : November 10, 2014  will be observed to determine the ease with which they navigate using various app 
functions (e.g. error rates, time to complete tasks, etc.). Survivors will also provide 
qualitative  and quantitative  feedback regarding features, ease of use, and likeability. 
Usability tests will be rapid and iterative. During the field testing  period , design changes 
will be completed after receipt of 2 to 5  survivors’ feedback and then tested with the next  
set of [ADDRESS_383141] -field testing  sessions. Finally, survivors 
will participate in a final lab visit where they evaluate the close -to-final intervention and 
provide feedback.  
 
 Phase 2. The effects of the five individual intervention components will be examined by 
[CONTACT_3553] a factorial experiment (see Table 4 for an example). The final factors will be 
determined based on the findings from Phase [ADDRESS_383142]. These experiments: a) separate com ponent effects 
enabling the estimation of the main effect contribution of each candidate component and 
interactions between components114 and b) are more economical compared to alternative 
designs because they often require substantially fewer subjects to achieve the same 
power and use less resources .114,115

Planned analyses for each aim are as follows:  
Aim 1.  All individual  interviews will be digitally recorded; digital files will be stored on a 
password -secured network drive. Recordings will be transcribed verbatim and de -
identified. Three coders will independently review the de -identified transcripts, identify 
emergent the mes, and assign initial codes using constant comparative analysis. This 
iterative process codes data based on identified conceptual themes.  Data will be 
organized using NVivo software. Coders will meet often to discuss and refine the 
emerging themes, and triangulate their perspectives. Once a final coding structure is 
identified, coders will independently return to the transcripts to re -examine them and 
recode as necessary to ensure consistency. Disagreements will be resolved through 
deliberation and conse nsus. Analysis will identify both aides’ and clients’ perceptions of 
implementing the proposed intervention, strategies for tailoring the existing intervention 
content, and tactics for overcoming identified challenges to implementation .

descriptive statistics to determine the learnability, effectiveness, efficiency, errors, 
flexibility , memorability , and user satisfaction  of the app components. We will also 
transcribe verba tim the de -identified digitally audio recorded  files and use these data to 
further assess qualitatively any themes that emerge relative to the components’ 
learnability, effectiveness, efficiency, errors, f lexibility , memorability  and user satisfaction . 
Finally, descriptive statistics (means, standard deviation, frequencies) of questionnaire -
based feedback will be used to further assess the app’s the learnability, effectiveness, 
efficiency, errors, f lexibility , memorability  and user satisfaction .  
Data from participant interviews and questionnaire s completed related to the field 
experiment will be analyzed as described, above, and used to refine the app until 
saturation is reached.   
 
Aim 2. Feasibility and acceptability will be evaluated using the measures detailed above. 
The primary hypotheses are: a) 75% of eligible survivors will agree to participate in the 
intervention; (b) enrollees will demonstrate engagement by [CONTACT_311200] >80% of  the 
study days and using one or more additional app components at least weekly. Descriptive 
analyses (means, frequencies) will be used to describe these results.  Data from post -
intervention interviews will be digitally recorded; digital files will be stored on a password -
secured network drive. Recordings will be transcribed verbatim and de -identified. Three 
coders will independently review the de -identified transcripts, identify emergent themes, 
and assign i nitial codes using constant comparative analysis. This iterative process codes 
data based on identified conceptual themes.  Data will be organized using qualitative data 
analyses software . Coders will meet often to discuss and refine the emerging themes, 
and triangulate their perspectives. Once a final coding structure is identified, coders will 
independently return to the transcripts to re -examine them and recode as necessary to 
ensure consistency. Disagreements will be resolved through deliberation and co nsensus. 
Analysis will identify both aides’ and clients’ perceptions of implementing the proposed 
intervention, strategies for tailoring the existing intervention content, and tactics for 
overcoming identified challenges to implementation .  
 
 
Aim 3 and Exp loratory Aim  1. These aims are to determine the preliminary effectiveness 
of intervention components on minutes of accelerometer -measured moderate and 
vigorous PA  (Aim 3)  and PROs (physical function, fatigue, depression, QOL ; Exploratory 
Aim). Our hypothes is is that a set of components will emerge as most effective for 
increasing PA and minimizing cost , but a second set of intervention component may 
emerge as having the largest, most cost -efficient impact on PROs. These hypotheses will 
be tested using inten tion-to-treat mixed linear model analyses to test differences in 
outcomes by [CONTACT_311235]. The study was not designed to have statistical 
power to detect differences over time with inferential tests. If descriptive statistics suggest 
that the in tervention (a) is feasible and acceptable and (b) seems likely to increase PA, 
we will plan a future randomized controlled trial with sufficient power (>.80) to detect 
clinically -meaningful effects in this population. If we fail to achieve certain benchmar ks for 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Designing with Dissemination in Mind: Optimization of a mHeal th 
Physical Activity Intervention for  Breast Cancer Survivors  (Fit2Thrive)  
 Page 40 of 63 Revis ed Template : November 10, 2014  feasibility, acceptability, or safety, we will refine the protocol as needed prior to 
proceeding.  
 
Exploratory Aim 2. This aim is to explore the relationship between the 5 intervention 
components and each  BC progression (IL -6, IL-10, CRP and TNFα) and cardiometabolic 
(CRP, BG, TG, TC, HDL -C) biomarker. We will also examine effects on overall risk for 
each category using composite z -scores . Our hypothesis is a set of components will 
emerge as most effective  for changing each biomarker, but a second set of components, 
which may not be the same, may emerge as having the greatest composite effect  or being 
most cost -efficient to achieve these outcomes. We will employ an intention -to-treat (ITT) 
approach by [CONTACT_311236]. 
These hypotheses will be tested using intention -to-treat linear mixed model analyses to 
test differences in outcomes by [CONTACT_311235]. We will also test [ADDRESS_383146] ( -1,1) 
coding rather than dummy (0,1) coding, the power for tests to detect main effects and 
interaction effects are identical for effects of identical size. These data will be used in 
conjunction with parent study data to determine which intervention components will be 
tested in a more definitive trial.  
11.[ADDRESS_383147] to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary 
efficacy of the different interve ntion components, sample size planning was determined 
by [CONTACT_311237] (vs. a power analysis ) for the primary aims . 
Dried Blood Spots.  To determine  if the sample size (n=25 6) is sufficient to address our  
exploratory  aim to explore biomarkers obtained via DBS, we conducted  a power analysis 
to calculate  the minim al detectable difference 
(MDD)116 for each biomarker assuming 20% 
attrition at [ADDRESS_383148] between those with the 
component “on” vs. “off” to detect a statistically 
significant  effect . We used standard deviations 
from published BCS PA interventions117 and intra -class correlations (ICC) from [CONTACT_311269]’s prior study,[ADDRESS_383149] 80% power to detect differences at least equal to between group 
differences observed in prior intervention studies for all inflammatory119,[ADDRESS_383150] where the ID will appear with the participant’s

Participants are permitted to refuse to participate in any aspect of the research and may 
withdraw from the study at any point, for any reason without penalt y. 
Phase 2. Potential  risks are considered minimal. Engaging in a PA program when one 
has been sedentary for a considerable period of time incurs some risk of injury such as l 
muscle soreness, strains, aggravation of arthritic conditions, etc. However, ser ious 
physical injury is considered unlikely. In order to reduce and/or prevent any physical harm 
or injury subjects will gradually increase their PA. Additionally, each participa nt will be 
required to pass a screening test or receive medical approval prior to enrollment to ensure 
PA is appropriate. Furthermore, a ll participants, regardless of the intervention 
components they receive, will be provided access to a study website that i s also 
embedded within the app which will include an overview of safety issues and stress the 
need to contact [CONTACT_311241].  
Finally, the intervention content will emphasize safety and present instruc tion to reflect 
safe progressions.  
In addition to the potential minimal risk associated with PA participation, t here are some 
potential minimal psychological risks associated with answering some of the 
questionnaires required for participation in this stu dy. However, participants will be given 
the option to skip any questions that make them feel uncomfortable. Should any 
individuals report scores on the PROMIS Cancer Depression Scale, that are in the 75th 
percentile (i.e. ≥ 4.3)  or confer a high level of d istress in interactions with research study 
staff, they will be referred to American Psychosocial Oncology Society (APOS) Toll-Free 
HELPLINE - [PHONE_6512] (1 -866-APOS -4-HELP) .  We have chosen this method 
because women will be selected from all over the [LOCATION_002]. APOS's Helpline is a 
national resource to help people with cancer and their caregivers find emotional support 
in their own communities.  This is a referral program  that is part of the Cancer Support 
Helpline® (affiliated with the Cancer Suppo rt Community)  and connects cancer patients, 
their caregivers and advocacy organizations with psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, 
social workers, and counselors skilled in the management of cancer -related distress. If 
Helpline counselors cannot find local  support services, and there is an immediate need 
for help, a Helpline mental health counselor can provide short -term emotional support by

accepted Mon -Fri 9 am - 8 pm ET .  
There is also a small risk to individuals’ privacy when using the mHealth app but this will 
be minimized by [CONTACT_311240], above.  
Finally, for those participating in the optional blood sample collection, pricking the finger 
for the blood sam ple may cause some minor discomfort. Additionally, t he risks of taking 
blood include pain, a bruise at the point where the blood is taken, redness and swelling 
of the collection site and infection, and a rare risk of fainting. The risk of fainting could be  
elevated if a participant is already  feeling faint or dizzy. They will be instructed to  delay 
collecting the blood sample until they are feeling better  if this is the case . 
Participants are permitted to refuse to participate in any aspect of the research and may 
withdraw from the study at any point, for any reason without penalty.

Feasibility of recruiting subjects for Phase 1.  We will use the Army of Women © to 
recruit survivors. Given the large number of survivors in the database and the fact that no 
on-site lab visits are required, we do not anticipate recruitment to be a problem. We 
believe we should be able to recruit participants for the other stakeholde r groups relatively 
easily through NU resources including RHLCC and the Center for Community Health in 
addition to the PI’s and Co -I’s professional networks.  
Feasibility of recruiting subjects  for Phase [ADDRESS_383164] sent to members of the Army of Women©, an online initiative that 
connects breast cancer researchers with women who are willing to participate in research. 
The database currently consists of ≥375,000 women and men. Of these, ~30% (112,500) 
self-report a breast cancer history.  This means we only need to recruit (0.2%) of these 
women.  
We are confident sample recruitment through the Army of Women© is feasible, based on 
my prior experience recruiting and retaining a much larger sample. In our prior study, we  
had 2,[ADDRESS_383165]  within 12 hours of recruitment initiation and 
recruitment was halted due to capacity limitations. Of that   number, 1,631 (64%) 
responded to screening and qualified to participate. I randomized 500 of those women to 
wear a ccelerometers for 7 consecutive days. Only 4 refused to wear the device.  At 
baseline and follow -up, 1,527 women (94%) completed more than half of the on -line 
questionnaires. Valid accelerometer data were obtained from 442 (89%) women at 
baseline; 370 (83. 7%) of those women also had valid data at 6 month follow -up. Reasons 
for missing accelerometer data at baseline and follow -up, respectively, were: did not wear 
(n=36 and n=40), insufficient valid wear time (n=8 and n=17), accelerometer 
malfunctioned (n=5 a t both), lost in mail or by [CONTACT_3445] (n=4 and n=5) and submerged 
in water (n=1).   
If we are not able to sufficiently meet our recruitment goals using the Army of Women©, 
additional NU resources (e.g. RHLCC and the C enter for Community Health), on -line

accrued.  
Phase  1.  In phase 1, we plan to recruit breast cancer survivors  up to [ADDRESS_383181] cancer 
survivors, a subgroup (n=30) will participate in interviews and the full sample (n=100) has 
the potential to participate in the app development sessions and field test. A total of 20 -
30 experts (n=10 -15) (n=10 -15) will be recruited  for interviews.   
Phase 2.  For the pi[INVESTIGATOR_52393], we will accrue [ADDRESS_383182] cancer survivors. 
Approximately 50% of these will be assigned to the buddy condition. As such we will 
accrue 128 buddies. We anticipate 80% of these “buddies” (n=102) will a gree to 
participate in the optional questionnaire assessments. For the post -intervention 
interviews, we plan to accrue up to [ADDRESS_383183] s’ privacy interests.  
Each participant will be randomly assigned an identification number to ensure 
confidentiality of data. This will be the only way of matching data with a specific person. 
Nitro Study Tracker will be the only place where the ID will appear with the participant’s 
name [CONTACT_311265]. This database will only be accessible by [CONTACT_473]. 
This electronic database will house participant contact [CONTACT_311254] a 
secured, password -protected network, accessible only by [CONTACT_473] .  
To ens ure the integrity of the data collected from study participants several procedures 
will be implemented. All personnel involved in data collection will be thoroughly trained in 
all assessment methods thus ensuring consistent applications of procedures and 
measurement consistency across participants.  All questionnaire assessment  data will be 
automatically saved in the secured, password protected RedCap system and will be 
downloaded to a password protected network folder protected ensuring access only by 
[CONTACT_473]. Any hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_311193]. All raw data will be de -

in the PI’s laboratory. Files containing identifying information obt ained for purposes of 
tracking participants and monitoring of subject payments are kept in a locked file in a 
locked office separate from study related data. Data will only be linked to identifying 
information through a study ID. Under no circumstances wil l individually identifiable data 
be released to anyone without the written consent of the subject. Results will be reported 
as group findings only. In the past we have found that all of these procedures are effective 
at reducing risk for study participants . 
Issues related to data integrity will be discussed on a weekly basis as a recurring agenda 
item in the weekly project meeting to ensure constant monitoring of our data integrity.

Modules.  
Procedures Specific to Phase 1. All interviews  and telephone/web -based  app 
development sessions  will be digitally recorded  whenever possible ; digital files will be 
stored on a password -secured network drive. Only participants’ first names will be used 
during any recorded sessions and participants will have  the option of using a “fake” name 
[CONTACT_311266]. Regardless, all r ecordings will be transcribed verbatim and de -identified. 
Recordings will be destroyed at the end of the study. Upon download, all data obtained 
via cellphone, will be de -identified and only be linked to participant via study ID number.  
Procedures Specific to Phase 2. RedCap does require an e -mail address to send the 
survey link to participants. Thus, data will be temporarily linked to individuals’ e -mail 
addresses and first names which may be included in the e -mail for personalization 
purposes. However, these links will be removed after completion of the questionnaires 
and these data will then only be linked to the  participant’s identification number. Upon 
download, all data obtained via cellphone, will be de -identifed and only be linked to 
participant via study ID number.

Regardl ess, all r ecordings will be transcribed verbatim and de -identified. Recordings will

time for any reason.  
For the app field study, participants may increase their PA compared to their usual level 
of PA, although they will be explicitly told this is not the purpose of the field test. Engaging 
in a PA program when one has been sedentary for a considerable period  of time incurs 
some risk of injury such as l muscle soreness, strains, aggravation of arthritic conditions, 
etc. However, serious physical injury is considered unlikely.  Participants will be 
instructed to notify study investigators immediately if they exp erience any adverse effects 
of using the app.   
Phase 2. Engaging in a PA program when one has been sedentary for a considerable 
period of time incurs some risk of injury such as l muscle soreness, strains, aggravation

order to reduce and/or prevent any physical harm or injury subjects will gradually 
increase their PA. Additionally, each participation will be required to pass a screening 
test or receive medical approva l prior to enrollment to ensure PA is appropriate.  To make

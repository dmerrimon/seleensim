Protocol Title:  A Phase I/II Randomized,  Double -Masked, Multicenter Clinical 
Trial Designed to Evaluate the Safety and Exploratory Efficacy of 
SF0166 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_86143] i n the Treatment of Diabetic 
Macular Edema  
Investigational 
Product: 
 SF0166 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_86143] (SF0166)  
Active  Ingredient:  SF0166 ( αvβ3 antagonists ) 
Number of 
Investigative Sites:  Approximately  10 
Investigative Site 
Locations:  US 
Number  of Subjects:  Approximately  40 (20 in each arm)  
Duration of 
Treatment:  28 days  
Study Population:  Male and female subjects, aged 18 or older, with diabetic 
macular edema (i.e., retinal thickening secondary to type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus with DME with central subfield thickness  
≥325 microns ( μm) on spectral domain optical coherence 
tomography  [OCT]) and no treatment with anti -vascular 
endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) therapy within up to 6 0 days of 
study entry  in the study eye  
Objective(s):  To evaluate the safety and exploratory efficacy of SF0166 topi[INVESTIGATOR_216285] & 
Methodology:  This is a prospective, randomized, double -masked multicenter, 
Phase I/II clinical study  in which approximately  40 eligible 
subjects with active DME will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms  in a 1:1 ratio as follows:  
• SF0166 2.5% low dose twice daily ( BID) 
• SF0166 5.0% high dose BID  
 Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_216299] -corrected visual acuity 
(BCVA) using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) testing (<40 letters versus ≥40 letters at Visit 1 –  
Screening/Randomization).  
 
Eligibility and all site -related treatment decisions will be made 
based on Investigator assessment of OCT. All OCT images will also be reviewed by a central reading facility; however, eligibility 
is based on the Investigator’s assessment at the time the 
SCIFLUOR LIFE SCIENCES, INC.    PAGE [ADDRESS_259892]-treatment 
follow -up period. All study subjects will return for examination 
every 2 weeks for 8 weeks  (2 months).  
 Clinica l assessments will include slit -lamp examination, 
intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement, BCVA, OCT, fluorescein angiography  (FA), and fundus photography. Adverse 
events (AEs) will be recorded at all study visits.  
 Rescue therapy with a VEGF inhibitor can be administered to any study subject who experiences a significant decrease in BCVA, defined  as BCVA loss of > 7 letters from  baseline  (Visit 1 
– Screening/Randomization) , accompanied by [CONTACT_216300] > 75μm as compared to the 
previous study visit , as assessed by [CONTACT_737].   
 Potential study participants will be asked to sign an informed consent document prior to screening. O nce it is determined that 
all eligibility criteria have been met, subjects will be randomized to 1 of the 2 treatment arms. All study subjects and site staff will be mas ked to the treatment assignment . 
 
The safety and exploratory efficacy of SF0166 will be evaluated over the course of the study.  Since this is Phase I/II clinical 
study , no formal hypothes es testing is planned; descriptive 
statistics will be used to summarize the study outcomes.

CONFIDENTIAL   INTRODUCTION  5.0
Diabetic m acular edema is the result of breakdown of the blood- retinal barrier and/or 
insufficient activity of the retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_216289], 
and is a sight -threatening condition common in diabetic retinopathy . There is 
extensive evidence that angiogenic cytokines (e.g., VEGF) and inflammatory cytokines are involved in the development of DME. It is widely thought that these cytokines are responsible for the accumulation of fluid within and below the retina (Feng 2013, Funatsu 2009, Funk 2009, Kaneda 2011, Noma 2006, and Noma 2011).  
 
Currently available treatments for DME include macular grid laser photocoagulation, 
anti-VEGF agents, and corticosteroids; though, none of these treatments is fully 
satisfactory (Ozkaya 2013). Laser photocoagulation is generally palliative, and may take many months to develop a therapeutic effect. Anti -VEGF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_216290], and some patients do not respond to these treatments. Intravitreal corticosteroid therapy can ca use catar act and increased IOP with 
long-term treatment, and also is not effecti ve in all patients (Sarao 2014 and Shamsi 
2013).  
 SF0166 is intended to address the current limitations in the treatment of DME, which requires intravitreal injection every [ADDRESS_259900] on the ability for the treatment to get to the back of the eye. Activity of SF0166 in VEGF -driven models appears similar to anti -VEGF biologics. M oreover, SF0166 also 
blocks angiogenic signaling driven by [CONTACT_211678] ( platelet -derived and 
fibroblast growth factor), so clin ical efficacy could exceed that of marketed drugs that 
only target VEGF.  
 Based on the pre- clinical information, it is expected that the benefits of SF0166 
outweigh the risks of its use.  
 
 ETHICS  6.0
This clinical study will be conducted in accordance with the principles of the 
Declaration of Helsinki, in compliance with the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E6 GC P Consolidated Guideline, and other applicable 
regulations. The Investigator and personnel will conduct the clinical study in compliance with the protocol. The Investigator will ensure that all personnel involved in the conduct of the study are qualified t o perform their assigned responsibilities 
through relevant education, training, and experience.  
 
SCIFLUOR LIFE SCIENCES, INC.    PAGE [ADDRESS_259901] be approved by [CONTACT_14498]/Institutional Review Board (IEC/IRB). The Investigator must provide documentation of the IEC/IRB approval to the Sponsor. The approval must be dated and must identify the applicable protocol, amendments (if any), informed consent form, applic able recruiting materials, written information for the subject, and subject 
compensation. The IEC/IRB must be provided with a copy of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB), any periodic safety updates, and all other information as required by [CONTACT_13308]/or the IEC/IRB. At the end of the study, the Investigator will notify the IEC/IRB about the study’s completion. The IEC/IRB must also be notified if the study is terminated prematurely. Finally, the Investigator will report to the IEC/IRB on the progres s of the study at intervals stipulated by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB.  
 Voluntary informed consent will be obtained from every subject (and/or legal representative, as applicable) prior to the initiation of any screening or other study -
related procedures. The Investigator  should have a defined process for obtaining 
consent. Specifically, the Investigator, or designee, will explain the clinical study to each potential subject and the subject must indicate voluntary consent by [CONTACT_216306]. The subject must be provided an 
opportunity to ask questions of the Investigator, and if required by [CONTACT_1295], other qualified personnel. The Investigator must provide the subject with a copy of the consent form written in a language the subject understands.  
 The consent document must meet all applicable local laws and will provide subjects with information regarding the purpose, procedures, requirements, and restrictions of the study, along with any known risks and potential benefits associated with the IP , 
the available compensation, and the established provisions for maintaining 
confidentiality of personal protected health information. Subjects will be told about the voluntary nature of participation in the study. Subjects will be provided with contact [CONTACT_216307]. The subject also will be told that their records may be accessed by [CONTACT_216308] -designated personnel. The Investigator must 
keep the original , signed copy of the consent and must provide a duplicate copy to 
each subject.  
 
 PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS  7.[ADDRESS_259902] be 
approved by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB prior to implementation; except when required to mitigate immediate safety risks or when the changes involve only logistical or administrative revisions. Amendments may necessitate that the informed consent and other study -
related material be revised. If the consent form is revised, all subjects currently enrolled in the study may be required by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC to sign the approved, revised informed consent form.

The site will confirm all IP  shipments received from the sponsor within the I WRS. 
Details of this process are outlined in a separate manual. Upon confirmation, the shipment will show as par t of the site’s IP stock.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_259915]’s anonymity is maintained throughout the course of the study. In particular, the Investigator must keep an enrollment log with confidential identifying information that corresponds to the subject numbers and initials of each study participant. At the end of the study, the Sponsor will collect a copy of the enrollment log without any identifying subject information. All documents submitted to the Sponsor will identify the subjects exclusively by [CONTACT_13305]. No other personally identifying information should be transmitted to the Sponsor, including subject initials.  
 The intent of masking is to limit the occurrence of conscious and unconscious bias in the conduct and interpretation of the clinical study. Bias could arise from the influence that the knowledge of a specific treatment assignment may have on the recruitment of subjects, their subsequent care, the assessment of endpoints, the handling of 
SCIFLUOR LIFE SCIENCES, INC.    PAGE [ADDRESS_259916] the masking of 
the study personnel at the site and at the Sponsor. The Sponsor  involved in 
reporting, obtaining, and/or reviewing the clinical data will not be aware of the specific dose being administered.   For purposes of this study, the subject, Principal Investigator (PI), an d site staff will 
be masked to the IP dose.  Investigators, site staff members, and sponsor personnel 
directly involved with the study will not be aware of the randomized dose group for each randomized subject. In the event of a medical emergency where the knowledge of dose group is required, the Investigator will have the ability to learn the dose group in order to properly treat the medical emergency , but should only exercise this ability 
when absolutely necessary.  
 The masked site personnel must coordinate all study activities as necessary to 
protect masking and minimize bias during the study . This level of masking will be 
maintained throug hout the conduct of the study.

 SAFETY  12.0
12.1 Safety Outcomes 
The safety parameters for the study include:  
• BCVA  
• Slit-lamp findings  
• Fundus findings  
• IOP  
• AEs 
SCIFLUOR LIFE SCIENCES, INC.    PAGE [ADDRESS_259926] at any time , if in his/her 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] , it is in the best interest of the subject ’s safety.  
 
12.2 Safety Definitions  
• AE: Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an IP  in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.   
• Adverse Reaction (AR): any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a 
subset of all suspected adverse reactions where there is reason to conclude 
that the drug caused the event.  
• Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR): Any AE for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of Investigational 
New Drug ( IND) safety reporting,  “reasonable possibility” means there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. A SAR implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse 
reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
• Unexpected:  An AE or SAR  is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has 
been observed; or, if an Investigator’s Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk informati on described in the general investigational 
plan or elsewhere in the current application.   
• Life-threatening: An AE or SAR is considered “life- threatening” if, in the view of 
either the Investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse 
reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Serious Adverse Event ( SAE) : Any AE or suspected adverse reaction 
occurring at any dose that:  
o Results in death.  
o Is life -threatening.  
o Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions.  
o Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
o Prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
o Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
o Is a significant medical event (i.e., one that may jeopardize the subject 
or may require intervention to prevent one or more of the other 
outcomes listed above).  
• Non-serious AE: Any AE that does not meet the definitions for SAEs as 
described above.  
 
SCIFLUOR LIFE SCIENCES, INC.    PAGE 28 
PROTOCOL SF0166- C-001 VERSION 3  EFFE CTIVE 22-NOV -2016 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  12.3 Classification, Relationship, and Intensity  
Each AE will be classified as serious or non- serious using the definitions provided 
above.  
The severity of each ae will be classified as mild, moderate, or severe using the 
following definitions:  
• Mild: An AE is m ild if the subject is aware of but can easily tolerate the sign or 
symptom.  
• Moderate: An AE is moderate if the sign or symptom results in discomfort 
significant enough to cause interference with the subject’s usual activities.  
• Severe: An AE is severe if the sign or symptom is incapacitating and results in the subject’s inability to work or engage in their usual activities.  
The Investigator  will review each event and assess its relationship to use of IP 
(unrelated, unlikely, possibly, probably, definitely). The AE will be assessed using the 
following definitions:  
• Unrelated  
o Event occurring before dosing.  
o Event or intercurrent illness due wholly to factors other than IP  use. 
• Unlikely  
o Poor temporal relationship with IP  use. 
o Event easily explained by [CONTACT_1130]’s cl inical state or other factors.  
• Possible  
o Reasonable temporal relationship with IP  use. 
o Event could be explained by [CONTACT_1130]’s clinical state or other factors.  
• Probable  
o Reasonable temporal relationship with IP  use. 
o Likely to be known reaction to agent or chemical group, or predicted by 
[CONTACT_25046].  
o Event cannot easily be explained by [CONTACT_1130]’s clinical state or other 
factors.  
• Definite  
o Distinct temporal relationship with IP  use. 
o Known reaction to agent or chemical group, or predicted by [CONTACT_216316].  
o Event cannot be explained by [CONTACT_1130]’s clinical state or other factors.

• Additional relevant information after initial reporting is to be entered into the eCRF and on paper SAE form as soon as the data become available.  
• Document any changes to concomitant medications on the appropriate eCRFs . 
The Investigator must also report all SAEs to the IRB/IEC, according to the 
institution’s requirements.

Dependent upon the individual circumstances (i.e., medical emergency), the code may be broken prior to contact [CONTACT_216317]. However, the Sponsor does not anticipate the need for this as all subjects will be on active treatment at varying dose levels. If unmasking does occur without Sponsor consultation, the s tudy Sponsor must be informed of all 
cases in which the code was broken and of the circumstances involved. Additionally, the study Sponsor may be required to unmask the information in order to fulfill expedited regulatory reporting requirements.  
 
12.7 Follow -Up of Safety Information 
The Investigator is responsible for adequate and safe medical care of subjects during the study and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up 
procedures are maintained after the study. The Investigator should provide the study 
Sponsor with any new safety information (which includes new AEs and changes to previously reported AEs) that may affect the safety evaluation of the IP. Any

CONFIDENTIAL   APPENDICES 15.0
15.1 BCVA (ETDRS)  
The site staff should follow  their standard procedures for conducting BCVA using  
ETDRS  testing . The general procedure is as follows:  
 
Overview  
1. BCVA at a single site should be done consistently throughout the study using 
the same equipment, lighting conditions etc.  
2. BCVA should be performed prior to instillation of any drops to dilate or anesthetize the eye and prior to any examination that requir es contact [CONTACT_216319], including the measurement of IOP.  
3. Subjective refraction, using standard ETDRS methods, should be performed 
prior to measurement of BCVA and the appropriate correction worn in a trial 
frame.  
4. The subject may be seated or may stand an d the chart should be at eye level.  
5. All eyes are first tested at 4 meters (m) including those that could not be 
refracted at 4m. Note: for eyes refracted at 1 meter, the additional +0.75 D 
sphere should be subtracted from the spherical correction before testing vision at 4m.  
6. The right eye (OD) should be is tested first using Chart 1 then the left eye (OS) 
is tested using Chart 2.  
7. Each chart should remain hidden from view until the eye in question is to be 
examined.  
8. If less than 20 letters are read with either eye at 4m the eye(s) with the reduced acuity is tested at 1m.  
ETDRS Scoring  
1. At the end of the test count up the number of letters read correctly by [CONTACT_216320]. 
2. If 1-meter testing was not required, then add [ADDRESS_259935] BCVA betwee n 78 and 25 
letters, inclusive, in the study eye at the screening/randomization visit using ETDRS 
testing . There is no visual acuity requirement for the non- study eye.

CONFIDENTIAL  Lens  
Opacity  
0 No opacity in the lens  
1 Any opacity in the lens  
  
 
15.3 IOP  
IOP will be measured using a Tonopen or Goldmann applanation. The same method 
of measurement should be used throughout the study. However, if Tonopen is 
primar ily used and IOP measures ≥25 mmHg during a visit, the measurement should 
be repeated for confirmation using Goldmann applanation according to the 
Investigator’s standard procedure. All pressures will be recorded in mmHg.  
 
15.[ADDRESS_259936]  (Heidelberg Engineering Inc., Carlsbad, CA [ZIP_CODE])  or Cirrus  HD-OCT (Carl 
Zeiss  Meditec, Inc., Dublin, C A [ZIP_CODE] ). The subject’s pupil should be dilated and the 
fast macular thickness map protocol should be utilized. This method obtains data 
from 6 radial line scans over a diameter of 6 millimeter ( mm). Both the average 
center subfield thickness and the macular volume are  of interest in the  study. The 
OCT results will be read by [CONTACT_11219] a central reading  facility.   
 
15.[ADDRESS_259937] Ophthalmoscopy/Dilated  Fundus Examination 
Indirect ophthalmoscopy/dilated fundus examination will be performed according to 
the Investigator’s standard protocol . Areas to be assessed include vitreous, fundus, 
optic nerve  (including cup to disc ratio) , macula and choroid, vessels and peripheral 
retina.  An assessment of normal or abnormal will be made for each area. The 
specific finding for areas that are abnormal will be recorded.  
 
15.6 Fluorescein Angiography  
Fluorescein angiography (FA) will be performed according to the Investigator’s 
standard procedure, by [CONTACT_216321] a peripheral vein of the 
arm of the subject.  
 
15.7 Fundus Photography  
Fundus photographs with a Zeiss FF450 (or comparable) camera will be taken before and after FA, for visits with FA completed . For all other visits, photographs will be 
taken once during i ndirect ophthalmoscopy/dilated fundus examination. Images will 
be uploaded to ShareFile and printed for filing in the subject source documents.

 Title of the Study: Technology- Based Objective Measures for Ga it and Postural Assessment 
in Parkinson Disease Patients with Orthosta tic Hypotension: Feasibility and Effect-Size 
Finding Study. 
 
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_164675], MD, MSc 
  
Funding: Investigator-initiated st udy sponsored by [CONTACT_164687] :  
Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a frequent  and disabling complication of Parkinson’s disease 
(PD), with an estimated prevalence of  30-50% [1-3], and a significant impact on the quality of life (QoL). 
OH may be associated with potentially serious compli cations, such as postural in stability, gait impairment, 
and falls, which directly or indir ectly (e.g., fractures) represent the most frequent cause of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_164676] [4-6]. 
The lack of objective measures fo r the assessment of OH disability, however , represents a clinical challenge 
in the management of this comp lex hemodynamic condition. Although different scales have been developed 
for the assessment of orthostatic intolerance in PD [7], their application is limited by [CONTACT_164688] “classic” OH symptoms, namely dizziness, lightheadedness, or “feeling 
like you might black out while standing” [7]. Up to 50% of OH patients may complain symptoms such as 
weakness, vertigo, and difficulty concentrating, which may be errone ously diagnosed, underestimated, and 
thus undertreated. In a recent study, we demonstrated that OH might cause a 3-fold risk of gait impairment 
and functional disability in PD, re gardless of the presence/absence of  postural lightheadedness [8]. 
 
Clinical assessment and monitoring of OH symptoms  relies on inaccurate and highly subjective clinical 
measures based on quantification of symptoms that ar e frequently ambiguous and not specific. In a recent 
study where we assessed the impact of autonomic dysfunction in 121 consecutive PD patients, OH was 
independently associated with gait impairment and f unctional disability, regardless of the symptomatic or 
asymptomatic status [8]. These data support the hypoth esis that clinical scales currently available for 
quantifying the severity of OH are not adequate for ca pturing the full complexity of this frequent yet under-
recognized PD complication. 
 
Technology-Based Objective Measures ( TOMs) 
The introduction of TOMs in medical ca re represents one of the most pr omising aspects of modern medicine 
[14]. TOMs may quantify the severity of PD moto r symptoms and increase the diagnostic accuracy of 
different challenging conditions. In  addition, the growing access to high-speed internet connection may 
facilitate continuous communication and remote assess ment of data collected via TOMs during normal 
activities of daily living, providing accurate monitoring of patients in their home environment. Possible 
advantages will include the reduction of placebo effect due  to in-clinic evaluations, higher sensitivity in the 
accuracy of outcome measures, and a substantial decr ease in sample size and duration of clinical trials. 
 
Future Directions 
Currently, TOMs application in clinical trials is limited by [CONTACT_164689]. Preliminary 
data collected in this study will prove the feasibility  of using TOMs for assessing the effects of anti-OH

 treatment, informing the design of a major proposal aimi ng to evaluating the beneficial effects of an early 
treatment for the prevention of OH complications in PD. 
 
Experimental Design and Patient Population 
The main objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using TOMs in the assessment of OH-
associated postural stability, both “in-clinic” and “at-home”. Twelve consecutive PD patients with OH 
about to start pharmacological treatment with vas opressor agents prescribed by [CONTACT_164690] (Protokinetic Zeno Walkway) before a nd after treatment with 
vasopressor agents (Droxidopa). Patients will also us e wearable motion sensors (WMS) (Apple Watch® - 
Apple, Cupertino, CA, [LOCATION_003]) for monitoring their normal activities of daily living. Gait analysis will 
measure the improvement in stride length and velocity , double-support time (percentage of time spent with 
both feet in contact [CONTACT_98544]), and postural sway on the anteroposterior and lateral axis, both at 
baseline (before treatment with Droxidopa) and after 6 weeks of therapy (2 weeks of dose-titration plus 4 
weeks of maintenance therapy).. Data collected by [CONTACT_164691]  (a) before and (b) after treatment with Droxidopa, 
will be correlated with changes in conventional scales of postural stability  (Tinetti balance scale) [10], OH 
questionnaire (OHQ) [7], quality of life measures (39 -Item Parkinson's disease questionnaire, PDQ-39)[11], 
and cognitive functions (Cambridge  neuropsychological test automa ted battery – CANTAB - Connect 
Research, Cambridge Cognition Ltd., [LOCATION_006] - and CERAD-NAB).[12, 13]  
 
Our central hypothesis  is that TOMs will result in higher de tection power and lower variability than 
conventional clinical assessments, also minimizing in terferences due to the placebo effect. If confirmed, 
these findings will improve the treatment in PD by [CONTACT_164692], instead of standard subjective outcome 
measures.  
 
AIMS OF THE STUDY 
The two aims of this study are:  
Aim #1: To evaluate the feasibility and effect-size of using gait and postural tests to quantify OH 
related postural stability during in-clinic evaluations: 
PD patients with newly diagnosed OH (n = 12) will be assessed at baseline and after 1 month of anti-OH 
treatment with the following tests: 
 
Clinical tests: OHQ score (OH Sy mptom Assessment, OHSA and Orthos tatic Hypotension Daily Activities 
Scale, OHDAS), Tinetti score, PDQ-39 score. 
Gait analysis: stride length, single leg stance time, dynamic stability index, and gait velocity 
Postural analysis: postural sway on the X and Y-axis. 
 
Hypothesis : Gait analysis and Postural analysis will accurate ly capture changes in gait and postural stability 
associated with OH treatment, with higher sensitivity a nd lower variability than standard clinical tests. 
 
Aim #[ADDRESS_191111] size of using WMS 
 to quantify OH related postural instability during at-home activities of daily living Gait and postural stability will be evaluated in the home environment by [CONTACT_164693]: 
Version 4.0 Lundbeck  TOMS OH  Page 3 of 9  31Jul2020  
 Clinical assessment: Self-assessed clinical diary ( OHDAS-based score) evaluati ng the subjective sensation 
of postural instability and number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_164677].  
WMS assessment : WMS (Apple Watch®) evaluating functional pa rameters, namely a) number of steps per 
day; b) number of hours of standing per day; c) total calories and active calories per day. 
 
Hypothesis : TOMs will provide an accurate measure of f unctional parameters in the home setting, thus 
allowing an indirect measure of the patients’ quality of life, with higher sensitivity and lower variability 
than self-reported clinical diaries.

  Study Assessment/Procedures 
Screening Visit: The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a member of the study team will explain the purpose, procedure, potential risks 
and benefits of this study, obtain the informed consen t, and screen patients for Inclusion/Exclusion criteria. 
 
Visit 1: This evaluation will be performed at least [ADDRESS_191112] optim ized level of motor function. BP assessment, as per 
autonomic laboratory protocol, will be performed with a beat-to-beat BP monitor (Caretaker 4, Caretaker, 
VA, [LOCATION_003]) and confirmed by [CONTACT_164695] (HEM-7200 Omron Healthcare, Japan) 
placed at heart level on the left arm, evaluating patie nts in the following conditions: a) sitting in a chair 
Version 4.[ADDRESS_191113]; b) after a minimum of [ADDRESS_191114]; and c) after 1 and 3 minutes 
of standing. These measurements will serve to (1) conf irm the diagnosis of OH, and (2) evaluate for the 
presence of SH, defined as systolic BP ≥ 150 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547] 
[19]. Arm-cuff BP measurements will be performed with  the upper arm positioned at the heart level with 
the feet flat on the floor. Patients will also receive training to self-monitoring BP with automated arm-cuff 
sphygmomanometer, which will be provided at Visit 1, and will serve to monitor BP during Droxidopa 
titration plan.  
 
Clinical Assessments: Motor sever ity as per the MDS-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS 
UPDRS) [20]; OH symptoms severity as per the full OHQ (OHSA and OHDAS) scale [7]; quality of life 
as per the PD questionnaire (PDQ-39) [11]; Cogni tive assessment as per the Cambridge automated 
neuropsychological test battery (CANT AB) [12] and CERAD-NAB [13].  
 
Clinical Diary: Patient will be instructed to score  the severity of the OH-related epi[INVESTIGATOR_164680] a day before starting titration with droxidopa, 
1 day after V2 and 1 day after V3; using a self-assessed clinical diary based on the OHDAS (a section of 
the OHQ assessing the impact of OH symptoms on standing and walking).  
Gait Assessments (average of two measurements): In orde r to evaluate variables of interest (stride length, 
single leg stance time, dynamic stability index, and gait velocity), patients will be assessed walking on the 
[ADDRESS_191115]. Patients will be in structed to “walk from the mark (red tape) before 
the mat to the mark after the mat, turn around and wa lk back”. After a preliminary review for acquisition 
errors, the data will downloaded into a Matlab-based so ftware platform prepared ad-hoc for this study 
(Matlab, Mathworks, CA, [LOCATION_003]) by [CONTACT_164696] ([CONTACT_164704]).  
 Postural Assessments (average of two measurements): In  order to evaluate variables of interest (postural 
sway on the X and Y-axis, as measured by [CONTACT_164697] X and Y range), patients will be 
asked to perform a modified Clinical Test of Sensor y Interaction on Balance. Patients will stand on the mat 
for 30 seconds under the 2 following conditions: eyes open/r est and eyes closed/rest, with their feet 1”-2” 
apart and arms at their side. For the eyes open condition,  he/she will be asked to focus on a point in front 
of him/her at eye level to control for visual distracti ons. Data will be collected a nd stored into the software 
platform described above. 
 
WMS Assessment: Patients will be provide d an Apple Watch® with dedicated app (e.g., the Activity app®), 
able to measure number of hours of standing per day,  and total calories and active calories per day. The 
Apple Watch® will be connected with an iPhone and w ill be given to each subject together with dedicated 
instructions to fill out the OH-related diary. More in details, patients will be instructed to charge the Apple 
Watch® and the iPhone® every night before going to be d, and to wear the watch the day after when they 
wake up. Total number of hours in which the patients w ill wear the watch will be counted at the end of the 
study, based on the data provided by [CONTACT_164698] h®. Data collected by [CONTACT_164699]® will be 
downloaded after the end of the study and will provide  information related to number of steps per day, 
number of hours of standing per day, and total calories and active calories per day.  
 
Version 4.0 Lundbeck  TOMS OH  Page 5 of 9  31Jul2020  
 Droxidopa Titration Plan 
Droxidopa will be started after 2 days of baseline da ta collection at the dosage of 100 mg 3 times a day 
(TID). Dose-optimization will be titrated over a 2-week  period in 100- mg TID increments every [ADDRESS_191116] one of the following criteria is met: 
- Self-rating score of 0 at the item 1 of the OHQ,  plus an increase in standing systolic BP ≥[ADDRESS_191117]-standing (and 3 hours after a Droxidopa 
dose). 
- Reaching the maximum permitted dosage of 600 mg TID. 
- Sustained BP >180 mmHg systolic or >110 mmHg di astolic while standing, sitting, or supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. 
 Visit 2: Patients will receive a complete BP assessment fo llowing the same procedure detailed in Visit 1 
(see above), and a standard neurological examination. Adverse events and side effects associated with 
Droxidopa treatment will also be addressed, adjusting the dosage of Droxidopa if needed. Technical issues 
related to the use of Apple Watch® will also be discussed, if present. 
 
Visit 3: This evaluation will be performed in the morning, at 8:[ADDRESS_191118] dose of dopaminergic medications, 4 w eeks after Visit 2. Patients will undergo a complete 
clinical, gait, postural and BP assessment, as per the protocol described in Visit 1.  
 
Data collected from Apple Watch®  will be downloaded and analyzed in three steps. (1) Each patient will 
receive a unique identification code for entry into th e computer database to ensu re patient confidentiality. 
By [CONTACT_3553] a semi-automated algorith m, the software will score the main  variables of interest. (2) Data 
recorded from the questionnaires will be logged (in a b lind fashion) in a REDCap database designed in 
consultation with [CONTACT_164705] (a pr ofessional biostatistician from [LOCATION_007] Un iversity) as per the need of data 
analysis. (3) The REDCap data file would be transferre d into SAS data file and combined with Matlab data 
for statistical analyses and report preparation. [CONTACT_164706] will process the data.

Data Analysis 
Aim #[ADDRESS_191120] size of gait and postural TOMs to quantify 
OH related postural instability during in-clinic evaluations 
Data will be described with appropriate summary m easures (mean and SD, or median and interquartile 
range) at Visit 1 (before Droxidopa treatment) and Vi sit 3 (after 4 weeks of Droxidopa maintenance 
therapy). Changes in the main clinical (PDQ-39, Ti netti, OHQ and related subscales), gait (stride length, 
single leg stance time, dynamic stability index, and ga it velocity) and postural (postural sway on the X and 
Y axis) outcomes will be compared between Visit [ADDRESS_191121]/ non parametric 
Wilcoxon signed rank test depending on the distribution of change outcome. Effect size (mean or median 
change and percent change) will be reported along w ith 95% confidence interval (CI). In addition, data 
collected with TOMs before and after treatment with  Droxidopa will be correlated with changes in the 
PDQ-39, OHQ, CANTAB and CERAD-NAB by [CONTACT_8477] s of the Pearson correlation/Spearman rank 
correlation analysis.  
 
Hypothesis : Gait analysis and Postural analysis will accurate ly capture changes in gait and postural stability 
associated with OH treatment, with higher sensitivity a nd lower variability than standard clinical tests. 
 
Aim #[ADDRESS_191122] size of using WMS to quantify OH related 
functional parameters during at-home activities of daily living 
Postural data collected from WMS (Apple Watch®) a nd evaluating: (1) Number of steps per day; (2) 
number of hours of standing per day; and (3) total cal ories and active calories per day, will be analyzed and 
compared with epi[INVESTIGATOR_164681] (OHDAS-based diary) postura l instability recorded during the 
follow-up period using a paired t-test/Wilcoxon signed ra nk test. In addition, we would also evaluate the 
changes from pre-baseline to post b aseline of subjective measure of pos tural stability and correlate with 
objective measures of postural stability using Pear son correlation/Spearman rank correlation analysis. 
Statistical analyses will be carried out using SAS 9.3. 
 
Hypothesis : WMS will provide an accurate measure of func tional parameters in the home setting, thus 
allowing an indirect measure of the patients’ quality of life, with higher sensitivity and lower variability 
than self-reported clinical diaries.  
Missing data on the scores will be handled by a two- step approach. Less than 20% missing data on any 
variable for an individual will be imputed using the mean  of the final score of that question. Greater than 
20% missing data for any participant on any instrume nt will be handled by a multiple missing imputation 
approach. Missing data on BP related variables w ill be imputed using multiple missing imputation 
approach. 
 Sample Size Calculation : Given the exploratory nature of this pi [INVESTIGATOR_799], the sample size calculation is 
inevitably limited by [CONTACT_164700]. We used a study analyzing the effect of levodopa in PD with 
Version 4.0 Lundbeck  TOMS OH  Page 7 of 9  31Jul2020  
 a gait analysis [21], which reported a 30% improvement in the stride length (SD 31.3%), to pre-specify a 
threshold of minimal improvement of 10% between  baseline and follow-up. With these assumptions, we 
estimate that a sample of [ADDRESS_191123], with more than 80% power and at 5% level of significance (PASS 14 Power Analysis and 
Sample Size Software (2015). NCSS, LLC. Kays ville, Utah, [LOCATION_003], ncss.com/software/pass). 
 
Innovation 
Although TOMs are unanimously thoug ht to represent the future of me dical assessments, their routinely 
application is limited by [CONTACT_164701]. 
The current proposal will provide more sensitive sta ndards for the assessment of OH complications in PD, 
with the main innovation of developi[INVESTIGATOR_164682] g an innovative outcome measure based on a mobile 
(WMS) and in-clinic (gait analysis) technology. 
 
 
DATA STORAGE AND CONFIDENTIALITY:  
All records from this study will be maintained in a secure setting. We will be using REDCap (Research 
Electronic Data Capture) as the secure web-based appli cation to store data for this research study. Records 
will not have any patient health information (PH I) associated with them. These records will be kept 
indefinitely to allow for re-analysis of data, if needed. The data will never be accessible without a secure 
password.  
 
RISKS AND BENEFITS: 
This study is considered more than minimal risk  as per FDA guidelines [19], and involves the use of 
Droxidopa, a FDA approved drug for Parkinson Di sease and Orthostatic Hypotension and evaluation of 
Technology objective measures. It does not involve the u se of any other invasive procedure, but the patients 
would not normally have these evaluations as part of th eir standard PD clinic visits. Subjects could risk 
falling while completing the walking assessment, though th ey will not be asked to walk beyond their daily 
norm and a researcher will walk beside the patient as they perform the walking assessment. By [CONTACT_164702], we will be able to determin e an objective evaluation of postural stability and risk 
of falling for these patients. Patient could also present side effects from using Droxidopa (Patient Brochure 
attached). The adequate dose titration and potential side effects will be explain by [CONTACT_458] 
[INVESTIGATOR_164683]. The information gather ed from this study will provide a basic understanding 
how technology objective measures (TOMs) are a more reliable measure of OH than compared to standard 
subjective measures. If confirmed, these findings will im prove the treatment in PD by [CONTACT_164703], instead 
of standard subjective outcome measures. 
 
PATIENT COSTS/PAYMENT 
There will be no cost to participants for participating in this study.  The patients will not receive payment 
for their participation in this study.

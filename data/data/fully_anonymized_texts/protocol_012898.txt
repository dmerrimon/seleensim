STUDY DESIGN   
This randomized, double-blind, multi-center study will enroll approximately 200 children 24 to < 48 months of 
age, at screening. Subjects will be randomized (~65 subjects per group) at 1:1:1 ratio to receive two doses of 
either 1) a quadrivalent formulation of FluMist®. Strains included in the vaccine will be based on the World 
Health Organization (WHO) and Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC)
2017-2018 Northern Hemisphere recommendations and will include a replacement H1N1 strain (A/Slovenia/2903/2015) and A/New Caledonia/7/2014(H3N2), B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata-lineage), and 
B/Brisbane/60/2008 (B/Victoria-lineage); 2) a second quadrivalent formulation of FluMist. Strains included in 
the vaccine will be based on the 2015-[ADDRESS_198825]: A/Bolivia/559/2013 (H1N1), 
A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2), B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata-lineage), and B/Brisbane/60/2008 (B/Victoria-lineage); or 3) a trivalent formulation of FluMist. Strains included in the vaccine will be based on the strains recommended by [CONTACT_169945] 2015-2016 season: A/Bolivia/559/2013 (H1N1), A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2), and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata-lineage).
Subjects will be screened for the study within [ADDRESS_198826] ever received prior influenza vaccination (Yes/No). It is intended that 
approximately 50% of randomized subjects will not have been previously vaccinated. All subjects will receive 
an initial dose of investigational product at the site on Study Day 1. Subjects will receive a second dose on Study Day 28.
Nasal samples for evaluation of shedding will be obtained from each subject on Days 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 after Dose 
1 and on Days 2, 4 and 6 after Dose 2. Blood and nasal samples for the assessment of immune responses will be 
obtained on Day 1 prior to dosing, on Day 28 (prior to dosing) and on Day 56.
Safety evaluation will consist of the collection of solicited symptoms during the 14-day period after each dose, 
and AEs, SAEs, and concomitant medication use through the 28-day period post each dose. On Days 1 and 28, subjects’ legal representatives will be given a temperature log to record daily temperature during the [ADDRESS_198827] dosing. Four telephone contacts for safety follow-up will occur between Days 15-16, Days 21-23, Days 42-
44 and 48-50. 
The study will be conducted during the influenza “off-season” in the US. It is anticipated that enrollment will 
start around the beginning of June 2017. The duration of subject participation is approximately 3 to 4 months. After completion of the study all subjects will be offered and strongly encouraged to receive one or two doses 
(depending on their vaccination history) of an inactivated influenza vaccine approved for use in the US for the 
2017-[ADDRESS_198828] POPULATION   
Male and female children 24 months to < 48 months of age, at screening.
TREATMENT GROUPS AND REGIMENS   
Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_198829] Quadrivalent 2017-2018 formulation (approximately 65 subjects), FluMist Quadrivalent 2015-2016 formulation (approximately 65 subjects), or FluMist trivalent 2015-2016 formulation (approximately 65 subjects) by [CONTACT_24514].

8 of 90 Final Template Version 17.0STATISTICAL METHODS
Sample size:   
HAI Immunogenicity:
It is expected that for each analysis of immunogenicity, 90% of subjects will be evaluable. The resulting sample 
size of ~60 evaluable subjects per arm would produce a 95% confidence interval (CI) within 14 percentage 
points of the observed proportion of subjects seroconverting. An estimate of 40% for the proportion of subjects seroconverting was used for the purposes of CI calculations.
Assuming that the seroconversion rate in the A/Bolivia H1N1 strain (2015-2016 formulation) ranged from 10% 
to 40%, based on 25% of the rate difference, the sample size of 60 evaluable subjects per arm would result in approximately 80% power to detect a statistically significant difference in the seroconversion rate comparing the 
A/Bolivia H1N1 strain (2015-2016 formulation) to the replacement H1N1 strain selected for the 2017-2018 
vaccine formulation (A/Slovenia/2903/2015). The table below summarizes the study power based on various 
assumptions.

Shedding:
It is expected that for each analysis of shedding, 90% of subjects will be evaluable. The resulting sample size of 
~60 evaluable subjects per arm would produce a 95% CI within 15 percentage points of the observed proportion of subjects who shed. An estimate of 50% for the proportion of subjects shedding influenza vaccine virus was 
used for the purposes of sample size calculations, as this value was statistically conservative (ie, had the highest 
variability).
Statistical analyses:
Primary endpoint analysis:
The primary endpoint is the strain-specific HAI antibody seroconversion rates, defined as at least 4-fold increase 
from baseline through Day 28 and Day 56. The proportion of subjects who had seroconversion will be summarized at Days 28 and 56 visits by [CONTACT_169946]. Its corresponding 95% exact CI will be provided.   
The difference in proportion between the A/Bolivia H1N1 strain (2015-2016) and the replacement H1N1 strain

MEDI3250 02Jun2017; Final
9 of 90 Final Template Version 17.0selected for the 2017-2018 vaccine formulation will be tested by [CONTACT_125427]–Mantel–Haenszel (CMH) test 
adjusting for the prior flu vaccination status. If the number of subjects in any stratum is too small, Fisher’s exact test will be used without adjusting for the prior flu vaccination status. If it is evident that the proportion is confounded with some of other demographic and baseline disease characteristic variables, the confounding 
variables will be adjusted.
Secondary endpoint analyses:
Geometric mean titers (GMTs) and geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) of HAI antibody, neutralizing antibody, 
and nasal IgA will be summarized by [CONTACT_169947] 28 and 56 visits. Corresponding 95% CI will be calculated assuming log normal distribution. 
Using the results of the qRT-PCR method, the proportion of subjects who shed vaccine will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_3148], strain, and dose number based on the same method as for the primary analysis. The number of days of 
shedding will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_3148], strain, dose number, and baseline serostatus. The viral 
titer will be calculated by [CONTACT_4475], strain, dose number, and baseline serostatus. 
The strain-specific neutralizing antibody seroconversion rates ( ≥ 4-fold increase from baseline), and 
strain-specific nasal IgA increase ( ≥ 2-fold increase from baseline) at Days 28 and 56 visits will be summarized 
descriptively using the same method as for the primary endpoint.
Exploratory endpoint analyses:
Analyses of immune response will be conducted based on newly identified specific assays to characterize 
immune response.
Using the results of culture-based methods, the proportion of subjects who shed vaccine, the number of days of 
shedding, and the viral titer will be summarized using the same methods as described for secondary endpoint 
analyses.

common vaccine-preventable disease in the developed world. In humans, influenza illness is 
caused mainly by 2 types of viruses: influenza A, with multiple subtypes categorized by [CONTACT_169949], and influenza B, which circulates as 2 major antigenic lineages (Yamagata and Victoria). A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 are 
the [ADDRESS_198832] circulated and caused human disease since 1977 
(Kilbourne, 2006 ).
Uncomplicated influenza illness in healthy individuals is generally a self-limited febrile 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_169929] 3 to 7 days’ duration, sometimes with persistence of cough and malaise 
for several weeks. Influenza illness is characterized by [CONTACT_169950], myalgia, headache, malaise, chills, nonproductive cough, anorexia, sore throat, and rhinitis. Children may also have otitis media, croup, nausea, and vomiting. Complications of influenza include primary influenza viral pneumonia; exacerbation of 
underlying medical conditions such as cardiac or pulmonary disease, including asthma or 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and secondary bacterial infections such as pneumonia, sinusitis, or otitis. Young children can have febrile seizures or symptoms mimicking bacterial sepsis with high fevers. Rarely, influenza virus infection has been 
associated with encephalopathy, transverse myelitis, myositis, rhabdomyolysis, myocarditis, 
pericarditis, and, in children, Reye syndrome ( Fiore et al, 2007 ;Ramet et al, 2007 ).
1.[ADDRESS_198833] Quadrivalent (MEDI3250) Background
FluMist®Quadrivalent is an intranasally administered influenza vaccine that was developed 
as a successor to the trivalent seasonal vaccine, FluMist (also referred to as trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine [T/LAIV]). Refer to the current package insert for additional details (Appendix 10.4). 
The active agents of FluMist Quadrivalent consist of 2 cold adapted ( ca), 
temperature-sensitive ( ts), attenuated ( att) reassortant influenza strains of type A (ie, A/H1N1 
and A/H3N2), 1 ca/ts/att reassortant influenza strain of type B-Victoria, and 1 ca/ts/att
reassortant influenza strain of type B-Yamagata. The types A and B master donor viruses 
(MDVs), from which the reassortant strains are derived, were adapted to grow in primary chick kidney cells at 25°C by [CONTACT_169951]. During

lungs as well as the upper airways. Studies with FluMist Quadrivalent demonstrated that it 
was equally immunogenic, had similar replication kinetics, and conferred equally efficient protection following challenge with wild-type viruses.
A single- and repeat-dose toxicology study was conducted in ferrets to investigate the 
potential adverse effects of trivalent FluMist given [ADDRESS_198836] administered intranasally at Weeks 0, 4, and 14. This dosing regimen is in compliance with International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline M3, which recommends a toxicity study duration

study populations, including > 90,000 children and adolescents 6 weeks to 17 years of age 
and > 30,000 adults 18 to > [ADDRESS_198840] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_169930] (44%) and sore throat (26%) than placebo 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (27% and 17%, respectively), with a median event duration of 1 day regardless of 
treatment received. Other symptoms, including cough, headache, chills, muscle aches, and tiredness/weakness occurred less often and at similar rates between the treatment groups. 
Low-grade fever (temperature > 100ºF) occurred at a similarly low rate for FluMist and 
placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (1.3% and 1.5%, respectively).
The clinical development of FluMist Quadrivalent included 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], double-blind studies 
conducted in the [LOCATION_003], one in children and adolescents 2 to 17 years of age (MI-CP208;

14 of 90 Final Template Version 17.02,312 subjects) and one in adults 18 through 49 years of age (MI-CP185; 1,800 subjects), 
both of which demonstrated that the immune responses generated by [CONTACT_169952] [ADDRESS_198841] was initially 
approved for use in healthy individuals 5 to 49 years of age; however, the age indication was expanded to include children 24 to 59 months of age prior to the 2007-2008 influenza season. For this study population, there are no risks anticipated other than those described in the 
Package Insert (Appendix 4).
The 2016-[ADDRESS_198842] Quadrivalent Package Insert (Appendix 9.4) provides the most 
current safety data and product use information.

recommendation on June 22, [ADDRESS_198844] Quadrivalent should not be used in the US for 
the 2016-2017 influenza season ( Grohskopf et al, 2016 ). The vaccine remains licensed for 
use by [CONTACT_169953] “the benefits of FluMist Quadrivalent 
outweigh any potential risks.” ( US FDA, 2016 ). This study is being conducted to describe the 
immunogenicity, safety, and viral shedding of a new A/H1N1 strain (A/Slovenia/2903/2015) 
that will be incorporated into the FluMist Quadrivalent for the 2017-2018 influenza season to the immunogenicity, safety, and viral shedding of the previous A/H1N1 strain (A/Bolivia/559/2013) that was included in the vaccine in the 2015-[ADDRESS_198845] their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with ICH/Good Clinical Practice, and applicable regulatory requirements.

15 of 90 Final Template Version 17.0Considerations relating to benefits:
In placebo-controlled studies with greater than 13,000 pediatric subjects conducted during 
7 influenza seasons from 1996 through 2003 in Europe, Latin America, Africa, Asia/Oceania, 
and the US, trivalent FluMist protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza illness was demonstrated in a broad age range of children. In these placebo controlled studies, trivalent FluMist consistently demonstrated high rates of efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza 
caused by [CONTACT_169954]-type virus strains antigenically matched to those in the vaccine (ranging from 
62.2% to 100%) and also against all strains regardless of antigenic match. In 3 trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV)-controlled studies involving > 12,[ADDRESS_198846] reduced the number of cases of culture-confirmed influenza illness by 35% to 53% for illness due to matched strains and by 32% to 55% for 
illness due to all strains regardless of antigenic match. 
Since incorporation of [ADDRESS_198847] H1N1 strains 
has varied by [CONTACT_169955]. Based on a study from the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC), the vaccine appeared effective against H1N1 when given as a monovalent vaccine in 2009-2010. However, based on a retrospective evaluation of the CDC 
data for 2010-[ADDRESS_198848]-
negative study and a cluster-randomized trial. Based on the findings from both 2010-2011 
and 2013-2014 seasons, MedImmune replaced the H1N1 component of the vaccine (A/[LOCATION_004]/07/2009) with a more heat stable strain (A/Bolivia/559/2013). Replacement of the A/[LOCATION_004] strain may have improved the effectiveness of the vaccine, however, the 
effectiveness of the vaccine against A/H1N1pdm09 strains was still lower than expected 
during the 2015-[ADDRESS_198849] this strain with a new H1N1 strain (A/Slovenia/2903/2015) for the 2017-2018 season.

Considerations relating to risks:
There are two important identified risks for FluMist, wheezing in children under the age of 
2 years and hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis). Data from clinical studies found vaccine

3 STUDY DESIGN
3.1 Description of the Study
This randomized, double-blind, multi-center study will enroll approximately 200 children 24 
to < 48 months of age, at screening. Subjects will be randomized (~65 subjects per group) at 
1:1:1 ratio to receive two doses of either 1) a quadrivalent formulation of FluMist. Strains included in the vaccine will be based on the WHO and VRBPAC 2017-2018 Northern Hemisphere recommendations and will include a replacement H1N1 strain
(A/Slovenia/2903/2015) and A/New Caledonia/71/2014 (H3N2), B/Phuket/3073/2013 
(B/Yamagata-lineage), and B/Brisbane/60/2008 (B/Victoria-lineage); 2) a second quadrivalent formulation of FluMist. Strains included in the vaccine will be based on the 
2015-[ADDRESS_198857]: A/Bolivia/559/2013 (H1N1),
A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2), B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata-lineage), and B/Brisbane/60/2008 (B/Victoria-lineage); or 3) a trivalent formulation of FluMist. Strains included in the trivalent vaccine will be based on the strains recommended by [CONTACT_169957] 2015-2016 season: A/Bolivia/559/2013 (H1N1), 
A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2), and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata-lineage).
Subjects will be screened for the study within [ADDRESS_198858] ever received prior influenza vaccination 
(Yes/No). It is intended that approximately 50% of randomized subjects will not have been 
previously vaccinated. All subjects will receive an initial dose of investigational product at the site on Study Day 1. Subjects will receive a second dose on Study Day 28.
MedImmune Protocol D2560C00013, Amendment 1
MEDI3250 02Jun2017; Final
[ADDRESS_198859] on Days 2, 3, 4, 
5, and 7 after Dose 1 and on Days 2, 4, and 6 after Dose 2. Blood and nasal samples for the 
assessment of immune responses will be obtained on Day 1 prior to dosing, on Day 28 (prior 
to dosing) and on Day 56.
Safety evaluation will consist of the collection of solicited symptoms during the 14-day 
period after each dose, and AEs, SAEs, and concomitant medication use through the 28-day 
period post each dose. On Days 1 and 28, subjects’ legal representatives will be given a 
temperature log to record daily temperature during the [ADDRESS_198860] dosing. Four telephone contacts for safety follow-up will occur between  Days 15-16, Days 21 -23, Days 42-44 and 
Days 48-50. 
The study will be conducted during the influenza “off-season” in the US. It is anticipated that 
enrollment will start around the beginning of June 2017. The duration of subject participation is approximately 3 to 4 months. After completion of the study all subjects will be offered and strongly encouraged to receive one or two doses (depending on their vaccination history) of 
an inactivated influenza vaccine approved for use in the US for the 2017-2018 influenza 
season.

Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_198861] Quadrivalent 2017-2018 formulation (approximately 65 subjects), 
FluMist Quadrivalent 2015-2016 formulation (approximately 65 subjects), or FluMist 
trivalent 2015-2016 formulation (approximately 65 subjects) by [CONTACT_24514].
3.2 Rationale for Dose, Population, and Endpoints
3.2.1 Dose Rationale
Subjects enrolled in the study will receive two 0.2-mL doses of vaccine (0.1 mL per nostril) 
with the second dose administered approximately [ADDRESS_198862] dose. Each 0.2-mL 
dose will contain 107±0.5 fluorescent focus units (FFU) of each vaccine strain. The dose 
volume and dose level are based on the [LOCATION_002] Food and drug Administration (US 
FDA) approved indication for FluMist Quadrivalent. In order to fully characterize the 
immunogenicity and shedding of the vaccine strains, all subjects will receive two doses.
3.2.[ADDRESS_198863] level of immune responses to live attenuated influenza vaccines 
(Coelingh et al, 2015 ) and to shed vaccine viruses at high titers ( Mallory et al, 2011 ). As a 
result, this population will allow for comparisons of the immunogenicity and viral shedding 
of the new A/H1N1 strain (A/Slovenia/2903/2015) that will be incorporated into the FluMist Quadrivalent vaccine for the 2017-2018 influenza season to the immunogenicity and viral 
shedding of the previous A/H1N1 strain (A/Bolivia/559/2013) that was included in the 
vaccine in the 2015-[ADDRESS_198864] assays recommended by [CONTACT_169958] (Committee for Medicinal Products for 
Human Use [ CHMP], 2016 ). Additionally, for intranasally administered live attenuated 
vaccines, mucosal IgA responses have been associated with protective efficacy against 
influenza infection ( Ambrose et al, 2012 ). The ability to successfully replicate in the 
nasopharynx is an important characteristic of live attenuated vaccines and is associated with 
the induction of immune responses. The extent and duration of replication can be assessed

Note: an individual who initially is excluded from study participation based on one or more 
of the above time-limited criteria may be reconsidered for enrollment once the condition has 
resolved as long as the subject continues to meet all other entry criteria and the same subject identification (SID) number is used.
4.1.[ADDRESS_198871] Enrollment and Randomization
Study participation begins (ie, a subject is “enrolled”) once written informed consent is 
obtained. Once informed consent is obtained, a subject identification (SID) number will be 
assigned by a central system (an interactive web response system, IWRS) and the screening evaluations may begin to assess study eligibility (inclusion/exclusion) criteria. The SID number will be used to identify the subject during the screening process and throughout study 
participation, if applicable. 
MedImmune Protocol D2560C00013, Amendment 1
MEDI3250 02Jun2017; Final
23 of 90 Final Template Version 17.0A master log of all consented subjects will be maintained at the site and will document all 
screening failures (ie, subjects who are consented but do not meet study eligibility criteria 
and/or are not randomized), including the reason(s) for screening failure.
Subjects who fail to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria (ie, screening failures) should not be 
randomized or receive investigational product. Randomization will be stratified according to whether the subject received prior influenza vaccination (Yes/No). It is intended that 
approximately 50% of subjects randomized will not have been previously vaccinated.
4.1.5 Withdrawal from the Study
Subjects are free to withdraw their consent to participate in the study (investigational product 
and assessments) at any time, without prejudice to further treatment (withdrawal of consent). 
The subject’s legal representative will be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any 
adverse events (AEs). If possible, the subject will be seen and assessed by [CONTACT_093]. 
Adverse events will be followed up; diary assessment worksheets should be returned by [CONTACT_423]’s legal representative. If a subject withdraws from further participation in the study, then no further study visits or data collection should take place.
4.1.[ADDRESS_198872] in question:
1. Withdrawal of consent from further treatment with investigational product 
2. Lost to follow-up3. An adverse event (AE) that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_12440], warrants 
discontinuation of further dosing or meets criteria for discontinuation from investigational product
4. Subject is determined to have met one or more of the exclusion criteria or failed to meet 
all of the inclusion criteria for study participation
Subjects who are permanently discontinued from receiving investigational product will be 
followed for protocol-specified assessments including follow-up of any AEs unless consent is 
withdrawn from further study participation (Section 4.1.5 ), the subject is lost to follow-up, or 
the subject is enrolled in another clinical study.
4.1.7 Replacement of Subjects
Subjects will not be replaced.

24 of 90 Final Template Version [IP_ADDRESS] Withdrawal of Informed Consent for Data and Biological Samples
Biological Samples Obtained for the Main Study
Study data are protected by [CONTACT_24530], which is a number specific to the 
subject. The investigator is in control of the information that is needed to connect a study 
sample to a subject. A subject’s consent to the use of data does not have a specific expi[INVESTIGATOR_320], but the subject’s legal representative may withdraw consent at any time by [CONTACT_95129]. If consent is withdrawn, any samples collected prior to that time may still be 
given to and used by [CONTACT_169962].
Samples Obtained for Future Research
Samples obtained for future research will be labeled with a sample identification number 
linked to the SID number but will not be labeled with personal identifiers such as the 
subject’s name. If the subject’s legal representative withdraws consent for participating in the future research, the sponsor will locate the subject’s sample and destroy it. The coding of samples and results is to ensure that these research results are kept confidential by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_169935]’s identity and these results separate.
If the subject’s legal representative consents to have his/her samples used for future research, 
this additional research may not start immediately and may start at any time during the storage period. The subject’s sample(s) will be stored by [CONTACT_169963] a secure central laboratory. The subject’s samples will not be kept for 
more than [ADDRESS_198873]’s legal representative chooses not to allow the study samples to be used for future research, the 
samples will be destroyed by [CONTACT_169964].
If consent is withdrawn after a sample has been taken but before the subject’s sample is sent 
to the sponsor for future research, the investigator will arrange to have it destroyed. If consent is withdrawn after the subject’s sample(s) have been sent to the sponsor for future research, 
the sponsor and the investigator will ensure that these sample(s) are destroyed unless the 
sample identification number has been removed and the subject can no longer be linked to any sample(s). However, if the subject’s samples have already been used for research, the sponsor is not required to destroy results of this research. In this case only the remaining 
sample(s) will be destroyed.

Subjects will be offered and encouraged to receive commercial inactivated influenza vaccine 
as approved for the upcoming influenza season unless receipt is felt to be contraindicated 
according to the judgment of the investigator. The commercial inactivated influenza vaccine 
will be administered in accordance with the package insert. The optional dose(s) of influenza vaccine should be administered prior to the start of the influenza season. The optional study dose(s) must occur at least [ADDRESS_198887]/legal representative and the site. 
As with any vaccine, allergic reactions after administration are possible. Therefore, 
appropriate drugs and medical equipment to treat acute anaphylactic reactions must be immediately available, and study personnel must be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis. After vaccination, all participants will be observed for a minimum of 
15 minutes by [CONTACT_5984]. Emergency management supplies (eg, AMBU bag, adrenaline 
[epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]], antihistamine) must be available for initial treatment of an allergic reaction if needed.  
If subjects experience AEs following receipt of an optional dose of commercial influenza 
vaccine, the investigator will be advised to report them as required per local spontaneous 
postmarketing pharmacovigilance procedures. If the event is an SAE that has occurred within

[any route], heart rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]), height and weight in appropriate units will be completed during screening and on Days [ADDRESS_198888] 3 blood samples collected for serum influenza HAI antibody testing,
serum influenza neutralizing antibody testing, and potentially other anti-influenza serology 
tests: one on Day [ADDRESS_198889], one on Day 28 (+ 2 days) prior 
to receiving Dose [ADDRESS_198890], and one on Day 56 (± 2 days; see time points Table 4.2-1 ). Serum will be separated and stored frozen at -20 ± 5°C or below until being 
batched and shipped to the central laboratory according to procedures specified in the 
Laboratory Manual. Serum can also be stored at -60°C or below.
Immune response evaluation will consist of serum HAI antibody titers and serum 
neutralizing antibody titers, both measurements to strains antigenically matched to those contained in the quadrivalent or trivalent vaccine formulation received. Additional assays 
may be performed to investigate immune responses to influenza or other respi[INVESTIGATOR_4398]. 
Samples may also be retained for potential future testing for immune response to influenza ifthe subject’s legal representative has given consent to potential future testing (no human genetic testing will be performed). Immunogenicity assays will be conducted following 
standard influenza HAI antibody and microneutralization assay procedures.
4.3.4 Shedding Evaluation and Methods
Instructions for obtaining and processing nasopharyngeal swab samples are provided in the 
Laboratory Manual. Nasopharyngeal swabs for quantification of influenza viral shedding will be obtained on Days 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 30, 32, and 34 (see time points Table 4.2-1 ). All 
nasopharyngeal samples obtained from vaccinated subjects will have virus shedding 
quantified by [CONTACT_16641]-PCR. Strain-specific qRT-PCR primer sets will be used to differentially

Investigational product will be packaged and stored at -30°C and shipped to the study site 
upon request of the sponsor or designee. The distributor will ship the investigational product directly to the clinical study site by [CONTACT_24537]. Receiving departments should be notified that rapid handling of the shipment is required. Upon receipt at each study site, 
frozen investigational product should be immediately transferred to a -20°C (or -4°F) freezer 
(variations up to ± 5°C are acceptable) in a secure location with limited access. 
Investigational product will be supplied to the site in devices with identical appearances in 
coded kits. Each kit has a unique number that is printed on all labels within the kit (ie, the 
outer carton label and the label of each device within the carton). Each sprayer is also labeled 
with a unique number. Labels will be prepared in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and local regulatory guidelines. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Investigational Product Handling
Investigational product should not be removed from storage until the day of dosing. Remove only the sprayer to be administered; other sprayers in the kit must remain in the labeled 
storage conditions and must not thaw. Any broken or damaged sprayer must be identified as 
damaged and the sprayer number recorded on the investigational product accountability record. Damaged sprayers can be stored at room temperature until accountability is completed.

[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Administration
The first day of dosing is considered Day 1.
•Investigational product should be brought to room temperature by [CONTACT_169969] (see Appendix 10.4). 
The investigational product should be administered immediately thereafter.
•A single administration comprises intranasal delivery of approximately 0.2 mL total 
volume (0.1 mL into each nostril). Each sprayer has a divider that allows delivery of 
approximately half the contents of the sprayer into one nostril. Removal of the divider allows delivery of the remaining volume into the other nostril.
•The individual administering the investigational product should depress the plunger rod as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_24506] a fine mist. Half of the contents of each sprayer will be sprayed as a fine mist into each nostril while the subject is in an upright position.
•After administration, used study sprayers must be placed immediately after use into 
locked containers or sealed bags.
[IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring of Dose Administration
As with any vaccine, allergic reactions to dose administration are possible. Therefore, 
appropriate drugs and medical equipment to treat acute anaphylactic reactions must be 
immediately available, and study personnel must be trained to recognize and treat 
anaphylaxis. After vaccination, all subjects will be observed for a minimum of 15 minutes by [CONTACT_5984]. Emergency management supplies (eg, AMBU bag, adrenaline [epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]], antihistamine) will be made available for the initial treatment of an allergic reaction if 
needed. Local reactions or systemic events must be recorded.
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Product Complaints
Any defects with the investigational product must be reported immediately to the 
MedImmune Product Complaint Department by [CONTACT_169970]. All defects will be communicated to MedImmune and investigated further with the Product Complaint Department. During the investigation of the product complaint, all investigational product must be stored at labeled conditions unless otherwise instructed.

40 of 90 Template [IP_ADDRESS] Methods for Unblinding
[IP_ADDRESS] Unblinding in the Event of a Medical Emergency 
In the event of a medical emergency, the investigator may unblind an individual subject’s 
investigational product allocation. Instructions for unblinding an individual subject’s investigational product allocation are contained in the IWRS manual. In general, unblinding should only occur if management of the medical emergency would be different based on the 
subject having received investigational product. In the majority of cases, the management of 
a medical emergency would be the same whether or not investigational product was received by [CONTACT_423]. If this was the case, the investigational product allocation should not be unblinded.
MedImmune retains the right to unblind the treatment allocation for serious adverse events 
(SAEs) that are unexpected and are suspected to be causally related to an investigational product and that potentially require expedited reporting to regulatory authorities. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Unblinding for Planned Analysis Purposes 
Planned analyses are described in Section 4.8. The study will be fully unblinded at the time 
of its completion.
4.7 Restrictions During the Study and Concomitant Treatment(s)
The investigator must be informed as soon as possible about any medication taken from the time of screening until the end of the clinical phase of the study (final study visit). Any 
concomitant medication(s), including herbal preparations, taken during the study will be 
recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).
4.7.1 Permitted Concomitant Medications
Investigators may prescribe concomitant medications or treatments deemed necessary to 
provide adequate supportive care except for those medications identified as “excluded” as 
listed in Section 4.7.2 . Specifically, subjects should receive full supportive care during the 
study, including transfusions of blood and blood products, and treatment with antibiotics, anti-emetics, anti-diarrheals, and analgesics, and other care as deemed appropriate, and in accordance with their institutional guidelines.

42 of 90 Template [IP_ADDRESS] Sample Size
HAI Immunogenicity
It is expected that for each analysis of immunogenicity, 90% of subjects will be evaluable. 
The resulting sample size of ~60 evaluable subjects per arm would produce a 95% 
confidence interval (CI) within 14 percentage points of the observed proportion of subjects seroconverting. An estimate of 40% for the proportion of subjects seroconverting was used for the purposes of CI calculations.
Assuming that the seroconversion rate in the A/Bolivia H1N1 strain (2015-2016 formulation) 
ranged from 10% to 40%, based on 25% of the rate difference, the sample size of 60 evaluable subjects per arm would result in approximately 80% power to detect a statistically significant difference in the seroconversion rate comparing the A/Bolivia H1N1 strain (2015-
2016 formulation) to the replacement H1N1 strain selected for the 2017-2018 vaccine 
formulation (A/Slovenia/2903/2015). Table 4.8.2-1 summarizes the study power based on

It is expected that for each analysis of shedding, 90% of subjects will be evaluable. The 
resulting sample size of ~60 evaluable subjects per arm would produce a 95% CI within 
15 percentage points of the observed proportion of subjects who shed. An estimate of 50% for the proportion of subjects shedding influenza vaccine virus was used for the purposes of sample size calculations, as this value was statistically conservative (ie, had the highest 
variability).
4.8.3 Analyses of Immunogenicity and Shedding ……
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Endpoint Analysis 
The primary endpoint is the strain-specific HAI antibody seroconversion rates, defined as at 
least 4-fold increase from baseline through Day 28 and Day 56. The proportion of subjects 
who had seroconversion will be summarized at Days 28 and 56 visits by [CONTACT_169946]. Its corresponding 95% exact CI will be provided.   
The difference in proportion between the A/Bolivia H1N1 strain (2015-2016) and the 
replacement H1N1 strain selected for the 2017-2018 vaccine formulation will be tested by 
[CONTACT_125427]–Mantel–Haenszel (CMH) test adjusting for the prior flu vaccination status. If the 
number of subjects in any stratum is too small, Fisher’s exact test will be used without 
adjusting for the prior flu vaccination status. If it is evident that the proportion is confounded 
with some of other demographic and baseline disease characteristic variables, the confounding variables will be adjusted.    
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Endpoint Analyses 
Geometric mean titers (GMTs) and geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) of HAI antibody,neutralizing antibody, and nasal IgA will be summarized by [CONTACT_169947] 28 and 56 visits. Corresponding 95% CI will be calculated assuming log normal distribution. 
Using the results of the qRT-PCR method, the proportion of subjects who shed vaccine will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_3148], strain, and dose number based on the same method as for the primary analysis. The number of days of shedding will be summarized descriptively by[CONTACT_3148], strain, dose number, and baseline serostatus. The viral titer will be calculated by 
[CONTACT_4475], strain, dose number, and baseline serostatus.

5.1 Definition of Adverse Events
The ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6(R1) defines an AE as:
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.
An AE includes but is not limited to any clinically significant worsening of a subject’s 
pre-existing condition. An abnormal laboratory finding (including ECG finding) that requires 
medical intervention by [CONTACT_093], or a finding judged by [CONTACT_169974]. If clinical sequelae are associated with a laboratory abnormality, the diagnosis or medical condition should be reported (eg, renal failure, hematuria) not the laboratory abnormality (eg, elevated creatinine, urine red blood cell
increased). 
AEs may be treatment emergent (ie, occurring after initial receipt of investigational product) 
or nontreatment emergent. A nontreatment-emergent AE is any new sign or symptom, disease, or other untoward medical event that begins after written informed consent has been 
obtained but before the subject has received investigational product. 
Elective treatment or surgery or preplanned treatment or surgery (that was scheduled prior to 
the subject being enrolled into the study) for a documented pre-existing condition that did not 
worsen from baseline is not considered an AE (serious or nonserious). An untoward medical 
event occurring during the prescheduled elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment should be recorded as an AE or SAE.
5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any AE that:
•Results in death
•Is immediately life-threatening
•Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
•Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
MedImmune Protocol D2560C00013, Amendment 1
MEDI3250 02Jun2017; Final
46 of 90 Template 17.0•Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in this situation. Examples of medically important events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]; or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.
5.[ADDRESS_198905], possible etiologies, and whether the event meets criteria of an SAE and therefore requires immediate notification to the sponsor (see 
Section 5.4). See Section 5.2for the definition of SAEs and Section 10.2 for guidelines for 
assessment of severity and relationship. 
If an AE evolves into a condition that meets the regulatory definition of “serious,” it will be 
reported on the SAE Report Form.
5.3.[ADDRESS_198906].
All SAEs will be recorded from the time of informed consent.
For nontreatment-emergent AEs (ie, AEs that occur during the period from the time informed 
consent is signed but prior to the subject receiving investigational product), only AEs associated with protocol-related procedures should be reported. After the start of treatment, all treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs; Section 5.1) should be reported.
5.3.[ADDRESS_198907]’s last AE assessment in the study are followed up 
by [CONTACT_24549], but without further recording in the eCRF. MedImmune retains the right to request additional information for any subject with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary.

47 of 90 Template [IP_ADDRESS] Deaths ……….
All deaths that occur during the study, including the protocol-defined follow-up period must 
be reported as follows:
•Death clearly the result of disease progression should be reported and documented in the 
electronic case report form (eCRF) but should not be reported as an SAE.
•Where death is not due (or not clearly due) to disease progression, the AE causing the 
death must be reported as an SAE within 24 hours. The report should contain a comment 
regarding the co-involvement of disease progression, if appropriate, and should assign main and contributory causes of death.
•Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as an SAE. A post-mortem 
(autopsy) may be helpful in the assessment of the cause of death, and if performed a copy 
of the post-mortem results should be forwarded to the sponsor representative(s) within the usual timeframes (refer to Section 5.4for additional information).
5.[ADDRESS_198908], or to the study procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF.
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then investigators or other site personnel must
inform the appropriate sponsor representative(s) within 1 day, ie, immediately but no later 
than 24 hours after becoming aware of the event.
The designated sponsor representative works with the investigator to ensure that all the 
necessary information is provided to the sponsor’s patient safety data entry site within 
1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life-threatening events and within 5 calendar 
days of initial receipt for all other SAEs.
For fatal or life-threatening AEs where important or relevant information is missing, active 
follow-up is undertaken immediately. Investigators or other site personnel inform sponsor 
representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE within 1 calendar 
day, ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours after becoming aware of the event.
Once the investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the electronic data 
capture (EDC) system, an automated email alert is sent to inform the designated sponsor 
representative(s).

5.5 Other Events Requiring Immediate Reporting
5.5.1 Overdose ……….
An overdose is defined as a subject receiving a dose of investigational product in excess of 
that specified in the Package Insert, unless otherwise specified in this protocol.
•An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the 
relevant AE modules in the eCRF and on the Overdose eCRF module.
•An overdose without associated symptoms is only reported on the Overdose eCRF module.
If an overdose on a MedImmune investigational product occurs during the course of the 
study, then the investigator or other site personnel inform appropriate sponsor representatives immediately, or no later than 24 hours after becoming aware of the event.
The designated sponsor representative works with the investigator to ensure that all relevant 
information is provided to the sponsor’s Patient Safety data entry site.
For overdoses associated with an SAE, the standard reporting timelines apply; see Section
5.4. For other overdoses, reporting must occur within [ADDRESS_198909] dosing. For this study, 
solicited symptoms include:
•Fever ≥ 100.4°F (38.0°C) by [CONTACT_28414]
•Runny/stuffy nose
•Sore throat
•Cough
•Headache
•Generalized muscle aches

58 of 90 Template 17.010.2 Appendix 10.2 - Additional Safety Guidance
Further Guidance on the Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
Life threatening
‘Life-threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the subject’s death. ‘Life-threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe 
form it might have caused death (eg, hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_169939] a serious AE, although the reasons 
for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2144]/or surgical 
operations planned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study.
Important Medical Event or Medical Intervention
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], disability or incapacity but may jeopardize the subject or may 
require medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definition of 
serious. These should usually be considered as serious.
Simply stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_33095]; 
medical judgment must be used.
Examples of such events are:
•Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring intravenous 
hydrocortisone treatment
•Hepatotoxicity caused by [CONTACT_76475] (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with N-acetylcysteine
•Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
•Blood dyscrasias (eg, neutropenia or anemia requiring blood transfusion) or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
•Development of drug dependency or drug abuse
MedImmune Protocol D2560C00013, Amendment 1
MEDI3250 02Jun2017; Final
[ADDRESS_198921].
Grade 4 An event, and/or its immediate sequelae, that is associated with 
an imminent risk of death or with physical or mental 
disabilities that affect or limit the ability of the subject to 
perform activities of daily living (eating, ambulation, toileting, etc).
Grade 5 Death as a result of an event.
It is important to distinguish between serious criteria and severity of an AE. Severity is a 
measure of intensity whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_14540] 5.2. A Grade 3 
AE need not necessarily be considered an SAE. For example, a Grade 3 headache that 
persists for several hours may not meet the regulatory definition of an SAE and would be 
considered a nonserious event, whereas a Grade 2 seizure resulting in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95064].
MedImmune Protocol D2560C00013, Amendment 1
MEDI3250 02Jun2017; Final
[ADDRESS_198922]. The following factors should be considered when deciding if there is a “reasonable possibility” that an AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198].
•Time Course. Exposure to suspect investigational product. Has the subject actually 
received the suspect investigational product? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal 
relationship to the administration of the suspect investigational product?
•Consistency with known investigational product profile. Was the AE consistent with the 
previous knowledge of the suspect investigational product (pharmacology and 
toxicology) or products of the same pharmacological class? OR could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological properties? 
•De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_169940]?
•No alternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_169978], other drugs, or other host or environmental factors.
•Re-challenge experience. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected investigational product was reintroduced after having been stopped? MedImmune would not normally recommend or 
support a re-challenge.
•Laboratory tests. A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship?
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
•Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the investigational product?
•Is there a known mechanism?
Causality of ‘related’ is made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for 
a ‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expression ‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.
The causality assessment is performed based on the available data including enough 
information to make an informed judgment. With limited or insufficient information in the case, it is likely that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.
MedImmune Protocol D2560C00013, Amendment 1
MEDI3250 02Jun2017; Final
[ADDRESS_198923] should be classified as no reasonable possibility.
Relationship to Protocol Procedures
The investigator is also required to provide an assessment of relationship of SAEs to protocol 
procedures on the SAE Report Form. This includes nontreatment-emergent SAEs (ie, SAEs that occur prior to the administration of investigational product) as well as treatment-
emergent SAEs. A protocol-related SAE may occur as a result of a procedure or intervention 
required during the study (eg, blood collection, washout of an existing medication). The following guidelines should be used by [CONTACT_95108]:
Protocol related: The event occurred due to a procedure/intervention that was described 
in the protocol for which there is no alternative etiology present in the subject’s medical record.
Not protocol related: The event is related to an etiology other than the procedure/ 
intervention that was described in the protocol (the alternative etiology 
must be documented in the study subject’s medical record).

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NAID) and Food Allergy and 
Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) define anaphylaxis as a serious allergic reaction that is rapid 
in onset and may cause death. They recognize 3 categories of anaphylaxis, with criteria designated to capture from 80% of cases (category 1) to > 95% of all cases of anaphylaxis (for all 3 categories). 
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, 
mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula)AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING
a. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] (PEF), hypoxemia)
b. Reduced blood pressure (BP) or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (eg, 
hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely allergen for 
that patient (minutes to several hours):
a. Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch-flush, swollen 
lips-tongue-uvula)
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, 
hypoxemia)
c. Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, 
incontinence)
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)
3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours):
a. Infants and children: low systolic BP (age specific) or greater than 30% decrease in 
systolic BP
b. Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that 
person’s baseline

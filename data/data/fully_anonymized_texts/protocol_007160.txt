Title :  Human Immune Responses to an Adjuvanted H5 Vaccine: Durability and Impact of the Seasonal Influenza 
Vaccine on H5 Induced B Cell Responses  
 
Principal Investigator : [INVESTIGATOR_374167] G. Rouphael, MD, MSc  
School of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseas es 
The Hope Clinic, [ADDRESS_468473], Decatur, GA [ZIP_CODE]  
 
Sponsor:  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)  
 
Introduction 
You are being asked to be in a medical research study. This form is designed to tell you everything you need to think 
about before you decide if you want to be a part of the study.  It is entirely your choice.  If you decide to take part, you 
can change your mind later on and withdraw from the research study.  The decision to join or not join the research 
study will not cause you to lose any medical benefits.  If you decide not to take part in this study, your doctor will continue to treat you.  
 
Before making your decision:  
• Please carefully read this form or have it r ead to you  
• Please listen to the study doctor or study staff explain the study to you  
• Please ask questions about anything that is not clear  
 You can take  a copy of this consent form, to keep. Feel free to take your time thinking about whether you would lik e to 
participate. You may wish to discuss your decision with family or friends. Do not sign this consent form unless you have 
had a chance to ask questions and get answers that make sense to you.  By [CONTACT_374171].  A description of this clinical trial will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, as required by U.S. law. This Web si te 
will not include information that can identify you. At most the Web site will include a summary of the results. You can search  this Web site at any time.  
 
What is the purpose of this study?  
The influenza virus (a germ) causes influenza or "flu." The flu is an infection of your b reathing tubes and your lungs. Flu is 
caused by [CONTACT_374172]. Flu is spread fro m person -to-person mainly through coughing and 
sneezing. When someone has the flu they usually have a runny nose, cough, sore throat, headache and fever. Each 
winter, the flu causes illness that often fee ls just like the “common cold.”  This is known as “se asonal flu.” Usually the 
types of influenza viruses are similar from year- to-year.   
 In recent years, flu viruses that at first only infected birds have begun to infect humans.  One of these strains is  called 
avian influenza (A/H5N1 subtype) or “bird flu”. Although no human cases of bird flu have been diagnosed in the United 
States, this strain has caused severe illness and death in several hundred people since late 2003. Scientists are worried that the A/H5N1 “bird flu” virus could cause a pandemic.  
 Vacci nation is the best  way to control flu and prevent its illness and complications. Vaccines help the body to make 
antibodies that fight infection.  When you get the flu vaccine (sometimes called the flu shot), your immune system makes 
antibodies against the fl u virus. If you are exposed to the flu virus after getting the flu shot, the antibodies will help 
protect you by [CONTACT_374173].

IRB Form 04302018  The purpose of this study is to see  how long the immune response to the Influenza A (H5N1) vaccine lasts. The researc h 
team wants to explore how the FDA -approved seasonal flu vaccine impacts the immune response in people who were 
given the pandemic H5N1 vaccine with or without the AS03 adjuvant.  
 
This study plans to enroll up to 50 people, and o nly those who participate d in the HIPC  VAX-010 Systems Biology of 
Influenza A (H5N1) Virus Monovalent Vaccine with and without AS03 Adjuvant study are eligible to take part in this study , regardless of whether they received the H5N1 vaccine with or without the AS03 adjuvant.  
 In this study, you will be given a single dose of the FDA -approved 2018 -2019 seasonal influenza vaccine, Fluarix 
Quadrivalent. This vaccine is manufactured by [CONTACT_374174] 6 months 
of age. Blood samples will be obtained at each study visit.  
 
Please talk to the study team if you:  
• Have been sick in the last 72 hours , including any fever (> 100.4 F [ > 38.0C ]) 
• Have any acute or chronic medical condition  
• Have a suppressed immune system as a result of illness, medication, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy  
• Are pregnant or breastfeeding or plan to within 1 month  
• Have taken corticosteroids within 28 days  
• Have a known history of autoimmune disease  
• Have a history of Guillain -Barre Syndrome  
• Have a history of bleeding disord ers 
• Have a hypersensitivity or allergy to the vaccine  or its components , including egg and latex allergies  
• Have a history of any severe reaction to any vaccine  
• Have received blood or blood products in the last 3 months or plan to in the next 6 months  
• Have received any live virus vaccines within the last 4 weeks  or plan to in the next 4 weeks  
• Have received any inactivated vaccine within  the last  2 weeks or plan to in the next 2 weeks  
• Have received any exp erimental agents in the last  6 weeks or plan to in the  next 12 months  
• Have received the 2018 -2019 influenza seasonal vaccine  
• Have had  influenza infection during the 2018 -2019 influenza season  
 
What will I be asked to do?  
The study lasts for about 12  months and requires  7 visits. Visit 1 is the day of the vacc ination and the remaining visits 
occur about 8 days ( Visit 2), 15 days ( Visit 3), 29 days (Visit 4), 100 days (Visit 5), 180 days (Visit 6), and 365 days ( Visit 7) 
after vaccination. About 5 to 6 tablespoons of blood  will be obtained at each study visit. During the study visits we will 
do the following:  
 Visit 1 ( may take up to 2  hours):
 
• Obtain your informed consent by [CONTACT_374175], answering questions, and signing this document  
• Collect your medical history and information about medications  
• Measure  your oral temperature, pulse, blood pressure, height, and weight  
• Do a urine pregnancy test for females of child -bearing potential  
• Ask you to agree to use 1 form of birth control for 28 days before and 28 days after getting the vaccine  
• Do a  targeted phys ical exam, if needed  
• Collect blood samples  
• Give you the seasonal influenza vaccine  
• Observe  you for 20 minutes after getting the vaccine

• Review your memory aid (for Visit 2 only)  
 
Optional: Blood Sample Storage for Future Research  
This study invol ves the collection of blood samples. With your agreement, the researchers may store these samples from 
the study for future medical research. You will be asked to consent separately at the end of this form for the retention 
and use of your leftover samples .  
 
These samples could be used to further explore the markers of immune response to the AS03 adjuvanted or unadjuvanted H5N1 vaccine and the impact from the seasonal influenza vaccine.  Your samples will not be sold or used 
directly for production of any c ommercial product. Reports about future research done with your samples will NOT be 
kept in your health records.  
 If you do not agree to this future research, your  samples will be used only for the study and destroyed after analysis.  If 
consent is not give n for use of the samples for future use, you  can still participate in the study.  
 
All blood samples collected from you will be stored in secure facilities during the study and will be destroyed on 
completion of the study analyses. If you have agreed for yo ur samples to be used for future research, then they will be 
stored indefinitely. You can ask for your  samples to be destroyed before this point.  However, data derived from samples 
will continue to be kept and used for the purposes agreed  to by [CONTACT_374176]. To ensure privacy, your  name [CONTACT_374193]; instead, you  will only be identified by [CONTACT_374177], which will not allow the lab or third 
parties to know your  identity.

IRB Form 04302018  Who owns my study information and samples?  
If you join this study,  you will be donating your samples and study information.  You will not receive any compensation if 
your samples or information are used to make a new product. If you withdraw from the study, data and samples that 
were already collected may  still be used f or this study.   
 
What are the possible risks and discomforts?  
There may be side effects from the  [ADDRESS_468474] seasonal influenza.  
 
Study vaccine risks:   
In adults, the most common (affects more than 1 user in 10) risks and discomforts include local pain (36%), muscle aches 
(16%), headache (16%), and fatigue (16%). Less common (affects 1 to 10 users in 100) risks and discomforts include 
arthralgia (8%), gastrointestinal symptoms (7%), shivering (4%), local swelling (2%), local redness (2%), and fever (2%).  
 
Allergic reactions including hives, trouble breathing, or other allergic responses are rare but possible risks, as with any 
vaccine. Anaphylaxis is an immediate allergic reaction (also known as allergic shock). This type of reaction may include skin rash (hives), swelling around the mouth , throat and eyes, difficulty breathing, sweating, increased pulse, or even 
fainting. If these reactions occur, they can usually be treated  by [CONTACT_374184]. 
Most people who experience anaphylaxis recover completely, but very rarely people can die . Across 4 clinical trials in 
adults (N=10,923), there was one case of anaphylaxis within one day following Fluarix vaccination.  
 Guillain -Barré Syndrome (GBS) is a rare disease of the nerves that causes severe weakness and breat hing problems. It is 
a typ of paralysis (where your muscles can't move). Most people who get GBS recover completely, but some people can be paralyzed for a long time or even die.  GBS occurs throughout the world, with a median incidence of 1.3 
cases/100,000 population (range, 0.4 –4.0). While the [ADDRESS_468475] becau se you received the vaccine does 
not guarantee that you are protected from seasonal influenza.   
 Side effects of having blood taken:   Some people may get lightheaded or faint during or just after having blood drawn. Having your blood drawn can be painful  and can cause bruising. Bruising can be prevented or reduced by [CONTACT_374185] a few minutes 
after the blood is drawn. It is possible to get an infection where the study staff draw your blood, but this is very rare. To  
reduce the risk of  infection, the study staff will wipe the area clean with alcohol and use sterile equipment.  
 
If you are a woman: to protect against possible side effects of the study drug, women who are pregnant or nursing a 
child may not take part in this study . If you  become pregnant, there may be risks to you, the embryo, or fetus. These 
risks are not yet known. If you are a woman of childbearing ability, you and the study doctor must agree on at least one 
method of birth control to use to avoid pregnancy within [ADDRESS_468476] tell the study doctor immediately . Pregnant women will 
be taken out of the study.  
 If you are a man:  the effect of the vaccine  on sperm  is not known.

Page 7 of 11  Version 1.0 Date: 09/19/2018  
IRB Form 04302018  New Information: 
It is possible that the researchers will learn something new during the study a bout the risks of being in it. If this happens, 
they will tell you about it. Then you can decide if you want to contin ue to be in this study o r not. You may be asked to 
sign a new consent form that includes the new information if you decide to stay in the study.  
 
Will I benefit directly from the study?   
This study is not designed to benefit you directly , but you may receive some level of immune protection from this year’s 
seasonal influenza. However, you may not be fully protected from getting seasonal influenza this year. This study is designed to learn more about  the influenza immune response . The study results may be used to help others in the  
future and may assist researchers in creating a universal influenza vaccine.  
Will I be compensated for my time and effort?  
You will get compensated for each completed study visit, for your time and effort:  
• $75 for Visit 1/ vaccine visit  
• $50 for Visits 2 t hrough 7/ follow -up visits  
 If you do not finish the study, we will compensate you for the visits you have completed. You will get $[ADDRESS_468477].  
 Emory Universit y is required by [CONTACT_180362]. To do this, Emory University  
Department of Finance needs to keep your Social Security Number on file. You will be asked to fill out a tax form, including your Social Security or Taxpayer Ident ification Number, in order to be reimbursed, depending on the amount 
and method of payment. Some payment methods involve mail coming to your house, which may be seen by [CONTACT_374186]. You can decline payment if you are concerned about confidenti ality, or you can talk to the study team 
to see if there are other payment options.  
What are my other options?  
You do not have to take part in this study.  There are seasonal influenza vaccines you can receive outside of this study to 
protect you against seasonal flu this year.  
 
How will you protect my private information that you collect in this study?  
Certain offices and people other than the researchers may look at study records. Government agencies and Emory employees overseeing proper study conduct may  look at your study records.  These offices include [ The Food and Drug 
Administration , the Office for Human Research Protections, the funder(s), the Emory Institutional Review Board, the 
Emory Office of Research Compliance ]. Study funders may also look at your study records.   Emory will keep any 
research records we create private to the extent we are required to do so by [CONTACT_2371].  A study number rather than your name [CONTACT_374194]. Your name [CONTACT_374195].   
Certificate of Confidentiality  
There is a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health for this Study.  The Certificate of Confidentiality helps us to keep others from learning that you participated in this study.  Emory will rely on the Certificate of Confidentiality to refuse to give out study information that identifies you.  For example, if Emory received a subpoena for study records, it would not give out information that identifies you.  
 The Certificate of Confidentiality does not stop you or someone else, like a member of your family, from giving out information about your participation in this study.  For example, if you let your insurance company know t hat you are in

IRB use only  Document Approved On: «ApproveDate » 
 
 
Page 8 of 11  Version 1.0 Date: 09/19/[ADDRESS_468478] your own privacy.  
 The Certificate does not stop Emory from making the following disclosures about you:  
• Giving state public health officials information about certain infectious diseases, 
• Giving law officials information about abuse of a child, elderly person or disabled person.  
• Giving out information to prevent harm to you or others.  
 Giving the study sponsor or funders information about the study, including information for an audit or evaluation.  
 
Storing and Sharing your Information 
De-identified data from this study, including your d e-identified genetic information, may  be shared with the research 
community at large to advance science and health. Data from this study may be placed into public databases where, in 
addition to having no direct identifiers, researchers will need to sign data use agreements before accessing the data. We 
will remove or code any personal information that could identify you before your information is  shared . This will ensure 
that, by [CONTACT_374187], it is extremely unlikely that anyone would be  able to identify 
you from the information we share. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_37104], we cannot guarantee anonymity of your personal data. 
 How is my Genetic Information Protected? What are the Risks?  
The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (G INA) is a federal law that generally makes it illegal for health insurance 
companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. This law generally will protect you in the following ways:  
• Health insurance companies and group health plans may not request your genetic information that we get from this research. 
• Health insurance companies and group health plans may not use your genetic information when making 
decisions regarding your eligibility or premiums.  
• Employers with [ADDRESS_468479] genetic discrimination by [CONTACT_55173], disability 
insurance, or long- term care insurance, and does not apply to employers with less than 15 employees.  
 In addition to GINA, the State of Georgia has laws that prohibit insurers from using genetic testing information for any non-treatment purpose.  However, like GINA, this state law protection has exclusions: life insurance policies, disability 
income policies, accidental death or dismemberment policies, Medicare supplement policies , long -term care insurance 
policies, credit insurance policies, specified disease policies, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374168], blanket accident and sickness policies, franchise policies issued on an insurance policy written as a part of workers’ compensation equivalent coverage, or other similar limited accident and sickness policies.  
 Privilege  
In the State of Georgia, in some circumstances your genetic information has may have special legal protections called “privilege.” This means that the information cannot  be used as evidence in a court. By [CONTACT_374188]. Other protec tions described in this form will still apply. There are 
also other confidentiality protections for research data in general under Georgia state law.

Page 9 of 11  Version 1.0 Date: 09/19/[ADDRESS_468480] will be made 
for you if an Emory provider or facility gives you any services or procedures for this study.   
 Copi[INVESTIGATOR_374169]/HIPAA authorization that you sign will be put in any  Emory Healthcare medical record  you 
have now or any time during the study .   
 The results of some study test s and procedures will be used only for research purposes and will not  be placed in your 
medical record. For this study, those items include  pregnancy tests.   
 Tests and procedures done at non -Emory places may not become part of your Emory medical record. Also, if you decide 
to be in this study, it is up to you to let your other health providers know.  
 
In Case of Injury  
If you get ill or injured from being in the study, Emory will help you get medical treatment.  Emory has not, however, set 
aside any money to pay you or to pay for this medical treatment. The only exception is if it is pr oven that your injury or 
illness is directly caused by [CONTACT_374189]. “Negligence” is the failure to follow a standard duty of 
care.  
If you become ill or injured from being in this study , your insurer will be billed for your treatment costs. If you do not 
have insurance, or if your insurer does not pay, then you will have to pay these costs.   
If you believe you have become ill or injured from this rese arch, you should contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Nadine Rouphael at telephone 
number: ( 404) 712- 1435.  You should also let any health care provider who treats you know that you are in a research 
study.  
Costs 
There will be no costs to you for participating in this study, other than basic expenses like transportation. You will not be  
charged for any of the research activities  or the study vaccine .  
 
Withdrawal from the Study  
You have the right to leave a study at any time without penalty. The researchers also have the right to stop your 
participation in this study without your consent for any reason, especially if they believe it is in your best interest or if you 
were to object to any future changes that may be made in the study plan.

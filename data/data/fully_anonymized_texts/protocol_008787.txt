Objectives
Overall objectives
W
e aim to develop a Gym where sensitized, wireless toys are strategically hung and placed within reach 
of infants to elicit toy-oriented body and arm/hand movements. Each toy will be equipped with sensors 
capable of measuring the infant's graspi[INVESTIGATOR_146379], pi[INVESTIGATOR_38633], tilting, etc. A low-cost 
3D motion capture system will be used to collect video data and the infants' reaching and body 
kinematics in response to the toys. A pressure mat will be used to measure postural changes to detect 
weight shifts, rolling, crawling and other movements away from the initial posture. By [CONTACT_7092][INVESTIGATOR_146380]-cost technologies, it will permit the regular and non-invasive monitoring of 
infants, which can lead to detailed, non-obtrusive, quantitative evaluation of motor development. In this 
vein, we also aim to conduct proof-of-concept testing of the Gym with atypi[INVESTIGATOR_146381]. We will include infants' ages 3 to 11 months who are categorized as high-risk or low-risk using 
the Bayley Infant Neurodevelopmental Screener.
Background
An estimated 5 to 10 percent of children ha
ve developmental disabilities (Rydz 2005), and an increase 
in survival rates of medically fragile infants has led to an increased number of children with functional 
impairments later in life (V ohr et al 2003). Particularly, pre-term and low birth weight infants as well as 
those exposed to brain injuries due to a central nervous injury insults such as asphyxia, neonatal 
seizures, prenatal drug use, or maternal infections are at increased risk for developmental delays and 
neurologic impairment.  Successful early detection of delay or impairment in at-risk infants depends on 
the effectiveness of standard clinical scales, many of which are not sufﬁciently sensitive to screen 
infants younger than 6 months (Leonard et al 2001). For example, one popular scale was reported to 
have a positive predictive value of [ADDRESS_167644] which inf
ants will develop 
disabilities at 2 and 3 years old (Aylward and Verhust 2000). However, currently there is no tool that is 
deﬁnitively predictive of functional impairment for infants less than one year. The earlier detection of 
motor delays or impairments provides the opportunity for earlier treatment, thus leading to better health 
outcomes over the lifespan (McIntyre et al 2011). Recognizing this, primary care pediatric physicians 
now recommend that infants at risk for delayed achievement of developmental milestones have a 
developmental evaluation at least two times during their ﬁrst year of life (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_146382] 2008). 
Unfortunately, while the physicians' recommendation is well intended, the current screening tools 
provide them with much less than perfect information. Note: For complete bibliography see grant

Study Design
Design
The proposed research is speciﬁcally designed to in
vestigate the ability of a novel tool to identify 
atypi[INVESTIGATOR_146384]. There will be an initial portion for 
usability feedback of hardware and software. For testing: For the ﬁrst portion of the study (Part A) we 
will recruit up to [ADDRESS_167647] 3 months 
and less than 11 months of age, score in the low-risk category on the Bayley Infant 
Neurodevelopmental Screener (BINS), score a greater than 85 on all sub-scales of the Bayley Scale of 
Infant Development (BSID-II), have no history of signiﬁcant cardiac, orthopedic, or neurological 
condition, and gestational age at least [ADDRESS_167648] 3 
months and less than 11 months of age (corrected for preterm birth if applicable), score in the moderate 
or high risk categories on the BINS, and score an 85 or less on the motor sub-scales of the Bayley Scale 
of Infant Development (BSID-II). In an effort to decrease variability of the data, infants in each group 
will be further stratiﬁed into an older group (8-10+ months) and a younger group (3-5 months).
Study duration
1) 
We estimate that it will take two years from the date of IRB approval to enroll all subjects and 
complete the study. 2) At minimum, some subjects may be asked to experienced the Gym 1x. At most, a 
subject will be asked to use the Gym for up to 5 consecutive days. Each day the infant will use the gym, 
both with and without toys, for 3 minutes.  3) 5/01/2015 - 8/01/2017

Subject recruitment
Inf
ants with typi[INVESTIGATOR_146387] (CHOP), and through local parent groups. Potential candidates in the at-risk group will be 
invited to participate through a variety of mechanisms within CHOP. The primary avenue for 
recruitment will be through the Neonatal Follow-up clinic at CHOP. Infants who are receiving services 
at the Center for Rehabilitation will also be invited to participate.  In efforts to recruit a population that 
is easily testable on multiple days, testing may be done at a local daycare.
Will the recruitment plan propose to use any Penn media services (communications, marketing, etc.) for 
outreach via social media a
venues (examples include: Facebook, Twitter, blogging, texting, etc.) or does 
the study team plan to directly use social media to recruit for the research?

Procedures
Prior to being assessed by [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_541], the parent or le
gal guardian will be consented. They will also be 
asked to ﬁll out general surveys including, a demographic survey, and a case report form, and a user 
feedback survey which provides relevant information, on both the family's and infant's medical history 
and experience. After being assessed by a certiﬁed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_146388], both atypi[INVESTIGATOR_146389]. The environment will be prepared such 
that only items safe for infants will be in the testing and play areas. Fort the usability: The caregiver 
may be asked to closely observe and examine the hardware and the software of the system. The 
caregiver may then offer the toy to the infant for familiarization, observe the infant play and capture and 
upload a video of this interaction. The caregiver may be asked to complete a feedback and observation 
survey that will provide relevant information about the interaction and software and hardware 
experience. Part A) Data quantifying infants actions with and without toys will be collected in one or 
two sessions. Infants will be tested for their reaction to the gym without toys and then their reactions 
with [ADDRESS_167652] camera. Arm/hand/leg position data will be collected with the 
kinect camera, grasp pressure and forces will be collected, toy position and angular data will be 
collected via Kinect and inertial sensors, and central pressure data will be collected via the novel mat. 
Video data mappi[INVESTIGATOR_146390] "Autism and Beyond" developed for research 
by [CONTACT_39644].  Part B) Data quantifying infant actions will be collected for 5 consecutive days 
under two conditions: with toys and without toys (control); the no toys condition will be tested ﬁrst and 
the toy condition immediately after. The data from the no toy condition will be used to adjust the 
observations in the toy condition and will be used to account for the infants baseline actions per day. A 
test session will proceed as follows: First, the infant will be placed on his or her back at a pre-
determined position on the gym mat in the no toy condition. Data will be collected for 3 minutes. The 
infant will be removed. The toys will be placed in the gym and adjusted for the infant reach; hanging 
toys will be placed at about 75% of the infants reach. After, the infant will be placed again with respect 
to the pre-determined position. To detect an infants intentional movement toward a speciﬁc toy, the 
location of each toy will be randomized within possible locations per toy type. The baby [CONTACT_146410] [ADDRESS_167653] camera. Arm/hand/leg position data will be collected with 
the kinect camera, grasp pressure and forces will be collected, toy position and angular data will be 
collected via Kinect and inertial sensors, and central pressure data will be collected via a pressure mat.  
General Procedure: A caregiver or parent will be seated at the head of the baby (out of babys sight) to 
provide comfort if needed. Infants will be required to be alert and unhampered by [CONTACT_146411]. They will be placed on their backs and allowed to roll or crawl as long as they stay 
within the perimeter of the device. If infants become frustrated (cries and is unsettled), the parent will 
be asked to pi[INVESTIGATOR_146391]. The trial will be restarted. If several attempts are unsuccessful, 
the session will be ended and attempted later in the day. We will take precautions to minimize the 
likelihood of participants experiencing any injury or discomfort. To avoid bumps, bruises or crashing 
into toys, participants will be supervised at all times by a trained study team member during CHOP 
sessions, including by a licensed pediatric physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_146392], and 
caregivers will be trained to place infants on their backs during home Gym play sessions. Caregivers 
will also be able to reposition their infants if he or she is uncomfortable.

Analysis Plan
W
e will identify a battery of metrics derived from kinematic and kinetic measurements of infant 
movement that are able to discriminate between atypi[INVESTIGATOR_146393]. Metrics quantifying one and two-handed reach and grasp actions as well as leg and body 
actions will be derived from the data. We will also determine the reliability/reproducibility of our 
methods across the repeated measurements taken in the home. We also will examine how each metric 
correlates with the BINS and BSITDIII scores.  The key primary metrics are unimanual and bimanual 
arm use, leg use, grasp forces, arm position when being used, and arm velocity when used. Secondary 
measures will be center of pressure from starting position, toy speed, toy acceleration, toy tilt angle, 
arm synchronicity, leg synchronicity, leg distance to toy, and respective differences in the percentage of 
arm use for reaching and for graspi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Given our long-term goal of detecting the emergence or lack of 
emergence of multiple milestones in the development of infants, we will examine a variety of metrics. 
Some of these milestones are the emergence of hand dominance using the relationship between the right 
and left hands; the emergence of unimanual or bimanual reaching using the relationship of the hand 
position to the toy, the hand speed, the frequency of movements; the emergence of unimanual graspi[INVESTIGATOR_146394], the emergence of undifferentiated bimanual graspi[INVESTIGATOR_146395] a toy, and the emergence of differentiated 
bimanual graspi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. For each variable, we anticipate having [ADDRESS_167654] deviations each day, to assess for variability. Intraclass correlations 
coefﬁcients (ICC) will be calculated to examine reliability/reproducibility of each measurement over 
the 5 days. If the ICCs are relatively high (.9), we will average the [ADDRESS_167655] perform 2-sample t-tests 
or Wilcoxon rank sum tests on the averages or ranks of each metric respectively, where the two groups 
represent atypi[INVESTIGATOR_146396], stratiﬁed by [CONTACT_551]. Given our stratiﬁed groups of younger/
older and typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]/atypi[INVESTIGATOR_146397], we anticipate having relatively large differences across most 
measures. Should the ICCs be low, due to learning we will use a 2-factor ANOV A in repeated measures 
where day would be the repeated measure and age group and infant type would be the 2 factors. For 
non-normal distributions, such as many zeroes for the atypi[INVESTIGATOR_146398]-normal/skewed 
distribution, we will use either Poisson (log-linear) regression or a Negative Binomial (ZINB) 
regression. All analyses will be performed using SAS statistical software. As we are looking for proof 
of concept, we will be looking for relatively large differences between atypi[INVESTIGATOR_146399]. In 
order to build a machine algorithm to analyze the baby [CONTACT_33653], we will build a test data set from publically 
held you tube videos. We will pull YouTube videos from babies between the ages of 1month and 12 
months.

Consent
1. Consent Process
Overview
Informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_146412][INVESTIGATOR_541], the trained study coordinator, or 
an investigator, and will be documented in the electronic database. The family will have the opportunity 
Page [ADDRESS_167659] that the SmarToyGym and tests are portable, testing can occur at CHOP, PI[INVESTIGATOR_146403], 
participants' homes, and local day care centers. Informed consent could therefore be obtained in any of 
these locations.
Risk / Beneﬁt
Potential Study Risks
The risks are minimal and all testing will be non-in
vasive. All treatment and assessment activities in the 
proposed research present no more than minimal risk to study participants. Risks include those involved 
with any developmental assessment or home play time, including bumps and bruises from poor control 
of movement or crashing into toys. Infants may also become frustrated if they attempt motor activities 
that they are as yet unable to perform, such as reaching or manipulating a toy. The environment will be 
prepared such that only items safe for infants will be in the testing area. Participants at risk for motor 
delays may rely on life-sustaining medical equipment, such as external respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413]. For these 
babies, routine daily risk includes breaches in the medical support equipment (such as decannulation), 
which can happen during therapy sessions, ﬂoor play time, clothing changes, and generally anytime 
throughout the day. If any study participant requires life-sustaining medical equipment, s/he will be 
accompanied at all times by a caregiver trained to respond to any breaches in medical support. 
Enrollment of these babies will also be conducted in consultation with the medical team. Additionally, 
protected health information will be collected as part of study records, and breaches of this information 
outside of the study team resulting in loss of conﬁdentially is an unlikely but potential risk. Alternatives 
to participation in this study include not participating or seeking a developmental evaluation elsewhere. 
All risks and alternatives will be explicitly stated in consent documents.
Potential Study Beneﬁts
There are no direct beneﬁts to participants in this study
. The knowledge gained will inform early 
detection and rehabilitation practices for other children at risk for neuromotor impairment, may lead to 
the development of treatment interventions, and the risk to participants is minimal.

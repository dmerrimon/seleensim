 6 Study Title  TEMPO: A feasibility study of a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -led program for parents 
of extremely preterm infants  
Funder  National Center for Complimentary and Integrative Health  
Clinical Phase  Feasibility 
Study Rationale  The TEMPO program is a structured, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -led PT program developed 
by [CONTACT_366254].  TEMPO trains and 
supports parents to deliver PTIs such as massage and developmental play 
during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_366208].  The goal of this project is 
to assess the feasibility and acceptability of TEMPO for parents of EP 
infants born in the Neonatal Critical Care Center (NCCC) at UNC Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
Study Objective(s)  Aim 1. Evaluate feasibility by [CONTACT_366255] e stimate the following 
population parameters:  
P1 In the target population, the % of eligible dyads who would consent to 
enroll (goal ≥ 55%)  
P2 In the target population, the % of enrolled dyads who would consent to randomization (goal ≥ 70%)  P3 In the tar get population, the % of enrolled dyads who would complete 
all protocol components (goal ≥ 70%)  P4 In the target population, the % of enrolled dyads who would participate for the full 12 months (goal ≥ _70%)  
P5 In the target population, the % of enrolled  dyads who would provide 
complete data and interviews (goal ≥ 70%) and weekly and bi -weekly 
reporting of physical therapy interventions ( goal ≥ 5 0%) 
P6 In the target population, the % of enrolled dyads who would perform physical therapy interventions at least 2 -to-3x/week (goal ≥ 70%)  
 Aim 2. Use results from Aim 1 to refine the TEMPO intervention.  
Aim 3. Use the sample data to estimate of population parameters needed 
for planning a future study; specifically, estimates of means, standard 
deviations, and serial correlations of the distributions of the following 
variables: infant salivary cortisol, parent salivary cortisol, the parent 
questionnaire scor es, and infant CTS and BSID scores.  
Study Design  Prospective single group, non -randomized study  
Subject Population  
key criteria for Inclusion 
and Exclusion:  Inclusion Criteria : Infants with gestational age <[ADDRESS_457859] be able to speak and understand English.  
Exclusion Criteria: In fants who do not have a biological parent available 
to consent within the first 3 weeks of life.  Infants with genetic/chromosomal abnormality, congenital neurological or 
musculoskeletal disorder, or abnormal bone density that would affect the 
ability to do massage and/or exercise and the safety of the infant.  
Parents who are unwilling to engage in all components of TEMPO.  
 
 
 7 Number Of Subjects  30 infant -parent dyads  
Study Duration  Each parent-infant dyad’s participation will last approximately [ADDRESS_457860] approximately 27 -28 months.  
Study Phases  
Screening  
Study Treatment  
Follow -Up   • Screening : Once a PT referral is received for an infant born at <[ADDRESS_457861] and an IRB -approved study team member  will approach the 
biologic mother and/or father of the infant to discuss the study.   
• Intervention: The components of TEMPO are evidence -
 based and 
include infant massage, PTIs including developmental support and play acti vities to promote infant behavioral-motor 
development, principles of family -centered care, and multiple 
modes of educational delivery to enhance parent retention of knowledge and confidence in continuing PTIs after discharge.  
• Fo
llow-Up: Follow -Up after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_366209] [ADDRESS_457862], w ith the assistance of the bedside nurse, will 
monitor vital signs continuously (heart rate, oxygen saturation, and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) during all massage and physical therapy interventions. If the infant demonstrates any of negative responses during massage or PTIs, then the PT will adjust the treatment session accordingly to focus on developmental  support that the infant can tolerate, while continuing to 
educate the parent about their infant’s cues and behavior.  
Statistical And Analytic 
Plan  Because the goal of this study is to assess feasibility and acceptability of 
the TEMPO program, we are not collecting the validated outcome 
measures (eg. Surveys, interview data, and infant motor assessment 
scores) to estimate the effectiveness of TEMPO; rather our goals are to:  
(1) assess the feasibility of completing each measure and  
(
2) estimate the means and standard deviations as the basis for sample 
size calculations for future clinical trials.   
DATA AND SAFETY 
MONITORING PLAN • Independent monitor will review progress reports (patient 
recruitment, retention/attrition, and AEs) quarterly  
• Annual Report sent to Independent Monitor  
• Copy of Annual Report and Independent Monitor’s recommendations sent to NCCIH annually  
• The PI [INVESTIGATOR_366210] a weekly basis to ensure data collection from study subjects is complete.  
• Participant confidentiality is strictly held in trust by [CONTACT_473], study staff, and the sponsor(s) and their agents.  
 
 
[ADDRESS_457863] Education and Massage for Parent -Infant Outcomes program (TEMPO) is a structured, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -led PT 
program developed by [CONTACT_366254].  TEMPO trains and supports parents to deliver PTIs 
such as massage and develop mental play during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_366208].  The goal of this project is to 
assess the feasibility and acceptability of TEMPO for parents of EP infants born in the Neonatal Critical Care Center 
(NCCC) at UNC Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 
There are several innovative aspects to this research.  First, the TEMPO program enhances standard care by [CONTACT_366256][INVESTIGATOR_541] -parent interactions to increase the parent’s comfort level with administering 
massage and developmental activities with their EP infant.  In standard care, parent education during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_366211], does not include infant massage, does not use supplementary written 
materials or resources, and does not include check-ins with a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_206269] -discharge.  Second, this project will recruit 
parents of infants <[ADDRESS_457864] not only in educating and supporting parents of EP 
infants, but in developi[INVESTIGATOR_366212]/integrative health approaches in unique patient populations. Finally, once TEMPO is further developed it can be adapted to evaluate ot her complementary/integrative 
health approaches for the EP population and other high -risk infant populations (e.g., neonatal drug withdrawal, infants 
with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy). 
  
1.[ADDRESS_457865] Education and Massage for Parent -Infant Outcomes progr am is  evidence-based and includes infant 
massage,1,8,9 PTIs including developmental support and play activities to promote infant behavioral -motor 
development,5,6 principles of family-centered care,5 and multiple modes of educational delivery6 to enhance parent 
retention of knowledge, parent -infant bonding,  and confidence in continuing PTIs after discharge.  TEMPO includes 
these components:  
• Early Parent Education Session  
• Weekly Parent Education Sessions  
• Infant Massage Par ent Education Sessions  
• Discharge Parent Education Session  
• Parent Education Post-Discharge   
• Bi-weekly emails  
• 2 Month Follow -up Massage Review Session  
 
1.3 Non-Clinical and Clinical Study Findings  
Potential Benefits related to TEMPO intervention:  
 Parent becoming more comfortable touching, holding, and playing with your infant from a very young age 
during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 Parent feeling confident in your ability to read your infant’s body language and needs as they change during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
 Increased opportunities for infant -parent bonding  
 
 
 9  Learning how to perform infant massage with your infant which has many benefits for parent (eg. reducing stress and depression) and for infant (eg. gaining weight and staying calm)  
 Parent m ay develop a strong relationship with the therapy team in the NCCC and will receive weekly updates 
about your infant’s motor progress  
 Parent will continue to receive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_366213]  
 Parent will receive a one-on -one infant massage review session after discharge home  
 Parent will have the opportunity to reflect on sense of parent competence during the first year of infant’s life 
 
Risks related to TEMPO intervention:   
• Infant autonomic instability/stress, discomfort,  or skin reaction as a result of Vaseline or Aquaphor during the 
massage session  
• Inconvenience or stress to parents from weekly meetings with therapi[INVESTIGATOR_102752]/or completion of questionnaires  
• Psychological distress of parents when learning about preterm development or if the infant does not have a positive response to massage  
• Breach of confidentiality if emails are seen by [CONTACT_366257], or if data from the medical record 
is breached  
 
 
1.4 Relevant Literature and Data  
Physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (PTs) play a major, but often unrecognized role, in supporting extremely preterm (EP)  infants and 
their parents through non -pharmacologic and developmentally -supportive care during and after long- term hospi[INVESTIGATOR_67550].   While there is strong evidence to support that physical therapy interventions (PTIs) improve, or even cure, a 
number of pediatric conditions (e.g. torticollis), there is little data demonstrating how PTIs done in the NICU setting 
influence outcomes in EP infants or whether there is benefit to parents  continuing PTIs after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  In 
addition, the clinical experience of the applicant suggests that parents can be taught how to do PTIs with their infant and doing so may be an important contributor to increasing parent confidence in taking ca re of their infant.  This is especially 
important because parents of EP infants experience a challenging transition to parenthood and often experience increased levels of stress, depression, and fear of incompetence in caring for their child compared to pa rents of non -EP 
infants.
[ADDRESS_457866] motor outcomes of the infant.4   
The extra -uterine environment presents significant challenges for infants born extremely preterm (EP). In the NCCU, 
physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_366214] -motor effects of preterm birth.
5 This presents a unique opportunity for PTs to foster parental 
involvement in their infant’s care by [CONTACT_366258]’s behavioral cues and to facilitate their infant’s motor development through techn iques such as massage.
6  Massage has been shown to be safe,1 is 
associated with many benefits for EP infants,7 and has been shown to be beneficial in decreasing parent depression1 and 
anxiety.8,9  However, the applicant’s clinical experience is that despi[INVESTIGATOR_366215], parents do not regularly continue this practice.  Because of the potential benefits to parents in terms of decreased stress, anxiety and an increased sense of parent-infant bonding, there is a critical need to find more 
feasible ways to teach and support parents to deliver massage and other PTIs throughout the infant’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_366216] -discharge. TEMPO has been developed to address this need.   
 
Established V alidity for Scales and Evaluation Tools  
 
 
 
 10 Parent Measures  
• Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM): A 12 item implementation outcome assessment designed to measure if 
the intervention is perceived as agreeable, palatable, or satisfactory.11 
• Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM): A 9 item implementation outcome assessment designed ot measure the extent to which a new treatment can be successfully used or carried out.
11 
• Patient- Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Adult  Profile Short Form - Anxiety:  The 
PROMIS Anxiety short form is a valid and reliable measurement tool used to assess self -reported fear, anxious 
misery, hyperarousal, and somatic symptoms related to arousal.12 
• C enters for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_6328] (CESD): A valid, reliable self -assessment tool for evaluating 
depressive symptoms in adult populations, including among mothers during and after parturition.13 The CESD 20 -
item scale will be used.  
• Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS): A 10-it e m self -report questionnaire validated to detect change in 
depressive symptoms in mothers both during and after the postnatal period.[ADDRESS_457867] been 
correlated with scores of infant temperament as measured by [CONTACT_366259], and shown to improve with massage.
13  
• Parenting Sense of Competence Scale (PSOC): A  17-item scale to assess satisfaction of parenting and parental self -
efficacy in a variety of populations,15 with higher scores indicating a greater sense of parental self -efficacy.  
• Postnatal Attachment Questionnaire (PAQ):  A  postnatal questionnaire with 4 components: pleasure in proximity, 
tolerance, need-gratification and protection, and knowledge acquisition  designed to query the parents’ feelings 
about their infants under 1 year of age.16 This questionnaire is associated with the Attachment Q-set (ASQ), an 
observational assessment of infant -parent bonding.16 
• Salivary Cortisol: S alivary cortisol is a biomarke r for stress.17 Salivary cortisol concentrations (ng/dl)  may be used to 
understand the mechanism by [CONTACT_366260].

• Sa livary Cortisol: Salivary cortisol is a biomarker for stress.17 Salivary cortisol concentrations (ng/dl)  may be used to 
understand the mechanism by [CONTACT_366260].  
• Carey Temperament Scales (CTS): T his questionnaire assesses nine temperamental characteristics of infants. 
Caregivers are p resented with a statement describing a certain behavior and asked to rate how often their child 
behaves in that way on a scale from 1 (almost never) to 6 (almost always), with higher scores indicating more 
difficult temperament.13  
• Bayley Scales of Infant Motor Development -III (BSID -III): A standardized assessment to evaluate cognitive 
development, expressive and receptive language, and fine and gross motor development in children between the 
ages of [ADDRESS_457868] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_366217]’s feasibility as assessed by:  
P1 In the target population, the % of eligible dya ds who would consent to enroll (goal ≥ 55%)  
P2 In the target population, the % of enrolled dyads who would consent to randomization (goal ≥ 70%)  
P3 In the target population, the % of enrolled dyads who would complete all protocol components (goal ≥ 70%)  
P4 In the target population, the % of enrolled dyads who would participate for the full 12 months (goal ≥ _70%)  
P5 In the target population, the % of enrolled dyads who would provide complete data collection and interviews (goal ≥ 
 
 
 11 70%) and weekly and bi -weekly reporting of physical therapy interventions ( goal ≥ 5 0%) 
P6 In the target population, the % of enrolled dyads who would perform physical therapy interventions at least 2 -
3x/week (goal ≥ 70%)  
 
Secondary Objective s 
Based on the quantitative and qualitative data from Aim 1, refine TEMPO to facilitate parent -admini stered physical 
therapy and massage during neonatal intensive care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_157452].  
Additionally, we will use the sample data to estimate of population parameters needed for planning a future study; 
specifically, estimates of means, standard deviations, and serial correlations of the distributions of the following 
variables: infant salivary cortisol, parent salivary cortisol, the parent questionnaire scores, and infant CTS and BSID scores.  
 
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 Study Design  
Type of design: This is a prospective single group, non -randomized study designed to determine the feasibility and 
acceptability of TEMPO.  The TEMPO program as part of this study would be offered in addition to standard of care 
physical therapy interventio n in the NCCC. Standard of care physical therapy in the NCCC involves 1 -2 PT sessions 
weekly, spontaneous (unplanned) parent education as the parent is available in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and follow up outpatient 
clinic visits with a PT.  
Screening /Baseline:  
The recruitment process with the parents will be initiated once the physical therapy referral has been made by [CONTACT_47806]. The neonatology provider team will receive an introduction to the study from the PI (McCarty) and 
chief neonatologist/gra nt mentor (O’Shea) prior to study initiation. All infants who meet eligibility criteria for the study 
also receive standard physical therapy orders in the Newborn Critical Care Center (NCCC). A physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_366218] a certain age and weight. The physical therapy referral is received when the infant is clinically stable and 
thus should avoid the initial parent distress and need for orientation after the birth and admission to the NCCC.  Once a 
PT referral is received for an infant  born at <[ADDRESS_457869] and an 
IRB-approved member of the study team will approach the biologic mother and/or father of the infant to discuss the 
study.  In order to ensure that parents have sufficient time to consider participation, the study team member  will 
contact [CONTACT_366261]. The study team member  will offer to leave the consent document with the parent(s).  An IRB-approved 
member of the study team will always be available to  answer any questions related to the informed consent, and if they 
express interested in participating, then informed consent will be obtained.     
 
Intervention/Treatment  and Follow up: Please see Table 1 and Figure 1 below  for information  regarding the timing and 
sequence of intervention and follow up.  Additional detail regarding the study intervention can be found in sections 4 
and 7 .

Study Duration:  
 
Enrollment and Number of Subjects: The study will be conducted in the Neonatal Critical Care Center at UNC Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_366219] 100 EP infants (<28 weeks gestation) are born each year. Of these infants, approximately 
75% will survive, and approximately 57 of these infants will meet eligibility criteria. Our goal is to enroll 55% of eligible 
infants -parent dyads, and therefore our proposed sample size is 30 dyads, but will enroll up to 40 dyads over the period 
of 12 months. 

 
 
 13 3.3 Study Population  
Inclusion Criteria: Infants with gestational age <[ADDRESS_457871] be able to speak and understand English.  
Exclusion Criteria: Inf ants who do not have a biologic al parent available to consent within the first 3 weeks of life.  
Infants with genetic/chromosomal abnormality, congenital neurological or musculoskeletal disorder, or abnormal bone 
density  related to a congenital condition  that would affect the ability to  do massage and/or exercise and the safety of 
the infant.  Parents who are unwilling to engage in all components of TEMPO. 
4 STUDY PROCEDURES  
4.1 Screening/Baseline Visit procedures  
At the baseline visit, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_366220] (as described in section 7 , Early Parent Education), and 
the parent will complete baseline surveys (as described in section 1.4) on the study iPad. While both parents may elect 
to receive t raining in the intervention, they will be asked to designate one parent who is the most likely to perform the 
intervention after discharge and this same parent should complete all the parent interviews and questionnaires.  Please see Table 1: Study Events and Figure 1: Study Scheme in the Appendix for a complete timeline.  
4.2 Intervention/Treatment procedures  (by [CONTACT_41995])  
The TEMPO program involves components during and after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
During infant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• Visit 1: Early Parent Education Session:  Initiated within [ADDRESS_457872] the parent fill out the following questionnaires for baseline 
measurement: AIM, FIM, PROMI S, CESD, EPDS, PSOC  
o The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_366221] a contact [CONTACT_366262] a demographic form.  
• Visits 2 -8: Weekly Parent Education Sessions  <34 weeks : Following the initial parent education session, the PT 
will hold weekly parent education sessions, ideally at the time of therapy. When the infant is this young (<3 4 
weeks gestation), PT intervention and education will focus on infant behavioral -motor cue s, reading/response to 
infant cues, positioning strategies/concerns, and developmentally appropriate stimulation of the infant. If the parent is not available for all therapy sessions, then the parent will receive a weekly update about their infant’s 
progr ess face -to-face and/or via video chat.  
o Parents will be asked to record the frequency of physical therapy interventions on a bedside card.  
• Visits 9 -10: Infant Massage Parent Education Sessions:  Parent-administered infant massage will be 
incorporated into the therapy plan of care as soon as the infant’s medical provider determines that the infant is 
physiologically stable and can tolerate massage.  This time is generally once the infant is approxi mately [ADDRESS_457873] salivary cortisol via buccal 
swab as a measure of physiologic stress.  
• Visits 11+: Weekly Parent Education Sessions  >34 weeks : Weekly parent education once the infant is >34 weeks 
will begin to incorporate hands -on developmental play activities, introduction to visual engagement, and 
postural control practice in variety of positions that the infant tolerates. Additionally, the PT and parent may 
choose to review massage at these visits. If the parent is not available for all therapy sessions, then the parent will receive a weekly update about their infant’s progress face-to -face and/or via video chat.  
o Parents will be asked to recor d the frequency of physical therapy interventions on a bedside card.  
• Final Visit during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] : Within the week of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], the PT will schedule a face -to-face 
parent education session lasting about [ADDRESS_457874] the parent fill out the following questionnaires for ongoing measurement: AIM, FIM, PROMIS , CESD, EPDS, PSOC  (Aim 1).  
 
4.3 Follow- up procedures (by [CONTACT_41995])  
The TEMPO program has additional components that extend beyond the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_366222]. Parent and infant outcome 
measures will be collected at the first follow -up and 12 month corrected age follow -up clinic visits. Please see Table 1: 
Study Events and Figure 1: Study Scheme in the Appendix for a complete timeline. 
After hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:  
• Visit 1:  Parent Education Post -Discharge:  The PT will call the parent within [ADDRESS_457875] email and pager information will be provided.  
• Visits 2 -12 (approximate): Bi-weekly emails:  The PT will send bi -weekly emails with developmental play activity and 
massage reminders and tips from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_366223].   
o These emails will include a link for parents to report frequency of PT intervention and mas sage at home.  
• Visit 13 (approximate):  First Visit  Follow-up Massage Review Session:  At the infant’s first  follow-up appointment 
with the multidisciplinary neonatology team, the PT will provide a gross motor screening assessment  and education. 
In addition, as part of the TEMPO program, a PT will facilitate a parent-administered infant massage session to 
provide an opportunity for parent to receive feedback on technique from the PT. This session will address any safety 
concerns, infant changes, a nd parent questions.  
o At this visit, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_366224]: AIM, FIM, PROMIS , CESD, EPDS, PSOC  
o At this visit, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_366225].  
• Visits 14+ (approximate): Bi-weekly emails:  The PT will continue to send bi -weekly emails with developmental play 
activity and massage reminders until the 12 month follow  up appointment.   
o These emails will include a link for parents to report frequency of PT intervention and massage at home.  
• 12 Month Follow -up Appointmen t: At the standard of care  12 month corrected age follow-up appointment with the 
multidisciplinary neonatology team, the PT will administer a standardized asse ssment of gross and fine motor skills 
(Bayley Scales of Infant Development -III). 
o At this visit, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_366226]:  AIM, FIM, PROMIS , CESD, EPDS, PSOC  (Aim 1)  
 
 
 15 o Additionally, the parent will complete the PAQ questionnaire. (Aim 1)  
o At this visit, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_366227]. (Aim 1, Aim 2)  
 
4.[ADDRESS_457876] Completion/ Withdrawal procedures  
The study staff will inform the subject when his/her participation has come to an end and will document the discussion 
in the study record. If the infant is transferred to an outside hospi[INVESTIGATOR_366228], then the parents will be 
asked to complete the parent measures ( PROMIS , CESD, EPDS, PSOC) at that time instead of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. If the 
parent  chooses to withdraw their infant for any reason, the parent does not have to complete the above measures.  
An infant may no longer participate in the study under any of the following circumstances:  
 
• The medical condition of the infant deteriorates and the medical team no longer recommends PT or massage 
• The infant experiences a severe AE or SAE related to the intervention 
• The Parent is no longer interested in participating  
 
In the event that an infant has an AE related to massage medium (Aquaphor), then mass age will be performed without 
the medium once the skin has healed.

Variables that will be abstracted from medical charts : 
o Infant:  
o Name  
o Date of birth  
o Gestational age at birth  
o Birth weight  
o Race/ethnicity  
o Salivary Cortisol (post -salivary swab 
test)  o Parent:

Parent Measures  
• Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM): A 12 item implementation outcome assessment designed to measure if the intervention is perceived as agreeable, palatable, or satisfactory.  
• Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM): A 9 item implementation outcome assessment designed ot measure the extent to which a new treatment can be successfully used or carried out.  
• Patient- Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Adult Profile Short Form - Anxiety:  The 
PROMIS Anxiety short form is a valid a nd reliable measurement tool used to assess self -reported fear, anxious 
misery, hyperarousal, and somatic symptoms related to arousal. 
• C
enters for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_6328] (CESD): The CESD 20 -item scale will be used.  
• Edinburgh Postnatal Depr ession Scale (EPDS): A 10-item self -report questionnaire validated to detect change in 
depressive symptoms in mothers both during and after the postnatal period.  
• Parenting Sense of Competence Scale (PSOC): Thi s measure will be used to assess change in the parent’s sense of 
competence in caring for their infant throughout the study period.  
 
 
 16 • Postnatal Attachment Questionnaire (PAQ):  This questionnaire is associated with the Attachment Q-set (ASQ), an 
observational assessment of infant -parent bonding, and wil l serve as a measure of the parent emotional component 
of infant-parent bonding in the follow -up stage of the study period.   
• Salivary Cortisol: S alivary cortisol is a biomarker for stress. Salivary cortisol concentrations (ng/dl)  may be used to 
understand the mechanism by [CONTACT_366260]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_366229]’s buccal mucosa immediately pre- and post- massage at the first massage education session.  
• Parent Interview: The  parent who performed the study intervention will be interviewed at the  first follow-up visit 
and the [ADDRESS_457877]-discharge.  For example:  what they liked or disliked about the program, how often they did massage and for how long, did they find 
the massage easy to do on an ongoing basis, do they have suggestions to improve feasibility? We will also ask about 
willingness to have participated in this study if it were a randomized trial. This information will be critical to develop the planned trial (Aim 1 and 2). For example, should a parent not be willing to be randomized, the trial may need to 
randomize at some level other than individual infants/parents (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6879] a waitlist control condition). 
 
 
In
fant Measures  
• Sa livary Cortisol: Salivary cortisol will be collected by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_366230] - and post -massage at the 
first massage education session.  
• Carey Temperament Scales (CTS): T his questionnaire assesses Infant temperament to better  understand if  infant  
temperament may be influenced by [CONTACT_366263] -infant bonding.   
• Bayley Scales of Infant Motor Development - III (BSID -III): A standardized assessment  provided by a developmental 
specialist (physical or occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_366231]) to evaluate cognitive development, expressive and 
receptive language, and fine and gross motor development in children between the ages of 1 month and 42 months.  
 
5.1 Safety Evaluations  
The infant will be monitored for safety throughout all PT sessions. With the assistance of the bedside nurse, vital signs 
will be monitored continuously (heart rate, oxygen saturation, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) during all massage and physical therapy interventions. The massage or PTIs will be stopped if the infant’s heart rate exceeds 200 beats per minute, if the 
infant’s oxygen saturation drops <90%, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_366232] [ADDRESS_457878] the treatment session accordingly to focus on developmental support that the infant can tolerate, while 
continuing to educate the parent about their infant’s cues and behavior. 
 Prior to the parent education for massage session, the PT will test a small area of the infant’s skin (likely on the lower le g 
or back) to assess any negative skin reaction to Aquaphor, the medium used for massage. If after [ADDRESS_457879] be administered by [CONTACT_366264]’s tolerance prior to the parent education for massage session.  
 
 
 17 The study team will generate Study Reports for the Independent Monitor and will provide information on the following study parameters:  screened and enrolled parent -infant dyads, unanticipated, serious adverse events, missed study visits 
and dyads that are lost to follow-up.   
 
[ADDRESS_457880] feasibility and acceptability 
of the TEMPO program and study protocol  (Aim 1) .  As such, the analysis plan will not focus on inferential statistics but 
on meas ures of feasibility identified in the NCCIH’s Framework for Developi[INVESTIGATOR_366233]10 
(https://nccih.nih.gov/grants/mindbody/framework):

• Willingness to be randomized:  Percentage of enrolled parents who, in interviews, report they would agree to be 
randomized (Goal > 70%)  
• TEMPO delivered per protocol:  Percenta ge of enrolled parents who complete all TEMPO components per protocol 
(Goal >70%)  and weekly and bi -weekly reporting of physical therapy interventions (goal ≥ 50%) . 
• Retention : Percentage of enrolled parents who are retained in the study at 12 months (Goal > 70%), reasons for 
attrition for those who do not complete the protocol  
• Complete data collection:  Percentage of enrolled parents who complete data collection, including interviews 
(Goal >70%)

trials to evaluate TEMPO  (Aim 2).  
 
Although validated outcome measures will be collected in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_366235], these variables will not be incorporated in the statistical analyses of outcomes. Collection of the validated measu res will also be used to select a sample size for a full study (Aim 3 ). We anticipate this data will be used to develop

7 STUDY INTERVENTION  
• Early Parent Education Session:  Initiated within [ADDRESS_457884] of prematurity on the motor and sensory systems, and how to 
read and respond to infant behavioral -motor cues5 using a written pamphlet with pi[INVESTIGATOR_366240] 30 minutes.  
• Weekly Parent Education Sessions  <34 weeks : Following the initial parent education session, the PT will hold 
weekly parent education sessions, ideally at t he time of therapy. When the infant is this young (<3 4 weeks 
gestation), PT intervention and education will focus on infant behavioral-motor cues, reading/response to infant 
cues, positioning strategies/concerns, and developmentally appropriate stimulation of the infant. If the parent is 
not available for all therapy sessions, then the parent will receive a weekly update about their infant’s progress 
face -to-face and/or via video chat.  
• Infant Massage Parent Education Sessions: Parent-administered infant massage will be incorporated into the 
therapy plan of care as soon as the infant’s medical provider determines that the infant is physiologically stable and can tolerate massage. At a minimum, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_366241] 
2 parent education sessions – one early session in the isolette (if necessary) and one later session out of the 
isolette. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_366242] a doll using verbal cues to guide the parent while the parent administers massage on the infant. An instructional massage pamphlet will be provided. The massage 
intervention is comprised of moderately firm effleurage strokes on the extremities for periods of 10 -20 minutes 
followed by [CONTACT_366265]. Use of upper or lower body swaddle, pacifier, and room 
darkening may be necessary to achieve positive infant responses during massage. 
• Visits 11+: We ekly Parent Education Sessions >34 weeks: Weekly parent education once the infant is >34 weeks 
will begin to incorporate hands -on developmental play activities, introduction to visual engagement, and 
postural control practice in variety of positions that t he infant tolerates. Additionally, the PT and parent may 
choose to review massage at these visits. If the parent is not available for all therapy sessions, then the parent will receive a weekly update about their infant’s progress face -to-face and/or via video chat.  
• Discharge Parent Education Session:  Within the week of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], the PT will schedule a face- to-face 
parent education session lasting about [ADDRESS_457885] email and pager information will be provided.  
o Additional Physical Therapy Intervention Description:  Age appropriate physical therapy interventions 
and developmental play activities will be taught to parents during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_366243]. These activities may include but are not limited to: Prone 
positioning to develop head, neck, and shoulder strength, supi[INVESTIGATOR_366244] -cake and leg 
bicycles to promote flexion of the trunk and extremities against gravity, visual tracking activities to promote symmetrical movement of the neck/head, and supported sitting activities in the parent’s lap to 
promote postural control.  
• Parent Education Post-Discharge:  The PT will call the parent within [ADDRESS_457886] email and p ager information will be 
provided.  
• 2 Month Follow -up Massage Review Session:  At the standard of care 2-month follow -up appointment with the 
multidisciplinary neonatology team, the PT will provide a gross motor screening assessment and education. In 
additi on, as part of the TEMPO program, a PT will facilitate a parent -administered infant massage session to 
provide an opportunity for parent to receive feedback on technique from the PT. This session will address any safety concerns, infant changes, and parent  questions. 
• Bi-weekly emails:  The PT will continue to send bi -weekly emails with developmental play activity and massage 
reminders until the 12 month follow -up appointment.   
• 12 Month Follow -up Appointment : At the standard of care 12 month follow-up appointment with the 
multidisciplinary neonatology team, the PT will administer a standardized assessment of gross and fine motor skills (Bayley Scales of Infant Development 3).  
 
8 SAFETY MANAGEMENT  
This study will be stopped prior to its completion if: (1) the intervention is associated with AEs that call into question the 
safety of the intervention in infants <28 weeks gestational age; (2) significantly lower study recruitment or retention 
than expected that will impact the ability to evaluate fea sibility of TEMPO.  
Definitions  
Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during participation in the clinical study or with use of the experimental agent being studied. An adverse finding can include a sign, symptom, abnormal assessment 
(laboratory test value, vital signs, electrocardiogram finding, etc.), or any combination of these regardless of relationship  
to participation in the study.  
Unanticipated Problems (UP)  
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or 
others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are described in 
the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and informed consent document; 
and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
• Rela ted or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable 
possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_32015]); and 
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, 
economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. 
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is one that meets one or more of the following criteria:  
 
 
 21 • Results in death  
• Is life-threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred)  
• Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect   
An important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80895], based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -Up 
An independent monitor has been identified to review enrollment, UPs, and AEs. The study team will send the 
independent monitor a report on enrollment every 4 months, with the expectation that the independent monitor will 
provide input on enrollment within 30 days. UPs and AEs will be reported to the independent monitor within 24 hours with the expectation that the independent monitor will provide input on UPs and/or AEs within 5 days.  
 
Characteristics of an Adverse Event  
 
Relationship to Study Intervention  
The potential event relationship to the study intervention and/or participation is assessed by [CONTACT_6962]. A 
comprehensive scale in common use to categorize an event is:  
• Definitely Related :  The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational agent/procedure – i.e. an event 
that fol lows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study intervention, follows a known 
or expected response pattern to the suspected intervention, that is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_366245]’s clinical state.  
• Possibly Related:  An adverse event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
study intervention follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected intervention, but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors. 
• Not Related:   The adverse event is clearly not related to the investigational agent/procedure - i.e. another 
cause of the event is most plausible; and/or a clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the event and the study intervention and/or a causal relationship is considered biologically implausible.  
 
Expectedness of SAEs  
Massage has been studied extensiv ely in infant born at less than 32 weeks gestation, and reported AEs in the literature 
are rare. Massage has not been studied as extensively in the extremely preterm infant population (<28 weeks gestation), so we will monitor infant heart rate and respi[INVESTIGATOR_366246], and temperature 
before and after intervention, as outlined in section 5.1  “Safety Evaluations”  section. These risks are addressed in the 
informed consent document. The study PI, infant’s medical team, and the independent monitor will review any AE to 
 
 
 22 determine if it is expected or unexpected based on characteristics of the event and risk information previously described in the literature.  
Severity of Event  
The following scale will be used to grade adverse events:  
1. Mild: no intervention required; no impact on infant’s routine care  
2. Moderate: minimal, local, or non-invasive intervention indicated; moderate impact on infant’s routine care 
3. Severe: significant symptoms requiring invasive intervention; infant requires additional medical attention, significant impact on infant’s routine care 
Reporting Procedures  
Information previously unknown to the UNC IRB that suggests new or increased risk to subjects or others is promptly reportable to OHRE within 7 calendar days  of the investigator becoming aware of the information.  
Reporting for Multi -Center Trials  
 This is a single site study.  
Unanticipated Problem Reporting  
All UPs will be recorded using an “unanticipated problem report form” which will include the following information:  
• Appropriate identifying information for the research protocol, such as the title, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
number;  
• A detailed description of the UP;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the adverse event, incident,  experience, or outcome represents 
an unanticipated problem;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or are proposed in 
response to the unanticipated problem.  
To satisfy the requirement for prompt repo rting, unanticipated problems will be reported as follows:   
• Unanticipated problems that are serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB, Independent Monitor, and NCCIH within 24 hours of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_223305].  
 
Adverse Event Reporting   
 
SAEs that are unanticipated, serious, and possibly related to the study intervention will be reported to the Independent 
Monitor, IRB, and NCCIH in accordance with requirements.   
 
 
 23 • Unexpected fatal or life -threatening AEs related to the intervention will be reported to the NCCIH Program 
Officer, and Independent Safety Monitor(s) within 3 days of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  Other serious and unexpected AEs related to the intervention will be reported within 7 days. 
• Anticipated or unrelat ed SAEs will be handled in a less urgent manner but will be reported to the Independent 
Safety Monitor(s), IRB, and other oversight organizations in accordance with their requirements. and will be reported to NCCIH on an annual basis.    
• All other AEs docu mented during the course of the trial will be reported to NCCIH on an annual basis by [CONTACT_366266].  The Independent Safety Monitor(s) Rep ort will state that all AEs have been reviewed.  
Halting Rules  
  An infant may no longer participate in the study under any of the following circumstances:  
 
• The medical condition of the infant deteriorates and the medical team no longer recommends PT or massage  
• The infant experiences a severe AE or SAE related to the intervention 
• The Parent is no longer interested in participating  
 In the event that an infant has an AE related to massage medium (Aquaphor), then massage will be performed without 
the medium  or with a medium approved by [CONTACT_366267]
. 
 
 
 
9 DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGE MENT   
 
Data Monitoring  
 
Study progress and safety will be reviewed on a monthly basis or more frequently as needed. Progress reports, including patient recruitment, retention/attrition, and AEs will be provided to the Independent Monitor quarterly.  An Annual Report will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_45186] a list and summary of AEs.  In addition, the Annual Report will address (1) 
whether AE rates are consistent with pre -study assumptions; (2) reason for dropouts from the study; (3) whether all 
participants met eligibility criteria; (4) whether continuation of the study is justified on the basis that additional data are 
needed to accomplish the stated aims of the study; and (5) conditions whereby [CONTACT_72771].  The Annual Report will be sent to the Independent  Monitor and a copy of the Annual Report with the 
independent monitor’s recommendations and comments will be forwarded the NCCIH Program Officer within one 
month following.   
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_366210] a weekly basis to ensure data  collection from study subjects is 
complete. This includes vitals  (heart rate, oxygen saturation, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_109651]) during PTIs and salivary cortisol 
concentrations (ng/dl) documented in the medical chart , weekly parent reports of bedside PTIs,  bi-weekly parent 
reports of home PTIs, and completeness of any questionnaires given to parents at various points in the TEMPO protocol. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_366247].  
 
Data on adherence to the TEMPO protocol will be reported by [CONTACT_366268] a form at the infant’s bedside. This data 
will be collected weekly by [CONTACT_361335].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_366248]’s bedside. At each 
weekly parent education session, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_366249]. If the 
parents are unable to meet the frequency, then barriers to this will be recorded by [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_366250]. 
 
 
 24 No data exists on the frequency of the use of massage and physical therapy interventions at the bedside and at home, 
but we anticipate that 70% of parents will perform massage and/or physical therapy interventions 2 -3x/week at the 
bedside and at home.  If adherence falls below the suggested rate, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_366251].  
The data will be collected and managed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_115292]. They should ensure that parent surveys are 
recorded accurately, completely, and in a timely manner. All surveys will be completed digitally on an iPad to ensure accurate interpretation of data.  
Data Management and Confidentiality  
Data collection and accurate documentation are the responsibility of  the study staff under the supervision of the PI.  All 
source documents and laboratory reports must be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or study coordinator, who will ensure that they are accurate and complete.  Unanticipated problems and adverse events must be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_874] [ADDRESS_457887] by [CONTACT_473], study staff, and the sponsor(s) and their agents.  
The investigators are responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported. All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data. The investigators will maintain adequate case histories of study participants, including accurate case report forms (CRFs), and source documentation.   
Data collection and accurate documentation are the responsibility of the study staff under the supervision of the investigator. All source documents will be reviewed by [CONTACT_366269], who will ensure that they 
are accurate and complete. Unanticipated problems must be reviewed by [CONTACT_1719].   
A web -based data management system will be built in REDCap for use in for this study. This data management syste m 
provides all of the capabilities required for research data management, including: data transfer, data entry, data validation, database updating, database closure, data retrieval, data inventory, security and confidentiality, and archiving. This database  is virtually encrypted.  The database will be secured with password protection. Information that 
is entered into the database will be coded using study identification numbers.  Any electronic communication with 
outside collaborators (e.g. Independent Moni tor) will involve only unidentifiable information. The database incorporates 
an electronic audit trail to show change(s) to data after original entry including the date/time and user making the 
change.  
 Direct data entry, where data initially are entered o n the screen without having completed a paper form first, will be 
used when possible; otherwise, paper forms will be utilized and the data will be entered into the REDCap database by a research assistant.  
REDCap is housed on a secure, climate -controlled s erver. UNC has in place an IT Security Plan as required by [CONTACT_366270].  As part of the plan, the principle of least access privilege for study files is implemented.  Included in the plan are a risk assessment, a system continuity plan, and a disaster recovery plan.  Support for REDCap services is provided by [CONTACT_366271], the Clinical and Translational Science Award center at UNC -CH.   
Data confidentiality and security measures will be applied at all levels of TEMPO data acquisition,  transfer and storage. 
REDCap meets exacting data management standards of confidentiality, as well as HIPAA requirements. Beyond the password -controlled access to REDCap, data are encrypted by [CONTACT_366272] -
screen by [CONTACT_21575]. Personal identifiers are collected on separate forms as an additional safeguard against linking of identifiers and medical information.  
Enrollment and other data management reports will be available from the REDCap database.  Monthly reports on study enrollment, intervention, unexpected events, and adverse events will be provided to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238] 
 
 
 [ADDRESS_457888] three years from the date that the grant federal financial report (FFR) is submitted to the NIH.   
 
10 RECRUITMENT STRATEGY  
The recruitment process with the parents will be initiated once the physical therapy referral has been made by [CONTACT_47806]. The neonatology provider team will receive an introduction to the study from the PI (McCarty) and 
chief neonatologist/gra nt mentor (O’Shea) prior to study initiation. All infants who meet eligibility criteria for the study 
also receive standard physical therapy orders in the Newborn Critical Care Center (NCCC). A physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_366218] a certain age and weight. The physical therapy referral is received when the infant is clinically stable and 
thus should avoid the initial parent distress and need for orientation after the birth and admission to the NCCC.  In order 
to ensure that parents have sufficient time to consider participation, the study coordinator will contact [CONTACT_366273]. The study 
coordinator will offer to leave the consent document with the parent(s).  Once parents feel they have had adequate 
time to review the informed consent, the informed consent process will proceed.     
 
[ADDRESS_457889].  
 
12 PLANS FOR PUBLICATION  
At the conclusion of the study period, the data will be analyzed and reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_36749]. A manuscript 
will be drafted and submitted to a multidisciplinary neonatal -perinatal medicine journa l in order to reach a variety of 
audiences.

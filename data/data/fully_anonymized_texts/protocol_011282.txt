Acne arises from a combination of physiological changes in the skin including altered sebaceous 
gland cell differentiation, heightened sebum production, localized bacterial colonization and 
inflammation. Although acne is generally viewed as a benign dermatological disease of 
adolescence, more severe forms may lead to permanent scar formation, with some of these 
patients suffering from psychological injury and significant loss of self-worth. Recent scientific 
advances in the understanding of the complex multi-factorial nature of this common disease offer 
great opportunity for scientific innovation through selective targeting of key elements of the 
disease process. 
Sebum is a waxy/oily substance comprised of cholesterol, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, triglycerides 
(T
Gs), wax esters, sterol esters and squalene produced by [CONTACT_294716] [ 1]. Sebaceous 
g
lands are associated with hair follicles. The basal layer of sebocytes just inside the basement 
membrane consists of small, nucleated cells devoid of lipid droplets. This layer contains the 
dividing cells that replenish the gland as cells are lost in the process of holocrine rupture. As 
c
ells move from the basal layer towards the center of the gland, they differentiate and produce 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_294688]. Eventually the cells become distended with lipid droplets and 
the nuclei and other sub-cellular structures disappear. As the cells approach the sebaceous duct, 
they disintegrate and release their contents through holocrine secretion. In acne, diglycerides and 
free fatty acid levels may be increased by [CONTACT_716081]. Free fatty acids may promote inflammatory response in acne by [CONTACT_294717]-inflammatory factors. 
A direct correlation between the degree of acne improvement and the extent of sebum reduction 
produced by [CONTACT_294718]-acne medications has been established [ 2]. The oral retinoid 
13-cis-retinoic acid (13-cis-RA, Accutane ) is particularly effective at reducing sebum 
output
 although its mode-of-action is not likely related to a direct effect on sebum synthesis 
pa
thways [ 3]. 
Topic
al agents routinely prescribed for acne, including antibiotics, retinoids and combinations 
thereof, often produce only modest therapeutic benefits and do not affect sebum production. A 
locally-delivered medication that selectively inhibited sebum formation would represent a 
breakthrough advance in reducing the pathogenic influences of sebum overproduction in acne. 
Acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylases (ACCs) have crucial roles in fatty acid metabolism in humans 
and most other living organisms [ 4]. ACC catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to form 
malonyl-CoA. This is the first committed step in fatty acid biosynthesis and is the rate limiting 
reaction for the pathway [ 5, 6, 7]. These fatty acids then can be stored or converted to 
trig
lycerides (TGs) and phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]. In addition to its role as a substrate in fatty acid 
biosynthesis, malonyl-CoA, also plays an important regulatory role in controlling mitochondrial 
fatty acid uptake through allosteric inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I), the 
enzyme catalyzing the first committed step in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation [ 8]. Malonyl-
C
oA, therefore, is a key metabolic signal for the control of fatty acid production and utilization 
in response to dietary changes and altered nutritional requirements in animals [ 6]. As a result of 
Dermira, Inc.  
Olumacostat Glasaretil Gel  DRM01B-ACN05 
24 April 2017 Page 10 Confidential its unique position in intermediary metabolism, inhibition of ACC offers the ability to inhibit 
de novo fatty acid production in lipogenic tissues, such as liver, adipose tissue, and sebaceous 
glands.
 
A variety of structurally diverse ACC inhibitors has recently been described in the scientific and 
patent literature for potential use in metabolic syndrome. One class of ACC inhibitors, including 
TOFA (5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furancarboxylic acid), consists of lipophilic fatty acid mimetics that 
compete
 with acetyl-CoA in the ACC-mediated formation of malonyl-CoA. Investigators have 
demonstrated that TOFA reduced fatty acid synthesis and TG secretion both in cultured hepatic 
cells [ 8, 10] and in experimental animals [ 11, 12], reduced plasma cholesterol and TGs in 
e
xperimental animals including rhesus monkeys [ 10, 11], and reduced body weight [ 13]. 
The
 ability to deliver TOFA topi[INVESTIGATOR_294690] a means to inhibit de novo fatty acid 
production in sebaceous glands, introducing a new treatment paradigm for acne vulgaris.  
1.2 S ummary of Investigational Program 
Dermira, Inc. is pursuing the development of olumacostat glasaretil, previously referred to as 
DRM01B, a pro-drug of TOFA, sarcosine ester, a topi[INVESTIGATOR_229755]. 
Olumacostat glasaretil is hydrolyzed by [CONTACT_716082], TOFA. TOFA is converted to Tofyl-CoA intracellularly, which competes with acetyl-
CoA in the ACC-mediated formation of malonyl-CoA. As a result, inhibition of malonyl-CoA 
synthesis offers a means to inhibit de novo fatty acid production in the sebaceous glands in 
subjects with acne vulgaris. Olumacostat glasaretil is a new chemical entity and has been 
for
mulated for clinical development as Olumacostat Glasaretil Gel, 5.0%. 
A summ
ary of clinical and nonclinical pharmacology, toxicology and metabolism data is 
presented below. Detailed information is provided in the current Investigator’s Brochure. 
Safety pharmacology studies were conducted with olumacostat glasaretil administered 
int
ravenously (IV) which included neurobehavioral and pulmonary function studies in rats and a 
cardiovascular study in telemetered minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]. These studies revealed no adverse findings 
attributable to olumacostat glasaretil. In vitro studies assessing the effects of olumacostat 
glasaretil and TOFA upon human ether-à- go-go- related gene (hERG) ionic conductance in 
human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells also revealed no significant inhibition at the maximum 
c
oncentrations tested. Overall, the results from the safety pharmacology showed no adverse 
effects at exposures to parent drug and/or TOFA several orders of magnitude beyond that 
anticipated to be seen following topi[INVESTIGATOR_294691]. 
Following IV administration in rats and minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], olumacostat glasaretil was quickly 
metabolized to TOFA; no evidence of any gender-specific differences or accumulation upon 
repeated dosing of either olumacostat glasaretil or TOFA was observed. With oral administration 
in ra
ts, low ng/mL levels of olumacostat glasaretil were noted while exposure to TOFA reached 
leve
ls exceeding 1 µg/mL. In vitro metabolism and plasma protein binding experiments indicated 
that olumacostat glasaretil was metabolized and bound to plasma protein in a similar manner 
be
tween humans and the species utilized for toxicology and safety pharmacology assessments 
(rat and minipig).  
Dermira, Inc.  
Olumacostat Glasaretil Gel  DRM01B-ACN05 
24 April 2017 Page 11 Confidential Toxicokinetic assessments conducted following the topi[INVESTIGATOR_716066]; 
pe
ak plasma levels recorded in these studies were below the detectable limit for olumacostat 
glasaretil and while TOFA was detectable following application of the highest strength of 
Olumac
ostat Glasaretil Gel (7.5% w/w), mean values did not exceed 6 ng/mL for TOFA. The 
test a
rticle used in this study is the same formulation and concentration that was used in the 
clinical proof of concept study (DR01B-ACN01) and the same formulation that was included in 
the clinical dose ranging trial DR01B-ACN02).  
Toxicology
 studies conducted with olumacostat glasaretil included dermal studies in minipi[INVESTIGATOR_294693] [ADDRESS_975372] artic le- related effects 
were noted in any nonclinical study, aside from histological findings associated with the non-
glandular stomach (fore-stomach) in the 13-week rat oral study. This finding was considered a 
direct local effect (not due to systemic absorption), reversible and non-adverse, and is of doubtful 
clinical relevance given the absence of this structure in humans. In the other toxicology studies, 
there were no remarkable olumacostat glasaretil-related findings and olumacostat glasaretil was 
we
ll tolerated. No adverse systemic effects were associated with mean peak plasma exposures to 
olumacostat glasaretil and TOFA up to 9955 and 3630 ng/mL, respectively, which are 
c
oncentrations exceeding 4000-fold that seen following the dermal application of maximu m 
feasible doses (10 mg/kg) to minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]. In vivo and in vitro studies conducted to assess dermal 
sensitization, ocular irritation, and phototoxicity did not reveal any remarkable effects following 
the exposure of cells/tissues to olumacostat glasaretil. Genetic toxicology results indicated that 
olumacostat glasaretil was neither mutagenic nor clastogenic. Predictive software assessments 
indicated there were no potential theoretical manufacturing impurities or metabolic products that 
were of mutagenic concern. Overall, the results of the nonclinical toxicology and safety 
pharmacology studies suggest the safety risks posed by [CONTACT_716083]. 
Tw
o clinical studies, DRM01B-ACN01 and DRM01B-ACN02, have been completed as part of 
the Phase 2 development program. DRM01B-ACN01 was a proof of concept study which 
assessed the safety and efficacy of one strength of Olumacostat Glasaretil Gel compared to 
ve
hicle gel in adult subjects with acne vulgaris. DRM01B-ACN02 was a dose-ranging study 
which assessed the safety and efficacy of multiple strengths and regimens of Olumacostat 
Glasaretil Gel and vehicle gel in adult subjects with acne vulgaris. In both studies, Olumacostat 
Gla
saretil Gel was shown to be well-tolerated and demonstrated statistically significant 
improvements in acne lesions counts and severity. Additional information on these studies is 
provided below.  
Study DRM01B-ACN01 
DRM01B-ACN01 was randomized, vehicle controlled, parallel group study designed to assess 
the safety and tolerability of Olumacostat Glasaretil Gel, 7.5% in healthy volunteers (Phase 1) 
before assessing the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the drug in subjects with acne 
vulgaris (Phase 2a). In the Phase 1 portion of the study, 6 healthy volunteers applied study 
Olumacostat Glasaretil Gel twice daily, to the face, for one week. Review of the data from Phase 
Dermira, Inc.  
Olumacostat Glasaretil Gel  DRM01B-ACN05 
24 April 2017 Page 12 Confidential 1 showed that Olumacostat Glasaretil Gel was well tolerated with no safety concerns. As such, 
the Phase
 2a portion of the study was conducted. 
In the Phase 2a portion of the study, Olumacostat Glasaretil Gel was applied, twice daily, to the 
fa
ce in 108 adult subjects with acne vulgaris for a 12–week treatment period. Similar to Phase 1, 
Olumac
ostat Glasaretil Gel was well tolerated with most AEs re ported to be mild to moderate 
severity. Subjects treated with Olumacostat Glasaretil Gel had significantly greater reductions in 
infla
mmatory and noninflammatory lesion counts from Baseline to Week 12 compared with 
subjects treated with vehicle gel. In addition, a significantly greater proportion of subjects treated 
with 
Olumacostat Glasaretil Gel had a successful improvement in IGA score (corresponding to 
less se
vere acne) than subjects treated with vehicle gel.  
Study DRM01B-ACN02 
Study DRM01B-ACN02 was a Phase 2 dose-ranging study in adult subjects with acne vulgaris 
on the face. The study was a randomized, vehicle controlled, parallel group study designed to 
assess the efficacy and safety of Olumacostat Glasaretil Gel at a doses of 7.5% BID, 7.5% QD, 
a
nd 4.0% QD, compared to vehicle BID or QD in subjects with moderate to severe facial acne.  
A total of 420 adult subjects were randomized to active and vehicle in a 2:2:2:1:1 fashion. Study 
treatments continued for 12 weeks. Subjects returned to the study clinic at Weeks 1, 2 (phone 
call only), 4, 8 and 12 (study exit).  
The results of the study showed that all three Olumacostat Glasaretil Gel treatment groups 
showe
d statistically significantly greater reductions in the absolute change in inflammatory 
lesion counts from baseline to Week 12 than the combined vehicle group. The LS mean changes 
in i
nflammatory lesion counts were −14.6 and −14.5, and −15.0 for the Olumacostat 
Glasaretil Gel, 4.0% QD, 7.5% QD, and 7.5% BID groups, respectively, compared with −10.7 
for
 the combined vehicle group ( P = 0.011, P  = 0.014, and P = 0.011 , respectively).  
All 3 Olumacostat Glasaretil Gel treatment groups showed statistically significantly greater 
re
ductions in the absolute change in noninflammatory lesion counts from baseline to Week 12 
than the combined vehicle group. The LS mean changes in noninflammatory lesion counts at 
Week 12 were −15.3, −13.4, and −17.5 for the Olumacostat Glasaretil Gel 4.0% QD, 7.5% QD, 
a
nd 7.5% BID groups, respectively, compared with −9.3 for the combined vehicle group 
(P = 0.004, P = 0.050, and P < 0.011, respectively).  
The
 Olumacostat Glasaretil Gel 4.0% QD and 7.5% BID groups each had a statistically 
sig
nificantly greater proportion of subjects achieve a minimum 2-grade improvement (reduction) 
in IGA score from baseline at Week 12 compared with the combined vehicle group. The percent 
of subjects achieving this endpoint was 21.6% in the Olumacostat Glasaretil Gel 4.0% QD and 
25.9%
 of subjects in the Olumacostat Glasaretil Gel 7.5% BID group compared with 9.8% in the 
c
ombined vehicle QD group (P = 0.024 and P = 0.004, respectively).

24 April 2017 Page 13 Confidential Pharmacokinetic (PK) results, assessed in a subset of subjects, showed that plasma 
concentrations of olumacostat glasaretil on Day [ADDRESS_975374], who 
had a
 plasma concentration of 0.304 ng/mL at one time point ([ADDRESS_975375]-dosing). Plasma 
concentrations of olumacostat glasaretil at Week [ADDRESS_975376] subjects, but detectable in a 
few subjects in each dose group, with values ranging from 0.101 to 1.02 ng/mL. Plasma 
concentration of TOFA at Week [ADDRESS_975377] subjects in the Olumacostat 
Gla
saretil Gel QD dose groups, but detectable in a few subjects, with values ranging from 
0.100 to 0.299 ng/mL. In the Olumacostat Glasaretil Gel, 7.5% BID group, approximately half of 
the tested subjec
ts had detectable TOFA levels at each time point, with mean values ranging 
from 0.156 to 0.340 ng/mL. 
The most common AEs reported during the study were nasopharyngitis, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4348], and application site pruritus. Most AEs were mild or moderate in severity. Erythema 
was the most common LSR. Laboratory values, vital signs, and ECGs measured at the end of the 
study were generally consistent with baseline values, with no clinically significant trends. 
Study Rationale 
Data from the completed Phase [ADDRESS_975378] shown that Olumacostat Glasaretil Gel was well tolerated at multiple 
c
oncentrations. Olumacostat Glasaretil Gel at a strength of 5.0% has been selected as the 
c
oncentration to take forward in Phase 3 development. Two Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_6518], DRM01B-
ACN03 and DRM01B-ACN04, are planned as part of the Phase 3 development program and will 
include adults and children (ages 9 years and older) in order to assess the safety and efficacy of 
Olumacostat Glasaretil Gel for the treatment of acne vulgaris.  
The DRM01B-ACN05 study described herein is an open-label study to assess the long term 
safety of continuous treatment with Olumacostat Glasaretil Gel, 5% for up to an additional 
36-weeks in subjects who have completed either of the DRM01-ACN03 or DRM01-ACN04 
studi

visit and cover general appearance, dermatological, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
cardiovascular, abdominal, neurological, musculoskeletal, and lymphatic body systems. A 
symptom directed physical exam may be performed at other clinic visits, if needed, to assess the 
subject. Weight will be recorded with the end of study physical exam. Findings will be recorded 
in the source document and eCRF. 
9.4.2 P ulse and Blood Pressure 
Pulse (beats per minute), and blood pressure (mmHg), will be obtained with the subject in the 
seated position, after sitting for at least [ADDRESS_975393] 15 minutes afterwards.  
All study sites will be supplied with standardized, validated digital 12-lead ECG (12 lead at 
25 mm/sec reporting rhythm, ventricular rate, the RR interval, the PR interval, QRS duration, QT 
and QTcF intervals) equipment capable of recording, storing, and printing producing high 
resolution 12-lead ECG data by [CONTACT_2237]. Study sites will be trained on the use of 
the equipment prior to study start.  
Machine-read ECG recordings will be collected and analyzed centrally. Data will be transferred 
electronically to the database. 
9.4.4 L aboratory Evaluations  
Laboratory tests will be collected to evaluate safety in all study subjects and analyzed using a 
central laboratory. Labs will be collected per the Schedule of Visits and Procedures (see 
Appendix 1) or more frequently as clinically indicated. Laboratory samples are to be shipped on 
the same day as collected. No more than 4 mL/kg total will be collected over an 8-week period in 
subjects under legal adult age. Laboratory tests are described below.  
Hematology: hematocrit, hemoglobin, red blood cell (RBC) count, white blood cell count and 
differential (%), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin 
concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular volume, RBC morphology, platelet count, absolute

Ur
inalysis: pH, specific gravity, protein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, blood, nitrite, urobilinogen, 
leukoc
yte esterase. A microscopic examination of urine will be performed if clinically indicated 
(e.g. a positive dipstick for protein, blood, leucocyte esterase) in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_716073]. Any new or worsened 
clinically significant laboratory result is to be recorded as an AE after study drug dosing. 
The
 central laboratory should be used for any laboratory testing required for a subject during 
study participation, including laboratory testing needed for unscheduled visits. If an immediate 
result is required to adequately care for a subject, a duplicate sample may be submitted to a local 
lab. Clinically significant laboratory results must be recorded as an AE, preferably as a diagnosis 
rather than individual test results. Any subject who has a clinically significant laboratory test 
result will be evaluated by [CONTACT_737], and will be treated and/or followed up until the value 
returns to clinically acceptable levels, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. 
9.4.5 L ocal Skin Reactions 
All subjects will be assessed for LSRs, on the face, at each visit. LSRs include burning/stinging, 
pruritus, erythema, dryness and peeling. Each LSR will be scored as 0 (None), 1 (Mild), 
2 (Moderate) or 3 (Severe) ( Ta ble 2 ). LSRs observed on a visit day will not be recorded as 
adverse events unless scored as 3 (Severe). Local skin reactions experienced by [CONTACT_716087].

9.4.6 Adverse Events 
An adverse event ( AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of 
a study drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can, therefore, be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease 
temporally associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not related to the investigational 
product.  
AEs will be monitored throughout the study. Subjects will be instructed to inform the 
Investigator and/or study staff of any AEs. At each visit, subjects will be asked about AEs in a 
non-specific manner using open-ended questions so as not to bias the response (e.g., How have 
y
ou been since the last visit?). Specific inquiry regarding reported AEs will be conducted when 
applicable. All AEs will be documented and recorded in the subject’s eCRF. 
Any subject who has an AE (serious or non-serious) or clinically significant abnormal laboratory 
test va
lue will be evaluated by [CONTACT_737], and will be treated and/or followed up until the 
s
ymptoms or values return to normal or to clinically acceptable levels, as judged by [CONTACT_3786]. A physician, either at clinical site, or at a nearby [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_9487], will 
administer treatment for any serious adverse events (S AEs), if necessary. When appropriate, 
medical tests and examinations will be performed to document resolution of event(s). 
Dermira, Inc.  
Olumacostat Glasaretil Gel  DRM01B-ACN05 
24 April 2017 Page 26 Confidential 9.4.7 Reporting 
Only AEs that occur during or following study treatment with the drug will be reported in the AE 
section of the eCRF. Events recorded prior to treatment with the study drug will be reported in 
the Medical History section of the eCRF as appropriate. All AEs occurring during the course of 
the study will be individually recorded in the eCRF. A condition that is present prior to 
administration of study drug and that worsens after administration of study drug should be 
reported as an AE. Information regarding the onset, duration, severity, action taken, outcome, 
and relationship to study drug will be recorded.  
New or worsening abnormal laboratory values and/or pulse and blood pressure are to be recorded 
as AEs if they are considered to be of clinical significance by [CONTACT_716089] S AE as described in S ection 9.4.8. 
Unle
ss a diagnosis is available, signs and symptoms must be reported as individual AEs in the 
eCRF; a diagnosis is preferred. 
The severity of an AE will be designated as mild, moderate or severe. The term “severe” is used 
to desc
ribe the intensity of an adverse event; the event itself, however, may be of relatively 
minor clinical significance (e.g., ‘severe’ upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]). Severity is not the same as 
“serious”. Seriousness of AEs is based on the outcome/action of an AE.  
The relationship of the AE to the study treatment should be determined by [CONTACT_716090]: 
Not related : An AE is defined as “not related” if the AE is not judged to be associated with the 
study drug and is attributable to another cause 
Related:  An AE is defined as “related” where a causal relationship between the event and the 
study drug is a reasonable possibility (possibly or probably related). A reasonable causal 
relationship is meant to convey that there are facts (e.g., evidence such as dechallenge/ 
rechallenge) or other clinical arguments to suggest a causal relationship between the AE and 
study treatment.  
9.4.8 S erious Adverse Events 
A Serious Adverse Event (S AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, 
 R esults in death; 
 Is immediately life-threatening (i.e., in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the AE places the 
subj
ect at immediate risk of death; it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death); 
 R equires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1666]; 
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; 
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; 
Dermira, Inc.  
Olumacostat Glasaretil Gel  DRM01B-ACN05 
24 April 2017 Page 27 Confidential  Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening, result in 
death, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be considered an S AE when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, it jeopardizes the subject or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
As soon as the Investigator becomes aware of an AE that meets the criteria for an S AE, the S AE 
shoul
d be documented to the extent that information is available. A report must be submitted by 
[CONTACT_294730] [ADDRESS_975395] be reported to the Sponsor immediately (within 
24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event).  
SAEs will be recorded from the time of informed consent/assent, through to end of the study. If, 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], an S AE occurring outside the specified time window, (i.e., 
following
 subject completion or terminations of the study) is deemed to be drug-related, then the 
event should be reported with [ADDRESS_975396]-mortem findings/reports will be requested. 
9.4.[ADDRESS_975397] number, event description, 
SAE term(s), reason why the event is considered to be serious (i.e., the seriousness criteria), and 
P
I’s assessment of the relationship of the event to study drug. Additional S AE information 
including
 medications or other therapeutic measures used to treat the event, and the 
outcome/resolution of the event should also be recorded on the S AE form. 
In all cases, the Investigator should continue to monitor the clinical situation and report all 
material facts relating to the progression or outcome of the S AE. The Investigator may be 
required to provide supplementary information as requested by [CONTACT_4885]. 
When reporting S AEs, the following additional points should be considered: 
 W hen the diagnosis of an S AE is known or suspected, the Investigator should report the 
diagnosis or syndrome as the primary S AE term, rather than as signs or symptoms; signs, 
s
ymptoms and tests that support the diagnosis should be provided  
 Death should not be reported as an S AE, but as an outcome of a specific S AE, unless the 
event preceding the death is unknown. If an autopsy was performed, the autopsy report 
should be provided; 
While most hospi[INVESTIGATOR_716075] S AE, som e hospi[INVESTIGATOR_716076] S AE reporting, as follows:

existing condition that has not worsened after administration of study drug (e.g., a 
previously scheduled ventral hernia repair). S AEs must, however, be reported for any 
surgical or procedural complication resulting in prolongation of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
 Eve nts that result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_716077] 24 hours and that do 
not require admission or therapeutic intervention/treatment (e.g., an emergency room 
visit for hematuria that results in a diagnosis of cystitis and discharge to home on oral

The Sponsor will process and evaluate all S AEs as soon as the reports are received. For each 
SAE received, the Sponsor will make a determination as to whether the criteria for expedited 
re
porting to relevant regulatory authorities have been met.  
The Sponsor will assess the expectedness of each S AE to the study treatment. The current

10.1 Discontinuation of the Study 
The Sponsor has the right to terminate or to stop the study at any time. Should this be necessary, 
both the Sponsor and the Investigator will ensure that proper study discontinuation procedures 
are completed. The entire study will be stopped if: 
 Evide nce has emerged that, in the collective opi[INVESTIGATOR_716078], makes the 
continuation of the study unnecessary or unethical 
 The  stated objectives of the study are achieved 
 The  Sponsor discontinues the development of the study drug 
Regardless of the reason for withdrawal, all data available for the subject at the time of 
discontinuation of follow-up must be recorded in the eCRF. All reasons for discontinuation of 
treatment must be documented. 
10.[ADDRESS_975400] in the study; however, a 
subject may voluntarily withdraw from study participation at any time. If the subject withdraws 
consent and discontinues from the study, the Investigator will attempt to schedule an Early 
Termination visit as soon as possible, determine the reason for discontinuation, and record the 
reason in the subject’s study records and in the eCRF.  
If at any time during the study, the Investigator determines that it is not in the best interest of the 
subj
ect to continue, the subject will be discontinued from participation. The Investigator can 
discontinue a subject at any time if medically necessary. The Investigator may discontinue a 
subject’s participation if the subject has failed to follow study procedures or to keep follow-up 
appointments. Appropriate documentation in the subject’s study record and eCRF regarding the 
reason for discontinuation must be completed. 
All subjects who fail to return to the study site for the required follow-up visits will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] 
b
y phone to determine the cause(s) why the subject failed to return for the necessary visit or 
elected to discontinue from the study. If a subject is unreachable by [CONTACT_34675] a minimum 
of two documented attempts (one attempt on two different days), a registered letter will be sent 
requesting that subject contact [CONTACT_716091]-up.  
Subjects will be discontinued early from the study if any of the following occur: 
 W ithdrawal of informed consent (subject’s decision to withdraw for any reason) 
 An y clinical adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or inter-current illness which, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], indicates that continued treatment and/or participation in the 
study is not in the best interest of the subject 
 Death 
Dermira, Inc.

24 April 2017 Page 30 Confidential  Serious protocol violation, including persistent noncompliance or subject requiring 
medication or procedures prohibited by [CONTACT_760], to allow subjects to receive the 
appropriate medical attention.  
 Disc ontinuation of the study by [CONTACT_1034] 
10.3 S tudy Drug Discontinuation 
For subjects who decide to prematurely discontinue study drug treatment, all reasonable efforts 
should be made to obtain all protocol-specified safety assessments and end of study procedures.  
The Investigator should stop study drug treatment in the following instances: 
 I nter-current illness that would, in the judgment of the Investigator, affect assessments of 
clinical status to a significant degree. In such cases, the Investigator must contact [CONTACT_12066], as the need to withdraw the subject will assessed by [CONTACT_1034] 
 Una cceptable toxicity 
11 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
11.1 General Statistical Methodology 
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise stated. Data will be 
summ
arized using descriptive statistics. No inferential testing or imputations for missing data 
will be performed.  
Subject demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized for the Safety Population. 
Categorial variables will be tabulated with frequencies and percentages. Continuous variables 
will be tabulated with mean, median, SD, and range (minimum and maximum). 
A statistical analysis plan (SAP), describing all statistical analyses will be provided as a separate 
document. 
11.[ADDRESS_975401]-baseline (where 
baseline is the day that the subject received their first study drug) assessment will be included in 
the Safety Population. 
The number of subjects included in the Safety Population will be summarized.  
11.[ADDRESS_975402] applied 80% to 120% of the expected number of 
applications while enrolled in the study.  
11.4 Adver se Events 
All AEs that occur during the study will be recorded and classified on the basis of Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. Treatment-emergent AEs 
(TEAEs) are defined as AEs with an onset on or after the date of the first study drug application. 
Adve
rse events noted prior to the first study drug administration that worsen after baseline will 
also be reported as AEs and included in the summaries.  
All information pertaining to an AE  noted during the study will be listed by [CONTACT_1130], detailing 
verbatim term given by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1461], preferred term, system organ class (SOC), onset date, 
resolution date, severity, seriousness, action taken, outcome and drug relatedness. The even t 
onset will also be shown relative (in number of days) to date of first application.  
Treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], the number of subjects 
reporting a TE AE, SOC, preferred term, severity, relationship to study drug (causality), and 
seriousness. When summarizing AEs by [CONTACT_42564], each subject will be counted 
once within a system organ class or a preferred term by [CONTACT_716092]. 
Serious AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], severity and relationship to study drug, and 
individual S AEs will be listed by [CONTACT_1130]. In addition, a list of subjects who prematurely 
discontinue from the study due to an AE will be provided. 
11.5 L ocal Skin Reactions 
Local Skin Responses (LSRs) include erythema, peeling, dryness, burning/stinging and pruritus. 
These will be scored as 0 (None), 1 (Mild), 2 (Moderate) or 3 (Severe). LSRs will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_72082]. A by-subject listing of 
subjects with any LSR [ADDRESS_975403] be 
prepared by [CONTACT_1034]. The Investigator will not implement any deviation or change to the 
protocol without prior review and documented approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_5698]/EC of 
an Amendment, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study subjects. 
Any significant deviation must be documented and submitted to the: IRB/EC; the Sponsor or 
designee; and, if required, Regulatory Authority (ies). 
Documentation of approval signed by [CONTACT_12715](s)/EC(s) must be 
sent to the Sponsor and/or designee. 
12.2 In formed Consent Procedures 
The Informed Consent Form (ICF) and Assent Forms for subjects under legal adult age must 
include all elements required by [CONTACT_12212]/GCP and applicable regulatory requirements, and must 
adhere to GCP and to the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
For subjects under legal adult age, both parents or legal representative may be required to sign 
informed consent as applicable. Assent to participate in a clinical trial applies to all subjects who 
are not legal adult subjects (in the state or location in which they are participating) and is defined 
as a child’s affirmative agreement to participate in research. Permission of the minor subject’s 
parent or legal guardian must also be obtained in compliance with part 50, subpart B of the Code 
of Federal Regulations and must include the elements of informed consent as described in 
Section 50.21 and according to the regulations where the study is being conducted. Appropriate 
ICFs and assent forms will be provided according to local law/regulations. If a subject reaches 
legal adult age during the course of the trial, an adult ICF will be signed.  
The ICF and Assent Forms must also include a statement that the Sponsor and regulatory 
authorities have direct access to subject records. Prior to the beginning of the study, the 
Investigator must have the IRB/EC’s written approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_248426], 
Assent Forms and any other information to be provided to the subjects. 
The Investigator must provide the subject or legally acceptable representative with a copy of the 
consent form and written information about the study in the language in which the subject is 
most proficient. The language must be nontechnical and easily understood. The Investigator 
should allow time necessary for subject or subject’s legally acceptable representative to inquire 
about the details of the study, then the ICF must be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_294738]’s legally acceptable representative, by [CONTACT_716093], Inc.  
Olumacostat Glasaretil Gel  DRM01B-ACN05 
[ADDRESS_975404]’s participation in the study. This also 
applies to Assent Forms. All subjects and/or the legally acceptable representative (i.e. parents or 
guardian) will be provided with a contact [CONTACT_656558]. 
The ICF, Assent Forms and any other information provided to the subjects or the subject’ s 
legally acceptable representative, should be revised whenever important new information 
becomes available that is relevant to the subject’s consent, and should receive IRB/EC approval/ 
favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_143197]. The Investigator or designee should fully inform the subject or the 
subject’s legally acceptable representative of all pertinent aspects of the study and of any new 
information relevant to the subject’s willingness to continue participation in the study. This 
c
ommunication to the subject should be documented in the source documents.  
During a subject’s participation in the study, any updates to the consent or assent forms and any 
updates to the written information will be provided to the subject 
12.3 S tudy Documentation and the Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) 
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that data are properly recorded in the eCRFs and on 
related documents. All entries must be supported by [CONTACT_423]’s medical records or source 
documents. The Investigator to ensure that the observations and findings are recorded correctly 
and completely. 
All Investigator observations/assessments must be reported in the eCRF. The original reports and 
any traces and films must be reviewed, signed and dated and retained by [CONTACT_294741]. 
The Investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation on each 
individual treated with the investigational product or entered as a control in the investigation. 
Data reported in the eCRFs that are derived from source documents must be consistent with the 
source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. 
The Investigator must certify that the data are complete and accurate at the time the subject ends 
the study or as instructed by [CONTACT_716094]. 
12.[ADDRESS_975405] and visit the Investigators at regular intervals throughout the study. The study monitor 
will verify adherence to the protocol and completeness, consistency and accuracy of the data by 
[CONTACT_294743]’ medical records with entries in the eCRF. The study monitor must be 
allowed access to laboratory test reports and other subject records that are needed to verify the 
entries on the eCRF. The Investigators will allow the study monitor to inspect the various records 
of the study (eCRFs and other pertinent data), provided that subject confidentiality is maintained

[ADDRESS_975406] the Sponsor prior to destroying any records associated with 
the study. 
If the Investigator withdraws from the study (e.g., relocation, retirement), the records will be 
transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee (e.g., another Investigator, IRB/Ethics 
Committee). Notice of such transfer will be given in writing to the Sponsor or designee. 
If the Investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement for any or all the documents at the 
investigational site, arrangements must be made between the Investigator and the Sponsor, to 
store these in a secure archive facility outside the site; they can therefore be returned to the 
Investigator in case of a regulatory audit. Where source documents are required for the continued 
care of the subject, appropriate copi[INVESTIGATOR_492937].

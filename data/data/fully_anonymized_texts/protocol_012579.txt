3/Protocol NP40435, Version 5PROTOCOL A MENDMENT, VERSION 5
RATIONA LE
Protocol NP [ZIP_CODE] has been amended toenable pa rticipants , who are benefitting from
the therapy with RO7121661 at the end of the treatment period, to remain on treatment 
beyond the initial 24 months. Changes to the protocol, along with a rationale for each 
change, are summarized below.
Section 2.3 and Section 6.5.1 were updated to add Co vid-19 benefit/risk 
assessment and vaccine information .
The Schedule of Assessment Table 1 (footnotes only) , Section 4.1, Section 7.[ADDRESS_469668] been updated to add language to prolon g the treatment 
period for participants who benefit from tr eatment.
Medical Monitor language was updated in S ection 5.1, Section 5.2 ,Section 5.4,
Section 6.1.2, Section 6.5.1 , Section 6.6 , Section 7.1.1, Section 7.1.2 , Section 
[IP_ADDRESS] , Section 8.[ADDRESS_469669] new guidelines on medical 
monitoring in accordance with ICH E6(R2) 4.3.1 .
In Appendix 6, the dose modification and treatment interruption sections have been 
removed to avoid redundancy with Section s6.6 and 7.1.1. Information on 
immune -mediated myocarditis, Grade 1 -2 has been removed from the 
management guidelines Table 6 to align with updates in the atezolizumab 
Investigator’s Brochure. A section on hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and 
macrophage activation syndrome was added to align language with other protocols 
studying in- house checkpoint inhibitors (including RO7121661) .
Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency. New 
information appears in Book Antiqua italics. This amendment represents cumulative 
changes to the original protocol.

15/Protocol NP40435, Version 5OVER ALL DESIGN
Study NP40435 is a first -in-human, open -label, multicenter, Phase I multiple -ascending dose 
(MAD) study of single agent RO7121661.
Study Design
The study consists of 2 parts (A and B):
Part A(RO7121661 Dose Escalation): To determine the MTD and/or RDE based on safety, 
tolerability, PK, and/or t he PD profile of escalating doses of RO7121661 every 2 weeks (Q2 W). 
Iffor specific cleared cohort(s) the safety, PK and/or RO and/or the biomarker profile need to be 
further characterized, additional participants, potentially enriched in certain indicatio ns and/or 
characteristics, may  be enrolled.
Part B (RO7121661 Tumor -Specific Expansion Cohorts): To evaluate anti -tumor activity of the 
RDE of RO7121661 from Part A ( 2.1g Q2W) and to confirm safety  and tolerability in 
participants with selected tumor ty pes. B1, B2, B4 and B 5expansions may be staggered, 
sequential or concurrent. Part B3 will not proceed prior to generation of data from the initial CPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_375362](s):
Part B1: CPI [INVESTIGATOR_375363]
Part B2: CPI [INVESTIGATOR_375364] -L1 positive NSCLC
Part B3: PD-L1positive ,CPI[INVESTIGATOR_28947]ïve ,first line NSCLC
Part B4: CPI-naïve SCLC with prior failure of, progression on, or intolerance to standard 
therapy
Part B 5:CPI-naïve ESCC
Treatment Groups and Duration
The investigational medicinal product (IMP) is RO7121661.
Part A
RO7121661 will be administered IV with a flat dose. The starting dose will be [ADDRESS_469677]  DLT evaluable participants will 
be enrolled in each cohort during the dose escalation. Dose escalation will be carried out 
according to a modified continual reassessment method (mCRM) with escalation with overdose 
control (E WOC) design, with the aim of identif ying the MTD/RDE of RO7121661. 
The maximum total number of participants in the dose escalation portions of Part A will be 
approximately  DLT evaluable participants. A dose cohort can be extended to enroll 
additional participants, potentially enr iched in certain tumor ty pes and/or characteristics 
(approximately ) to confirm safety , PK and/or RO data.  
Part B
Part B1 and/or B2 and/or B4 and/or B5 may commence upon completion of Part A. The starting 
dose of RO7121661 for Part B is 2.1 g as derive d from the RDE in Part A determined by [CONTACT_49874], 
PK and/or RO and/or the biomarker profile. Part B3 will not proceed prior to generation of data 
from the initial CPI [INVESTIGATOR_375362](s).
Patients enrolled in Part B expansions have more specific limitat ions of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_375365]. Patients enrolled in Part B1 (CPI [INVESTIGATOR_375366] a) must have had treatment with approved anti -PD-L1/anti -PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors. 
Patients enrolled in Part B2 (CPI [INVESTIGATOR_375367], PD -L1 expression 1% NSCLC) 
must have had a checkpoint inhibitor and platinum chemotherapy . Patients enrolled in Part B3 
(untreated, CIT naïve NSCLC with PD -L1 expression 50%) should not have had any prior 
therapy . Patients enrolled in Part B4 (CPI [INVESTIGATOR_28947]ïve SCLC) and B5 (CPI -naïve ESCC) should not 
have had any prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy but may have had chemotherapy. Specific 
details for Part B Expansions are included in the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria .
In Part B (tumor specific expansion cohorts) approximately  participants will be included per 
indication . Part B cohorts may run in parallel staggered or sequentially.

Contraception
16. Male and/or female participants
The contraception and abstinence requirements are intended to prevent exposure of an 
embryo to the study treatment. The reliability of sexual abstinence for male and/or female 
enrollment eligibility needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and 
the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, 
ovulation, sy mptom-thermal, or post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable 
methods of contraception.
a).Female Participants

least one of the following conditions applies:
Not a woman of childbearing potential (W OCBP).
WOCBP, who:
Agree to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual inter course) or use 
contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate of 1% per year during the 
treatment period and for at least 4 months after the final dose of RO7121661.
Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of 1% per year include 
bilateral tubal occlusion, male sterilization, established proper use of hormonal 
contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone -releasing intrauterine devices and 
copper intrauterine devices.
Have a negative pregnanc y test (blood) within the [ADDRESS_469681] study 
RO7121661 administration.
b).Male Participants

measures such as a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that 
together result in a failure rate of 1% per year, with partners who are women of 
childbearing potential.
With pregnant female partners, remain abstinent (refrain from 
heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures such as a 
condom to avoid exposing the embryo.
oRefrain from donating sperm during this period .

Results of standard -of-care tests or examinations performed prior to obtaining informed consent and within [ADDRESS_469691] returned to the normal range and/or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found.
3. Triplicate 12 -lead ECG recordings (i.e., 3 qualitatively acceptable ECGs without artifacts) must be obtained at screening, at pre -infusion, 
end of infusion (EOI) and within windows provided at each specified time -point. Patients should be resting and in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_42428] [ADDRESS_469692] be done prior to PK sampling.  
4. Complete physical exam (including weight and height at screening only) must be performed during screening, Day 1 of each treatment 
cycle before study treatment administration, at any unscheduled safety visit, and at study treatment discontinuation, and at the 60 -day
(Part A) / 90 -day (Part B) safety follow ‑up. At subsequent visits (or as clinically i ndicated), limited, sy mptom-directed phys ical 
examinations should be performed. Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical Histor y and 
Baseline Conditions eCRF. 
5. Adverse Events: After initiation of study drug, all AEs and SAEs, regardless of attribution, must be reported until study completion or 
patient discontinuation, whichever is later. After this period, investigators should report only SAEs that are believed to be related to prior 
treatment with study drug.  Serious adverse events occurring after signature [CONTACT_375510]. Serious adverse events related to study procedures are reportable fo llowing 
signature [CONTACT_375511]. For serious adverse events (SAEs) prior to first dose, a corresponding AE page should also be completed.
6. Tumorassessments will include contrast -enhanced computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest, 
abdom en, a nd pelvis as well as the site of the primary tumor (if applicable). Measurable lesions will be assessed at Screening and then

37/Protocol NP40435, Version 52. INTRODUCTION
2.1 STUDY R ATIONA LE
RO7121661, an anti -programmed death -1 (PD -1)/ T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin 
domain 3 (TIM-3)bispecific antibody (BsAb), was designed to target dysfunctional tumor 
antigen -specific T lymphocytes (expressing PD -1 and TIM -3) in order to establish or re -
establish an effective anti -tumor immune -response in cancer patients with high unmet 
medical need. Thi s may result in improvement in the therapeutic response over currently 
available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13265]/or overcoming of primary resistance or emerging resistance 
against PD -1/programmed death -ligand 1 ( PD-L1)checkpoint blockade in patients 
previously treated with PD-1 or PD -L1 checkpoint inhibitors (CPI [INVESTIGATOR_375361]) . 
Exploration of activity in patients without prior CPI[CONTACT_80063] ( i.e., CPI [INVESTIGATOR_28947]ïve) is also 
planned. 
NP40435 is a first in human, open label, multicenter, Phase I study to determine the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or a recommended dose for expansion (RDE) that 
will allow exploration of the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and 
preliminary anti -tumor activity of RO7121661.
The rationale for the study design isprovided in Section 4.3.
2.[ADDRESS_469702] advanced solid tumors remains challenging because of the high 
rate of tumor recurrence or the development of distant metastases. 
2.2.1 Non- Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients: Checkpoint I nhibitor 
Experienced and Naïve
Treatment of patients with advanced non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has undergone 
significant changes with the development of immune CPI [CONTACT_66845] (mAbs)
to anti -PD-1/PD -L1 e.g., pembrolizumab, nivolumab or ate zolizumab or durvalumab (see 
recent reviews :Hashimoto et al 2018 ; Thommen and Schumacher 2018; Zappasodi et al 
2018 ) now commonly used in patients without mutations or rearrangements in the 
EGFR, ALK and ROS genes . Initial approval was in patients who had prior platinum 
based chemotherapy.  Pembrolizumab approval was supported by [CONTACT_375433] -001 
Phase I trial in patients with 50% PD -L1 (Garon et al 2015 ) and extended by [CONTACT_375434] -010 Phase III trial in patients with 1% PD- L1 (Herbst et al 2016 ). Nivolumab 
was approved in patients regardless of PD -L1 status, initially in advanced squamous 
NSCLC ( Brahmer et al 2015 ) and subsequently in non -squamous NSCLC ( Borghaei et 
al 2015). Atezolizumab was approved in patients independent of PD -L1 status and 
histology (squamo us and non -squamous) based on the POPLAR Phase II 
(Fehrenbacher et al 2016 ) and the OAK Phase III trials ( Rittmeyer et al 2017 ). 

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
38/Protocol NP40435, Version 5Pembrolizumab has also received approval for treatment -naïve patients with advanced 
NSCLC without driver mutations and with tumor proportion score (TPS) 50% or high 
tumor PD -L1 expression, based on the KEYNOTE -024 Phase III study ( Reck et al 2016 ). 
Pembrolizumab also received accelerated approval in combination with platinum and 
pemetrexed in first line treatment -naïve non -squamous patients irrespective of PD -L1 
status based on Phase II results in KEYNOTE -021 ( Langer et al 2016 ) and confir med in 
the Phase III KEYNOTE -189 study ( Gandhi et al 2018 ). Recent results from CheckMate 
227, a Phase III trial in patients with chemotherapy -naïve stage IV or recurrent NSCLC 
demonstrates improvement in PFS with first -line nivolumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_375381] a hig h tumor mutational burden (TMB) , irrespective 
of PD-L1 expression level. ( Hellmann et al 2018 ) supporting a potential role for the use 
of TMBas a selection marker for treatment. Furthermore, durvalumab was approved for 
patients with unresectable Stage III NSCLC based on Phase III results in the PACIFIC 
study ( Antonia et al 2017 ).
2.2.2 Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients: Checkpoint Inhibitor Naïve
In 2012, the World Health Organization (W HO) estimated the worldwide incidence of 
new lung cancer cases was 1.8 million, resulting in approximately 1 .6 million deaths and 
accounting for about 13% of total cancer diagnoses ( Ferlay et al 2012 ). In the Western 
World, approximately 13% of the lung cancers that are diagnosed are small cell lung 
cancer (SCLC). SCLC occurs primarily in patients with a history of tobacco use and 
originates from neuroendocrine cell precursors. It is characterized by [CONTACT_375435], high 
response rates to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and the development of 
treatment resistance in patients with metastatic disease ( Früh et al 2013).
Although SCLC is more responsive to chemotherapy and radiation therapy than other 
types of lung cancer, a cure is difficult to achi eve because SCLC has a greater tendency 
to be widely disseminated by [CONTACT_375436] ( NIH National Cancer Institute 2016 ). 
At the time of diagnosis, approximately 30% of patients with SCLC will have tumors 
confined to the hemithorax of origin, the mediastinum, or the supraclavicular lymph 
nodes. These patients are designated as having limited -stage disease (LD), where the 
treatment goal is curative ( Früh et al 2013 ). Patients with tumors that have spread 
beyond the supraclavicular areas are said to have exten sive-stage disease (ED). The 
prognosis of SCLC strongly depends on the tumor stage, which is evaluated by [CONTACT_375437] -node -metastasis (TNM) version 7 staging system according to the Union for 
International Cancer Control (UICC) ( Früh et al 2013).
In the last [ADDRESS_469703] introduced better supportive care measures, such as more 
effective antiemetic regimens.

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
39/Protocol NP40435, Version 5The generally accepted standard for first -line systemic therapy is etoposide combined 
with either cisplatin or carb oplatin. Initial objective response rates of 60 to 80% are seen 
in patients without substantive co -morbid conditions. Howev er, almost all patients with 
ED and most patients with LD experience disease progression within months of 
completing first -line thera py.
There is only one approved therapy for SCLC that has progressed on a platinum and 
etoposide combination regimen: topotecan, a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor. 
Recurrent/refractory SCLC is substantially less responsive to therapy than primary 
disease. Respons e rates for topotecan are approximately 25% for relapses occurring at 
least [ADDRESS_469704] -line therapy, and as low as 3 to 6% for 
progressive disease occurring at the time of or shortly after completion of first -line 
therapy. Objective responses to a third line of chemotherapy are uncommon.
Recent data demonstrates activity of checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of SCLC.  
Two agents, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, have recently demonstrated activity in 
both the monotherapy setting i n recurrent SCLC and in combination with platinum and 
etoposide in untreated patients ( Chung et al 2018 , Ott et al 2017 , Horn et al 2018). 
Monotherapy pembrolizumab demonstrated an ORR of 18.7% in unselected but 
previously treated SCLC patients and an ORR of 33 -35.7% in the PD -L1 positiv e 
population ( Chung et al 20 18, Ott et al 2017 ).  Addition of atezolizumab to platinum 
chemotherapy as initial therapy has shown a 2 month improvement in overall survival 
(Horn et al 2018). Although these initial checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated activity, 
SCLC remains a major caus e of morbidity and mortality worldwide with a significant 
unmet need for new effective and safe treatments.
2.2.3 Melanoma Patients: Checkpoint Inhibitor Experienced
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_375382] a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_375383] -blind Phase III study ( Hodi et al 2010 ). Subsequent to this, 
nivolumab was approved in advanced melanoma patients without BRAF mutation 
(Robert et al 2015 ). Pembrolizumab was approved for treatment of patients with 
advanced or unresectable melanoma who progressed after ipi[INVESTIGATOR_164]/or BRAF
therapy ( Ribas et al 2015 ; Robert et al 2015 ). 
The combination of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_375384] ( Robert et al 
2015 ), although toxicity may be more prominent with the combination therapy. An 
analysis involving patients with a PD -L1 expression level of more or less than 1%, 
suggests that this biomarker may determine the best option for individual patients, as 
monotherapy may provide sufficient results in terms of surviva l with less toxicity ( Larkin 
et al 201 5;Wolchok et al 2017 ).

40/Protocol NP40435, Version 52.2.4 Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients : Checkpoint 
Inhibitor Naïve
Treatment in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients without distal 
metastases is aimed at a radical cure by [CONTACT_375438]. 
Meanwhile, for patients with distal metastases or those with a postoperative distant 
recurrence, combination therapy with platinum based chemotherapy and 5 -FU (FP 
therapy) is recommended as the standard treatment. In the second -line setting, single -
agent chemotherapy is an established option based on patient benefit -risk assessment 
(Lordick et al 2016 , Muro et al 2019, National Comprehensive Cancer Networ k 2019 , 
Kitagawa et al 2019). Although second- line treatments with docetaxel and paclitaxel are 
used for patients with advanced ESCC that has progressed after first -line chemotherapy, 
they are associated with h ematological, gastrointestinal, and neurological toxicities 
(Jimenez et al 2011 ) and with poor long -term survival ( Kato et al 2011, Muro et al 2004). 
More recently pembrolizumab has been approved for second -line therapy for ESCC, 
with PD -L1 expression levels by [CONTACT_375439] 10. Similarly, nivolumab has shown positive 
Phase IIIdata in second -line ESCC independent of PD -L1 expre ssion ( Kato et al 2019 ) 
which has le d to the approval of nivolumab for the treatment of patients with 
unresectable advan ced or recurrent esophageal cancer that has progressed following 
chemotherapy in Japan.
2.2.[ADDRESS_469705] for mechanisms of acquired resistance, such as acquisition of mutations which 
make tumors less susceptible to T- cell mediated killing through a loss of interferon 
gamma ( IFNresponse elements or MHC C lass I ( Zaretsky et al 2016 ). PD-1 isa 
checkpoint inhibitor that identifies activated and/or exhausted T -cells including tumor 
infiltrating CD8 T-cells that recognize mutated tumor antigens (neo -antigens) through 
their T -cell receptor (TCR). Up-regulation of additional inhibitory surface membrane 
immune checkpoint proteins has been described following anti -PD-1 treatment. TIM -3 
represents one such molecule co- expressed with PD -1 and induced by [CONTACT_4002] -1 blockade. 
PD-1 and TIM -3 expression correlate with the degree of impairment of tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TILs), effector functions and, consequentially, with a poor prognosis. 
TIM-3 is an emerging checkpoint inhibitory molecule involved in the regulation of 
antitumor immu nity that is expressed on T -cells and innate immune cells (e.g., 
macrophages, dendritic, and natural killer ( NK)cells), where it has been shown to 
suppress their responses upon interaction with their ligands ( Anderson et al 2016 ; Das 
et al 2017 ). Recently, the results of a Phase I study of TSR -022, an anti TIM-3 mAb, 
were reported for patients with advanced solid tumors ( Weiss et al 2017 ).  Overall, TSR -
022 monotherapy was well tolerated across multiple dose levels.  Adverse events were 
manageable and consistent with the safety profiles of other CPIs.

(Sakuishi et al 2010 ).  Similarly, during chronic viral infection, the dual blockade of PD -1 
and TIM -3 enhanced the function of exhausted virus -specific CD8 T -cells 
(Jinet al 2010 ). Indeed, preclinical experiments in PD -1resistant tumors and analysis of 
patient tumor samples showed that TIM -[ADDRESS_469708] a role 
in the mechanism to evade immune response to anti PD-1/PD -L1 therapy 
(Koyama et al 2016 ).  Nevertheless, despi[INVESTIGATOR_375385], the exact 
mechanism for how TIM-3 interferes with anti -tumor immune response and the 
interaction with its putative ligands (e.g., Galectin -9, CEACAM -1, HMGB1 or 
phosphatidylserine) is not fully understood.
2.2.6 Description of RO7121661
RO7121661 is a novel, Fc -silent IgG1 -based BsAb in the 1 [ADDRESS_469709] for binding to T -cells in the tumor 
microenvironment that co- express both PD -1 and TIM-3 or to T -cells expressing PD -1 
alone. This preferential binding avoids the targeting of other TIM -3 expressing cells such 
as myeloid or NK cells. 
An additional feature of RO7121661 is the specifically engineered IgG1 -based Fc -region 
that prevents bi nding to Fc Rs by [CONTACT_375440] ( Kabat et al 1991 ; 
Schlothauer et al 2016). This may avoid tumor -associated macrophage resistance 
mechanisms, which have been observed with IgG4 -based PD -1 antibodies such as 
pembrolizumab and nivolumab ( Arlauckas et al 2017). A schematic of the antibody is
shown in Figure 2.
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, and safety of RO7121661 is 
provided in theRO7121661 Investigator’s Brochure (IB).

2.3 BENEFIT/RISK A SSESSM ENT
Benefit from cancer immunotherapy ( CIT)with CPI [INVESTIGATOR_74241], such as those targeting PD -1/
PD-L1,is predominantly observed in a subset of patients with inflamed tumor 
phenotypes. However, response is not guaranteed even in this patient subset due to 
either primary or acquired resistance mechanisms. Upregulated TIM -3 expression on 
T-cells is associated with T-celldysfunction potentially resulting in baseline or acquired 
resistance to anti -PD-1/PD -L1 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Koyama et al 2016 ). Therefore, TIM -3 
blockade may overcome or prevent resistance mechanisms to anti -PD-1/PD -L1 and help 
restore cytotoxic T -cell proliferation and enhance T -cell function. RO7121661, a novel 
IgG1 -based BsAb that targets the CPI [INVESTIGATOR_375386] -1 and TIM -3, may serve to 
overcome such resistance through ligand blockade and subsequent T-cellre-invigoration 
and/or potentially prevent or delay the development of resistance.
Compared to monospecific PD -1/PD -L1 directed antibodies, one might expect a similar 
safety profile, but better efficacy primarily coming from targeting both PD -1 and TIM -3 
mediat ed immune resistance mechanisms. T he reduction of drug internalization may 
also result in improved clinical pharmacology characteristics compared to monospecific 
antibodies. Compared to monospecific PD -1/PD -L1 and TIM -3 antibody combinations or 
other PD -1/TIM -3 bi-specifics, one anticipates s imilar efficacy in the context of better 
safety due to the preferential targeting of TILs, sparing of the myeloid compartment with 
avoidance of a peripheral sink, and lack of effector function due to the PGLALA mutation 
in the Fc region.

Administration of therapeutic antibodies may cause infusion -related reactions ( IRRs ), 
which may include symptoms such as fever, chills, hypotension, shortness of breath, 
skin rash, headache, nausea, and vomiting.  Such reactions typi[INVESTIGATOR_375388], pre dominantly the first infusion. The incidence and severity

pro-inflammatory cy tokine mediated IRRs upon first administration of RO7121661 as 
single agent is considered low. T he recommended management of IRRs is detailed in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
Administration of therapeutic antibodies may cause the formation of ADAs, which may 
negatively affect the safety of the therapeutic (e.g., allergic reactions, immune

study in cynomolgus monkeys, ADA development was observed independently of the

were observed; no toxicity related to ADA formation w asobserved .
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits in the context of 
potential risks and reasonably expected adverse events ofRO7121661 is provided in the
RO7121661 IB .
Based on the considerations above, currently available data from Part A of this study
and the planned safety monitoring and management guidance, the proposed study 
treatment isconsidered to have an appropriate benefit/risk profile for the population 
included in this study.
COVID -19 Benefit/Risk Assessment
In the setting of the coronavirus disease (COVID -19) pandemic, patients with 
comorbidities (including those with cancer )are a more vulnerable population. Infection 
with sudden acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS -CoV -2) has been 
associated with higher morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer in some 
retrospective analyses. It is unclear how immunotherapy affects the incidence or 
severity of COVID -19. It is not anticipated that treatment with RO7121661 will 
increase the risk of infection with SARS -CoV -2. Severe COVID -19 is associated with a 
cytokine release syndrome (CRS) involving the inflammatory cytokines IL -6, IL -10, IL -
2, and interferon -gamma. RO7121661 hasa low risk of CRS and, while it is not known, 
there may be a potential for an increased risk of an enhanced infla mmatory response if a 
participant develops SARS CoV -[ADDRESS_469714] the effic acy and safety of SARS- CoV -2 vaccination 
(Society for Immunotherapy for Cancer [SITC] 2020).
Per recommendations of the National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) 
COVID -19 Vaccination Advisory Committee, SARS -CoV -2 vaccination is 
recommended for all patients with cancer receiving active therapy (including immune 
checkpoint inhibitors), with the understanding that there are limited safety and efficacy 
data in such patients (NCCN 2021 ). Given the lack of clinical data, currently no 
recommendations can be made regarding the optimal sequence of SARS -CoV -2 
vaccination in patients who are receiving cancer immunotherapy ( SITC 2020 ). For 
patients enrolling in this study and receiving RO7121661, a decision to administer the 

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
45/Protocol NP40435, Version 5vaccine to a patient should be made on an individual basis by [CONTACT_375441].
In alignment with clinical practice procedures, factors to consider when making the 
individualized decision for patients receiving RO7121661 to receive SARS -CoV -2 
vaccination include the following: the risk of SARS- CoV -[ADDRESS_469715] be given in accordance with the approved or 
authorized vaccine label. Receipt of the SARS -CoV -2 vaccine is considered a 
concomitant medication and should be documented as such (see Section 6.5).

4.[ADDRESS_469716] -in-human, open- label, multicenter, Phase I multiple -
ascending dose (MAD) study of single agent RO7121661 . The study consists of 2 parts 
(A and B):
Part A (RO7121661 Dose Escalation): To determine the MTD and/or RDE based on 
safety,tolerability, PK, and/or the PD profile of escalating doses of RO7121661
every 2 weeks (Q2 W). If for specific cleared cohort(s) the safety, PK and/or RO 
and/or the biomarker profile need to be further characterized, additional participants, 
potentially enriched in certain indications and/or characteristics, may be enrolled.
Part B (RO7121661 Tumor -Specific Expansion Cohorts): To evaluate anti -tumor 
activity of the RDE of RO7121661 from Part A ( 2.1g Q2W) and to confirm safety 
and tolerability in participants with selected tumor types. B1, B2 , B4and B 5
expansions may be staggered, sequential or concurrent. Part B3 will not proceed 
prior to generation of data from the initial CPI [INVESTIGATOR_375362](s):
–Part B1: CPI [INVESTIGATOR_375390] b eyond metastatic melanoma
–Part B2: CPI [INVESTIGATOR_375364] -L1 positive 
NSCLC
–Part B3: PD-L1 positive , CPI [INVESTIGATOR_28947]ïve ,first line NSCLC 
–Part B4: CPI-naïve SCLC with prior failure of, progression on, or intolerance to 
standard thera py
–Part B5: CPI-naïve ESCC
Part A of the study will enroll participants with solid tumors who have progressed on a 
cancer therapy or who are not amenable to standard of care. At least  DLT evaluable 
participants will be enrolled in each cohort during the dose escalation (see
Section 4.1.3 ). Dose escalation will be carried out according to a modified 
continual 
reassessment method (mCRM) with escalat ion with overdose control (EW OC) design, 
with the aim of identifying the MTD/RDE of RO7121661.
Since RO7121661 will be administered Q2 W in Part A, the cycle length will be defined 
as 14 days. The maximum total number of participants in the dose escalation portions of 
Part A1 will be approximately  DLT evaluable participants on a Q2W  schedule. A dose 
cohort can be extended to enroll additional participants (approximately ), potentially 
enriched in certain tumor types and/or characteristics to confirm sa fety, PK and/or RO
and/or the biomarker profile. 
Part B1 and/or B2 and/or B4 and/or B5 may commence upon completion of Part A. The 
starting dose of RO7121661 for Part B is 2.1 g Q2W asderived from the RDE in Part A 

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
49/Protocol NP40435, Version 5determined by [CONTACT_49874], PK and/or RO and/or the biomarker profile. Part B3 will not 
proceed prior to generation of data from the initial CPI [INVESTIGATOR_375362](s).
Patients enrolled in Part B expansions have more specific limitations of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_375391]. Patients enrolled in Part B1 (CPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_375392]) must have had treatment with approved anti -PD-L1/anti -PD-1 
checkpoint inhibitors.  Patients enrolled in Part B2 (CPI [INVESTIGATOR_375367] ,PD-
L1expression 1%NSCLC) must have had a c heckpoint inhibitor and platinum 
chemotherapy . Patients enrolled in Part B3 (untreated, CITnaïve NSCLC with PD -L1 
expression 50%) should not have had any prior therapy . Patients enrolled in Part B4 
(CPI [INVESTIGATOR_28947]ïve SCLC) and B5 (CPI-naïve ESCC) should not have had any prior checkpoint 
inhibitor therapy but may have had chemotherapy. Specific details for Part B Expansions 
are included in the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria (Section 5.1and Section 5.2).
In Part B (tumor specific expansion cohorts) approximately  participants will be 
included per indication. Part B cohorts may run in parallel ,staggered or sequentially.
Participants will be treated with RO7121661 until disease progression, unacceptable 
toxicities, or withdrawal of consent. Particip ants may continue treatment with 
RO7121661 (Part A and B) for [ADDRESS_469717] 
Version 1.1 can be considered after consultation and agreement between the Sponsor 
and Investigator.
4.1.1 Length of the Study
The duration of the study for each participant will be up to 27 months (Parts A and B) , 
divided as fo llows :
Screening: Days 28 to 1
Treatment Period: Cycle 1 Day 1 to Month 24 (may be modified if supported by 
[CONTACT_375428]).
Safety follow -up: 60 ( 7) days after last treatment with RO7121661 for Part A; 
90(7) days after last treatment with RO7121661 for Part B.
Survival follow -up: 90 (7) days after last treatment with RO7121661 ;then every 3 
months ( 2 weeks) for total 24- month period after initial dose.
The treatment period may be prolonged past month [ADDRESS_469718] visit at the end of the two -year period. 
Participant s may extend treatment within the ongoing study whether they are on 
treatment or are on a treatment pause at the 24 -month time point. During t he extended 
treatment period , the pa rticipant follows the SoA as indicated for “ Subsequent Cycles .”
Participant s will be treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, or 

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
50/Protocol NP40435, Version 5withdrawal of consent. For participants who extend their treatment , the safety follow -
up will be performed 60(7)days for Part A or 90 (7)days for Part B after the last 
treatment with RO7121661 and survival follow -up every 3 months ( 2 weeks) 
thereafter for a total of 48 months after initial dose, or end of the study. 
4.1.2 Dose -Escalation Decision Criteria
For Part A, RO7121661 dose- escalation will be carried out according to a mCRM with 
EWOC design and will be based on the occurrence of DLTs. The dose -toxicity 
relationship is described by a 2- parameter logistic regression m odel, where the
probability of DLT is expressed as a function of dose. The model is continuously updated 
as additional participant information becomes available (for further information see 
Appendix 10).
A minimum of  participants per cohort will be enrolled and treated in a sequential
manner with one week between the first and second participant and at least [ADDRESS_469719]  participant s per cohort are considered DLT 
evaluable, i.e., if they received 2 doses and either :
experienced a DLT within the DLT period
cleared the DLT period without a DLT
The DLT period is 21 days from Day 1/Cycle 1 to Day 7/Cycle 2. If there is a delay in 
Cycle 2 treatment the DLT period should be adjusted to cover Day 7/Cycle [ADDRESS_469720]  partic ipants per cohort are DLT -evaluable , the logistic regression model 
will be updated with the treatment outcome (i.e., the occurrence of DLT). Thus, a new 
estimate of the MTD (defined as the dose with the highest probability that the DLT rate is 
within the t arget of 20 -35% and a relatively low probability 25% that the DLT rate is 
above 35%) will be derived. In addition, the model will recommend a dose for the new 
cohort of participants, with the E WOC  recommendation being either the new estimate of 
the MTD or the highest allowable dose based on pre -specified safety constraints (e.g. ,
maximum increments), whichever is lower. 
Built in safety constraints are in place to prevent exposing participants to undue risk of 
toxicity. For instance, i n the absence of DL T, the maximum allowable dose- increment 
will be 200% (i.e. ,next dose could be as high as 3- fold theprevious dose) for 
dose- levels 700 mg and 100% (i.e. 2-fold) for dose -levels 700 mg . In addition, i n 
case of one event meeting DLT criteria in a dose -level, the maximum allowable dose 

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
51/Protocol NP40435, Version 5increment becomes 100% (i.e. 2 -fold);while in the presence of 2 DLTs an increment of 
50% is allowed (i.e. 1.5 -fold). For further information see Table 1 in Appendix 10.
The dose escalation decision and selection of the dose for the next cohort, guided by [CONTACT_375443] E WOC recommendation, will also take into account an overall review of safety
and available PK and/or PD data as well as any additional data. Subject to clinical 
judgment, and upon agreement between the Sponsor and the Investigators on the next 
dose- escalation step, the new cohort can then be opened for enrollment . 
The design will continue as described, until one of the pre -defined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_375393] (see Section 4.1.4 ), or the RDE has been defined, whichever comes first.
4.1.3 Dose Limiting Toxicities
For the purpose of this study, a DLT will be defined as any of the following events 
attributed to RO7121661 (i.e., related to RO7121661 ) and occurring during the DLT 
window:
A DLT is defined as a clinically significant AE (classified according to the Natio nal 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE] v .5.0, 
as applicable) or significant laboratory abnormality :1) occurring during the DLT
assessment period of [ADDRESS_469721] RO7121661 administration ; 2) 
considered to be related to study treatment RO7121661 by [CONTACT_11219]; 3) is not 
attributed to disease progression or another clearly identifi able cause.
Investigators are encouraged to perform additional tests to determine the underlying 
etiology and most appropriate attribution.
For the purpose of this study the following AEs are considered DLTs:
Hematological toxicities:
–Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC 0.5109/L) lasting 5days . 
–Grade 3 febrile neutropenia associat ed with single body temperature 38.3° C 
or sustained body temperature 38°C for 1hour, and/or with infection.
–Grade 4 thrombocytopenia lasting 48 hours.
–Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_375394] a 
platelet transfusion.
–Grade 4 anemia
–Grade 3 anemia with hemolysis
Any non -hematological toxicity of Grade 3 including:
–Any Grade 3 immune
-mediated AE.
–Grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia lasting for 48 hours or Grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia.

52/Protocol NP40435, Version 5–Grade [ADDRESS_469722] or ALT elevations w ith hyperbilirubinemia of Grade 2.
–Grade [ADDRESS_469723] or ALT elevations.
–Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea despi[INVESTIGATOR_375395] .
–Grade 3 non -hematological laboratory abnormality requiring medical 
treatment/intervention or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].
The following Grade 3 non -hematological toxicity are exceptions for 
consideration as DLTs: 
–Alopecia (any grade).
–Grade 3 nausea or vomiting that resolves to Grade 1 with or without 
supportive therapy within one week. 
–Grade 3 hypophosphatemia resolved within one week. 
–Grade ≥3 fatigue/asthenia that resolves to Grade 2 within one week. 
–Grade 3 anorexia or constipation.
–IRRs are not considered to be DLTs because, on the basis of experience with 
mAbs, IRRs are not dose -related events. Hence, IRRs that require removal of 
participants from the study will be considered as treatment limiting toxicities 
and not DLTs. Precautions, including pre -medication, will be taken if IRRs of 
Grade 2 occur. If described precautions are not sufficient, other options will 
be discussed between the Sponsor and the Investigator (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
However, re -occurrence of an IRR event in a participant t hat precluded the 
administration of the full dose or the administration of the next scheduled dose 
of study drug will be considered a DLT. If clinical judgment suggests that an 
IRR is related to dose (e.g., driven by [INVESTIGATOR_2394] -target mediated release of cytokines
by [CONTACT_43611]), a Grade 3 or Grade 4 IRR may be considered a DLT. 
–Grade 3 fever (in the absence of any clinically significant source o f fever) that 
resolves to Grade 2 within 7 days with supportive care. 
–Fever 40°C (i.e., Grade 3) that occurs within 48 hours of RO7121661 infusion 
and improves to 40°C (Grade 2) within 48 hours and fully resolves within 
one week. 
–Grade 3 arthralgia that can be adequately managed with supportive care or 
that improves/resolves to Grade 2 within one week.

infusion and recovers to Grade 1 or baseline within one week. 
Failure to recover from any RO7121661 -related toxicity that results in a dose -delay of 
thenext scheduled administration of more than 14 days is defined as a DLT.
4.1.4 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_375396]
[IP_ADDRESS] Part A  Dose Escalation
The algorithm of the mCRM with E WOC will propose to stop the dose escalation under 
the following circumstances: 
The m aximum sample size of  evaluable participants has been reached OR 
Enough information on MTD has been achieved ( i.e., at least a minimum of 
participants enrolled andat least participant s have been accrued near the 
MTD dose -where near is defined as differing from t he MTD by [CONTACT_375444] 15% -and
the probability that the MTD dose lies within the target toxicity interval is above 
50%)
OR 
The maximum dose has been tested and is considered safe (i.e.,at least a 
minimum of participants have been accrued at the maximum do se or near -
differing from the maximum dose by [CONTACT_375444] 5% -andit is at least 50% likely that 
the probability of a DLT for that maximum dose is below 20% ). 
Due to the exploratory nature of this clinical study, any part of its conduct can be 
discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Sponsor. This will not constitute a 
premature termination of the study. The Sponsor will notify the Investigators and Health 
Authorities if the study is discontinued or the development program is terminated.
4.1.5 Communication Strategy
For Part A: Upon completion of all screening evaluations and confirmation that a 
participant has met all inclusion and exclusion criteria, investigator sites will contact [CONTACT_375445], participant number and cohort assignment via a 
Confirmation of Enrollment form (ESF). This will guarantee that the Sponsor is notified 

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
54/Protocol NP40435, Version 5prior to the administration of RO7121661 to any participant. Then sites will need to 
contact [CONTACT_375446] ( IRT) vendor who will generate 
confirmation of participant number, dose and cohort assignment. The IRT participant 
number should be generated prior to first dose.
For Part B: An Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system will be utilized to manage 
(pre-) screening and enrollm ent. All pre -screening evaluations must be recorded in the 
IRT system with a proposed cohort. [COMPANY_002] will review and approve the pre -screened 
participants for the proposed cohort. After signing informed consent, the screening 
transaction should be performed in the IRT system and once it is confirmed that 
participants meet all eligibility criteria the participants should be enrolled in the 
respective cohort using the IRT system .
A participant Enrollment List must be maintained by [CONTACT_737].
In Part A: After each participant receives RO7121661 the Investigator(s) must confirm to 
the Sponsor that the participant has been dosed and provide a brief summary of the 
status of the participant in terms of safety and tolerability to RO7121661. The 
Investigators and the Sponsor will communicate regularly and on an ad -hoc basis to 
discuss the occurrence of any safety events including DLTs. 
In the event of a DLT, the Investigator will contact [CONTACT_13130] (within 
1business day via DLT notification form) to discuss participant status and action 
taken/to be taken. 
In addition, as outlined above, during dose -escalation , after each participant cohort has 
been completed (i.e., at least  participants are DLT evaluable), the Sponsor will 
organize a teleconfere nce with the Investigators to discuss the safety and tolerability of 
RO7121661 and to discuss the proposed dose(s) for the next cohort. The 
dose- escalation decision criteria are outlined in Section 4.1.2 . 
During these teleconferences, NCI CTCAE Version 5.0toxicities will be discussed along 
with the results of any available PK /PDdata, in addition to safety laboratory results and 
any other available data that may assist the dose -escalation decision process. The 
decision will be based on all relevant available data and not based solely on DLT 
information, as well as being guided by [CONTACT_375447] -EWOC recommendation.
Study Investigators and the Sponsor should reach a consensus on the next dose -level 
which may include dose escalation, de-escalation , or recruitment into the current or 
particular previously cleared cohorts .Dose -escalation mayproceed to the next dose 
level if the Investigators and the Sponsor are satisfied with the safety profile of the 
previous participant cohort and agree to move to the next escalated dose level or 
whether to de -escalate and/or extend recruitment into part icular cohorts.  The dose 
discussion will be documented in writing, including the final dose decision whether it is 

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
55/Protocol NP40435, Version 5the mCRM recommended dose, or an intermediate dose, and both the Sponsor and 
Investigators will approve the Minutes of these meetings to con firm agreement. 
In addition to these communications, the Sponsor and Investigators will be in regular 
contact [CONTACT_375448]/telephone/fax per normal interactions during the 
conduct of a clinical study and the Sponsor will arrange regular t eleconferences and 
meetings to discuss the study status. The Sponsor will be available [ADDRESS_469724] of this 
study.
4.2 JOINT MONITORING COMMITTEE
In Part B of the study, the Spo nsor will in addition form a Joint M onitoring Committee 
(JMC), with the aim to monitor participant s’ safety throughout. The JMC will consist of 
designated Sponsor personnel, including a JMC Chair, clinical scientist, drug safety 
officer, biostatistician, a nd independent clinical expert(s) (i .e., expert[s] independent from 
the Sponsor).
The JMC will conduct regular assessments on an ongoing basis of the incidence and 
nature of AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events of special interest (AESI), 
frequency of death from all causes, and clinically significant laboratory abnormalities. 
The JMC will review all safety study data at regular int ervals, as defined in the JMC 
charter.
At the time of each review, the JMC will make one of the following recommendations: the 
study may continue unchanged, the study is to be stopped, additional analyses are to be 
performed, enrollment is to be held pendi ng further safety evaluations, or a protocol 
amendment is recommended. The JMC will report recommendations to the Sponsor.
4.3 SCIENTIFIC RATIONA LE FOR STUDY DESIGN
The study rationale is provided in Section 2.1.
For Part A, RO7121661 dose escalation will be carried out according to a mCRM with 
EWOC design and will be based on the occurrence of DLTs. 
The mCRM E WOC design has many favorable character istics:
It adaptively fits a dose DLT response curve by [CONTACT_375449], and preclinical or clinical information 
from compounds with similar modes of action via the prior.
The design also loca tes the MTD efficiently without pre -specifying exact dose 
levels for each cohort. Dose selections are made based on the DLT dose response 
curve measured by a [ADDRESS_469725] to 
clinical judgment and mandated safety c onstraints that limit the size of dose 
increments. Moreover, the E WOC  algorithm highly reduces risks of exposing 

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
56/Protocol NP40435, Version 5participants to overly toxic doses.  Of note, the model provides only the upper limit 
for recommended dose.  A dose less than the model recomme nded dose may be 
selected based on clinical judgment. 
Such model based designs have been successfully applied in many Phase I dose 
escalation studies (Schöffski et al 2004 ; Le Tourneau et al 2009; Neuenschwander et al 
2008).
In addition, hypothetical dose escalation runs using the design and simulations 
demonstrate the validity of the parameters of the design as implemented for this study 
(Appendix 10).
For Part B, RO7121661 will be administered at the determined MTD/RDE to specific 
participant populations in expansion cohorts .From the data available from Part A, a 
dosing regimen of 2.1 g Q2 W was selected as the dose for Part B expansion cohorts.
Please refer to Section 4.4for further rationale.
4.3.1 Rationale for Study Population
Part A dose -escalation o f this study will enroll participants with advanced and/or 
metastatic solid tumors who have progressed on a cancer therapy or for whom no 
effective standard therapy exists. In the event that additional data is required to confirm 
PK, PD, safety, etc., additional participants , potentially enriched in certain tumor types
and/or characteristics , may be enrolled.
Part B of this study will enroll melanoma patients who have progressed on prior CPI (B1) 
or NSCLC patients who are CPI [INVESTIGATOR_375397] (B2) and CPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_28947]ïve SCLC (B4) and ESCC patients (B5) . If exploration is supported by [INVESTIGATOR_357398] 
[INVESTIGATOR_375398] B1 and/or B2, then Part B of this study will also enroll 
NSCLC patients who are CIT and chemotherapy naïve (B3). SCLC and ESCC patients 
who are CPI [INVESTIGATOR_28947]ïve may enroll without data from B1 or B2.
Data from PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitors which are approved or in development as described in 
Section 2.2, have demonstrated clinical benefit in the NSCLC and melanoma 
populations. T herefore, CPI [INVESTIGATOR_375399]-1and TIM -3targeting with the potential of providing particip ants an 
opportunity for therapeutic benefit if continued PD-1targeting in combination with 
targeting TIM-3can help re -initiate or improve on the anti -PD-1/PD -L1 CPI [INVESTIGATOR_163792]. 
Recent data from PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitors demonstrate benefit in both the previou sly 
treated and untreated SCLC population (see Section 2.2.2 ). In addition, there is early but 
limited data suggesting potential activity of a monospecific TIM -3 antibody in SCLC, thus 
suggesting a potential role of TIM -3 (Harding et al 2019 ). 
Additionally , CPI [INVESTIGATOR_28947]ïve ESCC patients who are refractory or intolerant to combination 
therapy with fluoropyrimidine and platinum -based drugs (B3) will be enrolled. Recent 

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
57/Protocol NP40435, Version 5data from PD -1 inhibitor s demonstrate benefit in the ESCC population (see
Section 2.2.4 ). Compared to esophageal adenocarcinoma PD -L1 expression is enriched 
in ESCC, which might increase tumor susceptibility in these patients to elimination 
following immune checkpoint inhibition. The reported prevalence of PD -L1 expression in 
ESCC ranges from 15% to 83% in tumor cells, and from 13% to 31% in tumor -infiltrated 
immune cells ( Jiang et a l 2017 , Lam et al 2017 ,.Guo et al 2018, Qu et al 2016 ). TIM -3 
has also been shown to be expressed on TILs in patients with ESCC (Zhao et al. 2020). 
RO7247669 may therefore have the potential to be a therapeutic option for patients with 
ESCC.
For CITnaïve previously untreated NSCLC patients, focus will be on thos e participants 
with at least 50% PD -L1 expression as based on pembrolizumab study KEYNOTE- 024 
(Reck et al 2016 ),as these are participant s felt to have the highest opportunity for 
response to P D-1 therapy and therefore may gain additive activity from the TIM -3 
mechanism of the BsAb.
Other indications may be explored in the tumor -specific expansion cohorts in Part B 
based on emerging clinical data from the Part A dose -escalation and/or based on 
emerging scientific rationale. These additional indications may be proposed and added 
to this study for Part B via an amendment.
4.3.2 Rationale for Biomarker A ssessments
Biomarker exploration will focus on PD effects associated with anti -PD-1/TIM-3therapy . 
Adriving hypothesis is that PD-1/TIM-3dual blockade will increase T-cell infiltration and 
proliferation in the tumor microenvironment provided sufficient RO(or drug coverage) is 
obtained.
Fresh tumor b iopsies will be collected according to the SoA (see Section 1.3), to 
measure changes in the d egree and extent of T -cell infiltration ( such as CD8/Ki67) and 
select inflammatory gene expression profiles/signatures .
In peripheral blood, serial blood sampling will be done to assess kinetic changes in drug 
RO, immune cellular profile sands
elect edcytokines .The analysis of cytokines during 
study treatment has demonstrated increases of interleukin ( IL)-6, IL- 8, and IFN in 
previous CPI[INVESTIGATOR_375400] -of-action. These cytokines 
may also be important in the context of drug safety and might therefore be analyzed in 
the case of (severe) AEs. Furthermore, s
oluble CD25, which has been descri bed as a 
circulating marker of IL-2mediated immune cell activation ( Ribas et al 2009 )may be 
measured at baseline and select edtime points after initial treatment. Additionally, 
peripheral blood will be collected to assess kinetic changes , such as TMB and potentially 
circulating tumor DNA (ct DNA ).
Whether predictive markers of response to therapy exist for RO7121661 and for w hich 
cancer type or clinical settings will also be explored. The hypothe
sis that PD-1/TIM -3 

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
58/Protocol NP40435, Version 5dual blockade might be most effective in settings where there is a composite profile 
consisting of but not limited to T-cell infiltration/activation , PD-L1 status, PD -1and TIM-[ADDRESS_469726] been selected on the basis of the integration of several factors 
including non- clinical toxicology, PK and in -vitro/ex -vivo functional assays.
RO7121661 was well tolerated in both the dose range finding and GLP monkey 
toxicology studies up to the highest dose evaluated (150 mg/kg).  Toxicology findings 
were consistent with reported findings in cynomolgus monkey studies with marketed 
CPIs . 
The safety profile of the proposed Q2 W dosing regimen for RO7121661 administration in 
human has been supported by a more frequent dosing (QW  schedule) in non -clinical 
toxicology studies conducted in cynomolgous monkeys. The entry -into-human starting 
dose of 70 mg Q2 W (corresponding to a 1 mg/kg Q2 W in an average 70 -kgweight 
participant) fo r the dose- escalation portion of this study was derived from a translational 
PK/PD approach, which was informed by [CONTACT_375450] 
B superantigen -induced (SEB) cytokine release assays as well as clinical safety 
experience wi th pembrolizumab, nivolumab (anti PD-1), other PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitors, 
and TSR -022, a mAb directed against the TIM-3 receptor.   Since there are extensive 
clinical (safety) data available from PD -1 inhibitors, a non -MABEL (minimum anticipated 
biological effe ct level) approach using PK/PD was considered appropriate to estimate a 
safe starting dose.  The PK/PD approach is expected to reduce the number of 
participants exposed to sub -pharmacological doses of RO7121661 while ensuring that 
the starting dose is in a safe range.  The projected area under the curve ( AUC) 0-336and 
maximum concentration ( Cmax)in humans at the flat dose of 70 mg after single dose 
(Q2W) are 3900 μgh/mL and 25.2 μg/mL ,respectively.  These values are 
approximately 180 -and 116 -fold lower, respectively, than the exposure observed in 
cynomolgus monkeys at the 150 mg/kg NOAEL in the 4- week GLP toxicology study 
(differences in potency and dosing schedule were accounted for) .For further information 
RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
59/Protocol NP40435, Version 5on exposure ratios from non-clinical safety findings to human exposures for single 
administration and steady state, see Appendix 11.
Human PK simulation via allometric scaling of the linear clearance data from 
cynomolgus monkey is consistent with an IgG -like PK, with a projected human half -life of 
~19 days at target -mediated drug disposition (TMDD)- saturated doses. At lower doses,
RO7121661 is predicted to show a more rapid clearance due to TMDD. 
The safe starting dose is predicted to show a maximal response in an ex vivo SEB
cytokine release assay up to 70% ( with unknown TIM -3 contribution) which should result 
in pharmacologic alactivityin participant s. To support comparison of these functional 
assays, pembrolizumab, another PD -1 inhibitor currently on the market where tolerable 
doses (no DLT observed) up to 10 mg/kg Q2 W were investigated, was included for 
benchmarking. The star ting dose selected for pembrolizumab was 1 mg/kg and showed 
full saturation in target engagement in these assays ( Patnaik et al 2015 ).
Compared to a classical MABEL approach, the approach used here reduces the number 
of participants exposed to sub- therapeutic dos es of  RO7
121661 while ensuring that the 
starting -dose is in a safe range.
The initially proposed Q2W  dosing interval is supported by [CONTACT_375451] -life (t 1/2) of RO7121661 with a projected human elimination t 1/2 of 
approximat ely 19 days.
A maximum feasible dose of 2.1 g of RO7121661 has been defined based on p redicted 
IC95for PD -1/TIM-3 of approximately 320g/mL and c onfidence in ex vivo and in vitro 
SEB data and benchmarking results to pembrolizumab . Based on product specif ications, 
the dosing is currently limited to 2.[ADDRESS_469727] not be exceeded under any 
circumstances. In case dose escalation is planned to progress beyond 2.1 g, the 
corresponding chemistry, manufacturing, control (CMC) documents and protocol will be 
amend ed as appropriate.
Flat dosing was selected for this protocol because no strong influence of body surface 
area (BSA) or body weight on overall exposure is expected. On the basis of the PK data 
emerging from this clinical study, any potential covariates on exposure to RO7121661, 
such as BSA, body weight, age, ethnicity and gender will be explored in order to confirm 
this dosing approach.
In conclusion, a 70 mg flat dose is proposed as the starting dose of RO7121661 for 
Part A, on the basis of both data from nonclinical studies with RO7121661 and previous 
clinical experiences with PD -1/PD -L1 and TIM -3 inhibitors.

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
60/Protocol NP40435, Version 5Part B
From the data available from Part A of this study , a dosing regimen of 2 .1g Q2 W was 
selected as the dose for P art B expansion cohorts. This was based on RO7121661 
being well tolerated in the patients dosed in Part A where no specific safety concern 
associated with RO7121661 was identified. One DLT (Grade 3 Troponin T increased) 
was observed at the 1200 mg dose gro up, however no MTD was identified.
Atwo compartment alPK linear model predicts the exposure data well, particularly at the 
higher dose range and supports adose of 2 .1g at Q2 Wfor further investigation. A dose 
regimen of 2 .1mg Q W is predicted to result in a trough concentration of >320 µg/mL, the 
predicted EC95 from an ex vivo SEB cytokine assay, in 62% of patients. The dose and 
regimen may be optimized based on ongoing exposure -response analysis.
The supporting data for the RDE from Part A can be found in the current RO7121661

6.1.1 RO7121661
Ro712-1661 /F01-[ADDRESS_469739] can be administered IV, either undiluted or diluted, as 
directed in the study protocol and the Pharmacy Manual . If diluted, Ro 712-1661 /F01-[ADDRESS_469740] be diluted either in 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride solution or in the 
Sponsor’s diluent , Ro712-1661 /F02-01, as directed in the Pharmacy Manual . A 0.[ADDRESS_469741] be mandatorily used with the infusion set during administrati on.
In Part A, the initial dose and subsequent infusions of RO7121661 will be delivered over 
12010minutes (although the infusion may be slowed or interrupted for participants 

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
73/Protocol NP40435, Version 5who experience infusion -associated symptoms ; see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), followed by a 
90-minute observation period. If no IRR has been reported, the catheter may be 
removed at the end of the observation period.
In Part B, t he initial dos eof RO7121661 will be del ivered over 120 10minutes 
(although the infusion may be slowed or interrupted for participants who experience 
infusion- associated symptoms ; see Section [IP_ADDRESS]), followed by a 90- minute 
observation period. If the 120-minute infusion is tolerated without infusion -associated 
AEs, the second infusion may be delivered over 60 10 minutes, followed by a 60 
minute observation period. If the 60 -minute infusion is well- tolerated, all subsequent 
infusions may be delivered over 30 10 minutes, followed by a 30 -minute observation 
period. If no IRR has been reported, the catheter may be removed at the end of the 
observation period.
During infusion, vital signs (inc luding, if possible, supi[INVESTIGATOR_375406], pulse rate, and temperature) must be monitored as described in the SoA 
(Section 1.3). Vital signs during the infusion are not required to be captured in the eCRF, 
unless abnormalities are observed.
If feasible, the line for drawing blood for PK samples (opposite extremity to the one with 
the infusion line) will remain in place until the 24-hour sample is taken.
Dose, date, and time of the infusion start, date and time of end of infusion, total dose 
administered, interruption or adjustment of infusion rate, and reason will be recorded for 
each participant. If the infusion is interrupted, the date and time of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_375407].
6.1.[ADDRESS_469742] administration of RO712 1661.
However, if administered, all pre-medications should be captured as concomitant 
medications in the part icipant’s electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ).
If Grade 2 IRRs or tumor inflammatory events occur in the majority of participants 
during dose escalation, the utility of prophylactic pre -medications including paracetamol 
and antihistamine may be considered for newly enrolled participants and premedication 
regimen and schedule should be discussed between Sponsor and Investigator(s).  
Participants who experienced a Grade 2 or higher IRR on a previous infusion should be 
pre-medicated for subsequent infusions. Premedication regimens for subsequent cycles 
may be reduced or omitted in case of Grade 1 events in the previous cycle.
Paracetamol (500 -1000 mg oral [PO] or IV) and diphenhydr amine (25- 50 mg PO or 
IV; or an alternative histamine H1/[ADDRESS_469743] at an adequate dose). If a 

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
74/Protocol NP40435, Version 5participant experienced a Grade 3 IRR, the same will apply in addition to 
corticosteroid 200 mg hydrocortisone IV (or equivalent dose of another 
corticosteroid ).
For participants who experience an IRR -like reaction with a single and isolated 
symptom, such as fever that occurs within 24 hours after the study treatment infusion 
was completed, the use of pre -medication such as paracetamol, anti -histamine, and 
corticosteroids is not foreseen prior to subsequent RO7121661 administrations. The 
event will be reported as a single AE (e.g., fever). Pre -medication with corticosteroids for 
those participants at subsequent infusions needs approval from the Sponsor and the
treatment and management at the time of a single and isolated event is at the discretion 
of the Investigator.
All pre- medications should be captured as concomitant medications in the participant’s 
electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).
6.2 PREPA RATION/HA NDLING /STORA GE/A CCOUNTA BILITY

RO7121661 related).
If the toxicity does not resolve to NCI CTCAE Grade 2 for hematological toxicities 
or 1 for non -hematological toxicities and the participant is unable to resume treatment
with RO7121661 after t his time (omission of two doses), no additional doses will be 
administered and the participant will be withdrawn from study treatment, unless the 
participant exhibits a clinical benefit and this is discussed by [CONTACT_375455]. It should be noted that infusions/cycles not occurring at the anticipated 
schedule, are considered as delayed, not missed.
Further dose -reductions may be implemented once safety and toxicity data from the 
dose- escalation have been evaluated.
For participants with documented liver metastasis and elevated liver function test (LFT) 
results at baseline, further elevations of LFT results may not require dose interruptions if 
there are no progressive changes in the ALT and/or AST (less than a doubling) and if 
there are no progressive elevations in total bilirubin or international normalized ratio 
(INR).
Investigators are encouraged to contact [CONTACT_375456]. After 
Cycle 1 is completed, dose modifications should be discussed with the Sponso r. In these 
instances, a confirmation with the Sponsor is requested and documentation in the eCRF 
is requested. Treatment delays of up to 3 days due to logistical considerations (e.g., 
center closure for holiday) are generally acceptable and do not need to be discussed 
with the Sponsor. In no instance are cycles shorter than 14 days of duration (i.e. Q2W) 
allowed in this study.
For participant s on treatment for at least [ADDRESS_469746] -procedure, assuming 
normal recovery (see Section 7.1.1 for temporary interruption or dose delay ). This can 

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
78/Protocol NP40435, Version 5be done to allow particip ants who could potentially benefit from RO7121661 to remain 
on the study treatment.

7. DISCONTINUA TION OF STUDY TRE ATMENT A ND
PARTICIP ANT DISCONTINUA TION/WIT HDRA WAL
An excessive rate of withdrawals (either participants discontinuing study treatment or 
withdrawing from the study) can render the study non -interpretable. Therefore, 
unnecessary withdrawal of participants should be avoided and efforts should be taken to 
motiv ate participants to comply with all the study specific procedures as outlined in this 
protocol.
Details on study and site closures are provided in Appendix 1Study Governance 
Considerations Study.
7.1 DISCONTINUA TION OF STUDY TREATMENT
See the SoA ( Section 1.3)for data to be collected at the time of treatment 
discontinuation and follow -up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed.
Participants must permanently discontinue study treatment if they experience any of the 
following (also see Appendix 6):
Intolerable toxicity related to study treatment, including development of an immune 
mediated adverse event determined by [CONTACT_375457] 's potential response to therapy and severity of the event
Pregnancy .
Grade 4 IRR.
IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis.
Any toxicity which is not manageable with dose delays (as allowed per protocol), 
dose decrease, and appropriate treatment.
Unacceptable toxicity as determined by [CONTACT_10670].  

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
79/Protocol NP40435, Version 5For cardiac changes: 
oIf a clinically significant finding is identified (including, but not limited to 
QTcF 500 ms and/or an increase of 60 ms in QTcF from screening), 
the Investigator or qualified designee will determine if the participant can 
continue in the study and if any change in clinical management is needed. 
This review of the ECG printed at the time of collection must be 
documented. Any new clinically relevant f inding should be reported as an 
AE. 
Any medical condition that the Investigator or Sponsor determines may jeopardize 
the participant ’s safety if he or she continues in the study. 
Investigator or Sponsor determines it is in the best interest of the partic ipant . 
Participant non-compliance, specifically defined as disregarding protocol. 
Symptomatic disease progression when there is a consensus that the participant 
will not benefit from study treatment.
As with other immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], treatment beyond RECIST Version 1.[ADDRESS_469748] Version 1.1 (e.g., radiological progression secondary 
to tumor inflammation): 
Absence of clinical ly important symptoms and signs (including worsening of 
laboratory values) indicat ive of disease progression
Investigator -assessed potential clinical benefit for the participant 
The participant is tolerating study drugs. 
No decline in ECOG performance status .
Absence of rapid progres sion of disease or of progressive tumor at critical
anatomical sites (e.g., cord compression) requiring urgent alternative medical 
intervention.
Participants who discontinue study treatment will be asked to return to the clinic for an 
End-of-Treatment visit (see Section 8.10.3 ) and may undergo follow -up assessments 
(see Section 8.10.4 ). The primary reason for study treatment discontinuation should be 
documented on the appropriate eCRF. 
Participants who discontinue study treatment prematurely may be replaced for the 
following reasons to ensure adequate numbers of evaluable participants:
Participant who withdraws from the study prior to the treatment start may be 
replaced and will not be ente red into the database.

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
80/Protocol NP40435, Version 5Participants who fail to complete their DLT assessment period because of non -drug-
related reasons.
In the case of a major protocol violation participants will be excluded from the 
MTD/DLT analysis but might continue the treatment if deemed beneficial, and if there 
is no safety concern associated with the protocol violation criteria and according to 
clinical judgment. 
Participants will be treated until disease progression, loss of clinical benefit, 
unacceptable toxicities, or withdraw al from treatment for other reasons, or death.
7.1.1 Temporary  Interruption
Before permanently discontinuing study treatment (regardless of whether initiated by [CONTACT_2416], the Investigator or Sponsor), an interruption should be considered. 
Participants, wh o have temporarily interrupted study treatment, should be considered to 
re start as soon as medically justified in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689].
Dose interruptions for reason(s) other than toxicity, such as surgical procedures, may be 
allowed. The accep table length of interruption will depend on the discussion between the 
Investigator and the Medical Monitor.
In case of toxicity requiring RO7121661 treatment to be put on hold, the study treatment 
should only re -start once the toxicities have resolved to NCI CTCAE Grade 2 for 
hematological toxicities or Grade 1 for non -hematological toxicities. Participants who 
do not recover from drug -related toxicities after omission of up to 2 doses (delay of 4
weeks in the Q 2W schedule) of RO712 1661 and who in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_375409]712 1661 treatment, should be permanently 
discontinued from the study. 
Ifin the judgment of the Investigator, the participant is likely to derive clinical benefit from 
RO7121661 after a hold of more than 2 doses, study drug may be re -started.
If an IRR develops, the infusion of RO7121161 should be slowed down or interrupted. 
The participant should be monitored until complete resolution of the symptoms and 
treated as clinically indicated. Treatment or concomitant medication may include 
acetaminophen/paracetamol, antihistamine, IV saline, oxygen, bronchodilators, 
corticosteroids, and vasopressors, depending on the symptoms (see Section 8.3.8). 
Study treatment should be re -started as soon as medically justified in th e opi[INVESTIGATOR_684].
7.1.2 Resumption of Study Treatment
If a participant has a complete response (CR) or achieves maximum clinical benefit as 
determined by [CONTACT_375458], biopsy results (if available), and clinical status, the study treatment 

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
81/Protocol NP40435, Version 5may be paused at the discretion of the treating physician after discussion with the
Medical Monitor. The participant may remain on study and be followed according to the 
SoA ( Section 1.3). If the disease relapses or progresses, the study treatment may be 
resumed after consultation with the Medical Monitor.
7.2 PARTICIP ANT DISCONTI NUA TION/ WITHDRA WAL FROM THE 
STUDY
Participants have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time for any 
reason.
In addition, the I nvestigator has the right to withdraw a participant from the study for 
medical conditions that the I nvestigator or Sponsor determines ,may jeopardize the 
participant’s safety if he/she continues in the study . Reasons for withdrawal from the 
study may include, but are not limited to, the following:
Any medical condition that the Investigator or Sponsor determines may jeopardize 
the participant ’s safety if he/she continues in the study.
Investigator or Sponsor determines it is in the best interest of the participant .
Participant non-compliance.
If possible, information on reason for withdrawal from the study should be obtained. The 
primary reason for withdrawal from the study should be d ocumented on the appropriate 
eCRF. Participants will not be followed for any reason after consent has been withdrawn.
When a participant voluntarily withdraws from the study, or is withdrawn by [CONTACT_3786], samples collected until the date of withdraw al will be analyzed, unless the 
participant specifically requests for these to be discarded or local laws require their 
immediate destruction. However, if samples have been tested prior to withdrawal, results 
from those tests will remain as part of the ove rall research data. A participant's 
withdrawal from this study does not, by [CONTACT_5071], constitute withdrawal of specimens 
donated to the Research Biosample Repository (RBR) .
Participants who withdraw from the study for safety reasons will not be replaced. 
Participants who withdraw from the study for other reasons will be replaced (see 
Section 7.1).
See SoA ( Section 1.3) for data to be collected at the time of study discontinuation and at 
safety and follow -upvisits, and for any further evaluations that need to be completed.

return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_9298].

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
82/Protocol NP40435, Version 5The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the cli nic for a 
required study visit:
The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_14315], counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the part icipant wishes to 
and/or should continue in the study .
Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the Investigator or designee must 
make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635]. These contact [CONTACT_375459]’s medical record.
Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to 
have withdrawn from the study.
Discontinuation of sites or of study as a whole are handled as part of Appendix 1.
8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS A ND PROCEDURES
Study procedures and their time-points are summarized in the Schedules of Activities 
(SoA; Section 1.3).Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed.
Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue 
study treatment.
Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management 
(e.g., blood count) and obtained before signing of the Informed Consent Form ( ICF) may 
be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure met the 
protocol -specified criteria and were performed within the time-frame defined in the SoA.
Certain s amples for exploratory tests will be sent to one or several central laborat ories or 
to the Sponsor for analysis. Instruction manuals and supply kits will be provided for all 
central laboratory assessments.
Based on continuous analysis of the data in this study, any sample type or time-point or 
biomarker evaluation not considered to be critical for safety may be stopped at any time 
if the data from the samples collected does not produce useful information.
8.[ADDRESS_469750] Version 1 .1 (see Appendix 7)
and modified criteria for immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ( see Appendix 8for iRECIST ). Response will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_375460] (or 
magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) of chest, abdomen, and pelvis as defined i n the SoA
(Section 1.3). CT scans of the neck should be included, if clinically indicated. Ultrasound 
and X rays are not acceptable for monitoring tar get lesions. All measurable disease must 

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
83/Protocol NP40435, Version 5be documented at Screening and re assessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation. 
Consistency of consecutive CT scans (or MRIs) should be ensured during all 
assessments for each participant; the same method of assessm ent (preferable also by 
[CONTACT_375461]) and the same technique must be used to evaluate lesions throughout 
the entire study. Use of CT (or MRI) is required for baseline lesions [ADDRESS_469751] be used throughout the study (e.g., the same contrast protocol for CT scan s). 
Tumor measurements should be made by [CONTACT_49238]/Radiologist for each 
participant during the study to the extent that this is feasible. At the Investigator’s 
discretion, CT scans may be repeated at any time if progressive disease is suspected . 
In case of clinically measurable superficial (such as skin) lesions, repeated photographs 
should be used to document tumor response (Section 8.1.2 ).
The data collected for RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_469752] working gr oup in an effort to harmonize immune -based 
response criteria across the academic and industrial cancer immunotherapy field
(Appendix 8).
In the absence of clinical deterioration, any initial assessment of radiological progressive 
disease or mixed response should be confirmed by a repeat evaluation at the next time 
point for tumor assessment. As with other immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], treatment beyond R ECIST 
progression could be considered after approval of the Sponsor. The criteria needed for 
continuing treatment beyond initial apparent progressive disease (e.g., radiological 
progression secondary to tumor inflammation) are described in Section 7.1.2 .
Tumor assessment will be performed at the time points described in the SoA 
(Section 1.3). All tumor assessments after baseline may be done within 7 days of the 
scheduled visit. Confirmation of objective responses (partial and complete responses) 
will be done at the next scheduled visit after at least [ADDRESS_469753] be completed at that time indicating disease 
progression. At the Investigator’s discretion, CT scans ma y be repeated at any time if 
progressive disease is suspected.

they may be considered non- target lesions.

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
84/Protocol NP40435, Version 5Photographs of cutaneous lesions will be taken at screening and on the same day as
tumor assessment visit or at the first clinic visit following each tumor assessment.
8.2 SAFETY ASSESSMENT S
Planned time- points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA ( Section 1.3).On 
dosing days, the safety assessments are to be performed prior to the study treatment 
administration. If the assessments have been performed within maximum 72 hours prior 
to dosing, they do not need to be repeated on the scheduled dosing day.
8.2.1 Physical Examinations
A complete physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the 
cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal , dermatological and neurological, 
musculoskeletal in addition to head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck and lymph nodes 
systems. Height and weight will also be measured and recorded. Further examination of 
other body systems may be performed in case of evoc ative symptoms at the 
Investigator’s discretion.
A brief physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the skin, 
lungs, cardiovascular system, and abdomen (liver and spleen)
Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs rel ated to previous 
serious illnesses.
Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical 
History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. At subsequent visits (or as clinically indicated), 
limited, symptom -directed physical examinations sh ould be performed. Changes from 
baseline abnormalities should be recorded in participant’s notes. New or worsened 
clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse 
Event eCRF.
8.2.2 Royal Marsden Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_375410]
(Arkenau et al 2008).  This risk based score is derived from: (LDH normal 0 vs 
LDHUNL1, albumin 35 g/L 0 vs 35 g/L 1, site of metastasis 20 vs 21).
8.2.3 Eastern Cooperative Oncology  Group Performance Status
The ECOG Performance Status will be assessed as specified in the SoA ( Section 1.3). It 
is recommended, where possible, that a participant’s Performance Status will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_73472].
8.2.4 Vital Signs
Routine vital signs including supi[INVESTIGATOR_375411], pulse rate, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature will be assessed as specified in the SoA (see 
Section 1.3), inclu ding during infusions of RO7121661.  Vital signs during the infusion 
are not required to be captured in the eCRF, unless abnormalities are observed.

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
85/Protocol NP40435, Version 5Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be assessed with a completely automated 
device. Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not available. 
When possible, the same arm should be used for all blood pressure measurements. 
Blood pressure and pulse measurements should be preceded by {at least 5 minutes} of 
rest for the participant in a q uiet setting without distractions (e.g., television, cell phones).
Participants experiencing Grade [ADDRESS_469755] infusion. In case of drop in 
blood pressure associated with hemodynamic instability and/or abnormal HR, 
particularly arrhythmia, RO7121661 administration should be interrupted and the 
participant should be fully monit ored until normal cardiac function is regained.
8.2.5 Electrocardiograms
Triplicate 12 -lead ECG will be obtained as outlined in the SoA (see Section 1.3) using an 
ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR interval , 
QRS complex , QT interv al, and QT corrected for heart rate (QTc)interval. Refer to 
Section 7.1for QTc withdrawal criteria and additional QTc readings that may be 
necessary.
At each time -point at which triplicate ECGs are required, three individual ECG tracings 
should be obtained as closely as possible in succession, but no more than 
approximately 2 minutes apart. The average of the 3 readings will be used to determine 
ECG intervals (e.g. , PR, QRS, and QT). Additional unscheduled ECG assessments 
should be performed in case of abnormalities and if clinical symptoms occur. ECGs for 
each participant should be obtained from the same machine whenever possible.
To minimize variability, it is important that participants be in a resting position for at 
least 10minutes prior to each ECG evaluation. Body position should be consistently 
maintained for each ECG evaluation to prevent changes in heart rate. Environmental 
distractions (e.g., television, radio, conversation) should be avoided during the pre -ECG 
resting period and during ECG recording. ECGs should be performed prior to meals and
any scheduled vital sign measurements and blood draws. In some cases, it may be 
appropriate to repeat abnormal EC Gs to rule out improper lead placement as 
contributing to the ECG abnormality.
For safety monitoring purposes, the Investigator or designee must review, sign, and date 
all ECG tracings. Paper or electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_260046]’s 
permanent study file at the site. If considered appropriate by [CONTACT_26702], ECGs may be 
analyzed retrospectively at a central laboratory.
ECG characteristics, including heart rate, QRS duration, and PR, and QT intervals, will 
be recorded on the eCRF. QTcB (Bazett ’s correction, see Appendix 9), QTcF 
(Fridericia’s correction, see Appendix 9) and RR will be calculated by [CONTACT_375462]7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
86/Protocol NP40435, Version 5recorded on the eCRF. Changes in T ‑wave and U ‑wave morphology and overall ECG 
interpretation will be documented on the eCRF. T -wave information w ill be captured as 
normal or abnormal, U -wave information will be captured in two categories: 
absent/normal or abnormal.
8.2.[ADDRESS_469756] be conducted in accordance with the separate 
laboratory manual and the SoA (Section 1.3).
The Investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any 
clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the CRF. The 
laboratory reports must be fi led with the source documents. Clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying 
disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_260059]'s condition.
In the eve nt of unexplained abnormal clinically significant laboratory test values , 
the tests should be repeated immediately and followed up until they have returned 
to the normal range and/or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found.
If such values do no t return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged 
reasonable by [CONTACT_737], the etiology should be identified and the Sponsor 
notified.
Iflaboratory values from non- protocol specified laboratory assessments performed 
at the local laboratory require a change in participant management or are 
considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_737] (e.g., SAE or AE or 
dose
-modification) then, the results must be recorded in the AE CRF.
Results of clinical laboratory testing will be recorded on th e eCRF or be received as 
electronically produced laboratory reports submitted directly from the local or central 
laboratory.
Additional blood or urine samples may be taken at the discretion of the I nvestigator if the 
results of any test fall outside the re ference ranges, or clinical symptoms necessitate 
additional testing to monitor participant safety.
Where the clinical significance of abnormal lab results is considered uncertain, screening 
lab tests may be repeated before random ization to confirm eligibil ity.
Based on continuous analysis of the data in this study and other studies, any sample 
type not considered to be critical for safety may be stopped at any time if the data from 
the samples collected does not produce useful information.

87/Protocol NP40435, Version 58.2.7 Medical History  and Demographic Data
Medical history includes clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer history 
(including prior cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26649]), reproductive status, smoking history, 
use of alcohol and drugs of abuse} and all medications (e.g., p rescription drugs, OTC 
drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by [CONTACT_88688] 30 days prior to the screening visit. 
Demographic data will include age, sex, and self ‑reported race/ethnicity. Data on race 
and ethnicit y will be used to explore associations between base -line demographic data 
and risk of adverse events.
8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS A ND S ERIOUS A DVERSE EVENT S
The definitions of an AE or serious adverse event (SAE) can be found in Appendix 2.
The non -serious adverse events of special interest and disease- related events and/or 
disease- related outcomes not qualifying as AEs or SAEs are discussed in Sections 8.3.6
and8.3.7 .
The Investigator and any q ualified designees are responsible for ensuring that all 
adverse events (including assessment of seriousness, severity and causality; see
Appendix 2) arerecorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in 
accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Appendix 2.
Procedures used for recording adverse events are provided in Appendix 3.
8.3.1 Time Period and Frequency  for Collecting A dverse Event and
Serious A dverse Event Information
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 2.
Investigators will seek information on adverse events at each participant’s contact. All 
adverse events, whether reported by [CONTACT_260060], will be 
recorded in the participant’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF as follows :
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study treatment , 
only serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention should be 
reported (e.g., serious adverse events related to invasive procedures such as biopsies).
Any other adverse event should not be reported.
After initiation of study treatment , all adverse events, regardless of relationship to 
study treatment , will be reported until the las t follow -upvisit60 days (Part A) and 
90days (Part B) after last dose . DLTs will be reported during the DLT assessment 
window.

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
88/Protocol NP40435, Version 5Post -study  adverse events and serious adverse events: The I nvestigator is not 
required to actively monitor participant s for adverse events after the end of the adverse 
event r eporting period –that is, after the last follow -up visit. 
However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE (including a death ) or other adverse 
events of concern that are believed to be related to prior treatment with study treatment , 
at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and the Investigator
considers the event to be reasonably related to the st udy treatment or study 
participation, the Investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor .For the procedure of 
reporting, seeAppendix 2.
8.3.2 Method of Detecting A dverse Events and Serious A dverse 
Events
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended 
and non- leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire 
about AE occurrence.
A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting 
adverse even t information at all participant evaluation time -points.
8.3.3 Follow -Up of A dverse Events and Serious A dverse Ev ents
[IP_ADDRESS] Investigator Follow -Up
The Investigator should follow each adverse event until the event has resolved to 
baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by [CONTACT_737], the event is 
otherwise explained , the pa rticipan t is lost to follow -up(Section 7.3),or the pa rticipan t 
withdraws consent. Every effort should be made to follow all serious adverse events 
considered to be related to study treatment or trial -related procedures until a final 
outcome can be reported.
During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates ) should be documented 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the pa rticipan t’s medical record to facilitate source 
data verification. If, after follow -up, return to baseline status or stabilization cannot be 
established, an explanation should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.
All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome 
and reported according to the instructions provided in Section 8.3.5 .
[IP_ADDRESS] Sponsor Follow -Up
For serious adverse events , non -serious adverse events of special interest, and 
pregnancies, the Sponsor or a designe e may follow up by [CONTACT_756], fax, electronic mail, 
and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome information 
(e.g., from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84155] e summaries, consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to 
perform an independent medical assessment of the reported case.

89/Protocol NP40435, Version 58.3.4 Regulatory  Reporting Requirements for Serious A dverse 
Events
Prompt notification by [CONTACT_95876] S ponsor of a SAE is es sential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety 
of a study treatment under clini cal investigation are met.
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatment under clinical 
investigation. The Sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards 
(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC), and investigators.
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) according to loc al regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and 
forwarded to investigators as necessary.
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other 
specific safety information (e .g., summar y or listing of SAEs) from the S ponsor will 
review and then ,file it along with the Investigator’s Br ochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, 
if appropriate according to local requirements .
For immediate and expedited reporting requirements from Investigator to Sponsor and 
from Sponsor to Health Authority, investigators, IRB and EC, see Appendix 2.
[IP_ADDRESS] Emergency  Medical Contacts
To ensure the safety of study participant s, access to the Medical monitors is available 
24hours a day [ADDRESS_469757] generated by [CONTACT_289417].
8.3.5 Pregnanc y
Female participant s of childbearing potential will be instru cted to immediately inform the 
Investigator if they become pregnant during the study or within 4 months after the final 
dose of RO7121661. 
Male participants will be instructed through the Informed Consent Form to immediately 
inform the Investigator if their partner becomes pregnant during the study or within 
4months after the final dose of RO7121661.
If a pregnancy is reported, the Investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
learning of the pregnancy and should follow the pregnancy reporting process as detailed 
inAppendix 5.
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs (Appendix 5).

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd

event; see Appendix 2for reporting instructions).
Non-serious adverse events of special interest for this study include the following:
Cases of an elevated ALT or AST in combination with either an elevated bilirubin or 
clinical jaundice, as defined in Appendix 3.
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_104841], as defined 
below:
Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is
considered an infectious agent. A transmission of an infectious agent may be 
suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an 
infection in a participant exposed to a medicinal product. This term applies only
when a contamination of the study treatment is suspected.

Qualify ing as A Es or SA Es
No disease- related events have b een identified for this study.
8.3.8 Management of RO7121661 Specific A dverse Ev ents
Based on the MoA , PD-1/TIM -3 is expected to show a safety profile that is similar to 
other CPIs. Toxicities from CPIs can be divided into infusion reactions and immune-
mediated adverse events (i mAEs). Toxicities associated or possibly associated with 
RO7121661 treatment should be managed according to standard medical practice. 
Additional tests, such as autoimmune serology or biopsies, should be used to determine 
a possible immunogenic etiology.
Measures will be taken to ensure the safety of participant s participating in t his study, 
including the use of stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria and close monitoring of 
participant s during the study. Administration of RO7121661 will be performed in a 
monitored setting in which there is immediate access to trained personnel a nd adequate 
equipment and medicine to manage potentially serious reactions. 
For events in which management guidelines are not covered in this protocol, participants 
should be managed as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_375463]. Clinical judgment may be applied and 
risk/benefit consideration may suggest deviating from these guidelines. In this specific 
case, decisions on study treatments will be taken by [CONTACT_375464] e Medical Monitor.

bSupportive treatment: Patients should be treated with acetaminophen/paracetamol and an antihistamine, 
such as diphenhydramine, if they have not been administered in the last 4 hours.  Intravenous fluids (e.g., 
normal saline) may be administered as clinica lly indicated.  For bronchospasm, urticaria, or dyspnea, 
antihistamines, oxygen, corticosteroids (e.g., 100 mg IV prednisolone or equivalent), and/or 
bronchodilators may be administered per institutional practice.
cSubsequent infusions may be started at t he original rate in consultation with the Medical Monitor.
[IP_ADDRESS] Immune -mediated adverse events
Most immune -mediated adverse events (imAEs) observed with immunomodulatory 
agents have been mild and self -limiting, however such events should be recognized 
early and treated promptly to avoid potential major complications. Any organ or tissue 
can be involved, although some imAEs occur much more commonly than others. The 
most frequently occurring imAEs affect skin, colon, endocrine organs, liver, and lungs. 
Others are very infrequent, but may be very serious, even lethal, such as neurological 
disorders and myocarditis.
Discontinuation of RO7121661 may not have an immediate therapeutic effect, and in 
severe cases, immune -mediated toxicities may require acute management with topi[INVESTIGATOR_030], systemic corticosteroids, mycophenolate, or TNF -α inhibitors. 
RO7121661 therapy may be suspended for most Grade 2 toxicities, with consideration 
of resuming when symptoms revert to Grade 1 or less. Corticosteroids may be 
administered. Grade 3 toxicities generally warrant suspension of RO7121661 and the
initiation of high- dose corticosteroids (prednisone, 1 -2 mg/kg/day, or 
methylprednisolone, 1 -2 mg/kg/day). Corticosteroids should be tapered over the course 
of at least [ADDRESS_469762] medical effects (see 
Appendix 2for further details) .
Decisions regarding dose -interruptions or modifications will be made by [CONTACT_3786]/treating Physician in consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the 
clinical evaluation of the participant.
In the event of an overdose, the Investigator should:
Contact [CONTACT_1034]’s Medical Monitor immediately.

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
94/Protocol NP40435, Version 5Closely monitor the participant for AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities until 
resolved.
Obtain a blood sample for PK analysis within [ADDRESS_469763] dose 
of study treatment, if advised by [CONTACT_1689] ( determined on a case -by-
case basis).
Document the quantity of the excess dose, as well as the duration of the overdose, 
in the CRF.
For this study, any dose of RO7121661 greater than 150% of the recommended dose 
level will be considered an overdose.
The S ponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose. 
8.5 PHA RMA COKINETICS
Mandatory blood samples to evaluate concentrations of study treatment will be collected 
from an IV line from the arm opposite to that used for study treatment administration. 
The date and time of each sample collection will be recorded in the eCRF. RO7121661 
concentrations will be analyzed by [CONTACT_2329] a validated assay. The PK samples will be 
taken as outlined in the SoA (see Section 1.3). During the course of the study, PK 
sampling time -points may be modified on the basis of emerging data to ensure the PK of 
RO7121661 can be adequately characterized (but without increasing ove rall blood 
collection volume for PK). This will be documented in a Note to File and a new SOA will 
be provided. Additional PK samples will be taken at the time of treatment 
discontinuation, if the participant experiences an infusion -related AE (such as an IRR), 
or if the participant experiences an AE leading to dose -reduction or delay of RO7121661 
administration (see Section 6.6).
Remaining volumes of PK samples may also be used for additional PK/ADA analysis or 
assay development or validation, for RO7121661 -related exploratory analyses, or to help 
develop further blood tests for exploratory analysis (e.g., further characterization of 
immune responses) ,after they are used for the mentioned intended use and as deemed 
appropriate. 
The PK samples will be destroyed within 2 years after the date of final Clinical Study 
Report (CSR). Details on sampling procedures, sample storage, and sh ipment are given 
in the Study Flow Chart and Laboratory Manual.
8.5.1 Immunogenicity  Assessments
Although RO7121661 is a human antibody, there is a risk that anti -drug antibody (ADA) 
against RO7121661 could develop, potentially reducing its efficacy and/or poten tially 
resulting in symptomatic hypersensitivity reaction, in particular immune -complex 
reactions.

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
95/Protocol NP40435, Version 5Antibodies to RO7121661 will be evaluated in blood samples collected from all 
participants according to the SoA ( Section 1.3). Additional ADA samples should also be 
collected at the time of treatment discontinuation or at the safety follow -up visit and in 
participants who experience a Grad e2IRR and in participants with clinical signs of 
hypersensitivity reaction, in particular immune -complex reaction. In each case, for each 
collected ADA sample, a corresponding PK sample will be collected at the same 
time-point for the determination of the RO7121661 concentration.
Validated screening, confirmatory, and titer assays will be employed to detect ADAs 
against RO7121661.The date and time of each sample will be recorded in the eCRF. If 
required, ADA positive samples wi ll be further characterized in an exploratory assay.
If required, remaining ADA samples may also be used for additional exploratory 
analyses (e.g., further characterization of immune responses) and/or PK/ADA assay 
development/validation experiments after t he mentioned intended uses, as deemed 
appropriate.
The blood samples will be destroyed within 2years after the date of final CSR. 
Details on sampling procedures, sample storage and shipment are documented in the 
Sample Handling Manual.
8.6 PHA RMA CODYNA MICS/EXPLORA TORY BIOMA RKER S
Blood and tissue samples will be collected as specified in the SoA ( Section 1.3). The 
date and time of each sam ple collection should be recorded in the eCRF. Details on 
processes for collection and shipment of these samples can be found in the Laboratory 
Flow Chart .
These samples will be tested for protein, nucleic acid, or other tissue or blood derived 
biomarkers relating to the proposed mechanism of action of RO7121661. These include, 
but are not limited to, drug RO, cellular profile and activation status of immune cells in 
blood and tumor, cytokines and other soluble markers of inflammation.  Analysis 
techniques may include, but are not limited to, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, 
gene expression, and gene sequencing. DNA and/or RNA will be extracted for
exploratory research on genetic biomarkers (including, but not limited to, cancer -related 
genes and biomar kers associated with common molecular pathways, or immune -
mediated markers, microsatellite instability (MSI) and tumor mutation alburden), and to 
enable genomic analysis for exploratory research on genetic biomarkers.
The specimens will also be used for re search purposes to identify biomarkers useful for 
predicting and monitoring response to RO7121661 treatment, identifying biomarkers 
useful for predicting and monitoring RO7121661 safety, assessing PD effects of 
RO7121661 treatment, and investigating mechanism of therapy resistance. This may 
include retrospective and longitudinal testing of bacterial or viral infection (including but 

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
96/Protocol NP40435, Version 5not limited to SARS -CoV- 2) by [CONTACT_142091]. These analyses may inform any 
association of bacterial or viral infection and response to treatment.
Additional markers may be measured in case a strong scientific rationale for these
analyses develop s.Any remaining samples after the specified analyses may also be 
used for additional (assay) validation experiments. Samples may b e used for research to 
develop methods, assays, prognostics and/or companion diagnostics related to
RO7121661, disease process, pathways associated with disease state, and/or 
mechanism o f action of the study treatment .Note that as science and research is 
evolving, the list of biomarkers that will be evaluated cannot be fully defined.
Based on continuous analysis of data any sample type, time point, and/ or analysis not 
considered to be critical for safety may be stopped at any time if the data does not 
support a strong scientific justification to continue. During the course of the study, 
sampling time -points may be modified on the basis of emerging data to ensure the PD of 
RO7121661 can be adequately characterized (but without increasing overall blood 
collection volume). This will be documented in a Note to File and a new SOA will be 
provided. 
Archival tumor blocks will be returned , unless notified by [CONTACT_375466]. Blood, tissue and o ther residual material (slides, extracts, on -study blocks, etc.) 
will be destroyed within 2 years after the final closure of the clinical database unless the
participant gives specific consent for the remainder of the material to be stored for 
optional exploratory research (R BR).
When a participant withdraws from the study, samples collected prior to t he date of 
withdrawal may still be analyzed, unless the participant specifically requests that the 
samples be destroyed or local laws require destruction of the samples.  However, if 
samples have been tested prior to withdrawal, results from those tests wi ll remain as 
part of the overall research data.
Data arising from all biosamples including samples for analyses of inherited DNA will be 
subject to the confidentiality standards described in Appendix 1Section 1.4.
8.6.1 Blood Samples
The following samples for PDand biomarker research are required and will be collected 
from all participants in this study :
Blood samples will be collected for measurement of ROduring dose escalation.
Blood sample swill be collected for measurement of cytokines/chemokines ( e.g., 
IL-2, IL- 6, IL- 8, and IFN )and immune activation markers such as sCD25
Blood sample swill be collected for measurement of soluble target (PD -1, TIM -3)
Blood samples will be collected for the measurement of IgE/Tryptase

on Cycle 1 Day 1, it should be collected at the next scheduled visit, where possible 
The following additional samples for PDand biomarker research are required and will be 
collected from Part B participants only
Blood samples will be collected for flow cytometry. The samples will be analyzed 
for changes in the numbers and activation status of lymphocyte subsets including 
but not limited to CD4+, CD8+, and/ or NK cells
Blood for RNA extraction wil l be collected for gene expression analysis
Blood for bTMB
Blood for ctDNA
8.6.2 Tissue Samples
[IP_ADDRESS] Archival Tumor Samples
FFPE archival tumor tissue is to be obtained from all participants, if available. T he 
primary and the most recent metastasis (if both are avai lable) should be submitted for 
analysis . Ideally t hese samples should include the invasive margin.  Tumor blocks are 
preferred but slides will be accepted . Samples will be collected for IHC and 
immu nofluoresence analyses (such as, but not limited to, CD8/K i67, PD -1, TIM -3, PD -
L1). Samples may also be used for TMB or gene expression.
Archival tumor blocks will be returned to the sites when requested by [CONTACT_375467], unless notified by [CONTACT_375468] .
[IP_ADDRESS] Fresh Tumor Biopsies
Screening and on treatment fresh tumor biopsies may be required for additional 
participants (i.e., if dose cohort extended to confirm safety, PK and/or RO and/or the
biomarker profile) in Part A [ADDRESS_469764] tumor lesions from which biopsies can be safely obtained, as per 
clinical judgment of the treating physician.
The screening sample should be collected after eligibility is confirmed unless the fresh 
biopsy sample is needed to confirm patient eligibility (e.g. to confirm PD -L1 expression 
levels fo r Cohorts B2 and B3). Post dose samples can be collected 2/1day from 
scheduled time -point. If the pa rticipant progresses and discontinues treatment prior to on 
treatment biopsy day, the tumor biopsy should be taken at the time of treatment 
discontinuation. An additional biopsy at the time of partial response, stable disease, 
progression or at any other time- point of interest based on participants’ course of 
disease may be taken after discussion between the Investigator and the Sponsor.

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
98/Protocol NP40435, Version 5Use of a vailab le existing biopsies at the sites prior to the participant ’s entry in the study 
should be discussed with the Sponsor (i.e., biopsy should have recently been obtained 
as part of diagnosis biopsy and participant s should have not received any tumor 
treatment after this collection).
Collection of tumor biopsies should be guided by [CONTACT_2207], CT scan, or other methods 
according to the location of the selected lesion using a 16 -gauge needle (preferred) to 
provide cores, ideally, of at least 20 mm in length or eq uivalent size.  Ideally 4 (minimum 
2) core biopsies will be obtained at each time-point (at the physician’s discretion).  Fine -
needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_123453]. The biopsies will be taken from accessible tumor 
locations, including, but not limited to, s kin, lymph node, rectum, liver etc. Bone biopsies 
and trans -bronchial biopsies are not acceptable. 
If feasible, on -treatment biopsies may be repeated if the initial biopsy did not contain 
sufficient tumor material for analysis. The location of each biopsy will be documented in 
relation to each tumor lesion as determined by [CONTACT_9661]. The baseline and on- treatment 
biopsies should be preferably taken from the same tumor lesion (metastasis) to ensure 
comparability. If the sample cannot be collected from the sam e lesion (e.g., lesion 
disappears after treatment) then preferably the biopsy should be collected from the 
same organ, if possible. 
Additional participants may be enrolled in Part B in the event that paired fresh baseline 
and on -treatment biopsies are not evaluable for the key biomarker analyses to ensure 
that at least 60% of paired fresh biopsy samples are evaluable to conclude the PD
analysis. 
In the event that a fresh biopsy is taken during the screening period and the participant 
is not enrolled into the study, the fixed and embedded biopsy (FFPE block) can be 
returned to the site upon site request. The site must confirm that a wri tten consent is 
obtained from the participant before return request submission to [COMPANY_002]. If the 
participant does enroll in the study, fresh biopsies will not be returned to the site. 
Biopsies will be used for IHC ( e.g.,CD8/Ki67, PD -1, TIM -3, PD-L1), TMB and gene 
expression. 
8.7 GENETICS
8.7.1 Whole Genome/Exome/Targeted DNA  Analysis
At participating sites, blood samples will be collected for DNA extraction to enable whole 
genome sequencing (WGS) to identify mutations that are predictive of response to study 
drug, are associated with progression to a more severe disease state, are asso ciated 
with acquired resistance to study drug, are associated with susceptibility to developi[INVESTIGATOR_178709], can lead to improved adverse event monitoring or investigation, or can 
increase the knowledge and understanding of disease biology and drug safe ty.  The 
DNA may also be used to determine if alleles at genes associated with immunity, such 
RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
99/Protocol NP40435, Version 5as KIR and HLA alleles, affect the PK/PD/efficacy/safety of the treatment. Research may 
distinguish germline mutations from somatic mutations.  The samples may be sent to 
one or more laboratories for analysis.
Collection and submission of W GS samples is contingent upon the review and approval 
of the exploratory research by [CONTACT_25733]'s Institutional Review Board or Ethics 
Committee (IRB/EC) and, if applicable, an ap propriate regulatory body.  If a site has not 
been granted approval for W GS sampling, this section of the protocol will not be 
applicable at that site.
Genomics is increasingly informing researcher's understanding of disease pathobiology.  
WGS provides a c omprehensive characterization of the genome and, along with clinical 
data collected in this study, may increase the opportunity for developi[INVESTIGATOR_375415] a drug or develop adverse events.  Data will be 
analyzed in the context of this study but will also be explored in aggregate with data from 
other studies.  The availability of a larger dataset will assist in identification and 
characterization of important biomarkers and pathways to support future drug 
development.
Blood samples collected for W GS are to be stored until they are no longer needed or 
until they are exhausted.  However, the storage period will be in accordance with th e 
IRB/EC approved Informed Consent Form and applicable laws (e.g., health authority 
requirements).
Participant medical information associated with W GS samples is confidential and may 
be disclosed to third parties only as permitted by [CONTACT_375469] F orm (or 
separate authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by 
[CONTACT_2299], unless permitted or required by [CONTACT_2371].
Given the complexity and exploratory nature of the W GS analyses, data derived from 
these analyses will gen erally not be provided to study investigators or participants unless 
required by [CONTACT_2371].  The aggregate results of any conducted research will be available in 
accordance with the effective Sponsor policy on study data publication.

9.4 STATISTICA LANAL YSES
9.4.1 Demogr aphics and Baseline Characteristics
Demography and baseline characteristics (including age, sex, participant disposition, 
previous therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and medical history) will be analyzed using descriptive statistics. The 
analysis will be based on the safety analy sis population. Data will be summarized by

Objective response rate (ORR) 
Disease control rate (DCR)
Duration of response (DoR)
Progression -free survival (PFS) No formal statistical model and no formal 
hypothesis testing are planned in this stu dy. 
Tumor response data will be reported using 
descriptive statistics. Response data will be listed. 
ORR and DCR will be summarized by [CONTACT_375475] 90% confidence interval 
(CI). If data are sufficient, duration of response 
and PFS will be summarized by [CONTACT_375476]-to-event analy ses and Kaplan -Meier curves. 
The above analyses will be carried out for 
RECIST Version 1.1 (primary analy sis)and 
iRECIST (exploratory analysis).
Overall Survival (OS) OS data may be tabulated and summarized using 
time-to-event analy ses and Kaplan -Meier curves if 
data is collected and mature.
Eventually, summaries will be carried out by 
[CONTACT_375477]. 
Objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) are determined as the 
rate of part icipants with an objective tumor response of CR or partial response (PR) 
(ORR) or CR, PR or stable disease [SD] (DCR). For this protocol, confirmation of 
response is required at least [ADDRESS_469773] to be classified as stable (according to 
RECIST Version 1.1) at least once at a minimum of [ADDRESS_469774] Version 1.1 and will be 
based on Investigators’ asse ssment. Participants with missing or no response 
assessments will be classified as not evaluable unless there is documented clinical 
deterioration, in which case participant will be classified as non -responders. 
DoR will be calculated for participants who have a best (confirmed) overall response of 
CR or PR and will be defined as the time from first occurrence of a documented 
response until the time of documented disease progression or death (death within [ADDRESS_469775] study treatment) from any cause, whichever occurs first. Censoring 
methods will be the same as the one applied for progression -free survival (PFS).
PFS will be defined as the time from study treatment initiation (Cycle 1 Day 1) to the first 
occurrence of documented disease progression (ba sed on RECIST Version 1.1 
Investigator’s assessment) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. For 

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
106/Protocol NP40435, Version 5participants who do not have documented progressive disease or death during the 
study, PFS will be censored at the day of the last tumor assessment.
Sensitivity analyses of response endpoints (ORR, DRC, DoR, and PFS) may include the 
evaluation of response according to iRECIST. 
OS is defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to the time of death from 
any cause. Participants who are stil l alive at the time of analysis will be censored at the 
time of their last study assessment (for active participants) or at the last date known alive 
(for participants in follow -up).
9.4.3 Safety  Analyses
Unless otherwise specified all safety analyses listed in Table 9 will be based on the 
safety population. All safety parameters will be analyzed using descriptive statistics, 
summarized and presented in tables. Data will be summarized by [CONTACT_375478] (if 
applicable) within each part. 
Safety will be assessed through summaries of DLTs (for Part A) , adverse events, 
changes in laboratory test results, changes in vital signs and ECGs, and exposure to 
study treatment.

baseline incidence during both the treatment and follow -up periods) will be summarized.
Participants are considered to be ADA positive if they are ADA negative at baseline 
but develop an ADA response following study drug administration 
(treatment -induced ADA response), or if they are ADA positive at baseline and the 
titer of one or more post -baseline samples is greater than the titer of the baseline 
sample by a scientifically reasonable margin such as at least 4 -fold 
(treatment -enhanced ADA response).
Participants are considered to be ADA negative if they are ADA negative at baseline 
and all post -baseline samples are negative, or if they are ADA positiv e at baseline 
but do not have any post -baseline samples with a titer that is greater than the titer of 
the baseline sample by a scientifically reasonable margin such as at least 4 -fold 
(treatment unaffected).
The relationship between ADA status and safety, efficacy, PK, and biomarker endpoints 
will be analyzed and reported descriptively via subgroup analyses.

responsible for promptly informing the IRB/EC of any protocol amendments 
(Section 2.3.1 of this Appendix ).
The Investigator should follow the requirements for reporting all adverse events to the 
Sponsor. Investig ators may receive written IND safety reports or other safety ‑related 
communications from the Sponsor. Investigators are responsible for ensuring that such 
reports are reviewed and processed in accordance with Health Authority requirements 
and the policies and procedures established by [CONTACT_11577]/EC, and archived in the site’s 
study file.
1.3. INFORMED CONSENT
The Sponsor’s Master Informed Consent Form (and ancillary sample ICFs such as a 
Child’s Assent or Caregi ver's Informed Consent Form, if applicable) will be provided to 
each site. If applicable, it will be provided in a certified translation of the local language. 
Participants must be informed that their participation is voluntary. Participants or their 
legally authorized representative will be required to sign a statement of informed consent 
that meets the requirements of [ADDRESS_469783] ( HIPAA
)requirements , where applicable , 

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
116/Protocol NP40435, Version 5and the IRB/IEC or study center. The Sponsor or its designee must review and approve 
any proposed deviations from the Sponsor's sample ICFs or any alternate consent forms 
proposed by [CONTACT_779] (collectively, the “Consent Forms”) before IRB/EC submission. The 
final IRB/EC ‑approved Consent Forms must be provided to the Sponsor for Health 
Authority submission purposes according to local requirements. Participants must be re-
consented to the most current version of the ICF(s) during their participation in the study. 
A copy of the ICF(s) signed by [CONTACT_260067]’s legally authorized representative.
The Consent Forms must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_98901]’s 
legally authorized representative before his or her participation in the study. The case 
history or clinical records for each participant shall document the informed consent 
process and that written informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the 
study.
The Consent Forms should be revised whenever there are c hanges to study procedures 
or when new information becomes available that may affect the willingness of the 
participant to take part. The final revised IRB/EC -approved Consent Forms must be 
provided to the Sponsor for Health Authority submission purposes i f required as per local 
regulations.
Participants must be re -consented to the most current version of the Consent Forms (or 
to a significant new information/findings addendum in accordance with applicable laws 
and IRB/EC policy) during their participation in the study. For any updated or revised 
Consent Forms, the case history or clinical records for each participant shall document 
the informed consent process and that written informed consent was obtained using the 
updated/revised Consent Forms for continu ed participation in the study.
A copy of each signed Consent Form must be provided to the participant or the 
participant’s legally authorized representative. All signed and dated Consent Forms must 
remain in each participant’s study file or in the site fil e and must be available for 
verification by [CONTACT_9534].
Participants who are re-screened
are required to sign a new ICF.
The ICF will contain a separate section that addresses the use of remaining mandatory 
samples for optional exploratory research. A separate signature [CONTACT_33509] a participant's agreement to allow any remaining specimens to be used for 
exploratory research.
Consent to Participate in the Research Biosample Repository
The Informed Consent Form will contain a separate section that addresses participation 
in the RBR. The investigator or authorized designee will explain to each participant the 
objectives, methods, and potential hazards of participation in the RBR. Participant s will 
RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
117/Protocol NP40435, Version 5be told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their specimens at 
any time and for any reason during the storage period. A separate, specific signature [CONTACT_375512] a participant’s agreement to provide optional RBR specimens . 
Participants who decline to participate will n ot provide a separate signature .
The I nvestigator should document whether or not the participant has given consent to 
participate by [CONTACT_375490].
In the event of deat h or loss of competence of a subject who is participating in the 
Research , the participant's specimens and data will continue to be u sed as part of the 
RBR.
For sites in the [LOCATION_002], each Consent Form may also include patient authorization
to allow u se and disclosure of personal health information in compliance with the U.S. 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). If the site utilizes a 
separate Authorization Form for patient authorization for use and disclosure of persona l 
health information under the HIPAA regulat ions, the review, approval, and other 
processes outlined above apply except that IRB review and approval may not be 
required per study site policies.
Approval by [CONTACT_375491]'s Institutional 
Review Board or Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) and, if applicable, an appropriate 
regulato ry body. If a site has not been granted approval for RBR sampling, this section 
of the protocol will not be applicable at that site
Withdrawal from the Research Biosample Repository
Participants who give consent to provide specimens for the RBR have the ri ght to 
withdraw their specimens at any time for any reason. If a participant wishes to withdraw 
consent to the testing of his or her specimens, the I nvestigator must inform the Medical 
Monitor in writing of the participant’s wishes using the RBR W ithdrawal Form and, if the 
trial is ongoing, must enter the date of withdrawal on the RBR Withdrawal of Informed 
Consent eCRF. The participant will be provided with instructions on how to withdraw 
consent after the trial is closed. A participant 's withdrawal from S tudy NP40435 does not, 
by [CONTACT_5071], constitute withdrawal of specimens from the RBR. Likewise, a participant’s 
withdrawal from the RBR does not constitute withdrawal from Study NP40435 .Data 
already generated before time of withdrawal of consent to RBR will still be used.
1.4. CONFIDENTIA LITY
Participants will be assigned a unique identifier by [CONTACT_1034]. Any participant records 
or datasets that are transferred to the Sponsor will contain the identifier only; participant 
names or any information which would make the participant identifiable will not be 
transferred.

[CONTACT_21411] a ccordance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure must 
also be explained to the participant. 
Medical information may be given to a participant’s personal physician or other 
appropriate medical personnel responsible for the participant’s welfare, for treatment 
purposes.
The participant must be informed that his/her medical records may be examined by 
[CONTACT_78582], by [CONTACT_6667]/IEC members, and by [CONTACT_375492].
Confidentiality for Research Biosample Repository
Data generated from RBR specimens must be available for inspection upon request by 
[CONTACT_375493] A uthorities, and [COMPANY_002] monitors, 
representatives, and collaborators, as appr opriate .
Participant medical information associated with RBR specimens is confidential and may 
only be disclosed to third parties as permitted b y the Informed Consent Form (or 
separate authorization for use and disclosure of person
al health information) signed by 
[CONTACT_2299] , unle ss permitted or required by [CONTACT_2371] .
Data derived from RBR specimen analysis on individu alparticipants will generally not be 
provided to study investigators unless a request for research use is granted. Th e 
aggregate results of any conducted research will be available in accordance with the 
effective [COMPANY_002] p olicy on study data publication .
Genetic research data and associated clinical data may be shared with researchers who 
are not participating in the study or submitted to government or other health research 
databases for broad sharing with other researchers. Participants will not be identified by 
[CONTACT_375494]. Given the complexity and 
exploratory nature of these anal yses, genetic data and analyses will not be shared with 
investigators or participants unless required by [CONTACT_2371].
Any inventions and resulting patents, improvements, and/or know -how originating from 
the use of the RBR specimen data will become and remain the exclusive and 
unburdened property of [COMPANY_002] , except where agreed otherwise .
Monitoring and Oversight Research Biosample Repository
Specimens collected for the RBR will be tracked in a manner consistent with Good 
Clinical Practice by a quality -controlled, au ditable, and appropriately validated laboratory 
information management system, to ensure compliance with data confidentiality as well 
as adherence to authorized use of specimens as specified in this protocol and in the 
Informed Consent Form. [COMPANY_002] monitors and auditors will have direct access to 
RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
119/Protocol NP40435, Version 5appropriate parts of records relating to participant participation in RBR for the purposes 
of verifying the data provided to [COMPANY_002]. The site will permit monitori ng, audits, IRB/EC 
review, and Health A uthority inspec tions by [CONTACT_375495] .
1.5. FINA NCIA L DISCLOSURE
Investigators will provide the Sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial information in 
accordance with local regulations to allow the Sponsor to submit complete and accurate 
financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate Health A uthorities. 
Investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the 
course of the study and for one year after completion of the study (i.e., LPLV).
2. DATA HANDLING A ND RECORD
2.1. DATA COLLECTION AND MA NAGEMENT RESP ONSIBILITIES
2.1.1. Data Quality  Assurance
All participant data relating to the study will be recorded on printed or electronic CRF 
unless transmitted to the Sponsor or designee electronically (e.g., laboratory data). The 
Investigator is responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by 
[CONTACT_1189].
The Investigator must maintain accurate documentati on (source data) that supports the 
information entered in the CRF.
The Investigator must permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and 
regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents.
The Sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study including 
quality checking of the data.
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered 
into the CRF by [CONTACT_1191], complete, and ver ifiable from 
source documents; that the safety and rights of participants are being protected; and that 
the study is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any 
other study agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory r equirements.
2.1.3. Source Data Records
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which participant data are recorded 
and documented for the first time. They include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], 
clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, COAs (paper or eCOA) , 
evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated 
instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_26671], microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X-rays, 
RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
120/Protocol NP40435, Version 5patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico‑technical 
departments involved in a clinical trial.
Before study initiation, data to be entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or 
electronic record of the data) and considered source data must be defined in the Trial 
Monitoring Plan.
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per 
the policy for retention of records described below.
To facilitate source data verification, the I nvestigators and institutions must provide the 
Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial ‑related 
monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC re view. The investigational site must also allow 
inspection by [CONTACT_260069] A uthorities.
2.1.4. Use of Computerized Sy stems
When clinical observations are entered directly into an investigational site’s 
computerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the 
electronic record can serve as the source document if the system has been validated i n 
accordance with Health A uthority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used 
in clinical research. An acceptable computerized data collection system allows 
preservation of the original entry of data. If original data are modified, the system should 
maintain a viewable audit trail that shows the original data as well as the reason for the 
change, name [CONTACT_25773], and date of the change .
2.2. RETENTION OF RECORDS
Records and documents, including signed ICF , pertaining to the conduct of this study 
must be retained by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator for at least [ADDRESS_469784] of 
the study to be fully reconstructed , including but not limited to the protocol, protocol 
amendments, ICFs , and documentation of IRB/EC and governmental approval. 
[COMPANY_002] shall also submit an Annual Safety Report once a year to the IEC and CAs 
according to local regulatory requirements and timelines of each country participating in 
the study.

required) before implementation of any changes, except for changes necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to patients or any non -substantial changes, as defined by 
[CONTACT_66363].
2.3.2. Publicati on Policy
The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings. If this is 
foreseen, the Investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the Sponsor 
for approval prior to submission. This allows the Sponsor to protec t proprietary 
information and to provide comments based on information from other studies that may 
not yet be available to the Investigator.
The Sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of study results. In 
accordance with standard editori al and ethical practice, the Sponsor will generally 
support publication of multicenter trials only in their entirety and not as individual center 
data. In this case, a coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_12992].
Any formal publication of the study in which contribution of Sponsor personnel exceeded 
that of conventional monitoring will be considered as a joint publication by [CONTACT_375496].
Authorship will be determined by [CONTACT_14346].

Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Evaluating, 
Follo w-up and Reporting
1. DEFINITION OF A DVERS E EVENTS
According to the E2A ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice, an adverse event is any 
untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.
An adverse event can therefore be:
Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding),
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product,
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
Events Meeting the A E Definition:
Any deterioration in a laboratory value (hematology, clinical chemistry, or
urinalysis) or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is associated with symptoms
or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant treatment or discontinuation
from study treatment (see Appendix 3, Section 4).
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition, including either an
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even
though it may have been present before the start of the study.
Adverse even ts that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including
those that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive
procedures such as biopsies).
Events NOT Meeting the A E Definition:
Any clinically significant abnormal la boratory findings or other abnormal safety
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by
[CONTACT_78782]’s condition.
The disease/disorder being studied or expected progr ession, signs, or symptoms of
the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the
participant’s condition.
Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that
leads to the procedure is an AE.
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s)
present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
124/Protocol NP40435, Version 52. DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be a serious adverse event 
(SAE) even if serious conditions are met (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/symptoms of the 
disease under study, death due to progres sion of disease).
A serious adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any 
dose:
Results in death.
Is life -threatening.
The term "life -threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in 
which the participant was at r isk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer 
to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
(see Appendix 3).
In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19949] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1083]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the 
physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13270], the event is serious. W hen in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” 
occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not 
worsen from baseline is not considered an AE.
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
Disability means substantial disruption of the participant’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or 
prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial di sruption.
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect .
Other significant events :
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that 
may not be immediately l ife-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_330997]. These events should 
usually be considered serious.

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
125/Protocol NP40435, Version 5Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.
3. RECORDING OF A DVERSE EVENT A ND/OR SERIOU S 
ADVERSE EVENT
When an AE/SAE occurs, i t is the responsibility of the I nvestigator to review all
documentation (e .g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory reports, and diagnostics 
reports) related to the e vent.
The I nvestigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF.
It is notacceptable for the I nvestigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s medical 
records to Medical Monitor in lieu of completion of the eCRF.
There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_375418] . In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the 
participant number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_375419]/or Medical Monitor .
TheInvestigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. W henever possible, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be docu mented as the AE/SAE.
3.1. ASSESSMENT OF S EVERITY
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event (rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to a pre -defined 
grading criteria [e.g., National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE] criteria); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache without any further findings).
Severity and seriousness need to be independentl y assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF.
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by [CONTACT_144391] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event ).
The adverse event severity grading scale fo r the NCI CTCAE (v5.0) will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity. Table 1 will be used for assessing severity for 
adverse events that are not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE.

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
126/Protocol NP40435, Version 5Table 1 Adverse Event Severity Gr ading Scale

aInstrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_19640], using the telephone, managing money, etc.
bExamples of self -care activities of daily living include bathing, dressing and undressing, 
feeding one's self, using the toilet, and taking medications, as performed by [CONTACT_25744].
cIf an event is assessed as a "significant medical eve nt," it must be reported as a serious 
adverse event ( see Section 6of this Appendix for reporting instructions), per the definition of 
serious adverse event in Section 2.
dGrade [ADDRESS_469785] be reported a s serious adverse events (see Section 6for 
reporting instructions), per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 2.Grade 4 
laborator y abnormalities would only be reported as SAEs if these meet one or more of the 
conditions outlined in Section 2(Definition of Serious Adverse Events) of Appendix 2.
3.2. ASSESSMENT OF C A[LOCATION_003]LITY
Investigators should use their knowledge of the participant, the circumstances 
surrounding the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to 
determine whether or not an adverse event is considered to be related to the study 
treatment, indicating "yes" or "no" accordingly. The following guidance should be taken 
into consideration:
Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study treatment.
Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose -reduction, 
discontinuation of study treatment, or reintroduction of study treatment.
Known association of the event with the study treatment or with similar treatments.
Known association of the event with the disease under study.
Presence of risk factors in the participant or use of concomitant medications known 
to increase the occurrence of the event.
Presence of non -treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event.

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
127/Protocol NP40435, Version 5For participant receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol -mandated therapy.
4. FOLLOW -UP OF A ES A NDSAES
The I nvestigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_375497]/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. 
This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological 
examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.
If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up 
period, the Investigator will provide the Sponsor with a copy of any post -mortem findings 
including histopathology, if available.
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally com pleted eCRF.
The I nvestigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_469786] report 
such events to the Sponsor immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take 
place more than [ADDRESS_469787] report to the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning 
of the event, regardless of relationship to study treatment :
Serious adverse events
Non-serious adverse events of special interest (NSAE SI)
Pregnancies (see Section 8.3.5 )
DLTs during the DLT assessment window (defined in Section 4.1.3 ; see 
Appendix 2; Section 5.1for details on reporting requirements)
The I nvestigator must report new significant follow -up information for these events to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the 
information). New significant information includes the following:
New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis .
Significant new diagnostic test results .
Change in causality based on new information .
Change in the event’s outcome, including recovery .

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
128/Protocol NP40435, Version 5Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event .
Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting serio us adverse 
events to the local Health A uthority and IRB/EC.
5.[ADDRESS_469788] AND DOSE -LIMITING T OXICITIES
Events that Occur prior to Study  Treatment Initiation
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study treatment , only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention should be reported. 
The Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form provided 
to Investigators should be completed and submitted to the Serious Adverse Event 
Responsible immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event).
Events that Occur after Study  Treatment Initiation
For reports of serious adverse events and non -serious adverse events o f special interest 
(Section 8.3.6 ) that occu r after initiation of study treatment ( Section 8.3.1 ),investigators 
should record all case details that can be gathered immediately (i.e., within 24 hours 
after learning of the event) on the appropriate Adverse Event of Special Interest/ Serious 
Adverse Event eCRF form and submit the report via the electronic data capture (EDC)
system. A report will be generated and sent to the Sponsor’s Safety Risk Management 
department.
In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, the Serious Adverse Event/Adverse 
Event of Special Interest Reporting Form provided to investigators should be completed 
and submitted to the Serious Adverse Event Responsible immediately (i.e., no more 
than 24 hours after learning of the event).
Once the EDC system is available, all information will need to be entered and submitted 
via the EDC system.
Reporting o f Post -Study Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
After the end of the adverse event reporting period (see Section 8.3.1 )all deaths, 
regardless of cause, should be reported through use of the Long -Term Survival Follow -
Up eCRF. 
In addition, if the Investigator becomes aware of a SAE that is believed to be related to 
prior study treatment, the event should be reported directly to t he Sponsor or its 
designee, either by [CONTACT_375498].

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
129/Protocol NP40435, Version 55.2. REPORTING REQUIREMEN TS FOR CA SES OF A CCIDENTA L 
OVERDOSE OR MEDICA TION ERROR 
Accidental overdose and medication error (hereafter collectively referred to as "special 
situations"), are defined as follows:
Accidental overdose:  accidental administration of a drug in a quantity that is higher 
than the assigned dose
Medication error: accidental d eviation in the administration of a drug 
In some cases, a medication error may be intercepted prior to administration of 
the drug.
Special situations are not in themselves adverse events, but may result in adverse 
events.  Each adverse event associated w ith a special situation should be recorded 
separately on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills 
seriousness criteria, the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately 
(i.e., nomore than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Appendix 2, Section 5.1).  
For RO7121661, adverse events associated with special situations should be recorded 
as described below for each situation:
Accidental overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  Check the "Accidental 
overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.
Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event 
term.  Check the "Medication error" box.
Medication error that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  
Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.
In addition, all special situations associated with RO7121661, regardless of whether they 
result in an adverse event, should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF as described 
below:
Accidental overdose:  Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "accidental overdose" as the event 
term.  Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.
Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the name [CONTACT_26865] a description of the error (e.g., wrong dose administered, wrong 
dosing schedule, incorrect route of administration, wrong drug, expi[INVESTIGATOR_26669]) as the even t term.  Check the "Medication error" box.
Medication error that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] 
"accidental overdose" as the event term.  Check the "Accidental overdose" and 
"Medication error" boxes.  Enter a description of the error in the additional case 
details.
Intercepted medication error:  Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "intercepted medication 
error" as the event term.  Check the "Medication error" box.  Enter a description of 
the error in the additional case details.

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
130/Protocol NP40435, Version 5As an example, an a ccidental overdose that resulted in a headache would require the 
completion of two Adverse Event eCRF pages, one to report the accidental overdose 
and one to report the headache.  The "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" 
boxes would need to be chec ked on both eCRF pages.
6. EXPEDITED REPORTING TO HEA LTH AUTHORITIE S, 
INVESTIGA TORS, INSTI TUTIONA L REVIEW BOA RDS, A ND 
ETHICS COMMITTEES
The Sponsor will promptly evaluate all serious adverse events and NSAESI against 
cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new 
safety findings to investigators, IRBs, ECs, and applicable Health Authorities based on 
applicable legislation.
To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will 
assess the expectedness of these events using the following reference document:
RO7121661 Investigator's Brochure
The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event 
frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency repo rted in the 
applicable reference document.
Reporting requirements will also be based on the Investigator's assessment of causality 
and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by [CONTACT_25753].
RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
131/Protocol NP40435, Version 5Appendix [ADDRESS_469789] medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse 
events on the Adverse Event eCRF. Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on th e Adverse Event 
eCRF.
1. DIAGNOSIS VERSUS SIG NS A ND SYMPTOMS
1.1. INFUSION /INJECTION- RELA TED RE ACTI ONS
Adverse events that occur during or within 24 hours after study drug administration and 
are judged to be related to study treatment infusion should be captured as a diagnosis 
(e.g., "infusion -related reaction" ) on the Adverse Event eCRF. If possible, avoid 
ambiguous terms such as “systemic reaction”. Associated signs and symptoms should 
be recorded on the dedicated Infusion -Related Rea ction eCRF. If a participant 
experiences both a local and systemic reaction to the same dose of study drug, each 
reaction should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF, with signs and 
symptoms also recorded separately on the dedicated Infusion -Related Reaction eCRF.
1.2. OTHER A DVERSE EVENTS
For adverse events other than IRRs (see Section 1.1) , a diagnosis (if known) should be 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., 
record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated 
transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be 
medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each 
individual event should be recorded on th e Adverse Event eCRF. If a diagnosis is 
subsequently established, all previously reported adverse events based on signs and 
symptoms should be nullified and replaced by [CONTACT_335578], with a starting date that corre sponds to the starting date of the first 
symptom of the eventual diagnosis .
2. ADVERSE EVENTS OCCUR RING SECONDA RY TO OT HER
EVENTS
In general, adverse events occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or 
clinical sequelae) should be identifie d by [CONTACT_5252], with the exception of 
severe or serious secondary events. However, medically significant adverse events 
occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated in time should be recorded 
as independent events on the Adverse Event eCRF. For example:
If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy
adult, only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF.

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
132/Protocol NP40435, Version 5If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF .
If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should 
be reported separately on the eCRF.
If dizziness leads to a fall and subsequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.
All adverse events s hould be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to wh ether the events are associated.
3. PERSISTENT OR RECURR ENT ADVERSE EVENTS
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between 
participant evaluation time -points. Such events should only be recorded once on the 
Adverse Event eCRF . The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the 
severity should be updated to reflect the most extreme severity any time the event 
worsens. If the event becomes serious, the Adverse Event eCRF should be updated to 
reflect this.
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between participant evaluation 
time-points and subsequently recurs. Each recurrence of an adverse event should be 
recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF.
4. ABNORMA L LA BORA TORY VALUES
Not every laboratory abnormali ty qualifies as an adverse event. A laboratory test result 
should be reported as an adverse event if it meet s any of the following criteria:
Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659].
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation).
Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for 
hypokalemia) or a change in concomitant therapy.
Clinically significant in the Investigator’s judgment.
It is the I nvestigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings. Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an adverse event.
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disea se or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]
associated with cholecystitis), only the diagnosis (i.e., cholecystitis) should be rec orded 
on the Adverse Event eCRF.
RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
133/Protocol NP40435, Version 5If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a 
descriptor indicating if the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., "elevated 
potassium", as opposed to "abnormal potassium"). If the laboratory abnormality can be 
characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should 
be recorded as the adverse event. For exampl e, an elevat ed serum pot assium level of 
7.0mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia”.
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes. The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or 
seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens.
5. ABNORMA L VITA L SIGN VALUES
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A vital sign result should 
be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:
Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659].
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation).
Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy.
Clinically significant in the Investigator’s judgment.
It is the I nvestigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings. Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality 
should be classified as an adverse event.
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be rec orded on 
the Adverse Event eCRF .
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes. The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or 
seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens.
6. ABNORMA L LIVER FUNCT ION TESTS
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( 3ULN) in combination with either an elevated 
total bilirubin ( 2ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other 
causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury. 
RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
134/Protocol NP40435, Version 5Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the occurrence of either of the 
following:
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with total 
bilirubin 2ULN.
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with clinical jaundice .
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 8.3) and 
reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the 
event ), either as a serious adverse event or a non -serious adverse event o f special 
interest ( see Section 8.3.6 ).
7. DEA THS
For this protocol, mortality is an efficacy endpoint. Deaths that occur during the 
protocol -specified adverse event reporting period ( see Section 5of Appendix 2) that are
attributed by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator solely to tumor progression should be recorded only on the 
Death Attributed to Progressive Disease eCRF . All other on -study deaths, regardless of 
relationship to study treatment , must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and 
immediately repor ted to the Sponsor ( see Section 5of Appendix 2).
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event. The event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical 
concept on the Adverse Event eCRF. Generally, only one such event should be 
reported. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of 
reporting, “unexplained death” should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the 
cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), “unexplained de ath” should 
be replaced by [CONTACT_25749] .The term "sudden death" should not be 
used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., "sudden cardiac death").
8. PREEXISTING MEDICA L CONDITIONS
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study. 
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical Histo ry and Baseline 
Conditions eCRF .
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the 
frequency, severity, o r character of the condition worsens during the study. When 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept 
that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] 
(e.g., “more frequent headache s”).

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
135/Protocol NP40435, Version 59. LACK OF EFFICA CY OR WORSENING OF TUMOR
Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the 
underlying disease should not be recorded as adverse events. These data will be 
captured as efficacy assessment data only. In most cases, the expected pattern of 
progression will be based on RECIST Version 1.1 .In rare cases, the determination of 
clinical progression will be based on symptomatic deterioration. However, every effort 
should be made to document progression using obj ective criteria. If there is any 
uncertainty as to whether an event is due to progressive disease , it should be reported 
as an adverse event.
10. HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_260051] P ROLONGED HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_260052] a serious adverse event (per the definition of s erious 
adverse event in Appendix 2), except as outli ned below.

139/Protocol NP40435, Version 5Additional Statistical C onsiderations for Clinical Laboratory  Data
Standard Reference Ranges and Transformation of Data
[COMPANY_002] standard reference ranges, rather than the reference ranges of the Investigator, 
will be used for all parameters. For most parameters, the measured laboratory test result 
will be assessed directly using the [COMPANY_002] standard reference range. Certain laboratory 
parameters will be transformed to [COMPANY_002]’s standard reference ranges.
A transformation w ill be performed on certain laboratory tests that lack sufficiently 
common procedures and have a wide range of Investigator ranges, e.g., enzyme tests 
that include AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin. Since the standard 
reference ranges for these parameters have a lower limit of zero, only the upper limits of 
the ranges will be used in transforming the data.
Definition of Laboratory Abnormalities
For all laboratory parameters included, there exists a [COMPANY_002] predefined standard 
reference ra nge. Laboratory values falling outside this standard reference range will be 
labeled “H” for high or “L” for low in participant listings of laboratory data.
In addition to the standard reference range, a marked reference range has been 
predefined by [CONTACT_66354]. The marked reference range is 
broader than the standard reference range. Values falling outside the marked reference 
range that also represent a defined change from baseline will be considered marked 
laboratory abnormalities (i.e., potentially clinically relevant). If a baseline value is not 
available for a participant, the midpoint of the standard reference range will be used as 
the participant’s baseline value for the purposes of determining marked laboratory 
abnormalities. Marked laboratory abnormalities will be labeled in the participant listings 
as “HH” for very high or “LL” for very low.

1. DEFINITIONS
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal 
unless permanently sterile. The definition of childbearing potential may be adapted for 
alignment with local guidelines or requirements.
Women in the follo wing categories are considered to be Woman of Non -
Childbearing Potential ( WONCBP )
a)Pre-menarchal
b)Pre-menopausal female with one of the following:
–Documented hysterectomy.
–Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656].
–Documented bilateral oophorectomy.
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.
c)Post-menopausal female
–A post-menopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an
alternative medical cause other than menopause . A high follicle- stimulating
hormone (FSH) level in the post-menopausal range may be used to confirm a
post-menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or
hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months
of amenorrhea, a single F SH measurement is insufficient.
–Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt w ill be required to
use one of the non-hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they
wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue
HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status before study enrollment .

Female Participants
Female participants of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to 
use a highly effective method of contraception consistently and correctly as described in 
Table 1 below.
Per ICH M3(R2), highly effective methods of birth control are defined as those, alone or 
in combination, that result in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used 
consistently and correctly as described in Table 1below.
Table 1Highly  Effective Contraceptive Methods

Bilateral tubal occlusion
Vasectomized partner
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is 
the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If 
not, an additional highly effective me thod of contraception should be used.
Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. 
The relia bility of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study 
and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.

should be consistent with local regu lations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for 
participants participating in clinical studies.
b) A combination of male condom with either cap, diaphragm or sponge with 
spermicide (double barrier methods) are also considered acceptable, but not highly
effective, birth control methods. i.e., when the risk of teratogenicity and genotoxicity 
is unlikely.
3. PREGNA NCY TESTING
For WOCBP enrolled in the study, blood sample and urine pregnancy tests will be 
performed according to Schedule of Activity tables (see Section 1.3). If a urine 
pregnancy test is positive, it must be confirmed by a blood pregnancy test.
Pregnancy testing will be performed whenever a menstrual cycle is missed or when 
pregnancy is otherwise suspected and according to local practice .
4. COLLECTION OF PREGNA NCY INFORMATION
Male participants with partners who become pregnant
The Investigator wil l attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male participant’s 
female partner who becomes pregnant while the male participant is in this study (see 
Section 8.3.5 Pregnancy) . This applies only to male participants who receive 
RO7121661 .
Attempts should be made to collect and report details of the course and outcome of any 
pregnancy in the partner of a male participant exposed to study treatment .The
Investigator will record pregnancy information on the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting 
Form and submit it to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy . 
When permitted by [CONTACT_779], the pregnant partner would need to sign an Au thorization for 
Use and Disclosure of Pregnancy Health Information to allow for follow -up on her 
pregnancy. Ifthe auth orization has been signed, the I nvestigator should update the 
Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form with additional information on the course and 
outcome of the pregnancy when available. An I nvestigator who is contact[CONTACT_260073], to support an informed decisio n in cooperation with 

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
143/Protocol NP40435, Version 5the treating physician and/or obstetrician. The female p artner will be followed to 
determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and 
child will be forwarded to the Sponsor .Monitoring of the pa rticipa nt’s partner should 
continue until conclusion of the pregnancy. Any termination of the pregnancy will be 
reported regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for 
procedure .
Female p articipants who become pregnant
The Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female participant, who 
becomes pregnant while participating in this study (see Section 8.3.5 Pregnancy) . 
Information will be recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to the Sponsor within
24 hours of learning of a participant's pregnancy. The p articipant will be followed to 
determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The I nvestigator will collect follow -up 
information on the participant and the neonate, which will be forwarded to the Sponsor. 
Monitoring of the pa rticipan t should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy. Any 
termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or 
absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure.
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE , and should not be 
recorded on the AE eCRF, any pregnancy complication will be reported as an AE or 
SAE. A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as 
such. Any post -study pregnancy related SAE considered reasonably related to the study 
treatment by [CONTACT_737], will be reported to the Sponsor as described in 
Appendix 2.While the I nvestigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in 
former study participants, he/ she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.
Any female participant who become s pregnant while participating in the study will 
discontinue study treatment .
5 ABORTIONS
Any spontaneous abortion should be classified as a serious adverse event (as the 
Sponsor considers spontaneous abortions to be medically significan t events), recorded 
on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more 
than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5of Appendix 2).
Any induced abortion due to maternal toxicity and/or embryo -fetal toxicity should also be 
classified as serious adverse event, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported 
to the Sponso r immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see 
Section 5of Appendix 2).

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
144/Protocol NP40435, Version 5Elective or therapeutic abortion not associated with an underlying maternal or 
embryofetal toxicity (e.g ., induced abortion for personal reasons) does not require 
expedited reporting but should be reported as outcome of pregnancy on the Clinical Trial 
Pregnancy Reporting Form.
6 CON GENITA L ANOMALIES/BI RTH DEFECTS
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female participan t or female

PULMONA RY EVENTS
Dyspnea, cough, fatigue, hypoxia, pneumonitis, and pulmonary infiltrates may be
associated with the administration of RO7121661.  Patients will be assessed for 
pulmonary signs and symptoms throughout the study and will also have computed 
tomography (CT) scans of the chest performed at every tumor assessment.  
All pulmonary events should be thoroughly evaluated for other commonly reported 
etiologies such as pneumonia or other infection, lymphangitic c arcinomatosis, pulmonary 
embolism, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or pulmonary 
hypertension.  Management guidelines for pulmonary events are provided in Table 1 .

Immune -mediated meningoencephalitis may be associated with the administration of 
RO7121661. Immune -mediated meningoencephalitis should be suspected in any patient 
presenting with signs or symptoms suggestive of meningitis or encephalitis, including, 
but not limited to, headache, neck pain, confusion, seizure, motor or sensory 
dysfunction, and altered or dep ressed level of consciousness. Encephalopathy from 
metabolic or electrolyte imbalances needs to be distinguished from potential 
meningoencephalitis resulting from infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal) or progression of 
malignancy, or secondary to a paraneopl astic process.

166/Protocol NP40435, Version 5Appendix 7New Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours 
–Version 1.1 –Modified Excerpt f rom Original Publication w ith 
Addition of Supplementary  Explanations [ 1]
1. MEA SURA BILITY OF TUM OR AT BASELINE
1.1 DEFINITIONS 
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized measurable or non -
measurable as follows: 
1.1.[ADDRESS_469813] one dimension (longest diam eter 
in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of: 
[ADDRESS_469814] or MRI scan (CT/MRI scan slice thickness/interval no greater than 5 mm). 
10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be accurately 
measured with calipers should be recorded as non- measurable). 
[ADDRESS_469815] X -ray. 
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be [ADDRESS_469816] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be not greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow -up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed. See also Section 2.2below on ‘Baseline 
documentation of target and non- target lesions’ for information on lymph node 
measurement. 
1.1.2 Non- Measurable Tumor Lesions
Non-measurable tumor lesions encompass small lesions (longest diameter 10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with 10 to 15 mm short axis) as well as truly non -
measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non -measu rable include: leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, in ﬂammatory breast disease, 
lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, peritoneal spread, abdominal 
masses/abdominal organomegaly identi ﬁed by [CONTACT_86122]. 
1.1.3 Special Considerations regarding Lesion Measurability  
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require 
particular comment. 

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
167/Protocol NP40435, Version 5Bone lesions:
Bone scan, PET scan or plain ﬁlms are not considered adequate imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to con ﬁrm the 
presence or disappearance of bone lesions. 
Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identi ﬁable soft tissue components , 
that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_375500]ﬁnition of measurability described above. 
Blastic bone les ions are non -measurable. 
Cystic lesions:
Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically deﬁned simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since 
they are, by [INVESTIGATOR_5328] ﬁnition, simple cysts. 
‘Cystic le sions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the deﬁnition of measurability described above.  However, if 
noncystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection 
as target lesions. 
Lesions with prior local treatment: 
Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other 
loco-regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been 
demonstrated progression in the lesi on. Study protocols should detail the conditions 
under which such lesions would be considered measurable. 
1.2 TARGET LESIONS: SPECIFI CATIONS BY [CONTACT_40910] O F 
MEA SUREMENTS 
1.2.1 Measurement of Lesions 
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically 
assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the 
treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 
1.2.2 Method of Assessment 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identi ﬁed and reported lesion at baseline and during study. Imaging 
based evaluation should always be the preferred option. 
Clinical lesions: Clinic al lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
super ﬁcial and 10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). For 
RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
168/Protocol NP40435, Version 5the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to 
estimate the size of the les ion is suggested. 
Chest X -ray:Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression is an 
important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in identifying new 
lesions. However, lesions on chest X -ray may be considere d measurable if they are 
clearly de ﬁned and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].
CT, MRI : CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions 
selected for response assessment. This guideline has deﬁned measurability of lesions 
on CT scan b ased on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_469817] or MRI (without IV contrast) will be used to evaluate the subject at baseline and 
during study, should be guided by [CONTACT_375501]. For patients who develop contraindications to contrast after 
baseline contrast CT is done, the decision as to whether non -contrast CT or MRI 
(enhanced or non -enhanced) will be pe rformed, should also be based on the tumor type, 
anatomic location of the disease and should be optimized to allow for comparison to the 
prior studies if possible. Each case should be discussed with the radiologist to determine 
if substitution of these other approaches is possible and, if not, the patient should be 
considered not evaluable from that point forward.
Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement. 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy, Tumor markers, Cytology, Histology : The utilization of these 
techniques for objective tumor evaluation cannot generally be advised but will be 
dependent on the study design. 
2. TUMOR RESPONSE EVA LUATION 
2.1. ASSESSMENT OF OVERA LL TUMOR BURDEN A ND M EASURA BLE 
DISEA SE
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the 
overall tumor burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent 
measurements. Measurable disease is de ﬁned by [CONTACT_319357] (as detailed above in Section 1.1.1 ). 

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
169/Protocol NP40435, Version 52.2. BASELINE DOCUMENTA TION OF ‘TA RGET’ A ND ‘NON- TARGET’ 
LESIONS 
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to a 
maximum of ﬁve lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative 
of all involved organs should be identi ﬁed as target lesions and will be recorded and 
measured at baseline.
This means in instances where patients have only one or two organ sites involved, a 
maximum of two (one site) and four lesions (two sites), respectively, will be recorded. 
Other lesions (albeit measurable) in that organ will be recorded as non -measurable 
lesions (even if size is greater than [ADDRESS_469818] scan).
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be 
reproducible in repeated measurements . It may be the case that, on occasion, the 
largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in wh ich circumstance 
the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which 
may be visible by [CONTACT_33490]. As noted in Section 1.1.[ADDRESS_469819] meet the criterion of a short axis of [ADDRESS_469820] in which the image is 
obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axi al plane; for MRI the plane of 
acquisition may be axial, saggital or coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short 
axis. For example, an abdominal node which is reported as being 20 mm 30 mm has a 
short axis of 20 mm and quali ﬁes as a malignant, measurable node. In this example, 
20mm should be recorded as the node measurement. All other pathological nodes 
(those with short axis 10 mm but 15 mm) should be considered non -target lesio ns. 
Nodes that have a short axis 10 mm are considered non -pathological and should not 
be recorded or followed. 
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters . If lymph 
nodes are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added 
into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further 
characterize any objective tumor regression in the me asurable dimension of the disease. 

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
170/Protocol NP40435, Version 5All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological ly mph nodes should 
be identi ﬁed as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. 
Measurements are not required and these lesions should be foll owed as ‘present’, 
‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ (see also Section 2.3.4 ).
In addition, it is possible to record multiple non- target lesions involving the same organ 
as a single item on the case report form (e.g., ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or 
‘multiple liver metastases’). 
2.3. RESPONSE CRITERIA  
This section provides the de ﬁnitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor 
response for target lesions. 
2.3.1. Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Comp lete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non- target) must have reduction in short axis to 10mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. 
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study including baseline (nadir). In 
addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression).
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qualify for PD. 
2.3.2. Special notes on the assessment of target lesions
Lymph nodes :Lymph nodes identi ﬁed as target lesions should always have the actual 
short axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the 
baseline examination), even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study. This means 
that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be 
zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is deﬁned as 
having a short axis of 10 mm. 

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
171/Protocol NP40435, Version 5Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’ : while on study, all lesions (nodal and 
non-nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at 
each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm). However, sometimes 
lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint 
on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure 
and may report them as being ‘too small to measure’. When this occurs it is important 
that a value be recorded on the case report form:
If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26191], the 
measurement should be recorded as 0 mm.
If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a 
default value of 5 mm should be assigned and BML (below measurab le limit) should 
be ticked (Note: It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since they 
usually have a deﬁnable size when normal and are frequently surrounded by [CONTACT_169902]; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present 
and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be 
assigned in this circumstance as well and BML should also be ticked). 
To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure, that 
should be recorded, even if it is belo w 5 mm and in that case BML should not be 
ticked (BML is equivalent to a less than sign ).
Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment: when non -nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the 
longest diameters of the fragmented portions shou ld be added together to calculate the 
target lesion sum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be 
maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each 
individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such th at they are no longer 
separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal 
longest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’. 
2.3.3. Evaluation of non -target lesions 
This section provides the deﬁnitions of the criteria used to determin e the tumor response 
for the group of non -target lesions. W hile some non -target lesions may actually be 
measurable, they need not be measured and instead should be assessed only 
qualitatively at the time points speci ﬁed in the protocol. 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target lesions (and, if applicable, 
normalization of tumor marker level). All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size 
(10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non -PD:Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenanc e of 
tumor marker level above the normal limits.
RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
172/Protocol NP40435, Version 5Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression (see Section 2.3.4 ) of existing non-
target lesions. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progression. 
2.3.4. Special notes on assessment of progression of non- target disease 
When the patient also has measurable disease: in this setting, to achieve 
‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the non -target disease, there must be 
an overall level of substantial worsening in non -target disease in a magnitude 
that, even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has 
increased suff iciently  to merit discontinuation of therapy .A modest ‘increase’ in the 
size of one or more non- target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal 
progression status. The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of 
change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be 
extremely rare. 
When the patient has only non -measurable disease: this circumstance arises in some 
phase III trials when it is not a criterion of study entry to have measurabl e disease. The 
same general concepts apply here as noted above, however, in this instance there is no 
measurable disease assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in non -
measurable disease burden. Because worsening in non -target disease c annot be easily 
quanti ﬁed (by [INVESTIGATOR_5328]ﬁnition: if all lesions are truly non -measurable) a useful test that can be 
applied when assessing patients for unequivocal progression is to consider if the 
increase in overall disease burden based on the change in non -measurable disease is 
comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare PD for 
measurable disease: i.e. an increase in tumor burden representing an additional 73% 
increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a measurable 
lesion). Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from ‘trace’ to ‘large’, an 
increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be described in 
protocols as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy ’. If ‘unequivocal progression’ is 
seen, the patient should be considered to have had overall PD at that point. W hile it 
would be ideal to have objective criteria to apply to non- measurable disease, the very 
nature of that disease makes it impossible to do so; therefore the increase must be 
substantial . 
2.3.5. New Lesions 
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some 
comments on detection of new lesions are important. There are no speci ﬁc criteria for 
the identi ﬁcation of new radiographic lesions; however, the ﬁnding of a new lesion 
should be unequivocal: i.e. not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change 
in imaging modality or ﬁndings thought to represent something other than tumor (for 
example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or ﬂare of pre -existing 

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
173/Protocol NP40435, Version 5lesions). This is particularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or 
complete response. For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT 
scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is not. 
A lesion identi ﬁed during the study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. 
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, contin ued therapy and 
follow -up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans con ﬁrm 
there is de ﬁnitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of 
the initial scan. 
2.4 EVALUATION OF RESPON SE 
2.4.1 Time Point Respo nse (Overall response )
It is assumed that at each protocol specifi ed time point, a response assessment occurs. 
Table [ADDRESS_469821] non- measurable (therefore non -target) disease only, Table 2 is to 
be used.
Table 1Time Point Response –Target (w/wo non -target) Lesions

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
174/Protocol NP40435, Version 5Table 2Time Point Response –Non-Target Lesions only
2.4.2 Missing assessments and not -evaluable designation 
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time point, the patient is not 
evaluable at that time point. If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an 
assessment, usually the case is also considered not evaluable at that time point, unless 
a convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing 
lesion(s) would not change the assigned time point response. This would be most likely 
to happen in the case of PD. 
For example, if a patient had a baseline sum of [ADDRESS_469822] achieved PD status, regardless of the contribution of the missing lesion. 
If one or more target lesions were not assesse d either because the scan was not done, 
or could not be assessed because of poor image quality or obstructed view, the 
Response for Target Lesions should be “Unable to Assess” since the patient is not 
evaluable. Similarly, if one or more non -target lesions are indicated as ‘not assessed’, 
the response for non -target lesions should be “Unable to Assess” (except where there is 
clear progression).  Overall response would be “Unable to Assess” if either the target 
response or the non- target response is “Unable to Assess” (except where this is clear 
evidence of progression) as this equates with the case being not evaluable at that time 
point.

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
175/Protocol NP40435, Version 5Best response determination in trials where conﬁrmation of complete or partial response 
IS NOT required: 
Best response is deﬁned as the best response across all time points (for example, a 
patient who has SD at ﬁrst assessment, PR at second assessment, and PD on last 
assessment has a best overall response of PR). W hen SD is believed to be best 
response, it must also meet the protocol speci ﬁed minimum time from baseline. If the 
minimum time is not met when SD is otherwise the best time point response, the 
patient’s best response depends on the subsequent assessments. For example, a 
patient who has SD at ﬁrst assessment, PD at second and does not meet minimum 
duration for SD, will have a best response of PD. The same patient lost to follow -up after 
the ﬁrst SD assessment would be considered not evaluable. 
Best response determination in trials where conﬁrmation of complete or pa rtial response 
is required: 
Complete or partial responses may be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at a 
subsequent time point as speci ﬁed in the protocol (generally 4 weeks later). In this 
circumstance, the best overall response can be interpr eted as in Table 3. 
Table 3Best Overall Response when Confirmation is required
2.4.1 Special notes on response assessment 
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to 
‘normal’ size ( 10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans. This 
measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to 
overstate progression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes. As noted 
earlier, this means that p atients with CR may not have a total sum of ‘zero’ on the case 
report form (CRF). 

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
176/Protocol NP40435, Version 5Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reporte d as 
‘symptomatic deterioration’. Every effort should be made to document objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment. Symptomatic deterioration is not a 
descriptor of an objective response: it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12003]. The 
objective response status of such patients is to be determined by [CONTACT_70186]- target disease as shown in Tables 1 –3. 
For equivocal ﬁndings of progression (e.g., very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic 
changes or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled 
assessment. If at the next scheduled assessment, progression is con ﬁrmed, the date of 
progression should be the earlier date when progression was susp ected. 
In studies where patients with advanced disease are eligible (i.e., primary  disease 
still or partially  present), the primary  tumor should be also captured under target 
or non- target lesions as appropriate. This is to avoid wrong assessments of 
comp lete overall response by  [CONTACT_375502].
2.5FREQUENCY OF TUM OR RE- EVALUATION 
Frequency of tumor re -evaluation while on treatment should be protocol speci ﬁc and 
adapted to the type and schedule of treatment. However, in the context of Phase II 
studies where the beneﬁcial effect of therapy is not known, follow -up every 6 –8 weeks 
(timed to coincide with the end of a cycle) is reasonable. Smaller or greater time 
intervals than these could be justi ﬁed in speciﬁc regimens or circumstances. The 
protocol should specify which organ sites are to be evaluated at baseline (usually those 
most li kely to be involved with metastatic disease for the tumor type under study) and 
how often evaluations are repeated. Normally, all target and non -target sites are 
evaluated at each assessment. In selected circumstances certain non -target organs may 
be evalu ated less frequently. For example, bone scans may need to be repeated only 
when complete response is identi ﬁed in target disease or when progression in bone is 
suspected. 
After the end of the treatment, the need for repetitive tumor evaluations depends on
whether the trial has as a goal the response rate or the time to an event 
(progression/death). If ‘time to an event’ (e.g., time to progression, disease -free survival, 
progression -free survival) is the main endpoint of the study, then routine scheduled re -
evaluation of protocol speci ﬁed sites of disease is warranted. In randomized comparative 
trials in particular, the scheduled assessments should be performed as identi ﬁed on a 
calendar schedule (for example: every 6– 8 weeks on treatment or every 3– 4 months
after treatment) and should not be affected by [CONTACT_121243], drug holidays or any 

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
177/Protocol NP40435, Version 5other events that might lead to imbalance in a treatment arm in the timing of disease 
assessment.

where response has traditionally required con ﬁrmation in such trials [ 2]. However, in all 
other circumstances, i.e. in randomized trials (phase II or III) or studies where stable 
disease or progression are the primary endp oints, conﬁrmation of response is not 
required since it will not add value to the interpretation of trial results. However, 
elimination of the requirement for response con ﬁrmation may increase the importance of 
central review to protect against bias, in pa rticular in studies which are not blinded. 
In the case of SD, measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study 
entry at a minimum interval (in general not less than 6 –8 weeks) that is deﬁned in the 
study protocol.

179/Protocol NP40435, Version 5Appendix 8Modified RECIST v1.1 for Immune -Based 
Therapeutics (iRECIST)
Conventional response criteria may not be adequate to characterize the anti -tumor 
activity of immunotherapeutic agents, which can produce delayed responses that may 
be preceded by [CONTACT_246789], including the appearance of 
new lesions.  Ther efore, immunotherapy -specific response criteria adaptations to 
Response Evaluation Cr iteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 ( RECIST v1.1 ; Eisenhauer et 
al 2009) have been developed to allow for unconventional response and progression 
patterns .  These include modified RECIST v1.1 for i mmune- based therapeutics 
(iRECIST; Seymour et al 2017), which was developed by [CONTACT_375503] a common set of criteria that the cancer immunotherapy field could 
apply to clinical trials.
Response evaluation through use of iRECIST requires colle ction of tumor assessment 
data after radiographic progression per RECIST v1.1.  Details regarding lesion 
evaluation are described below.  When not otherwise specified, RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_469826] will not be captured in the 
electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ), but will instead be calculated programmatically by 
[CONTACT_375504] -assessed i ndividual lesion data recorded in the 
eCRF .  
iRECIST response status is not a specific component of treatment discontinuation 
criteria, including decisions about whether to continue treatment beyond progression per 
RECIST v1.1.  Investigators should inste ad take into account radiologic data and clinical 
status in making such decisions

iRECIST.  After disease progression per RECIST v1.1, the same target and non- target 
lesions selected at baseline will continue to be followed, along with any new lesions that 
develop, to support iRECIST response evaluations, as described below and summarized 
in Table 1 . Once a lesion has been categorized as a target, non -target, or new lesion, it 
will remain classified as such.

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
180/Protocol NP40435, Version 5TARGET LESIONS
The target l esions selected at baseline should continue to be measured at all tumor 
assessment timepoints after disease progression per RECIST v1.1, according to 
RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_469828] v1.1. At each timepoint, 
non-target lesions should continue to be categorized as "absent" (complete response 
[CR]), "unequivocal progression" relative to baseline (progressive disease [PD]), or 
"present without unequivocal progression" (non -CR/non -PD), as defined by 
[CONTACT_393] v1.1. In addition, any non- target lesions that were categorized as PD at the 
previous timepoint should be evaluated to determine whether there has been any f urther 
increase in size .  
NEW LESIONS
New lesions identified after baseline will be evaluated for measurability with use of the 
same criteria applied to prospective target lesions at baseline per RECIST v1.1
(e.g., non lymph node lesions must be [ADDRESS_469829] diameter; new lymph 
nodes must be 15 mm on the short axis [ see note below]).  All new lesions 
(measurable or non -measurable )must be assessed and recorded at the time of 
identification and at allsubsequent tumor assessment timepoints.
Up to a maximum of five measurable new lesions total ( witha maximum of two lesions 
per organ) should be selected and measured at each timepoint. New lesions that are not 
measurable at first appearance but meet measurability criteria at a subsequent timepoint
should be measured from that point on, if the maximum number of measurable new 
lesions has not been reached . However, for calculation of the sum of diameters for new 
lesions, iRECIST excludes measurements from new lesions that were not measurable at 
firstappearance .
All non-measurable new lesions (including those that subsequently become measurable) 
and additional measurable new lesions (in excess of five total or two per organ ) should 
be assessed to determine whether there is any increase in size relativ e to the previous 
assessment timepoint.
Note regarding new lymph node lesions : If at first appearance the short axis of a lymph 
node lesion is [ADDRESS_469830] 
appearance the short axis of a lymph node lesion is 10 mm and [ADDRESS_469831] appearance the short 
RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
181/Protocol NP40435, Version 5axis of a lymph node is10 mm , the lymph node should not be considered pathological 
and should not be considered a new lesion. A lymph node can subsequently become 
measurable, when the short axis is 15 mm . Measurable new lymph node lesion s
should continue to be measured at all subsequent timepoints, even if the short axis 
decreases to 15mm (or even 10mm).

184/Protocol NP40435, Version 5Appendix 10Modified Continuous Reassessment Method w ith 
Escalation w ith Overdose Control Design
This appendix provides details of the design that will guide the monotherapy dose-
escalation stage of this study and examines its operating characteristics through 
simulations. All analyses were performed using the R statistical software R version 3.4.2.
RATIONA LE FOR MODEL BASED DESIGN
The modified Continuous Reassessment Method (mCRM) design uses a statistical 
model that actively seeks a dose level close to the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) by 
[CONTACT_375506] a precise dose -toxicity 
curve. It locates the MTD efficiently and minimizes the number of patients treated at 
possibly pharmacologic al inactive dose levels. Such model -based designs have been 
successfully applied in many Phase I dose escalation studies ( Schöffski et al 2004 ; Le 
Tourneau et al 2009 ; Neuenschwand er et al 2008). The simulations in this appendix 
investigate the operating characteristics of the design as implemented for this study.
In this design the MTD is defined as the dose maximizing the posterior probability 
that the DLT rate , while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_375424] 
. 
STATISTICA L MODEL
A two -parameter logistic model will be used to fit the dose -toxicity relationship.
The probability of DLT at dose dj, p(d j)is defined as (1) 
where
and d*is the reference dose (in this case d*70mg). 
The model (1) thus can be rewritten as (2):

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
185/Protocol NP40435, Version 5where and are the parameters to be estimated and assumed to follow a bivariate 
normal distribution.
Model Prior
A minimally informative bivariate normal prior for the parameters of the DLT -dose 
response curve (, )is constructed in order to have a weak impact to the final MTD 
determination ( Neuenschwander et al. 2008 ). 
The parameters of the minimal informative prior are listed below (3):  
where and are the parameters of the bivariate normal distribution.
The prior distribution used to determine the dose -escalation decision for this study is 
shown in Figure 1 .

RO7121661 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
186/Protocol NP40435, Version 5Maximum Dose -Increments
The following rules for selecting the maximum allowed dose increment will be applied.
Maximum Dose- Increments Relative to Dose Levels 
In absence of DLT, the maximum allowable dose -increment w ill be 200% (i.e. next dose 
could be as high as 3 fold as previous one) for dose- levels 700 mg and 100% (i.e. 2 
fold) for dose -levels 700 mg 
Maximum Dose- Increments Relative to DLT 
In case of one event of DLT in a dose -level, the maximum allowable do se increment 
becomes 100% (i.e. 2 fold), while in presence of 2 DLTs an increment of 50% is allowed 
(i.e. 1.5 fold).
After the two rules have been applied the maximum allowed dose increment will be 
defined as the lower increment of the two resulting increm ents.
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_375425]: 
Maximum number of patients: stop if the maximum sample size of [ADDRESS_469833] 
been reached OR 
Enough information on MTD: at least a minimum of [ADDRESS_469834] been accrued near the MTD dose (where near means differing from 
the MTD by [CONTACT_375444] 15%) and the probability that the MTD dose lies within the 
target toxicity interval is above 50% OR 
Maximum dose is safe: at least a minim um of [ADDRESS_469835] been accrued at the 
maximum dose or near (differing from the maximum dose by [CONTACT_375444] 5%) and it is 
at least 50% likely that the probability of a DLT for that maximum dose is below 
20%.
Dose Grid
The following dose grid has been used for the simulations: 
from 30 mg to 100 mg by 2.5 
from 105 mg to 1000 mg by 5
from 1010 mg to 2100 mg by 10.

187/Protocol NP40435, Version 5MODEL PERFORMANCE EV ALUATION
To illustrate how the design will perform, different escalation scenarios are explored and 
results are tabulated in Table 1. Each row represents different situations: which dose 
would the model recommend, after seeing no DLTs in prev ious cohorts and when 0, 1, 
2, or 3 DLTs are observed in the current cohort. The evaluation is based on cohort 
size=3, STOP indicates that the model would stop escalating and the trial would be 
halted.

As can be seen from the Table above, in general in presence of no DLTs the model will 
suggest to escalate as the max increments indicate, while in presence of one DLT the 
increments are really limited. Then, with 2 or 3 DLTs the model always recommends to 
de-escalate or STOP. Therefore, the results show that the design will adequately adapt 
the dose in the presence of observed DLTs.
SIMULA TION STUDY
A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the operating characteristics for the chosen 
design parameters (priors, reference dose, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]) under various dose- toxicity 
scenarios. 
Dose -Toxicity  Scenarios
The different scenarios hav e been selected in order to cover a wide range of dose -
toxicity possibilities and to be able to quantify the risk and benefit, should these 
scenarios actually occur. 
As shown in Figure [ADDRESS_469836] one considers the toxicity depi[INVESTIGATOR_375426].

For each of the scenarios, 1000 trials were simulated and in all cases the starting dose 
of 70 mg was assumed.  
The design is evaluated using the following criteria: the MTD chosen, the number of 
subjects treated at doses higher than the MTD and the total number of subjects treated. 
For each criterion, we report in Table 2 the median (and 10th90thpercentiles) from the 
1000 simulations.

From these simulations, we see that the design is able to provide a reliable estimate of 
the MTD: usually, the median of the doses selected as MTD is within the target toxicity 
dose range. Only in case the toxicity curve is very steep (e.g. Scenario 5) the median 
might lie just below the target toxicity, which means that we are conservative. 
At last, in case of very low toxicity (dose range of target toxicity between 3500 and 7000 
mg), the maximum dose is selected as MTD. 
In addition, we see that we the n umber of patients treated over the dose toxicity interval 
is quite limited, with the exception of the first scenario where –by [CONTACT_375507] -all pts were treated above the target toxicity. 
The good performances of the algorith m are also confirmed by [CONTACT_375508], which is always <25% (again, Scenario 1 is an 
exception).

patients required to give an MTD recommendation is maximum 39 patients across all 
scenarios. In case of too high toxicity, the required number of treated patients is even 
lower.

191/Protocol NP40435, Version 5Appendix 11Exposure Ratios from Nonclinical Safety  Findings 
to Human Exposures
Prediction of human PK followed an allometric scaling approach.  Based on first -week 
DRF and GLP data in cynomolgus monkey, a two- compartment model was developed 
with additional Michaelis Menten approximation to de scribe the nonlinear clearance. It is 
expected that at therapeutically relevant doses, the nonlinear clearance in human is fully 
saturated. Therefore, the predicted exposures in humans were calculated using the 
linear PK model only.
The projected AUC 0-336and C maxin humans after a single flat dose of 70 mg 
(corresponding to 1 mg/kg) are 3900 g⋅h/mL and 25.2 g/mL, respectively. Thes e 
values are approximately 180 -and 116 -fold lower, respectively, than the exposure 
observed in cynomolgus monkeys at the 150 mg/kg NOAEL in the 4- week GLP 
toxicology study (differences in potency i.e. , 2-fold more potent in humans than in 
monkeys and dosi ng schedule were accounted for).
Prediction of human exposure (C maxand AUC 0-336) and associated margins as compared 
to the NOAEL dose level of 150 mg/kg identified in the cynomolgus monkey at steady 
state (i.e., following eight administrations) are provided in Table 1 (including non -clinical 
safety findings) .

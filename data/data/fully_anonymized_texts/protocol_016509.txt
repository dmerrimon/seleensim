Abstract  
Inhaled J32-adrenergic agonists  have  been shown  to reduce pulmonary  
vascular resistance (PVR) in hypoxic COPD patients, and right ventricular  
systolic pressure in normoxic COPD patients with mild pulmonary  
hypertension (PH). Furthermore, we have recently found that inhaled albuterol  lowers  PVR  as assessed  by [CONTACT_382434] -smokers (Chest 2017; 151: 650- 657). While the pulmonary  
vascular  effects of  J32-adrenergic agonists  could be  indirectly related to the 
drug's bronchodilator action in patients  with COPD, the demonstrated J32- 
adrenergic agonist induced pulmonary vasodilation in healthy subjects  
strongly suggests a direct pulmonary vasodilatory effect. This raises the 
possibility  that inhaled J32-adrenergic agonists could cause pulmonary  
vasodilation in patients with pulmonary hypertension not associated with  
heart disease, chronic lung disease or thromboembolic disease (WHO  
group 1 PAH). In the present proof of concept proposal, we will use  
echocardiography to assess the acute pulmonary hemodynamic  effect of  
albuterol  in 6 patients  with group 1 PAH  documented  by [CONTACT_382435]  (mean  pulmonary  arterial  pressure  >25mmHg,  PVR  > 3 
wood/u and pulmonary  wedge pressure  <15).  The patients  
will be on regular oral pulmonary vasodilator therapy. Mean pulmonary  
arterial pressure (MPAP) and cardiac output will be measured before and 
serially for [ADDRESS_479342]  
albuterol, administered by [CONTACT_12699], markedly and significantly reduced 
PVR in lung- and heart healthy current smokers and never smokers (1).  
Other studies involving inhaled J32- adrene rgic agonists were carried out in 
patients with COPD without or with PAH (group 3). Early studies have 
shown that short -acting  J32-adrenergic agonists  can reduce PVR in hypoxic  
COPD patients with PAH (2,3). More recently, Cazzola et al (4) assessed 
two long -acting  J32-adrenergic agents (formoterol  and salmeterol) in COPD  
patients,  with or without  mild pulmonary  hypertension.  Following 
administration of these  agents,  they observed  a reduction in 
echocardiographic  systolic  pulmonary  arterial  pressure that lasted less than 
[ADDRESS_479343] function. This caveat also applies to 
another investigation of albuterol's action in patients with PAH in whom the  
drug caused both bronchodilat ion and pulmonary  vasodilation  at the time of 
right heart catheterization to assess responses to vasodilators, with the 
possibility  that a change in ventilation/perfusion relationship reversed  
hypoxic  vasoconstriction  thereby  [CONTACT_382436] (5). 
 
The purpose of the present pi[INVESTIGATOR_382425] 1 PAH  who are on regular oral pulmonary  vasodilator  
 therapy, inhaled albuterol causes transient pulmonary vasodilation. If the 
results support this premise, they could serve as the basis for a phase 2  
trial investigating the potential for using inhaled long- acting 2- adrenergic  
agonists  as add-on therapy  in group 1 PAH.

Targeted  outcomes  
 
Change in MPAP, PVR after inhalation of 270µg albuterol administered 
with a spacer.  These parameters,  measured/calculated by 
[CONTACT_51541], will be obtained before and at 15, 30, 60 and 120 after  
albuterol or placebo  inhalation.  At each  measurement  point, systemic blood 
pressure, 02 saturation by [CONTACT_382441][INVESTIGATOR_382426] (the latter to rule out drug induced changes in airway function  
that could indirectly influence pulmonary hemodynamics). We previously  
have observed that the albuterol response wanes by 60 min in healthy  
subjects (1). Each participant will serve as his/her own control and the two  
treatments  will be administered  on diff erent experiment  days in random 
order. Participants and investigators will be blinded (HFA albuterol and 
matching placebo are available to the investigators).  
 
Measurements  
 
Echocardiography  and calculation of PVR:  
 
Studies  will be performed  using  the SONOS  5500 ultrasound system  
(Philips  Medical  Systems)  as previously  used in our laboratory  (1). 
Measurements will start following [ADDRESS_479345]. The imaging will  
proceed according to the following sequence at each time point (baseline 
and 15, 30, 60, and 120min post -drug administration). Images will be 
acquired for 1- [ADDRESS_479346] 10 cardiac cycles in order to obtain 3 
cycles for quantification.  All measure ments are made offline. Blood 
pressure and heart rate will be measured on the final image of each time  
point  measurement  using an automated monitor (Dinamap,  model 
1846XT). Traditionally, the maximum velocity of the tricuspid regurgitation 
(TRvmax;  cm/sec) has been used  to calculate pulmonary  vascular  resistance  
(PVR).  However,  this method is not feasible when TR is absent  or trivial.  
Therefore, we will also obtain the pulmonary artery acceleration time  
(PAAT), which has been shown to correlate highly with invasively  
measurement of mean pulmonary artery pressure (6). The PAAT will be used as an alternative to the TR method because it does not rely on the  
presence of an anatomic defect or valvular regurgitation and is highly  
correlated  (r = -.96) with TRvmax  (7). TRvmax  will be defined as the maximal  
 velocity  of the TR  jet measured using  continuous -wave Doppler  in the 4- 
chamber  view. Estimated  peak  systolic pulmonary  artery pressure (PSPAP)  
will be calculated  using  the modified  Bernoulli equation:  4 x TRvmax2  + 
10mmHg (to account  for right  atrial  pressure)  (8). The  use of 10mmHg as 
an estimate of right  atrial  pressure has been shown  to yield similar  
correlates  with catheter -based estimates  of right ventricular  systolic  
pressure  (RVSP)  (9). The PAATwill  be measured using the pulse- wave  
Doppler  profile in the parasternal  short axis view. PAAT  (msec) will be  
defined as the interval between the onset of systolic  pulmonary  arterial  flow 
and peak  flow velocity.  The MPAPPAAT  (mm Hg) will be computed  by: 
79 - (PAAT x 0.45) (9). The right ventricular ejection time (RVET) will also  
be obtained and defined as the interval  between the onset  of RV ejection  to 
the point of systolic pulmonary arterial flow cessation. Using pulse- wave  
Doppler in the 5- chamber view, measures of cardiac function will include  
stroke volume (SV), wherein SV = 3.14 x (LVOT diameter/2)2 x VTI. The  
inter-beat interval is used to derive heart rate (HR) and cardiac output (CO)  
is the product of SV and HR.  Left atrial pressure (LAP) is estimated using 
Doppler  echocardiography (1 O); thus,  LAP (mm Hg) is computed from the  
ratio of the E and e' waves of Doppler trans -mitral flow and mitral annulus  
tissue  Doppler  imaging as follows:  LAP = 1.24 x  E/e' +2. 
 
Pulmonary  vascular  resistance (PVR) will be estimated in two ways  based 
on the estimation of pulmonary  artery  pressure  and LAP: a) as derived from 
the TR method,  PSPAP will be used to estimate  mean  pulmonary  artery  
pressure (MPAPrR)  as follows:  MPAPrR  = 0.6 x PSPAP +2 (11). Then, the  
PVRrR  is the ratio of (MPAPrR  - LAP)  and CO; and b) as derived  from the - 
PAAT method, the PVRPAAT is the ratio of (MPAPPAAT - LAP) and CO.  All 
values  used for analysis  will be computed from the average  of three cardiac  
cycles per time point.  
 
Pulmonary  function  
 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_382427] (FEV1/FVC  <0.7).  In 
the tracing with the highest  FVC of three forced vital capacity,  FEV1,  FVC, 
FEV1/FVC, IC, MMEF and peak flow will be analyzed.  Predicted normal  
values  will be taken  from Harkinson NHANES  Ill. The results  will be 
expressed in absolute values  and percent  of predicted.  
  
Statistical  analysis  
 
The study is a repeated- measures design with medication treatment vs.  
placebo  and time post -treatment (pre- inhalation baseline,  15, 30, 60,  
120min) as fixed  within  subject  effects.  The resulting factorial  combinations  
will permit ANCOVA estimation of the main effects of treatment and time,  
as well as the [ADDRESS_479347] interaction (treatment by [CONTACT_5586]). In addition, ANCOVA  
analyses will be performed to examine treatment effects on the different  
outcomes.  Significance will be  accep ted at p<0.05.  
 
Procedures  
 
There will be [ADDRESS_479348] is randomized to  
for visit 2. 
  
 
 
 
Safety  
 
There is  minimal  risk: 
 
Echocardiography  
No side effects  have been reported.  
 
Pulmonary  function  tests  
There is little risk from spi[INVESTIGATOR_038].  Some people may have some chest  
soreness or lightheadedness from the hard blowing.  The chest soreness  
usually  is short -lived,  but can be treated with non-prescription  pain relievers.  
 
Inhaled Albuterol  
This drug is approved for clinical  use in obstructive  lung disease  in the US, 
and will be administered at a clinically  recommended  dose. Possible 
serious side effects include chest and muscular pain, tremor, headache,  
tachycardia, throat irritation, nauseas and vomiting. Although a possible 
interaction between inhaled albuterol and oral pulmonary vasodilators has  
not been systematically evaluated to  our knowledge, we believe that it is  
safe to add a f32 -adrenergic agonist to oral vasodilators based on clinical  
experience in patients  with co-existing  PAH  and obstructive  lung disease.  
 
Study  duration  
 
The total duration of the study will be 6 months from the time of IRS  
approval.  We estimate  a total of 30 participant visits (3 visits each for  
1Qe enrolled participants  plus 4 visits  for screen  failures)  or approximately  
one visit per week.  Screen failures  should be rare given the selection  
criteria  and the extensive  clinical data available prior to considering a 
patient  for screening.  
 
Recruitment  Process  
 
Potential candidates will be identified by [CONTACT_382442]- Pl in the Pulmonary  
Hypertension(PH) clinic at the UHealth. If a patient with PH is eligible for  
the study  and agrees  to participate  in the study,  the Pl or the Sub-Pl will 
 notify  the study  coordinator.  The Research Team  and the Pl will present  
the study to the patient. Eligible patients will be asked to read,  
comprehend,  and sign an informed consent  form.  This procedure will be 
performed according to the local regulatory authorities. Potential  
participants will be given the choice to take a copy of Consent Form to  
review  at home and or discuss with his/her PCP.  
 
No study procedures will be conducted until the informed consent form is  
previously signed. Participants will have to sign a HIPAA Form as well. A  
copy  of the signed consent  and HIPAA Form  will be provided to the patient.  
A review of the subject's medical record will be conducted to confirm that  
the subject  meets  inclusion/exclusion criteria  as per protocol.  
 
 
Pregnancy  
Taking the study drug may involve unknown risks to a pregnant woman, an 
embryo, fetus (unborn baby) or nursing infant. Therefore, if female participant  is pregnant,  planning to become pregnant  or are breastfeeding a 
child,  participant  cannot  participate in this  study. In order to reduce the risk  
of pregnancy,  participant  must  use an effective  method of birth control  
while participating in this study (and for 1 month) after participant complete  
the study treatment. If participant is already using a method of birth control,  
the study doctor or study staff will discuss with her whether her current  
method of birth control  is acceptable for use during this study.  If, during this 
study  and 3_0 days after completion  of the study,  participant  becomes 
pregnant,  she should notify  the study  doctor as soon as possible.  The study  
drug will be stopped and her participation in this study will be ended. Data  
during pregnancy and pregnancy outcome will be collected. For those 
females who become pregnant because their male partner is in the study,  
pregnancy  outcome data will not be collected.  
 
 
 
Data  collection  and storage:  
 
Case Report Forms (CRFs) will be provided for each subject. Participants  
will not be identified  by [CONTACT_382443].  
The paper records  will be kept in a secure location (Pulmonary  Research 
Office)  in a locked office with limited  access.  
 All clinical information requested will be recorded in the CRFs .  
CRFs  must  be reviewed and verified  for accuracy by [CONTACT_11097] [INVESTIGATOR_382428] a safety  password 
protected electronic system. A copy of the CRF will remain at the 
Investigator's  site at the completion  of the study.  
 
Data  Recording  
 
All data will be entered into an electronic  database (RedCap).  Patients  will 
be provided with a unique study  number and only the study  team  will have 
access to the database.  
 
Maintenance of data  confidentiality  
The investigator/delegate will ensure that data confidentiality is maintained.  
On CRFs or other documents, subjects will be identified only by [CONTACT_6227],  
and never  by [CONTACT_180530],  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_382429],  SSN  or any other 
identifier. The investigator/delegate will keep a subject identification code 
list, at the site, showing the randomization number, the subject's name,  
date of birth and address  or any other locally  accepted identifiers.  CRFs  will 
be kept at the Pulmonary Research Center located at [ADDRESS_479349] status at any time point during the course of the 
study.  
 
While  entering the data,  the investigator/delegate will be  instantly  alerted to 
data queries by [CONTACT_42940]. Additional data review will  
be performed on an ongoing basis to look for unexpected patterns in data  
and study monitoring by [CONTACT_079]. If discrepant data are 
detected, a query specifying the problem and requesting clarification will be issued and visible to the investigator/delegate via the CRF. All electronic  
queries  visible  in the system  either require a data correction (when 
applicable) and/or a response from the investigator/delegate to clarify the  
queried data directly  in the CRF,  or simply  a data correction in the CRF.
 
  
 
 
Confidentiality  
 
All information relating to this research protocol will be kept confidential to 
the extent permitted by [CONTACT_2371]. However, records will be available to the 
University of Miami IRB, sponsor, appropriate governmental agencies, and 
by [CONTACT_382444]. Study staff is HIPAA trained and complied with our  
Institution  requirements.  
 
A file for each subject will be maintained that includes the signed ICF and  
subject information sheet and the Investigator's copi[INVESTIGATOR_93687]. The Investigator will ensure the reliability  and availability  of source  documents  from which  the information in 
the CRF was  derived.

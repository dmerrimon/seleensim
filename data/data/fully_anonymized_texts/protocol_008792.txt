Methodology:  
DESCRIPTION  
This is a 3 -year (maximum), single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase 3 follow-on trial of 
ARGX -113-1704 to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of efgartigimod in patients with 
gMG. The trial consists of 2 parts: Part A (1 year) and Part B (up  to maximum [ADDRESS_240994]). The additional part (Part  B) was added to ARGX-113- [ADDRESS_240995] access to efgartigimod while it is not yet commercially 
available or available through another patient program. This extension will also enable additional long-
term safety and tolerability data to be collected.  
A variable number of treatmen t periods consisting of 4 weekly infusions of efgartigimod (10 mg/kg of 
body weight) infused over a period of 3 weeks will be administered to eligible patients on an “as 
needed basis” on top of their standard of care (SoC). The time between treatment perio ds is based on 
the duration of the treatment effect and may vary from patient to patient and within each patient from period to period (patient
-tailored approach). 
The first visit of trial ARGX -113-[ADDRESS_240996] visit of trial ARGX-113- 1704 for 
each patient.  
The study entry baseline (SEB) will be set at the first trial visit, while the baseline of each subsequent 
treatment period (TP nB for Part A or TPE nB for Part B) will be set at visit 1 of each corresponding 
treatment period.  
ROLL -OVER 
At the end of study (EoS) visit of trial ARGX -113- 1704, eligible patients will be offered the option to 
roll over into this trial. Patients in need of (re -)treatment in trial ARGX-113-1704 but who cannot 
complete a Treatment Cycle within the time frame of th at trial, may immediately roll over to this trial 
to receive treatment with efgartigimod.  
Patients who discontinued early from trial ARGX -113-1704 or discontin ued early from randomized 
treatment for rescue or pregnancy reasons or for a seri ous adverse event (SAE) that is likely to result in 
a life -threatening situation or pose a serious safety risk in that trial will not be offered the option to roll 
over into t his trial. 
Patients who discontinued early from randomized treatment for other reasons and patients who had a 
temporary interruption from randomized treatment in trial ARGX -113- [ADDRESS_240997] complete the early discontinuation (ED) 
visit assessments specified in Table 2. The previous ef gartigimod IV dose must have been received at least 30 
days before entry into ARGX -113-2002.

argenx Confidential 13 Patients can enroll in ARGX-113-2002 until its recruitment has closed. Patients who enroll in 
ARGX -113-2002 will not return to ARGX-113-1705. 
(RE-)TREATMENT (Part A) 
Each patient will start a (new) treatment period with efgartigimod when all the following criteria apply:  
x The patient has completed the previous treatment period (ie, after visit 4) 
x The patient has a total MG- ADL score of ≥5 points with more than 50% of the total score 
due to non-ocular symptoms 
x The patient has a reduction in the MG- ADL total score of <2 points compared to the score 
at: 
1. The last treatment cycle baseline (TCB) in trial ARGX-113- [ADDRESS_240998] treatment 
period (TP 1) in trial ARGX-113-[ADDRESS_240999] treatment period baseline (TP nB) for all subsequent treatment periods (TP n+1) 
in trial ARGX-113-1705 
However, patients may  not receive (re-)treatment with efgartigimod if, at the time of (re- )treatment, 
they have clinical evidence of bacterial, viral or fungal disease, or any other significant disease which 
could confound the results of the trial or put patients at undue risk . Patients who are in need of an 
additional treatment but who ar e not eligible to receive (re -)treatment for reasons listed here will 
remain in the trial to receive appropriate alternative MG treatment  (see Appendix 5 and Appendix 6 ). 
Patients who show a treatment failure to efgartigimod for [ADDRESS_241000] 50% of the assessments (ie, 
TPnV2, TP nV3, TP nV4 and the first posttreatment period visit).  
If a patient becomes eligible for (re -)treatment with efgartigimod by [CONTACT_202017]-ADL score as stated in Section 4.1, but cannot complete the entire treatment period during Part A 
(ie, after day  336) then the patient can be transitioned to Part B after completing the end of Part A 
(EoA) visit assessments ( Table 1 ). These assessments should be completed even if the patient is 
unwilling or unable to continue to Part  B (see Section 5.1). 
The transition to Part  B can be either at ITPE 0V1 or TPE 1V1, depending on the patient’s status 
regarding the need for (re -)treatment upon transition from Part A. The first visit in Part B will always 
coincide with the EoA visit in Part  A. The assessments done for the last visit in Part A should not be 
repeated in Part  B. 
(RE-)TREATMENT (Part B) 
If the patient feels that his/her condition has deteriorated, then the investigator may start a new 
treatment period at an intertreatment period (ITPE) visit or the patient may contact [CONTACT_202018].  
A patient can start the next treatment period and receive efgartigimod if all of the followin g criteria are 
met:  
x The patient has completed the previous tr eatment period (ie, after visit 4)* 
x The investigator determines that the patient will benefit from re-treatment 
x There is at least 1 calendar month (minimum 4 we eks) between treatment periods (ie, between 
TPE nV4 and TPE n+1V1) 
*A patient who has had a temporary interruption of trial treatment in Part A may also continue into Part 
B of the trial and receive (re -)treatment if the conditions in Section 4.4.1 are met.

they have clinical evidence of bacterial, viral or fungal disease, or any other significant disease which 
could confound the results of the trial or put patients at undue risk.  
If a patient becomes eligible for (re -)treatment with efgartigimod but cannot complete the entire 
treatment period within the  duration of the trial, the patient should continue to the EoS visit. 
If the investigator considers that the patient will not have a clinical benefit from (re -)treatment then the 
patient cannot start a new treatment period. The patient should then continue to the EoS visit.  
STANDARD OF CARE (SoC) 
In Part A:  
Permitted SoC for MG treatment under this protocol include NSIDs (eg, azathioprine, methotrexate, 
cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclophosphamide), steroids, as well as 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors.  
A change of the type or dose/regimen of SoC (replacing, adding or removing SoC, or adjustment of the 
SoC dose and/or frequency) is not allowed:  
x From trial entry until [ADDRESS_241001] 12 hours prior to performing the QMG 
assessment. Following this requirement, this possible temporary change in dosing regimen of AChE 
inhibitors will not be considered as a change in SoC.  
In Part B:  
A change of the type or dose/regimen of SoC (replacing, adding or removing SoC, or adjustment of the 
SoC dose and/or fr equency) is allowed, without restrictions, following current medical practice. 
Plasma exchange (PLEX), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), immunoadsorption or use of a new 
type of corticosteroid or an increased dose of the current corticosteroids used as st and-alone therapy or 
in combination is also allowed in Part  B. 
TIME BETWEEN TREATMENT PERIODS  
At the end of each treatment period, patients will enter a variable intertreatment period  during which 
they will be treated with their SoC only. The length of the  intertreatment period may vary from patient 
to patient and for each patient from period to period (patient -tailored approach). For Part A, the visit 
frequency in the intertreatment period is every 30 days (± 2 days) after the previous visit. For Part B, 
the visit frequency in the intertreatment period is every 90 days (± 7 days) after the previous visit. If an 
inter-treatment period (ITP) visit for Part A is scheduled within 14 days of the EoA visit, then the EoA 
visit should be performed instead.  
RESCUE THERAPY (Part  A only) 
Rescue therapy will be limited to PLEX, IVIg, immunoadsorption or use of a new type of 
corticosteroid or an increased dose of the current corticosteroids used as stand -alone therapy or in 
combination.

argenx Confidential 15 Rescue therapy is permitted for patients experiencing protocol-defined MG clinical deterioration AND 
if in addition the treating physician believes that the patient’s health is in jeopardy if rescue therapy is 
not given. An  MG clinical deterioration permitting rescue therapy to be given is defined as a patient 
experiencing at least 1 of the following: (1) new or worsening of respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] / bulbar symptoms or (2) 
at least 2 -point increase of individual non-ocular MG-ADL items. Whenever possible, prior to giving 
rescue therapy to a patient, the Medical Director  at the sponsor and the Medical Monitor at the 
sponsor’s designated Contract Research Organization (CRO) should be informed.  
In situations where the treatments as listed a bove are given under the protocol- defined rescue criteria, 
patients will be discontinued early from the trial.  
EARLY DISCONTINUATION  
For patients who discontinue early from the trial, the assessments will depend on the visit at which it 
was decided that th e patient had to discontinue (see Section 5.4, Figure 1,  and Figure 2). 
Patients who discontinue early from the trial within a treatment period should perform the planned 
assessments of the corresponding treatment period visit. These patients will not receive any further 
administration of efgartigimod during the trial and wi ll return for the ED visit 1 month (30 ± 2 days) 
after the last dose administration. An unscheduled vi sit can be organized if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1275].  
Patients who discontinue ear ly from the trial between the last visit of a treatment period (TP nV4 or 
TPE nV4) and the next intertreatment period visit (ITP nVn or ITPE nVn) should perform the ED 
assessments 1 month (30 ± 2 days) after the last dose administration.  
Patients who discontin ue early from the trial at the ITP (Part A) or ITPE (Part B) visit should perform 
the ED assessments, instead of the ITP nVn (Part A) or ITPE nVn  (Part B) assessments.  
Patients who discontinue early from the trial after the ITP (Part  A) or ITPE (Part B) visit should 
perform the ED assessments.  
Any patient prematurely discontinuing the trial during Part A should perform the EoA/ED assessments 
according to the General Schedule of Assessments for Part A ( Table 1 ). Any patient prematurely 
discontinuing the trial during Part B should perform the EoS/ED assessments according to the General 
Schedule of Assessments for Part  B (Table 2 ). 
Before enrolling in ARGX -113-[ADDRESS_241002] complete the early discontinuation (ED) 
visit assessments specified in Table [ADDRESS_241003] a temporary 
interruption from trial treatment which is defined as a discontinuation only from the current treatment 
period. Therefore, these patients might still be elig ible for further additio nal treatments with

argenx Confidential 24 d For patients who discontinue early from the trial, the assessme nts will depend on the visit at which it was decided that the p atient had to discontinue (see 
Section 5.4). Patients who discontinue early from the trial within a treatmen t period should perform the planned assessments of the corres ponding treatment 
period visit. These patients wi ll not receive any further administration of efgartigimod during the trial and return for the ED  visit 1 month (30 ±2 days) after the 
last dose administration. An unscheduled visit can be organized if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093]. Patients who discontin ue early from the trial between 
the last visit of a treatment period (TPE nV4) and the next intertreatment period visit (ITPE nVn) should perform the ED assessments 1 month (30 ±2 days) after 
the last dose administration. Patients who discontinue early from the trial at the ITPE visit should perform the ED assessments  instead of the ITPE nVn 
assessments. Patients who discontinue prematurely from the tr ial after the ITPE visit should perform the ED assessments. 
e Before enrolling in ARGX-113-[ADDRESS_241010] complete the early discontinuation (ED) visit assessments. T he previous efgartigimod IV 
dose must have been received at least 30 days before entry into ARGX-113-2002.

argenx Confidential 37 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Background Information 
Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune dis order characterized in mo st cases by T-cell and 
antibody responses to neuromuscular junction proteins such as skeletal muscle nicotinic 
acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Antibodies against epi[INVESTIGATOR_201986], resulting in the characteristic fatigue and 
weakness associated with this severe disorder. The muscle weakness fluctuates with activity, and periods of rest offer only a temporary reprieve.
[ADDRESS_241022]-synaptic AChRs. Anti-AChR antibodies are present in approximately 80% of all 
autoimmune MG patients. Less frequent autoantibodies found in autoimmune MG include the anti-muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) antibod y (4% of the cases), and the anti-lipoprotein 
receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4) antibody (2% of the cases) directed against LRP4. All these autoantibodies belong to the immunoglobulin gamma (IgG) class.
2,3  
In approximately 5% to 20% of the MG patients , no serum antibodies against neuromuscular 
junction proteins can be detected.4,5  Although in some seronegative MG patients the disease 
may not be mediated by [CONTACT_79425], in other cases the (apparent) absence of specific autoantibodies in patients may be due to insufficient sensitivity of the assay. Indeed, one-third of 
MG patients, who are seronegative on standard te sting, are seropositive on cell-based testing. 
The seronegative group probably includes some pa tients with anti-AChR, -MuSK or -LRP4 
antibodies that are not detected because of insufficient test sensitivity.
3  
The treatment of MG is based on a variety of me dications and medical procedures used either 
alone or in combination (see Section  1.3). 
Given the pathogenic role of autoantibodies in MG, a possible novel therapeutic approach to this disease may include the use of drugs that lower the level of pathogenic autoantibodies rapi[INVESTIGATOR_201987]. Since all the specific autoantibodies found in MG belong to the IgG isotype, 
agents that specifically lower the level of these antibodies without affecting the level of other isotypes such as IgA, IgE and IgM may be of special interest. 
One such strategy involves inhibition of the neonatal crystallizable fragment (Fc) receptor 
(FcRn). FcRn was shown to play a central role in trafficking IgGs and albumin into recycling 
pathways rescuing them from lysosomal degrada tion. Molecules that block the interaction of 
FcRn with IgGs are expected to induce degradation and fast clearance of pathogenic IgGs 
leading to a lowering of their serum level.

Clinical Trial Protocol Version 4.0, Final  [ADDRESS_241023] 
Efgartigimod (ARGX-113) is a human IgG1-derived Fc fragment of the za allotype that binds 
with nanomolar affinity to human FcRn. Efgartigimod encompasses IgG1 residues D220-K447 
(EU numbering scheme) and has been modified with the so- called ABDEG™ technology 
(ABDEG™ = antibody that enhances IgG degradation)8 to increase its affinity for FcRn at both 
physiological and acidic pH. The increased affini ty for FcRn of efgartigimod at both acidic and 
physiological pH results in a constitutively blockage of FcRn-mediated recycling of IgGs. 
Given the essential role of the FcRn receptor in IgG homeostasis, inhibiting this FcRn function, 
as achieved by [CONTACT_202025], leads to rapid degradation of IgGs, which is expected to include autoantibodies in IgG-driven autoimmune diseases. 
This concept has been validated in various  murine disease models together with 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) studies in cynomolgus monkeys, either by [CONTACT_202026] a full-lengthmonoclonal antibody analog (HEL- ABDEG™).
9,10 
The antibody clearing properties of efgartigimod were confirmed in PK/PD studies in cynomolgus monkeys. A single infusion of efgartigimod resulted in a decrease of IgG up to 55% 
without altering serum albumin concentrations nor IgM or IgA levels. This PD effect as 
measured with a tracer IgG molecule was proven to be more potent than intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), both in rapi[INVESTIGATOR_201988]. Repeated dosing could 
improve the PD effect up to a maximum IgG reduction of 75%. 
These nonclinical data validated the further development of efgartigimod for assessing its 
therapeutic potential in IgG-driven autoimmune indications. 
To date, a phase 1 (ARGX-113-1501) and a pha se 2 (ARGX-113-1602) trial are completed as 
part of the clinical development of efgartigimod for the treatment of generalized myasthenia 
gravis
 (gMG).  
ARGX-113-[ADDRESS_241024]-in-Human (FIH) 
phase 1 trial conducted in 62 healthy volunteers to assess the safety and tolerability and to 
evaluate the PK and PD characteristics of single and multiple ascending intravenous (IV) doses 
of efgartigimod. The trial showed that a single ad ministration of efgartigimod reduced IgG levels 
up to 50%, while multiple dosing further lowe red IgGs up to approximately 70%. IgG levels 
returned to baseline approximately [ADDRESS_241025] administration of efgartigimod. IV 
administration of efgartigimod at single doses up to 25 mg/kg and multiple doses of 10 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg were safe and well tolerated.  
Based on an optimal PD effect combined with minimal number of observed adverse events 
(AEs) (compared to the 25 mg/kg dose level), the dose of 10 mg/kg once weekly for [ADDRESS_241026] favorable risk-benefit profile and was therefore selected for further testing in the phase 2 trial. The outcome of the phase 2 trial indicated the efficacy and safety of 10 mg/kg in 4 weekly infusions in gMG patients

argenx Confidential 39 ARGX-113-1602 was a randomized, double-blind, plac ebo-controlled, multicenter phase 2 trial 
to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and PK of ef gartigimod for the treatment of autoimmune MG 
patients with generalized muscle weakness. Eligible patients (24 in total) were randomized at a 
1:1 ratio to receive efgartigimod (10 mg/kg) or pl acebo in [ADDRESS_241027] of care (SoC). The clinical effect of efgartigimod was explored in this trial using validated efficacy scales commonly used in MG clinical research and practice: Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL), Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis 
(QMG), MGC, and MGQoL15r. The efficacy data of the 4 scales consistently point in the same 
direction and show a rapid onset of action, a nd a relevant and long-lasting clinical improvement 
over placebo. More specifically, on the MG-ADL  scale, 75% of the patients treated with 
efgartigimod had a sustained clinically relevant reduction in total MG-ADL scores (defined as a 
reduction of at least 2 points from baseline) for a period of at least 6 consecutive weeks (starting 
at the latest [ADDRESS_241028] [IMP]) versus 25% of 
patients on placebo (difference was found to be statistically significant). Furthermore, this 
clinical improvement observed in all scales was consistent with the observed PD data, namely a reduction of total IgG and subtypes and a decreased level of AChR autoantibodies. 
The proposed phase 3 trial aims to establish the safety and tolerability of efgartigimod in 
class II-IVb gMG patients, and thereby [CONTACT_202027] a 
therapeutic treatment modality in this indication. 
This trial will be performed in complian ce with the protocol, International Council for 
Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), Declaration of Helsinki, and other applicable 
regulatory requirements. 
1.3. Standard of Care and Rationale for the Use of Efgartigimod 
Several drugs and medical procedures are routinely used in the management of gMG. 
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors are freque ntly used in treating MG, particularly in the 
mild forms of the disease. These agents include drugs such as pyridostigmine, neostigmine, and 
edrophonium, and their effectivene ss varies widely. These drugs act by [CONTACT_202028], which is responsible for the degradation of acetylcholine. This prolongs acetylcholine 
exposure, which leads to an amelioration of the signs/symptoms of MG. AChE inhibitors provide 
a symptomatic treatment of MG and do not act on the disease's underlying pathogenic 
mechanism. AChE inhibitors are not efficacious  in all patients with MG and can have a short 
duration of action, necessitating dosing several times daily. 
Corticosteroids and non-steroidal immunosuppressive drugs (NSIDs) are also used in the 
treatment of MG. These drugs are frequently used in the more advanced stage of the disease. 
Corticosteroids and NSIDs are typi[INVESTIGATOR_201989]. Because of 
their multiple side effects, the lowest effective dose of corticosteroids is recommended for long-term treatment that is often indicated for chronic conditions such as MG. NSIDs are commonly used and include azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, and cyclophosphamide. 
The use of corticosteroids and NSIDs however is  associated with dose-dependent, frequent and 
often serious side effects whose management requires to lower the dose and to use these drugs in various combinations to find the right balance between efficacy and side effects.

ARGX-113-1705 
 
argenx Confidential 40 Apart from the SoC described a bove, new biologic agents such as rituximab and eculizumab are 
also used to treat specific cases of MG, such as resistant and refractory forms. However, the use 
of these drugs is also associated with serious  and sometimes life-threatening side effects.11,12  
Exacerbations of MG are treated using either therapeutic plasma exchange (PLEX), 
immunoadsorption or IVIg. In the case of PLEX, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 1 exchange, removing 1 to 2 plasma 
volumes, is done every other day up to a total of 4 to 6 times, to improve muscle strength or 
ameliorate a myasthenic crisis. Unfortunately, this treatment is invasive and has frequent side 
effects such as hypotension, paresthesia, infections, and thrombotic complications. IVIg is widely used for patients with exacerbating MG . The mechanism of action of IVIg in MG is still 
unclear and may include interference with autoantibodies, B-cell modulation, saturation of FcRn 
and complement.
13,14 In addition, the use of IVIg is burdensome for the patient. 
These approaches however are not always availabl e in all clinical centers since they require 
specific facilities and instrumentation.2,3 
Finally, in selected cases, surgical removal of the thymus gland is also used to ameliorate the 
clinical manifestations of MG. However, thymectomy is not always effective in all patients and is associated with surgery-specific risks.
2,3,15,16 
Following administration of efgartigimod (10 mg/kg)  in 4 infusions administered 1 week apart in 
addition to SoC in patients with autoimmune MG  with generalized muscle weakness in the phase 
2 trial (ARGX-113-1602, also see Section 1.2), overall efgartigimod was well tolerated and 
demonstrated a good safety profile consistent with  phase 1 data. No serious or severe AEs were 
reported. The following events were reported as related to efgartigimod administration: 
rhinorrhea, gingivitis, headache, nausea, pruritus, paresthesia, myalgia, lymphocyte count 
decreased, monocyte count decreased, neutrophi l count decreased, contusion, feeling hot, 
infusion site pain and pruritus, and herpes zoster. All these events were reported as mild, except 
the herpes zoster, which was considered as moderate and occurred in a patient concomitantly 
treated with a systemic corticosteroid and NSID. Ef gartigimod demonstrated a relevant and long-
lasting improvement over placebo of the clinical manifestations of MG as measured by [CONTACT_21129] 4 
clinical efficacy MG scales, which reached statistical significance at specific timepoints on the 
MG-ADL, QMG, and MGQoL15r scales. Pharmac okinetic, PD, and immunogenicity profiles 
were consistent with phase 1 data. In addition, a potent and long-lasting reduction of AChR 
autoantibodies was observed. 
Myasthenia gravis is considered a highly autoantibody driven disease. Efgartigimod is a highly 
targeted therapy postulated to result in reduced  autoantibody levels. Results from the phase 2 
trial indicate that it induces a strong and long-lasting improvement of the disease as measured by 
[CONTACT_202029] a favorable safety profile. Furthermore, this clinical 
improvement was consistent with the observed PD data, namely a reduction of total IgG and subtypes and a decreased level of AChR autoanti bodies. Therefore, efgartigimod is believed to 
be a promising treatment to reduce autoantibodies in gMG patients.

Clinical Trial Protocol Version 4.0, Final  [ADDRESS_241029] of efgartigimod was explored us ing clinical activity tools commonly used in 
MG clinical research and practice: total MG-ADL, QMG, MGC, and MG-QoL15r scores. A 
mean total score change from baseline in  total MG-ADL, QMG, MGC, and MG-QoL15r scores 
was observed as early as day 8 in patients treated with efgartigimod. A long-lasting reduction in 
total MG-ADL and MGC scores was observed, with  the reduction in total scores still seen at 
day 78 (end of study [EoS]). Efgartigimod showed  a statistically significant reduction in total 
MG-ADL, QMG, and MG-QoL15r scores compared with placebo at specific time points, 
indicating a clinical improvement in efgartigimod treatment over placebo. For all MG scales, a 
greater maximum mean change from baseline  (reduction) was observed in the efgartigimod 
treatment group compared with placebo. 
Eligible participants of trial ARGX-113-1704 will be  offered the option to roll over to this 
follow-on trial where (re- )treatment of efgartigimod can be done on an “as needed basis ,” which 
is a substantial benefit for the patient. 
Patients who have completed at least [ADDRESS_241030] arisen in the on going and completed trials, nor any pattern of AEs 
which would raise concerns or alter the poten tial benefit-risk profile of efgartigimod.  
In the phase 3 trials in patients with gMG, the majority of TEAEs were reported as mild (grade

All therapeutic proteins have the potential to el icit immune responses, potentially resulting in 
hypersensitivity or allergic reactions. As with any IV injection, the potential exists for infusion-

No clinically significant changes in vital signs and/or electrocardiogram (ECG) findings have been observed in clinical trials to date.  
Safety for use during pregnancy has not been established. Therefore, efgartigimod should not be 
administered to pregnant or lactating women. 
In summary, efgartigimod has been well to lerated in clinical trials conducted to date. 
Please refer to the current investigator’s brochur e (IB) for a full safety and efficacy summary.  
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Boa rd (DSMB) is responsible for ongoing safety 
monitoring during the trial and will meet on a regular basis (see Section  7.2.6). 
Considering the efficacy and safety data collected up to date and the design of the trial that has 
appropriate measures to ensure safe trial partic ipation, which minimizes the risk to patients 
participating in this trial, the potential risks identified in association with efgartigimod are justified by [CONTACT_202031].

DESCRIPTION 
This is a 3-year (maximum), single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase 3 follow-on trial of 
ARGX-113-1704 to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of efgartigimod in patients 
with gMG. The trial consists of 2 parts: Part A (1 year) and Part B (up to maximum [ADDRESS_241034]. The a dditional part (Part B) was added to ARGX-113-
[ADDRESS_241035] access to efgartigimod while it is not yet commercially available or available through another patient program. This extension will 
also enable additional long-term safety and tolerability data to be collected. 
A variable number of treatment periods consisting of 4 weekly infusions of efgartigimod 
(10 mg/kg of body weight) infused over a period of 3 weeks will be administered to eligible 
patients on an “as needed basis” on t op of their SoC. The time between treatment periods is 
based on the duration of the treatment effect and may vary from patient to patient and within 
each patient from period to period (patient-tailored approach).

discontinuation (ED) visit assessments specified in Table 2. The previous efgartigimod IV dose 
must have been received at least 30 days before entry into ARGX-113-2002. 
Patients can enroll in ARGX-113- 2002 until recruitment for this study is closed. Patients who 
enroll in ARGX-113-2002 will not return to ARGX-113-1705. 
(RE-)TREATMENT (Part A) 
Each patient will start a (new) treatment peri od with efgartigimod when all of the following 
criteria are met:  
x The patient has completed the previous treatment period (ie, after visit 4) 
x The patient has a total MG- ADL score of ≥5 points with more than 50% of the total 
score due to non-ocular symptoms 
x The patient has a reduction in the total MG-ADL score of <2 points compared to the 
score at:

treatment period (TP 1) in trial ARGX-113-[ADDRESS_241040] treatment period Baseline (TP nB) for all subsequent treatment periods 
(TP n+1) in trial ARGX-113-1705 
However, patients may not receive (re-)treatment with efgartigimod if, at the time of (re-)treatment, they have clinical evidence of bacterial, viral or fungal disease, or any other 
significant disease which could confound the resu lts of the trial or put patients at undue risk. 
Patients who require an additional treatment but w ho are not eligible to receive (re-)treatment for 
the reasons listed here will remain in the tria l to receive appropriate alternative MG treatment 
(see Appendix 5 and Appendix 6).  
Patients who have a treatment failure to efgartig imod for [ADDRESS_241041] 50% of the assessments 
(ie, TP nV2, TP nV3, TP nV4, and the first posttreatment period visit).  
If a patient becomes eligible for (re-)treatment with efgartigimod by [CONTACT_202034]-ADL score as stated in Section 4.1, but cannot complete the entire treatment period 
during Part A (ie, after day 336) then the patient can be transitioned to Part B after completing 
the end of Part A (EoA) visit assessments ( Table 1 ). These assessments should be completed 
even if the patient is unwilling or unable to continue to Part B. 
The transition to Part B can be either at ITPE 0Vn or TPE 1V1, depending on the patient status 
regarding the need for (re-)treatment upon transition from Part A. The first visit in Part B will

PLEX, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), immunoadsorption or use of a new type of 
corticosteroid or an increased dose of the current corticosteroids used as stand-alone therapy or in combination is also allowed in Part B. 
TIME BETWEEN TREATMENT PERIODS 
At the end of each treatment period, patients will enter a variable intertreatment period during 
which they will be treated with their SoC only.  The length of the intertreatment period may vary 
from patient to patient and for each patient from period to period (patient-tailored approach). For 
Part A, the visit frequency in the Intertreatment period is every 30 days (± 2 days) after the previous visit. For Part B, the visit frequency in  the intertreatment period is every 90 days (± 7 
days) after the previous visit. If an ITP visit for  Part A is scheduled within 14 days of the EoA 
visit, then the EoA visit should be performed instead. 
RESCUE THERAPY (Part A only) 
Rescue therapy will be limited to PLEX, IVI g, immunoadsorption or use of a new type of 
corticosteroid or an increased dose of the current corticosteroids used as stand-alone therapy or 
in combination. Rescue therapy is permitted fo r patients experiencing protocol-defined MG 
clinical deterioration AND if in addition the treati ng physician believes that the patient’s health 
is in jeopardy if rescue therapy is not given. An MG clinical deterioration permitting rescue therapy to be given is defined as a patient expe riencing at least 1 of the following: (1) new or 
worsening of respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] / bulbar symptoms or (2) at least 2-point increase of individual non-ocular MG-ADL items. Whenever possible, prior to giving rescue therapy to a patient, the Medical Director at the sponsor and the Medical Monitor at the sponsor’s designated contract 
research organization (CRO) should be informed. 
In situations where the treatments as listed above are given under the protocol-defined
 rescue 
criteria, patients will be discontinued early from the trial. 
EARLY DISCONTINUATION  
For patients who discontinue early from trial, the assessments will depend on the visit at which it 
was decided that the patient had to discontinue (see Section 5.4, Figure 1,  and Figure 2 ). 
Patients who discontinue early from the tria l within a treatment period should perform the 
planned assessments of the corresponding treatment period visit. These patients will not receive any further administration of efgartigimod durin g the trial and will return for the ED visit 1 
month (30 ± 2 days) after the last dose administra tion. An unscheduled visit can be organized if 
deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093]. 
Patients who discontinue early from the trial between the last visit of a treatment period (TP

or TPE nV4) and the next intertreatment period visit (ITP nVn or ITPE nVn) should perform the ED 
assessments 1 month (30 ± 2 days) after the last dose administration.

4.2. Discussion of Trial Design 
In the current trial, efgartigimod will be admi nistered in patients with gMG, with the aim to 
evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of efgartigimod.  This trial is designed as a 3-year (maximum), single-arm, open-label, follow-on trial of 
ARGX-113-1704. The trial consists of 2 parts: Part A (1 year) and Part B (up to maximum

Clinical Trial Protocol Version 4.0, Final  [ADDRESS_241047] visit of Part A for each patient. 
Efgartigimod will be administered to eligible patients on an “as needed basis” on top of their 
SoC in treatment periods. This SoC serves as a rational therapeutic approach for IgG-mediated 
immune diseases such as MG by [CONTACT_202036]-IgG interaction and alleviating autoimmune disease symptoms by [CONTACT_28423][INVESTIGATOR_201990]. The time between treatment 
periods is based on the duration of the treatment ef fect and may vary from patient to patient and 
within each patient from period to  period (patient-tailored approach). 
In Part A, a change of the type or dose/regimen of SoC (replacing, adding or removing SoC, or adjustment of the SoC dose and/or frequency) is not allowed from trial entry until [ADDRESS_241048] infusion of the next treatment 
period, a dose reduction in SoC consistent with  current medical practice is allowed. 
In Part B, a change of the type or dose/regimen of SoC (replacing, adding or removing SoC, or 
adjustment of the SoC dose and/or frequency) is allowed without restrictions, following current 
medical practice. 
PLEX, IVIg, immunoadsorption or use of a new type of corticosteroid or an increased dose of 
the current corticosteroids used as stand-alone ther apy or in combination is also allowed in Part 
B. 
The chosen primary and secondary endpoints in this  trial are to evaluate the long-term safety and 
tolerability of efgartigimod over the duration of the trial, as well as by [CONTACT_5265], in AChR-Ab 
seropositive patients and in the overall population (AChR-Ab seropositive and seronegative patients). 
Both MG AChR-Ab seropositive as well as MG AC hR-Ab seronegative patients will be included 
in the trial. AChR-Ab seronegati ve patients are patients in which AChR-Ab cannot be detected 
in serum using routine laboratory methods. However, there is evidence that in these seronegative 
patients, MG is also driven by [CONTACT_202037], such as MuSK, LRP4 or by 
[CONTACT_202038]. In addition, in other cases, the absence of AChR-Ab may be due to the insufficient sensitivity of the 
routine assays which are unable to detect low affinity autoantibodies. Therefore, given the 
mechanism of action of efgartigimod and the Ig G pathogenesis of MG in most of the so-called 
seronegative patients, there is reason to believe that, similarly to the AChR-Ab seropositive

argenx Confidential 51 patients, AChR-Ab seronegative pati ents will also benefit from tr eatment with efgartigimod. The 
dose regimen selected for this trial is the same as in trial ARGX-113-1704.  
The choice of the dose/regimen of efgartigimod (4 weekly infusions of 10 mg/kg) was made 
because, as observed in a phase 1 trial in human volunteers, it causes a marked and long-lasting 
decrease of IgG level believed to be related to efficacy with only few mild AEs. In the same trial, 
higher doses did not result in significant further reductions of IgG while, at the same time, the number of subjects experiencing efgartigimod-rel ated AEs increased. On the other hand, a lower 
dose of 2 mg/kg resulted in substantially less reduction of IgG concentrations (2.3-fold difference in maximum IgG decrease). As suggested by [CONTACT_36532]/PD modeling, lower doses (eg, 5 mg/kg) will result in a less marked decrease of the IgG level and therefore may result in a 
less pronounced therapeutic effect. In addition, in a phase 2 trial (ARGX-113-1602) in patients 
with gMG, the dose/regimen chosen for the current trial induced a clinically meaningful improvement on the MG-ADL and QMG scales and, at  the same time, confirming the acceptable 
safety profile of the drug. Therefore, the dose of 10 mg/kg of efgartigimod administered weekly for [ADDRESS_241049] benefit/risk ratio and was selected for future trials.  
All safety and disease severity assessments used  in this trial are standard, ie, widely used and 
generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant.

Safety of Efgartigimod: Mechanism of Action , Pharmacodynamics and Risk/Benefit in  
Patient Safety 
Efgartigimod administration results in a targe ted reduction in levels of all IgG subtypes. 
However, and more importantly, it does not impact levels of other immunoglobulin isotypes, 
such as IgA and IgM. Other elements of the immune system are not impacted by [CONTACT_202040]. 
Efgartigimod induces a targeted reduction of Ig G levels, without impacting IgG production. The 
maximum mean reduction in total IgG is approximately 70%; therefore, residual IgG and other 
immunoglobulin levels remain consta nt during treatment. It is therefore anticipated that patients 
can mount an immune response. In support of this, experiments in FcRn knockout animals and in 
animals treated with FcRn antagonist demonstrated that a specific immune response was 
obtained following an antigen trigger, albeit with reduced (antigen-specific) IgG titers. Additionally, after ceasing efga rtigimod treatment, IgG recycling returns and total IgG levels 
increase and return to baseline levels within a few weeks. 
Looking at administration in humans, efgartigimod treatment at doses ≥10 mg/kg have been 
administered to more than 120 healthy volunteers  and patients with generalized myasthenia

Early discontinuation from the trial is defined as  the permanent cessation of further participation 
in the trial prior to its planned completion.  
Patients must  be discontinued early from the trial if: 
x They withdraw their consent. 
x The investigator, after discussion with the sponsor’s Medical Director, deems it is in 
the patient’s best interest.  
x Patient is pregnant. 
x Patient receives rescue therapy (Part A only). 
x Patient develops an SAE that is likely to re sult in a life-threatening situation or pose a 
serious safety risk to the patient. 
x Prohibited medication is taken (Part A only) (see Section 6.8.1). 
Patients might discontinue early from the trial if: 
x Patient has clinical evidence of bacterial,  viral or fungal disease or any other 
significant disease which could confound the results of the trial or put the patient at 
undue risk. In this situation, decision on whether or not to discontinue patients early from trial will depend on the evaluation on a case-by-case basis. Patients who, after evaluation of the above situations are not discontinued from the trial, may have a 
temporary interruption from trial treatment (see Section 4.4.1). 
For patients who discontinue early from trial, th e assessments will depend on the visit at which it 
was decided that the patient had to discontinue (see Section 5.4, Figure 1,  and Figure 2).   
Patients who discontinue early from the tria l within a treatment period should perform the

Every effort should be made to ensure that th e protocol-required tests and procedures are 
completed as described. When a protocol-r equired procedure cannot be performed, the 
investigator will document the reason and any corrective and preventive actions that he/she has 
taken to ensure that the normal processes are adhered to in source documents. The trial team 
should be informed of these incidents in a timely manner. 
Patients should be seen for all visits on the de signated days or as closely as possible to the 
original planned visit schedule. There is a permissible window of ±1 day for treatment period 
visits (visit 1 to visit 4), of ±2 days for ITP nVn (Part A), and of ±7 days for the ITPE nVn 
(Part B), EoA visit (day 365) and the EoS visit (day [ADDRESS_241075]). Every effort should be made to schedule every visit on the exact day (which is 
relative to the baseline visit [SEB, TP nB or TPE nB]) within the window as described in the 
General Schedule of Assessments for Part A ( Table 1 ) and for Part B ( Table 2). 
Each treatment period consists of [ADDRESS_241076] trial visit, while the baseline of each subsequent treatment period 
(TP nB or TPE nB) will be set at visit [ADDRESS_241077], before any other trial-
specific assessments, with the only excepti on of obtaining informed consent at SEB and the 
weight assessment. The MG-ADL scale needs to be performed prior to the QMG scale (Part A) 
as per Table 1. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors must be halted for at least 12 hours before the 
QMG assessment (Part A). 
As from signature [CONTACT_202096], all AEs that occur and all 
concomitant medications, whether allowed or not, that are taken during the trial are to be recorded on the appropriate pages in the electronic case report form (eCRF). 
5.1. Informed Consent and Roll-Over Visit 
The roll-over visit (SEB) can be either ITP 0V1 or TP 1V1, depending on the patient status 
regarding the need for (re-)treatment upon roll-over from trial ARGX-113-1704. The first visit in trial ARGX-113-[ADDRESS_241078] sign the informed consent form (ICF) prior to any trial-related assessment. The assessments done for the last visit in trial ARGX-113-1704 should not be repeated. 
Prior to signing the ICF, trial patients will be instructed not to participate in any other clinical 
trial that involves an intervention or collection of  data until the completion of the current trial. 
After informed consent has been obtained, partic ipants of trial ARGX-113-1704 will be screened 
at the site for eligibility to roll over to this trial based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria defined in Sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2, respectively.

AND if in addition the treating physician believes th at the patient’s health is in jeopardy if rescue 
therapy is not given. An MG clinical deterioration permitting rescue therapy to be given is 
defined as a patient experiencing at least 1 of th e following: (1) new or worsening of respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] / 
bulbar symptoms or (2) at least 2-point increase of individual non-ocular MG-ADL items. 
Rescue therapy will be limited to PLEX, IVI g, immunoadsorption or use of a new type of 
corticosteroid or an increased dose of the current corticosteroids used as stand-alone therapy or 
in combination. The type of rescue therapy used should be documented. 
In case a patient needs rescue therapy according to the treating investigator, the Medical Director 
at the sponsor should be informed in addition to the Medical Monitor at the sponsor’s designated 
CRO; whenever possible prior to actual implementation of the rescue therapy. 
In situations where the treatments as listed above are given under the protocol-defined  rescue 
criteria, patients will be discontinued early from the trial. 
6.9. Medical Care of Patients After End of Study 
After a patient has completed the trial, or has w ithdrawn/discontinued early, usual treatment will 
be administered, if required, in accordance with the trial site’s SoC and generally accepted 
medical practice depending on the patient’s indi vidual needs. The sponsor will not provide any 
additional care to these patients.  
6.10. Treatment Compliance 
The investigator should promote treatment compliance by [CONTACT_202050]’s safety and the validity of the trial. The prescribed dose, timing, and mode of administration may not be changed. All dates and start and end time of efgartigimod administration and any deviations from the intended regimen must be recorded.

Patients in need for (re-)treatment will receive 4 weekly IV infusions of efgartigimod at a dose of 
10 mg/kg over a period of 1 hour during each Treatment Period, provided they are eligible. 
All efforts will be done to ensure that the patient receives the 4 administrations of efgartigimod 
within the allowed time windows. However, if a pa tient misses 1 or more doses in any Treatment 
Period, the patient will not be discontinued from th e trial or from further trial treatment and will 
complete all further visits and assessments acc ording to the General Schedule of Assessments for 
Part A ( Table 1 ) and for Part B ( Table 2). This patient may be eligible for further Treatment 
Periods during the trial. 
In case a dose needs to be delayed for more than [ADDRESS_241094]

manual (pharmacy manual). 
6.13. Storage of Blood Samples in the Trial 
Any remaining samples after the analysis per prot ocol has been completed may be stored for up 
to 15 years for future additional research to  address any scientific questions related to 
efgartigimod or MG, unless this would not be allowed according to local regulations or the patient would not agree.

argenx Confidential 76 7. TRIAL ASSESSMENTS 
7.1. Monitoring of Disease Severity 
Monitoring of disease severity will be assessed using MG-ADL (Part A and B) and QMG 
(Part A only). The assessments, where applicable, have to be performed predose on all efgartigimod infusion days and prior to any ot her assessment at each visit, except for the 
assessment of weight (if applicable) and signing of the ICF at SEB. The MG-ADL scale needs to 
be performed prior to th e QMG scale in Part A ( Table 1 ). 
Monitoring of disease severity for a given patient is preferentially assessed, whenever possible, by 1 and the same trained evaluator throughout the course of the trial. 
7.1.1. Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living 
The MG-ADL is an 8-item patient-reported scale ( Appendix 1)  to assess MG symptoms and their 
effects on daily activities. It evaluates the capacity to perform different activities of daily living 
such as talking, chewing, swallowing, breathing, brushing the teeth/combing the hair, or rising 
from a chair and it also assesses double vision and eyelid droop. It is a discrete quantitative variable in which the 8 items are rated from 0 to 3 and the total score can point from 0 to 24, 
with higher total scores indicating more impairment. The assessments to be performed using 
MG-ADL ( Appendix 1)  do not require any equipment to a ssess MG symptoms and their effects 
on daily activities. The scoring of MG-ADL should be performed by a trained and certified evaluator. 
7.1.2. Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis 
The QMG quantifies disease severity based on impairments of body functions and structures as 
defined by [CONTACT_202051], Disability and Health.
18  
The QMG consists of 13 items ( Appendix 2) that assess ocular, bulba r, and limb function. Out of 
the 13 items, 6 are timed tests of endurance measured in seconds. Each item has a possible score 
from 0-3. The total possible score is 39, wher e higher total scores indicate more severe 
impairments. It is based on quantitative testing of specific muscle groups to assess limb function. 
It requires minimal equipment such as spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007] , mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_201993], nose clips, 
stopwatch, cups and water for swallowing tests , goniometer, dynamometer , and is based on the 
trained rater’s examination. The scoring of QMG should be performed by a trained evaluator.  
7.2. Safety 
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all AEs, pregnancies, suicidality 
assessment (Part A only), safety laboratory testing, measurement of vital signs, ECGs, physical 
examinations; and other tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the trial in all 
patients who receive at least 1 dose of efgartigimod. As discussed in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , any 
pregnancy that occurs while a patient is enrolled into the trial will also be monitored and reported according to the appropriate regulations. 
The DSMB will evaluate the safety data periodically (see Section 7.2.6).

Clinical Trial Protocol Version 4.0, Final  [ADDRESS_241095] of the patient. 
Definition of AE: An AE is any untoward medica l occurrence in a clinical trial patient whether 
or not a pharmaceutical product is administered, and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal product or efgartigimod, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or efgartigimod. 
An AE can also be a new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition), if considered clinically relevant by [CONTACT_1275]. 
Abnormal laboratory values, or test results, physical examination findings, and other abnormal 
investigational findings (ie, ECG) should not be reported as AEs unless they are considered clinically significant, eg, require therapy (eg, hematologic abnormality that requires transfusion or hematological stem cell support) or le ad to treatment discontinuation. 
Death is not considered an AE but an outcome. 
MG disease worsening, if considered clinically relevant by [CONTACT_093], can be reported as 
AE, provided that it is supported by a clinically relevant change in total MG-ADL score (as 
compared to SEB). The investigator should contact [CONTACT_202052]. 
Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR): Any untoward and unintended response in a patient to 
efgartigimod, which is related to any dose administered to that patient. 
Definition of Serious AE (SAE): An SAE, ex perience or reaction, is any untoward medical 
occurrence (whether considered to be related to efgartigimod or not) that at any dose: 
x Results in death 
x Is life-threatening (the patient is at a risk of death at the time of the event; it does not 
refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe) 
x Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
However, a planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_201994] 
(Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2144]/or surgical opera tions planned before a trial are not 
considered SAEs or if the illness or disease, which caused hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], existed 
before the patient was enrolled in the trial,  provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected way during the trial. However, the condition for which the surgery is required may be an AE.) 
x Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, OR 
x Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect

argenx Confidential 78 x Other: Medically significant events, which do not meet any of the criteria above, but 
may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above. Examples of such events are blood dyscrasias (eg, neutropenia or anemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_201995] (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) and Unexpected Adverse 
Reactions: Any suspected adverse reaction that is  serious, unexpected, and considered to be 
related to drug exposure is defined as a S[LOCATION_003]R. 
An unexpected AE is any adverse drug event, which is not listed in the current IB or is not listed 
at the specificity or intensity that has been observed. 
Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE. 
An untoward and unintended post-dosing response to a non-trial drug is, by [CONTACT_108], not a 
S[LOCATION_003]R, but is, however, an AE. 
Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, se verity, seriousness and causal relationship to 
efgartigimod or trial procedures. The action taken with the investigational drug and the outcome 
of the event must also be recorded. Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE): Any AE temporally associated with the use of 
efgartigimod, whether considered related to ef gartigimod or not. TEAEs are recorded from the 
start of efgartigimod administration, until completion of the patient’s last visit.  
Overdose 
For the purposes of this trial, exceeding the dosage requirements specified in this protocol (see 
Section 6.1) represents an overdose. In case of suspected overdose, the patient should be treated 
according to standard medical practice based on the investigator’s judgment.  
Severity 
All AEs observed will be graded using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. The NCI-CTCAE is a descriptive terminology, which can be utilized for AE reporting. A grading (severity) scale is 
provided for each AE term. Grade refers to the severi ty of the AE. If a particular AE’s severity is 
not specifically graded by [CONTACT_43970], the investigator is to use the general NCI-
CTCAE definitions of Grade [ADDRESS_241096] medical judgment. The 
CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE 
based on the following general guideline: 
x Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated. 
x Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or non-i nvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age--appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL). 
x Grade 3: Severe or medically significan t but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self-care ADL.

argenx Confidential 79 x Grade 4: Life-threatening consequenc es; urgent intervention indicated. 
x Grade 5: Death related to AE. 
Relationship 
The causal relationship between efgartigimod/trial procedures and the AE has to be characterized 
as unrelated, unlikely, related, possible, and probable. 
x Events can be classified as “unrelated” if there is not a reasonable possibility that 
efgartigimod caused the AE. 
x An “unlikely” relationship suggests that only a remote connection exists between 
efgartigimod and the reported AE. Other conditions, including chronic illness, 
progression or expression of the disease stat e, or reaction to concomitant medication, 
appear to explain the reported AE. 
x A “related” relationship suggests that the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of efgartigimod, it fo llows a known or expected response pattern 
to efgartigimod and it cannot reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_202053]’s clinical state.  
x A “possible” relationship suggests that the association of the AE with efgartigimod is 
unknown; however, the AE is not reasonably supported by [CONTACT_145037]. 
x A “probable” relationship suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of the AE with drug administration exists and, in the investigator’s clinical judgment, it is likely 
that a causal relationship exists between the drug administration and the AE, and 
other conditions (concurrent illness, progre ssion or expression of disease state, or 
concomitant medication reactions) do not appear to explain the AE. 
In final evaluation for reporting, the relationship will be converted into “Binary Determination” 
as per Council for International Organizati ons of Medical Sciences (CIOMS). Unrelated and 
Unlikely will be clubbed into “Unrelated” and Related, Possible and Probable will be clubbed 
into “Related” for final reporti ng purpose. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events of Special Interest 
An AESI (serious or non-serious, related or not related) is an event of scientific and medical 
concern specific to the sponsor’s product or program.  
Efgartigimod treatment induces reductions in IgG levels, and there is a potential risk for 
infections associated with the low IgG levels. As such, any infection will be considered AESI in this trial. Further characterizing information will be collected in the eCRF, such as: location of 
infection, relationship to underlying condition, medical history and concomitant medication, reoccurrence of previous infection, previous resc ue therapy, any confirmatory procedure, culture 
or urgent medical intervention.

stop date (when applicable), stop time (when applicable), severity, ac tion taken, outcome, and 
relationship to efgartigimod, and to trial procedures . Each event should be recorded separately in 
the eCRF. 
All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_202054]: “ Have you had any health problems since th e previous visit or since you were 
last asked?,” or revealed by [CONTACT_178557]. When 
collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of 
signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms 
that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 
Any SAE, including death due to any cause, whic h occurs during this trial after signature [CONTACT_170817], whether or not related to efgartigimod, must be reported immediately (within 24 hours of 
the trial site’s knowle dge of the event). All SAEs will be recorded (within 24 hours) on the paper 
SAE Report Form and the AE form in the eCRF, the investigator or delegated site staff should check that all entered data are consistent. An alert email for the SAE report in the eCRF will then automatically be sent by [CONTACT_109356]’s designated CRO safety mailbox via the electronic 
data capture (EDC) system. The paper SAE Report Form should be faxed or emailed to the sponsor’s designated CRO (see the Safety Mailbox/Fax  details on the title page of this protocol). 
The report will contain as much available information concerning the SAE to enable the sponsor 
(or an authorized representative) to file a report, which satisfies regulatory reporting 
requirements. These timelines apply to initial reports of SAEs and to all follow-up reports. 
Criteria for documenting the relationship to efga rtigimod, as well as severity, outcome, and 
action taken will be the same as those previously described. 
The investigator shall report within 24 hours an y SAE (s)he becomes aware of after a patient’s 
last visit if a causal relationship with the investigational product is suspected. Such a serious 
adverse reaction (SAR) is to be collected and reported as previously described for SAEs. 
All SAEs that are spontaneously reported within [ADDRESS_241097] trial visit are to be 
collected and reported as previously described and all efforts should be made to follow-up until resolution. 
Additional follow-up information should be comple ted and entered on a paper SAE Report Form

Events (AOSE), and any other applicable reports to regulatory authorities, ethics committees, 
and investigators, in accordance with national regulations in the countries where the trial is 
conducted. Relative to the first awareness of the event by/or further provision to the sponsor’s 
designee, S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be submitted within 7 days for fatal and life-threatening events and 
15 days for other S[LOCATION_003]Rs, un less otherwise required by [CONTACT_2091]. The sponsor’s 
designee will also prepare an expedited repo rt for other safety issues where applicable.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Follow-up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
Any AEs observed from signing the ICF to the last study visit will be followed up to resolution, 
until the patient is lost to follow-up, or until the patient withdraws consent. Resolution means that the patient has returned to a baseline state of health or the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the AE. 
Every effort should be made to follow all (S)AEs considered to be related to efgartigimod or trial 
procedures until an outcome can be reported. If the patient is lost to follow-up, all AEs will be 
categorized based on the investigator’s last assessment.  
All SAEs that are spontaneously reported after the last study visit are to be collected and reported as previously described (as per Section [IP_ADDRESS]) and will be followed up. During the trial period, 
resolution of SAEs (with dates) should be documented on the SAE page of the eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilitate s ource data verification. If, after follow -up, return to the 
baseline status or stabilization cannot be establis hed, an explanation should be recorded on the 
SAE page of the eCRF. 
All pregnancies reported during the trial should be followed until pregnancy outcome. 
For SAEs, non- serious AEs, and pregnancies, the sponsor’s designee may follow -up by 
[CONTACT_756], fax, electronic mail, and/or a monitori ng visit to obtain additional case details and 
outcome information (eg, from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8838], consultant reports, or autopsy

If a patient becomes pregnant after  the administration of efgartigimod  and up to [ADDRESS_241099] infusion, the sponsor and/or sponsor’s designee should be informed 
immediately (ie, within 24 hours of the trial site’s knowledge of the event). The following actions will be performed: 
x The patient should immediately be discontinued from trial treatment. 
x The patient should have the planned ED assessments.  
x All planned assessments (see Sections 4.4 and 5.4 ) must be performed unless 
contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] (harmful to fetus) or unless the patient withdraws informed consent.

If the outcome of the pregnancy is an SAE, then this must be additionally reported as an SAE on 
the appropriate SAE Report Form. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Pregnancies in Female Partners of Male Patients 
Male patients will be instructed through the ICF to immediately inform the investigator if their 
partner becomes pregnant during the trial or up to [ADDRESS_241100] infusion of 
efgartigimod. A Pregnancy Report Form should be completed by [CONTACT_19452] 24 hours 
after learning of the pregnancy and submitted via email or fax (see the Safety Mailbox/Fax 
details on the title page of this protocol). Attempts  should be made to collect and report details of 
the course and outcome of any pregnancy in the partner of a male patient exposed to efgartigimod. 
The pregnant partner will need to sign an ICF to allow for follow-up on her pregnancy. Once the 
ICF has been signed, the investigator will update the Pregnancy Report Form with additional 
information on the course and outcome of the pregnancy. An investigator who is contact[CONTACT_202055], to support an informed decision in cooperation with the

urinalysis will be analyzed at a central laboratory. PD and ADA will be analyzed at a specialty 
laboratory as indicated in the Genera l Schedule of Assessments for Part A ( Table 1 ) and 
Appendix 3. Patients need to be fasting for at least 8 hours prior to the sampling for clinical laboratory tests as from SEB up to EoA.  
In Part B, blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry, hematology and urinalysis will be analyzed at local laboratories and results will not be recorded in the eCRF. 
Blood samples for ADA will be analyzed at a sp ecialty laboratory as indicated in the General 
Schedule of Assessments for Part B ( Table 2 ) and Appendix 3.  
Additional safety samples may be collected if clinically indicated at the discretion of the investigator. 
For all patients of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be conducted and analyzed 
locally at the site (on the urine samples taken for urin alysis, if applicable) at all visits in Part  A 
(Table 1 ) and at visit 1 and 4 of each Treatment Period, at ITPE visits, at EoS/ED and at the 
discretion of the investigator in Part B ( Table 2).

Clinical laboratory tests will be reviewed for results of potential clinical significance at all time points throughout the trial. The investigator will evaluate any change in laboratory values. If the 
investigator determines a laboratory abnormality to be  clinically significant, it will be considered 
as a laboratory AE; however, if the abnormal laboratory value is consistent with a current 
diagnosis, it may be documented accordingly without being reported as an AE.

7.2.6. Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
The sponsor will appoint a DSMB consisting of an independent group of clinical experts, who 
are not participating in the trial. They will be supplemented by [CONTACT_55467]. The 
objective of the DSMB will be to review all safety data (including the overall number of patients 
treated up to that point, rates, and patient-level details). Fixed meetings will be scheduled based 
on the recruitment rate into the trial, and inci dence of (S)AEs. In addition, ad hoc meetings can 
be requested at any time during the trial by [CONTACT_202057]. The DSMB will advise the sponsor concerning continuation, modifi cation or termination of the trial after every 
meeting. 
The composition, objectives, and role and respons ibilities of the independent DSMB will be 
described in a DSMB charter, agreed with the DSMB members and sponsor. The DSMB charter 
will also define and document the content of the safety summaries, and general procedures (including communications). 
7.2.7. Visit Reminder/Subject ID Card 
Patients must be provided with the address and telephone number of the main contact [CONTACT_202058]. The investigator must therefore provide a “Visit 
Reminder/Subject ID Card” to each patient. In an emergency situation this card serves to inform 
the responsible attending physician that the patient is in a clinical trial and that relevant 
information may be obtained by [CONTACT_202059]. Patients must be instructed to keep 
the card in their possession at all times. 
7.3. Pharmacodynamics 
In Part A, the PD markers (total IgG and IgG subtypes [IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4], and 
autoantibodies [anti-AChR antibodies for the AChR-Ab seropositive patients and anti-MuSK 
antibodies for the MuSK-Ab seropositive patients]) will be measured at the time points as

The patient has completed the previous Treatment 
Period (i.e., after Visit 4)*; AND 
The Investigator determines that the patient will benefit 
from re -treatment; AND 
There is at least 1 calendar month (minimum 4 weeks) 
between Treatment Periods (i.e., between TPE nV4 and 
TPE n+1V1). 
*A patient who has had a temporary interruption of 
trial treatment in Part  A may also continue into Part B 
of the trial and receive (re -)treatment if the conditions 
in Section 4.4.3 are met.  
However, patients may not receive (re -)treatment with 
ARGX -113 if, at the time of (re-)treatment, they have 
clinical evidence of bacterial, viral or fungal disease, or 
any other significant disease which could confound the results of the trial or put patients at undue risk.

Patients who discontinue early from the trial between 
the last visit of a Treatment Period (TP nV4 or TPE nV4) 
and the next Intertreatment Period visit (ITP nVn or

assessments, instead of the ITP nVn (Part A) or 
ITPE nVn (Part B) assessments. 
Patients who discontinue early from the trial after the 
ITP (Part A) or ITPE (Part B) visit should perform the ED assessments.
 
Any patient prematurely discontinuing the trial during 
Part A should perform the EoA/ED assessments according to the General Schedule of Assessments for

The risk/benefit, safety profile, guidance for site conduct in terms of visits and assessments, as 
well as data entry, and potential changes in th e Schedule of Assessments are included below. 
Safety of Efgartigimod: Mechanism of Action , Pharmacodynamics and Risk/Benefit in  
Patient Safety 
Efgartigimod administration results in a targe ted reduction in levels of all IgG subtypes. 
However, and more importantly, it does not impact levels of other immunoglobulin isotypes, 
such as IgA and IgM. Other elements of the immune system are not impacted by [CONTACT_202040]. 
Efgartigimod induces a targeted reduction of Ig G levels, without impacting IgG production. The 
maximum mean reduction in total IgG is approximately 70%; therefore, residual IgG and other 
immunoglobulin levels remain consta nt during treatment. It is therefore anticipated that patients 
can mount an immune response. In support of this, experiments in FcRn knockout animals and in 
animals treated with FcRn antagonist demonstrated that a specific immune response was 
obtained following an antigen trigger, albeit with reduced (antigen-specific) IgG titers. 
Additionally, after ceasing efga rtigimod treatment, IgG recycling returns and total IgG levels 
increase and return to baseline levels within a few weeks. 
Looking at administration in humans, efgartigimod treatment at doses ≥10 mg/kg have been 
administered to more than 120 healthy volunteers  and patients with generalized myasthenia 
gravis (gMG), immune thrombocytopenia, and pemphigus in studies carried out prior to phase [ADDRESS_241153] not identified any increased risk of 
infection. 
 
ADAPT/ADAPT+: Pre-existing Safety Measures  and Changes to Be Implemented in the 
Current Situation

Efgartigimod is administered in treatment cycles, in which 4-weekly infusions are followed by 
[CONTACT_202091]. Therefore, during the

The current COVID-19 situation warrants new measures to be introduced for patient safety. 
These measures will allow patients to be evaluated remotely if/when quarantine is imposed. For example, any remaining visits in an interrupted Treatment Period, may be performed remotely, in 
cases where the patient is not allowed or cannot physically visit the site. These measures respect 
both patient safety and local guidance, as well as  allowing basic safety data to be collected. 
The assessments identified for telephone assessment visits are highlighted with the use of bold 
italics in the existing Schedu le of Assessments for Part A in Table 1  and for Part B in Table 2. 
Guidance on the execution of these visits and assessments is given below. 
By [CONTACT_1541] a structured back-up plan, we aim to mitigate the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
while still respecting both patient safety and co llection of safety data and remaining compliant 
with GCP.

How to: Information related to study procedures and data collection 
The assessments deemed suitable for telephone consultation are: 
x Re-consenting where warranted, MG-ADL, Adverse Event and Concomitant 
Medication questioning.  
Since QMG needs quantification by [CONTACT_202044] n, using specific equipment, such as a 
dynamometer and spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007], this assessment is not deemed suitable for telephone assessment.  
Telephone consultation will allow safety data to be  collected and to check on the patient’s well -
being, while the derived MG-ADL score may give an indication of the need for another treatment 
with efgartigimod. 
Re-consenting with the updated ICF, or cons ent to Part B of the ADAPT+ study can be done 
remotely in view of the COVID-19 situation.  
Options for consent might entail: 
x physical signature [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_202045] a phone call 
with the patient, then having the signed document sent back to the site. 
x phone call with the patient, asking for email confirmation to corroborate verbal consent. 
x organize a conference call or video call tog ether with the patient and impartial 
witness, where needed. 
x if no phone call or video call is possible, email documented consent. 
Depending on regional requirements the options can be limited, after consultation with the relevant IRB/IEC and/or regulatory authority. 
Data collected during a telephone assessment visit can be entered into the e-CRF pages of the 
corresponding “missed” visit. Enter the date of th e phone call as the “date of visit” and enter the

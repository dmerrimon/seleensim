OBJECTIVES:
Aim: To investigate the association between heart rate variability, anxiety and sleep in 
the Brain Injury population using biosensors. 
STU#: STU00212891
Version Date:  Page 2 of 10
HRP-593 / v08242020Hypothesis:  We predict that decreased heart rate variability and poor sleep quality will 
be significantly correlated with higher self-reported anxiety following BI.
BACKGROUND:
1.1Anxiety is a common problem after Brain Injury (BI). Anxiety has been 
associated with interference in rehabilitation following BI and worse functional 
outcomes.  Dysregulation of mood, including anxiety are common following 
TBI1. This is a result of the primary neuropathology, as well as secondary 
factors such as sleep disturbances and memory of the inciting trauma.
Depression and anxiety after a TBI are associated with poorer cognitive, 
social, and functional outcomes.4
1.2The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56105] (HADS), is a self-reported scale 
used to measure symptoms of depression and anxiety within the past one 
week. Patients rate the frequency of these symptoms on a 4-point Likert-type 
scale. It has been validated in both medical and general populations, the 
HADS consists of 14 items total and is divided into the Anxiety subscale 
(HADS-A) and Depression subscale (HADS-D). The HADS has strong 
internal validity in the TBI population with good concurrent and discriminant 
validity with other self-report scales.4 In addition, the depression anxiety 
stress scales (DASS-21) is a self-report scale assessing levels of depression, 
anxiety, and stress over the previous week. Items are rated on a 4-point 
Likert-type scale, with higher scores reflecting higher levels of depression, 
anxiety, or stress. The measure displays good-to-excellent reliability and 
validity.5 The association between sleep and anxiety, as assessed by [CONTACT_563332]-21, has not been studied in an inpatient TBI population.
1.3Sleep Disorders are also common following BI.  Many of the impairments 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_563333]2. Current assessment of sleep in inpatient BI patients is subjective, 
often obtained from patient self-reports or based on gross observation by a 
staff member. The inpatient BI population is frequently in an amnestic state –

HRP-593 / v08242020referred to as post-traumatic amnesia. Therefore, these patients have 
difficulty with accurately reporting their recollection of duration and quality of 
sleep. The use of activity monitors, such as the ANNE sensors or 
BiostampRC patch, may be a more accurate way of measuring quality of 
sleep in patients with BI. 
1.4No study to date has evaluated the association between anxiety and sleep 
quality after BI. In other populations, sleep deprivation results in an increase 
in self-reported feelings of depressed mood, anger, frustration, tension, and 
anxiety3. Manifestation of such behaviors has the potential to impede the 
patient’s recovery by [CONTACT_563334][INVESTIGATOR_563328]. Properly regulating the patient’s sleep-
wake cycle is one way such behaviors can be minimized as much as 
possible. In addition, early identification and treatment of anxiety and post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may improve functional recovery for these 
patients.
1.5Similar to self-reports of sleep, BI patients may have difficulty expressing 
their subjective experience of anxiety to clinicians. Reduced heart rate 
variability has been demonstrated to correlate with symptoms of anxiety in the 
general population.8.4 Using biosensors, such as ANNE sensors or 
BiostampRC patch, the ECG component may be used to calculate heart rate 
variability in TBI patients. Heart rate variability is a physiologic measure that 
has been used to indirectly estimate function of the cardiac autonomic 
nervous system. It is comprised of various frequencies that are influenced by 
[CONTACT_563335], core body temperature, sympathetic and parasympathetic 
activity.9 Heart rate variability and anxiety has been studied in the mild TBI 
population, however it has not yet been assessed in the moderate and severe 
BI population using validated scales such as HADS and DASS-21.10

Pulse Arrival Time (PAT) and Pulse Transit Time (PTT) and sleep quality. 
2.2ActiGraphy: Participants will be asked to wear the Actiwatch for [ADDRESS_740129]/activity 
cycle, amplitude of the rest/activity rhythm and activity levels during the day and sleep 
period. Of particular interest is the timing and stability of the sleep and wake (rest/activity) 
rhythm in this older adult population because of the age related changes in circadian timing. 
It is designed for long-term monitoring of gross motor activity in humans and has an 
accelerometer capable of sensing motion with a minimal resultant force of 0.01 x g3. 
Actigraphy has been used on a variety of population, including older adults.  Study 
Participants are instructed to wear an actigraph around the clock (except when bathing) for 
[ADDRESS_740130]. We set the recording parameters as follow: 
epoch length, 0.5 minutes, and threshold automatic sensitivity (the algorithm automatically 
scores an epoch as sleep if the total activity value is equal to or less than the threshold
sensitivity value calculated from the mean score in the active period multiplied by K 
[constant=0.888) and divided by [CONTACT_563336].
2.3Biostamp Npoint: Small flexible sensor that contours to the skin. This sensor will be used to 
measure additional physical activity and heart rate. 
PROCEDURES  INVOLVED:
Following admission to the inpatient brain injury service, patients will be screened in 
order to determine whether or not they meet all of the inclusion or any of the exclusion 
criteria as outlined above. If a subject is deemed to be a candidate for the research 
protocol, they will be approached in order to obtain informed consent for the study. 
Wearable Biosensors and the ActiGraph will be placed on the subject’s non-dominant 
wrist. If the non-dominant wrist has motor impairment due to brain injury, then the 
ActiGraph will be placed on the dominant wrist. If both arms have motor weakness due 
to the brain injury, then the ActiGraph will be placed on the least affected extremity. The 
ANNETMsensor system set will be placed on the patient’s chest and finger. Sleep data 
will be obtained for seven consecutive nights. For anxiety, we will have a daytime, 5-[ADDRESS_740131] of the subjects’ names 
and respective coded identifiers will be stored in a secure location on one of the co-
investigator’s encrypted and password protected computers at the Shirley Ryan 
AbilityLab. The data collected will be associated with the coded identifiers on a Microsoft 
Excel spreadsheet on one of the co-investigator’s encrypted and password protected 
computer at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab. Data will consist of sleep and heart rate 
variability data from the wearable biosensors, and sleep logs by [CONTACT_75462], self-
reported sleep quality, anxiety and PTSD scales. The scales, HAD, DASS-21 and PCL-
S, will be obtained on five separate occasions.
STU#: STU00212891
Version Date:  Page 5 of 10
HRP-593 / v08242020The subject will be monitored to ensure they are not experiencing an allergic 
reaction/skin irritation from the wearable biosensor system. If this is the case, the 
treating physician will be notified and they will determine whether or not the patient 
should continue with the study.
Sleep log data will be extracted from the Cerner electronic medical record of each 
patient and recorded in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet with associated coded identifier. 
Data will be stored on one of the co-investigator’s password protected and encrypted 
computer at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab. 
Data recorded will include: sleep data as measured by [CONTACT_563337], ActiGraph, 
ANNETMsensor system; scores of the HAD, DASS-[ADDRESS_740132]-hoc analyses will be 
performed on biometric data collected by [CONTACT_563338] – including heart 
rate, temperature and movement.
Questionnaires
1.Karolinska Sleep and wake diaries:  Participants will be asked to maintain daily sleep logs 
for 7 consecutive days and to note bedtime, wake-up time, total sleep time, sleep latency, 
wake after sleep onset, naps, any unusual events during the day or night, any hot flashes 
per day (if female), and rating of overall sleep quality. The sleep diary will provide more 
detailed information of sleep quality.
2.The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI):  This self-rated 21 item questionnaire assesses 
individual sleep habits (bedtime, morning rising time, sleep-onset latency, and night sleep 
duration), insomnia, and hypnotic use over a 1-month time interval. The PSQI has internal 
consistency and a reliability coefficient (Cronbach’s alpha) of 0.83 for its seven 
components. The PSQI has been widely applied in a variety of clinical settings and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_563329], because of its satisfactory 
3.The Berlin Questionnaire:  These questions were designed to identify adult patients who are 
likely to have sleep apnea. It asks about snoring behavior, wake time sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_563330], 
and the presence of obesity or hypertension. 
4.Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist:  To evaluate for symptoms of PTSD in our BI 
population, we will use the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL) which assesses 
self-reported PTSD symptoms within the past 1 month that correspond with the DSM-IV 
criteria and the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS). These scales have been researched and 
validated for use in civilian and veteran populations.6 The PCL-S, “S” for specific, is a 17-
item self-report measure covering the 17 DSM-IV symptoms of PTSD that specifies date 
and event of trauma.
5.The Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS):  It is a self-reported scale used to 
measure symptoms of depression and anxiety within the past one week. Patients rate the 
frequency of these symptoms on a 4-point Likert-type scale. It has been validated in both 
medical and general populations, the HADS consists of 14 items total and is divided into 
the Anxiety subscale (HADS-A) and Depression subscale (HADS-D). The HADS has strong 
internal validity in the TBI population with good concurrent and discriminant validity with 
other self-report scales.4 
6.The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21):  It is a self-report scale assessing levels 
of depression, anxiety, and stress over the previous week. Items are rated on a 4-point

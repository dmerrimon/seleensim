1. Master Protocol Summary  
Title  Master Protocol for Pragmatic  Trials utilizing the Surprise Question and Evaluating 
the Effect of Prompting Palliative Care Consultation  on Provider Referral Rates and 
Subsequent Outcomes for Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310644]. 
Brief Summary  This Master Protocol describes the general design features of a platform trial 
evaluating the effect of prompting palliative care consultation  on provider referral 
rates and  outcomes  for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310645] . The Master 
Protocol provides the background and overarching approach to all trials to be 
conducted on this platform. This includes rationale for the choice of primary 
outcome s based on stage , general inclusion and exclusion criteria, randomization , 
intervention,  and blinding . The protocol also highlights expectations for  final 
analyses, sample size considerations, safety reporting, and data collection . In 
addition, the Master Protocol describes general principles for trial operations and 
oversight. Appendices to the Master Protocol provide  additional relevant 
information and identify patient  population s with serious illness (“clinical domains”)  
for whom the intervention will be evaluated , including additional eligibility criteria, 
sample size, and other features s pecific to the clinical domain . 
Study Design  Single center , pragmatic , randomized platform trial

Analys es Stage 1 : The primary outcome, percentage of patients with palliative care consults 
placed  within 48 hours after enrollment , will be evaluated for an anticipated 10%  of 
the total sample size . The following separations  between groups , during Stage 1 , 
would  then  determine trial progression to  Stage 2.  
• > 50% group separation : the trial would move forward to Stage 2 without 
modification.  
• 15-50% group separation: the trial would move forward to Stage 2 with 
modification to the eligibility criteria, intervention, or other aspects of the 
study protocol.  
• < 15% group separation: the trial would not move forward to Stage 2.  
We are explicitly examining the separation between groups for the primary 
outcome at Stage [ADDRESS_382140] the same data collected and will be in cluded 
in the analys es for the primary, secondary, and exploratory outcomes.   
 
Stage 2: In the main analysis of the primary outcome, the number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -free 
days by [CONTACT_4475] [ADDRESS_382141] for 
categorical variables . 
Sample Size  Various Appendi ces will specify a sample size for the respective clinical domain. The 
number of patients enrolled in all the clinical domains under this Master Protocol is

2. Background  
Palliative Care for Serious  Illnesses  
Palliative care is specialized medical care focused on providing patients with relief from the symptoms, 
pain, and stress of serious illness , regardless of diagnosis, by [CONTACT_310697], preventing, and treating 
suffering. The goal is to improve quality of life for both the patient and the patient’s family. Palliative 
care  is appropriate at any age and at any stage in a serious illness. It may be provided together with 
curative treatment, and includes intensive focus on symptom and pain management, psychosocia l and 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_310650], and assistance in advance care planning.1-3  
 
In some studies, integration of palliative care  has been shown to : improve patient quality of life, sleep 
quality, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_176315] -being; reduce depressive symptoms, healthcare costs and utilization, and 
aggressive interventions at the end of life; increase participation in advance care directives ; and increase 
lifespan.4,5 A recent phase 3 randomized controlled palliative care  trial in lung cancer patients showed 
that although fewer patients in the early palliative care  intervention arm received aggressive end -of-life 
care (33% vs 54%), median survival was longer comp ared to patients who received standard of care 
alone (11.6 months vs 8.9 months).[ADDRESS_382143] savings of $1,696 per admission for patients who survived 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478] $4,908 per admission for patients who did not survive hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].7 However, 
there is a paucity of palliative care  effectiveness data fr om randomized controlled trials.  
 
A meta -analysis of palliative care  trials found 22 randomized controlled studies with 14 of these 
interventions being of palliative intent and only 8 utilizing a specialized palliative care  intervention. 
Overall, participants receiving palliative care  showed improvements in quality of life  (5 out of the 7 trials 
which examined quality of life  as a primary outcome), increased satisfaction with care (7 out of the 10 
trials which examined patient and caregiver satisfaction with care), and improved copi[INVESTIGATOR_310651] (two trials that examined perceived symptom distress), with mixed find ings in physical and 
psychological symptom improvement.[ADDRESS_382144] shown similar promise 
for palliative care interventions.12-15  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_310652], the incorporation of palliative care consultation into clinical practice in many 
settings is  inconsistent and often too late in the clinical trajectory .16,17  In an effort to introduce palliative 
care sooner and more consistently into patient’s care pathways, we will explore an interruptive provider 
nudge to prompt palliative care consideration  in key patient populations . This integrated approach will 
also help bridge the knowledge gap as to w hether systematic ally prompting palliative care consultation 
can improve referral rates and outcomes for patients with serious illness.

Full Study Title: Pragmatic Trial Investigating Surpris e Question in End of Life (SeQuEL ) Care and the 
Effect of Prompting Palliative Care Consultation on Provider Referral Rates and Subsequent Outcomes 
for Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310643]: Mohana Karlekar, MD , FACP, FAAHPM  
 
 
The processes  used to 1) identify hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310653] , 2) query a provider about 
their  status,  and 3) prompt  consideration of palliative care consultation are amenable to conduct 
through the electronic health record. Step [ADDRESS_382145]. Step 2 will utilize the “Surprise Question” as 
a screening tool for  identification of potentia lly unmet palliative care needs. In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_310654], patients for whom consideration of palliative care consultation might be 
appropriate have use d the “Surprise Question”, which asks the treating clinician “would you be 
surprised if this patient died in the next 12 months?”18-20 Step 3  will harness the capability to prompt a 
provider to conside r appropriately indicated , complementary,  supportive care that may be  otherwise  
underutilized  while managing the patient’s immediate health crisis . 
 
Given the preliminary evidence that specialist palliative care may improve the quality and quantity of 
time spent alive and outside of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310655], we will evaluate the effect of 
prompting consideration of palliative care consultation in the electronic health record on provider 
referral rates to the palliative care service and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -free days among hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310656].  
 
3. Aims  and Hypotheses  
The overarching goal of the Master Protocol is to  investigate the effect of prompting consideration of 
palliative care  consultation through a best practice alert on provider referral rates to the palliative care 
service and clinical outcomes for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310657].  In each clinical domain, we will 
test the hypothesis that prompting earlier palliative care  consultation improves the engagement of the 
palliative care teams and clinical outcomes compared to not prompting consideration of palliative care 
consultation .  
 
Primary Aim:  
To determine whether prompting consideration of palliative care consultation through the electronic 
health record impacts the number of palliative consultations placed and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -free days among 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310657].  
 
Primary Hypothesis:  
Prompting consideration of palliative care consultation through the electronic health record will 
increase both the number of palliative care consults placed and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -free days among hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310658] .

Effect of Prompting Palliative Care Consultation on Provider Referral Rates and Subsequent Outcomes

Inclusion :  
• Patient is an adult (age ≥ 18 years).  
• Patient is admitted to the study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
• Patient meets criteria for serious  illness in clinical domain  of interest , as specified in the clinical 
domain appendix.  
• Patient’s treating physician, physician associate, or nurse practitioner answers “No” to a prompt 
in the electronic health record  asking, “Would you be surprised if this patient died in the next 12 
months?”  
 
Exclusion : 
• Patient  is known to have received any VUMC palliative care consultation during the prior 3 
months and /or the current admission.  
• Patient is known to be a prisoner.  
• Patient meets any additional exclusion criteria, as specified in the clinical domain appendices.  
 
6. Consent  
Because this study of an alert in the electronic health record prompting clinicians to consider palliative 
care consultation for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310659], 
could not practically be carried out without a waiver of the requirement for informed consent, and will 
not adversely affect the rights or welfare of the subjects, we will request that the trial be performed 
with waiver of the requirement for informed consent.  
• Minimal risk  of the research  – For all patients in this study, the decision of whether to request 
a palliative care consultation will be made by [CONTACT_102]’s treating clinician, as it would be in 
clinical care outside of the research. This study examines a clinical decision support tool in the 
electronic health record prompting the clinician to consider whether to request a palliative 
care consultation. A clinician decision support tool that collates clinically available  information 
about the patient for t he provider (i.e., the serious illness and the likelihood of death over the 
next 12 months) to prompt consideration of a palliative care consultation  involves no more 
than minimal incremental risk compared to the providers’ own synthesis of information within 
the clinical care outside of the research.  
• Impracticability of conduc ting the research without a waiver of informed consent  - This 
research could not be practicably conducted without a waiver of informed consent for two 
reasons. First, this study evaluates use of a clinical decision support tool that continuously and 
automatically screens hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310660] -time 
to consider whether palliative care consultation would be beneficial for the patient.  Obtaining 
written informed consent from patients be fore the clinical decision support tool identifies the 
patients as having serious illness and displays the prompt to their treating clinician would be 
logistically infeasible. Second, the study is designed to evaluate whether prompting of 
consideration of palliative care consultation affects outcomes. Obtaining informed consent for 
a study involving palliative care consultation would, in and of itself, prompt added 
consideration of palliative care consultation, thus biasing the results of the study and 
increasing t he chances of missing a true effect from the intervention.

• A waiver will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of patients  – All patients enrolled in 
the study would be eligible for palliative care consultation in clinical care. For all patients in the 
study, the treating clinician will determine whether a palliative care consultation is indicated. In 
both arms of the study , the clinician  will retain autonomy to provide the appropriate clinical 
care. All patients may request or decline a palliative care consultation at any time. No data are 
generated for this study beyond those generated as a part of clinical care. Thus, the rights and 
welfare of patients are not affected.  
 
7. Study Sites, Enrollment , and Randomization  
Recruitment Best Practice Advisories (BPAs) are one of the native Epic tools available to support 
research recruitment. Recruitment BPAs can be “silent”, meaning they run in the background and 
perform automated actions without interrupting user workflow, o r user -facing. Recruitment BPAs are 
built using pre -defined study inclusion/exclusion criteria, e.g.,  demographics, conditions, medications, 
lab results, etc.  When a patient matches the pre -defined study inclusion/exclusion criteria, the BPA is 
triggered t o alert predefined providers or staff who then further review the patient’s chart for any 
additional screening. If the patient is eligible, the patient will automatically be enrolled in the trial 
(anticipated under a waiver of consent) and randomized.  The outline of the BPA specific to this trial is 
described  below.  
 
The study will occur in the adult hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310661]. A best practice advisor 
will screen the electronic health record to identify patients who meet all inclusion criteria and no 
exclusion criteria. When a patient appears to m eet the eligibility criteria, the best practice advisor will 
ask the treating clinician the Surprise Question. If the answer to the Surprise Question is “No”, then the 
patient will be enrolled in the trial. Patients who are enrolled in the trial will be ra ndomized in a 1:1 ratio 
to the 'Palliative Care Consultation Prompt Group ’ or the ‘No Palliative Care Consultation Prompt Group ’ 
by [CONTACT_310698].  For patients deemed ineligible at  the time of screening, they will be rescreened 
upon each eligible inpatient visit to VUMC. Enrolled patients will not be rescreened upon subsequent 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . The process for screening, enrollment, and randomization is displayed in the 
figure below:

8. Study Procedures  
8.[ADDRESS_382146] will inform the treating clinician of the patient’s serious 
illness and the results of the Surprise Question and prompt the treating clinician to consider a palliative 
care consultation . The goal of this prompt is to encourage appropriate palliative care engagement. If the 
treating clinician feels a palliative care consultation would be indicated for the patient, the clinical 
decision support tool will facilitate the placement of a palliative care consultation by [CONTACT_310699]. As per usual care, the treating clinical team will then discuss  elements of  palliative care and the 
goals of the consult with the patient.  The palliative care consultation will aim to provide best practices 
for supporting patients with serious  illnesses , which is described in detail in the Appendix , Framework 
for Best Practices of (Inpatient) Palliative Care Consultation . If the treating clinician feels that a palliative 
care consultation would not be indicated, then the clinical decision support will record a reason for why 
a palliative care consultation is not indicated. A treating clinician can choose to place or disconti nue a 
palliative care consultation at any time , retaining full autonomy to deliver the appropriate patient care . 
A patient may choose to request or decline a palliative care consultation at any time.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_382147] or decline a palliative care consultation at any time.

Effect of Prompting Palliative Care Consultation on Provider Referral Rates and Subsequent Outcomes 
for Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310643]: Mohana Karlekar, MD , FACP, FAAHPM  
 
All data on baseline characteristics, receipt of interventions, and outcomes will be extracted from the 
electronic health record, electronic data warehouse, or other publicly available sources (e.g., Tennessee 
Department of Health, Center s for Disease Control, Tennessee Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6863]).  The Research 
Derivative is a database of clinical and related data derived from the Medical Center’s clinical systems 
and restructured for research. Data is repurposed from VU’s enterprise data warehouse, which includes 
data from StarPanel, VPI[INVESTIGATOR_46427], and ORMI S (Operating Room Management Information System), EPIC, 
Medipac, and HEO among others. The medical record number and other person identifiers are 
preserved within the database. Data types include reimbursement codes, clinical notes and 
documentation, nursi ng records, medication data, laboratory data, encounter and visit data, among 
others. Output may include structured data points, such as ICD [ADDRESS_382148] -protected computerized database maintained within a secure, 
web -based application for building and managing online databases (REDCap) or stored on secure servers 
with user -level access control.  
 
10. Outcome Measures  
10.1 Primary Outcome  
Stage 1:  The primary outcome will be the p ercentage of patients with palliative care consults placed  
within [ADDRESS_382149] 
the same data collected and will be included in the analyses for t he primary, secondary, and explor atory 
outcomes.  
Stage 2:  The primary outcome will be h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -free days by [CONTACT_4475] 90. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -free days will be defined as

11. Risks and Benefits  
Potential Risks : In this study of a clinical decision support tool prompting a clinician to consider palliative 
care consultation, the treating clinician determines whether a palliative care consultation is indicated. 
Patients may request or decline a palliative care consultation at any point. There are no known risks 
associated with use of a clinical decision support tool prompting a clinician to consider whether 
palliative care consultation is indicated. The provider will retain the autonomy to decide the appropriate 
clinical care for their patient. The loss of confidentially associated with the use of clinically collected  PHI 
is a potential risk. This risk is minimized by [CONTACT_310700], online 
database.  
 
Potential Benefits : For some patients with serious illness, specialty palliative care has been shown to 
improve physical and emotional symptoms  and decrease the time spent in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . It is possible 
that a clinical decision support prompting consideration of palliative care consultation may increase  the 
number and timeliness of appropriate referrals to the palliative care service and subsequently  the 
number of days outside the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310663].  The 
resu lts of the trial may improve care for thousands of patients with serious illness across the United 
States each year.  
 
12. Statistical Considerations  
Power and Sample Size Considerations : The sample size and power calculation for each clinical domain 
will be specified in the corresponding Appendi ces. The cumulative sample size of all the clinical domains 
together is anticipated not to exceed 5,000 patients.  
 
Statistical Analysis Plan : A statistical analysis plan for each clinical domain will be made publicly available 
before the conclusion of enrollment. General principles of the statistical analysis are outlined here.   
Stage 1 will evaluate the primary outcome , percentage of patients with palliative care consults placed  
within 48 hours after enrollment , for an anticipated  10%  of the total sample size . This initial stage is 
designed to determine feasibility and separation between groups. The following separations between 
groups , during Stage 1,  would then determine trial progression to  Stage 2.  
• > 50% group separation: the trial would move forward to Stage 2 without modification.  
• 15-50% group separation: the trial would move forward to Stage 2 with modification to the

• < 15% group separation: the trial would not move forward to Stage 2.  
We are explicitly examining the separation between groups for the primary outcome at Stage [ADDRESS_382150] the same data 
collected and will be included in the analyses for t he primary, secondary, and exploratory outcomes.  
 
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants (i.e., age, sex, race, comorbidities, 
disease severity, etc.) will be compared between the control and the intervention arms using Wilcoxon 
rank -sum test for continuous variables and Pearson’s Chi -square for categorical variables.  The main 
analysis will be an intention -to-treat comparison of the primary outcome between patients randomized 
to each of the two trial groups using a Wilcoxon rank -sum test . The main analysis of the secondary 
outcome will be an intention -to-treat comparison of the secondary outcome of survival to [ADDRESS_382151] -protected computerized database 
maintained within a secure, web -based application for building and managing online databases 
(REDCap) or stored on secure servers with user -level access con trol. All patients will be assigned a 
unique study number for use in the computerized database. At the time of publication all identifiers will 
be removed.  
 
14. Follow up and Record Retention  
Patients will be followed until complete data are available regarding clinical care and outcomes between 
enrollment and 90 days after enrollment. During the study and analyses, data will be stored in a secure, 
online database. At the time of publication, a ll identifiers will be removed and a fully deidentified 
dataset will be stored indefinitely to allow replication of the results.  
 
15. Safety Monitoring and Adverse Events  
15.1 Adverse Event Definitions  
Adverse Event – An adverse event will be defined as any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in 
a human subject temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not 
considered related to the subject’s participation in the research. Any adverse event occurring during the 
research will be classified according to the following characteristics:  
 
● Seriousness – An adverse event will be considered “serious” if it:  
o Results in death  
o Is life -threatening (defined as placing the patient at immediate risk of death)  
o Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
o Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
o Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect or  
o Based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient’s health , and

may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes 
listed in this definition.  
 
● Unexpectedness – An adverse event will be considered “unexpected” if the nature, severity, or 
frequency is neither consistent with:  
o The known or foreseeable risk of adverse events associated with the procedures 
involved in the research that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as 
the IRB -approved research protocol; nor  
o The expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of 
the subject experiencing the adverse event and the subject’s predisposing risk factor 
profile for the adverse event.  
 
● Relatedness – The strength of the relationship of an adverse event to a study intervention or 
study procedure will be defined as follows:  
o Definitely Related : The adverse event follows (1) a reasonable, temporal sequence from 
a study procedure AND (2) cannot be explained by [CONTACT_129156]’s clinical state or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_310664] (3) evaluation of the patient’s clinical 
state indicates to the investigator that the experience is definitely related to study 
procedures.  
o Probably or Possibly Related : The adverse event meets some but not all of the above 
criteria for “Definitely Related”.  
o Probably Not Related : The adverse event occurred while the patient was on the study 
but can reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_11564]’s clinical 
state or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
o Definitely Not Related : The adverse event is definitely produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical 
state or by [CONTACT_274437].  
o Uncertain Relationship : The adverse event does not fit in any of the above categories.

15.3 Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
The following types of adverse events will be recorded and reported:  
● Adverse events that are Serious  and Definitely Related, Probably or Possibly Related, or of 
Uncertain Relationship . 
● Adverse events that are Unexpected  and Definitely Related, Probably or Possibly Related, or of 
Uncertain Relationship . 
 
Adverse events that do not meet the above criteria will not be recorded or reported. Adverse events 
that the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310668] . The principal  
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310669], including 
seriousness, unexpectedness, and relatedness. For any adverse event that is serious AND unexpected , 
and definitely related, probably or possibly related, or of uncertain relationship, the principal  
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1318] r eport the adverse event to the study support staff  within 24 hours  of becoming aware 
of the adverse event. For any other adverse event requiring recording and reporting, the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310670] 72 hours  of becoming aware 
of the adverse event. The study support staff will coordinate with the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310671], including 
seriousness, expectedness, and relatedness. The principal  investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310672]. The study support staff will facilitate 
final determinations regarding relatedness.  
 
For adverse events that meet the above criteria for recording and reporting, study support staff  will 
notify the IRB  in accordance with the following reporting plan:  
 
Characteristics of the Adverse Event  Reporting Period  
Fatal or life -threatening (and therefore serious), 
unexpected, and definitely related, probably or 
possibility related, or of uncertain relationship.  Report to the IRB within 7 days after notification 
of the event.  
Serious but non -fatal and non -life-threatening, 
unexpected, and definitely related, probably or 
possibly related, or of uncertain relationship.  Report to IRB within 15 days of notification of the 
event.  
All other adverse events meeting criteria for 
recording and reporting.  Report to IRB during the annual continuing review . 
 
15.4 Clinical Outcomes that may be Exempt from Adverse Event Recording and Reporting  
In this study of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310673], clinical outcomes, including death, will be 
systematically collected and analyzed for all patients. The primary, secondary, and exploratory 
outcomes will be recorded and reported as clinical outcomes and not as adverse events unless treating 
clinicians or the principal  investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310674]: Version 2.0 – 7/31/202 4

Related  to the study intervention or study procedures. This approach – considering death and other 
outcomes  as clinical outcomes rather than adverse events and systemically collecting these clinical 
outcomes for analysis – is common in trials among patients with serious illness . This approach ensures 
comprehensive data on death and other outcomes for all patients, rather than relying on sporadic 
adverse event reporting to identify these important events.  The following events are examples of study -
specific clinical outcomes that would not be recorded and reported as adverse events unless treating 
clinicians or the principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_310675]:  
● Death  
● Duration of ICU admission  
● Duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
15.[ADDRESS_382153] also report Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others 
(“Unanticipated Problems”), regardless of severity, associated with study procedures within 24 hours  of 
the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310676]. An Unanticipated Problem is 
defined as any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
● Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that 
are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol; 
and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied;  AND  
● Definitely Related  or Probably or Possibly Related  to participation in the research (as defined 
above in the section on characteristics of adverse events); AND  
● Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
If any study personnel become aware of an event that may represent an Unanticipated Problem , they 
will immediately contact [CONTACT_62674]. The principal  investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310677]. If the principal  
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310678], the principal  investigator

2.0 Background  
Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis is the 12th leading cause of death in the [LOCATION_002].1 Patients with 
End-Stage Liver Disease (ESLD), a progressive illness synonymous with decompensated cirrhosis, 
advanced liver disease, and liver failure2, face many complications and a variety of health symptoms 
including the development of ascites, variceal hemorrhage, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatocellular 
carcinoma, cognitive decline, fatigue, pruritus, malnutrition, pain, and renal impairment.3,[ADDRESS_382155] and 1,223 patients were removed due to being too ill to 
undergo transplant. Of the 5,921 patients who received a liver transplant, 53.2% were on the waitlist for 
3 months or longer and 21.1% for more than [ADDRESS_382156] for liver transplant or were declined transplant, patients experienced significant 
symptoms including pain (65% of patients), nause a (58%), lack of appetite (49%), dyspnea (48%), anxiety 
(36%), and depression (10%). However, only 11% of patients were referred for palliative care, and only 
28% had do -not-resuscitate status  in their chart.6 Another study considered all patients discusse d by [CONTACT_8706]’s Liver Transplant Committee at a tertiary care academical medical center with a large liver 
transplantation  program. Of 769 patients discussed , 135 were removed from transplant consideration ; 
and only [ADDRESS_382157] for liver transplant, an early palliative care intervention 
counteracted the progression of worsening symptoms and significantly improved pruritus, appetite, 
anxiety, de pression, fatigue, and well -being.9 Moreover, the introduction of palliative care within the 
care course of patients  with decompensated  cirrhosis is endorsed by [CONTACT_310701]  (American A ssociation  
for the Study of Liver Diseases)  practice guidance  document.10

In addition to quality of life , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310686]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310687].11 In a study 
of 402 patients with decompensated cirrhosis who were admitted to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 78% of patients had at 
least one readmission, with 14% of these patients readmitted within [ADDRESS_382158] of $25,898 per readmission. Another 37%  of these patients were readmitted within [ADDRESS_382159] of $20,581 per admission. Of these, 22% were determined to be possibly 
preventable admissions.[ADDRESS_382160] been shown to reduce hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310688]. Lamba et al . conducted a prospective observational study comparing outcomes before 
and after structured palliative care program integration in the surgical intensive care unit for liver 
transplant service patients. After program implementation, goals of care discussions during physician 
rounds increased significantly (from 2% to 39% of patient -days), and the mean length of  stay in the 
surgical intensive care unit decreased by [ADDRESS_382161] - program implementation, do-not-
resuscitate  status significantly increased in those who died from 52% pre -implementation to 81% post -
implementation. Do-not-resuscitate  status was also instituted earlier, decreasing from 38 days after 
admission to 19 days after admission.13 Palliative care, once understood and integrated, has the 
potential to improve clinical outcomes, improve patient’s quality of life , and reduce cost. But when to 
integrate the services, how to integrate services, and for which patients, is not well established.  
 
ESLD has been recognized as  a condition in which early palliative care may be beneficial.9,[ADDRESS_382162] palliative care 
intervention for ESLD patients admitted as inpatients to our institution. An important component of 
eligibility related to the use of the Surprise Question, which was demonstrated to be a potentially useful 
screening tool in this population. Due to slower than expected enrollment, the trial was terminated 
before full enrollment. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_310689]’s early closure, early palliative care intervention increased  time 
to readmission and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310690], though our 
study was underpowered for the latter endpoint. These encouraging outcomes in this small trial indicate 
a potential signal for the effectiveness of s pecialty palliative care impact on time to readmission and

12.0 Statistical Considerations  
Power and Sample Size Considerations : The number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -free days can have a very asymmetric 
distribution with floor and ceiling effects and many tied values. This results in a scale that is best 
analyzed with a proportional odds model and treatment effect can be summarized as a common od ds 
ratio.

The minimal effect on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -free days to avoid missing is judged to be [ADDRESS_382165] a difference of 7 days (odds ratio of 1.5) with 0.9 power would require 388 subjects per study

Appendix  B: Framework for Best Practices of (Inpatient) Palliative Care 
Consultation   
1. Definitions  
a. Palliative care is medical care that aims to alleviate suffering and improve the quality of 
life of patients with serious illness.1  
b. Primary Palliative Care:  palliative care provided by a healthcare provider not specializing 
in palliative and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310693] ( e.g.,  primary hepatologist) .  
c. Specialty Palliative Care: palliative care provided through consultation by [CONTACT_310703]/or board certified in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310694] .2,[ADDRESS_382169] Consultation of Palliative Care Interdisciplinary Team.   
a. Interdisciplinary team (IDT): a team of palliative care specialists that includes but not 
limited to: physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, social workers, and chaplains, 
dedicated to assessment of physical, psychological, social, spi[INVESTIGATOR_37312], cultural , and ethical 
care plans of those with serious illness and at end of life.[ADDRESS_382170] palliative care consultations conducted at VUMC, 
acknowledging the heterogeneity of real -world encounters and tailored to address 
individual/family/caregivers’ needs. Palliative care specialists may address any or all of 
the following:  
 
i. Introduction/Education of palliative care field and its goals.  
ii. Assess and/or treat symptoms . 
iii. Identify patient surrogate and Advance Care Planning . 
iv. Engage patient and/or surrogate on:  
1. Understanding of serious illness and prognosis.  
2. Patient’s values and goals of care . 
3. What is and is not an acceptable quality of life.  
v. Facilitate communication and explore possible treatment pathways based on 
available medical interventions in setting of above goals . 
vi. Implement goal -concordant treatment pathway . 
vii. Referral to post -acute support services as appropriate ( e.g.,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125], outpatient 
palliative care, skilled nursing, OT/PT…) . 
 
3. End-Stage Liver Disease/ SeQu EL Considerations  
Below are topi[INVESTIGATOR_310695]:  
a. Indication, possibility, and requirements for transplant should be delineated as clearly as 
possible in order to allow for most effective discussion of treatment pathways.  
b. Eliciting patient (and/or surrogate) understanding of their liver disease (including 
treatment and/or prognosis) in the context of their lives and personal values/goals.  
c. Within context of elected goals/treatment pathway, procedural ESLD symptom 
management and discussions ( e.g.,  transplant, ascites -TIPS/Indwelling catheters, 
variceal bleeding -EGD/TIPS/BTO) should be coordinated with, if not guided by, 
hepatology treatment team.

Effect of Prompting Palliative Care Consultation on Provider Referral Rates and Subsequent Outcomes 
for Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310643]: Mohana Karlekar, MD , FACP, FAAHPM  
 
d. Within context of elected goals/treatment pathway, non -procedural symptom 
management and discussions ( e.g.,  encephalopathy, pain, nausea, dyspnea, pruritus, 
muscle crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], sleep disturbance, depression/anxiety etc.) may not require specific 
consultation with hepatology team other than coordination to ensure clear roles for 
effective teamwork and management; c oordination and multidisciplinary discussion is 
always encouraged.  
e. When feasible, family meetings and discussions should include patient -important 
stakeholders as well as members of primary medical stakeholders, in particular primary 
treatment team and hepatology consult team. Pre -meeting and debriefing should be 
componen ts of family meeting protocol to ensure most effective communication.

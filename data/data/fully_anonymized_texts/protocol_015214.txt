ORGANIZATION  EB Research Partnership  
NUMBER OF SITES  Single site  
RATIONALE  Of the various EB subtypes, it is well known that 
recessive dystrophic epi[INVESTIGATOR_108631] (RDEB) patients suffer from the most severe skin wounds . In this 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_278173], which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_278174]. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_278175]. There are limited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_278176] -related studies . The 
mainstay of treatment is  supportive with non- adhesive 
wound dressings .  
With the lack of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_278177], we propose to evaluate the matrix device as a suitable and safe device for application of a matrix wound dressing to EB wounds. This study is looking at preliminary wound efficacy signals and tolerability . 
Results of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_278178] a vehicle in delivering COL7A1 gene- corrected skin cells for 
healing of RDEB wounds . This is currently under 
research development by [CONTACT_278198]’s  Lab at 
Stanford.  
 
STUDY DESIGN  This is a single -center, randomized  feasibility study  that 
offers  an Open-L abel Phase upon completion of the 
Randomized Phase.  
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  To assess the preliminary  efficacy of matrix treatment in 
RDEB wound  
To assess safety profile of matrix treatment in  RDEB 
wound  
 
Protocol Number IRB -[ADDRESS_339850] 
SELECTION 
CRITERIA  Inclusion Criteria : 
Clinical and /or genetic diagnosis of RDEB by a 
dermatologist, age 6 years or older willing and able to give consent/assent and have at least 6 wounds (3 wound pairs) each with an area of 10cm2 or greater located at any site (excluding face and genital skin). The first patient that will be enrolled is an  adult patient before 
the recruitment of pediatric patients.  Wounds must be present for at least 4 weeks and able to be classified as recurrent wounds (wounds that heal within 12 weeks but then re- blister) vs chronic open (older than 12 weeks) .  
 Exclusion Criteria : 
Actively infected wounds with pus (colonized wounds are 
eligible), areas that have had squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), areas on the face and genitals, and areas that have been treated with investigational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_278179] 3 months .

Page 8 of 23 CONCOMMITANT 
MEDICATIONS Allowed:  current EB medications (i.e., pain meds, 
vitamins, iron infusions, antibiotic ointments, oral antibiotics if needed) . 
 
Prohibited:  none  
Efficacy Evaluations  Greater than 90% wound closure, patient reported 
outcomes in pain and itch sensation  
Primary endpoint  Comparison of the duration of wound closure (weeks) of 
matrix treated wounds vs control wounds from baseline to Month 4. Wound photos will be captured at least every 2 weeks  by [CONTACT_5363]/or caregivers. The matrix will be 
applied initially in clinic and afterwards patients/caregivers are allowed to apply the S pi[INVESTIGATOR_278181] (up to once a 
week) to the designated treatment wounds if required. They will receive adequate training at the in- person 
and/or remotely  visits before applying it . 
Secondary endpoints  1. Comparison of application site adverse events (burning, 
erythema, pain) between matrix treated wounds vs control wounds after application.  
 
2. Comparison of wound pain (Wong- Baker FACES scale) 
between matrix treated wounds vs control wounds at Month 1, Month 2, Month 3, Month 4 (prior to application). More frequent timepoints may be requested.  
 
3. Comparison of wound itch [Itch Severity Scale (adults) / Itchy Man scale (minors)] between matrix treated wounds vs control wounds at Month 1, Month 2, Month 3, Month 4 (prior to application). More frequent timepoints may be requested.  
 
4. Comparison of wounds that reach >50% healing from baseline in matrix vs control wounds at month 1, 2, 3, 4.  
5. Comparison of wounds that reach >70% healing from baseline in matrix vs control wounds at month 1, 2, 3, 4.  
 
Other Evaluations  1. Comparison of caregiver responses on wound 
dressing ease of use on matrix treated wounds vs control wounds with the Caregiver Global Impression of Change survey (C aGI-C) at Month [ADDRESS_339852] to ensure 
tolerability and safety before treating pediatric EB 
subjects > 6 years of age.  
STATISTICS  
Primary Analysis Plan  Sample size calculation:  
We calculated that a sample size of 40 wounds (20 matrix -treated vs 20 untreated) would give us 90% power 
to detect a difference of 8.5 vs 6 weeks (SD=3) of wound closure duration between matrix treated vs untreated wounds with a two- sided alpha of 0.05.  
Recruitment plan:  
We will recruit our cohort of 6- [ADDRESS_339853] EB clinic (~100 RDEB patients), our clinical research database (75 RDEB patients), and the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_278182] (EBCRC) (290 RDEB patients). Many of these patients have already received a clinical and/or  genetic diagnosis of RDEB and have detailed 
medical and wound histories recorded  
Rationale for Number 
of Subjects  This sample size calculation is based on our prior natural 
history study of [ADDRESS_339854] portable tool that delivers an electrospun, nanofibrous matrix dressing to wounds to promote healing that is approved in Europe. The aim of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_278183], safety and tolerability, particularly in the EB population. 
 1.3 Objectives of the clinical investigation

2.3 Study design 
2.3.1 General study design 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9985] 6- 10 subjects where wounds will be randomized 1:1 to matrix or no 
treatment (control): Patients will be asked to review and sign the informed 
consent form. The matrix will be applied to randomized treatment wounds 
(computer generated randomization), along with a non- adhesive bandage as a 
protective layer. At the time of matrix application, the investigator will score amount of wound burning, pain, or other adverse events. Non- treated wounds 
will have the patient’s standard of care, and the non- adhesive bandage applied. 
Reapplication of matrix treatment may be required soon after the initial application depending on how well the matrix has propagated with the first application. Subjects and caregivers will be trained on how to take photos. We will ensure that photos of the face are NOT included to  protect patients' 
confidentiality . One day after a wound examination will be performed in clinic. 
The investigator will assess the adherence of the matrix, and any adverse events (AEs).  
Thereafter a caregiver may travel to the participants home to apply the matrix 
device to randomized, treated wounds once a month or more frequently if 
required (up to once-a- week application is allowed, the patient will record when 
they have applied the matrix treatment at home and the reason). Spray 
application(s) may be skipped at the discretion of the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_278185].  Investigators will perform remote monitoring (via phone call 
or virtual platform) at Week 1, Week 2, Month 1, Month 2, Month 3 and Month 4 
(additional interim visits may be required) to assess for adverse events and track 
progress. Additional photographs will be taken, and investigators will use Telehealth to monitor for healing and safety reporting. Compliance is verified by [CONTACT_13452]-weekly photographs . Wound swabs of treated and untreated wounds will be 
taken prior to spray treatment and at Month [ADDRESS_339855] population(s)
Patients aged 6- 65 years old with a clinical and/or genetic diagnosis of recessive 
dystrophic epi[INVESTIGATOR_108631]. This target population was chosen as they
suffer from large painful wounds usually resistant to conventional treatment and
would benefit the most from matrix treatment with the Spi[INVESTIGATOR_278186].

3. W ound areas on the face and genitals ; 
4. W ound areas that have been treated with investigational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_278179] [ADDRESS_339857] of care wound dressings (6 wounds, or 3 wound pairs). The matrix  will be applied to randomized treatment wounds, along 
with a non- adhesive bandage ( e.g. Telfa, Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_136408] , Rylon , etc. ) as a protective 
layer. At the time of matrix application, the investigator will ask about  any 
potential  wound burning sensations, pain, or other adverse events. Non- treated 
wounds will have the patient’s standard of care and non-adhesive bandage 
applied. Subjects and caregivers will be trained on how to take photos. Wound pain and itch are captured at least every 2 weeks .  
 The matrix treatment will be applied on Day 0 in clinic. Day 1 visit will be 
mandatory to assess for any adverse events (Day [ADDRESS_339858] occurred and this will be at the discretion of the

Page 14 of 23 PI). Subsequent applications will be performed by a caregiver if needed up to once a week.  
 Detailed Schedule:  
 Randomized phase: Day 0 – Spi[INVESTIGATOR_278189] a non- adhesive dressing. Reapplication of matrix treatment may be 
required depending on how well the matrix has adhered with the first application. The need for this will be assessed by [CONTACT_473].  
Day 1 – A wound examination will be performed in clinic one day after the initial 
application.  The investigator will assess the adherence of the matrix, and any 
adverse events (AEs).  Day 2 is optional and may be required if medically indicated at the discretion of 
the PI.  
Week 1, Week 2, and Months 1, 2, 3, 4  – Investigators  will arrange telehealth 
assessment at Week 1, Week 2, Month 1, Month 2, M onth 3 and M onth 4 
(additional interim phone call visits/telehealth assessment at Week 6, Week 10 
and Week 14, or more frequently , if deemed necessary). A caregiver may travel 
to the participants home to apply the matrix device to randomized, treated wounds  (up to once a week if needed, they will record the date of application and 
the reason). Additional photographs will be taken, and investigators will use 
Telehealth to monitor for healing and safety reporting. At the time of matrix 
application, the caregiver  will score amount of wound burning, pain, or other 
adverse events. Matrix will not be applied after Week 14  to ensure the final 
wound assessment at Month 4.  
Month 4  – Telehealth (End of Randomized Phase) Visit: The investigator will 
virtually assess wound healing compared to baseline photographs in the treated and control wounds. Digital photographs of the treatment and control wounds will be taken with a ruler by [CONTACT_18629]/participant  and sent to the investigator. All 
wound photos will be stored and reviewed on the REDCap . The participant’s 
preference to enroll  on the Open- Label Phase will be ass essed.  
 Open- Label  Phase: 
Participants who are eligible for the Open- Label  Phase , at the discretion of the 
investigators (taking into consideration participant’s prior documented adverse events, current medical status, and adherence to trial protocol) , and who choose 
to participate, will be provided with the Spi[INVESTIGATOR_278190] a week at most. Participant will be allowed to treat previously 
randomized wounds  (treated and control wounds ) and new wounds, up to a max 
of 10 individual wounds ; there won’t be control nor randomized wounds. The 
wounds would be selected at  the Open- Label  Baseline remote visit and will need 
to meet the same wound criteria as the R andomized phase.  At minimum d uring 
each monthly visit, participants will be required to provide digital photos taken 
with a ruler before and after the application of the Spi[INVESTIGATOR_278191] . Additionally, 
they will complete surveys regarding their pain and itch, offer updates on their

Randomized Phase) , Open- Label  Month 1, Open- Label  Month 2, Open- Label  
Month 3, and  Open- Label  Month 4 . 
 Open- Label Baseline visit – Telehealth visit. Participant will have u p to two 
weeks  after the end of the Randomized Phase to enroll i n the Open- Label Phase. 
At the Open -Label Baseline visit the Investigator will select up to 10 wounds  from 
previously randomized (treated and control) wounds and new wounds  (that meet 
the initial wound criteria) . Medical history, con -medications, and adverse events 
will be reviewed. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_278192], digital 
photographs of the wounds from before and after will be taken with a ruler by [CONTACT_18629]/participant and sent to the research team . Participant will complete 
baseline pain and itch surveys . 
 
Open- Label Months 1, 2, 3, 4 – Investigators will arrange telehealth assessment  
visits  at Open- Label Month 1, Open- Label Month 2, Open- Label Month 3 and 
Open- Label Month 4 (additional interim remote assessment s if deemed 
necessary). A caregiver may travel to the participant ’s home to apply the matrix 
device to the treated wounds (up to once a week if needed, they will record the 
date of application and the reason). P hotographs will be taken, and investigators 
will use Telehealth to monitor for wound healing and safety reporting. At the time 
of matrix application, the caregiver will notate any wound burning sensations , 
pain, or other adverse events. Matrix will not be applied after Open- Label Week 
14 to ensure the final wound assessment at Open- Label Month 4.  
 
Open- Label Month 4  – Telehealth (End of Open- Label  Phase) visit. The 
investigator will virtually assess wound healing compared to baseline photographs in the treated wounds. Photos of the treated wounds will be collected by [CONTACT_18629]/participant and sent to the resea rch team . All wound 
photos will be stored and reviewed on the REDCap.  
2.5.3 Allocation to treatment  
Intra-patient randomization and allocation of treatment is planned. Wounds will 
be matched according to wound characteristics e.g. size, severity,  and location. 
Randomization will be computer generated.

2.6.1 Study endpoints 
 Primary endpoint:  
Comparison of the duration of wound closure (weeks) of matrix treated wounds 
vs control wounds from baseline to Month 4. Wound photos will be captured bi -
weekly by [CONTACT_50633] . 
 
Secondary endpoints:  
1. Comparison of application site adverse events (burning, erythema, pain) 
between matrix treated wounds vs control wounds after application ; 
2. Comparison of wound pain (Wong- Baker FACES scale) between matrix 
treated wounds vs control wounds at month 1, month 2, month 3, month 4 (prior to  matrix application) ;  
3. Comparison of wound itch ( Itch NRS/ Itchy Man scale) between matrix treated 
wounds vs control wounds at month 1, month 2, month 3, month 4 (prior to matrix application;  
4. Comparison of wounds that reach >50% healing from baseline in matrix vs control wounds at month 1, 2, 3, 4; 
5. Comparison of wounds that reach >70 % healing from baseline in matrix vs 
control wounds at month 1, 2, 3, 4.  
  Exploratory endpoints:  
1. Comparison of caregiver responses on wound dressing ease of use on matrix 
treated wounds vs control wounds with the Caregiver Global Impression of Change (CrGI ); 
2. Comparison of change in wound cultures between matrix treated wounds vs 
control wounds at Month 2 and Month 4, 
 
 
2.6.2 Sample size determination 
We calculated that a sample size of 40 wounds (20 matrix -treated vs 20 
untreated) would give us 90% power to detect a difference of 8.5 vs 6 weeks 
(SD=3) of wound closure duration between untreated vs matrix treated wounds 
respectively a two- sided alpha of 0.05. This sample size calculation is based on 
our prior natural history study of 720 RDEB wounds for 6 months in 13 RDEB adult and pediatric participants. We anticipate that the majority of pediatric  
wounds will be the recurrent type. If the Spi[INVESTIGATOR_278194], then this clinical trial would show a novel wound healing device that may improve wound closure duration in difficult to heal RDEB wounds. We would assess the secondary endpoints to determine if a 2.5-week  shorter wound 
closure is clinically meaningful and associated with wound specific decreases in pain and itch.

Page 20 of 23 2.6.3 Outcome data and data analysis 
We anticipate that a higher number of wounds achieving >90 % wound closure would be achieved with the matrix treatment. Furthermore,  we anticipate that  
patient reported wound pain and itch will be reduced with matrix treatment. This 
study would also provide pi[INVESTIGATOR_278195] e.g. determination of  wound type, wound location, wound size suitable for matrix 
treatment.  
3.0 RISK ANALYSIS  
 3.1 Anticipated risks. 
1. Irritation including burning, pain and itch when the matrix treatment is 
applied to the wound bed; 
2. Potential allergic reaction to the matrix material .  
 
3.[ADDRESS_339863]  (UADE) : Any serious adverse effect on 
health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated 
with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 Associated with the investigational device:  There is a reasonable possibility 
that the adverse effect may have been caused by [CONTACT_14882]. 
 Serious adverse effect : An adverse effect is considered “serious” if, in the view 
of either the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes :  
1. D eath;

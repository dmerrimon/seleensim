the performance of established products. The goal of this study  is to compare the performance of  
Biofinity  Energys  (Lens A),  a SiHy  monthly replacement  lens from CooperVision  Inc., which has 
successfully been established on the market with TOTAL30  (Lens B), a SiHy monthly replacement 
lens recently launched by [CONTACT_516154].  
[ADDRESS_669035] lenses in habitual 
wearers of frequent replacement ( FRP) lenses who report use of digital devices at least 6 hours 
per day. Each study lens type will be  worn for 1 -month .  
The prim ary outcome variable  for this study is: 
• Lens handling on removal (0 -10 scale, 0.5 steps) collected in the Day [ADDRESS_669036]/second month  for each p articipant . Participants  will be randomized immediately prior to their 
first lens dispense.  
EX-MKTG -130 BREAM  Protocol v 2.0 17nov2021  10 This randomization schedule will be generated for each  site using a web -based program: 
(www.randomization.com ). The lens type that will  be worn during the first month  is called “ Lens 
type #1”, the lens type dispended for the second month  is called “ Lens type  #2”. The final study 
randomization schedule will be generated by [CONTACT_94648] ’s Database Administrator  and provided to 
the rese arch assistants at each site .  
5.1.3  MASKING  
At the fitting visit, only the participant will be masked of the lens type, the investigator will  know 
which type is being fit in order to make changes to the lens at this visit  if needed .  
At both dispense visits, participants and investigators will be masked to the lens type dispensed.  
In order to achieve this, unmasked study personnel will determin e the lens order according to 
the randomization schedule  and will over -labeled the l ens packages/f oils prior to dispense . 
5.2 INVESTIGATIONAL  SITES  
5.2.1  NUMBER OF SITES  
This study will be conducted in between four and six optometry practice sites  in the US  and/or

5.3.3  INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
A person is eligible for inclusion in the study if he/she:  
1. Is at least 18 years of age and no older than 35 years, and has full legal capacity to 
volunteer ; 
2. Has read and signed an information consent letter ; 
3. Is willing and able to follow instructions and maintain the appointment schedule;  
4. Self-reports  having a full eye examination in the previous two years;  
5. Self-reports  spending  on most days  at least 6 hours cumulative (not necessarily in one 
single stretch) using digital device s such as a computer, laptop, tablet, e -reader, smart -
phone;  
6. Has healthy eyes with no health condition or medication that contra -indicate contact [CONTACT_94638], in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] ; 
7. Anticipates being able to wear the study lenses for at least 8 hours a day, 6 days a week;  
8. Habitual ly wears  soft frequent replacement contact [CONTACT_94636], for the past 3 months 
minimum  (NOTE: the habitual contact [CONTACT_516156] (or their equivalent private label brand name ) 
and no more than one third are to be  an Alcon brand ; 
9. Has refractive astigmatism no hi gher than -0.75D C in each eye ; 
10. Can be fit and achieve binocular distance vision  of at least 20/30 Snellen (Available lens 
parameters are sphere +6.00 to -6.00D , 0.25D  steps ). 
A person will be excluded from the study if he/she:  
1. Is participating in any concurrent clinical or research study ; 
2. Has any known active * ocular disease  and/or infection  that contraindicates contact [CONTACT_94638] ; 
EX-MKTG -[ADDRESS_669041]  a 
study outco me variable ;  
4. Is using any systemic or topi[INVESTIGATOR_94622] a study outcome variable ; 
5. Has known sensitivity to the diagnostic sodium fluorescein  used in the study;  
6. Self-reports  as pregnant, lactating or planning a pregnancy at the time of enrolment;  
7. Has und ergone refractive error surgery  or intraocular surgery . 
* For the purposes of this study, active ocular disease is defined as infection  or inflammation which 
requires therapeutic treatment. Mild  (i.e. not considered clinically relevant) lid abnormalities  (blepharit is, 
meibomian gland dysfunction, papi[INVESTIGATOR_1257]), corneal and conjunctival staining and dry eye are not considered 
active ocular dis ease.  Neovascularization and corneal scars  are the result of previous hypoxia, infection or 
inflammation and are therefore not active.  
 
The upper age limit of 35years is in place to eliminate the influence of presby[CONTACT_19555] (age -related 
difficulties focusing a t close range) on eye strain with extended close work or digital device use.  
Pregnant and lactating women are not being excluded from the study due to safety concerns but 
due to fluctuations in refractive error, accommodation and/ or visual acuity that oc cur secondary 
to systemic hormonal changes  and water retention . It has further been shown that pregnancy 
could impact tear production, which could impact dry eye symptoms. Such fluctuations could 
affect data, thereby [CONTACT_516157]. 
5.[ADDRESS_669042] lenses (Lens A and Lens B) for each 
potential participant prior to them attending for the screening/fit visit. This order will be based on 
their habitual contact [CONTACT_353698].  One commercial pack of 6 lenses will be ordered per eye 
unless both eyes require the same prescription , when only one 6 -pack of lenses will be ordered.  
This will mean that there will be study lenses on site at the time of the screening visit and unless 
there are changes required to the prescription, the dispense visit will be able to occur 
immediately after  the screening/fit visit.  
Reimbursement to practice sites for study product expenses will be provided by [CONTACT_516158].  
CORE will provide all sites with the study paperwork. This will include participant informed 
consent letters and study data collection forms, product accountability logs and the participant 
EX-MKTG -[ADDRESS_669043] two hours  that day . If this is not the case  and the participant  
is not experiencing  any problems  with the lenses, the appointment will be rescheduled, ideally 
within the visit window.   
Visits that fall outside of the specified visit windows will be designated as protocol deviations and 
at the end of the study, the data colle cted during protocol deviations will be assessed for their 
suitability to be included in the analysis population.  
Table 2 summarizes the scheduled study visits and stud y codes.

in the  inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria and is eligible to continue in the study.  
14. If the required prescriptions for both lens types are available , the lens Dispense visit (1 -0) 
will occur on the same day, o therwise the correct lens powers  will be ordered  and the 
Dispense visit  will be scheduled once both lens types are on site (within 0-21 days after 
Visit 0 ).  
 
5.5.2  REPEATED SCREENING VISITS  (VISIT 0 OR VISIT 0 /R1)

cost to them. The contact [CONTACT_516160]. This study will investigate participants’ wearing schedule intended for daily wear (NO T 
extended wear), similar to the average wearing time of 10 -16 hours for daily wear lenses.  
This study is considered to be a non -significant risk study based on United State Food and Drug 
administration (FDA) and International Standards Organization (ISO)  guidelines, because the 
study devices used as intended in this study (1) do not represent a potential for serious risk to the 
health, safety or welfare of the subject, and (2) are not implants, (3) are not used to support or 
sustain human life, (4) are no t of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating 
disease or otherwise prevents impairment of human health.

9 DISCONTINUATION FROM THE STUDY  
Participants may be discontinued at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor in consideration 
of participant safety or protocol compliance, or at discretion of the participant.  Participants 
discontinued from a study will be reimbursed per visit for their active involvement in the study 
(including the initial screening visit  and all lens fitting visits ).  Upon discontinuing, a participant 
will be offered the option of their data being withdrawn from future statistical analysis. The 
following is a list of possible reasons for discontinuation from the study:  
• Screening failure: Participants will be discontinued if  they do not meet the inclusion and 
exclusion cr iteria outlined in section 5.2.3. 

EX-MKTG -130 BREAM  Protocol v 2.0 17nov2021  30 • Unacceptable performance with products to be used in study: Par ticipants may be 
discontinued if they are unable to achieve acceptable comfort and /or vision with the 
study products.  
• Positive slit lamp finding:  Participants may be permanently discontinued from the study 
depending on the severity of the condition and o n the j udgement of the investigator.   
• Adverse  event: If a participant experiences an adverse event during the study they may 
be discontinued based on the clinical judgement of the investigator.  
• Symptoms : If the participant has persistent symptoms,  they ma y be discontinued based 
on the clinical judgement of the investigator.  
• Disinterest, relocation or illness: The participant may choose to discontinue due to 
reasons within or beyond their control.  
• Violation of protocol or non -compliance:  The participant wi ll be discontinued if they are 
unable or unwilling to follow the protocol specified visit schedules  and/or study 
procedures . 
• Instillation of topi[INVESTIGATOR_94625]:  The participant will be discontinued if they elect 
to use a topi[INVESTIGATOR_94625] d uring the study  unless  that topi[INVESTIGATOR_516152] a limited duration (less than two weeks)  to treat a transient condition; in 
this case  the participant may remain an active participant (at the discretion of the 
investigator) after sto ppi[INVESTIGATOR_94627]).  
• Lost to follow -up:  The participant will be discontinued if they cannot be contact[CONTACT_234990], and if the investigator has made a reaso nable 
effort to contact [CONTACT_94656] a final study visit.  
• Premature termination of the study by [CONTACT_456], CORE  or Sterling IRB . 
A discontinuation form , stating the reason for discontinuation  will be completed, which requires 
the signatures of both the participant and the investigator  except where the participant is lost to 
follow -up in which case only the signature [CONTACT_94669] .   
When a participant cho oses to discontinue f rom the study , they will be given the opportunity to 
withdraw their data from the statistical analysis. This choice will be captured on the discontinuation 
form.  
EX-MKTG -[ADDRESS_669050] scheduled protocol visit a  study completion form  will be completed, which requires the 
signatures of both the participant and the investigator.  Participants will also be provided with a 
letter of appreciation .

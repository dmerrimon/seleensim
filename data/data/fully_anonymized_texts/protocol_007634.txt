Protocol NI -0501 -07 version 1.0, dated 12 Feb 2016  
 Background and Rationale  
Interferon gamma (IFN ) in secondary HLH  
HLH is a syndrome of severe immune activation and deregulation  characterized by [CONTACT_207021] , pro-inflammatory cytokine hypersecretion, hemophagocytosis, 
and tissue and organs damage. HLH occurs as either a pr imary ( pHLH, familial) or secondary 
(sHLH , sporadic ) disorder ( Henter et al. , 1998 ; Janka, 1983 ). pHLH is an autosomal recessive 
disease with an incidence of 1/50,000 live -born children  (Henter et al. 1991; Arico et al. 1996) . 
Patients often have a clear familial  inheritance or genetic mutation. pHLH is caused by 
[CONTACT_677247], Munc13 -4, syntaxin 11 , Munc18 -2 and 
other proteins involved in cytotoxic granule activation, polarization, priming, fusion, or function   
(Jordan et a l., 2011; Zhang et al.,  2014 ). These mutations  result in defective immune effector cell 
function, uncontrolled activation of histiocytes , and pathognomic  clinical manifestations of HLH.  
Secondary HLH often occurs as a result of pathological immune activat ion in response to a 
trigger. Frequently noted triggers include malignanc ies (especially hematological malignancies 
including acute leukemia’s  and lymphomas), infections (especially EBV) and rheumatologic  
disorders ( sJIA,  SLE). The list of triggers associa ted with secondary HLH is extensive ( Henter et 
al., 1997 ). Primary HLH is reported to be more frequent in childhood.  
The pathogenesis of secondary HLH remains  a matter of debate. Reports have recently described 
patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] M acrophage Activat ion Syndrome (MAS)  in the context of systemic 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) . These patients were  identified to be heterozygous for rare 
variants in the primary HLH -associated genes  (Zhang  et al.,  2014 ) highlighting potential  
etiological, clinical , and pat hological similarities between familial and acquired forms of HLH. A 
link between mutations in the perforin gene and predisposition to hematological malignancies has 
been described (Clementi  et al., 2005;  Zhang et al., 2014 ), further  supporting a possible 
contribution of hypomorphic mutations in HLH -related genes to the development of  M-HLH 
(Lehmberg 2015).  
Immune -activation and immune mediated path ology likely play a central role in the evolution of 
HLH. Secondary HLH is characterized by [CONTACT_677248], jaundice, adenopathy, rash, seizures, and focal neurologic

 deficits  as well as labora tory measures such as strikingly high serum levels of numerous 
cytokines including interferon gamma (IFN γ), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF -α), interleukin 6 (IL -
6), IL -10, and macrophage –colony -stimulating factor (M -CSF) ( Akashi et al., 1994; Ohga et al.,  
1993 ). Furthermore, biopsies of lymphoid tissues or histological examination of liver tissue from 
HLH pati ents reveal highly activated macrophages and lymphocytes, further supporting striking 
activation of the immune system. Secondary HLH carries  a significant mortality rate with 
approximately 10  to 30% of the diagnosed patients succumbing from the disease  (Celkan et al., 
2009; Minoia et al., 2014 ; Grom et al., submitted ). Categorizing patients into primary or 
secondary HLH based on clinical manifestations is often difficult and may be of limited value. 
Treatment should be initiated expediently if the  diagnosis  of HLH is suspected , regardless of the 
classification/trigger . 
Secondary HLH that develops in the setting of malignancy is also known as malignancy -
associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (M-HLH ). The majority of malignancies 
triggering secondary HLH in children and adults are lymphomas and leukemia. While primary 
forms of HLH are more common  in younger patients, M-HLH is more frequent  in adults  (Ramos -
Casals et al., 2014) . Machaczka et al.  (2011)  estimated that HLH affects 0. 9% of ad ults with 
hematological cancer, but the prevalence may be as high as  20% in patients with s pecific  types of 
B-cell lymphoma ’s (intravascular B-cell lymphoma  or B-cell lymphoma without peripheral 
adenopathies) and T -cell lymphoma (nasal natural -killer -cell or panniculitis -like subtypes ) 
(Ramos -Casals et al., 2014) . 
M-HLH may manifest during the treatment  (iatrogenic)  of a known malignancy or as the 
presenting feature of a yet undiagnosed malignancy  (non-iatrogenic) . It is postulated that the 
hyperinflammation is triggered by [CONTACT_677249] , due to an excessive  secretion of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines  by [CONTACT_677250] T -cell activating immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_677237]/lymphoma and eme rging for treatment of solid tumors (e.g. bispecific 
monoclonal antibody blinatumomab, CAR T -cell therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014])  (Hijiya et al., 2005; Teachey et al., 
2013; Lee et al., 2014) .

 patients (Celkan et al., 2009) . Indeed, similarly to primary HLH,  infections are often  identified  as 
co-trigger s in iatrogenic M -HLH .  
The clinical course of M-HLH is  often aggressive, and characterized by [CONTACT_677251] , which are 
further impacted  by [CONTACT_677252]. A  single center 
retrospective study in adults reported  only 1 of 8 patients surviv ed despi[INVESTIGATOR_677238] H 
and implementation of HLH directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (Machaczka et al., 2011) . A recent retrospective 
study in children and adolescents (n=27) reported a 6-month survival rate of 67%  in non-
iatrogenic M-HLH and 63% in iatrogenic M -HLH  (Lehmberg et al., 2015) . The group at MD  
Anderson Cancer Center  retrospectively identified pathologic hemophag ocytosis and/or 
lymphohistiocytosis in 61 adult patients with underling malignancies between 1991 -2001. Thrity 
five patients had additional systemic variables conferring a h igh suspi[INVESTIGATOR_168431] M -HLH. The 
median survival among the 35 patients was a dismal 1.5 months . The median survival was 1.2 
months among patients treated with HLH directed therapy as compared to 1.8 months among 
those not treated with HLH directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 3 1% of patients were alive at 6 -months  
(Tamamyam, Daver et al. ; manuscript submitted) . 
An effective therapeutic  approach to  M-HLH (iatrogenic and non -iatrogenic) remain s unknown . 
Of note is that  agents that are currently considered as standard  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_677239] (corticosteroids, 
etoposide) are often part of the  treatment of malignancies known to be able to cause M -HLH .  
Furthermore, the addition of etoposide, alemtuzumab, dexamethasone may induce worsening 
myelosuppression and immunodeficiency in patients wh o have an underlying malignancy a nd/or 
recent systemic therapy. A non -myelosuppressive and less immunosuppressive therapy would be 
an ideal approach to evaluate in M -HLH patients. A prompt initiation of an HLH -directed 
regimen (before or in combination wit h the malignancy -directed t herapy ) is of critical importance 
to decrease the high mortality rate in these patients. Furthermore, studies  have described the use 
of tocilizumab, an anti -IL-6R antibody, to manage cytokine release syndrome occurring after 
treatment with T -cell engaging therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (Barrett et al., 2014) . 
NI-0501 is a fully human anti -interferon gamma (IFNγ) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to 
and neutralizes IFNγ . NovImmune is developi[INVESTIGATOR_677240] -[ADDRESS_916103] targeted monoclonal

context of the NI -0501 : 
 Perforin knockout mice and Rab27 -defic ient mice develop all the diagnostic and many of 
the clinical and laboratory characteristics of human primary HLH when infected with 
lymphocytic  choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) as a trigger. Neutralization of the high 
circulating IFNγ levels in both animal m odels led to the reversal of HLH clinical and 
laboratory abnorma lities, and dramatically improved survival  in the animal model 
characterized by [CONTACT_207025] (pf p -/-  mice ) (Pachalopnik Schmid et al., 2009 , Jordan et 
al., 2004 ).  
 Repeated administration of CpG, causing TLR9 stimulation,  has been used to mimic a 
chronic severe hyperstimulation in he althy mice as a model of HLH secondary to 
infection. Although these mice do not necessarily die, they develop typi[INVESTIGATOR_207016] (Behrens et al., 2011) . Administration of an anti -IFNγ 
antibody  led to reversal of clinical and laboratory feat ures of HLH . Importantly , in this 
model it was demonstrated that administration of t he anti -IFNγ antibody also led  to full 
neutralization of IFNγ e ffects in relevant target tissues, such as liver and spleen ( Buatois 
et al, submitted ). 
 To study the physiopathology of sHLH in the context of rheumatic diseases, an animal 
model has been generated using IL -6 transgenic mi ce expressing high levels of IL -6, to 
mimic what occurs in patients with sJI A. When triggere d with TLR  ligands, these mice 
die with many of the  features of the human HLH (Stippoli et al. 2012) . In these mic e, 
when IFNγ was  neutralized by  [CONTACT_17814] a n anti -IFNγ antibody, survival wa s 
markedly improved and HLH laboratory p arameters reverted . 
In conclusion, in all presented animal experiments, IFNγ wa s demonstrated to be  a key 
pathological effector in d isease onset and progression.  
2. Primary and s econdary HLH patients have hypercytokinemia with elevated levels of several 
pro-inflammatory cytokines including IFNγ  (Henter et al., 1991; Janka et al., 1998; Xu et al.

 submitted ; Bracaglia et al. manuscript submitted ). The levels of CXCL9, CXCL10 and 
CXCL11, three chemokines known to be induce d by [CONTACT_20129]γ, were also significantly elevated. 
Noteworthy, levels of IFNγ and of the three IFNγ -inducible chemokines were found to 
significantly correlate with laboratory parameters of disease severity, such as ferritin, platelet 
count and transaminases . 
3. A Phase [ADDRESS_916105]  on all relevant 
clinical and laboratory features of HLH such as fever, splenomegaly, cytopenia, 
hyperferritinemia, hypofibrinogenemia, and also CNS signs/symptoms  (Jordan et al, 2015) . 
No animal models specific to  M-HLH  have been described  (Brisse et al., 2015) . The levels of 
IFNγ and other pro -inflammatory cytokines  at diagnosis and their correlation  with clinical 
evolution and severity of the HLH manifestations  during and after therapy have been  poorly 
characterized  for M -HLH . The fact that p rimary HLH  and HLH  secondary to 
inflammatory/autoimmune disease s or infection s have many pathophysiological and clinical 
features in common  with M -HLH , suggests that IFN γ might also play a key role in M -HLH.  The 
present  observational study is designed to provide a better understanding of the potential use of 
IFNγ and IFNγ-inducible chemokines as markers of M-HLH disease activity  and potential 
prognosis  and of the possible role of  IFNγ as a therapeutic target  in M -HLH , and to explore the 
genetic profile s in patients with M -HLH with regard to HL H-related genes .

Sample Size:  A minimum of 14 (maximum of 50) M-HLH patients  will be 
studied , including a minimum of 7 non iatro genic M -HLH and 7 
iatrogenic M -HLH. A control group of 10 patients with a diagnosis 
of hematological malignancy  in absence of  HLH  will also be 
evaluated.   
Study Population:  Male and female (adult and children) patients who are diagnosed 
with M-HLH  and that meet the inclusion criteri a listed below.   
In addition, patients with a diagnosis of hematological malignancy  in 
the absence of HLH will be included  as a control group .

Inflammatory markers will also be measured in a  group of control 
patients diagnosed with hematological malignancy in absence of  
HLH (as described above) . 
Data collection  may be performed retrospectively if sufficient 
clinical information is available to allow for a meaningful 
interpretation of the biomarker results.  
An approximate volume of 500 µl – 1 ml of serum or plasma is 
requir ed per time point. Whenever possible, serum (and not plasma) 
should be collected, as this is the preferred matrix for the biomarker 
analysis.  
In addition to the serum samples for the biomarker analysis, relevant 
information gathered by [CONTACT_677253] a 
data collection form.  This will include information on  the clinical 
presentation of M-HLH,  the type of underlying malignancy,  the date 
of onset of malignancy in relation to HLH manifestation s, treatment 
regimen prior to and/or ong oing at the time of M-HLH onset,  
laboratory parameters, M-HLH disease activity  (e.g. newly 
diagnosed, reactivat ion), specific HLH therapy  with best response to 
the therapy , other  concomitant medications , patient follow -up and 
disposition, stem cell transpl ant status, duration of response, and 
survival . Whenever possible,  collection of  serum  samples for 
biomarker analysis and relevant information should occur  at M-HLH 
diagnosis, at regular time intervals during the treatment course , at 
resolution and/or reac tivation of the disease.  
In addition to the above a minimum  of 1 ml of whole blood  will be 
collected (EDTA tubes) for genetic characterization  and 
identification  of the presence  of genetic  variants of the genes 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_677244] p rimary HLH.  A specific con sent for genetic 
testing must be given by [CONTACT_102].  Genetic samples may also be 
collected  from existing bank of samples  (frozen whole blood in 
EDTA or frozen extracted DNA) , if proper consent  has been 
obtained . 
Study Duration:  This study  collect s information on M-HLH patients  at diagnosis and 
during treatment of the disease , and will last until a minimum of 14

Statistical Analysis : All analyses are exploratory. Statistical analyses of the data c ollected 
in this study will be focused on providing tabular and graphical 
summaries of the levels of inflammatory markers and of the clinical 
features of the disease both at diagnosis and during the course of 
treatment. Level s of inflammatory markers will be compared 
between patients with active M -HLH and the control group (i.e. 
hematological  malignancy in absence of HLH). In addition, the 
degree  of correlation between  inflammatory markers , and between 
inflammatory m arkers and the severity of clinical manifestations, 
response to therapy, and survival of the patients  will be assessed . 
Analyses ma y also be performed to study the se relationships in 
various subgroups of patients, depending on the demographic , 
genetic  and clinical characteristics observed , including a posteriori  
diagnosis based on HLH -2004 diagnostic criteria (Henter et al., 
2007).  
Criteria for diagnosis are:  
i) Fever  
ii) Splenomegaly  
iii) Cytopenia (affecting ≥ 2 of 3 lineages in peripheral blood):  
 Hb <90 g/L (in infants < 4weeks: Hb<100 g/L)  
 Platelets<100 x 109/L 
 Neutrophils <1.0 x 109/L 
iv) Hypertriglycerid emia and/or hypofibrinogenemia: Fasting 
triglycerides ≥3.0 mmol/L ; Fibrinogen ≤1.5 g/L  
v) Hemophagocytosis in bone marrow or other specimens  
vi) Low or absence NK -cell activity (according to local laboratory 
reference)  
vii) Ferritin ≥ 500 µg/L  
viii) sCD25 ≥ 2400U/ml  
Medications:  Any medications that are consider ed necessary for the patient’s 
welfare are given based on the decision of the treating physician.  
Informed consent : 
 It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain written informed

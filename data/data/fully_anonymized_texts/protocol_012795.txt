3/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5PROTOCOL A MENDMENT, VERSION 5:
RATIONA LE
Protocol BP39207 has been amended to incorporate the following changes:
Clarification of positive Hepatitis B serology test results at screening (Section 4.2.3 
Exclusion Criterion #9 and laboratory assessments Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
As described in File Note #7 dated 14 March 2018, a positive result at screening for 
hepatitis B (HBV) is an exclusion criterion. Patients with a positive result for 
Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg +) at screening are not eligible for this study, as 
thestudy participant presents an active form of the disease and is infected. Results 
for hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) included in laboratory tests at screening 
inform about medical hepatitis B history. Positivity for anti -HBc (HBcAb +) together 
with a n egative HBsAg (HBsAg -) points towards an immune signature [CONTACT_445441] a clinically significant hepatic disorder at screening as per investigator 
assessment. 
Therefore, t he test result for t otal he patitis B core antibody (HBcAb) does not 
contribute to determination of eligibility but will continue to be performed for medical 
history purposes. This has now been clarified in the laboratory assessments section 
(Section 4.6.1. 6).
Clarification of exclusionary ALT/AST/bilirubin results (Section 4.2.3 Exclusion 
Criterion #8) .
As described in File Note #8 dated 5 April 2018: Theformatting and syntax of the
protocol have been revised tomore clearly reflect that the following findings
exclude patients from participation:
–Elevated ALT and/or AST results > 2 ULN incombination withelevated
bilirubin>ULN.
–Elevated serum creatinine >1.5 ULN
Thefollowing findings donotconstitute areason toexclude patients from
participation, unless considered clinically significant by[CONTACT_29256] :
–Anisolated ALT and/or AST result > 2 ULN
–Anisolated bilirubin result > ULN
Use of saliva test for alcohol (Section [IP_ADDRESS])
The protocol has been updated to show that alcohol may be tested using either 
urine or saliva. 
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
5/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5Additional minor changes and corrections have been made to improve clarity and 
consistency. Substantial new information appears in italics. 
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
7/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5Figure [ADDRESS_566487] will be up to 34 weeks (from 
screening through completion of the last the last follow -up visit): [ADDRESS_566488] -phase , 24-week treatment period with study drug ,
and 4 -week follow -up period.
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy  IMC
Once approximately 90 patients , with a minimum of 30 patients per treatment arm (in 
case the 240 mg BID dose is stopped, patients in the 120 mg BID group will be added to 
the count of patients in the high dose group) have completed at least 12 weeks of 
treatment, an defficacy IMC (consisting of the members of the safety IMC along with the 
study translational medicine leader, a senior [COMPANY_002] clinical representative independent 
from the study team, a pharmacometrician, and others who will be involved in the 
decision -making process as needed) will conduct an interim analysis for futility on the 
primary endpoint of the study. The committee will review and evaluate the data 
unblinded at the group level (including global clinical impression and changes in positive 
and negative symptomatology, safety data and PK results if available), and the decision 
will be taken to either continue the study unchanged, to stop one arm or to end the study.
Descriptions of the conduc t of the analysis, including pre -defined success criteria for the 
efficacy interim analysis, are summarized in Section 6.10 and will be described in further 
detail in a separate Efficacy IMC Agreement Document.
4.2.2 Inclusion Criteria
1.Male or female subj ects aged between 18 and 50 years.
2.Able to participate and willing to give written informed consent .

14.Subjects with a history of poor compliance in the last 2 years.
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
9/Protocol BP39207 , Version 54.4.2 Dosage andAdministration
The study medication is two stick -packs taken orally, twice daily (in the morning and in 
the evening within 30 minutes of a meal) over 24 weeks. Granules should be mixed with 
or sprinkled onto a small amount soft food (i.e., yogurt, apple sauce, or pudding) and all 
of the food consumed to ensure accurate dosing. oras an alternative, patients have the 
option of placing the granules directly into their mouth followed by [CONTACT_445384] a 
glass of water. (Note: the granules must not be mixed with water before putting them
intothe mouth).
On Study Day 1, the first dose of medication will be administered in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_445321]/study center once all pre -dose assessments have been conducted and eligibility 
has been confirmed. For all subsequent study visits, the morning dose will be taken at 
the study center. The last dose of medication will be the morning dose, administered at 
the clinic/stud y center at Week 24 visit.
Patients will be provided with a sufficient amount of medication to cover study treatment 
until the next site visit (including some overage). The qualified individual responsible for 
dispensing the study drug supply will prepare the correct medication supply required as 
instructed by [CONTACT_445385]. This individual will write 
the date dispensed and Patient Number on the study drug label and on the Drug 
Accountability Record. This individual will also record the study drug batch or lot number 
received by [CONTACT_445386]. 
Guidelines for treatment interruption or discontinuation are provided in Section 3.1.2 and 
Section 4.7.1.
[IP_ADDRESS] Medication adherence sy stem
The patient’s capacity t o comply with taking twice daily study medication will be 
assessed during the screening period ,between Baseline [ADDRESS_566492] atform (“Platform”) a web based platform/an app 
(provided on a smartphone) . A compliance report will be made available to support the 
PI’s assessment of the patient’s capacity to comply with the study requirements (refer to 
Section 4.2.2, “Inclusion Criteria”).
This trial will employ a medication adherence monitoring platform (“Platform”). The 
Platform will either be provided to a patient preloaded on a smartphone, or if possible 
the patient may download the Platform onto their own smartphone . Patients will receive 
a medication reminder at a time within a pre-defined window to take their medication. 
Patients will follow a series of prescribed steps using the front -facing camera in front of 
the front facing webcam of the smartphone to confirm patient i dentity and medication to 
be taken. The patient has to confirm ingestion of medication manually as well as the 
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
10/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5chosen dosing method (i.e. ,soft food vs. direct intake) as soon as the platform has been 
updated to include this functionality . In addition, bui lt-in reminders and a 
communication system allows real -time intervention in case of non- compliance. Use of 
this Platform will in no way supersede or replace the physician and/or prescribed 
medication protocol. Because the Platform does not change the medication protocol, but 
rather encourages adherence, use of this Platform presents minimal risk to the patients.
4.5.1 Permitted Therapy  
Concomitant therapy includes any medication, e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter 
(OTC) drugs, approved dietary and herbal supplements, nutritional supplements and any 
non-medication interventions (e.g., individual psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral 
therapy, smoking cessation therapy, and rehabilitative therapy) used by a patie nt from 
screening until the follow -up visit. All concomitant medications should be reported to the 
Investigator and recorded on the Concomitant Medications electronic Case Report Form 
(eCRF).
All medication administered to manage AEs (including extrapyrami dal symptoms such as 
dyskinesia or akathisia) should also be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.
Allowed concomitant therapy, including medications used for the treatment of 
stable chronic medical conditions other than schizophrenia that are allowed, must b e on 
a stable dosing regimen for 6 weeks prior to screening and remain stable throughout the 
study (from screening to last follow -up visit. Dose adjustments that are required as part 
of routine treatment to control the chronic condition (such as dose adjus tments of 
insulin or anti -hypertensive medication) are permitted. Any changes in antipsychotic 
therapy, for management of worsening of symptoms or initiation of additional 
pharmacotherapy including antidepressant after randomization may be permitted on a 
case by [CONTACT_413], in consultation between the PI [INVESTIGATOR_117404]/Sponsor. 
The reason for such changes should be appropriately documented.
4.5.2 Prohibited Therapy
 
 
Diphenhydramine
Diphenhydramine is not permitted because of potential cardiac effects .

RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
11/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5Dofetilide
Dofetilide use is not permitted because of the potential for interaction between 
basmisanil and renally -cleared cationic drugs, as well as the very narrow therapeutic 
window of dofetilide. 
Anticholinergic medications
Anticholinergic (e.g. ,benztropi[INVESTIGATOR_050], biperiden, or trihexyphenidyl) are prohibited during the 
trial due to potential negative impact on cognition and the potential to interfere with the 
study primary endpoint. Anticholinergics prescribed as prophylaxis trea tment for 
extrapyramidal symptoms need to be washed -out prior to enrollment. If deemed 
necessary by [CONTACT_978], beta blockers (e.g. propranolol) can be prescribed instead.
Clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], Diphenhy dramine, Direct oral anticoagulants (dabigatran etexilate, 
edoxaban, api[INVESTIGATOR_445322]) and Colchicine
Not permitted in this study.
4.6.1. 5Laboratory  Assessments
Normal ranges for the study laboratory parameters must be supplied to the Sponsor 
before the study starts. Laboratory safety tests shall be collected at time-points specified 
in the Schedule of Assessments (Appendix 1).
Additional blood or urine samples may be taken at the discretion of the Investigator if the 
results of any test fall outside the reference ranges, or clinical symptoms necessitate 
additiona l testing to monitor patient’s safety. Where the clinical significance of abnormal 
lab results is considered uncertain, screening lab tests may be repeated before 
randomization to confirm eligibility. If there is an alternative explanation for a positive 
urine or blood test for drugs of abuse, e.g., previous occasional and acute intake of a 
medication or food containing for example, codeine, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_260047], the test 
could be repeated to confirm washout. Furthermore, in case of a positive test fo r a drug 
of abuse at screening, that can be explained by [CONTACT_445387] -medication 
(seeSection 4.5.1), a positive result at screening is not systematically exclusionary and 
will be evaluated on a case by [CONTACT_413].
In the event of unexplained abnormal clinically significant laboratory test values, the 
tests should be repeated immediately and followed up until they have returned to the 
normal range and/or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found. Results of 
clinical labora tory testing will be recorded on the eCRF or be received as electronically 
produced laboratory reports submitted directly from the local or central laboratory.
Samples collected before dosing or from patients on placebo are to be taken as a 
precautionary m easure and may not be analyzed in the first instance.
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
12/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5Samples for the following laboratory tests will be sent to one or several central 
laboratories or to the Sponsor for analysis. Instruction manuals and supply kits will be 
provided for all central laboratory assessments.
Hematology (leukocytes, erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, differential 
count [neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, other cells]).
Serum chemistry (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, gluc ose, urea, 
creatinine, protein, albumin, phosphate, calcium, total and direct bilirubin, ALP, ALT, 
AST, urate, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]).
Coagulation (international normalized ratio [INR], activated partial thromboplastin 
time [aPTT], prothrombin test [ PT]).
Viral serology
oHIV (specific tests HIV -1 antibody, HIV -1/2 antibody, HIV -2 antibody).
oHepatitis B (surface antigen (HBsAg determines HBV positivity whereas 
total hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) will be tested for but results do 
not contribute to el igibility assessment.)
oHepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).
Total hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb).
oHepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody. In cases where hepatitis C was 
successfully treated, a positive HCV serology result can be followed by 
[CONTACT_445388]
Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (cholesterol, low -density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, high -density lipoprotein 
[HDL] cholesterol, triglycerides).
Pregnancy test: All women of childbearing potential (including those who have had a 
tubal ligation) will have a blood or urine pregna ncy test as outlined in the Schedule 
of Assessments (Appendix 1). 
Drug and alcohol screen:
Urine or saliva drug screen will be performed at time points indicated in Appendix 1. 
Agents tested for are at a minimum : opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], amphetamines, cocaine, 
hallucinogens, PCP, and cannabis and alcohol. An alcohol breath saliva test can be 
performed at any time during the study at the PIs discretion.
Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_445323]: Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_445324] 1 (see Section 4.5.2 on use of GABA APAMs). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Screening and Pre -treatment A ssessments
Written informed consent for participation in the study must be obtained before 
performing any study ‑specific screening tests or ev aluations. Informed Consent Forms 
for enrolled patient s and for patients who are not subsequently enrolled will be 
maintained at the study site.
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
13/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5An Evaluation to Sign Consent (ESC) form will be used to ensure patients' 
understanding of the study. The form consists of [ADDRESS_566493] 10 out of a 
possible 12 in order to participate in the study. It may be necessary to review the 
consent documents with the patient multiple times and repeat the ESC to ensure this 
degree of comprehension (maximum of 3 times). 
All screening and pre -treatment assessments must be completed and reviewed to 
confirm that patients meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator will maintain a screening 
log to record details of all patients screened and to confirm eligib ility or record reasons 
for screening failure.
6.3.[ADDRESS_566494] 12 weeks of treatment. The analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_445389] [IP_ADDRESS] .
This analysis will focus on the change from baseline to Week 12 in MCCB 
neurocognitive composite score, which will be analyzed using an MMRM m odel which 
will be similar to that described for the primary analysis (including all stratification factors 
although this may not be possible depending on the actual cell size). The pairwise 
comparison of each active dose to placebo will be evaluated using the es timated effect 
size based on the least -squares mean (LSM) estimates from the MMRM models. For 
each dose arm, the decision whether to continue or drop the arm for the remainder of 
the study will be based on the posterior conditional probability that the true treatment 
effect size for that arm is0.35. If the calculated conditional posteri probability is less 
than 20% that the true treatment effect size can reach this threshold for one of the two 
doses, then that dose arm may be discontinued. If thisconditional posterior probability 
is less than 20% for both dose arms, then the study may be discontinued for futility. A 
informative prior will be used for the posterior probability calculations.
In case the calculated conditional posteri proba bility that the true treatment effect size 
can reach the threshold of effect size > 0.35 is more than 20% for both treatment arms, 
one treatment arm may still be discontinued. 
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
14/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5Further analysis details on the interim analysis will be documented in a separa te 
Efficacy IMC Agreement Document prior to the conduct of the interim analysis.
8.2Informed Consent
The Sponsor’s sample Informed Consent Form (and ancillary sample Informed Consent 
Forms such as a Child’s Assent or Caregiver's Informed Consent Form, if applicable) will 
be provided to each site. If applicable, it will be provided in a certified translation of the 
local language. The Sponsor or its designee must review and approve any proposed 
deviations from the Sponsor's sample Informed Consent Forms or any alternate consent 
forms proposed by [CONTACT_779] (collectively, the “Consent Forms”) before IRB/EC 
submission. The final IRB/EC ‑approved Consent Forms must be provided to the 
Sponsor for Health Authority submission purposes according to local requirements.
In this study, the informant will be asked to provide information useful to assess patient 
eligibility and to complete clinician rated scales. A separate written informed consent will 
be obtained from the informant.
The Consent Forms must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_12718]’s legally 
authorized representative before his or her participation in the study. The case history or 
clinical records for each patient shall document the informed consent process and that 
written informed consent was ob tained prior to participation in the study.
In this study, the Investigator or Designee shall assess the capacity of the patient to give 
informed consent while discussing the study and the Consent Forms. This assessment 
shall be confirmed by [CONTACT_445390] (see Inclusion Criteria Section 4.2.2) 
and the IQ measure (see Exclusion Criteria #6, Section 4.2.3) done during the Screening 
Visit.

STUDY DESIGN
Description of Study
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, parallel group, placebo -controlled, Phase IIb 
study, to evaluate the effects of 24 weeks of basmisanil treatment in stable patients with CIAS 
treated with antipsychotics . 
The final analysis will investigate the PK, safety and tolerability, and efficacy  of 24 weeks of 
basmisanil treatment on cognition and functioning .
Two doses of basmisanil (240 mg, 80 mg) will be tested against placebo. Approximately 231
patients will be randomized to one of three tr eatment arms, in a 1:1:1 ratio:
Arm 1: 240 mg BID (may  be lowered to 120 mg BID upon Safety Internal Monitoring 
Committee [IMC] decision).
Arm 2: 80 mg BID.
Arm 3: Placebo BID.
Randomization will be stratified based on age, sex and “schizophrenia cognitive subty pe”. The 
stratification threshold for age will be 35 years and 35 years. The “schizophrenia cognitive 
subtype” will be determined at screening based on the difference between the pre -morbid 
intelligence quotient (IQ), estimated by [CONTACT_445395] (W RAT)-[ADDRESS_566502] score, and current full scale IQ score s(FSIQ), estimated by [CONTACT_445396] – second edition (WASI-II).
The study will be divided into 3 phases:
A screening phase of approximately 5 weeks which includes Baseline 1 and Baseline 2 
visits .
A double -blind treatment phase with study drug, of approximately 24 weeks.
A follow -up phase of approximately 4 weeks after treatment discontinuation.
Efficacy , safety, and PK assessmen ts will be conducted throughout the study, as detailed in the 
Schedule of Assessments.
Patients will be treated until the end of the study treatment period, unacceptable toxicities, or 
withdrawal of consent.
NUMBER OF PA TIENTS
A total of up to 231patient s will be enrolled in the study, to ensure that a minimum of 
150patients (50 patients per treatment arm) will have evaluable data at 24 weeks . They will be 
randomized 1:1:1 to the three study arms. The sample size may  be increased if the actual 
premature withdrawal rate is higher than expected.

STATISTICA L METHODS
PRIM ARY ANAL YSIS
The primary  analysis population for all efficacy analy ses will be based on the ITT population, 
which will include all randomized patients treated with study medication. The primary efficacy 
endpoint (change from baseline to W eek 24 in MCCB neurocognitive c omposite score) will be 
analyzed using a mixed effect model for repeated measures (MMRM) with treatment, region, 
age group, sex, schizophrenia cognitive subtype, and visit as fixed effects, treatment -by-visit 
interaction term, and baseline value as the cov ariate. The model will include subject as a 
random effect, and incorporate an unstructured variance- covariance matrix. For each active 
dose arm tested at the final analysis, this model will be used to test the null hypothesis of no 
treatment difference bet ween the placebo arm and the active arm at a 2- sided -level of 0.1.
SAFETY A NALYSES
All safety analy sis will be based on the safety analysis population.
As appropriate, listings, summary  tables and graphs will be provided for safety  and tolerability 
asse ssments, including:
Incidence of AEs (overall, by [CONTACT_445398]).
Incidence of SAEs.
Incidence of laboratory abnormalities (including hematology, clinical chemistry, and 
urinaly sis parameters).
Incidence of blood pressur e (BP) abnormalities.
Incidence of ECG abnormalities as well ECG changes as compared to baseline 
measurements.
Changes in the PANSS as compared to baseline.
NOSIE -30 as compared to baseline.
Changes in C -SSRS as compared to baseline.
Safety data will be su mma rized using descriptive statistics using the safety analysis population, 
which will include all patients treated .
PHARM ACOKINETIC A ND PHA RMACODYN AMIC ANALYSES
Individual and mean plasma concentrations at each sampling time- point will be presented by 
[CONTACT_445399], including means, medians, geometric means, 
ranges, standard deviations, and coefficients of variation. Individual and mean plasma 
concentration versus time data will be plotted on semi -logarithmic scales.
Graphi cal exploration of the relationship between basmisanil (and M1 and other metabolites, if 
relevant), exposure and outcome measures as well as safety parameters will be performed. If 
indicated by [CONTACT_445400], more formal analyses of PK to pharmacodynami cs (PD) 
parameters of interest may  be undertaken .
PATIENT -REPORTED OUT COM E ANALYSES
The patient reported outcomes are:
Change from baseline on the patient -reported health -related quality of life scale (SQLS) .
Change in subjective mood, sleep and subjective well -being and cognitive functioning 
ratings.
These endpoints will be analyzed using an MMRM model similar to that described for the 
primary  endpoint, and summarized using descriptive statistics.
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
28/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5EXPLORA TORY A NALYSES
The exploratory analyses will include:
Mean change from baseline in the PANSS factor and total scores.
Mean change from baseline in the BNSS subscales and total scores.
Mean change from baseline in % of patients rated as “ready to work” on the W oRQ.
Mean change from baseline in th e VRFCAT score.
Mean change from baseline in the CFAS score.
Semantic priming analysis of verbal fluency, as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Primacy region analysis of epi[INVESTIGATOR_445331]. Percentage recall from the 
primacy  relative to the r ecency  region will be calculated for each learning trial and for long-
delay free recall. 
Analysis of genetic PRS and complement C4 CNV as described in Section 3.2.3, and the 
15q11 -q13 chromosomal region including the GABRs GABRB3, GABRB5 and GABRG3 
genes.
These endpoints will be analyzed using an MMRM or ANCOVA model as appropriate, and 
summarized using descriptive statistics.
SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION
A sample size of 50 patients per arm provides 80% power to detect a treatment effect size of 
0.5, at a 2 -sided -level of 0.1, for the pairwise comparison of each active dose arm to placebo. 
No adjustments for multiple comparisons will be incorporated into the analysis. Incorporating an 
assumed premature rate of 35%, a study sample size of 231(77patients per arm) will be used. 
The sample size may be increased if the actual premature rate is higher than expected.
Interim A nalyses
An interim analy sis will be conducted when approximately [ADDRESS_566511] 12 weeks of treatment. The analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_445401].
This analysis will focus on the change from baseline to Week 12 in MCCB neurocognitive 
composite score, which will be analyzed using an MMRM model which will be similar to that 
described for the primary  analysis (including all stratification factors although this may not be 
possible depending on the actual cell size). The pairwise comparison of each active d ose to 
placebo will be evaluated using the es timated effect size based on the least -squares mean 
(LSM) estimates from the MMRM models. For each dose arm, the decision whether to continue 
or drop the arm for the remainder of the study will be based on the conditional probability that 
the true treatment effect size for that arm is0.35. If the calculated conditional probability is 
less than 20% that the true treatment effect size can reach this threshold for one of the two 
doses, then that dose arm may be d iscontinued. If this conditional probability is less than 20% 
for both dose arms, then the study may  be discontinued for futility. 
In case the calculated conditional probability that the true treatment effect size can reach the 
threshold of effect size > 0.35 is more than 20% for both treatment arms, one treatment arm 
may still be discontinued. 
Further analysis details on the interim analysis will be documented in a separate Efficacy 
IMC Agreement Document prior to the conduct of the interim analysis.
LIST OF PROHIBITED MEDICA TIONS

30/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5Diphenhydramine
Diphenhydramine is not permitted because of potential cardiac effects .
Dofetilide
Dofetilide use is not permitted because of the potential for interaction between basmisanil and 
renally -cleared cationic drugs, as well as the ver y narrow therapeutic window of dofetilide. 
Anticholinergic medications
Anticholinergic (e.g. benztropi[INVESTIGATOR_050], bi periden, or trihexyphenidyl) are prohibited during the trial 
due to potential negative impact on cognition and the potential to interfere with the study 
primary  endpoint. Anticholinergics prescribed as prophylaxis treatment for extrapyramidal 
symptoms need to be washed -out prior to enrollment. If deemed necessary by [CONTACT_978], beta 
blockers (e.g. propranolol) can be prescribed instead.

35/Protocol BP39207 , Version 51. BACKGROUND AND RA TIONALE
1.1 BACKGROUND ON DISEA SE
Schizophrenia is a heritable condition characterized by [CONTACT_445402], so -called positive 
symptoms, negative symptoms and cognitive deficits. Both negative symptoms and 
cognitive deficits are major determinants for  functional outcome ( Green 2000 ). Cognitive 
deficits are often present before onset of psychosis ( Reichenberg et al 2010 ) and are not 
treated by [CONTACT_445403] a factor underlying cognitive deficits ( Keefe et al 1999, 
Minzenberg and Carter 2012 ). Therefore, there is a high need for effective treatments for 
cognitive deficits associated with schizophre nia. Key cognitive deficits in schizophrenia 
involve functions that are mediated by [CONTACT_445404], memory, executive functions and attention. Preclinical, imaging and recent 
human electrophysiological and functional imaging studies have demonstrated the 
interdependence of hippocampal and prefrontal abnormalities and alterations in 
hippocampal -prefrontal interactions in individuals with schizophrenia ( Sigurdsson and 
Duvarci 2016).
Gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central 
nervous system. Numerous studies have consistently shown cortical GABAergic 
inhibitory circuits to play a pi[INVESTIGATOR_445335]. In primates, the maturation of cortical GABAergic 
circuitry extends into late adolescence and early adulthood, and thus, coincides with the 
vulnerable period for schizophrenia onset. It has therefore been argued that the 
neuropathology of schizophrenia may include abn ormal post-natal development of the 
GABAergic systems and result in the emergence of symptoms during adolescence when 
the GABAergic system undergoes critical maturational changes ( Lewis et al 2004 ). 
Indeed, dysfunction of GABA -mediated neurotransmission i n schizophrenia is supported 
by [CONTACT_447]-mortem findings that included abnormalities in interneuron numbers, GABA A
receptor binding activity on pyramidal neurons and GAD67 expression ( Benes et al 
2015 ). In addition, it has been postulated that these deficits converge on a common 
pathological mechanism that involves N -methyl -D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor 
hypofunction and oxidative stress ( Hardingham and Do 2016 ). NMDA receptors are 
essential for several forms of synaptic plasticity and play a critical role in learning and 
memory ( Paoletti et al 2013). One of the key models of the pathophysiology of 
schizophrenia in recent years has been the theory of NMDA receptor hypofunction –
postulating that deficient signaling through this receptor underlies key deficits and 
symptoms of schizophrenia, including cognitive impairme nts (Coyle 2012 ).
1.2 BACKGROUND ON BA SMIS ANIL
Basmisanil (RO5186582) is a novel negative allosteric modulator (NAM) of GABA type A 
(GABA A) receptors which combines both binding and functional selectivity at the GABA A
5 subunit -containing receptors. At the time of writing, basmisanil is in clinical 
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
36/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5development for the treatment of intellectual disability associated with Down syndrome 
(DS). Clinical development is also being initiated in stroke recovery and a Phase IIa 
study in stroke recovery patients is planned.
Among the different GABA Areceptor subtypes, GABA A5 subunit -containing receptors
are preferentially localized in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, key regions in the 
physiopathology of schizophrenia. This receptor subtype plays a key modulatory role in 
cognition ( Collinson et al 2002 , Crestani et al 2002). They are located at the base of 
dendritic spi[INVESTIGATOR_445336] ( Möhl er and Rudolph 2004 ). Thus, they modulate a key receptor 
involved in learning and memory which provides a mechanistic explanation on why 
GABA A5 NAMs improve cognition in mice ( Dawson et al 2006 , Martinez -Cue et al 
2013 ), rats ( Ballard et al 2009 ), non -human primates ( Ballard et al 2009 ) and humans 
(Nutt et al 200 7). As memory and learning are among the key functions deficient in 
schizophrenia, treatment with GABA A5 NAMs can be expected to ameliorate these 
deficits.
In addition, consistent with the modulation of NMDA signaling by [CONTACT_59716] A5 receptor 
activity, GABA A[ADDRESS_566512] been shown in recent studies to improve cognitive 
impairment in preclinical models of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction. Specifically, a 
GABA A[ADDRESS_566513] recognition (NOR) test –a 
classical test of memory -and attentional set -shifting induced by [CONTACT_445405], respectively ( Redrobe et al 2012). 
Moreover, other GABA A5 NAMs attenuated MK -801 induced deficits in an incremental 
repeated acquisition task ( Povroznik et al 2014 ), and in the NOR and Morris -Water Maze 
(MWM) tasks ( Stamenic et al 2015 ). Therefore, the strong evidence for a key role of 
GABA A5 recepto rs in cognitive functioning, particularly functions that depend on the 
integrity of hippocampal and prefrontal circuits, suggests that negative modulation of 
GABA A5 receptors by [CONTACT_59716] A5 NAMs such as basmisanil may represent an effective 
treatment option for cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia.
See the Basmisanil Investigator’s Brochure for further details on non -clinical and clinical 
studies.
1.2.1 Previous Non -Clinical Studies
[IP_ADDRESS] Non- Clinical Pharmacology
In vitro, basmisanil was shown to be a potent NAM at the GABA A532 receptor 
subtype with both binding and functional selectivity. Basmisanil exhibited more than 90 -
fold binding selectivity for the human GABA A5 receptor subtype compared to GABA A
1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 subunit containing receptors. In the Ts65Dn mouse model of 
Down syndrome which shows pronoun ced cognitive deficits, basmisanil rescued the 
deficit in Long- Term Potentiation (LTP) observed in hippocampal slices of these animals, 
demonstrating its ability to indirectly enhance NMDA receptor function.
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
39/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5At the time of writing, basmisanil is currently being tested in a Phase II study in adults 
and adolescents with Down syndrome (BP27832; “CLEMATIS”) and a second study in 
children with Down syndrome aged 6 -11 years (WP27860). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety  and Tolerability
The highest doses employed in the single -ascending dose (SAD) study (BP25129, 
1250 mg) and in the MAD studies (W P25366, 1000 mg BID; BP25543, 370 mg BID) did 
not reach the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Across clinical studies, no adverse event 
(AE) pattern has emerged that would be regarded as characteristic of basmisanil. 
In the MAD st udy W P25366 and in the drug -drug interaction (DDI) study with 
itraconazole (W P29402), there was a signal for an initial, mild increase in heart rate and 
BP that became less apparent whilst dosing up to steady -state was continued. These 
cardiovascular obser vations were not reproduced in subjects with Down syndrome 
(BP25543); however, the data were too variable to exclude a possible cardiovascular 
effect. 
Prolongation of mean QTcF intervals was observed in Study W P29402 in which 
basmisanil 240 mg BID was co -administered with itraconazole resulting in a 4 -to 5-fold 
increase in basmisanil plasma concentrations. No relevant AE pattern of basmisanil 
emerged in this study. A mean increase in heart -rate corrected QT interval using 
Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) of 4. 5 and 9.5 milliseconds (ms) was seen around the time to 
maximum plasma concentration (T max) of basmisanil following 10 days of co -
administration of basmisanil 120 mg BID and 240 mg BID, respectively, with itraconazole. 
In subjects with normal hepatic clear ance of basmisanil (e.g., in the absence of 
moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or absence of impaired liver function), no relevant 
increase in QTc can be assumed. 
Across clinical studies, increased serum creatinine concentrations were found with 
higher basmisanil doses. However, individual values typi[INVESTIGATOR_445337]. 
Furthermore, they were not associated with changes of other glomerular filtration rate 
(GFR) markers, i.e., iohexol clearance and cystatin C in serum. Thus, the elevations in 
serum creatinine are likely related to inhibitory effects of basmisanil on the tubular 
creatinine transporters as shown in vitro . Of note, the magnitude of the serum creatinine 
incre ase matches the fraction of creatinine clearance through tubular secretion and such 
increases returned to normal shortly after treatment stop.
Of note, non -selective GABA A 5 NAMs may be associated with side -effects related to 
interaction with GABA A1, 2, and [ADDRESS_566514], basmisanil is a highly selective GABA A 5 NAM and previous 
clinical trials did not reveal a basmisanil -related alert for such side- effects. In particular, 
electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring did not reveal treatment emergent epi[INVESTIGATOR_445338]5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd

1.3.[ADDRESS_566515] established an important role for 
rare (less than 1% in frequency) and large (more than 100 kilobase) copy number 
variants (CNVs) in the etiology of this disorder ( Malhotra & Sebat 2012 ). Among the 
susceptibility loci identified, the 15q11 -13 duplication was found to confer high- risk for 
schizophrenia ( Malhotra & Sebat 2012 , Rees et al 2014 ). This is a complex locus that 
contains, amongst others, a cluster of three GABA Areceptor subunit genes (GABR): 
GABRB3, GABRA5 and GABRG3 which encode GABA Areceptor subunits 3, 5, and 
3, respectively. The duplication is believed to lead to an abnormal overexpression of the 
respective subunits. In addition, genetic variation across these particular GABR subunit 
genes has also been associated with schizophrenia risk ( Huang et al 2014 , Beneyto et al 
2011 ) and the severity of psychotic symptoms ( Sun et al 2012, Bergen et al 2009 ) 
providing additional support for an inv olvement of abnormalities in these GABA subunits 
in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.
As detailed above, GABA A5 subunit -containing receptors are preferentially localized in 
the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex -key regions implicated in the physiopathology of 
schizophrenia and in particular, in cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. They 
are expressed at the base of dendritic spi[INVESTIGATOR_445339] ( Möhler and 
Rudolph 2004 ). This provides a mechanistic explanation on why GABA A5 NAMs 
impro ve cognition in rodents ( Dawson et al [ADDRESS_566516] et al 2009 ), 
non-human primates ( Ballard et al 2009 ) and humans ( Nutt et al 2007). 
As reviewed in more detail in Section 1.2, the assumed improvement of NMDA signaling 
by [CONTACT_59716] A5 NAMs can pla usibly explain the amelioration of cognitive impairment in 
preclinical models of NMDAR dysfunction. Therefore, the strong evidence for a key role 
of GABA A5 receptors in cognitive functioning, particularly functions that depend on the 
integrity of hippocampal and prefrontal circuits, suggests that negative modulation of 
GABA A5 receptors by [CONTACT_59716] A5 NAMs such as basmisanil may represent an effective 
treatment option for cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia.
1.3.2 Benefit -Risk A ssessment
Overall, in all clinical studies, basmisanil has been found to be safe and well -tolerated at 
the doses used in this trial without relevant effects on laboratory parameters. A trend for 
longer QTcF intervals at concentrations higher than achieved with the dose selected for 
this study (240 mg BID per oral) was observed. However, no rele vant QTcF prolongation 
can be assumed for concentrations generated with a 240 mg BID dosing regimen in 
subjects with normal hepatic clearance of basmisanil (e.g., in the absence of moderate 
or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or absence of impaired liver function) . Patients with 
schizophrenia may be receiving atypi[INVESTIGATOR_445340]. W hile it is not assumed that basmisanil 
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
42/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5will act synergistically with such antipsychotics on QTc, QTc inte rval will be monitored at 
the initiation of basmisanil treatment to address this risk.
Results obtained in preclinical models of schizophrenia have led to the hypothesis that 
positive rather than negative modulators of the GABA A 5 receptor could be benefi cial 
for control of positive symptoms of schizophrenia ( Lodge and Grace 2011 ). Thus, a 
theoretical risk for GABA A 5 NAMs to worsen psychotic symptoms could be inferred. 
However, when basmisanil was tested in clinical trials, even at high doses, no 
pro-psychotic liability emerged from AE reporting. Initiation of basmisanil treatment 
during an in- patient stay allows the management and evaluation of this theoretical and 
small risk. 
Overall, the risk to patients with schizophrenia treated with basmisanil is considered 
small.
As outlined abov e, the unmet medical need for effective treatment for cognitive 
impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS) is enormous. Given the potential of 
basmisanil to significantly improve cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, the potential 
benefit to future pat ients, including those participating in this trial, would be significant. 
Thus, overall, the benefits outweigh the risks associated with basmisanil treatment.

3.1.1 Overview  of Study  Design
Two doses of basmisanil (240 mg, 80 mg) will be tested against placebo. Approximately 
231 patients will be randomized to one of three treatment arms, in a 1:1:1 ratio:
Arm 1: 240 mg BID (may be lowered to 120 mg BID upon Safety Internal Monitoring 
Committee [IMC] decision , see Section 3.1.3 ).
Arm 2: 80 mg BID.
Arm 3: Placebo BID.

expected. 
Randomization will be stratified based on age, sex and “schizophrenia cognitive 
subtype”. The stratification threshold for age will be   35 years and   35 years. The 
“schizophrenia cognitive subtype” will be determined at screening based on the difference between the pre-morbid intelligence quotient (IQ), estimated by [CONTACT_445395] (WRAT)-[ADDRESS_566518] score, and current full scale IQ scores (FSIQ), estimated by [CONTACT_139820] – second 
edition (WASI-II) as shown on Figure 1 .

The study will be divided into 3 phases (Figure 2 ): 
 A screening phase of approximately 5 weeks  which includes Baseline 1 and 
Baseline 2 visits . 
 A double-blind treatment phase with study drug  of approximately 24 weeks. 
 A follow-up phase of approximately 4 weeks after treatment discontinuation. 
 
Efficacy, safety, and PK assessments will be conducted throughout the study, as 
detailed in the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix 1 ). 
Patients will be treated until the end of the study treatment period, unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal of consent.

in the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix 1), under the column “in -patients only”. 
Patients will be discharged on an individual basis at the Principal Investigator’s (PI’s) 
discretion, after a minimum of 7 days of treatment. The safety IMC will decide when 
newly enrolled patients can be started on study medication on an outpatient basis (see 
Section 3.1.3 for more details on the safety IMC).

3.1.3 Internal Monitoring Committees (IMCs)
This study will utilize a safety IMC and an efficacy IMC. All data analysis for the safety 
IMC and efficacy IMC reviews will be perfo rmed by [CONTACT_445406].
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety  IMC
A [COMPANY_002] safety IMC will have safety oversight responsibility for the in -patient treatment 
part of this study. This safety IMC will consist of:
A clinical scientist, separate from the project team and who does not interact with 
the sites on a regular basis.
A clinical safety physician separate from the project team and who does not interact 
with the sites on a regular basis.
A clinical pharmacology leader who may be fr om the project team, but does not 
interact with the sites on a regular basis.
The study statistician.
The safety IMC will review and evaluate the unblinded safety data AEs, ECG, vital signs, 
global clinical condition and changes in symptomatology (and PK r esults if available), 
after 10, [ADDRESS_566522] reached one week of in -patient 
treatment. At any of these reviews of the safety data, the safety IMC will decide if further 
in-patient monitoring is needed for the subsequent patients en rolled or whether the study 
can be safely conducted with out -patient visits. Screening and enrollment should not be 
stopped. Participants who had started the in -patient period will remain as in- patient to 
finish the 1 -week period. After patient 40, newly r andomized subjects will participate as 
in-patients until the Sponsor indicates that sites are clear to randomize subjects as 
outpatients.
The safety IMC will specifically assess the changes from baseline in the ECG 
parameters (HR, QRS, QTcF), looking for a dose -response effect among cohorts or a 
correlation with exposure. 
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
47/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5The AE profile as well as any evidence of emerging or worsening psychotic or other 
symptoms gleaned from validated instruments implemented (such as the positive and 
negative syndrome scal e [PANSS] or the Nurse’s Observation Scale for In -patient 
Evaluation -30 items Scale [NOSIE -30]) will be carefully examined across cohorts by 
[CONTACT_445407].
The safetyIMC will also review the concomitant anti -psychotic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_445344] s looking for DDIs or safety concerns based on the AE profile, ECG parameters 
and vital signs. 
In case of clinically significant safety findings in the 240 mg cohort including a report of a 
Serious Adverse Reaction (SAR) attributable to basmisanil, QTcF v alues above 
480msec or an increase of QTcF of60msec from baseline, suspected seizure activity, 
or significant worsening of the underlying schizophrenia, the safety IMC can advise to 
stop enrolling in this cohort and to discontinue the patients in the [ADDRESS_566523] dose (240 mg BID) would from then 
on be randomized to 120 mg BID treatment. The safety IMC can reinsti tute the in-patient
monitoring for patients randomized to 120 mg BID with reviews after 10, 25 and 40 
patients to ensure the safety of the 120 mg BID dose in the schizophrenia patient 
population treated on an out-patient basis. Additional details may be fo und in the Safety 
IMC Agreement Document.
All safety data obtained during outpatient treatment in this study will be reviewed 
throughout the study by [CONTACT_21411] a treatment -blinded manner.
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy  IMC
Once approximately [ADDRESS_566524] 12 weeks of treatment, an 
efficacy IMC (consisting of the members of the safety IMC along with the study 
translational medicine leader, a senior [COMPANY_002] clinical representative independent from 
the study team, a pharmacometrician, and others who will be involved in the decision -
making process as needed) will conduct an interim analysis for futility on the primary 
endpoint of the study. The committee will review and evaluate the data unblinded at the 
group level (including safety data and PK results if available), and the decision will be 
taken to either continue the study unchanged, to stop one arm or to end the study.
Descriptions of the conduct of the analysis, including pre -defined success criteria for the 
efficacy interim analysis, are summarized in Section 6.[ADDRESS_566525] Observation 
(LPLO) occurs. LPLO is expected to occur approximately [ADDRESS_566526] patient.

As the time- course of potential cognitive effects is unknown and may not follow the 
known trajectory of symptomatic improvement, a study duration of six months was 
chosen as it is assumed that six months will provide enough time for any potential 
cognitive and functional effects to emerg e. 
3.2.1 Rationale for Dosage Selection
 
 These doses thus 
differentiate from one other and ensure that biologically r elevant occupancy ranges are 
fully covered. 
In addition, in a recently completed study (BP27832; “ CLEMATIS” ) for the treatment of 
intellectual disability associated withDown syndrome, a dose of [ADDRESS_566528] 3 months.
Cognitive impairment is a prominent feature of schizophrenia, with more than 80% of 
patients exhibiting deficits. The pattern of cognitive deficits associated with 
schizophrenia does not significantly differ between males and females. Both sexes are 
hence eligible for this study. 
Multiple lines of evidence suggest that neuroplasticity and the capacity to learn are a 
function of age, which decrease in later adulthood. It is therefore hypothesized that the 
potential cognition -enhancing effects of basmisanil may be more readily detected in 
younger adults. As cognitive remediation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_445345] 50 years, the upper age limit of 
50years has been selected for this study. 
3.2.3 Rationale for Biomarker A ssessments
An individual’s genetic profile may predict response to GABA A5 NAM treatment, 
providing the opportunity to better understand the pathophysiology of CIAS and to 
develop a t reatment response stratifier. Specifically, single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) have been identified which are both associated with an increased risk for 
schizophrenia ( Purcell et al 2009) as well as enhanced plasticity, GABA -or 
glutamatergic functioning, and cognitive functioning ( Ripke et al 2014 ), and in 
non-clinical populations, SNPs whi ch are associated with enhanced hippocampal -

RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
49/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5dependent epi[INVESTIGATOR_445346] ( Debette et al 2015) and general cognitive 
functioning ( Davies et al 2015, 2016 ). The genetic profile corresponding to these SNPs 
can be quantified with a polygenic risk score (PRS), which weighs each SNP’s allelic 
frequency with the respective genome -wide association studies (GW AS)odds ratio. 
Additionally, CNV of complement system C4A an d C4B short and long forms have also 
been associated with an increased risk for schizophrenia and decreased hippocampal -
dependent cognitive functioning ( Sekar et al 2016 ). This study will therefore collect blood 
for analyses with standard SNP arrays and digital droplet polymerase chain reaction to 
determi ne whether the PRS and C4 CNVs, respectively, predict treatment response 
(i.e., change in MCCB neurocognitive composite score and other outcome measures) to 
basmisanil.

RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
54/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5Emergency  Unblinding:
As per Health Authority reporting requirements, the Sponsor will break the treatment 
code for all unexpected serious adverse events (SAEs; see Section 5.1) that are 
considered by [CONTACT_66325].
The PIs will receive a set of sealed treatment codes. If the identity of the test medication 
needs to be known in order to manage the patient’s condition, the treatment code for 
that patient may be broken.
In the event of an emergency, the treatment code for an individual patient will be readily 
available to the Investigator and Sponsor through the interactive (voice/web) response 
system (IxRS).
All such occurrences should be documented in the study file. Treatment codes should 
not be broken except in emergency situations and, if possible, the responsible scientific 
leader should be contact[CONTACT_445409]. At the final monitoring visit, the 
unused treatment codes will be counted and checked and a statement to the effect that 
all are intact (or not as the case may be) will be made by [CONTACT_2037]; this statement will 
be included or referred to in the final study report. All treatment codes will be returned to 
[COMPANY_002].
Whenever disclosure of the identity of the test medication is necessary, adeq uate 
procedures will be in place to ensure integrity of the data. Any unblinding, at the 
investigating site end, will be documented in the study report with date, reason for 
identifying the drug and the name(s) of all the person(s) who had to be unblinded.
4.4 STUDY TRE ATMENT
4.4.1 Formulation, Packaging, and Handling
The study drug basmisanil will be provided in an immediate -release granule formulation 
packaged in sachets (“stick -packs”) containing [ADDRESS_566537] and local regulations.

RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
55/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5Upon arrival of investigational products at the site, site personne l should check them for 
damage and verify proper identity, quantity, integrity of seals and temperature conditions,
and report any deviations or product complaints to the monitor upon discovery.
For further details, see the Basmisanil Investigator’s Brochure .
4.4.2 Dosage andAdministration
The study medica tion is two stick -packs taken orally, twice daily (in the morning and in 
the evening within 30 minutes of a meal) over 24 weeks. Granules should be mixed with 
or sprinkled onto a small amount soft food (i.e., yogurt, apple sauce, or pudding) and all 
of thefood consumed oras an alternative, patients have the option of placing the 
granules directly into their mouth followed by [CONTACT_445384] a glass of water .
(Note: the granules must not be mixed with water before putting them into the mouth) .
On Study Day 1, the first dose of medication will be administered in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_445321]/study center once all pre -dose assessments have been conducted and eligibility 
has been confirmed. For all subsequent study visits, the morning dose will be taken at 
thestudy center. The last dose of medication will be the morning dose, administered at 
the clinic/study center at Week 24 visit.
Patients will be provided with a sufficient amount of medication to cover study treatment 
until the next site visit (including so me overage). The qualified individual responsible for 
dispensing the study drug supply will prepare the correct medication supply required as 
instructed by [CONTACT_445385]. This individual will write 
the date dispensed and Patient Number on the study drug label and on the Drug 
Accountability Record. This individual will also record the study drug batch or lot number 
received by [CONTACT_445386]. 
Guidelines for treatment interruption or discontinuation are provi ded in Section 3.1.2 and 
Section 4.7.1 .
4.4.3 Medication A dherence and Engagement Systems
[IP_ADDRESS] Medica tion adherence sy stem
The patient’s capacity to comply with taking twice daily study medication will be 
assessed during the screening period ,between Baseline 1 and Baseline 2 visits . 
Patients will be asked to take placebo medication and to report each int ake using a 
medication adherence monitoring platform (“Platform”) provided on a smartphone. A 
compliance report will be made available to support the PI’s assessment of the patient’s 
capacity to comply with the study requirements (refer to Section 4.2.2 , “Inclusion 
Criteria”).
Patients will receive a medication reminder at a time within a pre-defined window to take 
their medicat ion. Patients will follow a series of prescribed steps using the front -facing 
camera of the smartphone to confirm patient identity and medication to be taken. The 
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
56/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5patient has to confirm ingestion of medication manually as well as the chosen dosing 
method ( i.e.,soft food vs. direct intake) as soon as the platform has been updated to 
include this functionality .In addition, built -in reminders and a communication system 
allows real -time intervention in case of non -compliance. Use of this Platform will in no 
way supersede or replace the physician and/or prescribed medication protocol. Because 
the Platform does notchange the medication protocol, but rather encourages adherence, 
use of this Platform presents minimal risk to the patients.
After local determination by [CONTACT_436253], only data 
indicating whether or not the patient has properly taken the medication will be 
transferred to a secure centralized location. No video recordings or pi[INVESTIGATOR_445349]. The captured 
data is reviewable through a roles -and rules -restricted Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) -compliant system ensuring privacy of the information and 
only accessible to authorized personnel through two -way authentication.
Phone numbers of the patients will be collected and stored in an encrypted manner, 
allowing for direct communication to each patient from the system in an automated 
manner, or by [CONTACT_436254]. Individuals not part of the 
study staff will not know the identity of study patients and will have no access to any 
medical or health records of the patients.
Patients who are found to regularly not take their medication will be contact[CONTACT_445410].
[IP_ADDRESS] Optional patient engagement sy stem
Patients will also have the option to use a patient engagement application, referred to as 
a smartphone “App”.
The App is an optional service that patients can opt -in to use to remind them of 
activities/tasks relevant to study compliance, such as when to attend site visits. The App 
also provides supportive guides to help patients be aware of visit procedures, study 
information and instructions.
The App’s interactive features are intended to be a companion to the user during the 
course of a trial and inc lude the following modules:
Study Information: targeted study information throughout the duration of the study.
Visit Schedule: site visit reminder as predefined in the Schedule of Assessments.
Goals: ability to implement study defined or personal goal tar gets (e.g., exercise, 
sleep, etc.).
Reminders: reminders for activities/task relevant to study compliance.  
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
57/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5Notes: journal functions for self -tracking information.
The App is available for down load to patients’ smartphone devices that support iOS and 
Android. The app will contain study -specific information only once activated by a patient. 
The study coordinator will provide the patient with a secure activation code, which they 
can use to activate the app upon their first use.
The App does not collect any patient identifiable information or clinical data. This app is 
intended for informational purposes only. It is not a substitute for professional medical 
advice. Patients should contact [CONTACT_445411] s or concerns.
4.4.[ADDRESS_566538] A ccountability
All investigational medicinal products (IMPs) required for completion of this study 
(basmisanil and placebo) will be provided by [CONTACT_1034]. The investigational site will 
acknowledge receipt of IMPs, to confirm the shipment condition and content. Any 
damaged shipments will be replaced.
The Investigator is responsible for the control of drugs under investigation. Adequate 
records of the receipt (e.g., Drug Receipt Record) and disposition (e.g., Drug Dispensing 
Log) of the study drug must be maintained. The Drug Dispensing Log must be kept 
current and should contain the following information:
The identification of the Patient to whom the study drug was dispensed (for example, 
patient initials and date of birth).
The date(s), quantity of the study drug dispensed to the Patient when out-patient .
The date(s) and quantity of the study drug returned by [CONTACT_445412]-patient .
All records and drug supplies must be available for inspection by [CONTACT_941] R oche Monitor 
[at every monitoring visit].
IMPs will either be disposed of at the study site according to the study site’s institutional 
standard operating procedure or returned to the Sponsor with the appropriate 
documentation. The site's method of IMP de struction must be agreed upon by [CONTACT_429]. Local or institutional regulations may require immediate destruction of used 
investigational medicinal product for safety reasons. In these cases, it may be 
acceptable for investigational study site staff to de stroy dispensed investigational 
product before a monitoring inspection provided that source document verification is 
performed on the remaining inventory and reconciled against the documentation of 
quantity shipped, dispensed, returned, destroyed and provi ded that adequate storage 
and integrity of drug has been confirmed. 
The site must obtain written authorization from the Sponsor before any IMP is destroyed, 
and IMP destruction must be documented on the appropriate form.

The Sponsor does not intend to pr ovide basmisanil or other study interventions to 
patients after conclusion of the study or any earlier patient withdrawal.
4.5 CONCOMITA NT THERA PY AND FOOD
4.5.1 Permitted Therapy  
Concomitant therapy includes any medication, e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter 
(OTC) drugs, approved dietary and herbal supplements, nutritional supplements and any 
non-medication interventions (e.g., individual psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral 
therapy, smoking cessation therapy, and rehabilitative therapy) used by a patie nt from 
screening until the follow -up visit. All concomitant medications should be reported to the 
Investigator and recorded on the Concomitant Medications electronic Case Report Form 
(eCRF).
All medication administered to manage AEs (including extrapyrami dal symptoms such as 
dyskinesia or akathisia) should also be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.
Allowed concomitant therapy, including medications used for the treatment of chronic 
medical conditions other than schizophrenia that are allowed, must be on a stable 
dosing regimen for 6 weeks prior to screening and remain stable throughout the study 
(from screening to last follow -up visit). Dose adjustments that are required as part of 
routine treatment to control the chronic condition (such as dose adjustment s of insulin 
or anti -hypertensive medication) are permitted. Any changes in antipsychotic therapy, 
for management of worsening of symptoms or initiation of additional pharmacotherapy 
including antidepressant after randomization may be permitted on a case b y case basis, 
in consultation between the PI [INVESTIGATOR_117404]/Sponsor. The reason for such 
changes should be appropriately documented.

Modulators of CYP3A [ADDRESS_566541] the PK of basmisanil. 
Following inhibition of CYP3A4 with itraconazole (study W P29402), the systemic 
exposure (146 gh/mL) and maximum plasma concentration (14.5 g/mL) of 240 mg 
BID basmisanil was 4.7 -and 4.1 -fold higher, respectively. This was associated with a 
maximum mean QTcF increase of 11.6 msec (90% CI: 5.3 to 17.9). These medications 
which are prohibited include:
Moderate or strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., itraconazole, erythromycin, 
fluconazole, nefazodone, ritonavir, verapamil, grapefruit or grapefruit juice). 
Inducer s of CYP3A4 (e.g., rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], pi[INVESTIGATOR_051], rifampin, 
modafinil, systemic glucocorticoids, St John’s Wort. (Please refer to Appendix 3for 
a more detailed list of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers).
–For inducers of CYP3A4, the washout window rule is to stop treatment 30 days 
or 5 half -lives prior to study drug administration, whichever is longer.
In case concomitant medication s are needed that are moderate or strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors, the patient should be withdrawn from the study. 
Methods of administration which do not produce appreciable systemic drug exposure 
(e.g., topi[INVESTIGATOR_445352]) are permitted.

Diphenhydramine
Diphenhydramine is not permitted because of potential cardiac effects .
Dofetilide
Dofetilide use is not permitted because of the potential for interaction between 
basmisanil and renally -cleared cationic drugs, as well as the very narrow therapeutic 
window of dofetilide. 
Anticholinergic medications
Anticholinergic (e.g. benztropi[INVESTIGATOR_050], bi periden, or trihexyphenidyl) are prohibited during the 
trial due to potential negative impact on cognition and the potential to interfere with the 
study primary endpoint. Anticholinergics prescribed as prophylaxis treatment for 
extrapyramidal symptoms need to be washed -out prior to enrollment. If deemed 
necessary by [CONTACT_978], beta blockers (e.g. propranolol) can be prescribed instead.
4.6 STUDY ASSESSMENTS 
4.6.1 Description of Study  Assessments
At each visit, assessments and examinations will be conducted as described in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix 1).
The first approximately [ADDRESS_566542] week of dosing. During this 
period, additional assessments will be conducted as described in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Appendix 1). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Medical and Psy chiatric History  and Demographic Data
Medical history includes clinically significant diseases, prior medical interventions 
(e.g., surgeries), smoking/substance use history and prior functional status. All 
medication (e.g., prescription drugs, OTC drugs, herbal/homeopathic rem edies, 
nutritional supplements) used by [CONTACT_25701] [ADDRESS_566543] recent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].

RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
62/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5Demographic data collected will include age, sex and race/ethnicity (as reported by [CONTACT_445413]). The number of years of education completed by [CONTACT_445414].
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Ex aminations
A general physical exam will be performed as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Appendix 1). 
Any abnormality identified should be recorded on the Medical History eCRF. Any new or 
worsened clinically significant abnormality should be reported as AEs on the Adverse 
Events eCRF. Height and weight will be recorded, and BMI will be calculated.
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs
Vital signs will incl ude measurements of temperature, PR, and SBP and DBP while the 
patient is in a seated position after the patient has been resting for approximately [ADDRESS_566544] blood draw. W hen possible, the same arm should be used for all 
BP measurements.
BP, PR, and body temperature will be recorded at the time -points specified in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix 1).
BP and PR measurements should be obtained in a quiet room at a comfortable
temperature, with the patient's arm unconstrained by [CONTACT_43979]. All 
measurements will be obtained from the same arm and, with the same cuff size, using a 
well-calibrated automatic instrument with a digital readout, throughout the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiograms
Triplicate ECG recordings (i.e., three useful ECGs without artifacts) will be obtained
within approximately 2- 5 minutes at each specified time -point as listed in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Appendix 1). The average of the three readings will be used to determine 
ECG intervals (e.g., PR, QRS, QT). W henever possible, the same brand/model of a 
standard high -quality, high -fidelity electrocardi ograph machine equipped with computer -
based interval measurements should be used for each patient. The conditions should be 
as close as possible to pre -dose time -points; this includes but is not limited to food 
intake, activity level, stressors and room te mperature.
To minimize variability, it is important that patients be in a resting position 
for10minutes prior to each ECG evaluation. Body position should be consistently

distractions (e.g., television, radio, conversation) should be avoided during the pre -ECG 
resting period and during ECG recording. ECGs should be performed prior to meals and 
any scheduled vital sign measurements and blood draws. In some cases, it may be

For safety monitoring purposes, the Investigator or designee must review, sign, and date 
all ECG tracings. Paper or electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_8775] k ept as part of the patient’s 
permanent study file at the site. ECGs will be reviewed by a central laboratory.
ECG characteristics, including heart rate, QRS duration, and PR, and QT intervals, will 
be recorded on the eCRF. QTcB (Bazett’s correction), QTcF (Fridericia’s correction) and 
RR will be calculated by [CONTACT_1034]/recorded on the eCRF. Changes in T ‑wave and 
U-wave morphology and overall ECG interpretation will be documented on the eCRF. 
T-wave information will be captured as normal or abnormal, U -wave information will be 
captured in two categories: absent/normal or abnormal.
[IP_ADDRESS] Laboratory  Assessments
Normal ranges for the study laboratory parameters must be supplied to the Sponsor 
before the study starts. Laboratory safety tests shall be collected at time-points specified 
in the Schedule of Assessments (Appendix 1).
Additional samples may be taken at the discretion of the Investigator if the results of any 
test fall outside the reference ranges, or clinical symptoms necessitate additional testing 
to monitor patient’s safety. W here the clinical significance of abnormal lab results is 
considered uncertain, screening lab tests may be repe ated before randomization to 
confirm eligibility. If there is an alternative explanation for a positive test for drugs of 
abuse, e.g., previous occasional intake of a medication or food -containing for example, 
codeine, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_260047], the test could be repeated to confirm washout.
Furthermore, in case of a positive test for a drug of abuse at screening, that can be 
explained by a prescribed and permitted co -medication ( seeSection 4.5.1 ), a positive 
result at screening is not systematically exclusionary and will be evaluated on a case by 
[CONTACT_445415], the 
tests should be repeated immediately and followed up until they have returned to the 
normal range and/or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found. Results of 
clinical laboratory testing will be recorded on the eCRF or be received as electronically 
produced laboratory reports submitted directly from the local or central laboratory.
Samples collected before dosing or from patients on placebo are to be taken as a 
precautionary measure and may not be analyzed in the first instance.

Mini International Neuropsy chiatric Interview
The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) ( Sheehan 1998 ) is a structured 
diagnostic interview designed to meet the need for a short but accurate structured 
psychiatric interview for multicenter clinical trials. It is a method of organizing a 
psychiatric interview to make sure all relevant diagnoses are considered. The MINI has 
been validated against the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM diagnoses. The 
interview with the patient will be conducted by a trained psychiatrist. Administration time 
is approximately [ADDRESS_566545] 4 (WRA T-4) –Reading Test
The W RAT-4 (Wilkinson et al 2006 ) reading test measures basi c reading skills. The test 
covers ages from [ADDRESS_566546] will be audio- and video -recorded at Screening Visit for quality control 
purposes. The patient’s face will not be visible on the recordings. 
Wechsler A bbreviated Scale of Intelligence –Second Edition (WA SI-II) 
The W ASI-II is an intelligence test designed to estimate IQ in individuals aged 6 to 90 
years ( Wechsler 2011 ). The FSIQ score of the four -subtest form will be derived based 
on the total combined performance on the Vocabulary, Similarities, Block Design and 
Matrix Reasoning subtests. A Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI) (Vocabulary and 
Similarities subtests) and a Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI) (Block Design, Matrix 
Reasoning subtests) will also be derived. The W ASI-II four subtest form should take 
approximatel y 30 minutes to administer.
MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB)
The MATRICS initiative has established a regulatory pathway for the use of the MCCB
as cognitive outcome measure in CIAS clinical trials. This comprehensive cognitive 
battery provides a relatively brief evaluation of cognitive domains relevant to 
schizophrenia and related disorders ( Nuechterlein et al 2008). It was designed to 
measure seven cognitive domains:
 Speed of processing: Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) 
symbol -coding; TMT -A; Cat egory Fluency: animal naming.
 Attention/vigilance: Continuous Performance Test (including identical pairs).
 Working Memory: Spatial Span, Letter Number Span.
 Verbal learning and memory: Hopkins Verbal Learning Test -Revised.
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
66/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5 Visual learning and memory: Bri ef Visuospatial Memory Test.
 Reasoning and problem solving: Maze Test.
 Social cognition: Emotional Intelligence Test.
Composite scores for each cognitive domain described above, as well as the 
neurocognitive composite score, which includes all but the soc ial cognition domain, will 
be derived. The MCCB takes between [ADDRESS_566547] will also be recorded (i.e. “has the MCCB ever been administered to the 
subject before?”, “if yes, how many times and date of last administration”).
The MCCB testing will be audio -and video -recorded at each visit for quality control 
purposes and for the purpose of obtaining measures of semantic priming (see Semantic 
Priming below). Of note, the patient will not be visible on the recordings. 
The time of the MCCB testing should as far as possible remain the same throughout the 
study visits (i.e. +/ -30 minutes around the time recorded at the baseline 1 visit), 
preferably before the lunch meal.
Primacy  and Recency Region Effects in Epi[INVESTIGATOR_445354] –Revised (see MCCB), the number of correctly 
recalled words in the immediate condition from the primacy (initial 25% of items) and 
recency (last 25% of items) regions will be noted and supplied to the Sponsor for 
analyses of learning and recall performance from the primacy and recency regions. 
Seman tic Priming
Audio recording of the category fluency test (see MCCB), Category Fluency: Animal 
Naming will be provided to the Sponsor for semantic fluency analysis of consecutively 
produced words.
Trail Making Test (TMT)
The TMT consists of two parts: Trai l making Part A, which is a part of the standard 
MCCB and Trail making Part B additionally included in this study. Circles containing 
numbers (Part A) or both numbers and letters (Part B) must be sequentially connected. 
The total score is the time spent to complete each part. TMT -A involves attention, visual 
search, motor functioning, and working memory and TMT -B additionally involves 
executive function. The difference (ratio) in performance between Part A and Part B 
reflects executive processes and will be used to assess executive functioning including 
cognitive set shifting abilities. This test should take 5 minutes to complete.

67/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5Wechsler Memory  Scale -Fourth Edition, Verbal Paired A ssociates (WMS 
IV-PAL)
The paired associates learning (I and II) of the WMS -IV (Wechsler 2009) is a test of 
verbal learning and memory that re quires the subject to learn novel word pairs. The 
subject learns the word pairs across learning trials and is asked to recall them 
immediately (PAL I) or after a 30 -minute delay (PAL II). This test should take 
approximately [ADDRESS_566548] (WMS IV-LM)  
Logical memory (LM)assesses narrative memory under free -recall condition s. Two 
short stories are presented orally. The examinee is asked to retell each story from 
memory immediately after h earing it (LM I). In the delayed condition (LM II), the 
examinee is asked to retell both stories from the immediate condition ( delayed free 
recall). Each story contains 25 scorable units of information . Different stories will be used 
across visits : both W MS-IV LM stories will be presented at screening, while 2 different 
Sullivan LM (2005) stories will be administered at each of the following LM visits (i.e. 
baseline, week 12 and week 24). This test take sapproximately 10 minutes to complete.
Clinical Global Impression –Severity  (CGI- S) and Improvement (CGI -I)
The CGI ( Guy 1976 ) is one of the most commonly used outcome measures in 
psychopharmacology clinical trials. The CGI is the general name [CONTACT_436304]: the CGI -
Severity scale (CGI- S), which measures global severity of illness at a given point in time 
and the CGI improvement scale (CGI -I), which measures change from the baseline state 
at following visits. The CGI rating scale permits a global evaluation by [CONTACT_445416]’s improvement over time. The CGI -S is a 7 -point scale ranging from 1 (no 
symptoms) to 7 (very severe). The CGI -I is a seven- point scale, ranging from 1 (very 
much improved) to 7 (very much worse).
Personal and Social Performance scale (PSP)
The PSP ( Morosini et al 2000 ) is a scale developed on the basis of the social functioning 
component of the DSM -IV Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale 
(SOFAS). The PSP is a 100- point, single- item rating scale subdivided into [ADDRESS_566549]’s functioning four main 
areas: 1) socially useful activities; 2) personal and social relationships; 3) self -care; and 
4) disturbing and aggressive behaviors.
Virtual Reality  Functional Capacity  Assessment Tool (VRFCA T)
The VRFCAT ( Ruse et al 2014, Keefe et al 2016) is a virtual reality shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_445355] a windows computer. Prior to the performance of the task, a brief tutorial 
version of the VRFCAT, including a mouse usage tutorial administered with a short 
recipe. This tutorial (15 min) needs to be administered to al l participants, regardless of 
their statements regarding computer familiarity. The task has several linked and 
sequential scenarios, including matching a recipe to the content of kitchen cabinets, 
preparing a shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_321579], taking the correct bus, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_445356], and catching the
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
68/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5correct return bus. These tasks are performed in a fixed sequence. Multiple forms of the 
VRFCAT exist; two versions (1 or 4) will be administered alternatively. All data are 
collected by [CONTACT_6449].
Once the task is launche d, it operates itself continuously until the end of the procedure. 
As with all computerized assessments, the tester will be required to remain vigilant in 
order to ensure that the participant is continuously engaged in the task. This test should 
take approximately 30 minutes to complete.
University  of Miami Computerized Functional A ssessment Sy stem (CFA S)
The CFAS consists of four computerized simulations administered on a Windows PC. 
These simulations include ATM Banking, Telephone Voice Prescription Refil l, Transit 
Ticket Purchase, and Doctors Visit. Data are collected automatically by [CONTACT_445417]. At each testing session, a demographic 
information collection process takes place. Once each task is launched, there is no more 
input from the tester unless the task needs to be interrupted.
ATM Task: In this task, the participant engages in a series of banking transactions, 
including enter a PIN, choosing a language, checking balances, transferring money, and 
withdrawa ls. The task administers the banking tasks in a fixed order and the task ends 
itself when the participant reaches the end.
Refill Task: In this task, the participant uses a telephone keypad to access a voice menu 
to refill two prescriptions. The participan t is asked to select a language, enter the 
prescription number, and choose a time for pi[INVESTIGATOR_9107]. The process is repeated for the 
second prescription.
Transit Ticket Purchase: In this task, the participant uses a ticket kiosk to make a series 
of purchases in r esponses to situational requirements. The individual is asked to 
purchase single and multi -day tickets and to reload a fare card. Each of these task 
requirements is presented on the computer screen and the participant makes response 
selections following th ose instructions.
Doctor’s Visit: In this task, a simulated doctor’s visit occurs with five prescriptions being 
provided to the participant. The participant then is asked a series of questions about the 
prescriptions. They then are presented with a package insert for a new medication and 
asked questions about it. Next, they are asked to prepare a day’s worth of pi[INVESTIGATOR_14704] a 
medication organizer. The task ends with the doctor providing information about the next 
visit and querying the participant regarding the requirements for that visit.
All subjects are expected to attempt all aspects of the tasks. For participants who claim 
no experience, the task serves as a problem -solving and skills -learning exercise.
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
69/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5Note that the CFAS should be administered after the VRFCAT, because the VRFCAT 
has a mouse -use tutorial. The familiarity questionnaire should be completed in all cases, 
including reported familiarity with each task in the real world as well as experience with 
computers. The CFAS should take approximately 15 minutes to complete.
Work Readiness Questionnaire (WoRQ)
The W oRQ v4.0 ( Potkin et al 2016 ) captures the patient’s capacity to initiate and 
maintain useful activity that could merit pay –or work readiness –as evaluated by [CONTACT_4677]’s ability to conduct daily activities, interact with others and adhere to treatment, 
as well as on others’ perceptions of patient appearance, behavior, and impulse control. 
The questionnaire is composed of 7 items gr aded “strongly agree,” “agree,” “disagree,” 
or “strongly disagree,” to be completed using progress notes, medical records and input 
from informants, leading to a final dichotomous work readiness judgment, independent 
of current work status. The W oRQ requir es an average completion time of < 5 minutes.
Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale (SCoRS)
The SCoRS ( Keefe et al 2015 ) is an interview -based 20 -item rating scale of daily 
functioning related to cognitive impairment that involves both patients and informants. 
Each it em is rated on a 4 -point scale. The SCoRS comprises an assessment of cognitive 
functioning based on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_445357], and an interviewer’s 
decisions about which source of information is more reliable for each item and the global
rating (1-10). SCoRS total scores have been shown to be strongly correlated with 
cognitive performance, functional outcome, and functional capacity in stable patients 
with schizophrenia. The SCoRS should take approximately 20 minutes to administer.
Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS)
The BNSS ( Strauss et al 2012) is a 13 -item instrument designed for clinical trials that 
measures the severity of negative symptoms in 5 domains (subscales): blunted affect, 
alogia, asociality, anhedonia, and avolition. All ratings are based on a semi -structured 
interview with prompts and queries. Items are rated on a 7 -point (0 -6) scale, with anchor 
points ranging from the symptom being absent (0) to severe (6). Subscale scores as well 
as a total score will be derived. This test should take approximately 10- 15 minutes to 
complete.
Positive and Negative Sy ndrome Scale (PA NSS)
The PANSS is a 30 -item rating scale which evaluates positive, negative and other 
symptoms in patients with schizophrenia ( Kay et al 1987 ). The Positive Scale assesses 
the features exhibited in schizophrenia that are not present in those with a normal 
mental state. The Negative Scale assesses features that are absent in schizophrenia but 
that would be present in those with a normal mental state. Other sub -scales assess 
other aspects of schizophrenia including the overall severity of the disorder and the risk 
of aggression. Each item is rated on a 7 -point scale (1 absent, 7 extreme). A total 
score as well as subscale and factor scores will be derived. It takes approximately 40 
minutes to administer.

The Schizophrenia Quality of Li fe Scale - Revision 4 (SQLS-R4) 
The SQLS is a schizophrenia-specific quality of life self-report questionnaire ( Wilkinson 
et al 2000 ). It is intended to assess the psychosocial level (e.g., depressive mood, lack 
of social interactions etc.)  and vitality level (e.g., lack of energy, tiredness, poor memory 
etc.) of patients with schizophrenia. The SQLS-R4 ( Martin & Allan 2007 ) is the 4th 
revision made to the SQLS to improve its psychometric properties. It contains 33 items 
covering two domains: psychosocial (20 items) and vitality (13 items), scored using a Likert-type format. It takes 5-10 minutes to complete. 
Nurses’ Observation Scale for In-p atients Evaluation (NOSIE-30) 
The NOSIE-30 ( Honigfeld et al 1966 ) is a sensitive ward behavior rating scale, designed 
to assess the behavior of patients on an in-patient unit and is an accurate means of systematically assessing patient status and change from baseline in a clinical trial setting. The scale is rated based on continuous observation, according to the frequency of occurrence of 30 designated behaviours. Six factor scores are obtained: Social Competence, Social Interest, Personal Neat ness, Irritability, Manifest Psychosis, and 
Retardation as well as a composite score. This scale will be administered by [CONTACT_445419]-patients only. 
Extrapyramidal Symptoms Evaluation (ESRS-A) 
The presence and severity of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) will be evaluated using the ESRS-A ( Chouinard et al 2005 ). The ESRS-A is a 28-item scale, designed to 
objectively and comprehensively measure EPS. The ratings will be made through a combination of a clinical interview, as well as motor examination by a trained research 
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd

approximately 10 minutes. 
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C- SSRS)
The assessment of suicidality will be collec ted for all patients using the C -SSRS ( Posner 
et al 2011 ). The C -SSRS is a tool used to assess the lifetime suicidality of a patient 
(C-SSRS baseline version, to be administered at screening) as well as any new 
instances of suicidality (C -SSRS since last visit version, at other visits as indicated in 
Appendix 1). The C -SSRS incorporates a structured interview to prompt recollection of 
suicidal ideation, including the intensity of the ideation, behavior and attempts with 
actual/potential lethality.
Smartphone Likert Scale A ssessments
Three Likert scales assessing mood, quality of sleep, sub jective well -being and cognitive 
functioning and treatment expectancy will be administered via an android smartphone. 
Patients will be instructed to fill in the Likert scales at defined time points during the trial.
[IP_ADDRESS] Samples for Research Biosample Repositor y (RBR)
Overview  of the RBR
The [COMPANY_002] RBR is a centrally administered group of facilities for the long -term storage of 
human biologic specimens, including body fluids, solid tissues, and derivatives thereof 
(e.g., DNA , RNA, proteins, peptides). The collect ion, storage and analysis of these 
specimens will facilitate the rational design of new pharmaceutical agents and the 
development of diagnostic tests, which may allow for individualized drug therapy for 
patients in the future.
Specimens will be collected f rom patients who give specific consent to participate in this 
optional RBR. Collected specimens will be used to achieve the following objectives:
 To study the association of biomarkers with efficacy, AEs, or disease 
progression.
 To increase knowledge and u nderstanding of disease biology.
 To study drug response, including drug effects and the processes of drug 
absorption and disposition.
 To develop biomarker or diagnostic assays and establish the performance 
characteristics of these assays.
Approval by [CONTACT_375491]'s IRB or Ethics 
Committee (EC) and, if applicable, an a ppropriate regulatory body. If a site has not been 
granted approval for RBR sampling, this section of the protocol will not be applicable at 
that site.

72/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5Sample Collection
One whole blood sample will be collected for RBR long -term storage, which may be 
used e.g., for future genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_445329].
The samples collected for DNA extraction may be used for whole genome sequencing 
(WGS) and other genetic analysis and may be sent to one or more laboratories for 
analysis.
Genomics is increasingly in forming researcher's understanding of disease pathobiology.  
WGS provides a comprehensive characterization of the genome and, along with clinical 
data collected in this study, may increase the opportunity for developi[INVESTIGATOR_76926]. Data wil l be analyzed in the context of this study but will also be explored in 
aggregate with data from other studies. The availability of a larger dataset will assist in 
identification of important pathways, guiding the development of new targeted agents.
For al l samples, dates of consent and specimen collection should be recorded on the 
associated RBR page of the eCRF. For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and 
shipment instructions, see the separate laboratory manual .
RBR specimens will be stored and used until no longer needed or until they are 
exhausted. The RBR storage period will be in accordance with the IRB/EC ‑approved 
Informed Consent Form and applicable laws (e.g., Health Authority requirements).
The repository specimens will be subject to the conf identiality standards (as described 
under Confidentiality in Section 8.4).
Confidentiality
Data generated from RBR specimens must be available for inspection upon request by 
[CONTACT_436288], and [COMPANY_002] Monitors, 
representatives, and collaborators, as appropriate .
Patient medical information associated with RBR specimens is confidential and may only 
be disclosed to third parties as permitted by [CONTACT_25734] (or separate 
authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by [CONTACT_102], 
unless permitted or required by [CONTACT_2371] .
Data derived from RBR specimen analysis on individual patients will generally not be 
provided to study Investigators unless a request for research use is granted. The 
aggregate results of any conducted research will be available in accordance with the 
effective [COMPANY_002] policy on study data publication.
Genetic research data and associated clinical data may be shared with researchers who 
are not participating in the study or submitted to government or other health research 
databases for broad sharing with ot her researchers. Patients will not be identified by

exploratory nature of these analyses, genetic data and analyses will not be shared with 
Investigators or patients unless requ ired by [CONTACT_2371].
Any inventions and resulting patents, improvements, and/or know -how originating from 
the use of the RBR specimen data will become andremain the exclusive and 
unburdened property of [COMPANY_002], except where agreed otherwise.
Consent to Participate in the RBR
The Informed Consent Form will contain a separate section that addresses participation 
in the RBR. The Investigator or authorized designee will explain to each patient the 
objectives, methods, and potential hazards of participation in the RBR. P atients will be 
told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their specimens at any 
time and for any reason during the storage period. A separate, specific signature [CONTACT_20030] a patient’s agreement to provide optiona l RBR specimens. 
Patients who decline to participate will not provide a separate signature.
The Investigator should document whether or not the patient has given consent to 
participate by [CONTACT_375490].
In the event of dea th or loss of competence of a subject who is participating in the 
Research, the participant's specimens and data will continue to be used as part of the 
RBR.
Withdrawal from the RBR
Patients who give consent to provide specimens for the RBR have the right to withdraw 
their specimens at any time for any reason. If a patient wishes to withdraw consent to 
the testing of his or her specimens, the Investigator must inform the Medical Monitor in 
writing of the patient’s wishes using the RBR Withdrawal Form and, i f the trial is ongoing, 
must enter the date of withdrawal on the RBR W ithdrawal of Informed Consent eCRF. 
The patient will be provided with instructions on how to withdraw consent after the trial is 
closed. A patient's withdrawal from Study BP39207 does no t, by [CONTACT_5071], constitute 
withdrawal of specimens from the RBR. Likewise, a patient’s withdrawal from the RBR 
does not constitute withdrawal from Study BP39207. Data already generated before time 
of withdrawal of consent to RBR will still be used.
Monitorin g and Oversight
Specimens collected for the RBR will be tracked in a manner consistent with Good 
Clinical Practice by a quality -controlled, auditable, and appropriately validated laboratory 
information management system, to ensure compliance with data conf identiality as well 
as adherence to authorized use of specimens as specified in this protocol and in the 
Informed Consent Form. [COMPANY_002] monitors and auditors will have direct access to

performing any study ‑specific screening test s or evaluations. Informed Consent Forms 
for enrolled patient sand for patients who are not subsequently enrolled will be 
maintained at the study site.
An Evaluation to Sign Consent (ESC) form will be used to ensure patients' 
understanding of the study. The form consists of [ADDRESS_566550] 10 out of a 
possible 12 in order to participate in the study. It may be necessary to review the 
consent documents with t he patient multiple times and repeat the ESC to ensure this 
degree of comprehension (maximum of 3 times). 
All screening and pre -treatment assessments must be completed and reviewed to 
confirm that patients meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator w ill maintain a screening 
log to record details of all patients screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons
for screening failure.
An Eligibility Screening Form (ESF) documenting the Investigator’s assessment of each 
screened patient with regard t o the protocol’s inclusion and exclusion criteria is to be 
completed by [CONTACT_66343].
Rescreening may be allowed once and only after approval by [CONTACT_445420].

Under no circumstances will patient s who enroll in this study and have completed 
treatment as specified, be permitted to be allocated a new randomization number and 
re-enroll in the study.
All assessments must be performed according to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Appendix 1). Assessments scheduled on the day of study treatment administration 
should be performed prior to administration of study treatment, unless otherwise noted in 
the Schedule of Assessments. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Early  Termination A ssessments
If a patient is discontinued from the study early, or in case of early study or site 
termination decided by [CONTACT_1034], patients will be asked to return to the clinic to 
complete the FU visit 2, as per Appendix 1, [ADDRESS_566551] dose of study drug. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Follow -Up A ssessments
After the study completion/early termination visit, AEs should be followed as outlined in 
Sections 5.4.[ADDRESS_566552] the right to voluntarily 
withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. Reasons for discontinuation of study 
drug or withdrawal from the study may include, but are n ot limited to, the following:
Patient withdrawal of consent at any time.
Any medical condition that the Investigator or Sponsor determines may jeopardize 
the patient’s safety if he or she continues in the study.
Investigator or Sponsor determines it is in the best interest of the patient.
Patient non -compliance.
Patients who fulfill the criteria described in the Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869] (as defined in Section 
3.1.2 ) should be discontinued from the study.
For patients who exhibit a worsening of their underlying medical condition that can be 
managed on an out-patient basis with adjustment of their background medication, the 
decision to continue wit h the study will be made on a case -by-case basis in close 
consultation between the Investigator, the Medical Monitor, and the Sponsor. A 
worsening of symptoms of schizophrenia does not necessarily constitute a reason for 
withdrawal of the subject from the study. Appropriate changes in antipsychotic or other 
pharmacological (i.e., antidepressants) treatment can be instituted if discussed with and 
agreed to by [CONTACT_1689]/Sponsor, and should be recorded in the treatment 
section of the AE eCRF form.

[IP_ADDRESS] Discontinuation from Study  Drug
Patient must discontinue study drug if they experience any of the following:
 Pregnancy.
 Cardiovascular events, suspected seizure activity, liver abnormalities, 
creatinine increases as described in Section 3.1.2 .
 Patient unable to continue to comply with study requirements.
 Unblinding of a patient.
Patients who discontinue study drug prematurely will be asked to return to the clinic for a 
study completion/early termination visit (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). The primary reason for 
premature study drug discontinuation should be documented on the appropriate eCRF. 
Patients who discontinue study drug prematurely will not be replaced.
[IP_ADDRESS] Withdrawal from Study
Every effort should be made to obtain information on patients who withdraw from the 
study. The primary reason for withdrawal from the study should be documented on the 
appropriate eCRF.
Patients will not be followed for any reason after consent has been withdrawn.
4.7.2 Study and Site Discontinuation
The Sponsor has the right to terminate this study at any time. Reasons for terminating 
the study may include, but are not limited to, the following:
 The incidence or severity of AEs in this or other studies indicates a potential 
health hazard to patients.
 Patient enr ollment is unsatisfactory.
 Important new information becomes available that may be relevant to the 
subject’s consent.
The Sponsor will notify the Investigator and Health Authorities if the study is placed on 
hold, or if the Sponsor decides to discontinue the study or development program.

of protocol ‑specified safety laboratory assessments; measurement of protocol -specified 
vital signs, ECGs and laboratory parameters; and other protocol -specified tests 
described in Section 5.1.[ADDRESS_566554], regardless of causal attribution. An AE can therefore be any of the following:
Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated w ith the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition), except as described in 
Secti on [IP_ADDRESS] .
Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline.
Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X ‑ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from study drug.
AEs that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, inclu ding those that occur 
prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive procedures such as 
biopsies).

78/Protocol BP39207 , Version 55.1.2 Serious A dverse Events (Immediately  Reportable to the 
Sponsor)
A SAE is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria:
 Fatal (i.e., the AE actually causes or leads to death).
 Life-threatening (i.e., the AE, in the view of the Investigator, places the patient 
at immediate risk of death). This does not include any AE that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form or was allowed to co ntinue, might have caused death.
 Requires or prolongs in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
 Results in persistent or signif icant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in 
substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions).
 Congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed 
to study drug.
 Significant medical event in the Investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize 
the patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above).
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of 
an AE (rat ed as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to a pre -defined grading criteria; 
see Section 5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such 
as severe headache without any further findings).
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each AE recorded on 
the eCRF.
SAEs are required to be reported by [CONTACT_67852] i mmediately (i.e., no 
more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting 
instructions).
5.1.[ADDRESS_566555] (Immediately  
Reportable to the Sponsor)
 Non-serious AEs of special interest are required to be reported by [CONTACT_66346] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the 
event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). Also see Section 3.1.[ADDRESS_566556] for this study include the following:
Suspected seizure activity
Confirmed QTcF value of CTCAE Grade 2 or 480 -500msec (see Appendix 4)
Confirmed QTcF value exceeding a change from baseline of 60 msec
Cases of an elevated ALT or AST in combination with either an elevated bilirubin or 
clinical jaundice, as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .

79/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5Confirmed increase of serum creatinine exceeding 1.5 ULN.
Worsening of psychosis.
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_5257], as defined below:
Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathog enic, is 
considered an infectious agent. A transmission of an infectious agent may be 
suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an infection in 
a patient exposed to a medicinal product. This term applies only when a 
contaminatio n of the study drug is suspected.
5.1.4 Selected Safety  Assessments 
Additional safety data will be obtained on the following:
 The ECG parameters HR, PQ (PR), QRS, QT, RR and QTcF, along with 
information on T -and U -waves.
 Changes in ECG parameters as compared to baseline ECG.
 Incidence of clinically significant ECG abnormalities. 
 Incidence of laboratory abnormalities, based on hematology, clinical chemistry, 
and urinalysis test results:
oHematology: Hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBCs, platelets, WBCs, differentials ( counts): 
neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils.
oBlood chemistry: AST, ALT, total and conjugated bilirubin, ALP, albumin, creatinine, 
urea, total protein, total cholesterol, LDL and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, sodium, 
chloride, cal cium, phosphate, potassium, glucose (fasting).
oUrinalysis: protein, blood, glucose, leukocytes, nitrites and pH.
 Changes in extrapyramidal symptoms as assessed by [CONTACT_445421] -A scale.
 Changes in the positive symptoms and excitement/hostility as assessed by [CONTACT_445422] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
 Suicidal ity assessed by [CONTACT_163990] (C -SSRS).
 Psychopathological assessment assessed by [CONTACT_445423].

RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
80/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5some of the monitoring measures that will be taken to maximize the participant’s safety 
in this study. 
5.2.1 Management of Specific A dverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS] Changes in Heart Rate and Blood Pressure 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_445361] I studies 
(see Sections and [IP_ADDRESS] ), similar results were not observed in the MAD study in 
Down syndrome subjects (Study BP25543) nor in the safety review of BP27832 
(CLEMATIS). Vital signs and ECG assessment of the heart rate will be performed 
throughout the study. Additional assessments of vital signs might be considered by [CONTACT_3786]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Changes in QTcF Interval
Increased QTcF intervals at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations have been 
observed in the context of the basmisanil DDI study with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 
inhibitor. The average maximum concentration was ~ [ADDRESS_566558] procedures (see Section 3.1.2 ).
[IP_ADDRESS] Increases in Serum Creatinine 
A mild increase in serum creatinine not exceeding the ULN and without concomitant 
changes in BUN and electrolytes, respe ctively, was observed in previous clinical trials in 
healthy volunteers and in people with Down syndrome. Since the increases in serum 
creatinine have not been associated with changes of other GFR markers, it is likely 
related to inhibitory effects of basm isanil on the tubular creatinine transporters as shown 
in vitro .In this study, serum creatinine will be measured at various time -points and an 
increase exceeding 1.5ULN that is confirmed by a repeat testing within three days will 
result in withdrawal. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Suicidality  
Clinical experience does not point to any suicidality liability of basmisanil. However, 
monitoring for suicidality (see C -SSRS in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) is mandatory in clinical trials of 
CNS active molecules and will be implemented as outlined in Appendix 1with the C -
SSRS. The Investigator is asked to assess individually appropriate next steps in case a 
suicidality alert arises. 

RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
81/Protocol BP39207 , Version [IP_ADDRESS] Withdrawal Symptoms 
At the current time, neither non -clinical nor clinical observations point to a liability of 
withdrawal symptoms after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_445362]. Nevertheless, AE monitoring 
(including a phone call by [CONTACT_737] [ADDRESS_566559] dose) is continued for 
about [ADDRESS_566560] dose which is considered appropriate in the context of a 
dominant half -life of less than 12 hours. Should withdrawal symptoms occur, 
symptomatic treatment is recommended. Reintroducing basmisanil is not foreseen.
5.3 METHODS A ND TIMING F OR CA PTURING A ND ASSESSING 
SAFETY PA RAMETERS
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that a ll AEs (see Section 5.1.1 for definition) 
are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in accordance 
with instr uctions provided in this section and in Sections 5.4-5.6. 
For each AE recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the Investigator will make an 
assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.1.2 for seriousness criteria), severity (see 
Section 5.3.3 ), and causality (see Section 5.3.4 ).
5.3.[ADDRESS_566561]. All AEs, whether 
reported by [CONTACT_25743], will be recorded in the patient’s 
medical record. AEs will then be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF as follows:
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study  drug , only 
SAEs caused by a protocol -mandated intervention should be reported (e.g., SAEs 
related to invasive procedures such as biopsies). Any other adverse event should not be 
reported .
After initiation of study drug, all AEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be 
reported until [ADDRESS_566562] dose of study drug.
After this period , Investigators should report any deaths, SAEs, or other AEs of 
concern that are believed to be related to prior treatment with study drug (see Section 
5.6).
5.3.2 Eliciting A dverse Ev ent Information
A consistent methodology of non-directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting AE 
information at all patient evaluation time- points. Examples of non -directive questions 
include the following:
“How have you felt since your last clinic visit?”
“Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?”
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
82/Protocol BP39207 , Version 55.3.[ADDRESS_566563] normal daily activity
Severe Incapacitating with inability to work or to perform normal daily activity
Note: Regardless of severity, some events may also meet seriousness criteria. Refer to 
definition of a serious adverse event (see Section 5.1.2 ).
5.3.4 Assessment of Causality  of Adverse Events
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether or 
not an AE is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes" or "no" 
accordingly. The following guidance should be taken into consideration:
 Temporal relationship of event onset to the initi ation of study drug.
 Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug (where applicable).
 Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments .
 Known association of the event with the disease under study.
 Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known 
to increase the occurrence of the event.
 Presence of non -treatment -related factors that are known to be associate d with 
the occurrence of the event.
For patient receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol -mandated therapy.
5.3.[ADDRESS_566564] medical terminology/concept s when recording AEs on 
the Adverse Event eCRF. Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.
Only one AE term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis versus Signs and Sy mptoms
A diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the A dverse Event eCRF rather than 
individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than 
jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs 
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
83/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized a s a single diagnosis or syndrome 
at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported AEs based on 
signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by [CONTACT_445424], with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first 
symptom of the eventual diagnosis.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Occurring Secondary  to Other Events
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical 
sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252], with the exception of severe or 
serious secondary events. However, medically significant AEs occurring secondary to an 
initiating event that are separated in ti me should be recorded as independent events on 
the Adverse Event eCRF. For example:
If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF.
If vomiting results in severe dehydra tion, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF.
If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.
If dizziness leads to a fall and subsequent fracture, all three events shoul d be 
reported separately on the eCRF.
All AEs should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is unclear as to 
whether the events are associated.
[IP_ADDRESS] Persistent or Recurrent A dverse Events
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient 
evaluation time -points. Such events should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event 
eCRF. The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity should be 
updated to reflect the most extreme severity an y time the event worsens. If the event 
becomes serious, the Adverse Event eCRF should be updated to reflect this.
A recurrent AE is one that resolves between patient evaluation time -points and 
subsequently recurs. Each recurrence of an AE should be recorde d separately on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an AE. A laboratory test result should be 
reported as an AE if it meets any of the following criteria:
 Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659].
 Result s in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation).
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
84/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy.
Clinically significa nt in the Investigator’s judgment.
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings. Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an AE.
If a cl inically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., ALP and bilirubin [ADDRESS_566565] associated with cholecystitis), only the diagnosis 
(i.e., cholecystitis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.
If a clinically s ignificant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a 
descriptor indicating if the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., "elevated 
potassi um", as opposed to "abnormal potassium"). If the laboratory abnormality can be 
characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should 
be recorded as the AE. For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L 
should be recorded as “hyperkalemia”.
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes. The initial severity of the event shoul d be recorded, and the severity or 
seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens.
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Vital Sign Values
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an AE. A vital sign result should be reported 
as an AE if it meets any of the following cr iteria:
Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659].
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation).
Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy.
Clinically significant in the Investigator’s judgment.
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings. Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality 
should be classified as an AE.
If a clin ically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high BP), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
85/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes. The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or 
seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens.
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Liver Func tion Tests
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( 3ULN) in combination with either an elevated 
total bilirubin ( ≥ 2ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other 
causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (see 
Section 3.1.2 ). Therefore, Investigators must report as an AE the occurrence of either of 
the following:
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with total bilirubin
≥ 2ULN.
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in comb ination with clinical jaundice.
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period (see Section 
5.3.1 ), regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2 ).
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event. The event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical 
concept on the Adverse Event eCRF. Generally, only one such event should be reported. 
The term “sudden death” should only be used for the occurrence of an abrupt and 
unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or without 
preexisting he art disease, within one hour of the onset of acute symptoms or, in the case 
of an unwitnessed death, within [ADDRESS_566566] seen alive and stable. 
If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, 
“unexplained death” should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the cause of 
death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), “unexplained death” should be 
replaced by [CONTACT_25749].
[IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Medical Conditions
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study. 
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline 
Conditions eCRF.
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an AE only if the frequency, 
severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study. When recording such 
events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the 
preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., “more 
frequent headaches”).
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
86/Protocol BP39207 , Version [IP_ADDRESS] Worsening of Sy mptoms A ssociated with Schizophrenia
Worsening of symptoms associated with schizophrenia should be recorded as an AE if 
judged by [CONTACT_445425]. When recording an unanticipated 
worsening of symptoms associated with schizophrenia on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is 
important to convey the concept that the condition has changed by [CONTACT_445426] (e.g., exacerbation of psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia 
characterized by “increase of auditory hallucinations”).
A worsening of symptoms of schizophrenia does not necessarily constitute a reason for 
withdrawal of the subject from the study. Appropriate change s in antipsychotic or other 
pharmacological (i.e., antidepressants) treatment can be instituted if discussed with and 
agreed to by [CONTACT_1689]/Sponsor, and should be recorded in the treatment 
section of the AE eCRF form.
[IP_ADDRESS] New occurrence or worsening of Extrapy ramidal Sy mptoms 
(EPS) 
Worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms associated with antipsychotic treatment and/or 
wash -out of prohibited medication should be recorded as an AE if judged by [CONTACT_445427]. 
New occurrence or worsening of EPS does not necessarily constitute a reason for 
withdrawal of the subje ct from the study. Appropriate decrease in antipsychotic 
medication dosage or other pharmacological (i.e., propanolol) treatment can be instituted 
if discussed with and agreed to by [CONTACT_1689]/Sponsor, and should be recorded 
in the treatment secti on of  the AE eCRF form.

Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria 
are met:
oThe patient has not suffered an AE.

A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_445358] a reason for withdrawal of 
the patient from the study (for instance, a short hospi[INVESTIGATOR_445368]). Each case should be discussed with the Medical Monitor/Sponsor. It should be determined if the patient can continue the study medication while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. In case study medication cannot be continued while the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], it should be determined whether the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_445360] a continuation in the study after discharge can be justified. The decision should be recorded in the eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Overdoses 
Study drug overdose is the accidental or intentional use of the drug in an amount higher than the dose being studied. An overdose or incorrect administration of study drug is not an AE unless it results in untoward medical effects.  
Any study drug overdose or incorrect admin istration of study drug should be noted on 
the Additional Observations eCRF. 
All AEs associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the associated AE fulfills serious criteria, the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2). 
Appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the individual's clinical signs and symptoms and in accordance with best medical practices. In vitro  studies have 
shown that benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_445369]

New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis.
Significant new diagnostic test results.
Change in causality based on new information.
Change in the event’s outcome, including recovery.
Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event.
Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting SAEs to the local 
Health Authority and IRB/EC.
5.4.[ADDRESS_566569] details are listed in the 
“Protocol Administrative and Contact [CONTACT_7171] & List of Investigators”.  
5.4.[ADDRESS_566570] (see Sections 5.1.2 and 
5.1.3 ), Investigators should record all case details that can be gathered on the Serious 
Adverse Event Reporting Form and forward this form to the SAE Responsible within 24 
hours.
5.4.3 Reporting Requirements for Pregnancies 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancies in Female Participants 
Female participants of childbearing potential will be instructed to immediately inform the 
Investigator if they become pregnant during the study or within [ADDRESS_566571] 
dose of study drug. A Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form should be comple ted by 
[CONTACT_66350] 24 hours after learning of the 
pregnancy. Pregnancy should not be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. The 
Investigator should discontinue study drug and counsel the participant/caregiver, 
discussi ng the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. Monitoring of 
the participant should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancies in Female Partners of Male Study Subjects
Male patients will be instructed through the ICF to immediately inform the Investigator if 
their partner becomes pregnant during the study or within [ADDRESS_566572] dose of 
study drug. A Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form should be completed by [CONTACT_445428]5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
89/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5Investigator and submitted to the Sponsor with in [ADDRESS_566573] or his pregnant partner may 
provide information on the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus, 
to support an informed decision in cooperation with t he treating physician and/or 
obstetrician.
[IP_ADDRESS] Abortions 
Any spontaneous abortion should be classified as a SAE (as the Sponsor considers 
spontaneous abortions to be medically significant events), recorded on the Adverse 
Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after 
learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Congenital A nomalies/Birth defects 
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient should be 
classified as a SAE, recorded on the AE eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately 
(i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ). 
5.[ADDRESS_566574] to follow -up, 
or the patient withdraws consent. Every effort should be made to follow all serious AEs 
considered to be related to study drug or trial -related procedur es until a final outcome 
can be reported.
During the study period, resolution of AEs (with dates) should be documented on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilitate source data 
verification. If, after follow -up, return to baseline status or stabilization cannot be 
established, an explanation should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.
All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome 
and reported according to the instructions provided in Section 5.4.[ADDRESS_566575], and pregnancies, the Sponsor or a 
designee may follow up by [CONTACT_756], fax, electronic mail, and/or a monitoring visit to 
obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g., from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_445371]5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
90/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5summaries, consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent 
medical assessment of the reported case.
5.[ADDRESS_566576] -STUDY ADVERSE E VENTS
The Investigator is not required to actively monitor patients for AEs after the end of the 
AE reporting period (defined as [ADDRESS_566577] dose of study drug). 
If the Investigator becomes aware of any ot her SAE occurring after the end of the AE 
reporting period, if the event is believed to be related to prior study drug treatment the 
event should be reported directly to the Sponsor or its designee, either by [CONTACT_445429]. 
5.[ADDRESS_566578] experience to identify and expeditiously communicate 
possible new safety findings to Investigators, IRBs, ECs, and applicable Health 
Authorities based on applicable legislation.
To determine report ing requirements for single AE cases, the Sponsor will assess the 
expectedness of these events using the Basmisanil Investigator’s Brochure.
The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event 
frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the 
applicable reference document.
Reporting requirements will also be based on the Investigator's assessment of causality 
and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by [CONTACT_25753].
6. STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS AND ANAL YSIS PLAN
6.1 DETERMINA TION OF SA MPLE SIZE
Based on current withdra wal rates, approximately 231 patients will be enrolled in the 
study, to ensure that a minimum of 150 patients (50 patients per treatment arm) will have 
evaluable data at 24 weeks . They will be randomized 1:1:1 to the three study arms.
A sample size of 50 p atients per arm provides 80% power to detect a treatment effect 
size of 0.5, at a 2 -sided -level of 0.1, for the pairwise comparison of each active dose 
arm to placebo. No adjustments for multiple comparisons will be incorporated into the 
analysis. Incorp orating an assumed withdrawal rate of 35%, a study sample size of 231 
(77patients per arm) will be used. T he sample size may be increased if the actual 
withdrawal rate is higher than expected.
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
91/Protocol BP39207 , Version 56.[ADDRESS_566579] OF STUDY
To determine whether the integri ty of the study was maintained, listing/summary of data 
referring to the general conduct of the study (such as enrollment, protocol violations, use 
of prohibited co -medication, blinding details) will be generated.
6.[ADDRESS_566580] one administration of the study treatment, 
whether prematurely withdrawn from the study or not, will be included in the safety 
analysis. For the safety analysis population, data will be analyzed according to the 
treatment actually taken.
6.3.2 Efficacy  Analysis Population
The following analysis populations will be defined: intent -to-treat (ITT) and per -protocol 
(PP). For both populations , patients will be grouped according to the treatment actually 
taken.
Intent -to-treat Population
The ITT population is defined as consisting of all patients randomized, who received at 
least one administration of the study treatment and had a baseline and at least one 
post-dose assessment. 
Per-Protocol Population
The PP population will be precisely defined in a separate document , before database 
closure, as the subset of the ITT population without major protocol deviations.
6.4 SUMMA RIES OF TREA TME NT GROUP COMPA RABILITY
Demographics, baseline characteristics and all baseline laborator y values will be 
summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_445430].
6.5 SAFETY ANAL YSES
All safety analysis will be based on the safety analysis population .
As appropriate, listings, summary tables and graphs will be provided for safety and 
tolerability assessments, including:
Incidence of AEs (overall, by [CONTACT_445398]).
Incidence of SAEs.
Incidence of laboratory abnormalities (including hematology, clinical chemistry, and 
urinalysis parameters).
Incidence of BP abnormalities.
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
92/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5Incidence of ECG abnormalities as well ECG changes as compared to baseline 
measurements.
Changes in the PANSS as compared to baseline.
NOSIE -30 as compared to baseline.
Changes in C -SSRS as compared to baseline.
Further details on the safety parameters are given in Section 5.1. Safety data will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics using the safety analysis population, which will 
include all patients treated.
6.5.[ADDRESS_566581] Results
All clinical laboratory data will be stored on the database in the units in which t hey were 
reported. Patient listings and summary statistics at each assessment time will be 
presented using the International System of Units (SI units; Système International 
d’Unités). Laboratory data not reported in SI units will be converted to SI units before 
processing.
Laboratory test values will be presented by [CONTACT_66353].
[IP_ADDRESS] Standard Reference Ranges and Transformation of Data
[COMPANY_002] standard reference ranges, rather than the reference ranges of the Investigator, 
will be used for all parameters. For most parameters, the measured laboratory test result 
will be assessed directly using the [COMPANY_002] standard reference range. Certain laboratory 
parameters will be transformed to [COMPANY_002]’s standard reference ranges.
A transformation will be performed on certain laboratory tests that lack sufficiently 
common procedures and have a wide range of Investigator ranges, e.g., enzyme tests 
that include AST, ALT, and ALP and total bilirubin. Since the standard referenc e ranges 
for these parameters have a lower limit of zero, only the upper limits of the ranges will be 
used in transforming the data.
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of Laboratory  Abnormalities
For all laboratory parameters included, there exists a [COMPANY_002] pre-defined standard 
reference range. Laboratory values falling outside this standard reference range will be 
labeled “H” for high or “L” for low in patient listings of laboratory data.
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
93/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5In addition to the standard reference range, a marked reference range has been 
pre-defined by[CONTACT_66354]. The marked reference range is 
broader than the standard reference range. Values falling outside the marked reference 
range that also represent a defined change from baseline will be considered marked 
laboratory abnormalities (i.e., potentially clinically relevant). If a baseline value is not 
available for a patient , the midpoint of the standard reference range will be used as the 
patient ’s baseline value for the purposes of determining marked laboratory 
abnormalities. M arked laboratory abnormalities will be labeled in the patient listings as 
“HH” for very high or “LL” for very low.
6.5.3 Vital Signs
Vital signs data will be presented by [CONTACT_445431]. In addition, tabular summaries will 
be used, as appropriate.
6.5.4 ECG Data A nalysis
ECG data will be presented by [CONTACT_445431]. In addition, tabu lar summaries will 
be used, as appropriate.
6.5.5 Concomitant Medications
The original terms recorded on the patient s’ eCRF by [CONTACT_445432].
Concomitant medications will be presented in summary tables and listings.
6.6 EFFICA CY ANAL YSES
The primary analysis population for all efficacy analyses will be based on the ITT 
population, which will include all randomized patients treated with study medication. 
6.6.1 Primary  Efficacy  Endpoint
The primary efficacy endpoint is:
Cognition assessed by [CONTACT_445433] (change from baseline to Week 24 in MCCB 
neurocognitive composite score) will be analyzed using a mixed effect model for 
repeated measures (MMRM) with treatment, region, age group, sex, schizophrenia 
cognitive subtype, and visit as fixed effects, treatment -by-visit interaction term, and 
baseline value as the covariate. The model will include subject as a random effect, and 
incorporate an unstructured variance -covariance matrix. For each active dose arm 
tested at the final analysis, this model will be used to test the null hypothesis of no 
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
94/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5treatment difference between the placebo arm and the ac tive arm at a 2- sided -level of 
0.1.
6.6.2 Secondary  Efficacy Endpoints
The secondary efficacy endpoints are:
Mean change from baseline in MCCB cognitive domain scores (attention, speed of 
processing, reasoning, working memory, visual learning, verbal learning and social 
cognition).
Mean change from baseline in the WMS IV-PAL score.
Mean change from baseline in the WMS IV-LM score.
Mean change from baseline in the ratio between TMT -B and TMT -A scores.
Mean change from baseline in the SCoRS score.
Mean change fro m baseline in the CGI -S rating.
Mean change from baseline in the CGI-I rating.
Mean change from baseline in the PSP total score.
Continuous secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using an MMRM model 
similar to that described for the primary endpoint, and summarized using descriptive 
statistics.
6.[ADDRESS_566582] deviations, and coefficients of variation. Individual 
and mean plasma concentration versus time data will be plotted on semi -logarithmic 
scales.
Graphical exploration of the relationship between basmisanil (and M1 an d other 
metabolites, if relevant) exposure and outcome measures as well as safety parameters 
will be performed. If indicated by [CONTACT_445400], more formal analyses of PK to PD 
parameters of interest may be undertaken.
6.8 PATIENT -REPORTED OUT COME A NALYSES
The patient -reported outcomes are:
Change from baseline on the patient -reported health -related quality of life scale 
(SQLS).
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
95/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5Change in subjective mood, sleep and subjective well -being and cognitive 
functioning ratings.
These endpoints will be analyzed using an MMRM model similar to that described for the 
primary endpoint, and summarized using descriptive statistics.
6.9 EXPLORA TORY ANALYSES
The exploratory analyses will include:
Mean change from baseline in the PANSS factor and total scores.
Mean change from bas eline in the BNSS subscales and total scores.
Mean change from baseline in % of patients rated as “ready to work” on the W oRQ.
Mean change from baseline in the VRFCAT score.
Mean change from baseline in the CFAS score.
Semantic priming analysis of verbal f luency, as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
Primacy region analysis of epi[INVESTIGATOR_445331] . Percentage recall 
from the primacy relative to the recency region will be calculated for each learning 
trial and for long -delay free recall. 
Analysis of genetic PRS and complement C4 CNV as described in Section 3.2.[ADDRESS_566583] 12 weeks of treatment. The analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_445389] [IP_ADDRESS] .
This analysis will focus on the change from baseline to W eek 12 in MCCB 
neurocognitive composite score, which will be analyzed using an MMRM model which 
will be similar to that described for the primary analysis (including all stratification factors 
although this may not be possible depending on the actual cell size). The pairwise 
comparison of each active dose to placebo will be evaluated using the es timated effect 
size based on the least -squares mean (LSM) estimates from the MMRM models. For 
each dose arm, the decision whether to continue or drop the arm for the remainder of 
the study will be based on the conditional probability that the true treatment effect size 
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
96/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5for that arm is0.35. If the calculated conditional probability is less than 20% that the 
true treatment effect size can reach this threshold for one of the two doses, then that 
dose arm may be discontinued. I f this conditional probability is less than 20% for both 
dose arms, then the study may be discontinued for futility. 
In case the calculated conditional probability that the true treatment effect size can 
reach the threshold of effect size > 0.35 is more than 20% for both treatment arms, one 
treatment arm may still be discontinued. 
Further analysis details on the interim analysis will be documented in a separate 
Efficacy IMC Agreement Document prior to the conduct of the interim analysis.
7. DATA COLLECTION A ND MANAGEMENT
7.1 DATA QUA LITY ASSURA NCE
The Sponsor will be responsible for data management of this study, including quality 
checking of the data. Sit es will be responsible for data entry into the Electronic Data 
Capture (EDC) system.
A comprehensive validation check program will verify the data. Discrepancies will be 
generated automatically in the system at the point of entry or added manually for 
resolution by [CONTACT_737].
The Sponsor will produce a Data Handling Manual and a Data Management Plan that 
describes the quality checking to be performed on the data. Data collected electronically 
will be sent directly to the Sponsor, using the Sponsor’s standard procedures to handle 
and process the electronic transfer of these data.
System backups for data stored by [CONTACT_40892]’s standard procedures.
Contract research organizatio ns (CROs) may also be responsible for quality checking of 
the data or parts of the data. In this case and in the event of discrepant data, the CRO 
will request data clarification from the sites, which the sites will resolve electronically in 
the EDC system as appropriate.
If responsible for quality checking of data, the CRO will produce a Data Management 
Plan or equivalent document that describes the quality checking to be performed on the 
data. System backups for data stored at the CRO and records retentio n for the study 
data will be consistent with the CRO’s standard procedures.

97/Protocol BP39207 , Version 5name [CONTACT_66374]. For each patient enrolled, an eCRF must 
be completed and electronically signed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_445372]. If a patient withdraws from the study, the reason must be noted on the eCRF. If a 
patient is withdrawn from the study because of a treatment ‑limiting AE, thorough efforts 
should be made to clearly document the outcome.
The Investigator should ensure the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the data 
reported to the Sponsor/CRO in the eCRFs and in all required reports.
eCRFs will be submitted electronically to the Sponsor/CRO and should be handled in 
accordanc e with instructions from the Sponsor/CRO.
At the end of the study, the Investigator will receive patient data for his or her site in a 
readable format on a compact disc that must be kept with the study records. 
Acknowledgement of receipt of the compact dis c is required.
7.3 SOURCE DA TA DOCUMENT ATION
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that critical 
protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by [CONTACT_26831], complete, and verifiable from source documents.
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded 
and documented for the first time. They include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], 
clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patie nt-reported outcomes, 
evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated 
instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_26671], microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X ‑rays, 
patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico‑technical 
departments involved in a clinical trial.
Before study initiation, data to be entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or 
electroni c record of the data) and considered source data must be defined in the Trial 
Monitoring Plan.
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retain ed per 
the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.5.
To facilitate source data verification, the Investigators and in stitutions must provide the 
Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial ‑related 
monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review. The investigational site must also allow 
inspection by [CONTACT_436295].
RO5186582 (Basmisanil) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
98/Protocol BP39207 , Version 57.4 USE OF COMPU TERIZED SYSTEMS
When clinical observations are entered directly into an investigational site’s 
computerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the 
electronic record can serve as the source document if the system has been va lidated in 
accordance with Health Authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used 
in clinical research. An acceptable computerized data collection system allows 
preservation of the original entry of data. If original data are modified, the s ystem should 
maintain a viewable audit trail that shows the original data as well as the reason for the 
change, name [CONTACT_25773], and date of the change.
7.[ADDRESS_566585] of this study and the distribution of 
IMP, including eCRFs, ePRO data (if applicable), Informed Consent Forms, laboratory 
test results, and medication inventory records, must be retained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_25653] 
15years after completion or discontinuation of the study, or for the length of time 
required by [CONTACT_445434], whichever is longer. After that 
period of time, the documents may be destroyed, subject to local regulations. No records 
may be disposed of without the written approval of the Sponsor. W ritten notification 
should be provided to the Sponsor prior to transferring any records to another party or 
moving them to another location.

The tables below show the approximate marketed equivalent doses of antipsychotics to 
up to a maximum of 6 mg risperidone or600 mg chlorpromazine , respectively . The 
following principles for the derivation of antipsychotics equivalent doses were applie d:
1.The equivalent doses of commonly used antipsychotics follow guidance from
relevant clinical literature and the expert consensus guideline for optimizing 
pharmacologic treatment of psychotic disorders .
2.The table only shows approximate equivalent doses formarket eddose strengths 
and dose ranges in accordance with the label information available (may vary 
from country to country ). In practice, doses of antipsychotics should be within
dose ranges approved by [CONTACT_148702].
3.Inpractice, if a dose of a given antipsychotic falls in between two doses in the 
table, the higher dose should be used .
4.Forantipsychotics that are not listed in the table, the Investigator should contact

STUDY SYNOPSIS 
 
Sponsor:  General Electric Company, acting through its GE Healthcare Business  
Research Type:  This is a clinical , open label , non -randomized , prospective , single -site, non -blinded  
research study, that will enroll from the accessible women (ag ed >18 years) in the 
2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. The study w ill be conducted in two parts, 
including an initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_471467]  (Part 1)  and continued 
testing (Part 2).  
Regulatory Status:  This is a pre-market  research study of the following products:  
Pre-market :  Vscan Access R2 Ultrasound System   
Post -market :  GE Corometrics* 170 Series Fetal Monitor  
Background and  
Rationale:  Fetal heart rate (FHR)  estimation is an important tool for assessment of fetal well -
being and development during pregnancy that is traditionally measured using M-
mode or Doppler methods on ultrasound systems.  The Vscan Access Ultrasound 
system is a diagnostic ultrasound imaging system manufactured by [CONTACT_12925], 
GE Healthcare (GEHC) and equipped with Assisted FHR , a novel investigational 
feature that enables visualization and measurement of fetal heart rate. This feature 
visually maps obs tetrical and abdominal anatomical structures and fluid and is intended 
to be used by [CONTACT_471484], including midwives, other paraprofessionals and general physicians.  The built -in preset 
workflows and protocols, particularly enable novice users to scan efficiently and conduct basic screening exams.   This  technology provides  an innovative way of 
assessing FHR  that is semi -automated and does not involve any manual 
measurements once the fetal heart is sc anned.  This study is being conducted to 
validate  procedural accuracy of the Vscan Access R2 Ultrasound Syst em with 
Assisted FHR  Measurement  in users of all experience levels.

Procedures/  
Methods:  Subjects in the initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_49149] (Part 1) and validation  testing (Part 2) will 
undergo up to [ADDRESS_604362] scans on 
the Vscan Access R2 Ultrasound Syste m with Assisted FHR (research device) and a 
conventional commercially available ultrasound device . Subjects will also undergo 
routine commercially available noninvasive FHR  monitoring as a reference.  All 
procedures will be conducted at a Sponsor, GE Healthcare (GEHC), facility. All 
members of the study staff will be qualified based on experience and trained prior to participation.  
 
The study population will consist of asymptomatic women ages 18 or older in the 
second (2
nd) and third (3rd) trimesters of pregnancy. Users will be instructed to use 
the VScan Access R2 device to take a [ADDRESS_604363] session  (Part 1)  will be a run -in session, in which the parameters and 
procedures will be a replica of the study but these results will not count towards 
the documented results. There  will be four (4) sessions following this run -in session  
(Part 2). Each of these session s will be approximately 3 -4 hours in length over a 
period of 1 -2 weeks.  
In each session, there will be 1- 2 users and 3 volunteers. The users will be 
instructed to take as many measurements as possible during the allotted time.  
Finalization  of the procedure to calculate accuracy is to be determined based on 
the run -in procedures executed in Part 1. The specific  proce dures for the 
measurement of accuracy which will be used for validation will be performed by [CONTACT_471485] 1 of the study.   
Objectives : Data from Part [ADDRESS_604364] safety information, including type and number of 
AEs, SAEs, and other device issues.     
 
Endpoints : The primary endpoint   is FHR data from the investigational and 
comparator devices on a per -sample basis in bpm (beats per minute).  
The exploratory endpoint  is the number of subject cases containing  scan  
parameters  will be reported and descriptively summarized as necessary to  assist in 
evaluation of usability  of the Vscan Access R2 Ultrasound System . 
The safety endpoint  is the type  and number of AEs, SAEs, and device issues.

Training clinicians  to perform accurate FHR  measurement s can be challenging  due to various discrepancies  in 
both practice and the acceptable standards for routine FHR  measurement.  
FHR  measurement  is important to clinical practice and widely considered safe and effective . A study by [CONTACT_471486]. 2 found that appropriate maternal -fetal care , including FHR  determination via obstetric ultrasound improves 
the outcomes of mothers and their infants , in part due to improved accuracy using advanced ultrasound 
techniques . This has been demonstrated in large clinical trials, including the Eurofetus study which examined 
second trimester ultrasounds prospectively .3 American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) recommends 
medically necessary fetal ultrasound in the 2nd and 3rd trimester, which are widely considered to be safe for 
mother and fetus . 4, [ADDRESS_604370] scanning session. In order for this cycle to function both efficiently and 
economically, it is critical that the human scanning occur in the same location as the Research and Development teams (i.e., onsite at Research Park facility).  
The expertise for the product development of the Ultrasound Devices in use under this Study resides at the GEHC Research Park, Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, [LOCATION_003] site. In particular, not only the personn el expertise, but 
certain specialized testing hardware and software to enable development of these Ultrasound Devices, components and accessories are located at the Research Park site.  
Facility expertise for product development includes:  
• Feasibility; new f eature pairings need to be evaluated.  
• Verification and Validation; necessary components of the design control cycle.  
• Image Quality; the primary determinant of the commercial success of an Ultrasound Device; and determined by a complex matrix of inputs.  
• Com plaint Resolution; replication of Device complaints in a laboratory controlled setting is an essential 
part of post- market surveillance.  
• Usability testing; to fulfill the requirement for products to have usability testing prior to completion of design outp ut requirements.

• System performance with new hardware and software features.  
• Ergonomics and Human Factors; essential part of safe, efficient, and successful product design.  
In summary, this study needs to be performed at the Research Park development site  because the location 
contains:

2. Clinical domain expertise;  
3. User preferences (image quality, presets, knobology) expertise;  
4. Competitive benchmarks; and  
5. Clinical marketing teams.  
 Recommendations for Use of Ultrasound in Research

non- invasive clinical ultrasound exams. Duration and exposure in this study do not exceed those typi[INVESTIGATOR_471468].  
Participating in  this study does not directly benefit subjects, but will provide images and case data that may 
benefit others in the future by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_471469].  
 Established Safety Measures  
In order to minimize the risk of potentia l adverse biological events, known or unknown, as a result of exposure 
to ultrasound, the FDA has issued guidelines that require manufacturers of diagnostic Ultrasound devices for 510(k) to limit the acoustic output (energy) of the transducer, the Guidance  for Industry and FDA Staff - 
Information for Manufacturers Seeking Marketing Clearance of Diagnostic Ultrasound Systems and Transducers 
(2008). These limits, which are displayed on the instrument in the form of a thermal index (TI), both thermal 
index bon e (TIB) and thermal index soft tissue (TIS) and mechanical index (MI), in combination with guidance to 
the sonographer to limit the scan duration according to the ALARA principle (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) minimizes the risk of a significant adverse  biological events.  
With these safety measures in place, extensive use of ultrasound in the past 30 years has been shown to be 
well tolerated in humans.

including the dwell time (i.e. the length of time that the Ultrasound beam is fixed on a specific tissue target), and 
the acoustic output (TIB,  TIC, MI) will be carefully monitored and will be kept within the FDA cleared/approved/ 
recommended levels.  All devices used in this study adhere to the limits for thermal index (TI), mechanical index 
(MI), and other factors set forth by [CONTACT_120898] (FDA) Guidance for Industry and FDA 
Staff - Information for Manufacturers Seeking Marketing Clearance of Diagnostic Ultrasound Systems and 
Transducers (2008), which references the “Standard for real -time display of thermal and mechanical acoustic 
output indices on diagnostic ultrasound equipment Revision 1,” AIUM/NEMA Standards Publication 
(AIUM/NEMA 2004a) and IEC [ZIP_CODE]-2- 37 “Medical electrical equipment - Part 2 -37: Particular requirements for 
the safety of ultrasonic medical diagnostic and monitoring equipment” (IEC 2007). Biological effects of 
ultrasound are rare within these limits, and ultrasound scanning in this study is thus considered to pose minimal risk of adverse effects in research subjects.  
Concern over the bio effects of the acoustic output in vulnerable tissues, such as those of a developi[INVESTIGATOR_471470]; have been investigated since the 1970s.
 6, 10, 11, 12, 13 To date, obstetric scanning poses minimal risk to 
mother and fetus if the sonographer abides by [CONTACT_471487]- medical Use of Ultrasound (2013). 14

 Issuance  
Device will be provided by [CONTACT_471490]. There is no additional calibration or maintenance of study devices 
planned. The Sponsor may provide maintenance and monitoring of devices as necessary to maintain the integrity of study data.  
 Disposition  
The device(s) will be dispositioned after the study by [CONTACT_471491], in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Identifiable health information will be removed prior to the device disposition.  
 Anticipated Risks and Benefits  
The device  under study has undergone risk assessm ent, in accordance with International Standards 
Organization ( ISO) [ZIP_CODE], and risks have been mitigated to levels as low as reasonably possible (ALARP).  
The risks of study participation are  not expected to be greater than those of similar procedures routin ely 
conducted in clinical practice.  Post- trial care  or follow -up is not required by [CONTACT_15365].  FHR  measurement  has 
been performed for over [ADDRESS_604372] maternal growth or fetal development.  
It is also noteworthy that continuous electronic FHR monitorin g has been linked to increases in cesarean 
sections and instrumental births, and therefore costs, without an associated improvement in perinatal outcomes.
 15, 16, 17 
There are no expected risks to subjects, operators, or others in this study beyond those of routine devices in clinical care.  Stresses induced on the fetus are minimal and are widely accepted to be well below harmful levels 
in clinical practice.
  18 
There are no expected risks to subjects,  operators,  or others in this study beyond those of similar de vices  
already used in clinical care .

4. STUDY  DESIGN  
 Study Population  
Adult women (aged >18 years) in  their 2nd or 3rd trimesters of pregnancy based on self -report, will be enrolled. A 
normal  FHR  usually ranges from 120 to 160 beats per minute (bpm). FHR rises through early pregnancy, peaking 
at 170 bpm (10 weeks), and then, decreases through the 2nd trim ester (~140 bpm by 20 weeks), until the end of 
the 3rd trimester (130 bpm at term).  [ADDRESS_604375] selected are feasible for the collection of 
representative FHR ultrasound scans, within a range suitable for validating  the feasibility and accuracy of the

8. SAFETY  
The description, severity, and study device relatedness of any AE or SAE during the study will be recorded. 
Subjects will, if necessary, be provided with emergency care. In the event of any study device issues, the issues will be recorded. Safety reporting will be conducted as described in this protocol.  
 Anticipated Adverse Events   
FHR  determination with ultrasound is widely considered safe for 2nd and 3rd trimester pregnancies without 
significant comorbidities. 15, 16, 17 Because no  subjects will be enrolled that are in active labor or exhibit significant 
medical conditions that could pose risk of harm to mother or developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103] , the risks of this study are 
expected to be the same as for conventional commercially available ultrasound devices for prenatal scanning.  
Diagnostic u ltrasound exams involve minimal risk because they use acoustic energy rather than X -rays or other 
types of ionizing radiation. Ultrasound is commonly used in p opulations  of pregnant women  and is not expected 
to pose additional risks to subjects. 20, 21 This study enrolls from a population of pregnant w omen that may 
foreseeably experience adverse events not related to the study device during the course of this study. In the even that the study staff observed any medical issues that could pose additional risk to the mother or 
Study Title:  Evaluation of Feasibility and Accuracy of Assisted Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) feature of the

  Ver: 1.0; 26/Jul/[ADDRESS_604385]  will be immediately withdrawn and referred for appropriate medical care outside 
of the study.  
Even though manifestation of risks during cardiac, pulmonary, and/or abdominal ultrasound exams is rare, 
ultrasound can produce effects on the body. Having an ul trasound exam involves some foreseeable risks that 
are not different from those routinely encountered in routine clinical ultrasound exams, which include:  
• Tissue warming  
• Discomfort 
• Skin irritation  
• Bruising  
• Abrasions or tears in the skin  
• In rare cases, formation of small pockets of gas in body fluids or tissues (cavitation) can occur. The long -
term effects of tissue heating and cavitation caused by [CONTACT_471498].   
As part of this study, subjects will have an ultrasound exam as part of this study that is not required for clinical 
care. All study scans are completed using non -invasive methods on a commercially available ultrasound device. 
All exams are performed in a similar manner as routine clinical exams. Thus, study participat ion is not expected 
to pose additional risks to subjects beyond those of routine ultrasound scanning.  
There is always a chance of unexpected risks. Throughout the study, the Sponsor will evaluate and update safety information in study documents.  
 Adverse E vent Definitions  
Adverse Event (AE) : any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs 
(including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other persons, whether or not related to the investigational medic al device [ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011 3.2 ]. This includes events related to the investigational device or 
the comparator and to the procedures involved. For users or other persons , this is restricted to events related 
to the investigational medical device.  
Serious Adv erse Event (SAE) : an adverse event that led to death; led to a serious deterioration in the health 
of the subject, that either resulted in a life -threatening illness or injury, a permanent impairment of a body 
structure or a body function,  or in -patient or  prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent life -threatening illness or injury or permanent impairment to body structure or a body function; or led to 
fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect. P lanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -existing 
condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_73701], is not considered a SAE [ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011 3.37].  
Adverse Device Effect (ADE) : an adverse event related to the use of an investigational medical device [ISO 
[ZIP_CODE]:2011 3.1]. This includes any adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, deployment, implantation, installation, or operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical device . 
This includes any event that is a result of a user error or intentional misuse of the investigational device [ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011 3.43].

  Data Management  
Data management processes for handling study data will be maintained  by [CONTACT_1034].  
 Completion of Case Report Forms (CRFs)  
The data reported on the CRFs shall be derived from source documents and be consistent with these source 
documents. Paper CRFs will be used to collect data . The Sponsor will provide CRFs and train stu dy staff on 
completion of CRFs using Good Documentation Practices (GDP). CRF Completion Guidelines (CCG) may be provided by [CONTACT_73710].  
CRFs are to be completed as information becomes available at the site. CRFs should be signe d by [CONTACT_246348], in indicated area(s), to certify the contents of the form. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_471479].  
If discrepancies are discovered on paper CRFs during monitoring, the Sponsor’s represen tative will ensure that 
the study staff makes necessary corrections directly to the CRF(s) prior to collection.  
Following CRF collection, the Sponsor will review the data. A Data Clarification Form (DCF) may be provided to the site to correct or clarify d iscrepancies.  
If a site discovers discrepancies after CRF collection, the site may notify the Sponsor and request data modification.  
 Data Handling and Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_73682] a manner that assures control and traceability.  
 Source Data and Documents  
Source data includes information in original records, certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_34504], observations, or other activities for the study. Source documents for each subject must be retained  throughout 
the investigation, including printed or electronic documents containing source data.  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_471480], audits, EC review, and regulatory authority inspections.  
 Archiving  
All study data must be archived for a minimum of 3 years after study termination (or as required by [CONTACT_1769]) or premature termination of the clinical trial. No source documents or study records will be destroyed without 
Sponsor notification and approval.  
 
12.    MONITORING PLAN   
In collaboration with the site, the Sponsor will ensure proper monitoring of the study to confirm that all the research  requirements are met. Monitoring visits will oversee the pr ogress of a clinical investigation and ensure 
that it is conducted, recorded, and reported in accordance with the protocol, written procedures, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011, and the applicable regulatory requirements.

 PRÉCIS  
 
Background:  
• Indenoisoquinolines are non-camptothecin inhibitors of topoisomerase 1 (top1) with improved characteristics over their predecessors.  Indenoisoquinolines have better chemical stability, producing stable DNA- top1 cleavage complexes, and exhibit a preference for 
unique DNA cleavage sites, compared with their camptothecin counterparts.  
• They have demonstrated activity against camptothecin -resistant cell lines and produce DNA-
protein crosslinks, which are resistant to reversal.  They also show less or no resistance to cells overexpressing the ATP -binding cassette (ABC) transporters, ABCG2, and multidrug 
resistance (MDR -1).  
Primary Objectives:  
• To establish the safety, tolerability and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of LMP744 (NSC  706744) administered intravenously (IV) daily for 5 days (QD x 5) schedule in patients 
with refractory solid tumors and lymphomas. 
Secondary Objectives:  
• Characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of LMP744. 
Exploratory Objectives: 
• Evaluate the effect of LMP744 on markers of DNA damage (γH2AX, pNbs1, pATR , 
ERCC1, RAD51 , Topo1cc, Top1, SLFN11) and epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] -mesenchymal transition (EMT)  in 
circulating tumor cells (CTCs)  and pre- and post- treatment tumor biopsies in patients at the 
expansion cohort. 
• Assess preliminary antitumor activity of LMP744. 
• Examine genomic alterations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) that may be associated 
with response or resistance to treatment.  
Eligibility:  
• Adult patients must have histologically docum ented , relapsed solid tumor s which have 
progressed after one line of therapy, or lymphoma which has progressed after initial therapy and without potentially curative options, or patient refuses potentially curative therapy. 
Study Design:  
• Cycle 1 and subsequent cycles: Patients will receive LMP 744 administered IV QD over 1 
hour on days 1–5 followed by 23 days without drug (28- day cycle).   
• PK and PD samples will be collected.  Tumor biopsies will be mandatory during the expansion phase.

 SCHEMA  
 
 
 
 
LMP744 will be administer ed IV over 1 hour on days 1- 5 of each  28-day cycle  
 
Blood samples for PK analyses will be collected at the following timepoints in cycle 1 only:  
• Day 1, prior to drug administration, 2 minutes (+/- 2 minutes) before end of infusion, and at appropriate time points post infusion ([ADDRESS_870025] infusion) 
• Day 2, [ADDRESS_870026] day 1 start of infusion (prior to day 2 infusion), and 2 min utes (+/- 2 
minutes) before  the end of infusion 
• Day 3, [ADDRESS_870027] day 2 start of infusion (prior to day 3 infusion), and 2 minutes (+/ - 2 
minutes) before end of infusion 
• Day 4, [ADDRESS_870028] day 3 start of infusion (prior to day 4 infusion), and 2 minutes (+/ - 2 
minutes) before end of infusion 
• Day 5, [ADDRESS_870029] day 4 start of infusion (prior to day 5 infusion), and 2 minutes (+/ - 2 
minutes) before end of infusion 
• Day 8, [ADDRESS_870030] day 5 start of infusion  
 Blood for circulating tumor cells (CTCs ) (optional) will be collected at baseline, on day 3 of 
cycle 1 (within 2 to 4 hours after  the start of LMP744 infusion), on day 1 of every subsequent 
cycle (prior to drug infusion), and at disease progression.   Tumor biopsies (mandatory in expansion phase) will be obtained at baseline and then on day 2 (1-4 hours after the LMP744 infusion) in cycle 1 only.

(NSC  706744) administered intravenously (IV) daily for 5 days (QD x 5) schedule in 
patients with refractory solid tumors  and lymphomas. 
 1.2 Secondary Objectives  
 
• Characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of LMP744 
1.3 Exploratory Objectives  
 
• Evaluate the effect of LMP744 on markers of DNA damage (γH2AX, pNbs1, pATR , 
ERCC1, RAD51 , Topo1cc, Top1, SLFN11) and epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] -mesenchymal transition 
(EMT)  in circulating tumor cells (CTCs)  and pre- and post- treatment tumor biopsies in 
patients at the expansion cohort 
• To assess preliminary anti -tumor activity of LMP744  
  2. BACKGROUND 
 Indenoisoquinolines are non-camptothecin inhibitors of topoisomerase I (Top1), an enzyme necessary for transcription, replication, recombination, and the repair of double- strand DNA 
breaks (1).  Top1 relaxes the supercoiled DNA by [CONTACT_2359] a single- strand break, generating a 
free strand that rotates around the Top1-bound DNA complex.  Once DNA is relaxed, Top1 re-ligates the break.  In the absence of external triggers, these Top1- DNA cleavage complexes are 
generally short lived and re-ligation is favored over cleavage (2). Top1 inhibitors are potent 
anticancer agents because they stabilize the formation of the cleavage complex, which induces replication transcription -mediated DNA damage, delays DNA repair, and results in cell cycle 
arrest and apoptosis.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_649172]1- inhibitor class, the therapeutic profile of 
camptothecin and its derivatives (such as topotecan and SN-38), has been offset by a number of 
shortcomings; including chemical instability induced by [CONTACT_649190] α -
hydroxylactone in the E-ring to a carboxylate exhibiting high affinity for human serum albumin, 
fast reversibility of the trapped DNA-Top1 cleavage complex following drug removal, drug resistance mediated by [CONTACT_533950] -binding cassette (ABC) trans porters, such as ABCG2 (MXR or 
BCRP) and multidrug resistance (MDR-1 or ABCB1), and dose limiting toxicities (DLTs).    Indenoisoquinolines were identified as potential Top1 inhibitors following a COMPARE analysis of the NCI ’s in vitro anticancer drug discovery screen (3).  They have improved 
characteristics over their camptothecin predecessors, with better chemical stability (lack of the labile hydroxylactone E-ring) producing stable DNA breaks that are resistant to reversal of the 
10 
 trapped DNA- Top1 cleavage complex  (2, 4).  Additionally, they trap the cleavage complex at 
different DNA sequences than camptothecins, which may result in differential activity within the 
cell (2).  Finally, indenoisoquinolines have been shown to have activity against camptothecin-
resistant cell lines and mouse models  (4).  
  Two of the indenoisoquinolines developed through the DCTD Developmental Therapeutics Program, LMP [ADDRESS_870034] already undergone clinical evaluation at the NCI  in 
patients with refractory solid tumors: the first- in-human phase I study of LMP400 and LMP776 
(10-C-0056, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) evaluated an intravenous (iv ) daily for 5 days (QDx5) schedule, and 
the phase I study of LMP400 (13-C-0080, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) evaluated a weekly  iv (days 1, 8, 15 
q28-day cycle) schedule.  For LMP400, an MTD of 60 mg/m
2/day was es tablished for the daily 
regimen and an MTD of 90 mg/m2 for the weekly regimen.  Although no objective responses 
were observed on either schedule, [ADDRESS_870035] response of stable disease.  T he TopI 
[INVESTIGATOR_649173] a subset of tumor biopsies, and the pharmacokinetics profiles demonstrated a prolonged terminal half- life and tissue accumulation 
compared to topotecan.  Dose-dependent decreases in total CTCs were measured in 7 patients, and formation of γH2AX -positive foci in CTCs and hair follicles were measured following 
treatment.  The principal toxicity of both schedules was myelosuppression; no significant gastrointestinal problems were observed.    Patients continue to be accrued to the LMP776 arm of 10-C-0056; [ADDRESS_870036] had stable disease SD with an average of 109.3 days duration (range 56 to 249 days).   The structurally related indenoisoquinoline LMP744 (NSC 706744), developed in parallel with LMP776 and LMP400, has also undergone extensive pre clinical evaluation .  LMP744 exhibited 
antitumor activity in rats without the dose -limiting neutropenia that occurred with similar dos es 
of LMP400 (unpublished data) and has shown marked clinical activity in dogs with lymphoma; LMP744 induced greater and more sustained reduction in tumor burden in these animals compared to either LMP400 or LMP776 (unpublished data).    2.1 Preclinical Activity  
 In in vitro hollow fiber activity studies at the NCI, the mean graph midpoint (MGM) for LMP744 growth inhibition of all human cancer cell lines in the NCI 60 cell line screen was 15.5 µM (5).  In in vitro studies, LMP744 inhibited TopI [CONTACT_1639] a similar extent as 1 µM camptothecin, and although camptothecin and LMP744 trap Top1 at similar sites on DNA, LMP744 was more potent (6).  LMP744 also inhibited Top1 in CEM human leukemia cells, and time course studies 
demonstrated that Top1-DNA cleavage complexes reversed more slowly after drug removal than those produced by [CONTACT_649191].  Notably, human CEM/C2 leukemia cells resistant to CPT were sensitive to LMP744 at 0.1 µ M (4). 
 LMP744 also had modest activity in human tumor xenograft models.  In the H CT-116/H1 colon 
tumor model, the highest non-lethal dose of LMP744, 33.5 mg/kg/dose (100 mg/m
2/dose) IV on 
a qdx 5 schedule, caused a mean tumor growth delay of 53% (%T/C=38).  In the A375 melanoma model , an LMP744 dose of 22.4 mg/kg/dose (67.2 mg/m
2/dose) IV on a qdx 5 
schedule resulted in a mean growth delay of 34% (%T/C=38 ).  Topotecan (NSC 609099) was 
11 
 more active than NSC706744 at a dose of 4 mg/kg IP using the same schedule. 
 Efficacy in a Comparative Oncology Trial with Canine Lymphoma (Protocol COTC007b) 
Antitumor activity was also observed with LMP744 in a canine clinical trial of 21 dogs with lymphoma.  LMP744 was administered via 1 h IV infusion qdx5 in 28- day cycles.  The MTD 
was determined to be 5 mg/kg (100 mg/m
2).  The waterfall plot below (Figure  1) shows the best 
overall response per RECIST criteria for each dog; t he majority (16/21) had partial responses 
(tumor shrinkage > 30%) and 5/21 had stable disease.  Responses were observed at all dose levels, with a single complete response occurring in Dose Level 2 (2.5 mg/kg or 50 mg/m
2).  
There was no correlation between dose and extent of response.  Another 12 dogs were treated at the study MTD in a planned expansion cohort.  The overall response rate (PR or better) for all animals treated at this dose (6 escalation  + 12 expansion) was 78%.  The overall response rate 
across all dose levels was 80%.  However, the responses were not durable, and most dogs had progressive disease in c ycle 1  (manuscript in preparation).

 2.2 Preclinical Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetics of LMP744 following IV administration were evaluated in IND -directed 
studies in rats  and beagle dogs and in a canine comparative oncology trial.  Plasma drug 
concentrations were determined using a validated LC-MS/MS method.  Non- compartmental PK 
parameters were calculated for each animal (Phoenix WinNonlin, Version 6.3).  Pharmacokinetics in Rats  
Rats (3 rats/sex/dose group) were given LMP744 at doses in the table below as a one- hour IV 
infusion on days [ADDRESS_870037]-infusion; then pre-dose and just prior to the end of infusion on Day 5.  On Day 1, mean Cmax (M + F) was 39.0, 234, and 259 ng/mL at 1, 5, and 10 mg/kg/day, respectively.  The mean AUClast was 110 hr*ng/mL, 399 hr*ng/mL, and 530 hr*ng/mL for the above doses, respectively.  The 
PR 
12 
 resulting plasma clearance was similar across dose levels (7.0 -13.7 L/hr/kg in males and females 
combined.  On day 1, systemic exposure, as represented by [CONTACT_649192] a dose-proportional manner between 1 and 5 mg/kg, but was not dose-proportional between 5 and 10 mg/kg.  Mean Cmax did not change significantly between Days 1 and 5, suggesting that LMP744 did not accumulate over the 5-day dosing period.  There was no difference in systemic exposure between males and females.  
 
 
Pharmacokinetics in Dogs 
LMP744 was given to dogs (8 dogs/sex/dose group) as a one-hour infusion qdx5 at the doses in the table above.  Blood samples were drawn from each dog for plasma drug level determinations just prior to the end of the infusion, and at 30, 120, 360, [ADDRESS_870038]-infusion on Day 1; then pre-dose and just prior to the end of infusion on Day 5.   On Day 1, mean Cmax (M + F) was 42.4, 230, and 294 ng/mL at 0.5, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg/day, respectively.  The T1/[ADDRESS_870039]-infusion in the LMP744 PK Parameters in rats (IITRI Study 2330 -013-001)

643 hr*ng/mL, and 1076 hr*ng/mL for the 0.5, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg/day groups, respectively.  Plasma clearance was relatively constant across dose levels (range 3.7 to 5.1 L/hr/kg) and the values were similar to those obtained in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602].  Systemic exposure on Day 1, as represented by [CONTACT_64072], increased in an approximately proportional manner over the dose range studied.  Mean Cmax (at end of infusion) did not change appreciably between Days 1 and 5, suggesting that LMP744 did not accumulate over the 5-day dosing period.  Systemic exposure tended to be slightly higher for male dogs compared with females (1.1 to1.6-fold for Cmax and 1.1-1.4- fold for 
AUCinf).  
Figure 2:   Plasma and tumor concentration -time plots from representative animals receiving 
LMP744 at the doses indicated  (Study COTC007b). 
 LMP744 was also evaluated in a multicenter comparative oncology clinical trial in dogs with lymphoma.  Drug (1.25, 2.5, 3.75, 5.0, and 6.25 mg/kg) was administered over 1 h IV daily x 5, in 28-day cycles.  Plasma samples were obtained for drug level determination during the infusion and for 24 hr after the infusion on days 1 and 5; levels of LMP744 were also determined in tumor biopsies obtained prior to treatment, at [ADDRESS_870040] infusion.  T he mean elimination half -life was 17 hr and the plasma 
clearance was 3.95 L/hr/kg , values similar to  those observed in the IND- directed PK -toxicology 
study at comparable doses.  Non -compartmental analysis also suggested linear relationships 

[ADDRESS_870041] animals at equivalent time points of 2, 6, and 120 hr (Figure 2).   
 Levels of LMP744 also appeared to increase in tumor tissue over the 5-days of dosing, with levels at 120 hr ([ADDRESS_870042] dose) approximately 10-fold higher than levels measured at 2 and 6 hr on day 1.  2.3 Preclinical toxicology 
 LMP744 was administered to Fischer rats and beagle dogs orally or as an intravenous infusion in pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]/range-finding studies using a single dose or multiple dose (daily x 5) schedule.  The data from these studies were used to select doses for IND -directed s tudies in which LMP744 was 
administered as a 1 -hr infusion once daily for five days (the intended clinical route and 
schedule).    An initial range -finding study in rats explored the toxicity of LMP744 administered as a single 
oral gavage or intravenous bolus dose.  Bone marrow toxicity was observed with both routes of administration.  Renal and injection site toxicity occurred only with the iv route.  The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using the iv route was >100 mg/kg or >600 mg/m
2; for the oral route, the 
MTD was between 500 and 750 mg/kg (3000 and 4500 mg/m2) due to lethality.  
 A definitive study was conducted in rats.  Doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (6, 30, or 60 mg/m
2/day) LMP744 were given as a 1-hr infusion once daily for 5 consecutive days.  Bone 
marrow, thymic, and renal toxicity and pulmonary thrombi were observed.  Decreases in total WBC, neutrophils, and reticulocytes occurred in all LMP744 dose groups.  Thymic atrophy was noted in the high dose group.  Adverse effects in the kidney consisted of elevated BUN in the mid- and high-dose groups and minimal and/or mild microscopic renal tubular degeneration in 
all dose groups including vehicle control.  Minimal and/or mild tubular single cell necrosis was also noted in mid- and high-dose group males.  On the last day of the study (Day 19), BUN values were normal in all dose groups.  Tubular single cell necrosis was absent on Day 19, and tubular degeneration was present at a lower incidence and/or severity at the same time point.  Tubular degeneration was not present in the vehicle control group on Day 19.  Pulmonary thrombosis occurred in all LMP744 dose groups on Days 6 and/or 19 and in one vehicle control animal on Day 19—incidence and severity were highest in the high dose group on Day 6.  The finding in the vehicle control animal suggests that the indwelling catheter contributed to the formation of pulmonary thrombi.  The MTD for the study was >10 mg/kg/day (>60 mg/m
2/day).  
LMP744 peak plasma levels and AUCs on this study were 39 ng/mL to 259 ng/mL and 110 hr∙ng/mL to 530 hr∙ng/mL, respectively, over the dose range studied.   A single dose non-GLP toxicology study was conducted using LMP744 as a 1-hr iv infusion in dogs.  Lethality occurred at both doses on the study (35 and 50 mg/kg) (700 and 1000 mg/m
2).  
Liver, gastrointestinal, bone marrow, renal, lung, injection site, and skin toxicity were observed.  A subsequent study in dogs was conducted using doses of 5, 25, or 50 mg/kg given as a 15- min 
iv infusion.  A dose of 50 mg/kg was lethal.  The MTD on this study was between 5 and 25 mg/kg (100 and 500 mg/m
2) due to liver, renal, and bone marrow toxicity.  A third study was 
15 
 conducted in dogs given LMP744 via a 1-hr infusion once daily for 5 days.  Bone marrow and 
GI toxicity occurred, but renal and hepatic toxicities were not observed.  The MTD for this study was 5 mg/kg/day (100 mg/m
2/day).  Allergic reactions (erythema of the eyes, face, and legs) 
were observed in dogs on all of the above studies.  This schedule (daily x 5) and rate of administration (1 -hr infusion) were used for the definitive toxicology study in dogs. 
 A definitive toxicology study was conducted in which dogs were given a 1-hr infusion of LMP744 once daily for [ADDRESS_870043] level (NOAEL) 
was 0.5 mg/kg/day (10 mg/m
2/day).  The MTD was between 2.5 and 5 mg/kg/day (50 and 
100 mg/m2/day) based on irreversible bone marrow, bladder, and liver toxicity.  Dogs that 
received 5 mg/kg/day had facial swelling, a potential allergic reaction.  LMP744 also caused hematological toxicity at doses of 2.5 or 5 mg/kg/day (50 or 100 mg/m
2/day).  Hematologic 
toxicity consisted of decreased total WBC, neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and reticulocytes.  Decreased bone marrow hematopoiesis was noted microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_347207] 5 mg/kg/day dose group.  Hepatic toxicity was observed in the 5 mg/kg/day dose group and was characterized by [CONTACT_649193], fibrinogen, AST, ALT, GGT, and total bile acids.  Bile duct hyperplasia and inflammation of the portal tracts of the liver were noted microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_649174].  Mononucle ar cell inflammation suggestive of hemorrhagic cystitis was 
noted in the bladder of one female given 5 mg/kg/day.   Based on the results of these nonclinical studies, the first -in-human dose (FHD) will be  
6 mg/m
2/day administered as a [ADDRESS_870044] non-severe toxic dose (HNSTD; 5 mg/kg/day = 
30 mg/m2/day) in rats, the more sensitive of the two preclinical species tested.   Target organs of 
toxicity identified considering both species were bone marrow, kidney, liver, bladder, and lung.  Allergic reactions (e.g. , facial swelling and erythema) may also occur. 
 2.[ADDRESS_870045] markers of DNA double-strand breaks is phosphorylation of histone H2AX, (γH2AX) (7 -9).  γH2AX is phosphorylated at its C -terminus (serine 139 in 
humans) within minutes following DNA double-strand breaks and forms macromolecular foci, marking the chromatin domain around the broken chromosomal DNA ends, thus allowing the recruitment of repair factors (7, 8, 10-12).  Levels of γH2AX directly 
correlate with the amount of double-s trand breaks per cell.  Hence γH2AX can be used as 
a dosimeter and biomarker for DNA double- strand breaks  (13).   
 In this study, drug- induced changes in γH2AX in circulating tumor cells and tumor 
biopsies will be measured by %NAP (representing the percent of nuclear area that is γH2AX-posi tive based on nuclear DAPI [INVESTIGATOR_1238] γH2AX staining) . γH2AX analysis will be 
complemented by [CONTACT_649194] -[ADDRESS_870046] that delayed repair of 
DNA double-strand breaks is resulting in tumor cell death.  In addition to apoptotic markers, tumor biopsies will be analyzed for autophagic activity based on expression of the autophagosomal marker LC-3. 
16 
  
2.4.2 Circulating t umor cells (CTCs)  
Recent progress in monitoring treatment responses of patients with breast cancer has 
provided evidence that a significant number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are present in peripheral blood, and these CTCs can be detected in a significant portion of patients with advanced disease.  Decreases in CTC levels were shown to predict disease- free and 
overall survival, independent of treatment, at the end of a treatment regimen (14 -18).  
CTCs in the peripheral blood of cancer patients may potentially represent a compartment of solid tumor cells that allows more frequent PD assessment of molecular drug action than it is currently possible using tumor biopsy procedures.  CTCs will be isol ated from 
whole blood samples collected at baseline and then throughout the study for assessment of DNA damage response markers such as γH2AX.  We will also evaluate whether we can measure changes in the number and phenotype (epi[INVESTIGATOR_018]- mesenchymal transit ion) of 
CTCs in patients over time to explore any correlation with response to treatment or disease progression.  This analysis will be performed in [CONTACT_52391]’ lab with the ApoStream instrument, which uses antibody independent CTC isolation technology that can isolate viable CTCs from epi[INVESTIGATOR_24603] l and nonepi[INVESTIGATOR_54578].   
 
2.4.[ADDRESS_870047] that levels of top1 in pre-dose biopsies may serve as a potential predictor of response to top1 inhibitors (18, 19).  Results from the FOCUS (Fluorouracil, Oxaliplatin, CPT- 11) clinical trial in patients with advanced 
colorectal cancer suggested a correlation between top1 levels and the efficacy of irinotecan -based chemotherapy; the overall survival benefit for patients with high levels 
of top1 (median benefit 5.[ADDRESS_870048] ratio 0.60) was substantially greater than for patients with moderate or low levels (median benefit 1.09, hazard ratio 0.92)(19) . Further 
clinical studies and analyses are ongo ing to confirm these results.  A validated 
immunoassay has been developed that could potentially provide a means of screening patients prior to treatment as well as monitoring patient response during treatment with top1 inhibitors.   
 2.5 Rationale 
 Indenoisoquinolines possess structural improvements over camptothecin and its derivatives (6, 20).  They have better chemical stability, produce stable DNA breaks that are resistant to the 
reversal of the trapped DNA -top1 cleavage complex (2, 4, 21) , trap the cleavage complex at 
unique DNA sequences, possibly leading to differential activity within the cell (2), and have shown activity against camptothecin- resistant cell lines (4). Based on promising preclinical data, 
specifically  in dogs with lymphoma, and data from studies of two related indenoisoquinolines, 
we are conducting this trial of LMP744 to evaluate its safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profile in patients with refractory solid tumors.

 5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 This is a multicenter phase I trial evaluating the intravenous administration (IV) of LMP744 over 1 hour on days 1-5 followed by 23 days without drug (28- day cycle, see Schema).  After cycle 1, 
the infusion may be administered over 1 hour +/ - 10 minutes.  After cycle 2, the start of a new 
cycle may begin up to 3 days earlier than it would otherwise be scheduled or be delayed up to 1 week to accommodate scheduling conflicts and other unexpected events.  LMP744 will be administered via central line.  I f the patient has a central line (such as a port -a-cath or a tunneled 
Hickman catheter) at the time of enrollment, treatment will be administered via this route.  If the patient does not have one, a temporary central line (such as a PI[INVESTIGATOR_6875]) will be placed and removed 
after the last treatment infusion of LMP744 . 
 
Patient evaluations will be performed throughout the study as described below.  Baseline history, physical examination, pre-treatment tumor biopsy, laboratory evaluations, urinalysis, and EKG must be conducted within 8 days prior to start of protocol therapy.  If protocol therapy is started within 8 days of the screening evaluations (see Section 3.4), the screening evaluations may be 
used as baseline measurements.  If >[ADDRESS_870057] be performed within 28 days prior to start of protocol therapy.   H
istory and physical examination will be done at baseline (within 8 days prior to start of protocol 
therapy), during week 2 of cycle 1, and at the start of every cycle thereafter (within  3 days prior 
to treatment).   
 Labs (CBC with differential; serum chemistries)  and urinalysis will be performed at baseline 
(within 8 days prior to start of protocol therapy), on D8 and D15 of cycle 1, on D1 and D15 of cycles 2 and 3, and then at the start of each cycle (up to 3 days before start of a new cycle).    Blood and urine s amples for correlative research studies will be collected as described in 
Section  9.  Tumor biopsies will be mandatory in the expansion phase.   
 CT scans will be performed at baseline (within 28 days prior to start of protocol therapy) , and 
repeat imaging scans will be performed every 2 cycles (every 3 cycles for patients on study for more than 1 year; every 4 cycles for patients on study more than 3 years).  For patients with 
[ADDRESS_870058]-guided biopsies (mandatory for patients in the expansion phase) will be collected at baseline 
and on D2 of cycle 1 for research purposes . 
 Baseline EKG (within 8 days prior to start of protocol therapy) and baseline ECHO (within 28 days prior to start of protocol therapy) will be performed .  EKG and ECHO will be repeated 
before  cycles 3 and 5  (up to 1 week prior to start of cycle) , and as clinically indicated  thereafter . 
 5.[ADDRESS_870059] be monitored in clinic 
for allergic/hypersensitivity reactions for a minimum of 1 hour after receiving drug  during cycle 
1 and as clinically indicated thereafter.  
 
5.1.1 Dose Levels  
 Dose escalation in this study initially followed design 3 of the Simon accelerated titration designs (26, 27).  This trial design minimizes the number of patients exposed to lower dose levels by [CONTACT_69972]-patient cohorts, reverting to a standard 3+3 design once a “stop decision” is taken.  Intra- patient dose escalation is permissible in the Simon design  3, and is separately 
described in  Section 6.2.  
As of Amendment G (10/18/18), a “stop decision” was taken and the study reverted to a standard 3+3 design. 
Dose escalation proceed ed initially with single patient cohorts per dose level, with 100% 
increments in dose level for the next single- patient cohort.  As of A mendment G (10/18/18), a 
“stop decision” was taken  at Dose Level 6  to revert to the 3+3 dose- escalation cohorts .  The 
subsequent dose levels are 40% increments in the dose until a maximum dose is reached.

 5.1.2 Dose Escalation Cohorts 
 
During the accelerated phase, there wil l be one patient per dose level .  The patient will be 
assessed for dose- limiting toxicity (DLT ) and  grade 2 toxicity (both parameters defined in 
Section 5.2) during cycle [ADDRESS_870060] 3+3 design, when: 
• one patient experiences DLT during cycle 1, OR 
• at the first instance of grade 2 drug- associated toxicity , when two additional patients will 
be enrolled .  If two different patients experience Grade 2 toxicity during cycle 1, t he 
escalation plan will end .   
 As of Amendment G (10/18/18), a patient on Dose Level [ADDRESS_870061] 3+3 design.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Standard 3+[ADDRESS_870062] cycle, dose escalation is permitted.   
 At the PI’s discretion, up to an additional [ADDRESS_870063] the dose escalation decisions.  
 
Number of Patients with 
DLT at a Given Dose Level  Escalation Decision Rule  
0 out of 3  Enter 3 patients at the next dose level.  
≥2 Dose escalation will be stopped.  This dose level will be declared the 
maximally administered dose (highest dose administered).  Three (3) 
additional patients will be entered at the next lowest dose level if only [ADDRESS_870064] 3 more patients at this dose level.  
• If 0 of these 3 patients experience DLT, proceed to the next dose 
level.  
• If 1 or more of this group suffer DLT, then dose escalation is stopped, 
25 
 and this dose is declared the maximally administered dose.  Three (3) 
additional patients will be entered at the next lowest dose level if only 
3 patients were treated previously at that dose. 
≤[ADDRESS_870065] be entered at the recommended phase 2 dose.  
 
The MTD is the dose level at which no more than 1 in 6 patients experience DLT, and the dose below that at which ≥ 2 (of ≤ 6) patients have DLT as a result of the drug.  If ≥2 patients 
experience DLT on dose level -1 for LMP744, the study will be placed on hold and all data reviewed to make a decision about furth er evaluation of the study drug. 
  
[IP_ADDRESS] Expansion Cohort 
 Once the MTD  is identified , another 15 patients will be treated at the MTD  on an expansion 
cohort.  With 15 patients and a biopsy QA failure rate of 50% with respect to paired biopsies, there is an 85% likelihood of having at least 6 usable samples and a 95% likelihood of having at least 5 usable samples . 
 With Amendment L (date 6/7/2021), the MTD is identified as  dose level 6 (190 mg/m
2/day) and 
the expansion cohort will begin accrual. 
 
5.2 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
 
5.2.1 Grade ≥3 non -hematologic toxicity will be considered dose limiting, with the 
following exceptions:

Twice weekly blood draws will be needed (after onset of grade 4 neutropenia) to monitor duration of neutropenia for the first 2 cycles.  On subsequent cycles (cycle 3 and beyond), weekly blood draws will be monitored at the onset of grade 4 neutropenia.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Thrombocytopenia: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia will be considered dose limiting.   Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding will be 
considered dose limiting.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Anemia: Grade 4 anemia will be considered dose limiting.  
 
5.2.3 Any neurotoxicity Grade ≥2 that is not reversible to a Grade ≤1 within 2 weeks will be considered dose limiting.   
 
5.2.4 Any non- hematologic Grade 2 toxicity that does not resolve to Grade ≤1 or baseline 
within 14 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_649176] 5.3 wil l be 
considered dose limiting, except for alopecia.  
 Management and dose modifications associated with the above adverse events are outlined in Section 6 . 
 5.3 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
No other approved or investigational anticancer treatment will be permitted during the study period, including chemotherapy, biologic response modifiers, or immunotherapy.  Palliative -intent single -fraction radiation therapy after cycle 1 is permissible at the PI’s 
discretion, but may not be administered concurrently with LMP744.  A delay of up to one week prior to starting a subsequent cycle of treatment will be permitted to enable marrow recovery .  No medications, including over-the-counter products, should be started 
without first consulting with the investigator.
 
 
5.3.[ADDRESS_870066] dose, only for 
subsequent doses if nausea or emesis occurs.  However, if a patient develops nausea/vomiting, anti- emetics, such as Ondansetron  will be instituted prior to  treatment .  
If nausea or emesis persists, a second agent such as olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_649177].   
5.3.[ADDRESS_870067] an identifiable cause other than study drug administration, 
anti-diarrheal (such as diphenoxylate HCl 2.5 mg + atropi[INVESTIGATOR_52339] 0.025 mg/tablet) 
dosed according to package insert or loperamide [ADDRESS_870068] unformed stool 
with 2 mg PO every 2 hours as long as unformed stools continue (4 mg every 4 hours while asleep).  No more than [ADDRESS_870069]-spectrum antibiotics, as well as an aggressive search for the source and microbial cause of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].   Growth factors to prevent neutropenia will not be administered prophylactically.  If necessary, they may be administered according to accepted American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines to allow re- treatment.  
 
5.3.4 Anemia  
Symptomatic anemia should be treated with red blood cell infusion, which is recommended if the hemoglobin falls below 8 g/dL.  The initiation of erythropoietic therapy for the management of chemotherapy- induced anemia follows the American 
Society of Hematology/ASCO clinical practic e guidelines . 
 
5.3.5 Thrombocytopenia  
Thrombocytopenia will be treated conservatively.  In the absence of bleeding, fever, or a necessary invasive procedure, platelet transfusions should be given for a platelet count ≤10,000/mm3.  If invasive procedure(s) is (28) planned, or the patient develops bleeding, platelet transfusions should be administered in accordance with the standard of practice, usually maintaining a platelet count above 50,000/mm
3. 
 
5.3.6 Tumor lysis syndrome 
At the discretion of the PI, patients at risk of tumor lysis will receive allopurinol 24 hours prior to the initiation of therapy.  Additional measures such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_649178], use of rasburicase, and urinary alkalization will be used at the 
discretion of the investigator.  
5.3.7 Allergic Reaction  
If a patient develops hives or swelling, the LMP744 infusion will be held and at a minimum diphenhydramine administered at a dose of 50 mg IV.  Other medications (such as steroids or epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) can be used at the discretion of the clinician.  Once the reaction has subsided, patients may  be rechallenged with the original dose of LMP744.  
In case the reaction does not subside within 2 hours or the patient develops a subsequent reaction on rechallenge, the study drug will be discontinued and the patient taken off study.  A grade ≤  2 allergic reaction will not be considered a DLT; pre -medication will be 
added to treatment on subsequent dosing if pati ents experience ≤ grade 2 infusion

 reaction.  
 
5.3.8 Inhibitors and Inducers of ABCG2 and P-gp 
LMP744 is a substrate for ATP-binding cassette transporter protein ABCG2 and P-gp.  
Unless medically necessary, avoid the use of strong inhibitors and inducers of these transporters.  
 
5.3.9 Cytochromes P450 Inhibitors and Inducers, and Inhibitors of Drug Transporters 
The pathways by [CONTACT_649197]744 is eliminated are not known.  Unless medically necessary, avoid the use of strong inhibitors and inducers of all major drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters. 
  5.4 Duration of Therapy 
 In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue until one of the following criteria applies: 
• Disease progression  
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
• DLT recurs after two dose reductions for DLT or no lower dose level exists (as described in Section s 5.1 and 6.2) 
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study 
• Noncompliance at the discretion of the PI 
 5.[ADDRESS_870070] dose of study drug is administered or until one of the following occurs: patient enrolls on another protocol, patient receives standard of care, or death, whichever comes first.  The follow-up will consist of a phone call between Days 27-[ADDRESS_870071] dose to evaluate adverse events that were ongoing and any new events that might be deemed related to the therapy.  Unacceptable toxicities (i.e., AEs related to the intervention) that have not resolved by [CONTACT_2006] [ADDRESS_870072]- treatment will be followed via biweekly phone calls until 
stabilization or resolution.  5.6 Criteria for Removal from Study  
 Patients will be removed from study for one of the following reasons: completed 30-day follow-up period, toxicities are unresolved but stabilized, patient enrolls on another protocol, or patient receives other type of treatment -intent therapy.  The reason for study removal and the date the 
patient was removed must be documented in the medical record.   6. DELAYS /DOSE MODIFICATIONS

6.1.6 If a patient develops hives or swelling, the patient will receive at minimum diphenhydramine as described in Section 5.3.7.  Once the reaction has subsided, patients may be rechal lenged with the original dose of LMP744.  In case the reaction 
does not subside within 2 hours or the patient develops a subsequent reaction on rechallenge, the study drug will be discontinued and the patient taken off study.  A grade ≤  2 infusion reaction will not be considered a DLT ; pre-medication will be 
added to treatment on subsequent dosing if patients experience ≤ grade 2 infusion reaction.  
31 
 6.2 Intra -patient Dose Escalation and De-escalation 
 
Intra -patient dose ESCALATION is permitted ONLY if:  
1. Patient s did not experience toxicity >Grade 1 that is possibly, probably, or definitely 
related to the study drug after one cycle at the initial dose level (subsequent cycles may be delayed up to [ADDRESS_870074] the end of the previous cycle of 28 days to allow for toxicities to resolve ). 
2. Higher doses have been evaluated and completed without a DLT. 
3. The patient’s disease has not progressed. 
4. There is no concern of cumulative toxicity. 
Doses may be escalated by [CONTACT_649200], provided conditions 1-[ADDRESS_870075] evaluated dose level NOT associated with DLT . 
If a patient experiences DLT during a cycle, the dose will be REDUCED  by [CONTACT_12691] (if there is 
a lower dose level, see Section 5.1.2) for the next cycle, provided toxicity has recovered to ≤ Grade 1 within 14 days after completing a 28- day cycle, and the patient’s disease is stable or 
responding.  If a patient is dose reduced twice and still experiences a DLT, then the patient would be removed from the study.  If no lower dose level exists, then the patient will be removed from the study.    6.[ADDRESS_870076] the end of the previous cycle of 28 days for resolution of toxicity.  Patients will be allowed up to 2 dose reductions.  If more than 2 dose reductions are required, the patient will be removed from the study.  For patients on dose level 1, only 1 dose reduction will be allowed (see Section 5.1.2).  
 6.4 Reporting and Exclusions  
 
6.4.1 Evaluation of toxicity: A cycle is defined as being [ADDRESS_870077] day of the 5- day treatment.  .  All patients who receive a dose of LMP744 will be 
evaluable for toxicity regardless of whether they complete a cycle.  If therapy is 
delayed, the next cycle day 1 will be the day therapy is administered.  
 
Patients who do not complete a cycle of therapy for reasons other than toxicity will be replaced.   
 
6.4.2 Evaluation of response: All patients included in the study who receive any treatment at all will be assessed for response to treatment, even if there are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible.  All patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be included in the main analysis of the response rate.  Secondary analyses may be restricted to patients without major protocol violations. 
 7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
32 
 Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
following list of AEs ( Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an observed AE ( Section 7.2) will 
determine whether the event requires expedited  reporting via the CTEP Adverse Event Reporting 
System (CTEP -AERS) in addition to routine reporting. 
 7.[ADDRESS_870078] (CAEPR)  
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_870079] (CAEPR)  
for  
LMP744 (NSC 706744)  
 
The Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of reported and/or 
potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform presentation of events by [CONTACT_6764]. In 
addition to the comprehensive list,  a subset, the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), 
appears in a separate column and is identified with bold and italicized text. This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting to NCI (except as noted below). Refer to the 'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements' 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf  f
or further clarification. 
The CAEPR does not provide frequency data; refer to the Investigator's Brochure for this information. Below is the 
CAEPR for  LMP744. 
NOTE: Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF  the y exceed the grade noted in parentheses next to the AE in the 
SPEER. If this CAEPR is part of a combination protocol using multiple investigational agents and has an AE listed on different SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to determine if expedited r eporting is required.

 7.5 NCI Clinical Director Reporting  
Problems expeditiously reported to the OHSRP/IRB in iRIS will also be reported to the NCI 
Clinical Director.  A separate submission is not necessary as reports in iRIS will be available to the Clinical Director.  
 In addition to those reports, all deaths that occur within 30 days after receiving a research intervention s hould be reported via email to the Clinical Director unless they are due to 
progressive disease.   To report these deaths, please send an email describing the circumstances of the death to the Clinical Director/designee at [EMAIL_1229] within one business day of learning of the death.  
 
7.5.1 Secondary Malignancy  
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation , or chemotherapy).  A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an NCI IND be reported via CTEP- AERS.  Three options are available to describe the event:  
 
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., a cute m yelocytic l eukemia 
[AML])  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
• Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
 
7.5.2 Second Malignancy 
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second malignancies require ONLY routine reporting via CDUS unless otherwise specified.

  8.1 Agent Ordering and Agent Accountability  
 
39 
 8.1.1 NCI-supplied agents may be requested by [CONTACT_079] (or their 
authorized designee) at each participating institution.  Pharmaceutical Management 
Branch (PMB) policy requires that agent be shipped directly to the institution where the patient is to be treated.  PMB does not permit the transfer of agents between institutions (unless prior approval from PMB is obtained).  The CTEP- assigned 
protocol number must be used for ordering all CTEP-supplied investigational agents.  The responsible investigator at each participating institution must be registered with CTEP, DCTD through an annual submission of FDA Form 1572 (Statement of Investigator), Curriculum Vitae, Supplemental Investigator Data Form (IDF), and Financial Disclosure Form (FDF).  If there are several participating investigators at one institution, CTEP-supplied investigational agents for the study should be ordered under the name [CONTACT_170739]. 
 
In general, sites may order initial agent supplies when a subject is being screened for  
enrollment onto the study.  Active CTEP -registered investigators and investigator-designated shippi[INVESTIGATOR_360398] (OAOP) application.  Access to OAOP requires the establishment of a CTEP

 9.1 Pharmacokinetics  
 Blood Samples 
Blood samples for PK analyses will be collected at the following timepoints in cycle 1 only:  
• Day 1, prior to drug administration, 2 minutes (+/- 2 minutes) before end of infusion, and at appropriate time points post infusion ([ADDRESS_870085] infusion) 
• Day 2, [ADDRESS_870086] day 1 start of infusion (immediately prior to day 2 infusion), and 2 minutes (+/- 2 minutes) before end of infusion 
• Day 3, [ADDRESS_870087] day 2 start of infusion (immediately prior to day 3 infusion), and 2 minutes (+/ - 2 minutes) before end of infusion 
• Day 4, [ADDRESS_870088] day 3 start of infusion (immediately prior to day 4 infusion), and 2 
minutes (+/ - 2 minutes) before end of infusion 
• Day 5, [ADDRESS_870089] day 4 start of infusion (immediately prior to day 5 infusion), and 2 
minutes (+/ - 2 minutes) before end of infusion 
• Day 8, [ADDRESS_870090] day 5 start of infusion  
 
The total volume of blood collected for PK studies during the initial treatment cycle is expected to be < 50 mL per patient.  Based on results from initial measurements, sampling times may be adjusted, but neither the total number of samples nor the total amount of blood drawn per patient will be increased.    
 
Samples will be collected in K2 -EDTA tubes with 3 mL of blood per sample.  Samples 
should be kept on ice until centrifugation.  All samples will be centrifuged at 2000×g at 4°C 
for 10 minutes and plasma will be stored at -70 ℃ for analysis.  Samples will be analyzed 
using a validated LC- MS or LC -MS/MS method for LMP744 in human plasma.  The plasma 
concentration -time data will be analyzed using the WinNonlin (Pharsight, Mountain View, 
CA) or other appropriate PK software.  The m aximum plasma concentration, time to 
maximum concentration, AUC extrapolated to infinity, and apparent terminal half- life will be 
calculated by [CONTACT_105]- compartmental analysis.   
 
The parent drug molecule and possibly metabolites in plasma will be analyzed by [CONTACT_649201]/Drug Discovery Program at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_21823].  This facility has extensive experience in the measurement of drugs and meta bolites 
41 
 in body fluids.  The laboratory has multiple HPLC instruments, including ultraviolet 
absorption detectors and several single- and triple-quadrupole mass spectrometers.

Please notify Robert Parise ([EMAIL_12347]) and Susan Christner ([EMAIL_12348]) 
(phone: [PHONE_13483]) at least 24 hours prior to shipment.  An alternate qualified analytical site 
(DTP or DTP contractor’s site) may be used, if necessary, for timely analysis of all samples.  9.2
 Pharmacodynamics 
 We plan to evaluate the in vivo molecular effects of LMP744 in CTCs and tumor biopsy specimens.  
 
9.2.1 Biopsy procedure and processing 
 
The timing of tumor biopsy samples will be at baseline (pre -treatment) and on day 2 (1-4 
hours after the LMP744 infusion).  Based on initial results from the trial, tumor biopsy timing may be adjusted, but the number of biopsies will not be increased without an amendment.  Tumor biopsies will be mandatory during the expansion phase.  Biopsies will be obtained on selected patients when lesions are safely accessible (including cutaneous, subcutaneous, and easily accessed parenchyma lesions).  Serial tumor biopsies will be obtained by [CONTACT_52377] a percutaneous approach  (if a SQ lesion  is identified, biopsies may be obtained by a 
surgeon or dermatologist) .  It is preferred that up to 5 core biopsies ≥ 18 gauge in diameter 
and ≥ [ADDRESS_870092] scan be needed for biopsy, the number of scans for each procedure will be limited to the minimum number needed to safely obtain a biopsy.  Tumor biopsies and local anesthesia will be administered only if they are considered to be of low risk to the participant, as determined by [CONTACT_90330].     If the participant chooses not to undergo the day 2 tumor biopsy, he/she will still remain in the study and receive study medication, and all the other correlative studies will be performed.   
42 
  
If an initial attempt at percutaneous biopsy is unsuccessful, the participant will be given an option to proceed with a repeated attempt at percutaneous biopsy.  In case biopsy samples cannot be obtained for a given participant, the participant will still remain in the study and receive study medication, and all the other correlat ive studies will be 
performed.  
 Up to 5 core biopsies will be obtained at each time point and processed according to the National Clinical Target Validation Laboratory (NCTVL) SOP 340507 (https://dctd.cancer.gov/ResearchResources/biomarkers/docs/par/ SOP340507_Biopsy_Frozen.pdf).  Briefly, cores will be transferred into a 1.5- mL pre -
chilled cryovial and then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.  Biopsies should be collected, placed in prechilled cryogenic vials, and frozen within 2 minutes of collection.   The frozen biopsy specimens should be transferred to PADIS on dry ice, where the core biopsy samples are stored at -80°C until processing.  Biopsies for PD analysis will be shipped via FedEx to:  Attention: Leroy Smith

For NCI Clinical Center specimens only : Shipment should be by [CONTACT_649202], FNLCR, Tel.: [PHONE_933]  Frozen biopsy samples will be used for molecular analysis , including γH2AX and cleaved 
caspase -3 measurement (apoptosis; as described in Section 2.4.1),  
LC-3 (autophagy), 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_018]- mesenchymal transition  (EMT) analysis, and DNA damage response (DDR) 
analysis.  The EMT panel will analyze the fraction of CTCs that are positive for vimentin and/or cytokeratin in conjunction with a tumor marker (UC1, CEA, or TFE1, depending on tumor histology).  The DNA damage response (DDR) panel will analyze levels of ERCC1, RAD51, pATR, pNbs1, Topo1cc, Top1, and SFLN11 proteins involved in the repair of DNA breaks.       I
f for some reason only one core is able to be obtained, the core will be divided, with half 
submitted to Surgical Pathology and half used for PD studies.  Priority will be given to 
performing γ H2AX and cleaved caspase-3 analysi s on paired biopsy samples. 
43 
  
9.2.2 Circulating tumor cells (optional)  
 
For the current protocol, optional blood for CTCs will be collected from patients at the 
following timepoints:  
• baseline (prior to drug infusion) 
• on day 3 of cycle 1 (within 2 to 4 hours after  the start of LMP744 infusion) 
• on day 1 of every subsequent cycle (prior to drug infusion) 
• at time of disease progression  
 
These samples will be used to determine:    
 
1)  The number of CTCs in the blood sample  
2)  Whether the level of γH2AX expression has increased (assessing the fraction of γH2AX expression in CTCs via immunofluorescence)   
3)  The dose response in the fraction of CTCs that is γH2AX positive  
4)  EMT panel (as described above)  
 
These values will be compared to baseline values collected from samples from the same patient.  At the NCI clinical center, each blood specimen (7.5 mL) will be collected into one 10 mL Streck tube (catalog number 218962).  One 10 mL RareCyte tube (catalog 
number 24-1070-005) is also acceptable.  Tubes must be inverted [ADDRESS_870094] tube or one 10 mL Streck tube as described in 
Appendix D  (kits will be provided).  Refer to NCI DCTD SOP LHTP003.08.19 for 
additional guidance regarding blood collection in a Streck tube: https://dctd.cancer.gov/ResearchResources/biomarkers/emt/LHTP003.08.19_Streck.pdf  
 Blood for CTC analysis will be shipped at room temperature to the PADIS laboratory on the day it is collected  as described in Appendix D .  Samples may not be held at the 
external site or shipped with frozen biopsy samples.  Prior to CTC collection, each outside participating site should e -mail a request for specimen collection and

 9.2.3 At NCI only:  Blood collection for ctDNA analysis in expansion phase patients 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Timing of ctDNA blood collection 
 
Plasma, derived from whole blood collected from expansion cohort patients (as of 
Amendment Q, 6/14/22), will undergo ctDNA assessment by [CONTACT_649203]500 panel to quantitatively assess longitudinal changes in ctDNA levels (as a percentage of total circulating, cell -free DNA) and to identify any tumor genomic alterations that may be 
associated with response or re sistance to the LMP744 treatment ; the results of these 
studies will not be returned to patients.  Once a patient has come off study, ctDNA from blood samples correlating to clinically informative time points (minimally, before treatment and at restaging scans suggesting tumor growth) will be analyzed.  Three whole blood samples of at least 7.5 mL each will be collected into  three 
respective 10-mL Streck tubes at each of the following time points and shipped to MoCha within 3 days for ctDNA analysis: 
• baseline (pre- treatment; up to 8 days prior to the start of treatment and within ± 8 
hours of the biopsy at this time point) 
• day 1 of every subsequent cycle (at any time) 
• at time of disease progression  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Blood specimen shippi[INVESTIGATOR_649180]: 
Blood specimens should be labeled with: 
• Sample type (e.g., whole blood) 
• Time point (e.g., C1D1 pre-dose) 
• Collection date and time  
• Sample ID, containing: 
o CTEP protocol number 
o Site LAO code  
o Unique patient ID ( Do NOT include patient name, medical record number, 
or initials ) 
o Consecutive 800- series  sample collection number (i.e., 800, 801, 802) 
 The 2 tubes for each time point should be designated using “A” and “B” (e.g., the two pretreatment specimens should be labeled 800A and 800B). 
For example, the sample ID for the C1D1 pre-dose ctDNA blood sample collected on 
Study [ZIP_CODE] for NCI DTC patient #004 should be: 100002_NCIDTC_004_800.  Ship blood specimens at ambient temperature to:

 11.2 Solid Tumors 
 Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [Eur J Ca  45:228-247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of 
the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 Patients should be re -evaluated for response every 2 cycles ( every 3 cycles for patients on study 
for more than 1 year; every 4 cycles for patients on study more than 3 years).  In addition to a baseline scan, confirmator y scans should also be obtained 4 weeks following initial 
documentation of objective response.  
11.2.1 D
efinitions  
 Evaluable for toxicity:  All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their 
first treatment with LMP744.  
 Evaluable for objective response:  Only those patients who have measurable disease 
present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for response.  These patients will have their 
response classified accor ding to the definitions stated below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit 
objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
 Evaluable Non- T
 arget Disease Response:  Patients who have lesions present at baseline 
that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated will be considered 
evaluable for non- target disea se.  The response assessment is based on the presence, 
absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
11.2.2 D
isease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease:  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
[ADDRESS_870101] one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 20 m m (≥2 c m) 
by [CONTACT_13190] x- ray or as ≥ 10 mm  (≥1 c m) with CT scan, MRI, or calipers by [CONTACT_461].  
All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters).  
 
N
ote:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not 
be considered measurable.    Malignant lymph nodes:  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥ 15 mm (≥1.5 c m) in short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_3610] (CT scan 
slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm [0.5 cm]).  At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.  Non-m
easurable disease:  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm [<1 cm]  or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm [≥ 1 
to <1 .5 cm] short axis), are considered non- measurable disease.  Bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered  as non- measurable.  
 N
ote:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) 
since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above.  However, if non- cystic lesions are present in the same 
patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 Target lesions:   A
 ll measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend i tself 
to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  Non-ta
rget lesions :  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non- target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up.  
49 
  
11.2.3 M ethods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.  Imaging- based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 Clinical lesions :  
 Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial ( e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm (≥1 cm)  diameter 
as assessed using calipers ( e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation 
by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.   Chest x -r
ay :  Lesions on chest x- ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.   Conventional CT and MRI:  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm (0.5 cm) or less.  If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm  (0.5 cm) , the minimum size for a 
measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g., for body scans).   
 U
se of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, t he 
availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality use d at 
follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible.  PET- CT:
  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET- CT is of identic al diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET- CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be 
[ADDRESS_870102] introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.    Ultrasound:  Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154].  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  Endoscopy, Laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  Tumor markers :
   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA-125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published [JNCI  96:487-488, 2004; J Clin Oncol  17, 3461-3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol  26:1148-1159, 
2008].  In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA-[ADDRESS_870103]-line trials in ovarian cancer [ JNCI  92:1534-1535, 2000]. 
 Cytology, Histology:  These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  T
he cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusi on may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 FDG -P
ET: While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
a. N
egative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion. 
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG- PET at follow -up:  If the positive FDG-
PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  If 
the positive FDG- PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal 
51 
 FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG- PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre-existing 
site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this 
is not PD. 
c. FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy 
in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in  the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623]- specific medical literature for the 
indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity. 
 Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image. 
 
11.2.4 R
esponse Criteria  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm (<1 cm) . 
 Partial Response (PR) :  
 At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 Progressive Disease (PD) :  
 At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstr ate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm  (0.5 cm).  
(Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).  Stable Disease (SD) :  
 Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]
 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
 Complete Response (CR) :  
 Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm [<1 cm]  short axis).  
 N
ote:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 Non-CR/
Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
52 
 Progressive Disease (PD) :  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.  Unequivocal progression 
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.  
 A
lthough a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_33954], and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investiga tor). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
 The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “ symptomatic deterioration.”   Every 
effort should be made to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

11.2.5 Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).

11.3 
 Lymphomas  
11.3.1 Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all signs and symptoms of lymphoma for a period of at least one month.  All lymph nodes and nodal masses must have regressed to normal size (≤1.[ADDRESS_870104] transverse diameter for nodes > 1.5 cm before therapy).  Previously involved nodes that were 1.[ADDRESS_870105] decreased to ≤[ADDRESS_870106] transverse after treatment or by [CONTACT_726] 75% in the sum of the products of the greatest diameters.  The spleen, if consider to be enlarged before therapy on the basis of a CT scan must have regressed in siz e and must not be palpable on physical 
examination.  Any macroscopic nodules in any organs detectable on imaging techniques should no longer be present.  
 
11.3.2 Complete response unconfirmed (CRu): A residual lymph node mass > 1.[ADDRESS_870107] transverse diameter that has regressed by > 75% in sum of the products of the greatest diameters, does not change over the last two treatments , has a negative PET 
scan, and any biopsies obtained are negative will be considered to be in CR.  In organs involved by [CONTACT_4623], any residual lesions that have decreased by > 75% in sum of the products of the greatest diameters or are < [ADDRESS_870108] two treatments will be considered to fulfill criteria for CR.  
 
11.3.3 Partial response (PR): 50% or greater decrease in the sum of the products of the longest perpendicular diameters of all measured lesions lasting for a period of at least one month.  No individual lesions may increase in size and no new lesions may appear.  
•Patients in PR with an estimated >80% reduction in initial tumor bulk whose measurable  
disease does not change between cycles [ADDRESS_870109] a negative PET scan after cycles 4 or 6 will be considered to be in clinical CR. 
 
54 
 11.3.4 Stable disease (SD): Tumor measurements not meeting the criteria of CR, PR, or PD.  
 
11.3.5 Progression (PD): Increase of 25% or more in the sum of the products of the longest 
perpendicular diameters of all measured lesions compared to the smallest previous measurements, or the appearance of any new lesion(s).

 Safety Monitoring Committee: Because this is a multi-institutional protocol for which the NCI CCR is the Coordinating Center, it will be monitored by [CONTACT_649208], NCI.  
 
12.3 Multicenter Guidelines  
 This protocol will open initially at the NCI.  The NIH IRB will be notified once the participating 
centers’ IRBs have approved the studies to open.  This protocol will follow the CCR’s Clinical Research Operations’ SOPs for multicenter trials.  
 
12.3.1 IRB Approvals  
As the Coordinating Center for a trial, it is the PI’s responsibility to ascertain that no patients are entered on the trial at a participating institution without full IRB approval.  Thus, the NIH  IRB 
must approve the addition of each participating institution to the protocol and will require a copy of the local IRB approval from each participating institution before NIH  IRB approval will be 
granted.   The PI [INVESTIGATOR_649183] a copy of the participating institution’s approved yearly 
continuing review.  Registration will be halted at any participating institution in which a current continuing approval is not on file at the NIH  IRB.  
 
12.3.2 Amendments and Consents  
The NCI PI [INVESTIGATOR_649184], consents, and approvals  
from each participating institution.  
 
57 
 12.3.3 Data Collection  
The investigators will be responsible for the collection, maintenance, and quality control of the 
study data.  Each site investigator is also responsible for maintaining all source documentation related to the study, including any films, tracings, computer discs or tapes.  NCI will be responsible for data management, data analysis, and reporting.  Data collection forms will be provided to the participating institutions.  Required data include, not exclusively: prior disease-related therapi[INVESTIGATOR_649185], disease type, stage, disease sites, with measurements, and concurrent medications.   
12.3.4 Human Data Sharing Plan 
What data will be shared?  We will share human data generated in this research for future research as follows:  
x De -identified data in an NIH -funded or approved public repository  
x Identified data in BTRIS (automatic for activities in the NIH Clinical Center)  
x De -identified or identified data with approved outside collaborators under appropriate 
agreements  
 
How and where will the data be shared?  Data will be shared through:  
x An NIH -funded or approved public repository: clinicaltrials.gov 
x BTRIS (automatic for activities in the NIH Clinical Center)  
x Approved outside collaborators under appropriate individual agreements  x Publication and/or public presentations  
 When will the data be shared?  
x At the time of publication or shortly thereafter  
 
12.3.5 Data and Center Audits 
Audits will be conducted yearly to ensure data integrity and provide quality control.  These audits will be conducted by [CONTACT_649209].  Selected patient charts should be audited as well as the participating institution’s Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) at the time of the visit.  Data from participating institutions should be available when the protocol is audited at the NCI.  
 12.4 CTEP Multicenter Guidelines  
 This protocol will adhere to the policies and requirements of the CTEP Multicenter Guidelines.  The specific responsibilities of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_131741] (Study Coordinator) and the procedures for auditing are presented in Appendix B. 
 
• The Principal Investigator/Coordinating Center is responsible for distributing all IND 
Action Letters or Safety Reports received from CTEP to all participating institutions for submission to their individual IRBs for action as required. 
 
• Except in very unusual circumstances, each participating institution will order DCTD-
supplied agents directly from CTEP.  Agents may be ordered by a participating site only 
58 
 after the initial IRB approval for the site has been forwarded by [CONTACT_131815] ([EMAIL_617]) (except for Group studies).

 N/A  13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 13.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 The primary objective of this trial is to establish the safety, tolerability, and MTD of LMP744 administered intravenously daily for 5 days in 28-day cycles, to patients with refractory solid tumors.  This study will follow design 3 of the Simon accelerated titration designs  (26), with 
dose escalation proceeding in 1-patient cohorts and switching to standard 3+3 dose escalation of dose levels when specific criteria are met ( Section 5.1.1).  ( N
ote: As of Amendment G 
[10/18/18], the study switched to standard 3+3 dose escalation.  As of Amendment I [9/25/19], there is flexibility to accrue up to an additional 3 patients on any dose level that has 1 DLT observed among 6 patients [see Section [IP_ADDRESS]].  As of Amendment L [date 6/7/2021], the MTD 
has been identified and the expansion cohort will begin accrual [see Section [IP_ADDRESS]].) 
 Following this, another 15 patients will be treated at the MTD on an expansion cohort, which will include mandatory biopsies.  With 15 patients and a tumor biopsy QA criteria failure rate of 50% with respect to paired (pre- and post-dose) biopsies, we have an 85% likelihood of having at least 6 usable PD samples, and 95% likelihood of having at least [ADDRESS_870113] obtained 6 usable paired samples.  With 6 PD sample pairs, there is 90% power to detect a treatment effect equivalent to 1.85 SD’s (associated with the intra -patient 
baseline variability of the PD marker) with the paired 2- sample T -test, at the [ADDRESS_870114].  PD variables may be log-transformed to 
achieve more nearly normal distributions.  DLTs will be summarized descriptively according to dose level.  In addition, the relation of dose level with presence or absence of DLT will be analyzed using logistic regression, as described by 
[CONTACT_52254] (20).   All AEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_649210].  In addition, the presence or absence of grade 2 or higher toxicity for each patient in each treatment cycle will be modeled using random effects logistic regression as described by [CONTACT_52254] (20), incorporating dose during the cycle and total dose for previous cycles, with intra-patient random effects.     13.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 As of Amendment G (10/18/18), if all dose levels are evaluated, we anticipate enrolling a minimum of 35 patients and a maximum of 47 patients.  In order to allow for a small number of patients who may not be evaluable, the accrual ceiling for this trial is set at 53 patients.  
59 
  
It is anticipated that 1 patient may be enrolled per month onto this study during the accelerated titration stage (already completed) and 1 -2 patients/month thereafter.  It is expected that [ADDRESS_870115] Selection  
This study will be open to all individuals regardless of gender, ethnicity, or race provided that the aforementioned inclusion and exclusion criteria are met.  For safety reasons, pregnant women and children are excluded from this study.  The NCI is the coordinating center for this multi-institutional study.  This study will be recruited through internal referral, our physician referral base, and through various cancer information hotlines (i.e., Clinical Studies Support Center, 1-800-4Cancer.)  Participant s should realize that there is no guarantee of benefit to them from 
participation in this trial.  The results of this trial may benefit future cancer patients.  To date, there is no information that suggests that differences in drug metabolism or effect on tumor would be expected in one ethnic group compared to another.  Efforts will be made to extend accrual to each representative population, but a balance must be struck between participant safety considerations and limitations on the number of individuals exposed to potentially ineffective treatments on the one hand and the need to explore racial/ethnic aspects of clinical research on the other hand.  If differences in outcome that correlate to ethnic identity are noted, a follow-up study may be written to investigate those differences more fully.

14.2 Justification for Exclusions 
Due to lack of knowledge on the effects of LMP744 on the fetus or infants, as well as the possibility of teratogenic effects, pregnant and nursing women will be excluded from this trial.  Participants with unstable or serious medical conditions are due to the possibility that the underlying condition may obscure the attribution of adverse events to study drug.    14.3 Particip ation of Children   
Participants under the age of 18 will be excluded from study because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available for the use of LMP744 in participants <18 years of age.   14.4 Evaluation of Benefits and Risks/Discomforts 
There may or may not be any clinical benefit to a patient from participation in this trial.  Their participation will benefit future cancer patients.  Potential risks include the possible occurrence of any of a range of side effects that are listed in the consent document.  The procedure for protecting against or minimizing risks will be to medically evaluate patients as described in Section 10.  Although no compensation is available, any injury will be fully evaluated and treated in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_481648].   
14.4.[ADDRESS_870116] scans solely for research purposes with a combined effective dose of 1.6 rem. This is below the guideline of 5.0 rem per year allowed for research subjects by [CONTACT_110712].  
 
14.5 Consent and Assent Process and Documentation 
An associate or principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_52350], alternatives, drug administration plan, research objectives, and follow -up of this trial.  The patient will be 
provided a study chart and a n IRB -approved consent for review and signature, and his/her 
questions will be answered.  After a decision is made to enroll into the study, a signature [CONTACT_52388].  The original signed consent goes to Medical Records; a copy will be placed in the research reco rd. Patients will not be consented by [CONTACT_756]. 
 All patients must have a signed informed consent form and an on-study (confirmation of eligibility) form filled out and signed by a participating investigator before entering on study.  Adults unable to give consent are excluded from enrolling in the protocol.  However, re-consent may be necessary, and there is a possibility, though unlikely, that subjects could become decisionally impaired. For this reason, and because there is a prospec t of direct benefit from 
61 
 research participation, all subjects ≥ age 18 at the NCI only  will be offered the opportunity to 
fill in their wishes for research and care, and assign a substitute decision maker on the “NIH 
Advance Directive for Health Care and Medical Research Participation” form so that another person can make decisions about the ir medical care in the event that they become incapacitated 
or cognitively impaired during the course of the study. Note: The PI [INVESTIGATOR_74840].  For those subjects that become incapacitated and  do not have pre-determined substitute decision maker, the procedures 
described in MEC Policy 87-4 for appointing a surrogate decision maker for adult subjects who are (a) decisionally impaired, and (b) who do not have a legal guardian or durable power of attorney, will be followed.   
14.5.1 Patient Advocate  
The patients’ rights representative is available to patients receiving treatment on this protocol at the NIH Clinical Center at ([PHONE_934] in Building [ADDRESS_870117] the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_90306], and that the patients’ rights representative is also availa ble to answer non-
medical questions about the study.

 APPENDIX B : CTEP MULTICENTER GUIDELINES  
 
If an institution wishes to collaborate with other participating institutions in performing a CTEP sponsored research protocol, then the following guidelines must be followed.  Responsibility of the Protocol Chair  
• The Protocol Chair will be the single liaison with the CTEP Protocol and Information Office (PIO).  The Protocol Chair is responsible for the coordination, development, submission, and approval of the protocol as well as its subsequent amendments.  The protocol must not be rewritten or modified by [CONTACT_36475].  
There will be only one version of the protocol, and each participating institution will use that document.  The Protocol Chair is responsible for assuring that all participating institutions are using the correct version of the protocol. 
• The Protocol Chair is responsible for the overall conduct of the study at all participating institutions and for monitoring its progress.  All reporting requirements to CTEP are the responsibility of the Protocol Chair.  
• The Protocol Chair is responsible for the timely review of Adverse Events (AE) to assure safety of the patients.  
• The Protocol Chair will be responsible for the review of and timely submission of data 
for study analysis. 
 
Responsibilities of the Coordinating Center 
• Each participating institution will have an appropriate assurance on file with the Office 
for Human Research Protection (OHRP), NIH.  The Coordinating Center is responsible 
for assuring that each participating institution has an OHRP assurance and must maintain 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_36419].  
• Prior to the activation of the protocol at each participating institution, an OHRP Form 310 (documentation of IRB approval) must be submitted to the CTEP PIO. 
• The Coordinating Center is responsible for central patient registration.  The Coordinating Center is responsible for assuring that IRB approval has been obtained at each participating site prior to the first patient registration from that site.  
• The Coordinating Center is responsible for the preparation of all submitted data for review by [CONTACT_36476]. 
• The Coordinating Center will maintain documentation of AE reports.  There are two options for AE reporting: (1) participating institutions may report directly to CTEP with a copy to the Coordinating Center, or (2) participating institutions report to the Coordinating Center who in turn report to CTEP.  The Coordinating Center will submit AE reports to the Protocol Chair for timely review.  
• Audits may be accomplished in one of two ways: (1) source documents and research records for selected patients are brought from participating sites to the Coordinating Center for audit, or (2) selected patient records may be audited on- site at participating 
sites.  If the NCI chooses to have an audit at the Coordinating Center, then the Coordinating Center is responsible for having all source documents, research records, all IRB approval documents, NCI Drug Accountability Record forms, patient registration lists, response assessments scans, x -rays, etc. available for the audit.  
 
66 
 Inclusion of Multicenter Guidelines in the Protocol 
• The protocol must include the following minimum information:  
• The title page must include the name [CONTACT_379563], telephone number and e-mail address of the responsible investigator at each participating institution.  
• The Coordinating Center must be designated on the title page. 
• Central registration of patients is required.  The procedures for registration must be stated 
in the protocol. 
• Data collection forms should be of a common format.  Sample forms should be submitted 
with the protocol.  The frequency and timing of data submission forms to the Coordinating Center should be stated. 
• Describe how AEs will be reported from the participating institutions, either directly to CTEP or through the Coordinating Center. 
• Describe how Safety Reports and Action Letters from CTEP will be distributed to participating institutions.   
 Agent Ordering Except in very unusual circumstances, each participating institution will order DCTD-supplied investigational agents directly from CTEP (See Section 8).   Investigational agents may be 
ordered by a participating site only after the initial IRB approval for the site has been forwarded by [CONTACT_36477].

Study Centers 
Planned:Multiple centers in the [LOCATION_002], [LOCATION_013], and New Zealand
Objectives: The primary objective of this study is as follows:
To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of filgotinib and its 
metabolite, GS-829845, in subjects with impaired hepatic 
function relative to matched, healthy controls
The secondary objective of this study is as follows:
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of filgotinib in subjects 
with normal and impaired hepatic function
Study Design: Phase 1, open-label, adaptive, single-dose study
Number of Subjects 
Planned:Up to 60 subjects enrolled for up to 48 evaluable:
Cohort 1 (ModerateHepatic Impairment): 20 subjects 
(10 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and 10 healthy 
matched controls for 8 evaluable subjects per group).
AdaptiveCohort 2 (SevereHepatic Impairment): 20 subjects 
(10 subjects with severe hepatic impairment and 10 healthy matched controls for 8 evaluable subjects per group).
Adaptive Cohort 3 (Mild Hepatic Impairment): 20 subjects 
(10 with mild hepatic impairment and 10 matched healthy controls for 8 evaluable subjects per group).
A subject with normal hepatic function may serve as a matched 
control across cohorts but may only serve as a matched control to 
one hepatically impaired subject within a cohort.
Subjects in adaptive Cohort 2 (Severe Hepatic Impairment) and 
Cohort 3 (Mild Hepatic Impairment) may be enrolled after the review by [CONTACT_347087] 1

70 years (inclusive), with varying degrees of hepatic impairment and 
matched healthy controls. 
Subjects with hepatic impairment will be enrolled based upon the 
Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) classification system indicating moderate hepatic impairment (CPT Class B; Cohort 1), severe hepatic impairment (CPT Class C; Cohort 2), or mild hepatic impairment (CPT Class A; Cohort 3). The control group will consist of matched 
healthy subjects with normal hepatic function.
Duration of Dosing: 1 day
Study Duration: Up to 15 days (not including screening window)
Diagnosis and Main 
Eligibility Criteria:Eligible subjects will be male and nonpregnant, nonlactating female 
subjects, aged 18 to 70 years (inclusive), body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 36 kg/m
2(inclusive), with either impaired hepatic 
function or normal hepatic function. Subjects will be current nonsmokers (no use of tobacco, nicotine-containing, or tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing products within the last 14 
days). 
Subjects with hepatic impairment will be categorized by [CONTACT_347088]:
Class A (mild): CPT score 5-6
Class B (moderate): CPT score 7-9
Class C (severe): CPT score 10-[ADDRESS_431263] been stable during the 3 months 
(90 days) prior to study drug. Each subject in the control group will be matched to a subject with impaired hepatic function by [CONTACT_654] 
(± 10 years), gender, and body mass index (± 15%).
Study Procedures/
Frequency:Following completion of Screening and Day -1 assessments, eligible 
subjects will receive a single oral dose of 100 mg filgotinib 
(1 x 100 mg tablet) on Day 1, in fasting state.
Dosing in subjects with normal hepatic function will begin after a 
matched subject with hepatic impairment has completed all Day 1 PK 
assessments.
Study Visits and Confinement
Following Screening and admission assessments, eligible subjects 
will be confined to the study center beginning Day -1 until the completion of assessments on Day 6. Subjects will return for an 
in-clinic follow-up (FU) visit on Day 15 (± 1 day).

CONFIDENTIAL Page 9 19 December 2017Statistical Methods: Pharmacokinetics:
Plasma PK parameters for filgotinib and GS-829845 will be listed and 
summarized by [CONTACT_42469] (normal or CPT Class A, B, or C) using descriptive statistics (eg, sample size, arithmetic mean, geometric mean, % coefficient of variation [CV], standard deviation[SD], median, minimum, and maximum). 
An analysis of variance appropriate for a parallel design will be fit to 
the natural logarithm-transformed PK parameters (AUC
last, AUC inf, 
and C max) for filgotinib and GS-829845. The 90% confidence 
intervals (CIs) will be constructed for the geometric least-squares mean (GLSM) ratio of PK parameters for filgotinib and GS-829845 in groups of subjects with hepatic impairment versus matched controls.
Protein binding of filgotinib and GS-829845 at their T
max and another 
later time point will be summarized by [CONTACT_347090].
Safety:
Safety data will be listed by [CONTACT_347091] (normal or CPT Class A, B, or C) and frequency of event/abnormality or descriptive statistical summaries, as appropriate.
Sample Size:
With 16 (8 per group) evaluable subjects, the estimated two-sided 
90% CI of the geometric least-square mean (GLSM) ratio of test vs reference groups, with regards to PK parameters (AUC and C
max) 
would be within (50%, 200%) with over 95% probability, if the estimated GLSM ratio were 1.0. This is assuming the SDs for PK parameters between subjects within each group is no more than 0.347(or 0.203) for the natural logarithm-transformed PK parameters for filgotinib (or GS-829845). Such assumptions are supported by [CONTACT_347092] a prior [COMPANY_009] study of filgotinib (GS-US-417-3900) with [ADDRESS_431267] drop-outs, so a total sample size of 20 subjects (10 per group) for each cohort will be required.
This study will be conducted in accordance with the guidelines of Good Clinical Practices
(GCPs) including archiving of essential documents.

Protocol GS-US-417-[ADDRESS_431270] decade, changes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment strategies, accompanied by 
[CONTACT_347093][INVESTIGATOR_014], have greatly improved the outcomes for subjects with RA. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_204932], therapeutic challenges remain. The current conventional and biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs are ineffective or produce only partial responses in some subjects and are associated with significant safety and tolerability concerns. There is an unmet medical need for simple, orally administered therapi[INVESTIGATOR_347076].
Janus kinases (JAKs) are intracellular cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (TYKs) that transduce 
cytokine signaling from membrane receptors to the nucleus of cells. JAK/ signal transduction and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathways are evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitous in animals and are activated by a variety of cytokines, growth factors, and other chemical messengers. Dysregulation of the JAK/STAT functionality is implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases, including immuno-inflammatory diseases. Janus kinase inhibitors block the signaling of various cytokines, growth factors and hormones, including the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6. Four different types of JAKs are known which (co-)interact with different sets of membrane receptors: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. Janus kinase plays a critical role in innate and adaptive immunity and hematopoiesis. The etiology of multiple inflammatory and autoimmune conditions may involve a combination of genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and ultimately a pathogenic inflammatory state.  This culminates in a loss of self-tolerance and expansion of T-cells that ultimately secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, which activate and signal other cells of the immune system (eg, macrophages, natural killer cells, and neutrophils) that infiltrate targeted tissue 
{Clark 2014} . 
Inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling is a therapeutic option for a range of inflammatory conditions including RA and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), two conditions with high and rising prevalence and significant unmet medical needs.
1.2. Filgotinib
1.2.1. General Information
Filgotinib (GS-6034, formerly GLPG0634) is a potent and selective oral inhibitor of JAK1 being 
developed by [CONTACT_10869], Inc. ([COMPANY_009]) and Galapagos (GLP) NV. Janus kinase 1 is believed to play an integral part in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases, due its role in inflammatory cytokine signaling.

information on the following:
Nonclinical pharmacokinetic (PK) and in vitro metabolism
Nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology
Clinical experience
1.2.2. Preclinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics and Toxicology
Filgotinib is a highly selective, adenosine triphosphate -competitive inhibitor of JAK1. In 
cellular assays, it inhibits JAK/STAT-driven processes with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
50) values from 179 nM upwards. In human whole blood assays, filgotinib 
exhibits approximately 30-fold selectivity over JAK2. Filgotinib demonstrated significant efficacy in the rat collagen-induced arthritis model as well as in the mouse dextran sulphate sodium -induced colitis model. Filgotinib’s metabolite, GS-829845, exhibits a similar JAK1 selectivity profile, but is approximately 10 to 20-fold less potent than filgotinib.
Filgotinib demonstrates good oral bioavailability in all nonclinical species and plasma protein 
binding is low (< 70%). The PK of filgotinib is generally dose proportional without gender differences. The mean terminal half-life after oral administration is [ADDRESS_431271] tissues throughout the body. High concentrations were observed only in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and urinary bladder. Filgotinib does not penetrate into central nervous system (CNS) tissues. The distribution of filgotinib indicates some affinity for melanin-containing tissues. Excretion occurs primarily via the urine and feces in rat and dog and is nearly complete within 24 hours (rat) and 48 hours (dog) post-dosing. The formation of the major metabolite, GS-829845, is mediated by [CONTACT_204958] (CES) and is not dependent on cytochrome P450 (CYP); in vitro experiments have shown that drug-drug interactions with filgotinib and GS-829845 are unlikely. There is no inhibition or induction of CYPs or uridine disphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), and no relevant inhibition of key drug transporters, by [CONTACT_347094]-829845.
In rats, filgotinib and GS-829845 had no effects on the respi[INVESTIGATOR_347077] (human ether-a-gogo related gene and dog telemetry studies), apart from a slight non-adverse increase in heart rate and arterial pressure with GS-829845, at exposures 14-fold that of the C
maxin human subjects dosed with filgotinib 
[ADDRESS_431272] any effects on fertility parameters.
In repeat oral dose toxicity studies in both rats and dogs, the primary target tissues identified for 
filgotinib were the lymphoid tissues which are expected based on the pharmacology of JAK inhibition. Additional filgotinib-related findings were observed in the male reproductive organs of both species, and in the incisor teeth of rats. Effects on the lymphoid system were fully reversible. Testicular toxicity demonstrated partial reversibility, however sperm counts remained

the curve (AUC) of 1.38 μg∙h/mL in subjects with RA, which represents an exposure margin of 
4.8, 3.7, and 6.9-fold when considering the mean AUC in male dogs at the no-observed-effect-levels in the 26-week and 39- week chronic toxicity studies, and the 39-week 
targeted exposure toxicity study, respectively. GS-829845-related findings in general repeat dose toxicity studies were similar to those of the parent filgotinib, however no testicular toxicity was noted following administration of GS-829845.
Filgotinib and GS-[ADDRESS_431273] not been evaluated in rats or rabbits.  
1.2.3. Additional Clinical Studies of Filgotinib
As of April 2017, filgotinib has been taken by [CONTACT_726] 348 healthy volunteers or special 
populations (15 subjects with renal impairment), 959 subjects with RA, 153 subjects with Crohn’s disease (CD) and 2 subjects with ulcerative colitis (UC), and has been generally safe and well tolerated. A detailed description of all clinical studies can be found in the IB.
In eleven Phase 1 studies conducted in healthy subjects (Studies GPLG0634-CL-101, -102, -103, 
-104, -105, -106, -107, -110, GS-US-417-3900, GS-US-417-3911, and GS-US-417-3916), filgotinib administered at doses of up to 450 mg once daily for up to 10 days was safe and well tolerated.
In two Phase 2a studies in subjects with RA (Study GLPG0634-CL-201 and -202), dosing with 
filgotinib was well-tolerated and achieved maximal efficacy at a 200 mg daily dose (American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement [ACR20] response of 75-92% at Week 4).
In two Phase 2b studies, filgotinib at total daily doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg, 
administered in addition to background therapy with methotrexate (MTX) (GLPG0634-CL-203) or as monotherapy (GLPG0634-CL-204) was safe and effective in subjects with moderately to severely active RA who had an inadequate response to MTX alone.
Currently, Phase 3 studies are ongoing in subjects with RA, UC (Phase 2b/3), and CD, and Phase 
2 Proof of Concept studies are ongoing in Uveitis, Sjogren’s, Lupus, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, small bowel CD and fistulizing CD.
1.3. Rationale for This Study
Hepatic disease may alter absorption, disposition, and elimination of drugs resulting in PK and 
subsequent pharmacodynamic changes. Hence, the objective of this study is to investigate potential changes in the pharmacokinetics of a single-dose of filgotinib in subjects with hepatic impairment. Since both filgotinib and its major metabolite GS-[ADDRESS_431274] steady-state PK and 
therefore is deemed satisfactory for this study. This is consistent with recommendations included in the FDA Guidance for Industry entitled “Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Impaired Hepatic 
Function:  Study Design, Data Analysis, and Impact on Dosing and Labeling”. 
This study will be conducted in an adaptive manner. Specifically, initial subjects to be enrolled 
will have moderate (CPT Class B) hepatic impairment (Cohort 1). Pharmacokinetic and safety data from these subjects will be compared to matched subjects with normal hepatic function. Review of Sponsor Safety and PK results obtained from Cohort 1 will indicate whether further evaluation in subjects with mild or severe hepatic impairment is needed. Dosing of subjects with mild or severe hepatic impairment will occur only after the review of safety and PK from 
subjects with moderate impairment in Cohort 1 (moderate hepatic impairment).
Based on PK properties of filgotinib, the “reduced PK study design” is considered appropriate 
following the FDA Guidance. In humans, filgotinib is highly metabolized to its active metabolite GS-829845, primarily by [CONTACT_347095] 2 (CES2) in the intestine and to a lesser extent by [CONTACT_63447]1 in the liver. Following a single dose of [
14C]-filgotinib, a majority of the dose 
(86.9%) was recovered in urine, suggesting that renal clearance is the main pathway of elimination for filgotinib and its metabolites. GS-829845 (54.0% of the dose) and its N-glucuronide derivative (14.6% of the dose) were the major species excreted in urine, followed 
by [CONTACT_347096] (9.37% of the dose). Among the 15.4% radioactivity recovered in feces, GS-829845 and filgotinib accounted for 8.88% and 4.47% of dose, respectively. Based on these data, significant changes in plasma exposures of filgotinib or GS-[ADDRESS_431275] hepatic dysfunction.
1.4. Rationale for the Dose Selection
A single-dose of 100 mg filgotinib will be tested in this study. This dose is expected to be well 
tolerated based on safety data from single and multiple dose studies in healthy volunteers and patients with RA or CD. As of April 2017, 1462 subjects (348 healthy subjects or special populations [15 subjects with renal impairment]), 153 subjects with CD, 2 subjects with UC, and more than 959 subjects with RA) have received single or multiple doses of filgotinib up to 450mg for up to 60 weeks in duration in clinical studies. Filgotinib is considered well tolerated 
across these dosing regimens in these subjects. 
Evaluating the 100 mg filgotinib dose in subjects with hepatic impairment is clinically relevant. 
Filgotinib is being tested at 100 mg and 200 mg once daily in Phase 3 programs in subjects with RA, UC, or CD. The 100 mg single dose is also chosen to ensure clinically safe filgotinib / GS-829845 exposures in study subjects in case of unexpected alteration in filgotinib PK by [CONTACT_347097]. Further, since filgotinib exhibits approximately dose-proportional PK, PK results from this study (ie, 100 mg single dose) can be extrapolated to other doses (ie, 200 mg) of filgotinib.

Potential risks of a participant’s study involvement include unknown AEs, general risks 
associated with frequent clinic visits and laboratory blood draws, and the associated pain and discomfort of phlebotomy.  Strategies to mitigate these risks include close monitoring of lab values as well as AEs.  For this study, frequent assessments of hepatic function will also be performed from the collection of both blood and urine samples. Parameters for discontinuation of the study drug due to AEs will be well defined and closely followed.
There is no direct benefit to subjects participating in this study; however, data from this study 
will support the development of filgotinib for the treatment of RA and other chronic inflammatory conditions. Potential benefits may include the participant’s contribution to the sponsor’s understanding of the PK, safety, and tolerability of filgotinib in subjects with hepatic insufficiency.
Considering the above, the benefit-risk balance for this study is considered positive.
1.6. Compliance
This study will be conducted in compliance with this protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), 
and all applicable regulatory requirements.

3.1. Study Design
This protocol describes a Phase 1, open-label, adaptive, single-dose study to evaluate the PK of 
filgotinib and its metabolite, GS-829845, in subjects with impaired hepatic function relative to matched, healthy controls. Up to 60 subjects will be enrolled (for up to 48 evaluable). 
Cohort 1 (ModerateHepatic Impairment): 20 subjects (10 with moderate hepatic impairment 
and 10 matched healthy controls for 8 evaluable subjects per group).Adaptive Cohort 2 (SevereHepatic Impairment): 20 subjects (10 subjects with severe hepatic 
impairment and 10 healthy matched controls for 8 evaluable subjects per group).Adaptive Cohort 3 (Mild Hepatic Impairment): 20 subjects (10 subjects with mild hepatic 
impairment and 10 healthy matched controls for 8 evaluable subjects per group).Male and nonpregnant, nonlactating female subjects aged 18 through 70 years, inclusive, with 
severely impaired, moderately impaired, mildly impaired, and normal hepatic function will be enrolled into the study.  Subjects will be current nonsmokers (no use of tobacco, nicotine-containing or THC-containing products within the last 14 days). Each subject in the control group will be matched to a subject with impaired hepatic function by [CONTACT_654] (± 10 years), gender, and body mass index (± 15%). A subject with normal hepatic function may serve as a matched control across cohorts but may only serve as a matched control to one hepatic impaired subject within a cohort.
Subjects in adaptive Cohort 2 (Severe Hepatic Impairment) and Cohort 3 (Mild Hepatic 
Impairment) may be enrolled after the review by [CONTACT_347087] 1 (Moderate Hepatic Impairment).
An overview of the study design is described below and shown in Figure 3-1.

Protocol GS-US-417-[ADDRESS_431279] Selection
Up to 60 unique subjects will be enrolled in the study. Eligible subjects include male and 
nonpregnant, nonlactating female subjects of 18 through 70 years of age, inclusive, with varying degrees of hepatic impairment and matched healthy controls. If necessary, replacement subjects may be enrolled if subjects do not complete all intensive PK procedures with sponsor approval. Replacement subjects will not be enrolled for subjects who discontinue the study due to study 
drug-related AEs.
Those subjects with hepatic impairment will be categorized based upon the CPT classification 
system indicating hepatic impairment as recommended by [CONTACT_347098](EMA) and international guidance documents { U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER); Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) 2003 }. Within the CPT system, 
subjects will be assigned to Class A, B, or C (CPT Class A, B, or C) based on a cumulative score evaluating the presence and severity of hyperbilirubinemia, hypoalbuminemia, prolongation of INR for coagulation time, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. Classification of hepatic 
impairment will be assigned as follows:
Mild: Class A, CPT score of 5-6
Moderate: Class B, CPT score of 7-9
Severe: Class C, CPT score of 10-[ADDRESS_431280] with impaired hepatic function by [CONTACT_654] (± 10 years), gender, and body mass index 
(± 15%).

CONFIDENTIAL Page 42 19 December [ZIP_CODE].9.7. Adverse Events/Concomitant Medications/Protocol Restrictions
Evaluation for AEs, review of concomitant medications, and review of protocol restrictions will 
occur at the times shown in Table 6-1. See Section 7for more information regarding AEs and 
Sections 4.3and5.6.[ADDRESS_431303] a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can, therefore,be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. Adverse events may also include pre- or posttreatment complications that occur as a result of protocol-specified procedures, lack of efficacy, overdose, drug abuse/misuse reports, or occupational exposure. Preexisting events that increase in severity or change in nature during or as a consequence of participation in the clinical study will also be considered AEs.
An AE does not include the following:
Medical or surgical procedures such as surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, and transfusion. 
The condition that led to the procedure may be an AE and must be reported.
Preexisting diseases, conditions, or laboratory abnormalities present or detected before the screening visit that do not worsen
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63805], social and/or convenience admissions)
Overdose without clinical sequelae (see Section 7.6)
Any medical condition or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an onset date 
before the consent form is signed and that is not related to a protocol-associated procedure is not an AE. It is considered to be preexisting and should be documented on the medical history eCRF.
7.1.2. Serious Adverse Events
A SAE is defined as an event that, at any dose, results in the following:
Death
Life-threatening (Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an 
event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.)
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_90251]-US-417-4048 Final
[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. Original
CONFIDENTIAL Page 44 19 December 2017Persistent or significant disability/incapacity
A congenital anomaly/birth defect
A medically important event or reaction; such events may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_347083]. Medical and scientific judgment must be exercised to determine whether such an event is a reportable under expedited reporting rules. Examples of medically important events include intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; and development of drug dependency or drug abuse. For the avoidance of doubt, infections resulting from contaminated medicinal product will be considered a medically important event and subject to expedited reporting 
requirements.
7.2. Assessment of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
The investigator or qualified subinvestigator is responsible for assessing AEs and SAEs for 
causality and severity, and for final review and confirmation of accuracy of event information 
and assessments.
7.2.1. Assessment of Causality for Study Drugs and Procedures
The investigator or qualified subinvestigator is responsible for assessing the relationship to study 
drug using clinical judgment and the following considerations:
No: Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the study drug. For SAEs, an 
alternative causality must be provided (eg, preexisting condition, underlying disease, 
intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication).
Yes: There is reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_5257].
It should be emphasized that ineffective treatment should not be considered as causally related in 
the context of AE reporting. 
The relationship to study procedures (eg, invasive procedures such as venipuncture or biopsy) 
should be assessed using the following considerations:
No: Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the study procedure.
Yes: The AE occurred as a result of protocol procedures (eg, venipuncture).
7.2.2. Assessment of Severity 
The severity of AEs will be graded using the modified Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. For each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the highest grade attained should be reported.
Filgotinib
Protocol GS-US-417-[ADDRESS_431304], the investigator should use the grade or adjectives: Grade 1 
(mild), Grade 2 (moderate), Grade 3 (severe), Grade 4 (life-threatening) or Grade 5 (fatal) to describe the maximum intensity of the adverse event. For purposes of consistency with the modified CTCAE, these intensity grades are defined in Table 7-1 and Appendix 4.
Table7-1 . Grading of Adverse Event Severity
Grade Adjective Description
Grade 1 MildAsymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only;

7.3. Investigator Requirements and Instructions for Reporting Adverse Events 
and Serious Adverse Events to [COMPANY_009]
7.3.1. Requirements for Collection Prior to Study Drug Initiation
After obtaining informed consent, but prior to initiation of study drug, all SAEs and AEs related 
to protocol-mandated procedures should be reported on the eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse EventsFollowing initiation of study treatment, collect all AEs, regardless of cause or relationship, until 
[ADDRESS_431305] that certain AEs be followed beyond the protocol-defined FU period.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse EventsAll SAEs, regardless of cause or relationship, that occurs after the subject first consents to 
participate in the study (ie, signing the informed consent) and throughout the duration of the study, including the protocol-required post treatment FU period, must be reported to the eCRF database and Pharmacovigilance & Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] (PVE) as instructed. This also includes any SAEs resulting from protocol-associated procedures performed after informed consent is signed.
Filgotinib

Email: 
As soon as it is possible to do so, any SAE reported via paper must be transcribed into the 
eCRF database according to instructions in the eCRF completion guidelines.
If an SAE has been reported via a paper form because the eCRF database has been locked, no 
further action is necessary.
All AEs and SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF database within the timelines outlined in the 
eCRF completion guideline. 
For fatal or life-threatening events, copi[INVESTIGATOR_3103], autopsy reports, and other documents are also to be submitted by [CONTACT_82234]. Transmission of such documents should occur without personal subject identification, 
maintaining the traceability of a document to the subject identifiers.
Additional information may be requested to ensure the timely completion of accurate safety 
reports.
Any medications necessary for treatment of the SAE must be recorded onto the concomitant medication section of the subject’s eCRF and the event description section of the SAE form.[COMPANY_003][COMPANY_003]

Assessment of expectedness for SAEs will be determined by [CONTACT_347106]. 
All investigators will receive a safety letter notifying them of relevant S[LOCATION_003]R reports associated 
with any study drug. The investigator should notify the IRB or IEC of S[LOCATION_003]R reports as soon as is practical, where this is required by [CONTACT_19709], and in accordance with the local institutional policy. 
7.5. Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities
Laboratory abnormalities are usually not recorded as AEs or SAEs.  However, laboratory 
abnormalities (eg, clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) independent of the underlying medical condition that require medical or surgical intervention or lead to interventional medicinal product interruption or discontinuation must be recorded as an AE, as well as an SAE, if applicable.  In addition, laboratory or other abnormal assessments (eg, ECG, X-rays, vital signs) that are associated with signs and/or symptoms must be recorded as an AE or SAE if they meet the definition of an AE (or SAE) as described in Sections 7.1.[ADDRESS_431307] the syndrome or diagnosis (eg, anemia) not the laboratory result (eg, decreased hemoglobin).
Adverse events will be coded using the most recent version of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Severity should be recorded and graded according to themodified CTCAE, version 4.03 ( Appendix 4).
For AEs associated with laboratory abnormalities, the event should be graded on the basis of the clinical severity in the context of the underlying conditions; this may or may not be in agreement with the grading of the laboratory abnormality.
All clinical and clinically significant laboratory toxicities will be managed according to uniform 
guidelines detailed in Appendix 3.

7.7. Special Situations Reports
7.7.1. Definitions of Special Situations
Special situation reports include: all reports of medication error, abuse, misuse, overdose;
occupational exposure with an AE; AEs in an infant following exposure from breastfeeding;reports of AEs associated with product complaints; and pregnancy reports regardless of an associated AE.  
Medication error is any unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing, or administration of a 
medicinal product while in the control of the health care provider, subject, or consumer.
Abuse is defined as persistent or sporadic intentional excessive use of a medicinal product by a 
subject.
Misuse is defined as any intentional and inappropriate use of a medicinal product that is not in 
accordance with the protocol instructions or the local prescribing information.
An overdose is defined as an accidental or intentional administration of a quantity of a medicinal 
product given per administration or cumulatively that is above the maximum recommended dose as per protocol or in the product labelling (as it applies to the daily dose of the subject in question). In cases of a discrepancy in drug accountability, overdose will be established only when it is clear that the subject has taken the excess dose(s). Overdose cannot be established when the subject cannot account for the discrepancy except in cases in which the investigator has reason to suspect that the subject has taken the additional dose(s).
Product complaint is defined as complaints arising from potential deviations in the manufacture, 
packaging, or distribution of the medicinal product.  
Occupational exposure is the exposure to a medicinal product as a result of one's professional or 
non-professional occupation.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 52 19 December [ZIP_CODE].3. Data Handling Conventions
For summary statistics, PK concentration values below the limit of quantitation will be treated as 
zero at predose and 1-half of the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) for postdose time points.
Laboratory data that are continuous in nature but are less than the LLOQ or above the upper limit 
of quantitation will be imputed to the value of the lower or upper limit minus or plus 1 significant digit, respectively (eg, if the result of a continuous laboratory test is < 20, a value of 
19 will be assigned; if the result of a continuous laboratory test is < 20.0, a value of 19.9 will be 
assigned).
Missing data can have an impact upon the interpretation of the study data. As this study is of 
short duration, it is anticipated that missing data will be minimal. In general, values for missing data will not be imputed. However, a missing pretreatment laboratory result would be treated as 
normal (ie, no toxicity grade) for the laboratory abnormality summary.
8.4. Demographic Data and Baseline Characteristics
Demographic and baseline measurements, such as height, weight and BMI, will be summarized 
and descriptive statistics will be provided. 
Demographic summaries will include sex, race/ethnicity, enrollment, and age.

Clinical and laboratory AEs will be coded using the current version of MedDRA. System organ 
class (SOC), high-level group term, high-level term , preferred term (PT), and lower-level term 
will be attached to the clinical database.
Adverse event data will be listed by [CONTACT_1130]. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), serious TEAEs, 
and TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study will be summarized by [CONTACT_42469], 
SOC, and PT using the current version of MedDRA. 
Filgotinib
Protocol GS-US-417-[ADDRESS_431313] laboratory results will be provided. Laboratory results and change 
from predose values for selected lab tests will be summarized by [CONTACT_347110]. The incidence of treatment-emergent graded laboratory abnormalities will be summarized by [CONTACT_42469].
8.6.4. Other Safety Evaluations
Vital signs and ECG data will be summarized by [CONTACT_42469].
8.7. Pharmacokinetic Analysis
Plasma concentrations over sampling time and PK parameters (C
max, Tmax, Clast, Tlast, λz, AUC last, 
AUC inf, %AUC exp, t½, CL/F, and V z/F, as appropriate)for filgotinib and GS-829845 will be listed 
and summarized by [CONTACT_347111] (eg, sample size, mean, 
SD, %CV, median, first quartile, third quartile, minimum, and maximum).
An analysis of variance appropriate for a parallel design will be fitted to the natural logarithmic 
transformation of PK parameters (AUC last, AUC inf, and C max) for filgotinib and GS-829845. 
Two-sided 90% CIs will be calculated for the GLSM ratios of PK parameters between hepatic impairment group versus the matched control (normal hepatic function) group. If the 2-sided 90% CIs of the GLSM ratio for AUC
last, AUC inf, and C maxof filgotinib or GS-829845 falls within 
the [50%, 200%] bound, the null hypothesis that subjects with hepatic impairment exhibit PK parameter change of at least 2-fold for filgotinib or GS-829845 compared with subjects with normal liver function will be rejected.
Protein binding of filgotinib and GS-829845 at their T
max and another later time point will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_347111]. Unbound PK parameters such 
as CLu/F, and Vzu/F will be calculated as appropriate and summarized by [CONTACT_347112]. Relationships between measures of hepatic function (ie, CPT score, serum albumin, total bilirubin, prothrombin time, and International Normalized Ratio [INR]) and primary filgotinib/GS-829845 PK parameters will be evaluated.
8.8. Sample Size
With 16 (8 per group) evaluable subjects, the estimated two-sided 90% CI of the geometric 
least-square mean (GLSM) ratio of test vs reference groups, with regards to PK parameters (AUC and C
max) would be within (50%, 200%) with over 95% probability, if the estimated 
GLSM ratio were 1.0. This is assuming the SDs for PK parameters between subjects within each group is no more than 0.347 (or 0.203) for the natural logarithm-transformed PK parameters for filgotinib (or GS-829845). Such assumptions are supported by [CONTACT_347092] a prior [COMPANY_009] study of filgotinib (GS-US-417-3900) with [ADDRESS_431314] drop-outs, so a total sample size of 20 subjects (10 per group) for each cohort will be required.

Each ICF will be appropriately signed and dated by [CONTACT_29159]’s legally authorized representative and the person conducting the consent discussion, and also by [CONTACT_347113]/EC local requirements.
9.1.4. Confidentiality
The investigator must assure that subjects’ anonymity will be strictly maintained and that their 
identities are protected from unauthorized parties. Only subject initials, date of birth, another unique identifier (as allowed by [CONTACT_1769]), and an identification code will be recorded on any form or biological sample submitted to the sponsor, IRB/EC, or laboratory. Laboratory specimens must be labeled in such a way as to protect subject identity while allowing the results to be recorded to the proper subject. Refer to specific laboratory instructions or in accordance with local regulations. NOTE: The investigator must keep a screening log showing codes, names, and addresses for all subjects screened and for all subjects enrolled in the study. Subject data will 
be processed in accordance with all applicable regulations.
The investigator agrees that all information received from [COMPANY_009], including but not limited to the 
IB, this protocol, eCRF, the study drug, and any other study information, remain the sole and exclusive property of [COMPANY_009] during the conduct of the study and thereafter. This information is not to be disclosed to any third party (except employees or agents directly involved in the conduct of the study or as required by [CONTACT_2371]) without prior written consent from [COMPANY_009]. The investigator further agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure by [CONTACT_347114].
9.1.5. Study Files and Retention of Records
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study 
to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. These documents should be classified into at least the following 2 categories: (1) investigator’s study file and (2) subject 
clinical source documents.

Subsequent to 
data entry, a study monitor will perform source data verification within the electronic data capture system. Original entries as well as any changes to data fields will be stored in the audit trail of the system. Prior to database lock (or any interim time points as described in the clinical data management plan), the investigator will use his/her login credentials to confirm that the forms have been reviewed, and that the entries accurately reflect the information in the source documents. The eCRF captures the data required per the protocol schedule of events and procedures. System-generated or manual queries will be issued to the investigative site staff as data discrepancies are identified by [CONTACT_347115], correctness, and consistency. The site coordinator is responsible for responding to the queries in a timely manner, within the system, either by [CONTACT_204983], and providing the reason for the update (eg, data entry error). At the conclusion of the study, [COMPANY_009] will pr ovide the site with a read-only archive copy 
of the data entered by [CONTACT_10867]. This archive must be stored in accordance with the records retention requirements outlined in Section 9.1.5.
9.1.7. Study Drug Accountability and Return
Where possible, IMP should be destroyed at the site. At the start of the study, the study monitor 
will evaluate each study center’s IMP disposal procedures and provide appropriate instruction for disposal or return of IMP supplies. If the site has an appropriate standard operating procedure(SOP) for drug destruction as determined by [CONTACT_10869], the site may destroy used (empty or partially empty) and unused IMP supplies as long as performed in accordance with the site’s SOP. This can occur only after the study monitor has performed drug accountability during an on-site monitoring visit.
A copy of the site’s IMP Disposal SOP or written procedure (signed and dated by [CONTACT_42038]) will be obtained for [COMPANY_009] site files. If the site does not have acceptable procedures in place, arrangements will be made between the site and [COMPANY_009](or [COMPANY_009]’s representative) for return of unused study drug supplies. If IMP is destroyed on site, the investigator must maintain accurate records for all IMPs destroyed. Upon study completion, copi[INVESTIGATOR_347084]. Another copy will be returned to [COMPANY_009].

Appendix 1. Investigator Signature [CONTACT_347118] 2. Management of Clinical and Laboratory Adverse EventsAppendix 3. Pregnancy Precautions, Definition for Female of Childbearing Potential, and 
Contraceptive Requirements
Appendix 4. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.[ADDRESS_431321] agree to the use of
highly effective contraception as outlined below.
1) Definitions
a) Definition of Childbearing Potential
For the purposes of this study, a female born subject is considered of childbearing potential 
following the initiation of puberty (Tanner stage 2) until becoming postmenopausal unless the subject is permanently sterile or has medically documented ovarian failure.  
Women are considered to be in a postmenopausal state when they are > 54 years of age with 
cessation of previously occurring menses for > 12 months without an alternative cause. In 
addition, women of < 54 years of age with amenorrhea of ≥ [ADDRESS_431322] of any age. Bilateral tubal ligation is not considered permanent sterilization.
b) Definition of Male Fertility
For the purposes of this study, a male born subject is considered of fertile after the initiation of 
puberty unless the subject is permanently sterile by [CONTACT_210192]. Vasectomy is not considered permanent sterilization.
2) Contraception Requirements for Female Subjects
a) Study Drug Effects on Pregnancy and Hormonal Contraception
Filgotinib is contraindicated in pregnancy as there is a possibility of human 
teratogenicity/fetotoxicity in early pregnancy based on non-clinical data. Data from a drug-drug interaction study of filgotinib and hormonal contraceptives (GS-US-417-3916) demonstrated that filgotinib does not alter the pharmacokinetics of a representative hormonal contraceptivelevonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol.
Filgotinib
Protocol GS-US-417-4048 Final
[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. Original
CONFIDENTIAL Page 65 19 December 2017For female subjects, hormonal contraceptives will be permitted as a form of contraception when 
used a conjunction with a barrier method (preferably a male condom). For male subjects, male condom should be used; for their female partners of childbearing potential, an accepted contraceptive method should also be considered. Details are outlined below.
Please refer to the latest version of the filgotinib IB for additional information.
b) Contraception Requirements for Female Subjects
The inclusion of female subjects of childbearing potential requires the use of highly effective 
contraceptive measures. Women must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening and on Day -1 prior to study drug treatment. Pregnancy tests will be performed throughout the study period (refer to Table 6-1 ).
Female subjects must agree to use one of the following methods (where permitted and used per local prescribing label) from Screening until [ADDRESS_431323] dose of study drug.
Complete abstinence from intercourse of reproductive potential. Abstinence is an acceptable 
method of contraception only when it is in line with the subject’s preferred and usual 
lifestyle.
Or
Consistent and correct use of 1 of the following methods of birth control listed below.
Intrauterine device (IUD) with a failure rate of <1% per year
Tubal sterilization
Essure micro-insert system (provided confirmation of success 3 months after procedure)
Vasectomy in the male partner (provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner and 
had confirmation of surgical success at least 3 months after procedure, with 
documentation of sperm-free ejaculate)
These above described methods are considered preferred methods of highly effective 
contraception in this protocol.
Female subjects who wish to use a hormonally based method must agree to use it in conjunction 
with a barrier method (used either by [CONTACT_347117]). Female subjects who utilize a hormonal contraceptive as one of their birth control methods must have consistently used the same method for at least three months prior to study dosing.
Filgotinib
Protocol GS-US-417-4048 Final
[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. Original
CONFIDENTIAL Page 66 19 December 2017Hormonally-based contraceptives and barrier methods permitted for use in this protocol are as 
follows:
Hormonal methods (subject must agree to use with a barrier method, preferably, with a male 
condom)
Oral contraceptives (either combined estrogen/progestin or progesterone only)
Injectable progesterone
subdermal contraceptive implant
Transdermal contraceptive patch
Contraceptive vaginal ring
Barrier methods (subject must agree to use with a hormonal method)
Male or female condom, with or without spermicide
Diaphragm with spermicide
Cervical cap with spermicide
Sponge with spermicide
All female subjects must also agree to refrain from egg donation and in vitro fertilization 
during study participation and for at least [ADDRESS_431324] study drug dose.
3) Contraception Requirements for Male Subjects
It is theoretically possible that a relevant systemic concentration may be achieved in a female 
partner from exposure to the male subject’s seminal fluid. Therefore, male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use condoms during study participation and for [ADDRESS_431325] 90 days after the end of dosing.
4) Unacceptable Birth Control Methods
Birth control methods that are unacceptable include periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, postovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method. A female condom and a male condom should not be used together.

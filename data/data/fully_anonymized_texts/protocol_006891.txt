Confidential Page 10of 74Study Design:
This study  was init iated as a double -blind, pl acebo -controlled study  with an open -label 
extensio n, and amended to enroll pat ients under only open -label treatm ent. Pri or to Amendment 
3, pati ents aged 6 years to < 17 y ears were rando mly assigned 1:1 to receive double -blind 
oxybut ynin chloride gel or placebo gel for 6 weeks, fo llowed by a n open -label, 8 -week peri od to 
generate safet y data. All patients began treatment with 0.75 g of gel/day for [ADDRESS_940325] been 
adjusted up to 1 g/day , down to 0.5 g/day , or rem ained the same at 0.75 g/day . The determinat ion 
of dose was based on the invest igator ’s clinical judgment and assessment of the patient ’s bladder 
symptoms and treatment side effects. Dose titration was permitted only once during the entire 
6-week double -blind, pl acebo -controlled period. Patients continued blinded treatment for 
4additional weeks unt il the end of the double -blind treatment period.
Post
-Amendment 3, the study dose -titration study  in pediatri c pat ients, ages 3 y ears to 
< 17 years, wi th detrusor overactivit y associ ated wi th a neuro logical condi tion. Efforts will be 
made to enroll a greater number of patients fro m the ages of 3 y ears to < [ADDRESS_940326] be using clean intermittent 
catheterizat ion (CIC) for bladder control. The study will include a screening period fro m Day -13 
to Day  -5 and a 14 -week open -label treatm ent period. The expected duration of the study  for 
each patient will be up to 16 weeks. No c hanges were made in the starting dose, compared to the 
Pre-Amendment 3 study  design, in that all pat ients will begin treatment with 0.75 g of gel/day  
for 2 weeks. Patients will then return to the clinic for a potential dose titration and at this time 
theirdose m ay be adjusted up to 1 g/day , down to 0.5 g/day , or rem ain the same at 0.75 g/day , 
depending on individual response and tolerabilit y. The determinat ion of dose will be based on the 
investigator ’s clinical judgment and assessment of the patient ’s bladder symptom s and treatm ent 
side ef fects. Dose titration will be permitted only once during the entire 14 -week treatm ent 
period. Pati ents will cont inue the adjusted dose for 12 addit ional weeks unt il the end of the 
open -label treatment period.
Safety will be eval uated by  [CONTACT_12902], physical examinat ions, vital signs, 
clinical laboratory  evaluat ions, skin eryt hema at the applicat ion site, and a visio n symptom  
questionnaire.
Study Population:
Pre-Amendment 3 included pediatric patients, from a ges 6 y ears to < [ADDRESS_940327] us an 8 -week open -label treatm ent phase of the study . Pos t‑Am endment 3 enrollment 
will include pediatric patients from ages 3 y ears to < [ADDRESS_940328] a di agnosis of detrusor 
overactivit y associated wi th a neuro logical condi tion and are using CIC to control bladder 
functi on, wi th an enrollment of a minimum o f 25 pati ents. These patients will be enrolled in a 
14-week open -label treatment phase (approximately 10 pat ients are expected to complete the 
14weeks).

9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
This study was initiated as a double- blind, placebo -controlle d study  with an open -label 
extension, and is now amended to continuing to enroll patients under only open -label 
treatment.
Pre-Amendment 3, patients ages 6 to >17 years, were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive double-
blind oxybutynin chloride gel or placebo gel for 6 weeks, followed by [CONTACT_3440] -label, 8- week 
period to generate safety data. All patients began treatment with 0.75 g of gel/day for [ADDRESS_940345] b een adjusted up to 1 g/day , down to 0.5 g/day , or remained the same at 0.75 g/day . 
The determination of dose was based on the investigator’ s clinical judgment and assessment of 
the patient ’s bladder symptoms and treatment side effects.
Dose titration was p ermitted only once during the entire 6- week double -blind, placebo -
controlled period. Patients continued blinded treatment for 4 additional weeks until the end of 
the double -blind treatment period. Pre -Amendment 3, visits were identified numerically 
(ie,Visit 1 through V isit 8/Early T ermination).
Post-Amendment 3, this study will continue as an open- label study for new patients enrolled 
under the present protocol (Amendment 3), with a similar patient population (ie, pediatric 
patients who have been diagnos ed with detrusor overactivity that is associated with a 
neurogenic condition) and will also enroll younger patients (minimum age of 3 years).
For patients enrolled under Post -Amendment 3, this will be a multicenter , open -label, dose -
titration study in pedi atric patients, ages 3 years to <[ADDRESS_940346] be using CIC for bladder control. No ch anges 
were made in the starting dose, compared to the Pre -Amendment 3 study design, in that all 
patients will begin treatment with 0.75 g of gel/day for 2 weeks. Patients will then return to the 
clinic for a potential dose titration and at this time their dose may be adjusted up to 1 g/day , 
down to 0.5 g/day , or remain the same at 0.75 g/day , depending on individual response and 
tolerability . The determination of dose will be based on the investigator ’s clinical judgment 
and assessment of the patient ’s blad der symptoms and treatment side effects. Dose titration 
will be permitted only once during the entire [ADDRESS_940347]- Amendmen t 3, visits will be identified alphabetically (ie, V isit A  through V isit F/ET) .
In the Post -Amendment 3 study design (open -label treatment only), the study will consist of a 
screening period from Day -13 to Day -5 and a 14 week open -label treatment period. The total 
study duration for each patient will be approximately 16 weeks.
The screening period will include 1clinic visit; Visit A(Screening V isit), where patients will be 
considered for inclusio n in the study . Following V isit A, all patients taking ant icholinergic 
medicat ions will be asked to discont inue treatment and complete a 3 -day washout period ( 11-day 
washout period if the patient was previously taking solifenacin ). In addit ion, patients will be

during the 6 -week double -blind treatment period, and all patients received oxybutynin chloride 
gel during the 8 -week open -label treatment period. Patients randomized to double- blind 
oxybutynin chloride gel started treatment at 0.75 g/day , and the dose may have been adjusted 
after 2 weeks of treatment to a higher or lower dose (0.5 g/day or 1 g/day) based on the 
investigator’s clinical judgment and assessment of bladder symptoms and treatment side 
effects. All patients who entered the open -label safety period were started on 0.75 g/day 
oxybutynin chloride gel, and the dose may have been adjusted after [ADDRESS_940361]-Amendment 3, no changes were made in the starting dose, compared to the

relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or di sease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product (ICH -E2A).
For the purpose of the site ’s data collection responsibilities, any untoward event that was 
reported from the patient sig
ned the informed consent form (ICF) until [ADDRESS_940379] known dose of study 
treatment is to be considered an AE.
Examples of AEs are as follows:
Changes in the general c ondition of the patient
Subjective symptoms offered by [CONTACT_44742]
Objective signs observed by [CONTACT_248975]
All diseases that occur after signing informed consent, including any change in 
severity or frequency of pre -existing disease
All clinically relevant abnormalities in laboratory values or clinically relevant physical 
findings that occur during the study schedule
Please note that medical procedures scheduled prior to consenting, but occurring duri ng the 
study should not be captured as AEs, but should be listed in the medical history if related to a 
pre-existing condition.
[IP_ADDRESS] Causality Assessment
For each AE, the investigator must provide an assessment of causal relationship to the study 
treatment. The causality assessment must be recorded on the eCRF . Causal relationship must 
be assessed by [CONTACT_16134]:
Is there a reasonable possibility the study treatment caused the event?
Yes: There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship be tween the study treatment and AE, ie:
There is a reasonable temporal relationship between the study treatment and the event,

Positive dechallenge and/or rechallenge exist
No: There is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study treatment and AE, 
ie:
There is no reasonable temporal relationship between the study treatment and the 
event, or
The patient did not ta ke the study treatment, or
The event is likely to be attributed to underlying/concurrent disease, other study 
treatments, or other factors, or
The event is commonly occurring in the (study) population independent of study 
treatment exposure
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity Asses sment
The investigator will provide an assessment of the severity of each AE by [CONTACT_44745] a severity 
rating on the appropriate page of the patient ’s eCRF . Severity , which is a description of the 
intensity of manifestation of the AE, is distinct from seriousness, which implies a patient 
outcome or AE -required treatment measure associated with a threat to life or functionality . 
Severity will be assessed according to the following scale:
Mild: A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only m inimal treatment 
or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual 
activities of daily living.
Moderate: A type of AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing 
discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research 
participant.
Severe: A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly 
affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Event
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
Results in death
Is life threatening

Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based on appropriate medical judgment, th ey 
may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of 
study treatment dependency or drug abuse.
Emergency room visits that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_693454] s outcomes to determine whether they qualify as SAEs.
Preplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (eg, elective procedures for pre -existing conditions that did not
worsen, such as cosmetic surgery and hysterectomy) are excluded from SAE reporting.
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
At each visit, patients are to be queried regarding any AEs or SAEs that have occurred since 
the previous visit. Patients will be asked to volunteer information with a nonleading question 
such as, “How do you feel since your las t visit? ” Study site personnel will record all pertinent 
information in the patient ’s eCRF .
All AEs must be recorded on the appropriate AE reporting page of the patient ’s eCRF whether 
or not they are considered causally related to the study treatment.
For every AE, the investigator must:
Provide an assessment of the seriousness of the event (ie, is it an SAE?), as well as the 
severity and causal relationship
Document all actions taken with regard to the study treatment
Detail any other treatment measures ta ken for the AE
Document the outcome of the AE
In addition, patients are to be reminded, as described in the ICF and in accordance with 
Section 9.7.[ADDRESS_940380] -study

recorded in original source documents. AEs are also to be recorded in the eCRF if at least one
of the following conditions is met: 1) the event meets the criteria for an SAE (see 
Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS] ), and/or 2) the event is judged by [CONTACT_693465].
Any AEs that are ongoing at the time of the final protocol -defined study visit will be followed

Study: OG09002 Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_940391] ATISTICAL METHODS
11.1 Determination of Sample Size
Sample size was calculated for the protocol as originally designed (Pre -Amendment 3: double -
blind, placebo- controlled treatm ent period followed by [CONTACT_3440]- label extension) as follows:
This study  was planned to include a minimum o f 96 pedi atric patients aged 6 to <[ADDRESS_940392] a diagnosis o f detrusor overactivit y associ ated wi th a neurol ogical condi tion. The sample 
size was selected to provide an adequate number of patients to eval uate the safet y and efficacy of 
oxybutynin chloride geltreatment in a pediatric populat ion. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 
fashio n to oxybutynin chloride gelor placebo wi thin each stratificat ion level, which were based 
on age, weight, and gender . Estimates for the average change fro m baseline (CFB) in the 
percentage of catheterizations without a leaking accident as well as the standard deviat ion for 
this variable were taken f rom oxybut ynin TDS in Study O03010. Assuming a co mmo n standard 
deviat ion of 28 for the CFB in the percentage of catheterizat ions wit hout a l eaking accident, a 
difference between treatment groups of 20 (assuming average for oxybutynin chloride gel= 25 
and average for placebo = 5), and n = 48 patients per treatment group, and then there is 93% 
power to detect a statist ically significant difference between treatment groups. Based on 
discontinuat ion rates fro m Study  O03010, if we assume a 10% dropout rate then there is 90% 
power to detect a statist ically significant difference between treatment groups.
The open -label study (patients enrolled Post -Amendment 3) will include a minimum of 
25pediatric patients aged 3 to < 17 years (efforts will be made to enroll a greater number of 
patients aged 3 years to < 6 years) who have a diagnosis of detrusor overactivity associated 
with a neurological condition. This sample size is expected to provide a minimum of 
10patients with 14 weeks of exposure.
11.2 Analysis Populations a nd Databases

Observed cases (OC)
Last observat ion carri ed forward (LOCF)
The OC visit s are defined to be those assessment values observed at each scheduled visit. All 
applicable efficac y and safety  variables will be summarized using the OC visits.
The LOCF visit is defined as the last data recorded for each efficacy variable. This visit will be 
designated as Week 6 (LOCF). The W eek 6 (LOCF) visit will be defined for the 
Post- Amendment 3 open -label period and the Pre -Amendment 3 double -blind period and will 
only be used to summarize efficacy data. The LOCF visit provides missing value imputation for 
patients who do not complete the open -label treatment period (Post -Amendment 3) or the 
double -blind treatment period (Pre -Amendment 3) of the study  and will include all patients in 
the corresponding ITT population.
11.[ADDRESS_940394] -Amendment 3 open -label period and the Pre -
Amendment 3 double -blind period will be the percentage of catheterizat ions without a leaking 
accident (continuous variable).
The fo llowing are secondary cont inuous efficacy variables that will be calculated:
Average vo lume of urine co llected per catheterization (f or Pre -Amendmen t 3 population 
only)
Average vo lume of urine co llected at first (morning awakening) catheterization 
Average number of catheterizat ions per day
The primary  efficacy endpo int for the Post -Amendment 3 open -label period and the 
Pre-Amendment 3 double -blind period is defined as the CFB to W eek 6 (LOCF) in the 
percentage of catheterizations without a leaking accident. The secondary efficacy endpo ints are 
defined as the CFB in the secondary  efficacy variables at W eek 6 (LOCF).
Baseline is V isit [ADDRESS_940395] -Amendment 3.
11.4 Descriptive Summaries of Efficacy Parameters
Absolute values and CFB values for all the cont inuous efficacy parameters will be summarized

11.5 Statistical Analyses of Efficacy Parameters
All analyses will be cond ucted wi th SAS®v9.3or higher using procedures appropriate for the 
particular analysis.
11.5.1 Statistical Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint
The primary  efficacy parameter is the CFB to W eek 6 (or LOCF) in the percentage of 
catheterizations without a lea king accident. The primary efficacy parameter will be analyzed 
using an analysis o f covari ance (ANCOV A) m odel wi th the baseline measure of the primary  
variable as the covariate and treatment group and study part (Pre -Amendment [ADDRESS_940396]- Amendment 3) as fa ctors .
To assess the effect of the study design, the primary efficacy parameter will be analyzed using 
a random effects mixed model using the combined data from the Pre -Amendment [ADDRESS_940397]- Amendment 3 open -label treatment period. 
The model will include the baseline measure and other baseline characteristics as covariates 
and treatment (Pre -Amendment [ADDRESS_940398] -Amendment 3 open- label oxybu tynin chloride gel) as factors and 
will account for the heterogeneity between parts of the study (Pre -Amendment [ADDRESS_940399]- Amendment 3) by [CONTACT_2329] a random effect for study part. If the analyses indicate 
heterogeneity , the data from the Pre -Amendment [ADDRESS_940400] -Amendment 3 ITT population, the analyses of the secondary efficacy parameters 
will assess the CFB for each variable at Week 6 (LOCF). The significance of the change from 
baseline on the secondary effica cy measures will be assessed from 2 -sided, 1 -sample t -tests. 
For the Pre -Amendment 3 ITT population, secondary  efficacy parameters will be analyzed 
using ANCOV A models wi th the baseline m easure of the efficacy  variable as the covariate and 
treatm ent group asfactor .
11.5.3 Additional Analyses
The primary  and secondary  efficacy  endpoints will be analyzed at Week 6 LOCF) for each of

Bathing or showering should not occur sooner than 1 hour after gel applicat ion.
If bathing before applicat ion, the area must be dried completely before gel applicat ion.
Tear open the pouch at the indentation and express the complete contents either into your 
hand or di rectly on the abdo men, upper arm/shoulder, or thigh application area (see 
diagram  on following page).
Gent ly spread the gel on the applicat ion area in a continuous line coveri ng as much of the 
applicat ion area as possible. It should be spread as uniformly and thinly as possible over 
the ent ire applicat ion area taking care not to transfer any  material to any  clothing. Care 
shoul d also be taken not to apply gel to the area in or immediately around the naval 
during the abdo minal applicat ions.

Visual acuity -LEA  symbols
Visual acuity is screened at a distance of 10 feet using the Lea symbols.
The child need not know these symbols, but must be able to match the indicated 
symbols on a wall chart with those on the response card.
Equipment
10' Lea V ision Ch art Student Response Card Flashcards
Table and chair
Occluder with lip
Facilities
Room approximately 15 feet long or greater , well –lit and without glare.
Procedure
Testing the right eye:
1.
The child must be standing or sitting at a table with the response card in front, eyes at 
a 10-foot distance from the chart.
2. The child must be conditioned to match symbols by [CONTACT_693484] a flash card or pointed to on the chart.
3. Begin screening with one per son holding an occluder over the child's left eye.
4. Another person points to the symbols on the Lea wall chart using caution not to cover 
the rectangle line with their finger or pointer .
5. The child should point to the corresponding symbol on the response card.
6.
Start with the top line and continue downward showing one letter per line. If the child 
reaches the bottom line, show the remaining three symbols.
7. If the child misses, go to the line above and show four different symbols in that line. If 
thechild matches them correctly, proceed downward.
8. To receive credit for a line, the child must correctly match each of the four different 
symbols on the line.
9. The number recorded as the visual acuity is the smallest line the child can read 
correctly .
Testing the left eye
Cover the right eye and repeat the procedure
Age five P ASS
10/15 or better in each eye without a 2 -line difference.
Re-screen/REFER
10/20 or worse in either eye or a 2- line difference in the pass range
Age three to four P ASS
10/20 or b etter in each eye without a 2 -line difference
Re-screen/REFER
10/25 or worse in either eye or a 2- line difference in the pass range.

Confidential Page 74of 74Considerations for screening special populations:
The matching of the Lea symbols may be practiced before the screening
For some children with special needs it may be useful to reproduce the response card, 
cut and space them so that larger movements can be used when indicating the 
matching symbol.
NOTE: At recheck, the poorer eye should be screened first. Children unable to perform the 
Lea chart should be given the procedures designed for younger children. Occluders should be 
cleaned between children.
Reminders:
The detection of vision disorders and symptoms during the study will be tracked by [CONTACT_693485]. The severity of the event and the relationship to the 
study drug will be assessed by [CONTACT_693486].
Any patients with asymmetric/unequal or severe refractive error will be excluded from 
the study since afor ementioned conditions can result in refractive amblyopia and may 
confound the study outcomes.

VERSION 2.0: 01/13/[ADDRESS_64432] shown that inflammation plays an important role in the 
pathogenesis of Dry Eye Disease (DED).  Ocular surface inflammation often 
exacerbates the subject’s signs and symptoms, and results in an increase in the 
immune cells and other infl ammatory mediators located in the ocular surface. Dry 
eye disease is one of the most commonly encountered ophthalmic disorders. It is a 
multifactorial disease of the ocular surface and tear film, characterized by [CONTACT_59263], tear instabilit y and vision impairment. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_59245], 
standardized therapy is not available.  
Due to the underlying inflammation associated with DED, anti -inflammatory steroid 
medications are used for the treatment of DED. “Soft steroids” are often preferred  
because their chance of increasing intraocular pressure (IOP) is lower than other 
steroids. One of the “soft steroids” that is commonly used for the treatment of 
inflammation associated with ocular surface disease is loteprednol etabonate 0.5% 
ophthalmic suspension (Lotemax, Bausch & Lomb, Inc).  
Current steroid therapy in DED is comprised of pulse therapy (to avoid adverse 
events associated with long -term steroid use) of usually [ADDRESS_64433] 6 
weeks with tapered dosing has been advocated.  
1.2 Rationale  
Lotemax, an FDA -approved medication for ocular inflammatory disease, is commonly 
used to treat inflammation associated with DED with a regimen of twice daily for 2 
MEEI and Tufts Medical Center    
 
 
 
VERSION 2.0: 01/13/[ADDRESS_64434] 6 weeks with tapered dosing. This study has been designed to evaluate the 
effects of this tapering regimen on inflammation associated with DED.  
Clinical signs and symptoms are used  to evaluate the efficacy of a treatment for DED, 
including Schirmer’s test, tear break -up test, corneal fluorescein staining, and 
conjunctival lissamine green staining. However, none of these tests evaluate the 
underlying inflammatory and immune response chang es in DED. Therefore, to 
determine the efficacy of any treatment for DED, it is ideal to evaluate these 
underlying changes in addition to the clinical parameters.  
In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) is a novel imaging technology that allows the 
visualizati on and quantification of corneal structures at the cellular level. IVCM has 
recently been used to evaluate the corneal changes in DED, such as hyperfluorescent 
superficial epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], immune dendritic cells, and sub-basal nerves.  
Therefore, in this randomized clinical trial, IVCM images will be used to determine the 
changes in corneal immune cells and nerves during a 6 -week taper regimen of 
Lotemax versus Soothe Tired  Eyes Lubricant  Eye Drop ( Glycerin 1.0%, Bausch & Lomb 
Inc.) (an artificial tear)  for treatment of inflammation associated with DED.

3. STUDY DESIGN  
 
3.1 Study Design Description  
This is a single site, prospective, randomized, controlled, double -masked clinical trial 
including 50 subjects with DED. The participants will be randomized to take either 
Lotemax or Soo the Tired Eyes Lubricant Eye Drops for 6 weeks. Both Lotemax and the 
artificial tear will be used 4 times a day for 2 weeks, 2 times a day for 2 weeks, and 
once a day for 2 weeks. After screening/baseline examination and enrolling into the 
study, the parti cipants will have follow -up visits at [ADDRESS_64435] will be randomized to take either Lotemax or Sooth e 
Tired Eyes Lubricant Eye Drops (artificial tear s). The randomizatio n will be in a 1:1 
ratio using a permuted -block design (which will be obtained using a computer -based 
random code generator) into the two groups.  
 
3.2.2 Masking Procedures

participants’ name, unique identifier, and the coded treatment assignment. The 
randomization sc heme and treatment assignment will be held in the pharmacy to 
ensure that the investigator and study team remain masked. Participants, 
investigators, image analysts , and the sponsor ([COMPANY_004]) will be masked to the treatment 
group.  
 
3.2.[ADDRESS_64437]’s medication may be unmasked at any point for a medical emergency or to 
supplement a serious adverse event (SAE) report. The subjects will be unmasked at 
the end of the study in order to provide optimal ongoing care.

5. STUDY DRUG(S)/DEV ICE(S)  
 
5.1 Study Drug/Device Information  
The participants will receive either Lotemax or Sooth e Tired Eye Drop.  
 
Lotemax  
Lotemax (loteprednol etabonate) 0.5% is a prescription -only, preserved ophthalmic 
suspension supplied by [CONTACT_59268] & Lomb, Inc. Lotemax (loteprednol etabonate) 0.5% 
has been approved by [CONTACT_59269] w ith a maximum 
dosing frequency of [ADDRESS_64440] on intraocular 
pressure (IOP) compared to other corticosteroids, which may increase IOP.  Th e 
medication will be applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_59249] 6 weeks with the following 
regimen: four times a day for 2 weeks, twice daily for 2 weeks, and once daily for 2 
weeks.  
 
Soothe Tired Eyes Lubricant Eye Drop  
Soothe Tired Eyes Lubricant Eye Drop (Bausc h & Lomb Inc.) is a preserved artificial 
tear which is used to relieve the dryness of the eye and to prevent further irritation . 
Its active ingredient is glycerin 1%.  The artificial tear will be applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_59250] 6 weeks with the following regimen: four times a day for 2 weeks, twice daily 
for 2 weeks, and once daily for 2 weeks . 
  
In the case of increased intraocular pressure due to Lotemax, the medication will be 
tapered rapi[INVESTIGATOR_59251] 1 week. In addition, for cases  where subje cts 
withdraw from the study, the medication will be tapered and stopped within 1 week.  
 
MEEI and Tufts Medical Center    
 
 
 
VERSION 2.0: 01/13/2017   Page 16 of 51 5.2 Study Drug/Device Compliance/Adherence  
Directed questioning using the (Ocular Tolerability and Compliance Questionnaire – 
Appendix I) will be administerd by [CONTACT_59270]. Results on the 
participants’ compliance and adherence to the study protocol and study drug will be 
recorded on the  paper  case report form ( CRF) at the second and third visits (2 and 6 
weeks after enrollment).  
 
Subjects will no t be withdrawn for lack of compliance with the study drug regimen.  
 
During the study, all concomitant medication treatment regimens, ocular hygiene 
treatments (i.e., lid scrubs and warm compresses), or insertion of punctal plugs will 
be kept constant as p ermitted by [CONTACT_59271]. If one of the 
aforementioned treatment regimens needs to be modified, the participant may be 
withdrawn based on the investigator’s discretion.  
 
Additionally, if there is an administration of a prohibited medication (i ncluding any 
other steroid) or procedure (any ocular surgery), the participant may be withdrawn 
based on the investigator’s discretion.  
 
Participants must be compliant with IVCM imaging on at least 2 of their 3 visits or 
they will be withdrawn. Subjects wh o are withdrawn may be replaced by [CONTACT_59272].  
 
5.3 Study Drug Supplies  
Both Lotemax and Soothe Tired Eyes Lubricant Eye Drop are commercially available 
from Bausch & Lomb Inc as eye drops.  
MEEI and Tufts Medical Center    
 
 
 
VERSION 2.0: 01/13/2017   Page 17 of 51  Preparing and  Dispensing  
To mask the identity of the medication, the Mass achusetts  Eye and Ear 
Pharmacy will prepare, label and distribute both Lotemax and Soothe Tired Eyes 
Lubricant Eye Drop to the study participants.  
 
 Administration  
Regardless of study drug assignme nt, each participant will self -administer one 
drop of the study medication to both eyes with the following regimen: 4 times a 
day for 2 weeks, 2 times a day for 2 weeks, and once daily for 2 weeks. The 
participants are being advised not to allow the droppe r tip to touch any 
surface, as this may contaminate the medication.  
 
Participants will be instructed on how to instill an eye drop at the baseline visit 
and will be asked to demonstrate application of an eye drop in front of 
research personnel to confirm that the  appropriate technique is being used.  
 
5.4 Study Drug/Device Storage and Accountability  
The subjects will be instructed to store the medication at room temperature (15 -25ºC 
/ 59-77ºF) and to shake it vigorously before using it. If a subject contra cts infectious 
conjunctivitis, they will be instructed to discard the remainder of the study drug . The 
subject will be scheduled for a clinic visit where an investigator will assess the 
severity of the infectious conjunctivitis as well as the subject’s eli gibility. If the 
investigator determines that the subject is still eligible, a new study drug will be sent 
from the host site pharmacy, [LOCATION_005] Eye and Ear Infirmary , and given to the 
subject during their visit . 
 
The participants will not be asked to  return the unused drug following the completion 
of the study. Additionally, subjects who are withdrawn from the study will be asked 
MEEI and Tufts Medical Center    
 
 
 
VERSION 2.0: 01/13/[ADDRESS_64441] of their unused study drug. Therefore, the study drug will not be 
accounted for following dispensing an d will not be destroyed by [CONTACT_59273].   
 
5.5 Other Medications  
 Administration  
The use of any concurrent, prescription, or over -the-counter  medication, is to 
be recorded along with the reason the medication was taken. During the study, 
all concomitan t medication treatment regimens, ocular hygiene treatments (i.e., 
lid scrubs and warm compresses), or insertion of punctal plugs will be kept as 
constant as permitted by [CONTACT_59271].  
 
Using artificial tears (preserved and non -preserved) are p ermissible at the 
screening visits and during the study. However, concomitant use of artificial 
tears will be monitored. At each study visit, subjects will be queried about the 
average number of times they used artificial tears each day during the past 
week and the number of days during the past week when they did not use any 
artificial tears.  
 
Systemic and topi[INVESTIGATOR_20718] , that the subjects are already 
taking as part of their current treatment for dry eye disease will be maintained, 
without a change in frequency.  
 
When necessary, treatment and administration of any other therapy, besides 
their current and study’s  regimen , will be done as the safety of the study 
participant is the primary consideration. The administration of a prohibited 
medi cation or procedure will be considered a protocol violation and the subject 
may be discontinued from the study. Prohibited medications include other 
ophthalmic steroids. Prohibited procedures include any ocular surgery.  
MEEI and Tufts Medical Center    
 
 
 
VERSION 2.0: 01/13/2017   Page 19 of 51  Rescue Medication or Therapy  
When ne cessary, administration of any other therapy besides the study 
medication and their current medications will occur for the safety of the 
subject, which is the primary concern. If treatment with artificial tears is 
inadequate, or if the subject develops a s evere form of ocular surface disease 
and dry eye, the subject may be unmasked by [CONTACT_093]. To ensure the 
subject’s safety and proper treatment, unmasking of the study treatment 
assignment will allow the investigator to institute appropriate follow -up care. 
The subject will be kept in the study so that we can do an “intention to treat” 
analysis .

7. STUDY PROCEDURES  
 
7.1 Screening Procedures  
Prospective participants, as defined by [CONTACT_26141]/exclusion criteria, will be 
considered for entry into this study. Concur rent enrollment of subjects who are 
participants in other studies will be allowed based on the investigator ’s discretion.  
 
During the consent process, study design and treatment regimen will be discussed 
with each subject. Written informed consent will be obtained before any study 
specific procedures are performed. However, standard of care clinical information 
(such as: medical history, TBUT, staining, and Schirmer’s test) obtained during a 
subject’s clinical visit within the previous [ADDRESS_64442]’s screening visit 
may be used to determine eligibility and as a baseline assess ment.  
The following evaluations and procedures will be performed for all subjects during 
the screening and baseline period:  
• Written informed consent  
• Record of current ocular and systemic medications  
• Record of significant medical/surgical history i n the past 5 years  
• Record of demographic data, including date of birth, sex, and race/ethnicity  
• Tear Break -up Time (TBUT)  
• Eye examination (best corrected visual acuity, slit lamp biomicroscopy, 
applanation tonometry, funduscopy)  
• Corneal fluorescei n staining  
• Conjunctival lissamine green staining  
MEEI and Tufts Medical Center    
 
 
 
VERSION 2.0: 01/13/2017   Page 22 of 51 • Schirmer’s test with anesthesia  
• Central corneal in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM)  
 
Researchers will document type and frequency of artificial tear, ocular ointment, and 
other dry eye therapi[INVESTIGATOR_59252].  
 
Subjects will start the study medication the first day after their screening visit, while 
continuing the use of their current medications.  
 
Tear Break -Up Time (TBUT) : The standard TBUT measurement will be performed by 
[CONTACT_59274][INVESTIGATOR_31081] a fluoresce in drop to the inferior tarsal conjunctiva. After several blinks, 
the tear film will be examined using a broad beam of the slit lamp with a blue filter. 
The time lapse between the last blink and the appearance of the first randomly 
distributed dark discont inuity in the fluorescein stained tear film will be measured 
three times and the mean value of the measurements will be calculated. The tear 
break -up time will be evaluated prior to the instillation of any eye drops and before 
the eyelids are manipulated i n any way. Break -up times less than 10 seconds are 
considered abnormal. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.  
 
Corneal Fluorescein Staining  (Appendix IV): Corneal fluorescein staining will be 
performed after 3 minutes of application of a f luorescein drop. The entire cornea will 
be then examined using slit -lamp evaluation with cobalt blue illumination. Staining 
will be graded using the NEI grading scheme, with a total range of 0-15.  
 
 
 
      
 
Schirmer’s Test with Anesthesia : The Schirmer’s test will be performed 3 minutes 
after a drop of topi[INVESTIGATOR_59253] 0.5% proparacaine (Alcon Inc., Ft Worth TX) is 
MEEI and Tufts Medical Center    
 
 
 
VERSION 2.0: 01/13/[ADDRESS_64443] is performed by [CONTACT_1299] a narrow filter -paper 
strip (5 x 35 mm strip of Whatman #41 filter paper) in the inferior cul -de-sac. This 
test is to be conducted in a dimly lit room. The subject should gently close their eyes 
until five minutes have elapsed and the strips are removed. Since the tear front will 
continue advancing a few millimeters after it has  been removed from the eyes, it is 
important to mark the tear front with a ball -point pen at precisely five minutes. 
Aqueous tear production will be measured by [CONTACT_59275] 5 minutes.  
 
Conjunctival Lissamine Green S taining  (Appendix IV): Grading of conjunctival 
lissamine green staining will be performed after 2 minutes of application of a 
lissamine green drop. The nasal and temporal conjunctiva will be examined using slit -
lamp evaluation with white light. Staining wi ll be graded using the NEI grading 
scheme, with a total range of 0-18.  
 
In Vivo  Confocal Microscopy (IVCM):   
In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) is a new imaging method which allows 
visualization of the corneal structures at the cellular level. With a magn ification of 
[ADDRESS_64444] and quantify changes in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_59254] -basal nerve plexus. With this technology, size and reflectivity of superficial 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], as well as the number of immune dendritic cells (D C) can be readily 
evaluated.    
This is a contact [CONTACT_59276] a drop of topi[INVESTIGATOR_59255]. A topi[INVESTIGATOR_59256]’s

locations in the central part of the cornea will be imaged at the depth of the 
superficial epi[INVESTIGATOR_59257] -basal layer which is 50 to 80 microns deep. A sequence 
of 100 images will be obtained.

the baseline assessments, subjects will be randomized into a treatment group.  If an 
individual is deemed eligible to participate, the following baseline procedures w ill be 
performed:  
 
 Symptom Assessment iN Dry Eye (SANDE) questionnaire:  
SANDE Questionnaire (Appendix III): The Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye 
(SANDE) questionnaire utilizes a 100 -mm horizontal visual analog scale (a 100 -
mm line) to quantify subject symptom s of ocular dryness and/or irritation. In 
the SANDE symptom questionnaire -I, subjects will be asked to put a mark on 
two given lines to depi[INVESTIGATOR_59258]. At the screening visit and al l follow -up visits, 
the SANDE symptom questionnaire -I will be administered. At each follow -up 
visit, the SANDE symptom questionnaire -II will be also administered. To 
indicate whether there are any differences in symptoms from the previous visit, 
subjects w ill compare the frequency and severity of their current level of 
symptoms with the level at their previous visit by [CONTACT_1299] a mark to the left of 
central anchor (if less than previous visit) or to the right of central anchor (if 
more than the previous visi t), according to how much of a change they perceive. 
The location of the mark made by [CONTACT_59277] -I 
will be measured in mm from the left -hand side of the [ADDRESS_64445] and the central 
anchor will be measured and it will be recorded as a negative value if to the left 
of the central anchor and as a positive value if placed to the right of the central 
anchor. Then a global score will be calculated by [CONTACT_59278].

 Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionna ire: 
OSDI Questionnaire (Appendix II): [ADDRESS_64446] on vision -related functioning. The 12 items of the 
OSDI questionnaire are graded on a scale of 0 to 4, where 0 indicates none of 
the time; 1, some of the time; 2, half of the time; 3, most of the time; and 4, all 
of the time. The total OSDI score is then calculated on the basis of the following 
formula: OSDI=[(sum of scores for all questions answered) x 100]/[(total 
number of questions answered) x 4].

VERSION 2.0: 01/13/[ADDRESS_64450] a general, non -directed question 
such as “How have you been feeling since the last visi t?” or “How have your eyes been 
since the last visit?”  
The investigator will ask questions to subjects at each visit to determine if they have 
had any changes to the use of concomitant medications since the previous visit.  A 
comprehensive eye examination including best -corrected visual acuity, measuring 
intraocular pressure, evaluation of the condition of conjunctiva, cornea, anterior 
chamber, iris/pupil, lens, vitreous, macula and optic nerve will be performed. Any 
changes in the study eyes from the scree ning visit will be recorded. If a subject 
contracts infectious conjunctivitis, they will be instructed to discard the remainder of 
the study drug and new drug will be sent from the host site pharmacy, [LOCATION_005] 
Eye and Ear Infirmary.  
If treatment with artificial tears is inadequate, or the subject develops severe form of 
ocular surface disease and dry eye, for the safety and proper treatment of the subject, 
the investigator can unmask the subject's treatment assignment to determine which

Withdrawal from the study will happen if any of the following occurs:  
 Investigator determination that it is not in the best interest of the subject to  
continue participation.          
 Subject’s wish  to withdraw  for any reason.  
After being withdrawn, subjects will be followed according to each case until the 
adverse event is resolved.

9. ADVERSE EVENT REC ORDING AND REPORTING  
 
9.1 Recording Requirements  
Research subjects will be routinely questioned about adverse events at study visits. 
All observed or volunteered adverse events (serious or non -serious) and abnormal test 
findings, regardless of study group or suspected causal relationship to the study 
drug(s) or device(s) will be recorded in the subjects’ case histories (source data, case 
report form).  For all adverse events, sufficient information will be pursued and/or 
obtained so as to permit 1) an adequate determination of the outcome of the event 
(i.e., whether the event should be classified as a serious adverse event) and; 2)  an 
assessm ent of the causal  relationship between the adverse event and the study 
drug(s) or device(s).    
Adverse events or abnormal test findings thought to be associated with the study 
drug(s) or device(s) will be followed until the event (or its sequel) or the ab normal test 
finding resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the Investigator.  
An abnormal test finding will be classified as an adverse event if one or more of the 
following criteria are met:  
o The test finding is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]  
o The test finding necessitates additional diagnostic evaluation(s) or 
medical/surgical intervention; including significant additional 
concomitant drug treatment or other therapy  
o The test finding leads to a change in study drug dosing or 
discontinuation of sub ject participation in the clinical research study  
o The test finding is considered an adverse event by [CONTACT_737].  
Note: simply repeating a test finding, in the absence of any of the 
other listed criteria, does not constitute an adverse event.   
MEEI and Tufts Medical Center    
 
 
 
VERSION 2.0: 01/13/[ADDRESS_64452] 
findings to determine 1) if the abnormal test finding should be classified as an 
adverse event; 2) if there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event was caused 
by [CONTACT_59279](s); and 3) if the adverse event meets the criteria for a serious 
adverse event.  
If the Investigator’s final determination of causality is “unknown and of questionable 
relationship to the study drug(s)”, the adverse event will be classified as asso ciated 
with the use of the study drug(s) for reporting purposes.  If the Investigator’s final 
determination of causality is “unknown but not related to the study drug(s)”, this 
determination and the rationale for the determination will be documented in the  
respective subject’s case history (source data or case report form).  
9.2 REPORTING PROCEDURES  
 REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS TO FDA  
 If an investigator determines that a serious adverse event (SAE)  is related to 
one of the study medications the SAE will be reported to the FDA.  
  Reporting Adverse Events to Other External Entities  
The sponsor ([COMPANY_004]) does not require reports on adverse events. Therefore no 
reports on adverse events will be submitted to external entities.  
Reporting Adverse Events to the Human Stu dies Committee  
MEEI  HSC policy for “REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS AND UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS ” 
will be followed.  
 
9.3 Withdrawal of Subjects due to Adverse Events  
Withdrawal from the study will happen if any of the following occurs:  
 Investigator determines that is not in the best interest of the subject to 
continue participation.  
 Subject’s wish to withdraw for any reason.

VERSION 2.0: 01/13/2017   Page 36 of 51 10.3 Sample Size Determination  
To calculate sample size, density of sub -basal dendritic cells in the central cornea was 
used as an outcome measure. Based on a previous publ ished paper (Villani et al, 
Innate Immunity. 2013;19(4) 420 –427), a difference of 52 cell/mm2 with a standard 
deviation of 44 were used to calculate the sample size with the following formula:1-3 
 
 
With α = 0.05 (Z α = 1.96), d = 52, and p = 44, a sample s ize of 22 was calculated for 
each group (44 for both groups). To compensate for potential loss to follow -up, a 
total of 50 subjects will be enrolled in this study.

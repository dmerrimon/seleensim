participants, as outlined in the SoA. All
urine samples will be collected and 
prepared as detailed in the central 
laboratory manual :
Part of the collected sample will be 
shipped to the central laboratory for 
urinalysis (that includes, but is not 
limited to, testing for blood and 
urinary crystals). 
The second part of the collected 
sample will be immediately prepared 
using a specialized filter for gefapi[INVESTIGATOR_641903]. The filtered 
sample will be stored at the study site 
until the urinalysis results from the 
central laboratory are received.To remove procedures/assessments for specialized

Section # and Name [CONTACT_642026] , If results indicate a 
participant has unexplained hematuria 
and/or urinary crystals are identified and 
deemed to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_1275], the participant should be 
considered for further evaluation. the 
filtered sample stored at the site will b e 
immediately shipped to the Sponsor or 
designee and assessed for the presence of 
gefapi[INVESTIGATOR_641904]. Raman spectroscopy is 
sensitive to the chemical structure of the 
molecule and gefapi[INVESTIGATOR_641905] a unique 
chemical structure c ompared with common 
urinary crystals. If there is an explanation 
for hematuria (for example, recent menses, 
urinary tract infection, or a recent 
procedure/instrumentation that would 
explain the hematuria) the sample will not 
be sent to the Sponsor or desig nee. See 
central laboratory manual for further 
procedural details.
If a participant has confirmed gefapi[INVESTIGATOR_641906], the Sponsor will inform 
the investigator and recommend follow up
with the participant at approximately 2
week intervals; addition al specialized 
urine crystal analyses should be performed

gefapi[INVESTIGATOR_641908], it will be known that 
the participant was receiving gefapi[INVESTIGATOR_462717] 
(formal unblinding should no t be 
performed [see Section 8.1.11]).
If an investigator deems it necessary to 
perform an unscheduled urinalysis at any 
time during the study (after 
randomization), the same procedures for 
collection/preparation of the urine sample 
and evaluation of hematu ria (as explained 
or unexplained) described for Visit 6 or 
Discontinuation Visit should be performed.
The sample will be analyzed for the 
presence of gefapi[INVESTIGATOR_641909].

Participants Continuing to be 
Monitored in the StudyUpdated text (new text in bold font):
If a participant is discontinued from the 
study intervention early:
the Discontinuation Visit should be 
performed as soon as possible ;
If feasible, participants should be 
instructed to complete the 
Incontinence Diary and other 
PROs during the 7 days prior to 
the Discontinuation Visit.
Procedures, including e -Diary 
assessments, should be performed 
as outlined for the 
Discontinuation Visit in the SoA 
(Section 1.3) .
Note: If a participant discontinues 
at a regularly scheduled study 
visit, the procedures outlined for 
the Discontinuation Visit in the 
SoA should be followed in place of 
the procedures for the regularly 
scheduled study visit. To clarify the procedures th at should be performed if a

Participants Continuing to be 
Monitored in the StudyUpdated text (new text in bold font):
Study site visits should continue to 
be performed at timepoints that 
correspond to each remaining 
study visit. These visits will allow 
collection of follow -up information, 
limited to:
-AEs;
-Concomitant medication 
use; and 
-e-Diary assessments, as 
outlined in the SoA (Section 
1.3);
Note: If the participant discontinues 
study intervention at a regularly 
scheduled study visit but remains in the 
study, the Discontinuation Visit should be 
performed, and the regularly scheduled 
study visits should resume thereafter. For 
example: If a participant discontinues 
study intervention at the time of Visit 4, 
procedures for the Discontinuation Visit 
should be performed at that time. The 
next expected study visit would be Visit 5, 
followed by [CONTACT_4838] 6.To clarify the procedures that should be performed if a

2 INTRODUCTION
Chronic cough, defined as cough lasting >[ADDRESS_859339] frequent concerns prompting patients to seek a physician consultation. The 
overall global prevalence of chronic cough is approximately 10% [Song, W. J., et al 2015] . 
For approximately two -thirds of these patients, a potential co- morbid condition can be 
identified, and the cough effectively managed by [CONTACT_641993]. 
Patients who have been diagnosed with conditions that are suspected to cause chronic cough 
(ie, asthma, GERD, UACS, or non eosinophilic bronchitis [Irwin, R. S., et al 2018] ) but 
whose cough does not resol ve with the appropriate treatment of those conditions are 
considered to have refractory chronic cough [McCrory, D. C., et al 2013] . Patients with 
chronic cough in whom an underlying etiology cannot be identified despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a thorough 
diagnostic work -up are considered to have unexplained chronic cough [McCrory, D. C., et al 
2013] .
Chronic cough, particularly when refractory or unexplained, is associated with physical, 
psychological ,and social morbidity ,and a substantial quality of life decrement [French, C. 
L., et al 1998] [Young, E. C. 2010] [Chamberlain, S. A., et al 2015] [Dicpi[INVESTIGATOR_641923], P. V., et 
al 2006] [Kuzniar, T. J., et al 2007] [French, C. L., et al 2017] [Everett, C. F., et al 2007] .
Syncope, urinary incontinence, headache ,and sleep deprivation are among the most severe
physical symptoms associated with chronic cough [Irwin, R. S. 2006] .Psychosocial 
symptoms including depression, embarrassment, and avoidance of activities are also common 
[Irwin, R. S. 2006] .Successful treatment of r efractory or unexplained chronic cough confers 
benefits beyond a reduction in cough to an improvement in associated physical symptoms 
and overall quality of life. 
Professional guidelines describe systematic approaches to the evaluation and management of 
chronic cough. These guidelines are based largely on consensus opi[INVESTIGATOR_641924]. There are currently no treatments approved by [CONTACT_641994] [Smith, J. A. 2016] . Given the prolonged nature, 
significant morbidity, and lack of effective treatment, unexplained or refractory chronic 
cough is a major unmet medical need.
Mecha nism of Cough
Each cough occurs through the stimulation of a comp lex reflex arc. Cough is initiated 
following activation of airway sensory nerves in the upper and lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352]. 
Airway sensory nerves are tailored to detect changes in the physical and chemical 
environment, and if required, elicit protective ref lex events such as cough. These reflexes are 
normally protective; however, in disease, airway reflexes can become hyperresponsive, 
leading to an increase in symptoms and a pathologic cough. 
P2X3 receptors are ligand -gated ion channels that respond to ATP and are almost exclusively 
localized on C- fiber sensory neurons, which innervate the upper and lower airways and are 
the main nerve fibers responsible for cough. Adenosine triphosphate is released by [CONTACT_121266], 
stressed, and inflamed tissues. The action of A TP at sensory neurons in the periphery and 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_641925]

binding to P2X3 -containing receptors and stimulating of C -fiber neurons [North, R. A. 2004 ] 
[Khakh, B. S. 2006] . Antagonism of P2X3- containing receptors is predicted to normalize 
sensory neuron sensitivity, based on data from P2X3 knock -out mice and the effects of small 
interfering RNA knock -down a nd pharmacological antagonists [Barclay, J., et al 2002] 
[Cockayne, D. A., et al 2000] [Souslova, V., et al 2000] . Ade nosine triphosphate and P2X3-
containing receptors have been shown to be involved in airways sensitization , and their 
involvement provides a rationale for P2X3 antagonism in the treatment of cough.
Stress Urinary Incontinence and Chronic Cough
Stress u rinary incontinence, defined as the i nvoluntary loss of urine in association with 
increased intra -abdominal pressure from coughing, sneezing or physical exertion, is the most 
common type of urinary incontinence in women ,with a n overall prevalence ranging from 
29% to 75% depending on age [Wood, L. N. 2014] .Stress incontinence can be further
classified as “pure” or “predominant” SUI, depending on whether there are any co- existing
symptoms of urinary urgency [Welk, B. 2017] .Although the exact prevalence of stress 
incontinence in women with chronic cough has not been well established, limited data 
suggest that a significant subset of chronic cough pat ients also experience SUI [Shariat, S. F., 
et al 2009] [Hrisanfow, E. 2012] .In onespecialty cough center in the US, approximately 
65% of women who presented with chronic cough ,when specifically questioned, reported 
SUIexclusively with a cough epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] [Dicpi[INVESTIGATOR_18964], P. 2019] . Furthermore, SUI is likely 
underreported in women with chronic cough, who may be reluctant to disclose symptoms of 
incontinence unless specifically asked.
Stress urinary incontinence is an important and socially debilitating complication of chronic 
cough in women , with a significant impact on quality of life . Patients with refractory or 
unexplained chronic cough who ex perience the onset or worsening of SUI carry a 
particularly significant health and quality- of-life burden related to both cough and 
incontinence symptoms. Treatment for pure stress or stress predominant urinary incontinence 
consists of pel vic ﬂoor muscle t raining and behavioral interventions; if these fail,continence 
surgery is often recommended. There is currently no globally approved pharmacological 
agen t for treating SUI. 
Mechanistically, epi[INVESTIGATOR_641926]-abdominal and bladder pressure beyond urethral resistance. Ineffective urethral 
resistance may be related to loss of connective tissue and/or pelvic muscular strength due to 
chronic pressure (ie, high- impact activity, chronic cough, or obesity) o r trauma due to 
childbirth, particularly vaginal deliveries [Lukacz, E. S., et al 2017] . 
Patients with refractory or unexplained chronic cough are exposed to repetitive daily 
increases in intra -abdominal pressure, which may predispose them to epi[INVESTIGATOR_641927]- induced
SUI. In addition, over time chronic cough may w eaken pelvic floor musculature, contribu ting 
to overall epi[INVESTIGATOR_641928]. Thus, symptoms of SUI may improve with successful treatment 
of refractory or unexplained chronic cough [Irwin, R. S. 2006] .

(Protocols 027, 030 and 038) , still ongoing, in participants with refractory or unexplained 
chronic cough. Protocols 027 and 030 are being conducted in approximately 720 and 
1290 participants, respectively, in the US ,Europe and other regions . In both studies, 
participants are randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to either gefapi[INVESTIGATOR_462717] 45 m g BID, gefapi[INVESTIGATOR_462717] 15 mg 
BID, or placebo. Protocol 038 is being conducted in approximately 160 participants in Japan; 
participants are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either gefapi[INVESTIGATOR_462717] 45mg BID or gefapi[INVESTIGATOR_462717]
15mg BID.
2.3 Benefit/Risk Asse ssment
It cannot be guaranteed that participants in clinical studies will directly benefit from 
treatment during participation, as clinical studies are designed to provide information about 
the safety and effectiveness of an investigational medicine.

evidence from nonclinical studies that gefapi[INVESTIGATOR_641940].

gefapi[INVESTIGATOR_641943]).
In the completed and ongoing clinical studies, no major safety concerns have been noted. 
Taste -related adverse experiences (eg, dysgeusia [ distortion in taste ], hypogeusia [diminished 
taste],ageusia [loss of taste ])were the most frequently reported AEs in clinical studies with 
doses up to 1800 mg B ID for 14 days. The percentage of participant s receiving doses ≤50 mg 
BID reported less taste -related AEs than those receiving doses >50 mg BID. Some 
participants also described oral paresthesias (tingling sensation in the mouth and/or throat). 
In many ins tances, participants reported oral paresthesia or hypoesthesia (numbness) 
concurrent with taste disturbances. 
There is a rationale for taste disturbance with P2X2/[ADDRESS_859343]: MK-7264  35

4 S TUDY DESIGN
4.1 Overall Design
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multi- sitestudy of gefapi[INVESTIGATOR_641953] .Approximately 
380 participants who meet entry criteria will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to 1 of 2 study 
intervention groups: placebo or gefapi[INVESTIGATOR_462717] (45 mg BID). The duration of intervention for 
each participant is as follows:
Screening Period: up to approximately 42days (see Section 8.10 .1)
Single -blind , Placebo R un-in period: approximately 14 days (see Section 8.10 .2)
Double -blind ,Study intervention period, including Randomization ( 12-week 
treatment p eriod ): approximately 84days (see Section 8.10 .3)
Follow -up Period: a pproximately 14 days (see Section 8.10 .5)
Individual partic ipation is expected to be approximately 22weeks from Screening through 
the Follow -up period.
The study will include 6 study visits and 2 scheduled telephone calls: Visit 1 (Screening from 
Week -8), Visit 2 (Placebo Run- in from Week -2 to Day -1), Visit 3 
(Baseline/ Randomization Day 1 ), Telephone Call (Day 7 ), Visit 4 (Week 4), Visit 5 
(Week 8), Visit 6 (Week 12), and Telephone Safety Follow -up(Week 14). In addition, 
reminder telephone calls will be made prior to Incontinence Diary completion.
Specific procedures to be performed during the study, as well as their prescribed times and 
associated visit windows, are outlined in the SoA in Section 1.3. Details of each procedure 
are provided in Section 8.
This study will be using a nexternal DMC to monitor safety and efficacy. There will be one 
planned IA when approximately 40% of the total randomized participants have either 
completed the study or discontinued study intervention early (all available follow -up data 
will be included in the analysis).
Results of the IA will be reviewed by [CONTACT_1363], which will make recommendations to the 
EOC of the Sponsor to continue or stop the study according to the statistical analysis plan 
described in Section 9 .The study may be stopped according to the results of the IA, either for 
futility or for efficacy (strong benefit) .
Final database lock will occur after all participants have completed or discontinued the study 
intervention early; anda full analysis will be conducted. Details on the analysis and blinding 
are provided in Section 9.2.

4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design
A 2-week, single -blind, Placebo R un-in period is included in the study design due to the high 
placebo response obser ved in urinary incontinence studies. A high placebo response is 
generally observed early in these studies and decreases over time; thus, the Placebo R un-in 
should allow sufficient time to exclu de participants with a n initial high placebo response. The 
inclusion of a [ADDRESS_859344] published 
studies in SUI. Based on these existing data, 12 weeks is a reasonable and sufficient duration 
of time in which to observe a meaningful reduction in cough symptoms ,as well as in SUI 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].
4.2.1 Rationale for Endpoints
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy Endpoints
Primary Endpoint :
The primary study endpoint is cough- induced SUIepi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] . The goal of this study is to 
demonstrate that gefapi[INVESTIGATOR_641954]-induced SUI in women with 
refractory or unexplained chronic cough, as evidenced by [CONTACT_641998] (reduction) 
from baseline in epi[INVESTIGATOR_641917] -induced SUIat Week [ADDRESS_859345] epi[INVESTIGATOR_641955], 
including Phase 3 clinical studies evaluating the use of duloxetine in SUI [Blaivas, Jerry G., 
etal 1997] [Dmochowski, R. R., et al 2003] [Millard, R. J., et al 2004] . In this study, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_641956] a week before each 
baseline and treatment visit as outlined in the So A(Section 1.3).For each incontinence 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the p articipant will record the main cause of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] :coughing, another stress 
reason, or other cause .
Exploratory Endpoints :
Recommendations for evaluating treatment outcomes in urinary incontinence include the 
assessment of health- related quality of life [Blaivas, Jerry G., et al 1997] [Lose, Gunnar, et al 
2001] . Therefore, an exploratory objective of the study will be to evaluate the efficacy of 
gefapi[INVESTIGATOR_641957] -related quality of life in women with refractory or unexplained 
chronic cough, as assessed by [CONTACT_941] I -QoL. Another exploratory objective of the study will be 
to evaluate the impact of gefapi[INVESTIGATOR_641958] , as assessed by [CONTACT_641999]. The study will also evaluate the impact of gefapi[INVESTIGATOR_641959], global rating of change using the PGIC questionnaire and impact o n work 
productivity using the WPAI.

Incontinence Quality of Life Questionnaire :The I -QoL is a validated disease -specific
questionnaire to evaluate the impact of urinary incontinence on activities and emotions in 
women [Patrick, D. L., et al 1999] . The I -QoL consists of 22 questions, each rated using a 
5-point response scale rangi ng from “extremely” to “not at all”. Item responses are 
summed across the 22 items and transformed to a 0 to 100 scale with lower scores 
reflecting better QoL. Three domain scores can also be calculated: avoidance and limiting 
behavior, psychosocial impact s, and social embarrassment.
Cough Severity Diary :The CSD is a validated, 7- item, disease -specific PRO measure 
with a recall period of “today.” The measure evaluates frequency of cough (3 items), 
intensity of cough ( 2items) ,and disruption due to cough (2 items); each item is rated on 
an 11 -point scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater severity. A 
CSD total score and 3 domain scores (frequency, intensity, disruption) can be calculated.
Domain scores are calculated as the average of the items within the domain and range 
from 1 to 7. The total score i s the sum of the domain scores with a range of 3 to 21.
Cough Severity Visual Analog Scale: The Cough Severity VAS is a single -item 
question asking the participant to rate the severity of their cough “today” using a 100 mm 
VAS anchored with “No Cough” at 0 and “Extremely Severe Cough” at 100. Similar to 
the well- established use of VAS scores in chronic pain, the Cough Severity VAS measure 
provides a quick and easily -interpreted subjective assessment useful for clinicians to 
monitor improvement of their chronic cough patients following treatment.
Patient Global Impression of Change Questionnaire : The PGIC is a 2- partmeasure
asking the participant to rate the change in their urinary incontinence compared to the 
start of the study ,with response options rangi ng from “very much better ” to “much 
worse” (7 -point scale) .Based on the response to the initial question, the participant is 
asked a follow- up question to evaluate the meaningfulness of the improvement or 
worsening, with response options of “ yes”or “no”indicating whether the improvement 
or worsening was important or not.
Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: The WPAI questionnaire 
yields 4 types of scores as follows: (1) absenteeism (work time missed); (2) presenteeism 
(impairment at work/ reduced on -the-job effectiveness); (3) work productivity loss 
(overall work impairment/absenteeism plus presenteeism); and (4) activity impairment. 
The WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers 
indicating greater impairment and less productivity, ie, worse outcomes [Reilly, M. C., et 
al 1993] . 
Participants will be asked to indicate if they are currently employed and to respond to the 
following questions referr ing to “the past 7 days”: work hours missed due to health 
problems, work hours missed for other reasons, hours actually worked, the degree to 
which their health has affected productivity while working, and the degree to which their 
health affected producti vity in regular unpaid activities.

[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Endpoints
The safety data for gefapi[INVESTIGATOR_641960]. 
In support of the objective to evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of gefapi[INVESTIGATOR_462717] , the 
safety and tolerability endpoints will be assessed by [CONTACT_642000], physical examination, and standard 
laboratory safety tests at timepoints specified in the SoA (Section 1.3) . Adverse events are 
graded and recorded according to Section 8.4 and Appendix 3 .
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
To determine exposure togefapi[INVESTIGATOR_462717] ,a blood sample will be collected, as specified in the 
SoA (Section 1.3) ,to estimate the C trough. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacodynamic Endpoints
No pharmacodynamic biomarkers that will require modeling are planned for this study.
[IP_ADDRESS] Planned Exploratory Biomarker Research
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_859346] a participant’s response to therapy, susceptibility to, severity, 
and progression of disease. Variable response to therapy may be due to genetic determinants 
that impact drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; mechanism of action of 
the drug; disease etiology; and/or molecular subtype of the disease being treated. Therefore, 
where local regulations and IRB/IEC allow, a sample will be collected for DNA analysis 
from consenting participants.
DNA samples may be used for research related to the study intervention( s), the disease under 
study, or related diseases. They may also be used to develop tests/assays including diagnostic 
tests related to the disease under study, related diseases, and study intervention(s). Genetic 
research may consist of the analysis of 1 or more candidate genes , the analysis of genetic 
markers throughout the genome , or analysis of the entire genome. Analysis may be 
conducted if it is hypothesized that this may help further understand the clinical data.
The samples may be analyzed as part of a multi -study assessment of genetic factors involved 
in the response to understand study disease or related conditions.
[IP_ADDRESS] Future Biomedical Research
The Sponsor will conduct future biomedical research on DNA specimens for which consent 
was provided during this clinical study.
Such research is for biomarker testing to address emergent questions not described elsewhere 
in the protocol (as part of the main study) and will only be conducted on specimens from 
appropriately consented participants. The objective of collecting/retaining specimens for

future biomedical research is to explore and identify biomarkers that inform the scientific 
understanding of diseases and/or their therapeutic treatments. The overarching goal is to use 
such information to develop safer, more effective drugs/vaccines, and/ or to ensure that 
participants receive the correct dose of the correct drug/vaccine at the correct time. The 
details of future biomedical research are presented in Appendix 6.
4.2.2 Rationale for the Use of Comparator/Placebo
A placebo is included in this study to maintain the study blinding, allowing for an unbiased 
assessment of efficacy and safety. Participants may discontinue the study intervention at any 
time. Given that there is no approved treatment for chronic cough, use of a placebo is 
justified.
4.[ADDRESS_859347] participant (or their legally acceptable representative)

6.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
6.3.1 Intervention Assignment
Intervention allocation/randomization will occur centrally using an interactive response 
technology (IRT) system. There are 2study intervention arms. Participants will be assigned 
randomly in a 1:1 ratio to gefapi[INVESTIGATOR_462717] 45 mg BID or placebo .
6.3.2 Stratification
Intervention allocation/randomization will be stratified according to the following factors:
1. Body mass index ( ≥30 versus <30 kg/m2)
2.Geographic region (North America, Europe, Asia -Pacific, Other) . Details of the regions 
will be provided in a separate supplemental document for randomization.
6.3.3 Blinding
During the Placebo Run -in period, participants only will be blinded to the study intervention 
(ie,single -blind). Following the Placebo Run -in period, a double -blinding technique with in-
house blinding will be used. G efapi[INVESTIGATOR_641973]. The participant, the investigator, 
and Sponsor personnel or delegate(s) who are involved in the study intervention
administration or clinical evaluation of the participants are unaware of the intervention 
assignments.
Details on the analys es and in -house blinding are provided in Section 9.2.
See Section 8.1.11 for a description of the method of unblinding a participant during the 
study, should such action be warranted .
6.4 Study Intervention Compliance
Records of intervention compliance for each participant will be kept during the study. The 
clinical research assoc iates will review intervention compliance during investigational site 
visits and at the completion of the study. Compliance should be based on participant 
reporting (and supplemented by [CONTACT_130674] ,where possible). Issues with compliance should 
be discus sed with the participant and addressed as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093] .
Interruptions from the protocol -specified intervention plan (compliance <80% between study 
visits, based on review with the participant )require consultation between the inve stigator and 
the Sponsor and written documentation of the collaborative decision on participant 
management.

6.5 Concomitant Therapy
Medications specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed during the 
ongoing study unless otherwise stated in this section. If there is a clinical indication for any 
medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited, discontinuation from study intervention 
may be required. The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the 
Sponsor Clinical Director . The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests 
with the investigator and/or the participant ’s primary physician. However, the decision to 
continue the participant on study intervention requires the mutual agreement of the 
investigator, the Sponsor, and the participant.
For participants who receive study intervention, any medication (including ove r-the-counter 
medications) or therapy administered to the participant during the course of the study will be 
recorded on the Prior and Concomitant Therapy CRF. Treatments for chronic cough and SUI 
received by [CONTACT_642005]. The inve stigator(s) will record any AE on 
the AEs CRF for which a concomitant medication/therapy was administered.
Listed below are specific restrictions for prior/ concomitant therapy during the course of the 
study:

6.7 Intervention After the End of the Study
There is no study -specified intervention following the end of the study.
6.8 Clinical Supplies Disclosure
The emergency unblinding call center will use the intervention/randomization schedule for 
the study to unblind participants and to unmask study intervention identity . The emergency 
unblinding call center should only be used in cases of emergency (see Section 8.1.10). In the 
event that the emergency unblinding call center is not available for a given site in this study, 
the central electronic intervention allocation/randomization system (IRT) should be used to 
unblind participants and to unmask study intervention identity. The Sponsor will not provide 
random code/disclosure envelopes or lists with the clinical supplies.

up, even if the participant has discontinued study intervention. The refore, all participants 
who discontinue study intervention prior to completion of the protocol -specified trea tment 
period will still continue to participate in the study as specified in Section 1.[ADDRESS_859364] 
occur. In addition, a participant may be discontinued from study intervention by [CONTACT_642006] S ponsor if study intervention is inappropriate, the study plan is violated, or 
for administrative and/or other safety reasons. Specific details regarding procedures to be 
performed at study intervention discontinuation are provided in Section 8.1. 10.
A part icipant must be discontinued from study intervention but continue to be monitored in 
the study for any of the following reasons:
•The participant or participant’s legally acceptable representative requests to discontinue 
study intervention.
• The participant’ s treatment assignment has been unblinded by [CONTACT_093], MSD

8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
•Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA.
•Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is 
essential and required for study conduct.
•The investigator is responsible for ensuring that procedures are conducted by 
[CONTACT_19426] (by [CONTACT_8640], traini ng, and experience) staff. Delegation of study 
site personnel responsibilities will be docu mented in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or 
equivalent).
•All study- related medica l decisions must be made by [CONTACT_19427] a qualified 
physician.
•All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record rea sons for 
screening failure, as applicable.
•Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, chest 
x-ray) and obtained before signing of ICF may be utilized for screening or baseline 
purposes provided the procedure met the protocol -specified criteria and were performed 
within the time frame defined in the SoA. The Sponsor may provide protocol -specific 
guidance and/or guidance for special circumstances.
•Additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by [CONTACT_20616] r and or the 
Sponsor for reasons related to participant safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing 
may be potentially sensitive in nature (eg, HIV, Hepatitis C), and thus local regulations 
may require that additional informed consent be obtained from t he participant. In these 
cases, such evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations.
The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of the study
(based on the So A)will not exceed 40mL(Appendix 2). Repeat or unscheduled samples 
may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the samples ; blood volumes for 
these repeat or unscheduled samples are not included in the above calculation of maximum 
amount of blood collected. Some local regu lations require blood samples to be drawn for 
additional serology testing; blood volumes for these samples are also not included in the 
maximum amount of blood collected (Section 10.7) .

the participant study file by [CONTACT_093].
For participants with eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2and <50 mL/min/1.73 m2at 
Screening/Visit 1with stable renal function (unstable renal function is defined as a ≥50% 
increase of serum creatinine compared to a value obtained at least 6 months prior to 
Screening/ Visit 1), documentation of stable serum creatinine must be retained as source 
documentation at the study site .
8.1.[ADDRESS_859368] information (including direct 
telephone numbers) to be used in the event of an emergency. The investigator or qualified 
designee will provide the participant with a participant identification card immediately after 
the participant provides documented informed consent. At the time of intervention
(randomization), site personnel will add the treatm ent/randomization number to the 
participant identification card.
The participant identification card also contains contact [CONTACT_19430] a healthcare provider can obtain information about study 
intervention in emergency situations where the investigator is not available.
8.1.4 Medical History
A medical history will be obtained by [CONTACT_27404] (refer to eCRF 
entry guidelines) .
8.1.5 Medical Epi[INVESTIGATOR_641912] (MESA) Questionnaire
The MESA is a 15 -item validated questionnaire adapted from the MESA survey [Diokno, A. 
C., et al 1999] . The MESA is used to identify participants with symptoms of urge and/or 
stress incontinence. I tem response options are: never (0), rarely (1), sometimes (2), or often 
(3). The stress score is comprised of 9 items with a total score ranging from 0 to 27; the urge 
score is comprised of 6 items with a total score ranging from 0 to 18. The MESA will be used 
in this study to identify participants with pure or predominant stress incontinence as indicated 
by [CONTACT_642007] 3 criteria: a stress total score ≥7, an urge total score ≤12, and a 
stress score ratio greater than the urge score ratio. The ME SA questionnaire (along with the 
Cough Severity VAS) will be completed by [CONTACT_642008]/Visit 1.
Participants must also have a history of cough -induced SUI, based on their responses to the 
following questions on the MESA: response of ‘sometimes’ or ‘often’ to the question, “Does 
coughing gently cause you to lose urine ?” ORtothe question, “Does coughing hard cause 
you to lose urine? ”.

8.1.8 Assignment of Treatment/Randomization Numb er
All eligible participants will be randomly allocated and will receive a 
treatment /randomization number. The treatment /randomization number identifies the 
participant for all procedures occurring after treatment allocation/randomization. Once a 
treatment /randomization number is assigned to a participant, it can never be re -assigned to 
another participant.
A single participant cannot be assigned more than 1 treatment /randomization number.
8.1.9 Study Intervention Administrati on
The distribution of study intervention will be performed by [CONTACT_1755]/or study staff 
at the study site visits. 
At Placebo Run -in/Visit 2, study intervention (placebo only for all participants) will be 
dispensed by[CONTACT_3452] .
Then ,according to when the clinic visit is during the day, the participant will take the first 
dose of study intervention either in the morning or in the evening. Subsequent dosing should 
be performed by [CONTACT_642009] 12 hours apart and approximately at the 
same time each day for the duration of the study. 
At Randomization, gefapi[INVESTIGATOR_462717] 45 mg BID or placebo will be dispensed by [CONTACT_3452] . 
Participants should be instructed to follow the same dosing schedule as described for the

change of treatment (or that they are entering a different treatment phase) at 
Randomization/ Visit 3 (Section 8.10.2 and Section 8.10.3).
The last dose of study intervention will be on the evening prior to Visit 6 . Study intervention 
supplies will be collected and accountability will be performed at Visit 3, Visit 4, Visit 5, and 
Visit 6.
[IP_ADDRESS] Timing of Dose Administration
Study intervention will be administered orally, BID, approximately 12 hours apart for 
approximately 12 weeks ( 84 days) during the study.
A missed dose may be taken if it is <4 hours after the expected dosing time .If it is ≥4 hours 
after the expected dosing time, then the dose can be skipped, and the regular schedule 
resumed.
8.1.10 Discontinuation and Withdrawal
Participants who discontinue study intervention prior to completion of the intervention period
should be encouraged to continue to be fol lowed for all remaining study visits as outlined in 
the SoA (Section 1.3) and Section 8. 10.3.
When a participant withdraws from participation in the study, all applicable activities 
scheduled for the Discontinuation Visitshould be performed (at the time of withdrawal). Any 
AEs that are present at the time of withdrawal should be followed in accordance with the 
safety requirements outlined in Section 8.4.
[IP_ADDRESS] Withdrawal From Future Biomedical Resear ch
Participants may withdraw their consent for future biomedical r esearch. Participants may 
withdraw consent at any time by [CONTACT_111954]. If medical 
records for the main study are still available, the investigator will contact [CONTACT_642010] ([EMAIL_1250]). Subsequently, the 
participant's consent for future biomedical r esearch will be withdrawn. A letter will be sent 
from the Sponsor to the investigator confirming the withdrawal. It is the responsibil ity of the 
investigator to inform the participant of completion of withdrawal. Any analyses in progress 
at the time of request for withdrawal or already performed prior to the request being received 
by [CONTACT_642011]. 
No new analyses would be generated after the request is received.
In the event that the medical records for the main study are no longer available (eg, if the 
investigator is no longer required by [CONTACT_642012]) 
or the specimens have been completely anonymized, there will no longer be a link between 
the participant’s personal information and their specimens. In this situation, the request for 
specimen withdrawal cannot be proce ssed.

8.1.11 Participant Blinding/Unblindi ng
STUDY INTERVENTION IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION IS TO BE UNMASKED 
ONLY IF NECESSARY FOR THE WELFARE OF THE PARTICIPANT. EVERY 
EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE NOT TO UNBLIND.
For emergency situations ,where the investigator or medi cally qualified designee (consistent 
with local requirements) needs to identify the intervention used by a participant and/or the 
dosage administered, he/she will contact [CONTACT_88693] a request for emergency un blinding. As requested by [CONTACT_19445], the emergency unblinding call center will provide the information to 
him/her promptly and report unblinding to the Sponsor. Prior to contact[CONTACT_88694] a participant’s intervention assignment, the 
investigator ,who is a qualified physician ,should make reasonable attempts to enter the 
intensity of the AEs observed, the relation to study intervention, the reason thereof, etc, in the 
medical chart. If it is not possible to record this assessment in the chart prior to the 
unblinding, the unblinding should not be delayed.
In the event that unblinding has occurred, the circumstances around the unblinding (eg, date, 
reason, and person p erforming the unblinding) must be documented promptly, and the 
Sponsor Clinical Director notified as soon as possible.
Once an emergency unblinding has taken place, the investigator, site personnel, and Sponsor 
personnel may be unblinded so that the approp riate follow -up medical care can be provided 
to the participant.
Participants whose treatment assignment has been unblinded by [CONTACT_93311]/or nonstudy treating physician must be discontinued from study 
intervention, but should continue to be monitored in the study.
Additionally, the investigator or medically qualified designee must go into the IRT system 
and perform the unblind in the IRT system to update drug disposition. In the event that the 
emergency unblinding c all center is not available for a given site in this study, the IRT 
system should be used for emergency unblinding in the event that this is required for 
participant safety.
8.1.12 Calibration of Equipme nt
The investigator or qualified designee has the responsibility to ensure that any device or 
instrument used for a clinical evaluation/test during a clinica l study that provides information 
about inclusion/exclusion criteria and/or safety or efficacy parameters shall be suitably 
calibrated and/or maintained to ensure that the data obtained are reliable and/or reproducible. 
Documentation of equipment calibration must be retained as source documentation at the 
study site .

8.2 Efficacy Assessmen ts
Compliance with the efficacy and safety assessments (along with study intervention use) and 
visit schedule is essential, and any noncompliance noted by [CONTACT_642013].
8.2.1 Patient -reported Outcomes
At Screening/ Visit 1, each participant will be dispensed and instructed on the use of an 
electronic diary ( e-Diary ) for completing the ePRO measures. Participants should bring their 
e-Diary device for all study visits and should be contact[CONTACT_642014] (eg, by 
[CONTACT_642015]) before each study visit.
Between clinic visits , participants will be instructed to complete the Incontinence Diary 
throughout each day at the time of each SUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] ,and then again with the other ePRO 
measures ( in the following order: Incontinence Diary , CSD, and Cough Severity VAS )at 
approximately the same time each evening . The Incontinence Diary should be completed for 
the 7 days prior to a study visit , and the CSD and Cough Severity VAS should be completed 
daily between Visits 1 and 6 (as outlined in the SoA, Section 1.3) .If a participant fails to 
complete the Incontinence Diary , CSD and/or Cough Severity VAS ePRO measure(s), the 
e-Diary will allow the participant, based on recall, to complete these missed measures the 
next day (also see vendor’s site manual for further details). Participants will be prompted 
within the e-Diary to complete the missed measures first, prior to the measures for the current 
day.
At the clinic visits, p articipants will be asked to complete eP RO measure s (in the following 
order: Cough Severity VAS, I-
QoL, PGIC ,and WPAI )as outlined in the SoA (also see 
vendor’s site manual for further details). All Visit 1,2,and [ADDRESS_859370] dose of study intervention/Randomization (see 
vendor’s site manual for further details).
Electronic PRO measures must be activated ,as outlined in the SoA. More details on PRO 
measures are given in Section [IP_ADDRESS].
Participants who discontinue study intervention early will continue to be monitored in the 
study and should be encouraged to continue to complete the ePRO measures for the 
remaining visits (as outlined in the SoA) through the end of the study.  At the discontinuation 
visit,participants will be asked to complete ePRO measures (in the following order: I -QoL, 
PGIC, and WPAI) ,as outlined in the SoA (also see vendor’s site manual for further details) .
Compliance with daily completion of the eDiaries should be monitored by [CONTACT_170270]. Each investigator site will contact [CONTACT_642016] -compliant in 
order to retrain and/or remind them to complete their assessments as per the SoA 
(Section 1.3). Discus sion with the participant and retraining will be performed if any 
question on any e- Diary is missing and/or if any e- Diary scheduled for completion per the 
SoA is missing, in error .

should return the e -Diary to the study site and all ePRO measures should be deactivated.
Data collection for all ePRO measures will be dependent on ePRO de vice and software 
availability.
[IP_ADDRESS] Incontinence Diary
The Incontinence Diary is designed as an event diary to be completed each time a participant 
experiences a urine leak .A “urine leak” is defined as an accidental leakage of urine of any 
amount. The participant is required to report EVERY urine leak, even if the leak is a small 
amount (for example, a few drops), and torecord the main cause of the urine leak as follows:
a.“Coughing” – the participant willchoose this option if coughing or a coughing fit was 
the main cause of their urine leak.
b.“Another stress reason” –the participant will choose this option if another 
stress -related activity such as sneezing, laughing, lifting something heavy, moving 
too quickly, or other physical activity was the main cause of their u rine leak.
c.“Other cause” – the participant willchoose this option if the main cause of their urine 
leak was something other than coughing or a nother stress -related activity.
In the evening ,the e -Diary will provide participants with a summary of theurine leaks they 
have reported during that day and will prompt them to enter any urine leaks they may have 
forgotten to report. The following morning, the e -Diary will again prompt the participant to 
report any urine leaks during the night that were not yet report ed.
The Incontinence Diary should be completed throughout each day as each urine leak occurs 
for the [ADDRESS_859371] dose of study intervention in the Placebo Run- in/Visit 2 period 
and for the 7 days prior to each subsequent study visit ,as outlined in the SoA (Section 1.3) .
A reminder telephone call to the participant will be scheduled prior to each [ADDRESS_859372] to reschedule a visit , and the rescheduling occurs after 
completing the Incontinence Diary for 7 days, they should continue to complete diary entries 
for every additional day until the visit. If the rescheduled visit is delayed beyond 7 additional 
days, the Sponsor/C linical Research Associate should be contact[CONTACT_130375].
Should a participant not complete all [ADDRESS_859373] of the study.
Please note :participants must have at least 4days of Incontinence Diary data during the 
7-day eligibility period prior to each of Placebo Run -in/Visit 2 and Randomization/ Visit 3to 
be eligible for study participation.

[IP_ADDRESS] Cough Severity Diary
Participants will complete the CSD daily at approximately the same time each evening before 
going to bed, as outlined in the SoA (Section 1.3) . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Cough Severity Visual Analog Scale 
Participants will be asked to rate the severity of their cough over the pas t 24 hours using a 
100-mm Cough Severity VAS single -item questionnaire ,with the response ranging from 0 
(“No Cough”) to 100 (“Extremely Severe Cough”).
At Screening/ Visit 1, participant s will complete a single Cough Severity VAS questionnaire 
at the study visit in order to assess the eligibility criteria. For the rem ainder of the study
(Visits 1 through 6), p articipants will complete the Cough Severity VAS daily at 
approximately the same time each evening before going to bed ,as outlined in the SoA

8.3.[ADDRESS_859381] of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA for 
the timing and frequency.
•The investigator or medically qualified designee (consistent with local requirements) 
must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically 
relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the case report form 
(CRF). The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the 
underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_78259]'s condition.
•All protocol- required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix [ADDRESS_859382] be 
conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA (Section 1.3) .
•If laboratory values from nonprotocol -specified laboratory assessments performed at the 
institution’s l ocal laboratory require a change in study participant management or are 
considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_093] (eg, SAE or AE or dose 
modification), then the results must be recorded in the appropriate CRF (eg, SLAB).
•For any laboratory test s with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during 
participation in the study or within 7days after the last dose of study intervention, every 
attempt should be made to perform repeat assessments until the values return to normal or 
baselin e or if a new baseline is established as determined by [CONTACT_093] .
8.3.9 Renal and Urological Safety Assessments
Safety assessments will be performed in all participants in order to monitor renal and 
urological safety during the course of the study. Partic ipants will be monitored for hematuria 
and urinary crystal sthrough urinalysis (performed at the central laboratory).

[IP_ADDRESS] Screening
If, during screening, a participant has unexplained hematuria (defined as , for example, 
participants without a history of recent menses, urinary tract infection, or recent 
procedure/instrumentation that would explain the hematuria), the participant should not be 
enrolled. ( Note: Any other explanation for hematuria finding must be reviewed wit h the 
Sponsor).
If,during screening, a participant has crystalluria , the investigator should:
Review and confirm if the finding is a new finding or a previously documented 
finding.
Evaluate t he participant’s medical history to identify conditions (ie, prior renal 
disease, prior history of kidney stones, medications, gastrointestinal conditions) and 
make a clinical determination if the participant is at high or low risk of potential 
complications/worsening due to an associated renal/urina ry condition or its treatment, 
or requires a change in therapy for that condition that may interfere with 
interpretation of safety data collected during the study .
If high risk, the participant should not be enrolled and should be considered for 
further ev aluation.
If low risk, the participant may continue with screening.
[IP_ADDRESS] Visit 6/Discontinuation
AtVisit 6 or Discontinuation Visit, a urine sample will be collected from allparticipants, as 
outlined in the SoA. If unexplained hematuria and/or urinary crystals are identified and 
deemed to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_093] ,the participant should be considered 
for further evaluation. If an investigator deems it necessary to perform an unscheduled 
urinalysis at any time during the study (after randomization), the same procedures for 
collection/preparation of the urine sample and evaluation of hematuria (as explained or 
unexplained) described for Visit 6 or Discontinuation Visit should be performed .
8.4 Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events ( SAEs) ,and Other Reportable 
Safety Events
The definitions of an AE or SAE, as well as the method of recording, evaluating, and 
assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures for completing and transmitting AE, 
SAE, and other reportable safety event r eports can be found in Appendix 3 .
Adverse events, SAEs, and other reportable safety events will be reported by [CONTACT_2299] 
(or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized 
representative).

8.4.2 Method of Detecting AE s, SAE s,and Other Reportable Safety Events
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE sand/or SAEs and other 
reportable safety events. Open- ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is 
the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence.
8.4.3 Follow -up of AE, SAE ,and Other Reportable Safety Event Information
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All AE s, SAE s, and other reportable safety events ,
including pregnancy and exposure during breastfeeding, events of clinical interest (ECI s), 
cancer, and overdose will be followed until resolution, stabilization, until the event is 
otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3). In 
addition, the investigator will make every attempt to follow all nonserious AEs that occur in
randomized participants for outcome. Further information on follow -up procedures is given 
in Appendix 3.
8.4.4 Regulatory Re porting Requirements for SAE
Prompt notification (within 24 hours) by [CONTACT_88701] a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
Sponsor will comply w ith country -specific regulatory requirements and global laws and 
regulations relating to safety reporting to regulatory authorities , IRB/IECs, and investigators.
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R s) according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and 
forwarded to investigators as necessary.
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAE) from the Sponsor will file it 
along with the I Band will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements .
8.4.5 Pregnancy and Exposure During Breastfeeding
Although pregnancy and infant exposure during breastfeeding are not considered AEs, any
pregnancy or infant exposure during breastfeeding in a participant (spontaneously reported to 
the investigator or their designee) that occurs during the study are reportable to the Sponsor.
All reported pregnancies must be followed to the completion/termi nation of the pregnancy. 
Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, 
blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage, and stillbirth must be reported as 
serious events (Important Medical Events). If th e pregnancy continues to term, the outcome 
(health of infant) must also be reported.

Selected nonserious and SAEs are also known as ECIs and must be reported to the Sponsor.
Events of clinical interest for this study include:
An elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper limit 
of normal and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 2X 
the upper limit of normal and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase lab value that 
is less than 2X the upper limit of normal, as determined by [CONTACT_13149] -specified 
laboratory testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.*
*Note: These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The 
purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require 
an additional evaluation for an underlying etiology. The study site guidance for 
assess ment and follow -up of these criteria can be found in the Investigator Study File 
Binder (or equivalent).
Reporting time periods and time frames are fully detailed in Table 3 .
8.5 Treatment of Overdose
In this study, an overdose is any dose >1 tablet BID (Section 4.3.2). Study intervention 
should be taken once in the morning and once in the evening. If more than the 
protocol -specified intervention is taken within a 1- day peri od (ie, >2 tablets/day) ,this is 
regarded as an overdose .
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose. Oral doses of up to

8.10 Visit Requirements
Visit requirements are outlined in Section 1.3. Specific procedure -related details are provided 
inSection 8.
8.10.1 Screening
Approximately 3 to 8 weeks (including the 2- week Placebo Run-i n period) prior to 
intervention randomization, potential participants will be evaluated to determine whether
they fulfill the entry requirements as set forth in Section 5.   
Participants who are consented will complete the Cough Severity VAS and MESA on the day 
of Screening/ Visit 1at the clinic, prior to completing other screening procedures (in order to 
first determine if the participant meets the Screening/ Visit 1 Cough Severity VAS and MESA 
entry criteri a). 
Washout of concomitant medication is permitted after signing informed consent; participant s 
may wash out of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_641982] (ie, at least 2 weeks prior to the
start of Placebo Run- in/Visit 2 )and remain off of them through the c ompletion of the study.
The investigator should evaluate the participant’s medical history and overall condition in 
making the decision as to whether participant s can withdraw from medications in order to 
participate in the study.
Participants will be contact[CONTACT_642018] 7-day Incontinence Diary assessment period before 
Placebo Run-in/Visit 2 to remind them to complete the Incontinence Diary for the 7 days 
prior to the next study visit.
Participants are to be reminded to bring their e-Diary device w ith them to the next visit.
8.10.2 Single -blind Placebo Run -in Period
During the 2 -week, single -blind, Placebo Run- in period (approximately 2 weeks prior to
intervention randomization) , participants will again be evaluated to determine that they fulfil l
the entry requirements outlined in Section 5. Upon fulfilling participation requirements, 
participants will be provided with placebo study intervention to be taken BID for 2 weeks .
(Note:only participants will be blinded to the study intervention during the Placebo Run- in 
period).
While the study site will be aware that the participants are receiving placebo during the 
Placebo Run-in period, the participants themselves must not be informed that they are 
receiving placebo at the Placebo Run -in/Visit [ADDRESS_859391]:   MK-7264  77
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:   [ADDRESS_859392] not be told that this study consists of a single -blind period and a 
double -blind period, or that they need to meet eligib ility criteria to enter the double -blind 
period. 
Participants will be contact[CONTACT_642018] 7- day Incontinence Diary assessment period before
Randomization/ Visit 3to remind them to complete the Incontinence Diary for the 7 days 
prior to the next study visit.
Participants are to be reminded to bring their e-Diary device with them to the next visit.
8.10.3 Double -blind Treatment Period
At Randomization/Visit 3, participants will again be evaluated for eligibility to participate in 
the study based on the requirements outlined in Section 5. The participant must not be told 
that they are entering the double -blind period, or that the study intervention may change 
during this time. Once randomized ,participants will receive either gefapi[INVESTIGATOR_462717] 45 mg or 
placebo BID for 12 weeks. Both the participants and study personnel will be blinded to the 
study intervention.
Participants will be contact[CONTACT_642018] 7- day Incontinence Diary assessment period before
Visit s4 to 6 to remind them to complete the Incontinence Diary for the 7 days prior to the 
next study visit. Participants will be contact[CONTACT_304159] 7 (+3 days; following 
Randomization/Visit 3) to review any AEs that may have occurred and concomitant 
medications taken, instructions on/compliance with study drug administration ,and e -Diary 
completion (as necessary), and any questions the participant may have about the study.  
For all study site visits, participants are to be reminded to bring their e-Diary device with 
them to the next visit. Randomization/Visit 3will be assigned as Day 1, and subsequent visit 
scheduling will be calculated from Day 1 (and not from the previous visit).
8.10.4 Discontinued Participants Continuing to be Monitored in the Study
It is intended that all participants should be followed through completion of the study, 
regardless of premature discontinuation of intervention, unless the participant withdraws 
consent. Thus, participants who discontinue from study intervention prior to completion of 
the study should continue to be monitored to obta in relevant information through the end of 
the study. 
If a participant is discontinued from the study intervention early:
the Discontinuation Visit should be performed as soon as possible ;
If feasible, participants should be instructed to complete the Inc ontinence Diary and 
other PROs during the 7 days prior to the Discontinuation Visit .
Procedures, including e -Diary assessments, should be performed as outlined for the

PRODUCT:   MK-7264  78
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:   042 -03  
MK-7264 -042-03 FINAL PROTOCOL 23-NOV -2020
Note: I f a participant discontinues at a regularly scheduled study visit, the procedures 
outlined for the Discontinuation Visit in the SoA should be followed in place of the 
procedures for the regularly scheduled study visit.
a safety follow- up telephone callshould be conducted a minimum of 14 days (with an 
allowed variance of up to +7 days) after the last dose of study intervention; and
Study site visits should continue to be performed at timepoints that correspond to 
each remaining study visit. These visits will allow collection of follow -up 
information, limited to :
-AEs;
- C oncomitant medication use ;and 
- e- Diary assessments ,as outlined in the SoA (Section 1.3) .  
Note: I f the participant discontinues study intervention at a regularly scheduled study visit
but remains in the study, the Discontinuation Visit should be performed, and the regularly 
scheduled study visits should resume thereafter.  
For example: If a participant discontinues study intervention at the time of Visit 4, 
procedures for the Discontinuation Visit should be performed at that time. The next expected 
study visit would be Visit 5, followed by [CONTACT_4838] 6.
Concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_486429] (see Section 6.5) while th e participant was on 
study intervention are no longer prohibited after discontinuation of study intervention.
For those participants who have discontinued study intervention early and who miss 
remaining study visits , sites will be instructed to exert dilig ent efforts to continue to 
contact [CONTACT_476]. To enable sites to reach participants, the participants should provide 
primary and secondary contact [CONTACT_3031] (eg, home telephone, work telephone, 
mobile telephone). Sites must document the outcome of the telepho ne contact(s), to 
demonstrate diligent efforts have been made.
Additionally, the ICF will explain the importance of continued data collection from 
participants, including the use of continued contact [CONTACT_107461].
8.10.5 Poststudy
All participants that complete t he treatment period will be required to complete the safety
follow -up telephone call approximately 2 weeks ( 14 days , with an allowed variance of up to 
+7 days) after the last dose of study intervention to determine if any AEs have occurred since 
discontinuing study intervention .
Note: Participants that discontinue intervention and/or discontinue from the study should also 
complete the safety follow -up telephone call 14 days (+7 days) after the last dose of 
intervention. See Section 8.10.[ADDRESS_859393]:   MK-7264  79
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:   [ADDRESS_859394] dose of study 
intervention, a subsequent follow -up telephone call should be made at approximately 
2weeks ( 14 days, with an allowed variance of up to +7 days) po st the last dose of study 
intervention.
9 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN
This section outlines the statistical analysis strategy and procedures for the study. If, after the 
study has begun, but prior to any unblinding, there are changes made to the primary 
hypothesis , or the statistical methods related to th ishypothe sis, then the protocol will be 
amended (consistent with ICH Guidance for Industry E9). Changes to exploratory analyses 
made after the protocol has been finalized, but prior to unblinding, will be docu mented in a 
sSAP and referenced in the CSRfor the study. Post -hoc exploratory analyses will be clearly 
identified in the CSR. Other planned analyses (ie, those specific to the analysis of 
pharmacokinetic data and planned genetic analysis ) are beyond the s cope of this document or
will be documented in separate analysis plans.
9.1 Statistical Analysis Plan Summary
Key elements of the statistical analysis plan are summarized below. The comprehensive plan 
is provided in Sections 9.2 through 9.12.
Study Design 
OverviewA Phase 3b, Randomized, Placebo Controlled ,Multicenter Study 
to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Gefapi[INVESTIGATOR_641983] (P042)
Treatment Assignment Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment 
groups: G efapi[INVESTIGATOR_462717] 45 mg BID or Placebo .
Analysis Populations Efficacy: FAS population which consists of all randomized 
participants who have taken at least 1 dose of study intervention.
Safety: APaT populati on, which consists of all randomized 
participants who received at least [ADDRESS_859395]:   MK-7264  80
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:   [ADDRESS_859396] squares mean % change from baseline 
with the associated standard errors will be displayed for each 
treatment group. An overall estimated treatment difference 
(Gefapi[INVESTIGATOR_462717] − Placebo) along with corresponding CIs and p
value will also be presented for the entire follow -upperiod. 
Statistical Methods for 
Key Safe ty AnalysesThe analysis of safety endpoints will follow a tiered approach. 
The tiers differ with respect to the analyses that will be 
performed. Tier 1 and Tier 2 safety endpoints will be evaluated 
via point estimates and 95% CIs for between -group 
compari sons, with p values provided for the Tier 1 safety 
endpoints. These analyses will be performed using the Miettinen 
and Nurminen method [Miettinen, O. and Nurminen, M. 1985] . 
Tier 3 safety endpoints will be evaluated via point estimates 
only.
Interim Analyses One planned IAfor efficacy and futility will be performed in this 
study. Results will be reviewed by a n external DMC . The IA is 
summarized below. Details are provided in Section 9.7. 
Timing: To be performed when approximately 40% of 
participants ( approximately the first 15 2 randomized 
participants) have either completed the study or 
discontinued the study intervention early. 
Testing: Efficacy and Futility boundaries based on the 
primary endpoint will be provided. 
Multiplicity Since there is only one hypothesis testing for the primary 
endpoint, no multiplicity adjustment is planned other than the IA 
alpha adjustment to the pr imary efficacy endpoint.

The analysis of safety results will follow a tiered approach (Table 4). The tiers differ with 
respect to the analyses that will be performed. Adverse events (specific terms as well as 
system organ class terms) and events that meet predefined limits of change in l aboratory and 
vital signs are either pre -specified as “Tier 1” endpoints, or will be classified as belonging to 
"Tier 2" or "Tier 3" based on the observed proportions of participants with an event. 
Tier [ADDRESS_859402] that are identified a priori constitute “Tier 1” 
safety endpoints that will be subject to inferential testing for statistical significance with 
p -values and 95% CIs to be provided for between -treatment differences in the proportion of 
participants wi th events; these analyses will be performed using the Miettinen and Nurminen 
(M&N) method (1985) [Miettinen, O. and Nurminen, M. 1985], an unconditional, asymptotic 
method. For this protocol, taste -related AEs ( including dysgeusia, ageusia, and hypogeusia, 
as well as other related terms) are considered Tier 1 events. The definition of taste -related 
AEs will be finalized and documented before the database lock of the study.
Tier 2 Events
Tier 2 parameters will be assessed via point estimates and 95% CIs provided for differences 
in the proportion of participants with events. 
Inclusion in Tier [ADDRESS_859403] 4 events was cho sen because the 95% confidence interval for 
the between -group difference in percent incidence will always include zero when treatment 
groups of equal size each have less than 4 events and thus would add little to the 
interpretation of potentially meaningfu l differences. Because many 95% confidence intervals

10 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL 
CONSIDERATIONS
10.1 Appendix 1: Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations
10.1.[ADDRESS_859406] for Clinical Trials
[COMPANY_006] Sharp and Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of [COMPANY_006] & Co., Inc. (MSD)
Code of Conduct for Interventional Clinical Trials
I. Introduction
A.Purpose
MSD, through its subsidiaries, conducts clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our 
products. As such, we are committed to designing, implementing, conducting, analyzing ,and reporting these trials 
in compliance with the highest ethical and scientific standards. Protection of participant s inclinical trials is the 
overriding concern in the design and conduct of clinical trials . In all cases, M SD clinical trials will be conducted 
in compliance with local and/or national regulations , and International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical 
Practice ( ICH-GCP) ,and also in accordance with the ethical principles that have their ori gin in the Declaration of 
Helsinki.
B.Scope
Highest ethical and scientific standards shall be endorsed for all clinical interventional investigations sponsored by 
[CONTACT_19481] (parties) employed for their execution (e.g., contract researc h organizations, 
collaborative research efforts). This Code is not intended to apply to trials that are observational in nature, or 
which are retrospective. Further, this Code does not apply to investigator -initiated trials , which are not under the 
full co ntrol of M SD.
II.Scientific Issues
A.Trial Conduct
1.Trial Design
Except for pi[INVESTIGATOR_19354], clinical trial protocols will be hypothesis -driven to assess safety, efficacy 
and/or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic indices of M SD or comparator products. Alternatively, M SD
may conduct outcomes research trials, trials to assess or validate various endpoint measures, or trials to 
determine patient preferences, etc.
The design (i.e. , participant population, duration, statistical power) mu st be adequate to address the specific
purpose of the trial. P articipants must meet protocol entry criteria to be enrolled in the trial. 
2.Site Selection
MSD selects investigative sites based on medical expert[INVESTIGATOR_18700], access to appropriate participants, adeq uacy of 
facilities and staff, previous performance in clinical trials, as well as budgetary considerations. Prior to trial 
initiation, sites are evaluated by M SD personnel (or individuals acting on behalf of MSD) to assess the ability 
to successfully condu ct the trial.
3.Site Monitoring/Scientific Integrity
Investigative trial sites are monitored to assess compliance with the trial protocol and Good Clinical Practice
(GCP). MSD reviews clinical data for accuracy, completeness, and consistency. Data are verified versus 
source documentation according to standard operating procedures. Per M SD policies and procedures, if fraud, 
0882KP
PRODUCT:   MK-7264  92
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:   042 -03  
MK-7264 -042-03 FINAL PROTOCOL 23-NOV -2020
scientific/research misc onduct or serious GCP -non-compl iance is suspected, the issues are investigated. 
When necessary, the clinical site will be closed, the responsible regulatory authorities and ethics review 
committees notified .
B. Publication and Authorship
Regardless of trial outcome, MSD commits to publi shtheprimary and secondary results of its registered trials of 
marketed products in which treatment is assigned, according to the pre -specified plans for data analysis. To the 
extent scientifically appropriate, M SDseeks to publish the results of other a nalyses it conducts that are important 
to patients, physicians, and payers. Some early phase or pi[INVESTIGATOR_26346] -generating rather 
than hypothesis testing ;in such cases, publication of results may not be appropriate since the tri al may be 
underpowered and the analyses complicated by [CONTACT_19482].
MSD’s policy on authorship is consistent with the re commendations published by [CONTACT_26399] (ICMJE). In summary, autho rship should reflect significant contribution to the design and 
conduct of the trial, performance or interpretation of the analysis, and/or writing of the manuscript. All named 
authors must be able to defend the trial results and conclusions. M SD funding o f a trial will be acknowledged in 
publications.
III.Participant Protection
A. Regulatory Authority and Ethics Committee Review (Institutiona lReview Board [IRB ]/Independent Ethics 
Committee [IEC])
All protocols and protocol amendments will be submitted by [CONTACT_88708]/authorization prior to implementation of the trial or amendment, in compliance with local and/or 
national regulations.
The protocol, protocol amendment(s), informed consent form, investigator’s brochure, and other relevant trial 
documents must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_2717]/IEC before being implemented at each site, in compliance 
with local and/or national regulations. Changes to the protocol that are required urgently to eliminate an 
immediate hazard and to protect participant safety may be enacted in anticipation of ethics committee approval.  
MSD will inform regulatory authorities of such new measures to protect participant safety, in compliance with 
local and/or national regulations.
B. Safety
The guiding principle in decision -making in clinical trials is that participant welfare is of primary importance. 
Potential participants will be informed of the risks and benefits of, as well as alternatives to, trial participation. At 
a minimum, trial designs will take into account the local stand ard of care.
All participation in M SD clinical trials is voluntary. Participants enter the trial only after informed consent is 
obtained . Participants may withdraw from a n MSD trial at any time, without any influence on their access to, or 
receipt of, medical care that may otherwise be available to them.
C. Confidentiality
MSD is committed to safeguarding participant confidentiality, to the greatest extent possible. Unless required by 
[CONTACT_2371], only the investigator, Sponso r (or individuals acting on behalf of MSD), ethics committee, and/or regulatory 
authorities will have access to confidential medical records t hat might identify the participant by [CONTACT_2300].
D. Genomic Research
Genomic research will only be conducted in accordance with a protocol and informed consent authorized by [CONTACT_63544] c ommittee.

MK-7264 -042-03 FINAL PROTOCOL 23-NOV -2020
IV. Financial Considerations
A. Payments to Investigators
Clinical trials are time -and labor -intensive. It is M SD’s policy to compensate investigators (or the sponsoring 
institution) in a fair manner for the work performed in support of M SD trials. M SD does not pay incentives to 
enroll participants in its trials. However, when enrollment is particularly challenging, additional payments may b e 
made to compensate for the time spent in extra recruiting efforts.
MSD does not pay for participant referrals. However, M SDmay compensate referring physicians for time spent 
on chart review and medical evaluation to identify potentially eligible partici pants.
B.Clinical Research Funding
Informed consent forms will disclose that the trial is sponsored by M SD,and that the investigator or sponsoring 
institution is being paid or provided a grant for performing the trial. However, the local ethics committee may 
wish to alter the wording of the disclosure statement to be consistent with financial practices at that institution. As 
noted above, all publications resulting from M SD trials will indicate M SD as a source of funding.
C. Funding for Travel and Other R equests
Funding of travel by [CONTACT_19488] (e.g. , to scientific meetings, investigator meetings, etc.) will be 
consistent with local guidelines and practices .
V. Investigator Commitment
Investigators will be expected to review M SD’s Code of Conduct as an appendix to the trial protocol, and in signing the 
protocol, agree to support these et hical and scientific standards .
10.1.2 Financial Disclosure
Financial Disclosure requirements are outlined in the US Food and Drug Administration 
Regulatio ns, Financial Disclosure by [CONTACT_6230] (21 CFR Part 54). It is the 
Sponsor's responsibility to determine, based on these regulations, whether a request for 
Financial Disclosure information is required. It is the investigator's/subinvestigator's
responsibility to comply with any such request.
The investigator/subinvestigator(s) agree, if requested by [CONTACT_19489] 21 
CFR Part 54, to provide his/her financial interests in and/or arrangements with the Sponsor to 
allow for the submi ssion of complete and accurate certification and disclosure statements. 
The investigator/subinvestigator(s) further agree to provide this information on a 
Certification/Disclosure Form, commonly known as a financial disclosure form, provided by 
[CONTACT_1034] . The investigator/subinvestigator(s) also consent to the transmission of this 
information to the Sponsor in the [LOCATION_002] for these purposes. This may involve the 
transmission of information to countries that do not have laws protecting personal data.
10.1.3 Data Protection
Participants will be assigned a unique identifier by [CONTACT_1034]. Any participant records or 
datasets that are transferred to the Sponsor will contain the identifier only; participant names 
or any information that would make the participan t identifiable will not be transferred.

10.3 Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting
10.3.1 Definition of AE
AE definition
•An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally 
associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the 
study intervention.
•NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a study intervention.
•NOTE: For purposes of AE defi nition, study intervention (also referred to as Sponsor’s 
product) includes any pharmaceutical product, biological product, vaccine, diagnostic 
agent, or protocol specified procedure whether investigational or marketed (including 
placebo, active comparator product, or run- in intervention) , manufactured by, licensed 
by, provided by, or distributed by [CONTACT_63553].
Events meeting the AE definition
•Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline ,considered clinically significant in the medical 
and scientific judgment of the investigator.
•Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
•New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even 
though it may have been present before the start of th e study.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention or a concomitant medication.
•For all reports of overdose (whether accide ntal or intentional) with an associated AE, the 
AE term should reflect the clinical symptoms or abnormal test result. An overdose 
without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results is reported using 
the terminology “accidental or inten tional overdose without adverse effect.”
•Any new cancer or progression of existing cancer.

PRODUCT:   MK-7264  102
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:   042 -03  
MK-7264 -042-03 FINAL PROTOCOL 23-NOV -2020
Events NOT meeting the AE d efinition
•Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.
•Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).
•Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not w orsen.
•Surgery planned prior to informed consent to treat a pre -existing condition that has not 
worsened.
•Refe r to Section 8.4.[ADDRESS_859412] medical occurrence that, at any dose:
a.     Results in death
b.     Is life -threatening
    The term “ life-threatening ”in the definition of “serious ”refers to an event in which 
the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.
c.    Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110256]
    Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19357], regardless of length of stay, 
even if the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a precautionary measure for continued observation. 
(Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19358] a pre -existing condition that 
has not worsened is not an SAE. A pre -existing condition is a clinical condition that 
is diagnosed prior to the use of an MSD product and is documented in the 
participant’s medical history. )
d.    Results in persistent or significa nt disability/incapacity
    The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.
    This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplica ted headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza,

and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) that may interfere with or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
e.    Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
In offspri ng of participant taking the product regardless of time to diagnosis.
f.    Other important medical events
    Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63474] 
1 of the other outcomes listed in the above definition . These events should usually be 
considered serious.
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1916], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
10.3.3 Additional Events Reported
Additional events that require reporting
In addition to the above criteria, AEs meeting either of the below criteria, although not 
serious per ICH definition, are reporta ble to the Sponsor.
    Is a cancer
    Is associated with an overdose
10.3.4 Recording AE and SAE
AE and SAE r ecording
    When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to 
the event.
    The investigator will record all relevant AE/SAE information on the AE 
CRFs /worksheets at each examination.
    It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_171087]’s medical 
records to the Sponsor in lieu of completion of the AE CRF page.
    There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_88650]. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant

number, will be blinded on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_19361].
    The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.
Assessment of i ntensity
    An event is defined as “serious ”when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, not when it is rated as severe.
    The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE (and other 
reportable safety event) reported during the study and assign it to 1 of the following 
categories:
-    Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by t he participant, causing minimal discomfort, 
and not interfering with everyday activities (for pediatric studies, awareness of 
symptoms, but easily tolerated).
-    Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort to interfere with normal 
everyday activities (for pediatric studies, definitely acting like something is wrong).
-    Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as 
severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category used for rating the 
intensit y of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe (for pediatric 
studies, extremely distressed or unable to do usual activities).
Assessment of c ausality
•Did the Sponsor ’s product cause the AE?
•The determination of the likelihood that the Sponsor’ s product caused the AE will be 
provided by [CONTACT_19427] a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated 
initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE 
form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed 
document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria below are 
intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a 
relationship between the test product and the AE based upon the available information.
•The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the 
Sponsor ’s product and the AE ; the greater the correlation with the components and 
their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more likely the Sponsor ’s 
product caused the AE:
-Exposure: Is there evidence that the participant was actually exposed to the 
Sponsor ’s product such as: reliable history, acceptable compliance assessment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] 
0882KP

MK-7264 -042-03 FINAL PROTOCOL 23-NOV -2020
count, diary, e tc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of 
drug/metabolite in bodily specimen?
-Time Course: Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the Sponsor ’s product? Is the time of onset of the AE compatible 
with a drug -induced effect (applies to studies with investigational medicinal 
product)?
-Likely Cause: Is the AE not reasonably explained by [CONTACT_19511], other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental factors.
-Dechallenge: Was the Sponsor ’s product discontinued or dose/exposure/frequency 
reduced?
◦If yes, did the AE resolve or improve?
◦If yes, this is a positive dechallenge.
◦If no, this is a negative dechallenge.
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the AE resulted in death or permanent 
disability; (2) the AE resolved/improved despi[INVESTIGATOR_55530] ’s 
product; (3) the study is a single -dose drug study; or (4) Sponsor ’s product(s) is/are 
only used 1 time.)
-Rechallenge: Was the participant re -exposed to the S ponsor ’s product in this study?
◦If yes, did the AE recur or worsen?
◦If yes, this is a positive rechallenge.
◦If no, this is a negative rechallenge.
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the initial AE resulted in death or 
permanent disability, or (2) the study is a single -dose drug study; or (3) Sponsor ’s 
product(s) is/are used only 1 time.)
NOTE: IF A RECHALLENGE IS PLANNED FOR AN AE THAT WAS SERIOUS AND 
MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY [CONTACT_26370] ’S PRODUCT, OR IF RE -EXPOSURE 
TO THE SPONSOR ’S PRODUCT POSE S ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT 
RISK TO THE PARTICIPANT THEN THE RECHALLENGE MUST BE APPROVED IN 
ADVANCE BY [CONTACT_93333], AND IF REQUIRED, THE 
IRB/IEC .
•Consistency with study intervention profile: Is the clinical/pathological presentation of 
the AE consistent with previous knowledge regarding the Sponsor ’s product or drug class 
pharmacology or toxicology?

PRODUCT:   MK-7264  106
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:   042 -03  
MK-7264 -042-03 FINAL PROTOCOL 23-NOV -2020
•The assessment of relationship will be reported on the case report forms/worksheets by 
[CONTACT_19427] a qualified physician according to his/her best clinical judgment, 
including consideration of the above elements.
•Use the following scale of criteria as guidance (not all criteria must be present to be 
indicative of a Sponsor ’s product relationship).
-Yes, there is a reasonable possibility of Sponsor’s product relationship:
◦There is evidence of exposure to the Sponsor ’s product. The temporal sequence 
of the AE onset relative to the administration of the Sponsor ’s product is 
reasonable. The AE is more likely explained b y the Sponsor ’s product than by 
[CONTACT_5748].
-No, there is not a re asonable possibility of Sponsor’ s product relationship:
◦Participant did not receive the Sponsor ’s product OR temporal sequence of the 
AE onset relative to administration of the Sponsor ’s product is not reasonable 
OR the AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_26372]’s 
product. (Also entered for a participant with overdose without an associated 
AE.)
•For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/s he has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.
•There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor. However, it is very important 
that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the 
initial transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor.
•The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up 
information and send an SAE follow -up repor t with the updated causality assessment.
•The causality assessment is 1 of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.
Follow -up of AE and SAE
    The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_19514]/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may 
include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examination s, or 
consultation with other health care professionals.
    New or updated information will be recorded in the CRF.
    The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_859413]:   MK-7264  107

MK-7264 -042-03 FINAL PROTOCOL 23-NOV -2020
10.3.5 Reporting of AE s, SAE s, and Other Reportable Safety Events to the Sponsor
AE, SAE, and o ther reportable safety event reporting to Sponsor via electronic d ata 
collection t ool
    The primary mechanism for reporting to the Sponsor will be the electronic data collection 
(EDC) tool.
-    Electronic reporting procedures can be found in the EDC data entry guidelines (or 
equivalent).
-    If the electronic system is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will use 
the paper AE Reporting form.
-    Reference Section 8.4.1 for reporting time requirements.
    The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes 
available.
    After the study is completed at a given site, the EDC tool will be taken off -line to prevent 
the entry of new data or changes to existing data.
    If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data 
on a previously reported SAE after the EDC tool has been taken off -line, then the site can 
report this informat ion on a paper SAE form or by [CONTACT_756] (see next section).
    Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Investigator Study File Binder (or 
equivalent).
SAE reporting to the Sponsor via paper CRF
    
If the EDC tool is not operational, facsimile transmission or secure e -mail of the SAE 
paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this information to the Sponsor.
    In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by 
[CONTACT_522200] a cceptable with a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by [CONTACT_19515].
    Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete 
and sign the SAE CRF pages within the designated reporting t ime frames.
    Contacts and instructions for SAE reporting and paper reporting procedures can be found 
in the Investigator Study File Binder (or equivalent) .

10.5.1 Definitions
Women of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal 
unless permanently sterile.
Women in the f ollowing categories are not considered WOCBP:
Premenarchal
Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
oDocumented hysterectomy
oDocumented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_35817]: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.
Postmenopausal female
oA postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause.
A high FSH level in the pos tmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or HRT. However,

●Bilateral tubal occlusion
●Vasectomized partner
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is the sole male 
sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. I f not, an additional highly 
effective method of contraception should be used.
●Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of risk associ ated with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual 
abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle 
of the participant.

10.6 Appendix 6: Collection and Management of Specimens for Future Biomedical 
Research
1.  Definitions
a.   Biomarker: A biological molecule found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that is a 
sign of a normal or abnormal process or of a condition or disease. A biomarker may be 
used to see how well the body responds to a treatment for a disease or condition.1
b.   Pharmacogenomics: The investigation of variations of D NA and RNA characteristics as 
related to drug/vaccine response.2
c.   Pharmacogenetics: A subset of pharmacogenomics, pharmacogenetics is the influence of 
variations in DNA sequence on drug/vaccine response.2
d.   DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid.
e.   RNA: Ribo nucleic acid.
2.  Scope of Future Biomedical Research
The specimens consented and/or collected in this study as outlined in Section 8.9 will be used 
in various experiments to understand:
◦The biology of how drugs/vaccines work
◦Biomarkers responsible for how a drug/vaccine enters and is removed by [CONTACT_10489]
◦Other pathways drugs/vaccines may interact with
◦The biology of disease
The specimen(s) may be used for future assay development and/or drug/vaccine 
development.
It is now well recognized that information obtained from studying and testing clinical 
specimens offers unique opportunities to enhance our understanding of how individuals 
respond to drugs/vaccines, enhance our understanding of human disease and ultimately 
improve public health through development of novel treatments targeted to populations with 
the greatest need. All specimens will be used by [CONTACT_642021].
3.  Summary of Procedures for Future Biomedical Research. 
a.   Participants for Enrollment
All participants enrolled in the clinical study will be considered for enrollment in future 
biomedical research.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:   042 -03  
MK-7264 -042-03 FINAL PROTOCOL 23-NOV -2020
b.   Informed Consent
Informed consent for specimens (ie, DNA, RNA, protein, etc.) will be obtained during 
screening for protocol enrollment f rom all participants or legal guardians, at a study visit by 
[CONTACT_90094]. Informed consent for future biomedical research 
should be presented to the participants on the visit designated in the SoA. If delayed, present 
consent a t next possible Participant Visit. Consent forms signed by [CONTACT_642022].
A template of each study site’s approved informed consent will be stored in the Sponsor’s 
clinic al document repository.
c.   eCRF Documentation for Future Biomedical Research Specimens
Documentation of participant consent for future biomedical research will be captured in the 
eCRFs. Any specimens for which such an informed consent cannot be verified will be 
destroyed.
d.   Future Biomedical Research Specimen(s) 
Collection of specimens for future biomedical research will be performed as outlined in the 
SoA. In general, if additional blood specimens are being collected for future biomedical 
research, t hese will usually be obtained at a time when the participant is having blood drawn 
for other study purposes.
4.  Confidential Participant Information for Future Biomedical Research
In order to optimize the research that can be conducted with future biomedi cal research 
specimens, it is critical to link participant' clinical information with future test results. In fact 
little or no research can be conducted without connecting the clinical study data to the 
specimen. The clinical data allow specific analyses to be conducted. Knowing participant 
characteristics like gender, age, medical history and intervention outcomes are critical to 
understanding clinical context of analytical results.
To maintain privacy of information collected from specimens obtained for future biomedical 
research, the Sponsor has developed secure policies and procedures. All specimens will be 
single -coded per ICH E15 guidelines as described below.
At the clinical study site, unique codes will be placed on the future biomedical research 
specimens. This code is a random number which does not contain any personally identifying 
information embedded within it. The link (or key) between participant identifiers and this 
unique code will be held at the study site. No personal identifiers will appe ar on the specimen 
tube.
5.  Biorepository Specimen Usage
Specimens obtained for the Sponsor will be used for analyses using good scientific practices. 
Analyses utilizing the future biomedical research specimens may be performed by [CONTACT_941] 
0882KP
PRODUCT:   MK-7264  114
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:   [ADDRESS_859417] party (eg, a university investigator) designated by [CONTACT_429]. The investigator conducting the analysis will follow the Sponsor’s privacy and 
confidentiality requirements. Any contracted third party analyses will conform to the specific 
scope of analysis outlined in future biomedical research proto coland consent . Future 
biomedical research specimens remaining with the third party after specific analysis is 
performed will be reported to the Sponsor.
6.  Withdrawal From Future Biomedical Research
Participants may withdraw their consent for future biomedical research and ask that their 
biospecimens not be used for future biomedical research. Participants may withdraw consent 
at any time by [CONTACT_111954]. If medical records for the main 
study are still available, the investigator will contact [CONTACT_642023] ([EMAIL_1250]). Subsequently, the participant's 
specimens will be flagged in the bioreposito ry and restricted to main study use only. If 
specimens were collected from study participants specifically for future biomedical research, 
these specimens will be removed from the biorepository and destroyed. Documentation will 
be sent to the investigator confirming withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable. It is the 
responsibility of the investigator to inform the participant of completion of the withdrawal 
and/or destruction, if applicable. Any analyses in progress at the time of request for 
withdrawa l/destruction or already performed prior to the request being received by [CONTACT_642024]. No 
new analyses would be generated after the request is received.
In the event that the m edical records for the main study are no longer available (eg, if the 
investigator is no longer required by [CONTACT_180631]) 
or the specimens have been completely anonymized, there will no longer be a link between 
the participant’s personal information and their specimens. In this situation, the request for 
withdrawal of consent and/or destruction cannot be processed.
7.  Retention of Specimens
Future biomedical research specimens will be stored in the biorepository f or potential 
analysis for up to [ADDRESS_859418]:   MK-7264  115
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:   [ADDRESS_859419] results are accessible only to the 
authorized Sponsor representatives and the designated study administrator research personnel 
and/or collaborators. Database user authentication is highly secure, and is accomplished 
using network security policies and practices based on international standards to protect 
against unauthorized access.
9.  Reporting o f Future Biomedical Research Data to Participants
No information obtained from exploratory laboratory studies will be reported to the 
participant, family, or physicians. Principle reasons not to inform or return results to the 
participant include: Lack of relevance to participant health, limitations of predictive 
capability, and concerns regarding misinterpretation.
If important research findings are discovered, the Sponsor may publish results, present results 
in national meetings, and make results accessib le on a public website in order to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_641987]. Participants will not be identified by [CONTACT_642025].
10. Future Biomedi cal Research Study Population
Every effort will be made to recruit all participants diagnosed and treated on Sponsor clinical 
studies for future biomedical research.
11. Risks Versus Benefits of Future Biomedical Research
For future biomedical research, ri sks to the participant have been minimized and are 
described in the future biomedical research informed consent.
The Sponsor has developed strict security, policies, and procedures to address participant 
data privacy concerns. Data privacy risks are largel y limited to rare situations involving 
possible breach of confidentiality. In this highly unlikely situation, there is risk that the 
information, like all medical information, may be misused.
12. Questions
Any questions related to the future biomedical res earch should be emailed directly to 
[EMAIL_1250].

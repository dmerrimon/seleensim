A.   RESEARCH OBJECTIVES  
Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder characterized by [CONTACT_826969], multiple tender points, 
abnormal pain processing, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and often psychological distress.[ADDRESS_1147246] showed initial promise, no treatment has 
demonstrated convincing effectiveness.  Thus, management is difficult for clinicians.  
Fibromyalgia is common; affecting an estimated 10 million Americans --approximately 3% -5% of the 
general population.

3 The prevalence in Iraq and 
Afghanistan War Veterans has not yet been reported.  If the 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) diagnostic criteria are applied,
[ADDRESS_1147248] gained wider 
use and acceptance. Second, the number of women veterans is expected to comprise over 10%  of the 
total veteran population by 2020.[ADDRESS_1147249] proven benefit, but adherence to exercise is difficult to maintain and can lead to exercise-induced pain and myalgias if performed incorrectly.  While the literature supports psychological treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for reducing the overall symptoms 
of fibromyalgia, access to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_826943]. For relief, patients often turn 
to complementary and alternative medicine when traditional treatments are not effective.
8 Yoga has 
shown initial promise for relief of fibromyalgia symptoms; presumably because yoga combines the benefits of exercise with relaxation and mindfulness practices. However, few yoga studies in fibromyalgia exist and those conducted have involved small sample sizes and yoga has not been 
compared to other treatments. With these challenges and limitations  in mind, research to develop and 
compare different treatments for fibromyalgia, especially in veterans, is urgently needed.  
We believe other treatment options are needed when pharmacological management fails to relieve 
fibromyalgia symptoms for veterans. Our long-term research objective is to develop, test, and implement novel treatments that address barriers to effective fibromyalgia treatment and that can be 
practicably applied in VA care settings. The Pain Outcomes comparing Yoga versus  Structured 
Exercise (POYSE) Trial is a 2-arm parallel group, randomized clinical trial. The POYSE trial will target 
306 veterans with fibromyalgia and will compare the effectiveness of a yoga-based intervention 
(YOGA) with that of a structured exercise program (SEP).  The trial will last 9-months and participants 
will undergo  comprehensive outcome assessments at baseli ne, 1, 3, 6, and 9 months. 
Study Aims: 
1) To compare the interventions’ (YOGA vs. SEP) effects on overall fibromyalgia severity at 
1 month ( early response), 3 months (immediate post-intervention) and at 6 and 9 months 
(sustained effect s) 
2) To compare the interventions’ effects on specific fibromyalgia symptoms (pain, sleep, fatigue), functional impairment, and related outcomes (quality  of life, depression, anxiety ) 
3) To compare the cost -effectiveness of the interventions  
Our primary hypothesis  is that the yoga intervention will be more effective than a structured exercis e 
program in reducing overall fibromyalgia severity as measured by [CONTACT_826970]

fibromyalgia outcomes at all outcome assessment time points (1, 3, 6, and  9 months) compared to

treatments, their  relative cost-effectiveness  will be determined.  
 
B.       BACKGROUND  
B1.   Fibromyalgia is common, costly, and associated with frequent health care use  
Fibromyalgia affects at l east 3% -5% of the general population10 or approximately 10 million Americans.  
In clinical populations, the prevalence of fibromyalgia exceeds 15%.11 Women account for more than 
80% of affected individuals. The economic burden to society from fibromyalgia-related lost productivity and disability is substantial. Sixteen percent of individuals with fibromyalgia reported receiving Social Security disability payments compared to 2.2% of the non-retirement US adult population.
[ADDRESS_1147251] for fibromyalgia claimants was $5,945 versus $2,486 for other beneficiaries.
13 
Patients with fibromyalgia are frequent users of health care resources; comparable to those with diabetes mellitus and hypertension.
[ADDRESS_1147252] 10 outpatient medical 
visits per year.15  When “nontraditional treatments” are considered, this number increases to 
approximately one visit per month.[ADDRESS_1147253] in 1996 dollars was $2,274.[ADDRESS_1147254] 50% of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826944]. Compared with patients with 
other rheumatologic disorders, those with fibromyalgia are more likely to have lifetime surgical 
interventions, including back or neck surgery, appendectomies, carpal tunnel release, gynecologic and abdominal surgeries, and tonsillectomies .
15 
B2. Fibromyalgia is associated with significant morbidity and possibly mortality  
In terms of quality of life, persons with fibromyalgia consistently score low in multiple domains of mental 
and physical functioning, similar to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (C OPD) and 
diabetes.16-[ADDRESS_1147255], 20% -40% of fibromyalgia 
patients have a comorbid depressive disorder.20-[ADDRESS_1147256] suggested that chronic widespread pain and fibromyalgia are associated with 
increased mortality.  When compared to subjects without pain, persons with chronic wides pread pain in 
the community had an increased mortality risk  (mortality rate ratio 1.31; 95% CI, 1.05-2.19) .24  In a 
cohort study from Denmark, Dreyer et al reported an excess mortality risk of 30% (standardized 
mortality ratio 1.3; 95% CI, 0.9-1.7) in those with fibromyalgia.25 Using population mortality rates to 
compare, Wolfe et al also found an excess mortality risk (standardized mortality ratio of 1.45 (95% CI, 
1.19-1.86) ).[ADDRESS_1147257] assessed fibromyalgia prevalence and other symptom -based conditions 
among Gulf War Veterans. Buskila et al.29 found 17% of Gulf War Veterans with soft tissue rheumatism 
also had concomitant fibromyalgia; representing a much higher prevalence than seen in previous 
studies of military populations. In the Iowa Persian Gulf Study, fibromyalgia symptoms were reported by 
18%-24% of Gulf War Veterans relative to 9% -13% of non-deployed personnel.28 Eisen et al3 found that 
a diagnosis of fibromyalgia was  twice as prevalent in deployed vs. non-deployed Gulf War  Veterans. 
4 
v. 10.02. 2014  Study #[PHONE_17250]  Another study examined health care utilization and found that Gulf War Veterans were at an increased 
risk of postwar hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826945].[ADDRESS_1147258] benefits  
Medications for fibromyalgia are largely targeted at its symptoms, especially depression, sleep disturbance and muscle pain. Tricyclic anti -depressants, selective serotonin reuptake  inhibitors (SSRI), 
skeletal muscle relaxant s, analgesics, dual reuptake inhibitors  (SNRIs) , anticonvulsants , and dopamine 
agonists have been used with some success.
1 In 2007, the Federal Drug Administration approved 
Lyric a (pregabalin) as the first medication to treat fibromyalgia.  Cymbalta (duloxetine) was approved in 
2008; and Savella (milnacipran) was approved in 2009. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_826946], only  one-third of patients in most trials who 
receive the active drug achieve a clinically meaningful improvement in their symptoms .32-34 There is 
evidence that fibromyalgia medications  provide short-term (i.e. 8 to 12 weeks) improvements in 
symptoms,32-36 but given the chronic nature of fibromyalgia, more studies are needed to determine 
whether improvements are maintained over months or years . Patients used a mean of 2.7 fibrom yalgia -
related medications;[ADDRESS_1147259] proven efficacy  for fibromyalgia.38-40 Cognitive-
behavior therapy (CBT) is the most evidence-based psychological alternative to traditional medical 
approaches to fibromyalgia management. The benefits of CBT likely stem from its ability to intervene in 
the complex interplay of pathophysiology, cognition, affect, and behavior that is thought to drive pain 
and suffering. While CBT has proven efficacy, it is not yet widely available in many care settings, even in the VA  despi[INVESTIGATOR_826947]. Barriers to implementation are largely 
administrative and systemic and include time constraints, lack of knowledge in cognitive and behavioral 
strategies, and limited availability of specialists to deliver behavioral treatments. Many mental health 
professionals lack experience in applying CBT to medical conditions

[ADDRESS_1147261] all the published exercise trials involved ≥ [ADDRESS_1147262] (or exercise physiologist) with expertise in fibromyalgia.  At adequate intensity, various types of aerobic exercise (e.g. cycling, walking, jogging and pool aerobic exercises) have all been shown to reduce the symptoms of fibromyalgia.
47-[ADDRESS_1147263] likely to experience benefits, both in symptoms and daily function. The major limiting factor to exercise programs is adherence. After the supervised phase of an 
exerc ise program, exercise adherence declines and fibromyalgia symptoms worsen. Commonly cited 
5 
v. 10.02. 2014  Study #[PHONE_17250]  reasons for non-adherence are: time limitations, family commitments, the impact of other comorbidities, 
increased stress and exercise-induced pain or myalgias.                                             
B7.  Other treatments are needed when fibromyalgia symptoms are not relieved 
The lack of relief from existing treatments is frustrating to patients who may feel like they have 
exhausted all options in their fibromyalgia treatment. This is also frustrating for VA providers concerned about the limited efficacy of medications and lack of additional treatment options. Therefore, novel treatment approaches that have potential for application across multipl e VA clinical setti ngs are needed 
to supplement existing services for fibromyalgia care. Increasingly, patients are interested in 
complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM ) treatment options.
[ADDRESS_1147264] minimal physical and emotional risks, and may  allow patients  to take a 
more active role in managing their illness .8  
B8.  Yoga holds promise for fibromyalgia as it combines exercises and mental techniques 
Yoga therapy is defined by [CONTACT_826971][INVESTIGATOR_100207] “the process of 
empowering individuals to progress toward improved health and well -being through the application of 
the philosophy and practice of yoga”.[ADDRESS_1147265] of yoga is 
presumed to be related to the combination of postures, breathing strategies, and relaxation/meditation 
techniques; the combination is believed to be more beneficial than simple exercise alone.54 Because of 
the active mi nd-body component, it is believed that yoga is more effective than traditional exercise.55-57   
B10. Yoga is effective for chronic musculoskeletal pain, especially chronic low back pain 
Williams et al58 conducted a trial to evaluate the effects of Iyengar yoga on chronic low -back pain 
outcomes. The intervention patients attended 90-minute lyengar yoga classes twice a week for 12- 
weeks.  Compared to the usual control arm, the yoga group had significantly greater reductions in functional disability, pain, and depression at weeks 12 and 24, and at 6-months.  There were no 
significant differences in pain medication use between the groups. Groessl et al. examined the benefits 
of 10 weeks of yoga for veterans with chronic lo w-back pain.
59 Sign ificant improvements were found for 
pain depression, energy/fatigue, and mental health. In a recent and relatively large trial (N = 228), Sherman and colleagues ,
60 compared 12 weekly classes of either viniyoga-style yoga (emphasizing 
postures, breathing exercises, and guided deep relaxation) or conventional stretching exercises, or a 
self-care book. At [ADDRESS_1147266] methodologically rigorous study of yoga in fibromyalgia 
was conducted by [CONTACT_826972].61 In this trial, 53 fibromyalgia patients were randomized to an 8-week 
yoga program (gentle poses, meditation, breathing exercises, yoga-based copi[INVESTIGATOR_3931], and 
group discussions) or to wait-list control . At post-treatment, patients assigned to the yoga program 
significantly improved on fibrom yalgia symptoms and functioning, including pain, fatigue, and mood, 
and in pain catastrophizing, acceptance, and other copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262]. In a literature review examining 
the health benefits of yoga vs. exercise, the authors concluded that yoga interventions appeared to be equal or superior to exercise in nearly every outcome measured except those involving physical fitness  
and called for future trials to examine the distinctions between yoga and exercise.
[ADDRESS_1147267]-inter vention study on 58 fibromyalgia 
subjects.64 Seven of the 58 subjects agreed to undergo pressure pain threshold assessment pre- and 
6 
v. 10.02. 2014  Study #[PHONE_17250]  post-intervention. At the end of the study, subjects (n=7) reported significant improvements in the FIQ -
revised total score (-30.7%), pain intensity ( -51.2%) and strength (+21.3%), as well as, a significant 
increase in the pressure pain threshold (+21.3%).64 This study suggests yoga’s effect on pain sensitivity 
and some of the underlying mechanisms of pain relief in fibromyalgi a. 
In a recent meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of meditative movement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Qigong, 
Tai Chi, and Yoga), Langhorst et al.65 found that yoga led to significant improvements in pain, 
fatigue, depression and quality of life. In addition, these treatments are safe leading to minimal 
drop-out rates (3.1%) because of adverse events. The authors called for higher quality studies with larger samples and comparisons of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_826948].
[ADDRESS_1147268] effectively treat fibromyalgia, especially  for veterans’ refractory to 
other treatments. In addition, patients frequently differ in their treatment preferences, and a trial to determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two evidence-based treatment options for fibromyalgia has immense importance. This population of veterans is particularly challenging to VA providers and alternative treatments are critically needed.     
B13. Our prior pain research that infor ms this POYSE trial 
We have performed numerous clinical trials and preliminary studies that demonstrate our team’s experience and expertise in three relevant areas: 1) management of musculoskeletal pain in veterans; 2) conduct of clinical and translational fibromyalgia studies; and 3) design and test of yoga- and 
exercise based interventions in patients with fibromyalgia and other medical conditions.  Cumulatively, this body of research (summarized below) informs the POYSE  trial: 
Stepped Care for Affective Disorders and Musculoskeletal Pain--SCAMP trial : Our National Institute of 
Mental Health funded SCAMP trial  tested antidepressants combi ned with a pain sel f-management 
program delivered by [CONTACT_515706], showed the intervention group (n = 123) experienced large improvements in depression severity (effect size = 1.1) as compared to usual care patients (n = 127) and moderate improvements in pain severity (effect size = 0.5).
66  
Evaluation of Stepped Care for chronic Pain--ESCAPE Trial : We are actively preparing manuscripts for 
the VA RR&D -funded ESCAPE trial. ESCAPE is comparing a combination of pain treatments, including 
algorithm -based analgesics, pain self -management skills, and cognitive behavioral training, versus 
usual care.  The stepped -care intervention is targeting OEF /OIF/OND  veterans with musculoskeletal 
pain of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (low back, neck) and extremities (legs, knees, hips, and shoulders). Recru itment of 
the [ADDRESS_1147269] been published so far.   
The Care Management for the Effective use of Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (CAMEO)  trial was  recently funded by [CONTACT_826973]&D.  We have recruited 55 patients to date. CAMEO is a two arm randomized trial to compare the 
effectiveness of pharmacological vs. behavioral approaches for veterans  with chronic low back pain 
who are currently receiving chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538].  
Chronic widespread pain among returning Gulf War Veterans : In our study of predictors of incide nt 
chronic widespread pain in 602 Gulf War Veterans, 19% developed chronic widespread pain at follow -
up. A positive family history of medically unexplained persistent symptoms [odds ratio (OR ) = 4.8 (2.3, 
13.2)] was strongly associated with chronic widespread pain. At baseline, individuals reporting 
preexisting symptoms of bronchitis [OR=4.9 (1.9, 12.3)] and cognitive dysfunction [OR= 2.1 (1.1, 4.2)] 
were more likely to develop chronic widespread pain. Rather than combat-related exposure, the 
perception of stress during the Gulf War [OR=1.6 (1.1, 2.3)] correlated with chronic widespread pain.67 
7 
v. 10.02. 2014  Study #[PHONE_17250]  A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_826949]-based Motivational Interviewing for Patients with Fibromyalgia tested the 
feasibility and acceptability of a supervised exercise program coupled with telephone-delivered 
motivational interview counseling to promote exercise adherence.[ADDRESS_1147270] Questionnaire, physical impairment and pain improved significantly at 12- and 30- weeks, as did 
the number of exercise minutes per week. The number of exercise minutes was significantly associated 
with reduced physical impairment (r=-0.57 , p=0.01). 
A Randomized Controlled Trial of Exercise-based Motivational Interviewing for Fibromyalgia—For this 
NIAMS-funded trial, 216 patients with fibromyalgia were randomized to 6 motivational interviewing 
sessions (n =107) or an educational control arm consisting of 6 fibromyalgia self-management lessons 
(n = 109).[ADDRESS_1147271] measurements (43.9 (SD=6.3) vs. 24.8 meters (6.3), p=0.03) at follow-up. 
Yoga interventions for caregivers:  We tested an 8-week yoga program with informal (family or friends) 
caregivers.70 Caregivers were randomized to a yoga intervention (n=8) or control group (n=9). Those receiving the 
yoga intervention demonstrated significantly increased lower body strength with trends for improved copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], upper 
body strength,  and aerobic endurance.[ADDRESS_1147272] cancer survivors:  We also studied an 8-week  yoga intervention in [ADDRESS_1147273] cancer 
survivors and found significant increases (compared to the attention control group) in: lower body flexibility; side 
flexibility; lower body strength; and hand grip strength in the yoga group. The yoga group also demonstrated 
improved pain relief, stress reduction, and increased confidence.71 
A Yoga intervention to reduce fear of falling: We completed a yoga study to manage fear of falling in [ADDRESS_1147274] the potential additional benefits of preventing falls.   
Yoga for veterans with stroke: We recently completed VA QUERI -funded pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] [ADDRESS_1147275]-stroke (n= 45) were randomized 3 :[ADDRESS_1147276] control. In within-group analyses, individuals in the yoga arm had significant improvement between baseline and 8 weeks in: pain, balance; range of motion; gait speed; walking endurance; 
balance self-efficacy ; activity and participation; quality of life; and stroke related disability.   
C1. SIGNIFICANCE  AND RELEVANCE TO VHA  PATIENT CARE MISSIO N  
Pain is a critical health problem among veterans. Chronic pain affects 40% -70% of veterans74 and is a leading 
cause of disability, with substantial  impact on millions of veterans’ lives. Pain was the most frequently report ed 
symptom in Persian Gulf War V eterans75 and is expected to be even more prevalent in the current cohort of 
veterans.[ADDRESS_1147277] work productivity and on fibromyalgia patients, in symptom burden, decreased physical 
functioning and perhaps even increased mortality.  
The VA has pi[INVESTIGATOR_826950], such as “Pain as the 5th Vital Sign” initiative77 and the 
VHA National Pain Management Strategy in an effort to address pain among veterans. The VHA National Pain 
Management Strategy was initiated in 1998,[ADDRESS_1147278] addressed this condition in veterans. It is in this context that the 
POYSE trial is proposed.   
8 
v. 10.02. 2014  Study #[PHONE_17250]  
Given the modest effectiveness of current treatments and the burden fibromyalgia p laces on veterans 
and clinicians, our research proposal is significant in several regards. First , the POYSE  trial directly 
addresses a high priority area for the VA and is well aligned with the VHA Pain Management Strategy 
and VHA Pain Management Directive 2009-053.  Second, because previous fibromyalgia studies have 
included more than 90% women, our trial will provide information vital to begin filling an evidence 
vacuum regarding comparative effectiveness of treatments for fibromyalgia, especially men with 
fibromyalgia. Third, POYSE will extend our current understanding of non- pharmacological treatments 
for fibromyalgia. Fourth, the economic evaluation will provide useful  information to VA administrators 
and managers to inform clinical implementation decisions.     
D. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
D1.  Conceptual Model for POYSE  Trial    
The management of fibromyalgia is complex. As a result, specialists such as rehabilitation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], 
orthopedists, anesthesiologists, rheumatologists, and neurologists, are often consulted. This common practice of referring patients with fibromyalgia to specialists with a relatively narrow focus 
compromises the effort to address whole-pers on care that employs a biopsychosocial approach-- an 
approach that seems best suited for rehabilitation settings in the VA.  
The biopsychosocial model posits that the causes and 
outcomes of many illnesses  involve the interaction of 
physical and physiological factors, psychological traits and 
states, and social -environmental factors. Effective pain 
management accounts for these factors. The biopsychosocial model (Figure 1)  is the most widely 
accepted conceptual model in pain medicine.
79  
Comprehensive  management based on the 
biopsychosocial model of pain generation and perception improves outcomes.
80 Such management focuses on the 
interplay among biological, psychological, and social factors that underlie the interventions to be tested and the key outcome domains to be assessed in POYSE.  
Applied to POYSE, the yoga-based intervention and structured exercise program  will not simply address the 
biological or  physical experience of fibromyalgia. Rather, 
POYSE interventions  will be individuall y tailored taking into account how psychological and social 
factors influence function, pain severity, sleep quality, quality of life, and psychological symptoms.        
D2. OVERALL DESIGN   
Our study sample will include 306 veterans with fibromyalgia. Patients from the five primary care clinics  
and rheumatology clinic  at the Roudebush VA Medical Center (RVAMC) and three community based 
outpatient clinics  (Terre Haute, Martinsville, and Bloomington CBOCs)  will be recruited to participate. 
The Pain Outcomes c omparing Yoga vs. Structured Exercise (POYSE) study will be a 2-arm, parallel 
group, randomized comparative effectiveness  trial.  After eligibility determination and informed consent 
procedures, participants will be randomized to one of two study arms. The YOGA arm will invo lve a 
standardized 12-week, yoga-based intervention and will consist of three treatment components: 1) in -
person group yoga taught by a yoga therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]; 2) a relaxation audio recording for home-use; and 3) a 
DVD recording to reinforce concepts taught during in-person sessions. Patients randomized to the 
structured exercise program (SEP) arm will participate in a 12 -week exercise program delivered in a 
group/class format and supervised by a fitness instructor . In addition, SEP patients will  receive a DVD 
(for home use) demonstrating aerobic , strengthening, and stretching exercises for fibromyalgia, a one-
on-one consultation session with the fitness instructor, and supervised exercise sessions for 12 weeks. Figure 2 shows the POYSE trial desi gn.       Figure 1: Biopsychosocial Model  
 
9 
v. 10.02. 2014  Study #[PHONE_17250]  The intervention period will last for 3 months, after which time patients will be followed for an additional 
6 months (total of 9 months). Treatment response will be assessed at 1, 3, 6, and [ADDRESS_1147279] intervention session.   The primary end point will be at 3 months (immediate post-
intervention).  Early response will be assessed at [ADDRESS_1147280] 4 years including 3 months for start-up; 2.5 years for 
recrui tment; 9 months for follow -up; and 6 months for data analysis and manuscripts.  
Figure 2: POYSE Trial Design 
 
D3.   STUDY SITES  
The RVAMC  is an urban, university -affiliated, tertiary  care center in Indianapoli s which provides health 
care for more than 53,000 veterans . As Indiana's tertiary care facility , RVAMC  receives referrals from 
VA facilities at Ft. Wayne and Marion, Indiana, and from nearby [CONTACT_826974], Illinois. The RVAMC  provides 
acute inpatient medical, s urgical, psychiatri c, neurological, and rehabilitation care, as well as  primary 
and specialty  outpatient services. The clinics staff 75 primary care providers (faculty and resident 
physicians; advance practice nurses), caring for over 20,000 patients who make over 65,000 visits per year. The RVAMC is  also the parent facility to three community based outpatient clinics —the 
Bloomington, Terre Haute, and Martinsville Outpatients Clinics. The Bloomington and Terre Haute CBOCs staff 4 primary care providers each and 1 provider is based at Martinsville.  Each site provides 
primary care, prescription and other services to approximately 9,500 veterans in the Bloomington, Terre 
Haute, and Martinsville, IN  metropolitan areas (all sites approximately [ADDRESS_1147281] from Indianapolis).  
D4.   RECRUITMENT  
To plan for recruitment and assess feasibility, we conducted a search of CPRS to determine the number of RVAMC  veterans with a primary or secondary diagnosis of fibromyalgia (ICD-9 729.1). We 
identified 8,[ADDRESS_1147282] found that > 50% 
who meet the initial feasibility criteria also meet our study eligibility requirements, which will give us a potential population of over 4,200 patients from which to recruit 306 participants . Given that we are 
using the 2010 American College of Rheumatology
4 diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia, which is less 
restrictive than the 1990 criteria (i.e. does not require 11 of 18 tender points on examination), we expect 
to achieve our recruitment goals and sample size without much difficulty. In fact, > 60% of the [ADDRESS_1147283] successfully enrolled patients for several moderately sized trials at our medical center. For 
example, in the SCAMP trial we successfully recruited over 65% of participants contact[CONTACT_826975]. In our CRAF T study , 100 (84%) of 119 eligible veterans  who were approached were successfully enrolled. 
In our “Pain as the 5
th Vital Sign” pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], 159 (77%) of 206 participants surveyed expressed a 
willingness to participate in a clinical trial to treat their pain if offered such an opportunity. Based on these prior successes, we anticipate no difficulty meeting our sample size requirements. In terms of Veterans

minorities, thus refl ecting the demographics  of our medical center. In our SCAMP study, Blacks 
comprised 16% of the veteran sample and 13% in ESCAPE.  We do not plan to over -sample Blacks (or 
other minorities) or power sufficiently to explore racial differences in treatment response. The 
racial/ethnic composition of RVAMC and participating CBOCs makes exploring racial differences in 
treatment response impractical unless we employed special efforts to recruit minorities other than 
Blacks. In ESCAPE, we have recruited 12.5% women, but expect an even higher proportion of women 
to participate in POYSE given its focus on fibromyalgia.     
D5a.  Identifying and Enrolling Potential Participants 
Providers will be informed of POYSE  study details and will be asked to provide signed approval so that 
our team may  contact [CONTACT_826976]. The POYSE research 
team, not the providers, will determine eligibility by [CONTACT_199181]/exclusion criteria to potential participants during an “eligibility interview.” In our previous trials, over 95% of physicians  contact[CONTACT_826977]. Potential participants will primarily be identified by [CONTACT_826978]’s electronic medical record system, CPRS  (Computerized Patient Record System), to 
create a master list of veterans who meet the following criteria: 1) fibromyalgia diagnosis (ICD9 code 
729.1); 2) clinic visit in past 2 years; and 3) moderate pain severity (pain severity score ≥ 5 out of 10).  
This list of potential participants will be updated monthly during the enrollment period and a recruit ment 
letter, signed by [CONTACT_30155], will be mailed to qualifying veterans to describe the study. Potential participants will be contact[CONTACT_30781] a week after receipt of the letter to assess eligibility and determine their interest in participating. If the veteran is eligible, an appointment will be scheduled to 
obtain a signed informed consent statement, HIPAA authorization from  and VA consent for use of 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_131227]/or voice those who desire to participate. The baseline interview and assessments will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_826979].  
This method of identifying potential study subjects through CPRS and contact[CONTACT_826980] (which enrolled 200 veterans) and ESCAPE trials (which  enroll ed 242 veterans). A 
second method, if needed, will be in -clinic contact [CONTACT_826981] -referencing the CPRS 
list with the weekly appointment roster for each participating VA provider. A third method is self-referral 
by [CONTACT_826982][INVESTIGATOR_826951] , 
rheumatology, and rehabilitation c linics .    
D5b. Eligibility    
Veterans will be eligible if they have: 1) 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) diagnostic 
criteria (Table 1 below ) for fibromyalgia;4 2) moderate pain severity ( “current” pain severity score ≥ 5 
out of 10); 3) stable doses of fibromyalgia medications for at least 4 weeks; and 4) access to a working telephone. Exclusion criteria will include: 1) severe medical conditions in which exercise is 
contraindicated; 2) active psychosis; 3) schizophrenia; 4) active suicidal ideation; 5) moderate to severe 
cognitive impairment; and 6) involvement in ongoing yoga classes or moderately intense (brisk walking) 
exercise program in the previous 3 months ..  Access to a telephone (home or mobile) is required 
because most of the outcome assessments will be conducted via phone.   
Exclusion criteria will be determined during the baseline eligibility survey conducted by [CONTACT_29452] 
(not the patient’s providers) and are designed to eliminate potential participants for whom the proposed 
interventions are inappropriate or unsafe and/or for whom there may be disincentives for improvement. These include severe medical conditions that may limit participation: (1) significant cardiovascular disease: [LOCATION_001] Heart Association functional class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure; systolic blood pressure ≥ 180 or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 105 mmHg; myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient 
11 
v. 10.02. 2014  Study #[PHONE_17250]  ischemic attack (TIA) within 6 months; chest pain or dizziness with exercise; (2) COPD or asthma 
needing home oxygen; (3) cancer (other than skin cancer) receiving treatment or treatment planned in 
the next 6 months; (4) at least moderately severe cognitive impairment defined by a 6-item  screener.81 
D6. RANDOMIZATION   
Stratified and blocked randomization will be performed.  After providing written-informed consent and completing their baseline interview, participants will be 
randomized to one of two arms : 1) yoga-
based intervention (YOGA) ; or 2) a 
structured exercise program (SEP) . The 
randomization process will be 
directed by [CONTACT_826983], PhD 
(statistician) using statistical software 
with a random-number generator to create a list of group assignments before study recruitment begins. Randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_4321] (men vs. women) and study 
recruitment site (VAMC vs. CBOC).  Within strata, randomization with block sizes of 4 or 6 will 
be executed to ensure balance. Once an eligible participant has been screened, has signed 
informed consent, and has completed the baseline measures the research assistant (Amanda Gerwig) or project coordinator (Christy Sargent) will submit a request to randomize the eligible 
participant. The randomization program locates the first unassigned record in the randomization 
list and assigns the participant to the group designated in that record. The participant identifier 
and date are written to the record. To ensure allocation concealment, only [CONTACT_827002] and [CONTACT_810741] will have access to the randomization table, but will not conduct outcome assessments.  
[CONTACT_20266]  will remain blinded to group assignment. No one will be allowed access to the folder of 
the randomization assignment until all baseline measures have been completed. 
D7. POYSE INTERVENTION DETAILS  
The POYSE interventions will last [ADDRESS_1147286] three 
types of treatment effects: 1) “early response” (at 1 month) ; 2) immediate post-intervention benefits 
at 3 months ; and 3) sustained benefits at [ADDRESS_1147287]-randomization ([ADDRESS_1147288]-
intervention).  
D7a. Overview of Yoga-based intervention  
The yoga intervention (Appendix 1)  will consist of three treatment components: 1) in -person group 
yoga sessions taught by a  yoga therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]; 2) a relaxation audio recording for home-use; and 3) a DVD 
recording to reinforce concepts taught during in- person yoga sessions. The yoga intervention will 
complement standard medical treatments for fibromyalgia.  It will involve [ADDRESS_1147289] (YT), who has over [ADDRESS_1147290] significantly from the Sivananda  tradition. She has also 
received veteran-specific yoga training in a program called “Warriors at Ease.” [CONTACT_827003] will be the lead yoga therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], but will train and supervise other yoga therapi[INVESTIGATOR_826952].   
The yoga intervention is designed to improve functioning, pain, fatigue, sleep problems, and 
psychological distress common to patients with fibromyalgia. The intervention will include exercises or physical activity that includes postures ( asanas ), diaphragmatic breathing ( pranayama), 
relaxation/meditation practices ( dhyanas ), and discussions sessions between [CONTACT_827003] and group Table 1. 2010 ACR Fibromyalgia Diagnostic Criteria  
A patient satisfies diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia if the 
following 3 conditions are met: 
 
1. Widespread Pain Index (WPI) ≥ 7 and Symptom 
Severity Scale (SS) ≥ 5 OR WPI 3-6 and SS ≥ [ADDRESS_1147291] a disorder that would 
otherwise explain the pain

To standardize delivery and facilitate reproducibility of the yoga intervention, we detail the content and general 
structure of each class (Table 2)  which w ill be followed by [CONTACT_18854]. Schalk, YT. Procedures to assure fidelity  to the 
yoga intervention will be used similar to those employed in our other trials. Briefly, steps will include:  (1 ) 
extensive yoga therapi[INVESTIGATOR_826954]. Schalk during start -up; (2) observation of [CONTACT_827003] 
administering yoga sessions for at least one full wave (12 sessions)  feedback provided by [CONTACT_18854]. Schalk after review 
of several sessions  and periodic  meetings to discuss fidelity.   
D7b. Yoga intervention site, schedule of sessions, and group size 
The in-person group yoga sessions will be held at the Rehabilitation and Integrative Therapy Lab (RIT 
Lab, in Coleman Hall on the Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis campus, School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences. The RIT lab is less than a 10 minute walk from  the RVAMC. The 
12 weekly sessions  will include 8 to 12 participants; a group size we found optimal during our pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480].
[ADDRESS_1147292] 15-19 groups (of 8-12 participants) to 
complete the yoga intervention. Attendance will be recorded to assess adherence to yoga. 
D7c. Yoga intervention components, sequence, and progression 
The 12-week yoga interv ention (Table 2) developed and previously tested by [CONTACT_6283]. Schmid and Van 
Puymbroeck and Ms. Schalk72 will be modified for veterans with fibromyalgia. For example, [CONTACT_827003] 
will emphasize “gentle practice” of yoga exercise when veterans are challenged by [CONTACT_826984]. The yoga exercises will be delivered in a standardized sequence and 
progression, as delivered in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_826955]. The yoga poses or asanas  will 
consist of a single sequence that can be performed supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], seated, on hands and knees, prone, and standing. Similar to other rehabilitation interventions, our yoga intervention will progressively become 
more challenging for participants over the [ADDRESS_1147293] of five poses that involve “breathing with movement” (head moves, scapula, and directions  of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], pi[INVESTIGATOR_826956]).  Additional poses will include: “table,” “cat cow,” “sunbird,” “downward dog,” “cobra,” “locust,” and “bridge.” [CONTACT_827003] will encourage the safe performance of physical poses and tailor 
them to participants’ needs and abilities. For patients with fibromyalgia, poses will avoid the extremes of 
range of motion. All sessions will end with a yoga nidra (“yogic sleep”) exercise to develop both deep 
relaxation and full alertness .  
Deep breathing exercises will be taught and emphasized throughout every session. “Connecting with the breath” is a common theme in yoga and is combined with the poses (“breathing with movement”) to facilitate yoga practice.  An effective breathing technique (alternate nostril breathing)  will be taught to 
participants.  All yoga sessions will include at least 10 minutes of relaxation, using progressive 
relaxation techniques. The relaxation component will be completed lying supi[INVESTIGATOR_826957]. The relaxation is  based on resting the “physical body.”  
Participants will be encouraged to exercise according to their limits, rather than rigid adherence to posture techniques. The yoga intervention will be tailored to the individual. It will include low intensity, 
low impact modified poses adapted with pathophysiologic changes of fibromyalgia in mind.
82 For 
example, and repetitive muscle movements will be minimized to reduce the potential for muscle micro-
trauma theorized to occur in fibromyalgia patients.  In addition, [CONTACT_827003] will encourage slow 
transitions from lying to standing to minimize dizziness and lightheadedness related to autonomic nervous system changes associated with fibromyalgia.  Peripheral pain generators such as knee osteoarthritis, back pain, and carpal tunnel symptoms will be minimized by [CONTACT_826985]. Previous studies that involved high intensity, repetitive 
exercises reported high rates of attrition or worsening fibromyalgia symptoms.
62, 82, 83 Tailoring of poses 
in POYSE is expected to yield lower attrition rates. 
13 
v. 10.02. 2014  Study #[PHONE_17250]  A proposed detailed schedule of the 12 yoga sessions and each session’s content is found in Append 
 
D7d. Yoga intervention: relaxation audio recording 
From our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732], a relaxation audio recordi ng was professionally developed and produced for 
participants. The recording features [CONTACT_827003] guiding a physical body relaxation exercise and is 
placed onto Playaway devices ( www.playaway.com ); an inexpensiv e (~$20) portable audio player. The 
Playaway device only holds the guided relaxation exercise and cannot be recorded over. It is easy to 
use, has simple directions, and works with minimal buttons, i.e. ‘power’ and ‘play’. All participants 
randomized to the yoga arm will be issued a Playaway device and will be asked to listen to it three 
times a week to reinforce in-person yoga session content. Because the device records and times 
whether or not the device is used, this feature will help assess adherence to the yoga 
intervention and home use.  We will record the date and time in minutes that audio recording is used 
at each session.  Use of yoga will be tracked for the entire [ADDRESS_1147294] information. 
D7e. Yoga intervention: DVD recording 
All participants in the yoga arm will receive a DVD and an illustrated handbook to complement the audio recording. Similar to our audio- recording, the DVD will be professionally developed and highlight 
[CONTACT_827003] moving from start to finish through the yoga intervention. These DVDs will be given to 
participants at the beginning of the intervention and help participants apply yoga practices to daily life 
during the intervention period. Participants will be encouraged to practice at home for [ADDRESS_1147295] time spent in yoga practice on a form  (Appendix 5). These forms will be collected 
during the weekly sessions. To boost retention and adherence, POYSE study personnel will contact [CONTACT_23065]’ who miss a session to problem -solve regarding attendance barriers and or to address home 
practice barriers (if average practice < 20 minutes per home session).  
D7f. Overview of structured exercise program group sessions  
The group exercise sessions will also be held at the RIT lab in Coleman Hall on campus. 
Participants will undergo a graded aerobic exercise program; the preferred exercise p rescription to 
reduce the possibility of exercise-induced pain.48, 84-[ADDRESS_1147296] for a short period of time, with gradual increases in exercise intensity and duration. Participants will 
start exercising at a slow pace for 5 minutes to warm -up.  For each 5-minute phase (total of 30 to 35 
minutes total per session), the exercise intensity will be gradually increased to the mid-range of their exercise prescription.  
During the first exercise session, the fitness instructor will provide an introduction and overview of the exercise program.  Veterans will also receive instructions on how to use the heart rate monitor, 
pedometer, and how to rate their perceived exercise exertion according to the Borg scale.  In addition, 
veterans will learn how to keep an activity diary at home and how to select physical activities and exercises based on heart rate, perceived exertion, or metabolic energy costs. Further, subjects will 
have their blood pressure and heart rate monitored during all sessions.  Subjects will be asked to report 
any cardiovascular symptoms such as shortness of breath or chest pain while exercising.  If a subject 
experiences any cardiovascular symptoms or an unsafe blood pressure or heart rate the instructor w ill 
cal an ambulance to transport the subject to the VA ER for immediate medical assessment. 
Exercise s essions with other participants and the fitness instructor will last approximately 75 minutes 
and occur once a week for 12 weeks; the same session schedule and duration as the yoga arm. The 
fitness instructor will teach participants to use a table-top ergometer at a sub-maximal level, determine 
baseline fitness, and develop an individualized exercise prescription. The fitness instructor will provide 
educational tips on exercise and selection of physical activities.  The instructions will be informed by 
[CONTACT_23065]’ heart rate (at baseline and at different exercise levels), their ratings of perceived exertion, and metabolic activity (METS). While we will employ  individualized exercise prescriptions for veterans 
14 
v. 10.02. 2014  Study #[PHONE_17250]  randomized to the structured exercise program (SEP) arm, the SEP will be delivered in a group/class 
format to control for the potential benefits of social interactions  and attention across treatment arms.   
D7g. Exercise ergometer starting point, perceived exertion, and metabolic activity  
In general, participants will start exercising with the ergometer at a power of 30 watts for 5 minutes, followed by [CONTACT_615079] 15 watts every 5 minutes until veterans reach their sub-maximum target heart rate [(220 − age) × 0.85].  After each 5-minute phase, heart rate, blood pressure, and a rating of 
perceived exertion will be recorded. To obtain ratings of perceived exertion, veterans will be evaluated according to  the Borg Scale,
87 which ranks exertion ordinally ( “very, very light” to “very, very hard”).  
These terms are assigned a number from [ADDRESS_1147297] will be 
stopped at a score of 17 (“very hard”). We want participants  to exercise with the ergometer at a level 
associated with a perceived exertion of 12 on the Borg Scale, i.e. the level below “somewhat hard” for the prescribed duration while wearing a heart rate monitor. This level is consistent with light-to-moderate exercise recommended in the fibromyalgia literature.
48, 84-86 
Combining perceived exertion with the structured exercise program  allows veterans  to better gauge 
their “comfort zone” and select physical activities based on how they feel on any given day. Heart  rate 
monitoring provides useful information for our fitness instructor and veterans to set their exercise intensity based on different levels of exercise. Energy output data from the sub-maximal test will be 
converted to equivalent energy costs in metabolic activity (METS).  The METS will then be 
benchmarked for a wide variety of recreational and occupational activities  relevant to the veteran. 
D7h. Schedule and content of weekly exercise sessions  
In addition to the schedule of supervised group exercise s essions  as shown in Appendix B, veterans 
will be asked to exercise independently a minimum of two or three times per week during the 12-week intervention period. To track the extent of home exercise and activities, we will ask participants to 
fill out and bring their tracking diary to each exercise session. The exercise intensity will be 
modified during sessions according to how the veteran reacts to exercise. The intensity and duration of 
each exercise session will be gradually increased as tolerated and as the veteran’s fitness level 
changes. At each weekly session, veterans will report the number of times and the total minutes 
exercised. The self-report of at home exercise activity will be confirmed with pedometer readings, i.e. 
step counts.  After the [ADDRESS_1147298] session, participants will receive a brief educational message each week from the fitness instructor. After soliciting what exercise activities veterans are willing to do, the fitness instructor will teach ways to incorporate physical activities in veterans’ daily life.  Participants will also learn their typi[INVESTIGATOR_826958], rating of perceived energy, and metabolic energy cost associated with each activity 
and provide a record of their weekly activities using an activity diary and step count assessed from their 
pedometer. The importance of regular physical  activity for improved health and adherence to the 
individualized exercise prescription will be emphasized at each session. For “homework”, veterans will be asked to choose a physical activity to do before the next session. Educational messages will be reinforced with a professionally produced exercise DVD to view at home. The exercise DVD will contain 
instructions to modify participants’ exercise in case of a flare of their fibromyalgia and to be progressive (chair work to standing) in terms of intensity and duration depending on their baseline exercise prescription. Attendance at the exercise group sessions will be recorded. 
D7i. Plans to manage exercise-induced pain and injury  
Strenuous exercise, especially if done too vigorously, can exacerbate fibromyalgia symptoms and 
adversely affect exercise adherence.88 Exercise-induced pain is postulated to be caused by [CONTACT_826986], leading to micro-trauma or tendonitis89-91 or to “central 
sensitization” (amplification of sensory  processing within the brain)92-95 resulting in an exacerbation of 
symptoms. Patients who suffer from exercise-induced pain often do not follow through with an exercise 
15 
v. 10.02. 2014  Study #[PHONE_17250]  program; consequently, affecting adherence and clinical outcomes.  To improve adherence and clinical 
outcomes, exercise prescriptions should be individualized based on patient’s baseline severity of pain 
and fatigue, and tolerance to exercise-induced pain.82,88  
To minimize musc le micro -trauma and e xercise -induced muscle soreness, we will employ the following 
safety precautions:  
1. Participants  will be advised not to exceed the prescribed exercise (frequency, intensity, or 
duration) during a “good day .” 
2. Participants  will be forewarned that even exercise performed at the appropriate 
intensity  might result in short-term  increases in exercise-induced pain and fatigue that should 
dissipate within a few  days  (up to 2 weeks). 
3. Participants will be allowed to self-adjust their exercise intensity, especially during a flare. 
4. Participants who develop intolerable exercise-induced pain (or fatigue) will be instructed to avoid 
exercise for 48 hours, then restart the program at 5% below the previous exercise intensity (e.g., 
from 55% to 50%) for one week, and maintain the same exercise duration for one week, thereafter.  
Then resume the previous exercise intensity (e.g. 50% back up to 55%), and continue on with the 
original exercise prescription.     
5. Shoul d a participant develop an increase in regional body pain (e.g., foot or ankle pain) as a result 
of the aerobic exercise, they will be asked to do the following:  
a. RICE : Rest, Ice, Compression of injured tissue, and Elevation during the first 24 hours,  
b. Switch to a different type of exercise (e.g., from brisk walking to bicycling or from weight 
bearing to non-wei ght bearing exercise).   
6. In the event that participants are unable to exercise for > 2 weeks, they will be instructed to resume 
their exercise at 65% of their previous exercise duration (in minutes) and 5% below the previous exercise intensity. If they fail to exercise for < 2 weeks, they will restart at the level (i.e. duration and 
intensity) from where they left. Then, they will follow the original recommendation of gradually 
increasing the exercise duration (in minutes) each week and the exercise intensity each month.  
D7j. Co-interventions  
Participants will continue to be followed by [CONTACT_191499]/providers  for all medical care 
unrelated to the trial. This includes continuation of other medications as prescribed, clinic visits, and other care as usual. Specifically, use of medications , and specialist consultations (rehabilitation , pain 
management, and rheumatology) for fibromyalgia will be permitted (and assessed), both to adjust for 
co-intervention differences between arms in the analyses and to assess as secondary outcomes.  
D8. DATA COLLECTION PROT OCOL  
The schedule of outcomes and key variables to evaluate the effectiveness of the POYSE  interventions 
are listed in Table 3. After obtaining informed consent (Appendix 3), a research assis tant will 
administer a baseline assessment to gather socio-demographic data, body mass index, review the 
patient’s history emphasizing previous  treatments tried for their fibromyalgia, and administer several 
validated measures to assess fibromyalgia related symptoms, function , pain, and psychological status. 
The data collection protocol is informed by [CONTACT_826987] 
(OMERACT) recommendations,
[ADDRESS_1147299] used a battery of measures of similar length in 
16 
v. 10.02. 2014  Study #[PHONE_17250]  several previous or current trials without over -burdening patients. All measures have been conducted 
both in person and by [CONTACT_826988]. Both types of administration have routinely been 
approved by [CONTACT_826989].  
If participants cannot be scheduled for an in-person interv iew or  reached by [CONTACT_826990]: (1) send a mailed questionnaire to the veteran with postage paid, self-addressed envelope to our office; and 2) conduct a face-to-face interview in conjunction with the patient’s clinic visit. Veterans occasionally lack transportation to the in-person 
interviews. In this situation, we have previously arranged taxi cab rides to and from our VA.  
To protect against data loss, participant responses are collected in two formats: paper and electronic. The interviews and study databases will be designed in Microsoft Access by [CONTACT_125699]. Jeff Barnd, MS, one of our Center’s data manager s. To maintain confidentiality of veterans interviewed, our research assistant 
will adhere to careful interview and data collection procedures. First, participants will be told that their responses will remain confidential and that every effort will be made to fulfill that assurance. Second, 
the interviews will be conducted in an appropriate setting (i.e., private interview room). Third, completed 
surveys will be stored in a secure location in our Center in a locked file cabinet.   
D8a.  Primary Outcome Measure 
The primary outcome measure will be the Total Score from the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnair e 
Revised (FIQR).  The FIQR (Appendix 4)  has been found to be a useful brief instrument to assess the 
overall impact and severity of fibromyalgia.[ADDRESS_1147300] Questionnaire (FIQ) which has been extensively used and validated in clinical trials. The FIQR consists of 21-items that assess pain, fatigue, stiffness, sleep, depression, memory, anxiety, balance, and environment sensitivity.
9,[ADDRESS_1147301] 7 days and are 
scored on a n 11-point numeric rating scores  of 0 to 10, with 10 being “worst.” The total score range 
from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing greater s ymptom  burden and functional limitations from 
fibromyalgia. The FIQR has strong internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.79 to 0.93) and is comparable to the original FIQ allowing comparisons between the FIQ and FIQR.
100  In addition to the 
Total Score, the FIQR contains scales for Symptoms (10 items), Function (9 items), and Overall Impact 
(2 items); the most important domains in fibromyalgia trials. Scoring of the FIQR involves: 1) summing 
the score for function (range 0 to 90) and dividing by 3; 2) summing the score for overall impact (range 
0 to 20); and 3) summing the score for symptoms (range 0 to 100) and diving by 2.  The three domains are weighted; 30% of total score ascribed to function, 50% to symptoms; and 20% for overall impact.    
D8b.  
Measures, Schedule, and Mode of Administration 
In addition to our main outcome measure (FIQR Total Score) , we wil l also measure several other 
secondary outcomes recommended by [CONTACT_826991]97,[ADDRESS_1147302] psychometric characteristics.  
Baseline patient characteristics will be evaluated with an interview adapted from our previous pain and 
fibromyalgia trials and will include socio -demographics, disability compensation, comorbid medical and 
psychiatric disorders, and prior treatments for fibromyalgia. We will also regularly assess use of other treatments for fibromyalgia (other medications, exercise, physical therapy, complementary and 
alternative medicine modalities, and interventional modalities)  as well as prescription medication use. 
For medications, we will record prescribed doses, administration schedule, and number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_196844] , especially opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467], antidepressants , and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651].

Fibromyalgia symptom severity  will be assessed  with the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire 
Revised (FIQR).9    
17 
v. 10.02. 2014  Study #[PHONE_17250]  Pain-severity : The Brief Pain Inventory  is an 11-item, multidimensional pain measurement tool with 
demonstrated reliability in patients with arthritis as well as other pain cond itions.102,103 The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_826959], physical activity, work, social activity,

Psychological symptoms are frequently associated with fibromyal gia and will be assessed by:  
[CONTACT_826992] -[ADDRESS_1147303] validated the PHQ -9 as a 
diagnostic measure with excellent psychometric properties.104 Internal consistency has consistently 
been shown to be high (Cronbach's alpha > 0.80) and test-retest assessment showed the PHQ -9 to be 
a responsive and reliable measure of depression treatment outcomes. 
The GAD -7 has demonstrated reliability (alpha = 0.89) and validity (criterion, construct, factorial, and 
procedural) as a measure of anxiety in the general population and primary care.105  
The Primary Care PTSD Screen (PC -PTSD) has been validated for use in VA primary care settings .106 
The sum of the 4 yes/no items yields a score ranging from 0 to 4, with scores ≥ 3 cons idered positive

The Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Questionnaire ( SF-12) is the criterion standard for generic 
functional status and health-related quality of life.108 The SF-12 assesses physical and mental 
functioning in 8 domains and gives reliable, valid and responsive summary scores.108      
The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) will be used to assess fatigue.109 The MFI assesses 
clinical fatigue in 5 dimensions: general fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, reduced motivation, 
and reduced activity. The MFI has been validated among adults with chronic illnes s, chronic fatigue 
syndrome, and cancer, as well as among healthy adults.110  
Sleep problems will be assessed using the MOS Sleep Scale which assesses sleep disturbance, 
adequacy of sleep, and sleep quantity. The MOS -Sleep Scale has demonstrated good psychometric 
properties  in trials assessing pain.111   
The Pain Catastrophizing Scale a 13-item scale that assesses catastr ophizing—a pain belief that has  
been found to be strong predictor of poor treatment response.[ADDRESS_1147306] found strong evidence of criterion-related, concurrent, and discriminant validity.112

on a scale ranging from 1 (very uncertain) to 10 (very certain).   
The Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) is a single item measure to assess overall clinical 
response. This validated and reliable global rating scale is often used as the gold standard for 
determining clinically important differences in outcomes115,116 and required by [CONTACT_826993]. The PGIC asks subjects to rate overall improvement in sympt oms 
using a single 7-point scale anchored by “very much improved” and “very much worsened”. 
The Rapid Assessment of Physical Acitivity (RAPA) is a 7 item measure of physical activity for use with 
older adults.  
The Activity Constraints  is a 20-item measure which assessing seven different types of constraints on a 
5-point Likert scale.  
The Activities – Specific Balance Confidence Scale is a 16- item scale to assess a subject’s balance 
confidence in performing several activities.  
The SOC -3 (3-item Sense of Coherence scale) will be used to measure the 3 dimensions salient to 
resilience and coherence including manageability, meaningfulness and comprehensibility.  
Substance use problems will be assessed by [CONTACT_826994]’ prescription 
drugs or street drugs.  
The EXPECT Questionnaire is a 26-item measure assessing the perceived expectations of the subject 
for the intervention.   
A Functional Ass essment will consist of monitoring blood pressure, pulse, six minute walk, gait 
analysis, chair sit and reach test, back scratch test, chair stand test and the Fullerton Advanced 
Balance Scale. 
Health Care Utilization and Costs: will be assessed at the end of the 9 month study period for each 
patient using data available in CPRS. This will include all outpatient, rehabilitation, and emergency 
room visits, inpatient days , x-ray and lab tests, medical and surgical consultations, and medications.   
D9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
POYSE will involve a 2-arm, parallel group, randomized comparative effectiveness trial. Since 
participants cannot be blinded to treatment assi gnment, observed outcomes (if positive) could be 
affected by  [CONTACT_826995]. To account for this potential bias, we will assess treatment expectations at 
baseline and account for expectations in our analyses. We will randomize at the patient rather than the 
provider level for two reasons: (1) randomization at patient level saves sample size; and (2) patients 
from the same provider in the two arms will adjust for “provider  effect.” Contamination will also be low 
because there is relatively minimal involvement required of VA providers in POYSE.  In addition, randomization will be stratified by  [CONTACT_4321] ( women or men)  and study recruitment site (VAMC or  CBOC) 
to avoid potential imbalance of these factor s between the two arms. [CONTACT_20266], PhD (statistician) will create 
a randomization chart to randomize patients in blocks of 4 or 6. 
D9a. Sample size 
Our sample size is calculated based on estimated differences of intervention effects between two arms 
on the primary outcome; Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire Revised (FIQR) total score at 3 months . 
The FIQR  total score is a continuous measure: a 0-100 scale and reflects the average of three 
domains: function, overall impact, and symptoms. In a recently published yoga trial for patients with 
fibromyalgia, Carson et al.61 found a pre-treatment FIQR score of 48.3 (standard deviation = 17.5).  
Post-treatment scores were reduced by 31% (FIQR = 35.5, SD = 17.6, effect size = 0.72) from the yoga 
intervention. In an earlier trial, Mannerkopi [CONTACT_2297].118 tested an intervention combining pool exercises with 
20 
v. 10.02. 2014  Study #[PHONE_17250]  cognitive behavioral relaxation techniques and found a 13.6% reduction in FIQR scores. From these 
studies, we estimate the difference between the yoga and structured exercise group is 17%. A 
between-group treatment difference of 14% reduction in symptoms represents a minimum clinically 
meaningful intervention effect.119 To be conservative, we will assume a 14% difference between 
treatment groups. The absolute score difference at 3 months is estimated to be approximately 7 points (6.79, 14% of 48.3). Assuming a common standard deviation of 17.[ADDRESS_1147308] such a difference with >80% power and 5% Type I standard error rate.  
We recognize the correlation of outcomes from subjects within the same yoga or exercise class 
may reduce the effective sample size compared to the same sample with independent 
observations.  This possible “clustering effect” seen in group delivered interventions has 
implications for  power. We have no preliminary data to estimate the intra-cluster  correlation 
(ICC)  for participants within the same group. However, based on similarly designed published 
studies, we expect the ICC to be relatively small and balanced across the two  treatment arms 
since the cluster sizes will be similar.
120 Conservatively, we assume an IC C of 0.02 for both 
treatment groups. With 8 subjects per treatment  group/class or cluster, the design effect is 1+ 
(8-1) ×0.02 =1.14. Therefore, we will inflate our sample size by 14% to accommodate the 
potential clustering effects . We then need 122 evaluable subjects in each arm. With a 
conservative 20% attrition, we will then need (122*2)/0.80 = 306 subjects (153 in each arm).   
D9b. Data analysis: Baseline characteristics of POYSE sample  
We will examine baseline characteristics  (socio -demographic variables, medical and psyc hiatric 
comorbidity, duration of fibromyalgia, and current and prior pain treatments) of the POYSE sample.  To 
evaluate the representativeness of study enrollees among all eligible patients, we will compare the enrollees and those who decline enrollment on their demographic characteristics.  If there are 
systematic differences, these will be considered in the interpretation of the results of subsequent 
analyses. We will also examine differences in baseline characteristics between patients who remain in 
the study and those who dropout. Two -factor ANOVA models which include dropout status, treatment 
group (YOGA vs. SEP) and their interaction will be used for continuous variables.  Logistic regression 
models with the same terms will be used for dichotomous vari ables.  
D9c. Main a nalysis of the primary outcome (FIQR total score)  
Our main analysis will employ a repeated measurement analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model 
which is more powerful than two-sample t -test when the baseline outcome measurement is 
positively correlated with post baseline outcome.121 We plan an intent-to-treat analysis approach 
with the primary endpoint at 3 months and evaluation of “early” response at 1 month and “sustained” response at [ADDRESS_1147309]-intervention. We will summarize this primary 
outcome at each time point (baseline, 1, 3, 6 , and 9 months) for both arms. The difference 
between time points will be compared.  
Since the primary outcome (FIQR total score) is measured repeatedly at baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 9 
months, we will fit  a repeated measurement analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the 
four post baseline (1, 3, 6, and 9 months) FIQR total score as the response variables. The main predictors will be group (treatment arm), time (categorical), and their interaction. The model will 
be adjusted for baseline FIQR score. A random intercept will be used to adjust for the patient effect and to accommodate the correlation among the repeated measurements from the same patients. Another random intercept will be used to adjust for the potential clustering effect for 
patients in a specific yoga or exercise group. The primary analysis will evaluate the difference in 
FIQR score  between the two treatment arms at 3-months (the primary end point) using 
appropriate contrast in this model. The sustained effect of intervention will be evaluated using appropriate contrast for the difference in FIQR change from 3-month to 6-month in this model. 
D9d. Secondary analysis of  primary outcome 
21 
v. 10.02. 2014  Study #[PHONE_17250]  For the FIQR total score, we will also define the patients  with more than 30% reduction as 
“responders.” We will then compare the probability of responders between treatment arms using a 
generalized linear mixed model with a logit link. The responding status of each patient at 1, 3, 6, and 9 months will be used as the outcome variables. Main predictors are group (treatment arm), time ( 1, 3, 6, 
and 9 months ), and their interaction. A significant coefficient of group indicates a significant odds ratio 
of being a responder between the tw o arms at each time point. Eac h of the three domains of the FIQR 
score will be analyzed in the similar way to the total score.  
 
 
D9e. Analysis of secondary outcomes 
Since POYSE is not specifically powered for the secondary outcome, these results should be 
interpreted cautiously unless they are highly significant (p < .001) . Pain severity as assessed by [CONTACT_826996] a repeated measurement ANCOVA model in the same way 
as the FIQR total score. BPI [INVESTIGATOR_826961] 1, 3, 6, and 9 months will be used as the r esponse 
variable. Main predictors will be intervention group, time (categorical), and their interaction adjusted for 
the ba seline BPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005]. A random intercept of subject effect will be used to accommodate correlation 
within subject. Another random intercept of either a specific yoga or exercise group will be used to 
accom modate correlation within group (clustering effect for group delivered intervention).    
Psychological symptoms: PHQ -[ADDRESS_1147310] as the FIQR total score with repeated outcomes at 1, 3, 6, and 9 
months as the response variables , the same set of main predictors and adjusted for  baseline outcome 
measurement. The PTSD screening status will be analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model with a logit link. The main predictors will be intervention group, time (categorical) and their interaction 
adjusted for baseline PTSD s creening status. PTSD severity  from PTSD checklist for military will be 
analyzed similarly . 
Other secondary outcome measures: The analytical strategy for other outcomes will be similar to the 
FIQR total score. These outcomes include SF-36, MFI, MOS Sleep Scale, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, 
Arthritis Self -Efficacy Scale, and PGIC. 
We will employ several  secondary analyses to assess the effectiveness of the treatment arms 
compared to each other in improving:  
• Individual fibromyalgia symptoms (pain, fatigue, sleep quality, function)  
• Health-related quality of life  
• Patient global impression of change  
• Pain bel iefs and self-efficacy  
Analytic techniques will be similar to those previously described. Since there will be a number of 
secondary outcomes, we will account for  multiple-comparisons in analyses. We will use the Bonferroni 
approach to adjust for statistical significance threshold when the number of tests is less than 20. Otherwise, we will use the false discovery rate (FDR)
122 to control the magnitude of false positives. We 
will also stratify our analysis based on a baseline depression status (PHQ -9).  Our previous research 
indicated that 30% to 40% of patients will have clinically significant depression, which may adversely affect pain outcomes. Thus, depression is a potential moderator.    
D9f. Missing data 
Missing data are unavoidable in longitudinal studies. Based on our prior studies, we anticipate a possibl e dropout rate between 8% and 12% . However, we conservatively estimated a possible 20% 
drop out rate which is reflected in the sample size calculation. We will first run a logistic model with 
missing status as the response variable, intervention arm, patients’ demographic characteristics as 
covariates to check whether the missing status depends on the intervention group assignment and 
patient characteristics. Second, our linear mixed-effect model can accommodate missing-at-random ( or 
22 
v. 10.02. 2014  Study #[PHONE_17250]  MAR  which is assumed in many trials )123 where no bias will be introduced by [CONTACT_646163]-data 
mechanism. If drop-outs are Missing Not At Random (MNAR), meaning the likelihood of drop-out 
depends on an un-observed outcome, and the missing data mechanism is ignored, potential bias can 
be introduced. We will run sensitivity analyses using complete cases, last observation carried forward 
imputation, other multiple imputation methods including linear mixed-effect model, to compare results 
across these analyses to assess the robustness of the inference.   
 
D9g.  Economic evaluation 
We will conduct cost effectiveness  to determine if changes i n health care utilization may offset the 
intervention costs between treatment arms . To conduct this analysis, we will use established 
methods124 to estimate direct costs of the interventions and health care spending for study participants 
during the 9 month trial period from the perspective of the VA.   
D9h. Costing    
We will use both mi cro- and gross (average) costing methods125,126  to estimate intervention and health 
care utilization costs, respectively.  Applying VA Health Economics Resource Center ( HERC ) 
guidelines, we will  measure intervention-related activities and their associated costs.125 These 
intervention costs will include: 1) yoga and fitness instructor  average salaries plus fringe benefits; 2) 
study materials  (yoga mats, eye pi[INVESTIGATOR_50151], DVDs, audio-recordings, ergometers, heart monitors, 
pedometers)  provided to intervention pati ents; 3) parking; and 4) facility overhead.     
We will use VA DSS data to obtain health care utilization and cost estimates for trial participants .  From 
the VA Patient Treatment File (PTF), we will collect hospi[INVESTIGATOR_166159], days of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], and 
ICD-9 diagnoses (especially primary or secondary diagnoses) of fibromyalgia for each stay and 
determine the cost per admission. From the Outpatient Care File (OPC), we will collect dates of any  
outpatient visits for fibromyalgia, location of care (stop code), CPT codes assigned to each visit, and 
type of provider delivering care. We will class ify all visits into rehabilitation, primary care, emergency, 
pain, specialty medicine or surgery, mental health, and other treatments based on clinic codes .  
The number of outpatient prescriptions, especially for analgesic and psychotropic medications, will be 
found in the DSS NDE Pharmacy Datasets from VA Information Resource Center (VIReC) .[ADDRESS_1147311] outcomes calculated from the VA health care system perspective.  Having obtained the relevant VA healthcare utilization 
events, the healthcare event requires valuation, which is the task of assigning a reasonable market-level dollar for the expense amount. For each patient, outpatient events (visits, procedures, labs, 
medications, etc.) and inpatient DRGs and medical events (procedures, labs, medications, etc.) will be 
captured from these patient-specific administrative datasets. VHA databases provide sufficient 
outpatient and inpatient procedure and associated treatment classifications (by [CONTACT_357430] -4, DRG and ICD -9 
codes) to allow valuation. [CONTACT_459219] has created similar datasets in other VA funded studies and 
publications. For health care utilization and the associated costs, we will compare inpatient days, 
outpatient visits, telephone care, number of prescriptions and radiographic  tests . However, we may not 
be able to include inpatient costs because hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826962] 9 months of the 
trial and make estimates of between-group differences imprecise.  
23 
v. 10.02. 2014  Study #[PHONE_17250]  We will compare the two treatment arms with respect to total health care costs. Univariate, bivariate 
and regression techniques for repeated measures will be used to estimate the healthcare events and 
expenditure amounts. If cost data are skewed, log transformations will  be performed prior to performing 
regression. An ANCOVA model will  be used and c ontain treatment group (independent variable) and 
adjusted for comorbidities, age, and previous health care cost data collected at baseline as a covariate.     
Costs will be reported in current year’s dollars.  Sensitivity analyses will be used to account for 
assumptions, including changes in intervention costs and changes in costs rel ated to inpatient or 
outpatient services. If the interventions are found to be differentially more effective and costly, we will 
perform a cost-outcome analysis (i.e., incremental cost-effectiveness). We will estimate the effect of the 
interventions on the primary outcome (FIQR total score). The incremental cost to achieve a clini cally 
meaningful decrease in FIQR  total scores due to the interventions, i.e., the cost-effectiveness ratio, is 
calculated as the difference in intervention costs between the two treatment arms, divided by [CONTACT_826997].  
Intervention Costs + (∆ Health Care Costs)

  Where ∆ FIQR = change in FIQR  score, and ∆ Health care costs = difference two groups  
D10.   PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN  
D10a.  Project Timeline 
The 1st quarter in year 1 will involve hiring and training personnel. Important steps will include: (1)  
finalizing treatment protocols for yoga and exercise arms; (2) training the research assistant in 
screening, enrolling, and consenting study participants; (3) programming the electronic medical records 
to identify potential study  subjects based on fibromyalgia diagnosis; and (4) obtaining permission from 
individual treating physicians to approach patients of theirs who might be eligible. During the next 2.5 years, we will enroll 3 06 participants  (randomizing 153 to each group). Enrollment will average [ADDRESS_1147312] outcome assessments 
at baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 9 months. Thus, enrollment will be conducted from the 2
nd quarter (year 1) 
until the 4th quarter (year 3); the intervention phase from 2nd quarter (year 1) until 1st quarter (year 4); 
and outcome assessments from 2nd quarter (year 1) until the end of study period.  Baseline analysis will 
begin at the beginning of year 4 and conducted during the final 9 months of the study (separate 
baseline, 3 month, and end-of-study analyses). Main reports and manuscripts will be prepared in the 3rd 
and 4th quarters of Year 4.

v. 10.02. 2014  Study #[PHONE_17250]  Overall project coordination will be led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Bair (PI) and [CONTACT_827002] (Project coordinator). [CONTACT_827004] will coordinate all aspects of the project, trouble-shoot any problems, and provide regular 
updates on recruitment progress. Drs. Bair, Schmid, and French have office, meeting and research 
space within the HSR&D Center for Implementing Evidence-based Practice (CIEBP) at the RVAMC.  
[CONTACT_606147] and [CONTACT_20266]’s offices are  a 5-minute walk or drive, respectively  from CIEBP. [CONTACT_827005] will be available for the monthly study-related teleconferences.     
D10c.   Investigator roles 
The proposed project will be conducted by a strong multidisciplinary team with extensive experience in areas relevant to this study. Specific roles of the research team are outlined in more detail in the budget 
justification. The efforts of each of the investigators will be coordinated by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Bair and [CONTACT_827002] to develop plans, review progress, discuss analysis results, and set priorities for the research team. Matthew Bair, MD, MS, has expertise in pain interventions in primary care and chronic pain and 
depression comorbidity. He will serve as PI [INVESTIGATOR_826963]. Dennis Ang, MD, MPH, 
is a rheumatologist-investigator with expertise in fibromyalgia clinical and translational research. He will 
serve as the study’s clinical content expert.   Arlene Schmid, PhD, OTR  is an occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]-
investigator and will contribute her expertise in developi[INVESTIGATOR_826964].  Marieke Van Puymbroeck, PhD, CTRS, is a rehabilitation 
scientist and recreational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_826965]. She will assi st in ensuring 
fidelity and excellent quality of yoga therapy. Kristine K. Miller, PT, MS is a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_826966]. Dustin French, 
PhD,  is a health economist-investigator with extensive experience in VA large database research. [CONTACT_827006] will guide the economic analysis. Zhangsheng Yu, PhD, is an experienced clinical trial 
biostatistician who will lead the data analysis. Additional analytic support will be provided by [CONTACT_826998], MS , who specializes in hierarchical and longitudinal analyses.  Nancy Schalk, YT will deliver 
the yoga intervention. Christy Sargent, BA, will serve as project coordinator, Amanda Gerwig, B S as the 
research assistant, and Jeff Barnd, MS as the data manager.  
D10d. Data Management  
Each of the study questionnaires will be programmed into a desktop computer using Microsoft Access. The 
research assistant will interview the patient and enter data simultaneously into the Access program. Within the 
Access program, algorithms will be created to check for inappropriate or missed data entry. Computer algorithms will also automatically score the questionnaires and store the summary scales within the same database, as well 
as determine the appropriate date for follow -up interviews. These data will be backed up daily onto a secured 
server at RVAMC. Participant social security numbers, names, addresses and other personal information will be 
restricted to authorized personnel to protect confidentiality. For data analysis and other uses of the data, this 
information will be removed from the database and be replaced with a simulated identification number. This 
strategy has been used in our previous trials to screen and enroll patients, accurately complete follow -up 
assessment, and protect patient privacy. We have experience in setting up data integrity protocols and data back -
up to minimize the risk for lost or inaccurate data.  
D10e. Data Safety Monitoring Plan 
The following multi -component Data Safety Monitoring Plan has been used in our VA RR&D -funded 
ESCAPE trial of OEF/OIF veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain and NIMH -funded 
pain/depression SCAMP trial. Subjects are monitored during study interventions in the following ways: 
1) frequent subject contacts by [CONTACT_65685].  Responses to the interventions, as well as 
side effects from them are closely monitored. All interview responses are  part of the study database. 2) 
Monthly Executive Committee Meetings.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254]-investigators meet monthly for Executive Committee meetings.  At these meetings the investigators discuss recruitment, subject safety, protocol 
adherence, and any other issues that may arise.  Minutes are kept and are circulated to any co-
investigators not able to attend.  Subjects will be allowed to withdraw from the trial at any time.  If a 
patient withdraws, we will determine the reason for withdrawal.  Possible reasons will include: 1) death, 2) worsening of comorbid medical conditions making foll ow-up impossible, 3) treatment side effects, 
and 4) other.  If subjects withdraw, we will attempt to obtain their permission to complete the remaining 
25 
v. 10.02. 2014  Study #[PHONE_17250]  outcome assessments. We will establish a local Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) that meets 
every [ADDRESS_1147314], a nurse, and a biostatistician.   
The DS MB will m onitor the following: (a) subject recruitment, accrual, and retention; (b) patient 
outcomes and adverse events; (c) subject safety, privacy, and confidentiality procedures; (d) diversity 
of subject enrollment (i.e., sex and race) ; (e) data quality and major findings in terms of treatment 
benefits and risks; (f) results of related studies that impact subject safety; (g) assessment of scientific 
reports that might alter the benefit/risk ratio of the study.  Analyses of data will be performed by [CONTACT_826999] (which will include an independent biostatistician) which can request additional analyses as the DSMB members see fit.  Since this is an effectiveness trial using evidence-based treatments, there are no pre-planned inter im 
analyses or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. The DSMB will submit the report of its  annual meeting to the study 
investigators who will in turn report the information to IRB in its continuing review, unless there are 
items  DSMB feels should be reported to IRB immediately.  
D11. DISSEMINATION AND IM PLEMENTATION PLAN    
The VHA National Pain Management Strategy Coordinating Committee will serve as our primary channel for disseminating study findings to VA providers, administrators, researchers and policy 
makers.  Findings will be disseminated to the committee in the form of summary reports and 
presentations given either in the monthly conference calls or at their annual face-to- face meeting (or 
both). The Committee will advise and coordinate next steps for dissemination, including dissemination 
to other relevant entities such as VISN and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_367596]; local Pain Management Committees; the VISN Pain Points of Contact, the Office of Quality and Performance; and the national working groups related to pain management education, guideline development, and performance 
measures.  Additionally, a summary of study findings and implications will be posted on the VHA Pain 
Management Committee’s website in a format readable to veterans.  Findings will be disseminated to our research audiences through scientific presentations and publications, and VA  cyber seminars, as 
well as through conference calls with the Pain Research Working Group, a subcommittee of the VHA National Pain Management Strategy Coordinating Committee.   
We also will seek synergistic opportunities with the Pain Research, Informatics, Medical comorbidities and Education (PRIME) Center directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Robert Kerns (VA National Program Director for Pain Management).  Other resources include a VA na tional pain management website; a widely subscribed 
VA pain list serve; monthly national educational teleconferences targeting providers and administrators; a network of VISN Pain Points of Contact [CONTACT_827000]; and a network of VA and non-VA pain -relevant investigators (the Pain Research Working 
Group) who hold twice monthly teleconferences and yearly face-to-face meetings and who, among their goals, work to promote dissemination of research findings and to influence practice and policy related to pain care. In sum, an established network of resources is already in place to disseminate study findings . Our research group has disseminated study findings in the VA  Cyber-seminar forum 
sponsored by  [CONTACT_827001] (CIDER) .   
D12. POTENTIAL LIMITATION S OF PROPOSED STUDY  
Generalizability : The study sample will be drawn from a single, VA medical center and three VA 
community clinics  in Indiana. As such, the sample may not be representative of all patients with 
fibromyalgia. However, the treatments under study could certainly be applied in other VAMCs/CBOCs.   
Study design: Our research team thoroughly discussed and debated study design issues. In the end, 
we agreed to frame POYSE as a fully powered, 2-arm comparative effectiveness tr ial. However, we 
strongly considered a 3- arm study to compare yoga vs. structured exercise vs. wait-listed usual care. 
However, we rejected this alternative for two reasons. The first was pragmatic:  it would be difficult to enroll a 50% greater sample size at a single site and this design would add substantially to the trial 
26 
v. 10.02. 2014  Study #[PHONE_17250]  costs.  Second and more importantly, findings from our recent pain trials have demonstrated the 
ineffectiveness of usual care for chronic pain management, making a wait list c ontrol of less relevance.  
Multi -component intervention: The POYSE trial involves a multi -component, yoga intervention that will 
primarily test the “bundled”  effect (combination of yoga poses, relaxation, and meditation practices) on 
reduction of overall fibromyalgia severity and associated symptoms . Determining the relative effects 
of the individual yoga components will be difficult, but not impossible.  While we considered a 
study of a less complex intervention, a multi-modal approach is best suited to handle the complexities of fibromyalgia management based on the biopsychosocial model. We also 
considered either eliminating the meditation component completely or delivering the 
components sequentially in a stepped-wise fashion rather than concurrently an as an integr ated, mind-body, intervention. However, for historical, philosophical, and logistical 
reasons we decided to deliver the “bundled” yoga intervention as originally proposed.  
To help determine the relative effects and “unbundle”  the individual yoga components, we 
propose two strategies.  First, we will conduct post -study, in-depth interviews of a subsample of 
study participants who receive the yoga intervention. Interview questions will focus on 
perceptions of which yoga component was most or least helpful, which yoga exercises did 
participants use most (or least) at home, and patient recommendations to create a “yoga 
toolbox”, i.e., the yoga exercises viewed most effective to reduce fibromyalgia symptoms.  
Based on our experience with similar qualitative studies, we expect to conduct approximately 
[ADDRESS_1147315] on the different 
yoga components (poses, meditation, breathing exercises) . We have found qualitative work  like 
this to be highly informative in elucidating trial results. Second, since we expect each 
component to be an active ingredient, we plan to quantify these components and examine 
whether there is a dose-response relationship between each component and the primary 
outcome. We will not  control for differential use of components in our main analysis because 
our main goal is to determine the overall effectiveness of a multi-component yoga intervention.  
D13.    STRENGTHS AND SYNOPSIS OF STUDY  
Desp ite the study limitations, the POYSE  trial has a number of strengths, including: (1) testing the 
comparative effectiveness of two unique interventions designed to improve the management of 
fibromyalgia; (2) management approaches that challenge existing treatment paradigms for fibromyalgia 
care and have the potential to be applied across multiple VA clinical settings; (3) a focus on a 
significantly understudied fibromyalgia population (men and veterans); (4) a clinical condition that has 
become frustrating to VA providers; (5) a randomized clinical trial design; (6) ample statistical power to detect meaningful differences  in our primary outcome; (7) a large sample size relative to previous trials 
of yoga and exercise; and (8) an economic evaluation that may provide VA administrators, clinical 
managers, and policy makers with data to inform budget decisions to invest in these interventions and 
make them routinely available to veterans suffering from fibromyalgia.   
In sum, VA providers  are faced with numerous challenges in treating patients with fibromyalgia. The 
interventions being tested in the POYSE  trial have the potential to provide primary care settings with 
new treatment models that will help to guide VA providers  while at the same time providing much 
needed relief for veterans suffering from fibromyalgia.

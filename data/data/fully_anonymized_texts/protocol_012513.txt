1) INTRODUCTION 
We invite you to be in this research study because you are having nasal surgery or having your 
adenoids removed.   
 
Participation is voluntary.  Using this form as a guide, we will explain the study to you. If you have 
any questions about the study, please ask. Once you understand this study, we will ask you to 
decide whether you would like to participate or not. By [CONTACT_3368], you agree to be in this study. If you do not want to be involved with this study, all regular and standard medical care will still be available to you here or at another institution. You also have the right to leave this study at 
any time, even if you agree to join now.  
 If this study involves a child between 9 and 18 years of age, the child will receive an explanation of 
the study in a separate form, called an Assent form. If they agree to be in the study, they will be 
asked to sign this form.  
 
You will be given a signed and dated copy of the consent and the assent form.  
 
 
2) 
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS RESEARCH STUDY?  
Oxymetazoline (Afrin®) is a nasal spray to relieve stuffiness in the nose.  During nasal or sinus 
surgery, Afrin is squirted on small cotton pads that are then packed into the nose to decrease swelling 
and stop bleeding.  During adenoid removal, Afrin is squirted in the back of the throat to decrease 
swelling and stop bleeding .  
 
This is a study to find out  how much of the medicine is absorbed by [CONTACT_805496].  We also want to see if it has any other effects on 
the body.

3) WHERE WILL THE STUDY BE DONE AND HOW MANY SUBJECTS WILL TAKE PART ?  
This study will be done at Nationwide Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77686] 30 particip ants.  
 
 
4) WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THE STUDY  AND HOW LONG WILL IT LAST ? 
This study will consist of one visit and will last during the time of your surgery and recovery, or 
between 2½ and [ADDRESS_1111713] an 
intravenous catheter (IV) placed in your arm.  At the end of the surgery the surgeon will pack your nose with small cotton pads that have been soaked with Afrin or squirt Afrin in the back of your throat .  
This is all standard of care.  
 
As part of the study, you will have a second IV started in your other arm so that we can collect blood 
without sticking you multiple times.  This will occur after you are asleep.  We will collect 3 mL ( ⅔ 
teaspoon) of blood from this IV at [ADDRESS_1111714] any other medications 
that you are given during surgery and in the recovery room.  
 
 
5) WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF BEING IN THIS STUDY?
  
Drawing blood and starting IVs by [CONTACT_1299] a needle in a vein may cause pain, lightheadedness, 
fainting,  bleeding, bruising, or swelling at the puncture site. Infection is a rare possibility.   
 
There may be other risks of being in this research study that are not known at this time.  
  
6) ARE THERE BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY
?   
Although there will be no benefit to you from being in this study, we hope to learn something that 
could help others.  
 
 
7) WHAT ARE THE COSTS AND REIMBURSEMENTS ? 
All costs related to the research parts of this study (blood draws and processing blood samples ) will

Title:  Prospective  Hemodynamic  and Pharmacokinetic  Analysis  of Oxymetazoline  Absorption  during  
Functional  Endoscopic  or Turbinate Reduction Surgery  or Adenoidectomy.  
 
Background and Significance : 
Oxymetazoline  is an α-adren ergic  agonist  that is commonly  used  as a topi[INVESTIGATOR_805490] -the-counter  decongestant  sprays.  Its vasoconstrictive  action  on the blood  vessels defines  its clinical 
utility  as both  a decongestant  and a topi[INVESTIGATOR_805491](1) .  It is used  extensively  by 
[CONTACT_805499]  (FESS), turbinate  surgery , and adenoidectomy  
to produce  vasoconstriction.   Riegle  et al. compared  cocaine  4%, phenylephrine  0.25%,  and 
oxymetazoline  0.05%  for nasal vasoconstriction  in pediatric  patients  undergoing  functional  endoscopic  
sinus  surgery  (2), Children  who  were  treated  with  oxymetazoline  had less bleeding and improved  
visualization compared  with  the other  two vasoconstrictors.   Heart  rate decreased,  but blood  pressure 
was unchanged  during the first ten minutes  after application. However,  the authors  did not determine  
the cumulative  dose  of oxymetazoline. Although  there  is generally  limited  vascular absorption,  when  
administered  in larger  doses,  uptake  of oxymetaz oline  can lead  to significant  systemic  hemodynamic  
effects,  most  commonly  hypertension  related  to its action  on the α-adrenergic  receptors  of the smooth  
muscle  of the vasculature  that results  in vasoconstriction.  Furthermore,  when  used  in even  larger doses  
in young children,  oxymetazoline  can activate  central  adrenergic  receptors and lead  to serious  adverse  
effects  including cardiovascular instability,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_805492],  and neurologic  complications,  which  
may  be potentially  life-threatening (3-6) In the operating room,  this reflex  bradycardia may  not always  
occur  because  general anesthetics,  particularly  volatile  anesthetics,  attenuate the baroreceptor  
response.  Bradycardia may  also be a consequence  of the direct  action  of oxymetazoline  on central  α 
adrenergic  receptors in the locus  ceruleus  and central  vasomotor  areas  of the brainstem.   Our  institution  
recently  reported  a case  of oxymetazoline  induced  postoperative hypertension  in a three  year  old child  
following  inferior turbinate  reduction  and adenoi dectomy.  (7) 
Giannakopoulos  stu died  the cardiovascular effects  and pharmacokinetics  of an intranasal 3 percent  
tetracaine/0.05  percent  oxymetazoline  spray  at two different  dose  levels  in adult  dental  patients.  (8) A 
small decrease  in heart  rate and a small increase  in diastolic  blood  pressure  was noted.  Serum  levels  of 
oxymetazoline  were  measured  and a half- life of 1.[ADDRESS_1111719]  been  reported  in children.  Latham  and Jardine  reported  oxymetazoline -
induc ed hypertension  in a 4- year- old child.  (9) They  also sought  to investigate alterations  in the amount  
of medication  delivered  based  on the delivery  method.  There was up to a 75-fold increase  in the volume  
of medication  administered  when  the bottle  was held  inverted.  Squeezing the bottle in the upright  
position  resulted  in a mist  with  the delivery  of 28.9  ± 6.8 μl of fluid.  The amount  delivered  was effort  
independent.  When  the bottle was inverted  and squeezed,  the volume  administered  was effort  
dependent.   
 Current  practice  at NCH is to soak  nasal pledgets  with  full strength  oxymetazoline  and insert  a varying  
number  of pledgets  on the nasal turbinates  or into the sinuses  for hemostasis,  or on the adenoid bed.  
This proposed  study  will assess the hemodynamic  effects and measure  the systemic  absorption of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_805493],  turbinate  
surgery,  or adenoidectomy.  
Specific  Aims/Objectives:   
The primary  objective  is to determine the perioperative  hemodynamic  effect of oxymetazoline  applied  
topi[INVESTIGATOR_805494],  turbinate  
surgery  or adenoidectomy  using blood  pressure  and  heart  rate intraoperatively  (OR) and 
postoperatively  (PACU)  until  discharge  from  phase  1 of the PACU . 
A secondary  objective  is to measure  the plasma concentrations  of oxymetazoline  at discrete  time  
periods  from  instillation  and correlate  with  hemodynamic  effects,  as well as determine the rate of 
decline  in levels  as a function of time.  
A secondary  objective  is to assess the degree  of bleeding and ease  hemostasis  rated  by a single  observer  
to minimize  variability.  
Hypotheses :   
Instilled  oxymetazoline  causes  an increase  in blood  pressure  in the intraoperative  and postoperative  
period  and,  though  absorption  is rapid  and variable,  effects  are related  to serum  level  of oxymetazoline .  
The decline  in hemodynamic  effect  and serum  levels  is a function  of time.  
Hemostatic  effect  is determined  by [CONTACT_805500].  
Methods:  
Thirt
y patients  of [CONTACT_805504]  who  will undergo  functional  endoscopic  sinus  surgery,  turbinate  
surgery  or adenoidectomy  and are anticipated  to receive  oxymetazoline -soaked  pledgets  for hemostasis  
will be enrolled .  
 Patients  ages  2 through  18 yrs. will be enrolled  if they are scheduled  for  
1) Functional endoscopic sinus surgery  (ten patients)  
2) Turbinate reduction (with or without tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy)  (ten patients)  
3) Adenoidectomy  (ten patients)  
Patients  will be excluded if they  have  been  treated  with  oral decongestants  or antihistamines  within  [ADDRESS_1111720]  of the general  anesthetic  care  related  to the study  protocol.   Our  
usual  practice  will be followed.  For premedication,  midazolam  (0.5 mg/kg  to a maximum  of 15 mg) will 
be administered  15-[ADDRESS_1111721] ral 
index  (BIS) between  40 and 60 to ensure  adequate  and similar depth  of anesthesia.  It  will not be 
considered  a protocol  violation  if the BIS is not maintained  at this level.   Fluid  will be admini stered  to 
attempt a total  of 15 ml/kg  for procedures  less than  [ADDRESS_1111722].  
 Blood  samples  will be drawn  at approximately  5 (3-6 min),  10 (8-12 min),  20 (18-22 min),  45 (30-60 min),  
90 (75-120 min)  and 150 (135 -240 min)  minutes  via a second  IV, placed  after  the induction  of 
anesthesia. Each  sample  will be collected  in a 3 ml heparin  green -top tube.  The maximum  volume  per 
patient  is 18 ml, which  is 1.2 tablespoons of blood  or approximately  1.5% of the total  blood  volume  in a 
[ADDRESS_1111723]  blood  sample  to analyze  oxymetazoline  plasma concentrations  using a 3 
mL - draw  green -top Vacutainer®  Hemogard collection  tube  containing heparin . 
2. Immediately  following  collection,  gently  invert  blood  sample  8-[ADDRESS_1111724]  centrifugation  procedures  (centrifuge  tube  approximately  10-15 
minutes  at 2000g).  If plasma has not completely  separated,  re-centrifuge  the 
specimen  for an additional  3-4 minutes.  Transfer duplicate  plasma aliquots  of 
approximately  equal  volume.  Samples  will be stored  immediately  after plasma 
separation  and may  be kept in a dedicated  refrigerator at +5 ± 2° C. 
3. A minimum  of [ADDRESS_1111725]  laboratory  technique,  into two appropriately -labeled  polypropylene  
tubes  (A and B) with  screw  caps.  
2. Labels  should  be secured  to each  storage  tube  using a strip  of tape  wrapped  
completely  around  the tube.  Labels  should contain  the following  information:  
Protocol  and study  numbers;  subject  number;  study  day and time  of sample  
collection;  aliquot  (Aliquot  A or Aliquot  B); sample  ID (as provided  by [CONTACT_2728])  
and biological matrix  to be analyzed  (whole  blood).  
Storage  
1. Stor
e plasma aliquot  A and plasma aliquot  B samples  in a GLP- compliant  freezer  
at -70°C.  Plasma should  not be stored  at room  temperature  at all and at +5 ± 2o 
C for no long er than  24 hours.  
 
Plasma aliquot  B samples  will remain  stored  at the Clinical Study  Unit  as a 
backup  in a GLP-compliant  freezer  at -70°C,  until  shipment  is requested.  
 
The surgeon  will place  oxymetazoline -soaked  pledgets  according  to usual  practice.  [CONTACT_805505]  will 
make  two different  observations  to assess the amount  of bleeding and ease  of hemostasis (10) 
1) A four  point  scale  to record  subjective  bleeding following  removal  of pledgets  
0= none,  1= minimal/restricted,  2=moderate/diffuse  ooze,  3=severe/bri sk 
2) A six point  scale  to assess ease  of hemostasis  
1=very  easy,  2=easy,  3=usual,  4=some  effort  required,  5=difficult,  6=extremely  difficult  
  
Blood  pressure  and heart  rate and will be retrieved  from  EPIC  for analysis  
Prior  to the study  Drs. Cartabuke  & Elma raghy  determined  that 10 pledgets  in 15 ml of oxymetazoline  
(1.5 ml per pledget)  provided  the necessary  amount  of oxymetazoline  for clinical  use. The number  of 
pledgets  placed  will be recorded  at the time  of insertion.  If placement  is separated  by [CONTACT_805501],  then  this will be recorded  as a separate  event.  The volume  at each  time  point  and the total  
dose  will be recorded.   Age -matched , procedure  matched  control  patients  not receiving  oxymetazoline  
will be used  for comparison.   We will do a retrospective chart  review  of the control  patients  for 
hemodynamic  parameters.  
Statistical  Analysis : 
Compare  the incidence  of hypertension  using systolic  blood  pressure  and mean  arterial pressure  criteria  
using age adjusted  normative  tables  
Compare  the incidence  of bradycardia defined  as HR < 60 bpm,  or tachycardia defined  as HR>100  
Compare  the use of vasodilators  for the treatment of hypertension  
Compare  the us e of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050]/glycopyrrolate  for the treatment of bradycardia  
Compare  the volume  of oxymetazoline  instillation  and hemodynamic  changes  
Measure  the serum  level  of oxymetazoline   at approximately  5 (3-6 min),  10(8 -12 min),  20(18 -22 min),  
45 (30-60 min),  90 (75-120 min)  and 150 (135 -240 min)  minutes  using the protocol  specified  above.  
 
Compare  the degree  of bleeding and the ease  of hemostasis  using the subjective  rating  scale  by [CONTACT_805502].  
 All demographic  and parametric  data  will be presented  as mean  (±SD).   Normally  distributed  interval 
data  will be analyzed  using unpaired  t-test.   Nominal  or ordinal data  will be analyzed  using Chi-quared 
contingency  table  or a Fisher ’s exact  test with  Yates  correction  factor.   A  P<0.05 will be used  to express  
statistical significance.

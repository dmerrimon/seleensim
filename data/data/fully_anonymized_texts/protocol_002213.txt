 Research Objectives/Specific Aims/Outcomes Measur es  
Wire-guided cannulation of the common bile duct is a standard technique utilized during 
Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangi o-Pancreatography (ERCP) to ensure safe and effective 
access to the common bile duct via the ampulla of Vater . Due to the anatomy of the ampulla, 
and the orientation of the biliary orifice, a guidewire with an angled tip may allow easier and 
safer access to the common bile duct without inadvertent manipulation of the pancreatic duct. 
We aim to assess the technica l and clinical outcomes between an angled -tip guidewire (GW) 
compared to a straight -tip guidewire in wire -guided cannulation of the common bile duct. We 
hypothesize that an angled -tip GW is associated with increased rate of successful cannulation, 
decrease d procedure time and decreased rate of post -ERCP pancreatitis in wire -guided biliary 
cannulation during ERCP.  
Primary Research Question :  
Is the use of an angled -tip guidewire associated with increased rate of successful 
cannulation of the common bile duct in ERCP?  
Secondary Research Questions:   
Is the use of an angled -tip guidewire associated with decreased procedure 
duration?  
Is the use of an angled -tip guidewire associated with reduced rates of post -ERCP 
pancreatitis?  
Is cannulation more successful u sing an angled -tip wire in a particular type of 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_9387]?  
 
Background Information / Significance / Scientific Rationale  
Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio -pancreatography is a commonly performed procedure for 
diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in the settin g of biliary tract pathology. Du ring ERCP, bile 
duct access is performed with use of a catheter (sphincterotome) that  is passed beyond the 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_607505]. The utilization of a guidewire , over which the catheter is passed , to 
ensure selective common bile duct cannulation (as opposed to pancreatic duct cannulation)  is 
associated with improved overall cannulation rates and lower r isks of post -ERCP pancreatitis, 
and this practice has become standard.[ADDRESS_805004], there is a paucity of literature that compares angled -tip and straight tip -guidewires in

cannulation: A prospective, randomized trial  
Protocol Version Number: Version 1.0 Protocol Date: 08/29/[ADDRESS_805005] -ERCP pancreatitis between an angled -tip guidewire and straight -tip 
guidewire. This study will aid in  the performance of ERCP and in the proper selection of devices 
to ensure safe and effective biliary cannulation. Additionally, this research may reduce 
healthcare expenditure by [CONTACT_607519].  
 
Participant Selection / Eligibility  
Patients undergoing ERCP with native papi[INVESTIGATOR_607506] -biliary disease  who are  
candidates for ERCP  with biliary cannulation are  eligible for enrollment .  Subjects must meet all 
inclusion criteria in orde r to be eligible to participate in the study.  
Inclusion  Criteria :  
Patients undergoing ERCP for cholangiography, bile or tissue sa mpling from the 
gallbladder or bile duct, or for treatment of biliary diseases (removal of common bile duct 
stones, biliary stent placement)  
Exclusion Criteria:  
Patients who are less than [ADDRESS_805006] undergone gastric surgery (Billroth gastrectomy II, Roux -en-Y gastric 
by[CONTACT_6476])  
Patients with acute pancreatitis   
Patients who refuse endoscopic intervention  
Patients with ampullary tumor, duodenal stenosis, or pre -operatively pro ven 
pancreaticobiliary malunion  
 
Subjects will be recruited based upon their need to undergo ERCP for biliary diagnosis or 
therapy as determined by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_11637] -investigators.  This determination will 
be made  based upon the clinical requirement of endoscopic biliary cannulation. Subjects will be 
either inpatients or outpatients who require ERCP and bile duct cannulation. The ov erall sample 
size will be approximately [ADDRESS_805007] 
trimester.  Additionally, minors (age less than 18 years old) and prisoners will not be recruited o r 
enrolled in the study, as these are vulnerable populations who may have a compromised ability 
to make an informed decision about participation.

Study  Design and Procedures  
This is a prospective, randomized, un blinded trial  performed at Lahey Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_607509] .  All procedures will be performed by [CONTACT_607520][INVESTIGATOR_607510] 
2000 career ERCP’s and 350 ERCP’ s performed per year , (or by [CONTACT_607521]) . Enrolled patients will be randomly 
assigned by  a computer -generated number list to 2 groups (group  1, angled -tip GW; group 2, 
straight -tip GW). All procedures will be performed using standard duodenoscop e or Exalt 
duodenoscope  (JF-260V; Olympus Medical Systems Corp , Tok yo, Japan ). For the procedure,  
patients will receive either general anesthesia or mo nitored anesthesia care as clinically 
indicated . Medications  will be administered by a licensed anesthesiologist or CRNA . All 
procedures will be performed via short -wire technique using a 0.025 -inch, 260cm -long angled 
guidewire with 5 -cm hydrophilic tip ( Jagwire Revolution, [LOCATION_011] Scientific, Natick, MA) or a 
0.025 -inch, 260 -cm long straight guidewire with a 5 -cm hydrophilic tip. (Jagwire, [LOCATION_011] 
Scientific, Natick, MA) For cannulation, attending gastroenterologists will be allowed 5 minutes 
to cannulate ( from first contact [CONTACT_607522]) or [ADDRESS_805010] 
(whichever occurs first).  If the procedure is performed by [CONTACT_607523], the fellow will 
be allowed [ADDRESS_805011] 
(whichever occurs first). If the pancreatic duct is cannulated, double guide -wire technique will be 
performed with the same wire (0.025 -inch guidewire) for an additional [ADDRESS_805012] -ERCP pancreatitis will be defined as  new or worsened 
abdominal pain combined with >3 times the normal value of lipase more than 24 hours after 
ERCP and requirement of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_607511] a planned admission. Rout ine 
blood work will be collected upon admission and during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_607512].  
Data will be collected using the REDCap data collection application and will be securely stored 
on LHMC secured servers.  
Study Title: Comparison between angled -tip and strai ght-tip guidewire  in biliary 
cannulation: A prospective, randomized trial  
Protocol Version Number: Version 1.0 Protocol Date: 08/29/[ADDRESS_805013] of Care : Procedure in both treatment groups is considered standard of care as they 
use FDA approved devices. Here at Lahey, The endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_607513]. The 
guidewire is selected based on physician preference. While they typi[INVESTIGATOR_607514] a straight -tip 
wire, they would also use angled -tip guidewire if the straight tip guidewire does not achieve 
cannulation of the bile duct. Data shows that both guidewires are safe to use with similar rates 
of successful cannulation and adverse events.  
 
Study Calendar / Schematic / Schedule  
The main study -required visit will be the day of the planned procedure (ERCP). On this visit, the 
pre-procedural process will include a discussion with the patient regarding the risks and benefits 
of the procedure as well as a descr iption of the study and consent for participation in the study. 
Pre-procedure data will be collected and entered into the data capture tool. The data collected 
will include patient demographics and indication for procedure.  Randomization will then be 
performed immediately prior to the start of the planned procedure and the randomization 
assignment will be entered into the data capture tool. Data will then be collected immediately 
after the procedure and will include procedure duration, successful cannulati on determination, 
pancreatic duct cannulation determination, types of guidewires used during procedure, fellows 
involvement in procedure and complications of procedure.  On post -procedure day one to post 
procedure day five, post -procedural data will be col lected by [CONTACT_607524] a 
telephone call to the subject if the procedure was performed on an outpatient basis by [CONTACT_607525] [INVESTIGATOR_11637] -investigators. If there is a concern for possible post -ERCP pancreatitis, a lipase level 
will be check ed on an inpatient or outpatient basis. There will be no other planned study -
required visits after post -procedure day five.  Subjects will be removed from enrollment if they 
choose to withdraw from the study.  
 
Potential Risks and Discomforts  
The main ris k of participation in this study is breach of confidentiality that pertains to data 
collection. This risk will be addressed in the “data management” section. There will be no 
additional risk to subjects based upon randomization to either arm of the study a s data has 
shown that either wire (angled -tip vs straight -tip) are equally safe and confer no higher risk of 
adverse events.[ADDRESS_805014] -ERCP 
pancreatitis.3 The risk of bleeding is 1.3 %.3 The risk of i nfection (ascending cholangitis) is less 
than 1%.3 The risk of perforation is 0.1 to 0.6%.[ADDRESS_805015] -ERCP pancreatitis is 3.5%.3 
These risks can range from mild in severity to severe and life threatening. These risks will be 
minimized by [CONTACT_607526][INVESTIGATOR_607515] 2000 procedures performed and by [CONTACT_607527] -

Statistical Analysis  
The sample size needed to achieve statistical significance for the primary outcome is 248 (207 
*1.2) after  adding 20% screen failure rate.  The power of the study to detect if there is a true 
difference will be 0.80.  It will take approximately six  months to reach the target accrual . The 
variables that need to be collected include demographics, co -morbidities, laboratory values, 
date of procedure, diagnosis, outcome of procedure (success of cannulation), duration of 
procedure, post -procedure complications (including post -ERCP pancreatitis) and fellow 
involvem ent in procedure. The outcome variables  include rate of successful cannulation, and 
incidence of post -ERCP pancreatitis.  Predictor variables include co -morbidities, indication for 
procedure and fellow involvement in procedure.  Potential confo unding variabl es include differing 
anatomy of papi[INVESTIGATOR_607516], underlying etiology of biliary obstruction  (which may be 
different from suspected pre -procedure diagnosis)  or unforeseen biliary pathology  which alters 
procedure.  The study endpoints will be achieve d by [CONTACT_30432] a statistically significant difference 
in the rate of successful cannulation using an angled -wire as compared to a straight wire as 
defined as a p -value of less than 0.05. The proportion of procedures that are successful in the 
two treatment a rms will be compared using chi squared analysis. Similarly, the rate of 
development of pancreatitis will be compared using chi squared analysis. The total duration of 
the procedure will be compared using a T -Test for comparing mean if the data are normally  
distributed or a Wilcoxon rank sum test if not normally distributed.  
 
Data Management  
All data will be collected using the REDCap  Data Collection application and will be stored 
electronically on this platform. Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_9814] -investigators will have access to the 
password encrypted REDCap database. There will be no transmission of the acquired data off 
site. The data set will no t include patient names or other identifiers.  Information for this study 
will be available as required to the FDA, [LOCATION_005] Department of Health, and LHMC IRB. 
Names of subjects will not be mentioned in publications or case reports.

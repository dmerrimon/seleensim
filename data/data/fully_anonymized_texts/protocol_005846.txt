5. LAY LANGUAGE SUMMARY  OR SYNOPSIS (no more than one paragraph)  
This study will assess the role of  topi[INVESTIGATOR_98709] 1% cream and its effect on protease and antimicrobial 
peptide expression  and on the skin microbiome  (the microorganisms that live on the skin)  in rosacea. This  
is a single -site [ADDRESS_108643] repeat tape strippi[INVESTIGATOR_98710]/or skin swa bs. At the end of the study, 
tape strips  and skin swabs  will be analyzed to determine serine protease activity  and skin microbiome  of 
participants at each of their visits  and expression of cathelicidin (LL -37) mRNA .  We will then look at 
changes in serine  protease activity  and LL -37 expression  and skin microbiome  over time, and w e will also 
determine whether or not these changes correlate with disease severity.   
 
6. SPECIFIC AIMS  
1.  To determine if 12 weeks of topi[INVESTIGATOR_98711] l skin can decrease biochemical 
markers of rosacea -specific inflammation  and/or change the skin microbiome composition of rosacea 
patients  
2. To validate and correlate the efficacy of topi[INVESTIGATOR_98712].  
 
7. BACK GROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Recent observations have shown that facial skin from patients with rosacea produce excess amounts of 
the serine protease kallikrein 5 (KLK5), and abnormal forms of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin (CAMP). 
In mice, abnormal CA MP and KLK5 expression influences inflammation, and administration of the forms of 
human CAMP found in rosacea results in inflammation, angiogenesis and vascular ectasia. In this study, we 
sought to further confirm the critical role of KLK5 and CAMP in ros acea by [CONTACT_98741] a current 
human beneficial therapy correlated with changes in the expression of these genes. We measured KLK5 in 
cultured normal human epi[INVESTIGATOR_98713] (NHEKs), and found that differentiated keratinocytes in high 
calcium media (1.6 mM) greatly increased both KLK5 mRNA and protein compared to undifferentiated cells. 
Addition of Azelaic acid (AzA, 10 -8 to 10 -9 M) to differentiated NHEKs significantly decreased KLK5 in media 
(vehicle; 91.26 ± 22.58 ng/ml, 10 -8 M AzA; 41.69 ± 15.08 ng/ml). Total protease activity was also significantly 
less in media recovered from keratinocytes treated with 10 -8 M AzA.   Furthermore, mice treated once a day 
for 9 d with topi[INVESTIGATOR_98714] (15%, Finacea™) showed significantly less KLK5 and Camp mRNA 
compared with mouse skin treated with the vehicle alone (relative expression of KLK5 and camp was 55% and 
32% of control, respectively). In conclusion, since an excess of KLK5 and cathelicidin has been hypothesized 
to contribute to the development of rosacea, finding that an effective treatment for rosacea can decrease 
expression of these molecules further supports the involvement of KLK5 and cathelicidin in the pathogenesis

Individuals with rosacea show high Catheli cidin antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) expression in lesional skin. 
High CAMP expression in rosacea is accompanied by [CONTACT_98742] 5 
(KLK5), a major serine protease in skin epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196]. Combination of high CAMP and high proteas e activity by 
[CONTACT_98743]5 increase makes CAMP in active form LL -37, which is not seen in normal skin. Persistent abundance of 
LL-[ADDRESS_108644] been associated with both 
a healthy microbiome and a diseased state of the microbiome, we hope to be able to expand on these early 
findings, and better identify the role of Cutibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epi[INVESTIGATOR_98715].   
In this study, we will assess topi[INVESTIGATOR_98709], which is FDA -approved in the treatment of rosacea,  to 
enable us 1) to test if Ivermectin  changes LL-37 mRNA  and serine protease expression  and skin microbiome 
composition  in rosacea  patients , and 2 ) to assess if improvement of rosacea symptoms is associated with a 
decrease in LL-37 and serine protease activity  and related microbial changes .

9. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
This trial is designed as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_98716] I vermectin 1% cream treatment.  This is a single -site 1 6-week 
open label study at University of [LOCATION_004], San Diego. Up to 25 subjects (age 18 +) with at least one 
inflammatory papule (IGA>1) and at least mild erythema (see Clinical Assessment for I nclusion Criteria) 
will all be treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_98717] 12 weeks with 4 in -office visits (screening, then 
monthly follow -ups for 3 months and one follow -up telephone visit one month after study medication 
completion). Twenty  tape str ip samples  (similar to the tape strip method described in Dyjack, et. al. 2018)  
from each  of the four  sites will be obtained at each visit to determine KLK activity and LL -37 expression  
and/or up to twelve  skin swabs to assess skin microbiome . Safety monit oring has been established based 
on both the most likely reactions and the most serious though extremely rare events. At each visit, in 
addition to one planned phone call , the subject will be queried tolerance of therapy and Adverse Events. . 
The study will end with the last subject completing the telephone visit (Visit 5/week 16). If a patient does 
not return for a follow up visit after baseline, a rep lacement patient will be added.   
 
The biochemical analysis of protease activity and LL -37 cathelicidin expression obtained by [CONTACT_98744]. Analysis of the tape strips  will compare baseline to 
week 12 a nd also be correlated to the trends assessed in the tape strip analysis.  The skin microbiome 
obtained by [CONTACT_98745].  
 
Ivermectin 1% cream is lawfully marketed in the U.S. as a topi[INVESTIGATOR_98718]. Subjects will be instructed on the proper application of Ivermectin topi[INVESTIGATOR_98719], and they will apply a pea -sized amount for each area of the face that is affected 
daily. This research proposal therefore does not involve a route of administration, dose, or patient 
population that significantly affects the risk to benefit ratio associated with the use of the drug product. 
Furthermore, this is a proof of concept study, and therefo re, this investigation is not intended to support a

VISIT 1 (Day 0)  
Prior to be ginning any study procedures, subjects will first be asked to review and sign the informed consent 
form. After obtaining informed consent, the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be revi ewed. A brief medical history 
and physical exam will be performed in hel pi[INVESTIGATOR_98720]. Female subjects of child -bearing potential will complete a urine pregnancy test while in our office to 
ensure that they are not pregnant. Patients who meet the inclusion and ex clusion criteria will then have their 
rosacea severity scored by [CONTACT_98746]: IGA and erythema scale. At the 
screening  visit may occur at the same time as your screening visit if none of your medications are excluded.  
Tape  strips and/or skin swabs will be collected from 4 areas of involved rosacea facial skin . Subjects will then 
be given a pre-weighed tube of study medication and instructed to apply the medication daily. Subjects will 
also be  instructed not to ap ply the study drug  on the morning before the tape strip samples are collected on 
return visits.  The total time for this visit will be approximately 1 hour.

Page 4 VISIT 2 Week 4  (+/ - 4 days)  
On Visit 2, rosacea severity will again be evaluated. Tape strips  and/or skin swabs  will be collected from the 
same sites as in the initial collection. Patients will be instructed not to apply the study drug  on the morning 
before the tape strip samples are collected on return visits. Study drug will weighed , and additional drug will be 
provided  as needed . The total time for this visit will be approximately 1 hour.  
 
VISIT 3 Week 8 (+/ - 4 days)  
On Visit 3, rosacea severity will again be evaluated. Tape strips  and/or skin swabs  will be collected from th e 
same sites as in the initial collection. Patients will be instructed not to apply the study drug  on the morning 
before the tape strip samples are collected on return visits. Study drug will be weighed , and additional drug will 
be provided  as needed . The total time for this visit will be approximately 1 hour.  
 
VISIT 4 Week 12 (+/ - 4 days)  
On Visit 4, rosacea severity will again be evaluated. Tape strips and/or skin swabs  will be collected from the 
same sites as in the initial coll ection. Patients will be instructed not to apply the study drug  on the morning 
before the tape strip samples are collected on return visits. Study drug will be weighed , and additional drug will 
be provided  as needed . The total tim e for this visit will be approximately 1 hour.  
 
Visit 5 Week 16   (+/- 4 days)  (phone follow -up) 
Subjects  will be contact[CONTACT_98747]. This phone call will take approximately 5 m inutes.  
 
 
Clinical assessments for inclusionary criteria:  
IGA scale, a subjective 5 -point measure of overall disease severity. IGA scores range from 0 to 4: 0 = no signs  
or symptoms present (clear); 1 = 1 to 2 small, noninflammatory papules (near clear); 2 = 3 to 10 
papules/pustules (mild); 3 = 11 to 19 papules/ pustules (moderate); and 4 = 20 or more papules/pustules and 
nodules (severe).  
 
Erythema scale:  Scores range from 0 -4:  0=none (no redness present); 1= mild (slight pi[INVESTIGATOR_96225]); 2= 
moderate (defini te redness); 3=significant (marked erythema); and 4=severe (fiery redness). For inclusion 
criteria subjects will require at least mild erythema.  
 
Lesional site identification and sample collection :  
At Visit 1, Four ~20x20mm areas will be identified as cl inically involved. These sites will be recorded to 
ensure subsequent sampling is from the same area during follow up visits (Visits 2 -4). 
  
Standard Tape  strippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] -Four sites will be selected, ideally two on the right cheek, and two on the left 
cheek.  Com mercially available stratum corneum sampling tape (such as D -Squame) will be used for 20 
repeated tapi[INVESTIGATOR_14839]. To ensure consistent sampling methods, a pressure instrument ( D500 –D-squame® 
pressure  instrument , CuDerm , Dallas, TX, [LOCATION_003] ) will be applied to the ta pe of the tape strip for uniform 
pressure. The tape is placed on  the skin and removed  and placed into an Eppendorf tube. This will be 
repeated  20 times.  Tape strippi[INVESTIGATOR_8169] a well -accepted less invasive method in dermatologic research that is 
now becoming an  alternative to skin biopsy for certain assays. As we are doing here, we hope to validate 
this sampling method for use in larger studies and transition its use into clinical practice. In summary, 2 0 
tape strips from each  of the four  sites, for a total of  80 tape strips will be collected at each visit for 
biochemical evaluation. They will be stored at -80°C until processing.

Page [ADDRESS_108646] bacteria from participants’ skin.  Swabs are then analyzed for the 
amount of  bacteria and the presence of different bacterial species pi[INVESTIGATOR_98721].  After swabbing, 
the swab are placed into either an empty Eppendorf tube (if analyzing the DNA of the bacteria present on 
the skin surface) or into a liquid medium such as try ptic soy broth (if analyzing the amount of bacteria 
present on the swabbed skin surface).  These tubes are then stored at -[ADDRESS_108647] location of all swabbings, including whether the swab bing 
was taken from lesional or non -lesional skin in a patient with an inflammatory skin condition, will be 
recorded in the participant’s file.     
 
Laboratory Assessments  
Processing of Tape -strips : 
The tape strips from the same visit from the same patient  will be combined and processed together. Tapes 
will be immersed in 1 ml of 10mM Tris -HCl (ph 7.8) + 0.1% TritonX and vortexed.  Protein extracts will be 
completely lyophilized and the pellet dissolved in 40 µl of PBS pH 7.4.  
 
Cathelicidin LL -37 protein an alysis (tape strips)  
For quantification of cathelicidin, [ADDRESS_108648] will be dotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane.  The membrane will be blocked with 5% non -fat 
dry milk in PBS for [ADDRESS_108649] controls.  Alternatively, SELDI -TOF-MS (surface enhanced laser deionized, time of 
fly, mass spectrometry) can be used to determine the cathelicidin peptide size. These procedures are 
developed in our laborat ory to determine cathelicidin peptides from skin tape strip samples. Since the 
recovery of material from tape strippi[INVESTIGATOR_98722], not all patients may have sufficient material for 
these studies.  
 
Skin Swabs  
Samples will be analysed for the bacterial  composition of the skin either by [CONTACT_98748] 16s 
ribosomal RNA amplification, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR),whole genome shotgun 
metagenomics or other next generation sequencing method.   
Statistical Methods  
Demographic s, Population, and Baseline Characteristics  
Background and baseline demographic data and subject disposition data will be tabulated and presented 
for all enrolled participants.  Subjects will be classified by [CONTACT_98749].  The background and baseli ne 
characteristics will consist of age, race, sex, past and current medical conditions, and results from the physical 
examination.  Continuous data (i.e., age) will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_8477], standard deviation, 
median, and range.  Categorical da ta (i.e., sex, race, and severity of disease) will be presented as 
enumerations and percentages.  T-test will be used to evaluate continuous data and chi -squared test for 
categorical data.  
 
Primary and Secondary Analysis  
All information required will be e ntered into the Case Report Forms (CRFs).   The objective of this trial is 
to determine if [ADDRESS_108650] Ivermectin treatment using paired sample t -tests.  Variables 
with right -skewed distributions will be log transformed at each time (pre and post treatment) before analysis.  If 
log transformations do not provide distributions suitable for 2 -sample t -tests (based on violation to the 
normality assumption), the Wilcoxon Rank -Sum test will be employed.    
 
Sample Size Calculation

11. RECRUITM ENT 
Patients will be recruited online through advertisements placed on Craigslist and through fliers posted around the 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 7 UCSD campus.  Recruitment will be performed by [CONTACT_98750].  All recruitment materials 
will receive approval fr om the IRB before utilization. Involvement will be completely voluntary (no coercion) and 
all risks will be clearly outlined and explained prior to enrollment. Involvement will not lead to promotion or any 
salary compensation.  
12. INFORMED CONSENT  
Inform ed consent is an ongoing process that includes the signing of an informed consent form. Subjects will be 
required to sign an informed consent form prior to being screened and before undergoing any study 
procedures or assessments, in accordance with ICH E6;  4.8, “Informed Consent of Trial Subjects”.  Subjects 
will be provided with a copy of the informed consent form and printed materials that explain the purpose of the 
study, procedures, and assessments. Subjects will also be provided with the telephone numb ers of the 
investigator and qualified personnel who can assist with their questions and concerns.  Participants will sign 
the informed consent form at the Outpatient Dermatology Clinic in La Jolla at the time of their screening visit 
prior to any study -related procedures occurring.  The study procedures, as well as the risks and benefits, will 
be discussed with prospective participants during the recruitment process prior to scheduling their screening 
visit, giving participants a minimum of 2 days to consid er whether or not they are interested in participating.  
The procedures, risk and benefits will be discussed with patients again verbally at their visit prior to providing 
them with and having them sign the informed consent form.  Members of the research t eam listed below will 
be involved in the consenting procedure.   
 
Please see attached consent form.  
13. ALTERNATIVES TO STUDY PARTICIPATION  
The alternative to participating in the study would be to not participate in the study.  
 
14. POTENTIAL RISKS  
Summary of the known and potential risks and benefits to human subjects:  
 
Tape strippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: The risk associated with tape strippi[INVESTIGATOR_98725].  Since the tape is immediately removed after a pplication, the risk of reaction is 
extremely low.  However, in previous and ongoing studies involving tape strippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], it has been noted that a 
very mild erythema may develop immediately after a series of tape strippi[INVESTIGATOR_98726], 
presumably due to the mild mechanical disturbance.  The erythema is expected to resolve within 12hrs without 
sequelae.  
 
Skin swabbing : Risks from swabbing procedure during visits include discomfort and irritation during the 
procedure, which will promptly subsi de following cessation of swabbing with the cotton swab.  
 
 
Risks of Medication Withdrawal : Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_98727]’s rosacea. Subjects whose rosacea will be severely exacerbated by [CONTACT_98751] e of their normal 
drug regimen will be excluded.  
 
Risk of Loss of Confidentiality:  Samples will be labeled with the subject identification number prior to 
storage and only study investigators and study coordinators will have access to the patients’ identi fying 
information. The patients name [CONTACT_98763]/test results will be stored separately and securely, but the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_98728]. At that  time, the link between the subject and their sample will be destroyed and it will not be 
possible to determine which sample belongs to a particular patient. A patient may withdraw their sample from 
the study any time before the link between the patient an d the sample is broken.  Study participants will not be 
identified by [CONTACT_98752].  The study -related records will be maintained by [CONTACT_093]. 
All study -related records (patient charts and other study records) must be retained no soo ner than 2 years 
after data analysis is complete.  Patients will be reassured that PHI will not be re -used or disclosed for other 
purposes.

Risks of Topi[INVESTIGATOR_98729]:  
Although this drug was approved by [CONTACT_98753], it does  carry some risks.  
Hypersensitivity to topi[INVESTIGATOR_98730]. Also, t he study 
sponsor reports that the medication may cause  sensations of burning/stinging/redness/itching at local sites of 
application. There h ave also been rare reports of burning, dry, itching eyes as well as redness, pain, excessive 
tearing or discharge, swelling of the eye i f contact [CONTACT_98754]. This research plan does not utilize a 
route, dose, or patient population that differs fr om its lawfully marketed purpose.  
 
 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_98731] : C  
There are no adequate and well -controlled studies in pregnant women.   
 
Effect on lactation : Following oral administration, ivermectin is excreted in human milk in low concentra tions; 
excretion following topi[INVESTIGATOR_98732]  
 
15. RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AND ADEQUACY OF RESOURCES  
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
Serious Adverse Events  
Serious adverse events will be collected throughout the study period , beginning with the signing of the informed 
consent through seven days post the last tape strippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Serious adverse events also will be collected if they 
occur > [ADDRESS_108651].  
 
An adverse event is any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition occurring after starting the study drug 
(or therapy).  Medical conditions / diseases present before starting the study treatment are only considered 
adverse events if they w orsen after starting study treatment.   
 
A serious adverse event is defined by [CONTACT_98755] a significant hazard or adverse 
event, regardless of the investigator or sponsor’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_98733] t.  This 
includes, but may not be limited to, any event that (at any dose):  
is fatal  
is life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)  
requires  in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_98734] o r significant disability/incapacity  
constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
is medically significant, in that it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.   
Any event that  does not exactly meet this definition, but in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_98735] a significant 
hazard (eg, emergency room visit or outpatient surgery), can be assigned the “other significant hazard” in 
regards to reporting serious criteria.  
Additionall y, important medical events that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_98736], or result in urgent investigation, may b e considered serious.  Examples include allergic bronchospasm, 
convulsions, and blood dyscrasias.  
 
Reporting Procedures for All Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events are properly recorded in the subjects’ recor ds.  
After signing of the informed consent form, all adverse events observed by [CONTACT_98756] (whether or not attributed to investigational product), will be recorded in the case report form.   
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_108652] be  assigned by [CONTACT_093]: description; dates of onset and resolution; severity; 
assessment of relatedness to investigational product, and action taken.  The investigator may need to provide 
follow -up information, medical records, and extracts from med ical records.  
Adverse Events Standard Grading Score  
Clinical investigators will “grade” the severity of all AEs using the following scale; the results will be reported on 
the SAE form, if necessary.  
1 = MILD – aware of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated  
2 = MODERATE – discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity  
3 = SEVERE – incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity  
4 = LIFE -THREATENING – refers to an event in which the patient was, in the view of the investigator, at risk  of 
death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death 
if it were more severe.  
5 = FATAL  
 
Recording and Reporting Obligations for SAEs  
The investigator will provide the IRB appropriate information concerning any findings that suggest there has 
been an SAE related to the study.  Any adverse event that is considered serious must be reported within one 
working day by [CONTACT_98757].   
The investigator will notif y the UCSD Human Research Protections Program of any unexpected, fatal or life -
threatening experiences in writing no later than [ADDRESS_108653] by [CONTACT_98758].   
Unexpected and related fatal or life -threatening events will be reported to FDA by [CONTACT_98759] 7 -
calendar day.  
A written report will be sent to FDA within 15 calendar days for any serious unexpected adverse event 
considered related to study drug (including those which have already been reported under the 7 day rule).  
Additionally, any pregnancies reported during this study will be reported to Gald erma.  
 
 
Withdrawal from Medications :  Adverse events associated with stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_80141] -prohibited 
medications may result in worsening of the condition being treated.   
Irritation from tape strips : It is possible but unlikely that patient’s may have some irritation due to the 
application of tape strips.  Patient will be instructed to inform study doctor if irritation occurs.  
Irritation from skin swabs : It is possible but unlikely that patient’s may have some irritation due to the skin 
swabs .  Pat ient will be instructed to inform study doctor if irritation persists . 
 
Confidentiality:   Subject confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_093], the investigator’s associates and 
co-workers, and by [CONTACT_98760] N project.  Confidentiality will be maintained 
according to ICH E6; 4.8.10, part O: “Records identifying the subject will be kept confidential and, to the extent 
permitted by [CONTACT_29695]/or regulations, will not be made publicly available. If t he results of the trial 
are published, the subject’s identity will remain confidential.”  
Treatment and Monitoring :   If a subject has experienced an adverse event from use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_98737], the subject will be asked to return to the site.   Actions taken in response to an AE will be recorded in 
the subject’s medical record in accordance with the site’s procedures.  Any treatment administered for the AE 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_108654]’s source do cument.   
All subjects will receive verbal and written instructions with site contact [CONTACT_98761] -prohibited medication during the washout period.   
Medically significant adverse events considered related to the study by [CONTACT_98762].  
It will be left to the investigator’s clinical judgment whether or not an  adverse event is related and of sufficient 
severity to require the subject’s removal from treatment.  A subject may also voluntarily withdraw from treatment 
due to what he or she perceives as an intolerable adverse event.  If either of these occur, the su bject must 
undergo an end -of-study assessment and be given appropriate care under medical supervision until symptoms 
cease or the condition becomes stable.  If the subject was permanently withdrawn from the study or 
investigational product due to a serious  adverse event, this information must be included in either the initial or 
follow -up Serious Adverse Event Report Form.

MANAGEMENT  
Personal information will be kept confidential an d will be maintained at the Institution receiving the samples. 
The research records will be labeled with a code number. The list that matches the patients name [CONTACT_98764] a locked file at the UCSD Dermatology Clinic on the 3rd floor of University Pacific 
Center in La Jolla. The research records will be kept only as paper records in a secure location, or as files 
behind the secure computer firewall. Any presentations or publications from this information will not identify 
any person al information.  Identifying information will only be available to the doctor obtaining the samples 
from the patient.  De -identified information will be available to all other persons involved with the research 
study.  Study data will be combined for analy sis at [CONTACT_98765]’s laboratory at 3525 John Hopkins Cout  in La 
Jolla. No personal or confidential information will be provided to the trial’s sponsor.  
 
17. POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
A potential benefit to rosacea patients is a possible improvement in their disea se.  Benefits to the population 
include a better understanding of the immune modulating effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_98709] . 
 
18. RISK/BENEFIT RATIO  
The risks involved in this study are small and include the risks of medication withdrawal, irritation from tape  
strips  and skin swabs , and loss of confidentiality.  There is some risk that the study drug could cause local 
irritation.  All attempts will be made to minimize these risks, as outlined in Item 14.  These risks seem 
reasonable in relation to the benefits of the study, which would be to potentially better understand of the 
immunomodulation of topi[INVESTIGATOR_98738] . 
 
19. EXPENSE TO PARTICIPANT  
The participant is not expected to incur any expenses.  Since there are no lab draws or biopsies associated 
with this study aside from a pregnancy test for females of child -bearing potential, which we will do in our 
outpatient dermatology clinic, there will not be any study -related charges to either the patient or his/her 
insurance.  
 
20. COMPENSATION FOR PARTICIPATION  
Participants will receive $50 per in -office visit completed, and up to $200 for completion of all study -related 
procedures for the study (for 4 in -office visits).  No compensation will be provided for the screening vi sit.  
Therefore, subjects who are ineligible for the study based on the results of their screening visit will not be 
compensated for the screening visit.  Compensation will be provided to participants in the form of a check that 
will be mailed to them from  UCSD using UCSD’s payment authorization system.  Payment authorization will be 
submitted after the completion of all study procedures.

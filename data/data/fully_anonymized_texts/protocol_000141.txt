Version Date: 05.11.2017  A.  SPECIFIC AIMS  
Primary Study Aim: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, tolerability, safety, and 
image quality of low -radiation, dynamic perfusion CT of the heart in patients with suspected 
ischemic chest pain and a moderate or severe stenosis seen on coronary CTA.   
The main hypothesis is that CTA with stress an d rest perfusion imaging using Lexiscan ™ as the 
coronary vasodilator will be safe, well tolerated, have lower radiation dose, acceptable image quality 
and be much faster than conventional nuclear perfusion imaging.  
 
Secondary Study Aim: The secondary purpo se of this study will be to assess the diagnostic accuracy 
of CT perfusion imaging compared to either SPECT , MRI stress perfusion,  or invasive angiography.   
Since we expect to be underpowered to prove that CT perfusion is noninferior to SPECT  and/or MRI 
stress perfusion , we will not do any preplanned statistical comparison of the accuracy for diagnosing 
significant CAD between CT perfusion and SPECT/MRI stress perfusion . Because all patients will not 
have invasive angiography, we cannot do analysis for sen sitivity or specificity for detection of C AD 
against this gold standard. Furthermore, we believe that SPECT is an imperfect gold standard against 
which to judge CT (i.e., SPECT has well known problems with specificity and to a lesser extent 
sensitivity).  However, we will present the comparison of findings with each modality on a per -patient 
and per -segment basis so that they can be used to help plan subsequent larger, head to head studies 
that are powered to compare the accuracy of each modality.  
 
B.  BACKGROUND AND SIGNI FICANCE  
Chest pain is one of the most common reasons for eme rgency department (ED) visits. Rapid and 
accurate identification of those with acute coronary syndromes allows immediate institution of 
appropriate treatment and safe discharge  of those with non -cardiac causes of chest pain. Current 
approaches are time consuming, costly , and fraught with errors.  A testimony to the problems of our 
current approach to evaluation of chest pain is the sobering report that more than 50% of patients 
undergoing invasive coronary angiography in this country are found to have nonobstructive coronary 
artery disease (CAD).[ADDRESS_467742] pain in the ED setting.3-5  
However, two major concerns about the routine use of coronary CTA in ED patients with suspected 
cardiac i schemia are: 1) high radiation exposure from the CT scan , and 2) the problem of defining the 
significance of moderate stenosis  identified on CT coronary imaging.  The goal of this study is to 
address both of these issues by: 1) using a novel, 3rd generatio n CT scanner that is capable of 
coronary imaging and perfusion assessment at very low radiation doses, and 2) combining coronary 
(anatomic) imaging with rest and “stress” perfusion (functional) imaging using Lexiscan ™ as the 
coronary vasodilating agent.  A ddition of perfusion imaging to the anatomic information provided by 
[CONTACT_373530].  
 
C.  PRELIMINARY STUDIES  
Using 1st and 2nd generation dual source CT, we were the first group worldwide able to demonstrate 
the feasibility and usefulness of the assessment of myocardial perfusion with CT. Our initial findings 
have been accepted and published in various journals (e.g. Ruzsics Circ ulation 2008, Eur Radiol 2008, 
 
4 
Version Date: 05.11.2017  and Am J Cardiol 2009; Bastarrika, Invest Radiol 2010, J Cardiovasc Comput Tomogr 2010 ; Meinel 
2014, AJR Am J Roentgenol ).  
 
The SOMATOM ™ Force is a  new CT system , and currently  no published data involving myocardial 
perfusion CT are available. However, the vendor has issued estimates on the enhanced performance 
of this new system that indicate a >20% reduction in radiation dose in all routine scans. Furthermore , 
cardiac imaging such as CTA and per fusion studies could result in up to a 50% reduction in total 
radiation dose . Given the technological advances detailed above we have confidence that these data 
will be realized in practice.  
 
In addition , our research group has a proven track record of con ducting  CT studies on reductions in 
radiation do se and contrast material  employing the previous generation of CT systems , such  as the 
SOMATOM ™ Definition and the SOMATOM ™ Definition Flash. We have also conducted pi[INVESTIGATOR_373515] a focus on cardiovasc ular indications. In 
brief , these studies include the following:  
 studies evaluating novel dose -lowering acquisition techniques such as ECG -dependent tube 
current modulation8, anatomic tube current modulation9, prospective ECG -triggering10 and 
high -pi[INVESTIGATOR_373516]11 
 studies on optimizing contrast injection protocols12-15 
 studies in specific patient populations such as obese patients11 and pediatric patients9,12 
 studies using novel reconstruction techniques for dose reduction18,19 
 studies on specific difficult -to-image clinical scenarios, such as the evaluation of coronary 
stents20-21 and heavily calcified coronary vessels22.

Patients with heart rates > 65 bpm may  receive beta -blockers in order to reduce their  heart rate to 
values < 60  bpm. Patients with contraindications to the use of beta -blockers (chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, asthma sensitive to beta agonists, second - or third -degree hear t block, 
hypotension as defined by [CONTACT_88087] <100 mmHg ) are in principle eligible for 
participation in the study – however, no beta -blockers will be used in such individuals.  Patients will 
receive nitroglycerin based on investigator judgment to better visualize the coronary arteries. Female 
subjects of childbearing potential will be given a urine pregnancy test prior to study enrollment. 
Pregnant persons will be excluded . Patients will receive a point -of-care serum creatinine test on the

Version Date: 05.11.[ADDRESS_467746] Coronary Angiography Protocol:  
Studies will be performed using a 3rd generation, dual source CT scanner capable of coronary imaging 
at < 1mSv (Siemens, S OMATOM ™ Force ). The coronary CTA will be performed based on standard 
clinical indications that conform to publi shed appropriate use criteria. The scan will be done using 
our usual clinical protocol with administration of 30  – [ADDRESS_467747] agent 
(Ultravist 370). Acquisition mode (axial, prospective, retrospective or flash) is chosen based on hear t 
rate, rhythm and body size.  We will accept patients who have the SPECT study done within 30 days 
of the scheduled CTA and /or research scan(s) .   
 
Pharmaceutical Stress Protocol:  
Pharmacological stress testing will be performed with a single injection of  0.4. mg of  regadenoson 
(Lexiscan ™) under physician and nursing supervision  per MUSC clinical protocol . The cardiologist 
responsible for clinical stress administration will review a pre -Lexiscan ™ EKG and patient medical 
history to ensure Lexiscan ™ can be a dministered safely. A post -Lexiscan ™ EKG will be obtained and 
read and the cardiologist will determine if and when the patient can be discharged  safely . 
 
Analysis of CT Coronary Angiography Images:  
CT coronary angiograms will be evaluated by [CONTACT_373532].  Images 
will be analyzed using both axial source images and by [CONTACT_373533] 2D and 3D visualization 
techniques such as Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP), curved  Multiplanar Reconstruction (MPR) 
and 3D Volume Rendering (VRT).  
 
CT myocardial perfusion protocols:  
Patients will undergo dynamic, first pass, stress perfusion imaging during maximal hyperemia 
induced with Lexiscan ™.  Imaging will commence approximately 90 seconds after a bolus of 
Lexiscan ™ (0. 4 mg per each 5 mL injection ).  The Lexiscan ™ is followed immediately by a bolus of [ADDRESS_467748] 
administration will begin approximately 80 seconds after the Lexiscan ™ bolus to allow the contrast to 
reach the heart at  the moment of maximal hyperemia.  Data will be acquired for 30 seconds with 
both X-ray tubes set at 80 – [ADDRESS_467749] 
rotation time combined with the dual source system gives markedly improved temporal resolution, 
which helps to reduce motion artifacts associated with the rise in heart rate that frequently occurs 
after  Lexiscan ™ administration. With a detector width of 38 mm and 10% overlap between the two 
imaging positions, the covera ge of the acquisition is [ADDRESS_467750] MPI [INVESTIGATOR_373519] 40 – [ADDRESS_467751] agent ( Ultravist 370 ) 
administered at a flow rate of 4 – 6 mL/s.  Following the perfusion imaging, the Lexiscan ™ will be

CT Perfusion Data Reconstruction and Analysis : 
Dynamic CT MPI [INVESTIGATOR_373520] a section thickness of 3  mm and a 2 mm increment with 
a medium smo oth convoluted kernel (B30). The data are processed with the volume perfusion CT 
body application softw are and workstation (Siemens). After motion correcti on and 4D noise 
reduction, a double arterial input function is defined by [CONTACT_373535]. After a volume of interest is manually defined 
around the left ventricle, the left ventricular myocardi um is automatically segmented. A dedicated 
parametric deconvolution algorithm based on a two -compartment model of intravascular and 
extravascular space is used to derive myocardial blood flow and the volume transfer constant (ktrans) 
from the time -attenuation curves for each voxel.[ADDRESS_467752]:  
CT perfusion images will be analyzed on a dedicated console using commercially available software 
(Syngo Volume Perfusion™) as previously described.[ADDRESS_467753] pe rfusion scans. Perfusion defects will be visually 
rated as reversible (only present at stress), fixed (present at both rest and stress) and mixed (more 
pronou nced at stres s, partly reversible at rest). Quantitative analysis of myocardial perfusion will be 
performed and mean blood volume (MBV), mean blood flow (MBF) , and mean transit time (MTT) of 
each myocar dial segment will be recorded. Readers will be blinded  to the results of SPECT or inva sive 
angiography examinations. The values obtained will be compared to historical published values for 
each parameter (MBF, MBV, and MTT) obtained using older generation CT perfusion protocols, MRI 
perfusion , or dynamic perf usion scanning.  
 
Analysis of SPECT images : 
SPECT will be used as a comparator for the C T perfusion images. SPECT examinations will be 
interpreted for perfusion defects by [CONTACT_373536] (one nuclear medicine physician and 
one cardiologist).  Images will be analyzed on a dedicated console using co mmercially available 
software. Evidence of ischemia will be determined by [CONTACT_373537].  
Perfusion defects will be visually rated as reversible, fixed , or mixed.  Readers will be blinded to the 
results of CT perfusion data and invasive coronary angiog raphy examinations.  
 
Analysis of MRI stress perfusion images:  
MRI stress perfusion imaging will be used as a comparator for the C T perfusion images. MRI 
examinations will be interpreted for perfusion defects by [CONTACT_373536] (one radiologist 
and one cardiologist).  Images will be analyzed on a dedicated console using co mmercially available 
software. Evidence of ischemia will be determined by [CONTACT_373538].  
Perfusion defects will be visually rated as reversible, fixed , or mixed. Readers will be blinded to the 
results of CT perfusion data and invasive coronary angiography examinations.

Image Quality:  
Subjective assessment o f image quality, coronary artery visualization , and perfusion images will be 
performed by [CONTACT_373539] a semiquan titative rating scale of 0 – 5. Image 
quality will be graded on a five -point scoring system: 1 non -diagnostic; 2 limited dia gnostic value; 3 
adequate (presence of artifacts not limiting detection of luminal stenosis); 4 good; 5 excellent.   
 
All measurements and calculations will be performed by [CONTACT_373540].  We will also mea sure the signal -to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast -to-noise 
ratio (CNR) for the coronary CTA and the perfusion i mages. Circular regions of interest will be placed 
in the aortic root at the level of the left main coronary artery ostium (size 100 mm2) as well  as in the 
proximal segments of the left and right coronary arteries and the left lateral ventricular wall (size 1 – 
4mm2). Signal intensity (CT number in HU) and noise (HU standard deviation) wi ll be recorded in each 
region. All regions -of-interest will b e measured three times and mean measurements will be used for 
statistical analysis. The SNR will be calculated as the mean HU divided by [CONTACT_373541] e noise 
measured in the aorta. The CNR will be calculated by [CONTACT_373542].26 These values (SNR and CNR) , although 
standard measures of image quality in CT research,  cannot be c ompared dir ectly between CT and 
SPECT. However, they can be used as a quantitative gauge to compare  image quality between the 3rd 
generation CT scanner with low radiation imaging and the older CT perfusion scans that requir ed 
higher radiation exposure.   
 
Analysis of radiation dose:  
The CT dose index and dose -length product will be recorded by [CONTACT_373543] . Effective  radiation dose will be calculated by [CONTACT_2329] a standard conversion factor of 
0.[ADDRESS_467754] myocardial perfusion will be compared with the radiation dose obtained with the previous 
(older) scanner at our institution in order to have a direct co mparison of the radiation exposure 
decrease to the patient . Patients who have MRI stress perfusion imaging as the comparative imaging 
study will be excluded from the radiation dose  analysis.  
 
Safety and Tolerability Assessment:  
A checklist will be made and each of the f ollowing events will be assessed by [CONTACT_373544] : 
1. Hypotension (systolic BP < 90 or > 30 mm  Hg decrease from baseline)  
2. Hypertension (systolic BP > 200 mmHg)  
3. Significant new heart block (type II 2nd degree or 3rd degree A -V block)  
4. Bradycardia (heart rate < 45 bpm, sinus bradycardia or junctional rhythm)  
5. Bronchospasm (requiring inhaler or other medical treatment)  
6. Allergic reaction (hives , erythema, wheezing)

10. Seizures  
Additionally, a patient satisfaction questionnaire (detailed below) will be administered to all patients 
who undergo the CT perfusion scan following the research scan  as well as a 30 -day event rate (MACE 
defined by [CONTACT_373545], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], ACS/MI, stroke, revascularization,  significant new arrhythmia and 
death) will be assessed by [CONTACT_70963] r eview and follow -up phone call one month  (+/- 3 days)  from the 
scan.  
 
Patient Satisfaction Survey:  
Following the CT perfusion scan , the patient will be given a participant satisfaction survey. The 
purpose of this survey is to assess the patients’ subjective experience with the different imaging 
modalities  (CT vs. SPECT /MRI  stress perfusion imaging ). The seven  question survey will assess: 1) the 
patient’s perception of the overall ease or difficulty of the study, 2) length of the study, 3) perceived 
discomfort, 4) level of apprehension, 5) understanding of the nature of the test, 6) understanding of 
the results and 7) willing ness to undergo the test again.  Each question  will have a quantitative score  
of 1 – 4. Patients who have not yet undergone SPECT imaging at the time will be asked the SPECT 
specific questions at the time of the [ADDRESS_467756] questionnaire.  
 
 
D.2 STATISTICAL METHODS / SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIF ICATION  
This study is intended to primarily demonstrate feasibility, safety , and tolerability of Lexiscan™ for 
use as a coronary vasodilato r during perfusion CT imaging. The study is not powered to prove the 
diagnostic accuracy of perfusion CT imaging with low radiation compared to SPECT or the current 
gold standard approach of in vasive coronary angiography with invasive fractional f low reserve (FFR) 
measurement. Nonetheless, we will use the available comparative data for each technique (SPECT , 
MRI stress perfusion imaging,  and invasive angiography) to help design subsequent clini cal trials that 
are adequately pow ered for an accuracy endpoint. We anticipate that about [ADDRESS_467757] available cath 
comparisions.  
 
Continuous data are displayed as mean ± SD, if  normally distributed, or median and interquartile 
rang e if not normally distributed. Binary data are are displayed as proportions.  Data will be reported 
as means ± SD or rates with [ADDRESS_467758] with the Yates continuity 
correction for categorical variables and inter -observer agreement for image quality will be calculated 
using Cohen kappa (Ƙ) statistics and interpreted as follows: ≤ 0.20 slight or poor agreement, 0.20 – 
0.40 fair agreement, 0.40 – 0.80 moderate agreemen t, ≥ 0.[ADDRESS_467759] for continuous variables as appropriate.  
 
11 
Version Date: 05.11.2017   
Quantitative data (CNR, radiation dose) will be tested using a non -parametric significance test.  
 
We will present comparisons of normal or abnormal perfusion determined from SPECT /MRI stress 
perfusion imaging  or CT perfusion using the standard [ADDRESS_467760] perfusion (based on vascular territory) compared to anatomic 
evidence of signi ficant CAD at catheterization. Any segments cut off by [CONTACT_373546] z -axis scan range 
on perfusion CT will be excluded. Given [ADDRESS_467761] /MRI  stress perfusion. We will first per form a binary analysis 
where each segment is classified as either normal or abnormal, since the relative severity of 
perfusion defects has not been defined for CT.  If feasible based on the number of patients with 
SPECT /MRI stress perfusion scans  scans, we  will compare the number of abnormal segments in each 
patient by [CONTACT_373547] a kappa statistic. We will also use standard SPECT /MRI stress 
perfusion  grading of perfusion (1 – 4 scale) and a similar scale for CT perfusion defect severity (also 1 
– 4) based on prior measurements of absolute myocardial perfusion (ml/100 ml/min) with each 
segment graded as 1, 2, 3 or > [ADDRESS_467762] deviations from the norm. We will then perform linear 
regression (Pearson’s correlation) to derive R values for CT perfusi on versus SPECT /MRI stress 
perfusion imaging  perfusion grade for each segment.

contrast nephropathy from intravenous contrast material in patients with normal renal function.24-[ADDRESS_467771] MPI [INVESTIGATOR_373524].  There is a 
small stochastic  risk of radiation -induced cancer from this additional radiation exposure.   The 
population of patients undergoing cardiac imaging tests at our i nstitution consists primarily of  adults 
>[ADDRESS_467772] system is expected to be substantially lower, 
the risk is likely to be even smaller . In particular, the novel scanner is equipped with a novel selective 
photon shield, which  is expected to decrease radiation dose in particular for perfusion studies ; this is 
discussed in more detail in section E of the supporting document attached to this  application.  
 
Contrast and Drug Management  
The clinical stock of contrast will be used for this study  and will be labeled with study specific 
identifiers tracking the administration and supply.  The warmer located in the dual source CT scanner 
suite will be used to keep the study contrast at required temperature  and contrast will not be kept 
longer than [ADDRESS_467773] supply are: temperature, supply of contrast, and contra st bottle used for each 
patient.   
 
Drugs will be ordered and dispensed from the MUSC inpatient pharmacy per clinical protocol.  
 
Risks from Contrast Media Extravasation

Version Date: 05.11.[ADDRESS_467774] material.  
 
Beta Blocker (Lopressor)  
Common side effects of the drug Metoprolol (a Beta -Blocker) used to slow down the heart rate are: 
depression, diarrhea, dizziness, itching, rash, shortness of breath, slow heartbeat, and tiredness. Rare 
side effects  are: blurred vision, cold hands and feet, confusion, congestive heart failure (ineffective 
pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_373525] ), constipation, difficult or 
labored breath.  
 
Nitrate (Nitroglycerine)  
Common side effects of the drug  Nitroglycerine (a N itrate available in 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg for sublingual 
(unde r the tongue) administration include  headache which may be severe and persistent and may 
occur immediatel y after use. Vertigo, dizziness, weakness, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332] (irregular beatings of the 
heart), and other symptoms of postural hypotension (low blood pressure) may develop occasionally, 
particularly in upright, motionless subjects. Fainting, which may lead to falls and injuries has also 
been reported. Flushing, drug rash, and flaky skin have been reporte d in subjects receiving nitrate 
therapy.  
 
Use of Regadenoson  
The following reactions are listed as warnings and precautions when using regadenoson (Lexiscan ™, 
injected as a 0.4 mg bolus ): myocardial ischemia, sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal block, 
hypotension, and bronchoconstriction. The following adverse reactions associated with regadenoson 
are considered transient and are listed in the package insert: dyspnea or urge to breathe dee ply, 
headache, flushing, chest  discomfort, angina pectoris or ST segment depression, 
lightheadedness/dizziness, chest pain, nausea, abdominal discomfor t, impaired taste, and feeling 
hot. Dyspnea can occur during stress myocardial perfusion imaging with ass ociated arrhythmias such 
as hypoxia induced bundle branch block. The first signs of these rare side effects will cause the 
termination of the examination.  
 
CT Examination performed with the new Force scanner  
The Siemens SOMATOM ™ Force is a new computed Tomography X -ray system , which  is substantially 
equivalent to the previous systems  (SOMATOM ™ Definition and the SOMATOM ™ Definition Flash ). 
The SOMATOM ™ Force scanner received 510(k) FDA -approval for clinical use on the 17th April 2014. 
 
17 
Version Date: 05.11.2017  The SOMATO M™ Force scanner has been used for two other research studies with excellent results. 
The risks associated with this CT scanner are comparably low to other CT scanners.  
 
Acquisition of patient information  
The risks associated with gathering this information are believed to be very low. This information will 
be stored on a password -protected computer and network server and in a locked office (ART Cardiac 
Imaging Research Office ). The data from this study wil l be accessible only to the team of researchers 
from this application.  
 
E.[ADDRESS_467775] clinical 
evalua tion determined by [CONTACT_1963](s) will be eligible for the study and recruited from 
the MUSC CT schedule . Before the patient comes in for their clinical coronary CTA, their cardiologist 
or primary physician will be contact[CONTACT_373550]. Willing patients will be approached and will undergo the informed consent process. 
Consented subjects will first undergo their clinically indicated coronary CTA; if there is no moderate 
or significant stenosis on the CTA following an initial interpretation (i.e., normal or near -normal 
coronary arteries) , the patient will not undergo the stress CT perfusion portion of the study  and will 
have  their  usual care without further testing for cardiac ischemia .  However, these patients will be 
included in the data analysis , belonging to the negative CT population. Patients with moderate, 
indeterminate , or significant  stenosis of any major or large branch epi[INVESTIGATOR_373526] y. According to current guidelines, it is to be expected that 
this group of patients will also be clinically referred for further ischemia workup with either SPECT or 
coronary catheter angiography.  
 
We will also target patients who have unde rgone SPECT without referral for cardiac CTA; in this case, 
the coronary CT at rest will be performed as a research procedure with the stress portion following in 
all cases.  The CT perfusion scans will be analyzed and read by [CONTACT_373548] 
(cardiologist and radiologist).  In addition to assessing the safety and tolerability of the Lexiscan ™ 
perfusion study, the CT perfusion findings will be compared  diagnostically  to SPECT and/or invasive 
catheter angiography if this is performed clinically after the research procedure.  These patients must 
have the clinically indicated SPECT as well as the research cardiac CTA with CT perfusion study 
completed within [ADDRESS_467776] will be performed as a research 
 
18 
Version Date: 05.11.[ADDRESS_467777] schedules under a HIPAA waiver.  Study 
eligibility determination and study enrollment will be assessed and performed b y and i nvestigator in 
concert with a study coordinator delegated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_373522]. The potential use of Lexiscan ™ and beta -blockers will be discussed with the 
responsible physician of record, potenti al contraindications will be ruled out and permission to 
approach the patient for possible inclusion  will be sought.  If the  patient  is agreeable, they  will be 
approached by [CONTACT_373549], with a full explanation and request for 
consent as required by [CONTACT_1201].  MUSC policies regarding pa tient consent will be followed.  
 
The PI, Sub -I(s) or the SC(s) will obtain informed consent p rior to enrollment into the study. The 
subject will be taken to a quiet/private area (which may include the scanning room, the patient bays 
or other private areas) and the study purpose, procedures, duration, risks/discomforts, benefits, 
costs, compensatio n, alternatives, new information procedures and privacy statements will be 
explained to the subject.  
 
The subject will be asked to verbally repeat pertinent  study information to ensure subject 
understands the nature of the research . Subjects will be provided the opportunity to ask any 
questions they may have. Consent will be documented in the currently IRB approved version of the 
informed consent and will be signed and dated by [CONTACT_373551].  
 
E.2.b  Protection against Risk  
To minimize the risk of post -contrast nephropathy, patients with decreased renal function (creatinine 
>1.5 mg/dL ) will not be eligible for this study. To minimize the risk of allergic reactions to iodinated 
contrast material,  patients with a history of allergic reactions to iodinated contrast material will also 
be excluded.  
 
Clinical procedures involving Lexiscan ™ administration in the Radiology department will be followed:  
Lexiscan ™ administration will be supervised by a li censed cardiologist who will review the patient’s 
medication and medical history for contraindications before the scan, read the patient’s pre -scan 
EKG, be present for Lexiscan ™ administration, read the patient’s post -scan EKG, and approve the 
 
19 
Version Date: 05.11.2017  patient’s di scharge from the Radiology department. Cardiac resuscitation equipment will be available 
throughout the scan.  
 
All subjects’ medical records will be confined in the usual medical health information office according 
to their policies and procedures. Each staff member that has approved access to electronic medical 
records will be given their own password and will be instructed not to reveal that password to 
anyone else. In addition, those copi[INVESTIGATOR_373527] (ART 2244) in a research specific folder  that will identify 
the subject on the outside of the folder  only by [CONTACT_10573], subject code (subsequent subject identifiers, 
i.e. 001, 002, 003, etc., this number will not be able to identify the subject), protocol name, and IRB 
study number ( Pro #). Any data that are used in publication, analyses, etc. will not identify the 
subject by [CONTACT_2300], etc.  Subjects will be monitored in clinic as per clinical standard practice for any 
possible side effects and treated as indicated.  
 
E.[ADDRESS_467778] SAFETY AND MINIMIZING RISKS  (DATA AND SAFETY MO NITORING PLAN)  
Eligibility in each case will be confirmed by a named investigator. The source data will be collected by 
[CONTACT_373552]/or study coordinator, maintained securely by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_373528]. Clinical data will be recorde d on a Case Report Form (CRF). However, formal 
monitoring of site records will not be completed as part of the general conduct of the study. Data 
collected will be authentic, accurate and complete and the study will be conducted in accordance 
with the curr ently approved protocol (and any future approved amendments), Good Clinical 
Practiced (GCP) and all applicable regulatory requirements.

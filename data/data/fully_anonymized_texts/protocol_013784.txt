3.0 BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE 
 
3.1 EGFR-mutant lung adenoca rcinoma and acquired resistance  to EGFR tyrosine kinase  inhibitors 
Approximately 20% of patients with lung adenoc arcinomas will harbor a mutation in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_33927] (EGFR) gene  found  within their tumors. EGFR-mutant lung cancer is highly 
respons ive to the first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase  inhibitors, gefitinib and erlotinib, with 
supe rior progression free survival when compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy[1-3] and is now 
recommended  as first-line therapy for pa tients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer. The majority of 
EGFR-mutant patients respond  to EGFR TKI’s (>70% response  rate) for an average of 10-16 
months, but then develop acquired resistance to EGFR TKI therapy with subse quent disease 
progression[1, 3, 4 ]. There are several known mechan isms of resistance, with the most common 
being the development of secon d-site mutations within the EGFR kinase domain[5]. There is 
significant research effort being directed at new  second  generation EGFR TKI’s and combination 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_730407][6-9]; there are currently no approved 
drugs for use  in the acquired resistance  setting. 
 
3.2 Rationale for co ntinuing erlotinib in Acquired Resistance 
Cessa tion of EGFR TKI therapy upon  acquired resistance results in symptom exacerbation and 
acce leration of disease  progression in 20% of patients [10].  Symptoms and radiographic studies 
improve when these  patients restart erlotinib [11], indicating that tumors remain at least in part 
reliant on signaling through EGFR.  As standa rd practice, we continue EGFR-TKI therapy in all 
patients with acquired resistance, in addition to initiating second -line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_730408]; we 
hypothesize that EGFR-driven tumors with acquired resistance  remain dependent  on EGFR 
signaling, even after the development of radiographic progression.  Current standa rd of care therapy 
at AR includes  co-administration of erlotinib and cytotoxic chemotherapy. 
 
3.3 Rationale for combining JAK1/[ADDRESS_997669] activation of the ERK, AKT and 
JAK/STAT pathways. Several groups have recently demonstrated that J AK signaling is involved in 
resistance to EGFR TKIs, and have proposed  JAK inhibition as a potential therapeu tic strategy in 
the setting of acquired resistance [12, 13]. 
 
Work done  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Jacqueline Bromberg and colleagues has established  a critical role for JAK/STAT 
pathway signaling in EGFR-mutant lung adenoc arcinoma[14].  Unpub lished  data from Dr 
MEMORIAL SLOAN-KETTERING  CANCER CENTER

Page 9 of 33  
 Bromberg’s lab shows that the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib synergizes with erlotinib in TKI-sensitive 
lines in vitro [15].  JAK inhibition also restores sensitivity to erlotinib in TKI-resistant lines, including 
those  harboring EGFR T790 M.  Furthermore, EGFR TKI resistance  was reversed with a JAK 
inhibitor in a xenog raft model of EGFR-mutant lung adenoca rcinoma. In a transgenic mouse  model 
of EGFR L858 R/T790M  mutant TKI-resistant lung adenoca rcinoma, time to death is significantly 
prolonged by [CONTACT_3252]-treatment with a JAK inhibitor and erlotinib. Inhibition of the JAK2 feedba ck loop is 
thought to increase  sens itivity to erlotinib in sens itive lines and restore sensitivity in resistant lines. 
JAK2 inhibitors decrease  EGFR recycling, resulting in increased  wild-type (WT) EGFR e xpression. 
This WT EGFR is thought to heterodimerize with mutant EGFR, forming a complex succes sfully 
inhibited by [CONTACT_13429] [15]. 
 
Cho and colleagues separately demonstrated that JAK inhibition with ruxolitinib also increases 
sens itivity to afatinib in both resistant cell lines (H1975,  PC9-GR) and  xenograft models[12]. The 
mechan ism of re-sensitization is not fully elucidated but may involve inhibition of EGFR TKI induced 
STAT3 activation. These  pre-clinical findings support the study of combination JAK and  EGFR 
inhibition in EGFR-mutant lung cancers that are resistant to EGFR TKI. 
 
3.5 Ruxolitinib: Studies to Date 
The JAK1 and -2 inhibitor ruxolitinib is FDA-approved at a dose of 20mg by [CONTACT_730418], based  on a rando mized Phase  III trial in which it decreased  
splenomegaly (primary endpo int), and  improved symptom bu rden and overall survival (seconda ry 
endpo ints) [16]. It is generally well-tolerated with a side effect profile (primarily grade 1 or 2 
ecch ymosis, dizziness  and headache) that does not overlap with that of erlotinib (rash, d iarrhea). 
The dose -limiting toxicity of ruxolitinib is myelosupp ression; ho wever, this adverse effect was 
desc ribed in patients with hematologic malignancies and therefore may be less problematic in 
patients with lung aden ocarcinoma. Ruxolitinib has also been  studied in a Phase  2 trial of patients 
with relapsed /refractory AML, in which it was administered at a dose  of 25mg by [CONTACT_104744], 
yielding a response  rate of 60 percent [17]. 
 
3.6 Selection of Doses 
Patients in the proposed  trial will receive treatment with both ruxolitinib, the JAK1/[ADDRESS_997670] doses  with significantly less toxicity[18, 19].The doses of 
ruxolitinib to be tested will be 10mg PO BID, which was the lowest dose  studied in the Phase 1/2 
study of ruxolitinib [20]; 15mg POD BID and 20mg PO bid.. FDA approved doses  are 5-25mg BID 
depend ing on concurrent medications or comorbidities and the specific indication for ruxolitinib. For 
myelofibrosis the initial doses  is 20mg twice daily for pa tients with normal platelet counts 
(>200,000mm3) 
 
3.7 Summary 
There are currently no FDA app roved treatments in the acquired resistance setting. However, there 
are currently several mutant-specific EGFR TKIs in clinical de velopment with promising early phase 
results. In this background, we choose  a null hypothesis of 10% as the bar from which we are 
measu ring efficacy of this combination. We hypothesize that JAK inhibition in combination with

4.0 OVERVIEW OF STUDY  DESIGN/INT ERVENTION  
 
4.1 Design 
 
This phase 1/2 study is a single-arm, open  lab, s ingle institution study of erlotinib and ruxolitinib in 
patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer and  acquired resistance  to erlotinib therapy

Planned  accrual: up to 18 patients (2-18 patients) 
 
-Stage III/IV NSC LC 
-EGFR+ 
-Acquired resistance

-Biopsy at time of 
acquired resistance  
Determine MTD: Erlotinib  + Ruxolitin ib 
Dose level 1: Erlotinib 150mg PO QD + Ruxolitinib 10mg PO BID 
Dose level 2: Erlotinib 150mg PO QD  + Ruxolitinib 15mg PO BID 
Dose level 3: Erlotinib 150mg PO QD + Ruxolitinib 20mg PO BID 
 
 
 
Phase  2 trial 
Planned  accrual: up to 19 patients (10-19 patients). In addition, 6  patients treated at MTD in Phase  I 
will be included  in Phase  II, for a total of 16-25 patients evaluated.

4.2 Intervention 
 
Phase  1 trial: 
We propose  a conventional dose -esca lation study in which oral ruxolitinib will be administered along 
with erlotinib 150mg PO da ily.  The patient must have been  on that dose  of erlotinib for at least one 
month prior to initiating treatment on study. Erlotinib is taken orally once  daily. We anticipate 
minimal overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_730409] 3 dose  levels (50%, 75%, and  100% of the FDA-approved 
dose  of ruxolitinib of 20mg BID for myelofibrosis with a normal platelet co unt of >200,000/mmᶾ) will 
be required. Ruxolitinib is given orally twice daily at a given dose  level in a coho rt.

the next dose level. No intra-patient dose  escalation will be performed.  If one  patient of the 3- 
patient-cohort has  a DLT, than that dose  level will be expanded  to [ADDRESS_997673] of newly 
enrolled patients. All adverse events will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE version 4.0. 
Response  to therapy will be assessed by [CONTACT_730419] 2 cycles (6 weeks) with high 
resolution CT scan with response  evaluated per RECIST 1.1. An estimated 2-18 patients will be 
necessa ry to establish the MTD. Actual ac crual will depend  on the number of DLT’s observed. 
 
Phase  II trial: 
Once the MTD has  been  determined, p atients will be enrolled in the phase  [ADDRESS_997674] dose of study medication. 
 
Correlative studies: 
A. Each study participant is required to have undergone  a biopsy  at the time of acquired resistance 
to EGFR TKI monotherapy. EGFR T790M  status will be determined at acquired resistance, as  well 
as asses sment for MET amplification or any  additional ac quired mutations as is standa rd of care on 
these  acquired resistance biopsy samples. These  are performed in our Diagnostic Molecular 
Pathology Labo ratory using standard CLIA approved assays for mutational analysis and 
amplification.  Immunoh istochemical stains for pEGFR, pSTAT3, pERK, pAKT, Her2 and Her3 will 
be done  on archived biopsy tissue.These  are routinely performed in the Molecular Cytology Core 
Facility and in our Diagnostic Molecular Pathology Labo ratory at MSKCC .  Scoring of IHC will be 
performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Maria Arcila (Director of the Diagnostic Molecular Pathology Lab) using standa rd 
IHC-H score criteria with assess ment of staining intensity (0-3) x by [CONTACT_730420] a final IHC-score. 
 
B. We and others have determined that patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC sec rete microvesicles 
(exosomes) which express the mutant forms of EGFR and  other signaling molecules[23, 24 ]. We

 media.  For pa tient plasma, we isolate exosomes using a well established protocol (see our 
published  manus cript [22]). Whole blood is collected in hepa rin containing tubes  (green top), placed 
on ice and delivered to our laboratory or pi[INVESTIGATOR_730410]. The MRN and 
patient features are entered onto a secure server and  the sample is given a new numeric identifier. 
Here we follow a standa rd protocol for isolation of exosomes [22]. The blood is sequentially 
centrifuged (300x g for 10 minutes at 4 °C to pellet the cells, 16 ,500x  g for 20 minutes at 4 °C to 
further remove cells and cell debris, filtered through a .0.2 μm filter to remove particles larger than 
200 nm and  finally at 100,000x g  for 70 minutes 4 °C to pellet the exosomes). The total nu mber of 
exosomes is quantified using NanoSite and protein concen tration is determined using a Bradford 
assa y.  Equal n umbers of exosomes (using a spectrophotometer based  analysis: NanoSite) or equal 
protein concentrations (5 ug) of exosomes are analyzed by [CONTACT_730421], EGFR, HER2, HER3 pStat3, pAKT, pS6, pERK signaling proteins and Tubulin, Alix and 
Tsg101 (as loading controls and canon ical exosome proteins).  Semi-quantitative analyses is 
performed using ImageJ software of chemiluminescent s ignals. 
 
 
Significnatly, treatment of tumour bearing mice with a JAK2 inhibitor leads  to the release  of 
exosomes in the circulation expressing elevated levels of EGFR/pEGFR. This was determined 
using western blot ana lyses as desc ribed above. Conversely, erlotinib (TKI) treatment of EGFR 
mutant tumours leads  to increased  pStat3 levels both in tumor and in circulating exosomes. We 
therefore hypothesize that the protein/phosphor -protein profile of exosomes will recap itulate the 
phospho r-signaling cross-talk occurring in tumors. We therefore propose  analyzing circulating 
exosomes prior and  during treatment of patients.  10 to 15 milliliters of peripheral blood will be 
obtained at pre-determined intervals during the study. Timepoints include start of study treatment 
(C1D1), C1D8, followed by [INVESTIGATOR_135] 2 cycles, correspond ing to when a radiographic assessment on 
protocol will be reviewed (C3D1, C5D1, C7D1, etc). The samples will be obtained in order to assess 
circulating exosomes for the presence  of EGFR T790M  (using primers specific to this gate-keeper 
isoform and  detected by [CONTACT_87372]-which have been  established  in the lab), , pEGFR, pSTAT3, pERK, 
pAKT, Her2 and Her3 using semi-quantitative western blot analysis as described above. We 
hypothesize that exosome total EGFR protein levels will be elevated while pEGFR, pERK and 
pStat3 levels will be reduced in the exosome samples from pa tients on Ruxolitinib and Erlotinib as 
compared to Erlotinib alone. 
 
 
C. The recent clinical success  of immunomodulatory molecules for the treatment of NSCLC has  re- 
focused  our attention on the potential role of immunesupp ressive myeloid and t-cells with targeted 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. We and others have recently shown that JAK inhibitors potently supp ress the function 
and abundance  of myeloid derived suppressive cells and increase  CD4 and CD8 cells in pre-clinical 
models[25]. We therefore propose  examining the levels of CD33+ MDSCs, CD4 and CD8 cells in 
these  patients at pre-determined intervals as described above. The same blood samples used  for 
exosomes will be processed for the analysis of immune cells by [CONTACT_730422]. The cell pellet obtained following initial 300 xg 
centrifugation is purified using density gradient p urification (Ficoll) and then analyzed by [CONTACT_730423], and T-cell popu lations. We hypothesize that a reduction of CD33+ 
myeloid cells and an increase  in CD4 and CD8 T-cells will be obse rved in those  patients receiving 
Ruxolitinib. 
 
5.0 THERAPEUTIC/D IAGNOSTIC AGENTS 
 
5.1 Ruxolitinib 
MEMORIAL SLOAN-KETTERING  CANCER CENTER 
IRB PROTOCOL  
IRB#: 14-043 A(3) 
Amended: 04 /14/15 
Page  13 of 33  
 Ruxolitinib is a potent and selective inhibitor of JAK1 (IC50=3.3+/-1.2nM) and JAK2 (IC50=2.8+/- 
1.2nM) with modest se lectivity against TYK2 (IC50=19+/-3.2nM) and JAK3 (IC50=428+/-243n M), 
respec tively.  It is inactive against 28 additional kinases  when tested at 200nM.  Ruxolitinib has high 
solubility and permeability (i.e. it is designated as a Class I molecule in the Biopha rmaceutical 
Classification System) and exhibits moderate to high clearance, volume of distribution and oral 
bioavailability in preclinical spec ies.  After oral administration, ruxolitinib is absorbed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], with 
maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) achieve within 1-[ADDRESS_997675]-dose.  The half-life is about 3 
hours in humans; ruxolitinib plus metabolites have a half life of approximately 6 hours. Time to peak 
is 1-2 hours. It is predominantly metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4, and is excreted in the urine (74%) and 
feces  (22%) with parent drug accou nting for less than one percent of each.  It is primarily protein- 
bound  (97%). 
 
Ruxolitinib is a white to almost white powder. Ruxolitinib has been  shown to be stable for up  to six 
months at 40ºC and  up to 24 months at 25ºC. The 5mg (free base equivalent) is packaged in HDPE 
bottles.  Ruxolitinib is provided as 5mg strength tablets. The tablet formulations contain the active 
ingredient and  may include the following commonly used  excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]: microcrystalline cellulose, 
lactose, s tearic acid, magnesium stearate, co lloidal silicone  dioxide, sodium starch glycolate, 
Povidone  and hydroxyl p ropyl cellulose. 
 
Ruxolitinib was approved by [CONTACT_730424], for the treatment of patients with 
intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis.  Incyte will provide ruxolitinib for this trial.  Because  the 
proposed  trial ad dresses  an unap proved indication, MSKCC will hold the IND and  will cross-file with 
Incyte’s IND. 
 
5.2 Erlotinib 
Erlotinib hydrochloride is a quinazolinamine that inhibits the intracellular phospho rylation of tyrosine 
kinase  assoc iated with the epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR). The approved dose  for 
maintenance  therapy in non-small-cell lung cancer is 150mg daily.  It is very slightly soluble in water. 
It is a major sub strate of CYP3A4, and minor substrate of CYP1A2.  Erlotinib bioavailability is 
significantly increased  upon co-administration of food, so  recommended  dosing is on an empty 
stomach at least 1  hour before or 2 hours after eating.  Half-life in humans is 24-36 hours, with time 
to peak of 1-7 hours. It is excreted in the feces (1% as uncha nged drug) and urine (8%).  92 to 95% 
of the drug is bound  to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. 
 
Erlotinib is supp lied as 25mg, 100 mg and 150mg round  biconvex tablets. Erlotinib is stable when 
stored at 25 ºC. Erlotinib hydrochloride is available at 25 mg, 100mg and 150mg tablets that also 
include the following inactive ingredients: lactose monoh ydrate, hypromellose, hydroxypropyl 
cellulose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, sodium lauryl 
sulfate and titanium d ioxide. The 25mg dose also includes  trace color additives, including FD&C 
Yellow#6.

We propose  a conventional dose -esca lation study in which oral ruxolitinib will be administered along 
with the patient’s prior stable dose  of erlotinib.  Erlotinib is taken orally once  daily.  We anticipate 
minimal overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_730409] 3 dose  levels (50%, 75%, and  100% of the FDA-approved 
dose  of ruxolitinib) will be required. Ruxolitinib is given orally twice daily at the given dose  level in a 
coho rt. 
 
9.1 Therapeu tic Agents 
 
9.1.1 Therapeutic Agent - Erlotinib 
Erlotinib will be commercially obtained. Investigators shou ld reference  the current approved 
prescribing information. The FDA app roved dose  for non-small cell lung cancer  is 150mg orally once 
daily and will be used  in the phase  1, dose-finding portion of the study.  The medications will be 
dispensed  at the beginning of each  treatment c ycle and a pi[INVESTIGATOR_730411]. 
Erlotinib is administered daily, at app roximately the same time of day every day. Erlotinib shou ld be 
taken on an empty stomach (at least 1 hour b efore, or 2 hours after the ingestion of food). If vomiting 
occu rs during the course of treatment, patients should not take an additional dose  of erlotinib that 
day. They shou ld resume treatment with the next schedu led dose. If the patient forgets to take 
his/her daily dose, he /she shou ld take erlotinib within [ADDRESS_997681] elapsed, that day’s dose  shou ld be omitted, and the patients shou ld continue treatment 
with the next schedu led dose.  
 
9.1.2 Therapeutic Agent – Ruxolitinib 
The experimental agent being evaluated is ruxolitinib. It will be supp lied for the purposes  of this trial 
by [CONTACT_109912]. Study drug will be hand led by [CONTACT_730425], and hand led per 
acco rding to the specific care instructions. Ruxolitinib is given orally twice daily and can be taken 
with or without food at approximately the same time of the day each  day. The  medications will be 
dispensed  at the beginning of each  treatment c ycle and a pi[INVESTIGATOR_730411]. 
When a dose  is missed, patients shou ld not take an additional dose, but should take the next usual 
prescribed dose.

The phase  1 portion will accrue cohorts of 3-6 patients (maximum en rollment 18 patients). All 
patients will receive erlotinib at 150mg orally daily along with doses  of ruxolitinib orally twice daily. 
Patients in dose level 1 will receive erlotinib 150mg orally daily and ruxolitinib 10mg orally twice 
daily. In dose  level 2, patients will receive erlotinib 150mg orally daily and ruxolitinib 15mg orally 
twice daily. In dose  level 3, patients will receive erlotinib 150mg orally daily and ruxolitinib 20mg 
orally twice daily. 
 
9.4 Dose-Limiting Toxicities 
The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE) will be used  to 
grade toxicities during the trial. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT’s) are defined as any of the following 
events occurring during the first cycle of treatment (i.e. 3 weeks) that are, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_730412], possibly, probab ly, or definitely related to the investigational regimen: 
• Death related to the investigational regimen 
• Hematologic toxicities including: 
o Grade = 4 neutropen ia lasting > 5 days 
o Grade = 4 thrombocytopenia (<25,000/mm3) 
o Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia with evidence  of clinically significant b leeding 
o Grade = 4 anemia 
• Non-hematologic toxicities including: 
o Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_997684], ALT, alkaline phospha tase or total bilirubin 
o Grade ≥ 3 diarrhea, nausea, vomiting that lasts > 72 yrs desp ite optimal maximal 
suppo rtive care 
o Grade = 4 diarrhea, nausea or vomiting 
o Any other non-hematologic grade ≥ [ADDRESS_997685] 3 patients at a dose  level (i.e. dose  level 1), the 
following 3 patients will be enrolled at the next dose level (i.e. dose level 2). If [ADDRESS_997686] coh ort, the next 3 patient coh ort will be enrolled at the same dose  level to expand  the cohort 
at that dose  level to 6 patients. If no further DLTs are identified in the expanded  coho rt (i.e. 0-1 DLT 
for 6 patients at the same dose  level), then the following [ADDRESS_997687] dose  where not more than 1 of 6 patients develops a DLT. 
Dose levels are outlined in Table 1 above. Dose escalation will proceed  within each  cohort 
acco rding to the schema in Table 2 below.

HER2 amplification and additional seconda ry point mutations. 
 
Samples will unde rgo immunoh istochemical staining for pEGFR, pSTAT3, pERK, pAKT, Her2 and 
Her3 in the Molecular Cytology Core Facility and in our Diagnostic Molecular Pathology Labo ratory 
at MSKCC . In addition, peripheral blood will be drawn at regular intervals to analyze exosomes for 
the presence  of EGFR T790M  as well as the same markers stained for by [CONTACT_696776]. 
Two tubes  (10-15 ml) is required, and the research blood will be drawn at C1D1, C1D15, and then 
every two cycles ongoing (C3D1, C5D1, etc).

The same method of assessment (i.e. CT or MRI) and  the same techn ique (i.e. with or without 
contrast) shou ld be used  to characterize each  identified and reported lesion at base line, after 2 
cycles (+/- 2 weeks), and  every two cycles (+/- 2 weeks).  A designated radiologist at MSKCC will 
interpret the study CTs or MRIs according to RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_997697]/physician 
shou ld perform the evaluation for the entire duration of the study. 
 
Tumor response will be assessed  using RECIST 1.1. A CT scan of the chest or CT 
ches t/abdomen/pelvis will be performed to demonstrate all known areas of measu rable disease.  The 
base line study will occur no  more than [ADDRESS_997698] or MRI. 
 
All measu rable lesions, up to a maximum of 5 lesions total, representative of all involved organs 
shou ld be identified as target lesions and recorded and measu red at base line. Target lesions shou ld 
be selected on the basis of their size, should be represen tative of all involved organs, and shou ld 
lend themselves to reproducible repeat measurements. All other lesions (or sites of disease) shou ld 
be identified as non-target lesions and shou ld also be recorded at base line as well. Definitions of 
response  in target and  non-target lesions are described in Table 7 and  8 below. Table 9 provides 
overall responses  for all poss ible combinations of tumor respo nses in target and nontarget lesions.

Discon tinuation of treatment 
Early death is defined as having no repeat tumor assess ments following initiation of study therapy 
resulting from death of the patient due  to disease or treatment. Patients with global de terioration of 
health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence  of disease 
progression will be recorded as ‘symptomatic deterioration’. Every effort will be made to document 
objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. 
 
Evaluation of best o verall response  
The best o verall respon se is the best response  recorded from the start of treatment un til disease 
progression, as defined in Table 9. 
 
Other definitions 
Evaluable for toxicity: All patients who receive at least one dose  of treatment with erlotinib and 
ruxolitinib will be evaluable for toxicity. However, patients who are replaced during the first cycle of 
treatment in the dose  escalation phase  for any  reason  other than DLT will not be included  in the 
assess ment of MTD. 
Evaluable for objective respons e: All patients at MTD will be included  in the intent-to-treat ana lysis of 
efficacy. 
Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from first treatment to time of

 14.0 BIOSTATISTICS 
 
Phase  1 
Primary objective: to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose  (MTD) of the 
combination of erlotinib and ruxolitinib in patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer  and acquired 
resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase  inhibitors. 
 
Endpo ints: identify any dose  limiting toxicities (DLTs), and  establish the MTD for the combination. 
The MTD will be defined as the dose  that does  not exceed  an accep table thresho ld of toxicity. Dose 
limiting toxicity is a binary outcome where a patient either experiences  a DLT or no t. DLT is defined 
as any of the toxicities described in Section 9.4 that occurs within one cycle after initiation of 
treatment with erlotinib and ruxolitinib. 
 
Methods:  A standa rd 3+3 design will be used  to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). There will 
be three set dose levels, using the approved dose  of ruxolitinib, with 50%,  75% and 100%  of the 
FDA app roved ruxolitinib dose  of 20mg PO BID for patients with myelofibrosis with platelets >200,000mm3. 
 
Dose Escalation Schedule 
Dose 
Level Ruxolitinib dose  Erlotinib daily 
Level 1 10 mg PO bid 150 mg PO da ily 
Level 2 15 mg PO bid 150 mg PO da ily 
Level 3 20 mg PO bid 150 mg PO da ily 
The dose  escalation scheme is as follows: 
 
1.  If none  of the initial three patients at a given dose  level experience  DLT, the next dose  level 
will be studied. 
2.  If one of the initial three patients at a given dose  level experiences  DLT, three additional 
patients will be treated at the same dose level. Escalation will con tinue only if there has been  
no additional DLT observed. 
3.  If two or more patients experience  DLT at a given dose, the previous dose  will be declared 
the MTD. Should two or more patients experience the DLT at dose  level 1, the study will be 
halted, and alternative combination dosing will be considered. 
4.  If only three patients were treated at a dose  under consideration as the MTD, an additional 
three patients will be treated at that level to confirm previous results. 
 
Thus, the maximum nu mber of patients that will be enrolled in the phase  I portion is 18 (6 at each 
dose  level). The probab ility of escalation given different true rates of dose-limiting toxicity is given 
below 
 
Toxicity rate 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 . 0.50 
. Probab ility of esca lation . 91% . 71% . 49% . 31% . 17% 
 
 
The MTD will be the phase [ADDRESS_997700] been  treated at the MTD. These  patients will be followed for response 
assess ment and included  in the phase  2 portion of the study. A minimum of 2 and a maximum of 18 
patients will be enrolled in this phase. Given an expected accrual rate of 2 patients per month, the 
phase  1 portion of the study will be completed in within 9 months or less.

 Phase  II 
Primary objective:  to determine the efficacy of the combination of erlotinib and ruxolitinib in patients 
with EGFR-mutant lung cancer  and acquired resistance  to EGFR tyrosine kinase  inhibitors. 
 
Seconda ry objective: to determine overall survival and  respo nse rate and  further assess the toxicity 
of the combination at the MTD. 
 
Methods : A Simon minimax two-stage trial des ign will be utilized to assess the primary endpo int of 
response  rate (RECIST 1.1 CR+PR) at 6  weeks  (2 cycles). This study will test the null hypothesis of 
10% response  rate against the alternative hypothesis of 30% respon se rate for patients with 
acquired resistance. The design chosen  has a 10% type I error (falsely accep ting a non-promising 
therapy), 10%  type II error (falsely rejecting a promising therapy), for 90%  power.  In the first stage 
of this design, [ADDRESS_997701] on -

by [CONTACT_730427], co mplete responses and stable disease. 
Safety and tolerability will be summarized using descriptive statistics. The toxicities and the adverse 
events will be assessed  for each patients according to NCI CTCAE version 4.[ADDRESS_997702] one  dose  of MTD treatment. 
 
A minimum of 10 and a maximum of 19 patients will be enrolled in this phase, in addition to the 6 
patients carried over from the Phase  I MTD level. Given an expected accrual rate of 2 patients per 
month, the accrual to the phase  2 portion of the study will be completed in about  6-12 months. 
 
Correlative Studies 
 
Objectives: Exploratory objectives include analyzing biopsies obtained at the time of development of 
acquired resistance  to EGFR TKIs to identify the mechan ism of resistance  in each  sample. In 
addition, peripheral blood will be collected to obtain exosomes for further study. Within tumor 
exosomes, we will assess  for the presence  of EGFR T790M  and also do immunoh istochemical 
stains to quantitate protein expression. For the correlative studies, the analysis is primarily 
exploratory and hypothesis generating. Correlative studies will be performed on all patients 
participating in both the phase  I and  phase II portions of this clinical trial. 
 
Methods:  EGFR T790M  status will be determined for the biopsy samples obtained at the time of 
acquired resistance  to EGFR TKI monotherapy. The proportion of patients with T790M  mutation will 
be calculated, a long with the exact 95% confidence interval. The expression of proteins such as 
phospho -EGFR, phosp ho-sTAT3, phospo -ERK, phospho -AKT, Her2 and Her3 will be quantified by 
[CONTACT_730428] (IHC) in these  biopsy tissues  and reported as a proportion of patients 
with each  IHC score. 
 
Small amount of peripheral blood will be collected at pre-determined time points such  as C1D1 (pre- 
treatment), C1D8 (one week into the first treatment cycle), and then every 2 cycles, co rrespond ing to 
when a radiographic  assessment on protocol will be reviewed, for obtaining exosomes. The status 
of phosph o-EGFR, phospho-sTAT3, phospo -ERK, phosph o-AKT, Her2 and Her3 in the exosomes

 will be quantified using IHC. Results are expressed as scores (1+, 2+ e tc) or coun ts and will be 
summarized at each time points using descriptive statistics (mean±s td). Graphical methods will be 
used  to evaluate the way protein expression changes during the course of treatment. Immune cells 
(CD33+ MDSCs, CD4 and CD8 cells) will be serially quantified by [CONTACT_730429] C1D1, C1D8 
and then every 2 cycles, and  summarized at each  time point us ing descriptive statistics (mean±std) 
and graphical methods. 
 
With the exception of T790 determination in biopsy tissue, the correlative analyses will be 
exploratory and hypothesis generating.

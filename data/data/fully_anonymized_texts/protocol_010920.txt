CONFIDENTIAL Physician-Sponsored Investigational New Drug Application1.1.Introduction1.1.1.Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS)Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), also known as systemic exertion intolerance disease, is a complex disorder that may be triggered by [CONTACT_885239] (e.g., emotional or physical trauma, immune activation, chemical exposures).  Its hallmark is a reduced capacity for physical and mental activity manifest as profound fatigue along with a cascade of debilitating symptoms (including pain, cognitive dysfunction, orthostatic intolerance, sensitivities, and irregularities of the autonomic, immune and metabolic systems) that worsen with activity (referred to as post-exertional malaise or PEM), are not improved by [CONTACT_55628], and can persist for years.  ME/CFS affects up to 2.[ADDRESS_1238413] economic costs between $17 and 24 billion in the US.  There are no approved therapeutics for ME/CFS.  Patients are often unable to handle the activities of daily living and experience a loss of career and a very poor quality of life [IOM 2015].The etiology of ME/CFS is unknown.  The disease is often thought of as a stress- and/or neuroendocrine-related complication, with patients showing abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-adrenal (HPA) axis and of the immune, metabolic, norepi[INVESTIGATOR_88904] (5HT) systems.  In young animals, intense stress can bring about an up-regulation and relocation of the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor subtype 2 (CRF2) to the membranes of 5HT neurons in the raphe nuclei (i.e., the source of 5HT in the brain and cord) and limbic system, which can persist into adulthood.  In this conﬁguration, a minor stress stimulates (rather than inhibits) the release of 5HT from the raphe nuclei and throughout the limbic system, and the excess of 5HT leads to a desensitization of the 5HT1A autoreceptor and compromised 5HT regulation [Wood 2013, Neufeld-Cohen 2012, Lukkes 2009a, Lukkes 2009b, Waselus 2009, Lukkes 2008].  Cortene Inc. (see below) has postulated that ME/CFS results from such CRF2 up-regulation and relocation, and relative to healthy subjects, ME/CFS patients show increased brain and/or hypothalamic 5HT [Dinan 1997, Sharpe 1997, Bearn 1995, Cleare 1995, Bakheit 1992], 5HT1A desensitization [Cleare 2005] and higher positivity for 5HT serum antibodies that correlate with increased physio-somatic symptom scores (muscle pain, autonomic symptoms, ﬂu-like malaise) and sadness [Maes 2013].  This hypothesis of a CRF2 maladaptation, resulting in an excess of 5HT under subsequent stress, comprehensively explains the symptoms and anomalies of ME/CFS.  However, in the absence of an animal model of ME/CFS, the hypothesis can only be investigated in humans.1.1.2.Investigational AgentCT38 [proprietary data redacted] is a custom [proprietary data redacted] CRF2-selective, peptide agonist…[proprietary data redacted] comprised of naturally-occurring amino acids, and is easily synthesized [Investigator’s Brochure or IB].CT38 was previously ﬁled under investigational new drug (IND) application [proprietary data redacted], with the Division of Metabolism and Endocrine Drug Products at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to evaluate its effect in preventing muscle atrophy and wasting associated with various disease conditions.  Completed studies included all the pre-IND studies (necessary for an acute indication) as well as a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy humans.  Full study reports were submitted to the FDA under IND [proprietary data redacted], and there were no outstanding issues when the IND was voluntarily withdrawn in 2008 (for strategic reasons unrelated to CT38).  Cortene Inc. (“Cortene”) licensed CT38 along with the right of reference to IND [proprietary data redacted].[IP_ADDRESS].In Vitro PharmacologyCT38, CT38s (acetate salt of CT38, [proprietary data redacted]), CT37 (backup lead, [proprietary data redacted]), UCN2 and urocortin 3 (UCN3, endogenous CRF2-selective peptide) were evaluated for selectivity and potency against CRF1 (via A7r5 rat aortic cell lines) and CRF2 (via Y-79 human retinoblastoma cell lines), by [CONTACT_807481] (cAMP) formation after treatment with the compound of interest.  CT38 was found to have a greater than 50-fold selectivity for CRF2 over CRF1, and comparable CRF2 potency to UCN2 [IB].Lucinda Bateman, MD  May 25, 2018, Amended July 3, 2018  /  Page  of 724
CONFIDENTIAL Physician-Sponsored Investigational New Drug Application1.1.2.2.In Vivo PharmacologyIn vivo, CT38, CT37 and other custom CRF2 agonists show similar beneﬁcial effects to UCN2 and/or UCN3, in animal models of muscle wasting (due to casting, denervation, corticosteroid excess, dystrophin-deﬁciency), tumor growth and metastases, inﬂammation, obesity, GI transit time and the cardiovascular system, speciﬁcally changes in heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) [IB].[IP_ADDRESS].Safety Pharmacology and ToxicologyThere is little or no binding of CT38 when tested against various receptors, transporters, ion channels and enzymes, other than CRF1 (weakly binding at very high concentrations).  CT38 does not cause QT prolongation in vitro (in human ether-a-go-go related gene or hERG channel and Purkinje ﬁber assays) and in vivo (rats and monkeys).  In vivo safety pharmacology studies demonstrate that high doses of CT38, administered as CT38s by [CONTACT_51211] (SC) route, has pharmacological effects on the central nervous system (drop in spontaneous motor activity, decreased body temperature, tremors and subdued behavior), respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133] (decreased respi[INVESTIGATOR_573850]), cardiovascular system (tachycardia, hypotension), gastrointestinal system (decreased transit time), and renal system (enuresis and diuresis) [IB].Toxicology studies (mouse, rat, dog, rabbit, monkey, human in vitro) show that CT38 (administered as CT38s by [CONTACT_185685]) has large safety margins with mostly mild, dose-dependent, transient and reversible effects.  CT38 is not genotoxic (in vitro Ames and chromosome aberration assays), has no effect on corticosterone and aldosterone levels, and in 1-month repeat dose toxicology studies in rats and monkeys, there was little or no drug accumulation and no antibody formation (histology).  CT38 is eliminated by [CONTACT_571924] ﬁltration and the terminal elimination half-life (t1/2,z) is < 2 hours [IB].In animals, CT38 administered by [CONTACT_10530] (bolus) causes transient, but dose-related increases in HR and decreases in BP , similar to UCN2 and UCN3.  These were shown to be much reduced under SC infusion, potentially explained by a lower maximum plasma concentration (Cmax).  However, under continuous SC infusion in rats, the complete absence of tachycardia or hypotension even at dose levels 10,000 times higher than the bolus doses that cause such HR and BP changes, suggests that continuous SC infusion induces receptor (CRF2) endocytosis.  This is consistent with studies showing that the endocytosis of CRF2 is a function of agonist potency, concentration and duration of exposure [IB].[IP_ADDRESS].Phase 1 Clinical TrialCT38s was administered by [CONTACT_10530] (bolus) in a sequential, single ascending dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in healthy male subjects.  There were no deaths or serious adverse events (SAEs).  Adverse events (AEs) were generally mild and anticipated from CRF2 pharmacology.  Escalating dose (in μg/kg) ﬁrst caused HR increases at 0.200; tachycardia (> [ADDRESS_1238414]) at 0.833; and hypotension at 1.67.  The only AE classiﬁed as severe was a single subject with tachycardia (160 BPM) at a dose of 1.667 μg/kg (resolved with propranolol).  The maximum tolerated dose by [INVESTIGATOR_123932] (MTDb) was deemed to be 0.833 μg/kg, which showed mild tachycardia without hypotension.  The t1/2,z was 1-[ADDRESS_1238415]-dose.  All laboratory results (including cortisol levels and QTc changes) were comparable to placebo, except for white blood cell counts, which were slightly elevated in the highest dose groups, but had resolved by [CONTACT_53016].  The clinical study report was submitted to FDA and there were no outstanding concerns when the IND was voluntarily withdrawn [IB].[IP_ADDRESS].CT38 in ME/CFSIf ME/CFS results from an up-regulation/relocation of CRF2 and a maladapted stress response as postulated above, then prolonged receptor stimulation via a CRF2 agonist such as CT38, could potentially induce CRF2 endocytosis (as demonstrated by [CONTACT_885240]), which could be curative.  In addition, CT38 and other CRF2 agonists can modulate many of the individual abnormalities of the disease (e.g., the HPA axis, the immune system, cortisol, glucose).There is no animal model of ME/CFS.  Moreover, speciﬁc changes in CRF2 expression on speciﬁc neurons of the raphe nuclei and limbic system, along with any resulting excess of 5HT in these neurons under Lucinda Bateman, MD  May 25, 2018, Amended July 3, 2018  /  Page  of 824
CONFIDENTIAL Physician-Sponsored Investigational New Drug Applicationstress, cannot be measured in a live system—though such changes have been demonstrated in animal biopsies.  Therefore, assuming the hypothesized etiology is correct, the only possible way to investigate effect in humans is via a clinical trial.  Given that CT38 has shown virtually identical pharmacology to the endogenous CRF2 agonists UCN2 and UCN3, both in vitro and in vivo, and has been shown to be safe and tolerable in a Phase 1 trial in healthy human subjects, the Principal Investigator (PI), Lucinda Bateman, MD, a clinician with expertise in the diagnosis, treatment and study of ME/CFS, plans to evaluate CT38 as a candidate therapeutic for the treatment of ME/CFS.[IP_ADDRESS].Initial Experience in ME/CFS PatientsThe ﬁrst 2 patients dosed under this protocol exhibited hemodynamic changes as the infusion progressed (i.e., dose-related).  These changes included increased HR (baselines of 47 and 92 BPM, increasing to respective maximums of 89 and 111 BPM, towards the end of the infusion) and decreased BP (baselines of 105/68 and 108/74 mmHg, decreasing to respective minimums of 110/56 and 100/50 mmHg).  The associated pharmacokinetic (PK) data… [proprietary data redacted].  This increased sensitivity of the CRF2 pathway supports the notion that CRF2 may be up-regulated in ME/CFS patients relative to healthy subjects.Referring to the IB (section [IP_ADDRESS].), a concentration of between… [proprietary data redacted].  The hemodynamic effects induced in the ﬁrst 2 patients dosed under this protocol suggests that the initial dose… [proprietary data redacted] was too high.The next 3 patients, receiving the revised D1 dose under this amended protocol, showed asymptomatic changes in HR (individual increases of 13-19, 13-22 and 9-28 BPM over baselines) and BP (individual systolic decreases: 12-13, 8-17 and 5-17 mmHg from baseline; individual diastolic decreases: 8-11, 14 and 8-18 mmHg from baseline).  … [proprietary data redacted].  Patient-reported symptom assessments (scale 0-65, see [IP_ADDRESS].) showed statistically signiﬁcant improvements in both symptom level and symptom volatility (individual pre-treatment means and standard deviations of 23.57±3.42, 43.91±3.48, 12.87±4.22 decreasing to 15.97±2.21 37.00±3.28 8.11±4.[ADDRESS_1238416]-treatment).  These changes are consistent with the postulate that up-regulated CRF2 in the limbic system increases the sensitivity to stressors and the release of 5HT (and other neurotransmitters) under stress, and thus down-regulating CRF2 will reduce symptom levels and volatility.  … [proprietary data redacted].  It would thus be beneﬁcial to understand the duration of infusion, in particular whether an additional 3.5-hour infusion will reduce symptom levels and volatility further (as previously contemplated in this protocol, section [IP_ADDRESS].3.).To date, patients have been assessed by a variety of exploratory metrics including cardio-pulmonary exercise test (CPET) and cognitive scoring (via DANA mobile software).  CPET in particular was intended to be the primary endpoint in this trial.  However, the pre-treatment CPETs for all [ADDRESS_1238417]-treatment CPETs for the 3 patients tested at the D1 dose show slight improvement in CPET parameters and reduced symptom exacerbation relative to pre-treatment exacerbation, but given the constraints that CPET imposes on the overall protocol (altitude, logistics, duration), such testing is not warranted for this essentially proof-of-concept trial.  Similarly, due to the lack of sensitivity to DANA cognitive testing, and the burden on subjects to complete these daily assessments, this test will no longer be performed.Thus, the purpose of this amendment is to add an additional 3.5-hour infusion at the D1 dose, eliminate CPET testing (and associated visits to the clinic) and DANA testing, and to designate patient-reported symptom scores as the primary endpoint.1.2.Study ObjectivesThis study seeks to investigate the safety, tolerability and efﬁcacy of CT38 in the treatment of ME/CFS patients, based on the effect of CT38 on symptom levels (e.g., fatigue, pain, sleep, cognition, orthostatic intolerance, temperature, ﬂu-like, headaches or sensitivities, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal, urination, anxiety, depression), functional capacity (activity, sleep quality, energy expenditure, HR and Lucinda Bateman, MD  May 25, 2018, Amended July 3, 2018  /  Page  of 924
CONFIDENTIAL Physician-Sponsored Investigational New Drug Applicationhours of upright activity), and general health status (global change, HR, BP , oral temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]), pre- and post-treatment.1.2.1.Potential RisksThe principal risks associated with CT38 are a potential increase in HR and decrease in BP .  In the remainder of this trial, CT38 will be dosed via continuous SC infusion, repeated on [ADDRESS_1238418] to remain within an acceptable range (see below), as a prerequisite for ascending to the next dose-level.Beyond the investigational agent itself, there are minor risks associated with needle insertion, for blood sampling or drug administration.1.2.2.Potential BeneﬁtsIf the hypothesized up-regulation of CRF2 is correct, and if the proposed treatment achieves CRF2 endocytosis (as it likely does in rats—based upon the loss of the ability to induce effects mediated by [CONTACT_87479]2 stimulation), the proposed treatment could reset the receptor within the raphe nuclei and limbic system to pre-ME/CFS levels.  This should reduce the sensitivity of the stress response, thereby [CONTACT_566061]-induced symptom exacerbation.  If the receptor remains internalized, the treatment could be curative.1.3.Investigational Plan1.3.1.Study Design1.3.1.1.OverviewThis study is a single-center, open-label, 18-patient, 3-arm Phase 1/2 clinical trial, to evaluate safety, tolerability and efﬁcacy of CT38, administered as the acetate salt CT38s, by [CONTACT_63278], at up to 3 separate dose-levels, for the treatment of ME/CFS.The study is comprised of a recruitment and screening period, enrollment (Day 1), a 4-week pre-treatment assessment period (Days 1-28), a 1-week interventional treatment period (Days 29-35) with drug infused on Days 29, [ADDRESS_1238419]-treatment assessment period (Days 36-63), and a close-out (Day 64).[IP_ADDRESS].Primary EndpointThe primary endpoint will be determined from a pre- and post treatment assessment of visual analog scale (VAS) scores recorded daily for each of 13 symptoms, namely:  (i) fatigue; (ii) muscle/joint pain; (iii) sleep problems, e.g., un-refreshing sleep, difﬁculty falling or staying asleep, excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]; (iv) cognitive problems, e.g., slow information processing, memory difﬁculties, inability to concentrate/focus, attention deﬁcit; (v) orthostatic intolerance; (vi) body temperature perceptions; (vii) ﬂu-like symptoms, e.g., sore throat, tender lymph nodes, swollen glands, fever, chills, sinus/nasal problems; (viii) headaches or sensitivities to light, sound, smell, touch, taste; (ix) shortness of breath; (x) gastrointestinal problems, e.g., nausea, stomach/abdominal pain, diarrhea; (xi) urogenital problems, e.g., frequent urination, (xii) anxiety; and (xiii) depression.[IP_ADDRESS].Secondary EndpointsThe study will also evaluate various secondary endpoints, compared across the pre- and post-treatment assessment periods, to determine treatment-related effects on activity and general health status.Speciﬁc secondary endpoints, measured pre- and post-treatment, will include:Lucinda Bateman, MD  May 25, 2018, Amended July 3, 2018  /  Page  of 1024
CONFIDENTIAL Physician-Sponsored Investigational New Drug Application•An assessment of hours of upright activity, and any unusual exertion or stimulation, will be recorded at the same time each day (ideally 6-8pm).•Exploratory measures:  Assessed via Fitbit Charge 2™ (measuring activity, HR and derivative parameters including resting HR, sleep level/duration, activity level/duration, steps, calories and distance, monitored continuously and summarized daily).•Orthostatic intolerance (OI) will be assessed at Visits 1 and 6, via of measures of HR and BP and symptomatology, while in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], seated and standing positions.•General health status:  Assessed via the 36-Item Short Form Survey Instrument [McHorney 1994]), and vitals (measuring HR, BP , temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) at Visits 1-[IP_ADDRESS].4.DosingCT38s solution will be delivered by [CONTACT_885241], via a CME T34™ programmable syringe pump), at a ﬁxed concentration, with patient-speciﬁc dose volumes calculated to achieve the intended dose levels, speciﬁed in terms of μg/kg of body weight, or μg/kg/hour (Table 6.1).

In each case, the total dose will be delivered in the form of an SC infusion at a constant rate of infusion maintained for a period of 3.5 hours (~2 half-lives).  This infusion dose will take place at Visit 3 (Day 29), Visit 4 (Day 31) and Visit4b, i.e., a total dose delivered over 10.[ADDRESS_1238420] before D2 testing.  Barring any clinically meaningful concerns with the D1 arm, including PK assessments, the D2 arm is intended to achieve higher concentrations and exposures (Table 6.1).[IP_ADDRESS].Dose JustiﬁcationSafety and toxicology testing of CT38 in animals [IB, Section 4] and humans [IB, Section 5], showed that the principal AEs resulting from CRF2 stimulation were increased HR, decreased BP and decreased temperature.  In animals, these effects generally correlated with … [proprietary data redacted].In rats, cardiovascular adjustments during stress are known to involve both CRF1 and CRF2 in the BNST (in the limbic system) [Oliveira 2015], while stress-induced changes in body temperature are known to occur in the hypothalamus [Vinkers 2010].  Thus, these data collectively suggest that infusions of CT38 can bring about some level of CRF2 endocytosis within the limbic system [IB, Section [IP_ADDRESS]].  The data further suggest that CRF2 endocytosis… [proprietary data redacted].The ﬁrst 5 ME/CFS patients dosed under this protocol (see [IP_ADDRESS].), conﬁrmed that the AEs were indeed hemodynamic, and that these occurred at substantially lower plasma concentrations than in healthy subjects (Phase 1).  This apparent sensitivity of ME/CFS patients suggests that these curves may be left-shifted, and thus the amended doses seek to reduce the rate of CRF2 stimulation.Lucinda Bateman, MD  May 25, 2018, Amended July 3, 2018  /  Page  of 1124Table 6.1:  Revised Dosing ScheduleDoseTotal Dose(μg/kg)Priming Bolus(μg/kg)Infusion Rate (μg/kg/h) / Duration (h)Estimated* Cmax(ng/ml)Estimated* AUC(ng.h/ml)CommentInitialEscalation 1Escalation 2Low0.800.000.20 / 0:450.22 / 0:450.24 / 2:00[proprietary data redacted]CompleteD10.110.000.03 / 0:450.03 / 0:450.03 / 2:00No priming, no escalationD20.350.000.10 / 0:450.10 / 0:450.10 / 2:00No priming, no escalationCmax = maximum plasma concentration, at the end of dosing; AUC = total area under the plasma concentration-time curve. * Estimated based on modeling the Phase [ADDRESS_1238421] 2 patients dosed under this trial by [CONTACT_885243]-Sponsored Investigational New Drug Application1.[IP_ADDRESS].Low Dose The Low dose group (2 patients) received total doses of between 0.79 and 0.83 μg/kg at each Visit.  Although this was below the MTDb determined in Phase 1, it was associated with clinically signiﬁcant hemodynamic AEs, and will not be tested further.[IP_ADDRESS].2.D1 Dose The D1 dose group will receive a total dose of 0.11 μg/kg utilizing a constant infusion rate of 0.03 μg/kg/hour, repeated on each of 3 treatment days.

However, it might be necessary to add an additional dose, longer dosing timeframes and/or up to an additional 2 days of dosing.  This will only be done following a comprehensive assessment of safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efﬁcacy.[IP_ADDRESS].4.Total Exposure Long-term efﬁcacy studies in various animal models of muscle wasting, dosed CT38 by [CONTACT_885241] (utilizing implanted osmotic minipumps) at doses of 100 μg/kg/day of body weight for up to 3 months in rats (5 months in hamsters).  In rats, this achieved… [proprietary data redacted], with the tested animals displaying no obvious safety concerns and exhibiting robust muscle preservation.

[IP_ADDRESS].Dose DiscontinuationIt is impossible to know the extent of any potential CRF2 up-regulation and the related left-shift of the hemodynamic dose-response curve in ME/CFS patients.  While the revised dosing paradigm is not expected to cause clinically important changes in HR or BP , these will be carefully monitored during the procedure.  Baseline HR and BP measures will be made in duplicate just prior to the infusion and represent Time Zero (See Section [IP_ADDRESS].5). The baseline HR and BP (systolic and diastolic) will consist of the average of the duplicate readings taken in the semi-recumbent position.  Dosing should be stopped in a given patient if any of the following are noted:  (i) a systolic BP ≤ 90 mmHg or a ≥ 20 mmHg decrease from baseline on 3 consecutive readings; (ii) a diastolic BP ≤ 50 mmHg or a decrease ≥ 15 mmHg from baseline on 3 consecutive readings; or (iii) a resting HR ≥ 120 BPM or ≤ 45 BPM.  If a patient’s baseline HR or BP meet the ‘stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]’ at baseline, the infusion must not be administered.  The investigator should discuss with the medical monitor whether to bring the patient back for reassessment for study drug infusion.  The time window for reassessment should not be greater than 14 days.  If, after reassessment, the patient does not receive the Visit 3 infusion, then the patient should be discontinued from the study.Lack of tolerability will be monitored in an individual patient by a careful review of the type, severity and frequency of toxicities, e.g., as described in the National Cancer Institute, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0, 12Dec2003.

The AE may be any of the following:Lucinda Bateman, MD  May 25, 2018, Amended July 3, 2018  /  Page  of 1924
CONFIDENTIAL Physician-Sponsored Investigational New Drug Application•A new illness•An exacerbation of a sign or symptom of the underlying condition under treatment or of a concomitant illness, unrelated to participation in the clinical study, or an effect of the study medication•A combination of one or more of the above factorsNo causal relationship with the study medication is implied by [CONTACT_3794] “adverse event.”  An exacerbation of a pre-existing condition/illness is deﬁned as a more frequent occurrence or as an increase in the severity of the pre-existing condition/illness during the study.  Planned or elective surgical or invasive procedures for pre-existing conditions that have not worsened are not AEs.  However, any complication that occurs during a planned or elective surgery is an AE.  (If the event ﬁts the serious criteria, such as an extended hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], it will be considered an SAE.)  Conditions leading to unplanned surgical procedures may be AEs.When an AE occurs after written informed consent has been obtained but before the ﬁrst dose of study drug, the AE will be considered a non-treatment-emergent AE.  Only serious non-treatment-emergent AEs that are related to study procedures will be collected.  An AE that occurs from the time the patient receives his/her ﬁrst dose of study drug until his/her exit from the study will be considered a treatment-emergent AE.  All treatment-emergent AEs will be collected.Immediately Reportable Adverse Event (IRAE) include all SAEs (as listed below), AEs that result in a patient’s withdrawal from the study, and designated program-speciﬁc AEs, and must be reported to Cortene within 24 hours of the study center being informed. SAE:  As provided by [CONTACT_776844], any AE that:•results in death•is life threatening (Note, the term "life threatening" refers to any AE that, as it occurs, puts the patient at immediate risk of death.  It does not refer to an AE that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe).•results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49199] (not including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre-existing condition that has not increased in severity or frequency from the patient's underlying medical condition prior to entry into the study)•results in persistent or signiﬁcant disability/incapacity•is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a patient•is judged to be medically signiﬁcant (Note, a medically signiﬁcant AE is a medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient or require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  Medical and scientiﬁc judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other AEs appropriately meet these criteria and are immediately reportable to Cortene.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm that requires intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home and blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).When completing appropriate forms for reporting the AE, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_885226]:Severity of AE:  Refers to the extent to which an AE affects the patient’s daily activities.  Severity will be categorized according to the following criteria:•Mild:  Normal activities unaltered •Moderate:  Normal activities altered•Severe:  Unable to undertake normal activities.Lucinda Bateman, MD  May 25, 2018, Amended July 3, 2018  /  Page  of 2024
CONFIDENTIAL Physician-Sponsored Investigational New Drug ApplicationThe term “severity” is used to describe the intensity of an event (as in mild, moderate, severe); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical signiﬁcance, such as a severe headache.  This is not the same as “serious.”  Seriousness, not severity, serves as the guide for deﬁning regulatory reporting obligations.Causality of AE:  Refers to the relationship of the AE to study drug.  Causality will be categorized according to the following criteria:•Doubtful:  There is no medical evidence to suggest that the AE may be related to study drug usage, or there is another more probable medical explanation•Possible:  There is medical evidence to suggest that the AE may be related to study drug usage.  However, other medical explanations cannot be excluded as a possible cause•Probable:  There is strong medical evidence to suggest that the AE is related to study drug usage1.4.5.2.Reporting FormsIn this study AEs will be reported via the case report form.All AEs (AE log of case report form):  The AE log is part of the case report form and is used to collect information on the following:•All treatment-emergent AEs (serious and non-serious)•Serious, non-treatment-emergent AEs related to study proceduresEvery attempt should be made to describe the AE in terms of a diagnosis.  If a clear diagnosis has been made, individual signs and symptoms will not be recorded unless they represent atypi[INVESTIGATOR_49197], in which case they should be reported as separate events.  If a clear diagnosis cannot be established, each sign and symptom must be recorded individually.IRAEs:  All known information regarding the IRAE must be recorded on the AE log of the case report form and all other case report forms updated or completed as necessary.  Case report forms that must be completed for all IRAEs are:  patient accountability, study drug accountability, demographics, medical history, and concomitant medications.

Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to: •Determination of unexpected, signiﬁcant, or unacceptable risk to patients •Demonstration of efﬁcacy that would warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] •Insufﬁcient compliance to protocol requirements •Data that are not sufﬁciently complete and/or evaluable •Determination of futilityStudy may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, data quality are addressed and satisfy PI, IRB and FDA.The study is considered terminated upon completion of all patient treatments and evaluations.1.5.3.Final ReportThe PI [INVESTIGATOR_885234] ﬁnal report at the conclusion of this clinical study.1.5.4.Patient-Related1.5.4.1.Patient IdentiﬁcationUpon their enrollment in the study, all patients will be assigned a unique study number.  The link between the patient’s study number and their identiﬁers will be kept in a password-protected database Lucinda Bateman, MD  May 25, 2018, Amended July 3, 2018  /  Page  of [ADDRESS_1238438] of 1996.[IP_ADDRESS].Patient PaymentsPatients will be compensated for their time at a rate of US$10/hour, for parking and transportation at US$10/visit (5 separate study visits).  Patients’ time will include screening/enrollment at Visit 1 (4 hours), treatment at Visit 3, Visit 4 and Visit 4b (each 7 hours), close-out at Visit 6 (2 hours), and data entry over the course of the study (18 hours), so a total of 45 hours.  This amounts to a total compensation of $500 provided all study visits and outcome measures are completed, which will be paid after the completion of the Visit 6.  Patients only completing through Visit 1, Visit 3, Visit 4 and Visit 4b will receive respective payments of $50, $150, $250 and $350 in total.[IP_ADDRESS].InsuranceIf health complications due to study procedures arise, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_885235].  In the event that the patient has an injury or illness that is directly caused by [CONTACT_885253], reimbursement for medical expenses (e.g., ambulance, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], professional nursing, dental, medical, surgical, imaging, ﬁrst aid and funeral services) will be sought from Cortene’s insurer.If the patient’s medical expenses related to such an injury are not covered by [CONTACT_885247]’s insurer, the patients may be responsible for these costs.[IP_ADDRESS].Strategies for Recruitment and RetentionThe study will seek to recruit a total of 18 ME/CFS patients within Salt Lake City and the surrounding areas.Potential cases will be identiﬁed/recruited as follows.•PI’s current and prior ME/CFS patients may be eligible for the study.  PI [INVESTIGATOR_651180] a list of male and female patients who are between ages [ADDRESS_1238439] study visit.•PI’s waiting list of ME/CFS patients will be called, and if interested, will be screened for eligibility, and if eligible, invited to schedule the ﬁrst study visit.  •Study ﬂyers will be posted at PI’s clinic with the research coordinator’s contact [CONTACT_3031].  Patients who call will be screened for eligibility, and if eligible, invited to schedule the ﬁrst study visit.•Advertisements for the study will be posted on the Bateman Horne Center’s website.  Potential patients who contact [CONTACT_885254], and if eligible, invited to schedule the ﬁrst study visit.•The study team will also contact [CONTACT_885255]/CFS patients.  Such providers may refer patients to the study and may also post the study ﬂyers in their ofﬁces and advertisements on their websites.  Interested patients who contact [CONTACT_885254], and if eligible, invited to schedule the ﬁrst study visit.  •Patients will also be recruited using the website ResearchMatch, a registry with over 79,000 patients, created by [CONTACT_224063] & Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Consortium and funded by [CONTACT_885256].  Once recruitment access has been approved by [CONTACT_779] (with evidence of IRB-study approval), the research coordinator will search for matches among the patient proﬁles within the system and send a recruitment message to potential matches through ResearchMatch.  For those patients who authorize ResearchMatch to release their contact [CONTACT_3031], the research coordinator will contact [CONTACT_885257] a telephone screening. Such patients will be screened for eligibility, and if eligible, invited to schedule the ﬁrst study visit.Lucinda Bateman, MD  May 25, 2018, Amended July 3, 2018  /  Page  of 2324

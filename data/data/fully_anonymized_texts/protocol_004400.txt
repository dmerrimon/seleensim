accomplish this objective through the following specific aims:  
• Aim 1 (primary):  Determine the effect of a NaTI on biobehavioral stress 
responses of preterm infants during essential nursing care.  
• Aim 2: Identify factors to increase the feasibility of the NaTI as a nurse -
administered, integrated part of essential, procedural care. We will examine 
nurse -related factors that may affect the feasibility of intervention implementation 
in clinical practice for every epi[INVESTIGATOR_755577].  
• Aim 3 (exploratory):  Determine associations between biobehavioral responses 
and early neurobehavior . 
2.2 We hypothesize that the NaTI wi ll attenuate activation of the physiologic stress response 
systems.  
3.0 Background  
3.1 Infants born preterm experience neurodevelopmental impairment s in cognition3, motor 
function3, and language acquisition4,5. In the [LOCATION_002], 50% of cerebral palsy cases and 
8% of learning disabilities are attributable to preterm birth6. While many preterm infants 
receive early intervention services after neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) discharge, 
these services are costly and not available to all eligible infants7-9. Interventions during 
NICU hospi[INVESTIGATOR_755578], societal, and 
economic burdens of neurodevelopmental impairment in preterm infants.  
Stress exposure in the NICU is associated with abnormal brain development10-12 and 
cogn itive, motor, and behavioral neurodevelopmental impairment s13-16. Preterm infants 
experience an average of 7.5 -17.3 painful procedures17 and 22.97 acute stressors16 per day 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Seemingly benign procedures (e.g. diaper changes, repositioning) are 
among the most frequent stressors16,18 and are commonly clustered together during 
essential nursing care. Essential nursing care is a frequent, repeated stressor, typi[INVESTIGATOR_755579] 3 or 4 hours during the infant’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Most epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (86%) of 
essential care begin with an abr upt rather than a gradual approach18, without time for 
infants to acclimate. Because essential care is repeated, frequent, and abrupt, interventions 
targeting how essential care is provided may affect preterm infant stress responses and 
improve outcomes.  
Essential nursing care activates the sympathomedullary ( SAM ) pathway and hypothalamic -
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -adrenal ( HPA ) axis, resulting in measurable biobehavioral effects2,19-22. SAM 
pathway activation increases sympathetic nervous system ( SNS) activity and suppresses 
parasympathetic nervous system ( PNS ) activity in response to painful procedures23,[ADDRESS_1034337] activation can 
be measured as changes in vital signs (heart rate [ HR], respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] [ RR], oxygen 
saturation [ SpO2 ])27, HRV27, and SCRs24. The release of catecholamines from the adrenal 
medulla in response to SNS stimulation28 causes stimulation of the cardiac sinoatrial node 
and measurable changes in HR, RR, SpO2, and HRV27. HRV represents the beat -to-beat 
variations in HR, as measured by [CONTACT_941] R -R interval, and is sensitive to inputs from the SNS 
and PNS29,30. SCRs, produced by [CONTACT_755624]24, are valid measures of SAM pathway activation in 
PROTOCOL TITLE : Pi[INVESTIGATOR_755572]-Administered Touch and Biobehavioral Stress Responses of 
Preterm Infants (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_755573] -BIO Study)  
 [ADDRESS_1034338] weeks of life in infants born <[ADDRESS_1034339]-menstrual age ( PMA )31. Further, 
activation of the HPA axis causes a release of cortisol from the adrenal cortex28. Cortisol 
can be quantified from saliva28, providing a non -invasive measure that is highly correlated 
with blood levels32,33. Salivary cortisol levels increase in preterm infants in response to 
bathing26, routine handling34, and painful procedures34 and decrease in response to pain 
management interventions34. Early, repeated activation of the immature SAM pathway and 
HPA axis during essential caregiving may cause aberrant changes in the form of neural 
programming of these stress response systems, altering their function and contributing to 
NDI35. Neonatal HRV, for example,  is associated with childhood neurodevelopment36,[ADDRESS_1034340] and HPA axis in response to essential caregiving may be a 
consequence of the mismatch between the preterm infant’s neurologic expectation for 
touch and his/her NICU reality. The fetus in utero  experiences comforting touch from the 
surrounding amniotic fluid, uterine containment, and external touches to the mother’s 
abdomen38. Conversely, much of the touch experienced by [CONTACT_755625]39-42; preterm infants receive little comforting touch during their 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]18,[ADDRESS_1034341], during which mothers hold their diaper -clad infants between their breasts, 
reduces stress responses of preterm infants during painful procedures52,53 and increases 
PNS activity54. However, maternal presence in the NICU is minimal55, hindered by [CONTACT_755626]56. On average, mothers are present for 
50% of the days of their infant’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_755580] -to-skin care for 0.2 days 
each week55. With limited maternal presence, preterm infants receive little comforting 
touch18,41 -43. Nurses provide 87.8% of the direct contacts experienced by [CONTACT_755627], 
but only 3.5% of these contacts are comforting touch57. Clinician -administered touch 
interventions (i.e. massage therapy48,58 and Gentle Human Touch49,50,58,59) are effective in 
attenuating preterm infant stress responses and promoting neurodevelopment. However, 
these interventions require training and are typi[INVESTIGATOR_755581] a few minutes each 
day for a few days48,60,61. Comforting touch provided during specific painful procedures 
such as heel lance51,62,63 and endotracheal suctioning62,64 is effective in reducing the stress 
responses of preterm infants. A case study revealed that 5 seconds of comforting touch to 
gently awaken a preterm infant at 28 weeks PMA prior to essential care was associated 
with fewer stress behaviors during the care  epi[INVESTIGATOR_755582]2 
after the care65. 
PROTOCOL TITLE : Pi[INVESTIGATOR_755572]-Administered Touch and Biobehavioral Stress Responses of 
Preterm Infants (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_755573] -BIO Study)  
 7 HRP -503  v.12.10.18  Much research on preterm infants’ stress responses is limited by a narrow focus of 
measures and insufficient consideration of infant age. Many studies focus on behavioral 
responses and measures of either SAM pathway21-[ADDRESS_1034342] spectrum of measures needed for comparisons across studies are lacking. 
Also, many studies include multidimensional indices of pain/stress, scoring infants on 
behavioral cues, physiologic measures, and/or demographic characteristics (e.g. PMA)69. 
Such indices (e.g. Premature Infant Pain Profile, Neonatal Infant Pain Scale), are difficult 
to compare across studies and are complicated by [CONTACT_483014] (i.e. age69) and 
subjective interpretation of scores70. We will build on previous research by [CONTACT_35755] a 
broad spectrum of objective stress responses, including measures of SAM pathway and 
HPA axis activation.  
Previously conducted randomized controlled trials ( RCT s) testing the efficacy of 
comforting touch have a high risk for bias, resulting in low62 or very low70 quality evidence 
based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation 
system. Moreover, heterogeneity among trials makes it difficult to accurately determine 
effects48,62. Much of the bias in these studies results from failure to measure contextual 
factors (e.g. infant age, previous pain exposures)[ADDRESS_1034343], we will blind 
outcome assessors and analysts. Importantly, studies of touch interventions for painful 
procedures commonly use multidimensional indices of pain/stress62,63,[ADDRESS_1034344] of comforting touch during essential care. 
In a small study (n=12) of preterm infants, comforting touch was effective in reducing 
scores on the Premature Infant Pain Profile, a multidimensional index that i ncludes 
behavioral observations and vital signs72. However, this study used two caregivers to 
provide the intervention, which cannot be feasibly implemented for every epi[INVESTIGATOR_755583]’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]73. In addition, infant ages ranged 
from [ADDRESS_1034345] care ( SC) includes very 
little comforting touch74,75. PI [INVESTIGATOR_755584] 28 -31 weeks PMA experienced a 
median of 24 skin -breaking procedures (e.g. heel lance, venipuncture, venous cannulation) 
and 30 invasive procedures (i.e. skin -breaking procedures plus entrances into a body 
cavity) during th eir first 2 weeks of life76. Preterm infants also experienced numerous non -
painful stressors during essential care, including a median of 109 diaper changes, 104 
gavage feedings, and 79 epi[INVESTIGATOR_755585]77. Because infants experienced these 
PROTOCOL TITLE : Pi[INVESTIGATOR_755572]-Administered Touch and Biobehavioral Stress Responses of 
Preterm Infants (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_755573] -BIO Study)  
 [ADDRESS_1034346] of a touch intervention provided during preterm 
infant feedings75. Over 195 mean gavage feedings, infants in the experimental group 
received a touch experience on average 57% of the time versus 16% for infants in the 
control group; the touch varied from [ADDRESS_1034347]  
and HPA axis; repeated activation of these immature systems in the preterm infant results 
in aberrant programming, affecting brain structure and neurodevelopment35. We will test 
the short -term effect of the NaTI on the stress response systems and will build on this work 
in a future study by [CONTACT_755628]. 
We hypothesize that the NaTI will attenuate activation of t he SAM pathway and HPA axis 
(Fig 1). To determine the effect, we will measure a broad spectrum of stress responses ( HR, 
HRV, SRCs, cortisol), advancing the work of previous researchers who measured infant 
responses to specific procedures (e.g. heel lance51,62,63, endotracheal suctioning62,64) using a 
small number of biobehavioral measures. In contrast to other tested interventions, the NaTI 
requires no specialized training and a minimal time commitment (<5 minutes) from nurses 
and can be integrated as part of on -going essential care. The NaTI  addresses how routine, 
necessary care is delivered. While the positive effects of comforting touch are well known, 
comforting touch is not a routine part of essential nursing care.  
Routine comforting touch interventions may promote positive long -term outcomes for 
preterm infants by [CONTACT_755629], 
neurologically expected touch that promotes normal sensorineural development. In this  
study, we will test the preliminary effect of a  systematic  NaTI provided during essential 
nursing care on infant stress responses. This study is based on the scientific premise that 
comforting touch, provided through a systematic NaTI, meets the preterm i nfant’s 
neurologic expectation for touch and increases PNS activity, attenuating activation of the 
SAM pathway and HPA axis, and reducing the aberrant programming of these stress 
response systems.   
4.0 Study Endpoints

Preterm Infants (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_755573] -BIO Study)  
 9 HRP -503  v.12.10.18  4.1 Data collection to accomplish aims 1 & [ADDRESS_1034348] 
approximately six hours for each observation period . Particip ation will begin 
approximately three  hours prior to a scheduled care epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (i.e. data collection 
period) when monitoring electrodes are attached and will end approximately 2.5 
hours after the scheduled care epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (i.e. data collection period) when the next 
care epi[INVESTIGATOR_755586] . Infants will receive a 
neurobehavioral assessment at approximately [ADDRESS_1034349] between 5 -7 weeks, depending on infant 
PMA at birth and timing of the neurobehav ioral assessment.  
4.2 The NaTI will be stopped for infants experiencing bradycardia, defined as HR less 
than 100 beats per minute for 10 seconds, or oxygen desaturation, defined as 
oxygen saturation less than 85% for 10 seconds. To prevent the overstimulation of 
infants during intervention delivery, the NaTI will be stopped for tachycardia, 
defined as HR greater than 200 beats per minute for 10 seconds. NaTI delivery may 
resume with the next planned intervention point in the care but will be discontinued 
for the remainder of the  care for two  or more epi[INVESTIGATOR_1418], oxygen 
desaturation, or tachycardia  occurring during intervention delivery  as defined 
above.  A few infants may not tolerate the handling required to complete the 
neurobehavioral assessment. The Neurobehavioral Assessment of the Preterm 
Infant ( NAPI ) is intended to be administered in a specified, fixed sequence to 
minimize infant handling and potential distress. While we expect that infants at 35 
weeks PMA will not find the assessment distressing, for those who exhibit signs of 
distress (e.g. bradycardia, oxygen desaturation, inconsolable crying), the assessment 
will be terminated.   
5.0 Study Intervention/Investigational Agent  
5.1 Description. The NaTI is a systematic to uch intervention consisting of three  static, 
brief touches provided by [CONTACT_755630]. 
To provide the NaTI, nurses will cradle the top of the infant’s head with one hand, 
using their other hand to contain the infant’s lower body. Nurses will provide the 
touch for one  minute at the start of the care to allow infants time to acclimate to the 
stimulation, 30 second s after the diaper change, and one  minute at the conclusion of 
the care to provide a gradual end to the care and facilitate infant recovery and sleep. 
Nurses will provide the touches using bare hands (i.e. no gloves) to provide infants 
with human skin -to-skin contact [CONTACT_755631]. Nurses  often p rovide discretionary comforting touch, commonly 
referred to as hand containment  or facilitated tucking , in the same manner as the 
NaTI as part of their routine care  (NCH Patient/Family Care Policy 30:23). The 
NaTI differs from discretion ary comforting touch in that it is provided at specific 
points during the care and for a prescribed length of time. A member of the research 
team will be present during the care, perform timing for the intervention, and 
provide verbal instructions for nurs es to begin and end the NaTI.

Preterm Infants (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_755573] -BIO Study)  
 [ADDRESS_1034350] demographic and clinical data from the infant’s  electronic health record  
(EHR ) after enrollment and throughout the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Because stress 
responses may differ based on postnatal age81, data collection for stress responses 
will occur between [ADDRESS_1034351] care with a NaTI in a 
randomly assigned sequence. For the two observed care epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], we will require 
that nurses provide this care exclusively to limit confounding by [CONTACT_755632].  With assistance from the bedside nurse, the researcher, who is 
a Registered Nurse,  will attach monitoring electrodes for vital signs, HRV, and 
SCRs during the care epi[INVESTIGATOR_755587]  (Fig 2). Nurses 
commonly attach monitoring electrodes as part of their clinical practice.  
 

PROTOCOL TITLE : Pi[INVESTIGATOR_755572]-Administered Touch and Biobehavioral Stress Responses of 
Preterm Infants (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_755573] -BIO Study)  
 11 HRP -503  v.12.10.18  Measures, Aims 1:  
• SAM pathway activation. Heart rate  will be measured con tinuously during the 
observed care epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] , using external  monitors. HR, a measure of SNS response, is 
our primary outcome measure because nurses can use HR in clinical practice to 
identify SAM pathway activation. Heart rate variability , specifically high 
frequency HRV ( HF HRV ), provides an index of PNS activity and is generally 
reduced in response to internal or external stressors82. Continuous 
electrocardiogram ( ECG ) data during base line, care epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], and recovery will be 
collected  using external Holter monitors.  Electrodes for ECG data will be applied 
by [CONTACT_755633]. Raw ECG waveform data will be imported into Co -I Harrison’s 
MARS®  Ambulatory ECG A nalysis and Editing System (Ge neral E lectric, Inc.) 
and processed according to recommended protocols82,83. During processing, 
artifact will be eliminated with final calculations based on normal sinoatrial node -
initiated complexes. Analysis will include  HF HRV calculated in one -minute 
epochs averaged for each phase (i.e. baseline, care epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], recovery) . Skin 
conductance responses  will be measured  by [CONTACT_755634] ( Biopac Systems, Goleta,  CA) to one foot approximately 
three  hours prior to data collection  (i.e. during the epi[INVESTIGATOR_755588]) . Electrodes are connected to an amplifier to record SCR s 
during the entire observed care . At the beginning and end of each period (baseline, 
care epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], recovery), we will record ambient (i.e. room or incubator) and infant 
skin temperatures; ambient and skin temperatures <24⁰C and <32⁰C, respectively, 
may affect SCRs84,85.  
• HPA axis activation. Salivary cortisol  will be measured from saliva samples taken 
immediately prior to the start of care (baseline ), 30 minutes after the care has ended  
(post -care), and 60 minutes after the care has ended  (recovery; Fig 2) using  medical 
sponges gently introduced into the infant’s mouth. . We have previously used these 
sponges for saliva collection from preterm infants without causing infant distress. A 
member of the research team, who is a Registered Nurse, will collect saliva samples 
with the assistance  of the bedside nurse.  Saliva collection is non -invasive and  may 
be collected as part of  clinical practice  (test code XSCRT according to the NCH 
Laboratory Medicine website; see protocol Appendix).  We will batch process 
samples and quantify cortisol levels using a commercially available enzyme -linked 
immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ; Salimetrics, State College, PA) . 
• Recovery. We will measure infant recovery  by [CONTACT_755635][INVESTIGATOR_755589], 
tachycardia, oxygen desaturation , or other monitor alarms  during the 30 -minute 
recovery period following the epi[INVESTIGATOR_755590]. We will observe 
sleep behaviors to determine if the infant is awake, asleep, or drowsy during this 
30-minutes recovery period using the Anderson Behavioral State Scale (ABBS) . 
Behavioral data will be collected through observation without disturbing or 
handling the infant.  
• Context of care.  We will record the duration of the caregiving epi[INVESTIGATOR_755591]. We will use the acute scale of the Neonatal Infant Stressor 
Scale ( NISS )[ADDRESS_1034352] previously modified this measure to account for 
PROTOCOL TITLE : Pi[INVESTIGATOR_755572]-Administered Touch and Biobehavioral Stress Responses of 
Preterm Infants (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_755573] -BIO Study)  
 [ADDRESS_1034353] between a caregiver and infant and might include parent skin -to-skin care, 
interventions for apneic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], and adjustment of a respi[INVESTIGATOR_755592]. We w ill 
use these data to compare the context of care for infants between assigned 
conditions and will examine moderation of infant responses to care epi[INVESTIGATOR_755593].  
• Demographic and clinical data.  We will collect maternal demographic information 
and clinical data  including  age, race, prenatal medication s, labor/delivery 
complications and infant demographic and clinical data  including  sex, PMA, 
birthweight, clinical comorbidities, and medications at enrollment and throughout 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_755594] . We will record PMA based 
on first trimester ultrasound, if available, as this method of dating is most 
accurate69. Otherwise, we will use the best obstetric estimate, second/third trimester 
ultrasound, or postnatal assessment. In addition, we will record the pain score 
documented by [CONTACT_755636]. We will retrospectively collect 
data fr om the EHR  on the number of invasive procedures  (e.g. lab draws, 
intubations, intravenous line insertion) experienced by [CONTACT_755637][INVESTIGATOR_1865](s). Finally, we will collect clinical 
data from the EHR to calculate a Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology ( SNAP )-II, 
a validated measure of illness severity  for preterm infants that includes clinical data 
from the first 12 hours of life (blood pressure, temperature, oxygenation indices, 
serum pH, urine output, and presence of seizures)89. Finally, we will quantify the 
amount of parental skin -to-skin contact  [CONTACT_755638] (s). 
 
Optional infant photographs . With parental consent, we will take photographs of infants 
for use in future scientific and educational presentations. We will not disclose any 
information about these infants, but they may be identifiable by [CONTACT_755639]. 
Photographs will be stored on OSU’s password protected research server.  Parents may 
further opt to provide an email address where photographs may be sent for their personal 
use. 
Procedures. Aim 2. Nurses providing the NaTI to infants will be invited to 
participate in a survey study.  Those who choose to participate will complete a 
demographic questionnaire once and a NaTI survey, Acceptability of Intervention 
Measure ( AIM ), Intervention Appropriateness Measure  (IAM ), and Feasibility of 
Intervention Measure ( FIM ) each time he/she provides the NaTI  for a study infant. 
Nurses will be assigned study identification numbers (SIDs ) to track participation 
and to link nursing data to infant data.  We will provide phone/text reminders for 
nurses to complete and return the questionnaires.  
Measures, Aim 2: 
• Demographic questionnaire. This questionnaire will include baseline data on 
participating nurses such as age, sex, race, nursing education, and nursing 
experience.  
PROTOCOL TITLE : Pi[INVESTIGATOR_755572]-Administered Touch and Biobehavioral Stress Responses of 
Preterm Infants (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_755573] -BIO Study)  
 13 HRP -503  v.12.10.18  • NaTI survey.  This investigator -developed survey uses Likert -style ratings and 
open -ended questions to evaluate nurses’ experiences, attitudes, perceptions, and 
suggested improvements for the NaTI.  
• Acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility measures. Nurses will complete the 
Acceptability of Intervention Measure ( AIM ), Intervention Appropriateness 
Measure ( IAM ), and Feasibility of Intervention Measure ( FIM )90. Each measure 
includes four  Likert -style questions evaluating the degree to which respondents like 
the intervention, find the intervention useful, and believe that the intervention can 
be practically implemented.  
• Preliminary cost.  We will estimate preliminary cost of the intervention as part of 
the feasibility assessment using the nursing time required to deliver the intervention 
and nursing time and interventions required to respond to infant physiologic 
instability during the rec overy period.  
Procedures. Aim 3.  At approximately 35 weeks PMA, we will administer the NAPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_755595]. If discharge is anticipated prior to 35 weeks PMA, we will 
coordinate with clinical staff to perform the assessment prior to the infant’s 
discharge. For infants who are no t clinically stable based on nursing judgment or 
are requiring invasive ventilation or continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) at 
35 weeks PMA, we will delay the neurobehavioral assessment until the infant is 
clinically stable. Neurobe havioral assessments will be coordinated with the clinical 
staff so as not to interfere with clinical operations and will occur prior to a 
scheduled epi[INVESTIGATOR_755590].

• NAPI.  The NAPI [CONTACT_832] a neur obehavioral  assessment for preterm infants 
between 32 weeks PMA and term equivalent age 91. The assessment 
includes seven “clusters” – motor development and vigor, scarf sign,

and vigor of crying – that, together, define the developmental maturity of 
the preterm i nfant 92. A recently published systematic review of neonatal 
assessments concluded that the NAPI [INVESTIGATOR_755596] 93. The NAPI [INVESTIGATOR_755597] 93. The NAPI [INVESTIGATOR_755598] [ADDRESS_1034354] the privacy of infants and their parents , we will

 [ADDRESS_1034355]  (IRB) and are compliant with all 
required training in the protection of  human subjects.  
To minimize risks to the physical safety  of infants during the study, we are using 
only non -invasive methods to measure biobehavioral responses. HR and HRV will 
be measured using three infant -sized electrodes attached to the infant’s chest.  Two 
additional electrodes attached to the infant’s foot are required to measure SCRs. We 
will use the BIOPAC EL512 electrodes designed specifically for infants and will 
use moistened gauze to remove the electrodes after the observation period to 
minimize the risk of skin irritation. Infants with skin condition s that preclude the 
attachment of additional sensors will be excluded from the study. To minimize 
infant agitation, we will use medical swabs  attached to a handle  to collect saliva for 
salivary cortisol analysis.  These swabs are similar to those used for oral care in the 
NICU and are not distressing to infants.  
For the safe delivery of the NaTI , we have developed specific criteria to determine 
when the intervention should be stopped. The NaTI will be stopped for infants 
experiencing bradycardia, defined as HR less than 100 beats per minute for 10 
seconds, or oxygen desaturation, defined as oxyge n saturation less than 85% for [ADDRESS_1034356] -protected encrypted research server at the CON. The key linking names 
and SIDs, electronic and paper data forms, and consent forms will be stored in 
separate locations. Electronic access to the research server is restricted to the OSU 
CON local area ne twork or virtual private network by a Cisco ASA 5510 firewall.

from  parents prior to the initiation of any study procedure s. Parents will be given  
adequate time to consider participation in the study prior to providing written 
informed conse nt. Infant participants will not provide assent, as infants are 
developmentally unable to do so.  
Nurse participants.  Nurse participants may include pregnant women. This is a

80% participation, we expect up to 16  nurse responses.  
13.0 Recruitment Methods  
13.1 Infant participants.  After identifyi ng an eligible infant, study staff will meet with 
parents in the NICU or in the mother’s postpartum hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39223] t o introduce the 
study. Study staff will wait until parents have visited the NICU to see their infant 
and receive a medical update prior to attempt ing to contact [CONTACT_3654]. Study staff  will 
check with bedside caregivers in the NICU or the postpartum unit to ensure that it is 
an appropriate time to meet with parents. Dur ing the first meeting, study staff  will 
provide parents with an informational flier that outlines the study purpose and 
procedures. We will ask parents if it is a good time to discuss their infant’s 
eligibility  for a research study  and will conduct any follow -up discussion either in -
person or over the phone based on parental preference.  Study staff will provide a 
thorough overview of the study, including the study purpose, procedures, potential

observation and data collection. We will provide nurses with a $[ADDRESS_1034364] 
at the time of data collection each time they agree to complete a set of surveys.  
14.0 Withdrawal of Subjects*  
14.1 Infant participants may be withdrawn from the study if they become ineligible for 
participation based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria between the time that 
written informed consent is obtained from parents and the time that data collection 
commence s. Nurse participants will not be withdrawn from the study.  
14.2 If infants are withdrawn from the study prior to data collection, we will inform 
parents that their infant is no longer participating in the study due to pre-established 
inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
14.3 If infants are withdrawn from the study, previously collected data (i.e. demographic 
data) may be used but further data collection will cease.  
15.0 Risks to Subjects * 
PROTOCOL TITLE : Pi[INVESTIGATOR_755572]-Administered Touch and Biobehavioral Stress Responses of 
Preterm Infants (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_755573] -BIO Study)  
 [ADDRESS_1034365] reported 
infrequent occurrences of bradycardia, apnea, or desaturation associated with 
massage99,100. In a study of tactile stimulation in preterm infants 26 -32 weeks PMA, 
Fucile and Gisel (2010) paused the intervention for 1.1% of the administrations due 
to bradycardia, apnea, or oxygen desaturation. While these are possible risks in our 
study, we expec t the occurrence of bradycardia, apnea, and oxygen desaturation to 
be infrequent, especially given the static nature of the NaTI in contrast to the 
stimulation of massage or tactile stimulation.   
We will collect biobehavioral data from infants. HR and HRV  will be collected 
from monitoring equipment similar to that used as part of clinical care in the NICU. 
The collection of HR and HRV data will require the attachment of three additional 
ECG electrodes to the infant’s chest. If the infant’s chest is not large enough to 
accommodate the additional electrodes, electrodes for clinical monitoring can be 
moved to t he infant’s back at the nurse’s discretion. The additional ECG electrodes 
may cause mild eryt hema after removal, similar to the removal of electrodes used 
for clinical monitoring. SCRs  will require the attachment of two additional 
electrodes with isotonic gel to the infant’s foot. These electrodes may cause mild 
erythema after removal, similar to the removal of electrocardiogram electrodes used 
for clinical monitoring. Salivary cortisol  will be collected three  times during the 
observation period (prior to the start of the care epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], 30 minutes after the care 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] , 60 minutes after the care ep isode ) using small medical swabs similar to 
those used to provide oral care to preterm infants . The swab  will be gently 
introduced into the infant’s mouth and held securely using the attached handle.  
There are no expected risks to infants from the saliva collection. Protected health 
information  (PHI), including maternal prenatal data and infant clinical data, will be 
collected from each i nfant’s EHR . There is a small risk of loss of confidentiality.  
Nurse participants. Nurses will be asked to complete a demographic questionnaire 
once and an investigator -developed NaTI survey, the AIM90, the IAM90, and the 
FIM90 each time they provide the NaTI  to an infant. There is a small risk of loss of 
confidentiality for nurses who agree to participate.  Surveys  request nurse feedback 
on the intervention and will not include sensitive data . 
15.2 As part of the biobehavioral data collection, there may be risks to infant participants 
that are not foreseeable.  
15.3 If a pregnant nurse chooses to participant in the nursing survey study, there are no 
risks to her fetus.  
16.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects *

responses of preterm infants during essential nursing care. Our primary analysis 
will compare mean values of biobehavioral stress responses during an epi[INVESTIGATOR_755600] (comparison vs interventions conditions ). We will 
begin by [CONTACT_755644]. We will then compare the biobehavioral 
stress responses of infants assigned to each condition using linear mixed models to 
account for multiple observations within infants.  Additional variables may be added 
if potential confounding variables are identified between conditions , although none 
are anticipated. Secondary analyses will consider total area under the curve ( AUC ) 
for each biobehavioral response variable to identify important differences in overall 
recovery between conditions . For the primary (i.e. comparison of means during 
care) and secondary (i.e. comparisons of AUC) analyses, we will examine 
differences in outcomes by [CONTACT_755645] (e.g. infant sex) and will 
repeat the analysis, incl uding interactions to identify possible moderation of the 
effect by [CONTACT_755646], race, et hnicity, and PMA  at birth.  
Aim 2. We will use measures of central tendency and variance to describe nurses’ 
Likert responses. We will identify barriers and facilitators of intervention 
implementation for each epi[INVESTIGATOR_755601].  
Aim 3.  We will use correlation analysis and regression models to determine the 
associations between biobehavioral stress responses and neurobehavioral outcomes.

18.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety  of Subjects*  
18.1 A data safety and monitoring plan has been developed for this clinical trial.  
Purpose . The purpose of our data safety and monitoring plan ( DSMP ) is to 
safeguard the welfare of human subjects participating in the clinical trial through 
the regular review of safety data related to the intervention. The DSMP ensures that 
the research staff and principal investigator ( PI) follow specific guidelines with 
respect to accurate data management and the assessment and timely reporting of 
adverse events associated with the investigational study Nursing Touch and 
Biobehavioral Stress Responses of  Very Preterm Infants. The DSMP for the 
proposed study incorporates the Policies on Data and Safety Monitoring specifi ed 
by [CONTACT_246280], NCH , the IRB , the Office of Regulatory Knowledge and Support in the 
Center for Clinical and Translational Sci ence, and the OSU CON  Data Safety 
Monitoring Committee ( DSMC ).   
Data Safety Monitoring Committee . The DSMC is comprised of tenured faculty  
from the OSU CON  with expertise in the conduct and analysis of clinical trials in 
the acute care setting. Members of the DSMC include [CONTACT_755662], 
Distinguished Professor of Critical Care Research and Associate Dean of Research 
and Innovation; and [CONTACT_755663], Research Associate Professor and biostatistician . 
Members of the DSMC have no apparent conflicts of interest related to the 
proposed study and are not current collaborators of any study investigators. DSMC 
members will report arising conflicts of interest to fellow members and the study 
investigators. DSM C members who develop significant conflicts of interest will 
resign from the DSMC.  
DSMC members who leave OSU or resign their position prior to the conclusion of 
the clinical trial will be replaced with a new member appointed by [CONTACT_47203].  
Interim Monitoring Procedures . On a monthly  basis, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_755603].  The progress of the 
study will be monitored biannually  by [CONTACT_755647]. On a biannual basis, the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_58601] a written report on the progress of the study that will include data 
on: enrollment, comparison of target to actual enrollment, information on race, 
ethnicity, sex, overall status of the study participants, protocol deviations, and 
adverse or serious a dverse events. These data will be collected in a spreadsheet 
format and reviewed by [CONTACT_755648] ( Study PI). All reports will be reviewed by 
[CONTACT_104502] a biannual basis. After each report is reviewed, the Committee will 
recommend whether the study should continue, continue with modifications, or be 
terminated. PI [INVESTIGATOR_755604]. Co -I Pi[INVESTIGATOR_255102], who has extensive

 [ADDRESS_1034370] the occurrence of adverse events in real time. 
Adverse events ( AEs) will be reported immediately to the PI. Adverse events may 
also be identified by [CONTACT_755649], who are 
encouraged to alert the PI [INVESTIGATOR_54070]. During the consent process, participating 
nurses and parents of participa ting infants will be informed of the minimal risk 
nature of this study and e ncouraged to report any AEs immediately to study staff. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_755605] a description of 
AEs in the written report submitted biannually to the DSMC. Given the short -term 
duration of infant participation in the study, AEs will be tracked from the time that 
infant participation begins following the attachment of sensors for data collection 
and will continue until the end of the recovery period (i.e. [ADDRESS_1034371] touch of the care epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]).  
Definitions.  Adverse Event : Any unfavorable and unintended sign, regardless of 
whether it is considered related to the intervention; also an “unanticipated problem” 
of any nature (e.g., psychological or social harm; designated as unrelated, definitely 
related, probably related, or possible related; see below). Serious adverse event 
(SAE ): Any adverse event that is fatal or life threatening, is permanently disabling 
or requires prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Life-threatening event : Any adverse 
event in whi ch the subject is at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurs; does not include a reaction that, if it were to occur in a more serious form, 
might cause death. Unexpected event : Any adverse event that is not identified in 
nature, severity, or frequency in the study protocol or consent or the event was more 
serious than anticipated. Definitely Related : An adverse event that has a timely 
relationship to the administration of the investigational study procedure and follows 
a known pattern of resp onse for which no alternative cause is present. Probably 
Related : An adverse event that has a timely relationship to the administration of the 
investigational study procedure and follows a known pattern of response, but for 
which a potential alternative cause may be present. Possibly Related :  An adverse 
event that has a timely relationship to the administration of the investigational study 
procedure and follows no known pattern of response, but a potential alternative 
cause does not exist. Unrelated:   An a dverse event for which there is evidence that 
it is definitely related to a cause other than the investigational study procedure; in 
general no timely relationship to the administration of the procedure exists, or if so, 
the event does not follow a pattern  of response and an alternative cause is present.  
Grading scale for adverse event severity.  Mild:  Transient bradycardia (defined by 
[CONTACT_755650], usually heart rate <100 beats per 
minute), apnea, or oxygen desaturation requiring no intervention or an increase in 
supplemental oxygen. Bradycardia and oxygen desaturation are defined by [CONTACT_755651], usually heart rate <100 beats per minute or 
oxygen saturation <85% lasting 10 seconds.  Erythema resulting from monitoring 
electrodes.  Moderate : Bradycardia, apnea, or oxygen desaturation requiring an

intact skin) resulting from monitoring electrodes. Severe : Physiologic 
decompensation requiring intubation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation.  
Review of adverse events. The study investigators will provide an initial review of 
all AEs to the DSMC to determine their relatedness to the research and preliminary 
grading of severity. For each AE, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_755607], duration, intensity, 
treatment required, outcome an d action taken. SAEs are not expected to occur 
during this study. Possibly, probably, or definitely related AEs, as determined by 
[CONTACT_3476], will be reported within 24 hours to the DSMC chair for further 
review. The DSMC will  make the final determination on AE severity and 
relatedness.  
Reporting of adverse events. Final evaluation of relatedness and severity of AEs 
will be determined by [CONTACT_6802]. In accordance wit h NCH  IRB Adv erse Event 
Reporting Policy, an  AE is reportable to the IRB within 5 business days  if it meets 
all of the following criteria: (1) the event is unexpected, (2) the event is related or 
probably related to study participation, and (3) is serious and/or suggests that the 
research places subjects or others at a greater risk of physical or ps ychological harm 
than was previ ously known or recognized. A dditionally, per NCH  IRB policy, all 
protocol deviations or violations that harmed participants or indicate that others 
might be at increased risk of harm, breaches of confidentiality, and new  literature 
that may affect willingness to participate are reportable events within [ADDRESS_1034372] be reported annually with continuing review  include: (1) minor 
protocol deviations that do not indicate an increased risk of harm, and (2) AEs that 
are not serious or unexpected . After review by [CONTACT_402705], all reportable AEs will 
be submitted by [CONTACT_978] [CONTACT_373440] e NCH  IRB. Reportable AEs will be forwarded to the 
NIH/NINR Program Officer by [CONTACT_258317]. In addition, reportable AEs and the 
IRB acknowledgement letter  and cumulative reportable AEs, SAEs, and 
unanticipated problems  will be forwarded to the NIH/NINR Program Officer with 
the PI’s Annual Progress Report. .   
Assessment of External Factors . Because essential nursing care involves the 
handling of preterm infants, we do not expect 2.[ADDRESS_1034373] meeting, study staff  will ask

 [ADDRESS_1034376] the right to withdraw from the study at any time. If the 
same nurse is approached a second time for participation, study staff will remind 
him/her th at participation is completely voluntary.  
Informed consent from parents and nurses will be obtained following “SOP: 
Informed Consent Process for Research (HRP -090)”.  
Non-English Speaking Subjects  – if known, skip if not known  
• Study staff will recruit only English -speaking participants for the study.  
Subjects  who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers)  
• Consent for infant participation will be obtained from one of the infant’s 
biological parents or his/her legal guardian.  Parents who are  not yet adults are 
legally authorized to provide consent for their minor children. For this 
minimum  risk study, written informed consent will be required from one 
parent /legal guardian . If parents are unmarried without a paternity affidavit, 
consent will be obtained from the mother according to Ohio law.  Assent will 
not be obtained from infants, as infants are developmenta lly unable to provide 
assent.  
• Consent for nurse participation will be obtained from nurses, who are legal 
adults and able to provide consent for themselves.  
23.0 Process to Document Consent in Writing  
23.1 Study staff will follow “SOP: Written Documentation of Consent (HRP -091)” to 
document consent in writing  for infant and nurse participants.  
 
24.0 Setting  
24.1 Infant participants will be identified through periodic screening of the EHR. Infants 
will be recruited either in the NCH NICUs or in the mother’s postpartum hospi[INVESTIGATOR_176340]. Nurse participants will be recruited during their normal working hours in the 
NCH N ICUs.  
All study procedures will take place in the NCH NICUs. Surveys for nurse 
participants will be distributed in the NICU, but nurses may take these home and 
return them during their next scheduled shift.  
Data storage and analysis and sample processing, storage, and analysis will take 
place at the OSU CON.  
The study protocol will be submitted to the NCH and OSU IRBs. OSU is expected 
to cede review to NCH. IRB oversight for the study will be provided by [CONTACT_755653].

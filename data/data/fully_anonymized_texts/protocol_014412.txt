Type of Study  
- Questionnaire/survey study followed by [CONTACT_812018]  
- Investigator initiated  
 
Introduction/background  
Exclusive breastfeeding, feeding infants only breast milk, for  the first six months of life is 
recommended by [CONTACT_21978]. The benefits to exclusive breastfeeding 
are numerous for both infant and mother. Direct benefits  include, but are not limited to, 
improvement of gastrointestinal function a nd host dense of the infant, prevention of acute 
illnesses in the infant, and reduced risk of breast cancer and type 2 diabetes mellitus with 
lowered cardiovascular risk in the mother [1].  
Due to the many known health benefits of breastfeeding, the Depart ment of Health and Human 
Services includes several breastfeeding objectives as a part of its Healthy People 2020 plan. 
These include increasing the proportion of infants who are breastfed to 81.9%, exclusively 
breastfed through 3 months to 46.2%, and exclusively breastfed through 6 months to 25.5% [2]. 
As of 2016, the rates for these objectives were 81.1%, 44.4% and 22.3% respectively [3]. The 
fact that breastfeeding initiation rates are high while rates of exclusive breastfeeding at 3 and 6 
months are significantly lower demonstrates that mothers may not be receiving adequate 
education and the necessary support for continued breastfeeding.  
To promote exclusive and continued breastfeeding, the World Health Organization and United 
Nations Children’s Fund pre viously developed a global program known as the Baby [CONTACT_812019][INVESTIGATOR_812002] -supportive maternity practices or steps. To 
achieve designation as “Baby -Friendly,” hospi[INVESTIGATOR_812003], and comply with the 
International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk substitutes. Step 3 is to “inform all pregnant 
women about the benefits and management of breastfeeding” through prenatal intervention [4].  
To date, many studies have investigated the effectiveness of several forms of prenatal 
intervention. Bonuck et al. evaluated the effectiveness of prenatal visits with lactation 
consultants and/or electronically prompted guidance from prenatal care providers. The study 
found that the use of these interventions increased brea stfeeding intensity at 3 months 
postpartum [5]. Another study by [CONTACT_812020]. evaluated the effectiveness of a structured 
prenatal training program for women mid- pregnancy. The study found that the intervention 
group breastfed significantly longer than the control group [6]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_812004], they have some significant limitations. The interventions were 
considerably time consuming and required the use of breastfeeding specialists. In addition, these 
studies focus ed primarily on improving breastfeeding education rather than identifying and 
implementing avenues of support for mothers.  
One simple method of support that is currently used by [CONTACT_812021] a 
champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]. A champi[INVESTIGATOR_812005]. Although there are organizations that 
specifically train individuals to become champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458], one organization, Coffective, advocates that 
any person  trusted by [CONTACT_812022][INVESTIGATOR_2394], regardless of experience [7]. No research 
to date has investigated if this method has a positive effect on exclusive breastfeeding intention. 
Another simple method of support used by [CONTACT_510599], such as Women, Infants, and Children 
(WIC), is positive messaging [8]. Positive messaging aims to improve intention to exclusive 
breastfeed by [CONTACT_812023]. 
Although used widely, no research to date h as explored its effectiveness.

Recruitment:  
We will review the daily prenatal care schedules of the WHC and Mac1200. The primary care 
providers responsible for the clinic will be asked if it is appropriate to approach potential 
participants who meet inclusion criteria  and do not meet exclusion criteria . If appropriate to 
approach, then eligible potential participants ages 18 years and above will be approached in a 
private setting (their exam room) and asked if possibly interested in the study. If interested, the 
Informed Consent document will be presented and explained (see Informed Consent process). 
For approachable and eligible expectan t mothers ages 14- 17 years, their guardian will be 
approached in a private area and we will briefly explain the study (see verbal script) and request 
permission to approach the expectant minor. If permission is granted then the minor will be 
approached as above, and we will explain the study in a private setting to both the guardian and 
the minor using the Informed Consent document (see Informed Consent process).  
 
Subject Informed Consent/Assent/Parental Permission

Since PHI will be collected, the research assistant will provide and discuss an informed consent 
form with the participant.  
The informed consent form will describe the survey topic, length and rational for the study, and 
the types of PHI th at will be collected.  
The research assistant will answer any questions the potential participant has.  
If the participant is under 18 years of age, the adult guardian will be approached to obtain 
permission to approach the minor  (see verbal script) , and the n the minor potential participant will 
be approached to obtain written assent/consent.  
All p articipants who agree to complete the questionnaire and to participate in the study will sign 
the informed consent form. 
Participants who agree to complete the questionnaire and are under the age of 18 will sign the 
informed consent form as assent to the study , as will their guardian . 
All participants and the guardians of minor participants will be provided with a copy of the 
informed consent form.

Pre-test survey  (see pretest survey document ) 
Provision of intervention 
Post-test survey (see posttest survey  document)  
Follow -up chart review  (participant medical record and baby [CONTACT_38825]  - see below )  
 
 
Patient Enrollment and Survey Administration :  
The primary care provider responsible for the clinic will be asked to determine if it is appropriate 
to approach the potential participants. After informed consent is obtained, the pretest survey will 
be administered on a UH encrypted tablet. The subject h as the option of completing the survey 
herself on the tablet while the researcher waits, or she can have the researcher read her the 
questions and complete the responses on her behalf (her choice of completion style will be 
documented). The researcher will  not leave the room both since the tablet is study property, and 
also so any questions about the survey can be answered. The subject can skip any questions that 
she chooses not to complete for any reason. Once the pretest survey is completed, one of the tw o 
interventions (Appendix A and B) will be preformed on the UH encrypted tablet with guidance 
from the researcher. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_812013]. Once the participant has completed the intervention, the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_172155] a  short teach back with the participant ( Appendix A and B scripts) . Next, a  handout 
(one for each intervention) that summariz es the interventions will be given to the participant so 
that the she  can take info rmation home with her. The participant can ask questions at any time 
during the interventions. Finally, the subject will complete the posttest survey. The subject will 
receive her participation gift following completion of the intervention and return of th e tablet. 
The researchers are not involved in the care of the woman, and will promptly defer to any 
procedures or time requests of the treating providers. 
 
Data Collection Tool :  
The pretest and posttest surveys will be administered electronically using a UH encrypted iPad 
and data will be directly entered into the REDCap system. The pretest will be administered 
before the intervention is given and the posttest will be administered  on the same day after the 
intervention is given. The interventions and pre - and posttests will take no longer than [ADDRESS_1124447] survey contains 3 sections and will take approximately 2 minutes to complete.  
o Section 1: Identifiers (MRN, DOB, name)  – completed by [CONTACT_264416]  
o Section 2: Demographic Information

Medical records review will be completed electronically after participants have delivered. This 
review will begin [ADDRESS_1124448] expected due date for each intervention group. Data 
collected from the participant’s medical records and from the baby’s medical records will 
include:  
o Participant’s medical record  
o Infant birth weight, gestational age, sex, singleton vs multiple, NICU vs not  
o 2 weeks postpartum feeding choice if recorded  
o Baby’s medical records  
o Postpartum discharge (in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) feeding method  
o 2 weeks postpartum feeding method  
 
Risks:  
There are no physical risks to subjects. There is a small risk of loss of confidentiality related to 
PHI and personal beliefs, which  is protected against with careful data handling and encryption of 
the iPad on which questionnaires will be administered. There is also small risk of embarrassment 
answering personal questions related to feeding. Due to the sensitive nature of questions, 
participants will be informed they are not required to answer any questions that they are not 
comfortable disclosing answers to. No separate visit or expense is required. Questionnaires will 
be administered during  normal office wait time or at the conclusio n of participants’ scheduled 
clinic visit.  
 
Benefits:  
There may be  direct benefits to study participants  although this cannot be guaranteed.  
The study will improve general knowledge regarding the effectiveness of prenatal breastfeeding 
interventions on exc lusive breastfeeding intention, and thus may inform future decisions about 
intervention best practices. 
 
Alternatives to participation  
The alternative is to choose to not participate.  
If subjects do not wish to participate in the study, it will not affect their care in any way.  
 
Withdrawal from study participation  
Subjects may choose to discontinue or withdraw at any time.  
 
Plans for subjects at the end of the protocol  
Subjects will continue their routine medical care;  the study does not provide any care so no 
transition plan is necessary. Should participants request more information or have questions that 
arise following completion of the questionnaire, we will refer them to their providers and make 
the provider aware (with the participant’s permission) tha t she has a question.  
 
Data Safety and Monitoring 
Plan : The PI (Rebecca Farr) and Dr . Lydia  Furman will meet every two weeks to monitor the 
data for accuracy, completeness and adherence to the protocol.  
 
Is there a formal data and safety monitoring board/committee?  No 
 
How will data be maintained ?  
- Electronic subject files  
- Hard copy subject files (signed consent forms)  
 
Data will be maintained in REDCap which is a data capture system that fully protects identifiers 
and data. Only the study team will have access. Consent forms will be kept in a locked cabinet in 
[CONTACT_812028]’s office.  
 
How long will research data be stored by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_812014]?  [ADDRESS_1124449]. The research assistant will indicate that the participant is free to 
discontinue the presentation and decline to participate at any time. If the participant agrees to 
participate in the study, she will sign an informed consent form that includes discussion of the 
PHI collected in the study.  
 
Data/sample confidentiality  
PHI will be included with questionnaires so that follow -up medical record review may be 
completed at a later date. Sur veys and interventions will be administered electronically with a 
UH encrypted iPad and data will be directly entered into the REDCap system, which secures PHI 
and can and will only be accessed by [CONTACT_3476]. Paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_812015]’s person while in clinic, and placed in a locked cabinet 
accessible only to the study team after leaving clinic in [CONTACT_812028]’s office.  
 
Data/sample security  
REDCAP is a secure system and will only be accessed on a pass word protected computer  and 
UH encrypted iPad , and accessed only by [CONTACT_3476].  
Paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_812016]’s person while in 
clinic, and placed in a locked cabinet accessible only to the study team after  leaving clinic.  
The locked cabinet will be located in the locked office of Dr . Furman, room 784 of old Rainbow.  
 
Data Analysis Plan  
Sample size considerations:  
Aim #[ADDRESS_1124450] that hypothesis. This will be considered a hypothesis  generating study and feasibility of 
enrollment will determine the sample size. We will approach all eligible women during 2 -month 
study period. We anticipate that approximately 31 women per week will be eligible, of whom 
approximately 80% will agree to pa rticipate, and over a 2 -month study period, 250 women could 
be enrolled.  
 
Analysis plan:  
Nominal variables will be described using frequencies and percentages. Normally distributed 
continuous variables will be described using means and standard deviations, and non- normally 
distributed continuous variables will be described using medians and IQ Rs (interquartile ranges). 
We will compare nominal variables, e.g. those who received differing interventions (champi[INVESTIGATOR_812017]) using Chi squared analyses or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. 
Distributionally appropriate two- sample tes ts will be used to compare continuous variables. 
Additional analyses may be carried out as the data indicate, and will be considered exploratory.  
 
 
Financial Information  
Will subjects receive incentive/reimbursement/compensation?  Yes 
Other: Participants will receive a book and an infant toy, with a combined value of $2.20, as a 
token of thanks for their participation.  
 
Payments to subjects  
No financial compensation to subjects. 
We plan to provide a book and an infant toy as a small token of thanks to subjects upon agreeing 
to participate.  
 
Cost to subjects  
There are no costs to subjects.  
 
Compensation for research related injuries:  
Questionnaire and medical record review study with extremely low risk of any adverse event.

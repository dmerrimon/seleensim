2. BACKGROUND  AND  RATIONALE 
 
2.1 Seconda ry Hyperpara thyroidism  in Pediatric  Subjects  
 
Secondary  hyperparath yroidism (SHPT)  develops relati vely early  in the course of CKD, 
worsens with declining  renal  function, and is common ly associated  with serious 
compli cations both in adults and in children  on dialysis. CKD  in childre n, as in adults, is 
a devastating  illness. In children  with CKD,  grow th retardati on is a prominent  finding  and 
 
SHPT  is an important  contributor  to this disorder  (Kuizon et al, 1999 ). 
 
In both the United  States  (US)  and Europe,  there  are few children  with CKD  on dialysis 
compared  with the adult  population.  The rate of Stage  5 CKD in children  was estimated 
at 15.2 per million  popu lation  in the US over the 2007 -2011  time period.  This correla tes 
with 6800  incident  children with Stage  5 CKD  reported  during  this same time period 
(USRDS, 2013). Data  from the publi shed 2011  European  Renal  Association -European

Children  on dialysis experien ce similar laborato ry disturban ces with regards to 
parath yroid hormone  (PTH), serum  calcium (Ca) and phosphorous  as adults  
(Bacchetta  et al, 2012 ). Traditional  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_461336]  (eg, vitamin D sterols) are widely 
used in the pediatric  dialysis popula tion, but are sometimes  insufficient to manage  SHPT 
due to their potential  to increase serum calcium and phosphorus.

A survey conducted among  18 sites belonging  to North  American Pediatric Renal  Trials 
and Collab orative Services (NAPR TCS) (NAPRTCS,  unpubli shed data), included  data 
from 320 pediatric  hemodial ysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD)  patient s, between  the 
ages  of 2 to less than 18. The results show that overall, 49% of the pediatric dialysis 
population  has intact parathyroid hormone  (iPTH) levels above 300 pg/mL (31.8  pmol/L), 
the upper  limit recommended  by [CONTACT_461365]-K/DOQI™  guidelines for all pediatric  age 
groups  (NKF -KDOQI™,  2005).  
 
Publi shed pediatric  CKD -MBD guidelines  markedly differ  with respect to the 
recommen ded PTH target  range s. For children  with stage 5 CKD,  the guidelines 
recommend  targets  in the range  between  120 and 540 pg/mL  (Klaus  et al, 2006; 
NKF KDOQI, 2005;  KDIGO  CKD -MBD Working Group,  2009 ). None  of these 
recommen dations  has been validated  in a large  pediatric  stage [ADDRESS_590005]-in-class calcimimetic  agent  that acts as an allosteric modulator  of the 
calcium sensing receptor (CaSR)  located on the surface of the parath yroid chief cell, 
increasing the sensitivity of the CaSR to extracellular  calcium. Cina calcet has been 
shown  to be safe and efficacious in simultaneou sly controlling  PTH,  calcium, and 
phosphorus  in the adult  dialysis population.  Cinacalcet was initially appro ved in 2004  by 
[CONTACT_461366]  (FDA)  for the treatment  of SHPT  in adult  patients 
with CKD  receiving dialysis. As of 28 February  2014,  cinacalcet is approved for this 
indication  in 67 countrie s. Cinacalcet is not approved for use in pediatric  patients  in any 
countr y.

cinacalcet in the double -blind  interventional  study in the presence of severe 
hypocalcemia.  While  the cause of death was multi-factoral,  severe hypocalcemia  was 
observed and a role of cinacalcet could not be excluded.  
 
Additional  risk mitigation  measures implemented  in this trial include:  
 
• collection of real-time ionized calcium measurem ents, 
• weekly monitoring  of calcium, 
• incorporati on of local laboratory  total calcium values  into the dosing schema,  
• subject investigational  product (IP) complian ce measures, 
• dispensing limited  quantities  of IP to minimi ze the potential  for overdosing 
• addition  of exclusionary  electrocardiogram  (ECG) criteria  
 
A dosing strategy,  using a weight -based starting  dose of ≤ 0.2 mg/kg in pediatric 
subjects, which is approximately  50% below  the adult  starting dose, will be emplo yed in 
this study. The dose of cinacalcet will be titrated based on iPTH, corrected calcium 
(cCa) levels, ionized calcium, and subject safety  information.  The maximum dose in this 
study will be 2.5 mg/kg/day  based on day 1 dry weight,  not to exceed a dose of

other  adverse event that warrants  IP dose withho ld, the dose of cinacalcet will be 
reduced or discontin ued as appro priate.  Vitamin  D sterols, calcium supplementation 
and/or  calcium-based phosphate  binders  can be used to raise serum  calcium levels and 
should  be admini stered  as appropri ate per individual clinic practice. Training and 
informational  tools  will be provided to investigators for dissemination  to care givers and 
subjects regarding  the symptoms and risks of hypocalcemia.  
 
Volumes  of blood  withdrawn  for analysis will be minimi zed as appropria te for this

[IP_ADDRESS].1  Subjects  From  Study 20130356  
 
On day 1 of Study  20140159,  subjects from the SOC  arm in 20130356  will receive the 
initial  dose of cinacalcet as defined  in Section [IP_ADDRESS].1.1  
 
Subje cts from the cinacalcet arm with ≤ [ADDRESS_590053] dose at EOIP  and will follow the dose adjustments  outlined  in Table  1 in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].1.1 . Dose titration  cannot  occur until week  4 per Table  1. If subjects 
from the cinacalcet arm in 20130356  are on a dose that was withheld  or missed 
for > 14 days and ≤ 1 month at day 1 of Study  20140159,  the iPTH  and cCa restart 
values  (iPTH  > 150 pg/mL  and cCa > 8.4 mg/dL)  must be reached prior to resuming 
cinacalcet will receive the initial  dose of cinacalcet in the current extension study outlined 
in Table  1 in Section [IP_ADDRESS].1.1 . 
 
Subje cts from the cinacalcet arm with > [ADDRESS_590054] dose of cinacalcet 
treatment  in Study  20130356  and Study  20140159  day 1, will receive the initial  dose of 
cinacalcet as defined  in Section [IP_ADDRESS].1.1.  To commen ce dosing, all subjects must 
have: 
 
• ionized calcium ≥ 1.05 mmol/L  prior to initiation  of treatment  on day 1 in this 
study 
• iPTH  value ≥ 300 pg/mL  within  7 days of day 1 
• corrected calcium value ≥ 8.8 mg/dL  within  7 days of day 1 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.1  Dosage  Adjustments  
 
The initial  dose of cinacalcet and all subsequent  doses will be calculated by [CONTACT_461372]/IWR  system. Subje cts from the SOC arm will start at the initial 
cinacalcet dose of 0.20 mg/kg/day, based on the subject’s dry weight  at day [ADDRESS_590055] PSD.  
 
Subje cts from the cinacalcet arm with ≤ [ADDRESS_590056] dose of cinacalcet 
treatment  in Study  20130356  and day 1 of Study  20140159  will start cinacalcet dosing at 
the same dose they received at the completion  of the EOIP  visit and follow weekly dose 
adjustment  based on the Table  1. For subjects from the cinacalcet arm with > [ADDRESS_590057]:  Cinacalcet  hydrochloride

Study  20140159,  the initial dose of cinacalcet will be 0.20 mg/kg/day, based on the 
subject’s dry weight  at day [ADDRESS_590059] PSD,  will be 
assigned.  
 
Dose adjustments  for subjects receiving cinacalcet will be assessed at each weekly visit 
during  the treatment  period.  The daily dose of cinacalcet may only be increased at 
monthly  titration  visits (week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24); it can’t be increased at any other 
time during  the treatment  period.  At all weekly visits (including week  4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 
and 24), the dose may be maintained,  reduced or withheld  based upon  the dose 
adjustment  criteria  in Table 1. 
 
If any of the criteria  for dose withhol ding are met at any time during  the trial, including 
between  scheduled  study visits (ie, unschedul ed), the dose of cinacalcet is to be 
withheld  until all of the following  criteria are met: 
 
• central  laboratory  corrected calcium value is >8.4 mg/dL  
• iPTH  is > 150 pg/mL  
• ionized calcium is >1.05mmol/L  
• subject has no sympto ms of hypocalcemia  
 
• subject doesn’t have any ongoing  adverse event(s) which warrant  withholding  of 
cinacalcet. 
 
If a subject dose is being withheld,  ionized calcium levels should  be assessed weekly 
until an ionized calcium of ˃1.05 mmol/L  is obtained,  at which point,  cCa and iPTH 
should  be assessed by [CONTACT_461373] y. 
 
Once all the restart criteria above are met, cinacalcet may be restarted  at one PSD 
below  the previous dose received. Subje cts receiving the lowest PSD (2.5 mg) who 
require  a dose reduction will have their dose withheld  until the criteria  for maintaining  or 
increasing the dose are met, at which time they will restart dosing at 2.5 mg/da y. 
 
If subjects require  temporary  admin istration  of concomitant  medi cations  that are known 
to prolong  the QTc interval, are CYP3A4  inhibito rs, or are CYP2D6  substrates, the 
admini stration of IP is to be withhel d. The dose may be restarted  at one PSD below  the 
previous dose once the treatment  with the concomitant  medication  has completed  and 
all of the restart criteria  above are met. 
 
If IP has been withheld  or missed for > [ADDRESS_590060] will resume dosing at the 
starting  dose level once (initial  dose in parent  Studies  2013 0356 or 20110100)  all restart

reached before resuming  cinacalcet in Study  20140159.  
 
Dose adjustments  for subjects receiving cinacalcet will be assessed at each weekly visit 
during  the treatment  period.  The daily dose of cinacalcet may only be increased at 
monthly  titration  visits (week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24); it can’t be increased at any other 
time during  the treatment  period.  At all weekly visits (including week  4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 
and 24), the dose may be maintained,  reduced or withheld  based upon  the criteria  in 
Table  3. 
 
If any of the criteria  for dose withhol ding are met at any time during  the trial, including 
between  scheduled  study visits (ie, unschedul ed), the dose of cinacalcet is to be 
withheld  until all of the following  criteria are met: 
 
• central  laboratory  corrected calcium value is >8.4 mg/dL  
• iPTH  is >150  pg/mL 
• ionized calcium is >1.05  mmol/L  
• subject has no sympto ms of hypocalcemia  
 
• subject doesn’t have any ongoing  adverse event(s) which warrant  withholding  of 
cinacalcet. 
 
If a subject dose is being withheld,  ionized calcium levels should  be assessed weekly 
until an ionized calcium of ˃1.05 mmol/L  is obtained,  at which point,  cCa and iPTH 
should  be assessed by [CONTACT_461373] y.

[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_590084] misses > 14 consecutive doses of cinacalcet for any reason, including 
temporary  dose withhol ding due to the admini stration  of concomitant  medications as 
noted  above, they will be restarted  at their initial dose of cinacalcet (0.20  mg/kg/day 
based on dry weight  at day 1 in Study  20140159)  when  admini stration  of IP resumes  per 
the dose titration  guide lines outlined  in Table  1, Table  2, and Table  3. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Measures  of Compliance  With  Cinacalcet  Administration  
 
Poor  complian ce and/or  intermittent  dosing or ingestion of cinacalcet may lead to 
changes  (ie, increases or decreases) in iPTH  and calcium concentrations  that do not 
conform  to those seen in clinical trials where  subjects have consistently received daily 
doses of cinacalcet. Increases in iPTH can be interpreted  to be a result of 
subtherape utic dosing leading  to increases in cinacalcet doses which may result in 
potentially  severe hypocalcemia,  particularly  in the setting  of intermittent  ingestion of IP. 
 
Electronic  patient  diaries (eDiar y) and IP accountability  information  will be reconciled 
and utilized in this study to document  subject complian ce with daily admini stration  of 
cinacalcet therapy. The data entered  into the eDiary  will be available  to the investigator 
and/or  study coordinator  on a daily  basis to enable ongoing  reviews of subject 
complian ce. The eDiary  and IP accountability  data collected will be reviewed  with the 
subject and/or their parent(s) or legal  guardian( s) by [CONTACT_54075]/or study 
coordinator  during  the weekly study visits. 
 
For this study non-compliance is defined as: 
 
• missing > 2 doses within  any dosing week, or 
• ≥ 2 documented overdoses within  a dosing week  
• other indicators of non-complian ce per physician judgment  
 
If a subject is considered to be non-compliant,  the dose of cinacalcet should not be 
increased and addition al counseling should  be provided about  the importan ce of taking 
the study medication  as prescribed.  It will also be documented  on the eCRF.  The 
additional  counseling  should  be documented  in the subject’s source document s. If the 
subject remains  non-compliant,  removal from IP dosing should be considered.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Overdose  
 
An overdose of cinacalcet will be defined as receiving any dose greater  than the 
assigned  daily dose. This can cause hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia  may cause anxiety, 
muscular crampi[INVESTIGATOR_461340], twitching,  tingling, paresthesias around  the mouth  or

If an overdose is suspected, the [COMPANY_010]  Study  Manager,  [COMPANY_010]  Medi cal Monitor,  and/or 
[COMPANY_010]  Clinical Safety  repre sentati ve should  be contact[CONTACT_11252] 24 hours  of discovery. 
For subjects in whom  an overdose is suspected, close moni toring  for signs and 
symptoms of hypocalcemia and appropriate  measures (eg, including  intravenous  
calcium gluconate  and more  frequent  monitoring  of calcium levels) should  be considered 
by [CONTACT_461374].  
 
Once hypocalcemia  and any symptoms associated with the overdose have resolved, 
subjects resume cinacalcet admini stration  dose. To resume dosing, the subject must 
meet  the dosing restart criteria  for his/her respective age group  as specified in 
Sections  [IP_ADDRESS].1,  6.2.3 .1.2.1 , and [IP_ADDRESS].2.2 .

7.5 Sample  Storage  and Destruction  
 
Any blood  or biomar ker sample  collected according to the Schedule  of Assessments 
(Table  4) can be analyzed for any of the tests outlined  in the proto col and for any tests 
necessary to minimi ze risks to study subjects. This includes  testing to ensure analytical 
methods  produ ce reliab le and valid data throughout  the course of the study. This can 
also include,  but is not limited  to, investigation  of unexpected results, incurred  sample 
reanal ysis, and analyses for method  transfer and comparabilit y. 
 
All samples  and associated results will be coded prior to being shipped  from the site for 
analysis or storage.  Samples  will be tracked using a unique  identif ier that is assigned to 
the samples  for the study. Results are stored  in a secure database to ensure 
confidenti ality. 
 
If permitted  by [CONTACT_461378]’s legally 
acceptable  representati ve(s), [COMPANY_010]  can do additional  testing on remaining  samples  
(ie, residual  and back-up) to investigate and better under stand the CKD  and SHPT,  the 
dose response and/or  prediction of response to cinacalcet, and characterize aspects of 
the mole cule (eg, mechanism of action/target,  metabolite s). Results from this analysis 
are to be documented  and maintained,  but are not necessarily reported  as part of this 
study. Samples can be retained  for up to [ADDRESS_590123]’s medi cal record and are not to be 
made  available to the subject, members  of the family, the personal physician, or other 
third partie s, except as specified in the informed  consent. 
 
The subject retains  the right to request that the sample  mate rial be destroyed by 
[CONTACT_21947]. Follow ing the reque st from the subject, the investigator  is to 
provide the sponsor with the requi red study and subject number  so that any remain ing 
blood  samples  and any other  components  from the cells can be located and destroyed. 
Samples  will be destroyed once all protocol-defined procedures are completed.

The sponsor is the exclusive owner  of any data,  discoveries, or derivative materials  from 
the sample  materials  and is responsible for the destruction of the sample( s) at the 
reque st of the subject through  the investigator,  at the end of the storage  period, or as 
appropriate  (eg, the scientific rationale for experimentation  with a certain  sample  type no 
longer  justifies keepi[INVESTIGATOR_461345]).  If a comme rcial produ ct is developed from this 
research project, the sponsor owns  the comme rcial produ ct. The subject has no 
commer cial rights  to such produ ct and has no commer cial rights  to the data, information,

Section 11.[ADDRESS_590125] the right to withdraw  from the study at any time and for any reason 
without  prejudice to their future  medi cal care by [CONTACT_8018].  
 
Subje cts (or a legally  acceptable  representati ve) can decline to continue  receiving IP 
and/or  other  proto col-required  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_461346]. If this occurs, the investigator is to discuss with the 
subject the appropriate  processes for discontinuation  from IP or other  proto col-requi red 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_461347] (Table  4) and collection of data, including  endpoints  and adverse 
events. The investigator  must document  the change  to the Schedule  of Assessments 
(Table  4) and the level of follow -up that is agreed to by [CONTACT_423] (eg, in person, by 
[CONTACT_756]/mail,  through  family/friend s, in corresponden ce/communi cation  with other 
physicians, from review of the medi cal records). 
 
Withdrawal  of consent for a study means  that the subject does not wish to receive 
further  proto col-required  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_461348] s, and the subject does  not wish to or is 
unable  to continue  further study participation.  Subject data up to withdrawal  of consent 
will be included in the analysis of the study, and where  permitted,  publicly available  data 
can be included after withdrawal  of consent. The investigator  is to discuss with the 
subject appropriate  procedures  for withdrawal  from the study.

The definiti on of adverse events includes worsening of a pre-existing medi cal condition. 
Worsening  indicates that the pre-existing medi cal conditi on (eg, diabet es, migraine 
heada ches, gout)  has increased in severity, frequency, and/or  duration,  and/or  has an 
association with a significantly  worse outcome.  A pre-existing condition  that has not 
worsened  during  the study or involves an intervention  such as elective cosmetic  surgery 
or a medi cal procedure  while  on study is not considered  an adverse event.

The investigator’s  clinical judgment  is used to determine  whether a subject is to be 
remo ved from treatment  due to an adverse event. In the event a subject, or subject’s 
legally  acceptable  representati ve reque sts to withdraw  from proto col-required  therap ies 
or the study due to an adverse event, refer  to Section 6.3.[ADDRESS_590129] 1 of the 
following  serious criteria: 
 
• fatal 
• life threaten ing (places the subject at immediate  risk of death) 
• requires  in-patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_224633] 
• results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacity 
• congenital  anomal y/birth  defect 
• other  medi cally important  serious  event 
 
An adverse event would  meet the criterion  of “requires  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]”,  if the event 
necessitated an admi ssion to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay). 
 
If an investigator  considers an event to be clinically important,  but it does  not meet  any 
 
of the serious criteria,  the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under  the 
criterion  of “other  medi cally important  serious  event”. Examples  of such events could 
include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, DILI (see Appendix  A for 
drug-induced liver injury  reporting  criteria),  or events that necessitate an emergen cy 
room  visit, outpatient  surgery, or urgent  intervention.

• toxicity, 
• assessment  of relatedn ess toIP, and 
• action taken. 
 
The adverse event grading  scale used will be the Common Terminology  Criteria  for 
Adverse Events (CTC AE, v4.0). The grading  scale used in this study is described  in 
Appendix  A. The investigator  must assess whet her the adverse event is possibly related 
to the IP. This relatio nship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question: Is 
there  a reasonab le possibility  that the event may have been  caused by [CONTACT_33249]? 
 
The investigator is responsible for reviewing  laboratory  test results and determining 
whether  an abnormal  value in an individual  study subject represents a clinically 
significant change  from the subject’s baseline  values. In general, abno rmal laboratory 
findings  without clinical signifi cance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be 
recorded  as adverse events. Howe ver, laborato ry value changes  that require  treatment 
or adjustment  in current  therapy  are considered  adverse events. Where  appli cable, 
clinical sequelae (not the laboratory  abnormalit y) are to be recorded  as the adverse 
event. 
 
The Investigator  is expected to follow reported  adverse events until stabilization  or 
reversibility.

See Appendix  A for a sample  of the Serious  Adverse Event Worksheet.  
 
The investigator must assess wheth er the serious  adverse event is possibly related  to 
any study-mandated  activity or procedure.  This relation ship is indicated by a “yes” or 
“no” response to the question: “Is there a reasonable  possibility  that the event may have

11.1 Informed  Consent  
 
An initial  sample  informed consent form is provided for the investigator  to prepare  the 
informed  consent document  to be used at his or her site. Updates  to the template  are to 
be commun icated formally  in writing  from the [COMPANY_010] clinical study manager to the 
investigator.  The written  informed consent document is to be prepared  in the 
language( s) of the poten tial patient  population.  
 
Before  a subject’s participation  in the clinical study, the investigator  is responsible for 
obtaining  written  informed  consent from the subject or legally acceptab le repre sentative 
after adequate  explanation  of the aims, metho ds, anticipated benefit s, and potential 
hazards of the study and before  any proto col-specific screening procedures or any 
investigatio nal produ ct(s) is/are admini stered.  A legally  acceptable  repre sentati ve is an 
individual  or other  body  authori zed under appli cable law to consent, on behalf of a 
prospective subject, to the subject’s participation  in the clinical study. 
 
The investigator is also responsible for asking the subject if the subject has a primary 
care physician and if the subject agrees to have his/her primary  care physician informed 
of the subject’s participation in the clinical study. If the subject agrees  to such 
notifi cation, the investigator is to inform the subject’s prima ry care physician of the 
subject’s participation  in the clinical study. If the subject does not have a primary  care 
physician and the investigator  will be acting in that capacity, the investigator is to 
document  such in the subject’s medical record. 
 
The acquisition of informed  consent and the subject’s agreement  or refusal of his/her 
notifi cation of the primary care physician is to be documented  in the subject’s medi cal 
records, and the informed  consent form is to be signed  and personally  dated  by [CONTACT_21966] a legally  acceptable  representati ve and by [CONTACT_461387]. The original  signed  informed  consent form is to be 
retained  in accordan ce with institutional policy, and a copy of the signed consent form is 
to be provided to the subject or legally acceptab le repre sentative. 
 
If a potential  subject is illiterate  or visually impaired  and does  not have a legally 
acceptable  representati ve, the investigator  must provide an impartial  witne ss to read the 
informed  consent form to the subject and must allow  for questions. Thereafter,  both the

Rationale:  
 
• Added  inclusion of eligible subjects from 20110100  into this extension study. 
 
• Added  investigational  product (IP) holding  for other adverse events that warrant  IP 
dose withho ld.  Original  proto col only specified hold for corrected calcium (cCa), 
ionized calcium (iCa),  intact parath yroid hormone  (iPTH ), and symptomatic 
hypocalcemia.  
• Made  restart criteria  consistent for all IP holds. 
 
• Revised the Dose Adjustments section for clarity. 
 
• Clarified  the iCa value  on Day [ADDRESS_590245] be ≥ 1.05 mmol/L  prior to initiation of treatment 
for all subjects enrol ling from 20120356  study and only subjects who are ≥ 2 years of 
age in Study  20110100.  The iCa value on Day 1 for subjects who are < [ADDRESS_590246] be ≥ 1.13 mmol/L.  
• Updated  Key Conta ct from [COMPANY_003]  to [COMPANY_003]   
 
• Rem oved referen ce to serious  adverse events being  report ed via the electronic  case 
report  form (eCRF ).  For this  open -label extension study,  serious adverse events are 
reported  via a paper  form.  
• Clarified  eligibility  for the 20140159  study for those subjects who turn 18 years of age 
while  participating  in the 20130356  study. 
• Revised the wording  to indicate that standard  of care therapy  that is commercially 
available  will not usually be provided or reimbur sed by [CONTACT_11337] (except if required  by 
[CONTACT_461415]) as these will need  to be provided to sites in Russia. 
• Updated  study design and treatment  schema  to be consistent with the other  chang es 
in the proto col.

Section 6.  The titrati on tables  are based on cCa and iPTH  values  from the central 
laboratory  collected one week  before  dose titration.  Final  dose assignment  will be based 
on the ionized calcium obtained  on the day of titration.  An assessment of sympto matic 
hypocalcemia  will also be performed  on the day of titration.  Additional  weekly dose 
adjustments  for safety  are permitted  as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].1.1 .  The maximum 
dose assigned for all subjects will be 2.5 mg/kg/day  (based on dry weight  at day 1) not to

If at any time the subject has a local total calcium value of < 8.0 mg/dL,  the dose of 
investigatio nal produ ct must be withheld until an ionized calcium of > 1.05 mmol/L  or a 
central  lab corre cted calcium of > 8.4 mg/dL  are obtained,  at which time the dose may 
be resumed  at one PSD below  the previous dose.  If a local laboratory  measurement  is 
used it must be documented  in the subject’s source record and recorded  in the 
electronic  case report  form (eCRF).  
 
In addition,  if subjects require  temporary  admini stration  of concomitant medi cations  that 
are known  to prolong  the QTc interval, are CYP3A4  inhibito rs, or are CYP2D6  
substrates, the admini stration  of cinacalcet is to be withheld.  The dose may be restarted 
when  treatment with the concomitant  medi cation  has comple ted and an ionized calcium 
of > 1.05 mmol/L  or a central  lab corrected calcium of > 8.4 mg/dL  are obtained,  at which

Dose  adjustments  for subjects  receiving  cinacalcet  will be assessed  at each 
weekly visit during  the treatment  period.  The daily dose  of cinacalcet  may only be 
increased  at month ly titration  visits  (week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24); it can’t  be 
increased  at any other  time during  the treatment  period.  At all weekly visits 
(including  week 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, and 
27), the dose  may be maintained,  reduced  or withheld based upon  the criteria  in 
 
Table  1. 
 
If any of the criteria  for dose  withholding  are met at any time during  the trial, 
including  between scheduled  study visits  (ie, unscheduled),  the dose  of cinacalcet 
is to be withheld  until  all of the following criteria  are met:  
 
• Central  laboratory  corrected calcium value is > 8.4 mg/dL  
 
• iPTH  is > 100 pg/mL  
 
• Ionized calcium is > 1.05mmol/L  
 
• Subje ct has no sympto ms of hypocalcemia 
 
• Subject  doesn’t  have  any ongoi ng adverse  event(s)  which warrant  withholding 
of cinacalcet.  
 
If a subject  dose  is being  withhel d, ionized calcium  levels should  be assessed 
weekly until an ionized calcium  of ˃ 1.05 mmol/L  is obtai ned, at which point,  cCa 
and iPTH  should  be assessed  by [CONTACT_461420]. 
 
Once  all the restart  criteria  above  are met, cinacalcet  may be restar ted at one PSD 
below  the previous dose received.  Subjects  receiving  the lowest PSD (2.5 mg) who 
require  a dose  reduction  will have their  dose  withheld  until  the criteria  for 
maintaining  or increasing  the dose  are met, at which time they will restart  dosing 
at 2.5 mg/d ay. 
 
If subjects require  temporary  admin istration  of concomitant  medi cations  that are known to 
prolong  the QTc interval, are CYP3A4  inhibito rs, or are CYP2D6  substrates, the 
admini stration of IP is to be withhel d.  The dose may be restarted  at one PSD below  the 
previous  dose  once  the treatment  with the concomitant  medi cation  has completed  and 
all of the restart  criter ia above  are met.

Dose  adjustments  for subjects  receiving  cinacalcet  will be assessed  at each 
weekly visit during  the treatment  period.  The daily dose  of cinacalcet  may only be 
increased  at month ly titration  visits  (week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24); it can’t  be 
increased  at any other  time during  the treatment  period.  At all weekly visits 
(including  week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24), the dose  may be maintained,  reduced  or 
withheld based upon  the criteria  in Table  2. 
 
If any of the criteria  for dose  withholding  are met at any time during  the trial, 
including  between scheduled  study visits  (ie, unscheduled),  the dose  of cinacalcet 
is to be withheld  until  all of the following criteria  are met:  
 
• Central  laborato ry corrected  calcium  value  is > 9.0 mg/dL  
 
• iPTH  is > 150 pg/mL  
 
• Ionized calcium  is > 1.13 mmol/L  
 
• Subject  has no symptoms of hypocalcemia  
 
• Subject  doesn’t  have  any ongoi ng adverse  event(s)  which warrant  withholding 
of cinacalcet.  
 
If a subject  dose  is being  withhel d, ionized calcium  levels should  be assessed 
weekly until an ionized calcium  of ˃1.13 mmol/L  is obtained,  at which point,  cCa 
and iPTH  should  be assessed  by [CONTACT_461420]. 
 
Once  all the restart  criteria  above  are met, cinacalcet  may be restar ted at one  PSD 
below the previous  dose  received.  Subjects  receiving  the lowest PSD (1 mg)  who 
require  a dose  reduction  will have their  dose  withheld  until  the criteria  for

procedures  for an individual  subject will occur at the same time as the end of 
investigatio nal produ ct (EOIP)  visit for subjects enrolling  in Study  20140159.  
• Clarified  that for subjects enrolled  in Study  [ADDRESS_590366] will occur at the time as 
the EOIP  visit for subjects enrolling  in Study  20140159.  
• Added  the EOIP  visit in study 20130356  and day 1 in Study  20140159  will be the 
same visit unless there  is an admin istrative delay.  Eligible  subjects will complete 
day 1 of 20140159  assessment s. 
• Clarified  the initial  dose of cinacalcet for eligible  subjects from the cinacalcet arm in 
20130356  who meet  eligibility  on day 1 for Study  20140159.  
 
• Clarified  the initial  dose of cinacalcet for eligible  subjects from Study  20110100  on 
day 1 of Study  20140159.  
• Added  eligible subjects who reach Study  20110100  termination  before  week  26 will 
not complete  the safety  follow -up period  in Study  20110100,  beginning  the 20140159

A) Scientific Aims  
Specific Aim 1 : Determine the effects of a single intra- articular injection of platelet rich 
plasma (PRP) for mitigating the development of post -traumatic arthritis (PTA) in patients 
being surgically treated for pi[INVESTIGATOR_784927].  
Null hypothesis : A single intra -articular injection of platelet rich plasma (PRP) will not 
be associated with significant improvements in outcome based on patient -reported 
measures of pain and function, as well as diagnostic imaging findings of PTA in patients 
being surgically treated for pi[INVESTIGATOR_784927] . 
Specific Aim 2 : Assess the discriminatory potential of a synovial fluid biomarker panel 
for categorizing presence and severity of PTA based on patient -reported outcome 
measures of pain and function, as well as diagnostic imaging findings in patients being 
treated for pi[INVESTIGATOR_784927].  
Null hypothesis : Synovial fluid biomarkers will not have high discriminatory 
capabilities for categorizing presence and severi ty of PTA in patients being treated for 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_784927] . 
  
B) Background and Significance  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_784928] a 75% chance for symptomatic post -
traumatic arthritis (PTA).[ADDRESS_1079871] synovitis a fter injury. 
These pathologic processes appear to be especially important in the early phases of 
disease.2-4 Current treatments for articular fractures are focused on biomechanical issues: 
anatomic reduction, rigid stability, and limb alignment. These are critical issues to 
address for optimal healing, early limb use, and joint function. However, the biologic 
components of articular fracture are likely as, or even more important, with respect to 
development of PTA. As such, research efforts also need to foc us on these important 
aspects in order to mitigate the development and progression of joint pathology after 
articular fracture.  
In an in vitro study, antioxidant treatment delivered hours after articular cartilage injury 
was reported to prevent progression of PTA -related pathology.5 Using canine models of 
PTA, our group has noted significant benefits after intra -articular injection of platelet rich 
plasma (PRP) in decreasing pain, improving limb use, maintaining joint range of motion, 
and mitigating progres sion of osteoarthritis. Beneficial results associated with PRP 
treatment of OA have also been reported in clinical veterinary patients.[ADDRESS_1079872] high discriminatory potential for categorizing presence 
and severity of OA in dogs9, to assess patients for PTA after pi[INVESTIGATOR_246886] – which 
provides critical data regarding disease mechanisms7,8 – and treatment monitoring for 
deve lopment and assessment for novel therapeutic strategies for this pervasive problem.  
  
IRB # 2002117  C) Previous Work on the Study  
 There has been little published work on this particular treatment strategy for post 
traumatic arthritis of the ankle  
  
D) Methods  
With IRB approval and informed consent, patients (n=40) will be included who sustain 
closed pi[INVESTIGATOR_784929], followed by [CONTACT_784933] (ORIF). Up to 50 
patients will be enrolled in order to account for expected attrition in this patient 
population. Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment groups:  
- PRP (n=20): single intra -articular injection of 5 ml of a leukocyte -reduced platelet rich 
plasma (ACP, Arthrex, Naples, FL) at the time of closed reduction and initial 
stabilization using ankle -spanning external fixation 
- Control (n=20):  single intra -articular injection of 5 ml of sterile 0.9% saline at the time 
of closed reduction and initial stab ilization using ankle -spanning external fixation  
Study candidates will be identified as they present to the University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_784930].   Informed consent will be obtained 
as per IRB protocol.   The patien ts will be approached by [CONTACT_784934], attending, or study staff to present the current study. Patients will be told of 
the detai ls of the study and what is required of them if they chose to participate. The 
patients will be randomized by [CONTACT_784935], the PRP or control group. 
The patients will be blinded to which treatment they receive. Patients will be treated 
according to current standard of care, Following initial reduction and placement of ankle -
spanning external fixation, synovial fluid will be aseptically obtained via arthrocentesis 
from both ankles and saved for subsequent biomarker analysis  at the Comparativ e 
Orthopedic Laboratory. For the injured ankle, the PRP injection will be performed 
through the same needle used for arthrocentesis. PRP will be isolated from venous blood 
drawn from a peripheral vein. When appropriate, ORIF will be performed for definitiv e 
fracture treatment likely 7 -14 days following external fixator placement . Prior to 
capsulotomy for ORIF, synovial fluid will again be aseptically obtained via arthrocentesis 
from both ankles and saved for subsequent biomarker analysis.  
  
Follow -up assessments will be performed at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, 12 
months, and 18 months after surgery for all patients. Radiographs will be obtained at 6 
weeks and each subsequent visit. Patient reported outcomes (PRO) including AOFAS, SF 
12 and VAS for pain and level of function will be recorded at all follow -up assessments 
starting at 3 weeks. At 18 months, MRI of the affected ankle will be performed and used 
for whole -joint assessment of OA.10 
Number of patients per  group was determined from a pre -study power analysis using 
previously published data on prevalence of PTA after pi[INVESTIGATOR_246886] – the assumption 
being that a 10% reduction in percentage of patients experiencing symptomatic PTA 
would be clinically significant. Patients and all patient evaluators will be kept blinded to 
treatment until all data are collected and analyzed by [CONTACT_22888] -investigator responsible for 
IRB # [ADDRESS_1079873] hypothesis,  we will compare treatment groups for 
statistically significant (p<0.05) differences in proportions with PTA, proportions within 
each severity category, and PRO scores using Fisher’s exact tests, t -Tests, and rank sum 
tests. To test the second hypothesis, we will perform receiver operator characteristic 
curve analyses to determine the discriminatory capabilities (area under the curve (AUC)) 
of the panel for distinguishing the presence and severity of PTA. The injured ankle will 
be compared to the normal, contralateral ankle and AUC>0.[ADDRESS_1079874] scan injury severity 
score11 will be assessed as v ariables for predicting likelihood of presence and severity of 
PTA using Fisher’s exact test and odd’s ratios.  
Based on its mechanisms of action and preliminary data, we expect to reject our null 
hypotheses and show that a single injection of PRP  is associ ated with significant 
improvements in outcomes . We also expect that our synovial fluid OA biomarker panel 
will have high discriminatory capabilities  for categorizing presence and severity of PTA 
in patients being treated for pi[INVESTIGATOR_784927] .

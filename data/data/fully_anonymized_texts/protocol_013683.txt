Survival  
Objectives:  To determine if an intraoperative  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873] -General  Anesthesia Technique plus post - 
operative  epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187]  (EG)  compared  with an intraoperative General  Anesthesia  Technique 
with post -operative epi[INVESTIGATOR_232922] (GA):  
1) results in fewer Grade [ADDRESS_964614] -operative complications as described at 
https://one.mskcc.org/sites/pub/surgery/Pages/Secondary -Events.aspx  and based  on the 
Dindo, Clavien  grading system. 1-4 
2) results  in prolonged  survival  at 2 years  in patients with  adenocarcinoma,  
3) decreases  patient  length  of stay (LOS),  
4) decreases  post operative  delirium.  
Patient Population:  Adult  patients ≥  18 years  old who are scheduled  for pancreaticoduodenectomy 
at MSKCC.  
Design:  Prospective  randomized  controlled  single  institution  trial. 
Treatment Plan:  Patients  will be consented to the study  in the surgical or pre -anesthesia clinics  and 
then randomized  in the Pre -Surgical Center after successful  epi[INVESTIGATOR_709440] -General Anesthetic Technique  plus post-operative  epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187]  (EG)  or 
a General Anesthetic Technique with  post-operative epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187] (GA).  
Time  to Completion:  Estimated  time to completion  is 3 to 4 years.

Over  70% of patients will die  within the  first year of  diagnosis. While  surgery  offers the  best 
chance  for survival, fewer than [ADDRESS_964616] a  one 
year survival  of 20%  and a  five year survival  of 7%, depending  on a balance between  the 
histology and metastatic  potential of the tumor, the stage when it  is diagnosed, the 
completeness  of the resection  and the  competency  of the  immune  system  of the host in the 
defense against metastases.5 Even with surgery, the eventual  prognosis is poor with a 
median  survival of roughly 18  months.  The overall five -year survival rate  is about 10%, 
although this can  rise as high as 20%  to 35% if  the tumor  is removed  completely  and when 
cancer  has not  spread  to lymph  nodes. In a  recent  prospective  analysis  we found a  survival 
rate of 88% at one year and 80% at [ADDRESS_964617]  survival  
The surgery  itself carries  a high morbidity  with a  major  complication  rate upwards  of 30% in 
most  institutions. We  have recently reported a  rate of Grade 3 (see  Appendix  1) or greater 
complications of 27% in 218 pancreaticoduodenectomies performed in a high volume 
center.6 In addition,  we reviewed both  our published  data of  1030 cases  from 2004 – [ADDRESS_964618] 5  years and found in  1028 
pancreaticoduodenectomies Grade 3 complication  rates of 35 and 33% overall. (MSK

complications  after pancreatectomy  are intraabdominal  fluid collections/abscesses  and 
pancreatic leaks/fistulae, making up approximately 25% of all complication. 6,[ADDRESS_964620] previously  been demonstrated  in reviews  of the 
literature, including lower complication rates, earlier return to bowel function, reduced blood 
loss and decreased  LOS.16,17  The hypothesis is  that epi[INVESTIGATOR_709445] (EAA) 
can improve surgical outcome  by [CONTACT_709566].  
Likely  benefits include decreased  incidence of cardiac  complications  in high -risk patients; 
lower incidence of pulmonary complications,  lower incidence of DVT and pulmonary 
embolus; suppression  of the neuroendocrine stress response;  and earlier return of 
gastrointestinal function.  [ADDRESS_964621]-operative complications  in various operative procedures.17 
A large literature review of retrospective, prospective, and meta -analysis studies has 
demonstrated an improvement in surgical  outcome through beneficial  effects on 
perioperative  pulmonary function, blunting  the surgical stress response  and improved 
analgesia. In particular, significant reduction in perioperative cardiac  morbidity 
(approximately 30%), pulmonary infections (approximately 40%), pulmonary embolism 
(approximately  50%), ileus  (approximately  2 days),  acute  renal  failure (approximately 30%), 
and blood loss  (approximately 30%) were  noted in one  groups review of the  literature.[ADDRESS_964622] 
adverse morbid outcomes were not reduced by [CONTACT_709567][INVESTIGATOR_709446]. However, the improvement  in analgesia, 
reduction  in respi[INVESTIGATOR_33078], and the  low risk  of serious  adverse  consequences  suggested 
that many high -risk patients undergoing major intraabdominal surgery would receive 
substantial benefit from combined  general  and epi[INVESTIGATOR_709447].19

To date there are rare randomized controlled trials in patients undergoing  pancreatic

observed in older patients. The benefit of regional anesthesia on cancer  recurrence  may 
depend on the specific tumor type.88 
A retrospective study in patients with pancreatic cancer  aimed to assess associations 
between perioperative management  and survival in  patients undergoing resection.  Survival 
data and anesthetic records for 144 patients who had surgical resection of pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma were  obtained  and associations were sought between survival and 19 
predefined variables. The authors found increased survival in patients who received 
perioperative  epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187]. An association  between  use of epi[INVESTIGATOR_709480].89

Since the complication rate after PD  is so high and survival is  so low, anything  we as 
anesthesia  providers can  do to  mitigate  either  would be  valuable  to this patient population. 
By [CONTACT_709573]  (mitigating the immunosuppressive  effects of  anesthesia and surgery), we may be 
able to affect survival as  well as  length of stay  in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  We can achieve this by [CONTACT_709574]. We 
believe that  adding an intra -operative epi[INVESTIGATOR_709481] -operative 
surgical complications may  affect the outcome  of patients undergoing  surgical  resection for 
pancreaticoduodenectomy.  
. 
Finally we  will compare  the incidence  of delirium postoperatively in patients in  each  arm due 
to the high incidence  of delirium found in cancer  patients in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], increasing  healthcare 
costs,  length  of stay, long term  cognitive decline and  mortality. 92-94 At MSK in  patients 
undergoing  major  surgery, patients with  delirium had a  longer length of stay  and a  greater 
likelihood of discharge  to a rehabilitation facility.95,96

4.0 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
4.1 Design  
This will be a prospective randomized assessor  (surgical  staff)  blinded controlled study. 
Since  the interventional  arm will be receiving a  continuous epi[INVESTIGATOR_79190], it  would not  be 
possible  to blind the anesthesia  care provider  for the intervention.  Additionally,  once  surgical 
incision is made, the provider would be able to determine which patient’s epi[INVESTIGATOR_709482].  
Postoperatively, the complication data points will be collected by [CONTACT_709575]. 
The treatment arm information is not  available  to those doing the assessments.  As all 
patients  will have epi[INVESTIGATOR_709483],  it will 
not be obvious which  treatment arm the patient is on.  
Eligible patients will  be consented  for the  trial in  the Hepatopancreaticobiliary  or Pre - 
Anesthesia clinic  before surgery.  Prior  to the  insertion of  epi[INVESTIGATOR_709484]-Surgical 
Center which  occurs  on the day of  surgery,  patients will be  randomized  by [CONTACT_709576] -operative epi[INVESTIGATOR_709485] a standard 
GA with post -operative  epi[INVESTIGATOR_709486].

Potential research  subjects  will be  identified  by a member  of the patient’s  treatment  team,  the 
protocol  investigator or the  research  team at MSKCC. If  the investigator is a  member  of the 
treatment team, s/he will screen  the patient’s medical records for suitable research  study 
participants and discuss the  study and their potential  for enrollment.  
The principal investigators  may also screen  the medical records  of patients with whom  they 
do not have a  treatment  relationship for  the limited  purpose  of identifying  patients who  would 
be eligible  to enroll in the  study and  to record  appropriate contact [CONTACT_709584].  
All patients scheduled  to undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy  who meet  eligibility  criteria  will 
be approached for participation in the study during the surgical  or anesthetic pre -operative 
visit by a member  of the research  team.  Details pertinent to  the trial,  the expected outcomes 
and the associated  risks and potential  complications will be discussed  before enrollment.  
Informed consent  will be  obtained  by a consenting professional and  documented  in the 
patient’s  chart.  Study  subjects  will not receive  any compensation  for participation in  the 
study.  There will  not be  any additional  costs  for the patients derived from participation.  
During the initial conversation between the investigator/research staff and the patient, the 
patient may be asked to provide certain health information that is necessary  to the 
recruitment  and enrollment process.  The investigator/research  staff may also review portions 
of their medical  records  at MSKCC to further assess  eligibility. They will  use the information 
provided by [CONTACT_539978]/or medical  record  to confirm  that the  patient is eligible  and to 
contact  [CONTACT_539979]. If the patient turns  out to  be ineligible for the 
research  study, the research  staff will destroy all information collected on the patient during 
the initial  conversation and medical  records  review, except for any  information that must be 
maintained for the screening  log purposes.  
In most  cases,  the initial  contact  [CONTACT_709585], investigator or the research  staff working in consultation with the treatment

 occurs is less than 1 in 10,000 patients.100 Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_709531], 
according  to the institutional  practices,  necessitates  imaging  (MRI of  the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050])  for diagnosis 
and subsequent evaluation from the neurosurgery service. The differences in anesthetic 
management are within accepted  peri-operative  standards and should not pose any 
additional morbidity to the patients enrolled.  
For data collection, all complications  of grade [ADDRESS_964647] 
practice. The Hepatopancreaticobiliary  (HPB) service runs a biweekly meeting in which all 
complications  are discussed  and prospectively recorded into the Memorial Sloan Kettering 
Surgical  Secondary  Events Program Database.  An anesthesia  research  study  assistant  will 
query the Memorial  Sloan Kettering Surgical Secondary  Events Program Database at [ADDRESS_964648] morbidity  data for patients enrolled in the study.  
 
 
12.0 CRITERIA  FOR  THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
The primary  objective  of this study  is: 
 
To determine whether EG  anesthesia, as opposed  to GA, affects  the incidence  of grade 3 or 
greater complications  in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy  and will  be assessed 
during the patients’ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], readmissions,  and follow -up reports from outside 
institutions sent to the  surgeon’s office. Complications  will be  graded in  severity according  to 
the MSKCC Graded Post  Operative Complications Criteria based on the modified Dindo, 
Clavien classification  of surgical  complications,  a grading system commonly  used  for this 
procedure.3,4 This classification  grades complications from 1 -5, with Grade 1 complications 
requiring bedside intervention.  Grade 2  requires moderate  interventions, such  as intravenous 
medications.  Grade 3 requires either a surgical,  endoscopic or interventional  radiology 
procedure  for treatment.  Grade 4 results  in chronic deficit  or disability.  Grade 5  complications 
result in death. The criteria can be found at on the MSK intranet at 
https://one.mskcc.org/sites/pub/surgery/Pages/Secondary -Events.aspx . Complication  data 
will be collected for [ADDRESS_964649] operatively.  
 
The secondary  objectives  are: 
1) to determine whether EG  anesthesia  affects overall survival at [ADDRESS_964650]  on the 
patients’ immune  systems.  Patients who have a pathologic  diagnosis of pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma  will be evaluated  for this endpoint  and the survival  data and date  of 
death obtained from the CRDB  status update report.  
2) to evaluate  the effect  of an  EG technique on  LOS. 
The exploratory objectives is:

to GA.  This will be assessed  by [CONTACT_709593] (twice daily) using the CAM 
tool and documented in the Nursing Delirium Assessment  flowsheet.  
 
13.[ADDRESS_964652]  may be removed  from the study  at any time  if the attending surgeon  or anesthesia 
provider deems  it necessary  for patient safety, or if the patient expresses desire to be 
removed.  If a patient is transferred  to the Intensive Care  Unit (ICU), s/he  will have that 
recorded as a Grade 3 complication for the primary  endpoint.  Management will continue in 
the patient’s  best interests and according to ICU guidelines.  
Any patient who  experiences any  complication intra -operatively  related  to the  epi[INVESTIGATOR_709532]. Any patient who experiences any 
complication post -operatively related to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_709533]. 
Those patients will continue on study  and analyzed as intention to treat.  
 
 
14.0 BIOSTATISTICS  
This is  a randomized  comparison  of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873] -General  Anesthesia (EG) versus the standard of care 
General  Anesthesia  (GA), both  with post-operative  epi[INVESTIGATOR_232922], among  patients who  undergo 
Pancreaticoduodenectomy.  The primary  endpoint  is major  post-operative complications  (Grade 3  or 
higher). Results  from a previous  trial indicated a 33% major complication rate in the GA arm 
(proportion of patients with Grade [ADDRESS_964653] -operative complications).6,7 Hence, we  are 
interested in a decrease in complication rate to  20% in the EG arm.  
The evaluable  sample size  is 366 patients  (183 per arm). The randomization will be 1:1 into two 
arms,  stratified by [CONTACT_709594]  (yes/no). The proportion of patients who 
experience a major complication will be estimated separately for each arm.  We will use a Cochran - 
Mantel -Haenszel test after adjusting for neo adjuvant status to  determine  the association  between 
treatment arm  and the  proportion  of patients who  experience major complications.  Although  our 
primary  analysis is based  on a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel  test, the power  calculation is  based  on an 
un-stratified Chi -square test,  which provides  a more  conservative estimate  of the required sample 
size. A sample  size of 366 provides 80% power for detecting a decrease  from 33% to 20% major 
complication rate with two sided type I error rate of 5% between the two arms.  This reduction was 
selected  as the point at which  the benefit  of EG  would  warrant a  change in  peri-operative  practice.  
This sample  size also allows for one interim analysis at halfway through enrollment, using Lan - 
DeMets  spending  function with  O’Brien -Fleming  boundaries  for both efficacy  and futility.  If p≤0.002 
at the interim analysis,  then enrollment  will stop  with the conclusion  that the EG  significantly reduces 
major complication  rate. If p≥0.0719 at the  interim analysis, enrollment will  stop for futility  with the 
conclusion  that there  is no evidence  that EG  significantly decrease  major  complication  rates. If 0.002  
<p<0.719,  the trial will continue  to completion,  and we will conclude  that EG significantly  reduces

 major complication  rates if p≤0.049. The  boundaries above are  based  on the planned interim 
analysis with  50% of  the data collected.  The actual  timing  of the interim analysis will  correspond  to 
when the DSMB meets;  hence, the final stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_709534].  
Evaluable  patients are  randomized  patients who  completed  surgery  without pre -specified  violation  of 
intra-operative  criteria, specifically  if the patient was  found to be unresectable in the surgical  room.  
We anticipate the surgical unresectable rate to be 20%; hence, over -accrual may occur  in order to 
ensure  at least  366 evaluable  patients for  80% power.  The number  of patients who  are excluded due 
to unresectability will be summarized  by [CONTACT_709595] -square test. Based on an 
expected accrual  of ten patients per month,  we anticipate the time  to completion to be [ADDRESS_964654] two years for each patient (to establish 2 year survival).We will 
utilize logistic regression  to estimate the association between the treatment arms and major post - 
operative complications,  after testing  for potential  peri-operative/post -operative  confounders such  as 
co-morbidities,  neoadjuvant  chemotherapy status,  and adjuvant  chemotherapy status.  
The secondary  endpoints  include  overall  survival  at two  years and  LOS, defined as duration 
between operation (POD  0) and discharge  from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Overall  survival of patients will  be 
summarized  by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier  approach in  each  arm. Median  survival  and 2 -year overall survival 
will be presented, along with  95% confidence  intervals  for the  entire cohort and the  subset  of 
adenocarcinoma patients. The comparison  of interest in terms of overall  survival will be performed 
among  patients with adenocarcinoma  (estimated  to be approximately 60%  of population)  and based 
on the final pathology.  Overall survival will be compared  between the two arms  using the log -rank 
test. Cox proportional  hazards models will be utilized to assess the  association between treatment 
arms  and the survival endpoint, including potential  adjustment  factors (co -morbidities,  neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy).  
Analysis  of the secondary  endpoint  of LOS  will utilize  the two -sample  t-test to compare  the two  arms 
(with  appropriate transformation  of the  data based  on distribution of the endpoint)  in the  entire 
cohort. Linear  regression  will be utilized  to assess the relationship  between treatment arms and 
LOS, including potential adjustment factors (co -morbidities,  neoadjuvant  chemotherapy, and 
adjuvant chemotherapy).  
As exploratory  analyses,  we will compare  the two  treatment  arms  in terms  of one additional  outcome 
in the whole  cohort:  post-operative delirium status  (measured  daily until POD4).  Delirium status  will 
be analyzed with  logistic regression  including treatment arms  and other potential adjustment factors 
(co-morbidities,  neoadjuvant  chemotherapy, and adjuvant  chemotherapy).  
Analyses will  be performed  under the modified  intent to  treat (m -ITT) principle: all  evaluable  patients 
(as described above) will be analyzed in the randomized  arm. Additional  results from  as-treated 
analyses (based on actual treatment the patients received) will be reported.

16.1 Quality  Assurance  
Weekly  registration reports will be generated  to monitor patient accruals  and completeness 
of registration data. Routine data quality reports will be generated to assess  missing  data 
and inconsistencies.  Accrual  rates and  extent  and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow -up will 
be monitored periodically throughout the study  period and potential problems  will be  brought 
to the attention of the study team for discussion  and action.  
Random sample  data quality and protocol  compliance  audits will be  conducted  by [CONTACT_709599] a minimum of two times per year, more frequently if indicated.  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_709539], quality and 
integrity of all data  collection  during the study  and during the final analysis of  data. Breaches 
of protocol, problems  with eligibility,  informed  consent  or discrepancies  in data accuracy  will 
be reported to the IRB at MSKCC as required.  
16.2 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
The Data  and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans  at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer  Center 
were  approved by  [CONTACT_40137]  2001. The  plans address  the 
new policies set forth by [CONTACT_83711]  ”Policy  of the National  Cancer 
Institute for Data and Safety Monitoring  of Clinical Trials,” which can  be found at: 
http://cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/conducting/dsm -guidelines . The DSM  Plans  at MSKCC  were 
established and are monitored by [CONTACT_28644].  The MSKCC Data and 
Safety Monitoring Plans can  be found on  the MSKCC Intranet  at: 
http:/mskweb5.mskcc.org/intranet/assets/tables/content/359709/DSMPlans07.pdf . 
There  are several  different mechanisms  by [CONTACT_709600],  safety 
and quality. There are institutional processes in place for quality  assurance  (e.g. protocol 
monitoring, compliance  and data verification audits, therapeutic response, and staff 
education on clinical research  QA) and departmental procedures  for quality control. In 
addition,  there are two institutional  committees that  are responsible for monitoring the 
activities of our clinical trials programs.  The committees:  Data  and Safety Monitoring 
Committee  (DSMC) for Phase I and II clinical trials, and the Data and Safety  Monitoring 
Board (DSMB) for Phase  III clinical trials, report to the Center’s Research  Council and 
Institutional Review Board.  
During the protocol development and review process,  each protocol will be assessed  for its 
level of risk  and degree of  monitoring required. Every  type of  protocol (e.g.  NIH sponsored,  in 
house sponsored, industrial sponsored,  NCI cooperative group, etc.) will be addressed  and 
the monitoring procedures will be established at the time  of protocol activation.

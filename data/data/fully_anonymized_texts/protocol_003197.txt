 SYNOPSIS 
Name [CONTACT_790]: argenx BVBA 
Name [CONTACT_913835] (IMP):  ARGX -113 
Active Ingredient: Efgartigimod 
Indication: Primary immune thrombocytopenia 
Title of Trial: A Phase 3, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blinded, 
Placebo -Controlled Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of 
Efgartigimod (ARGX -113) 10 mg/kg Intravenous in Adult Patients 
With Primary Immune Thrombocytopenia  
Protocol No: ARGX-113-1801 (ADVANCE) 
Trial Sites: This is a global, multicenter trial 
Trial Duration:  The total maximum trial 
duration  per patient is up to 31 weeks: 
- Up to 2 weeks of screening 
- 24 weeks treatment period 
- End-of-T reatment visit 1 week after 
visit 24 
- 4 weeks of follow-up Phase: 3 
Objectives: 
Primary Objective:  
x To evaluate the efficacy of efgartig imod compared to placebo in achieving a sustained platelet count response 
in patients with chronic primary immune thrombocyt openia (ITP), with a sus tained platelet count response 
defined as platelet counts of at least 50×109/L for at least 4 of the 6 visits between week 19 and 24 of the trial*. 
Secondary Objectives : 
x To evaluate the efficacy of efga rtigimod compared to placebo in overall platelet count response. 
x To evaluate the safety and tolerability of efgartig imod administered intravenously (IV) weekly or every other 
week (q2w). 
x To evaluate the incidence and severity of bleeding events while rec eiving treatment with efgartigimod 
compared to placebo. 
x To evaluate the use of rescue treatment and chan ges in concurrent ITP therapy while receiving treatment with 
efgartigimod compared to placebo. 
x To evaluate the effects of efgartig imod treatment on quality-of-life (QoL ) measures and patient-reported 
outcomes (PRO) compared to placebo. 
x To assess the immunogen icity of efgartigimod. 
x To assess the pharmacokinetic s (PK) of efgartigimod. 
 

 “week ” instead of “visits ” are used in the endpoints, ensuring that the platelet count of the End-of-Treatment visit is 
regarded as week 24 platelet count (eg, platelet count after 19 week s of treatment corresponds with platelet count of 
visit 20).

Trial Design: 
DESCRIPTION  
This is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, up to 31- week trial 
to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and impact on QoL of efgartigimod 10 mg/kg IV treatment in adult patients with 
primary ITP.  
The target population are adult p atients with persistent or chr onic primary ITP, having an average platelet count of 
<30×109/L, and at the start of the trial being on concurrent ITP treatment(s) and having received at least [ADDRESS_1283926] been maintained at a 
stable dose and dosing frequency for 4 weeks prior to randomization.  As of week 12, the start or an increase in the 
dose and/or schedule of permitted concurrent ITP therapy is allowed for patients who have an “insufficient 
response ” (ie, no platelet count of ≥30×109/L in any of the visits during the last 4 weeks). These patients will be 
considered as “non-responders ” for the primary endpoint analysis. 
After confirmation of eligibilit y, the patients enter a 24 -week treatment period and will be randomized to receive 
efgartigimod  10 mg/kg IV or placebo, weekly from visits [ADDRESS_1283927] visit at which IMP was ad ministered (ie, either weekly or q2w). 
Patients completing the 24-week randomized trial period will perform the End-of-Treatment visit and can enter the 
open -label extension trial (ARGX-113-1803) to receive efgartigimod 10 mg/kg IV. The platelet counts from the 
ARGX -113-1801 trial will be taken into account to as sess the dosing frequency in ARGX-113-1803. 
Patients who complete the 24-week trial period but who do not enter the open-label extension trial 
ARGX -113-1803, or patients who discontinue the trial early, with the exception of p atients who withdraw their 
consent,  will be followed for 4 weeks for ongoing safety and efficacy monitoring. 
For patients who discontinue the trial early, all the assessments listed for the Early Discontinuation visit as 
specified in the schedule of assessments (SoA, Table 1 ), will be performed. 
SAMPLE SIZE AND STRATIFICATION  
Approximately 117 patients with chronic ITP and up to 39 patients with persistent ITP will be randomized in a 
2:[ADDRESS_1283928] been randomized. 
Patients will be stratified acco rding to the following factors:  
x History of splenectomy (yes vs. no) 
x Receiving concurrent ITP therapi[INVESTIGATOR_772838] (yes vs. no)

 SCREENING AND TREATMENT 
During the screening period (up to 2 weeks) the patient’s eligibility for trial participation will be evaluated. 
All eligible patients will be randomized to receive IV infusions of  either efgartigimod 10 mg/kg body weight or 
matching placebo throughout the trial . 
All patients will initially receive weekly IV infusions from visits 1 to 4. Based on the platelet counts as of visit 2, 
the dosing frequency can be altered from visit s 5 to 16 according to following rules (the change in dosing frequency 
will occur at the c urrent visit): 
x Reduce from weekly to q2w in patients achievin g platelet counts of ≥100×109/L for 3 out of 4 consecutive 
visits (the fourth visit being the current visit) and having a platelet count of ≥100×109/L at the last of these 4 
visits 
– OR – 
3 consecutive visits. 
x Increase from q2w to weekly in patien ts whose platelet counts drop below 100×109/L on 2 consecutive 
visits – OR – 
<30×10
9/L at 1 visit 
– OR –  
in patients who receive resc ue therapy (see Section 6.8.4 ) 
x Temporary withholding treatment: 
o for reasons described in Section 4.5, IMP should be reintroduced once the investigator considers 
the undue risk to the patient has passed 
o in patients with platelet counts greater than 400×109/L, IMP should be resumed at the 10 mg/kg 
q2w dose when the platelet count falls to fewer than 150×109/L 
x Post-baseline platelet count can be performed within  1 day of the next procedure as the SoA (both dosing 
and non-dosing visit), allowing the results to be incorporated into the criteria above. 
From visit s 17 to 24, the dosing frequency is  fixed for each individual patient  (ie, either the weekly or q2w 
regimen ), based on the regimen the patient was receiving at visit [ADDRESS_1283929] visit at which IMP was 
administered.  
Exceptions to the fixed dosing frequency are: 
1. Continued weekly dosing for patien ts requiring rescue therapy. 
2. Continued q2w dosing for patients resuming IMP when the platelet co unt falls to fewer than 150×109/L after 
having had platelet counts greater than 400×109/L.

include oral corticosteroids, oral immunosuppressants, dapsone/danazol, fostamatinib and/or oral thrombopoietin 
receptor agonists  (TPO-RAs; inclusion criterion n° 6, Section 4.3.1 ). 
Dose and frequency of permitted concurrent ITP therapi[INVESTIGATOR_913735]. 
Exceptions are patients who are receiv ing concurrent treatment with oral TPO-RAs in whom dose changes are 
permitted at label -defined platelet thresholds, and patients who are receiving concurrent treatment with 
fostamatinib, in whom dose changes or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_913736] -defined conditions. 
As of week 12, the start or an  increase in the dose and/or schedule of  permitted concurrent ITP therapy is allowed 
for patients who have an “insufficient response ” (ie, no platelet count of ≥30×109/L in any of the visits during the 
last 4 weeks). These patients  will be considered as “non-responders ” for the primary endpoint analysis. At the 
discretion of the investigator, the dose an d/or schedule of the concurrent ITP therapy can be returned to the baseline 
levels.  
Patients not receiving concurrent ITP therapy are also elig ible for the trial.  
RESCUE THERAPY  
“Rescue therapy” is defined as an oc currence where the patient needs treatmen t with 1 or more rescue treatments. 
An “occurrence” is defined as a peri od of maximum 5 days where 1 or more  rescue treatments are administered 
simultaneously or co nsecutively to the trial patient. The start date/time of the occu rrence is the start of the 
administration of the first rescue treatment.  
Rescue therapy is allowed  post-baseline during the 24-week trial peri od for patients with a platelet count of 
<30×109/L and 1 of the following: 
x an immediate risk of bleeding or a clinically significant bleeding or wet purpura 
x requirement for urgent or emergent surgery (elec tive surgeries must be pos tponed until trial completion) 
The following rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_86042]: 
x IV methylprednisolone up to 1 g/day × 1-3 days , oral dexamethasone up to 40 mg/day × 1-3 days, or oral 
prednisone up to 1 mg/kg/day × 1-2 days 
x immunoglobulins given IV (IVIg): up to 1 g/kg/day × 1-2 days 
x IV anti-D: up to 50-75 mcg/kg/day × 1-2 days 
Note: Anti-D rescue therapy should not be given to Rh(D)-positive patients 
x platelet transfusions 
It is encouraged to inform the sponsor’s designated Contract  Research Organization (CRO)  medical monitor prior 
to initiating rescue therapy.  
In the event of rescue with IVIg or IV anti-D: 
x If given at a visit where the IMP was due to be adminis tered, the IMP should be w ithheld and administered 
at the next visit. 
For rescue therapy with methylprednisolo ne, dexamethasone, prednisone, or platelet transfusions: 
x Administration of the IMP con tinues during rescue therapy. 
Patients who were receiving q2w dosing at the time of rescue therapy w ill have the IMP administration frequency 
increased to weekly . 
For patients who receive rescue therapy,  the platelet counts for [ADDRESS_1283931] day of rescue treatment will 
not be used ( ie, are censored) to assess whether or not the patient can transition to q2w treatment.

 Patients requiring more than 3 occurrences of rescue therap y will discontinue from IMP.  
SAFETY  
The administration of IMP may be  temporarily withheld if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], it could put the 
patient at undue risk in the following circumstances:  
x clinically significant disease, inclu ding evidence of infection 
x severe bleeding, grade 3 or 4 on the WHO bleedin g scale, requiring urgent medical and/or surgical 
intervention 
x thrombosis 
If the IMP is being withheld, it can be reintroduced once the investigator considers the undue risk to the patient has 
passed.  
The administration of IMP mu st be temporary withheld from patients with  platelet counts greater than 400×109/L, 
IMP should be resumed at the 10 mg/kg q2w dose when the platelet count falls to fewer than 150×109/L. 
Efgartigimod treatment induces reductions in IgG levels, an d there is a potential risk for infections associated with 
low IgG levels. As such, infections ar e considered AESI in this trial.  
Due to the nature of underlying di sease (ie, ITP), any occurrence of bleeding will also be considered an adve rse 
event of special interest ( AESI). 
ASSESSMENT OF BLEEDING  
Signs and symptoms of bleeding are the predominant clinical manifestation of ITP and are typi[INVESTIGATOR_913737] s. 
The occurrence  and severity of any bleeding symptoms will be assesse d and recorded at every visit using the World 
Health Organization (WHO) bleeding scale  as specified in the SoA ( Table 1 ). 
EARLY DISCONTINUATION FROM THE TRIAL 
Any patient prematurely discon tinuing the trial should perform the assessme nts listed for the Early Discontinuation 
visit.  
TRIAL END  
End-of-Trial is defined as last patient last  visit in the ARGX-113-1801 trial. 
Planned Number of Patients: Approximately 117 patients with chronic ITP and up to 39 patients 
with persistent ITP will be randomized. 
Planned Number of Sites: Approximately 125 sites 
Planned Countries: This trial is a global, multicenter trial. 
Target Population Adult patients with persistent or ch ronic primary ITP, who have an 
average platelet count of <30×109/L, and who, at the start of the trial, 
are on concurrent ITP treatment(s) and have  received at least [ADDRESS_1283932] 2 prior treatments for ITP.

measurement.  
Efficacy : 
The efficacy analysis will be performed on the FAS or the subset of patients in the FAS with chronic ITP (b aseline 
primary efficacy observation) and analyzed with intent -to-treat principle (ie, patients will be analyzed according to 
their planned treatment irrespective of the treatment actually received).  
Sample  Size 
The null and alternative hypotheses are defined as H 0: π1 = π 2 vs. HA: π1 ≠ π2, where π1 and π2 are the population 
probabilities t o achieve a sustained  platelet count response (primary efficacy endpoint) for patients with chronic 
ITP receiving placebo and for patients with chron ic ITP receiving efgartigimod, respectively. 
The response rate of placebo patients with chronic ITP reaching the primary endpoi nt is expected to be %, while 
for efgartigimod patients with chronic ITP a response r ate of % is expected (ie, π1 = and π2 = ). Given 
these assumptions, a total of N = [ADDRESS_1283943] 90% to 
reject the null hypothesis at a [ADDRESS_1283944] stratified for the stratification 
factors history of splenectomy (yes vers us no), receiving concurrent ITP ther api[INVESTIGATOR_772838] (yes versus no), and 
for baseline platelet count level category (<15×109/L versus ≥15×109/L). The treatment effect will be presented as 
the odds ratio together with its 95% confi dence interval (CI) and two-sided p-value. In addition, an adjusted 
difference of the proportions with its 95% CI will be provided.  
Key Secondary Endpoints Subject to Alpha Control 
Extent of disease control is defined as the number of cumulative weeks over  the planned 24- week treatment period 
with platelet counts of ≥50×109/L. For each patient this number will be  calculated by [CONTACT_913777] 1 until week 24 (End -of-Treatment visit) at which  the platelet count level is ≥50×109/L. A 
Wilcoxon -Mann-Whitney test stratified by [CONTACT_913778][INVESTIGATOR_772838] (yes versus no), history of 
splenectomy (yes versus no) , and baseline platelet count level category (<15×109/L versus ≥15×109/L) will be used 
to compare th e extent of disease control between both treatment groups. The 2-sided p- value resulting from this 
hypothesis test will inform on whether the null hypothesis that the distributio ns of number of cumulative weeks for 
both treatment groups are identical can b e rejected. The test will be conduc ted at a significance level α=0.05. An 
estimate of the location shift will be provided, along with th e associated 95% confidence interval.  
The key secondary endpoint s on proportion of patients in the overall population wi th a sustained platelet count 
response and on proportion of patients in  the overall population achieving platelet counts of at least 50×109/L for at 
least 6 of the 8 visits between week 17 and 24 of the trial will be analy zed in the same manner as the prim ary endpoint. 
The number of bleeding events per patient (assessed using the WHO bleeding scale;  where WHO scale ≥1 at any visit 
is considered a new bleeding event ) will be analyzed using a zero- inflated negative binomial model. This model will 
account for the large expected number of patients with zero bleeding events. It is a mixture m odel consisting of 
2 components: a negative binomial count model an d a binary model for predicting excess zeros. The model will 
consist of  the number of events as the dependen t variable and of randomized treatment, the stratification variables 
(history of splenectomy; receiving concurrent ITP therapi[INVESTIGATOR_772838]) , and baseline platelet count as indep endent 
variables . An offset term will be used to allow for patient exposure. Both the count model, using the log link, and 
the binary model, using the logit link, will contain the same independent variables.  The probability of no bleeding 
will be estimated for each randomized treatment group. A Wald test will be used to test the null hypothesis that the 
log of the bleeding rate ratio on placebo and efgartigimod is  equal to zero against the alternative that it is different 
from zero. The rate of bleeding over 24 weeks on placebo a nd efgartigimod will be provided, along with the rate

 ratio, 95% 2-sided CI, and 2-sided p-value. Incidence of bl eeding will also be summarize d descriptively by [CONTACT_765]. 
Severity of bleed ing will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_231748]. In addition, a summary of within- subject maximum 
severity will be provided.  
The primary endpoint analysis will act as gatekeeper for the testing of th e key secondary endpoints. Subject to 
meeting statistical s ignificance for the primary endpoint, the key secondary endpoints will be analyzed using a 
fixed -sequence testing procedure to maintain the overall type  I error rate at 5%. The ty pe I error rate of each 
individual test will be 5%, but the test will only be  conducted if the analysis for all previous endpoints in the pre -
defined hierarchy resulted in a p -value <0.05. The order in the testing hierarchy of the key secondary endpoints is 
as follows:  
1. The extent of disease control defined as the num ber of cumulative weeks over the planned 24-week 
treatment period with platelet counts of ≥50×109/L in the population with chronic ITP. 
2. The p roportion of patients in the overall population (chr onic and persistent ITP) with a sustained platelet 
count response defined as  achieving platelet counts of ≥50×109/L for at least 4 of the 6 visits between 
week 19 and week 24 of the trial. 
3. The incidence and severity of the WHO-classif ied bleeding events in the overall population. 
4. The proportion of patients in the over all population achieving platelet counts of ≥50×109/L for at least [ADDRESS_1283945] terms  for randomized treatment, baseline platelet level or baseline PRO , history of 
splenectomy (yes vs. no), and receiving concurrent ITP therapi[INVESTIGATOR_772838] (yes vs. no). Least square (LS) m eans 
for plac ebo and efgartigimod will be provided, along with th e difference in LS means, 95% 2-sided CI, and 2- sided 
p-value. 
Time to response (defined as the time to achieve 2 consecutive platelet counts of ≥50×109/L) will be analyzed via Cox 
proportional hazards re gression with fixed effect terms  for randomized treatment and b aseline platelet level. The 
model will be stratified by [CONTACT_913779] (yes vs. no) and receiving conc urrent ITP therapi[INVESTIGATOR_193238] b aseline (yes 
vs. no ), at randomization. The hazard ratio for efgartigimod vs. placebo will be provided, along with the associated 
95% 2 -sided CI and 2-sided p-value. The data will also be displayed using Kaplan- Meier curves and the median time 
to response will be displayed by [CONTACT_106180]. T he number of cumulative weeks over the planned 
24-week treatment period with platelet counts of ≥30×109/L and at least 20×109/L above baseline will be analyz ed in 
the same way  as described for the key secondary endpoint ”extent of disease control. ” Assessment of number of 
cumulative weeks over the planned 24 -week treatment period with platelet counts of ≥30×109/L and at least 20×109/L 
above baseline within the group of patients with a baseline platelet count of <15×109/L will also be analyzed as 
described for the key secondary endpoint.  
Pharmacodynamics, Pharmacokinetics, and Immunogenicity 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for PD parameters (total IgG and subtypes, and antiplatelet antibodies),  and 
ADA . Efgartigimod serum concen tration data will be summarized. 
Safety  
Incidence and severity of AEs, AESIs, and SAEs will be summarized descriptively. Laboratory parameters, vital signs, 
and ECG data will also be analyzed descriptively.

 1. INTRODUCTION 
 Background Information 
Efgartigimod (ARGX-113) is a modified human  immunoglobulin (Ig) G1-derived crystallized 
fragment (Fc) of the za allotype that binds with nanomolar affinity to the human neonatal 
crystallized fragment receptor (FcRn). Efgartigimod encompasses IgG1 residues D221-K447 (EU numbering scheme) and has been modified with the so- called ABDEG™ technology 
(ABDEG™  = antibody that enhances IgG degradation)
1 to increase its affinity for FcRn at both 
physiological and acidic pH. The increased affini ty for FcRn of efgartigimod at both acidic 
and physiological pH results in a blocka ge of FcRn-mediated recycling of IgGs. 
Given the essential role of the FcRn receptor in IgG homeostasis, inhibiting this FcRn function, 
as is achieved by [CONTACT_202025], leads to rapid degradation of all IgGs, including disease-
associated autoantibodies of the IgG isotype. This  approach is thought to result in alleviation 
of signs and symptoms in IgG-driven autoimmune diseases. 
The safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) , and pharmacodynamics (PD) of intravenous 
(IV) administrations of efgartigimod have been  investigated in a first-in-human study in 
healthy adult subjects. A second study in healthy adult subjects investigated the bioavailability, 
safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, PK, and PD  of a subcutaneous (SC) administration of 
efgartigimod and evaluated the reduction of the IV infusion time from 2 hours to 1 hour. 
Phase 2 trials in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP ) and myasthenia gravis (MG) have indicated 
that efgartigimod administered by [CONTACT_913781]; induces a specific, rapid, and 
profound PD effect (ie, reduction in IgG levels, including autoantibody levels); and is 
associated with improvement in clinical signs and symptoms in ITP and MG patients,2 
separately (see Section 1.3). Additionally, the safety and tolerability of efgartigimod is 
currently being evaluated for the treatment of pa tients with pemphigus in a phase 2 trial. 
Primary ITP is an acquired autoimmune bleeding disorder characterized by [CONTACT_913782] (<100×10
9/L) in the absence of other causes or disorders associated with 
thrombocytopenia.[ADDRESS_1283958] been reported at 3.3 per 100 000 adults/year.[ADDRESS_1283959] available care, patients 
rarely achieve long-term remission, and often require multiple treatment options.6 ITP can be 
described based on the duration of disease: newly diagnosed (within 3 months of diagnosis), 
persistent (between 3 and 12 months from diagnosis), and chronic (lasting for more than 
12 months).3 
In primary ITP, platelet destruction and impaired platelet production are driven by 
[CONTACT_913783]. The 
resulting, often severe, thrombocytopenia may be accompanied by a variety of symptoms 
including evidence of bleeding in the skin and mucosa, and risk of serious intracranial and

ARGX-113/efgartigimod Protocol Version 6.0, Final 
 
argenx BVBA Confidential Page [ADDRESS_1283960] concern is the risk of significant bleeding, 
such as intracranial hemorrhage. The 5-year fatal  hemorrhage rate is higher in older patients 
with ITP, especially in those with comorbid conditions.6-8 Other clinically significant concerns 
include complications from internal bleeding a nd elevated risk of arterial thrombosis and 
venous thromboembolism.9 Immune thrombocytopenia is al so associated with fatigue, 
reported in up to 39% of adults with ITP,6 as well as impaired quality-of-life (QoL). These 
comorbidities interfere with work and social life , which can lead to feelings of embarrassment, 
isolation, and sexual inadequacy.6-[ADDRESS_1283961]-line 
therapy in primary ITP is cor ticosteroids, as well as immunoglobulins given intravenously 
(IVIg) and anti-D. Second-line treatm ents include broad immunosuppressants and 
thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs). There is limited evidence to guide the use of 
these treatments, as described in the Amer ican Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines.[ADDRESS_1283962] recurrent or 
persistent thrombocytopenia associated with blee ding after an initial treatment course with 
corticosteroids (or IVIg or anti-D). Patients may cycle through different treatment regimens 
seeking any that is efficacious and tolera ble. Immune thrombocytopenia remains a chronic 
disease despi[INVESTIGATOR_913742]. 
According to the ASH ITP guidelines only splen ectomy has provided evidence of remission at 
1 year. Additionally, a significant proportion of patients develop resistance to treatment. 
Furthermore, existing treatments are associated  with burdensome side-effects limiting their use 
(eg, long-term steroid treatment) and/or concern about use in patient populations (eg, 
TPO-RAs in patients with ele vated cardiovascular risk). 
Targeted and selective IgG reduction, as ach ieved by [CONTACT_202025], has the potential as an 
effective new treatment in ITP seen the central role of IgG autoantibodies in the 
pathophysiology of ITP. It represents a novel me chanism of action distinct from that of other 
existing treatments which are either broadly immunosuppressive or stimulate thrombopoiesis. 
 Benefit-Risk Assessment 
Efgartigimod has been shown to effectively re duce IgG antibodies in several clinical trials, 
including healthy volunteers, patients with MG, and with ITP. 
More specifically, a phase 2 trial (ARGX-113-1 603) in patients with ITP enrolled a patient 
population who was predominantly refractory to previous lines of ITP therapy, with the 
majority of patients having long-standing di sease, prior ITP treatment exposure and 
approximately half with base line platelet count of <15×109/L. 
Efgartigimod resulted in a rapid and marked reduction of IgG antibodies (maximum mean 
reduction of 65%) and of all IgG subtypes.

argenx BVBA Confidential Page 38 of 162 
 Treatment with efgartigimod, whether 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg, was associated with an increase 
in platelet counts in more patients than occurr ed in the placebo group, with greater numerical 
separation from placebo as the platelet count threshold stringency was increased. Additional 
post hoc analyses further supported these observations, showing a longer duration of clinically 
meaningful effect and statistically significantly  more active-treated patients achieving a 
platelet count of ≥50×109/L for more than 10 cumulative da ys compared to the placebo group.  
In each of the subgroups of patients based on IT P classification (newly diagnosed, persistent, 
or chronic ITP) or those with or without historical or concomitant use of TPO-RA, there were examples of efgartigimod-treated patients with an increase in platelet count. 
In the open-label treatment pe riod patients received 4 weekly infusions of efgartigimod 
10 mg/kg, either as first exposure in patients  who previously received placebo or retreatment 
with efgartigimod. In this part of the trial,  the majority of patients (58%) had improved platelet 
counts. Efgartigimod is under investigation in MG, another disease driven by [CONTACT_913784]. In a 
phase 2 trial ARGX-113-1602, 4 weekly IV infusions of 10 mg/kg efgartigimod led to 
statistically significant improvements in clinical s cales and were well to lerated. A phase 3 trial 
ARGX-113-1704 and accompanying open-label  extension trial ARGX-113-1705 are ongoing 
in this indication. 
In clinical trials to date, efgartigimod has been  well tolerated in healthy adult subjects and 
patients with MG and ITP, separately: the majo rity of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were 
considered to be mild (grade 1) in severit y. In the completed phase  1 trials ARGX-113-1501, 
ARGX-113-1702, and ARGX-113-1901 in healthy volunteers, and in the phase 2 trial 
ARGX-113-1602 in patients with MG, no grade ≥3 TEA Es were reported and no TEAE led to 
discontinuation. In the phase 2 trial ARGX-113- 1603 in patients with ITP, 1 TEAE with 
grade 4 was reported (thrombocytopenia), considered unrelated to treatment, and led to 
treatment discontinuation. 
No clinically significant changes in vital signs and/or electrocardiogram (ECG) findings have 
been observed in clinical trials to date. 
Safety for use during pregnancy has not been es tablished. Therefore, efgartigimod should not 
be administered to pregnant or lactating women. 
Please refer to the current Investigator ’s Brochure for more information regarding the 
preclinical and clinical trials, and the potential ri sks and benefits of e fgartigimod. In summary, 
the favorable balance between risks and anticipa ted efficacy/benefits supports the use of 
efgartigimod in clinical development. 
 Trial Rationale 
The proposed phase [ADDRESS_1283963] on patient-reported 
outcomes (PRO) of efgartigimod administered as IV infusions in adult patients with primary

argenx BVBA Confidential Page [ADDRESS_1283964] had an insufficient response or w ho are intolerant to existing ITP treatments, 
evidenced by a platelet count that is below th e clinically accepted level for intervention 
(<30×10⁹/L).  
Patients classified as having persistent ITP (between 3 and 12 months since diagnosis) and 
chronic ITP (greater than 12 months since diagnosis) w ill be recruited. At the start of the trial, 
the patients are either on concurrent ITP treatme nt(s) and have received at least [ADDRESS_1283965] (ie, reduction of 
autoantibody levels) and seeking to result in an  improvement in platelet count. In patients who 
achieve a prespecified threshold of maintained platelet count improvement, the frequency of efgartigimod administration will be altered (ie, increased or decreased) according to 
prespecified criteria, after whic h the frequency of administration will be unchanged for the last 
7 weeks (visits 17 to 24) of trial treatment. Ass essment of the dosing regimen as described in 
Section 5.4.[ADDRESS_1283966] 5 weeks of trial treatment. 
Based on the results of the phase 1 trial in health y adult subjects, the phase 2 trial in patients 
with ITP, as well as the PK/PD modeling analysis, a dose of 10 mg/kg efgartigimod was 
selected as it is considered safe and well tolerated, achieved consistently a close to maximal 
IgG reduction (ie, 65-70%), and resulted in a clinical response (eg, increase in platelet count) 
in a significant proportion of patients. This dose is also being utilized in the ongoing phase 3 trials in MG (see Section 1.2). 
A continuous dosing regimen of weekly or biweekly (q2w) IV infusions of 10 mg/kg efgartigimod is anticipated to be safe. In a l ong-term toxicity trial (26-weeks with 8-weeks 
recovery period), cynomolgus monkeys were dosed with weekly efgartigimod infusions of up 
to 100 mg/kg. The no observed adverse effect level  was set at the highest administered dose of 
100 mg/kg. The exposures achieved in this toxicity  study were between 35.5 (female animals) 
and 40.8 (male animals) times the simulated area under the curve values in  ITP patients using 
the clinical dose of 10 mg/kg.

ITP therapy is allowed for patients who have an “insufficient response”  (ie, no platelet count 
of ≥30×109/L in any of the visits during the last 4 week s). These patients will be considered 
as “non-responders ” for the primary endpoint analysis. At the discretion of the investigator, 
the dose and/or schedule of the concurrent ITP ther apy can be returned to the baseline levels.

 All changes or discontinuations in concurrent ITP therapy (type, dose, frequency, date of 
discontinuation and resumption) should be approp riately indicated in the electronic case 
report form (eCRF). The patient does not need to be discontinued from the trial. 
Patients not receiving concurrent ITP ther apy are also eligible for the trial. 
RESCUE THERAPY 
“Rescue therapy” is defined as an occurrence where the patient needs treatment with 1 or 
more rescue treatments. An “occurrence” is defined as a period of maximum 5 days where 1 
or more rescue treatments are administered si multaneously or consecutively to the trial 
patient. The start date/time of the occurrence is the start of the administration of the first 
rescue treatment. 
Rescue therapy is allowed post- baseline during the 24-week trial period for patients with a 
platelet count of <30× 10⁹/L and 1 of the following: 
x an immediate risk of bleeding or a clinica lly significant bleeding or wet purpura 
x requirement for urgent or emer gent surgery (elective surgeries must be postponed until 
trial completion) 
The following rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_86042]: 
x IV methylprednisolone up to 1 g/day×1-3 days, or oral dexamethasone up to 
40 mg/day×1-3 days, or oral prednisone up to 1 mg/kg/day×1-2 days 
x IVIg: up to 1 g/kg/day×1-2 days 
x IV anti-D: up to 50-75 mcg/kg/day×1-2 days 
Note: Anti-D rescue therapy should not be given to Rh(D)-positive patients 
x platelet transfusions 
It is encouraged to inform the sponsor’s designated contract research organization (CRO)  
medical monitor prior to initiating any rescue therapy. 
In the event of rescue with IVIg or IV anti-D: 
x If given at a visit where the investigational medicinal product (IMP) was due to be 
administered, the IMP should be withheld and administered at the next visit. 
For rescue therapy with methylprednisolone , dexamethasone, prednisone, or platelet 
transfusions: 
x Administration of the IMP cont inues during rescue therapy. 
Patients who were receiving q2w dosing at the time of rescue therapy will have the IMP 
administration frequency increased to weekly.

rescue treatment will not be used (ie, are cen sored) to assess whether or not the patient can 
transition to q2w treatment. 
Patients requiring more than 3 occurrences of rescue therapy will discontinue from IMP. 
EARLY DISCONTINUATION FROM THE TRIAL 
Any patient prematurely discontinuing the trial should perform the assessments listed for the 
Early Discontinuation visit as mentioned in the SoA ( Table 1 ). 
TRIAL END 
End-of-Trial is defined as last patient last visit in the ARGX-113-[ADDRESS_1283979] of 
efgartigimod and placebo administered as an IV infusion. The trial consists of a treatment 
period where all patients will initially receive weekly IV infusions from visits 1 to 4. From 
visits 5 to 16, the dosing frequency can be altered (ie, increased or decreased) according to 
specified rules. 
The primary endpoint in this trial is the proportion of patients with chronic ITP that have a 
sustained platelet count response defined as  achieving platelet counts of at least 50×10
9/L for 
at least 4 of the 6 visits between week 19 a nd 24 of the trial. Patients who discontinue 
treatment prior to visit 24 due to lack of effi cacy (eg, more than 3 occurrences of rescue 
therapy) or due to an AE, and who have not achieved sustained platelet count response 
between week 19 and 24, are considered non-res ponders. Patients who receive rescue therapy 
at week 12 or later, or for whom dose and/or frequency of concurrent ITP therapi[INVESTIGATOR_913743] 12 or later, are also considered non-responders. 
The key secondary endpoints assess the efficacy of efgartigimod focusing on measures of 
response derived from platelet counts, and the incidence and severity of bleeding. 
The choice of a 10-mg/kg IV dose of efgartigim od was made because it has been shown to be 
well tolerated, to consistently achieve close to maximal PD effect, and to be associated with a 
clinical meaningful effect on platelet counts (see Section 1.3). Based on the transient clinical 
responses observed following short term 4-week tr eatment in the phase 2 trial, a personalized 
chronic dosing regimen guided by [CONTACT_913785]: a continuous weekly or q2w dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg. 
Platelet count is an objective measure and is th e accepted marker of treatment effect in ITP.

 Early Discontinuation 
The criteria for screening and enrollment are to be followed explicitly. If it is noted that a 
patient who does not meet 1 or more of the inclusion criteria and/or meets 1 or more of the 
exclusion criteria is inadvertently enrolled and dosed, the sponsor’s designated CRO  monitor 
and the sponsor’s medical director must be contact[CONTACT_15608]. 
4.4.1. Early Discontinuation From Trial 
Early discontinuation from the trial is defi ned as the permanent cessation of further 
participation in the trial prior to its planned co mpletion and without the possibility to roll 
over to the open-label exte nsion trial (ARGX-113-1803). 
The reason for early discontinuation from the trial will be clearly documented by [CONTACT_1275]. 
- Patients must  be discontinued early from the trial and complete the Early 
Discontinuation visit as specified in the SoA ( Table 1) if:

argenx BVBA Confidential Page [ADDRESS_1283987]  be discontinued early from the trial, complete the Early 
Discontinuation visit as specified in the SoA ( Table 1), and have to be followed-up 
for 4 weeks (2 q2w visits) for ongoing safety and efficacy monitoring if: 
x it is i n the patient’s best interest, discussion with the sponsor’s medical 
director is encouraged prior to discontinuation 
x unblinding occurred 
x prohibited medication is taken (see Section 6.8.2) 
x a severe hypersensitivity reaction to IMP occurs 
x the patient became pregnant 
4.4.2. Early Discontinuation From Treatment 
Early discontinuation from treatment means th at the patient stops receiving the ongoing IMP 
treatment and does not restart IMP treatment, however, informed consent is not withdrawn. 
These patients will continue  the weekly trial visits as specified in the SoA ( Table 1 ) without 
IMP-related assessments. 
Patients must  be discontinued early from  treatment  in the following circumstances: 
x on the request of the sponsor (eg, following data safety monitoring board [DSMB] 
advice, see Section 7.3.5) 
x patient has missed more than 2 consec utive scheduled doses of IMP treatment 
x patient has received more than 3 occurrences of rescue therapy  
Patients who complete the 24-week trial period but who do not enter the open-label extension 
trial ARGX-113-1803, or patients who discontinue the trial early, with the exception of 
patients who withdraw their consent, will be followed for 4 weeks for ongoing safety and efficacy monitoring.

 Temporary Withholding Treatment 
- The administration of IMP may be temporary withheld if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], it could put the patient at undue  risk in the following circumstances: 
x clinically significant disease, including evidence of infection 
x severe bleeding, grade 3 or 4 on the WHO bleeding scale, requiring urgent medical 
and/or surgical intervention 
x thrombosis 
If the IMP is being withheld, it can be reintroduced once the investigator considers the undue risk to the patient has passed. 
- The administration of IMP must be temporar y withheld from patients with platelet 
counts greater than 400×10
9/L. IMP should be resumed at the 10 mg/kg q2w dose when 
the platelet count falls to fewer than 150×109/L. 
 Protocol Deviations 
The investigator should not implement any deviation from, or changes to the approved 
protocol without agreement of the sponsor, and pr ior review and documented approval of an 
amendment from the Institutional Review Bo ard/Independent Ethics  Committee (IRB/IEC) 
and regulatory authority as per local regulation, except where necessary to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to trial patients, or when the change involves only logistical or 
administrative aspects of the trial (eg, change of telephone numbers, …). The investigator (or 
designee) should document and explain any deviation from the approved protocol. 
Planned protocol exemptions or waivers will not be approved by [CONTACT_456]. 
 Screen Failures, Rescreening, and Retesting 
Evaluations at screening and confirmation at baseline (visit 1) will be used to determine the 
eligibility of each patient for randomization at visit 1. Patients who fail to meet the eligibility criteria by [CONTACT_765] 1 will be considered screen failures. 
Patients may be retested once (ie, redoing [ADDRESS_1283988]) if still within the screening period. 
Retesting may be considered in the following case: 
x A patient who has clinical laboratory tests v alues meeting [ADDRESS_1283989] (to be confirmed by [CONTACT_2237], 
except for the platelet count for which 1 retesting can be done at the local laboratory), if still within the screening period. If not feasible, the patient should be rescreened. 
Examples of conditions under which rescreening may be considered include the following: 
15 July 2021 ARGX-113-1801 
ARGX-113/efgartigimod Protocol Version 6.0, Final 
 
argenx BVBA Confidential Page 54 of 162 
 x Patients who required treatment for an acute illness (eg, a urinary tract infection) or have 
a chronic medical problem (eg, uncontrolled hype rtension) may be rescreened once the 
illness has resolved or the medical problem is stabilized. 
The decision to rescreen patients may be optional, based on the clinical state of the patient 
and the decision to rescreen will solely be made per the investigator ’s discretion on a case -
by-case basis. For the purpose of rescreening, a new ICF should be completed, and a new 
patient identification number (ID) generated. 
 Early Termination of Trial or Site 
The trial may be terminated at any time by [CONTACT_913786], inability to achieve the recruitment target within a reasonable time, or if in the 
sponsor's judgment there are no further benefits to be expected from the trial. In such a case, 
the sponsor or designee will inform the trial i nvestigators, institutions, and all regulatory 
authorities. 
The trial can also be terminated by [CONTACT_350206] a site level by 
[CONTACT_1201]/IEC. The sponsor may close individual trial sites prematurely for reasons such as 
poor protocol compliance or unsatisfactory recruitment of patients. 
 End-of-Trial Definition 
The End-of-Trial is defined as last patien t last visit in the ARGX-113-1801 trial.

 5. TRIAL PROCEDURES 
Every effort should be made to ensure that th e protocol-required tests and procedures are 
completed as described. When a protocol-required procedure cannot be performed, the 
investigator will document the reason, and any corr ective and preventive actions that he/she 
has taken to ensure that the normal processes ar e adhered to in source documents. The trial 
team should be informed of these incidents in a timely manner. 
Each patient should attend each trial visit, whether he/she is on a weekly or q2w IMP 
administration regimen, on the designated days. There is a permissible visit window of 
+[ADDRESS_1283990] day (which is relative to baseline randomization 
[visit 1]) as described in the SoA ( Table 1 ). 
The treatment phase consists of a 24-week IV treatment period with either efgartigimod 10 mg/kg or matching placebo, administered weekly  from visits 1 to 4 and either weekly or 
q2w from visits 5 to 16 , adjusted according to the patient’s platelet count. From 
visits [ADDRESS_1283991] visit at which IMP was administered  (ie, either weekly or q2w). Assessment of the 
dosing regimen as described in Section 5.4.[ADDRESS_1283992] sign the ICF prior to any trial-related assessment. 
Prior to signing the ICF, the trial patients will be instructed not to participate in any other 
clinical trial that involves an intervention or collection of data until the completion of the 
current trial. 
Any patient who provides informed consent is being assigned a unique patient ID via the 
interactive response technology (IRT) system. 
 Screening 
After the informed consent has been obtained, th e patient will be screened at the site for 
eligibility based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria defined in Section 4.3.1 and 
Section  4.3.2, respectively.

ARGX-113/efgartigimod Protocol Version 6.0, Final 
 
argenx BVBA Confidential Page 56 of 162 
 The assessments as specified in the SoA ( Table 1 ) will be performed during screening. 
Patients being screened will be registered in the IRT system. The IMP treatment can be 
started upon confirmation of eligibility at visit 1. 
 Randomization 
The results of all screening procedures have to be available prior to randomization (visit 1) to 
determine the eligibility for randomization into  the trial. Randomization should be performed 
as soon as possible after screening with a maximum of 2 weeks, however only after 
confirmation of eligibility of the patient. If a pa tient meets all the eligibility criteria and after 
approval from the sponsor, he/she will be randomized via IRT. If a patient is not eligible, the 
patient should be recorded as a screen failure in the IRT system. 
 Treatment Period 
The assessments as specified in the SoA ( Table 1 ) will be performed during the IMP 
treatment period. 
During the IMP treatment period, all assessments and procedures have to be performed 
before the start of the IMP administration, except for: 
x Pharmacokinetic sampling, which will be  performed both pre- and post-dose (within 
2 hours prior to the start of the IMP infusion and within 30 minutes after the end of IMP 
infusion, respectively) 
x the continuous assessment of AEs and th e recording of concomitant therapy 
If the IMP is being withheld, it can be reintroduced once the investigator considers the undue 
risk to the patient has passed (see also Section 4.5). If a patient misses more than 
2 consecutive scheduled doses, then he/she w ill be discontinued early from further IMP 
treatment as defined in Section 4.4.2. 
The End-of-Treatment/Early Discontinuation vi sit should be completed for all patients, 
whether they roll over to the open-label extension trial (ARGX-113-1803), discontinue the trial early, or complete the 24-week trial period. 
5.4.1. Screening and Treatment 
During the screening period (up to 2 weeks) the patient’s eligibility for trial participation will be evaluated. 
All eligible patients will be randomized to receive IV infusions of either efgartigimod 
10 mg/kg body weight or matching placebo throughout the trial. 
All patients will initially receive weekly IV infusions from visits 1 to 4.

 Based on the platelet counts as of visit 2, the dosing frequency can be altered from 
visits 5 to 16 according to the following rules (the  change in dosing fre quency will occur at 
the current visit): 
x Reduce from weekly to q2w in patients achieving platelet counts of ≥100×10⁹/L for 
3 out of 4 consecutive visits (the fourth visit being the current visit), and have a 
platelet count of ≥100×10⁹/L at the last of these 4  visits 
– OR – 
3 consecutive visits 
x Increase from q2w to weekly in patients whose platelet counts drop below 100×10 ⁹/L 
on 2 consecutive visits 
– OR – 
<30×10⁹/L at 1 visit  
– OR – 
in patients who receive rescue therapy (see Section 6.8.4) 
x Temporary withholding treatment 
o for reasons described in Section 4.5, IMP should be reintroduced once the 
investigator considers the undue risk to the patient has passed 
o in patients with platelet counts greater than 400×109/L, IMP should be 
resumed at the 10 mg/kg q2w dose when the platelet count falls to fewer than 
150×109/L 
x Post-baseline platelet count can be performed within 1 day of the next procedure as per the SoA (both dosing and non-dosing visit), allowing the results to be 
incorporated into the criteria above. 
From visits 17 to 24, the dosing frequency is fixed for each individual patient (ie, either weekly or q2w regimen), based on the regimen the patient was receiving at visit [ADDRESS_1283993] visit at which IMP was administered. 
Exceptions to the fixed dosing frequency are: 
- Continued weekly dosing for pati ents requiring rescue therapy  
- Continued q2w dosing for patients resumi ng IMP when the platelet count falls to 
fewer than 150×10
9/L after having had platelet counts greater than 400×109/L 
5.4.2. Rollover to the Open-Label Extension Trial (ARGX-113-1803) 
Patients who complete the 24-week trial period have the possibility to enter the open-label 
extension trial (ARGX-113-1803) to receive e fgartigimod 10 mg/kg IV. The platelet counts 
from the ARGX-113-1801 trial will be taken into account to assess the dosing frequency in 
ARGX-113-1803. 
Eligible patients who consent to roll over in to the open-label extension trial ARGX-113-1803 
should complete the End-of-Treatment visit of the current trial.

a dosing visit. If visit 24 of the ARGX-113-1801 trial was a non-dosing visit, the 
End-of-Treatment visit will coincide with visit 1 of the ARGX-113-1803 trial. 
The platelet counts from the ARGX-113-1801 trial will be taken into account to assess the 
dosing frequency in ARGX-113-1803. 
Patients who do not enter the open-label extension trial (ARGX-113-1803) will remain in the 
current trial to be followed for 4 weeks (2 q2w visits). 
 Follow-up Period 
Patients who complete the 24-week trial period but who do not enter the open-label extension 
trial ARGX-113-1803, or patients who disconti nue the trial early, with the exception of 
patients who withdraw their consent, will be followed for [ADDRESS_1283995] of 2 q2w visits. 
The assessments as specified in the SoA ( Table 1 ) will be performed during the follow-up 
period. 
 Unscheduled Visit 
It is at the investigator’s discretion or on request of the patient to initiate an unscheduled 
visit, if deemed necessary for the patient’s safety and well -being. All such visits will be 
entered in the eCRF with any additional re quired documentation based on the nature of the

 6. TRIAL TREATMENT 
 Treatment Administered 
The IMP infusions (efgartigimod or placebo) will be administered weekly from visits 1 to 4, 
either weekly or q2w from visits 5 to 16, and fixed on the dosing schedule of visit 16 (or the last visit at which IMP was administered) from visits 17 to 24 (ie, either weekly or q2w). Patients should receive each IV infusion of IMP at a dose of 10 mg/kg over a period of 
approximately 1 hour. 
The maximum total dose per efgartigimod infusion is 1200 mg for patients with a body 
weight ≥120  kg measured at infusion visits. A variation of ± 10% of the amount of 
efgartigimod will not be considered an overdose/underdose. In case of a change in body weight, the dose will automatically be recalculated by [CONTACT_82550].  
The matching placebo infusion will contain the same excipi[INVESTIGATOR_913746]. 
All IMP treatment will be fully blinded. Details on infusion rate and time will be given in the IMP management manual (pharmacy 
manual). 
 Identity of Investigational Medicinal Product 
The IMP (efgartigimod or placebo) will be s upplied to the pharmacy at the investigational 
site (and stored at a temperature of 2°C to 8°C or 35°F to 46°F), by [CONTACT_350175] ’s designated IMP supply vendor . For each IMP batch at the site, 
the investigator will receive the certificate of analysis, certificate of conformity, and 
European Union qualified person release documents. 
Efgartigimod for IV administration will be provid ed as a sterile, colorless, clear concentrate 
for solution for IV infusion in glass vials. Appr opriate dilutions in a 0.9% saline solution in 
an infusion bag will be prepared on site pr ior to administration with an IV pump. 
Matching placebo will be provided as a sterile , colorless, clear concentrate solution for 
IV administration in glass vials with the same  formulation as the efgartigimod solution, but 
without the active ingredient that is present in efgartigimod. Appropriate dilutions in a 
0.9% saline solution in an infusion bag will be  prepared on site prior to administration with 
an IV pump. The IMP will be manufactured in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice regulations. 
Detailed instructions on IMP management on site (including preparation of the IMP) will be 
included in the IMP management manual (pharmacy manual).

argenx BVBA Confidential Page 60 of 162 
 
 Packaging and Labeling 
The IMP will be labeled and secondary packed  in accordance to local laws and regulatory 
requirements. 
 Storage of Investigational Medicinal Products 
The investigator (or his/her designee) is responsible for the correct and safe storage of the 
IMP assigned to the clinical site, in a locked, se cure storage facility with access limited to 
those individuals authorized to dispense the IMP and maintained within the appropriate 
temperature ranges. 
The IMP must be stored refrigerated (2°C to 8°C or 35°F to 46°F) in its secondary 
packaging, should not be exposed to freezing te mperatures, should not be shaken, and should 
be protected from direct sunlight during storage at the clinical site. 
The IMP temperature will be recorded on a continuous basis at the site pharmacy and 
minimum/maximum temperature ranges should be registered. 
Further requirements on temperature logging during storage and information on how to 
handle temperature excursions can be foun d in the IMP management manual (pharmacy 
manual). 
 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Group 
Once the patient has provided informed cons ent, the site will enroll the patient and a 
screening number will be allocated through IRT.  Upon confirmation of eligibility at baseline 
(visit 1), the patient will be randomized through IRT by [CONTACT_57148] a unique patient randomization ID. 
This randomization ID will be stored in the IRT system. Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive efgartigimod (10 mg/kg) or matching 
placebo. No trial team members from the sponsor, nor from the sponsor’s designated CRO , 
or pharmacy personnel will have access to this  IMP treatment assigned until after database 
lock. 
 Dosing Administration for Each Patient 
During the IMP treatment period, the IMP will be administered as an IV infusion over a 
period of approximately [ADDRESS_1283996] 
30 minutes after the end of the infusion as part of routine safety monitoring. 
 Blinding 
This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial with limited access to the IMP 
treatment assigned (see also  DEFINITION OF TERMS ).

members from the sponsor , nor from the sponsor’s designated CRO, pharmacy personnel , or 
other site staff. Once unblinded, the patient will  be discontinued from the trial and will be 
followed for 4 weeks for ongoing safety and efficacy monitoring. 
The sponsor and monitor at the sponsor ’s designated CRO must be notified immediately if a 
patient and/or investigator is unblinded during the course of the trial. Pertinent information 
regarding the circumstances of unblinding must be documented in the patient ’s source 
documents and eCRF. Once unblinded, the patient will be early discontinued from the trial 
and followed-up for 4 weeks (2 q2w visits). 
 Prior Treatments and Concomitant Medications 
All prior ITP procedures and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_913747], before 
baseline must be recorded in the eCRF, including the name, dose/schedule, duration 
(including start and stop dates), and whether patient responded to them. 
The washout periods as specified in exclusion criteria [ADDRESS_1283998] be followed.  
The patient’s history of TPO -RA and other ITP therapy response and intolerance will be 
collected separately in the eCRF.

(including the name, dose/schedule, start and stop dates).  
6.8.1. Concurrent ITP Therapy 
Patients receiving at leas t [ADDRESS_1284000] 4 weeks before randomization 
(ie, visit 1). 
Permitted concurrent ITP medications include oral corticosteroids, oral immunosuppressants, 
dapsone/danazol, fostamatinib and/or oral TPO-RAs.

As of week 12, the start or an increase in th e dose and/or schedule of permitted concurrent 
ITP therapy is allowed for patients who have an “insufficient response”  (ie, no platelet count 
of ≥30×109/L in any of the visits during the last 4 week s). These patients will be considered 
as “non-responders ” for the primary endpoint analysis. At the discretion of the investigator, 
the dose and/or schedule of the concurrent ITP ther apy can be returned to the baseline levels. 
Any change in concurrent ITP therapy shoul d appropriately be recorded in the eCRF. 
6.8.2. Prohibited Medication s and Therapy Prior to Randomization 
The following medications or treatments are not permitted within the specified time window 
prior to randomization: 
x Use of anticoagulants (eg, vitamin K antagonists, direct oral anticoagulants) within 
4 weeks prior to randomization. 
x Use of any transfusions within 4 weeks prior to randomization. 
x Use of Ig (IV, SC, or intramuscular route) or PLEX, 4 weeks prior to randomization.

The following medications or treatments are not permitted during the trial: 
x Anti-CD20 therapy (eg, rituximab) 
x Romiplostim 
x Any monoclonal antibodies or Fc fusion proteins or investigational drug 
x Live/live-attenuated vaccines 
6.8.4. Rescue Therapy 
“Rescue therapy” is defined as an occurrence where the pati ent needs treatment with 1 or 
more rescue treatments. An “occurrence” is defined as a period of maximum 5 days where 
1 or more rescue treatments are administered simultaneously or consecutively to the trial 
patient. The start date/time of the occurrence is the start of the administration of the first 
rescue treatment. 
Rescue therapy is allowed for  patients having protocol-def ined ITP clinical deterioration 
AND if in addition the treating physician believes that the patient’s health is in jeopardy if 
rescue therapy is not given. 
Rescue therapy is allo wed post-baseline during the 24-week trial period for patients with a 
platelet count of <30× 10⁹/L and 1 of the following: 
x an immediate risk of bleeding or a clin ically significant bleeding, or wet purpura 
x requirement for urgent or emer gent surgery (elective surgeries must be postponed until 
trial completion) 
The following rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_86042]: 
x IV methylprednisolone up to 1 g/day × 1-3 days, oral dexamethasone up to 
40 mg/day × 1-3 days, or oral predniso ne up to 1 mg/kg/day × 1-2 days 
x IVIg: up to 1 g/kg/day × 1-2 days 
x IV anti-D: up to 50-75 mcg/kg/day × 1-2 days 
Note: Anti-D rescue therapy should not be given to Rh(D)-positive patients 
x platelet transfusions 
If a patient needs rescue therapy according to the investigator, it is encouraged to inform the 
medical monitor at the sponsor’s designated CRO, whenever possible prior to actual 
implementation of the rescue therapy. 
In the event of rescue with IVIg or IV anti-D:

 x If given at a visit where the IMP was due to be administered, the IMP should be withheld 
and administered at the next visit (see also Section 4.5 and Section 6.11). 
For rescue therapy with methylprednisol one, dexamethasone, prednisone, or platelet 
transfusions: 
x Administration of the IMP c ontinues during rescue therapy 
Patients who were receiving q2w dosing at the time of rescue therapy will have the 
IMP administration frequency increased to weekly. 
For patients who receive rescue therapy, the platelet counts for [ADDRESS_1284002] day of 
the rescue treatment will not be used (ie, ar e censored) to assess whether or not the patient 
can transition to q2w treatment. 
Patients requiring more than 3 occurrences of rescue therapy will discontinue from IMP. 
 Medical Care of Patients After End-of-Treatment or Early 
Discontinuation 
After a patient has completed the trial, has withdrawn/discontinued early, or does not roll 
over to the open-label extension trial (ARGX-113- 1803) usual treatment will be administered 
if required, in accordance with the trial site’s standard of care and generally accepted medical 
practice depending on the patient’s individual needs.  
 Treatment Compliance 
The investigator should promote treatment compliance by [CONTACT_913788]’s safety and the validity of the trial. The prescribed dose, timing, 
and mode of administration cannot be cha nged. All dates, start and end time of IMP 
administration, and any deviations from the inte nded regimen must be recorded in the eCRF. 
A sponsor’s designated CRO  monitor will review the pharmacy records at each site including 
the drug accountability and dispensing records  on which the pharmacist or designated person 
should record all IMP released for patient use. The sponsor’s designated CRO  monitor will 
compare the dispensing record and vials with the individual patient’s identifiers , kit number, 
and visit schedule to confirm that the patient re ceived the correct treatment and dose, and that 
the dosing schedule is correct. 
Errors that are identified will be communicated to the site personnel to ensure that the errors 
are not repeated. The sponsor’s designated CRO monitor’ s report will include details of any 
missed doses, errors in dose, treatment or schedul ing errors, and the associated explanations. 
It will be evaluated if these dosing errors will be reported as protocol deviations in the clinical database. All supplies and pharmac y documentation must be made available 
throughout the trial for the sponsor’s designated CRO  monitor to review.

argenx BVBA Confidential Page [ADDRESS_1284003] 
All efforts will be made to ensure that the patient receives all administrations of IMP within 
the allowed visit windows. However, if a patient misses more than 2 consecutive scheduled 
doses, then he/she will be discontinued early from further IMP treatment (see Section 4.4.2). 
 Accountability of Investigational Medicinal Product 
Detailed instructions on accountability of the IMP will be included in the IMP management 
manual (pharmacy manual). 
 Storage of Blood Samples in the Trial 
Any samples remaining after the laboratory analyses as defined in the protocol have been completed may be stored for up to 15 years for future additional research to address any 
scientific questions related to efgartigimod, FcRn biology, or ITP, unless this would not be 
allowed according to local regulations or the patient would not agree. 
In addition, blood samples may be used to validate methods to measure efgartigimod, 
antibodies, and biomarkers.

 7. TRIAL ASSESSMENTS 
 Demography 
Demographic characteristics comprise age, year of birth, gender, race, and ethnicity 
(per local regulations). 
 Efficacy 
Procedures assessing the efficacy of efgartigim od will mainly focus on measures of response 
derived from platelet counts. These assessments  will be performed at the weekly visits 
predose on all IMP administration days, and at  the unscheduled visits (if needed), as 
specified in the SoA ( Table 1 ). 
7.2.1. Platelet Count 
The assessment of platelet count can be perfor med within 1 day prior to any other trial-
specific assessment (except at screening, wher e the informed consent should be obtained and 
weight assessed first, and at randomization) at each visit as specified in the SoA ( Table 1 ). 
The samples will be analyzed locally. For a si ngle patient, baseline a nd post-baseline platelet 
count assessments need to be performed at the same facility throughout the trial. 
In addition, the absolute  and the  
 will be measured locally in facilities equipped 
with a hematology analyzer which can determine this . 
7.2.2. General Bleeding Assessment 
Signs and symptoms of bleeding are the predominant clinical manifestation of ITP and are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_913750]. 
The WHO bleeding scale is a widely recognized tool to assess bleeding and has been used in 
many previous ITP trials. The occurrence and severity of any bleeding symptoms will be 
assessed and recorded at each visit using the WHO bleeding scale ( Appendix 3) as specified 
in the SoA (Table 1 ). The WHO bleeding scale was originally developed to assess bleeding 
in patients undergoing treatment for cancer and has been used extensively.11 
The wide use of the scale and incorporati on into the common terminology criteria for AEs 
(CTCAE) suggest that it is commonly used by [CONTACT_15098], is applicable across populations and 
cultures, and is responsive to changes in bl eeding severity. While validated for mild to 
moderate bleeding in ITP, validation for severe bleeding events in ITP has not yet been 
performed.12

argenx BVBA Confidential Page [ADDRESS_1284004] of monitoring and recording all safety information including 
pregnancies, safety laboratory testing, meas urement of vital signs, ECG, physical 
examination, and other tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the trial treatment in all patients. As discussed in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , any pregnancy in a female patient 
(or partner of a male patient) that occurs while the patient is enrolled in the trial will also be monitored and reported according to the appropr iate regulations. Although a pregnancy is not 
considered as an (S)AE, any adverse pre gnancy outcome, complication, or elective 
termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons wi ll be recorded and reported as an (S)AE. 
An independent unblinded DSMB will  periodically review the safety  data as described in the 
DSMB charter (Section 7.3.5). 
The investigator is responsible for recording all AE(SI)s observed during the trial from the 
time the patient signs the ICF until the last contact [CONTACT_10970]. 
7.3.1. Adverse Events 
Definition of AE 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial patient, temporally associated with the use of IMP, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or IMP. 
Note: An AE can therefore be any unfavorab le and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the 
use of IMP, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or IMP. 
The following events will be collected as AEs: 
x Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the 
medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to progression of underlying disease). 
x Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. 
x New conditions detected or diagnosed after IMP administration even though it may 
have been present before the start of the study. 
x Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected intervention-intervention 
interaction. 
x Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either IMP or a 
concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it 
is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. 
15 July 2021 ARGX-113-1801 
ARGX-113/efgartigimod Protocol Version 6.0, Final 
 
argenx BVBA Confidential Page 68 of 162 
 x “Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy 
assessments. However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from 
lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. 
The following events will NOT be collected as AEs: 
x Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by 
[CONTACT_913789]’s condition.  
x The disease/disorder being studied or e xpected progression, signs, or symptoms of 
the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the 
patient’s condition.  
Note: Except for any occurrence of bleedi ng, which will be considered an AESI 
as per section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
x Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the AE. 
x Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). 
x Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 
Death is not considered an AE in itself but a (fatal) outcome of an SAE.

ARGX-113/efgartigimod Protocol Version 6.0, Final 
 
argenx BVBA Confidential Page [ADDRESS_1284005] medical occurrence that at any dose: 
x Results in death 
x Is life-threatening (the term “life-threatening ” in the definition of “ serious ” refers to an 
event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to 
an event, which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe) 
x Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3850]. In general, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_913751]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the 
physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10911]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_913752], the event will be considered as serious. When in doubt as to whether 
“hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre-existing condition that did not worsen 
from baseline is not collected as an AE. 
x Results in persistent or signifi cant disability or incapacity 
The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions. 
This definition is not intended to incl ude experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle), which may interfere with or prevent everyday life 
functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. 
x Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
x Other situations: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised by [CONTACT_913790] 1 of the other ou tcomes listed in the above definition. 
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, convul sions, or development of intervention 
dependency or intervention abuse. 
Suspected transmission of any infectious agen t via the IMP will also be treated as an 
SAE. 
An unexpected AE is any adverse drug event, which is not listed in the reference safety 
information in the current IB section 7 or is not listed at the specificity or intensity that has 
been observed. The assessment of expectedness will be the responsibility of the sponsor.

argenx BVBA Confidential Page 70 of 162 
 Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for wh ich there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE. 
Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, seve rity (using the CTCAE criteria version 5.0), 
seriousness, and causal relationship to the IMP or trial procedures. The action taken with the 
investigational drug and the outcome of the event must also be recorded. Overdose or Medication Error 
For this trial, a variation of less than ±10% of the amount of efgartigimod will not be 
considered an overdose/underdose or medication error, while a variation greater than 
±10% of the intended amount of efgartigimod will be considered a medication error and/or overdose without AE (see Section 6.1). 
An overdose is defined as a deliberate or accidental administration of IMP to a patient, at a 
dose greater than that which was assigned to that patient per the trial protocol. 
A medication error is any preventable incident that may cause or lead to inappropriate IMP 
use or patient harm while the IMP is in the control of health care professionals. Such incident may be due to health care professional practice , product labeling, packaging and preparation, 
dispensing, distribution, administrati on, education, monitoring, and use. 
In case of suspected overdose or medication error, the patient should be treated according to standard medical practice based on the investigator’s judgment. The suspected overdose or 
medication error with the quantity of the excess dose should be documented in the eCRF 
including the additional AE, if any. 
Severity 
All AEs observed will be graded using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE 
version 5.0. The NCI CTCAE is a descriptive terminology, which can be utilized for AE reporting. A grading (severity) scale is provided for each AE term. The grade refers to the 
severity of the AE. If a particular AE’s severity is not specifically graded by [CONTACT_703621], the investigator is to use the general NCI CTCAE definitions of grade [ADDRESS_1284006] medical judg ment. The CTCAE displays grades 1 through 5 
with unique clinical descriptions of severity  for each AE based on the following general 
guideline: 
x Grade 1: mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated 
x Grade 2: moderate; minimal, local or noni nvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living 
x Grade 3: severe or medically significant  but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318] i ndicated; disabling; limiting self-care 
activities of daily living

 x Grade 4: life-threatening conseque nces; urgent intervention indicated 
x Grade 5: death related to AE 
Note: a semi-colon indicates “or” within the description of the grades. 
Relationship 
The causal relationship between the IMP/trial procedures and the AE has to be characterized 
as unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, and related. 
x Events can be classified as “unrelated” if there is no reasonable possibility that the IMP 
caused the AE. 
x An “unlikely” relationship suggests that only a remote connection exists between the 
IMP and the reported AE. Other conditions , including chronic illness, progression or 
expression of the disease state, or reaction to concomitant medication, appear to explain 
the reported AE. 
x A “possible” relationship  suggests that the association of the AE with the IMP is 
unknown; however, the AE is not reasonably supported by [CONTACT_145037]. 
x A “probable” relationship suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of the AE with 
drug administration exists and, in the investigator’s clinical judgment, it is likely that a 
causal relationship exists between the drug administration and the AE, and other conditions (concurrent illness, progression or expression of di sease state, or concomitant 
medication reactions) do not appear to explain the AE. 
x A “related” relationship suggests that the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence 
from administration of IMP, it follows a known or expected response pattern to the IMP, 
and it cannot reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_913791]’s clinical 
state. 
In the final evaluation for reporting, the relationship will be converted into a “binary 
determination” as per CIOMS. Unrelated and unlikely will be clubbed into “unrelated, ” and 
related, possible, and probable will be clubbed into “ (at least possibly) r elated” for final 
reporting purpose. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events of Special Interest 
An AESI (serious or non-serious, related or not related) is an event of scientific and medical 
concern specific to the sponsor’s product or program (eg, an underlying condition being 
investigated, a mechanism of action li ke potential immunosuppression, etc). Further 
characterizing information will be collected in th e eCRF. This event could be expected due to 
the natural progression of the underlying disease,  disorder, or condition of the patient(s) and 
the patient’s predisposing risk factor profile including concomitant medications ( eg, bruising 
in patients with ITP).

argenx BVBA Confidential Page 72 of 162 
 Efgartigimod treatment induces reductions in IgG levels, and there is a potential risk for 
infections associated with low IgG levels. As su ch, infections are considered AESI in this 
trial. 
Due to the nature of underlying disease (ie, IT P), any occurrence of bleeding will also be 
considered an AESI. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
All AEs that occur during the trial, from signa ture of the ICF until the last trial-related 
activity are to be recorded on the appropriate AE pages (either “serious ” or “non-serious” ) of 
the eCRF. The investigator should complete all the details requested, including date of onset, 
time of onset, stop date (when applicable), st op time (when applicab le), severity, action 
taken, outcome, and relationship to IMP and to trial procedures. Each event should be 
recorded separately in the eCRF. 
Any SAE, including death due to any cause, which occurs during this trial after signature [CONTACT_913836], whether or not related to the IMP, must be reported immediately (within 24 hours of 
the trial site’s knowledge of the event). All SAEs will be recor ded on the paper SAE report 
form and the AE form in the eCRF. The invest igator or designated site staff should check 
that all entered data is consistent. An alert email for the SAE report in the eCRF will then automatically be sent by [CONTACT_109356] ’s designated CRO safety mailbox via the 
electronic data capture (EDC) system. The pa per SAE report form should be faxed or 
emailed to the s ponsor’s designated CRO  (see the Safety Mailbox/Fax details on the title

The report will contain as much available information concerning the SAE as possible, to 
enable the sponsor (or an authorized representative) to file a report, which satisfies regulatory reporting requirements. These timelines apply to initial reports of SAEs and to all follow-up 
reports. 
Criteria for documenting the relationship to IMP as well as severity, outcome, and action 
taken will be the same as those previously described. 
All SAEs that are spontaneously reported within [ADDRESS_1284007] trial visit are to be 
collected and reported in the safety database , and all efforts should be made to follow-up 
until resolution. 
Additional follow-up information should be comp leted and entered on a paper SAE report

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Authorities and 
Investigators 
The s ponsor’s designee will be responsible for reporting all suspected ADRs that are both 
serious and unexpected, and a ny other applicable reports to regulatory authorities, IRB/IEC, 
and investigators, in accordance with national regulations in the countries where the trial is 
conducted. Relative to the first awareness of the event by/or further provision to the 
sponsor’s designee, these events will be subm itted within 7 days for fatal and life-threatening 
events and 15 days for other events, unless otherwise required by [CONTACT_2091]. The sponsor’s designee will also prepare an expedited report for other safety issues where 
applicable. 
The investigational site will also forward a copy of all expedited reports to his or her 
IRB/IEC in accordance with national regulations. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Follow-up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
Any AEs observed from signing the ICF to the last trial-related activity will be followed-up 
until resolution, until the patient is lost to follow-up, or until the patient withdraws consent. 
Resolution means that the patient has returned to a baseline state of health or the investigator 
does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the AE. 
Every effort should be made to follow all (S)AEs considered to be related to the IMP or trial 
procedures until an outcome can be reported. If the patient is lost to follow-up, all AEs will 
be categorized based on the i nvestigator’s last assessment.  
During the trial period, resolution of SAEs (w ith dates) should be documented on the AE 
page of the eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilitate source data verification. If, 
after follow-up, return to the baseline statu s or stabilization cannot be established, an 
explanation should be recorded on the SAE form. 
All pregnancies reported during the trial s hould be followed until pregnancy outcome. 
For SAEs, AESI, non-serious AEs, and pregnancies, the sponsor ’s designee may follow -up 
by [CONTACT_756], fax, electronic mail, and/or a monit oring visit to obtain additional case details 
and outcome information (eg, from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_913753], consultant reports, or 
autopsy reports) in order to perform an inde pendent medical assessment of the reported case. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting and Follow-up Requirements for Pregnancies 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Pregnancies in Female Patients 
A serum pregnancy test will be performed central ly at screening. A urine pregnancy test will 
be conducted and analyzed locally at the visits detailed in the SoA ( Table 1 ).

argenx BVBA Confidential Page [ADDRESS_1284008] IMP, the sponsor and/or sponsor ’s designee should be informed 
immediately (ie, within 24 hours of the trial site’s knowledge of the event ). The following 
actions will be performed: 
x The patient should immediately be discontinued from IMP treatment. 
x The patient should have the Early Disconti nuation assessments and enter the 4-week 
follow-up period. 
x All assessments for Early Discontinuation (see Section 4.4.1) must be performed unless 
contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] (harmful to fetus) or unless the patient withdraws 
informed consent. 
The investigator must update the patient with  information currently known about potential 
risks and available treatment alternatives. The pregnancy should be followed-up to determine 
outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the 
presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or 
newborn complications. 
If required by [CONTACT_427], the female participant will be requested to sign a separate 
pregnancy ICF. 
Full details will be recorded on a paper pre gnancy report form and s ubmitted via email or fax 
(see the Safety Mailbox/Fax  details on the title page of this protocol), and reporting details 
will be specified in the trial manual. The investigator will update the pregnancy report form 
with additional information as soon as the outcome of the pregnancy is known. 
If the outcome of the pregnancy is an SAE, then this must be additionally reported as an SAE 
on the appropriate SAE report form. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Pregnancies in Female Partners of Male Patients 
Male patients will be instructed through the IC F to immediately inform the investigator if 
their partner becomes pregnant during the trial or up to [ADDRESS_1284009] 
IMP. A pregnancy report form  should be completed by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator within 24 hours after 
learning of the pregnancy and submitted via email or fax (see the Safety Mailbox/Fax  details 
on the title page of this protocol). Attempts should be made to collect and report details of the 
course and outcome of any pregna ncy in the partner of a male patient exposed to the IMP. 
The pregnant partner will need to sign an ICF to allow for follow-up on her pregnancy, its 
outcome, including if appropriate, the birth and health of the baby. Once the ICF has been signed, the investigator will update the pregnanc y report form with additional information on 
the course and outcome of the pregnancy. An investigator, who is contact[CONTACT_913792], may provide  information on the risks of the pregnancy and

treating physician and/or obstetrician. 
7.3.2. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Blood and urine samples for de termination of clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, 
coagulation, thyroid, autoimmune antibody testing, FSH (only for women of non-
childbearing potential), PK, PD, antiplatelet antibodies, viral testing, tuberculosis QuantiFERON test, and ADA will be collected an d analyzed at a central lab as indicated in 
the SoA (Table 1 ) and Appendix 1. The blood sample for platelet counts and the urine 
sample for the pregnancy test will be analyzed locally. 
In addition, the IPF# and IPF% will be measured locally in the facilities equipped with a 
hematology analyzer which can determine this platelet subset. 
Patients may be rescreened (ie, redoing the full assessments as per SoA, Table 1 ) or retested 
once (ie, repeating [ADDRESS_1284010], see Section 4.7) if still within the screening period. 
On days that IMP is administered, blood for  laboratory assessments should be collected 
before dosing. Additional safety samples may be collected if clinically indicated, at the discretion of the 
investigator. 
For all female patients of childbearing potenti al, a serum pregnancy test will be performed 
centrally at screening (on the samples taken for clinical laboratory tests), and a urine 
pregnancy test will be conducted and analyzed locall y at the site at the visits specified in the 
SoA ( Table 1 ). 
The estimated total maximum blood volume need ed for a patient during the trial (when 
completing the trial) is approximately [ADDRESS_1284011] be

 7.3.3. Vital Signs, Physical Examination, and Electrocardiogram 
The assessment of vital signs (supi[INVESTIGATOR_888038], heart rate , and body temperature) 
physical examination, and ECG will be performed at the time points indicated in the SoA 
(Table 1 ). 
Supi[INVESTIGATOR_913754] m easured using standard equipment after at least 
[ADDRESS_1284012]. 
It is recommended that the method used to measure body temperature at screening is 
maintained throughout the trial for each patient. 
A physical examination will include at a minimum an assessment of general appearance, 
skin, lymph nodes, musculoskeletal/extremitie s, abdomen, cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], and 
neurological system. 
Height will be measured at screening only. Wei ght will be measured at screening and at any 
IMP infusion visit. For the assessment of height  and weight, patients will be required to 
remove their shoes and wear light indoor clothing. 
A single 12-lead ECG will be taken post-dose at a paper speed of 25 mm/sec in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_913755] [ADDRESS_1284013] be reported on the relevant medical history/current medical conditions page of the eCRF, including start and end dates, if known. The date of ITP diagnosis as well as the date of confirmation of the diagnosis according to the ASH criteria

The sponsor will appoint an independent DSMB consisting of an independent group of 
clinical experts who are not involved in the trial management. They will be supplemented by 
[CONTACT_55467]. The objective of the DSMB will be to rev iew all unblinded safety 
data (including the overall number of patients tr eated up to that point, rates, and patient-level 
details) and the evaluation of IgG. The planni ng and frequency of the meetings will be 
detailed in a DSMB charter. In addition, ad hoc meetings can be requested at any time during the trial by [CONTACT_350197]. The DSMB will advise the sponsor regarding 
continuation, modification, or terminati on of the trial after every meeting. 
Additionally, the composition, objectives, role,  and responsibilities of the independent 
DSMB will be described in the DSMB charter, agreed with the DSMB members and the 
sponsor. The DSMB charter will also define and document the content of the safety 
summaries and general procedures (including communications).
 
7.3.6. Visit Reminder/Patient ID Card 
Patients must be provided with the address and telephone number of the main contact [CONTACT_202058]. The i nvestigator must therefore provide a “Visit 
Reminder/Patient ID Card” to each patient. In an emergency situation this card serves to 
inform the responsible attending physician that the patient is in a clinical trial and that relevant information may be obtained by [CONTACT_21947]. Patients must be 
instructed to keep the card in their possession at all times. 
 Pharmacokinetics 
Blood samples for PK will be collected from each patient as presented in the SoA ( Table 1 ). 
Concentrations of efgartigimod will be deter mined using a validated assay. The actual date 
and time of collection of the bl ood sample will be recorded in the relevant section of the 
eCRF, as well as the reason in case no sample was taken. 
The PK samples will be taken predose (within 2 hours prior to start of IMP infusion) and 
post-dose (within 30 minutes after the end of IMP infusion). 
 Pharmacodynamics 
Blood samples for the determina tion of the PD markers (total IgG, IgG subtypes [IgG1, 
IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4]) will be collected as indicated in the SoA ( Table 1 ). Sampling will be 
done predose on IMP administration visits. Samples will be analyzed by [CONTACT_11378]. In order to maintain the blind, the IgG testing cannot be performed locally. 
These PD markers will be determined using validated assays.

 Additionally, presence, nature, and level of antiplatelet antibodies will be tested as indicated 
in the SoA (see Table 1 ). 
The actual date and time of collection of the blood sample will be recorded in the relevant 
section of the eCRF, as well as the reason in case no sample was taken. 
 Anti-Drug Antibodies 
Blood samples to assess ADA will be collected as indicated in the SoA ( Table 1 ). Sampling 
will be done predose on IMP administration visits. 
All samples will be analyzed first in a validated screening assay, followed by [CONTACT_913793] a confirmation assay. 
Finally, in samples scoring positive in both abovementioned assays, a titration of the ADA 
response will be performed and samples will be tested for neutralizing ADAs. 
The actual date and time of collection of the blood sample will be recorded in the relevant 
section of the eCRF, as well as the reason in case no sample was taken. 
  
The sample to measure the  has to be collected as the last sample 
predose as indicated in the SoA ( Table 1 ) in sites participating in the

The actual date and time of collection of the blood sample will be recorded in the relevant section of the eCRF, as well as the reason in case no sample was taken. 
The sample will be used for an exploratory endpoi nt and will be analyzed in a specialty lab. 
 Quality-of-Life and Patient-Reported Outcomes 
The patient will complete the QoL questionna ire (SF-36 v2.0) and the PRO (FACT-Th6 and 
FACIT-Fatigue Scale) as indicated in the SoA ( Table 1 ). 
FACT-Th6: The FACT-Th6 uses the Likert scale, with patients rating their degree of 
concern in the past 7 days. The 6 selected items pertain to ability to do usual activities, worry about problems with bleeding or bruising, worry about the possibility of serious bleeding, avoidance of physical or social activity because  of concern with bleeding or bruising and 
frustration due to the inability to carry out usual activities.
13 
SF-36 v2.0: The SF-36 is a 36-item scale constructed to survey health-related QoL on 8 domains: limitations in physical activities due to health problems; limitations in social 
activities due to physical or emotional problems; limitations in usual role activities due to 
physical health problems; bodily pain; general mental health (psychological distress and 
well-being); limitations in usual role activ ities due to emotional problems; vitality (energy 
and fatigue); and general health perceptions.

 patients in the FAS with chronic ITP will be us ed. The analysis will follow the intent-to-treat 
principle, ie, patients will be analyzed accordi ng to their randomized treatment, irrespective 
of the treatment they actually received. 
The per protocol (PP) population is a subset of the FAS, ie, all patients from the FAS without 
a major protocol deviation. The PP population will be used for sensitivity analyses for the primary and key secondary endpoints. 
The safety analysis set comprises all pa tients in the randomized population who have 
received at least 1 dose or part of a dose of IMP.  Patients will be analyzed according to the 
actual treatment received for safety analyses. 
 Patient Disposition, Characteristics, and Concomitant Medication 
A tabular presentation of the patient disposition will be provided. It will include the number 
of patients screened, randomized, received IMP tr eatment, completed the trial, as well as the 
number of early discontinuations from IMP trea tment (including rescued patients) and trial, 
with reasons for discontinuation from IMP tr eatment or trial, and major protocol deviations. 
A listing will be presented to describe date s of screening, screen failure with reason, 
randomization or assigned treatment, completi on or early discontinuation, and the reason for 
discontinuation, if applicable, for each patient. 
Patient characteristics will be listed and summarized (by [CONTACT_6654]). 
Summaries will include descriptive statis tics for continuous measures (number of 
observations, mean, standard deviation, median, 1st quartile, 3rd quartile, minimum, and 
maximum) and for categorical measures (frequenc y and percentage). Patient characteristics 
include, but are not limited to, age, sex, race, weight, body mass index, and baseline platelet 
level. 
Use of concomitant medication will be sum marized by [CONTACT_913795]. Separate summaries of concurrent IT P therapi[INVESTIGATOR_913756]. All concomitant medications used will be listed. 
 Statistical Methods 
All patients starting at least 1 infusion of efgartigimod or placebo will be assessed for safety 
according to their actual treatment. 
The efficacy analysis will be performed on the FAS or the subset of patients in the FAS with 
chronic ITP, and analyzed with intent-to-treat principle (ie, patients will be analyzed 
according to their planned treatment irrespect ive of the treatment actually received). 
Supportive analyses will be conducted in th e PP population. The safety analysis will be 
performed on the safety analysis set.

8.4.1. Primary Endpoint Analysis 
Definition of the estimand for the primary endpoint 
x Population: adult patients with chronic IT P, having an average platelet count of 
<30×109/L, and, at the start of the trial, either  being on concurrent IT P treatment(s) and 
having received at least [ADDRESS_1284016] 2 prior treatments for ITP 
x Variable: sustained platelet count response de fined as achieving platelet counts of at 
least 50×109/L for at least 4 of the 6 visits between week 19 and 24 of the trial 
x Main intercurrent events: 
i. early discontinuation of treatment (prior to visit 24) due to lack of efficacy (eg, more 
than 3 occurrences of rescue therapy) or due to an AE 
ii. initiation of rescue therapy at week 12 or later 
iii. increase of dose and/or frequenc y of concurrent ITP therapi[INVESTIGATOR_266263] 12 or later 
x Population-level summary: proportion of patients  with sustained platelet count response 
Handling of main intercurrent events 
A composite strategy approach will be taken to address the main intercurrent events described above. This implies that patients who discontinue treatment prior  to visit 24 due to 
lack of efficacy (eg, more than 3 occurrences of rescue therapy) or due to an AE, as well as 
patients who receive rescue therapy at week  12 or later, or for whom dose and/or frequency 
of concurrent ITP therapi[INVESTIGATOR_913757] [ADDRESS_1284017] 
stratified for the stratification factors hi story of splenectomy (yes versus no), receiving 
concurrent ITP therapi[INVESTIGATOR_772838] (yes vers us no), and for baseline platelet count level 
category (<15×109/L versus ≥15×109/L). The treatment effect will be presented as the odds 
ratio together with its 95% confidence interval (CI) and two-sided p-value. In addition, an adjusted difference of the proportions with its 95% CI will be provided. 
Handling of missing data 
Missing data for reason of 1 of the main intercur rent events will be handled as described 
above. Details on handling other missing data will be provided in the SAP.

ARGX-113/efgartigimod Protocol Version 6.0, Final 
 
argenx BVBA Confidential Page [ADDRESS_1284018] in the primary analysis, 
complementary analyses will be conducted wher e the main intercurrent events are handled 
differently, eg, by [CONTACT_913796]/or ‘treatment policy’ st rategy. Furthermore, an 
exact logistic regression analysis in which th e continuous baseline p latelet count level is 
added as covariate instead of the baseline platelet count category will be conducted as 
supportive analysis. Details will be provided in the SAP. 
8.4.2. Key Secondary Endpoint Analyses Subject to Alpha Control 
Extent of disease control is defined as the number of cumulative weeks over the planned 
24-week treatment period with platelet counts of ≥50×109/L. For each patient this number 
will be calculated by [CONTACT_913797] 1 until week 24 
(End-of-Treatment visit) at which the platelet count level is ≥50×109/L. A Wilcoxon-Mann-
Whitney test stratified by [CONTACT_913798][INVESTIGATOR_772838] (yes versus no), 
history of splenectomy (yes versus no), and baseline platelet count level category (<15×109/L 
versus ≥15×109/L) will be used to compare the extent of disease control between both 
treatment groups. The 2-sided p-value resulting from this hypothesis test will inform on 
whether the null hypothesis that the distributions of number of cumulative weeks for both treatment groups are identical can be rejected. The test will be conducted at a significance 
level α=0.05. An esti mate of the location shift will be provided, along with the associated 
95% confidence interval. When 1 of the main inte rcurrent events occurs, platelet count levels 
measured after the occurrence will be censored (or, they will not be taken into account for the 
calculation of the number of cumulative weeks). In other words, they will be handled as if the 
platelet count level were <50×10
9/L. Missing platelet counts because of early discontinuation 
due to lack of efficacy or due to an AE will be handled in the same way. 
Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to asse ss the robustness of the analysis results to the 
proposed handling of intercurrent events and missing platelet counts. 
Furthermore, a complementary analysis will be performed where extent of disease control is 
handled as a time-to- event endpoint (with “loss of disease control” being the event). Cox 
proportional hazards regression methodology will  be applied for this complementary 
analysis. Details on the model and the event and censoring scheme for this complementary 
analysis will be provided in the SAP. 
The key secondary endpoints on proportion of patients in the overall population with a 
sustained platelet count response and on propo rtion of patients in the overall population 
achieving platelet counts of at least 50×109/L for at least 6 of the 8 visits between week 17 
and 24 of the trial will be analyzed in the same manner as the primary endpoint. 
The number of bleeding events per patient (ass essed using the WHO bleeding scale; where 
WHO scale ≥1 at any visit is considered a new bleeding event) will be analyzed using a 
zero-inflated negative binomial model. This model will account for the large expected number 
of patients with zero bleeding events. It is a mixture model consisting of 2 components: a

stratification variables (history of splenectomy; receiving concurrent ITP therapi[INVESTIGATOR_772838]), 
and baseline platelet count as independent variable s. An offset term will be used to allow for 
patient exposure. Both the count model, using the log link, and the binary model, using the logit link, will contain the same independent va riables. The probability of no bleeding will be 
estimated for each randomized treatment group. A Wald test will be used to test the null 
hypothesis that the log of the bleeding rate ratio  on placebo and efgartigimod is equal to zero 
against the alternative that it is different fro m zero. The rate of bleeding over 24 weeks on 
placebo and efgartigimod will be provided, along with the rate ratio, 95% 2-sided Wald-type 
CI, and 2-sided p-value. Missing bleeding assessments for reasons of [ADDRESS_1284020] to meeting statistical si gnificance for the primary endpoint, the key 
secondary endpoints will be analyzed using a fixed-sequence testing procedure to maintain 
the overall type I error rate at 5%. The type I er ror rate of each individual test will be 5%, but 
the test will only be conducted if the analysis  for all previous endpoints in the pre-defined 
hierarchy resulted in a p-value <0.05. The order in the testing hierarchy of the key secondary 
endpoints is as follows: 
1. The extent of disease control defined as the number of cumulative weeks over the 
planned 24- week treatment period with platelet counts of ≥50×10
9/L in the population 
with chronic ITP. 
2. The proportion of patients in the overall population (chronic and persistent ITP) with 
a sustained platelet count response defined as achieving platelet counts of ≥50×109/L 
for at least 4 of the 6 visits between week 19 and week 24 of the trial. 
3. The incidence and severity of the WHO-classified bleeding events in the overall 
population. 
4. Proportion of patients in the overall population achieving platelet counts of 
≥50×109/L for at least 6 of the 8 visits between week 17 and 24 of the trial. 
Complementary analyses for the key sec ondary endpoints will be conducted. Subgroup 
analyses for the primary and/or the key seconda ry endpoints may be conducted. Details will 
be provided in the SAP.

Quality control will be applied to each stage of trial-related activities. 
The following steps will be taken to ensure  the accuracy, consis tency, completeness, and 
reliability of the data: 
x investigator meetings 
x central laboratories for clinical laboratory parameters 
x site initiation visit 
x routine site monitoring 
x ongoing site communication and training 
x ongoing oversight by [CONTACT_3211]’s designated CRO monitors of safety parameters and 
adherence to selection criteria 
x data management quality control checks 
x continuous data acquisition and cleaning 
x quality control check of the CTR 
x to avoid inter-observer variability, every eff ort should be made to ensure that the same 
individual who made the initial baseline deter minations completes all efficacy and safety 
evaluations, eg, for the completion of the WHO scale 
In addition, periodic audits can be performed as specified in Section 9.5. 
When audits or inspections are conducted, access must be authorized for all trial-related 
documents including medical history and concomitant medication documentation to authorized sponsor ’s representatives and regulatory authorities.

 Monitoring 
The sponsor has engaged the services of a CRO to perform all clinical trial monitoring 
functions within this clinical trial. The s ponsor’s designated CRO monitors will work in 
accordance with the SOPs of the CRO. 
Monitoring visits must be conducted according to the applicable ICH GCP guidelines to 
verify that, among others, the: 
x data are authentic, accurate, and complete 
x safety and rights of patients are being protected 
x the trial is conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol, any other 
trial agreements, and all appl icable regulatory requirements 
The investigator and the head of the medical institution (where applicable) agree to allow the 
sponsor’s designated CRO monitor direct access to all relevant documents. 
The investigator must ensure provision of reas onable time, space, and qualified personnel for 
monitoring visits. The sponsor’s designated CRO  monitor will perform an eCRF review, source document 
verification, and source document review. The source documentation agreement form describe s the source data for the different data in 
the eCRF. This document should be completed and signed by [CONTACT_456]’s designated CRO  
monitor and investigator, and should be filed in the i nvestigator’s trial file. Any data item for 
which the eCRF will serve as the source must be identified, agreed, and documented in the 
source documentation agreement form. 
Upon completion or premature discont inuation from the trial, the sponsor’s designated CRO  
monitor will conduct site closure activities with  the investigator and site staff as appropriate, 
in accordance with applicable regulations, ICH GCP guidelines, and CRO/sponsor 
procedures. 
 Data Management 
Data generated within this clinical trial will be processed according to the SOPs of the data 
management and biostatistic s departments of the s ponsor’s designated CRO.  
Case report forms are provided for each patient in  electronic format (ie, eCRF). Data will be 
transcribed by [CONTACT_913802]. Data must be 
entered in English. Guidelines for eCRF completion, including the collection of the 
investigator’s e -signature, will be provided by [CONTACT_2024]. Appropriate training and security 
measures will be completed by [CONTACT_16993] d all designated site st aff prior to the trial 
being initiated, and any data being entered into  the system for any trial patient at the site.

 The eCRF is essentially considered a data entry form and should not constitute the original 
(or source) medical records unless otherwise specified. Source documents are all documents 
used by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_201998]’s medical history, that verify the 
existence of the patient, the inclusion and excl usion criteria, and all records covering the 
patient’s participation in the trial. They can include lab oratory notes, ECG results, 
memoranda, pharmacy dispensing records, patient files, etc. The eCRFs should be completed 
by [CONTACT_1720] a qualified designee from the site as soon as the data are available. 
As a matter of regulation, the investigator is responsible for the accuracy and authenticity of all clinical data entered onto eCRFs. Prior to database lock, each completed eCRF must be 
reviewed for accuracy by [CONTACT_093], c orrected as necessary, and then approved. The 
investigator’s e -signature [CONTACT_913837] [CONTACT_093], and is true and accurate. The investigator will be required 
to electronically sign off the eCRF. 
The data will be verified for missing data, inconsistencies, and for necessary medical 
clarifications. Queries arising from these checks will be flagged to the trial site, and the trial 
site staff will correct data, confirm, or clarif y data as appropriate. The CRO will provide the 
details of the review process in a data manage ment plan and a monitoring plan. Any change, 
including the issuing of queries, will be fully audit-trailed by [CONTACT_27950], meaning the name [CONTACT_60696], time, and date stamp are captured, as well as the reason for change. 
Data will also be provided by [CONTACT_185079], such as the results generated by [CONTACT_350203], ECG reader, and IRT provider. This data will need to be reconciled with the 
data recorded in the eCRF before it can be merged with the eCRF data into the clinical 
database. The CRO will provide a data mana gement plan detailing this reconciliation. 
Adverse events, concomitant diseases, and medical  history terms will be assigned to a lowest 
level term and a preferred term, and will be  classified by [CONTACT_913803], high level group 
term, and primary system organ class accordi ng to the medical dictionary for regulatory 
activities thesaurus. 
Prior and concomitant medications will be cla ssified according to active drug substance using 
the WHO drug dictionary (WHO-DD). The generic name, the preferred name, and the WHO 
name [CONTACT_913838]-DD thesaurus. 
The anatomical therapeutic chemical classes wi ll be assigned to the prior and concomitant 
medications. 
 Quality Assurance Audit 
Trial processes, trial sites (including, but not limited to site visits, central laboratories, 
vendors), the trial database, and trial documentation may be subject to quality assurance audit 
during the course of the trial by [CONTACT_4209] ’s designee (CRO or other vendor) on 
behalf of sponsor. In addition, inspections ma y be conducted by [CONTACT_913804]

 Appendix 4 Possible Adaptations of Tria l Protocol During COVID-19 Pandemic 
The aim of the ARGX-113-1801 trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of efgartigimod 
(ARGX-113) 10 mg/kg intravenous (IV) in  adult patients with primary immune 
thrombocytopenia (ITP). 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it may not be possible to perform site visits as planned for 
this trial (see SoA, Table 2). The main adaptation presented in this appendix is the shift from 
site visits to home visits. 
Argenx has performed a critical assessment of the use of efgartigimod during the COVID-19 
pandemic. From discussions within the co mpany, the physician community, and patient 
associations it has been concluded that the risk/benefit profile of efgartigimod in ongoing clinical trials has not changed in the context of  this pandemic. This decision was made based 
on efgartigimod’s mechanism of action, the safety data generated to date, and provisions 
made in all clinical trials with efgartigimod regarding safety reporting and withholding 
treatment upon evidence of infection. This assessmen t will be reviewed regularly to consider 
new information about the pandemic and th e ongoing, continuous assessment of adverse 
events (AEs) reported during argenx clinical trials. 
Based on this risk/benefit assessment, th e clinical trial ARGX-113-[ADDRESS_1284029] as long as the COVID-19 pandemic affects the ability of the patients to attend the trial 
visits at the trial site. As soon as the situation returns to normal, the measures specified here 
will not apply any more. 
It remains at the investigator’s discretion to assess if it is in the best interest of the patient to 
participate/continue in the trial. Note that the home nurse, who will go to the patient in case 
of a home visit, could also be another qualified person to perform all tasks (eg, a trained qualified physician).

 Possible Adaptations  in ARGX-113-1801 Trial Protocol  During COVID-19 Pandemic 
Permission and Duration to Use the “Updated” Protocol Version  
This appendix to the protocol is intended for countries and/ or sites in geographical areas 
where COVID-19 has affected the trial sites’ workload  or travel restrictions are imposed. 
Prior to implementation of this protocol appendix, the trial site first needs to inform and 
obtain approval from the sponsor or the CRO. The initial duration of implementation of the 
protocol appendix will be agreed upon and can potentially be extended (upon written 
agreement) based on the local epi[INVESTIGATOR_475902]. When a home visit is performed under this COVID-19 appendix it should be documented as a COVID-19 home visit in the eCRF for the applicable visit. 
Testing for COVID-19 
Additional testing for COVID-19 beyond that mandated by [CONTACT_913811]’s screening and randomization is not re quired. See also Figure 2. 
Based on the exclusion criterion “ Clinical evidence of significant unstable or uncontrolled 
acute or chronic diseases other than ITP (eg, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, hepatic, renal, neurological, malignancy, infectious diseases, 
uncontrolled diabetes) despi[INVESTIGATOR_913759], which could put the patient at undue 
risk,” patients with ongoing COVID -19 would be excluded from participation in the trial. 
Protecting Home Nurse and Site Staff From COVID-19 
The home nurse and site staff should use person al protective equipment as directed by [CONTACT_913812]. 
Patients With COVID-19 (Either a Positive Test or With Symptoms) 
The instructions to manage infections in the main protocol are also applicable in case of 
COVID-19 (ie, it will be considered as an AESI). The administration of IMP may be 
temporarily withheld if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], it could put the patient at undue 
risk in circumstances as clinically significant  disease, including evidence of infection (see 
Section 4.5). 
During the pandemic, site staff or home nurse sh ould call patients prior to each visit to 
enquire about COVID-19 symptoms, and to chec k for exposure and infection with the virus 
before deciding to proceed with the visit using the flow charts below. In case the patient is 
placed in quarantine and is not able to receive IMP, the investigator can specify in the eCRF that there was no intention to administer IMP due to COVID-19. 
For all assessmen ts not performed at the trial site, “ COVID- 19: home visit” or “COVID -19: 
phone call” will be added as a comment in the eCRF.

 In case of (suspected) COVID-19, the patient will be treated as guided by [CONTACT_913813]. Patients will be observed for safety follow-up by [CONTACT_913814], if available and compliant with applicable regulations, eg, 21 CFR part 11, data 
protection regulation. In case the patient has to be  isolated for a period longer than 2 weeks, 
it will be discussed on a case-by-case basis with the medical monitor from the sponsor, 
and/or when appropriate the CRO, whether the patient can remain in the trial. 
The investigator can be contact[CONTACT_913815]/video call in case of 
concerns. 
Forms completed at the patient’s home have to be taken back to the site for data entry. In 
case the trial site would be closed due to the COVID-[ADDRESS_1284030] 
to be stored in a safe location until reopening of the trial site. 
Relevant records should be archived in the investigator site’s Trial Master File . The 
investigator/institution or delegate shoul d maintain adequate and accurate source 
documentation. 
Screening Visit 
The screening assessments should be performed at the trial site. In case the trial site is closed 
due to the COVID-19 situation, an alternative  convenient location considered appropriate by 
[CONTACT_23298] (and confirmed and approved by [CONTACT_456]) can be used (eg, an infusion center, local clinic , patient’s home ). 
If it is not possible for the patient to go to th e trial site and the patient cannot be screened or 
treated at an alternative convenient location due to the COVID-19 situation, the patient cannot start screening and has to wait until the situation changes and the patient is able to go 
to the trial site for the screening assessments. 
Please note that prospective protocol waivers remain unacceptable and that patients should 
not be included in trials without proper eligibility assessment, including performance of 
planned tests, and written informed consent according to national laws and regulations. The 
investigator remains ultimately responsible for obtaining informed consent, even when delegating this task to another individual knowledgeable about the research. 
Baseline Visit 
The baseline visit should be performed at the tr ial site. In case the trial site would be closed 
due to the COVID-19 situation, an alternative  convenient location considered appropriate by 
[CONTACT_23298] (and confirmed and approved by [CONTACT_456]) can be used (eg, an infusion center, local clinic , patient’s home ). 
Possible Home Visits/Home Assessments 
All other trial visits can be performed at home (or at an alternative convenient location) 
during the COVID- 19 pandemic. A home nurse will travel to the patient’s ho me (or an 
alternative convenient location) to conduct the visit(s). The investigator will talk to the patient via an audio or video interview to el icit AEs, concomitant medications, and the 
general well-being of the patient. The inve stigator will perform the WHO bleeding 
assessments using a video interview with the patient. This will be mentioned in the source 
documents as such.

 All assessments performed at home, should preferably be performed by [CONTACT_913816]. This person will get all materials and equipment 
needed in order to perform the home assessments. 
Blood and urine samples (except the urine pregna ncy test, samples for platelet counts) will 
preferably be shipped to and analyzed by a cen tral laboratory. Only in exceptional cases a 
certified local laboratory can be used; laboratory reports should be reviewed by [CONTACT_1275], any abnormalities will be evaluate d for clinical significance, and any significant

Adverse Events Definition of AE:  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical 
trial patient , temporally associated with the use of IMP,  
whether or not a pharmaceutical product is administered 
and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign  (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product or IMP, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product 
or IMP.  
Note: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of IMP, whether or 
not considered related to t
he medicinal product or 
IMP.  
The following events will be collected as AEs:  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, 
clinical chemistry, or urin alysis) or other safety 
assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from 
baseline, considered clinically significant in the Clarification.

medical and scientific judgment of the investigator 
(ie, not related to progressi on of underlying disease). 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-
existing condition including  either an increase in 
frequency and/or intensity of the condition. 
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after IMP 
administration even though it may have been present 
before the start of the study. 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected intervention-intervention interaction. 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a 
suspected overdose of either IMP or a concomitant 
medication. Overdose per se  will not be reported as 
an AE/SAE unless it is an intenti onal overdose taken 
with possible suicidal/self-harming intent. Such 
overdoses should be report ed regardless of sequelae. 
• “Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected 
pharmacological action” per se will not be reported 
as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in 
the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, 
symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they 
fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. 
The following events will NOT be collected as AEs:  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory 
findings or other abnormal safety assessments which 
are associated with the underlying disease, unless 
judged by [CONTACT_913822]’s condition.  
• The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe 
than expected for the patient’s condition.  
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. 
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence 
did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to 
a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). 
• Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre- existing 
disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the 
start of the study that do not worsen. 
An AE can also be a new disease or exacerbation of an 
existing disease (a worsening in the character, frequency, 
or severity of a known cond ition), if considered clinically 
relevant by [CONTACT_093].

transfusion or hematological s tem cell support) or lead to 
treatment discontinuation.  
Death is not consid ered an AE in itself but a (fatal) 
outcome of an SAE.  
Definition of SAE  
An SAE , experience or reaction, is defined as  any 
untoward medical occurrenc e (whether considered to be 
related to the IMP or not)  that at any dose: 
• Rresults in death 
• Iis life-threatening (the term “life -threatening” in the 
definition of “serious” refers  to an event in which the 
patient was at risk of death at the time of the event. It 
does not refer to an event,  patient is at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it was more 
severe) 
• rRequires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_913761]. In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_913762] (usually 
involving at least an overnigh t stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139090]/or treatment 
that would not have been  appropriate in the 
physician’s office or outpatient setting. 
Complications that occur du ring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23918]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_913763], the event will 
be considered as serious. When in doubt as to 
whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, 
the AE should be considered serious. However, a 
planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_913764], is not considered an SAE. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_913765] a pre- existing 
condition that did not wors en from baseline is not 
collected as an AE. (Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2144]/or surgical 
operations planned before a tr ial are not considered SAEs 
or if the illness or diseas e, which caused hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
existed before the patient was enrolled in the trial, 
provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way 
during the trial. However, the condition for which the 
surgery is required may be an AE).  
• Rresults in persistent or significant disability or 
incapacity

 Section(s) Change Rationale 
The term disability means a substantial disruption of 
a person’s ability to cond uct normal life functions.  
This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relatively minor medical significance such as 
uncomplicated headac he, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained 
ankle), which may interfere with or prevent everyday 
life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
• Iis a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
• oOther situations : Medical or scientific judgment 
should be exercised by [CONTACT_913823], which do not meet any of 
the criteria above, but ma y jeopardize the patient and  or 
may require medical or surgic al intervention to prevent 
1 of the other serious outcomes listed in the above 
definition above.  
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant 
cancers, intensive treatment for allergic bronchospasm, are blood dyscrasias 
(eg, neutropenia or 
anemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or , 
convulsions , or development of intervention 
dependency or intervention abuse  that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
An unexpected AE is  any adverse drug event, which is not 
listed in the reference safety information in the current IB 
or is not listed at the specific ity or intensity that has been 
observed.  
Suspected adverse reaction me ans any AE for which there 
is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE.  
Each AE is to be evalu ated for duration, severity (using 
the CTCAE criteria  version 5.0) , seriousness, and causal 
relationship to the IMP or trial procedures using the 
CTCAE criteria. The action taken with the investigational 
drug and the outcome of the event must also be recorded.

Extent of disease control is defined as the number of 
cumulative weeks over the planned 24 -week treatme nt 
period with platelet counts of ≥50×109/L. For each 
patient this number will be calculated by [CONTACT_913828] 1 until week 24 
(End -of-Treatment visit) at which the platelet count 
level is ≥50×109/L. A Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test 
stratified by [CONTACT_913829][INVESTIGATOR_17930] (yes versus no) and history of splenectomy (yes 
versus no) will be used to compare the extent of disease 
control between both treatment groups. The [ADDRESS_1284044] will be conducted 
at a significance level α=0.05. An estimate of the 
location shift will be provide d, along with the associated 
95% confidence interval. Extent of disease control 
defined as the number of cumulative weeks over the 
planned 24 week treatment period with platelet counts of 
≥50×109/L, will be analyzed using Cox regression 
methodology. The [ADDRESS_1284045] terms for random ized treatment and baseline 
platelet level. The model will be  stratified by [CONTACT_913799] (yes vs. no) and receiving concurrent ITP

test will be used to test the null hypothesis that the log of 
the hazard ratio on placebo an d efgartigimod is equal to 
zero (or, equivalently, that th e hazard ratio is equal to one) 
against the alternative that it is  different from zero (or, 
equivalently, that the hazard r atio is different from one). 
From the model, the hazard ratio for efgartigimod vs.

x Section 1.2. Benefit-
Risk Assessment More specifically, a ph ase 2 trial (ARGX-113- 1603) in 
patients with ITP enrolled a patient population who was 
predominantly refractory to previous lines of ITP therapy, 
with the majority of patients having long -standing disease, 
prior ITP treatment exposure and approximately half with 
baseline platelet count of <15×109/L. Thirty seven out of 
38 patients (97.4%) had a history of receiving at least 1 ITP 
therapy, either historical or  ongoing at baseline. The 
median number of prior unique treatments for ITP was 2.0 
(range 0 10). Twenty seven out of 38 patients (71.1%) 
were receiving at least 1 concomitant ITP therapy at 
baseline, including corticos teroids, immunosuppressants, 
and TPO RAs. 
… 
In clinical trials to date, efgartigimod has been well  
tolerated in healthy adult subjects and patients with MG 
and ITP, separately: the majority of treatment -emergent 
AEs (TEAEs) were considered to be mild (grade 1) in 
severity. In the completed phase 1 trials ARGX-113-
1501, ARGX -113-1702, and ARGX-113-1901 i n healthy 
volunteers, and in the phase 2 trial ARGX-113- 1602 in 
patients with MG, no grade ≥3 TEAEs were reported and 
no TEAE led to discontinuation. In the phase 2 trial 
ARGX -113-1603 in patients with ITP, 1 TEAE with 
grade 4 was reported (thrombocytopeni a), considered 
unrelated to treatment, and led to treatment discontinuation. 
In the MG trial ARGX 1131602, the most common TEAE 
was headache, reported in 4 of 12 patients (33%) treated 
with efgartigimod 10 mg/kg and 3 of 12 patients (25%) 
who received placebo. In the ITP trial ARGX 113 1603, 
headache was reported in 1 of 13 patients (7.7%) treated 
with efgartigimod 5 mg/kg and 2 of 12 patients (16.7%) 
who received placebo. In th e ITP trial, the most common 
TEAEs were petechiae 2 of 13 patients (15.4%) in the 5 
mg/kg group and 2 of 13 patients (15.4%) in the 
efgartigimod 10 mg/kg groups, hypertension in 2 of 13

of 12 patients (8.3%) with plac ebo, and vomiting in 2 of 13 
patients (15.4%) tr eated with efgartigimod 10 mg/kg. 
No deaths have occurred in any efgartigimod trial as of 
data cut off date. There is no eviden ce of an increased risk 
of infection.  
The only clinically relevant laboratory findings, observed 
after repeated administration of   efgartigimod 10 mg/kg, 
were decreased monocyte count (reported for 1 patient with 
MG) and abnormal differential white blood cell count in 
individual healthy volunteers after administration of a 
single dose of 25 and 50 mg/kg efgartigimod, which was 
associated with decreased CD8, CD3, CD56, CD4, and 
CD19 lymphocyte levels. All events were short lasting and 
resolved within 2 to 4 days. An increase in C reactive 
protein was reported in individual healthy volunteers 
administered 25 and 50 mg/k g efgartigimod. All events 
resolved within 3 to 6  days and were in general not 
associated with signs of fever or serious infections.  
In non clinical toxicology trials repeated administration of 
100 mg/kg (15 infusions, every 2 days) efgartigimod was 
associated with revers ible Kupffer cell 
hypertrophy/hyperplasia in rat, as well as hepatic 
cytoplasmic alterations and degeneration, and diffuse 
mixed inflammatory cell in filtrates (correlating with 
alanine aminotransferase [ALT] increase) in cynomolgus 
monkey. No such observat ions were made in a 6 month 
chronic dosing trial where cynomolgus monkeys were 
treated with 100 mg/kg efgartigimod once every week. In 
healthy volunteers, patients with MG, or with ITP, no 
clinically significant changes were observed in liver 
enzyme levels  (including ALT and aspartate 
aminotransferase), serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], or electrolytes (including 
potassium).  
No clinically significant change s in vital signs and/or 
electrocardiogram (ECG) findin gs have been observed in 
clinical trials to date.  
Safety for use during pregnancy has not been established. 
Therefore, efgartigimod should not be administered to pregnant or lactating women. No  fertility trials have been 
performed so far Reproductive toxicity trials are 
completed and in reporting phase.  
In summary, taking into account the efficacy and safety 
data collected up to date, the bene fit risk assessment allows 
further testing of efgartigimod.  
Please refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure for 
more information regarding the preclinical and clinical 
trials , and the potential risks and benefits of 
efgartigimod. In summary, the favorable balance 
between risks and anticipated efficacy/benefits supports 
the use of efgartigimod in clinical development.

Missing platelet counts for reason of one of the main 
intercurrent events will be handled as “no disease control ” 
(<50x109/L) in case of early discontinuation (prior to visit 
24). In case of initiation of rescue therapy, or increase of 
dose and/or frequency of conc urrent ITP therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], platelet 
counts will be censored as of  the corresponding start date.  
The key s econdary endpoint s on proportion of patients in the 
overall population with a sus tained platelet count response 
and on proportion of patien ts in the overall population 
achieving platelet counts of at least 50×109/L for at least 6 
of the 8 visits between vi sits 17 and 24 of the trial will be 
analyzed in the same manner as the primary endpoint.  
The number of bleeding events per patient (assessed using 
the WHO Bleeding Scale; where WHO scale ≥1 at any visit 
is considered a new bleeding event ) will be analyzed using 
a zero -inflated negative binomial model. This model will 
account for the large expected number of patients with zero 
bleeding events.  The model will be stratified by [CONTACT_913799] (yes vs. no) and receiving concurrent ITP 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_913770] (yes vs. no), at randomization. It is a 
mixture model consisting of 2 components: a negative 
binomial count model and a binary model for predicting 
excess zeros. It will have the number of events as the dependent variable and both randomized treatment and the stratification variables (history of splenectomy; 
receiving concurrent ITP therap ies at baseline) as factors 
in the model.
 An offset term will be used to allow for patient 
exposure. Both the count model, using the log link, and 
the binary model, using the logit link, will contain the 
same independent variables. The probability of no bleeding 
will be estimated for each randomized treatment group. A 
Wald test will be used to te st the null hypothesis that the 
log of the bleeding rate rati o on placebo and efgartigimod 
is equal to zero against the alternative that it is different 
from zero.  The rate of bleeding over 24 weeks on placebo

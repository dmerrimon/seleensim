with resectable, high- risk melanoma. Patients with prior adjuvant therapy 
including use of prior interferon alpha, pegylated interferon or vaccine) will be 
eligible after a [ADDRESS_1034585] stage IIIB/IIIC or 
stage IV resectable, oligometastatic (less than or  equal to 3 sites of disease, 
excluding bone  and CNS)  melanoma,  as per the American  Joint  Committee 
on Cancer (AJCC) stagirng system. Subjects will be treated with one of the 
following:  
 
• Arm A: nivolumab 3 mg/kg (+/ - 7 days) IV Q2W (4 doses) prior to surgical 
excision (CNPE).  
9   • Arm B: nivolumab  1 mg/kg  (+/- 7 days)  IV combined  with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  3 mg/kg

Study 
Assessments:  Pathologic response to neoadjuvant therapy is primary endpoint of the study. 
This will be assessed by [CONTACT_755867], percent tumor 
necrosis, amount of fibrosis and proliferation by [CONTACT_755865] H3. These 
factors will be assessed in a continuum over serial time- points including 
baseline,  prior to dose two (and potentially  dose  3 when feasible)  and 
surgical resection samples.  
 
Secondary  objectives include immunologic response which will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_755868]-treatment  and 
surgical  resection specimens.  Additional  secondary  objectives  include  objective 
response rate to neoadjuvant therapy as assessed by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 criteria. 
Recurrence free and overall  survival  will also be determined by [CONTACT_7419]-term follow  
up of these patients.  Safety  assessments  will also be made by [CONTACT_755869]  
4.0 criteria.  
Statistical 
Considerations  
: Sample  Size:  
 
A total of 53 patients will be enrolled on this study. Prior to Amendment 7, 
patients were stratified by [CONTACT_585545] (IIIB/IIIC/M1A  vs. M1B/M1C)  and 
PD-L1 tumor status and then randomized in a 1:1 ratio for Arms A and B. 
Twelve patients were randomized to Arm A,  and 11 patients were randomized 
to Arm B. After approval  of Amendment  7, thirty  patients  will be enrolled to Arm C 
without randomization, and Arms A and B will be closed to Enrollment. Patient 
enrollment is expected at a rate of 2 -4 patients per month.  
11  2 Background & Rationale  
2.1 Introduction  
Melanoma accounts for less than 2% of skin cancer cases but is responsible for the large  
majority of skin cancer deaths.[ADDRESS_1034587] 30 years worldwide.  In the [LOCATION_002] alone, the incidence has increased by  
[CONTACT_5554] 4% per year since  the early  1970s.  [ADDRESS_1034588] 
stage (stage  I), surgery  alone provides  good  long-term survival,  with over 90% of patients  alive 
ten years after treatment.  However, as the stage increases, the chance of recurrent or 
metastatic  disease  increases  substantially.  Less  than half of patients  with clinically  detectable 
lymph node involvement  and fewer than 15% of patients with distant disease will survive ten  
years.  [ADDRESS_1034589] available treatment has been interferon alpha- 2b therapy.4 Its use in 
treating patients with resected stage II/III disease has not consistently improved overall 
survival  in multiple  clinical trials  and generally  has poor tolerance  secondary  to significant  
treatment related toxicities. 5-10 Similarly, in the metastatic setting, high dose interleukin- 2 
produces  a low overall  response rate (16%),  and again,  with serious  toxicity,  so that it is given 
only to selected patients.[ADDRESS_1034590] class is small molecule kinase inhibitors to BRAF 
(dabrafenib and vemurafenib)  and MEK (trametinib),  which  have  demonstrated a survival  
benefit  and are FDA approved in BRAF  V600 mutated metastatic  melanoma.  12-14 The second 
new class of drugs  is immune checkpoint  inhibitors.  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125],  a monoclonal  antibody  (mAb) 
antagonist to CTLA -4, has improved survival  and is FDA approved  in both treatment naïve  
and pretreated metastatic melanoma.15,16 A second immune checkpoint mAb, nivolumab, 
which targets PD -1, demonstrated promising initial results and the phase III study  was 
stopped early due  to clear  benefit  in overall  survival  associated  with PD-1 blockade and is 
anticipated to be FDA approved by [CONTACT_5638] 2014.17,18 The role of these new therapeutic 
options  in the neoadjuvant  and adjuvant  settings  remains  to be fully elucidated  and is an active 
area of investigation.  The aim of this trial is to further clarify the benefit of PD -1 blockade 
(nivolumab)  alone or in combination with CTLA -4 blockade (ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125])  given to patients  with 
resectable, high-  risk melanoma.  
 
2.2 Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755802] T -lymphocyte -associated antigen- 4 (CTLA -4, CD152) was  the first recognized and 
is the best characterized inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule. 19,20 CTLA -4 is the only 
checkpoint  currently  targeted  with an FDA-approved therapeutic  drug,  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_43844]. CTLA -4 
functions  as a negative  counterpart  to CD28,  the required  costimulatulatory  signal  for the 
12  activation  and expansion  of T-cells.  CTLA -4 is an inhibitory  checkpoint  molecule expressed 
on activated T- cells and constitutively expressed on regulatory  T- cells (Treg).[ADDRESS_1034591] phase III study  of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125],  sponsored by [CONTACT_414]- Meyers  Squibb,  began enrolling  
patients in September 2004.  The trial enrolled 676 HLA -A*0201+ patients with pretreated, 
unresectable stage III or IV melanoma.  The patients  were  randomized 3:1:1  to receive  either 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755803]100 peptide vaccine, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_165], or gp100 alone.  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755804] 3 mg/kg every three weeks for four doses.  Patients were not routinely offered 
maintenance therapy,  however,  those  who progressed after responding to therapy  or who had 
stable disease after twelve weeks were allowed “reinduction” therapy. The primary endpoint 
of the trial was overall  survival  (OS).  The trial demonstrated  an OS benefit  in all patients  who 
received ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (median OS: 10.0 months for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755803]100, 10.0 months for 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_165], and 6.4 months for gp100 alone; p<0.003).  There was no difference in 
survival in patients who received ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755803]100 and those who received ipi[INVESTIGATOR_310946].  There  were  four cases  of complete responses  and multiple  cases  of long- term disease  
control  in patients  who received ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755805].28 Importantly,  long- term follow-  
up has demonstrated that approximately  20% of patients  achieve a long- term survival  benefit 
from ipi[INVESTIGATOR_582877],  a finding that  has been since  replicated  in multiple  studies  with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195176].29 Approximately 60% of patients treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755806] -related  adverse  event  (irAE),  with the rates  of serious  irAEs  (≥ grade  
3) of 10% to 15% in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_590951].15 Of the 31 patients who met criteria for and 
received “reinduction” therapy (progression after complete or partial response or stable 
disease),  19% achieved a complete  or partial response and 68% achieved disease control  
with similar toxicity to the original induction therapy.30 Based on this study, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755807] a dose of 3.0mg/kg to treat unresectable stage III and stage IV 
melanoma.  
 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755808]ïve melanoma  patients  in a randomized phase  
III trial evaluating ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755809].27 A dose of 10 
mg/kg  of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755810].  Five- hundred- two patients 
were  enrolled  and randomized 1:1 to receive  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755811] 22 or placebo plus dacarbazine at the same schedule.  Patients with stable disease or Response Evaluation 
Criteria  in Solid  Tumor  (RECI ST) objective responses  were  able to receive maintenance  
13  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755812]  12 weeks.  Of note,  based on emerging  consensus  from previous 
work with CTLA -4 blockade and other immunotherapy, the primary endpoint was changed, 
with FDA approval, from progression- free survival to OS prior to unblinding of the treatment  
groups or data analysis. 31,32 Ultimately, the trial showed that pati ents who received the 
combination of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755813] (11.2. months) compared to 
dacarbazine alone (9.2 months,  p<0.001).  The difference became more  pronounced with time, 
as the  combination arm had 20.8%  of patients  alive at three years  compared to 12.2% in  the 
chemotherapy  only arm. The toxicities  were  greater in  the combination  arm and  also greater 
than in many  of the previous  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755814]  (56%  ≥ grade 3), likely  secondary  to the higher 
dose (10 mg/kg)  of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755815].  However,  there  
were no treatment -related deaths reported.[ADDRESS_1034592]-line therapy  for unresectable 
melanoma.  
 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755816].  ECOG  1609 
is an on -going randomized phase III trial comparing adjuvant ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3mg/kg,  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 
10mg/kg,  and interferon  alpha- 2b therapy  in patients  with resected high- risk stage III or stage  
IV melanoma.33 The EORTC  [ZIP_CODE] phase  III trial is a double- blind,  randomized trial that has 
enrolled 951 patients  with stage  III melanoma  to receive ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  10mg/kg  or placebo  every 
three weeks for four doses then every three months for up to three years until recurrence or 
unacceptable toxicity.  Fifty-two percent of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse 
events.  The most common grade III/IV immune- related toxicities in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755817]  (15.9%  vs 0.8%),  hepatic  (10.6%  vs 0.2%)  and endocrine 
(8.5% vs 0%). Five (1.1%) died secondary  to treatment related toxicity.  The 3 -year relapse - 
free survival rate was 46.5% in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_44772], com pared to 34.8% in the placebo arm 
(p=0.001).  With a median follow up of 2.[ADDRESS_1034593] ratio of 0.75.34 
2.3 Nivolumab  
Programmed death 1  (PD-1) is a  more  recently  discovered immune  checkpoint receptor that 
has generated considerable excitement based on favorable preclinical profiling and initial 
clinical results.  Like CLTA -4, PD-1 is a transmembrane protein expressed on effector  immune  
cells.35 Also like CLTA -4, expression of PD -1 is inducibly expressed with lymphocyte 
activation,  although it is expressed  more  broadly  than CTLA -4 as it is also found on activated  
B lymphocytes and natural killer cells. 36-38 PD-1 is bound principally by [CONTACT_755870] 1 (PD-L1, B7 -H1) but also, to a lesser degree, by  [CONTACT_755871] 2 (PD-L2, 
B7-DC).[ADDRESS_1034594] a primary role in cancer tolerance and immune escape. 
Higher expression of PD -L1 on tumor cells is associated with a worse prognosis, more 
aggressive features,  and/or  resistance  to immunotherapy  in the large  majority  of cancers  that 
it has been characterized in. 40-[ADDRESS_1034595] proceeded to 
human clinical trials.  49,50,52- 54 Nivolumab  (MDX -1106,  BMS -936558,  Bristol- Myers  Squibb,  
14  [LOCATION_001], NY) is a fully  humanized IgG4 monocolonal antibody  that binds to PD -1, blocking 
its binding site.  It was initially tested in a phase I, dose escalation trial in 296 patients with 
heavily pretreated advanced melanoma (n=104), colorectal cancer (n=19), CRPC (n=17), 
NSCLC ( n=122), and renal cell carcinoma (n=34).  Nivolumab was given at 0.3, 1, 3, or 10 
mg/kg  in six patient  cohorts  followed  by [CONTACT_755872] 10mg/kg.  Patients  were  initially 
given a single dose and allowed additional doses if they demonstrated clinical benefit, however, the trial transitioned into a phase Ib where patients were dosed every two weeks 
and reassessed every eight weeks.  Treatment was continued for up to 96 weeks or until 
disease progression or complete response. Treatment with nivolumab was better tolerated 
overall than treatment with CTLA -4 blocking antibodies with no maximum tolerated dose 
achieved.  Only 14% experienced serious (≥ grade 3) drug toxicity and only 5% had to 
discontinue therapy secondary to this.  
 
Nivolumab treatment demonstrat ed substantial antitumor effect, with partial or complete 
responses (by [CONTACT_13407]) observed in patients with melanoma, NSCLC, and renal cell 
carcinoma but not colorectal cancer or CRPC.  Responses were observed across various 
doses at rates of 19 to 41% in melanoma, 6 to 32% in NSCLC, and 24 to 31% in renal cell carcinoma.  In addition,  disease stability  and mixed  response  were  observed in a substantial 
portion of patients.  In melanoma patients two and three year OS were 48% and 41%, 
respectively  and the median duration of response  in patients with an objective response was  
an impressive  22.9 months.
55 Further  analysis  of PD-L1 expression from 61 patients  who had 
pretreatment specimens available demonstrated an objective response in 36% of tumors 
expressing PD -L1 and none in PD -L1-negative tumors.17 
Nivolumab monotherapy has been extensively studied in a number of tumor types including 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and colorectal 
cancer  (CRC)  with body  weight  normalized dosing (mg/kg).  Nivolumab  pharmacokinetics  (PK) 
and exposures of subjects in these studies have been characterized by [CONTACT_755873]  (PPK)  analysis  of data collected  in these  studies,  together  with PK data from 
several Phase 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_1034596] shown that the PK of nivolumab are linear, with dose proportional exposures 
over a dose range of 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg, and are similar across tumor  types. Nivolumab 
clearance and volume of distribution  were  found to increase with increasing body  weight, but 
the increase was less than proportional, indicating that a mg/kg dose represents an over - 
adjustment for the effect of body weight on nivolumab P K. Given the relationship between 
nivolumab PK  and body  weight, a flat dose is expected to lead to lower exposures  in heavier 
patients, relative to the exposures in lighter patients.  
 
Using  the PPK model,  nivolumab steady -state  trough,  peak  and time-averaged concentration 
(Cminss,  Cmaxss,  and Cavgss,  respectively) were predicted for a flat nivolumab dose  of 240 
mg Q2W and compared to those following administration of 3 mg/kg Q2W in NSCLC, 
melanoma, and RCC subjects. A  dose of 240 mg nivolumab is  identical  to a dose of 3 mg/kg 
for subjects  weighing ~ 80 kg, which  is the approximate median body  weight  of subjec ts in the 
Phase 2 and 3 BMS clinical studies of nivolumab monotherapy. From the simulations, the 
geometric  mean  values  of Cminss,  Cmaxss,  and Cavgss with  flat dosing are  slightly  (< 15%) 
higher than that produced by a 3 mg/kg dose, and the coefficient of v ariation (cv%) in these 
measures of exposure are only slightly (< 10%) greater than that of 3 mg/kg dosing. Given 
the similarity of nivolumab PK across tumor types and the similar exposures predicted 
following  administration of  a 240 mg flat dose compared to 3 mg/kg,  it is expected that the 
15  safety and efficacy profile of nivolumab following a flat dose will be similar to that of 3 mg/kg 
nivolumab dose.  
 
Across the various  tumor  types  in the BMS  clinical  program,  nivolumab  has been shown  to be 
safe and well tolerated up to a dose  level of 10 mg/kg,  and the relationship  between Nivolumab 
exposure produced by 3 mg/kg and efficacy has been found to be relatively flat. Taken 
together, the PK, safety, and efficacy data indicate that the safety and efficacy profile of flat 
nivolumab dose every 2 weeks will be similar to that of a 3 mg/kg nivolumab every 2 weeks.  
 
In Arm C of this study after completion of the combination portion of the study, all subjects 
will receive flat dose 480 mg nivolumab every 4 weeks (Q4W), which provides a more 
convenient dosing regimen for subjects. Based on PK modeling and simulations, 
administration of nivolumab 480 mg Q4W will be started after steady state is achieved with 
the combination regimen. While 480 mg Q4W is predicted to provide greater (approximately 
20%) maximum steady state concentrations and lower (approximately 10%) steady  state 
trough concentrations, these exposures are predicted to be within the exposure ranges 
observed at doses  up to 10 mg/kg  Q2W used in the Phase [ADDRESS_1034597] similar efficacy  and safety  profiles to  nivolumab 
3 mg/kg Q2W.  
 
Hence, doubling the dose of nivolumab from 240 mg to 480 mg would extend the dosing 
interval  from 2 weeks  to 4 weeks.  Thus  a flat dose  of 480 mg every  4 weeks  is recommended 
for Arm C of this study. FDA approval of Nivolumab 480mg IV every 4 weeks was obtained on March 6, 2018.  
 
2.4 Relatlimab  (anti-LAG-3) 
LAG-3 is an inhibitory checkpoint molecule found on the surface of antigen presenting cells 
which may limit the anti -tumor activity of PD -1 blockade.  
 
Relatlimab as  a single agent  has had an acceptable safety  profile at  all tested  doses: 20,  80, 
240, and 800 mg, flat dose. The MTD was not reached up to 800 mg relatlimab Q2W. The 
combination therapy  of relatlimab  and nivolumab  when administered  sequentially  (nivolumab 
30-minute IV infusion followed by [CONTACT_755874] 1- hour IV infusion) has an acceptable safety 
profile of all dose combinations that have completed safety testing, up to relatlimab 160 
mg/nivolumab 240 mg Q2W. In addition, safety evaluation with alternative less frequent 
regimen (Q4W)  dose  escalation cohorts  are currently  under  investig ation  in Study  CA224020. 
The less frequent dosing regimens of relatlimab are designed to afford  more convenience to 
the target patient population and allow combination with less frequent nivolumab dosing regimens.  To date,  the sequential  administration  of relatlimab  160 mg/nivolumab  480 mg Q4W 
has been shown safe ([ADDRESS_1034598]) to move to the next cohort of relatlimab 240 mg/nivolumab 480 mg Q4W.  
16  Results  from a Phase 1 trial using both LAG-3 (BMS -986016)  and PD-1 blockade (nivolumab) 
have been shown to be safe with clinical activity in advanced solid tumor patients 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
 
Neoadjvuant therapy is a powerful platform to inform efficacy, toxicity and biomarkers of 
treatment response and resistance. We believe that biomarker driven neoadjuvant clinical 
trials provide critical insights into immunologic and molecular mechanisms of response and 
resistance that are essential for each novel combination therapy regimen. These trials 
combine the practical advantages of  limited patient numbers with the ability to use each 
patient’s biospecimens as a robust learning resource.  
 
Prior to Amendment 7, this neoadjuvant trial randomized to single agent nivolumab vs the 
combination  of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_411302]  (BMS  CA209- 291),  showed  suboptimal  responses 
with single  agent  nivolumab with 22% of treated patients  progressing  to no longer  be surgically 
resectable  during the  8 week duration of  neoadjuvant treatment  but also grade 3 toxicity  rate 
of 89% during neoadjuvant ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755818].  It is hypothesized that use of LAG -3 
with PD- 1 blockade may provide optimal efficacy with limited toxicity in the neoadjuvant 
treatment setting based on the below Phase 1 trial data.  
 
Study CA224020 is a Phase 1 dose escalation and cohort expansion study of the safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy  of relatlimab  administered alone and in combination with nivolumab 
in advanced solid tumors. As of cut -off date of 07 -Apr-17, preliminary proof -of-concept 
efficacy has been revealed in Part C in the combination treatment expansion cohort of 
advanced melanoma  with prior treatment  with anti-PD-1/PD -L1. All subjects  were  treated with 
relatlimab 80 mg + nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks. The overall ORR  was 11.5% (n=61 
response evaluable) with a disease control rate of 49%. Biomarker analyses showed that 
patients whose tumor associated immune cells expressed more LAG -[ADDRESS_1034599] 1% of nucleated cells within the tumor margin, compared to 
less than 1% LAG -3 expression (ORRs of 18.2% [6/33] and 5.0% [1/20], respectively). PD - 
L1 expression did not appear to enrich for response.  
 
The treatment group had the following characteristics: 1) Most patients had M1C disease 
(69%), 2) the cohort was heavily pretreated (76% with 2 or more prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]), 3) all 
patients had progressed while receiving anti -PD-1/PD -L1, and 4) progressive diseas e was 
the best response to prior anti -PD-1/PD -L1 in 40% of patients. Overall, relatlimab in 
combination with nivolumab demonstrated encouraging initial efficacy with a safety profile 
similar to nivolumab monotherapy.  
In summary, relatlimab in combination w ith nivolumab has shown the capacity to induce 
responses  in heavily  treated advanced  solid tumors,  with the added  ability  to trigger  responses 
in tumors that have demonstrated resistance to nivolumab therapy. It is hypothesized that response  rates  will be higher  in the neoadjuvant  setting this therapy  will be applied to patients 
who are not exposed to prior anti PD -[ADDRESS_1034600] initiated trials of dual checkpoint 
blockade for multiple malignancies.  
17  Preliminary phase I results of combination of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755819].62 The trial treated 86 
patients with concurrent (n=53) dose- escalation of the two agen ts or sequenced treatment 
(n=33)  with nivolimumab  in patients  previously  treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  In the concurrent  arm, 
treatment  was dosed  at 0.3 mg/kg  of nivolumab and 3 mg/kg of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  (cohort  1), 1 mg/kg 
of nivolumab and 3mg/kg of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (cohort 2), 3 mg/kg of nivolumab and 1 mg/kg of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (cohort 2a), 3mg/kg of nivolumab and 3 mg/kg of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (cohort 3).  Dose - 
limited toxicity was observed in cohort 3, so cohort 2 was treated as the maximum tolerated dose.  The concurrent treatment demonstrated considerably higher rates of adverse events 
than previous trials of either drug in monotherapy.  Treatment -related adverse events were 
noted in 93% of patients, serious treatment -related adverse ev ents (≥ grade 3) were seen in 
53% of patients,  and 21% of patients  discontinued therapy  secondary  to these toxicities.  The 
types of irAEs observed were similar to those seen in both nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755820].  The adverse events were well managed with immunosuppressant 
medication and hormonal replacement therapy (for endocrinopathies) and there were no 
treatment -related  deaths  observed.  In the concurrent  arm, 21 of the 53 patients  (40%)  were 
noted to have a response by [CONTACT_755875] (the primary endpoint) with the suggestion of a 
higher response rate when irRC and unconfirmed responses are included.  Remarkably, 16 
(76%)  of those with an objective  response had a tumor  reduction of 80% or more  with five 
complete responses  noted.  
62 Longer -term follow up has demonstrated a complete  response 
rate of 17% and a 1 and 2 year OS of 82% and 75%,  respectively.  Furthermore,  the 2a cohort 
(3mg/kg nivolumab and 1mg/kg of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]) has demonstrated a 1 and 2 year OS of 94% 
and 88%,  respectively.  This dosing group has been selected for further  study  with expanded  
enrollment  and on-going  follow- up.63 
Two additional  trials  of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755821]- 
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic renal cell carcinoma.  In both trials patients 
were given either nivolumab 3mg/kg with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1mg/kg or nivolumab 1mg/kg and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  3mg/kg  for every  3 weeks  for four cycles followed  by [CONTACT_20382]  3mg/kg  every  two 
weeks  until progression or unacceptable toxicity.  In NSCLC,  46 treatment  naïve patients  were 
enrolled at initial reporting.  Grade 3- 4 toxicity was seen in 48% of patients with 3 treatment 
related  deaths  and 16 discontinuing treatment  secondary  to toxicity.   Overall,  22% of 
patients achieved an objective response and, at the interim reporting of results, three of the dosing cohorts  had not achieved median duration of response  due to ongoing responses  (9+- 
21+ weeks).64 In the metastatic renal cell carcinoma trial, 44 patients were enrolled at initial 
reporting.  Grade 3- 4 toxicity was seen in 43% of patients.  No patients died from  treatment 
related  toxicity  and seven discontinued  treatment due  to toxicity.  An objective response was 
seen in 34% of patients with 14/15 responses on -going (4.1+ -21+ weeks) at the time of last  
reporting.65 
On September 30, 2015 the FDA granted accelerated approval to the use of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755822], unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma. This was based on a randomized double blinded clinical trial showing response 
rates  of 60% for combination treated  patients  vs. 11% for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755823].  PFS for 
patients  on the combination was 8.9 months  vs. 4.7 months  for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755824].

Safety of the combination of nivolumab and relatlimab was ass essed in study CA224020. 
Overall, based on preliminary data as of the clinical cutoff date of 15- Jun-2017, the safety 
profile  of relatlimab  in combination with nivolumab  is manageable,  with no maximum  tolerated 
dose (MTD) reached at the tested doses  up to 160 mg relatlimab  and 240 mg nivolumab (flat 
18  dose, every 2 weeks [Q2W]), with evaluation of the 240 mg relatlimab/240 mg nivolumab 
combination doselevel  ongoing.  At the time of the clinical cutoff  date (15-Jun-2017)  one dose-  
limiting  toxicity (DLT)  of Grade 5 myocarditis  was observed  at the 240 mg relatlimab/240 mg 
nivolumab combination dose level among five evaluable subjects. There was no dose relationship between the incidence, severity, or causality of adverse events (AEs) to 
combination therapy.  In the nine expansion cohorts,  a total of [ADDRESS_1034601] AEs  were  low grade  (Grade  1 to Grade 
2) with a total of 26 subjects experiencing a drug -related serious adverse event (SAE). All 
AEs, except for one Grade 5 myocarditis and one Grade 4 drug- induced l iver injury (DILI), 
were  reversible  and manageable by [CONTACT_755876], and/or following immunerelated AE algorithms. In summary the safety profile 
of the combination of relatlimab  and nivolumab appears  similar  to nivolumab monotherapy  in 
terms of both frequency and severity of AEs.  
A pattern of immune -related adverse events has been defined for treatment with nivolumab 
monotherapy and nivolumab in combination with other immune -targeting agents such as 
relatlimab.  Management  algorithms  have been  developed for these  events  and are provided 
in the Appendix. Most high- grade events are manageable with the use of corticosteroids or 
hormone replacement therapy (endocrinopathies) as instructed in these al gorithms.  
Myocarditis has been observed with nivolumab monotherapy treatment (see nivolumab IB). 
Given the grade 5 myocarditis event in the CA224020 study, and the known nonclinical 
mouse  double LAG-3/PD -[ADDRESS_1034602] been four grade 1 myocarditis cases (asymptomatic troponin elevations with 
imaging correlate of myocardial inflammation but without evidence o f cardiac dysfunction). 
Treatment was delayed in all cases, and precautionary steroid treatment was given without 
any of the participants developi[INVESTIGATOR_631196].  
Additional details on the safety profiles of relatlimab and nivolumab, inc luding guidance 
regarding myocarditis and other potential risks, as well as results from other clinical studies, 
are available in the relatlimab and nivolumab IBs.  
 
2.6 Neoadjuvant  Approach  
Increasingly,  systemic therapy  is being given in the neoadjuvant  setting  (prior  to surgery)  in a 
variety of cancer types including breast, rectal, and esophageal cancers.  There are many 
practical  and theoretical  advantages  to giving  systemic therapy  up front.  First,  giving  systemic 
therapy  prior to surgery  allows  patients  to receive and complete  the entire  course of systemic 
therapy  because  there are no potential  complications and deconditioning that are inherent  to 
major  operative  interventions.  Second, up  front systemic treatment  can shrink  the tumor  and 
increase the likelihood that the entire  tumor is  removed.  Next, obtaining the tumor specimen 
after it has been exposed to systemic treatment allows for an assessment of response to 
treatment  which  can be used as a prognostic  marker or, potentially,  to direct  further systemic 
therapy.  From a scientific standpoint, this tissue can also be used to help elucidate drug 
mechanism of action and determine biomarkers that can predict responsiveness to therapy.  
 
In immunotherapy, in general, and checkpoint blockade, in particular, there are theoretical 
advantages to giving therapy prior to tumor removal.  Neoadjuvant immunotherapy may be 
more effective than immunotherapy given in the immediate postoperative period as patients  
will experience some  level immunosuppre ssion  as a consequence of surgery.[ADDRESS_1034603] as there is potential exposure to tumor - 
specific  antigens,  immuno -adaptability  (antigenic  epi[INVESTIGATOR_145052])  of the immune  system  to 
changes in tumor cells, and cytokine signaling that may enhance the immune response. 
Checkpoint inhibitors augment the body’s inherent antitumor immune response by [CONTACT_755877] -related immunosuppression.  This allows the immune system to 
recognize tumor  associated antigens  and mount  an effective response against  them.  Having 
the intact tumor in place will allow the immune system greater exposure to the full range of 
immunogenic tumor epi[INVESTIGATOR_429385], thus may lead to a more effective response.

4 Ethical  Considerations  
4.1 Good  Clinical  Practice  
This study  will be conducted  in accordance with Good Clinical Practice  (GCP),  as defined by 
[CONTACT_5787] (ICH) and in accordance with the ethical 
principles underlying European Union Directive 2001/20/EC and the [LOCATION_002] Code of 
Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 50 (21CFR50). The study will be conducted in  
compliance with the protocol. The protocol and any amendments and the  subject  informed 
consent will receive Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) 
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_737410].  All potential serious  breaches 
must be reported to BMS immediately. A serious breach is a breach of the conditions and 
principles  of GCP  in connection with the study  or the protocol, which is likely  to affect, to 
a significant degree, the safety or physical or mental integrity  of the subjects of  the study  
or the scientific  value of the study.  Personnel involved in conducting this study will be 
qualified by  [CONTACT_8640], training, and experience  to perform t heir respective tasks. This study 
will not use the services of study personnel  where sanctions have been invoked or where 
there  has been  scientific  misconduct  or fraud (e.g., loss of medical licensure, debarment).  
[ADDRESS_1034604]/Independent  Ethics Committee  
Before study initiation, the investigator must have written and dated approval/favorable 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_5698]/IEC for the protocol, consent form, subject recruitment materials  (e.g., 
advertisements), and any other written  information to be provided to subjects. The 
investigator or BMS should also provide the IRB/IEC with a copy of the Investigator  
Brochure or product labeling information to be provided to subjects and any updates. The 
investigator or BMS should provide the IRB/IEC with reports, updates and other  information 
(e.g., expedited safety reports, amendments, and administrative letters) acc ording to 
regulatory requirements or institution procedures.

will provide the investigator with an appropriate (i.e., Global or Local) sample informed consent  form which will include all elements  required by  [CONTACT_12212], GCP  and applicable regulatory 
requirements. The sample informed consent form will adhere to the ethical principles that 
have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
 
Investigators  must:  
 
1. Provide a copy of the consent form and written information about the study in the 
language in which the subject is most proficient  prior to clinical study participation. 
The language must be non- technical and easily understood.  
 
2. Allow time necessary for subject or subject's legally acceptable representative to inquire about the details of the study.  
 
3. Obtain an informed consent signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_29159]'s legally acceptable representative and by [CONTACT_16994].  
 
4. Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_755830],  prior to 
the beginning of the study, and  after any revisions are  completed for new information.  
 
5. If informed consent is initially given by a subject’s legally acceptable representative 
or legal  guardian,  and the subject  subsequently  becomes  capable  of 
making and communicating his or her informed  consent during the study, consent 
must  additionally be obtained from the subject.  
 
Revise  the informed consent  whenever  important  new information becomes  available that 
is relevant to the subject's consent. The investigator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_1275],  should fully inform  the subject  or the subject's  legally acceptable 
representative  or legal  guardian,  of all pertinent  aspects  of the study  and of any new 
[ADDRESS_1034606]'s willingness to continue participation in the study.  This 
communication should be documented.  
 
The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects must be protected, respecting the 
privacy and confidentiality rules applicable to regulatory requirements, the subjects'  signed 
ICF and, in the US, the subjects’ signed HIPAA Authorization.  
 
The c onsent form must also include a statement that BMS and regulatory authorities have 
direct  access  to subject  records. Subjects unable to give their  written  consent  (e.g., stroke  or 
subjects with or severe dementia) may only be enrolled in the study with the consent of a 
legally  acceptable representative. The subject must also be informed about the nature of the 
study  to the extent compatible with his or her understanding, and  should  this subject  become 
capable, he or she should personally sign and date the consent form as soon as possible. 
The explicit wish of a subject who is unable to give his or her written consent, but  who is 
capable of forming an opi[INVESTIGATOR_755831], the clinical study at any time should be considered by [CONTACT_093]. The rights,  safety,  and well-being of the study  subjects  are the most important considerations and 
should prevail over interest s of science and society.  
 
[ADDRESS_1034607] a baseline biopsy and blood for genomic and immunologic analyses. On -treatment biopsies 
and blood  for biomarker  analysis  will be obtained in both groups  around  dose 2 and dose 
3 (if feasible). Neoadjuvant therapy will be administered over 7 weeks and will then be 
followed  by [CONTACT_755879].  If at any point during the course  of neoadjuvant  therapy there is 
clinical (worsening performance status) and/or objective evidence (new imaging data) to 
suggest rapid disease progression, the patient will be taken off study  and offered immediate 
surgery or other alternative treatment plan. If disease re mains resectable based on the 
updated scans and the assessment of the treating surgical oncologist,  patients  in both 
groups  will undergo  definitive surgical  excision  of visible  disease. Preliminary assessment 
of surgical margins will be obtained by [CONTACT_90169] -operative  frozen section when appropriate. If 
surgical margins are found to be microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_755832], patients will still be eligible for 
initiation of adjuvant therapy and no adjuvant radiation will be administered.  
 
All acquired tissue samples (baseline, on- treatment and surgical resection) will be used for 
biomarker analyses. Patients will be reassessed for initiation of adjuvant nivolumab once 
adequate wound healing has been achieved within 4- 6 weeks of surgical procedure. Both 
groups of patients will  then initiate on six months of adjuvant nivolumab  administered every 
two weeks. Restaging scans will be obtained every 12 weeks.  
 
Patients  with clinical stage  III (IIIB/IIIC)  or oligometastatic  stage  IV disease  will be 
screened for eligibility.  Patients  with disease that is determined to be surgically  resectable  as 
agreed upon by a multidisciplinary consensus conference will be eligible to be screened for 
the protocol. Disease will be considered unresectable if there is significant  vascular,  neural  
23  
or bony involvement and in cases where a complete surgical resection with negative  
margins cannot be safely performed.  Prior  to Amendment  7, forty patients were expected to 
be randomized in a 1:1 ratio between Arm A and Arm B. Subjects  would  then be stratified  by 
[CONTACT_585545] (IIIB, IIIC, M1A vs. M1B/M1C) and by [CONTACT_4002] -L1 + or PD -L1 – tumor status). 
After approval of Amendment 7, Arms A and B were closed to new patient entry and Arm C 
was opened to enrollment. Thirty patients  will be enrolled to Arm C without randomization.  
 
Figures 1a and 1b Study  Design Schema  
 
 
 
 
Based on analysis  by [CONTACT_755880] a meeting on July 11, 2017,  enrollment 
on Arm A and B was closed based on efficacy (Arm A) and safety (Arm B) concerns. At the 
time of study  closure, 23 total patients  were enrolled and treated; 12 in Arm A and  11 in Arm  
B. In Arm A, 22% of patients  experienced  disease progression and were  ineligible  for surgery 
prompting closure of this Arm. In Arm B, all patients have been able to proceed to surgery, 
however the grade 3 toxicity rate was 89% and 33% required delay in surgery related to 
toxicity. This Arm was closed due to concerns of toxicity and patient safety. Based on the 
above results, Arm C was created to explore the safety and efficacy of alternative dosing 
strategies to maximize efficacy while minimizing toxicity.  
 
In Arm C, 30 patients will receive relatlimab co mbined with nivolumab every 28 days for 2 
doses prior to surgery. The biospecimen collection plan will include blood and tumor 
collections at day 14 and day 28. Neoadjuvant therapy will be administered and will then be 
followed by  [CONTACT_755879].  If at any point  during the  course  of neoadjuvant  therapy  there  is 
clinical (worsening performance status) and/or objective evidence (new imaging data) to suggest rapid  disease progression, the patient will be  taken off study  and offered immediate 
surgery or other alternative treatment plan. If disease remains resectable based on the 
updated scans and the assessment of the treating surgical oncologist, patients  will undergo 
definitive  surgical  excision  of visible disease.  In the  adjuvant  setting,  patients  will receive 
24  
relatlimab and nivolumab every 28 days for an additional 10 doses.  Restaging scans will be 
obtained every 12  weeks in the adjuvant setting.  
 
 
 
5.2 Study  Assessments  
The primary  objective of this study  is assessment  of pathologic  changes  from baseline to on- 
treatment samples within each treatment arm. Blood and tumor collections are required at 
baseline (samples must be obtained within 28 days of treatment initiation), around dose 2 
and dose 3 of neoadjuvant  therapy in Arms A and B, and again at the time of definitive 
surgical excision. Biopsies around dose 3 for Arms A and B and at relapse are optional and will be done if medically safe and feasible. Patients in arms A and B will undergo  adjuvant 
nivolumab. Biopsies around dose 3  for Arms A  and B and at relapse are optional and will be 
done if medically safe and feasible.  
 
In Arm C, blood and tumor  are required  at baseline (samples  must  be obtained within  28 days 
of treatment  initiation),  at day 14 and day 28 of neoadjuvant  therapy  and at the time of definitive 
surgical excision. Patients in Arm C will then undergo 10 months of adjuvant relatlimab and nivolumab.  
 
For all treatment arms, research blood will be obtained every three months during the duration of adjuvant therapy.  Blood and tumor  will also be collected at the time of 
relapse for all treatment arms when possible.  
 
Secondary objectives of this study include assessment of immunologic changes in the  
tumor microenvironment and blood, treatment response based on imaging in response to 
neoadjuvant therapy, toxicity, RFS and OS. Subjects will be assessed with computed 
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at screening, after completion of 
neoadjuvant therapy and during the post -treatment follow -up period (refer to the Study 
Procedure Tables in Section 7.1 for scanning frequency).  Subjects will also be followed for 
survival.  Subjects  will be followed  for a minimum  of two years.  Safety  will be evaluated 
by [CONTACT_755881], chemistry 
and hematology  laboratory  values  and formal assessments  of adverse events (AEs).  
[ADDRESS_1034608]  has passed  screening evaluations  (see Section 5.4). Subjects  will then be assigned  a 
subject number and will be eligible for randomization to Arm A or Arm B. Subject 
randomization will be implemented by [CONTACT_755882] M.D. Anderson Cancer Center 
(https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/ClinicalTrialConduct ). Once  a subject number  has been 
assigned, it cannot be reassigned to any other patient. If the subject is prematurely discontinued from the study without having received the prescribed treatment, an additional subject may be enrolled as a replacemen t subject.  
 
There will be no randomization for patients  in Arm C. 
 
5.[ADDRESS_1034609]  will be eligible  for inclusion  in this study  only if all of the following  criteria  apply:  
 
1. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form 
 
2.  Patients must have histologically or cytologicaly confirmed Stage IIIB/C or Stage IV 
oligometastatic melanoma. Oligometastatic melanoma is defined as three or fewer 
areas of resectable disease excluding central nervous system and bone  
involvement. Patients with cutaneous, mucosal, acral, ocular or unknown primary melanomas are  eligible for enrollment. For patients with stage IV disease with distant 
lymph nodes  (stage M1a), a maximum of three separate lymph node sites fit the 
definition of oligometastatic disease. Resectable tumors are defined as having no 
significant vascular, neural or bony involvement. Only cases where a complete 
surgical resection with tumor -free margins can safely be achieved are defined as 
resectable. Details on melanoma staging per the American Joint Committee on 
Cancer  Version  [ADDRESS_1034610]  one melanoma deposit  that can undergo serial  biopsy 
(at least 2 time points) during the neoadjuvant phase of the protocol. Patients must 
be willing to provide tumor samples at the time points specified in the Study Procedure Tables (Section 7.1 ). 
 
4.  All patients  must  undergo a baseline tumor  biopsy. In Arms A and B, tumor biopsy 
for PD -L1 testing (PD -L1 positivity is determined by [CONTACT_55559] 1% of 
cells staining in the  membrane by [CONTACT_9064])  is required  for stratification. 
PD-L1 status  is not required for enrollment  on Arm C. The 28-8 clone  for PD-L1 testing 
is required  for assessment of PD -L1 status.  For patients  with stage IV disease,  site 
of tumor  biopsy  will preferably  be from non-lymph  node disease site. For PD-L1 testing, 
the biopsy should contain sufficient tumor content (>100 tumor cells/4 -micron tissue 
section). If a sample contains insufficient tumor content, a re- biopsy will be required 
to obtain a sample with sufficient tumor content prior to treatment.

whose menopausal  status  is in doubt  will be required to  use one of the 
contraception methods in Appendix [ADDRESS_1034623] 2 -4 
weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval 
depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post - 
menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without us e of a 
contraceptive method.  
 
12.  Childbearing potential and agrees to use method(s) of contraception. For a

teratogenicity  (preclinical studies have not been done), a highly effec tive method(s)  
of contraception (failure rate of less than 1% per year) is required.  
 
The individual  methods  of contraception and duration should be determined  
in consultation  with the investigator.  Women of childbearing potential  (WOCBP) 
must follow  instructions  for birth control  when  the half-life of the investigational 
drug is greater than 24 hours, contraception should be continued for a period of 30 
days plus the time  required  for the investigational  drug to undergo  five half-lives.

WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy  for 24 weeks (30 days 
plus the time required for  nivolumab and/or relatlimab  to undergo  five half-lives) 
after the last dose  of investigational  drug. WOCBP  must  have  a negative serum 
or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) 
within  [ADDRESS_1034624] use any contraceptive method with  
a failure rate of less than 1% per year The investigator shall review contraception 
methods  and the time period that contraception  must  be followed.  Men who are

and/or  relatlimab to undergo five half-lives) after  the last dose of investigational drug. 
In addition,  male  participants  must  be willing  to refrain from sperm  donation  during this 
time.  
 
Men who are sexually active with women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., 
who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile and azoospermic men) do not require 
contraception.

[ADDRESS_1034634]  Descriptions  
6.4.1 Nivolumab  (BMS -936558)  
 
Nivolumab  (BMS -936558)  vials must  be stored  at a temperature of 2°C to 8°C and 
should be protected from light and freezing, and shaking. If stored in a glass front 
refrigerator, vials should be stored in the carton. Recommended safety measures for 
preparation and handling of nivolumab include laboratory coats and gloves.  
 
For details on prepared drug storage and use time of nivolumab under room 
temperature/light and refrigeration, please refer to the BMS -936558 (nivolumab)  
Investigator Brochure.  
 
Care must be taken to assure sterility of the prepared solution as the product does not 
contain any anti- microbial preservative or bacteriostatic agent. No incompatibilities  between 
nivolumab and polyolefin bags have been observed.  
 
Nivolumab is to be administered approximately as a 30 -minute IV infusion with a 0.2- 1.2 
micron in -line filter at the protocol -specified dose when administered as a single agent. It is 
administered  for 60 minutes  when  given with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755835].  The drug can be diluted 
with 0.9%  normal saline or 5% dextrose injection for delivery  but the total  drug concentration 
of the solution cannot be below 0.35 mg/ml. It is not to be administered as an IV push or 
bolus  injection. At the end of the infusion, flush the line with a sufficient quantity of normal 
saline. For further details, please refer to the current BMS -936558 (nivolumab)  Investigator 
Brochure.  
 
6.4.2 Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755836] a 
PVC (polyvinyl  chloride),  non-PVC/non -DEHP  (di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate)  or glass  containers 
and is stable for 24 hours at 2 -8ºC or room temperature/room light ( RT/RL).  For ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755837], refer  to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755838]/or  pharmacy reference sheets.  
 
Recommended safety measures for preparation and handling include protective clothing, 
gloves, and safety cabinets.  
 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755839] a 90 -minute IV infusion, using a 
volumetric  pump  with a 0.2 to 1.2 micron  in-line filter at the protocol -specified dose.  The drug 
can be diluted  with 0.9%  normal  saline  or 5% Dextrose Injection to concentrations  between 
1 mg/mL  and 4 mg/mL. It is not to be administered  as an IV push  or bolus injection. 
Care  must be taken to assure sterility  of the prepared solutions, since the drug product does 
not contain any antimicrobial preservatives or bacteriostatic agents. At the end of the 
infusion, flush the line with a sufficient quantity of normal saline or 5%  dextrose sol ution. 
Please also refer to the current  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755840].  
 
When both study drugs  are to be administered on the same day, separate infusion bags 
and filters must be used for each infusion. Nivolumab is to be administered first. The 
nivolumab infusion must  be promptly followed  by a  saline  flush  to clear  the line of 
nivolumab before starting the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_182].  
[ADDRESS_1034635]  will not be administered and BMS  will be contact[CONTACT_15608].  If the 
study  drug(s)  are to be destroyed on site, it is the investigator’s  responsibility  to ensure 
that arrangements have been made for disposal, and that procedures for proper  disposal 
have been established according to applicable regulations, guidelines, and institutional 
procedures.  
 
6.4.3 Relatlimab  (BMS -986016)  
 
Relatlimab should be stored at 2°C to 8°C (36oF to 46oF) with protection from light. Do not 
freeze the drug product.  
 
Relatlimab is to be administered as a 60 minute IV infusion through a 0.2/1.2- µm pore size, 
low-protein- binding polyethersulfone membrane in -line filter at the protocol -specified doses. 
When  dosing sequentially  with nivolumab,  relatlimab  should begin  within  15-30 minutes  after 
the end of the nivolumab infusion.  Relatlimab  injection  and nivolumab injection can be diluted 
with 0.9% sodium chloride injection (normal saline), to protein concentrations no lower than  
1.33 mg/mL.  Detailed  instructions  for drug product  dilution  and administration are provided in 
the pharmacy manual for the clinical study.  
 
Care  must  be taken to assure sterility  of the prepared solution,  as the products  do not contain 
any anti -microbial preservative or bacteriostatic agent. No incompatibilities between the co- 
administered drug products and polyolefin or PVC bags, or non -DEHP or PVC infusion sets 
have been observed.  
 
The administration of relatlimab and nivolumab must be completed within 24 hours of 
preparation. If not used immediately, the infusion solution may be stored in a refrigerator at 
2°C to 8°C  (36oF to 46oF) for up to 24 hours and a maximum of 8 hours of the total 24 hours

For Arms A and B prior to Amendment 7, a total of 40 patients were expected to be 
randomized 1:1 on two different  treatment  arms.  After  approval  of Amendment  7, Arms  A and 
B will be closed and Arm C will be added.  A total of 30 patients  will be treated with nivolumab 
and relatlimab without randomization. There will be two different phases of drug 
administration.  
 
1) Neoadjuvant  phase:  
 
• Arm A: nivolumab 3 mg/kg  IV every  2 weeks  (+/-7 days)  on weeks  1, 3, 5 and 7 
 
• Arm B: nivolumab  1 mg/kg IV combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  3 mg/kg IV every  3 
weeks (+/ -7 days) on weeks 1, 4 and 7.  
35  • Arm C: nivolumab 480 mg IV combined with relatlimab 160 mg IV every 28 days 
(±7 days) beginning on week 1 for 2 doses (Week 1 and Week 5) 
 
2) Adjuvant  phase:  
 
• Patients  in treatment  arms A and B  will receive  nivolumab 3mg/kg  IV every  2 
weeks (±7 days) for a total of 24 weeks (13 doses)  
 
• Patients in Arm  C will receive nivolumab 480 mg  IV combined with relatlimab 160 
mg IV every 28 (+/ -7 days) days for a total of [ADDRESS_1034640]’s weight on the day of dosing differs  by > 10% from the weight  used 
to calculate the original dose, the dose must be recalculated using the patient’s new actual 
body weight. All doses should be rounded to the nearest milligram. There will be no dose 
modifications  allowed.  Please refer to the current Investigator  Brochure  for additional 
details on administration.  
 
6.5.[ADDRESS_1034641] related dose delay.  
 
Study  drug administra tion should be interrupted  and increased  monitoring  of subjects  should 
ensue if any of the following drug related adverse event(s) occurs:  
 
• Grade  ≥1 myocarditis  
 
o All troponin elevations require a dose delay to allow for prompt cardiac 
evaluations. Following this evaluation, determination of further treatment 
will be based on the discussion with the sponsor or designee.  
 
• Grade  ≥2 non-skin, drug-related  adverse  events  with the following  exceptions:  
 
o Grade 2 drug -related fatigue or laboratory abnormalities do not require a 
treatment delay  
 
• Any Grade  3 skin, drug-related AE 
 
• Any Grade [ADDRESS_1034642], ALT,  or total bilirubin  that is  within  normal 
limits, delay dosing for drug- related Grade ≥[ADDRESS_1034643], ALT, or total bilirubin within the Grade 1 
toxicity range, delay dosing for drug- related Grade ≥3 toxicity  
 
•  Any adverse event, laboratory abnormalities, or intercurrent illness which in the 
judgment of the investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medication.  
 
If dose delay  is necessary, nivolumab (Arm A) or both nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 
(Arm B) must be delayed until treatment can resume.  
 
See current Inv estigator Brochure and Appendix 4  - Appendix 10 for citation 
examples.  
 
Dose delay criteria apply for all drug -related adverse events (regardless of 
whether or not the event is attributed to s tudy drug). All study drugs must be 
delayed until treatment can resume.  
 
Subjects may resume treatment with study drug when the drug- related AE(s) 
resolve to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline value, with the following exceptions:  
 
o Subjects  may resume  treatment  in the presence of Grade [ADDRESS_1034644]/ALT or total bilirubin who require 
dose delays for reasons other than a 2- grade shift in AST/ALT or total 
bilirubin  may resume treatment in the presence of Grade [ADDRESS_1034645]/ALT OR 
total bilirubin  
 
o Subjects with combined Grade [ADDRESS_1034646]/ALT AND total bilirubin values 
meeting discontinuation parameters should have treatment permanently 
discontinued  
 
o Drug -related pulmonary AEs, diarrhea, or colitis, must have resolved to 
baseline before treatment is resumed  
 
o Drug -related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with physiologic 
hormone replacement may resume treatment  
 
o  In the neoadjuvant phase of therap y, if a treatment delay of more than 
three  weeks  is required, the next dose(s) can be omitted for patient safety 
and patient can stay on protocol as long as the patient is deemed to be 
responding clinically and will be able to proceed  with surgery  as planned.  
 
o If a subject in Arm B experiences a severe adverse event during neoadjuvant combination therapy that subsequently becomes well 
managed (grade 1), initiating treatment with nivolumab in the adjuvant 
setting  may be considered if the patient is deemed fit to initiate adjuvant  
37  therapy within the appropriate treatment window (within 4- 6 weeks of 
discharge from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_755841]). 
 
o In the adjuvant phase of therapy: if the criteria to resume treatment are 
met, the subject  should  restart  treatment  at the next scheduled  time- 
point  per protocol.  
 
However,  if the treatment  is delayed past the next scheduled time-point  per 
protocol, the next scheduled time -point will be delayed until dosing 
resumes. If treatment is delayed > [ADDRESS_1034647] be 
permanently  discontinued from study therapy, except as specified below  
 
6.5.3 Study- Drug  Discontinuation  Criteria  
 
Treatment  should be permanently  discontinued for the following:  
 
• Grade  3 troponin  not associated with any other  sign of cardiac  toxicity  (as determined 
by a cardiac evaluation)  
 
• Any Grade 3 non- skin, drug- related adverse event lasting > 7 days in the 
neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings, including uveitis, pneumonitis,  colitis, and 
neurologic  adverse  events.  
 
• Grade 3 drug- related laboratory abnormalities do not require treatment 
discontinuation except those noted below:  
 
o Grade 3 drug- related thrombocytopenia > [ADDRESS_1034648] (LFT) abnormality that  meets  the 
following criteria require discontinuation:  
 
 AST or ALT > [ADDRESS_1034649] 
 
 Total  bilirubin  > [ADDRESS_1034650] 
 
 Concurrent  AST or ALT >  [ADDRESS_1034651] and total bilirubin  > [ADDRESS_1034652] 
 
• Grade  3 myocarditis  
 
• Any Grade 4 drug -related adverse event or laboratory abnormality, except for the 
following events which do not require discontinuation: 
 
o Isolated Grade 4  amylase or lipase  abnormalities that are not associated  with 
symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis and decrease to < Grade 
4 within 1 week of onset.  
 
o  Isolated  Grade  4 electrolyte imbalances/abnormalities that are  not associated 
with clinical sequelae and are corrected with supplementation/appropriate management within 72 hours of their onset 
38  • Any dosing delay  of more than 2 weeks in the neoadjuvant phase of treatment and > 
6 weeks in the adjuvant phase of treatment with the following exceptions:  
 
o  Dosing interruptions to allow for prolonged steroid tapers to manage drug- 
related  adverse events  are allowed. Prior  to re-initiating  treatment in  a subject 
with a dosing interruption lasting > [ADDRESS_1034653] be 
consulted.  Tumor  assessments  should continue as per protocol  even if dosing 
is interrupted  
 
o  Dosing interruptions > [ADDRESS_1034654] with a dosing interruption lasting > [ADDRESS_1034655] be consulted.  Tumor  assessments  should continue as per protocol  even  if dosing 
is interrupted  
 
• Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the 
judgment of the Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the subject with 
continued nivolumab dosing.  
 
6.5.[ADDRESS_1034656] with fever, chills, 
rigors, headache, rash, pruritus, arthralgias, hypo- or hypertension,  bronchospasm, or other 
symptoms. All Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions  should be reported as an SAE if criteria 
are met. Infusion reactions should be graded according to NCI CTCAE (version 4.0) guidelines.  
 
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified based on local treatment standards and guidelines as appropriate:  
 
For Grade  1 symptoms : (Mild  reaction;  infusion  interruption not indicated; intervention 
not indicated) Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms.  The 
following prophylactic pre- medications are recommended for future infusions: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen) at least 30 minutes before additional nivolumab administrations.  
 
For Grade 2 symptoms: (Moderate reaction requires therapy or infusion interruption but 
responds promptly to symptomatic treatment [e.g., antihistamines, non- steroidal anti - 
inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophylactic 
medications  indicated for  less than 24 hours).  Stop the nivolumab  or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755842], begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the subject with diphenhydramine  50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg 
(acetaminophen); remain at bedside and monitor subject until resolution of symptoms. Corticosteroid or bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appropriate. If the 
infusion is interrupted, then restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate when 
symptoms reso lve; if no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be 
increased to 100% of the original infusion rate. Monitor subject closely. If symptoms recur 
then no further nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755843]. 
Administer  diphenhydramine [ADDRESS_1034657]  
39  until resolution of symptoms. The following prophylactic pre -medications are recommended 
for future infusions: diphenhydramine  50 mg (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 
mg (acetaminophen) should be administered  at least  30 minutes  before  additional 
nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_641506]. If necessary, corticosteroids (recommended dose: 
up to 25 mg of IV hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used. 
 
6.[ADDRESS_1034658]’s last  dose, a physical exam  will be done.  Six 
tablespoons of blood will be drawn for routine tests and to test the immune system; a CT 
scan, PET -CT scan, and/or MRI will be done to check the status of the disease. 
 
A subject will be  considered to have completed  the study  if the  subject i s no longer  receiving 
clinical benefit (i.e., has progressive disease per RECIST, has died, has shown unacceptable toxicity, or study completion criteria have been met). A subject will be 
considered to have withdrawn from the study if the subject, in the absence of disease 
progression or death, is lost to follow -up, has withdrawn consent, or is withdrawn at the 
investigator’s discretion. Patients  enrolled will have  completed the study  after being followed 
for a minimum of two years after the time  of surgica l resection.  Subjects  who are ongoing  at 
the time the study is closed/terminated will be considered to have completed the study.  
 
6.6.2 Permanent  Discontinuation  from  Study Treatment  
 
During  the protocol  defined treatment  period  study  treatment(s)  may be permanently 
discontinued for the following reasons:  
 
• Death 
 
• Unacceptable adverse  event  
 
• Deviation(s)  from the protocol  
 
• Request  of the subject  or proxy  
 
• Investigator’s  Discretion  
 
• Subject  is lost to follow- up 
 
• Study  is closed or terminated 
 
The primary  reason  each study  treatment  was permanently  discontinued must  be 
documented in the subject’s medical records. 
[ADDRESS_1034659]  voluntarily  discontinues  from treatment  due to toxicity,  ‘adverse event’  will 
be recorded as the primary reason for permanently discontinuation in the medical record.  
 
All subjects  who permanently  discontinue from study treatment  will have assessments at 
the time of discontinuation and during post study treatment follow - up as specified in Time 
and Events Tables. In addition, all subjects who permanently discontinue study treatment 
without evidence of disease recurrence will also be followed for disease recurrence according to the protocol  schedule until:  
 
• Withdrawal  of consent  
 
• Death,  or 
 
• Study  completion (as defined in Section 7.5.1 ) 
 
Subjects that permanently discontinue from study treatment before the end of the  treatment 
period without evidence of disease recurrence will return for disease assessment visits 
starting at the next regularly scheduled disease assessment visit (i.e. every  12 weeks for 
restaging scans). If a subject experiences disease recurrence  at any time,  subsequent 
follow up should  be conducted  every  three  months in person,  by [CONTACT_755884].  
 
Follow -up for survival,  new anti-cancer  therapy  (including radiotherapy)  and response to new 
anti-cancer therapy will continue for all subjects including those with disease recurrence for 
[ADDRESS_1034660]  to assess survival  and new anti- cancer therapy 
may be made  via clinic  visit or another  form of communication (e.g. phone, email, mail 
etc.).  
 
6.7 Prohibited Medications  and Non-Drug  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_755844] 28 days or 5 half -lives, whichever is shorter, prior to 
randomization and for the duration of the study will not be allowed.  
 
The following medications or non- drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_755845]: 
 
• Other  anti-cancer  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014];  
 
• Other  investigational  drugs;

48  7.4 Biospecimen Collections  
For blood  and tissue correlative studies,  specimens  will be collected  as part of the protocol  as 
specified in the Study Procedure Tables (Section 7.1) and stored for later analysis.  
 
Samples  will be stored with the coded  identification  number  or by [CONTACT_755887].  All 
samples  and clinical data will be tracked  by [CONTACT_15276] a unique research  tracking number  that 
will not be related to any patient identifying information.  The link between research tracking 
numbers and patient identifiers will be kept in a secure application. More than one sample 
(each sample with a unique research tracking number)  may be associated with a single  medical 
record number  in the database.  Assays  will be performed in research laboratories at MD Anderson,  
M.D. Anderson Immune Monitoring Core Facility and sub -investigating sites. Tumor tissue 
obtained for this protocol may be sent to the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy for 
research analysis. Results of all assays and other collected data will be maintained in the 
secure research application. 
 
Tissue will be procured  from blood and tumor  biopsies.  
 
7.4.1 Peripheral  Blood and Serum  Samples  
 
Blood processing for PBMC,  plasma and storage:  30ml  of venous  peripheral blood will 
be collected in sodium  heparin vacutainers,  at the time points  as described in Section 7. [ADDRESS_1034675] biopsies performed safely on accessible tumors before starting 
treatment  (unless  biopsy  is not safe and tissue  blocks  are available for analysis). 
These biopsy samples should be excisional, incisional or core needle. Fine needle 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_755846]. The pre- treatment tumor biopsy must contain sufficient tumo r content  (≥100 
tumor cells/4 -micron tissue section) for PD -L1 immunohistochemistry testing prior to 
randomization in Arm A  and B. Additional biopsies will be performed around  dose  2 (+/- 
7 days) for patients in Arms A and B. When medically safe and feasible, additional 
biopsies  will be obtained around dose  3 (+/ - 7 days)  for Arms A and B.  In addition, 
local surgery of isolated symptomatic lesions and biopsy prior to re- treatment in the 
setting of interrupted active treatment is strongly encouraged, if deem ed clinically safe. 
For Arm C, tumor  biopsy  will be performed at baseline,  day 14 (+/- 7 days)  and day 28 (+/- 
[ADDRESS_1034676] a tumor biopsy performed.  Available 
paraffin embedded tumor tissue or excision may also be collected as pre -treatment 
comparator  samples,  so long as the patient provides consent for use in this study. 
Preferred archival material includes tissue obtained in the same manner as specified in 
this trial and with no systemic  anti-tumor  treatment  received by [CONTACT_755888] 
49  biopsy and their enrollment  on this protocol.  However, other  archival  tissue  may also be 
collected.  
 
In order to accommodate all downstream biomarker analyses,  incisional/excisional biopsies 
are strongly encouraged for this study, however, if incisional/excisional biopsies are not 
possible, core needle biopsies are acceptable  as an alternative. Collection of a minimum of  
[ADDRESS_1034677]  10 mm  in length  using a needle g auge of 18 or larger  will 
be used when feasible for all on treatment biopsies to accommodate PD -L1 staining and 
correlative research as indicated in the protocol.  
 
For tissue obtained from MD Anderson participants,  each set of core biopsies  (up to four) or  
surgical specimen may be divided into portions and processed as below for later analysis. 
Specific instructions for processing may be provided in the event that four cores cannot be 
obtained.  
 
1. FFPE  for histology  and IHC (25%  of the specimen.)

Tumor  specimens  of patients  undergoing evaluation for pathologic  complete response  (pCR), 
and pathologic partial response (pPR). pCR is defined as the absence of any residual 
invasive malignant  cells on hematoxylin and eosin  evaluation  of the resected  melanoma  
50  specimen. pPR is defined as less than 50%  viable  tumor  cells or more  than 50% fibrosis  on 
pathological evaluation. 
 
7.5.2 Imaging Assessments 
 
Disease assessment will include imaging (computed tomography, magnetic resonance 
imaging) and physical examination (as indicated for palpable/superficial lesions). At 
screening,  an MRI or  CT of the head  with contrast  is required.  At minimum,  PET/CT  or 
CT o f the chest, abdomen and pelvis are required but additional imaging of affected areas 
(neck or extremities) may be required for documentation of target lesions.  
 
Disease assessment will be completed within [ADDRESS_1034679] dose of  study  drug, 
then as indicated in the Study Procedure Tables (Section 7.1). More frequent  disease 
assessments may be performed at the discretion of the investigator.  To ensure 
comparability  between  baseline  and subsequent assessments, the same method of 
assessment and the same technique will be used when assessing response.  
 
Disease response will be recorded as complete response (CR), partial response (PR),  
stable disease (SD),  or progressive  disease (PD) according to RECIST  1.1 criteria  (Appendix  
2). 
 
7.5.3 Translational  Research/Biomarker  Analysis  
 
Serum  samples  may be assessed by [CONTACT_755889],  seromics or other  multiplex - 
based assay  methods to measure soluble factors. Such factors likely will include, IFN -Ɣ and 
interferon inducible  factors, including CXCL9  and CXCL10,  however,  numerous  serum -based 
biomarkers are currently under investigation for their potential to associate with efficacy to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], nivolumab or other immunotherapy agents. These biomarkers include levels of 
soluble PD-L1, PD-1, anti-tumor  antibodies,  microRNAs  (such a s, but not limited  to, miR- 513, 
and miR19b), IL- 12, TNFα,  IL-10, TGF- β, VEGF, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, IL -18, C -reactive protein  
and, as well as many other cytokines, chemokines, inflammatory factors and immune 
mediators. Such factors  may be assessed in the context of  the current  study. Blood may also 
be collected at clinically relevant time points such as the occurrence of a ≥Grade 3 drug- related AEs.  
 
PBMC samples may  be used for immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_755847], including, but not limited to, T cells, B cells, NK cells, or 
subpopulations of the aforementioned immune cell types. These samples may also be used 
to assess immune cell function or antigen specific T cell proliferation or activation pending emerging information from other nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755848] -studies.  
 
The MDACC Immunotherapy Platform (IMT) will perform immune monitoring of correlative samples  collected  at MD Anderson,  including but not limited  to evaluation of CD4  and CD8 T 
cells in peripheral blood (PBMCs) and available tumor samples as previously published. All samples  that are provided  to the IMT platform  will be collected and analyzed as per a separate 
IRB-approved lab protocol.  
 
Pre-treatment  tumor  tissue  specimens  in the form of a paraffin embedded  block  or a minimum 
of 3unstained slides, with a single section on positively charged slides will be submitted for 
PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) assessment.  
51  Tumor samples may be assessed for the expression of other immune or melanoma related 
genes,  RNAs  and/or  proteins,  as well as, the presence  of immune  cell populations  using 
a variety  of methodologies  inclusive  of, but not limited  to immunohistochemistry (IHC), 
qRT-PCR, genetic mutation detection and fluorescent in -situ hybridization (FISH). Various 
molecular markers with potential predictive value for the treatment of melanoma with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_411302], and  other immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_755849].  These  tumor  tissue biomarkers  include,  but are not 
limited to PD- 1, PD -L2, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) or subpopulations  of TILs and a 
Th1 immune mRNA expression signature.  
 
Pending tissue availability  other  detailed analyses  may include:  
 
a) Assess changes in the extent of T cell infiltrate over time. FFPE tumor 
specimens will be stained for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, FoxP3 using commercial antibodies.  Staining frequency  for each  antibody  will be quantified 
and ratio of various T cell components (CD 4/CD8, Treg/CD8 etc) will be 
calculated over time.  
 
b) Assess activation status of infiltrating T cells: Studies will include IHC and  
multiparameter flow cytometry:  
 
c) IHC: In  the TIL infiltrate, cells staining for Ki67,  granzyme  B, IFN -γ, TGF-beta, 
GATA- 3, RORgt,  BCL2  will be enumerated  to estimate  T cell activation, 
and Th1/Th2/Th17 bias.  
 
d) Flow cytometry:  TIL isolated from serial tumor specimens will be assessed 
for expression of immunoregulatory and  co-stimulatory  markers  PD1, 
CTLA4, LAG3, 41BB using available antibodies, and TCR zeta chain 
expression  using flow. Baseline status and PBMC will serve as controls  
 
e) Assess via Nanostring for conversion to immune/inflammatory expression  
pattern  
 
f) RNA will be extracted from tumor tissue and analyzed for the presence or absence of an immune gene expression signature [CONTACT_755906].  Specimens will be run in duplicate. Previous positive and negative 
expressing tumors will be used as controls.  
 
g) Obtain pi[INVESTIGATOR_755850] 8 tumor measurements and PFS. 
 
h)  Patients will undergo tumor measurements pre -treatment and [ADDRESS_1034680] 1.1. Percent tumor shrinkage relative  to baseline will be analyzed.  Extent  of tumor  shrinkage 
and individual  patient  PFS will be examined  for association with measures 
of immune infiltration at various time points.  
52  8 Safety  and Reporting  
The investigator and site staff will be responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting 
events  that meet  the definition  of an adverse  event  (AE) or serious  adverse event  (SAE) 
as documented in Sections  8. [ADDRESS_1034681] (MDACC DSMB) can be removed as the monitor.  
 
Serious  Adverse  Event  Reporting  (SAE)  for M. D. Anderson -sponsored Multicenter  IND 
Protocols 
 
An adverse event  or suspected adverse  reaction is considered “serious”  if, in the view of either 
the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death 
 
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience –  any adverse experience that places the 
patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse 
experience as it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10909]  
 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
 
• A congenital  anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples  of such  medical  events  include allergic  bronchospasm  requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 
312.32).  
 
• Important  medical  events as defined above,  may also be considered  serious adverse 
events.  Any important  medical  event  can and should be reported  as an SAE if deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_9476], MDACC IND Office.  
 
• All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the de finition of a 
SAE must be reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and procedures 
outlined in “University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review 
Board Policy for Investigators on Reporting Unanticipated Adverse Events for D rugs 
and Devices”.  
 
Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expected or unexpected, must be reported to the IND Office, regardless of attribution (within 5 working days of 
knowledge of the event).  
53  Reporting  for all sites:  
 
• A written  report  should  be submitted  to the Institutional  Review Board (IRB)  according 
to the requirements of the assigned IRB for patients enrolled at each site. (The MD 
Anderson site will utilize the electronic SAE application (eSAE) for reporting SAEs.) 
 
• SAEs will be re ported to the sponsor on a  template form that will be provided to each 
site. If needed,  a copy  of all relevant  examinations  that have been carried out and the 
dates  on which  these examinations  were  performed  should  be attached.  For laboratory 
results, normal ranges should be included. Patient name [CONTACT_147893]. 
 
• In case of a serious adverse event, the following actions must be undertaken by [CONTACT_1275]:  (Please  note that these  are in addition to reporting that is required by [CONTACT_147857].)  Complete  the SAE form immediately  and then fax 
and overnight  mail the signed and dated  SAE form to the sponsor  representative within 
two working days to the following address:

• A copy  of the tracking receipt  should be kept and filed in the study  regulatory  binder  at 
the site. The research team may e- mail or call the sponsor to confirm receipt of the 
SAE fax or mailed form.  
 
• Death or life-threatening events that are possibly, probably or definitely  related  
to drug must be reported within [ADDRESS_1034682] be notified by [CONTACT_755890], in addition to fax or overnight mail as listed above.  
 
• All life -threatening or fatal events, expected or unexpected, and regardless of 
attribution to the study drug, must have a written report submitted within 24 hours 
(next  working  day) of knowledge of the event  to the Safety  Project  Manager  in the IND 
Office.  
 
• Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the first protocol - 
specific  intervention,  unless the protocol  states  otherwise,  and be reported  until 
[ADDRESS_1034683] returned to 
baseline, progression  of the event has stabilized, or there has been  acceptable 
resolution of the event.  
54  • Additionally,  any serious adverse events that occur  after  the [ADDRESS_1034684] be reported to the IND Office. This 
may include the development of a secondary malignancy.  
 
• All events reported the supporting company must also be report to the IND 
Office.  
 
Reporting  to FDA:  
 
• Serious adverse events  will be forwarded to FDA  by [CONTACT_9533] (Safety  Project 
Manager IND Office) according to 21 CFR 312.32.  
 
It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_755851],  Good Clinical  Practices,  the 
protocol guidelines, the sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional Review Board policy.  
 
Investigator  Communication  with Supporting  Companies:  
 
8.1 Sponsor  SAE Reporting  
• All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that occur following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study through [ADDRESS_1034685] be 
reported to BMS Worldwide Safety.  
 
•  If the BMS safety  address  is not included in the protocol  document  (e.g. 
multicenter studies where events are reported centrally), the procedure for safety reporting must  be reviewed/approved  by [CONTACT_755891].  Procedures 
for such  reporting must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_755892].  
 
• The BMS SAE form should be used to report SAEs.  If the BMS form  cannot be 
used, another acceptable form (i.e CIOMS or Medwatch) must be reviewed and 
approved by  [CONTACT_20444]. The BMS protocol ID number must be  included on whatever  form 
is submitted by [CONTACT_1034]/Investigator.  
 
•  Following  the subject’s  written  consent  to participate  in the study,  all SAEs, 
whether related or not related to study  drug, are collected, including those thought to 
be associated with  protocol -specified procedures.  The investigator  should report 
any SAE occurring after these time periods that is believed to be related to study 
drug or protocol -specified procedure.  
 
•  In accordance  with local regulations,  BMS will notify  investigators  of all reported  SAEs 
that are suspected (related to the investigational product) and unexpected (i.e., not 
previously  described  in the IB). In the European Union  (EU),  an event  meeting 
these criteria is termed a Suspected, Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction 
(S[LOCATION_003]R).  Investigator notification of these events will be in the form of an expedited 
safety report (ESR).  
 
o Other important findings which may  be reported by  [CONTACT_114646]: 
increased  frequency of  a clinically significant  expected SAE,  an SAE 
considered associated with study procedures that could modify the conduct of 
the study,  lack of  efficacy  that poses  significant  hazard  to study  subjects,  
55  clinically significant safety finding from a nonclinical (e.g., animal) study, 
impor tant safety  recommendations  from a study  data monitoring committee,  or 
sponsor decision to end or temporarily  halt a clinical study  for safety  reasons.  
 
o  Upon receiving an ESR from BMS, the investigator must review and retain  
the ESR with the IB. Where required by [CONTACT_34342] a 
central IRB/IEC for the study, the sponsor will submit the ESR to the 
appropriate IRB/IEC. The investigator and IRB/IEC will determine if the 
informed  consent requires  revision.  The investigator  should also comply 
with the IRB/IEC procedures for reporting any other safety information.  
 
o  In addition, suspected serious adverse reactions (whether expected or 
unexpected) shall be reported by [CONTACT_755893]  (either 
as expedited and/or in aggregate reports).  
 
Serious Adverse Event  Collection and Reporting 
 
Following  the subject’s  written  consent  to participate  in the study,  all SAEs,  whether 
related or not related to study drug, must be collected, including those thought to be 
associated  with protocol -specified procedures.  All SAEs  must  be collected  that occur 
within [ADDRESS_1034686] 
be collected that relate to any protocol -specified procedure (e.g., a follow -up skin biopsy). 
The investigator should report any SAE that occurs after these time periods that is believed 
to be related to study drug or protocol -specified procedure.  
 
SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnancies must be reported to 
BMS within [ADDRESS_1034687] be  recorded on BMS or an  approved form; pregnancies  on 
a Pregnancy Surveillance Form.  
 
SAE Email  Address:  [EMAIL_176]  
 
SAE Facsimile Number:  [PHONE_188] 
 
If only limited information is initially available, follow- up reports are required. (Note:  Follow - 
up SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.)  
 
If an ongoing  SAE changes in  its intensity  or relationship  to study  drug or if new 
information becomes available, a follow- up SAE report should be  sent within 24 hours to the 
BMS (or designee)  using the same procedure  used  for transmitting the initial SAE report.  
 
All SAEs  should be followed  to resolution or stabilization.  
 
For studies  conducted under  an Investigator  IND in the US include the following:  
 
For studies conducted under an Investigator IND in the US, any event that is both serious 
and unexpected must be reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as soon as 
possible and no later than 7 days  (for a death  or life-threatening  event)  or 15 days (for all 
56  other  SAEs)  after the investigator’s  or institution’s  initial receipt  of the information.  BMS will be 
provided with a simultaneous copy of all adverse events filed with the FDA.  
 
SAEs  should be reported on MedWatch  Form  3500A,  which  can be accessed at:

• An SAE report  should  be completed  for any event  where  doubt  exists regarding 
its seriousness.  
 
• For studies  with long-term follow- up periods  in which  safety  data are being 
reported, include the timing of SAE collection in the protocol. 
 
• If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potential ly 
related to the conditions  of the study  (such as withdrawal  of previous  therapy  or 
a complication of a study procedure), the relationship should be specified in the 
narrative section of the SAE Report Form.  
 
• If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: 
Follow -up SAE reports  should include the same  investigator  term(s)  initially  reported.)  
 
•  If an ongoing  SAE changes in  its intensity  or relationship to study  drug or if 
new information becomes available, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24 
hours  to BMS using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report. 
All SAEs  should be followed  to resolution or stabilization.  All SAEs  should be followed 
to resolution or stabilization.  
 
8.2 Non-Serious  Adverse Event  Collection and Reporting  
The collection of non-serious  AE information  should begin  at initiation  of study drug.  All 
non-serious  adverse events  (not only those deemed to be treatment -related)  should 
be collected  continuously  during the treatment  period and for a minimum  of [ADDRESS_1034689] results that constitute SAEs should be documented and 
reported as such.  
 
The following  laboratory  abnormalities  should be documented  and reported  appropriately:  
 
• any laboratory  test result  that is clinically  significant  or meets  the definition  of an SAE 
 
•  any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to have study drug discontinued 
or interrupted  
 
• any laboratory  abnormality  that required  the subject  to receive  specific 
corrective therapy.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_1034690] will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (e.g.,  dose tapering if 
necessary for subject safety).  
 
The investigator must immediately notify Worldwide Safety @BMS of this event via the 
Pregnancy Surveillance Form in ac cordance with SAE reporting procedures.  
 
Follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and 
neonatal outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be reported on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form [provided upon request from BMS]  
 
Any pregnancy  that occu rs in a female  partner  of a male  study  participant  should be reported 
to BMS. Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance 
Form.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_1034691] 
be reported as an SAE.  
 
8.6 Other  Safety Considerations  
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, 
electrocardiogr ams,  x-rays,  and any other  potential  safety  assessments,  whether  or not these 
procedures are required  by [CONTACT_760], should also be recorded as a nonserious or serious 
AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly.  
58  9 Statistical Considerations  
9.1 Sample Size and Power  
Arm A  and Arm B 
 
Patients  with, stage  IIIB/IIIC  or stage  IV resectable,  oligometastatic  melanoma  will be enrolled 
in this phase 2 study.  Patients with prior adjuvant therapy including use of prior interferon 
alpha, pegylated interferon or vaccine will be eligible after a 28 day washout period.  This is 
an exploratory  biomarker study  and no statistical  comparisons will be made between the  two 
treatment arms.  The primary objective is to assess pathologic response of neoadjuvant 
nivolumab monotherapy  (Arm  A) and nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_755852]  (Arm  B). 
pCR is defined as the absence of any residual invasive malignant cells on hematoxylin and 
eosin evaluation of the resected melanoma  specimen.  pPR is defined as less than 50% viable 
tumor cells or more than 50% fibrosis on pathological evaluation.  
 
We assume  the pathologic  complete response rate will be 5% for patients  in Arm A  and 15% 
for Arm B.  These  data are extrapolated from the imaging CR rates  from previously  published  
data. 17, 18, 62, 63, 66 Thus, assuming the true pathologic complete response rate in Arm A is 
5%, the probability of at least [ADDRESS_1034692] 1 out of 20 patients experiencing a pathologic 
response is 0.96 assuming a true response rate of 15%. 
 
Arm C 
 
Thirty patients will be enrolled to Arm C.. The primary objective is to assess the pathologic response rate of neoadjuvant relatlimab with nivolumab. Pathologic complete response is 
defined as the absence of any residual invasive malignant cells on hematoxylin and eosin 
evaluation of the resected melanoma surgical specimen. Pathologic partial response is 
defined as less than 50% viable  tumor  cells or more  than 50% fibrosis  on pathologic  evaluation 
of the surgical  sample.  All tumor  samples  are evaluated by a single  dermatopathology  certified 
collaborator.  
 
We assume the pathologic  response rate will be 30% for patients  in Arm C. Assuming this true 
pathologic response rate, the probability of at least 5 out of 30 patients experiencing a response is 0.97.  
 
 
9.2 Study  Populations  
Intent -to-treat (ITT) population:  All patients randomized to Arm A  or B, and treated in Arm C 
in the study will be included in the analysis regardless of their adherence to entry criteria, 
treatment they actually received, compliance, and subsequent withdrawal from treatment or 
protocol deviation.  
 
9.2.[ADDRESS_1034693] four patients. Assuming a prior beta distribution of 
(0.4, 1.6), the treatment arm  will terminate if the Pr (δ dp > 0.20 |  data)  > 0.85,  where δ dp is 
the proportion of  patients experiencing disease progression within the treatment arm. 
Disease progression is defined as progression such that disease is no longer resectable 
based on week [ADDRESS_1034694] six patients.  Assuming a prior beta distribution of (1, 1), corresponding 
to a toxicity rate of 50%, the treatment arm will terminate if the Pr (δ
T > 0.50 | data) > 0.975, 
where δT is the proportion of patients  experiencing ≥ grade 3 toxicities. For futility, a prior beta 
distribution of (0.6, 1.4) will be assumed,  corresponding to a pRR of 30%.  Patient  enrollment 
will terminate if the Pr (δ pRR < 0.30 | data) > 0.975, where δ pRR is the pRR attributable to the 
treatment combination.  The decision rule for terminating for toxicity  is presented in Table 11 
while the decision rule for terminating for futility is presented in Table 12  and the operating 
characteristics for these rules are presented in Table 13. The method used to produce the 
decision rules and operating characteristics was designed by  [CONTACT_203320], Simon, and Estey72,73 as 
extended by [CONTACT_210872]74.

9.5 Primary Efficacy Measure  
The primary  efficacy measure  in this study  is pathologic  response.  The proportion of  patients 
experiencing pathologic  response  will be computed  with associated 95% CI for each  treatment 
arm. 
62  9.6 Secondary  Efficacy Measures  
9.6.1 Immunologic Response 
 
Immunologic response will be assessed by [CONTACT_116659] T cell infiltrate from baseline to each 
study  procedure  visit (approximately  9 weeks).  The change  in T cell infiltrate  will be assessed 
over time for each  treatment  arm using  a generalized linear  mixed  model with terms for 
visit, stage of disease, and PD -L1 tumor status.  
 
9.6.2 Objective  Response 
 
Objective response (i.e., CR, PR, SD, and PD) will be categorized based  on criteria  specified 
in Appendix 2.  The proportion of patients experiencing objective response will be computed 
with associated 95% CI for each treatment arm.  
 
9.6.3 Recurrence- Free  and Overall  Survival  
 
Recurrence -free survival (RFS) will be defined from time of surgical resection to the date of 
documented disease recurrence. Patients who are still alive without disease progression 
after 12 months  of treatment  start date will be censored.  Overall  survival (OS)  will be defined 
from treatment start date to date of death. Patients who are still alive after [ADDRESS_1034696]  deviation,  median,  minimum,  and maximum.  
63  10 Study Management  
10.1 Data Management  
10.1.1 Enrollment  
 
For the purposes of this study at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, the Protocol Data 
Management System (PDMS) will be employed.  All patients will be registered in the Clinical 
Oncology Research system (CORe) before any study specific tests are performed. 
Registration in CORe  will be  performed  by [CONTACT_755894]. 
 
10.1.2 Data  Entry  and Maintenance  
 
Data for this protocol will be entered into a secure electronic data capture (EDC), such as Prometheus.  All participating  sites will use this EDC.  The Parker  Institute  will also have  access 
to the study data for data analysis purposes.  
 
The investigator  is required to retain,  in a confidential  manner,  the data pertinent  to the study 
for the duration of the study or the maximum period required by [CONTACT_755895].  If the investigator withdraws from the study ( e.g., 
relocation, retirement), the records shall be transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee (e.g., another investigator or IRB).  
 
The concomitant medications will not be captured in the case report form (PDMS). They will 
be captured in the subject’s  medical records.  
 
Posting of Information on Clinicaltrials.gov  
 
Study  information from this protocol  will be posted  on clinicaltrials.gov  before 
enrollment of subjects begins.  
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_1034697]  maintain  all site study  records 
(except for those required by [CONTACT_1206]) in a safe and 
secure location. The records must be easily accessible when needed and must be available 
for review  in conjunction w ith assessment of the facility,  supporting systems, and relevant  site 
staff.

[ADDRESS_1034700]  1.1 Criteria  
 
Measurability of Tumor Lesions at Baseline  
Measurable lesion:  
 
• A non nodal  lesion  that can be accurately  measured in at least  one dimension (longest 
dimension) of  
 
o ≥[ADDRESS_1034701]  double the slice thickness  (e.g.,  if the slice thickness  is 
[ADDRESS_1034702] be ≥20 mm). 
 
o ≥10 mm caliper/ruler  measurement  by [CONTACT_755900].  
o ≥[ADDRESS_1034703]  x-ray. 
•  Additionally  lymph  nodes  can be considered  pathologically  enlarged and measurable 
if 
 
o ≥15mm in the short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_462] (slice thickness 
recommended to  be no more  than 5mm). At  baseline and follow- up, only  the 
short axis will be measured [Eisenhauer, 2009].  
 
Non-measurable lesion:  
 
• All other lesions  including lesions  too small to be considered measurable (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 mm and <15 mm short 
axis) as well as truly non- measurable lesions, which include: leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusions, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of the skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal 
organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_755901] [Eisenhauer, 2009].  
 
Measurable disease:  
 
• The presence of at least one measurable lesion. Palpable lesions that are not measurable by [CONTACT_755902].  
 
Non-Measurable only disease:  
 
• The presence of only non-measurable lesions . 
 
Specifications  by [CONTACT_45832]:  
 
• The same diagnostic  method,  including use of contrast  when applicable, 
must be used throughout the study to evaluate a lesion.  
72  • All measurements  should be taken and recorded  in millimeters  (mm),  using a ruler or 
calipers.  
 
• Ultrasound is not a suitable  modality  of disease assessment.  If new lesions  are 
identified by [CONTACT_2207], confirmation by [CONTACT_91068]. 
 
• Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) -PET is generally  not suitable for ongoing assessments  of 
disease. However  FDG -PET can  be useful  in confirming new sites of disease where 
a positive  FDG -PET scans correlates  with the new site of disease  present  on CT/MRI 
or when a baseline FDG -PET was  previously  negative for the site of the new lesion. 
FDG-PET may also be used in lieu of a standard bone scan providing coverage allows 
interrogation of all likely sites of bone disease and FDG -PET is performed at all 
assessments.  
 
• If PET/CT is performed then the CT component can only be used for standard 
response  assessments  if performed to diagnostic  quality,  which  includes  the required 
anatomical coverage and prescribed use of contrast. The method of assessment should be noted as CT on the CRF.  
 
Clinical Examination:  
 
• Clinically detected lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775] , including a ruler/calipers  to measure  the size of the lesion,  is required.  
 
CT and MRI: Contrast  enhanced  CT with 5mm contiguous  slices  is 
recommended. 
 
Minimum size of a measurable baseline lesion should be twice the slice thickness, 
with a minimum lesion size of [ADDRESS_1034704] by [CONTACT_91069]. 
Whenever possible the same scanner should be used. [Eisenhauer, 2009].  
 
X-ray: Should not be used for target lesion measurements owing to poor lesion 
definition. Lesions on chest X -ray may be considered  measurable if they  are clearly 
defined and surrounded  by [CONTACT_28638];  however  chest  CT is preferred over chest X- 
ray [Eisenhauer, 2009].  
 
Evaluation of target  lesions:  
 
• Definitions  for assessment  of response  for target  lesion(s)  are as follows:  
 
o Complete  Response  (CR): Disappearance  of all target  lesions.  Any 
pathological lymph nodes must be <10mm in the short axis.  
o Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
diameters  of target  lesions,  taking  as a reference,  the baseline sum of 
the diameters (e.g. percent change from baseline). 
o Stable Disease  (SD):  Neither  sufficient  shrinkage to qualify  for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease.  
73  o Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the smallest sum of diameters  recorded since the treatment  started (e.g. percent  change from 
nadir, where nadir is defined as the smallest sum of diameters recorded since treatment start). In addition, the sum must have an absolute increase from nadir of 5mm.  
o Not Applicable (NA):  No target  lesions  at baseline.  
o Not Evaluable (NE):  Cannot  be classified by [CONTACT_755903] s. 
 
• Note:  
 
o If lymph nodes are documented as target lesions the short axis is added 
into the sum of the diameters (e.g. sum of diameters is  the sum of the 
longest diameters for non- nodal lesions and the short axis for nodal 
lesions).  When  lymph  nodes  decrease  to non-pathological  size (short  axis 
<10mm)  they should still have a measurement  reported  in order  not to 
overstate progression.  
 
o If at a given assessment time point all target lesions identified at baseline 
are not assessed, sum of the diameters cannot be calculated for purposes 
of assessing CR, PR, or SD, or for use as the nadir  for future  assessments. 
However, the sum of the diameters of the assessed lesions and the percent  change from nadir should be calculated  to ensure  that progression 
has not been documented. If an assessment of PD cannot be made, the response assessment should be NE.  
 
o All lesions (nodal and non- nodal) should have their measurements 
recorded even  when very small  (e.g 2 mm).  If lesions  are present  but too 
small to measure,  5 mm should be recorded and should contribute  to the 
sum of the diameters,  unless  it is likely  that the lesion has disappeared in 
which case 0 mm should be reported.  
 
o If a lesion disappears and reappears at a subsequent time point it should continue to be measured. The response at the time when the lesion reappears will  depend upon the status  of the  other lesions.  For example, if 
the disease had reached a CR status  then PD would  be documented at the 
time of reappearance. However, if the  response status was PR or SD, the 
diameter of the reappearing lesion should be added to the remaining diameters and response determined based on percent change from baseline and percent change from nadir 
 
 
Evaluation of non-target  lesions:  
 
• Definitions  for assessment  of response  for non-target  lesions  are as follows:  
 
o Complete  Response (CR): The disappearance  of all non-target  lesions.  All 
lymph nodes identified as a site of disease at baseline must be non - 
pathological (e.g. <10 mm short axis).  
74  Note:  o Non-CR/Non -PD: The persistence of 1 or more non- target lesion(s) or 
lymph  nodes  identified  as a site of disease at baseline ≥ 10 mm short  axis. 
 
o Progressive Disease  (PD):  Unequivocal  progression of existing  non-target 
lesions.  
 
o Not Applicable (NA):  No non-target  lesions  at baseline.  
 
o Not Evaluable (NE):  Cannot  be classified  by [CONTACT_755904].  
 
• Note:  
 
o In the presence  of measurable disease,  progression on the basis  of solely 
non-target disease requires substantial worsening such that even in the 
presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has 
increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  
 
o  In the presence of non- measurable only disease consideration should be 
given to whether  or not the increase in overall  disease burden is comparable 
in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable disease.  
 
o Sites of non -target lesions, which are not assessed at a particular time point 
based on the assessment schedule, should be excluded from the response 
determination (e.g. non-target response does  not have to be "Not Evaluable").  
 
Confirmation  of Response:  
 
• To be assigned a status of PR or CR, a confirmatory  disease assessment should be 
performed  no less  than 4 weeks  (28 days) after the criteria  for response are  first met. 
 
Overall  Response Criteria:  
 
•  Table 7 presents the overall response at an individual time point for all possible 
combinations of tumor responses in target and non- target lesions with or without the 
appearance of new lesions for subjects with measurable disease at  baseline.  
 
Table  7 Evaluation  of Overall  Response  for Subjects  with Measurable Disease  at Baseline  
 
   
 

75  • Note:  
 
o Subjects  with a global  deterioration of health status  requiring  discontinuation of 
treatment  without  objective evidence of disease  progression at that time should 
be classified  as having "symptomatic  deterioration."  Objective  response status 
is determined  by [CONTACT_755905].  Every  effort  should be made  to 
document the objective progression even after discontinuation of t reatment.  
 
o In some circumstances, it may  be difficult to distinguish residual disease from 
normal tissue.  
 
When the evaluation of CR depends  on this determination,  it is recommended that the 
residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) to confirm the  CR.

OPTION  1: Any TWO  of the following  methods  
 
□ Hormonal  Methods  of Contraception  
□ IUD 
□ Vasectomy  
□ Tubal  Ligation  
□ A barrier  method  (Female of Male  condom  with spermicide,  cervical  cap with 
spermicide, or diaphragm with spermicide)  
 
OPTION 2: Male condom (with spermicide) and diaphragm 
OPTION  3: Male  condom  (with  spermicide)  and cervical cap 
UNACCEPTABLE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION:  
• Abstinence (including periodic  abstinence)  
• No method  
• Withdrawal  
• Rhythm  
• Vaginal  Sponge  
• Any barrier  method  without  spermicide 
• Spermicide  
• Progestin- Only Pi[INVESTIGATOR_755863], 
use of a male condom without spermicide in conjunction  with a hormonal method, IUD, or 
tubal ligation will be acceptable to fulfill this recommendation. Any barrier method  when  
used alone  (without  spermicide)  or the concomitant  use of a female a nd male condom, 
are not considered sufficient methods of contraception, as they carry a failure rate of > 1%.

 5 1.1 Background and Significance  
 
 
Glaucoma surgery is indicated when further intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction 
is needed despi[INVESTIGATOR_361644].   Trabeculectomy (or guarded filtration procedure) is the most 
frequently performed glaucoma operation.  Eyes with previous ocular surgery and certain secondary glaucomas, such as neovascular glaucoma and uveitic glaucoma, are at great risk of trabeculectomy failure.  Wound healing modulation 
with antifibrotic agents, like mitomycin C (MMC) and 5- fluorouracil (5 -FU), has 
been shown to increase the success of glaucoma filtering surgery in high risk eyes.
1-[ADDRESS_450483] been reported with tube 
shunts (or glaucoma drainage implants),
5-[ADDRESS_450484] been 
growing in popularity.14,15  In particular, the large surface of the Baerveldt 
glaucoma implant (Advance Medical Optics, Santa Ana, [LOCATION_004]) combined with its ea se of insertion in a single quadrant offers an advantage over other tube 
shunts.  Similar surgical results have been reported with tube shunts and trabeculectomy with MMC or 5- FU when studied separately in similar patient 
groups.
5-13,16- 24  A comparable rate of serious complications has also been 
reported for the Baeveldt implant and trabeculectomy with an antifibrotic agent in a retrospective study.
25 
 The Tube Versus Trabeculectomy (TVT) Study is a multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of tube shunt surgery using the Baerveldt implant and trabeculectomy with MMC in [ADDRESS_450485] were transient and self -limited.
28  
The incidence of postoperative complications was higher following trabeculectomy with MMC than tube shunt surgery.  However, severe complications resulting in reoperation and/or vision loss occurred with similar 
 6 frequency with both surgical procedures.  Vision loss occurred at a similar rate 
following tube shunt surgery and trabeculectomy with MMC.  Patients who experienced surgical complications had greater vision loss than patients without complications.  
 A randomized clinical trial by [CONTACT_361660] (New World Medical, Inc., Rancho Cucamonga, [LOCATION_004] ) and trabeculectomy  with and without and adjunctive antifibrotic agent 
in [ADDRESS_450486] not had previous ocular surgery.  Outcome discrimination between the two treatment groups will be made using typi[INVESTIGATOR_361645] (visual  acuity and visual field), IOP, need for 
supplemental medical therapy, surgical complications, and reoperation for glaucoma or complications.

 n. Functionally significant cataract.  
 o. Need for glaucoma surgery combined with other ocular procedures (i.e. cataract surgery, penetrating keratoplasty, or retinal surgery) or anticipated need for additional ocular surgery.  
  
2.3 Sample Size  Calculations  
 
 
Sample size calculations were determined based on projected rates of complications and surgical success in each treatment group.  The results are shown in Table 1.  Enrollment of 88 patients in each treatment group, or a total of 176 patients, is expected to generate statistically valid conclusions for the study.  An attrition rate of 6% per year is anticipated.  Therefore, enrollment in the study will be offered to a total of 242 patients, including 121 patients in each tr eatment 
group.  
  
2.4 Randomization 
 
 
Since the purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of two surgical procedures used in the management of glaucoma, a trabeculectomy with mitomycin C and Baerveldt glaucoma implant, randomization techniques  are 
used to assure an unbiased treatment assignment to patients.  
 Stratification:  Previous studies have suggested that younger patients and those of African American ethnicity are at greater risk of failure with standard filtering surgery.  It also seems  logical to assume  that a patient who has failed glaucoma filtering 
surgery in one eye would be at greater risk for surgical failure in the fellow eye.  Therefore, patients will be stratified based upon the following prognostic factors:  
 
1. A
ge (< 50 years or  > 50 years)  
 2. Ethnicity (African American or other)  
 
 13 3. Previous failed filtering surgery in the nonstudy eye (present or 
absent)  
 Randomization:  
 A procedure is used to randomly assign patients to treatment with either a Baerveldt glaucoma implant or trabeculectomy with mitom ycin C.  At each 
Clinical Center, half of the patients in each stratum will receive a Baerveldt glaucoma implant and half will receive a trabeculectomy with mitomycin C.  Randomization takes place at the time the patient is enrolled in the study.  
  
2.5 Maskin g 
 
 
Neither the investigator nor the patient is masked as to which treatment the patient receives.  
  
2.6 Failure Criteria  
 
 
Failure in the PTVT Study is defined by [CONTACT_12294]:  
 
• IOP > 21 mm Hg or not reduced by 20% below baseline on tw o 
consecutive foll ow-up visits after 3 months  
 
• IOP  < 5 mm Hg on two consecutive visits after 3 months  
 
• Additional glaucoma surgery  
 
• Loss of light perception vision  
 
Eyes that have not failed and are not on supplemental medical therapy are considered complete successes.  Eye s that have not failed but require 
supplemental medical therapy are defined as qualified successes.

 [ADDRESS_450489] vision.  Two different techniques are used to measure visual 
acuity, including Snellen and ETDRS visual acuity testing.  Refraction is performed prior to formal measurement of visual acuity by [CONTACT_361661] -up visits.  Snellen visual acuity is 
measured at the Qualifying Assessment and at every follow -up visit.  ETDRS 
visual acuity is tested at the Qualifying Assessment and at the 1 year, 3 year, and 5 year follow -up visi ts. 
 Subjective Refraction:  Subjective refraction must be performed at the Qualifying Assessment and at the annual follow -up visits in order to determine best -corrected visual acuity.  It is 
permissible to use a phoropter or trial frame to determine best -corrected Snellen 
visual acuity.  The left eye is occluded first.  An approximate beginning refraction may be determined by [CONTACT_180050], automated refraction, or a subjective refraction from a prior visit.  The sphere is refined first.  The cylinder is the n 
refined, first the axis followed by [CONTACT_361662].  Finally, the sphere is rechecked.  The right eye is then occluded, and the procedure is repeated for the left eye.  
 If the patient wears contact [CONTACT_180052], he or she is instructed not to wear the contact [CONTACT_361663].  Patients unwilling to discontinue contact [CONTACT_361664].  In the event that the patient either has no glasses or has forgotten the instructions and reported for the Qualifying Assessment wearing contact [CONTACT_13276], the contact [CONTACT_361665].  
 ETDRS Visual Acuity:  
 The logmar visual acuity testing for the PTV T Study has been adapted from the 
Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy (ETDRS).  The logmar visual acuity scale facilitates statistical analysis and simplifies quantification of acuity at various distances.  The right eye is tested with ETDRS logmar chart 1, then the left eye is tested with ETDRS logmar chart 2.  Each chart is hidden from view until the eye being examined is ready for testing.  ETDRS visual acuity is measured after standardized refraction only during the Qualifying Assessment and at the 1 year, 3 year, and 5 year follow -up examinations.  
 The room illumination should be at a level of 50 to 100 foot candles, and between 50 and 125 foot candles should illuminate the ETDRS visual acuity chart.  The distance from the patient’ s eye to the visua l acuity chart is exactly 4.[ADDRESS_450490] distance of 4.0 meters are tested at 1.0 meter.  Before testing at 1.0 meter, +0.[ADDRESS_450491] six lines at 1.0 meter, so the maximum score attainable at that distance is 30.  Correctly identified letters are circled on the ETDRS Visual Acuity Worksheet.  If the patient’s visual acui ty is so 
poor that  he or she cannot read the largest letter at 1.0 meter, assess his or her 
ability to count fingers.  After testing of the right eye is completed, chart 1 is replaced by [CONTACT_70963] 2 and the procedure is repeated for the left eye.  
 Each letter read correctly and  circled on the ETDRS Visual Acuity Worksheet is 
scored as one point.  The score for each line (which is zero if no letters were read correctly) and the total score is recorded after testing is completed.  If testing at 1.0 meter is not required (ie 20 or more letters were seen with testing at 4.0 meters), [ADDRESS_450492].  The total score, equaling the sum of the 4.0 meter and 1.0 meter scores, is recorded on the data form.  The ETDRS Visual Acuity Worksheet is for  clinic use only and 
should not be sent to the Statistical Coordinating Center.  
 Snellen Visual Acuity:  
 Snellen visual acuity may be measured using any standard visual acuity chart.  The same type of chart must be used throughout the dur ation of the study .  
Snellen visual acuity is measured during the Qualifying Assessment and at all follow- up visits.  Standardized refraction is performed prior to Snellen visual 
acuity testing at the Qualifying Assessment and annual follow -up examinations . 
 The patient is not allowed to lean forward or backward so that a constant testing distance is maintained.  After proper instruction and refraction, the left eye is occluded and testing is begun with the right eye.  Progressively smaller lines are presented to the patient  until he or she makes two or more errors in a line.  When 
a patient states he or she is unable to read a letter, he or she is encouraged to 
 [ADDRESS_450493] line in wh ich the patient misses one or fewer optotypes.  If the patient’s 
visual acuity is so poor that he or she cannot read the 20/400 line, assess his or her ability to count fingers.  After testing of the right eye is completed, the procedure is repeated for the left eye.  
 Testi ng for Finger Counting:  
 After proper instruction and refraction, the examiner’s hand is viewed at a distance of two feet from the patient’s eye.  The fellow eye is closed and completely occluded by [CONTACT_180055]’s or assistant’ s hand.  The 
exami ner presents a random number of fingers to the patient.  The patient is 
asked to indicate the number of fingers seen.  If the number of fingers shown are correctly identified on four or more of five presentations, vision is recorded as count fingers. If th e number of fingers presented cannot be identified on four or 
more of five presentations, test for hand motions.  
 Testing for Hand Motions:  
 In testing for hand motion, the examiner’s hand is viewed with all fingers extended and separated at a distance of two feet from the patient’s eye.  The 
fellow eye is closed and completely occluded by [CONTACT_180055]’s or assistant’s hand.  The patient’s glasses are not be worn.  The examiner’s hand is presented in a random order under three c onditions:  stationary, moving back 
and forth horizontally, and moving up and down vertically.  The speed of movement is approximately one complete cycle of movement (up and down or back and forth) per second.  The patient is instructed that the examiner’s  hand 
will be pres ented in one of these conditions.  He or she is asked to respond to 
the question, “what is my hand doing now?” with either, “still”, “back and forth”, or “up and down”.  The process is repeated five times.  It is considered a correct response if the patient states the hand is still or he or she cannot see it while it is 
stationary, and he or she is able to recognize movement and identify its direction.  If hand motions are correctly identified on four or more of five presentations, vision is recorded as hand motions.  If hand motions cannot be identified on four 
or more of five presentations, test for light perception.  
 Testing for Light Perception:  
 Light perception is tested using the same complete occlusion of the fellow eye with no other bright lights visible from the patient’s position.  The patient’s glasses are not worn.  The light of an indirect ophthalmoscope is directed into the eye from a distance of [ADDRESS_450494].  The patient is asked to report “on” when he or she sees the light, and “off” when it 
 21 disappears.  The process is repeated five times in a nonrhythmic fashion.  The 
visual acuity is recorded as light perception if the patient responds correctly four or more out of five times.  
 Testing Vi sual Acuity in Illiterate Patients:  
 Patients who are illiterate and cannot read standard letter charts have visual acuity tested using either a number chart, an illiterate E chart, a Landolt ring chart, or pi[INVESTIGATOR_361647].  The type of chart must be identif ied so that it can  be used 
throughout the duration of the study.  The smallest line in which one or fewer optotypes are missed is recorded as the Snellen visual acuity, and a notation is made that testing was performed in an illiterate patient.  
  
3.[ADDRESS_450495] fashion starting anteriorly and working posteriorly.  Standardizing subjective grading of bleb leaks and lenticular opacities is difficult, if not impossible.  However, it is expected that subjective grading by [CONTACT_180059].  Attempts will be made to compare subjective gradings between investigators.  
 Lids: 
 The lids are examined for signs of blepharitis, including scales and crusting of the lashes, inspi[INVESTIGATOR_179993], and erythema of the lid margin.  Eyes with severe posterior blepharitis are excluded from the study.  
 Conjunctiv a: 
 The conjunctiva is examined for scarring from prior trauma or cicatrizing disease (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome, ocular pemphigoid).  The presence and extent of conjunctival scarring may be evaluated using a cotton tipped applicator to test the mobili ty of the conjuctiva.  Eyes with conjunctival scarring that precludes a 
superior trabeculectomy are ineligible for the study.  
 Eyes must undergo Seidel testing at all postoperative follow -up examinations to 
detect conjunctival wound leaks and bleb leaks.  Eyes that have undergone Baerveldt implantation are examined carefully for tube or shunt erosion.  The presence of an infiltrate or exudate in the bleb of eyes that have undergone a 
 22 trabeculectomy with mitomycin C suggests the presence of a bleb- related 
infection.  
 
Cornea:  
 The cornea is examined at high magnification to evaluate the epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], stroma, and endothelium.  The techniques of diffuse illumination, scleral scatter, and retroillumination may be used.  Findings consistent with a diagnosis of the iridocorneal endoth elial (ICE) syndrome, epi[INVESTIGATOR_361648], or fibrous 
downgrowth make the eye ineligible for the study.  The presence of corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_361649].  Eyes that have undergone Baerveldt implantation are examined for the presence of tube- cornea touch.  
 Anterior Chamber:  
 Before fluorescein instillation or pupi[INVESTIGATOR_179995], the degree of anterior chamber c
ell and flare is determined.  Eyes with chronic or recurrent uveitis are excluded 
from the study.  Careful assessment  of the anterior chamber depth is made 
postoperatively.  If the anterior chamber is shallow, the central anterior chamber depth is measured relative to the corneal thickness.  The appropriate gradation of > 3 CT, > 2 CT, > 1 CT, < 1 CT, or lens -cornea touc h is documented.  In eyes 
treated with tube shunt surgery, the position of the tube in the anterior chamber is assessed and its length measured with a slit beam.  
 Ir
is: 
 Before pupi[INVESTIGATOR_179995], the pupi[INVESTIGATOR_361650].  If rubeosis iridis is present, the eye is 
ineligible for the study.  
 Lens:  
 After pupi[INVESTIGATOR_179995], the investigator assesses the lens and grades any cataract present as mild, moderate, or severe.  
  
3.[ADDRESS_450496] is performed using a fluorescein strip moistened with one or two drops of 0.5% proparacaine which is then applied to the conjuctiva.  Alternatively, one drop of premixed fluorescein and anesthetic may be instilled.  The area is closely observed using high magnification and a broad slit beam with maximal intensity illumination using a cobalt blue filter.  Aqueous leakage is apparent as a light yellow stream and interrupts a dark green background of undiluted 
 [ADDRESS_450497] is positive, the leak is graded as an ooze, frank 
leak, or brisk leak.  
  
3.4 Tonometry  
 
 
Goldmann applanation tonometry is used to measure the intraocular pressure, except when irregular corneal astigmat ism, corneal scarring, or corneal edema 
precludes accurate readings.  In these cases, the Tono- Pen (Mentor) is used.  
The intraocular pressure is measured prior to pupi[INVESTIGATOR_179995].  Whenever possible, the intraocular pressure should be  checked at the sa me time of the day 
as the Qualifying Assessment to minimize the effect of diurnal fluctuation of intraocular pressure.  
 Goldmann Applanation Tonometry:  
 The calibration of the Goldmann applanation tonometer is checked every 3 months, as d escribed in the Haag -Streit Goldmann Applanation Tonometer 
Operator’s Manual.  Clean the prism according to your institutional infection control policy.  The right eye is always tested first.  Following instillation of a drop of 0.5% proparacaine, a fluorescein strip is placed near the lateral canthus in the lower conjunctival sac.  Once the lacrimal fluid has been sufficiently colored, the fluorescein strip is removed.  Alternatively, one drop of premixed fluorescein and anesthetic may be instilled.  The patient’s head is properly positioned in the chin rest and against the forehead rest without leaning forward or straining.  Any tight -
fitting neckwear is loosened.  The patient is asked to look straight ahead at a distant object or fixation target.  If it is necessary to hol d the eyelids open, the 
investigator holds the eyelids open against the orbital rim taking care not to apply any pressure on the globe.  The patient is instructed not to hold his or her breath.  If corneal astigmatism is greater than 3.[ADDRESS_450498] two succ essive measurement s.  After testing of the 
right eye is complete, testing of the left eye follows the same technique.  
 
 24 Tono- Pen:  
 
The Tono- Pen (Mentor) is used in cases of corneal edema, corneal scarring, or 
irregular corneal astigmatism.  The Tono- Pen probe tip is covered with a new 
Ocu- Film Tip Cover.  The instrument is calibrated immediately prior to use, as 
described in the Mentor Tono- Pen Instruction Manual.  The right eye is always 
tested first.  A drop of 0.5% proparacaine is instilled.  The patient is positioned in the sitting position and instructed to fix on a distant object.  Tight -fitting neckwear 
is loosened, and the patient is instructed not to hold his or her breath.  The Tono-Pen is activated by [CONTACT_361666].  The Tono- Pen 
is brought in contact [CONTACT_10970]’s cornea lightly and briefly while holding the 
instrument perpendicular to the cornea.  A click will sound and a digital intraocular pressure measurement will be displayed each time a valid reading is obtained.  After four  valid readings, a final beep sounds and the averaged 
measurement appears on the display, along with a single line denoting statistical reliability.  Measurements are repeated until two successive readings are obtained within [ADDRESS_450499] a statis tical reliability of 5%, indicating 
that the standard deviation of the valid measurements is 5% or less of the number displayed.  The investigator records the last two successive measurements.  After testing of the right eye is complete, the same technique is 
applied to testing of the left eye.  
  
3.[ADDRESS_450500].  A drop of 0.5% proparacaine is instilled for anesthesia.  The patient is asked to look straight ahead at a distant object or fixation target.  The pachymeter probe is lined up with the center of the pupil and slowly advanced until it contacts the cornea.  The probe is withdrawn when an audible signal is made indicating that a measurement has been recorded.  The patient is instructe d to blink.  The procedure is repeated to obtain three separate readings, 
and the investigator records the measurements.  After testing of the right eye is complete, the same technique is applied to testing of the left eye.  
  
3.[ADDRESS_450501] ophthalmoscope and hand held condensing lens (20 diopter or 28 diopter Nikon aspheric lens) is used to evaluate the retinal periphery.  
 
 [ADDRESS_450502] is  performed in all patients using a 
size III white stimulus.  Visual field testing may be performed with the Swedish Interactive Thresholding Algorithm (SITA) or full threshold strategy, but the same testing strategy must be used throughout the duration of the study.  The pupil diameter should be 3 mm or greater before visual field testing is undertaken, and this may require pharmacologic dilation.  Standardized refraction is performed to determine the patient’s distance refraction and best -corrected visual acuity prior 
to visual field testing.  The age appropriate plus lens is added to the distance 
refraction.  Patient education is provided, and the instrument is set up for the test.  The technician should monitor the patient during testing.  Visual fields are performed preoperatively (within one month of enrollment in the study) and annually thereafter.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_361651].  
 27 4. Surgical Procedures  
 
 
4.1 Trabeculectomy with Mitomycin C  
 
4.2 Baervel dt Implantation  
   
 28 4.1 Trabeculectomy with Mitomycin C 
 
 
Anethesia:  
 
The type of anesthesia is at the surgeon’s discretion.  
 Conjunctival Flap:  
 The trabeculectomy is performed in a superior quadrant.  A limbus -based or 
fornix -based conjunctival flap may be used depending on the surgeon’s 
preference.  Eyes with conjunctival scarring that precludes a superior trabeculectomy are excluded from the study.  A corneal traction suture or superior rectus traction suture may be used to rotate the globe inferiorly and improve exposure.  
 Mitomycin C Application:  
 A fluid retaining sponge soaked in mitomycin C (0.4 mg/ml) is applied to the sclera in the region of the trabeculectomy site for a period of exactly two minutes (120 seconds).  The mitomycin may be applied before or after scleral flap 
dissection, as determined by [CONTACT_11065].  This area is then copi[INVESTIGATOR_361652] -U-Sol solution to remove any residual 
mitomycin C.  The type of sponge used for mitomycin C application is selected by [CONTACT_361667][INVESTIGATOR_361653].  
 Scleral Flap:  
 A corneal -based scleral flap is dissected approximately one- half scleral 
thickness.  The shape and size of the scleral flap is determined by [CONTACT_361667][INVESTIGATOR_361653].  
 Para centesis Tract:  
 A peripheral clear cornea paracentesis tract is made.  
 Excision of Limbal Tissue:  
 A block of limbal tissue is excised from underneath the trabeculectomy flap using a sharp blade and Vannas scissors or a Kelly punch.  The amount of limbal 
tissue excised is at the surgeon’s discretion.  
 Peripheral Iridectomy:  
 A peripheral iridectomy is performed in all cases.  The sclerostomy opening is inspected for entrapped iris tissue, and a cellulose sponge is used to test for the 
 29 presence of vitreous.   Vitreous presenting to the surgical wound is excised.  The 
method used to remove vitreous present at the surgical site is at the surgeon’s 
discretion.  
 Scleral Flap Closure:  
 The scleral flap is reapproximated to the scleral bed with interrupted or releasable 10- [ADDRESS_450503], the anterior chamber should remain formed with a visible leak present around the scleral flap at equilibrium.  
 Conjunctival Flap Closure:  
 The type of suture material and needle used for the conjunctival flap closure is of the surgeon’s choice.  Either a double layered closure (conjunctiva and Tenon’s closed separately) or single layered closure (conjunctiva and Tenon’s together) may be performed.  
 Reformation of the Anterior Chamber and Bleb Elevation:  
 Balanced salt solution is injected through the paracentesis tract to deepen the anterior chamber and  elevate the bleb.  A moistened fluorescein strip is used to 
check for a conjunctival leak or leakage from the paracentesis tract, which may be closed with additional sutures.  
 Intraoperative Medications:  
 The use of intraoperative medications is at the surgeon’s discretion.  Subconjunctival antibiotics and corticosteroids may be injected, and a cycloplegic -mydriatic drop and steroid- antibiotic ointment may be instilled at the 
conclusion of the case, as determined by [CONTACT_361667][INVESTIGATOR_361654].  
  
4.2 Baerveldt Implantation 
 
 
Anesthesia:  
 The type of anesthesia is at the surgeon’s discretion.  
     
 30 Conjunctival Flap:  
 
A 350 -mm2 Baerveldt is used in all cases, and implantation is performed in the 
superotemporal quadrant.   A limbus -based or fornix -based conjunctival flap may 
be used depending on the surgeon’s preference.  
 Scleral Exposure:  
 Sufficient exposure is obtained in the superotemporal quadrant to permit placement of the Baerveldt plate.  A corneal traction suture or epi[INVESTIGATOR_361655].  
 Insertion of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_361656]:  
 The 350- mm
2 Baerveldt plate may be positioned under or over the superior 
rectus and lateral rectus muscles, depending on the surgeon’s usual pr actice.  
The implant is sutured to the sclera at a measured distance of 10 mm posterior to the limbus using the two fixation holes on the plate.  The type of nonabsorbable suture used is of the surgeon’s choice.  
 Occlusion of Tube:  
 The B aerveldt tube must  be completely occluded in all cases in order to restrict 
aqueous flow to the plate until it becomes encapsulated.  This is done to minimize the incidence of postoperative hypotony.  The method of tube occlusion is left to the discretion of the surgeon.  Ligation of the tube with a polyglactin 
suture near the tube- plate junction, ligation with a polypropylene suture which is 
inserted into the anterior chamber with the tube, or internal occlusion of the tube using a “rip- cord” technique have all been used ef fectively.  A 30 -gauge cannula 
is used to cannulate the end of the tube and confirm complete occlusion of the tube.  Following tube occlusion, the surgeon may fenestrate the tube if desired.  The method of tube fenestration is left to the discretion of the surgeon.  
 Preparation of Tube:  
 The tube is trimmed bevel -up to extend 2 to 3 mm into the anterior chamber.  
 Insertion of Tube into the Anterior Chamber:  
 A 23-gauge needle is used to enter the anterior chamber at the posterior limbus 
parallel to the iris  plane.  The Baerveldt tube is inserted through this entry 
incision and should be well positioned in the anterior chamber away from the corneal endothelium and just above the iris.  A 23- gauge needle produces an 
adequate entry incision for the tube without  causing aqueous leakage around the 
tube.  
 
 31 Coverage of Tube:  
 
A donor patch graft composed of donor sclera, dura mater, or pericardium is used to cover the limbal portion of the tube.  The suture selected to fixate the patch graft is of the surgeon’s choic e. 
 Conjunctival Closure:  
 Tenon’s and conjunctiva are reapproximated to the limbus.  The suture used for the conjunctival closure is determined by [CONTACT_361667][INVESTIGATOR_361653].  
 Intraoperative Medications:  
 The use of intraoperative medications is at the surgeon’s discretion.  Subconjunctival antibiotics and corticosteroids may be injected, and a cycloplegic -mydriatic drop and steroid- antibiotic ointment may be instilled at the 
conclusion of the case, as determined by [CONTACT_361667][INVESTIGATOR_361653].

 41 INFORMED CONSENT  FORM  
 
PRIMARY TUBE VERSUS TRABECULECTOMY (PTVT) STUDY  
 
 
PURPOSE:    
Your doctor feels that you should have surgery as treatment for your glaucoma.  A trabeculectomy with mitomycin C or Baerveldt glaucoma implant are the two most 
common types of glaucoma operations performed.  Both procedures work by [CONTACT_1541] a 
route by [CONTACT_361675].  
The Baerveldt implant does so by [CONTACT_1299] a tube into the eye which shunts aqueous fluid to a silicone plate which is attached to the sclera (white portion of the eye).  A 
trabeculectomy allows aqueous fluid to drain through a trap door -like incision in the 
sclera, and mitomycin C is applied to this region to reduce the likelihood that the trap door will scar clos ed.  Comparable success rates and complication rates have been 
observed separately for the Baerveldt implant and trabeculectomy with mitomycin C.  While both procedures have been shown to be safe and effective, it is unclear if one is 
superior to the other .  The purpose of this study is to determine if one type of surgery 
works better with fewer complications.  This form documents a request for your 
participation in this study.  
 PROCEDURE:    
If you agree to participate in this study, you will be assigned by  [CONTACT_3364] (like a flip of a 
coin) to undergo either a trabeculectomy with mitomycin C or Baerveldt implant.  Your doctor will perform the normal postoperative examinations at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 
months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years after 
surgery, in addition to any other visits he or she feels are necessary.  Information collected at these visits will be analyzed for this study.    
 
RISKS:   
The surgical risks are similar for the Baerveldt implant and a trabeculectomy with mitomyc in C.  They include a risk of bleeding, infection, too low an intraocular pressure 
after surgery, failure of the operation to control the intraocular pressure, cataract, retinal 
swelling, and corneal swelling.  In addition, there is a risk of tube erosion and double 
vision associated with the Baerveldt implant, and a risk of leakage from the bleb and eye 
discomfort produced by [CONTACT_361676] a trabeculectomy with mitomycin C.  There 
appears to be a higher risk of serious infection associated with a mitomycin  
trabeculectomy compared with a Baerveldt implant.  You would experience these 
surgical risks whether you participate in the study or not.  This study will not produce any 
change in the typi[INVESTIGATOR_361659], so there are no  
additional risks to you for participating in the study.  
BENEFITS:   
No direct benefit can be promised to you for your participation in this study.  
 ALTERNATIVES:   
You have the alternative not to participate in this study, and receive either a 
trabeculec tomy with mitomycin C or Baerveldt implant as determined by [CONTACT_4904].  
   
 42 COSTS:    
You or your insurance company will be responsible for medical costs of participating in 
this study.  If you have insurance, your insurance company may or may not pay for t hese 
costs.  If you do not have insurance, or if your insurance company refuses to pay, you will be expected to pay.  You will not incur any added costs by [CONTACT_6231].  
 
COMPENSATION FOR INJURY:   
You may be exposed to risk  of injury from participation in this study.  If injury occurs, 
treatment will in most cases be available.  If you have insurance, your insurance 
company may or may not pay for these costs.  If you do not have insurance, or if your 
insurance company refuses to pay, you will be expected to pay.  Funds to compensate 
for pain, expenses, lost wages and other damages caused by [CONTACT_361677].  
 CONFIDENTIALITY:

7.2 Assignment of Patient Identification Number  
 7.3 Randomization Procedure 
 7.4 Schedule of Visits  
 
 44 7.1 Qualifying Assessment  
 
 
The Qualifying A ssessment establishes whether the patient satisfies PTVT Study 
eligibility criteria.  If the patient appears to be eligible for the study, the Clinical 
Center (CC) completes the Qualifying Assessment Form and Preoperative Form.  Both form s are faxed to the Statistical Coordinating Center (SCC), along with a 
copy of the consent form.  Informed consent is an eligibility criterion because it is an agreement by [CONTACT_361680] -up in their 
treatment group.  The SCC reviews each o f the inclusion and exclusion criteria to 
ensure that the patient is eligible.  It is vital to the scientific validity of the study that every eligible patient be offered enrollment.  
  
7.[ADDRESS_450507] digit refers to the patient’s stratum.  The fourth, fifth, and six digits are a sequential number for each patient within a stratum.  The final three letters are selected from the patient’s name [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_361681].  For example, an identification number 03-1- 003-
AZE refers to the third patient in stratum [ADDRESS_450508] at the time the patient is enrolled in the study.  After patient eligibility is confirmed and a patient identification number is provided, the SCC assigns treatment by [CONTACT_3041], “trabeculectomy with mitomycin C” or “Baerveldt implant”.  The CC then repeats the assigned treatment.  The surgery 
date is the study entry date, and the dates for all postoperative follow -up visits 
are computed from this date.  
 The randomization schedule is constructed using a computer pseudo -random 
number generator.  The allocation ratio is equal between the two treatment 
groups.  The randomization is blocked by [CONTACT_361682] a scheme with small variable blocks.  This procedure ensures that there is an equal number of patients in each treatment group even early in the trial, and that 
the CC is no t able to predict the next treatment assignment.  
 [ADDRESS_450509] be familiar with the schedule of visits to ensure that 
required data is collected and that future visits are scheduled within the appropriate time windows.  The need for continued follow -up and timely visits 
should be stressed to the patient during the informed consent process and throughout the study.  An appointment schedule is generated for each patient by [CONTACT_361683]’s  CC.  Time windows  for follow -up visits are 
shown in Table 2.  Table 3 summarizes the required data at each of the scheduled visits.

 50 8.1 Data Management  
 
 
A master log is kept of each patient randomized in the PTVT Study.  An 
appointment schedule is made for each patient and sent to the patient’s Clinical Center.  When a data form is received at the Statistical Coordinating Center, it is processed for filing and data entry.  Each form is data entered by a data entry clerk and then verif ied by [CONTACT_361684] y by [CONTACT_361685].  Edit 
checks, such as missing data and out -of-range values, will be clarified within the 
Clinical Center.  
 The statistical package SPSS is used for data entry, management, and analysis.  Each of the study’s two statistici ans has a personal computer and one more is 
dedicated to data entry.  The Research Coordinator also has a personal computer to use for data management, study correspondence, reports, and manuscripts.  Each computer, except the one dedicated to data entry, has access to the University of Miami’s network for e- mail, Internet access, and data 
file transfer.

stored at a remote facility.  Computer data files used for publication are saved and stored as separate files.  
  
8.3 Data Forms  
 
 
The data forms were designed to be  self-explanatory.   Their completion should 
not require reference to separate information manuals.  The data forms contain information to be collected at a given point in time during the study.  Information collected at another date is incorporated into a separate form.  Da ta forms are 
faxed to the Statistical Coordinating Center for data entry.  Forms will be reviewed periodically and revised as dictated by [CONTACT_180083].  The various data forms are provided at the end of this section.  
 51 8.4 Data Management  
 
 
A master log is kept of each patient randomized in the PTVT Study.  An 
appointment schedule is made for each patient and sent to the patient’s Clinical Center.  When a data form is received at the Statistical Coordinating Center, it is processed for fili ng and data entry.   Each form is data entered by a data entry 
clerk and then verified by [CONTACT_361686].  Edit checks, such as missing data and out -of-range values, will be clarified within the 
Clinical Center.  
 [ADDRESS_450511] the entry site of the tube assessed with gonioscopy at the 1 year, 3 year, and 5 year study visits.  
 Specular Microscopy:  
 Specular microscopy is performed at the Qualifying Assessment, and measurem ents are repeated at the [ADDRESS_450512] images 
taken.  
 
Gonioscopy:  
 In patients randomized to the tube group, gonioscopy is used to identify the position of the tube entry site in the angle relative to a fixed landmark at the 1 year, 3 year, and 5 year follow -up visits.  Schwalbe’s line se rves as this 
landmark, and it is the peripheral limit of the corneal endothelium.  The tube entry is graded as all of tu be posterior to Schwalbe’s line, s ome of the tube  but less 
than 50% anterior to Schwalbe’s line , more than 50% and les s than 100% of tub e 
Anterior to Schwalbe’s line, and all of tube anterior to Schwalbe’s line.   
9.[ADDRESS_450513] differences are expected at the 5 year follow -up 
visit.  However, comparisons are made at 1 and 3 years postoperatively as there 
may be substantial loss to follow -up of study patients by 5 years. The 
significance of the difference between loss rates in the two treatment groups are  
assessed with analysis  of covariance.  Covariates include baseline counts and 
classification of the tube site by [CONTACT_361687].  Baseline patient demographic variables are  included in explorator y 
analyses.  Other anal yses focus on coefficient of variation and percentage 
hexagonality measurements.  Another secondary analysis involves  endothelial 
cell count loss rates in the study eye compared to the non- study eye.  The 
longitudinal measurements of count data are used to examine the characteristics 
of loss with time.  
  
 
 55 9.5 Sample Size  
 
 
The PTVT Study  has a fixed sample size.  This ancillary study is performed on all 
enrolled patients at Clinical Centers that are able to measure corneal endothelial density.

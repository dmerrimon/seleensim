2 High-risk versus low-risk of progression to se vere COVID-19 (high-ri sk is defined above) 
 
The enrollment of low-risk  participants has stopped. 
Up to approximately 1700 participants will be ra ndomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single IM 
dose of 600 mg of AZD7442 (n = up to a pproximately 850) or placebo (n = up to 
approximately 850) on Day 1. The first 20 participants to be dosed (approximately 
10 allocated to the AZD7442 group and 10 allocat ed to placebo) will form a sentinel group. 
After the entire sentinel group ha s been dosed, further enrollment  will pause until the sentinel 
group’s safety data through Day 8 has been re viewed by [CONTACT_198646] a 
recommendation to continue or to ha lt dosing of additional participants. 
Participants will be enrolled into one of 2 independent cohorts: 
x Cohort 1 (n = approximately 300), which wi ll include the sentinel group, will undergo 
more intensive testing to char acterize their viro logical and immunologi cal status, and to 
correlate that status with clinical outcomes. 
x Cohort 2 (n = up to approximately 1400) will be followed for clinical outcomes. 
 
Following screening, and no more than 7 days (‘Day 1’ sympto m count starts from the first 
day of symptoms) from self-reported onset of  COVID-19-related symptoms or measured 
fever, participants will receive a single dose of IMP. The dose will be administered as 2 
separate IM injections (one  for AZD8895 and one for AZD1061; the 2 compounds will not be 
co-administered) in the gluteal region. In Cohort 1, the first 20  participants dosed (ie, the 
sentinel group) will undergo safety monitori ng for [ADDRESS_237047] participant in the sentinel group before the next pa rticipant can be dosed. The next 80 
participants (21 to 100) will then unde rgo safety monitoring for [ADDRESS_237048] IMP administration, 
otherwise the minimum safety monitoring time will be 1 hour. In addition, the sentinel group 
will be contact[CONTACT_198647] (in-person or by [CONTACT_94725]) for the first [ADDRESS_237049] access to emergency kits for treatment of severe anaphylactic

After administration of the dose of study inte rvention on Day 1, participants will undergo 
28 days of intensive follow-up, followed by [CONTACT_198648]-up through Day 457.  
Disclosure Statement : This is a parallel-group treatment  study with 2 arms that are 
double-blind.  
Number of Participants:  CRM [ADDRESS_237050] 60% of participants will meet the protocol definition 
of being at high-risk of progression to severe COVID- 19. Enrollment will stop when 
approximately [ADDRESS_237051]  been confirmed in the primary analysis 
population. 
Note : “Enrolled” means a participant’s, or their legally acceptable representative’s, agreement 
to participate in a clinical  study following completion of th e informed consent process. 
Potential participants who are screened for the purpose of determining eligibility for the study, 
but are not randomly assigned in the study, are considered “screen failures”, unless otherwise 
specified by [CONTACT_760].  
Intervention Groups and Duration:  Participants will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_237052]:  Yes 
Statistical Methods 
Primary Endpoint: The primary efficacy endpoint is a co mposite of either severe COVID-19 
or death from any cause through Day 29. Severe COVID-19 is ch aracterized by a minimum of 
either pneumonia (fever, cough, tachypnea, or dy spnea, AND lung infiltrates) or hypoxemia 
(SpO 2 < 90% in room air and/or severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_196675]) and a WHO Clinical Progression 
Scale score of 5 or higher (Appendix F). 
Sample Size: Up to approximately 1700 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive a single 600 mg IM dose of AZD7442 (n = up to approximately 850) or placebo (n = 
up to approximately 850) on Day 1. 
The study has  to detect a RRR of  in the incidence of severe COVID-19/death 
in the AZD7442 group compared to the placebo group,  
.  
All participants will re main in the study for up to [ADDRESS_237053] completed the study (ie, all partic ipants have completed 
Day 457 visit, see Figure 1).
The study will be completely double-blind until the primary analysis (ie, blind for participants, 
Investigators/site staff, and Sponsor/designated clinical rese arch organization). The site 
personnel, participants, and the st udy team members who participat e in the advice or decisions 
involving study conduct or day-to-day interactions  with the site, will re main blinded until the 
end of the study (ie, all particip ants have completed Day 457 visit)  to ensure the trial integrity 
is maintained.

of atypi[INVESTIGATOR_198606]. As of 6 October 2020, the virus has spread to a ll corners of the globe, 
with over 35 million confirmed cases reported an d more than one million associated deaths 
(Tamhane et al 2018 and WHO 2020). The C OVID-19 pandemic is causing major disruption 
to global healthcare systems with si gnificant socioeconomic impacts.  
Effective interventions to prevent or treat COVID-19 remain few in  number and clinical 
experience is limited.  
As a response to the ongoing pandemic, AstraZen eca is developi[INVESTIGATOR_198607]-CoV-2 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_144870]. The SARS-CoV-2 spi[INVESTIGATOR_198608]’s RBD, which enables the

infection.  
AZD7442, a combination of 2 of these mAbs  (AZD8895 and AZD1061), is being evaluated 
for administration to treat or  prevent COVID-19. There is cu rrently one ongoing Phase I study 
with AZD7442 (study D8850C00001) and 2 ong oing Phase III prophylaxis studies (a 
pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID- [ADDRESS_237073]-exposure

L234F/L235E/P331S I in the Fc region were e ngineered for both AZD8895 and AZD1061 to 
abrogate Fc mediated effector  function, which is expected to reduce theoretical risk of 
antibody-dependent enhancement. The purpose of  this Phase III study is to determine if 
AZD7442 can safely treat COVID-[ADDRESS_237076] cells during coronavirus infection 
via different receptors (Li 2016). SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the phylogenetic lineage B of the 
genus Beta-coronavirus and it recognizes the AC E2 as the entry recepto r (Zhou et al 2020). It 
is the seventh coronavirus known to cause hum an infections and th e third known to cause 
severe disease after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV .

re-screened if the eligibility criterion that resu lted in screen failure has changed in a manner 
that meets eligibility. Only a single re-scr eening is allowed in the study. Re-screened 
participants should be assigne d the same participant number as for the ini tial screening. 
Individuals who are re-screened do no t need to re-consent for the study. 
6 STUDY INTERVENTION 
The IMP is defined as any inve stigational intervention(s), mark eted product(s), or placebo 
intended to be administered to or  medical device(s) utilized by  a study participant according to 
the study protocol. 
6.1 Investigational Medicinal Products Administered 
6.1.1 Investigational Medicinal Products 
Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ra tio to receive one single 600 mg dose of AZD7442 
(administered as a 3 mL IM injection containing 300 mg AZD 8895 and a 3 mL IM injection 
containing 300 mg AZD1061) or saline place bo (administered as 2 separate 3 mL IM 
injections) (Table 4). Inves tigational medicinal product will be administered on Day 1, and 
participants will be monitored for [ADDRESS_237093]; IM Intramuscular; w/v Weight/volume.

 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY42 of 115  6.2.1 Dose Preparation and Admi nistration Instructions 
Each vial selected for dose pr eparation should be inspected. If there are any defects noted with 
the IMP, the investigator and site mo nitor should be notified immediately. 
AZD7442 (AZD8895 and AZD1061) or placebo shoul d be administered in tramuscularly with 
one 3.0 mL injection in each gluteal re gion. The 2 drug products, AZD8895 and AZD1061 
(comprising AZD7442), must both be  administered separately to the participant in sequential 
order, with no participant receiving doses of AZD8895 without also receiving the matching 
dose of AZD1061. Refer to Handling Instruct ions for detailed dose preparation and 
administration information.  
6.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding 
6.3.1 Randomization 
All participants will be centra lly assigned to randomized IMP using an IRT. Before the study 
is initiated, user guides, the l og in information, and directions for the IRT will be provided to 
each study site. Randomization will  be stratified (using centra lized blocked randomization) 
by: 
1 7LPHIURPV\PSWRPRQVHW  5 days versus > 5 days) 
2 High-risk versus low-risk of progression to severe COVID-19 (high- risk is defined in 
Section 4.1) 
The enrollment of low-risk  participants is stopped. 
Where a participant does not meet all the eligibil ity criteria but incorrectly received IMP, the 
investigator should inform the Study Physicia n immediately, and a discussion should occur 
between the Study Physician and the investigator regarding whether to continue or discontinue 
the participant. 
6.3.[ADDRESS_237096] prior to dose 
preparation (due to differences  in container closure), IMP will be handled by [CONTACT_29646] (or designee, in accordance with lo cal and institutional re gulations) at the study 
site. Syringe masking will be required in order to maintain the blind. 
The randomization code should not be broken except in medical emergencies when the 
appropriate management of  the participant requires knowledge of  the treatment

participant’s condition (eg, antidote available), th e investigator has the sole responsibility for 
determining if unblinding of a participants’ IMP assignment is warranted. Participant safety 
must always be the first consid eration in making such a deter mination. If a participant’s IMP 
assignment is unblinded, the Sponsor must be  notified within [ADDRESS_237098] under the guidance of  study personnel. The date (and time, if 
applicable) of dose administered in the clinic will be recorded in the source documents and 
recorded in the eCRF. If a problem occurs durin g dosing, such as needle break, no re-dosing is 
permitted. 
6.5 Concomitant Therapy 
Permitted, prohibited, and restricted me dications are summarized in Table 5. 
Any medication or vaccine (including over-the- counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, 
and/or herbal supplements) that the participant is receiving at  the time of enrollment or 
receives during the study must  be recorded, along with:

During the study, when participants become eligib le for access to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, it is 
appropriate that they can discu ss with the investigator and othe rs after Day 30 so as to make 
an informed choice. The following considerations apply: 
x Participants should not receive vaccination with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine during 
their acute illness. 
 Participants in this study will have active COVID-[ADDRESS_237101] on acute 
COVID-19. 
x Participants in this study are unlikely to receive any benefit from vaccination with an 
anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine after recovery from COVID-19. 
 There is no evidence that shows that partic ipants will benefit from vaccination with 
an anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine after r ecovery from their acute COVID-19.

 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY46 of 115   After recovery from COVID-19, most partic ipants in this tr ial would have a

believe that the protection afforded by [CONTACT_198659] l infection is less fre quent or less robust 
than the protection provided by [CONTACT_198660]. 
x Participants may wish to be vaccinated. If so, they may be unblinded as to their 
randomized investigational treat ment in this study as pe r study unblinding procedure 
(Section 6.3.3), counselled, and referred outsi de the study for poss ible vaccination. 
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_198617] a rationale th at participants in this study are likely to 
benefit from receiving a SARS -CoV-2 vaccine, some may wish to be vaccinated. In 
such situations, after rec overy from their COVID-19, and appropriate counselling, 
such participants can be unblinded as to th eir randomized investigational treatment in 
this study. With that information, they can be furt her counselled: 
o Unblinded participants who received pl acebo should be advised that no study-
associated contraindication to receiving a vaccine exists. 
o Unblinded participants who received AZ D7442 should be advised that, in the 
presence of adequate neut ralizing antibody titers, an appropriate and effective 
response to the vaccine might be impaire d. Such participants should be advised 
to consider waiting an a ppropriate length of time (9 to 12 months) before 
receiving an anti-SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_237102] been unblinded in order to receive vaccination can and should remain 
in the study after being unblinded. 
6.6 Dose Modification 
The IMP will be administered  as described in Section 6.1.1. Dose modification is not 
permitted unless in case of discon tinuation of IMP, as per investig ator’s clinical judgment. Re-
administration of dose (re-cha llenge) is not permitted.  
6.7 Intervention After the End of the Study 
There is no intervention after the end of the study (see defin ition in Section 4.4).

DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL 
7.[ADDRESS_237103] 
Participants will receive a single dose of 6 00 mg AZD7442 (administered as a single IM 
injection containing 300 mg AZD8895 and a single IM injection containing 300 mg 
AZD1061) or saline placebo. 
It may be necessary for a participant to tempor arily interrupt their injection of IMP. If the 
injection of IMP is not resumed (ie, it is disc ontinued), the participant should remain in the 
study to be evaluated.  
Note that discontinuation of IMP is NOT the same thing as a withdrawal from the study. 
7.2 Participant Withdrawal from the Study 
x A participant may withdraw fro m the study at any time at his/ her own request, or may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of  the investigator for safety, behavioral, 
compliance, or administrative reasons. This is expected to be uncommon. 
x A participant who consider s withdrawing from the study must be informed by [CONTACT_198661]-up options (eg, telephone contact, a contact [CONTACT_4490] a 
relative or treating physician, or in formation from medical records). 
x At the time of withdrawal from the study, if possible, an  Early Discontinuation visit 
should be conducted, as shown in the SoA (Table 1 for Cohort 1 and Table 2 for 
Cohort 2). See the SoA for data to be colle cted at the time of study withdrawal and 
follow-up and for any further evaluati ons that need to  be completed. 
x If the participant withdraws consent for disclo sure of future information, the Sponsor may 
retain and continue to use any data collect ed before such a wit hdrawal of consent. 
x If a participant withdraw s from the study, it should be confir med if he/she still agrees for 
existing samples to be used in line with the or iginal consent. If he/s he requests withdrawal 
of consent for use of samples, destruction of  any samples taken and not tested should be 
carried out in line with what was stated in the informed c onsent and local regulation. The 
investigator must document the decision on use of existing samples in the site study 
records and inform the Global Study Team.

x The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_31823] t and reschedule the miss ed visit as soon as 
possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintain ing the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain whether or not the partic ipant wishes to and/or should continue in 
the study. 
x Before a participant is  deemed lost to follow up, the inve stigator or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact  [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, 
if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last know n mailing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_24101]’s 
medical record. 
x Should the participant continue  to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study.  
x Site personnel, or an independent  third party, will attempt to collect the survival status of 
the participant within legal and ethical boundaries for all participants randomized, 
including those who did not get the IMP. Pub lic sources may be searched for survival 
status information. If survival status is determined as dece ased, this will be documented 
and the participant will not be considered lo st to follow-up. Sponsor personnel will not be 
involved in any attempts to collect  survival status information. 
 
Discontinuation of specific sites or of the study as a whole are handled as part of Appendix A. 
7.4 Study Suspension/Early Termination 
The Sponsor reserves the right to  temporarily suspend or perman ently terminate this study or a 
component of the study at any time. The reas ons for temporarily su spending the study may 
include, but are not limit ed to, the following: 
x Any death, SAE, or other safety finding assessed as related to  IMP that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_198618], may preclude furt her administration of IMP. 
x If one or more partic ipants experience a grade [ADDRESS_237105] 100 participants, experience a grade 3 or higher 
injection site reaction. 
 
In such a situation, no additional participants will be randomized or treated with IMP until 
review by [CONTACT_198662] (see Appendix A 5).

IMP. 
x Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is 
essential and require d for study conduct. 
x All screening evaluations must be complete d and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all participants screened a nd to confirm eligibility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable. 
x Procedures conducted as part of the particip ant’s routine clinical  management (eg, blood 
count) and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilized for sc reening or baseline 
purposes, provided the procedures have met the protocol-specified criteria and were 
performed within the timefr ame defined in the SoA. 
x The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of the 
study, including any extra assessments that may be required, will not exceed [ADDRESS_237106] ed at each in-person visit. 
At study entry, if peripheral oxygen satu ration is < 92% on usua l supplemental oxygen 
requirements, the participant should be referr ed for emergency department evaluation and 
should not initiate IMP. 
During follow-up in-person visits (after  Day 1) through Day 29, peripheral oxygenation 
saturation measures < 96% should be reviewed by [CONTACT_198663].

The PI [INVESTIGATOR_198624]. 
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix B. 
Adverse events will be reported by [CONTACT_198670] (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, 
surrogate, or the participant’s legally authorized representative).  
The investigator and any designees are respon sible for detecting, documenting, and recording 
events that meet the definition of an AE.

If the investigator becomes awar e of a SAE with a suspected ca usal relationship to the IMP 
that occurs after the end of the clinical study in a participant treated by [CONTACT_198671], the 
investigator shall, without undue de lay, report the SAE to the Sponsor. 
8.3.2 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs 
Any AEs that are unresolved at the participant’s last AE assess ment in the study are followed 
up by [CONTACT_198672] r as long as medically indicated, bu t without further recording in the 
eCRF. [COMPANY_008] retains the right to request ad ditional information for any participant with 
ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary. 
Clinical Study Protocol - 7.0 [COMPANY_008] 
AZD7442 - D8851C00001 
 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY57 of 115  Adverse event variables 
The following variables will be collected for each AE; 
x AE (verbatim) 
x The date and time when the AE started and stopped 
x Severity grade/maximum severity  
x Whether the AE is serious or not 
x Investigator causality rating against the IMP(s) (yes or no) 
x Action taken with regard to IMP 
x If the AE caused participant’s wi thdrawal from study (yes or no)  
x Outcome 
 
In addition, the following variab les will be collected for SAEs: 
x Date AE met criteria for SAE 
x Date investigator became aware of SAE 
x AE is serious due to 
x Date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
x Date of discharge 
x Probable cause of death 
x Date of death 
x Autopsy performed 
x Causality assessment in rela tion to study procedure(s) 
x Causality assessment to other medication 
 
The following severity ratings will be used: 
x Grade 1: An event of mild intensity that is  usually transient and may require only minimal 
treatment or therapeutic inte rvention. The event does not ge nerally interfere with usual 
activities of daily living. 
x Grade 2: An event of moderate intensity that is usually alleviated with additional, specific 
therapeutic intervention. The even t interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing 
discomfort, but poses no signi ficant or permanent risk of harm to the participant. 
x Grade 3: A severe event that requires in tensive therapeutic in tervention. The event 
interrupts usual activities of dail y living, or significantly affect s the clinical status of the 
participant. 
Clinical Study Protocol - 7.0 [COMPANY_008] 
AZD7442 - D8851C00001 
 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY58 of 115  x Grade 4: An event, and/or its immediate sequel ae, that is associated with an imminent risk 
of death. 
x Grade 5: Death as result of an event. 
 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs: 
x Severity is a measure of intensity, whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_198673] B 2. 
x An AE of severe intensity need not necessa rily be considered serious. For example, 
nausea that persists for severa l hours may be considered severe nausea, but not an SAE. 
On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of  disability may be 
considered a mild stroke, but would be an SAE. 
 
8.3.3 Causality Collection 
The investigator should asse ss causal relationship between IMP and each AE, and answer 
‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘D o you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the 
event may have been caused by [CONTACT_2203]?’ 
For SAEs , causal relationship should also be as sessed for other medication(s) and study 
procedures. Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any st udy procedure the causal 
relationship is implied as ‘yes’. 
A guide to the interpretation of the caus ality question is found in Appendix B. 
8.3.[ADDRESS_237116] 
AESIs will be collected according to the time points specified in the SoA (see Table 1 for 
Cohort 1 and Table 2 for Cohort 2). 
AESIs are events of scientific and medical intere st, specific to the further understanding of the 
IMP safety profile, and require  close monitoring and rapid co mmunication by [CONTACT_198674]. An AESI can be serious or non-serious. All AESIs will be recorded in the 
eCRF. Serious AESIs will be recorded and reported as per Section 8.3.9. See also the 
AZD7442 IB, for additional information on AESIs. 
AESIs for AZD7442 are listed below. They include: 
x Anaphylaxis and other serious hypersensiti vity reactions, including immune complex 
disease 
x Injection site reactions

 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY59 of 115  8.3.5 Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms 
All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_198675] r, or reported in response to 
the open question from the study site staff: ‘Have you had any health problems since the 
previous visit/you were last asked?’, or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], will be collected and 
recorded in the eCRF. When collecting AEs, th e recording of diagnoses  is preferred (when 
possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms. However,  if a diagnosis is known and 
there are other signs or symptoms  that are not genera lly part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis 
and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 
See Section 8.3.8 for the reporting of COVID-19-related symptoms. 
8.3.6 Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests 
The results from the protocol-mandated laborator y tests and other safety assessments will be 
summarized in the CSR.  
Deterioration, as compared to baseline in pr otocol-mandated safety assessments, should 
therefore only be reported as AEs if they fu lfil any of the SAE crit eria, are the reason for 
discontinuation of treatment with the IMP, or ar e considered to be clinically relevant, as 
judged by [CONTACT_093] (which may include, but is not limited to, consideration as to 
whether treatment or non-planned vi sits were required or other action was taken with the IMP, 
eg, dose adjustment or drug interruption).   
If deterioration in a laboratory va lue/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE  and the associated laboratory result/vital sign 
will be considered as additional information. Wherever possible the reporting investigator 
uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory te rm (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value). In 
the absence of clinical signs or  symptoms, clinically relevant  deteriorations in non-mandated 
parameters should be reported as AE(s). 
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant a bnormal medical finding at a physical examination 
as compared with the baseline  assessment will be reported as an AE unless unequivocally 
related to the disease under study.

8.3.8 Disease Under Study 
AZD7442 treatment studies will take a consistent approach to the handling of symptoms 
related to COVID-19, the disease under study. 
COVID-19 symptoms or signs, such as fever, cough, shortness of breath/difficulty breathing, 
sore throat, body/muscle pain, fa tigue, headache, chills, nasal obstruction or congestion, nasal 
discharge, new loss of taste or smell, naus ea, vomiting, diarrhea, new onset confusion (only

 60 years old), increased suppl emental oxygen requirement (only for participants on baseline 
supplemental oxygen) will be recorded as AEs when any of the following occur: 
x The sign or symptom is serious accordi ng to the definition in Appendix B 2. 
x The participant discontinues the st udy due to the sign or symptom. 
x In the investigator’s judgment , the sign or symptom is not considered COVID-[ADDRESS_237118] to be reported, whether or not co nsidered causally related to the IMP, or to the 
study procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF. 
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, in vestigators or other s ite personnel will inform 
the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives within one day ie, immediately but no later than 
[ADDRESS_237119] igators or other site personnel will inform 
[COMPANY_008] representatives of any follow- up information on a prev iously reported SAE

 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY61 of 115  Once the investigators or other s ite personnel indicate an AE is serious in the EDC system, an 
automated email alert is sent to the designated [COMPANY_008] representative. 
If the EDC system is not availabl e, then the investigator or ot her study site staff reports a SAE 
to the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representative by [CONTACT_756]. 
The [COMPANY_008] representative will advise the investigator/study site staff how to proceed. 
The SAE must also be entered into the EDC system when it is available again. 
The reference document for defini tion of expectedness/listedness is the IB for the [COMPANY_008] 
drug. 
8.3.10  Pregnancy 
All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to [COMPANY_008], except for: 
x If the pregnancy is discovered before th e study participant has received any IMP. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Maternal Exposure 
The IMP should not be given to pregnant women.  
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a su spi[INVESTIGATOR_198625] a contraceptive medication. Congenital 
abnormalities/birth defects and s pontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as 
SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs. The outcome 
of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, el ective termination, ectopic  pregnancy, normal 
birth or congenital abnormality) should be follo wed up and documented even if the participant 
was discontinued from the study. 
If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study , then the investigator or other site personnel 
informs the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives within one day , ie, immediately but no 
later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. 
The designated [COMPANY_008] representative works with the investigator to ensure that all 
relevant information is provided to the [COMPANY_008] Patient Safety data entry site within one 
or 5 calendar days  for SAEs (see Section 8.3.9) and within [ADDRESS_237120] 365 
days after the IMP dose.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Paternal Exposure  
Male participants should refrain from father ing a child during the study and for 365 days 
following the administration of IMP. 
In case of pregnancy of the partner of a male participant, the partner’s pregnancy should be 
reported on the pregnancy form (consent from the partner must be obtained before the 
pregnancy form is completed) following the same  timeframe and routing as described for any 
participant’s pregnancy. Pregnancy of the particip ant’s partner is not considered to be an AE. 
These pregnancies will also be followed up, a nd the outcome of the pregnancy (spontaneous 
miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal bi rth, or congenital abnormality) 
should, if possible, be ob tained and documented. 
Sperm Donation 
Male participants should not donate sperm for the duration of the st udy and for at least 365 
days after the IMP dose. 
8.3.11  Medication Error 
If a medication error occurs in the course of th e study, then the investigator or other site 
personnel informs the appropriate As traZeneca representatives within one day , ie, 
immediately but no later than 24 hours  of when he or she becomes aware of it. 
The designated [COMPANY_008] representative works with the investigator to ensure that all 
relevant information is completed within 1 (Initial Fatal/Life-Threatening or follow-up 
Fatal/Life-Threatening) or 5 (other serious initial and follow-up) calendar days  if there is an 
SAE associated with the medica tion error (see Section 8.3.9) and within 30 days  for all other 
medication errors. 
The definition of a Medication Erro r can be found in Appendix B 4.  
8.4 Overdose 
For this study, any dose of AZD7442  > 600 mg (ie, AZD8895 > 300 mg or 
AZD1061 > 300 mg) will be considered an overdose. 
[COMPANY_008] does not recommend a specific treatment for an over dose. Symptoms of overdose 
should be treated as pe r clinical judgment.

methodology used to conserve al pha is detailed in Section 9.4.5. 
9.[ADDRESS_237124] 60% of participants 
will meet the protocol definition of being at hi gh-risk of progression to severe COVID-19 (see 
Section 4.1 for definition of high-risk). 
Note : “Enrolled” means a participant’s, or their legally acceptable representative’s, agreement 
to participate in a clinical  study following completion of th e informed consent process. 
Potential participants who are screened for the purpose of determining eligibility for the study, 
can be re-screened once. If they are not subseque ntly randomly assigned in the study, they are 
considered “screen failures”. 
Up to approximately 1700 participants, allowing for variability of the placebo groups primary 
endpoint event rate, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single IM 600 mg dose of 
AZD7442 (n = up to approximately 850) or place bo (n = up to approximately 850) on Day 1.

 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY82 of 115  Appendix B  Adverse Events: Definitions a nd Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow-up, and Reporting 
B [ADDRESS_237142] a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be  any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest pain), or disease 
temporally associated with the use of an IMP, whether or not considered  related to the IMP.  
The term AE is used to include both se rious and non-serious AEs and can include a 
deterioration of a pre-existing medical occurrence. An AE may occur at any time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no IMP has be en administered. 
B 2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
A SAE is an AE occurring during any study phase  (ie, run-in, treatment, washout, follow-up), 
that fulfils one or more of the following criteria: 
x Results in death 
x Is immediately life-threatening 
x Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73606]  
x Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
x Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
x Is an important medical event that may jeopa rdize the participant or may require medical 
treatment to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
 
Adverse events for malignant tumors  reported during a study should generally be assessed as 
SAEs . If no other seriousne ss criteria apply, the  ‘Important Medical Even t’ criterion should be 
used. In certain situations, how ever, medical judgment on an i ndividual event basis should be 
applied to clarify that the malignant tumor event should be  assessed and reported as a 
non-serious AE . For example, if the tumor is incl uded as medical hist ory and progression 
occurs during the study, but the progression does not change tr eatment and/or prognosis of the 
malignant tumor, the AE may not  fulfil the attributes  for being assessed as serious, although 
reporting of the progression of the malignant tumor as an AE  is valid and should occur.  Also, 
some types of malignant tumors, which do not sp read remotely after a routine treatment that 
does not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be assessed as non-serious; examples in adults include 
Stage 1 basal cell carcinoma and Stage 1A1 cervical cancer remove d via cone biopsy. 
Clinical Study Protocol - 7.0 [COMPANY_008] 
AZD7442 - D8851C00001 
 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY83 of 115  Life-threatening 
‘Life-threatening’ means that the participant wa s at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or c ontinued use of the product would result in the 
participant’s death. ‘Life-threaten ing’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe 
form it might have caused deat h (eg, hepatitis that resolved  without hepatic failure). 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_198628] a SAE, although the reasons for it 
may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema). Hosp ital admissions and/or  surgical operations 
planned before or during a study are not considered  AEs if the illness or disease existed before 
the participant was enrolled in the study, provide d that it did not deterior ate in an unexpected 
way during the study. 
Important Medical Event or Medical Treatment 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exerci sed in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical  events may not be immediately life-threatening or result in 
death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], disability, or incapacity , but may jeopardize th e participant or may 
require medical treatment to prevent one or more  outcomes listed in th e definition of serious. 
These should usually be considered as serious. 
Simply stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_198629]; medical 
judgment must be used. 
x Angioedema not severe enough to require in tubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone 
treatment 
x Hepatotoxicity caused by [CONTACT_76475] (ace taminophen) overdose requi ring treatment with 
N-acetylcysteine 
x Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm 
x Blood dyscrasias (eg, neutrope nia or anemia requiring blood transfusion, etc) or 
convulsions that do not re sult in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
x Development of drug dependency or drug abuse 
 
Severity Rating Scale: 
x Grade 1: An event of mild intensity that is  usually transient and may require only minimal 
treatment or therapeutic inte rvention. The event does not ge nerally interfere with usual 
activities of daily living. 
x Grade 2: An event of moderate intensity that is usually alleviated with additional, specific 
therapeutic intervention. The even t interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing 
discomfort, but poses no signi ficant or permanent risk of harm to the participant. 
Clinical Study Protocol - 7.0 [COMPANY_008] 
AZD7442 - D8851C00001 
 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY84 of 115  x Grade 3: A severe event that requires in tensive therapeutic in tervention. The event 
interrupts usual activities of da ily living, or significantly affect s the clinical status of the 
participant. 
x Grade 4: An event, and/or its immediate sequel ae, that is associated with an imminent risk 
of death. 
x Grade 5: Death as result of an event. 
 It is important to distinguish between serious  and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_73010] B 2. An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may be considered  severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Appendix B 2. On the other hand, a stroke  that results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria 
shown in Appendix B 2. 
B 3 A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question 
When making an assessment of causality consider  the following factors when deciding if there 
is a ‘reasonable possibility’ that an AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641]. 
x Time Course. Exposure to suspect drug. Has the participant actually received the suspect 
drug? Did the AE occur in a r easonable temporal relationship to the administration of the 
suspect drug? 
x Consistency with known drug profile. Was th e AE consistent with the previous 
knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same 
pharmacological class? Or, could the AE be anticipa ted from its pharmacological 
properties? 
x De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolv e or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_122570]? 
x No alternative cause. The AE cannot be reason ably explained by [CONTACT_11693], such as 
the underlying disease, other drugs, ot her host, or environmental factors. 
x Re-challenge experience. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after 
having been stopped? [COMPANY_008] would not normally recommend or support a 
re-challenge. 
x Laboratory tests. A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship. 
 
Clinical Study Protocol - 7.0 [COMPANY_008] 
AZD7442 - D8851C00001 
 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY85 of 115  In difficult cases, other factor s could be considered, such as: 
x Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the drug? 
x Is there a known mechanism? 
 
Causality of ‘related’ is made if, following a review of the re levant data, there is evidence for 
a ‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship for the indi vidual case. The expression 
‘reasonable possibility’ of a causa l relationship is meant to convey,  in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to  suggest a causal relationship. 
The causality assessment is performed ba sed on the available data, including enough 
information to make an informed judgment. With  no available facts or arguments to suggest a 
causal relationship, the event(s) will  be assessed as  ‘not related’. 
Causal relationship in cases where the disease under study has deteriorated due to lack of 
effect should be classified as no reasonable possibility. 
B 4 Medication Error 
For the purposes of this clinical study, a medi cation error is an uninte nded failure or mistake 
in the treatment process for an [COMPANY_008] IMP th at either causes harm to the participant or 
has the potential to cause harm to the participant.  
A medication error is not lack of efficacy of the drug, but rather a human or process-related 
failure while the drug is in control of  the study site staff or participant. 
Medication error includes situ ations where an error:  
x Occurred 
x Was identified and intercepted before  the participant received the drug 
x Did not occur, but circumstances were rec ognized that could have led to an error 
 
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors: 
x Drug name [CONTACT_2976] 
x Dispensing error eg, medication prepared incorrectly, even if  it was not actually given to 
the participant 
x Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of 
administration 
x Drug not taken as indicated eg, tablet dissolv ed in water when it should be taken as a 
solid tablet  
Clinical Study Protocol - 7.0 [COMPANY_008] 
AZD7442 - D8851C00001 
 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY86 of 115  x Drug not stored as instructed eg, kept in the fridge when it should be at room temperature  
x Wrong participant received the medi cation (excluding IRT/RTSM errors) 
x Wrong drug administered to  participant (excludi ng IRT/RTSM errors) 
 
Examples of events that do not  require reporting as  medication errors in clinical studies: 
x Errors related to or resulting from IRT/RTSM – including those which lead to one of the 
above listed events that would othe rwise have been a medication error  
x Participant accidentally missed drug dos e(s) eg, forgot to  take medication 
x Accidental overdose (will be captured as an overdose) 
x Participant failed to return unused  medication or empty packaging 
x Errors related to background and rescue medi cation, or standard of  care medication in 
open label studies, even if an [COMPANY_008] product  
 
Medication errors are not rega rded as AEs, but AEs may o ccur as a consequence of the 
medication error.

 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY87 of 115  Appendix C  Handling of Human Biological Samples 
C 1 Chain of Custody 
A full chain of custody is main tained for all samples thro ughout their life cycle. 
The investigator at each center keeps full traceab ility of collected biological samples from the 
participants while in storage at the center un til shipment or disposal (where appropriate) and 
records relevant processing information related to the samples while at the site. 
The sample receiver keeps full traceability of th e samples while in stor age and during use until 
used or disposed of or until further shipment an d keeps record of receipt of arrival and onward 
shipment or disposal. 
[COMPANY_008] or delegated representatives will ke ep oversight of the en tire life cycle through 
internal procedures, monitoring of study sites,  auditing or process checks, and contractual 
requirements of external  laboratory providers. 
Samples retained for further use will be stor ed in the [COMPANY_008]-assigned biobanks or other 
sample archive facilities and will be tracked by [CONTACT_198689]. 
If required, [COMPANY_008] will ensure that remaini ng biological samples are returned to the site 
according to local regulations or at the end of  the retention period, whichever is earlier. 
C 2 Withdrawal of Informed Consent for Donated Biological Samples  
[COMPANY_008] ensures that biological samples are re turned to the source or  destroyed at the end 
of a specified period, as descri bed in the informed consent. 
If a participant withdraws consen t to the use of donated biological samples, the samples will 
be disposed of/destroyed/repatriated, and the action documented. If samples are already 
analyzed, [COMPANY_008] is not obliged to destroy the results of this research. 
Following withdrawal of consent for biological samples, furthe r study participation should be 
considered in relation to the withdrawal pr ocesses outlined in the informed consent. 
The investigator: 
x Ensures participant’s withdraw al of informed consent to the use of donated samples is 
highlighted immediately to [COMPANY_008] or delegate. 
x Ensures that relevant human biological sample s from that participant, if stored at the 
study site, are immediately id entified, disposed of as appropriate, and the action 
documented.

 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY89 of 115  Appendix D  Actions Required in Cases of Incre ases in Liver Biochemistry 
and Evaluation of Hy’s Law 
D 1 Introduction 
This Appendix describes the process to be follo wed in order to identify and appropriately 
report Potential Hy’s Law (PHL) cases and HL case s. It is not intended to be a comprehensive 
guide to the management of el evated liver biochemistries.  
During the course of the study, the investigator  will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry. The investigator is responsible  for determining whethe r a participant meets 
potential PHL criteria at any point during the study. 
All sources of laboratory data are appropriate for the determin ation of PHL and HL events; 
this includes samples taken at scheduled study vis its and other visits, in cluding central and all 
local laboratory evaluations, even  if collected outside of the study visits; for example, PHL 
criteria could be met by [CONTACT_198690] a central laboratory and/or  elevated TBL from 
a local laboratory.  
The investigator will also review AE data (eg, for AEs that may indicate  elevations in liver 
biochemistry) for possible PHL events. 
The investigator particip ates, together with [COMPANY_008] clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases m eeting PHL criteria to agree whet her HL criteria are met. HL 
criteria are met if there is no alternative explanation for the elevations in liver biochemistry 
other than Drug Induced Liver In jury (DILI) caused by [CONTACT_2203].  
The investigator is responsi ble for recording data pertai ning to PHL/HL cases and for 
reporting SAEs and AEs according to the outcome of the review and asse ssment in line with 
standard safety re porting processes.

Clinical Study Protocol - 7.0 [COMPANY_008] 
AZD7442 - D8851C00001 
 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY90 of 115  same day) the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the 
elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur. 
D 3 Identification of Potential Hy’s Law Cases 
In order to identify cases of PHL it is impor tant to perform a comprehensive review of 
laboratory data for any participant who meets an y of the following identification criteria in 
isolation or in combination: 
x $/7  3 × ULN 
x $67  3 × ULN 
x 7%/  2 × ULN 
 
Central Laboratories Being Used: 
When a participant meets any of the PHL identification criteria, in  isolation or in combination, 
the central laboratory will immediately send an alert to the investigator (also sent to 
[COMPANY_008] representative).  
The investigator will also remain vigilant for any local laboratory reports where the PHL 
identification criteria are met; where th is is the case, the investigator will: 
x Notify the [COMPANY_008] representative 
x Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by [CONTACT_198691] 
x Complete the appropriate unscheduled laborator y eCRF module(s) with  the original local 
laboratory test result 
 
When the identification criter ia are met from central or local laboratory results, the 
investigator will, without delay: 
x Determine whether the particip ant meets PHL criteria (see Se ction D 2 for definition) by 
[CONTACT_198692] (inc luding both central and local 
laboratory results) 
 
If Local Laboratories Being Used: 
The investigator will, without  delay, review each new laboratory report and if the 
identification criteria are met, will: 
x Notify the [COMPANY_008] representative 
x Determine whether the particip ant meets PHL criteria (see S ection D 2 for definition) by 
[CONTACT_198693] - 7.0 [COMPANY_008] 
AZD7442 - D8851C00001 
 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY91 of 115  x Promptly enter the laboratory data into the laboratory eCRF 
 
D 4 Follow-up 
D 4.1  Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not met 
If the participant does not meet PHL criteria, the investigator will: 
x Inform the [COMPANY_008] representative that  the participant has not met PHL criteria 
x Perform follow-up on subsequent laboratory resu lts according to the guidance provided in 
the CSP 
 
D 4.2  Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met 
If the participant does meet PHL cr iteria, the investigator will: 
x Notify the [COMPANY_008] representative who w ill then inform the central Study Team  
x Within one day of PHL criteria being met, th e investigator will report the case as an SAE 
of Potential Hy’s Law; serious criteria  ‘Important medical event’ and causality 
assessment ‘yes/related’ according to CSP process for SAE reporting 
x For participants that met PHL criteria prior to starting IMP, the investigator is not 
required to submit a PHL SAE unless there is a significant change# in the participant’s 
condition 
x The Study Physician will contact [CONTACT_198694], discuss and agree 
an approach for the study pa rticipants’ follow-up (including any further laboratory 
testing), and the continuous review of data 
x Subsequent to this contac t the investigator will: 
 Monitor the participant until liver biochemist ry parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or ba seline levels, or as long as medically 
indicated. Completes follow-up SAE Form as required. 
 Investigate the etiology of the event and perform dia gnostic investigations as 
discussed with the Study Physician. This in cludes deciding which the tests available 
in the HL lab kit should be used.  
 Complete the 3 Liver eCRF Modules as information becomes available  
 
#A ‘significant’ change  in the participant’s condition refers  to a clinically relevant change 
in any of the individual liver bi ochemistry parameters (ALT, AST,  or TBL) in isolation or in 
combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms. The determination of 
whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the investigator; this 
may be in consultation with  the Study Physician if there is any uncertainty.

 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY92 of 115  D 5 Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases 
The instructions in this section should be foll owed for all cases where PHL criteria are met. 
As soon as possible after the biochemistry a bnormality was initially  detected, the Study 
Physician contacts the in vestigator in order to review av ailable data and agree on whether 
there is an alternative explan ation for meeting PHL criteria, other than DILI caused by [CONTACT_86184], to ensure timely analysis  and reporting to health authorities within [ADDRESS_237144] and TBL elevations, a 
determination of whether the alternative explanat ion is an AE will be made and subsequently 
whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE: 
x If the alternative explanation is not an AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate eCRF 
x If the alternative explanation is an AE/SAE: update the prev iously submitted Potential 
Hy’s Law SAE and AE eCRFs accordingly with  the new information (reassessing event 
term; causality and seriousness criteria) fo llowing the [COMPANY_008] standard processes. 
 
If it is agreed that there is no explanation that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP: 
x Send updated SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law ’) according to [COMPANY_008] standard 
processes.  
 The ‘Medically Important’ se rious criterion should be used if no other serious 
criteria apply 
 As there is no alternative explanation fo r the HL case, a causality assessment of 
‘related’ should be assigned. 
 
If, there is an unavoidable delay, of over 15 calendar days in obt aining the information 
necessary to assess whether or not  the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that 
there is no alternative explanat ion until such time as an in formed decision can be made: 
Clinical Study Protocol - 7.0 [COMPANY_008] 
AZD7442 - D8851C00001 
 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY93 of 115  x Provides any further update to the previous ly submitted SAE of Potential Hy’s Law, 
(report term now ‘Hy’s Law case’) ensuring cau sality assessment is related to IMP and 
seriousness criteria is medically important,  according to CSP process for SAE reporting. 
x Continue follow-up and review according to agreed plan. Once the necessary 
supplementary information is obtained, repeat  the review and assessment to determine 
whether HL criteria are still met. Update the previously submitted PHL SAE report 
following CSP process for SAE reporting, according to the outcome of the review and 
amending the reported term if  an alternative explanati on for the liver biochemistry 
elevations is determined.

increasingly to manage severe  COVID-[ADDRESS_237149] usually been treated in a 
traditional hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]. 
Please note that in the TACKLE  clinical study protocol, “hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” is defined as 
 24 hours of acute care, in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_198639], including emergency 
rooms or temporary facilities instituted to address medical needs of  those with severe 
COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
As hospi[INVESTIGATOR_198640] y and key secondary 
endpoints in the study, further guidance is pr ovided regarding what constitutes these 
temporary facility or altern ate care sites used for managing participants with severe 
COVID-19. 
For the purposes of ascertaining an exclusion cr iterion or an endpoint ev ent, individuals with 
severe COVID-19 will be considered “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]” if they are   
1 Managed in an alternative care site set up or authorized by [CONTACT_198695], pr ovinces or equivalent 
jurisdictions or  
2 Provided with acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_198641] 
(a) Physician determines the patient’s conditi on as being appropria te for “acute in-
patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]”  
(b) Treating physician should have appropriate screening protocols before care at home 
begins, to assess both medi cal and non-medical factor s, including patient’s 
preference, working utilities and assessment of physical barriers 
(c) Patients are evaluated daily either in pers on or remotely by a qua lified health care 
provider/treating physician, a nd are managed appropriately  based on the patient’s 
treatment plan and local sta ndards for COVID-19 management. 
 
The appropriate WHO Clinical Progression Scal e for COVID-19 score assigned to grade the 
participant’s condition would depend on the le vel of oxygen/ventilation support provided in 
these acute care settings. 
 
Clinical Study Protocol - 7.[ADDRESS_237150] at the beginning of  the pandemic, therefore, the sample size, 
the RRR and assumed incidence of severe COVID-19/death have been reassessed.  
Synopsis, Sections 1.2 (Schema), 4.1 (Overall Design), 9.4.1 (General Considerations), 
9.5 (Interim Analysis), [IP_ADDRESS] (Primary E ndpoint(s)), 9.6 (Data Safety Monitoring 
Board) and A5 (Committee Structure):  To reflect the change in primary analysis and 
resulting time change the inter im analysis has been removed.  
Synopsis and Section 4.1 (Overall Design):  To improve participant enrollment the total 
number of sites has been cha nged from ‘approximately 85 to 95 sites’ to ‘approximately 
130 to 140 sites’. 
Synopsis, Sections 4.1 (Overall Desi gn), 9.2 (Sample Size Determination) : As described 
above, sample size has been adjusted from "approx imately" 1700 participants to "up to 
approximately" 1700 participants, and the 95% power to detect  
 
 
Synopsis, Sections 4.1 (Overall Design), 9.1 (S tatistical Hypotheses ), 9.4 (Statistical 
Analyses), 9.4.1 (General Considerations ), [IP_ADDRESS] (Primary Endpoint(s)), Section 9.4.5 
(Methods for Multiple Testing Control ): As described above, th e primary analysis has 
been changed from ‘90 primary endpoint  events’ to ‘30 days after the 52nd primary endpoint 
event’. Furthermore, enrollm ent will stop after the 52nd event has occurred. 
Synopsis, Sections 4.1 (Overall Design) and 6.3.1 (Randomization): In order to ensure 
the high-risk proportion of participants of more than 60% is reached enrollment of low-risk 
participants has stopped. To ma ke this clear, the statement ‘The enrollment of low-risk 
participants has stopped’ ha s been added to the CSP.   
Table 1 (Schedule of Activities for Cohort 2) and Table 2 (Schedul e of Activities for 
Cohort 2):  Due to the overlap in visit windows fo r Day [ADDRESS_237151] be performed on different days. According to the exploratory 
endpoints, the household infection report is only required through Day 169, and therefore, 
its collection has been removed from Day 366. 
Section 8.2.4 (Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments) : Text added to confirm that sites CCI

Table 1 (Schedule of Activities for Cohort 1) and Table 2 (Schedul e of Activities for 
Cohort 2): Footnote updated to clarify that C OVID-[ADDRESS_237152] assessment is performed, rows labelled ‘ECG’ have been changed to 
‘Triplicate 12-lead ECG’. The Remote visit has been defined as either  a phone call or a 
web-based virtual assessment.  
To the symptom diary entry, the following f ootnote has been added:  ‘If Day 29 visit is 
conducted earlier in ± 4 day window, participan t should retain sympto m diary in order to 
complete required daily en tries through Study Day 29’. 
Table 2 (Schedule of Activities for Cohort 2):  A footnote has been added to the IMP 
administration to describe re quired safety monitoring. This had been previously omitted 
from the CSP text.  
Sections 4.1 (Overall Design), 5.1 (Inclusion  Criteria), 5.2 (Exclusion Criteria), 8.3.10 
(Pregnancy), [IP_ADDRESS] (Maternal Exposure), Table 1 (Schedule of Activities for Cohort 1) and Table 2 (Schedule of Activities for Cohort 2):  Based on the low-risk to pregnant or 
breast feeding women and the potential benefit pregnant women may receive from mAb 
treatment the exclusion Crite rion 16, excluding pregnant a nd breast feeding women has 
been removed and inclusion Criterion 8(b) has been amended to remove  the requirement for 
a negative pregnancy test. Pregna ncy has also been added to the list of high-risk factors that 
can lead to progression to severe COVID-19.  
Section 5.1 (Inclusion Criteria):  In response to health aut hority feedback recommending 
that a minimum score of > 0 on th e clinical progression scale is  not appropriate, Criterion 3 
has been changed from ‘WHO Clinical Progr ession Scale score > 0 and < 4’ to ‘WHO 
Clinical Progression Scale score > 1 and < 4’. 
Section 5.1 (Inclusion Criteria): To Criterion 4, the equivalent  Fahrenheit temperature has 
been added alongside Celsius.  
Section 5.1 (Inclusion Criteria):  To Criterion 8(a), condom use for male part icipants has 
been changed from ‘365 days following admin istration of IMP’ to ‘90 days following 
administration of IMP’. As the mAbs have no human target and feta l TCR studies showed 
no mAb presence the risk of transmission is low,  and therefore the number of days has been 
reduced to reflect approximately 1 half-life.  
Section 5.2 (Exclusion Criteria):  To ensure that individuals likely to receive a vaccine

from ‘Any prior receipt of investigational or  licensed vaccine or  other mAb/biologic 
indicated for the prevention of  SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 or expected receipt during the 
period of study follow-up’ to ‘A ny prior receipt of investigati onal or licensed vaccine or 
other mAb/biologic indicated fo r the prevention of SARS-CoV-2  or COVID-19 or expected 
administration immediately after enrollment’. 
Section 5.2 (Exclusion Criteria):  Criterion 5 language clar ified: ‘requirement for 
mechanical ventilation’ changed to ‘current  requirement for mechanical ventilation’. 
Table 5 (Summary of Permitted, Prohibited, or Restricted Medications):  To avoid 
confusion at study sites, the table has been  updated with the follo wing clarifications:

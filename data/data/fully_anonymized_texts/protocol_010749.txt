Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe and debilitating psychiatric illness.  While available treatment s benefit about 
50%-60% of patients, there is a sizeable group that does not respond adequately.  Bipolar depression often presents a 
very significant chall enge for clinical management as  treatment responses are often inadequate.  The pathophysiology  
of de pression is not agreed on  but there is evidence for contributions of neuroinflammation and disturbed brain 
arachidonic acid metabolism.  Furthermore, an increasing body of evidence documents a role for increased oxidative 
stress in brain neurons as a putat ive mechanism involved in neuronal damage and  possib ly in the pathophysiology of 
mood disorders.  Lithium and valproate, the most commonly used medications to treat BD, have been shown in pre -
clinical studies to have important effects on neuroinflammatory mechanisms, as well as oxidative stress pathways.   
The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) Celecoxib, a cyclo oxygenase type 2 ( COX -2) inhibitor, was shown 
to have possible effects in bipolar depression in a small double -blind controlled preliminar y study.  A controlled study 
testing the potential of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_526841].  A double -blind placebo -
controlled study also suggested  therapeutic effects of N -Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) for depressive symptoms in p atients 
with bipolar disorder.  Therefore, there is a compelling rationale for conducting a double -blind controlled trial to 
examine  the potential of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_526842] .  We propose to conduct a 16-week 
double -blind randomized placebo controlled trial with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (1000 mg qam, orally)  or NAC (1 000 mg bid, orally)  as 
add-on treatment s to mood stabiliz ing agents  in BD type I and II patients on a depressive or mixed epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  In 
addition to testing these treatments individually, w e will also randomly assign patients to a combination of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_526843], to examine the potential for synergistic effects from these two medications .  We will ut ilize a novel  drop -the-
loser (DTL) adaptive clinical trial design  that is more cost -effective to screen medication leads.  . This study will 
investigate the role of inflammatory mechanisms  and oxidative stress  in antidepressant response and could lead to the 
development of new and crit ically needed treatment modalities  for BD patients.

3 Introductio n and Background  
 
 Bipolar disorder (BD) is a major health problem (lifetime prevalence about 1.5%) and causes significant 
morbidity and burden to society.  Available treatments help a substantial proportion of patients but are not beneficial 
for an estima ted 40% -50% [1, 2] .  Lithium has been the standard treatment for BD over many years [3, 4] , but  may 
have  significant side effects and not be efficacious in 50 -60%.  Over the past  two decade s, several  alternatives have 
been developed [1, 5 -9] [10, 11] [12-19].  Nonetheless, t here still is considerable need for better treatments and 
understanding of disease and drug mechanisms  involved [20, 21] , as disabil ity and functional impairment ar e still 
widespread amongst individuals suffering from BD .   
Although the exact pathophysiology of BD and particularly of bipolar depression is unknown, evidence suggests 
important contributions of neuroinflammation associated with upregulated bra in arachid onic acid (AA ) metabolism [22, 
23].  Clinical studies support the idea that BD and depression involve a brain inflammatory response and disturbed AA 
metabolism [24-27].  Incr eased levels of PGE 2 are present in platelets, saliva, and CSF of depressed patients [28-32].  
In addition, increased blood levels of proinflammatory markers, particularly  C-reactive protein, soluble interleukin (IL )-2 
receptor, IL -6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha, have been reported in BD mania [33], as have increased blood 
levels of markers of oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase activity  and catalase activity, seru m thiobarbituric acid 
reactive substances (TBARS) ) [34] [35]. 
In vivo rodent [36-40] and human studies [41] suggest that  the inhibition of AA metabolism and the COX -[ADDRESS_683607] may be  a common mechanism of action of mood -stabilizing drugs [22, 23] .  With previous support from the 
Stanley Medical Research Institute (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_526844]), w e completed a first double -blind controlled trial with celecoxib , a 
selective inhibitor of COX -2, as adjunctive treatment for bipolar depression and found a non -significant but potentially 
clinically meaningful effect for an early, but not sustained therapeutic response  [42].  Together, these preclinical and 
clinical findings provide strong evidence that increased COX -[ADDRESS_683608] for 
antidepr essant response and mood stabilization.   
 Another NSAID known to target AA metabolism is aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], which is commonly used to treat peripheral 
inflammation and fever. Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]'s effects are believed to be due to decreased production of pro -inflammatory 
prost aglandins (PGs) and thromboxanes (TXBs), due to inhibition of COX enzymes [43].  However, an additional 
antiinflammatory mechanism recently was proposed. Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_526845] -2, and the acetylated enzyme can 
convert DHA to 17 -OH-DHA, an antiinflammatory agent that is a precursor of anti -inflammatory resolvins [44].  In this 
regard, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_526846] a synergistic interaction with lithium, which was shown to increase the brain con centration of 
17-OH-DHA and reduce brain concentrations of proinflammatory PGE2 and TXB2 in a rat neuroinflammation model 
[45].  
Preliminary  clinical studies suggest a therapeutic effect of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_526847] .  One study reported that 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_526848] [46].  A retrospective clinical 
pharmacoepi[INVESTIGATOR_526849] [47].  Additionally, a randomized d ouble blind placebo -controlled trial reported that adjuvant aspi[INVESTIGATOR_205335] (1000 mg/day, 12 -weeks) reduced symptoms of schizophrenia spectrum disorders, in which 
neuroinflammation likely plays a role [48, 49] .  
Increased oxidative stress may be involved in pat hophysiology of mood disorders [50]. Glutathione is a key 
substrate for antioxidant functions in cells.  Its production is limited by [CONTACT_526875], cysteine.  N-Acetyl Cysteine 
(NAC ) is the acetylated derivative of cysteine.  It is more bioavailable.  NAC has been shown to be neuroprotective  
[51].  If abnormalities in oxidative stress are key mechanisms involved in pathophysiology of mood disorders , it is 
compelling to hypothesize that effective antioxidant drugs will have effects in alleviating the symptoms or changing the 
course of the illness.  Lithium and valproate have been shown to have important effects on glutathione -mediated 
processes [52].  In a clinical trial, lithium was shown to have effects on markers of  oxidative stress  in patients with 
bipolar disorder in the manic state [53].  Berk et al  [54] reported a [ADDRESS_683609] to ongoing mood stabilizing me dications in patients suffering from BD where there were significant effects 
on depressive symptoms. Recently, results of an open label study also revealed  positive results on bipolar depression 
during a two month extension period  [55]. Furthermore, these same authors demonstrated effects of NAC on certain 
symptomatic domains in patients with schizophrenia, primarily on negative symptoms  [56]. 
In view of these compelling preclinical and clinical observations, a study to test whether aspi[INVESTIGATOR_526850].  Our study w ill include measurements of cytokines , 
inflammatory factors  and markers of oxidative stress  at ba seline , at [ADDRESS_683610] the hypothesis that aspi[INVESTIGATOR_526851], by [CONTACT_526876], will be  beneficial in treating depression in bipolar disorder patients and in 
promoting mood stabilization.  We propose to utilize a novel drop -the-loser (DTL)  adaptive design that will be more 
cost-effective in screening new medica tion leads.   
Our study has the following Aims: Aim I  – Examine efficacy of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_526852] 
a double -blind placebo -controlled add -on design;  Aim II  – Examine efficacy of NAC in treating depression in bipolar 
patients i n a double -blind placebo -controlled add -on design ; Aim II I – Examine efficacy of combined treatment with 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_526853], potentiating effects ; Aim I V – Examine the role of markers of 
neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and cytokine s as possible mediators or modulators  in therapeutic response in the 
treatment of depression in patients with BD . 
 
Need for efficient drug development studies  
 
Most conventional, medication -development trials in psychiatry have employed standard, fixed, p arallel -group 
designs, involving only a few drug conditions and very large sample sizes.  Trials designed in this manner have been 
criticized for being exceedingly long, expensive, and often uninformative if initial drug or dose s election proved to be 
incorrect.  Two ways in which the clinical trial enterprise may be enhanced are the implementation of adaptive clinical 
trial designs and the application of Bayesian statistical approaches in monitoring and analyzing clinical trials [57, 58] .   
Adaptive designs permit critical mid -trial design modifications, based on interim analyses, without undermining 
the validity and integrity of the trial [59].  Adaptations to the trial are pre -specified (by [CONTACT_8345]); not made in an 
unplanned or ad hoc manner.  These adaptations are aimed at providing ( 1) better treatment of patients by [CONTACT_526877] -effective drugs or drug combinations and increasing exposure to more effective drugs or drug 
combinations; (2) more efficient drug development; and (3) better use of available resources.  
A drop -the-loser (DTL) adaptive design is useful in phase II clinical development especially when there are 
uncertainties regarding the most promising drug to which Phase III resources should ultimately be allocated [60, 61] .  
DTL designs permit multiple treatment arms allowing for the rapid assessment of candidate drugs or drug 
combinations.  An interim analysis plan specifies the criteria for droppi[INVESTIGATOR_526854]. Con ditions satisfying interim efficacy criteria are continued to completion. This adaptive pruning 
permits the randomization of remaining participants to the drug condition(s) which demonstrate the most promise.  As 
a consequence, adaptive DTL designs permit initial evaluation of a broader range of drugs or drug combinations 
followed by [CONTACT_526878](s).  
The recommended analysis strategy when using adaptive trials is Bayesian  [57]  which permits statements 
about the probability that treatment confers benefit.   This probability is calculated by [CONTACT_526879], 
SOARES, JC  
[ADDRESS_683611] size can be made.  As treatment outcomes 
accumulate over the course of the trial, posterior probabilities are used to estimate treatment effects and inform the 
pruning of less effective treatments based on a priori decision rules.    
Designing an adaptive trial typi[INVESTIGATOR_526855] a simulation study to address issues such as timing and 
frequency of interim analyses, and to understand the operating characteristics associated with the criteria for droppi[INVESTIGATOR_15889] [57].  In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_526856], a Monte Carlo simulation study was conducted  (see 
Statistica l Analyses)  to assess the relative merits of this design over a non -adaptive parallel -group approach.  
Simulation results, support the proposed DTL design in showing that under scenarios reflecting the hypothesized 
treatment effects, the adaptive design al locates more subjects to the more promising treatment conditions, i.e., 
appropriate “pruning” of less effective conditions. Using simulated data, the design performs well as demonstrated by 
[CONTACT_526880] I error rates. Thus, employing the propose d DTL design is likely to yield the same 
conclusions as the classical fixed (non -adaptive) design, but with greater statistical precision for the most promising 
treatments.  
Study Design

We have set our inclusion criteria to allow maximal generalizability of the results to the  aggregate group of patients 
with BD treated in common outpatient settings, so we will allow inclusion of patients with co -morbid conditions, 
substance abuse, and bipolar type II.  The feasibility of the proposed study is facilitated by [CONTACT_478529] T exas 
(UT) Center of Excellence on Mood Disorders , co-directed by [CONTACT_6283]. Jair C. Soares and Alan Swann .  Our group has  
SOARES, JC  
[ADDRESS_683612] of enrolling BD patients for a multitude of clinical neuroscience and clinical 
psychopharmacology studies.  
Stud y procedures:  
 
The study will be carried out at the  outpatient clinics affiliated with the  UT Health Science Center at Houston.  
After signing informed consent, p atients will be submitted initially to a SCID -I interview to confirm the psychiatric 
diagnosis , followed by a physical examination and routine labs (CBC, liver function tests, electrolytes, kidney functions 
tests, thyroid function tests, urinalyses) to rule out relevant medical problems.  Physically healthy BD patients on 
psychotropic medications o r combinations will be enrolled and randomly assigned to  receive, orally,  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 1000 mg 
qam, NAC 1 000 mg bid, combination of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 1000 mg  qam and NAC 1000 mg bid,  or placebo.  The aspi[INVESTIGATOR_526858] 1000 mg q day , and will remain the same  for 8  weeks.  NAC will be administered in 500 mg capsules, 
two capsules p.o bid an d dose will remain the same for  the duration of the study.  Patients can be on any mood 
stabilizing agents or combinations, as well as on other psychotropic medications at s tudy entry, and the doses of those 
medications cannot  be changed during the trial.  They cannot be on any anti -inflammatory  or anti -oxidant  agents or 
anticoagulant at the point they are enrolled.  If patients decompensate significantly, and/or become acute ly suicidal, 
participation on the trial will be terminated.  
If patients qualify for the study initially based on SCID -I interview, physical examination, and routine labs (CBC, 
liver functions tests, electrolytes, kidney function tests, thyroid function tes ts, HIV testing,  and urinalyses), but are not 
currently taking an approved psychotropic medication or combinations they are eligible to participate in a lead -in 
phase. This phase would be starting at their screening visit and last approximately 6 to 8 week s depending on the 
patient’s mood. During this lead -in phase, either the PI [INVESTIGATOR_12749] -PI [INVESTIGATOR_526859]. The patient will be monitored during this treatment phase by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_12749] -PI [INVESTIGATOR_526860]. The evaluation will include CSSR -S and adverse effects. If the patient is prescribed lithium, 
their lithium levels will be tested. The patient will continue to follow up every two weeks. At the 4 week visit, the patient  
will also c ome in for evaluation (CSSR -S and adverse effects). At the [ADDRESS_683613] 4 
weeks and score greater th an 20 on the Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), then they will be 
enrolled. If they do not meet inclusion criteria at the week 6 lead -in phase visit, they will return at Week 8 and be re -
evaluated. PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706] -PI [INVESTIGATOR_526861] e psychotropic medication throughout the lead -in phase (up to 8 
weeks) and through the trial (up to 16 weeks).  
 
During the lead -in phase participants will not be compensated. They will receive a voucher for their parking for 
each visit. They will be respo nsible for filling and paying for all prescriptions in both the lead -in phase and through the 
trial (up to 16 weeks).  
Upon completion of the  first 8-week double -blind trial, patients who responded to the active medication  will 
continued on the same study d rug for an additional [ADDRESS_683614] 50%.     
 During the  first 8-week trial, patients will b e seen at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8  for clinical assessment and mood 
ratings.  During the continuation trial , they wi ll be seen at weeks 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 .  The main outcome measure for 
the study will be the scores on the Montgomery -Asberg  Depression  Rating Scale, MADRAS [62].  All patients will also 
be assessed with the Young Mania Rating Scale, YMRS  [63], the Clinical Global Impression -Bipolar version, C GI-BP 
[64], and the [LOCATION_006]U side -effects scale [65].  In all visits, patients will be seen by [CONTACT_526881], YMRS, CGI -BD, and the [LOCATION_006]U side -effects scale.   
At baseline (before randomization), week 8 and week 16 blood will be sampled for proinflammatory markers (C -
reactive protein, soluble interleukin (IL) -2 receptor, IL -6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha), and oxidative stress 
SOARES, JC  
8 markers (superoxide dismutase activity and catalase activity, serum thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)), 
which have been reported to be elevated in  BD patients [34] [33] [35]. These blood samples will be stored for possible 
future research on biomarkers or future genetic studies for up to 20 years, for use in pharmacogenetic research during 
this 20 year timeframe.  The samples  will be store d at the Wet Lab , in a double locked -80 degrees freezer, at  |||||  |||||

of the patient and more Lithium level tests can be ordered under the PI’s discretion throughout the 16 week trial.  
 
   Safety considerations:  
 
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] i s a safe medicati on for administration to humans  and is approved by [CONTACT_526882] -inflammatory 
and analgesic agent.  The dose propo sed for this study is within the safety range as per medication package.  Its side -
effect profile is overall very favorable and it has met widespread use worldwide over the past decades.  The main 
safety issues relate to the possibility of gastrointestinal  complications , which are rare  (and will be closely monitored in 
the weekly or biweekly visits that the study requires) , and the propensity to interfere with coagulation and cause 
consequent bleeding  (which will be prevented by [CONTACT_526883]) .  There were a few case reports and small case series with other non -steroidal anti -inflammatory 
agents suggesting worsening of depressive symptoms related to treatment (e.g., indomethacin, ibuprofen , naproxen), 
but those were  uncontrolled reports with  individuals who suffered from other medical illnesses (rheumatologic 
diseases) [66] [67]. For our proposed trial, because some patients may be on lithium at the time they start on aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], 
we will exclude individuals with pre -existing cardiac and kidney disease.  For patients on lithium, we will carefully 
monitor their serum lithium l evels every two weeks during the course of the trial.  Therefore, at the doses that are 
being proposed we do not anticipate any significant problems related to safety of the proposed intervention.  
NAC is a safe compound that is commonly available and utili zed over -the-counter.  In a recent study [54] the 
tolerability was excellent and main side effec ts included changes in energy level, headaches, heartburn and joint pain.  
        
       Blood Draws:  When the blood is drawn, there may be some minimal discomfort and/or bruising.  Infection, 
excess bleeding, clotting, or fainting is also possible, althou gh unlikely.  All usual precautions will be taken to prevent 
these possibilities and these risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_526884].  
 
        Women Able to Become Pregnant:   Participation in this study may involve risks to an embryo, fet us, or unborn 
child.  If the subject is a  female and able to become pregnant, a urine pregnancy test will be performed which must 
be negative prior to e nrolling into the study, and the subject  must agree not to become pregnant during the stud y.  
Urine pregnancy tests will be performed at Screening visit and week 8.  The study staff will review adequate birth 
control method s with the  subject and will remind her  that she should not become pregnant during the study.  
Appropriate methods of birth control include: hormonal contraceptives (such as birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], patches, and 
implants), barrier methods (such as a condom and diaphragms and spermicidal foam or jelly, surgical (hysterectomy 
or tubal ligation) or  intrauterine device (IUD). The subje ct will be instructed to notify the study doctor immediate ly if 
there is a chance that she has  become pregnant.  
Also, if the subject is  breast -feeding an infant or plan on breast -feeding an infant, she must  notify the study doctor.  It 
is not known if this  drug is excreted in human milk; therefore, breast -feeding is not permitted during the study.

9        Breach of Confidentiality : Every effort will be made to protect the subject identity and information during the 
study. All lab work and scan reports will be de -identified and the medical records will be protected. However, there is 
a small chance that the subject information may be viewed by [CONTACT_526885].  
The study drug must be taken only by [CONTACT_526886] b een prescribed, and it must be kept out of the 
reach of children or persons of limited capacity to read or understand.  
        By [CONTACT_526887], there is a risk of the possible loss of the subject privacy. Although 
no identifiab le (name, address, etc.) information will be shared with others outside of this research project.  The 
clinical information obtained from subjects will be part of their medical records and maintained at UT Center of 
Excellence on Mood Disorders, in the Depa rtment of Psychiatry at UTHSC -H, in facilities with adequate safeguards 
for the protection of confidentiality. The research data will be collected and recorded using only arbitrary code 
numbers for identification, in order to safeguard the confidentiality.  All data will be kept in a secure area. Only the 
members of the UT Center of Excellence on Mood Disorders research group, who will get approval from CPHS, will 
have access to the data files, or to the master list for the codes. For publications purposes, the patients will be 
designated only by [CONTACT_526888].

Simulation  Study  
In preparation of this application we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation study to assess the relative merits of 
the proposed DTL adaptive design over a non -adaptive, parallel -group approach.  Specifically, the goal of this study 
was to demonstrate t hat the DTL design would result in the maximum number of subjects being treated in the most 
promising conditions, i.e., appropriate “pruning” of less effective conditions.  Simulation scenarios including one that 
posits no effect across conditions and othe rs, assuming specific anticipated effects, permits evaluation of Type I and 
Type II Error rates respectively.  Sample size for each simulated trial was set at n = 160.  Response to treatment was 
defined, dichotomously, as > 50% decrease in depression score  as measured on the MADRS.  Specification of effects 
for the simulations assumed that the rate of response in the placebo condition is 25%, while [ADDRESS_683616] comparable effects with response rates of 50% each.  The combinati on of [ADDRESS_683617] yielding a 70% response rate.  At 50% 
information gathering, defined as n = 80 subjects having completed the study, a Bayesian interim analysis determined 
the pos terior probability that treatment conferred benefit.  Benefit was defined as the absolute difference in response 
rate for each treatment relative to placebo. The remaining 80 subjects were allocated to the retained (non -pruned) 
treatments, with the probabi lity of assignment to any given group based on the number of groups continuing in the 
study.   
Pruning/Retention Rules.  Simulation scenarios considered a variety of pruning rules that varied in stringency for 
1) detecting a clinically decisive difference (>10% from placebo), and 2) selecting the best performing treatment.  All 
simulations assumed a ~Beta(1,1) prior distribution for the probability of treatment response in all study conditions.  A 
Beta(1,1) prior models values within the range [0,1] in whic h all values have the same probability of occurring.  This 
constitutes a vague, neutral prior distribution which reflects uncertainty preceding data accrual.  At 50% of data 
gathering (n = 80) the prior (i.e. ~Beta(1,1)) was updated with data generated fro m a binomial distribution for each 
SOARES, JC  
10 condition.  The posterior distributions of the differences between each treatment and placebo formed the basis of 
pruning decisions.  A decisive difference is defined as occurring if the posterior probability of there bei ng a <10% 
difference between any of the treatments and placebo was < 0.20.  Another way of saying this is that if there was a 
>80% chance that the all treatment -placebo differences were <10% then the simulation concluded that the trial had 
failed to find a  decisive difference.  If this first rule identified the existence of a decisive difference for any of the 
treatments, the algorithm then selected the treatment that had the highest posterior probability of conferring benefit 
(i.e. the p(treatment -control > 0|data) for participants.  If the algorithm failed to identify a decisive treatment difference, 
the [ADDRESS_683618] -performing conditions and for Type I 
and Type II Error rates are reported for the design under these retention/pruning criteria.  
Simulation of Pruning/Retention Rules.  Simulation evaluated the pruning rules for three scenarios. Scenario1 
simulated clinical trials with binomial probabilities of response of 0.25, 0.50, 0.50, and 0.70 fo r placebo, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], NAC 
and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] + NAC respectively. Scenario [ADDRESS_683619] sizes are less optimistic. 
Scenario 2 posited binomial probabilities of response of 0.25, 0.30, 0.30, and 0.50 for placebo, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], NAC and 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] + NAC respectively.  Scenario 3 simulated clinical trials with binomial probabilities of response of 0.25, 0.25, 
0.25 and 0.25 for placebo, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], NAC and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] + NAC respectively.  Since this last scenario simulates data in 
which there is no effec t, the probability of identifying a decisive effect is an estimate of the Type I Error Rate for the 
pruning algorithm.  
Simulation of Operating Characteristics.  Although Bayesian statistical approaches offer a more efficient means 
by [CONTACT_526890] e, it is still essential to estimate the probability of making specific types of errors using the 
current design.  We first evaluate d, over the course of k = [ADDRESS_683620].  This yields the equivalent of the Type II Error Rate, with one minus this value 
corresponding to the power of the design.  For Scenario 1, k=200 simulated clinical trials indicated that the probability 
of identifying a decisive difference was >99% .  Including trials for which the algorithm failed to identify a decisive 
difference as Type II Errors, the selection of the best performing treatment based on the highest posterior probability 
of benefit identified the combination 82.5% of the time.  For Scenario 2, k=200 simulations suggested that the 
probability of identifying a decisive difference was 98.5%.  Counting trials for which the algorithm failed to identify a 
decisive difference as Type II Errors the selection of the best performing treatment based on the highest posterior 
probability of benefit identified the aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] + NAC combination 83% of the time.  This corresponds to 84.5% power.  
Since Scenario [ADDRESS_683621] in >0.5% of 
simulated trials.  This corresponds to a Type I Error Rate of 0.005.  
If N = 160 participants are randomized across four conditi ons in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, contrasts for treatment response 
rates versus placebo will use n = 40 participants per cell.  For Scenario 1, assuming n = 40 per group and alpha = 
0.05, power to detect the difference between the proportions 0.25 and 0.50 is 65%.  Using the same assumptions 
power to detect the difference between the proportions 0.25 and 0.70 is >99%.  For Scenario 2, assuming n = 40 per 
group and alpha = 0.05, power to detect the difference between 0.25 and 0.5 is 65%.  More generally, for compariso n 
of two independent proportions, sample sizes of n = 40 per group and alpha = 0.05 provide 80% power to detect a 
difference between 0.[ADDRESS_683622] promising treatment and placebo each receive an average of n = 60 participants.  (This is substantiated 
by [CONTACT_526891]).  Assuming n = 60  participants per group and alpha = 0.05, power to detect the difference 
between 0.25 and 0.50 is 81.80%, while power to detect the difference b etween 0.25 and 0.70 is > 99%. More 
generally, a sample of this size provide 80% power to detect the difference between 0.25 and 0.49 with alpha = 0.05.

11 In summary, a Bayesian adaptive approach demonstrates adequate operating characteristics (Type I and II 
Error Rates) for the current trial.  The method results in allocation of more participants to the most  effectiv e condition.  
Finally, the approach permits frequent  analyses with more desirable Type I and Type II Error rates.   
 
General Data Analytic Strategies  
 
All statistical analyses will use SAS v. 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, N.C.) .  Preliminary data analyses  inspecting 
group differences on demographic and baseline variables will evaluate posterior distributions for differences in 
proportions and means, as well as for correlations between baseline variables and specified outcomes.  Baseline or 
demographic vari ables for which the posterior distribution indicates there is > 99% chance of a difference across 
groups, and for which there is a > 99% chance of a non -zero correlation with outcomes, will be defined as potential 
confounders and will result in two sets of  analyses:  one in which the relevant variable is included as a covariate and 
one in which it is not.  This will permit determination of the degree to which any group differences might confound 
conclusions regarding treatment.  
Evaluation of the primary out come, proportion of patients demonstrating > 50% decrease in depression scores 
on the MADRS, as a function of treatment will use a beta -binomial model and contingency tables with chi -square 
testing for Bayesian and Frequentist approaches respectively.  Add itional analyses will use the generalized linear 
modeling.  Count, dichotomous and continuous Bayesian analyses will be conducted using Poisson (Proc GENMOD; 
SAS 9.2), logistic (Proc GENMOD; SAS 9.2), linear (Proc GENMOD; SAS 9.2) regression respectively.  Distributional 
assumptions will be evaluated via inspection of residual plots and, where possible, by [CONTACT_526892].  Violation 
of assumptions will be addressed, depending upon statistical technique, through the use of transformations, robust 
methods, and stratification.  
Unless otherwise indicated in the data analytic plan, priors will be specified as neutral and diffuse.  The beta -
binomial model will use a ~Beta(1,1) prior distribution.  For linear, Poisson, and logistic regression, priors will  take the 
form ~N(0, 1 x 106) in the linear, log, and log(odds) scales respectively.  Convergence of Bayesian analyses on the 
posterior distributions via Monte -Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) will be assessed via graphical (Trace Plot, 
Autocorrelation Plot) and quantitative (Geweke Diagnostics, Gelman -Rubin Diagnostics, and Heidelberger -Welsh 
Diagnostics) evidence.  Evaluation of posterior distributions will permit statements regarding the probability that effects 
of varying magnitudes exist, given the data.  
Interim Bayesian analysis with application of pruning/retention rules will be conducted when 50% of randomized 
subjects have reached (or should have reached) the end of study.   If, at 50% of data gathering, there are additional 
participants continuing in acti ve treatments that might be pruned, sensitivity analyses will inspect the degree to which 
potential results from these active patients might alter the conclusions of the interim analysis.  If necessary, 
randomization will be temporarily suspended and data gathering will continue until sensitivity analyses demonstrate 
that statistical conclusions will remain unchanged by [CONTACT_526893].   While 
Frequentist approaches require adjustment for multiple testing when conducting i nterim analyses, no such adjustment 
is necessary for Bayesian analyses due to its conformity to the likelihood principle [57].  Futher, Monte Carlo 
simulations (conducted in SAS v. 9.2) demonstrate that Type I and Type II Error Rates are at appropriate levels for the 
proposed design (see Simulation Study).  Intention to tr eat principles will apply at both the interim and final analysis 
points; any patients having dropped out of the study will be counted as non -responders.  
Structural Equation Modeling/Path Analysis will evaluate the degree to which inflammatory cytokines and  
markers of oxidative stress mediate the effect of treatment on MADRAS.  Estimation of SEM/Path Models will employ 
both Frequentist and Bayesian approaches.  In the context of the direct effects of treatment, mediational modeling will 
permit estimates of t he indirect effects of treatment on MADRAS scores via inflammatory cytokines or markers of 
oxidative stress using the product coefficient method [68].  Frequentist ninety -five percent confidence intervals for 
maximum likelihood estimates will be constructed using a bootstrap resampling approach [69].  Bayesian SEM 
estimates for indirect effects will employ the posterior distribution of the product coefficient.  All SEM/Path analys es will 
be conducted in MPlus v. 6.0 [70].

12 Significance : 
 This study will be the first controlled trial to test the efficacy of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_526862], compound s with potentially n ew 
mechanism s of central action in the treatment of BD patients on a depressive or mixed epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. It will test an 
innovative clinical trial design that we hope will make screening of possible new medication leads and these trials 
more cost efficient.  It will examine possible  novel mechanism of action s with modulation of inflammatory mechanisms 
and oxidative stress  and could result in the development of novel , low cost, safe and widely available treatment s for 
BD patients who have not responded to other comm only utilized alternatives .

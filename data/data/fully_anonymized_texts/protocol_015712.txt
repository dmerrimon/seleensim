Page [ADDRESS_81227] all large U.S. municipal jails, do not offer these treatments. 7 However, in  [LOCATION_001] City 
(NYC), jail -to-community methadone treatment is , since 1986, a well -studied standard -of-care, yet many 
inmates eligible to initiate the methadone treatment program (MTP) while incarcerated do not, possibly due 
to anti -methadone patient prefe rences. 8,9,10,[ADDRESS_81228], remain in jail for brief periods out -of-treatment while ‘drug free’ 
and undergoing a decline in physiologic opi[INVESTIGATOR_74433], nearl y universally relapse to heroin or other illicit 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_74434],  and are re -arrested in the next 12 months at rates of 50 -75%. 9,11 Extended -
release naltrexone (XR -NTX, Vivitrol), FDA -approved for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561], produces a [ADDRESS_81229] blockade, a nd offers a potentially promising modality for ‘inoculating’ persons leaving 
jails against immediate opi[INVESTIGATOR_74435].  Persons injected with 380mg of XR -NTX are unable to effectively 
experience euphoria or respi[INVESTIGATOR_74436] [ADDRESS_81230] or 
behavioral treat ments, or, resume a significantly postponed relapse to illicit use.  Our team recently 
established the feasibility of administering XR -NTX to opi[INVESTIGATOR_74437] a week of release in 
NYC jails. 13  We are now conducting  a large  randomized controlled trial estimating the effectiveness of XR -
NTX as opi[INVESTIGATOR_74438]. an enhanced 
treatment -as-usual (ETAU) condition receiving counseling and referral s only.  We also will recruit a non -
randomized, quasi -experimental methadone maintenance  treatment  program (MTP)  cohort followed for a 
naturalistic comparison of XR -NTX to  a jail -based methadone standard -of-care. Similar to the randomized 
treatment arms, the MTP  cohort will also receive enh anced counseling and referrals.  
 
Specific Aim 1 : Randomized Effectiveness Trial of XR -NTX vs. ETAU  for Jail -to-Community Re -Entry Opi[INVESTIGATOR_74439].  Our primary aim is to compare time -to-relapse among participants treated with XR -
NTX vs. randomized ETAU  controls, following release from jail.  
Specific Aim 2 : Quasi -Experimental Comparison of XR -NTX vs. a Methadone Treatment Program (MTP) for 
Re-Entry Opi[INVESTIGATOR_74440]. To compare time -to-relapse among the XR -NTX RCT arm vs. jail -
based MTP  participants using a quasi -experimental design.   
Specific Aim 3a -e: Related Opi[INVESTIGATOR_74441] .  To compare re -entry rates of 5 treatment 
outcomes across all arms: 3a) retention in any study or community opi[INVESTIGATOR_74442] , 3b) any opi[INVESTIGATOR_74443], defined as continuous counts of both days, amount/day, and urine 
toxicologies, 3c) injection drug use and HIV sexual risk factors, 3d) accidental drug overdose and mortality, 
and, 3e) rates of re -incarceration and an exploratory analysis of cost -effectiveness.  
 
This study is a  NIH/NIDA -funded  randomized trial of XR -NTX (n= 85) vs. ETAU  (n=85) among opi[INVESTIGATOR_74444].  Initiating treatment the week 
prior to release and continuing for [ADDRESS_81231] -release, we hypothesize the XR -NTX arm will 
demonstrate significantly longer time -to-relapse vs. ETAU . In parallel, we will recruit a matched, quasi -
experimental methadone cohort (n= 85), which will result in a naturalistic comparison of XR -NTX vs. an 
established jail -based MTP standard -of-care.

1.1 The NIDA Studies of Medication for Addiction Treatment in Correctional Settings (SOMATICS) 
U01 Collaborative  
 
 Our distinct NIH -funded study at NYU has been aligned with two other jail -based opi[INVESTIGATOR_74445] (FRI) in Baltimore, MD, and at UCLA.  Led 
by [CONTACT_74553], Redonna Chandler, PhD, SO MATICS seeks to harmonize assessments and 
interventions across 3 research centers (RCs) and the [ADDRESS_81232] their own individual trial, sharing one study arm wi th another RC, and several core 
assessments across all sites.  The SOMATIC Statistical Analysis Plan and common DSMP including a 
single DSMB are described in the Appendix.   
 
In brief, the individ ual study designs are : 
FRI: This is a 3 -group randomized clinical trial in which 300 opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -dependent adults (150 males and 
150 females) being treated for opi[INVESTIGATOR_74446]: (1) interim methadone with patient navigation  (IM+PN); (2) IM without Patient Navigation (IM 
alone); (3) or brief methadone detoxification with drug education/overdose prevention which constitutes an 
enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU)  condition . Participants will be assessed at baseline, and 1 -, 3-, 6-, and 
Protocol v3.6  X.O.R. : Extended -Release Naltrexone Opi[INVESTIGATOR_74427]-entry  
 
Page [ADDRESS_81233] -release to determine: entry and retention in treatment post -release; illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_74447]; DSM -V criteria for opi[INVESTIGATOR_74448]; criminal behavior, arrests, incarceration, and 
changes in HIV risk behavior. A cost-effectiveness  and cost -benefits analysis will be conducted to provide 
policymakers with data needed for evidence -based decision making.  
UCLA : Opi[INVESTIGATOR_74449] (N=150) in the Albuquerque , NM, municipal jail will be 
randomly assigned to a 6 -month intervention condition of XR-NTX (n=50), XR-NTX + Patient Navigation 
(N=50), and ETAU  (n=50); all participants will also be provided a toll -free number that will help them locate 
psychosocial treatment in the community. In addition to bi -weekly urine t ests and medical management 
during the [ADDRESS_81234] release will be assessed 
with bi -weekly urine toxicology tests and self -report use measures during the 24 week treatment phase of 
the trial for the purposes of assessing a time -to-relapse primary outcome for this individual study.  
Outcomes include opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (and use of other substances ), meeting DSM -5 criteria for opi[INVESTIGATOR_74450] 24 weeks (the primary SOMATICS outcome), criminal activity, and economic benefits associated with the 
three conditions. The cost analysis will measure and value resources associated with XR-NTX, includin g 
medical personnel (physician/nurses), labs, and medications. To ascertain cost -effectiveness ratios of XR-
NTX and XR-NTX + PN, cost data will be compared to changes in key clinical measures of effectiveness.  
NYU: As described above, a  randomized clinical  trial of extended -release naltrexone (XR -NTX) 
(n=85) vs. a no medication, enhanced treatment -as-usual (ETAU) condition (n=85 ), with an additional quasi -
experimental methadone maintenance  treatment program  (MTP) cohort (n=85) , followed for a time-to-
relapse primary outcome .  
 
2.0 Study Timeline:  An NIDA notice of grant award was issued on May 21, 2013, award number: U01 -
DA033336.   We have now completed the  start-up phase during which we completed  protocol approval, 
hired study personnel, assemble d study supplies including a free study drug contract with Alkermes, and 
complete d local SOPs. Recruitment of [ADDRESS_81235] over 3.5 
years, or approximately 5-7 participants randomized  (3-[ADDRESS_81236]; 2 -3 IM 
observational participants) every 4 weeks and followed for 29 weeks, for a maximum of 42 participants 
active  in study treatment  per month.  The final 6 months of Year 4 will be devoted to the tail end of study 
visits, data cleaning and analysis, study close out, preparation of initial manuscripts, and dissemination and 
national presentations of results.  
 
 
 
 
Protocol v3.6  X.O.R. : Extended -Release Naltrexone Opi[INVESTIGATOR_74427]-entry  
 
Page [ADDRESS_81237] persons are awaiting trial and not convicted 
of a crime (detainees) or serving a brief sentence (misdemeanor conviction), as opposed to persons 
incarcerated for one year or longer in a state or federal prison (felony conviction).  While persons can and 
do access illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_74451], for the most part jail detainees are awaiting 
release while idle, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -free, and without plans for further community drug treatment.  This is an ideal 
opportunity to induce opi[INVESTIGATOR_74452] -NTX therapy, prior to releas e and during the 
initial phase of community re -entry, a strategy that has previously been applied in NIDA studies to the then 
well-known opi[INVESTIGATOR_74453], methadone and buprenorphine. 8,[ADDRESS_81238] -release opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211].  No 
current or previous XR -NTX trial has implemented therapy in a jail (or prison) setting, including no actively 
funded NIDA studies, or compared XR -NTX to ETAU  and MTP  standards -of-care, as proposed in this study.  
 The innovation  of this study  necessarily overlaps with the overall significance and approach: a 
definitive randomized evaluation of a new extended -release mu opi[INVESTIGATOR_74454] -to-
communit y re-entry (Figure 2).  Additionally, the above described and well -established NYC jail -based 
methadone treatment program (MTP) , the Key Extended Entry Program (KEEP) , creates a unique 
opportunity for a naturalistic, quasi -experimental comparison of arrest ees initially selecting MTP vs. those 
not interested in MTP and who are later randomized to XR -NTX, a comparison not available in other XR -
NTX clinical trials.  Finally, XR -NTX is delivered in a simple, generalizable, primary care Medical 
Management (MM) m odel, first in the jail, then within a city public hospi[INVESTIGATOR_74455] -centered medical 
home.  While re -entry buprenorphine treatment has been evaluated in this same MM model by [CONTACT_74554], [ADDRESS_81239]: while there is growing interest in the newly approve d use of XR -NTX for opi[INVESTIGATOR_74456], its effectiveness has not been evaluated in any correctional facilities, including large municipal 
jails, vs. usual care, nor in the context of standard -of-care methado ne treatment.  This study will allow 
providers, correctional and public health authorities, including our collaborators at the NYC Department of 
Health and Mental Hygiene, and payers and policy makers to assess the utility of XR -NTX as re -entry opi[INVESTIGATOR_74456], with important implications for limiting the great er public safety and societal costs of heroin and 
prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_74457].  Further, NYC jail inmates are predominantly African American and Hispanic, 
and represent communities disproportionat ely affected by [CONTACT_74555], family poverty, HIV and hepatitis 
C, all downstream effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561].  As the majority of opi[INVESTIGATOR_74458] .  We hypothesize adding XR -
NTX to the re -entry ‘toolbox’ will save both money and lives in these underserved communities.   
 
3.2 Research areas and NIDA priorities: effectiveness studies in criminal justice settings  
 The NYC jail population is low income, predominantly unemployed, of low educational attainment, 
primarily  African American and Hispanic, and suffers from opi[INVESTIGATOR_74459] a higher documented rate 
than any other chronic health condition.  This study  focuses on an intervention opportunity that d irectly 
relates to key NIH and NIDA priorities, described in the 2010 Strategic Plan, including treatment and 
“effectiveness research” which “ optimize[s] strategies for disseminating and implementing research -based 
treatments in health care and criminal ju stice settings”), HIV/AIDS and communicable disease prevention, 
and cross -cutting priorities including limiting the depth and adverse impact of health disparities. 15 
 
3.3 Large urban jails: a continuous, high -volume sampling of untreated opi[INVESTIGATOR_74460] i ndividuals  
 U.S. municipal jails have essentially no mandate and little capability to provide addiction treatment to 
the high turnover of short -stay detainees and inmates, as opposed to prisons (>1 year incarceration 
following a felony conviction), parole or probation programs (supervised community sentencing), or 
Protocol v3.6  X.O.R. : Extended -Release Naltrexone Opi[INVESTIGATOR_74427]-entry  
 
Page 6 of 29 alternative to incarceration programs such as drug courts explicitly designed as addiction interventions. 16 
These other spheres of the 7.1 million -person (2010) criminal justice system have some e xplicit intention of 
reform and rehabilitation, whereas jails function primarily as holding facilities pending the outcome of a 
criminal trial, or for brief, misdemeanor incarcerations.  While approximately 762,000 persons are detained 
overnight in U.S. ja ils, they are in jails such as NYC’s for a mean of only 3 -4 days, producing around 6 
million individual jail discharges back to the community annually; of 2.1 million persons in U.S. state and 
federal prisons held for 2 -3 years on average, approximately 80 0,000 return to the community annually. 17   
Recent national surveys make clear that evidence -based opi[INVESTIGATOR_74461]. 18,7 Many factors contribute to this, including 
unfavorable patient, health provider, and criminal justice system (CJS) authority attitudes towards 
methadone and buprenorphine treatment, and a lack of resources and poor coordination between 
correctional and community addiction treatment programs.  XR -NTX, which is not a controlled substance, 
has no abuse liability and is adaptable to general medicine and general psychiatric corr ectional and 
community treatment settings, may be an acceptable alternative pharmacologic paradigm in correctional 
systems resistant to methadone or buprenorphine and/or concerned with diversion of these medications. 19 
 
3.4 Public health opportunities: opi[INVESTIGATOR_74462] a leading cause of addiction -related morbidity and mortality in New 
York City and other large U.S. urban centers, particularly among poor and minori ty populations.  In NYC, 
there are an estimated 115,459 (range, 104,236 -126,681) current heroin and other opi[INVESTIGATOR_74463], an 
estimate that likely undercounts prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724]. [ADDRESS_81240] common 
chronic health condition diagnosed and treated across the entire male and female adult jail population in 
NYC, with an estimated 10 -20% of the annual jail population self -reporting dependence at arrest or currently 
in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2512]. [ADDRESS_81241] ivity, and the destruction of family and community health are 
among the harsh consequences of opi[INVESTIGATOR_9827].  Release from a correctional facility, when a person has 
usually been confined involuntarily to a drug free state and reverted to a lower physio logic tolerance to mu 
receptor agonists, has long been understood as an important risk factor for accidental drug overdose and 
drug-related mortality. 3-6 The prevention of overdose following release from NYC jails is a high priority of this 
study ’s collaborative partner, the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), as overdose 
mortality is a persistent and preventable cause of early mortality an d the 3 rd and 4 th leading cause of death 
among [LOCATION_001]ers aged 25 -34 yrs. and 35 -54 yrs., respectively. 21,22 
 
3.5 Evidence -based opi[INVESTIGATOR_74430]: methadone maintenance does not seem to be enough  
In NYC jails, the setting of this study , a jail -based methadone treatment program (MTP) has been 
the standard of care since 1986, yet the vast majority of eligible opi[INVESTIGATOR_74464].  In 2010, approximately 12,[ADDRESS_81242] (8000, 67%) were treated with a brief methadone detoxification protocol, 
meaning they were opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] (usually heroin) dependent but not interested in or eligible for further MTP. 23,11 
The remaining 4000 persons were able to access MTP in jail through the Key Extended Entry Program 
(KEEP), the NYC jail MTP, either because they were community MTP patients at arrest, or newly  initiated 
MTP during their incarceration.  Based on previous analyses, the majority of jail MTP patients return to 
community MTP, while the bulk of the [ADDRESS_81243] -release outcome observed elsewhere. 24,25 Why don’t more jailed individuals choose 
methadone? Commonly cited biases against methadone include concerns about long -term side effects and 
the perceived restrictions of community MTPs (i.e., directly observed therapy). 26,27,28,[ADDRESS_81244] blockade during jail -to-community re -entry

Page 7 of 29 Extended -release naltrexone (XR -NTX) is a depot form of the mu opi[INVESTIGATOR_74465],  
while untested in pre -release incarcerated persons, has shown potential as community opi[INVESTIGATOR_74466] -dwelling criminal justice populations. 30,31,[ADDRESS_81245] vs. placebo in terms of percent negative 
urines over time and prevention of sustained opi[INVESTIGATOR_74435], while noting few safety concerns and no 
serious adverse events or death s. This trial follows studies of oral naltrexone, which has been shown to be 
efficacious in tightly controlled trials with high medication adherence, but ineffectiveness as community and 
CJS-focused treatment, due to low rates of daily medication adherence, relapse to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], and 
difficulties re -starting naltre xone antagonism thereafter. 33,34,35 XR-NTX, however, neatly solves the oral 
naltrexone adherence issues with, in the case of Vivitrol (Alkermes, Inc., Cambridge, MA), a depot, long -
acting polylactide -co-glycolide microcapsule formulation. 36  Following an XR -NTX injection, a patient has a 
4-week period when the use of heroin or other opi[INVESTIGATOR_74467] -establish opi[INVESTIGATOR_74433]. 12 This sustained naltrexone blockade would potentially 
give persons leaving jail, who usually lack significant social support, stable housing, or employment, the 
time to make constructive decisions  regarding further community treatment, including continuing XR -NTX 
treatment, initiating methadone or buprenorphine therapy as the naltrexone e blockade wears off, or 
becoming involved in an intensive outpatient or residential program.  
In this current stu dy, the jail -based population is often released to the community with little to no 
supervision, unlike parolees being released from prison.  P arolees would be particularly invested in avoiding 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_74468] -related parole violations. Further, parolees are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_74469] -going drug treatment as a condition of their parole.  In this current study , potential 
participants are not necessarily parole -involved (some may be), have essentially been involunta rily detoxed 
as a consequence of incarceration, likely have not experienced any recent abstinence prior to incarceration, 
and, if not parole -involved, typi[INVESTIGATOR_74470] -free 
or medication -assisted r ecovery.  The average opi[INVESTIGATOR_74471] , and the potential benefit of XR -NTX is therefore 
that much greater in the current study .  Further, the Rikers Isla nd (NYC jails) setting allows a naturalistic 
comparison to jail -based MTP that is not found in any other published or on -going evaluation of XR -NTX, 
providing a unique and innovative setting to this study .

 1. Buprenorphine vs. Methadone at Jail Re -entry in NYC (R21 -DA020583, MaguraS).   Collaborating 
with the lead investigators, Drs. Steven Magura and Andrew Rosenblum at the National Developme nt and 
Research Institute, we evaluated buprenorphine vs. standard -of-care methadone maintenance within a 
recently conducted, NIDA -funded RCT design.  [CONTACT_6321] was a co -investigator on this trial, and our 
NYU/Bellevue team and primary care buprenorphine cli nic provided the bulk of the re -entry buprenorphine 
treatment in this N=133, 2 -year study, which found higher re -entry treatment retention in the buprenorphine 
arm, as well as longitudinal treatment outcomes similar to those of community -referred buprenorp hine 
patients. 37 Overall, 48 of 181 eligible persons refused participation, with few individuals (n=23) stating no 
interest in a clinical trial, thus demonstrating on a scale similar to the proposed study the feasibility of 
recruiting and enrolling 300 opi[INVESTIGATOR_74473] 3.5 years.  Subjects 
were primarily African American (25%) or Hispanic (64%); all were heroin users.  Following release of [ADDRESS_81247] -to-follow -up, yielding a 72% retent ion rate through

faster than the [ADDRESS_81251] established the core mechanics of XR -NTX

that targeted by [CONTACT_74556] . 
3. XR -NTX NYC Jail Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116], 2010 -2012 (NYU School of Medicine, LeeJD).   This completed  
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], funded by a small NYU School of Medicine seed grant, additional Department of Medicine support, 
and free study drug donated by [CONTACT_43421], closely collaborate d with co -investigators at NYC DOHMH, an d 
recruited persons to an [ADDRESS_81252] of XR -NTX vs. Treatment As Usual ( TAU) among opi[INVESTIGATOR_74474]. 13  Active recruitment began in 
January  2010 with t he final study visits ending in  July 2013 .  Overall , 142 persons  were pre-screened , 48 
consented participants, and 34 (17 to XR -NTX; 17 to TAU)  were randomized .  Results showed that 
acceptability of XR -NTX injections was high ([ADDRESS_81253] injection).  [ADDRESS_81254] -
release opi[INVESTIGATOR_74475] -NTX participants: 38% vs. 88% (p<0.004).  Over 8 
weeks , a greater proportion of urines were negative for opi[INVESTIGATOR_74476] -NTX arm, 59% vs. 24% 
(p<0.0001).  There were no overdose events or deaths.   
The inclusion and randomization procedures in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_74477]’s RCT ; all participants were out -of-treatment at arrest, not interested in methadone or 
buprenorphine treatment at release, and using 5 -15 bags/day heroin, illicit daily ‘street’ methadone plus 
heroin, or heroin plus oxycodone/hydrocodone at arrest.  All  participants had opi[INVESTIGATOR_74478] a brief, 6 -day methadone detox (10mg by [CONTACT_34048] x 3 days, 5mg x 3 
days).  All were subsequently opi[INVESTIGATOR_74479].  This study has allowed our team to 
explore and resolve a number of key feasibility issues: IRB and FDA IND approval for a study of XR -NTX 
(initially pre -FDA approval) among prisoners, identification and recruitment of potentially eligible 
participants, acceptability of study procedures, including nalox one challenges and XR -NTX injections in the 
jail medical clinics, and a high likelihood of post -release follow -up at NYU/Bellevue.  Thus, as a proof -of-
concept effort, this trial established the feasibility of XR -NTX treatment in a jail setting with a high  
prevalence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561].  
4. XR -NTX and Primary Care Medical Management . The psychosocial components of XR -NTX 
treatment proposed in this trial are those of Medical Management (MM), a simple, office -based approach to 
addiction pharmacotherapy desig ned for use in general care settings. MM, commonly included in clinical 
trials of addiction medications, including the COMBINE and Garbutt XR -NTX alcohol efficacy trials, focuses

effects and barriers to adherence, and psychosocial support for recovery and the uptake of related 
resources (i.e., intensive outpatient treatment or 12 -step involvement). 38,[ADDRESS_81255] administered approximately 300 XR -NTX injections within an MM model and are confident of 
its safety, ease -of-use, and potential for dissemination.

4.0 Study Aims  
 
4.1 Primary Aim  1: Our primary aim is to compare time -to-relapse among participants treated with XR -NTX 
vs. randomized ETAU , following release from jail.  
Hypothesis : We hypothesize XR -NTX will be associated with a significantly longer time -to-relapse vs. ETAU  
controls.  
 
4.2 Secondary Aim 2 : Time-to-relapse between XR -NTX vs. methadone  (MTP) .   
Hypothesis: We hypothesize XR -NTX will be associated with an equivalent time -to-relapse curve compared 
to the MTP observational cohort.   
 
4.3 Secondary Aim s 3a-e:  Specific Aim 3a -e: Related Opi[INVESTIGATOR_74441].  To compare re -entry 
rates of 5 key outcomes across all arms (XR -NTX, ETAU , MTP): 3a) community treatment 
retention/initiation, 3b) any opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], alcohol, or other illicit drug misuse, defined as continuous counts of both 
days, amount/day, and urine toxicologies for heroin or other illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_74480], 3c) injection 
drug use and HIV sexual risk factors, 3d) accidental drug overdose and mortality, and, 3e) re -incarceration 
and exploratory cost -effectiveness.    
Hypothesis: We hypothesize the XR -NTX participants will report less continuous opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], alcohol, and other 
illicit drug misuse, injection drug use and HIV risk, and accidental drug overdose events compared to ETAU  
participants, and similar rates to those of MTP participants.  We do not hypothesize a difference in re -
incarceration rates over the 24 -week treatment ph ase.   
 
4.4 Secondary Aims 4a -e: Qualitative interview aims: a) Themes on social barriers to “successful” jail -to-
community re -entry; b) Themes on social facilitators of “successful” jail -to-community re -entry; c) Themes 
on treatment barriers to “successfu l” jail-to-community re -entry; d) Themes on community treatment 
facilitators of “successful” jail -to-community re -entry; e) Other factors surrounding relapse or abstinence 
since release.  
 
 
5.0 Study Design: A randomized trial of XR -NTX vs. ETAU  as jail -to-community re -entry opi[INVESTIGATOR_74481] a quasi -experimental comparison of XR -NTX vs. MTP  
The core of this study  is a randomized controlled trial of XR -NTX vs. ETAU  for prevention of post -release 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_74482], 
N=[ADDRESS_81257], long -term effectiveness data.   ETAU  
participants will receive ‘enhanced counseling’ and community treatment referrals  in order to provide study 
benefit beyond usual care, and will consist of psychosocial support, referrals to community treatment, and 
encouragement to pursue methadone, buprenorphine, or any o ther appropriate addiction treatment at 
Protocol v3.6  X.O.R. : Extended -Release Naltrexone Opi[INVESTIGATOR_74427]-entry  
 
Page 10 of 29 release.  A cohort of MTP participants will form a quasi -experimental comparison between XR -NTX and 
MTP, with prospective and propensity score matching used to account for baseline non -equivalence 
between the two arm s  
 
5.1 Qualitative Interviews : In addition to the primary study design above, the research team will conduct  
semi -structured qualitative interviews with a sub -set of participants randomized into  the study.  Participants 
who are successfully randomized into the study and who specifically agree to participate in a qualitative 
intervie w by [CONTACT_74558] -recorded  interview (s) conducted  2 weeks  (or at later time points ) after release from jail . Interviews will 
last about [ADDRESS_81258] experienced 
community re -entry, to shed light on barriers and facilitators of successful community reintegration. We will 
also describe these obstacles and promoters of success in terms of substance use and incarceration 
histor y.

7.0 Study Procedures  
7.1 Recruitment and Pre -screening  
Persons with known Department of Corrections release dates and recent or on -going opi[INVESTIGATOR_74484], both on Rikers Island; one male (Eric M. Taylor Center), one female 
Protocol v3.6  X.O.R. : Extended -Release Naltrexone Opi[INVESTIGATOR_74427]-entry  
 
Page 11 of 29 (Rose M. Singer Center).  NYU LMC study staff with  Department of Health and Mental Hygiene  (DOHMH ) 
clinical credentials and DOHMH -approved access to Rikers electro nic medical record database ( EMR ) will 
search for opi[INVESTIGATOR_74485] . They will then approach the potentially eligible persons  through a scheduled meeting in the 
jail’s clinic. It is here that study staff will first introduce the study and assess each person’s eligibility and 
interest in participation . A one -page handout explaining detailed information about the study medication 
(XR-NTX) will be handed out by [CONTACT_74561] . The study team will 
receive IRB -approval for this informational handout prior to distributing.  In order to receive EMR access 
research coordinators will complete all DOHMH Volunteer Staff Application Forms. This includes a signed 
agreement between the research coordinator and DOHMH regarding the protection of patient privacy and 
any me dical information obtained from EMR’s or in any other form while at a DOHMH facility. The primary 
investigator of the study, [CONTACT_6321], is a credentialed Rikers physician and provider in the system with full 
EMR access. Potentially eligible patients will the n be informed of study purposes and procedures and 
invited to participate in screening assessments.  In addition, outreach and education efforts adapted from 
previous NYC jail opi[INVESTIGATOR_74486], including flyers, pamphlets, and announcements within s pecific 
housing areas and detailing of opi[INVESTIGATOR_74487].  
Oversampling of women and children .  Women and children age 18 -21 years are a small sub -sample of the 
overall populations of opi[INVESTIGATOR_74488] (age 18+).  For 
example the youngest participant in our current jail pi[INVESTIGATOR_74489] [ADDRESS_81259]’s 
youngest participant was 31 y.o.  Women constitute only 10 -15% of the general jail population.  We are 
planning on oversampling both groups, women and persons age 18 -21 y.o., through the above 
prescreening process, with an overall goal of 20% women and 10% persons age [ADDRESS_81260] will evaluate eligibility.  Written informed consent including a 
consent quiz adapted from t he parent grant protocol will be used to document informed consent.  A 
screening/baseline visit will be conducted by [CONTACT_74562] a study clinician to determine eligibility.  
Eligible persons will then be randomized using consecutive pre -numbered env elopes containing treatment 
assignments based on a random number generator.  
 
Illiterate participants  
In accordance with NYU policy and procedures for research that involves greater than minimal risk, study 
staff will take great care ensuring participants t hat are unable to read a written consent form (i.e. blind or 
illiterate participants) are able to provide full consent from an oral consent process. In such cases, study 
staff will read the consent form out loud to the participant and the participant will be given adequate 
opportunity to ask questions. Participant consent will be acknowledged, provided the participant (1) retains 
the ability to understand the concepts of the study and evaluate the risk and benefit of being in the study 
when it is explained verbally and (2) is able to indicate approval or disapproval to study entry. If capable of 
doing so, the participant will sign, or marks an “X” to signify consent. If that is not possible, the participant 
will provide verbal consent. The study staff obtain ing consent and a witness will sign the written study 
consent form to acknowledge that an oral process was used and, if necessary, that the participant gave oral 
consent. In addition, the consent process will be documented in the participant’s medical reco rd and signed 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_74490]. Although, audio and/or video tape of this oral 
consent process would be ideal, neither will be possible in this type of recruitment setting  as electronic 
equipment are not allowed in DOC jail facilities.  Similarly, the consent quiz will be read aloud to the 
participant. If possible, the participant will make a mark  (“X”) to signify “True” or “False” as their answer to 
each consent quiz questi on. If that is not possible, the participant will provide a verbal answer to each 
question. The study staff obtaining consent and a witness will sign the written consent quiz to acknowledge 
that an oral process was used to obtain the participant’s consent quiz answers. For subjects that

Page 12 of 29 understand  English, but do not read or write English well, or at all, again the study staff obtaining consent 
and an impartial witness will document that the participant understands the research and the consent 
process and c onsented to participate.  
 
7.3 Study Interventions: RCT XR -NTX and ETAU  Arms  
Extended -Release Naltrexone ( XR-NTX) Medical Management Treatment.   Participants randomized 
to XR -NTX treatment will be scheduled for an injection visit within the week of their sc heduled release, so 
as to maximize the time post -release that the naltrexone dose is active.  Using an identical treatment 
protocol to that currently employed by [CONTACT_32360][INVESTIGATOR_74491]024555, the participant must report no 
recent opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], provide a  second opi[INVESTIGATOR_74492], undergo a ‘naloxone challenge’ consisting of a 
0.8mg SC or intramuscular  naloxone challenge, only after which, if no opi[INVESTIGATOR_74493], a single 380mg XR -NTX dose will be administered intramuscularly to t he right upper outer gluteus 
by [CONTACT_941] a trained study physician, physician assistant, or registered nurse.   
The injection site and any side effects will be assessed during the final week of incarceration as 
needed and at the initial post -release follow -up visit.  Five subsequent XR -NTX injections will be provided in 
4-week intervals at Bellevue Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_74494].  In the event of a participant missing a 
scheduled dose by [CONTACT_74563], study staff will attempt to reschedule the injection prov ided the 
participant remains opi[INVESTIGATOR_74495] -report and urine toxicology and has a negative naloxone re -
challenge, as per standard protocols. 32 Participants relapsing to opi[INVESTIGATOR_74496] 
(below).   In addition to physician MM, XR -NTX participants will receive brief, [ADDRESS_81261] of care jail services 
and will be common across all study arms.  
The 25-week XR-NTX treatment phase (24-weeks post -release) will constitute the active phase of 
the trial, and mark the end -point for the primary outcome, time -to-relapse.  Thereafter, all participants, 
including XR -NTX participants, will be followed for an addition al [ADDRESS_81262] -XR-NTX safety and treatment outcomes (opi[INVESTIGATOR_74497], AEs, and other treatment uptake).  XR -NTX participants will be prompted by [CONTACT_74564].  Lastly, all participants will return for follow -up study visit s at week 52 ([ADDRESS_81263]-release) , and 104 ([ADDRESS_81264] -release) in con junction with the NIDA SOMATICS U01 
collaborative . This will allow study staff to gather data on opi[INVESTIGATOR_74498] a 6-month period 
following the active XR -NTX treatment phase . 
Enhanced Treatment -As-Usual (ETAU) .  The ETAU  assignment will include brief, [ADDRESS_81265] maintenance (methadone 
and bupren orphine programs), drug -free outpatient and [ADDRESS_81266] -release 
treatment visits.  
 
7.4 Quasi -experimental methadone cohort  (MTP).  
 In an effort to recruit comparable MTP and XR -NTX cohorts, we plan on a prospective matching  
strategy , in addition to post -hoc propensity score matching, to interpret outcomes in both arms.  Each 
potential participant will be characterized by [CONTACT_74565] -to-relapse: 1) gender, 2) age (within +/ - 5 years), 3) homelessness (yes/no), 4) level of opi[INVESTIGATOR_74499] v3.6  X.O.R. : Extended -Release Naltrexone Opi[INVESTIGATOR_74427]-entry  
 
Page [ADDRESS_81267] (</ >10 bags/day), 5) current IV use (yes/no), 6) pre -arrest cocaine misuse (yes/ no), and 7) 
pre-arrest alcohol and/or benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_74500] (yes/no).  These variables are routinely available for all 
arrestees identified at intake as opi[INVESTIGATOR_74501] ’s EMR system .  Following the randomization 
of an XR -NTX participant, a  1:1 XR -NTX:MTP matching algorithm will attempt to recruit the most similar 
potentially eligible methadone participant (up to 7 of 7 baseline criteria matching, with a minimum of both 
age and gender matching) in real -time.  Prospective matching in addition  to post -hoc propensity score 
matching (PSM, below) is possibly superior to PSM alone within quasi -experimental designs. 43,[ADDRESS_81268] referrals to re -entry community treatment .  Follow -up visits at NYU/Bellevue will be for 
assessment and counseling only and will be independent of community methadone treatment  participation.

7.5 Rescue strategies for persons relapsing to opi[INVESTIGATOR_74503] a risk of relapsing to illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_74504]/alcohol

[ADDRESS_81269] with treatment referrals for detox services at Bellevue Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_74506], but will not otherwise directly provide  such services or medications.  Otherwise any XR -NTX,  ETAU , 
or MTP patient who has relapsed and is not interested in continuing their baseline study condition (i.e., an 
MTP patient refuses further program attendance, or an XR -NTX participant does not wish to continue 
injections due to side effects or for any other reason) will be encouraged to pursue other appropriate 
community treatment, the menu of which includes the robust addiction service offerings at Bellevue Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_74506] (BHC).  BHC’s services are  available to all persons, regardless of insurance status or an ability to 
pay, and include emergency detox inpatient services, methadone treatment , office -based buprenorphine, 
and intensive outpatient and dual diagnosis programs.  These services will cons ist of usual care occurring 
outside of the study and will not be directly provided by [CONTACT_74566].

Page [ADDRESS_81271] measures of drug and alcohol 
use, medical status, and on -going treatment services utilization (Table 1). Drug use and treatment history 
questions will be adapted from the Addiction Severity Index Lite (ASI -Lite).45  The Time Line Follow Back 
(TLFB) is a validated, best practice method of assessing recent drug and alcohol use using a daily calendar 
count methodology, 46 and will combined with urine toxicology results to define the primary relapse and 
related outcomes (Ai m 1, 2, and 3b).  Assessment forms including the Economic Form 90 , ASI -Lite, 
Methadone Treatment Exposure, World Health Organization Quality of Life  BREF  (WHO -BREF), and  the 
NYC Department of Corrections Inmate Look -up form will be used to track non-study addiction treatment 
(Aim 3a), medical and other costs, employment and benefits, and re -incarceration, which will capture the 
basic data for exploratory cost -effectiveness analysis (and later  for formal economic modeling through a 
linked economic study, if funded) (Aim 3e).  The Risk Assessment Battery (RAB)  will be used to compare 
baseline to post -release injection drug use and HIV risk factors (Aim 3c). 47  Surveys of Adverse Events 
(AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs),  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] O verdose -and XR -NTX-injection -site-specific AE/SAE , and 
in the event of a drop-out, Vital Statistics, will be used to track overdose -related AEs and mortality (Aim 3d).  
Open -ended questions and the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire 48 will assess attitudes regarding treatment  
preferences in the three study arms.   
 
8.1 Primary outcome: time-to-relapse.  
The primary outcome measure will be the time -to-relapse (or loss of persistent abstinence).  All 
individuals are abstinent from illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_74511], as evidenced by [CONTACT_74567] -
report.  Beginning at release from jail and study  visit 2 (week 2), opi[INVESTIGATOR_74512] a) self -report of 
>7 consecutive days of non -prescribed, illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], or, b) two consecutive urine toxicology tests 
positive for illicit, non -prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], oxycodone, methadone, or bupre norphine) . 
This definition of relapse is chosen to concur with the on -going XR -NTX RCT DA024555, which uses 
the same criteria for relapse, as well as the planned NIDA CTN -0051 , X:BOT,  XR-NTX vs. Buprenorphine 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_74513] l, which proposes a similar primary outcome and relapse 
event definition.  Self -reports (Timeline Follow Back) and urine results are the on -going measures of illicit 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_15834].  If the urine tests are consistent with self -report, self -report will be used as the primary measure 
of use.  In the event that a participant reports no use, but their urine tests indicate use, we will regard the 5 
days prior to and including the day of testing to be positive for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441].  A person with two positive urine 
tests b ut no self -reported use would be designated as positive for sustained relapse ( >7 days of use).  The 
time of the event occurs at the start of the qualifying clinical event period (first of the 7 consecutive use 
days).  In the event of a missed visit or dro p-out, missing urines will be counted as positive results.  Thus, 
persons droppi[INVESTIGATOR_74514] [ADDRESS_81272]

urine data.   
 
9.[ADDRESS_81273]-release, or days of use following release from jail 
during the current 8 -week trial.  In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_74515], the XR -NTX arm resulted in 50% success at 
avoiding relapse at 6 months, versus less than 20% in the placebo arm.  We therefore predi ct 50% of the 
XR-NTX arm to produce a time -to-event of 25 weeks (no relapse event occurs), versus 20% of the ETAU  
arm, with the distribution of failure (relapse) randomly distributed in both arms across the trial.   
Although we will use a proportional haza rds model for comparing two groups, as described below, 
we use  a logrank test to estimate the required sample size for the core RCT of XR -NTX vs. ETAU . The 
estimate of power is conservative because the logrank statistic, which essentially ignores covariate s, is the 
score test for the Cox proportional hazards model, which accommodates use of prognostic mediators.  
Given the projected 25 -week 50% success (no relapse event) rate in the XR -NTX arm, a two -sided

(Stata SE 10) Given possible attrition following enrollment and post -release conservatively estimated to be 
around 50 -75% by [CONTACT_5875] 25, we have increased the target sample for randomization to N= 170 persons t otal, 
or n= 85 per arm.  The quasi -experimental observational MTP arm (n= 85) is added symmetrically (equal 
size) and naturalistically to compare abstinence and treatment retention rates between XR -NTX and MTP 
standard -of-care, and results in a total enrolled sample of N= 255.  If post -release opi[INVESTIGATOR_74516], as we would predict, there may be in fact no significant differences between XR -NTX 
vs. MTP, which would enable an estimate of the relative effectiveness of a newer  opi[INVESTIGATOR_74517].  
 
10.0 Statistical  Analysis Plan  
In addition  to this study’s original and distinct analysis plan , described here,  the NIDA SOMATICS  
U01 cooperative, which includes  Friends Research Institute Inc. (FRI), [LOCATION_001] University (NYU), and the 
University of [LOCATION_004], Los Angeles (UCLA) , will share several core assessments and similar study -arms, 
allowing for naturalistic comparisons across the  [ADDRESS_81274]. Laska is a senior biosta tistician, a Professor in the NYU Department 
of Psychiatry, and the Director of the Statistical Sciences Laboratory of the Nathan Kline Institute (NKI) for 
Psychiatric Research in Orangeburg, NY.   His theoretical work has focused on design and statistical 
analysis of clinical trials, and he was a recently consultant to Alkermes, Inc., on the FDA approval of XR -
NTX (Vivitrol) for the treatment of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561].  
Preliminary analyses to check for unbalanced baseline characteristics  among the randomized arm s: 
as a first step, several analyses will be performed to assess the balance achieved by [CONTACT_74568]. These comparisons will use analyses of variance 
for continuous variables and chi square  models for discrete or ordinal responses. Variables for which there 
is evidence of non -equivalence will be included as covariates in treatment comparisons.   
Specific Aim 1: Time-to-relapse between XR -NTX vs. ETAU .  We hypothesize XR -NTX will be 
associated with a significantly longer time -to-relapse vs. ETAU controls .  The analyses will model time -to-
relapse as a function of treatment assignment (XR -NTX vs.  ETAU ), including possible mediating factors, 
including opi [INVESTIGATOR_74518], concurrent cocaine or alcohol and/or benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_74519], and homelessness as covariates, in a Cox proportional hazards regression model.   The 
proportionality of the relative hazard assumption will be examined via the  treatment by a time interaction 
term.  An asymptotic 95% CI for the hazard ratio of the difference between the treatment arms in time -to-
relapse will be constructed. The study arm success rates with 95% CIs at week 25 (end of active treatment) 
and the dif ference in success rate at that time point will be constructed.  As drop -outs are counted as 
reaching the relapse event beginning with the first missed visit, intention -to-treat analysis will include all 
randomized participants.  Alternative missing data i mputation strategies will be compared to this 
missed=positive approach.   
A further analysis of time -to-relapse differences between groups will be a “cure model.”  This is a 
strategy to disentangle the issue of participants who never respond (immediate rel apse) and subjects who 
had an overall positive treatment effect (indefinite time -to-relapse).  A cure model will be used in the form 
H(t) = 1 - p + pS(t); where H(t) is the survival distribution, p represents the probability of relapse, and S(t) 
the surviv al distribution of time -to-relapse, conditional  on relapse occurring. The parameters will be 
estimated based both on Kaplan Meier methods and parametrically.  The equality of the values of p for the 
two treatment arms will be tested using a nonparametric l ikelihood ratio test. For the parametric test, a 
logistic will be used to model p and a Weibull survival distribution will be used to model time -to-relapse, S(t). 
Both allow the use of covariates.  In all analyses, the assumptions underlying the applicatio n of all the 
statistical methods that are used will be examined, principally through examination of standardized 
residuals, influence diagnostics, and graphical displays.  
Specific Aim 2: Time-to-relapse between XR -NTX vs. methadone.  We hypothesize XR -NTX will be 
associated with an equivalent time -to-relapse curve compared to the MTP observational cohort .  The same 
Protocol v3.6  X.O.R. : Extended -Release Naltrexone Opi[INVESTIGATOR_74427]-entry  
 
Page [ADDRESS_81275] and cure model approaches using an indicator variable for treatment condition and 
the same covariate terms for baseline potential prognostic indicators will be used to compare time -to-
relapse rates between XR -NTX and MTP, which are hypothesized as similar (overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 95% CIs).  
Further, and within this quasi -experimental comparison of the XR -NTX (and ETAU ) RCT participants 
and those choosing MTP, our interest is in comparing outcomes in the counterfactual sense: what would 
have happened to those who did not receive XR -NTX treatment, either MTP or  ETAU , had they received it? 
If we were able to estimate the “potential outcome,” it could be compared to the outcome that resulted from 
the treatment they actually received. Propensity score matching (PSM) will be used to control f or treatment 
selection bias. [ADDRESS_81276] been implicit in the physician’s 
treatment choice presumably follow some rational clinical logic that can be mirrored on average by 
[CONTACT_74569].  However, the treatm ent assignment mechanism, detox and subsequent randomization 
in the RCT portion of this study, or initial methadone treatment selection in the MTP arm, is for the most part 
through subject preference .  Hence, while the hoped for explanation of treatment ch oice is not likely to be 
robust, the PSM approach at the very least is a method for matching subjects on baseline characteristics, 
so as to compare “like with like,” which should be greatly strengthened by [CONTACT_74570]. The crucial dif ference between PSM and traditional matching approaches is that the former 
matches on multiple variables simultaneously while the latter matches on one variable at a time. We will use 
Mahalanobis Metric Matching or Caliper to find the closest subjects in t he XR -NTX group and independently 
the closest subject in the ETAU  and MTP groups, using the SAS SUGI 214 -26 “GREEDY” Macro. In this 
approach, both the baseline covariates and the propensity score are utilized. The subjects will be divided 
into 5 groups (qu intiles) based on the propensity score distribution.  A fully nonparametric randomization 
test will be utilized to test for treatment differences in time -to-relapse where the reassignment is within 
quintiles but the randomization probability distribution i s across the 5 groups.  PSM also allows us to assess 
the trial design validity: if treatment effects of either XR -NTX or MTP washout vs. ETAU , this would suggest 
either the experimental or observed interventions, respectively, were less effective than prop osed, and 
observed ‘head -to-head’ differences between arms may stem from unplanned biases.  
Specific Aim 3a -e: Related Opi[INVESTIGATOR_74441].   To compare re -entry rates of 5 key 
outcomes across all arms (XR -NTX, ETAU , MTP): 3a) community treatment retention/initiation, 3b) any 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], alcohol, or other illicit drug misuse, defined as continuous counts of both days, amount/day, and 
urine toxicologies for heroin or other illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_74480], 3c) injection drug use and HIV sexual 
risk factors, 3d) accidental drug overdose and mortality, and, 3e) re -incarceration and exploratory cost -
effectiveness.    
We hypothesize the XR -NTX participants will report less continuous opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], alcohol, and other illicit 
drug mis use, injection drug use and HIV risk, and accidental drug overdose events compared to ETAU  
participants, and similar rates to those of MTP participants.  We do not hypothesize a difference in re -
incarceration rates over the [ADDRESS_81277]-
effectiveness of the active interventions in each of the 3 studies.  
 Specific Aims 4a -e: Qualitative interview aims : a) Themes on social barriers to “successful” jail -to-
community re -entry; b) Themes on social facilitators of “successful” jail -to-community re -entry; c) Themes 
on treatment barriers to “successful” jail -to-community re -entry; d) Themes on community treatment 
facilitators of “successful” jail-to-community re -entry; e) Other factors surrounding relapse or abstinence 
since release.  
 We plan to conduct qualitative interviews with randomized participants who agree to participate in 
them by [CONTACT_74571]. These int erviews will be conducted with participants 
in all three arms  at 2 weeks after release from jail and later time points, as needed. We will be using a 
grounded -theory approach to identify themes that emerge among opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -dependent persons transition ing 
from jail to the community.  
 We will use ATLAS.ti, a software package used primarily for qualitative, unstructured data analysis, 
to transcribe and analyze our qualitative data, including the coding of text or text passages and data

transcription is completed.  
 
11.0 Data Collection and Management  
The NYU/HHC CTSI and NYULMC Clinical Research Informatics and Data Management Unit 
(CRIDM), led by [CONTACT_74572], M.Ed., will provide clinical research informatics and data management 
support for the study. CRIDM has developed a comprehensive data acquisi tion and management system 
for use across the NYU LMC campus, which we will customize for this study . CRIDM personnel will develop 
the additional electronic case report forms (CRFs) required to manage the data for this study , and work with 
study personnel t o ensure the completeness and integrity of all study data. All data will be checked in real 
time, stored in a centralized database, reviewed and monitored for completeness and accuracy, and 
undergo a final cleaning following the last subject visit, followi ng which the study database will be locked.  
Protected Health Information (PHI) will be collected and stored in the form of e ach participant’s 
original signed informed consent and  locator form.  These written documents will be filed as individual 
charts and locked securely in a private Department of Population Health office cabinet.  These charts will be 
accessed to call and follow -up with patients  post-release  and to maintain the ICF on file . Participants will be 
assigned sequentially n umbered unique study ID numbers at the time of consent (e.g. #001 -510). These ID 
numbers will be  the only identifier entered on Case Report Forms (CRF) and research assessments to 
distinguish one participant from another. Secure laptops will be used for we b-based data entry, CRF 
variables  will be input  into a secure central database on an NYULMC server. The laptops themselves will be 
password -protected, but will not store PHI, study ID number  information or  any research assessment data  
and will be used for web-based data entry  only.   To maintain a link between the  study ID and PHI for 
purposes of follow -up and record -keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007],  individual participant charts and research assessment/CRF data 
there will be a master participant ID key that will contain each partic ipant ’s PHI (name, DOB)  and their 
corresponding unique study ID number. This master key identifier file (.xls)  will be maintained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_74520] a secure NYU LMC desktop file and accessible only to study staff.  Similarly, audio 
recorded tapes for qualitative interviews will be maintained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_74521]. Any notes taken during qualitative 
interviews will also be locked in  secure NYUMC file cabinets and will not contain linkage to the participant’s 
study ID#, i nstead each interview will be numbered consecutively (e.g. Qualitative Interview, QI #001, QI 
#002. etc.). Audio -recordings will be transcribed by [CONTACT_74573] [ADDRESS_81278] NYU IRB guidelines. The final de -identifiable digital dataset may 
be used by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_12749] -Investigator for secondary analysis, in which case future IRB -
approval would be sought. In add ition, considering NIDA has combined this proposal, which was originally 
an independent R01 submission, as ‘U01’ center grant with two other contemporaneous but different study 
sites (Friend Institute: Baltimore, MD and UCLA: Los Angeles, CA), we anticipat e all three ‘U01’ study sites 
will combine harmonized data for additional analyses after all study sites have closed.

psychiatric conditions that are reasonably controlled and not majorly disabling in the view of the study

years (range, 31 -61), 45% Hispanic Caucasian, 10% non -Hispanic Caucasian, 45% African American, and 
10-20% female.

Page [ADDRESS_81280] DHS/OHRP to address this topic and for permission to enroll 
prisoners in a federally funded research trial.  However, we believe this st udy carefully conforms to the 
Federal guidelines for research among prisoners (CFR 46.306) in the following manner:  
 
1.) Research on practices, both innovative and accepted, which have the intent and reasonable probability 
of improving the health or well -being of the subject. In cases in which those studies require the assignment 
of prisoners in a manner consistent with protocols approved by [CONTACT_74575], the study may proceed only after the Secretary has  consulted with appropriate 
experts, including experts in penology medicine and ethics, and published notice, in the Federal Register, of 
his intent to approve such research.  
 
2) Any possible advantages accruing to the prisoner through his or her participa tion in the research, when 
compared to the general living conditions, medical care, quality of food, amenities and opportunity for 
earnings in the prison, are not of such a magnitude that his or her ability to weigh the risks of the research 
against the va lue of such advantages in the limited choice environment of the prison is impaired.  Incentives 
and benefits from participation are not coercive and are fair value of participant’s time and, following 
release, travel.  
 
(3) The risks involved in the research  are commensurate with risks that would be accepted by [CONTACT_105] -prisoner 
volunteers. This study's methods and interventions are consistent with good clinical practices in community 
settings.  
 
(4) Procedures for the selection of subjects within the prison are fa ir to all prisoners and immune from 
arbitrary intervention by [CONTACT_74576]. Unless the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_74522], control subjects must be selected 
randomly from the group of available prisoners who meet the characteristics needed for that particular 
research project. Jail authorities have no role in this study or in treatment assignment, which is random.  
 
(5) The information is presented in language which is understandable to the subject population. The 
informed consent and consent quiz are intended to be understandable to adults in jail.  
 
(6) Adequate assurance exists that parole boards will not take into account a prisoner's participation in the 
research in making decisions regarding parole, and each prisoner is clearly informed in advance that 
participation in the research will have no effect on his or her parole;   
There is no role for, relationship, or other interaction with parole or probation authorities and this study.  
 
(7) Where the Board finds there may be a need for follow -up examination or care of participants after the 
end of their participation, adequate provision has been made for such examination or care, taking into 
account the varyin g lengths of individual prisoners' sentences, and for informing participants of this fact. The 
study primarily consists of community follow -up of adults released from NYC jails. Follow -up is extensive 
(every 2 week assessments) , with follow -up visits  exten ding 4 weeks beyond the end of study treatment 
phase (at Week 29)  and two long -term follow -up visits at  [ADDRESS_81281]-treatment phase ( at 
Week 52  and Week 104 ). 
 
12.2 Research Information  
The assessments and  instruments that will be used to obtain information from participants 
consenting to enroll in this study are as  above (8.0 , Table 1 ). Participants will be recruited by [CONTACT_74577], advertisements and broadcasts within the appropriate jail facilities  and housing areas, word of 
mouth, and by [CONTACT_74578][INVESTIGATOR_74523].  Pre -screening for persons who are 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_74460], have completed a methadone detox or are actively receiving  methadone maintenance, 
and have a known pending release date can be generated by [CONTACT_12783] -referencing existing electronic health, 
Protocol v3.6  X.O.R. : Extended -Release Naltrexone Opi[INVESTIGATOR_74427]-entry  
 
Page 20 of 29 pharmacy, and correctional databases.  Informed consent will be obtained only after the prospective 
participant demonstrates comprehension of the study by [CONTACT_74579] 100% on the 
consent quiz.   Due to differing inclusion/exclusion criteria sets between the randomized treatment arms 
(XR-NTX and ETAU ) and the non -randomized observational methadone cohort ( MTP ), separate consent 
questionnaires will be used  depending on whether participants are enrolled to be randomized to XR-NTX or 
ETAU  vs. those enrolled into the MTP  group.  
 
12.3 Potential Risks  
General Risks Associated with Treatment of Opi[INVESTIGATOR_74524].   This 
study randomizes 170 opi[INVESTIGATOR_74525] -release naltrexone (XR -NTX, n= 85) 
treatment or no medication, enhanced treatment -as-usual conditions  (ETAU , n=85), and also recruits 85 
persons active in jail -based methadone maintenance  treatment program (MTP).  All participants will be 
followed in -jail and for [ADDRESS_81282]-treatment phase follow -up visits at weeks 29 , 52, and 104 .  
Any relapse to illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_74526] (or while incarcerated) implies a risk of death and 
disability, and some proportion of participants in  all three arms can be expected not to respond to treatment 
and resume opi[INVESTIGATOR_74527]/or other drug and alcohol use.  All participants relapsing post -release and struggling 
with on -going drug and alcohol use will be counseled and referred by [CONTACT_74580], including the immediately available addiction services available at Bellevue Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (emergency 
detoxification with referral to residential treatment or supportive housing, methadone treatment , 
buprenorphine, intensive outpati ent, dual diagnosis).   
The Informed Consent Form  (ICF)  will cover this reality of opi[INVESTIGATOR_74528], the 
referral s and rescue options, and study staff will clearly discuss this risk at baseline and at each follow -up 
visit.  The ICF and conse nt quiz will also clearly detail in plain language the below -described treatment and 
medication side effects.  We feel strongly that none of the study procedures or treatments heightens the risk 
of relapse or overdose beyond the daily, baseline risks of on -going opi[INVESTIGATOR_9827].  The study visit 
schedule may be altered to accommodate and evaluate adverse events or relapse -related concerns, and 
study staff will be available by [CONTACT_74581] (all patients will be given the 
PI’s direct mobile number).  
Enhanced Treatment -As-Usual  Arm.  All study participants will receive psychosocial support and 
assistance with and referrals to other addiction treatment services and supportive housing resources, as 
well as monetary compensation fo r visit time and travel.  These benefits may be particularly helpful to this 
study’s group, which represents ‘enhanced’ counseling and involves more therapeutic attention, more 
referrals to treatment, and much greater support in the event of post -release r elapse, than actual ‘treatment’ 
in NYC jails for persons not interested in methadone, which in reality amounts to no treatment after a brief 
methadone detox, no on -going interaction with counseling staff, and no formal discharge planning pending 
release.  Provision of concrete benefit to the ETAU  arm is in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_74529], in which all experimental arms must receive some tangible yet non -coercive benefit 
beyond usual care.  With t hat said, the analytic plan and rationale of this study is based on the fact that a 
greater proportion of ETAU  participants will relapse following release.  As above, on -going study follow -up 
and an abundant local treatment referral base is intended to min imize the harm associated with these 
higher rates of relapse.   
Methadone Treatment Program Arm.   The ETAU  and MTP groups will otherwise not be exposed to 
risks beyond those of usual care, which will be provided by [CONTACT_74582].  
Methadone maintenance can of course be associated with bodily symptoms including fatigue and 
constipation, and over -sedation and a risk of overdose when combined with sedative -hypnotics or alcohol.  
High-dose methadone is likely associated with prolonged QT  syndrome and implies a higher risk of unstable 
and fatal arrhythmias. [ADDRESS_81283] already agreed to these risks and benefits of a methadone 
treatment program (MTP) prior to recruitment and enrollment, as their choice to engage in jail MTP will have 
Protocol v3.6  X.O.R. : Extended -Release Naltrexone Opi[INVESTIGATOR_74427]-entry  
 
Page 21 of 29 been established well before enrollment, which will occur at the end of the incarceration period.  The study 
will not otherwise recommend, influence, or involve itself in the daily aspects of MTP, such as dose level, 
attendance and take -home schedules, or ancillary counseling.   The MTP arm will receive additional  brief 2 -
session  enhanced counseling intended to provide all participants with a higher than usual level of care  and 
additional commun ity treatment referrals .   
Extended -Release Naltrexone Arm, Expected Adverse Events.   Persons receiving XR -NTX may 
experience several common side effects of naltrexone therapy, whether injectable or oral, including nausea, 
headache, and fatigue (‘naltrexon e flu’), particularly during the initial first few days of dosing.  Nausea may 
be more likely with oral vs. injectable naltrexone (only injectable XR -NTX is used in this study). In most 
published naltrexone clinical trials, these side effects are well -tolerated by [CONTACT_1962], though it is certainly 
possible some patients will discontinue XR -NTX based on these common and expected naltrexone side 
effects, as a small percentage of patients did in our team’s recent alcohol treatment study, the COMBINE 
study which  used oral naltrexone, the Garbutt XR -NTX alcohol efficacy study, and the Krupi[INVESTIGATOR_74530] -NTX 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_74531]. 38,[ADDRESS_81284] been recorded, with a very low percentage

full mu agonists, which should  be provided only in a monitored medical setting such as an Emergency or

Krupi[INVESTIGATOR_74530] -NTX clinical trials, nor were these events noted in 1 -3 years of long -term opi[INVESTIGATOR_74535]. N onetheless, we will r ely on close monitoring of AEs/SAEs, regular 
communication with and oversight by [CONTACT_74583], and close follow -up and prompt rescue referrals among 
persons relapsing to opi[INVESTIGATOR_74536].  We note again that 
it is unlikely the XR -NTX arm is at greater risk for relapse and overdose than the ETAU  participants and that 
it is unknown to what extent XR -NTX re -entry participants are at greater or lower risk than methadone

outcome will be conducted . 
 
12.4 Confidentiality  
Participants will be asked to provide information regarding a number of sensitive behaviors (e.g., 
alcohol and drug use, sexual history, criminal history and on -going illicit activities).   This type of personal 
information divulged by [CONTACT_74584].  Therefore, in addition to the safeguards pu t in place for the 
collection and storage of all data as described above (section 11.0 Data Collection and Management),  the 
study team  has obtained a Federal Certificate of Confidentiality to encompass protocol activity  and further 
safeguard the possible r isk of released confidential information  (COC #DA -13-154, 1/10/14) . We will provide 
all staff with training in their responsibilities for maintaining subject confidentiality; we will use unique 
identifiers to identify subjects in the database; all data wil l be kept in locked filing cabinets or on our secure 
server to which only the investigators and project manager will have access  to. Study findings will utilize 
only aggregate data and no publication or presentation will involve any use of individual information.

12.6 Risk/Benefit Ratio  
Most of the risks described are expected adve rse events associated with XR -NTX, or those of 
baseline opi[INVESTIGATOR_74537] -to-community ETAU  or MTP. The additional risks of the active 
treatment arm (XR -NTX) or observational methadone arm are likely small compared to the expected benefit 
of disco ntinuing alcohol use.  
 
12.7 Data Safety & Monitoring Board (DSMB)  
Due to the uniqueness of this NIDA U01 protocol a common DSMB  coordinated by [CONTACT_4289]/NIDA  will be 
shared across all three collaborative sites (Friend Institute: Baltimore, MD and UCLA: Los Angel es, CA) to 
monitor the study according to a bi -annual schedule of clinical trial monitoring.  The University of [LOCATION_004] 
Los Angeles’ Integrated Substance Abuse Programs (UCLA ISAP) DSMB will monitor each collaborative 
site..  UCLA ISAP ’s Data Safety and Monitoring Board  consists of a standing chair and [ADDRESS_81289] one medical doctor 
and a biostatistician.  William Burdon, PhD., serves as DSMB Chairperson. DS MB members include: Mary -
Lynn Brecht, PhD.,  Mitchell Karno, PhD., Nena Messina, PhD., Ardis Moe, M.D. , and Peter Friedmann, 
M.D., M.P.H. (Brown University).   
 The DSMB  will conduct a review of the init ial study protocol to ensure that  certain elements are in 
place and then  meet twice a year or more frequently as needed in order to review and monitor this proto col.  
The DSMB may provide recommendations to improve upon the protocol. Each protocol includes a detailed 
Data Safety and Monit oring Plan (DSMP). DSMPs typi[INVESTIGATOR_74538]. 
In general, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_74539] c onditions: 1) there is clear evidence of harm or 
harmful side -effects of the treatment; 2) there is not likelihood of demonstrating treatment benefit; 3) there is 
overwhelming evidence of the benefit of the treatment.   Following review, the DSMB Chair issu es a written 
letter to the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_74540], modifications based on specific committee concerns, or termination of the study in 
the event of overwhelmingly signi ficant efficacy differences between groups or unacceptable adverse 
events. PIs are advised to include these letters with their IRB continuing applications and their annual 
funding agency progress reports.  
Protocol v3.6  X.O.R. : Extended -Release Naltrexone Opi[INVESTIGATOR_74427]-entry  
 
Page 23 of 29 The current trial is not blinded, so the DSMB would be able to compare the outcome of the two 
groups during each review without decoding the patient’s group and determine whether the study should 
have an early termination. However because we are comparing alternative paradigms involving a study 
medication (XR -NTX) or community treatment ( ETAU,  MTP) that are already FDA -approved as opi[INVESTIGATOR_74456], and regarding which our own preliminary data do not suggest significant safety considerations, 
early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_74541] (yes/no) is not anticipated in this trial.

Institute Inc. (FRI), [LOCATION_001] University (NYU), and the University of [LOCATION_004], Los Angeles (UCLA) , will 
share several core assessments and study -arms.  These shared core measures across the three sites will 
have a shared SOMATICS Statistical  Analysis Plan including primary/secondary outcome measures and its 
statistical methodology that is separate from  our individual sites plan  and described in the DSMP below.  
 
III. Quality Assurance  
A. Procedures in Place to Ensure the Validity and Integrity of the Data  
Study clinicians and research staff will undergo the same baseline training at the inception of the 
study. The Program/ Project Manager and Data Management staff will ensure the quality of the clinicians’ 
and the research assistants’ administration of study assessments and instruments and of integrity of the 
data recorded through regular reviews and on -going data monitoring.  Integrity of collected data (Reviewer 
1): The identification key linking the separate charts containing the Informed Consent document and patient 
identifiers (name, signature, DOB, address, phone numbers) and the assessment instrument s and study 
dataset will be stored in a locked cabinet (paper copy) as well as on a password -protected file stored on a 
secure NYUMC server, accessible only to the study staff.  The study dataset will be otherwise de -identified 
and securely stored as descr ibed below.  Only authorized study staff will have access to the dataset.  All 
reasonable requests for data -sharing will be accommodated after study close (see Resource and Data 
Sharing Plan).  
B. Procedures to Guarantee the Accuracy, Completeness, and Conf identiality of the Data during 
Data Collection,  
Entry, Transmission, and Analysis  
Accuracy and completeness of the data will be ensured by [CONTACT_74585]/HHC CTSI and NYULMC 
Clinical Research Informatics and Data Management Unit (CRIDM), led by [CONTACT_74572], M. Ed., and as 
described in the Research Plan. Study data will be managed by [CONTACT_74586] a 
customized  web-based e -research platform. Data will be entered using laptops with secure wireless 
broadband internet cards  or access points  connected to the NYUMC network , encrypted, and transmitted to 
CRIDM servers at NYUMC. All data analyses for the study will be performed by [CONTACT_46134], Eugene 
Laska PhD , and the PI, Joshua D. Lee MD MSc . Quality control is perform ed as the data are being entered, 
and then at further stages of the storage and management process.  
IV. Regulatory Issues  
A. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Protocol v3.6  X.O.R. : Extended -Release Naltrexone Opi[INVESTIGATOR_74427]-entry  
 
Page 24 of 29 Death, disability, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongation hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]), congenital defects, and life 
threatening events including drug overdose will be deemed serious adverse events (SAEs) and immediately 
reported (orally and by [CONTACT_6791]) to the NYU School of Med icine Institutional Review Board (IRB), at the time they 
are identified by [CONTACT_74587].  In addition, a written report will be filed within 72  hours 
to the IRB and to the NIDA  program office (and FDA as indicated by [CONTACT_74588])  and medical 
review officer . When additional clinical information becomes available, a follow -up and/or final SAE report 
will be filed with the IRB, NIH, and the FDA (if indicated).  
B. Reporting of IRB Actions to NIH/NIDA  
The initial IRB approval wi ll be forwarded to NIH for review, as will all subsequent approvals and any 
amendments to the protocol , as appropriate and/or requested.  All proposed protocol amendments will be 
presented to the IRB and communicated to the NIH project officer if approved , as appropriate and/or 
requested .  Original amendment approvals will be maintained in the  regulatory file.   Major protocol changes 
such as the NIDA SOMATICS U01 collaborative will be undertaken in close communication with the NIH 
program officer.   
C. Repo rt of Changes or Amendments to the Protocol  
All proposed changes/amendments to the protocol will be filed with the IRB , and major protocol 
changes will be  forwarded to the NIH project officer, and the original amendment approvals will be filed in 
the prima ry document manual.  
D. Interim Analysis and Trial Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_74542], DSMB, and NYUMC IRB will examine any study -related SAEs on an urgent basis.  Other 
safety data will be monitored on an on -going basis by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_74543] -annually by [CONTACT_4318].  Regardi ng 
relapse rates and the time -to-relapse primary outcome, these rates will be examined semi -annually in this 
non-blinded study.  It is expected ETAU  participants will experience shorter time -to-event and higher 
relapse rates, which would not prompt consideration of trial stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007].    
E. Disclosure of Any Conflict of Interest in the DSMB  
The investigator, co -investigators, and members of the DSMB will r eport on an annual basis or more 
frequently if indicated any conflicts of interest or apparent conflicts of interest to the NIH project officer. On 
an annual basis, the above individuals will sign a disclosure statement.  There are currently no declared 
conflicts of interest with the proposed study among all Key Personnel.   
V. Trial Safety  
A. Potential Risks and Benefits for Participants  
Potential risks  See above  for risks in all arms . Risks are primarily well -defined risks of XR -NTX and 
those of continued  drug use despi[INVESTIGATOR_74544].  Participants will be educated 
regarding these risks during the informed consent process.  
Potential benefits  (each arm)  
XR-NTX:  Participants will possibly benefit by [CONTACT_26777] a medication that is FDA -approved for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573] -
addiction and has shown good efficacy for preventing relapse to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]  (heroin)  use. In addition, participants 
in this arm will receive enhanced counseling and referrals to treatment programs that they would not 
otherwise receive prior to release . They will receive a reasonable yet non -coercive sum of money for their 
time at each study visit ($20/visit at two jail visits, $25 -75/visit at follow -up visits . Lastly, participants will be 
seen for all study visits at a large tertiary academic center  (NYU/ Bellevue), with a wide menu of medical, 
mental health, and addiction treatment programs available regardless of an individual’s ability to pay . 
ETAU : Participants in this arm will receive enhanced counseling and referral s to treatment programs 
that they would not otherwise receive prior to release , though will not receive a study medication.  Like the 
XR-NTX treatment arm, they will receive compensation for time and travel and follow -up visits at Bellevue.    
Methadone Treatment Program : Participants in this arm will also receive enhanced counseling and 
referrals that they would not otherwise receive prior to release , in addition to usual care methadone 
treatment and referrals . They will receive the same compensation for  time and travel and follow -up visits at 
Bellevue.  
B. Collection and Reporting of AEs and SAEs  
All adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be captured on the appropriate 
adverse event source documents and entered into the database. All SAEs will be reported to DSMB 
Protocol v3.6  X.O.R. : Extended -Release Naltrexone Opi[INVESTIGATOR_74427]-entry  
 
Page 25 of 29 members within 72 hours after they occur as well as to the IRB (and if indicated to the FDA) as described 
above. Collection and reporting of AEs and SAEs will be reviewed on a semi -annual basis, and a report will 
be prepared f or the study record and DSMB. After the proper authorities (IRBs, NIH, FDA when appropriate, 
DSMB members) are notified of any SAE, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -investigators will convene a meeting to examine 
clinical events leading up to the SAE to determine what, if an y, immediate procedures should be put in 
place to ensure that a repeat of this SAE does not occur. Guidance will be sought from the NIH project 
office and DSMB members, and guidance may well be issued from the IRB as well. Any changes in 
procedures could i nvolve protocol amendments, and such amendments would subject to the procedures as 
noted above.  
C. Confidentiality  
Participants’ paper records at NYU/Bellevue are in locked files in locked rooms in areas that are 
locked during holidays, weekends, and non -working hours. Study material at Rikers Islands are of course 
even more secure, as only authorized clinical and administrative personnel are allowed access to the jail 
medical clinic areas, which are monitored 24/7 by [CONTACT_74589].  At NYU/Bellevue,  security personnel 
are on -duty in our building 24 hours a day and make routine observations in research areas multiple times 
during work/non -work hours. De -identified (no personal identifying information) databases are stored on 
secure servers and passwor d-protected laptops.  No specific or general subject information will be left in 
public access areas, and no oral communication regarding subjects with identifiers will be made in any 
public areas. Research staff have been given extensive training in new, required HIPAA regulations.  
 Participant’s study status will not be shared, communicated, or otherwise available to correctional, 
parole, probation, or judicial authorities without the expressed written consent of the individual participant.  
Every measure  will be taken to make study participation voluntary, anonymous, and non -coercive, in 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_74545].   
VI. Trial Effectiveness  
The primary outcome is based on longitudinal treatment retention and self -reported drinking 
calendar measures (Timeline Follow Back). This is not an efficacy study but rather a pragmatic comparative 
effectiveness study designed to compare alternate forms of approved naltrexone medication  as part of 
primary care -based Medical Management.  
VII. DSM Plan Administration  
The principal investigator, [CONTACT_6321], will have overall responsibility for data analysis and 
management. [CONTACT_6321] will have overall responsibility for safety and data monitoring on a day -to-day basis at 
the two clinical sites. The DSMB, as noted below, will provide guidance and input on a semi -annual or as -
needed basis. The members of the DSMB will be responsible for monitoring the trial.  
VIII. Frequency of DSM Report  
Safety data will be review by [CONTACT_48569]. There will be an 
annual analysis of efficacy data by [CONTACT_74590][INVESTIGATOR_74546]. A Data Safety Monitoring Board 
report will be issued to the NIDA project officer every six months.  
IX. Content of the DSM Report  
An annual data safety monitoring report will be submitted to the NIH project officer and will include, 
but may not b e limited to, a synopsis of the trial, socio -demographic characteristics of subjects accrued, 
retention and disposition of subjects, quality assurance issues regulatory issues, and reports of AEs/SAEs.  
X. DSMB Plan  
The ISAP DSMB at UCLA will oversee all  ongoing protocol review, including data, protocol 
compliance, safety and efficacy data, in compliance with NIH and NYU  guidelines. All board members will 
meet NIH requirements regarding background and experience, and none will have ethical conflicts, 
including financial interest related to study outcome. Individuals invited to serve on the board will disclose 
any potential  conflicts in writing. The board will meet every six months (unless more frequent meetings are 
deemed necessary). [CONTACT_6321] and other research personnel report on the trial status, followed by a closed 
session under the direction of the DSMB chairperson, dur ing which time the investigators and research 
team may be present. This will be followed by [CONTACT_74591]. Issues 
discussed may include those related to subject safety and benefit, whether the primary study question is 
Protocol v3.6  X.O.R. : Extended -Release Naltrexone Opi[INVESTIGATOR_74427]-entry  
 
Page [ADDRESS_81290], confidentiality, and ongoing study review (including AEs, SAEs, and 
regulatory issues). Following each DSMB meeting, recommendations will be made by [CONTACT_74592]. 
Lee and a final report (edited by [CONTACT_74593] s) will be prepared and submitted to NIH, the NYUMC 
IRB, and (if required) the FDA.

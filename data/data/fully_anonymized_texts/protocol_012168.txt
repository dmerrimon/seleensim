CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP-MED-002-AD-2, Version 3 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS 
Study Title A prospective, Phase 3, multi-center, single-arm, imaging study 
investigating the safety and diagnostic performance of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) 
PET ligand in men with suspected prostate cancer recurrence based on 
elevated PSA following prior therapy 
Protocol Number BED-PSMA-302 
Phase 3 
Sponsor Blue Earth Diagnostics 
Funding 
Organization Blue Earth Diagnostics Ltd 
Study Design This is a prospective, Phase 3, multi-center, single-arm, single dose study 
designed to evaluate the safety and diagnostic performance of radiohybrid 
prostate-specific membrane antigen (rhPSMA)-7.3 (fluorine-18 [18F]) 
positron emission tomography (PET) ligand for imaging in men with 
suspected biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer (PCa) based on 
elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) following prior therapy. 
A number of measures have now been put in place to streamline the study for 
 safety due to the continued impact of the Corona Virus Disease- 19 
(COVID-19) pandemic on daily life. 
Patients with a diagnosis of BCR of PCa being worked up for re- staging and 
eligible for potential salvage treatment will be consented and enrolled. After 
enrollment (either before or after conventional imaging if not already 
completed), patients will receive 8 mCi (296 MBq) ± 20% rhPSMA-7.3 (18F), 
delivered as an intravenous (IV) bolus injection, followed by [CONTACT_7816]. 
If feasible, the patient will undergo image-guided biopsy of a PET- positive 
lesion(s) suspi[INVESTIGATOR_350558] 45 days following  
rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET imaging. Note: due to the COVID- 19 pandemic, this 
may be extended up to 60 days.   
If necessary, confirmatory imaging (for Standard of Truth [SoT]) will be 
performed within 45 days following rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET imaging or 
attempted biopsy and, if necessary, additional follow- up confirmatory 
imaging may be performed up to 90 days after rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET.  
Patients may receive salvage treatment following further consultation with 
their physician (outside of the scope of this study). The s alvage treatment 
prescribed will be recorded. If treatment consists of a surgical resection, the 
histology obtained will be correlated with rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET imaging  
(and will serve as the SoT for PET-positive lesions resected). Follow- up 
confirmatory imaging, as part of the SoT algorithm, should not delay the 
 
Notes: due to the COVID-19 pandemic, biopsy and surgical procedures  
performed to obtain SoT histology and initial confirmatory imaging  
assessments (in patients not undergoing biopsy/resection) may be delayed up 
to Day 60 to ensure the safety (i.e., decreased potential exposure to severe 
acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) of enrolled 
patients. In patients with multiple PET-positive regions, confirmation of at  
least one PET- positive lesion in each region is required either by 
[CONTACT_9256]/surgical resection or confirmatory imaging. 
Safety (adverse events [AEs] and vital signs) will be monitored during the 
study. 
Study BED-PSMA-302, Protocol Version 4, 23-Oct-[ADDRESS_435717] Detection Rate (CDR) and region level positive predictive value 
(PPV) of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET for BCR of PCa using histopathology or 
imaging as a SoT. The CDR is defined as the percentage of all patients 
scanned who have at least one True Positive (TP) lesion (localized 
correspondence between rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET imaging and the reference 
standard) regardless of any coexisting False Positive (FP) findings . When 
determining the region level PPV, all rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET- positive regions 
will be categorized as TP or FP regions using histopathology or imaging.  
Regions will include the prostate bed, pelvic lymph nodes, and other (bone, 
extra- pelvic lymph nodes, viscera and other soft tissues); a region will be 
categorized as a TP region if at least one PET- positive lesion in the region is 
confirmed as a TP. For the primary analysis, pelvic lymph nodes will include 
the right and left external iliac, obturator, hypogastric (internal iliac), 
perirectal and presacral lymph node groups.  
The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) receptor is over- expressed 
in the majority of PCa. Although not approved in any country or region, 
PSMA PET tracers have been used in many centers around the world to image 
PCa patients. Initial results have demonstrated promising diagnostic 
performance. Most trials investigating diagnosti c PSMA ligands have thus far 
focused on patients with prior negative conventional imaging. Going forward 
in routine clinical care, given the low sensitivities of these conventional 
imaging procedures, it is difficult to continue to support subjecting patie nts 
to two or three non- sensitive imaging procedures before the patient may 
receive a more sensitive one. 
rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) injection is a PET ligand for the detection of PCa . 
rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) has already been administered to patients at the Technical 
University of Munich (TUM). Based on the retrospectively determined high 
sensitivity of PSMA ligands, this study is designed to establish the diagnostic  
performance of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET irrespective of the findings of 
conventional imaging in order to support the use of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) as an 
imaging option during the initial workup of these patients.

Investigational 
Product(s), 
Including Control 
Products IP: 8 mCi (296 MBq) ± 20% rhPSMA-7.3 (18F), delivered as an IV bolus 
injection with a [ADDRESS_435718] 0.9% sodium chloride flush. 
Control: none. 
Study and 
Participant Duration Study Duration: The total study duration from first site activation to data 
analysis is estimated to be 18 months. 
Participant Duration: Patients will be screened for in clusion into the study up 
to 28 days before rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET imaging ( up to 45 days due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic) and remain as a participant until histology or 
confirmatory imaging data has been obtained in order to satisfy the SoT 
assessment. The last visit will be the End of Study assessment which will take 
place within 45 days following administration of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) for 
patients requiring follow-up procedures (may be extended up to 60 days due 
to the COVID-19 pandemic) or for patients requiring additional confirmatory 
imaging procedure, up to 90 days after rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET. 
Planned Interim 
Analyses No formal hypothesis testing interim analysis will be performed. 
Once 60% of the planned [ADDRESS_435719] information, the proportion 
of patients with a PSA <1 ng/mL will be assessed. If this proportion exceeds 
60% then investigators will be informed t o stop further enrolment of this 
cohort. 
STATISTICS: 
Primary Analysis 
Plan and Rationale 
for Number of 
Patients The co- primary endpoints for the study are the patient level CDR and the 
region level PPV of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET. The joint hypothesis is as 
follows: H 0 1: CDR >36 .5% and PPV 
>62.5%. 
Both primary endpoints will be summarized as a percentage together with a 
two-sided exact 95% confidence interval (CI) for each reader. In addition, a 
one-sided exact binomial test p- value will be provided for each reader for 
each CDR. As this is a by-region endpoint patient s may have one to three 
regions that may be included in the PPV assessment. The one- sided test based 
on clustered binary data will be used to evaluate the PPV hypothesis ( Zhou, 
Study BED-PSMA-302, Protocol Version 4, 23-Oct-2020 Page 14 of 55
 
CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP-MED-002-AD-2, Version 3 Obuchowski, and McClish (2002), pg. 104 ) to adjust the variance estimates 
in the analysis based on clustering of regions within a patient . For the study 
to be considered a success, the p- values for both endpoints must be 
statistically significant for at least two out of the three readers (same readers 
for both CDR and PPV).  
In the overall study population, the detection rate of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET 
is expected to be approximately 60%, the overall PPV is estimated to be 
73.5%, and the o verall CDR is anticipated to be 49% (point estimates). The 
lower bound of the CI for the region level PPV will be set at 62.5% and the 
overall CDR will have a lower bound of 36.5%. The study will aim to include 
approximately 40% of patients with a PSA level <1 ng/mL and approximately 
60% of patients with a PSA level  ng/mL. 
Approximately [ADDRESS_435720] and assuming a true 
PPV of 73.5%, a sample size of 190 positive cases provides >88% power for 
the evaluation of region level PPV (H 0 %). Assuming that 60% of 
all scans have a positive finding, a total of approximately 316 evaluable 
patients would be required to obtain 190 positive rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET 
cases. Note that PPV region- based analysis is expected to provide more than 
88% power based upon the number of positive regions per patient being >1, 
even adjusting for the correlation between the regions within a patient. Thus, 
[ADDRESS_435721] 190 cases with 
disease detected with rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) and an evaluable result. 
For the patient level CDR endpoint, based on a one- sided 0.[ADDRESS_435722] of 49%, a sample size of 316 cases 
provides >99% power for the evaluation of CDR (H [ADDRESS_435723] 90% power for the 
regional PPV analysis. 
Dropouts who fail to complete all study procedures , for reasons other than 
due to adverse reactions/AEs deemed related to IP, will be withdrawn from 
the study and w ill be replaced. No more than 15% of patients enrolled will be 
replaced. 
Secondary and exploratory endpoints will be summarized descriptively , with 
the exception of consistency of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) scan interpretation by 
[CONTACT_350573]. Two-sided 95% CIs will be presented, where applicable.

 Notes: 
* In patients with multiple PET-positive regions, confirmation of at least one PET-positive lesion in each region is required 
either by [CONTACT_9256]/surgical resection or confirmatory imaging in order to calculate the region level PPV for the efficacy 
analyses. 
** In patients with multiple lesions in a specific region, the presence of one TP lesion determines truth for the region 
regardless of any concurrent FP findings in the same region. Therefore, multiple PET-positive lesions can be evaluated 
in a specific region in order to confirm at least one TP.

antigen (rhPSMA)-7.3 injection, a positron emission tomography (PET) ligand for the 
detection of prostate cancer (PCa). 
It is designed to target the extracellular epi[INVESTIGATOR_350560]-specific membrane antigen 
(PSMA) molecule and is administered as a single intravenous (IV) bolus microdose (i.e. the 
mass dose administered is less than 100 µg/patient). 
The molecular structure of the drug substance comprises a PSMA binding motif, a peptide 
spacer, an 18F-radiolabeled silicon fluoride acceptor moiety and a gallium chelator complex 
(Figure 2 ). 
1.1 Overview of Non-clinical Studies 
A non-clinical biodistribution and dosimetry study has been performed (Internal report: 
BEDPSMADEV002), in which 100 pmol rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) (N=27) was administered to 
severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) male mice. Animals were sacrificed at 10, 60, 120, 
[ADDRESS_435729]-administration, with urine and blood samples collected immediately 
after sacrifice and tissues harvested and weighed for the measurement of 18F radioactivity. 
Human dosimetry was calculated by [CONTACT_350576]. The data 
demonstrated that for rhPSMA-7.3 (18F), the largest accumulation of radioactivity was in the 
kidney, spleen, lung, liver and heart. Clearance from the blood and clearance to the urine was 
rapid for rhPSMA-7.3 (18F), but there was a relatively slow build-up of radioactivity in the 
kidney. Using a 3.5-hour bladder voiding interval, as recommended by [CONTACT_350577] (ICRP; ICRP, 1992 ), the effective dose for humans extrapolated from the animal data was 21.7 µSv/MBq for rhPSMA-7.3 (18F). Using a 1.0-hour 
bladder voiding interval, based on the time at which patients will be encouraged to void in the 
clinical setting, the effective dose for humans was 12.8 µSv/MBq. Based on these data, an 
injection of 8 mCi (296 MBq) for a clinical scan would result in a favorable radiation effective 
dose of less than 5 mSv, assuming a 1-hour voiding interval. 
Consistent with the development of a radiodiagnostic agent, rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) is not designed 
to elicit pharmacological activity and an in vitro  secondary pharmacology screen has confirmed

CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP-MED-002-AD-2, Version 3 there is no unintended pharmacological activity in a panel of 44 potential targets. A 
concentration of 5 µg/mL was used in the in vitro  pharmacology profiling which compares to 
a maximum concentration in human plasma of 0.04 µg/mL  (based on 2500 mL plasma and a 
maxim um human dose of 100 µg).  In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_350561]-7.3 at IV dosages of 
0, 0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg, the no-observed-adverse-effect-level was the maximum dose 
administered of 10 mg/kg (allometrically scaled human dose equivalent of 1.6 mg/kg). This 
represents a 1000-fold multiple of the maximum clinical microdose of 100 µg based on a 60 
kg human. No target organs of toxicity were identified. Systemic exposure demonstrated rat 
plasma concentrations above the intended maximum human actual dose. In vitro  protein 
binding in rat and human indicated moderate binding of 75% and 82% in rat and human, 
respectively, with no concentration dependence. In vitro  human cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
reaction phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_350562]-7.3 is not metabolized. In vitro  rhPSMA-7.3 does not 
inhibit or induce human CYP isoforms and is not a substrate or inhibitor of human drug 
transporters suggesting drug interaction with rhPSMA-7.3 is unlikely.

are provided in the rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) . 
1.2 Overview of Clinical Studies 
Although no PSMA-targeted imaging agents are licensed as radiodiagnostic agents for use in 
either Europe or the [LOCATION_002] (US), they are widely used by [CONTACT_350578] ( Rowe, 
2018 ). This includes use of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), 
(exempt from a manufacturing 
authorization as per Section 13, Subsection 2b of the German Medicinal Products Act). In a 
retrospective, non-interventional review of data from patients (N=558) with known or 
suspected PCa who underwent a clinically indicated rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET/computed 
tomography (CT) or PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at TUM, diagnostic 
performance, biodistribution and safety data for rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) were analyzed (Study BED-PSMA-403 ). Data sources included hospi[INVESTIGATOR_350563], as well as routine 
follow-up data. Given the retrospective nature of the data collection, informed consent was not 
obtained from each individual patient; thus, routine clinical data included in the study database 
were totally anonymized and only aggregated anonymized data from chart review were 
available for analysis.  
A total of 558 patients, with known or suspected PCa, underwent a clinically indicated 
rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET/CT or PET/MRI scan at TUM between [ADDRESS_435730] 2018 and 
15 February 2019. Based on the retrospective chart review, rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) was 
well-tolerated, with no safety concerns identified. A total of 285 consecutive patients with 
biochemical recurrence (BCR) of PCa were analyzed. Overall, 225/285 (79%) had positive 
findings on rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET imaging. The detection rates were 58%, 83%, and 97% for 
patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of <1 ng/mL, 1 to <2 ng/mL, and  ng/mL, respectively.  
Further details of the  clinical studies performed or planned for rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) are provided 
in the rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) IB.  
[ADDRESS_435731] leading cause of 
death ( Jemal 2011 ). It is most commonly diagnosed in men aged [ADDRESS_435732]-2020 Page 19 of 55
 
CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP-MED-002-AD-2, Version 3 diagnosis is often made following the detection of elevated PSA and/or an abnormal digital 
rectal examination, with confirmation of this diagnosis by [CONTACT_350579]. PSA is used as a 
tumor marker and serum levels of PSA positively correlated with the risk of metastatic disease 
or subsequent disease recurrence or progression. 
The PSMA receptor is a 100 kD transmembrane glycoprotein that is over-expressed in the 
majority of PCa ( Israeli 1994; Silver 1997; Osborne 2013 ). Peptidomimetic glu-ureido-based PSMA inhibitors, initially described in 2001 ( Kozikowski 2001 ), bind to a carboxypeptidase 
active site on the extracellular motif of the PSMA receptor. In the last [ADDRESS_435733] imaged patients using PSMA PET tracers based on this targeting 
technology ( Perera 2016 ). Whilst these initial results have demonstrated promising diagnostic 
performance, there remains no licensed or approved PSMA PET imaging agent.  
rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) injection, is a PET ligand for the detection of PCa. The rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) 
stereoisomer has already been administered to patients at the TUM ( see Section 1.2 ). Several 
hundred patients with PCa have been imaged clinically, which has informed the design of this 
proposed study. rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) is currently being formally evaluated by [CONTACT_350580] a Phase 1, open label, study designed to assess the safety, biodistribution and 
internal radiation dosimetry of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) injection in healthy volunteers, and to assess 
safety and investigate the imaging characteristics in patients with PCa (Study BED-PSMA-
101; EudraCT No. 2018-004703-39). 
As described in Section 1.2, the detection rate of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) varies depending on the 
PSA level at scanning. The findings at TUM are consistent with the recently published paper 
(Fendler 2019 ), describing the use of gallium-68 (68Ga)-PSMA-11 in 635 patients with BCR irrespective of the results of other imaging. They reported an overall detection rate of 75%, but 
stratifying for PSA levels, the detection rates were 45%, 84%, 86%, and 97% for patients with 
PSA levels of <1 ng/mL, 1 to <2 ng/mL, 2 to <5 ng/mL and 5 ng/mL, respectively. 
One of the major disadvantages of the (mostly retrospective) studies to date is the lack of 
confirmation of the finding on the PSMA PET scan. Although the detection rates (defined as 
the number of positive scans/all included patients) are reported, it is not known if every positive 
scan is a True Positive (TP) scan. Ideally, both the positive predictive value (PPV) and the 
Correct Detection Rate (CDR) of PET findings should be known. The CDR is defined as the 
percentage of all patients scanned who have at least one TP lesion (localized correspondence 
between rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET imaging and the reference standard) regardless of any 
coexisting False Positive (FP) findings. Unfortunately, in the Fendler (2019)  study, 
confirmation of the positive scans was only obtained in [ADDRESS_435734] cannot be determined for the entire study population. 
Based on data from the retrospective chart review, data from the Fendler (2019) study, and 
from a comprehensive review of the literature, the influence of the PSA level at the time of 
scanning on detection rate and diagnostic performance cannot be underestimated.  
 ng/mL, detection rates can range from 64% to over 
90% ( Perera 2019 ), with an average of 85%. In this multi-center US study of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) 
(without the selection bias of many of the studies referenced by [CONTACT_350581] [2019] ), an estimated 
 ng/mL. Fendler 
(2019)  reported PPVs of 92% (composite Standard of Truth [SoT]) and 84% (histopathologic 
SoT) in patients with median PSA levels of 3.5 and 3.9 ng/mL, respectively. It is expected, 
with a composite SoT including both histopathology (when available) and 18F-fluciclovine PET 
imaging (in cases without histopathology) to achieve a PPV of approximately 80% in this 
subpopulation. 
Study BED-PSMA-302, Protocol Version 4, 23-Oct-2020 Page 20 of 55
 
CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP-MED-002-AD-2, Version 3 However, in patients with a PSA level >0.2 to <1 ng/mL, PSMA scans can show detection rates 
between 46% and 63% ( Perera 2019 ), with an average of 56%. A detection rate of 57% was 
reported by [CONTACT_350582] (2019)  in patients with a PSA level of 0.5 to <1 ng/mL; this fell to 38% 
for patients with a PSA level <0.5 ng/mL. Therefore, an estimated overall detection rate of 
seen on PSMA PET imaging are TP will be challenging in this subgroup, since these lesions 
may be small, prone to biopsy error, and not yet visible on other diagnostic imaging techniques. 
In patients with PSA levels <1 ng/mL and histopathologic data, the PPV is likely to be well 
below the 92% reported by [CONTACT_350582] (2019)  for a group of patients with a median PSA level of 
3.9 ng/mL. Additionally, no patients in this subgroup will have an intact prostate amenable to 
biopsy and we might expect only ~50% concordance between one example imaging reference 
standard test - 18F-fluciclovine - and PSMA PET-positive patients ( Calais 2019). Therefore, 
the PPV (using histopathology or conventional/confirmatory imaging as the SoT) is expected 
to be low, at approximately 65%. It is important to note that PSMA PET may be a more 
sensitive way of demonstrating disease in men with recurrent PCa, as compared to conventional 
imaging-based SoT ( Perera 2016 ). Importantly, the overall PPV will also likely be decreased 
by [CONTACT_350583]-positive regions given histological confirmation of 
multiple lesions in the same patient is highly unlikely. 
Most trials investigating diagnostic PSMA ligands have thus far focused on those patients with 
prior negative conventional imaging. Going forward in routine clinical care, given the low 
sensitivities of these conventional imaging procedures, it is difficult to continue to support 
subjecting patients to two or three non-sensitive imaging procedures before the patient may 
receive a more sensitive one. Based on the retrospectively determined high sensitivity of PSMA 
ligands ( Afshar-Oromieh 2015; Eiber 2015; Afshar-Oromieh 2017 ), this study is designed to 
establish the performance of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET irrespective of the findings of 
conventional imaging in order to support the use of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) as an imaging option 
during the initial workup of these patients. This study will do so acknowledging the limitations 
of obtaining proof of true-positivity of the PSMA-positive lesions given the difficulties of 
obtaining histopathology in all patients and the relative insensitivity of other imaging 
modalities. Therefore, CDR and PPV are set at reasonable threshold levels, accounting for the 
limitations of the SoT and considperformance. 
2.1 Risk-benefit Assessment 
2.1.1 Benefits 
The rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET scans may provide further clinical information regarding the 
by [CONTACT_350584]. If such 
information arises, this will be reported back to the responsible clinician to help direct the 
 
2.1.[ADDRESS_435735] transmission scan (when the PET scan is 
acquired on a PET/CT scanner). Intravenous injection carries a small risk of infection and 
hematoma. 
rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) is currently being formally evaluated by [CONTACT_350585]. in a 
Phase 1, open-label study designed to assess the safety, biodistribution, and internal radiation 
dosimetry of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) injection in healthy volunteers, and to assess safety and

CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP-MED-002-AD-2, Version 3 investigate the imaging characteristics in patients with PCa (Study BED-PSMA-101; 
EudraCT No. 2018-004703-39). The biodistribution and internal radiation dosimetry of 18F 
following the IV administration of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) injection have been assessed in a cohort 
of six healthy adult volunteers (three male and three female; aged 25 to 64 years; all White). 
Subjects were scanned at intervals for up to [ADDRESS_435736] measured at each timepoint. The mean administered dose of 
radioactivity was 220 MBq. 18F excretion into urine was 7.7% of the administered activity at 
[ADDRESS_435737] mean initial uptake of 
18F were liver, heart content, and cortical bone. The critical organs (i.e. those with the highest 
absorbed dose per unit administered activity) were the adrenals (0.1835 mGy/MBq), the 
kidneys (0.1722 mGy/MBq) and the submandibular glands (0.1479 mGy/MBq). The mean 
effective dose per unit administered activity was 13.8 µSv/MBq with a 1 -hour voiding interval 
and 14.1 µSv/MBq with a 3.5 -hour voiding interval. Based on these data, an injection of 8 mCi 
(296 MBq) would result in a favorable radiation effective dose of less than 5 mSv. 
No serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported and no adverse events (AEs) led to subject 
withdrawal from the study. A total of five AEs were reported in two subjects (gastroenteritis, 
focal liver lesion, headache, and dizziness for one subject and headache for a second subject). 
All events, except one case of headache, were considered unrelated to study treatment and all 
events, except the case of focal liver lesion, resolved or recovered. 
In the current study, the maximum effective dose due to the CT transmission scan on a PET/CT 
scanner will vary from site-to-site, but as a guide a dose of [ADDRESS_435738] acquisition will be in accordance with ALARA ( As Low As 
Reasonably Achievable ) principles. The estimated total dose of 12 mSv (PET and CT 
transmission scan) is in line with other common nuclear medicine procedures. 
If rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET shows one or more sites of recurrence and if clinically feasible, the 
most accessible lesions(s) will be biopsied under radiological guidance. 
A CT-guided biopsy may be required in these patients; mean effective doses of between 4.[ADDRESS_435739] been reported ( Guberina, 2018 ) during CT-guided biopsies and is dependent on the organ region and CT-scanner generation. A biopsy will cause discomfort and pain and may 
incidentally lead to complications, like prolonged bleeding at the site of the biopsy or infection.  
Confirmatory imaging may include the use of diagnostic CT or PET (see Section 9.1.6). 
Examples of effective doses from such procedures are as follows: abdominal/pelvic CT 6 to 
8 mSv ( McCollough, 2015 ); chest CT 7 mSv ( McCollough, 2015 ); 18F-sodium fluoride (NaF) 
PET 8.9 mSv ( Beheshti, 2015 ); Axumin (18F-Fluciclovine) PET 8 mSv (Axumin USPI; 
Axumin SmPC). 
As with all imaging techniques there is the risk that the PET scan may provide a FP image 
(giving the appearance of cancer) in sites where it is not present, due to other events in the body 
or False Negative (failing to detect a nidus of cancer). Thus, patients should continue to be 
reviewed and may require other investigations, to confirm scan findings. 
As described in Section 1.2, as of 15 February 2019, rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) has been administered 
 men with known or 
suspected PCa, including 285 patients with BCR of PCa after radical prostatectomy (RP) and 
radiation therapy (RT)/brachytherapy. Although 35 out of 146 patients with documents in their 
electronic medical records within 30 days after rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) injection had AEs or SAEs, 
there were no reports of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions attributed to injection of 
rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) (Study BED-PSMA-403 ).

is defined as the percentage of all patients scanned who have at least one TP lesion (localized 
correspondence between rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET imaging and the reference standard) 
regardless of any coexisting FP findings. When determining the region level PPV, all 
rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET-positive regions will be categorized as TP or FP regions using 
histopathology or imaging.  
3.2 Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives of the study are to: 
1.Assess the patient level CDR and region level PPV of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET in the 
subgroup of patients who have negative baseline conventional imaging. 
2.Assess the patient level CDR and region level PPV of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET separated 
into subgroups of patients with reference standard histopathology available and 
unavailable. 
3.Assess the patient level CDR and region level PPV of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET stratified 
by [CONTACT_40609]. 
4.Assess the CDR of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET on a region level. 
5.Assess the impact of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) results on the intended clinical management of 
study participants using a clinician survey. 
6.Assess the inter- and intra-reader agreement of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) scan interpretation by 
[CONTACT_350586]. 
7.Assess the safety of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) injection in patients. 
3.3 Exploratory Objectives 
The exploratory objectives of the study are to:  
1.Assess the overall detection rate (without SoT confirmation) on a patient level and 
including detection rate subgroup analyses of patients: a) who have negative baseline 
conventional imaging, b) with reference standard histopathology available and 
unavailable, and also detection rate stratified by [CONTACT_350587]. 
2.Assess the patient level PPV in which a TP patient is defined as having at least one TP 
region, regardless of any coexisting FP regions. 
3.Assess the impact of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET on upstaging patients with BCR of PCa 
a) post-RP or b) post-RT compared to conventional imaging. 
4.Assess patient and regional level detection rates of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET. 
5.Assess patient and regional level detection rates of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET as a function 
of PSA, prior Gleason score, and PSA doubling time (PSAdt) in a) post-RP or 
b) post-RT patients.

CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP-MED-002-AD-2, Version 3 4 STUDY DESIGN 
4.1 Study Overview 
This is a prospective, Phase 3, multi-center, single-arm, diagnostic imaging study designed to 
evaluate the safety and diagnostic performance of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET ligand for imaging 
in men with suspected BCR of PCa based on elevated PSA following prior therapy. 
Given the different performance of PSMA ligands in patients with PSA levels <1 ng/mL versus 
 ng/mL, the patient population will be weighted to prevent overrepresentation of patients 
with a PSA <1 ng/mL. The proportion of patients with a PSA <1 ng/mL will be maximized at 
approximately 40%, consistent with the study population studied by [CONTACT_350582] (2019) . Once 60% 
of the planned [ADDRESS_435741] information, the proportion of patients with a PSA 
<1 ng/mL will be assessed. If this proportion exceeds 60% then investigators will be informed 
to stop further enrolment of this cohort (see Section 16.7 ).  
Patients with a diagnosis of BCR of PCa being worked up for re-staging and eligible for 
potential salvage treatment will be consented and enrolled. Patients will be screened at Visit 1 
to determine eligibility for the study up to 28 days (up to 45 days due to the Corona Virus 
Disease-19 [COVID-19] pandemic) before rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET imaging at Visit 2. Patients 
who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be assigned a 
patient identifier (ID) and entered into the study at screening. Participation in this study does 
not replace conventional imaging required for staging as per local guidelines/standard of care. 
If not already completed within [ADDRESS_435742] of care conventional imaging 
will be performed following Visit 1 and up to 2 weeks after Visit 2 (Optional Visit 2(a)). 
Conventional imaging that has been performed at non-participating institutions will be 
accepted provided the scans are reviewed by [CONTACT_30604]. Patients will be asked 
to provide historical imaging if available and if performed as part of their PCa care and 
follow-up. After enrollment (either before or after conventional imaging if not already 
completed), patients will receive an administered activity of 8 mCi (296 MBq) ± 20% 
rhPSMA-7.3 (18F), delivered as an IV bolus injection with a [ADDRESS_435743] 0.9% sodium chloride 
flush, followed by [CONTACT_7816]. 
Note: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the screening/eligibility evaluation may take place on 
the day of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) administration (with pre-screening via telephone), if necessary, 
to ensure the safety of enrolled patients (see Visit 1 and Visit 2 combined; Section 10.3). 
Alternatively, the time from Visit 1 (initial screening) to Visit 2 (rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET scan) 
may be extended up to 45 days due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
If feasible, the patient will undergo image-guided biopsy of a PET-positive lesion(s) suspi[INVESTIGATOR_350564] 45 days following rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET imaging (see 
Section 9.1.9).  
If necessary, confirmatory imaging (for SoT) will be performed within 45 days following 
rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET imaging or attempted biopsy according to the algorithm in Figure 3 . If 
necessary, additional confirmatory imaging may be performed up to 90 days after rhPSMA-
7.3 (18F) PET. Note: in patients with multiple PET-positive regions, confirmation of at least 
one PET-positive lesion in each region is required either by [CONTACT_9256]/surgical resection or 
confirmatory imaging. Patients may receive salvage treatment following further consultation 
with their physician (outside the scope of this study). The salvage treatment prescribed will be 
recorded. If treatment consists of a surgical resection, the histology obtained will be correlated 
with rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET imaging. Follow-up confirmatory imaging utilized as part of the 
SoT assessment should eatment.

biopsy/resection) may be delayed up to Day 60 to ensure the safety (i.e., decreased potential 
exposure  to severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) of enrolled 
patients. 
Safety (AEs and vital signs) will be monitored during the study. 
An overview of the study is provided in the study schema ( Figure 1 ). 
4.2 Key Assumptions 
Consistent with the data described in Section 2, the detection rate of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET in  ng/mL is expected to be at least 75%. The anticipated PPV in this 
population is expected to be approximately 80%. Therefore, the expected CDR in this 
subpopulation is (75% × 80% =) 60%. 
However, in the subpopulation with a PSA level <1 ng/mL, the detection rate is expected to be 
approximately 45%. The PPV is expected to be lower too (approximately 65%), since it will 
be more difficult to obtain proof of the lesions detected (as outlined in Section 2). Therefore, 
the CDR in this subpopulation is estimated to be low at (45% × 65% =) 29%. 
It is planned to include approximately 40% of patients with a PSA level <1 ng/mL and 
approximately 60% with a PSA level  ng/mL. Therefore, it is anticipated that the study will 
demonstrate an overall detection rate of approximately 60%, an overall PPV of at least 73.5% 
(taking into account multiple positive regions is anticipated in a proportion of patients), and, 
hence, an overall CDR of 49% (point estimates). 
5 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION 
5.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
The co-primary endpoints for the study are the (1) patient level CDR defined as the percentage 
of all patients scanned who have at least one TP lesion (localized correspondence between 
rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET imaging and the reference standard) regardless of any coexisting FP 
findings and (2) region level PPV (defined as TP/{TP+FP}) of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET. 
Histopathology (preferred method) or imaging will be utilized as the SoT (see Section 9.2). A 
lesion that is deemed positive for PCa based on rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET will be assessed using 
the algorithm described in Figure 3.  
5.2 Secondary Endpoints

to the study site. The investigator (or nominated deputy) will receive release information for the 
drug product. Only product for which confirmation of release has been received shall be used. 
Where the product is transported as a single patient dose, the dose will be measured in a 
radionuclide dose calibrator before administration. Where the product is transported in its 
original container the volume of injection for each patient is calculated and withdrawn into a 
shielded syringe immediately before injection. The calculation is based on the radioactive 
content, the half-life of 18F (109.8 mins), the reference date and time, the prescribed dose and the 
time of injection. 
8.4.1 Dispensing 
When the study site receives the dose and prior to administration, the activity in the syringe 
will be measured in a dose calibrator. Should the activity be less than 6.4 mCi (236 MBq) or 
the volume required exceed 10 mL (US sites) or 6 mL (European sites) undiluted material or 
the IP be past the expi[INVESTIGATOR_267377], the scan should not be performed. The dose can be 
diluted in the syringe to a maximum volume of 10 mL with 0.9% saline (as required). After 
administration, residual radioactivity in the injection device shall be measured using a 
radionuclide dose calibrator.  
8.4.2 Administration Instructions 
Patients will receive a dose with an administered activity of 8 mCi (296 MBq) ± 20%  of 
rhPSMA-7.3 (18F), delivered as an IV bolus injection with a [ADDRESS_435749] 0.9% sodium chloride 
flush, followed by [CONTACT_7816]. Full details are provided in the Study Imaging Manual.  
8.4.3 Storage 
The shelf-life of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) injection is up to [ADDRESS_435750] not be used beyond this limit. rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) injection should be stored at room 
temperature in a shielded container. 
All non-radioactive containers (shielding, transport cans) must be returned to the manufacturing 
site. Containers that are radioactive or that contained radioactive products must be disposed of at 
either the study site or another designated facility, with prior approval from the Sponsor, after 
the study and after overall drug accountability has been completed by [CONTACT_4874]. 
Waste must be disposed of according to Federal, State and local regulations for radioactive 
material. Imaging sites must comply with all applicable regulations.

order to satisfy the SoT. 
Any treatment for PCa will be in accordance with local PCa management policy and 
procedures. 
9 STUDY PROCEDURES AND GUIDELINES 
A Schedule of Events representing the required testing procedures to be performed for the 
duration of the study is summarized in Appendix 1 . 
Written informed consent will be obtained prior to conducting any study-related activities (see 
Section 18.3). Patients will provide written informed consent and be assessed for eligibility for 
study participation at screening (performed within 28 days before IP administration [or up to 
45 days due to the COVID-19 pandemic]). 
9.1 Clinical Assessments 
9.1.1 Concomitant Medications 
All concomitant medication and concurrent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_29122], with 
any changes in concomitant medication during the study recorded on the eCRF. The dose, 
route, unit frequency of administration, and indication for administration and dates of 
medication will be captured. 
9.1.2 Demographics 
Demographic information (full/partial date of birth/age, gender, ethnicity/race, sex, height, 
weight, body mass index, as permitted by [CONTACT_427]) will be recorded at screening. 
Weight will also be recorded pre-rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET.   
9.1.[ADDRESS_435752] be confirmed at screening. 
9.1.4 Vital Signs 
Vital signs (body temperature, blood pressure, pulse and respi[INVESTIGATOR_119068]) will be performed 
after resting for [ADDRESS_435753]-rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET. 
Any clinically significant changes in vital sign measurements should be reported as an AE.  
9.1.5 Conventional Imaging 
[IP_ADDRESS] Baseline Conventional Imaging 
Participation in this study does not replace conventional imaging required for staging as per 
local guidelines/standard of care. Conventional imaging may include: planar and/or 
single-photon emission CT bone scan (99mtechnetium-hydroxydiphosphate [99mTc-HDP], 
99mtechnetium-methyldiphosphonate [99mTc-MDP] per institution preference), 
abdominal/pelvic CT or MRI, chest CT per institution preference, or PET with (18F-NaF or 
Axumin). Conventional imaging that has been performed within [ADDRESS_435754] of care. 
Note: contrast-enhanced CT/MRI and radiopharmaceutical-based baseline conventional 
imaging (performed as per local standard of care) should be performed at least 24 hours apart 
from the investigational rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET scan. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Historical Conventional Imaging 
Historical conventional imaging, acquired more than 90 days before Visit 1, if available and if 
PCa staging and treatment in the prior ~24 months, can be 
used to establish SoT where a biopsy cannot be obtained.  
Patients will be asked to provide these pre-existing images, if these were done at another 
institution. If done at the study site, these images will be made available by [CONTACT_3452].  
9.1.6 Confirmatory Imaging 
In cases where historical conventional imaging is not available or inconclusive for comparison 
to baseline imaging, rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) directed (for confirmation of lesion location only) 
follow-up confirmatory imaging of the site(s), will be acquired at the discretion of the local 
investigator(s), with reference to the Study Imaging Manual. Examples of confirmatory 
imaging modalities include specific body region MRI (including functional or multi-parametric 
MRI), CT, Axumin, NaF, etc (see Sections [IP_ADDRESS]  and [IP_ADDRESS]). 
9.1.7 rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET Scan 
After enrollment (either before or after conventional imaging; see Section 9.1.5 ), all patients 
will receive an IV bolus of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) injection and undergo a PET scan as described in 
the Study Imaging Manual.  
Study BED-PSMA-302, Protocol Version 4, 23-Oct-2020 Page 31 of 55
 
CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP-MED-002-AD-2, Version 3 9.1.8 Image Interpretation 
For biopsy/SoT confirmation guidance: 
Due to logistical and medical liability considerations, results of the image interpretation 
by [CONTACT_350591]. rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET imaging will be interpreted by [INVESTIGATOR_2394]-site readers who 
have received specific training on rhPSMA-7.3 (18F). 
For determination of the primary endpoint: 
rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET images will be blinded, randomized, and read by [CONTACT_350592]-7.3 
(18F) scans and are blinded to results of conventional/confirmatory imaging. 
9.1.9 Biopsy/Surgery 
If rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET shows one or more sites of recurrence, the most accessible and 
feasible* (as judged by [CONTACT_16533]) lesion(s) will be biopsied under radiological 
guidance. In patients with multiple rhPSMA-7.[ADDRESS_435755] accessible and feasible 
lesion(s) in each region (prostate bed, pelvic lymph nodes, and other [bone, extra-pelvic lymph 
nodes, viscera and other soft tissues]).  
*Note: in addition to patient safety, assessment of feasibility may include location, but also 
lesion size, where a minimum size may be needed to avoid excessive sampling error on biopsy; 
soft tissue lesions will be preferred over bone lesions due to the higher likelihood of non-
diagnostic bone biopsies ( Didolkar 2013; Yang 2010 ). In cases where a patient will undergo a lymph node dissection or other surgical procedure 
(resection of the PET-positive lesion(s)) as part of their standard of care, a biopsy prior to the 
surgical procedure is not required. The histology obtained following surgery will serve as the 
SoT. The removed surgical samples will be carefully correlated to rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET and 
the conventional imaging technique(s). 
In cases where a biopsy is not feasible or refused by [CONTACT_102], then specific imaging may be 
used, to confirm positivity of the finding on rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET (see below Steps 2 to 4; 
Sections [IP_ADDRESS] , [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS]). Histopathology remains the preferred SoT.  
9.2 SoT 
One of the following will determine SoT: If a positive lesion on PET is confirmed by [CONTACT_350593] (1 to 4) listed below, the lesion will be considered TP. When determining the CDR 
on a patient level, a patient will be categorized as a TP if there is at least one TP lesion 
confirmed in one body region (prostate bed, pelvic lymph nodes, or other extra-pelvic sites 
[bone, viscera, lymph nodes and soft tissues]) on rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET. For the primary 
analysis, pelvic lymph nodes will include the right and left external iliac, obturator, hypogastric 
(internal iliac), perirectal and presacral lymph node groups.  
Notes:  
a.In patients with multiple PET-positive regions, confirmation of at least one PET-positive 
lesion in each region is required either by [CONTACT_9256]/surgical resection or confirmatory 
imaging in order to calculate the region level PPV for the efficacy analyses. 
b.In patients with multiple lesions in a specific region, the presence of one TP lesion 
determines truth for the region regardless of any concurrent FP findings in the same region. 
Study BED-PSMA-302, Protocol Version 4, 23-Oct-[ADDRESS_435756] one TP. 
9.2.1 Step 1: Histological SoT 
Histological confirmation, whenever possible: 
a)Of PET-positive lesion. 
b)Of surgically removed sample. 
c)Re-biopsy (in case of inconclusive histology) or biopsy of a second lesion will be allowed. 
If histology is not available or determined non-diagnostic (and re-biopsy not possible) then 
proceed with imaging confirmation as described below (Steps 2 to 4). If biopsy histology is 
negative, then images acquired during the procedure will be reviewed by [CONTACT_350594]. If local readers determine the biopsy placement was correct, 
then the biopsy results will stand. If local readers determine the targeted tissue was missed 
during the biopsy procedure, then either a re-biopsy will be performed or the following steps 
will also be undertaken to verify rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) images.  
9.2.[ADDRESS_435757] of Truth (Steps 2 to 4) 
Imaging as SoT should include a longitudinal assessment of all available conventional and 
confirmatory imaging scans. Any change over time at the PET-positive site (upon review of all 
available imaging) suggestive of the presence of cancer is accepted as the SoT. A change 
suggesting the disappearance of disease at the PET-positive site following treatment will also 
be accepted as the SoT (objective criteria defined in the study Independent Review Charter).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Step 2: Historical and Baseline Conventional Imaging SoT 
If historical conventional imaging (as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) had been acquired prior to 
PCa management, then 
these images can be used along with baseline to establish the SoT.  
Where historical conventional imaging (e.g. CT, MRI, bone scan, PET) is available that could 
be relevant to confirmation of an identified rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET-positive lesion then as 
many prior imaging series as practical (from approximately the last 2 years) should be made 
available to the central reviewers. 
In cases where historical imaging and baseline conventional imaging are deemed sufficient (by 
[CONTACT_350595]) for SoT determination, then this will be acceptable, and follow-up 
confirmatory imaging (Steps 3 and 4) will not be needed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Step 3: Confirmatory Imaging SoT (up to [ADDRESS_435758]-rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET) 
In cases where historical conventional imaging is not available or inconclusive for comparison 
to baseline imaging, rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) directed (for confirmation of lesion location only) 
follow-up confirmatory imaging of the site(s), will be acquired. Confirmatory imaging will be 
acquired at the discretion of the local investigator(s), with reference to the Study Imaging 
Manual.  
Study BED-PSMA-302, Protocol Version 4, 23-Oct-2020 Page 33 of 55
 
CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP-MED-002-AD-2, Version 3 [IP_ADDRESS] Step 4: Additional Confirmatory Imaging SoT (up to [ADDRESS_435759]-rhPSMA-7.3 
(18F) PET) 
If in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_108417](s) the above imaging Steps 2 or 3 do not allow SoT 
verification, then a final follow-up, rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET directed (for confirmation of lesion 
location only) confirmatory imaging scan can be obtained up to [ADDRESS_435760] rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) 
PET.  
Reading of conventional and confirmatory imaging to determine the next steps in the 
confirmation process will be performed locally.  
Both the rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET scans and all available conventional and confirmatory imaging 
scans acquired under Steps 2 to 4 above will be read centrally for the primary endpoint 
assessment, according to Table 1 and Figure 3 below. Three central reviewers will review all 
submitted imaging and reach consensus on the nature of the target lesion. Reads of the 
confirmatory imaging as SoT will be directed by [CONTACT_350596]-7.3 (18F) PET findings (for 
confirmation of lesion location only). A brief summary of clinical information will be available 
to the readers (e.g. 67-year-old male post-RP with PLND and adjuvant pelvic RT 5 years 
before; PSA rising to 1.2 ng/mL prior to rhPSMA scan; PSAdt 9 months). Readers will be 
blinded to all other information. Further details are given in the study Independent Review 
Charter. 
rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) positive target lesions will be categorized as positive, negative or 
indeterminate by [CONTACT_350597]. Indeterminate classifications will be categorized as False 
Positives for the primary analysis. Further details are given in the study Independent Review 
Charter. 
If a positive lesion on rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET suspi[INVESTIGATOR_350567], the lesion will be considered a TP. For the primary efficacy analysis, a region will be 
categorized as a TP if there is at least one TP lesion confirmed in that body region (prostate 
bed, pelvic lymph nodes, or other extra-pelvic sites) on rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET. For the primary 
analysis, pelvic lymph nodes will include the right and left external iliac, obturator, hypogastric 
(internal iliac), perirectal and presacral lymph node groups.  
If all above SoT techniques fail to positively confirm the PET-positive lesion(s), the rhPSMA-
7.3 (18F) PET lesion will be deemed FP.

Notes: 
a) In patients with multiple PET-positive regions, confirmation of at least one PET-positive lesion in each region is 
required either by [CONTACT_9256]/surgical resection or confirmatory imaging in order to calculate the region level PPV for the 
efficacy analyses. 
b) In patients with multiple lesions in a specific region, the presence of one TP lesion determines truth for the region 
regardless of any concurrent FP findings in the same region. Therefore, multiple PET-positive lesions can be evaluated 
in a specific region in order to confirm at least one TP.

CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP-MED-002-AD-2, Version 3 Although patients are not obliged to give a reason(s) for premature withdrawal, the investigator 
rights. 
All withdrawals and dropouts of enrolled patients from the study should be reported and 
explained on the eCRF. 
Dropouts who fail to complete all study procedures, for reasons other than due to adverse 
reactions/AEs deemed related to IP, will be withdrawn from the study and replaced. No more 
than 15% of patients enrolled will be replaced (see Section 13.2). 
11 IMAGING PROTOCOL 
11.1 PET Scanner 
A dedicated hybrid PET scanner (e.g. PET/CT) is mandatory. The selected PET scanner must be 
qualified by [CONTACT_289417]. Full details are in the Study Imaging Manual (aka 
Technical Operations Manual). 
11.2 rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) Injection Administration 
A venous cannula will be inserted and the patient will receive an administered activity of 8 mCi 
(296 MBq) ± 20% rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) injection diluted up to 10 mL. The administration will be 
injected via the cannula with arms down, as an IV bolus injection followed by 10 mL flush with 
normal saline solution. The participant will then be positioned supi[INVESTIGATOR_55437], with the 
arms above the head (if possible), and will be scanned as described in the Study Imaging Manual. 
The time from the end of injection of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) to the start of imaging will be between 
50 to 70 minutes.  
Full details are in the Study Imaging Manual. 
11.3 rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET Acquisition 
For the PET acquisition, patients will be imaged for approximately [ADDRESS_435772] 
acquisition (if acquired on a PET/CT scanner), an unenhanced (no IV contrast) CT will be 
employed. Further details on the PET acquisition are given in the Study Imaging Manual. 
11.4 Image Transfer 
Following the completion of PET imaging at the study site, the scan data will be sent to the 
Invicro Imaging Core Lab (Invicro, LLC) using either the iPACS software or on physical media 
by [CONTACT_30367]. Full details are in the Study Imaging Manual. 
11.5 rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) Image Reads 
All local and central readers will undergo training in interpretation of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET 
scans, and will have a training set available for reference. Primary evaluation and reporting of 
the PET scan will be based on the site-based local read (as per standard of care).  
Study BED-PSMA-302, Protocol Version 4, 23-Oct-[ADDRESS_435773] a causal relationship with the 
treatment. An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the administration of an 
IP, whether or not related to that IP. An unexpected AE is one of a type not identified in nature, 
severity, or frequency in the current rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) IB  or of greater severity or frequency than expected based on the information in the rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) IB . 
The investigator will probe, via discussion with the patient, for the occurrence of AEs during 
 AEs will be recorded in 
the patient eCRF. AEs will be described by [CONTACT_24109] (start and stop dates and times), 
severity/grade, outcome, treatment and relationship to IP, or if unrelated, the cause. 
12.1.1 Severity of Adverse Events 
Version 5 (2017) will be used to assess and grade event severity, including laboratory 
abnormalities judged to be clinically significant. The severity grading is provided below 
(Table 2 ).  
Table 2: CTCAE (V5) AE Severity Grading 
Severity (Toxicity Grade) Description 
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated. 
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or non-invasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental ADL.* 
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting 
self-care ADL**. 
Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
Grade 5 Death related to AE 
ADL=activities of daily living; AE=adverse event; CTCAE=Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. 
* Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, etc. 
** Self-care ADL refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden.  
If the experience is not covered in the CTCAE criteria, the guidelines shown in Table [ADDRESS_435774]-2020 Page 41 of 55
 
CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP-MED-002-AD-2, Version 3 Table 3: AE Severity Grading 
Severity (Toxicity Grade) Description 
Mild (1) Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical intervention 
or therapy required. The patient may be aware of the sign or symptom but 
tolerates it reasonably well. 
Moderate (2) Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required. 
Severe (3) Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy required, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125]. 
Life-threatening (4) The patient is at risk of death due to the adverse experience as it occurred. This 
does not refer to an experience that hypothetically might have caused death if 
it were more severe. 
Death (5) Death related to AE 
AE=adverse event. 
12.1.2 Relationship of Adverse Events to IP 
The relationship of an AE to IP will be assessed using the guidelines outlined in Table 4 . 
Table 4:  Relationship of AEs to IP 
Relationship to Drug Comment 
Definitely Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or expected 
response pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_350568]; and that is not explained by [CONTACT_41846]. 
Probably An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug; that 
is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_11125]; and that is unlikely to 
be explained by [CONTACT_350601]. 
Possibly An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to that suspected drug; but 
that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors. 
Unrelated An event that can be determined with certainty to have no relationship to the IP. 
AE=adverse event; IP=investigational product. 
12.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes: 
death 
a life-threatening adverse experience 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
a persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Study BED-PSMA-302, Protocol Version 4, 23-Oct-2020 Page 42 of 55
 
CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP-MED-002-AD-2, Version 3 Other important medical events may also be considered an SAE when, based on appropriate 
medical judgment, they jeopardize the patient or require intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.  
12.2.1 Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
Study sites will document all SAEs that occur (whether or not related to IP) on an SAE Report 
Form. The collection period for all SAEs will begin after informed consent is obtained and end 
after procedures for the final study visit have been completed. 
All SAEs must be reported immediately (as soon as possible after the investigator becomes 
aware of the event but no later than 24 hours) by [CONTACT_350602], to: 
For study sites in the [LOCATION_002]: [EMAIL_6745]  
For study sites in Europe: [EMAIL_6746]  
Additional and further requested information (follow-up or corrections to the original event) 
will be detailed on a new SAE Report Form and emailed to the same address. 
12.3 Urgent Safety Measures 
An urgent safety measure is an action that the Sponsor and/or investigator may take in order to 
protect study participants against an immediate hazard to their health or safety (e.g. it is 
identified that there is a significant higher incidence of death at one investigator site and as a 
result recruitment is suspended at that site as an urgent safety measure).  
An urgent safety measure taken by [CONTACT_350603]. For all urgent safety measures, the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent 
Ethics Committee (IEC) and Regulatory Agency/Competent Authority will be notified in 
accordance with International Council for Harmonisation (ICH)-Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
and applicable regulations. 
Initial notification may be followed by [CONTACT_63664] a protocol amendment (see Section 18.2 ), 
notification of early termination of the trial within 15 days (if applicable) and notification of 
AEs and serious adverse reactions (if applicable).

13 DISCONTINUATION AND REPLACEMENT OF PATIENTS 
13.1 Discontinuation of IP 
Not applicable. rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) is administered as a single IV injection. 
13.2 Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study 
Patients are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time, for any reason, 
specified or unspecified, and without prejudice. 
Study BED-PSMA-302, Protocol Version 4, 23-Oct-2020 Page 43 of 55
 
CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP-MED-002-AD-2, Version 3 An investigator may discontinue or withdraw a patient for any of the following reasons:
Significant non-compliance/protocol violation requiring discontinuation from the study. 
If any clinical AE, laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation occurs 
such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interests of the 
patient. 
If the patient meets any of the exclusion criteria (either newly developed or not 
previously recognized) that precludes further study participation. 
Lost to follow-up (see Section 13.4 ). 
Sponsor request for early termination of study. 
The reason for patient discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded in the 
patient  on the eCRF. 
Enrollment will continue until [ADDRESS_435775] completed all study procedures; 
therefore, dropouts who fail to complete all study procedures, for reasons other than due to 
adverse reactions/AEs deemed related to IP, will be withdrawn from the study and replaced. 
No more than 15% of patients enrolled will be replaced. A patient is considered to be evaluable 
if he complies with all study procedures, including the SoT algorithm (if the PET scan is 
positive) as provided in Figure 3 . 
Note: Any patients who withdraw/are withdrawn due to adverse reactions to rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) 
PET or AEs due to study procedures involved in rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET, will not be replaced. 
13.3 Replacement of Patients 
Patients who sign the informed consent form but do not receive the IP may be replaced. Patients 
who sign the informed consent form and who receive the IP, but subsequently withdraw (or are 
withdrawn or discontinued from the study) before any follow-up procedures are obtained will 
also be replaced except for patients who withdraw/are withdrawn due to adverse reactions to 
rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET or AEs due to study procedures involved in rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET 
(see Section 13.2). 
13.[ADDRESS_435776] to follow-up if they fail to return for the follow-up 
assessments (histology, imaging) 7 days after their appointment was due and is unable to be 
contact[CONTACT_136589].  
In order to decrease the extent of missing data for patients completing the rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) 
PET but lacking SoT assessments, the following actions must be taken if a participant fails to 
complete a required study assessment: 
The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_350605] a missed visit, 
and will counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain if the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study. 
Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee will make 
every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, three telephone calls 
and emails 
address or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_350606]-PSMA-302, Protocol Version 4, 23-Oct-[ADDRESS_435777] to follow-up. 
13.5 Study Discontinuation or Termination 
Patient enrolment may be temporarily halted or stopped if any of the following occur: 
SAE of severe acute hypersensitivity reaction attributed to the IP. 
SAE of death attributed to the IP. 
A new potential safety signal, e.g. multiple severe AEs which are new to the current 
rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) risk profile. 
Data from other clinical trials which greatly and negatively influence the current 
rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) benefit/risk assessment.  
[ADDRESS_435778] to a significant degree 
the safety or physical or mental integrity of the study patients or the scientific value of the trial 
should be notified to the Sponsor within one working day. 
Protocol deviations for this study include, but are not limited to, the following: 
Failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria (see Sections 6.2  and 6.3). 
Use of a prohibited concomitant medication (see Section 7.1). 
IP administration but no subsequent PET scan. 
The Sponsor will determine if a protocol deviation will result in withdrawal of a patient. Major 
protocol deviations will be defined and documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) 
which will be written and approved before database lock.  
15 DATA SAFETY MONITORING 
Not applicable. 
16 STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS 
Prior to the analysis of the final study data, a detailed SAP will be written and approved 
describing all analyses that will be performed. The SAP will contain any modifications to the 
analysis plan described below.  
16.1 Data Sets Analyzed 
All enrolled patients:  all patients who signed the informed consent form. 
Full Analysis Set (FAS):  all patients who were scheduled to receive the rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) 
injection by [CONTACT_350607]/exclusion criteria.  
Study BED-PSMA-302, Protocol Version 4, 23-Oct-2020 Page 45 of 55
 
CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP-MED-002-AD-2, Version 3 Full Safety Population (FSP): all patients who received the rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) injection.
Efficacy Analysis Population (EAP):  all patients who received rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) injection 
and with PET scan and sufficient data leading to a clear classification following the SoT 
algorithm. 
Per Protocol Population (PP):  All evaluable patients in the EAP population.  
All safety analyses will be performed using the FSP. The primary analysis of CDR and PPV 
will be based on the EAP. 
16.2 Accountability of Patients and Imaging 
The completion status of all patients will be summarized. Further, availability of results of 
patient disease assessments, completion of visits, and information on image assessments 
performed will be reported. 
16.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
The following demographic variables at screening will be summarized: full/partial date of 
birth/age, gender, ethnicity/race, sex ethnicity/race, sex and height. Weight at screening and on 
Day 1 will be summarized. 
Relevant medical history (including history of current disease, concomitant disease record, 
information regarding underlying diseases and family history of cancer) at screening will be 
also be summarized. 
16.[ADDRESS_435779] and the region level PPV of 
rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET. The joint hypothesis, based on the assumptions as outlined in 
Section 16.8, is as follows: 
H0 36.5 62.5% versus H 1: CDR >36.5% and PPV >62.5% 
Both primary endpoints will be summarized as a percentage together with a two-sided exact 
95% confidence interval (CI) for each reader. In addition, a one-sided exact binomial test 
p-value will be provided for each reader for each CDR. As this is a by-region endpoint, patients 
may have one to three regions that may be included in the PPV assessment. The one-sided test 
based on clustered binary data will be used to evaluate the PPV hypothesis ( Zhou, Obuchowski, 
and McClish, (2002), pg 104) to adjust the variance estimates in the analysis based on 
clustering of regions within a patient. For the study to be considered a success, the p-values for 
both endpoints must be statistically significant for at least two out of the three readers (same 
readers for both CDR and PPV).  
16.5 Analysis of Secondary and Exploratory Endpoints 
Secondary and exploratory endpoints will be summarized descriptively, with the exception of 
consistency of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) scan interpretation by [CONTACT_350608]. Two-sided 95% CIs will be presented, where applicable.  
Further details will be provided in the SAP. 
Study BED-PSMA-302, Protocol Version 4, 23-Oct-2020 Page 46 of 55
 
CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP-MED-002-AD-2, Version 3 16.6 Analysis of Safety Endpoint(s) 
Safety data will be summarized descriptively. For AEs and SAEs, the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) System Organ Class and Preferred Terms will be used to 
code the reported events. The number of events, number of patients with one or more event, 
and percentage of patients with one or more event will be provided for all AEs, related AEs, 
SAEs, and all related SAEs. For vital signs results, the change from baseline results will also 
be summarized. 
16.7 Planned Interim Analysis 
No formal hypothesis testing interim analysis will be performed. 
Once 60% of the planned [ADDRESS_435780] information, the proportion of patients with 
a PSA <1 ng/mL will be assessed. If this proportion exceeds 60% then investigators will be 
informed to stop further enrolment of this cohort. 
16.8 Sample Size and Randomization 
16.8.1 Assumptions 
As discussed in Section 4.2 , in the overall study population, the detection rate of 
rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET is expected to be approximately 60%, the overall PPV is estimated to 
be 73.5% and the overall CDR is anticipated to be 49% (point estimates). The lower bound of 
the CI for the region level PPV will be set at 62.5% and the overall CDR will have a lower 
bound of 36.5%. The study will aim to include approximately 40% of patients with a PSA level 
<1 ng/mL and approximately 60% of patients with a PSA level  ng/mL. 
16.8.[ADDRESS_435781] and assuming a true PPV of 73.5%, a sample size of 
190 positive cases provides >88% power for the evaluation of region level PPV (H 0: PPV 
316 evaluable patients would be required to obtain 190 positive rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET cases. 
Note that the PPV region-based analysis is expected to provide more than 88% power based 
upon the number of positive regions per patient being >1, even adjusting for the correlation 
between the regions within a patient. Thus, [ADDRESS_435782] 190 cases with disease detected with rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) and an evaluable result. 
For the patient level CDR endpoint, based on a one-sided 0.[ADDRESS_435783] of 49%, a sample size of 316 cases provides >99% power for the 
evaluation of CDR (H [ADDRESS_435784] 90% power for the regional PPV analysis. 
[ADDRESS_435785] practice. Source data should be 
attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate and complete. Changes to source data 
should be traceable, should not obscure the original entry, and should be explained if necessary.  
Study personnel at each site will enter data from source documents corresponding to a patientvisit into the protocol-specific eCRF when the information corresponding to that visit is

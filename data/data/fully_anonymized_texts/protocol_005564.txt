MCRF-S- 002-[ADDRESS_561414] the hypothesis that Jetstream atherectomy 
and adju nctive balloon angioplasty (JS +PTA) improves target lesion 
revascularization (TLR) at 6 months follow -up when compared to historic 
data from balloon angioplasty alone (PTA) in the treatment of 
femoropopliteal arterial In -stent restenotic (ISR) disease  
Study Design  A prospective, multicenter, single arm study evaluating the investigational 
use of Jetstream Atherectomy (JS)  and adjunctive balloon angioplasty (JS 
+PTA)  in the treatment of f emoropopliteal ISR lesions in subjects with 
claudication or limb isc hemia (Rutherfor d clinical category (RCC) of 2 -4) 
(lesion length ≥ 4 cm). The comparator arm is historic data from plain old 
balloon angioplasty derived from a Meta -analysis of the 3 published 
randomized trials in the field.   
Follow -Up 
Schedule  Follow -up assessments will occur at pre -discharge, 30 days, 6 months and 
1 year following the study procedure.   
Statistical 
assumption and 
analysis  Assumptions:  
 
TLR with bailout stenting from historic control from meta -analysis: 
 37.9%  
TLR with bailout stenting from Jetstream ISR feasibility study:  
 20.7%  
Power 80%  
Alpha 0.0 5 
 
We are planning a study of independent cases and controls with 1 
control(s) per case.  Prior data indicate that the failure rate among controls is 
0.38.  If the true failure rate for experi mental subjects is 0.21, we will need to 
study [ADDRESS_561415] 
the null hypothesis that the failure rates for experimental and control subjects 
are equal with probability (power) 0.8  (meta -analysis from published 
randomized trials provides data on 182 controls) .   The Type I error 
probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05.  We will 
use an uncorrected chi -squared statistic to evaluate this null hypothesis.  
Assumingly a loss o f 20% of patients on follow -up a minimum of 134 
patients will be enrolled.

Outcomes  
 Effectiveness: Target Lesion Revascularization (TLR) at 6 months : TLR 
is defined as retreatment of the index lesio n (extended 1 cm proximal and 
distal to the lesion) at 6 months. For the primary endpoint, intra -procedural 
bail out stenting of the index lesion is considered meeting a TLR endpoint.

JETS T REAM XC ATHERECTOMY DE VICE  
 The [LOCATION_011] Scientific Jetstream XC catheter is a rotating, aspi[CONTACT_35254], expandable 
ca
theter for active removal of atherosclerotic disease and thrombus in peripheral 
vasculature. The JS XC System has been cleared by [CONTACT_441977]-stent infrainguinal lesions 
 
 JETSTREAM XC™ device has 2 sets of blades: one set is at the tip of the catheter 
a
nd the other (5 blades) is mounted proximal to the tip. Counterclockwise rotation 
e
xpands the proximal blades and allows wider tissue cutting. The JetStream Navitus has 
be
en improved compared to its predecessor, the Pathway device, with the aspi[INVESTIGATOR_441935], allowing a more robust aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] 
c
apacity. The recommended use of this device with tips and tricks on how to operate it 
c
an be found in prior publications.1,2 
 
 There are 2 cutter designs with the JETSTREAM device. The JETSTREAM® XC 
(or eXpandable Cutter Catheters) and the JETSTREAM® SC (or Single Cutter 
Catheters). The Expandable Cutter, as the name [CONTACT_55474], can be used blades down (BD) 
a
nd blades up (BU) with single insertion and are for femoropopliteal vessels. The XC or 
Expandable Cutters Catheters come in 2 sizes: 2.1mm/3.0mm (135 cm length) is best 
suited for vessel size larger than 3.0 BD and 4.0-5.0 mm BU; and the 2.4mm/3.4mm (120 
cm length) is typi[INVESTIGATOR_441936] 4.0-4.9mm BD and 5.0 mm or larger BU. Also, 
the SC or Single Cutter Catheters come in two sizes: 1.6 mm (145 cm length) best suited 
for vessel size 2.0-2.5 mm; and the 1.85 mm (145 cm shaft length) typi[INVESTIGATOR_441937] 2.6-3.[ADDRESS_561423] a front end cutter with no BU 
feature and typi[INVESTIGATOR_441938]. The 
device is retracted through the treatment area by “rexing” it until wire loop is back to its 
initial size.

3.0 BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE 
3.1 DISEASE OVERVIEW  
In 2001, in the [LOCATION_002] alone, the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease 
(PAD) is estimated to be 8-[ADDRESS_561424] decade and is now applied in the majority of patients undergoing 
PAD treatment with revascularization. The tool box to treat infrainguinal PAD has 
expanded significantly and includes plain old balloon angioplasty (PTA), atherectomy, 
stenting, specialized balloons, drug coated balloons (DCB) and Drug coated stents 
(D
CS). In univariate analysis, PAD is more prevalent with age, men and Black 
population and less prevalent in Hispanic and Asians. Multivariate analysis continues to 
indicate that older age and Blacks are at a higher risk of PAD than the younger 
population or non-Hispanic Whites respectively even when adjusting for traditional risk 
factors such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], smoking and history of coronary 
artery disease (2b). 
S
everal studies have shown that stenting of the femoropopliteal artery (FP) leads to 
higher long term patency. Bare metal stents have not shown conclusively to reduce target 
lesion revascularization (TLR) which is in contrast to DCB and DCS3,4,5,6.  Irrespective, 
stenting has several disadvantages including a continued high rate of restenosis and stent 
fractures that is progressive with time7,8. FP ISR occurs in more than one third of patients 
a
t 1 year and up to 49% at 2 years3-8. Complex lesions (long, Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society 
C
onsensus II C/D lesions, total occlusions), certain demographics (female gender, 
diabetes mellitus), critical limb ischemia and significant stent fractures are associated 
with a higher rate of restenosis9.  Also the majority of occluded stents are restenotic-
thrombot
ic and generally are more challenging to tr eat.  
3.[ADDRESS_561425] been proposed to treat FP-ISR including plain old balloon 
angioplasty (PTA), cryoplasty (PolarCath, [LOCATION_011] Scientific, Natick, Mass) , cutting 
ba
lloons, drug-eluting self-expanding stents (Zilver X) (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, 
[LOCATION_003]), rotational and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_441939] S (Staub Medical AG, 
W
angs, Switzerland) and JetStream ([LOCATION_011] Scientific, Maple Grove, MN), directional 
atherectomy with SilverHawk (MDT, [LOCATION_003])), laser ablation (Excimer laser, 
S
pectranetics, Colorado Springs, Co, [LOCATION_003]), Viabahn covered stents (W.L.Gore and 
Assoc
iates, Newark, DE) and DCB10-20.   
Early observational data attempted debulking of FP ISR to reduce restenotic tissue 
burden and theoretically delay or reduce the rate of repeat revascularization.  Silingardi et 
al21 reported their experience with the Rotarex S device in treating 32 patients with 
subacute or chronic FP (n=26) or iliac (n=6) ISR. Although technical success was 100%, 
primary patency at 6 months and 12 months was 75% and 58.1% respectively. On the 
other hand, Wissgott et al.22 reported on 78 patients with ISR treated with the Rotarex S 
catheter (lesion length 147 mm). Technical success was high at 97.4% and restenosis at 1 
MCRF-S- 002-2016 , Version 2 .0                              29 February 2016                             Page 12 of 68 year was remarkably low at 18.4%. SilverHawk atherectomy also showed mixed results. 
In a cohort of 43 patients with FP ISR (mean lesion length of 131 mm), Zeller et al12 
showed patency and TLR rates of 54% and 53% respectively at one year with the 
SilverHawk catheter (currently contraindicated in treating FP ISR). Given the 
a
pproximate same mean lesion length (mean of 126.2 mm), Shammas et al10, showe d a 
TLR rate of 31.7% in [ADDRESS_561426] et al.23re cently reported the results of the SALVAGE trial with the use 
of the excimer laser and the Viabahn (W.L.Gore and Associates, Newark, DE) covered 
stent i
n treating FP ISR. The primary patency at 12 months was measured by [CONTACT_376510]. Twenty-seven patients were enrolled. The mean lesion length was 200.7 
mm and the majority of lesions were TASC C/D. Procedural success was achieved in 
100% of cases. Primary patency and TLR at 12 months were 48% and 17.4% 
respectively. This prospective single arm registry does not distinguish, however, between 
the relative effectiveness of the laser versus the Viabahn endograft stent in reducing 
restenosis in FP ISR lesions.  
Recently 3 randomized trials were presented in treating FP ISR; the EXCITE ISR 
trial (randomized laser + PTA vs PTA alone),  the RELINE trial (randomized Viabahn 
stent vs P
TA) and the Randomized Femoral Artery In-Stent Restenosis (FAIR) 
Tr
ial.18,19, 34. In the GORE VIABAHN (W.L Gore and Associates, Newark, Delaware, 
[LOCATION_003]) Versus Plain Old Balloon Angioplasty (PTA) for Superficial Femoral Artery 
(SF
A) In-Stent Restenosis (RELINE) trial19, Viabhan endograft stent was shown to be 
superior to PTA leading to significantly better patency rates at 1 year (37% versus 74.8% 
re
spectively). In the EXCImer Laser Randomized Controlled Study for Treatment of 
Fe
moropopliTEal In-Stent Restenosis (EXCITE ISR) trial18, a multicenter, prospective, 
randomized, controlled trial conducted across 40 U.S. centers. A total of 169 ELA + PTA 
subjects (62.7% male; mean age 68.5 ± 9.8 years) and 81 PTA patients (61.7% male; 
mean age 67.8 ± 10.3 years) were enrolled. Mean lesion length was 19.6 ± 12.0 cm 
versus 19.3 ± 11.9 cm, and 30.5% versus 36.8% of patients exhibited total occlusion. 
ELA + PTA subjects demonstrated superior procedural success (93.5% vs. 82.7%; p = 
0.01) with significantly fewer procedural complications. ELA + PTA and PTA subject 6-
month freedom from TLR was 73.5% versus 51.8% (p < 0.005), and 30-day major 
adverse event rates were 5.8% versus 20.5% (p < 0.001), respectively. ELA + PTA was 
associated with a 52% reduction in TLR (hazard ratio: 0.48; 95% confidence interval: 
0.31 to 0.74). This trial showed that debulking with the laser is an important strategy to 
reduce TLR in treating FP ISR when compared to PTA. Finally, The Randomized 
F
emoral Artery In-Stent Restenosis (FAIR) Trial34, randomized 119 patients with 
superficial femoral artery in-stent restenosis to drug coated balloon (DCB) (n=62) versus 
PTA (n=57). Mean lesion length was 82.2±68.4 mm. and 28.6% of lesions were totally 
occluded. The primary end point of recurrent in-stent restenosis assessed by [CONTACT_441978] 
6 months was 15.4% (8 of 52) in the DCB and 44.7% (21 of 47) in the PTA group 
(P=
0.002). Freedom from target lesion revascularization was 96.4% versus 81.0% 
(P=0.0117) at 6 months and 90.8% versus 52.6% (P<0.0001) at 12 months, respectively. 
No major amputation was needed. Two patients in the DCB and 3 patients in the PTA 
g
roup died. No death was procedure related.

promisi
ng technology in the treatment of FP ISR. Data however is mostly applicable for 
short (less than 10 cm) and intermediate lesions (10-15 cm). Patency with DCB ranged 
from 70.5 to 92.1% with TLR from 9.2 to 13.6% at 1 year. Also in intermediate lesions, 
DCS using the Zilver PTX showed patency and TLR rates of 95% and 3.8% and 78.8% 
and 19% at 6 months and 1 year follow up respectively. Combining atherectomy and 
DCB may offer a superior treatment modality than either device alone.  A small 
observational study showed that laser with DCB has a patency of 91.7% and TLR of 
7.1% at a mean follow up of 19.1 months.  Also DCB with directional atherectomy 
yielded a patency rate of 84.7% at [ADDRESS_561428] this hypothesis.

similarity to humans in terms of the size and anatomy of the cardiovascular system. 
Furthermore, this model has been validated for the occurrence of restenosis within 1 
month of stent/balloon overstretch injury, making it more practical for testing medical 
devices in treating ISR. All animals were held in quarantine and housed at CBSET

rformed during quarantine, including physical examinations and clinical pathology to 
determine health status before assignment to the study. A nutritionally balanced diet 
appropriate for the species was offered daily to all animals with water ad lib. Animals 
were released from quarantine by [CONTACT_441980].  
Animal Preparation  
 All animals were pretreated 1 day before stent implantation with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 650 
orally and clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] 300 mg orally. They were maintained on aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (81 mg daily 
orally) and clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (75 mg daily orally) thereafter until euthanized. Animals received 
Telazol (4–6 mg/kg) intramuscularly as a pre-anesthetic. Isoflurane anesthesia was then 
a
dministered to effect via mask/nosecone, and endotracheal intubation was then 
performed. Following intubation, the animals were maintained on continuous inhalant 
isoflurane anesthesia delivered for the remainder of the procedure. Perioperative 
nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (10 mg/animal placed sublingually) was also administered. The animals were 
prepared for surgery using accepted veterinary care standards. Electrocardiogram leads, a 
pulse oximetry sensor, and a temperature probe were placed for continuous monitoring of 
vital signs. Pre-emptive analgesia (buprenorphine; 0.01– 0.03 mg/kg), was administered 
intramuscularly at anesthesia (prior to surgical incision). The incision site was prepared 
a
nd appropriately draped for aseptic procedures. 
Stent Implantation Procedure 
 The right carotid artery was accessed using a cutdown approach. An introducer 
sheath was advanced into the artery and heparin (50–200 U/kg) was administered 
intra
venously to prolong the activated coagulation time to a target of >275 seconds. A 
guide catheter was then advanced to the iliac arteries under fluoroscopic guidance. The 
femoral arteries were crossed with a 0.035-inch J-tipped guidewire, and the target 
segment was dilated 3 times (30 seconds each) with an oversized angioplasty balloon at 
various pressures and to achieve a 1.2 to 1.5 balloon:artery ratio. Two overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 40-
mm-long nitinol S.M.A.R.T. self-expanding stents (5.0 and 6.0 mm in diameter; Cordis 
Corporation, Bridgewater, NJ, [LOCATION_003]) were then deployed to the dilated target lesion 
(sized 1.2:1 stent:artery). The amount of overlap was either 100% (n=2) or 25% to 50% 
(n=6). The same process was repeated for the contralateral leg. A total of 8 stents were 
deployed in 4 limbs. Following stent implantation in both left and right femoral arteries, 
the animal is weaned off the anesthetic and extubated. Buprenorphine 0.01 to 0.03 mg/kg 
was administered intramuscularly every ~[ADDRESS_561430] media to characterize the degree of ISR. Quantitative 
vessel angiography (QVA; Centricity Cardiology CA1000 Cardiac Review 2.0 software) 
was used to measure minimum lumen diameter (MLD), plaque surface area (PSA), and 
percent stenosis. An optimal residual stenosis after atherectomy alone was defined as a 
residual percent stenosis <50%.  
 Atherectomy was then carried on by [CONTACT_441981] a slow speed of 1 to 2 
mm per seconds from the proximal to distal end of the stented segment (one run) over a 
Spartacore wire (Abbott Vascular, Redwood City, CA, [LOCATION_003]). Two atherectomy runs 
with BD followed by [CONTACT_441982]. Atherectomy was then 
repeated with BU for 4 runs and with QVA of the lesion after each run (Figure 1).  
 
 
 Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) quantitative measurements were also performed 
at baseline, after 2 BD runs, and after each BU run (BU1, BU2, BU3, BU4) on a total of 
24 locations in the proximal, mid, and distal parts of the stented segments (Figure 2).

Minimum lumen area (MLA) within each the [ADDRESS_561431] net MLA gain and PSA reduction (BU MLA or PSA 
– baseline MLA or PSA), respectively. The minimum MLA and PSA ranges at baseline 
ne
eded for an increase in MLA by 1 to 2 mm and reduction in PSA by 5% to 10% from 
baseline were determined. 
 Device interaction with the implanted stent and subsequent damage of the stent 
was carefully evaluated under fluoroscopy. The process was repeated for the contralateral 
limb. After the last treatment, the animal was euthanized. Stents were evaluated 
postmortem with high resolution radiographs to determine strut damage.  
Statistical analysis 
 Descriptive analysis was performed on all angiographic variables. Single-sampl e 
Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed between MLA obtained after BU runs and 
theoretical maximal MLA of the XC 2.4-3.4 cutter with BU model. Line graphs were 
performed to illustrate the change in MLD, MLA, PSA (with IVUS) and percent stenosis 
with each treatment. Wilcoxon signed-rank test and paired t test (1-tail) were performed 
to compa
re baseline, BD, and BU 1 to 4 runs using the statistical package in Minitab 17 
(State College, PA, [LOCATION_003]). 
 
Results 
The mean vessel diameter was 4.7±0.6 mm and mean lesion length was 61.5±12.6 
mm. The mean baseline (n=8) MLD was 1.73±0.84 mm. Following 2BD and 1 BU runs, 
the mean MLDs were 2.6±0.7 mm (p=0.025) and 3.12±0.39 mm (p=0.005), respectively, 
vs baseline MLD. There was also a significant increase in MLD between 2BD runs and 
MCRF-S- 002-2016 , Version 2 .0                              29 February 2016                             Page 17 of 68 BU1 run (p=0.005). No statistical difference in MLD was seen between BU runs (p>0.05; 
Figure 3A). 
 PSA was significantly reduced between baseline (83.9%±14.8%) and 2 BD 
(67.7%±17.0%, p=0.005) and BU1 (55.4%±9.0%, p=0.005) runs and between BU1 and 
BU2 runs (50.7%±9.7%, p<0.05). No differences in PSA was seen between the BU2, 
BU3, and BU4 runs (p>0.05). Percent stenosis was reduced from a mean of 
63.13%±16.91% to 44.97%±15.0%8 (p=0.005) with BD runs and to 33.51%±6.73% 
(p=0.005) with BU1 run. There was also a significant reduction in percent stenosis 
between 2 BD runs and BU1 run (p=0.01) and between BU1 and BU2 runs 
(30.1%±7.0%, p=0.05). No difference between percent stenosis was seen between BU 2 
to 4 runs (p=0.10; Figure 3B). 
 
 
 The mean baseline MLA by [CONTACT_441983] 7.8±2.7 mm2. Following 2BD and 1 BU 
runs, the mean MLAs were 8.1±2.5 mm2 (p<0.044) and 8.7±2.0 mm2 (p=0.007), 
respectively, when compared to baseline MLA. There was also a significant increase in 
MLA between 2BD runs and BU1 run (p=0.033) and between BU1 and BU2 runs 
(9.4±2.4 mm2, p=0.007). No statistical difference in MLA was seen between BU 2 to 3 
runs (p>0.05; Figure 4A). 
 PSA was significantly reduced between baseline (65.2%±11.7%) and 2 BD 
(63.0%±10.5%, p=0.015) and BU1 (60.7%±9.2%, p=0.011) runs and between BU1 and 
BU2 runs (57.5%±7.5%, p=0.025). No differences in PSA were seen between the BU2, 
BU3, and BU4 runs (p=0.12; Figure 4B)

 Vessel area measured by [CONTACT_441984]4 run (23.3±5.8 vs 22.5±4.9 mm2, respectively; p=0.73). 
Furthermore, a significant correlation was seen between MLA at baseline and MLA after 
BU runs (p=0.006; Figure 5A) and between PSA at baseline and PSA after BU runs 
(p<0.0001; Figure 5B). An approximate baseline MLA of 8.0 to 9.0 mm2 led to an MLA 
gain of 1 to 2 mm2 and an approximate baseline PSA of 60% to 70% led to a reduction in 
PSA by 5% to 10% using the large cutter BU mode. Finally, theoretical MLA achievable 
from the XC BU 2.4-3.4 device is 9.08 mm2 (A = πr2 using  r=3.4/2=1.7mm). No 
difference was seen between this calculated MLA and the IVUS measured MLAs after 
BU runs, indicating no orbital effect of the device on tissue cutting.

 There were no observed angiographic stent disruptions or stent strut discontinuity 
with IVUS or high resolution radiography (Figure 6) with JetStream Navitus 
atherectomy.  
 
 Using IVUS, JetStream Navitus is a true debulking device with no Dottering 
effect. In one study of post JetStream Navitus atherectomy, total vessel volume remained 
unc
hanged, but tissue volume is reduced and MLD is increased significantly.3 IVUS data 
confirm the same findings by [CONTACT_441985], 
indicating true tissue excision within a nitinol self-expanding stent. Furthermore, the 
median MLA change seen after BU runs was statistically similar to the theoretical MLA 
calculated using a BU large cutter, which indicates that effective cutting is limited to the 
perimeter of the device, with no “wobbling” or “orbital” effect. This is a limitation of the 
MCRF-S- 002-2016 , Version 2 .0                              29 February 2016                             Page 20 of 68 device in treating femoropopliteal ISR, as suboptimal tissue excision is therefore 
expected in larger vessel diameter (possibly 7 mm or higher).  
 In this model, stents were positioned at different overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_441940], particularly 
when the blades are up. No adverse events or stent-device interaction were seen. Also, 
there was no angiographic evidence of dissection or distal embolization following 
JetStream Navitus atherectomy, but it should be noted that these lesions are relatively 
short and not totally occluded; thus, they have a low potential for embolization.  
 Finally, adjunctive balloon angioplasty was not performed after the JetStream 
Navitus as the intention of the study was to test the effectiveness and safety of the device 
itself rather than the final outcome after adjunctive balloon angioplasty. The residual 
narrowing post atherectomy was a mean of 30.1%, which is consistent with effective 
tissue debulking (<50% residual) with the JetStream Navitus alone and without balloon 
angioplasty. This residual narrowing was accomplished in a mean vessel diameter of 4.7 
mm.

proliferation in this swine femoral artery ISR model was sufficient to evaluate the 
JetStream atherectomy catheter for safety.

3.32 Clinical studies 
Beschorner et al35 reported data on 33 patients (40 infrainguinal ISR lesions) treated 
with t
he Pathway PV atherectomy system (predecessor of JetStream). Primary patency 
wa
s 33 % after 12 months and 25 % after 24 months. In this study, the majority of the 
lesions were FP (90%) but few lesions were in the peroneal, tibioperoneal and others. The 
vessels had no or mild (<30 degrees) tortuosity.  Lesion length was 85.7 mm. Total 
occlusions were present in 20% of vessels. No serious device-related events were noted. 
Acute procedural success was accomplished in all lesions with adjunctive balloon/stent 
treatment. Distal embolization occurred in 6% of lesions treated and required aspi[INVESTIGATOR_441942]. Bail out stenting was need in one lesion (3%). The Pathway 
PV system used in this study required 8 F system. Since then, the device (currently the 
Jetstream XC) was improved upon with more powerful aspi[INVESTIGATOR_441943] 7 F sheath.  
The recently presented final data of the JetStream ISR study  at New Cardiovascular 
Horizon 201527 (one year TLR data will be presented at LINC 2016)  evaluated acute 
proc
edural and 6-month outcomes, and stent-device interaction of the JetStream Navitus 
in treating FP ISR from 2 U.S. centers (manuscript in Print in JEVT 2016. Copy of 
accepted manuscript is in Appendix B ). Demographic, clinical, angiographic and 
procedural data were collected on 29 patients (32 limbs) included. The primary 
effectiveness endpoint was acute procedural success (<30% residual narrowing with no 
serious adverse events). The primary safety endpoint was freedom from major adverse 
events (MAE). Secondary endpoints include clinically driven target lesion 
revascularization (TLR) at 6 months and stent integrity as assessed by [CONTACT_441986]. Six-month follow-up was completed on 27 patients (29 limbs). Adjunctive 
balloon angioplasty was performed in 100% at a mean pressure of 11.6 ± 3.3 atm. Total 
lesion length was 17.4 ± 13.1 cm and total treated length 19.5 ± 12.9 cm. Acute 
proc
edural success occurred in 90.6% of limbs. Acute device success (<50% residual 
narrowing after atherectomy alone) was 75.9%. Embolic filter protection (EFP) was used 
in 16/32 (50.0%) of limbs. Macrodebris was noted in 2/16 (12.5%) of filters and distal 
embolization (DE) requiring treatment occurred in 3/32 limbs (9.4%) (2 with no EFP). 
There were no new stent fractures or deformities (n=24) post JS. On 6-month follow-up 
TLR occurred in 4/29 patients (13.8%). Patency rate (PSVR<2.4) was 72%.  Other non-

re
sults were highly encouraging establishing in this feasibility small study the safety and 
effectiveness of the JetStream in treating FP ISR when compared to historic control.  
Observational data also are available from the multicenter xl-PAD registry that 
provided insight into how JetStream is applied in a real world registry28. Jetstream™ 
atherectomy was performed in 68 procedures. Patients’ average age was 68.5 years, 
66.2% were male, and 89.7% Caucasian. Average ankle-brachial index was 0.74 ±0.25,  
average Rutherford category was 3.15 ±0.78, and 17.7% presented with critical limb 
ischemia. Lesions were long (133.9 ±106.8 m m), and located mostly in the superficial 
femoral artery (85.3%), followed by [CONTACT_441987] (13.2%), and posterior tibial artery 
(1.5%). In-stent restenotic (ISR) lesions comprised 47.1% , chronic total occlusions 
22.1%, and lesions with heavy calcification 27.9%. Procedural success was 94.1%. 
Additi
onal stenting was performed in 25 % lesions and 42.6%  used embolic protection 
with the Nav-6 (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA) filter. There were 3 (4.4%) distal 
embolizations, all in unprotected cases that were successfully treated with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]-
thrombectomy. At 12-months post-procedure, target limb revascularization rate was 
20.6%, stent thrombosis 1.5%, and amputation-free survival 98.5%.  
Finally, a small feasibility study36 to assess the role of adjunctive balloon angioplasty 
a
fter optimal debulking with JetStream was evaluated in 6 patients (total 15 lesions) with 
femoropopliteal instent restenosis. This demonstrated similar results to the porcine model 
above where maximum debulking was reached after [ADDRESS_561432] Jetstream (see figure 
below)

can be found on the FDA webpage. 
 
4.[ADDRESS_561434] UDY DESIGN  
This is a prospective, multicenter (up to 14 sites), single arm study. Patients will be 
tre
ated with plaque excision using JetStream XC (JS) followed by [CONTACT_441988] (PTA). Each subject must meet all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria.  
A subje

the FP segment.  All subjects will be followed up to [ADDRESS_561435] of treating FP ISR with 
plaque
 excision using JS in combination with adjunctive PTA and compare this to 
historic control of PTA.

4.[ADDRESS_561456] will undergo percutaneous revascularization of the superficial femoral and/or 
popliteal arteries. The JS + adjunctive PTA will be used to treat all lesion. Operators 
should have at least a minimum experience with [ADDRESS_561457] should receive anticoagulation 
medic
ations as indicated by [CONTACT_442000].  
S
elective angiography of the limb to be treated including the distal aorta, bilateral iliac, 
ipsilateral femoral, popliteal and tibial-peroneal vessels (to the pedal level) will b e 
pe
rformed to identify the anatomical characteristics of the vasculature and to best isolate 
and define the lesion.  If a pre-procedure assessment has been completed with 
CTA/MRA, the angiography can be limited to the target vessel, with a baseline 
assessment of run-off.  Angiography must be conducted according the Angiographic 
P
rotocol (refer to Core Lab requirement ).  Gadolinium and CO2 are not allowed for use 
as contract material. 
During angiography the Investigator performing the procedure will assess the subject for 
the a
ngiographic inclusion and exclusion criteria.  It is required that a radiopaque ruler b e 
used to define lesion length and define anatomical measurement references.  If the subject 
mee
ts all the angiographic inclusion criteria and does not meet any of the angiographic 
exclusion criteria, the subject is enrolled when an exchangeable guidewire crosses the 
target lesion.  Upon enrollment, subject s will  be then treated with the JS + PTA as per 
protoc
ol.  
Angiographic films, including run-off, will be obtained immediately prior to and after 
tre
atment (after JS alone, and after adjunctive PTA or bail out stenting) according to the 
Ang
iographic  Core Lab Protocol.  Capture images that demonstrate the stenosis in two 
views that minimize the degree of vessel overlap and demonstrate the stenosis in its most 
se
vere view.  Angiographic results must be sent to the Angiographic Core L abo ratory. 
The Angiographic Core Laboratory assessments will supersede the measurements by [CONTACT_442001]; however, the 
MCRF-S- 002-[ADDRESS_561458] atherectomy to assess for additional/worsening 
fractures. 
4.63 TRE ATMENT OF THE TARGET VESSEL  
4.641 TARG ET LESION  
The lesion intended for treatment at the time of the index procedure that meets the 
inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be considered the “target lesion.”  
Ea
ch subject can have only one target lesion.  The point of enrollment is defined as the 
moment an exchangeable guidewire and treatment catheter cross the target lesion in the 
true
 lumen.  
If there are 5 cm or less between diseased segments needing treatment in the SFA and/or 
popliteal artery, then it can be considered one lesion (see example below).  If there are 
more
 than [ADDRESS_561459] be successfully treated prior to the point of enrollment. 
S
tent placement in the common femoral arteries will exclude patient from enrolment. 
I
f a patient has an infrapopliteal lesion that require s treatment for significant (> 70% 
stenosis or occlusion) stenosis , patient cannot be enrolled.  
L
esions in the non-target limb may be treated du ring the index procedure, but not within 
or e
qual 30 days following the index procedure.   
4.643 JS + PTA  GROUP PROCEDURES  
The selection of the JS XC device will be at the discretion of the treating physician.  In 
general however, the 2.4 XC is for vessel diameter > 5 cm and 2.1 XC for 4-5 cm. The 
plaque excision procedure will follow the steps described in the published manual by 
S
hammas et al.2 The Spartacore (Abbott) or JetStream Wire ([LOCATION_011] Scientific) are 
re
commended with the use of the JetStream device. The Grand Slam wire and 
hydrophilic wires are not recommended. Filters are highly encouraged but left to 
investigator’s discretion. If a filter is used, the off label use of the Nav-6 (Abbott) filter is  7 cm   5 cm  5 cm 
17 cm   Single lesion:  17 cm lesion since separation is ≤ 5.[ADDRESS_561460] be documented by 
a
ngiography per the Angiographic Protocol. It is recommended that residual stenosis be < 
50% prior to treatment with adjunctive PTA.   
Dilation of the
 lesion following JS has to be done with a 1:1 balloon size and avoidance 
of oversizing.  The diameter of the study balloon will be selected based on the vessel 
re
ference diameter distal to the target lesion. Balloon inflation should be limited to within 
the ste
nt. See section 4.43 for details.    
If there is a complication during JS, treatment is at the operator’s discretion.  If a 
perforation occurs in the area of plaque excision, it must be sealed and distal outflow 
must
 be established.  
4.644 ADJ UNCTIVE PROCEDURES  
Adjunctive procedures besides PTA should be avoided if possible.  In the event of a 
major flow limiting dissection (type D and higher), perforation, or occlusive complication 
(
e.g., recoil), prolonged balloon inflation (5 minutes) must be attempted first.  All efforts 
shoul
d be made to eliminate the need for bail-out stent placement.  In cases where the 
results after prolonged balloon inflation are suboptimal, bail-out stenting is allowed.  A 
c
ine following the prolonged balloon inflation must be captured; all bail-out stenting 
proc
edures will be reviewed by [CONTACT_13788].  Adjunctive treatment 
with cutti
ng balloons or scoring balloons is not allowed. Adjunctive or primary PTA 
shoul
d be done with a non-compliant or semi compliant balloon sized 1:1 to vessel size. 
Adjunctive stenting is performed only with self-expanding nitinol stent. Drug coated 
stents, covered stents, or drug coated balloons are not allowed in the study.  
4.645 PR OCEDURE COMPLETION  
An angiogram of the treated segment(s) must be recorded for subsequent Angiographic 
Core Laboratory analysis of the post-treatment residual stenosis.  
The
 end of the procedure is defined as the time after a complete angiogram, including 
runoff, has been performed AND the last guidewire and catheter have been removed.  If 
the subject returns to the procedure room and a guiding catheter is reinserted and dilation 
is performed, this is considered a re-intervention and should be documented accordingly.  
The sheath(s) may be removed at the physician’s discretion. 
4.646 ADV ERSE EVENT EVALUATION  
An AE evaluation will be performed during and at the end of the procedure.  See Section 
4.20 for the AE definitions.  Adverse event evaluations will also occur prior to discharge 
and at all follow-up visits.

appropriate core laboratory. These data will be collected and used for adjudication by [CONTACT_941] 
C
linical Event Committee for “clinically-driven” reintervention. 
The investigator will initially determine the lesion severity by [CONTACT_442003] -intervention. The cine angiogram will be sent to 
angiographic core lab for analysis. Two orthogonal views of the lesi on 
will be required to determine more accurately the lesion severity by [CONTACT_442004]. Core lab evaluation of lesion severity will be used as the 
more definitive measure and supersedes operator's visual estimate.  
The following describes what take precedenc e (angiogram versus duplex 
ultrasound) to determine lesion severity:1. Patient has both modalities 
because of symptoms recurrence prior to 6 months follow up. To be 
consistent with the 6 months’ primary endpoint the Duplex ultrasound 
will take precedence  
2. Patient has an giogram only because of symptom  recurrence prior to [ADDRESS_561467]’s termination will be documented.  
R
easons for termination include: subject withdrawal, physician-directed subject 
withdrawal, and lost- to- follow-up.

subje
ct to withdraw. 
4.655 DE VIATIONS TO THE STUDY 
Principal Investigators and site staffs should avoid Study Protocol deviations. Any 
deviations from clinical protocol requirements will be considered protocol deviations and 
ne
ed to be reported to the Sponsor.  Any emergency deviations (deviations from the 
S
tudy Protocol to protect the life or physical well being of a subject, such as, surgical 
re

C
ommittee (EC) per their local guidelines.   
4.656  ADVERSE EVENTS  
4.657 ADV ERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is defined as any untoward and unintended clinical sign, 
symptom, or disease in a subject, regardless of the relationship between the adverse event 
and the device under investigation, that: 
 Led to a death,  
 L ed to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that: 
1. R esulted in a life-threatening illness or injury,  
2. R esulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function,  
3. Required inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], 
or  
4. R esulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment 
to a body structure or body function.   
 Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.   
A written report must be provided to the Sponsor or representative within [ADDRESS_561470] be provided to the EC according to reporting 
guidelines. 
MCRF-S- 002-2016 , Version 2 .0                              29 February 2016                             Page 40 of 68 4.658  ADVERSE EVENT CLASSIFICATIONS  
In addition to the definitions above, adverse events will be classified as follows: 
Major Adverse Events 
1. Major Adverse Events (MAE) as individual endpoints in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3491] 
u
p to 30 days :   Include device-induced vascular injury as reported by [CONTACT_442005], amputation (major and minor unplanned), death, significant 
dist
al embolization requiring the use of pharmacologic or mechanical 
means to treat (other than a vasodilator), perforation (extravasation of 
blood out
side the vessel wall), major bleeding, non-fatal myocardial 
infa
rction (defined as the occurrence of more than [ADDRESS_561471] procedure with an increase in troponin), stroke, access 
complications (AV fistula and pseudoaneurysm), bail out stenting, ac ute 
renal failure (drop in crcl by > 25% from baseline), acute (< 24 hours) or 
subacute (< 1 month , > than 24 hours) vessel closure.  
2. Target Lesion failure at 6 months and 1 year:  Defined as major 
unplanned amputation related of the treated limb, vascular mortality 
related to treated limb and target lesion revascularization at 6 months and 
1 year (stenting in the lab is not considered a TLR) 
3. M ajor Adverse Event Rate at 6 months and 1 Year: Defined as major 
unplanned amputation of the treated limb, all-cause mortality or TLR at 6 
mont
hs and 1 year (bail out stent in the Lab is included as TLR) 
 
Unanticipated or Unexpected Adverse Device Effects:  any serious adverse effect on 
health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a 
device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, 
or degree of incidence in the protocol or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that 
re
lates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. 
4.659 ADV ERSE EVENT RELATIONSHIPS  
The Investigators will evaluate whether or not the adverse events were related to the 
procedure, study requirements, and/or investigational products (e.g., JS  device, 
a
ngioplasty balloon, drug coating) according to the following categories: 
Related:   AE that has a strong temporal relationship to the study procedure, a study 
re
quirement, or the presence or performance of the investigational device/system or drug 
and an alternative etiology is highly unlikely. 
Possibly Related:  AE that has a temporal relationship to the study procedure, a study 
re
quirement, or the presence or performance of the investigational device/system or drug 
and an alternative etiology is unlikely.

ther
apy, and was not caused by [CONTACT_161473], a study requirement, or the 
investigational device/system or drug. 
Not Assessable:   It is not possible to assess whether or not the adverse event is related to 
the study procedure, a study requirement, or the investigational device/system or drug.

5.0 STATISTICAL METHODS  
 
5.1 SAM PLE SIZE  
 
5.11 Meta-analysis of PTA control arms from randomized trials 
 
Please refer to Appendix A at end of protocol   
 
5.12 Assumptions: 
 
T
LR with bailout stenting from historic control from meta-analysis:  37.9% 
TLR with bailout stenting from Jetstream ISR feasibility study:  20.7% 
Power 80% 
Alpha 0.05 
 
W
e are planning a study of independent cases and controls with 1 control(s) per 
case.  Prior data indicate that the failure rate among controls is 0.38.  If the true failure 
rate for experimental subjects is 0.21, we will need to study [ADDRESS_561476] the null hypothesis that the failure rates for 
e
xperimental and control subjects are equal with probability (power) 0.8 (meta-analysis 
from published randomized trials provides data on 182 controls).   The Type I error 
probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05.  We will use an 
uncorrected chi-squared statistic to evaluate this null hypothesis. Assumingly a loss of 
20%
 of patients on follow-up a minimum of 134 patients will be enrolled.

5.23 GE NERAL PRINCIPLES  
All statistical analyses will be performed using a widely accepted statistical or graphical 
software.  An intention to treat analysis will be carried on with bailout stenting as TLR 
a
nd without bail out stenting as TLR. Also analysis will be done by [CONTACT_29628]. A 
maximum of 140 patients will be enrolled. 
De
scriptive statistics will be used to present the data and to summarize the results.  
Disc
rete variables will be presented using frequency distributions and cross tabulations.  
C
ontinuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_442006] (N), 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values.    
F
or AE reporting, the primary analysis will be based on subject counts.  A subject with 
more
 than one event will be counted only once toward the event rate based on the total 
number of subjects with AEs.  An event rate based on event counts will also be 
pre
sented.  For example, if a subject experiences one major unplanned amputation of the 
tre
ated limb and two clinically-driven TLRs within [ADDRESS_561477] will be counted 
once in the rate of total subjects with a 30-day MAE; the same subject will be counted 
onc
e in the individual event category of “Major Unplanned Amputation of the Treated 
Limb” and twice in the “Clinically-Driven TLR” category.     
5.24 ANALYS IS OF BASELINE DEMOGRAPHICS AND PROCEDURAL CHARACTERISTICS  
Descriptive analysis will be performed on all clinically relevant baseline demographics 
and procedural variables using percentages for dichotomous variables and mean +/- 
Standard deviations for continuous variables 
5.25 ANALYS IS OF OUTCOMES    
W
e hypothesize that JetStream atherectomy is superior to plain old balloon angioplasty in 
treating femoropopliteal in-stent restenosis in regards to the primary effectiveness 
endpoint of target lesion revascularization at 6 months with bailout stenting considered as 
a TLR. The Null Hypothesis assumes that the active control (JetStream) and the historic 
control of TLR (derived from the meta-analysis) have the same TLR at [ADDRESS_561478] enrollment, data entry 
and adverse event reporting.  All investigational sites will follow the requirements of a 
c
ommon protocol, and common data collection procedures and forms.  To present the 
da
ta from this clinical study in a summary form, a comparison across all sites will be 
completed to determine if the generated data can be pooled.

Meta-analysis 
 
We completed a meta-analysis for the 3 randomized trials published (1-3) with femoropopliteal 
in-stent restenosis where the control arm was balloon angioplasty alone. Below is a table of this 
meta-analysis. This showed that TLR with balloon angioplasty alone was 37.9%.

Prior data indicate that the failure rate among controls is 0.38.  If the true failure rate for 
experimental subjects is 0.21, we will need to study [ADDRESS_561498] the null hypothesis that the failure rates for experimental and control 
subjects are equal with probability (power) 0.8 (meta-analysis provides 182 controls which is 
more
 than needed for this analysis).   The Type I error probability associated with this test of this 
null hypothesis is 0.05.  We will use an uncorrected chi-squared statistic to evaluate this null 
hypothesis. Assumingly a loss of 20% of patients on follow-up a minimum of 134 patients will 
be
 enrolled.

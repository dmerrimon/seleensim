1. Abstract  
 
Many individuals in need of a kidney transplant will die o n the transplant waitlist before ever receiving a 
donor offer due to a national organ shortage crisis . At the same time, many high quality kidneys from 
hepatitis C infected (HCV+) donors are discarded every year because there is not a HCV+ candidate 
availa ble to accept the organ. New HCV therapi[INVESTIGATOR_899867] , with cure rates of nearly 100%. This is a single center , open -label , pi[INVESTIGATOR_899868]/ pi[INVESTIGATOR_201826] 10 HCV -uninf ected  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_201827] -
infected  deceased donors at Johns Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (JHH).   
 
The primary hypothesis is tha t prophylactic treatment with glecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_899869] -
infected deceased donors . The safety hypothesis is that grade  3-4 AE related to G/P will occur in ≤ 10% 
of participants . Based on the  success of preliminary studies, the objective of our study is to evaluate  the 
safety  and efficacy of 4 weeks of g lecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_899870] D+/R - kidney 
transplant .

2. Objectives  
 
Primary  objectives : 
The primary objectives  of this study are to evaluate the safety  and efficacy of glecaprevir 300 
mg/pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761] 120 mg (G -P) treatment in HCV -uninfected transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (HCV R -) of a kidney 
from an  HCV -infected deceased donor (HCV D+). G-P will be administered on -call to the operating 
room (OR) for the renal transplant procedure and continued for [ADDRESS_1261616] -renal transplant.  
 The primary efficacy outcome will be the proportion of HCV D+/R - renal tr ansplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_899871] (< LLOQ) 12 weeks after 
treatment.  
 The primary safety  outcome will be the incidence of adverse events (AE) related to G -P. 
 
Secondary outcomes:  
 Proportion of kidney transp lant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_571879] < LLOQ at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 
12 weeks after discontinuation of therapy.  
 Proportion of kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_201832] . 
 Measurement of T cell responses to H CV pep tides at baseline  and week  12 after discontinuation 
of therapy . 
 Kidney allograft function at 6 and 12 months following transplantation.  
 
 
 
3. Background   
 
Over 95,000 individuals are awaiting a life -saving kidney transplant in the [LOCATION_002];  however , due 
to a shortage of deceased donor organs, less than 17,000 kidney transplants are performed each year [1]. 
Depending on geography and patient characteristics, waiting times in the [LOCATION_002] can be up to [ADDRESS_1261617] is , on average , 6% per year with significant 
variation depending on the regi on and patient characteristics.  At Johns Hopkins in 2013, kidne y 
transplant waitlist mortality for all individuals was 5% [1]. The death rate for older individuals or for 
individuals with diabetes is about 10% p er year. Therefore, a patient > [ADDRESS_1261618] time of five years for a kidney ha s a greater than 50% chance of dying before a kidney becomes 
available [2,3].  
 
Kidneys from hepatitis C -infected (HCV+) donors are currently underutilized. From 2014 -16, over 50% 
of kidneys from HCV+ deceased donors were discarded , compared to 18% of kidne ys from HCV -
uninfected (HCV -) donors [1]. Many of these HCV+ organs are of excellent quality, but are frequently 
discarded due to a lack of hepatitis C -infected recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (R+) [4].   
 
One strategy to safely expand the donor pool is to better utilize disca rded HCV D+ organs and perform 
HCV+ donor organ transplantation to HCV -uninfected recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (HCV D+/R - transplant) in 
combination with direct -acting antivirals (DAAs) for HCV.  We recently completed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_201834] l of this 
approach in [ADDRESS_1261619] -transplant 
prophylaxis.  Depending on the donor HCV genotype, the DAAs grazoprevir/elbasvir with o r without

 sofosbuvir were used.  The trial was called EXPANDER: An open -label study to determine the efficac y 
and safety  of fixed -dose grazoprevir/elbasvir treatment in hepatitis C uninfected recipi[INVESTIGATOR_899872] C infected deceased donors (NCT# 02781649). In this trial, HCV - recipi[INVESTIGATOR_899873] O R and were subsequently treated with  standard 
treatment durations of 12 -16 weeks (depending on donor HCV geno type) of DAAs after transplant.  Ten 
HCV D+/R - transplants were performed at Johns Hopkins (IRB 00089751) and this approach was 
successful in preven ting chronic hepatitis C infection in all 10 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. The DAAs were well tolerated 
and there were no grade 3 or grade 4 serious adverse events noted [5].  
 
In addition to the study  described above , a similar study at the University of Pennsylvania treat ed 10 
HCV negative participants receiving an HCV+ donor kidney with elbasvir -grazoprevir for [ADDRESS_1261620] treatment [6]. In contrast to the EXPANDER  study 
at Hopkins , where a prophylactic strategy was use d to treat donor -derived hepatitis C infection in 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], the Penn study used a pre -emptive approach, waiting for recipi[INVESTIGATOR_899874] p rior to initiating DAA therapy.  In that trial, 10/10 patients had detectable HCV RNA 
in peripheral blood by [CONTACT_4475] 3.  All patients were cured with 12 weeks of DAA therapy [6].  
 
As a follow up to these studies, we are proposing a shorter course of DAA therapy. There is proof of 
concept for shorter -course DAA therapy in the liver transplant sett ing. A multi -center, open label study 
was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a 4 week DAA treatment course using le dipasvir/sofosbuvir 
(LDV/SOF). This was significantly shorter than  the recommended 12 -24 week LDV/SOF treatment 
regimen in HCV+ liver tran splant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. LDV/SOF was dosed immediately before transplant and 
post-transplant to prevent HCV reinfection of the new liver in patients with chronic HCV cirrhosis. Of 
the 16 patients enrolled, 14 achieved a sustained virologic response at 12 weeks ( SVR12) after 
complet ing the 4 week course of DAAs. One patient had a viral relapse after 4 weeks of DAA therapy, 
but achieved SVR12 when retreated with 12 weeks of DAAs. One patient was taken off of DAAs based 
on the study protocol [7].   
 
Most recent ly, the once daily , fixed -dose combination of the NS3/4A protease inhibitor glecaprevir (G) 
and the NS5A inhibitor pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761] (P) has been approved for  the treatment of hepatitis C. Similar to 
other DAA trials, HCV cure rates with G/P are 95 -100% [8].  Moreove r, G-P is approved for a shorter 
treatment course (8 weeks), is effective for all hepatitis C genotypes (1 -6) and is not metabolized by [CONTACT_50833].  Thus , it is potentially the ideal regimen to use as pre - and post -exposure prophylaxis in the 
early post - kidney transplant period [9].  
 
Further proof of concept is demonstrated by [CONTACT_899891] D+/R - kidney transplants that we have 
performed using a clinical innovation protocol with a standard treatment duration (8 weeks) of G -P as 
pre- and post -transplant  prophylaxis. All three recipi[INVESTIGATOR_899875] 8 weeks of G -P following transplant. Of note, all three patients had low level HCV 
viremia on the day after transplant (post -operative day 1 viral loads: 38 , 75 and 20 IU/ml). By 
[CONTACT_144632] 4, the HCV viral load was undetectable in all three recipi[INVESTIGATOR_899876] 2, 12 and 16 weeks after completing DAAs.  
 
Based on the success of these preliminary studies, the objective of our study i s to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of 4 weeks of g lecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_899870] D+/R - kidney transplant.

 4. Study Procedures  
 
This is a single center , open -label , pi[INVESTIGATOR_9416] g lecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_201826] 10 HCV -uninfected 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] ( R-) of kidneys from HCV -infected deceased donors (HCV D+) at Johns Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(JHH). Individuals who meet the inclusion criter ia will be offered enrollment. Informed consent will be 
obtained by a physician on the study team and those who provide info rmed consent will be enrolled. All 
participants will be initiated on oral, once -daily, fixed -dose G -P starting on call to the operating room 
for kidney transplant.  
 
Screening P hase:  HCV antibody and HCV RNA negative individuals on the kidney transplant wai ting 
list at Johns Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (JHH) will be recruite d and screened for eligibility. Individuals who are 
interested in the study will give informed consent. We will approach HCV negative individuals on the 
deceas ed donor kidney transplant wait list who  meet the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_201842]. Currently there are 
over 300 individuals meeting these criteria at JHH. At JHH , approximately 50% of current waitlist 
candidates will accept Infectious Risk Donors (IRDs). We anticipate a lower acceptance rate of HCV + 
deceased donors and estimate a 25% participation rat e. Thus,  we estimate having a pool of at least 50 
eligible screened participants  and our consenting target  is 20 , with 10 transplanted . Once a patient signs 
a consent form, a unique baseline number will  be assigned for identification purposes. Prior to 
transplantation, data on demographics (age, sex, race, etc .), medical history, social history, and renal 
biopsy diagnosis will be collected.   
 
We estimate 2 months for screening and consenting a pool of 20  eligible patients.  At JH the approximate 
wait time for an HCV+ deceased donor is <12 weeks. Therefore, w e anticipate an average of one HCV 
D+/R - transplant per month, with an accrual period of 10 months. Total study duration will therefore be 
24 months.  
 
Accrual  Objective :10 participants  Accrual Period :10 months   Total Study Duration : 24 months  
 
HCV+ Donor I dentification:  Those who provide informed consent for the study will be listed in the 
United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) with a status of “ willin g to accept an HCV+ organ ”. The 
JHH transplant team will then receive HCV+ donor kidney offers for the study participant from Organ 
Procurement Organizations (OPO s). If an HCV+ donor who meets the inclusion criteria is identified, the 
study participants wi ll be offered the organ and , if they accept, they will become an active treatment 
participant. A donor blood sample will be obtained from the OPO for the purposes of this study. 
Currently, offering OPOs only perform a qualitative HCV RNA by [CONTACT_899892]. HCV 
quantification and genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_201843] , and no FDA approved assays exist for this 
indication in organ donors. Donor HCV RNA  quantification and HCV genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_899877] n of treatment. The OPO will ship a donor bloo d sample to 
JHH for HCV genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_899878] . Plasma will be banked for future resistance 
testing if needed.

Adverse Event R eporting  
 
Adverse event reporting will follow th e requirements outlined below. Adve rse events will also be 
recorded and tracked in a safety monitoring database by [CONTACT_473]. Serious adverse events will be 
reported to the Institutional Review Board at Johns Hopkins University according to IRB guidelines and 
to the sponsor.  
 
Partic ipants undergoing solid organ transplantation will be expected to have frequent adverse events 
(AEs) related to the organ transplant surgery and immunosuppressants , which are not  the subject of this 
protocol. This prot ocol focuses on the use of G -P. Grade 3 and Grade 4 AEs and SAEs related to the use 
of G-P will be collected.   
 
All Grade 3 or 4 A Es and all SAEs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_201855] a 
timely manner. All serious adverse events (SAE s) will be reported to the IRB.  Grade 3 or higher AEs 
that are possibly or definitely related to G -P will be reported to the IRB.   
 
Adverse Event (AE) Definition   
Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence associated with the participant’s participation in the 
research, whether or not considered related to the participant’s participation in the research (modified 
from the definition of adverse events in the 1996 International Conference on Harmonization E -6 
Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice) (from OHRP "Guidance on Reviewing and Rep orting 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Participants or Others and Adverse Events (1/15/07)" 
http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html#Q2 )  
 
For this study, an adverse event will include any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence associ ated 
with, but not limited to:   
1. Worsen ing (change in nature, severity  or frequency) of conditions present at the onset of the 
study  
2. Intercurrent illnesses  
3. Infections  
4. Abnormal laboratory values (significant shifts from baseline within the range of normal t hat the 
investigator considers to be clinically important)  
5. Clinically significant abnormalities in physical ex amination, vital signs, weight, and/or tests and 
procedures  
6. Surgical complications  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  Definition   
An adverse event or s uspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of the investigator 
it results in any of the following outcomes (21 CFR 312.32(a)):  
1. Death  
2. A life -threatening event: An AE or SAR is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of the 
inves tigator, its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death. It does not include 
an AE or SAR that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.

Grading and Attribution of Adverse Events  
 
Grading Criteria : 
AEs w ill be graded according to the criteria set forth in the National Cancer Institute’s Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.  This document (referred to herein as 
the NCI -CTCAE manual) provides a common language to describe leve ls of severity, to analyze and 
interpret data, and to articulate the clinical significance of all adverse events.  
 
Adverse events will be graded on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the following standards in the NCI -
CTCAE manual:  
Grade 1 = mild adverse ev ent. 
Grade 2 = moderate adverse event.  
Grade 3 = severe and undesirable adverse event.  
Grade 4 = life -threatening or disabling adverse event.  
Grade 5 = death.  
 
Events grade 3 or higher that are possibly or definitely related to study procedures or interven tion will 
be collected on AE case report.  
 
Attribution Definitions : 
The relationship, or attribution, of an adverse event to the study intervention or study procedures will 
initially be determined by [CONTACT_093].  For additional information and a prin table version of the 
NCI-CTCAE manual, consult the NCI -CTCAE web site: http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html.  
 
Unrelated:  The adverse event is clearly not related; there is insufficient evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship.  
 
Possibly R elated:  The adverse event has a reasonable possibility to be related; there is evidence 
to suggest a causal relationship.  
 
Definitely R elated:  The adverse event is clearly related.

by [CONTACT_201866].  
 
Collecting Adverse Events  
Adverse events (including SAEs) may be discovered through any of these methods:  
1. Observing the par ticipant  
2. Interviewing the participant [e.g., using a checklist, structu red questioning, diary, etc.]  
3. Receiving an unsolicited  complaint from the participant  
4. In addition, an abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation can also indicate  
an adverse event, as defined in Section 2.9.3, Grading an d Attribution of Adverse Events  
 
Recording Adverse Events  
Throughout the study, the investigator will review all grade 3 or higher AEs and if potentially related t o 
a study medication, will report t hem to the IRB.  All SAEs will be reported to the IRB.  
 
Once reported, an AE/SAE will be followed until it resol ves with or without sequelae, or  until the end of 
study participation, or until 30 days after the participant prematurely withdraw s (without with drawing 
consent) or is withdrawn from the study, whichever occurs first.

Glecaprevir 300 mg/pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761] 120 mg will be provided by [CONTACT_1758] , dispensed from the 
Investigational Drug Service (IDS) . The G-P orally will be initiated on  call to the operating room for 
kidney transplantation. Dosing will continue every 24 hours postoperatively throug h week 4 after 
transplantation for donors with any genotype of HCV (GT 1-6). 
 
Rescue Treatment   
With the availability of a pan -genotypic HCV medication that is safe to use with renal dysfunction,  we 
expect all recipi[INVESTIGATOR_201857] G -P. However, we will perform genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_201858] a treatment failure. Based on the results of 
our initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_899888] ( EXPANDER -1), we expect about half of donors to ha ve 
genotype [ADDRESS_1261633] recent AASLD/IDSA HCV treatment guidelines (hcvguidelines.org) would be followed to 
select the most appropriate regimen to use in any cases of HCV infection. This wou ld be considered 
clinical care.   
 
 
 
7. Study Statistics

  The primary outcome  will be the proportion of kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_201859] 12 weeks after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056].  
 
B. Secondary Outcome Variables:  
 Detection of HCV antibodies  
 Allograft function at 6 and 12 months  
 Measurement of T cell response to HCV peptides  
 If there are transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_899889], we will meas ure prevalence of NS3 and NS5A mutations in 
HCV from the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_201861]. Mutation testing will be guided by [CONTACT_899893].  
 
C. Statistical plan including  sample size justification and inte rim data analysis:  
The Johns Hopkins group will be  responsible for collec ting data, maintaining the database, and data 
analysis. Both our transplant surgery and transplant infectious disease group have extensive 
experience leading hepatitis C treatment studies and multicenter NIH -funded studies examining 
outcomes in transplant.   
 
Our Transplant Infectious Disease Group has an active prospective database collecting outcomes, 
including infectious complications, on the JH cohort of all soli d organ transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. The 
cohort design facilitates use of s tandardized outcomes definitions, prospective capture of event -
driven data, and collection of information after disch arge from the referral center. Expanding on 
these existing protocols and infrastructure, we will leverage infrastructure and resources from  the JH 
Comprehensive Transplant Cente r (CTC) for the planned study. Moreover, the JH Transplant and 
Oncology Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Coordinating Center (Infectious Diseases) has 
committed support for document development and regulatory supp ort. These groups have staff 
dedicated to regulatory oversight and development and compliance with reporting requirements  
 
Data Collection M echanism :   
Data collection will be performed using the REDCap electronic data collection and storage hosted by 
[INVESTIGATOR_3673] s Hopkins University. All data in REDCap will be de -identified. Each site will maintain a 
record of which subject corresponds to subject numbers assigned by [CONTACT_61604]. This file will be 
password protected if electronic or kept in a locked location if in the s ubject binder.  
 
In brief, the REDCap Consortium consists of 84 institutional partners from CTSA, GCRC, RCMI 
and other institutions, in which JH is an active participant. It was developed by [CONTACT_899894], with the goal of enabling investigato r research through the establishment of a more user -
friendly database system. This consortium supports two secure web -based applications designed to 
enable data capture for research studies. The software contains an intuitive interface for collecting 
data with data validation commands, allows for automated export procedures to statistical packages 
(e.g. SAS) and provides advanced features that allow for branching logic, file uploading, etc. The 
system itself is supported on MySQL, an open source database si milar to SQL/Oracle, and operates 
on a web -based system. All servers are backed -up at each data center (institution) and include 
password protection to provide enhanced security while maintaining accessibility via the internet.

 Upon enro llment of subjects, the REDCap database constructs a calendar of anticipated events, 
which includes completion of follow -up case report forms, with electronic reminders  
 
Power/Sample S ize:   
Figure 4.  We hypothesize that the treatment strategy will be 100%  effective and that the HC V 
RNA<LLOQ in all [ADDRESS_1261634] a difference  depends on the true efficacy. For example , if the true efficacy is 79%, then we 
will have at least one obse rved outcome 90.5 3% of the time (1 -.79^10). F igure  4 demonstrates the 
relationship between the true efficacy and the power of the proposed study.  
 
 
 
 
8. Risks  
 
A. Medical Risks : 
Although it has not been reported, due to acute  infection with hepatitis C, there i s a slight risk of 
acquiring hepatitis C, fulminant hepatitis, and death.  
 
Glecaprevir/P ibrentasvir : 
The most common side effects with these drugs are nausea, headache, and fatigue.  
 
Blood Dra w: 
Taking blood may cause discomfort, bleeding or bruising whe re the needle enters the body. In rare 
cases, it may result in fainting. There is a small risk of infection.  
 
B. Steps taken to minimize the risks : 
 
Medication Side Effects:  
Participants will be monitored closely and instructed to report any change in the ir me dical condition 
promptly. Side effects will be assessed and managed as clinically indicated.  
 
Blood Draw:  
Only properly trained clinical staff will draw blood. The amount of blood collected is the minimal 
amount for proper analysis.  
 
C. Plan for reporting un anticipat ed problems or study deviations :

Page 14 of 16 
  
Recording Adverse Events:  
Throughout the study, the investigator will review all grade 3 or higher AEs and if potentially r elated 
to a study medication, will report them to the IRB. All SAEs will be reported to th e IRB.  Once 
reported, an AE/SAE will be followed until it resolves with or without sequelae, or until the end of 
study participation, or until 30 days after the participant prematurely withdraw s (without 
withdrawing consent) or is withdrawn from the study,  whichever occurs first.   
 
Reporting of Other Safety Information : 
An investigator shal l promptly notify the site IRB when an “unanticipated problem involving risks to 
participants or others” is identified, which is not otherwise reportable as an adverse ev ent. 
 
D. Legal risks such as the risks that would be associated  with breach of confidentiality : 
The principal legal risk regarding a breach of confidentiality of subjects on this study concerns 
responsibility for potential retribution by [CONTACT_423]’s employe r or insurance company to their 
medical condition and risks associated with this research. A variety of mechanisms have been 
established to protect the confidentiality of medical records and data procured in this project. Access 
to the database is controll ed through passwords. Access to the work site is controlled through 
passkeys. Although the study team will maintain a password -protected spreadsheet linking subject 
numbers to identifiable patient information, any research generated will be completely de -identified 
for reporting purposes.  
 
E. Financial risks to the participant s: 
The subject will receive the Insurance and Research Participant Financial Responsibility Information 
Sheet , which will include the procedures and tests that will be paid for by [CONTACT_507695], as well as those 
billed to the subject’s health insurer. If the subject has health insurance, they will be responsible for 
any co -pays or deductibles not covered by [CONTACT_38279].  
 
 
9. Benefits  
Participants  may re ceive an organ offer for an HCV -infected  organ sooner than if they waited for an 
HCV -uninfected organ. This may have a survival benefit to the participant.  
 
 
 
10. Payment and Remuneration  
Study participants will receive a parking voucher for each study visit.  
 
 
 
11. Costs  
Research blood draws and stud y drug will be paid for by [CONTACT_138314]  (no cost to the participant). All other 
procedures, test, and drugs  are p art of standard clinical care for  organ transplantation  and will be billed 
to the participant and/or their health insurer.

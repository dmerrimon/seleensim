1 Introduction 
 
1.1 XR-NTX Background  
 
Extended -release naltrexone (XR -NTX; Market name: [CONTACT_744798]® ) is a 30-day, extended release formulation of the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2634], naltrexone, and is  a 380mg/vial suspension  delivered monthly via intramuscular 
injection. It is chemically designated as morphinan-6-one, 17 (cyclopropylmethyl) 4,5-epoxy -3,14-dihydroxy -(5α) 
(CAS registry #[ZIP_CODE]-41-3). The molecular formula is C 20H23NO 4, and its molecular weight is 341.[ADDRESS_1018777] been shown to reduce craving, heavy drinking and relapse severity.4,5 Although its mechanism  of action  is not 
fully understood , research has suggested it may work as shown in Figure 2.6-9

1.2 XR-NTX  Effectiveness  
 
In understanding the effectiveness of XR -NTX , it is important to include a review of the substantial scientific 
literature on oral -dose naltrexone that served as its precursor. In two, initial, 12 -week double-blind, placebo -
controlled trials, naltrexone (plus psychosocial treatment) was found to be well-tolerated by [CONTACT_1962]. Nal trexone 
was also associated with significantly less alcohol craving and fewer drinking days compared to placebo plus psychosocial treatment.
2,[ADDRESS_1018778] 
shown  naltrexone’s modest yet consistent effects in reducing drinking rates, relapse severity and craving.4,11-[ADDRESS_1018779] shown support for oral naltrexone in reducing heavy -drinking outcomes, a sizeable barrier to 
its consistent use has been relatively low treatment compliance.15-17  XR-NTX  was i ntroduced to overcome these  
challenges: it is administered by a health-care provider once a month instead of self -administered once a day. To 
date, a handful of XR -NTX  trials have been conducted and have shown promising effects.5,18,[ADDRESS_1018780]. JC Garbutt, was the lead author on the primary 
publication from that trial. In addition to 12 psychosocial intervention sessions, participants ( N = 626) were 
randomized to receive monthly intramuscular injections of either 380mg or 190mg of  XR-NTX  or matching placebo. 
Compared with placebo, the 380mg formulation resulted in a statistically significant 25% reduction in heavy 
drinking. The lower -dose ( 190mg ) formulation did not result in statistically significant reductions compared to 
placebo. Participants who were initially abstinent evinced greater treatment gains.  Discontinuation rates due to side effects and  adverse events were 14.1% in 38 0mg gr oup, 6.7% in 190mg group and 6.7% in placebo group.
5 
 Secondary analyses conducted using data from the previous study indicated that XR -NTX  was also associated with 
significant, self -reported improvements in quality of life (i.e., overall mental health, social functioning, general 
health, and physical functioning domains).
[ADDRESS_1018781] 5% of patients at 
least twice the rate of placebo, include pain, tenderness, swelling, bruising and/or itching at the injection site, 
nausea, headache, fatigue, dizziness, vomiting, decreased appetite, painful joints and muscle cramps .5,22,[ADDRESS_1018782], it reduces the effectiveness of opi[INVESTIGATOR_238652].  There may also be a slightly elevated risk for eosinophilic pneumonia, depression  and suicid ality. As with 
any medication, there is a risk of drug hypersensitivity, although allergic reactions to XR -NTX are very rare. In some 
cases, reactions at the injection site may become severe. Injection sites should be monitored by a health-care provider for pote ntial hardening, inflammation, nodules and swelling, and in extreme cases, necrosis. Injection site 
reactions can usually be avoided by [CONTACT_744760] b efore the medication is injected.

Finally, until recently, there was a ‘‘black -box’’ warning on XR -NTX regarding potential hepatocellular injury. This 
warning was rescinded in late July 2013. The warning had originally  followed from early naltrexone studies, which 
prescribed daily oral doses of up to 350mg for treatment of obesity and dementia —seven times the currently 
recommended oral dose.24 Although current FDA labeling indicates that XR- NTX may be  associated with liver injury 
primarily if it is administered in “excessive doses” or to patients with “acute hepatitis or liver failure,”22 there are no 
reports of hepatotoxicity involving XR -NTX.25 The large-scale, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of XR -NTX mentioned 
above indicated no significant differences in participants’ live r function throughout the study, even among 
participants with previously elevated liver enzymes.23 Gamma -glutamyl transferase ( GGT ) levels were lower among 
those receiving XR -NTX compared to placebo during the study, likely due to decreased drinking.[ADDRESS_1018783], it has been suggested  that there is greater risk of 
hepatotoxicity from continued, heavy alcohol use than from appropriate naltrexone administration.27 That said, XR-
NTX has not yet been extensively studied in patients with pre-existing, severe liver damage.  
 
1.4 Study Rationale  
 
Alcohol dependence among homeless individuals is a serious public health issue. A meta -analysis of international 
studies showed a mean of 38% of homeless individuals are affected by [CONTACT_744761],28 which is ten times the 
prevalence of alcohol dependence in the general US population (3.8%) .29 Alcohol dependence interferes with tasks 
of daily living, such as attaining and maintaining housing, employment and social networks.30-32 The more severe 
alcohol dependence that often affects homeless individuals is associated with both acute (e.g., accidents, falls, 
violence) and chronic (e.g., chronic liver disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, encephalopathies) alcohol -related 
harm,30,[ADDRESS_1018784], studies show 
that few homeless people start treatment (15 -28%),40,41 and even fewer complete it (2.5-33%).42 An NIAAA review 
showed that treatment engagement in this population decreased as program demands —particularly abstinence—
increased.[ADDRESS_1018785], our own and other research groups’ studies show that many of the most severely 
affected i ndividuals do not find abstinence-based goals or treatments to be acceptable or desirable.43,[ADDRESS_1018786] that repeated failed treatment 
attempts erode self -efficacy and self -contro l for later behavior change.47,48 This observation is particularly relevant 
for this population: one of our recent studies showed a mean of [ADDRESS_1018787] alcohol treatment attempts in a sample of 
homeless individuals with alcohol dependence.49 Additionally, inpatient detoxification, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a medical necessity 
for this population, is expensive and can lead to a “revolving door” of treatment,50,[ADDRESS_1018788] is a concern in this 
population because an increasing number of alcohol withdrawals and medical detoxifications can precipi[INVESTIGATOR_744707] (i.e., kindling effect),52 which may make 
abstinence -based treatment a more harmful course of action for some more severely affected individuals.

New approaches are necessary that are compatible with this population’s needs . New approaches, which remove 
the barrier of abstinence t o treatment engagement, have recently begun to be applied with chronically homeless 
individuals with alcohol problems.30,49,53,[ADDRESS_1018789] a promising medication, XR-NTX, to support  alcohol harm reduction among homeless people with alcohol 
dependence.  
 
XR-NTX  appears to be a good fit to this population’s needs and harm -reduction goals . Unlike other 
pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_744708] (e.g., disulfiram), naltrexone and XR -NTX are safe and effective among 
both individuals who are abstinent10,[ADDRESS_1018790] shown that naltrexone may be safely and  effectively used in 
the context of drinking moderation treatments.61,62 Finally, because it is a monthly injectable versus a daily oral 
medication, XR -NTX may help support medication adherence and greater follow -up with health-care professionals, 
which often poses a challenge for homeless individuals.63-65 Taken together, these features make XR-NTX compatible 
with the needs and goals of this population  and with the existing harm-reduction approaches used by [CONTACT_744762] -based agencies that serve them.  
 
Our preliminary pi[INVESTIGATOR_744709]-NTX in this population. In advance of th e HaRP  Study , the 
research team conducted a single-arm, open -label, 12 -week pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] ( N=24). The pi[INVESTIGATOR_744710]  2 Seattle-based, nonprofit agencies on the forefront of harm-reduction service provision for homeless people: 
the Downtown Emergency Service Center (DESC) and Evergreen Treatment Service’s REACH Program. Both agencies 
expressed interest in developi[INVESTIGATOR_744711]-specific treatments designed to help clients reduce their 
alcohol -related harm. This interest was sparked by [CONTACT_744763]’ high prevalence of alcohol dependence 
(approximately 33% of DESC clients and 85% of REACH clients) and the acknowledgment that most of their clients 
are not ready, willing and/or able to engage in abstinence -based treatment.  
 
The aims of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_744712] -fold. The first aim was to develop and pi[INVESTIGATOR_744713] 
(i.e., study protocol, IRB application, population -appropriate measures, manuals). The second aim was to assess the 
initial feasibility, safety and effectiveness of XR -NTX with [ADDRESS_1018791] been shown to be feasible. Of the 45 individuals approached, 42 consented 
to study participation, and 31 qualified for participation. Twenty -four  participants received the full, 3-month 
treatment course. The medication and study procedures were discontinued for one participant because he 
voluntarily enrolled in inpatient detoxifica tion and long-term alcohol treatment following his second injection, which 
was considered a positive treatment outcome. Three other  participants refused the second injection due to 
discomfort at the injection site. All did, however, agree to continue with follow-up procedures. Additionally, one 
individual died (determined to be unrelated to the study medication) , and two others were lost to follow -up when 
they were jailed over an extended period.  
 
The extent of adverse events as measured by [CONTACT_744764] 
(SAFTEE)66,67 remained stable (i.e., participants endorsed a median of 6 symptoms) from baseline through the follow -
up period, although the severity of these symptoms decreased over the treatment course. Serious adverse events 
were determined to be un associat ed with the study medication. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_243379], findings showed 
significant baseline-to -posttest improvements on alcohol outcomes. Specifically, participants decreased their 
median peak drinking quantity from [ADDRESS_1018792] drinks (Wilcoxon signed rank z =-3.00, p=.0 03) and their 
University of Washington - Collins  
Harm Reduction with Pharmacotherapy (HaRP)  8 
 
median frequency from 30 to 25 days a month ( z=-2.07, p=.04 ).  Participants also reported a 60% reduction in 
alcohol -related problems ( z=-3.87, p<.001), and a 33 % reduction in alcohol craving ( z=-3.31 , p=.001). Regarding 
acceptability of XR-NTX, 15 of the 24 participants who completed the treatment course wanted to continue XR -NTX 
off-study. These participants credited the treatment for their reduced alcohol craving and for support in making 
changes in their drinking. One participant said, “I swear to God your program is really helpi[INVESTIGATOR_219155] a lot because I 
don’t need [the alcohol]. I think your program is great. It’s working on me.” Another participant noted, “This 
program is really helpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. My daughter asked me the other day, ‘Mom, why didn’t they make this drug years ago? 
You’re doing so good, and I’m so proud of you.’ That means a lot to me.”  
 
2 Study Objectives  
 
The proposed Phase II study will expand upon the pi[INVESTIGATOR_744714] a larger, randomized controlled trial (RCT).  
The [ADDRESS_1018793] ( N=300) will include a [ADDRESS_1018794] the relative efficacy of 3 active treatment 
combinations —1) XR -NTX+harm reduction counseling, 2) placebo+harm reduction counseling and 3) harm reduction 
counseling only (HRC) —compared to the services as usual (TAU) that all participants receive from community 
agencies. This design will allow us to dismantle active treatment components and thereby [CONTACT_744765] “placebo 
effects” of both the administration of an injection and attention from a medical professional that have been found in previous studies.
68,[ADDRESS_1018795] the relative efficacy of XR -NTX, placebo and HRC compared to TAU.  
 
Hypothesis 1A:  Compared to the TAU group, the 3 active treatment (XR- NTX, placebo, HRC) groups will 
evince significantly greater decreases in alcohol quantity, frequency and alcohol -related problems.  
 Hypothesis 1B:  The XR-NTX group will evince greater decreases in alco hol quantity, frequency and 
alcohol -related problems than the placebo group.  
 
Specific aim [ADDRESS_1018796] theory -based mediators of treatment effects.  
 
Hypothesis 2A:  Because the [ADDRESS_1018797] that reduces harm. In turn, these increases in motivation to change will mediate the active treatment  effects on alcohol outcomes.  
 
Hypothesis 2B:  Given naltrexone’s putative clinical mechanisms, the XR -NTX group will experience 
significant decreases on craving compared to the placebo group. In turn, these decreases in alcohol 
craving will mediate the eff ects of XR- NTX versus placebo on alcohol outcomes.  
 
Specific aim [ADDRESS_1018798] treatment effects on publicly funded service costs.  
 
Hypothesis 3A:  It is hypothesized that the XR -NTX, placebo and HRC groups will show greater decreases 
in publicly funded service costs (i.e., costs resulting from emergency medical services, ER visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124021], and county jail) than the TAU group.  
University of Washington - Collins  
Harm Reduction with Pharmacotherapy (HaRP)  [ADDRESS_1018799] ( N=300) testing the relative efficacy of XR -NTX+harm reduction 
counseling (XR -NTX), placebo+harm reduction counseling (placebo), and harm reduction counseling alone (HRC) 
compared to supportive services (TAU) provided by [CONTACT_744766]-based agencies (see Figure 3 ). Within this design, 
we will also compare the efficacy of XR- NTX and placebo with both participants and researchers blind to 
medication condition. The study features a [ADDRESS_1018800] for 
potential delayed treatment effects or treatment decay.  
 After careful consideration of the potential benefits and drawbacks (e.g., sample size, study cost) of conducting the 
proposed 4 -arm design versus a more traditional 2 -arm (XR -NTX and placebo) design, we decided on the former for 
a few important reasons. First, naltrexone and XR -NTX are well-researched, FDA-approved medications for the 
treatment of alcohol dependence.
4,24,70,71 Therefore, it was deemed appropriate to integrate more differentiated 
research questions into the current study, which seeks to expand the evidence base for the use of this medication. 
Second, the COMBINE study evinced a “significant placebo effect” for naltrexone, which researchers attributed to 
participants’ expectancies regarding medications as well as the effects of alcohol counseling from a medical 
professional, which was embedded within medication management sessions68,69 and has become de rigueur  in 
clinical drug trials for alcohol dependence.5,71-73 It is therefore important to method ologically control for these  
“placebo effects” to account for the active components facilitating parti cipants’ behavior change. Third, because 
there is currently no generic formulation, the expense of the prescription and administration of XR -NTX is 
considerable. It is therefore important to determine whether the medication is not only superior to a placebo, but whether it is superior to harm-reduction counseling alone, which could be provided at lower cost. This study was therefore designed to determine the relative contributions of a) harm -reduction counseling (HRC) with a medical 
professional, b) the pla cebo effect (placebo), and c) the medication effect (XR -NTX) relative to the usual 
psychosocial, harm -reduction services provided by [CONTACT_29436] -based agencies (TAU).

Participants ( N = 300) will be adults (21-65 years old) with alcohol dependence who are or have been homeless in 
the past year.  The McKinney -Vento Homeless Assistance Act74 defines homelessnes s as lacking a fixed, regular and 
adequate nighttime residence; having a primary nighttime dwelling that is not a regular sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_744715]; 
living in a supervised shelter or transitional housing; exiting an institution that served as temporary reside nce when 
the individual had previously resided in a shelter or place not meant for human habitation; or facing imminent loss 
of housing when no subsequent residence is identified and insufficient resources/support networks exist. 
 We will not limit the sample to currently homeless individuals for the following reasons. First, agencies serving homeless individuals prioritize assisting their clients to achieve housing. It would therefore be neither ethical nor 
practical to limit our recruitment to only those clients who remain consistently homeless versus those who become 
sheltered, transitionally or permanently housed after years of chronic homelessness. Further, because a return to 
homelessness is not uncommon,
75,76 the proposed population is likely to be more representative of the often cyclic 
nature of homelessness. On the other hand, it is clinically important to understand whether treatment effects differ according to housing status. We will therefore include current housing status as a time-varying covariate in outcome analyses . 
3.2.1 Inclusion criteria  
 
Inclusion criteria will include receiving services  from  one of the named partnering agencies, being 
between 21 and 65 years of age, agreeing to use an adequate form of birth control (if female and in 
childbearing years ; includes oral, injectable or implanted hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine devices 
(IUDs)/intrauterine systems (IUSs), barrier method of condoms plus spermicidal foam, true abstinence), and fulfilling criteria for current alcohol dependence according to DSM -IV-TR criteria as determined by 
[CONTACT_57404] -I/P.
77 
 
3.2.2 Participant  exclusion criteria  
 
Exclusion criteria will include refusal or inability to consent to participation in research, constituting a 
risk to safety and security of other clients or staff, known sensitivity or allergy to naltrexone/XR -NTX, 
current treatment with naltrexone/XR- NTX,  being pregnant or nursing, concurrent participation in a 
clinical study involving an unapproved, experimental drug,  suicide attempts within the past year, renal 
insufficiency/serum creatinine level > 2 , current opi[INVESTIGATOR_744716] -IV-TR 
criteria, liver transaminases (AST, ALT) > 5 times the u pper limit of normal (ULN), a clinical diagnosis  of 
deco mpensated liver disease, or other condition deemed by [INVESTIGATOR_678] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or Medical 
Director to make study participation clinically uns afe. 
 
To increase external validity of the findings and to recruit in accordance with harm reduction 
principles, we have limited the exclusion criteria to only those that are necessary to minimize risks to 
participants’ health and safety. To further reduce  these potential risks, we will a) regularly assess 
health and safety (e.g., monthly collection/monitoring of blood and urine tests, urine toxicology  and 
pregancy  tests at baseline and prior to injections, regular suicide assessments, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/agency recor ds, 
etc.); b) discuss participants’ cases weekly; c) consult with an addiction medicine specialist and 
internist (Merrill) on a weekly basis  to evaluate participants’ health status; and d) meet and review 
reports biannually with a  Data Safety Monitoring Bo ard, including a psychiatrist, internal medicine 
physician, hepatologist (liver specialist), and clinical psychologist/statistician . By [CONTACT_744767], we will maximize the generalizability of the current findings to more severely affected 
populations78 and will act in accordance with the agencies’ existing and effective low -barrier, harm 
reduction approaches.43,49,56,79

3.3 Measures and Materials  
 
3.3.1 Measures  
 
Please see Table 1  below for the assessment schedule for each of the following measures.  
 
Measures for determining eligibility. Ability to consent will be assessed during the information session 
using the UCSD Brief Assessment of Capacity to Consent (UBACC).80 This 10 -item, 3 -point Likert -scale 
measure ensures participants understand the study protocol, potential risks/benefits and their rights as participants prior to study enrollment. The Alcohol Use Disorders Inventory Checklist  – Consumption 
(AUDIT -C),
81,82 which is a three-item, psychometrically sound measure of hazardous and harmful 
patterns of alcohol consumption, will be used to screen participants for alcohol dependence prior to study recruitment. We  will use a cut -off score of ≥ 4 points, which has optimal sensitivity and specificity 
for detecting alcohol -use disorders.
83,84 The Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation  (BSS) is a reliable and valid 
tool to assess suicidal ideation and behavior.85 It will be used to assess  participants’ current suicidality to 
determine fulfillment of exclusion criteria  at baseline and will be regularly assessed in weeks 4 -36. 
Further, the Self -injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview-Suicide Attempts subscale  (SITBI -SA), which 
measures lifetime experience of suicidal behaviors, will likewise help determine fulfilment of exclusion criteria at baseline and will be administered at all subsequent assessment timepoints (weeks 4 -36).
86 
The alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_744717] -IV-TR SCID -I/P77 will be used to document 
fulfillment of inclusion/exclusion criteria  and will be administered again in Weeks 4 -36. 
 Measures for sample description.  The Personal Information Questionnaire (PIQ)  will assess age, gender, 
race, ethnicity, education, employment, military experience, other research study participation and 
exper ience of homelessness in the past year.
87 The Housing Timeline Followback (TLFB-H)88,89 is a set of 
calendars that documents housing status by [CONTACT_744768]/spent the night each 
day in the past [ADDRESS_1018801]. The  Motivation-to -change Ruler  comprises four, 10-point scales 
assessing participants’ motivation, readiness, importance and confidence to change their alcohol use in 
a way that reduces harm. Such [ADDRESS_1018802] been shown to be valid and 
clinically useful measures of motivation across various populations.
90-92 
 Measures of alcohol -use outcomes.  The Alcohol and Substance -use Frequency Assessment questions 
were adapted from the ASI,
93 and will be used to assess frequency of us e of alcohol and other drugs. The 
Alcohol Quantity  Use Assessment (AQUA) was created in the context of a previous study with this 
population,[ADDRESS_1018803] Vivitrol® pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. As necessary due to cognitive deficits, 
we will also use a set of monthly calendars to allow  for prospective or retrospective evaluation of 
alcohol and other drugs for each day of the previous month.88 The Short Inventory of Problems (SIP -2R) 
is a 15 -item, Likert -scale questionnaire that measures social, occupatio nal and psychological alcohol -
related problems.94 The summary score will serve as the alcohol -related problems outcome measure. 
Alcohol craving will be measured using the psychometrically valid, 5 -item, Likert -scale Penn Alcohol 
Craving Scale  (PACS).95 The alcohol craving summary score will be used as a mediator of the 
hypothesized treatment effects.  
 Measures of q uality -of-life outcomes. The Short Form – 12
96 is a well-validated, 12-item questionnaire 
that assesses quality-of -life outcomes in two primary areas: physical and mental health.   
University of Washington - Collins  
Harm Reduction with Pharmacotherapy (HaRP)  12 
 
 
Measures supporting medication management. The Case Report Form  (CRF) will be used to a) 
summarize clinically relevant a ssessment data for the study physician/nurse (e.g., alcohol -use disorder 
diagnosis, fulfillment of inclusion/exclusion criteria); b) compi[INVESTIGATOR_744718]; c) provide an outline during the physical exam and medication management; and  d) record clinical data 
during the physical exam and medication management sessions. The Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Effects  (SAFTEE) interview,
66,67 which was tailored for use with this medication, 
includes open -ended, categorical and Likert -scale questions assessing symptoms that correspond to 
potential adverse events associated with XR -NTX. This measure will be embedded in the CRF .

Measures for utilization and cost analysis.  Administrative data on publicly funded service utilization will 
be obtained from the King County Correctional Facility, King County Medic One/Emergency Medical Services, Harborview Medical Center (HMC ), and the Washington State Comprehensive Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_744719] (CHARS) for the 2-year pre -study period through the follow -up period. We 
will obtain participant consent and HIPAA authorizations for these data at the information session. We 
will collect the following data: a) number of Medic One/EMS dispatches and associated costs; b) number 
of ER visits and associated costs; c) number of inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614], outpatient visits  and total 
costs per admission (CHARS and HMC); d) number of  bookings, length of stay and daily cost for the King 
County Correctional Facility. These data will be used to create overall cost outcomes.  
 Treatment integrity materials and measures.  Manual adherence and competence for the HRC, placebo 
and XR -NTX sessions will be measured using the HaRP Adherence and Competence Coding Manual and 
the HaRP Coding Scale.  The coding system, which is  based on the COMBINE Study Medical Management 
Adherence Checklist and coding schema,
73,97 consists of 7 dimensions to assess delivery of the HaRP 
style and content (i.e., informativeness, direction, authoritativeness,  warmth, manual adherence, 
avoidance of nonmanualized components, overall). Dimensions will be rated on 7 -point Likert scales, 
where 0=absence of the characteristic and 6=very high levels of the characteristic (within top 10% of 
providers). The Participant Satisfaction Assessment is a semistructured interview with open-ended 
University of Washington - Collins  
Harm Reduction with Pharmacotherapy (HaRP)  13 
 
questions and prompts to as sess participants’  receipt of and  satisfaction with the study procedures  at 
the final assessment.  
 
Research staff, including bachelor -level research assistants, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, 
will conduct treatment integrity rating under the supervision of the PI, who is a licensed clinical 
psychologist with 15 years of experience conducting treatment integrity ratings and analysis. An 
extensive training protocol developed during prior evaluations will be utilized. Raters will receive 16 hours of training and supervision before they begin independently recruiting and assessing participants. Training will include written instructions and group coding sessions with feedback from the PI. Sessions  
will be coded independently; however, regular supervision and periodic interrater consistency analyses 
will be conducted to reduce the risk of rater dr ift. 
3.3.2 Lab Tests and Materials  
 
Blood tests will be conducted on all participants at baseline and weeks 4, 8, 12, 24 and 36, and will 
include a complete blood count (CBC), a basic metabolic panel (CHEM 7), and a liver panel (AST, ALT, ALP, albumin, bilirubin total and direct). These tests will be conducted to assess liver and renal 
functioning and to detect other medical conditions that may contraindicate the use of XR -NTX or may be 
important to monitor during its administration. If participants in the two medication arms evince 
AST/ALT greater than [ADDRESS_1018804]/ALT have not decreased below that point, the study medication will be discontinued to ensure participant safety.  
 
Urine tests will include a) complete urinalysis (UA), which will be used to detect further contraindicating 
conditions (e.g., renal damage)  at baseline and monthly; b) a urine toxicology dipstick, which will be 
used in the XR-NTX and placebo conditions to detect the presence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_744720]; c) an hCG dipstick pregnancy test for women in childbearing years at baseline and prior to each injection ; and d) ethyl glucuronide (EtG) tests,
[ADDRESS_1018805] shown that EtG is positively associated with self -reported alcohol quantity.
99,100 
 
3.4 Randomization Scheme  
 
The current study will involve four treatment arms. Participants will be randomized to one of the four  treatment 
arms  using a permuted b lock randomization with stratification.  The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_744721] 11.2 (Statacorp, 2009).  This program provides a sequence of 
treatments randomly permuted in blocks of constant or varying size with the ability to stratify  the allocation. For the 
current  study, equal blocks of four were used to minimize the risk of potential imbalance in the treatment  arms, and 
the allocat ion was stratified by [CONTACT_744770] (i.e., housed or homeless at time of randomization). 
 The randomization scheme  will be given to the University of Washington Investigational Drug Services (IDS)  in the 
form of a series of spreadsheets . The IDS  will be responsible for randomizing qualifying participants  by [CONTACT_744771] s. The two arms of the study  receiving injections  will be double-
blind ed in that the investigators will not know which participants are allocated to which group (placebo versus active 
medication) . Further, IDS staff --not the investigators --will administer the randomization scheme so as to minimize 
selection bias  for all groups.  
 3.5 Study T reatment  
 
University of Washington - Collins  
Harm Reduction with Pharmacotherapy (HaRP)  [ADDRESS_1018806] minimal condition is TAU , which will comprise the 
agencies’ harm -reduction oriented “supportive services as usual” that will be provided to all participants in all 
groups for the duration of the trial and beyond. One of the partnering agency’s programs includes provision of 
emergency shelter and/or permanent, supportive housing. Both agencies provide supportive services that are tailored to the needs of individual clients and include outreach; case ma nagement; nursing/medical care; access to 
external service providers, as needed (e.g., more intensive medical or psychiatric treatment, chemical dependency counseling, etc); and /or assistance with basic needs (i.e., food, clothing, income, housing). Like t he other treatment 
conditions, participants in the TAU condition will also undergo regular assessments at baseline and weeks 4, 8, 12, 
24, and 36.  
 
The remaining three conditions (XR-NTX, placebo and HRC) are considered active treatment conditions and will all include monthly, alcohol -specific, harm- reduction counseling sessions that will be delivered by [CONTACT_744772]/nurses. A harm reduction style, which will involve a nonjudgmental, empathetic stance, unconditional positive regard, and acceptance of clients wherever they fall on the spectrum of readiness to change,
[ADDRESS_1018807], it is compatible with the agencies’ current clinical and case management approaches. Second, the research team’s preliminary findings in these settings indicate that a client-centered style helps providers best align with clients and build appropriate and positive rapport to support behavior change.
[ADDRESS_1018808], research has confirmed the superior efficacy of a client -centered versus confrontational 
style in therapeutic interactions.101- 103 Finally, a client -centered style has been shown to be helpful in other 
interventions involving homeless individuals.104 
 The HRC condition will involve harm-reduction counseling components. At appointments, study physicians/nurses will a) provide personalized feedback about alcohol assessments and lab tests, b) assess vital signs and concomitant medications,  c) obtain medical history (baseline only), d) assess for adverse events using the SAFTEE, e) conduct a  
physical exam (baseline and as clinically indicated), f) elicit participants’ harm reduction goals and progress made 
towards them, and g) discuss and secure commitment for safer drinking using the Safer Drinking Strategies worksheet. These components have been tested in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_744722]
55 
and clinical practice60 as well as evidence-based motivational enhancement.92,105 Study physicians/nurses will use the 
HaRP  treatment manual to guide the session and will record participants’ in -session data on the CRF.  
 The XR-NTX and placebo conditions will receive harm -reduction counseling components + medication 
administration/management. At each appointment, study physici ans/nurses will a) provide personalized feedback 
about alcohol assessments and lab tests, b) assess vital signs and concomitant medications,  c) obtain medical history 
(baseline only), d) assess for adverse events using the SAFTEE, e) conduct a br ief physic al exam (baseline and as 
clinically indicated), f) provide medication management (discuss the medication, side effects and ways to manage them , including provision of 2, 25mg tabs of over -the-counter antihistamine meclizine; ensure participants have 
medica tion bracelets/dogtags; provide emergency contact [CONTACT_3031]), g) elicit harm reduction goals and progress 
made towards them, h) discuss and secure commitment for safer drinking using the Safer Drinking Strategies worksheet, and i) administer XR -NTX/placebo. Study physicians/nurses will use the HaRP treatment manual to guide 
the session and will record participants’ in-session data on the CRF.  
 
Participants will take  urine toxicology and pregnancy dipstick tests immediately prior to the first injection. If 
participants test negative for pregnancy and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], study physicians/nurses will administer the injection into the 
gluteal muscle, alternating buttocks for each subsequent injection.  If participants test positive for hCG , they will be 
withdrawn from the study. If participants test positive for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], the injection will not be administered, the 
positive test result will be discussed, and current opi[INVESTIGATOR_744723] -I/P. If 
participants do not meet criteria for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561], they will be rescheduled for an additional urine toxicology test the following week. If participants test positive for opi[INVESTIGATOR_744724], they will be withdrawn from the study. If participants test negative for opi[INVESTIGATOR_744725], they will receive the injection.  
 All participants who receive an injection will attend the Week 1  safety check-in to assess and address potential 
University of Washington - Collins  
Harm Reduction with Pharmacotherapy (HaRP)  15 
 
adverse events using the SAFTEE and to allow study physicians/nurses to check for potential injection site irritation.  
They will also be given research staff contact [CONTACT_744773]/concerns regarding the study medication/procedures at any time throughout the study. For the three active treatment groups, Week 1 appointments will also include a check- in regarding participants’ progress towards 
their harm reduction goals and safer drinking plans.  
 3.6 Treatment Adherence and C ompliance 
 
Treatment adherence and study compliance will be measured by [CONTACT_6492] -up appointment attendance. If participants 
do not attend appointments, their absence will be noted, and research staff will work together with program staff to reschedule with participants. If this is not feasible after five failed scheduling attempts (no -shows), the participant 
will be counted as “noncompliant.” The exception to this will be for the safety check -in at Week  1. We will work to 
contact [CONTACT_744774]. Participants will not be withdrawn from participation or analyses 
unless they expressly request to be.  
 
3.7 Study Medication  
 
3.7.1 Formulation and labeling  
 
XR-NTX  (380 mg/vial) (n=225) , which is FDA-approved and commercially available,  and placebo  (n=225) 
formulations will be provided to the investigator  per agreement from Alkermes.  The preparation will 
consist of microspheres of 100-μm diameter that either contain naltrexone or do not (placebo) and are suspended prior to administration in a PLG polymeric matrix. PLG is a common biodegradable medical polymer with an extensive history of human use in extended -release pharmaceuticals. Following the 
injection, naltrexone is released from the microspheres, yielding peak concentrations within three days. Thereafter, by a combination of diffusion and erosion, naltrexone is released for more than thirty days. 
Also provided by [CONTACT_43421], the placebo preparation will consist of an identical formulation of microspheres (not containing naltrexone) within a PLG polymeric matrix to ensure study staff and participants are blind to medication condition.  The UW IDS will receive the study medication from Alkermes and will blind and label the doses in the 
two intervention arms involving pla cebo and active medication.  
 
3.7.2 Preparing and dispensing  
 XR-NTX/placebo  will be dispensed by [CONTACT_744775] . IDS will randomize participants according to the 
prepared scheme,  and will inform the research staff of participants’ randomization to receive a) 
medication (blinded active or placebo), b) HRC or c) TAU.  Research staff will pi[INVESTIGATOR_744726] 0 appointment, as applicable.  
 Prior to administration, XR -NTX  and placebo will be prepared by  [CONTACT_5989]/nurse. Both 
formulations  must be refrigerated prior to use, but allowed to reach room temperature before injection 
(removing from refrigeration approximately 45 minutes prior to use). It must be suspended in the 
accompanying diluent in the carton by [CONTACT_744776] (approximately one minute). At this point, XR -NTX (or the placebo formulation)  is ready for administration.  
 
3.7.3 Drug storage and accountability  
 
University of Washington - Collins  
Harm Reduction with Pharmacotherapy (HaRP)  16 
 
XR-NTX/placebo  doses will be blinded and stored in locked and secure refrigerators  (2-8ºC or 36-46º F)  
at the IDS prior to use. Doses can be stored at room temperature (not exceeding 25ºC or 77º F) for no 
more than 7 days prior to administration. Doses may not be frozen.  
 
Accurate recor ding of all study medication ad ministration  will be recorded at each transaction and each 
partici pant’s sessions. The IDS  will maintain records on Vivitrol dispensation, and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_744727] n. All 
remaining, unused  XR-NTX/placebo doses will be returned to the IDS pharmacy . 
 
3.7.4 Concomitant Medications  
  
Naltrexone antagonizes the effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2495] d-containing medicines, including some cough and cold 
remedies, some antidiarrheal preparations and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467]. For this reason, use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_858] 
(prescription medication  or street  drugs) is an exclusion criterion for participation  at baseline . If 
participants have positive opi[INVESTIGATOR_744728]  (after retesting)  and/or fulfill opi[INVESTIGATOR_744729] -IV-TR, XR-NTX/placebo  administration will not proceed at week [ADDRESS_1018809] s of 
potent opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (e.g., establishment and maintenance of a patent airway and assisted ventilation). In this 
study, patients in need of analgesia will be referred for consultation to the UW Anesthesiology & Pain Medicine D epartment at Harborview Medical Center . At study enrollment, all participants  in the 
medication conditions  will be given  ID tags  and wallet-size medical emergency information cards  
indicating the possible presence of  the study medication . Participants will be encouraged to wear the ID 
tags and carry th e cards with them for the duration of the study.  
 
3.7.[ADDRESS_1018810] balance the protection of participants in medical emergencies with the need to maintain the integrity of the double blind for study va lidity. Until the 
study is completed, this will only be done in the event of a medical emergency where the information is 
necessary for the provision  of care. In the absence of specific information to the contrary, it is often 
sufficient to assume that participants might be receiving XR-NTX, with a 50% probability among those 
who are receiving an injection. However, if local treatment providers believe that an emergency medical 
situation exists and that exact information about the participants’ medication d ose is required to 
provide emergency care, then the dose codes can be obtained. All participants will be provided with 
emergency information card s and ID tags and will be informed about investigator and emergency 
contact [CONTACT_3031]. They will also  be info rmed that identification of their blinde d medication condition 
will not be available (except in emergency situations when the health-care provider deems it necessary) until after all participants at all sites have completed the study, including follow up v isits. 
 The UW IDS will have the individual dose codes for each randomized participant so the dose conditions for that participant may be identified without compromising the dose codes for other participants. This 
information will be accessible [ADDRESS_1018811] the study PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or Medical Director for authorization to break the blind in the event of an emergency.  
 Once blind dose codes are revealed to emergency medical personnel, efforts should be made to contain the information from reaching the research  staff, to  the extent that such containment is possible. 
Prudent clinical follow -up should occur to maximize participant protections, as should sufficient 
investigation about the causes and consequences of the emergency event for documentation and 
University of Washington - Collins  
Harm Reduction with Pharmacotherapy (HaRP)  17 
 
adverse event reporting. Participants will continue to receive the medication and harm reduction 
counseling for the duration of their appointments, and data will continue to be collected; however, these participants will not  be included in primary analyses.  
 If the blind is broken, a note will be placed in the participant’s  study record . This note will indicate  the 
dose code that was revealed, a brief description of the emergency situation, and the extent to which study personnel have been informed of the dose code information. Examples of emergency descriptions may include the participant’s admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_744730]. In almost all cases, a situation that requires breaking the blind 
would also warrant completion of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) form that should be turned in to the 
UW IRB within 24 hours.  
 Note: Although there may be perceived clinical advantages to individual participants to know what medication they received, the necessity of minimizing subject-expectancy effects during the study 
procedures and follow -up period requires maintenance of the double-blind until study completion. In 
most cases, nonemergency adverse events can be managed without breaking the blind (e.g., by 
[CONTACT_744777]). If, in a nonemergency situation, a local clinician feels it is in the best interest of the participant to break the stu dy blind, this individual will need to  contact [CONTACT_3433] e study PI [INVESTIGATOR_744731] D irector to discuss the specific case.  
 
3.8 Study Procedures  
 
3.8.1 Screening /baseline assessment  
 As shown in Figure 4, a gency and research staff will notify agency clients of the opportunity to 
participate in the study, and informational flyers will be posted throughout the agencies and/or 
distributed to individuals. Soon thereafter,  research staff will be onsite at agency centers in planned 
rotations to conduct information sessions and baseline assessments with interested agency clients . 
During the information sessions, research staff will briefly explain the study and will ask indiv iduals 
about their initial interest in participation. If interested, research staff will obtain verbal consent to 
administer the AUDIT-C to screen for alcohol dependence. If participants meet the initial screening cut -
off (≥4), the research staff will expl ain the study procedures, participants’ rights and informed consent 
materials. Next, the UBACC will be administered to assess capacity to provide informed consent. Potential participants will receive $[ADDRESS_1018812] to complete the baseline assessment 
or schedule it for a later date. Based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_39401], we  anticipate needing to screen 48 0 
individuals at baseline to achieve the proposed sample size ( N = 300).  
 
One primary purpose of the baseline interview  with the research staff  is to determine whether 
participan ts meet initial criteria for the study  (see sections 4.1 for inclusion criteria and 4.2 for exclusion 
criteria). The baseline interview will be administered by [CONTACT_744778] a 
bachelor -level degree in the health or social sciences . Baseline assessment sessions will take 
approximately 30 -45 minutes and will be audio recorded (if participant agrees). Audio recordings will 
facilitate weekly supervision conducted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_454202]. The measures (see section 3.3 ) 
will be administered verbally in-person with participants. Responses will be recorded by [CONTACT_744779] -and -pencil forms. 
Next, the study  physician/nurse will assess the study participant in an interview that will take 
approximately 50 minutes . During this appointment, study physicians/nurses  will a) open the session 
with an  introduction; b) assess vital signs; c) cond uct a medication reconciliation; d) take a medical 
University of Washington - Collins  
Harm Reduction with Pharmacotherapy (HaRP)  18 
 
history; e) administer the SAFTEE; f) conduct a physical exam (i.e., assessment of general appearance; 
head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat exam; heart, lung, and abdominal exam; musculoskeletal and 
dermatologic exam, and neurological assessment) ; and g)  collect blood (1 EDTA and 1 red or gold top 
tube for ca. 15 ml for each blood draw during the study) a nd urin e samples for initial lab tests, labeling 
them with study IDs. P articipants  will then be scheduled for a follow -up appointment the following week 
(i.e., Week 0) and will be paid $[ADDRESS_1018813] access to participants’ identifying information . It will take approximately three days  for the results 
of the lab tests to be processed and returned to the study staff.  
During the interim week, investigators (including the PI [INVESTIGATOR_744732]) will review participants’ Case Report Forms, including results from the baseline interview, p hysical exam and lab test results, to 
consider the safety and appropriateness of proceeding with the study procedures/treatments  (i.e., 
based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria listed in sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2). Participant information for qualifying participants will be provided to the UW IDS who will randomize part icipants according to the 
scheme  described in section 3.4.  
3.8.2 Follow-up 
 
At the Week 0 appointment, the study physician/nurse will discuss findings from the baseline interview, physi cal exam and  lab tests with participants and will discuss the participants’ participation course. 
Participants who do not qualify for study participation will be provided with feedback regarding their lab tests, exam and assessment ; will be told why they do not qualif y for participation ; and will be provided 
with brief counseling regarding safer drinking steps. They will be thanked for their time, referred back to 
their agency staff/primary care provider and will be paid $20 for the session.  
 
Participants  randomized to the  TAU will receive  feedback regarding blood/urine tests that is deemed 
clinically relevant, will be referred to their primary care provider (as necessary), paid $20 and  scheduled 
for their next appointment time (i.e.,  Week 4 follow -up). Participants in the XR -NTX, placebo or HRC 
conditions  will receive their specified Week 0 treatment  content  as described in section 3.5 . They will 
then  be scheduled for the Week 1 safety check -in and paid $20 . At the Week 1 safety check -in, the study 
physici an/nurse  will perform a physical exam  if clinically indicated and will complete the case report 
form , which will primarily comprise the SAFTEE , goals and safer drinking steps sections . This meeting will 
further ensure participants’ safety  (for those in the medication conditions)  and enhance participant 
engagement and follow -through. All active treatment groups (XR -NTX, placebo, HRC) will receive the 
same  treatment components they receiv ed during week 0 (see section 3.5 ) at weeks 4, [ADDRESS_1018814] them in their possession, research 
staff  will supply new ones to the participants.  
 All participants will attend assessment sessions identical to the baseline appointment at weeks 4 , 8, 12, 
24 and 36 (see Figure 3  and 4). Participants will be paid $20 for each appointment they attend.  At the 
final 36 -week appointment, an additional measure will be added to the assessment battery —the 
Participant Satisfaction Assessment —to assess participants’ receipt of and satisfaction with study 
procedures.  At the end of the final session, participants will receive a study completion certificate . 
 To ensure participant retention, we will use procedures honed in previous studies with these agencies. At each session, particip ants will be asked to update their contact [CONTACT_744780], place and contact [CONTACT_744781]. Prior to all 
University of Washington - Collins  
Harm Reduction with Pharmacotherapy (HaRP)  19 
 
appointments, reminder calls will be made to participants, or with their written  permission, to agency 
staff at their respective sites and/or contacts of their choosing.  
 
Further, if participants are unable to attend their sessions at the original study  location or if there is 
concern that they may be lost to follow -up if required to come to the original location, the study 
treatments and other procedures may conducted at an alternate location (e.g., housing project, shelter, treatment center, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], etc.) as long as the implementation of study procedures in the alternate location i s deemed safe and feasible by [CONTACT_464].  
 
If participants fail to appear at their follow -up appointments, we will make up to five attempts to 
contact [CONTACT_744782] -up. We will also reschedule participants for missed 
appointments up to [ADDRESS_1018815] is made.  
 Given their extensive familiarity with their clients and their clients’ routines, we will primarily rely on agency staff  to help us locate participant s. In the unlikely event they are unaware of their clients’ 
whereabouts, we will be prepared to additionally search jail databases for King County, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_434038], 
Snohomish County, Washington State Prison System, and the Federal Prison System;  Harborview 
Medical Center; online resources (e.g., zabasearch.com, google, white pages); and death records usin g 
the Social Security Death Index or via  http://www.digitalarchives.wa.gov/
 for WA -specific records.

 5.1 Screening/baseline assessments  
 Participants will undergo extensive baseline screening procedures  before they are deemed eligible for study 
participation. After providing  written informed consent, participants ’ substance use will be assessed by [CONTACT_92519]. Participant s will also meet  with the study physician/nurse and will undergo assessment of vital signs, 
weight, medical history, medication reconciliation, and physical exam. Clinical laboratory tests (blood chemistry, 
hemat ology, l iver function, and urinalysis) will also be performed during the screening/baseline appointment. 
Clinical laboratory testing will be performed during the screening/baseline appointment to determine if participants 
University of Washington - Collins

are healthy enough to  receive the study medication. The laboratory testing will include a complete blood count, a 
basic metabolic panel, a liver panel, and a urinalysis.  Urine drug screens  and the SCID I/P will be used  to rule out 
current  opi[INVESTIGATOR_744733].  Women who are in their childbearing years  will be required to agree 
to use effective methods of birth control for the duration of the study. Women will undergo a serum hCG 
(pregnancy) test during the screening/baseline assessment.  Neither pregnant nor lactating women will be included 
in the study.  Additionally, both assessment staff and study interventionists will assess for suicidal ideation, intent, 
and attempts to exclude people who have made an attempt in the past year and set a baseline level of suicidal ideation for e ach participant and thereby [CONTACT_744784]. Additionally, there is a standard suicide 
intervention protocol in place to be used as necessary.

effects and adverse events (as measured by [CONTACT_723235]) at each follow-up visit. All serious a dverse events  and 
potential serious adverse events will be reported to the Medical D irector and  PI [INVESTIGATOR_744734] r eportable under 45 CFR part 46 (see section 6.4  below for more information about reportable events ). The 
study medicat ion/placebo will be discontinued i n the case of serious adverse events  that are determined to be likely 
due to the study medication,  and participants will be referred to their PCP and/or clinical  case managers at the 
corresponding programs for appropriate follow-up care. 
 Women will undergo hCG tests  at the baseline, and those who are in the XR- NTX/placebo groups will be tested 
throughout the administration period (Week s 0, 4, 8 ). Women who become pregnant during the study will be 
withdrawn from XR- NTX/placebo and will be referred to their PCP and/or clinical case manager on the program staff 
for appropriate care.  
 Known potential side effects of XR- NTX include pain, tenderness, s welling, bruising and/or itching at the injection 
site; nausea; headache; fatigue; dizziness; vomiting; decreased appetite; painful joints and muscle cramps.  Potential 
symptoms  will be monitored closely during sessions with the study physician/nurse to avoid adverse consequences 
of participation in this study. Research staff will assess for and will help participants manage side effects during the 
course of the study and each of these will be explained during the informed consent process orally and in wr iting.  
 Naltrexone/ XR-NTX  do not have addictive properties, and with the exception of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], they evince few interactions

slightly elevated risk for eosinophilic pneumonia, depression and suicidality. For these reasons, research staff will 
conduct regular physical exams  as clinically indicated and assessment of depression/suicide using the SAFTEE , BSS 
and SITBI. Additionally, there is a standard suicide intervention protocol in place in case a person has acute suicidal 
ideation and intent. As with a ny medication, there is a risk of drug hypersensitivity, although allergic reactions to XR-
NTX are very rare. All participants will be told to call 911 in the case of an allergic reaction. In some cases, reactions 
at the injection site may become severe. Injection sites should be monitored by a health -care provider for potential 
hardening, inflammation, nodules and swelling, and in extreme cases, necrosis. The research staff will make 
concerted efforts to avoid injection site reactions by [CONTACT_744785].  
 
Finally, until recently, there was a ‘‘black -box’’ warning regarding potential hepatocellular injury. This warning was 
removed from XR -NTX in July 2013 given a lack of evidence of  hepatotoxicity at the approved dosage. The warning

Harm Reduction with Pharmacotherapy (HaRP)  23 
 
had followed from early naltrexone studies, which prescribed daily oral doses of up to 350mg for treatment of 
obesity and dementia —seven times the currently recommended oral dose.24 Although current FDA labeling 
indicates that XR -NTX may be asso ciated with liver injury primarily if it is administered in “excessive doses” or to 
patients with “acute hepatitis or liver failure,”22 there are no reports of hepatotoxicity involving XR -NTX.25 The large-
scale, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of XR -NTX mentioned above indicated no significant differences in 
participants’ liver function throughout the study, even among participants with pr eviously elevated liver enzymes.23 
Gamma -glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels were lower among those receiving XR- NTX compared to placebo during 
the study, likely due to decreased drinking.[ADDRESS_1018820], it 
has been suggested that there is greater risk of hepatotoxicity from continued, heavy alcohol use than from 
appr opriate naltrexone administration.27 Research staff will, however, be monitoring liver function throughout the 
study and will discontinue the study medication if liver enzymes exceed acceptable limits (AST/ALT > [ADDRESS_1018821]) .

6 Adverse Event Reporting  
 
6.1 Adverse event definitions  
 
• Adverse event: Any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study, regardless of the causal relationship of the 
event with the study treatment.  
• Associated with the study treatment : Reasonable possibility that the adverse event may have been caused by 
[CONTACT_104841].  
• Disability : A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal  life functions.  
• Life-threatening adverse event : Any adverse event that places participants, in the view of the investigators, at 
immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred (i.e., does not include an adverse event that, had it 
actually occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death).  
• Serious adverse event: Any adverse event that results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -threatening 
adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or threat to participants’ health that may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent the previous outcomes  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: Any initial admission to a healthcare facility as a result of a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_10244], 
including transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_427807]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4595] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], clinical adverse event (e.g., for a preexisting  condition not associated with a 
new adverse event or with a worsening of the preexisting condition; admission for a protocol -specified 
procedure) is not, in itself, a serious adverse event.  
• Unanticipated problem: OHRP designation for an adverse event that  a) is unexpected in nature, severity or 
frequency; b) is related or possibly related to participation in the research; and c) may place participants or others at a greater risk of physical or psychological harm. Under [ADDRESS_1018822] be reported to the IRB for report to the OHRP within 1 week.  
 
6.2 Eliciting adverse event information  
 
University of Washington - Collins  
Harm Reduction with Pharmacotherapy (HaRP)  [ADDRESS_1018823] findings believed to be associated with 
the study treatment will be followed until the event (or its sequelae) or the abnormal test finding resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_744732].  
 In the case of a suspected unanticipated  problem or serious adverse event, research staff will promptly call the PI [INVESTIGATOR_744736], and will follow a detailed protocol which ra nges from encouraging or assisting the participant to 
speak with his or her onsite case manager (assigned to all clients of DESC and REACH) to calling [ADDRESS_1018824] all observed or volunteered serious adverse events using the  designated form  in the CRF, which will 
be turned in to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_744737].  
 If upon review , it is unclear whether an adverse event meets criteria for an unanticipated  problem or serious 
adverse event, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_744738]/or 
abnormal test findings to determine 1) if they should be cl assified as adverse events; 2) if there is a reasonable 
possibility that the adverse events were caused by [CONTACT_104841]; and 3) if the adverse events meet criteria 
for a serious adverse event  or unanticipated problem. If causality is determined to be of “unknown and of 
questionable relationship” to the study treatment, the adverse event will be classified as associated with the study 
treatment for reporting purposes. If the determination of causality is “unknown but not related to the study treatment,” this determination and its rationale will be documented in the study log. If serious adverse events /unanticipated problems  are deemed to be due to the study medication, it will be discontinued and 
appropriate follow -up care will be coordinated.  
 Researc h staff will also obtain HIPAA authorizations/releases of information for agency and local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_744739] (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], death, disability). Safety data will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_519843] a biannual  basis and wi ll be monitored by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_7706] -Is as well as the Data Safety Monitoring Board. On a 
biannual  basis during the study, the DSMB chair will generate a recommendation for continuing or terminating the 
trial. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_744740] (Collins), the Medical Director (Ries) and the UW IRB. The report and recommendations will be discussed with research and agency staff in  research meetings during the course of 
the RCT.  
 
6.3 Recording requirements  
  
All observed or volunteered adverse events (serious or non -serious) and abnormal test findings , regardless o f 
treatment group or suspected causal relationship to the study treatments will be recorded in the participant s’ CRF  in 
the appropriate space or using the adverse event form. For all adverse events, sufficient information will be pursued 
and/or obtained so as to permit 1) an adequate determination of the outcome of the event (i.e., whether the event 
should be classified as a serious adverse event) and ; 2) an assessment of the casual relationship between the adverse 
event and the study treatment. Adverse even ts or abnormal test findings believed to be associated with the study 
treatment will be followed until the event (or its sequelae) or the abnormal test finding resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_744732] . 
 
6.3.[ADDRESS_1018825] or other study occurrence  will be classified as an adverse event if 
one or more of the following criteria are met:  
 
• It is accompanied by [CONTACT_744787].  
University of Washington - Collins  
Harm Reduction with Pharmacotherapy (HaRP)  25 
 
• It necessitates additional diagnostic evaluation(s) or medical/surgical intervention; including 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other therapy  
(Note: simply repeating a test finding, in the absence of any of the other listed criteria, does not 
constitute an adverse event. ) 
• It leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation of participant participation in the  study  
• It is considered an adverse event by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_744732] 
6.3.2 Causality and severity assessment 
 
The inves tigator s (including the PI [INVESTIGATOR_744732]) will promptly review documented adverse 
events and abnormal test findings to determine 1) if the abnormal test finding should be classified as an 
adverse event; 2) if there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event was caused by [CONTACT_169185]/procedures ; and 3) if the adverse event  meets the criteria for a serious adverse event .

• The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of 
the study drug is not reasonable OR  
• There is another obvious cause of the AE  
6.4 Reporting of adverse events    
 
Any observed or volunteered adverse event that is determined to be  a serious adverse event or an unanticipated 
problem will be reported by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_744741] 24 hours of receipt of this inf ormation. This will 
be done even if a serious adverse event is determined to be “probably not related” or “definitely not related” to the study medication/study procedurs, although it is understood that it typi[INVESTIGATOR_744742] i t 
is found to be a serious adverse event that is possibly due to the study medication/study procedures . Follow-up 
information to the reported serious adverse event or unanticipated problem will be submitted to the IRB and 
Alkermes as soon as the relevant information is available —particularly regarding the association of the study 
medication or procedures with the serious adverse event. It is conceivable that further investigation could show that a serious adverse event or unanticipated problem that was init ially determined to not require reporting does, in fact, 
meet the requirements for reporting. Such events will be reported to the IRB as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours after the determination was made. Unanticipated problems will  be reported to OHRP as specified under 
federal law (45 CFR part 46).  
 
6.5 Withdrawal of P articipant s Due to Adverse E vents  
 Participants will be withdrawn from the XR- NTX/placebo  treatment course  if they experience an adverse event  
determined qualify as a seri ous adverse event or unanticipated problem and probably  due to the medication. Other 
reasons for withdrawal from the medication treatment course  include participants’ decision to discontinue study 
medication ; pregnancy; elevate d liver enzymes (AST/ALT > 5x normal after repeat test); renal insufficiency (serum 
creatinine level > 2 ; and/or physical illness /injury  that precludes following the prescribed XR- NTX/placebo  course. In 
this case, the reason for discontinuation of medication  will be noted on the  participants’  CRF and will be  noted in 
safety reports. The study medication will be discontinued,  and participants will be encouraged to discuss their 
medical condition/lab test findings with their  assigned clinical case manager  on the program staff and primary care 
physician  for follow-up care. In the case participants do not have a primary care provider , they will be referred to  
local  primary care clinics. In the case of an observed or self -reported adverse event  of questionable severity, 
research staff will immediately contact [CONTACT_744789]. If it is determined to fit the definition of a serious adverse event or unanticipated problem, this will be  report ed to the IRB  as discussed in previous section s. In 
case of life-threatening event , research staff will immediately info rm the medical director, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_744743]’ clinical case manager at the program agency , who will take immediate, clinically appropriate action . 
Unless participants explicitly request  to withdraw their participation altogether  or the adverse even t prevents 
participation , they  will continue with follow -up assessment subsequent to treatment discontinuation . 
 
7 Statistical Methods/Data Analysis:  
 
7.1 Study endpoints  
 
Primary and secondary endpoints for the current study will include alcohol (i.e., peak alcohol quantity, drinking 
frequency, alcohol -related problems, EtG/creatinine ratio, liver tests ) and quality -of-life outcomes ; 
process/mediational variables (i.e., motivation to engage in harm reducti on, craving); and publicly funded service 
utilization and associated costs (i.e., Medic One/EMS dispatches; ER visits; inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614]; bookings, length of stay and daily cost for the King County Correctional Facility).  
 
7.2 Sample size determination 
 
University of Washington - Collins  
Harm Reduction with Pharmacotherapy (HaRP)  27 
 
Using Mplus 6.11,106 we conducted Monte Carlo studies to estimate power for the primary outcome analyses to be 
conducted in Specific Aims 1 and 3. Data were generated from a population with hypothesized parameter values, 
10,000 samples were drawn at random, and model parameters were estimated for each sample. A significance level of α = .05 was assumed for the hypothesized treatme nt effects for each of the outcome variables. Residual variance 
was set at .09, which is a representative value for this model type
107 and corresponds to calculations based on data 
from our prior studies in a similar population.49,56 For Hypothesis 1a, assuming a follow -up attrition rate of 20%,49 a 
Monte Carlo study indicated power (β -1) of .[ADDRESS_1018826] (γ=.15) for HRC and placebo and 
β-1=.[ADDRESS_1018827] for XR -NTX (γ=.2; corresponding to Cohen’s d=.63; following suggestions by 
[CONTACT_744790]én and colleagues107) compared to TAU  for our proposed sample size ( N=300) . For Hypothesis 1b, power was 
adequate (β- 1=.83) to detect a medium effect (γ=.2) for XR-NTX compared to placebo ( N=150). These estimated 
effect sizes were deemed appropriate given findings from prior studies with this population49,56 and with the study 
medication.5,68 
 For specific aim 3, assuming no missing utilization data, a Monte Carlo study indicated adequate power (β -1=.81) to 
detect a medium effect (γ=.2) for XR- NTX compared to TAU.
[ADDRESS_1018828] 
the hypothesized small -to-medium (γ=.15) effects for placebo and HRC (β -1=.57). The fact that the weaker 
treatment effects are underpowered is not unexpected for cost analyses in smaller clinical trials.108 Although the 
proposed population comprises relatively high utilizers of EMS, ER, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_744744], the frequency of emergency and criminal justice system utilizati on is still statistically rare.  
  
7.3 Proposed analyses  
 Outcome analyses will comprise a series of latent growth curve models utilizing appropriate probability distributions for the outcome variables (e.g., Poisson, negative binomial, Gaussian, logistic). Growth modeling examines 
individuals’ outcome trajectories and covariate effects on these trajectories over time.
[ADDRESS_1018829] to the multilevel approach proposed by [CONTACT_721451].110  
 
Outcomes measured at each time point will serve as indicators of the intercept (i.e ., baseline) and slope (i.e., change 
in outcomes over time). Treatment group will serve as the primary predictor of slope. Covariates (e.g., housing 
status, agency) will serve as additional predictors of intercept or slope, as necessary. Outcome variables are based 
on established standards in the alcohol -use literature111- [ADDRESS_1018830] treatment effects on 3, 30 -day alcohol outcomes: peak 
alcohol quantity, drinking frequency and alcohol -related problems. In secondary analyses, we will additionally test 
the treatment effects on the EtG/creatinine ratio and liver values to biovalidate the primary, self -report outcomes. 
Although the proposed alcohol outcomes differ from those typi[INVESTIGATOR_744745], they were 
deemed appropriate for the proposed study aims and population. First, most naltrexone studies h ave used an 
abstinence -based treatment model and have thereby [CONTACT_744791], abstinence -oriented outcomes 
(e.g., days to relapse, percent days abstinent). Because we have proposed a harm -reduction treatment model, we, 
too, deemed it important to focus on complementary outcomes: reduced alcohol -use and -related harm. Second, 
the baseline assessment during our pi[INVESTIGATOR_744746] a [ADDRESS_1018831] the various pathways by [CONTACT_744792] -related harm.  
 
University of Washington - Collins  
Harm Reduction with Pharmacotherapy (HaRP)  [ADDRESS_1018832] growth models comparing the relative effects of the three active treatment 
groups with the TAU group o n alcohol outcomes (see Figure 5 ). It is hypothesized that the three active treatment 
groups will evince significantly greater decreases across alcohol outcomes than TAU. To test Hypothesis 1B, we will conduct a seco nd set of growth models directly comparing the XR- NTX and placebo effects on alcohol outcomes. It is 
hypothesized that the XR- NTX group will evince significantly greater decreases than the placebo group on alcohol 
outcomes over the follow -up period.  
 
For Specific Aim 2, we will be testing 
longitudinal changes on secondary, theoretical 
variables as mediators of the treatment effects 
on alcohol outcomes. To test Hypothesis 2a, growth analyses will be conducted to determine whether the 3, active treatment groups are associated with significant increases 
in motivation to change drinking in a way that 
reduces harm as represented by [CONTACT_744793], motivation, importance and confidence rulers. If this is the case, the alcohol growth model established in analyses for 
Spec ific Aim [ADDRESS_1018833] of 
coefficients (αβ), where α=the regression of the 
slope of the mediator on the dummy -coded 
intervention variables and β=the regressio n of 
the slope of the alcohol outcome variable on 
the slope of the mediator, using the asymmetric confidence interval (CI) approach.[ADDRESS_1018834] of interventions for this population on publicly funded service 
costs. Specific Aim 3  will therefore assess relative effects of the 3 active treatments (i.e., XR -NTX, placebo and HRC) 
compared to TAU on costs stemming from: a) the number of emergency medical service dispatches; b) number of ER 
visits; c) number of inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614]; d) number of bookings and length of stay at the King County 
Correctional Facility. As in Specific Aim 1, this analysis will feature a growth model  in which the mean monthly costs 
during 3 timepoints  (i.e., 2 years prior to baseline, during the 12 weeks of treatment, and during the 24 -week follow -
up) will serve as indicators of the latent variables. We will use the mean monthly costs to account for the differing lengths of the time points. The [ADDRESS_1018835]

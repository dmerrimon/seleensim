V onoprazan (10 or 20 mg Once Daily) in Children Aged ≥ 6 to < [ADDRESS_1070243] Symptomatic Gastr oesophageal Reflux Disease  
Sponsor:  Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
[ADDRESS_1070244] Buffalo Grove, IL [ZIP_CODE] [LOCATION_003] 
EU Trial Number:  2022-003228-42 
Study Phase:  1 
Study Sites:  Approximately 20 to 25 sites in the [LOCATION_002] and Europe  
Indication:  Symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) 
Rationale: GERD is prevalent globally and represents one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases. Per the Montreal definition, GERD is a condition that develops when the reflux of stomach contents causes 
troublesome symptoms and/or complications. The term GERD covers a 
spectrum of conditions, including symptomatic non- erosive GERD 
(sGERD), erosive esophagitis (EE), and Barrett's esophagus. The prevalence of GERD increases with age, from 2.5% of children 
between 3 and 9 years of age to 8.5% of those between 10 and 17 years 
of age. Similarly, the overall prevalence of EE increases with age, from 
5.5% in infants to 12.4% in children and adolescents. Younger children 
usually pr esent with extraesophageal manifestations, regurgitation, and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_50684], while older children and adolescents typi[INVESTIGATOR_778756]-type GERD symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation. Pediatric GERD is a condition that is not always outgrown and can manifest itself as a chronic disease.  
V onoprazan belongs to a new class of acid-inhibitory agents called “potassium- competitive acid blockers. ” In the [LOCATION_002], 
vonoprazan in combination with amoxicillin and in combination with amoxicillin and clarithromycin is approved for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori  
infection in adults. V onoprazan is being developed 
in adults for the treatment of heartburn in patients with symptomatic non-erosive GERD, healing of all grades of EE and relief of heartbu rn 
and maintenance of healing of all grades of EE and relief of heartburn. 
The pediatric doses for this study were selected to approximate equivalent adult exposures following administration of vonoprazan 10 or 20 mg QD to children ≥ 6 to < 12 years of age .

Page 11 Objectives:  Primary:  
• To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of vonoprazan (10 or 
20 mg once daily [QD]) in children ≥ 6 to < [ADDRESS_1070246]. 
Safety:  
• To evaluate the safety of vonoprazan (10 or 20 mg QD) in 
children ≥ 6 to < [ADDRESS_1070247].  
Exploratory: 
• To evaluate symptom relief and pharmacodynamics of vonoprazan (10 or 20 mg QD) in children ≥ 6 to < [ADDRESS_1070248]. 
Study Population:  Children ≥ 6 to < [ADDRESS_1070249], with 
or without EE. 
Study Design and Interventions:  This is a Phase 1, uncontrolled, randomized, open- label, parallel -group, 
multiple -dose study in children ≥ 6 to < [ADDRESS_1070250] sites will perform gastric pH monitoring in subjects deemed clinically indicated by [CONTACT_458].  
Subjects undergoing gastric pH monitoring will be confined to the 
clinic for testing. Gastric pH will be monitored for 2 4 hours beginning 
on Day -1 and on Day 7. 
The study will include 3 periods: 
Screening Period (≤ 4 weeks):  Subjects will undergo screening 
assessments to determine study eligibility, and baseline assessments 
will be performed. If all eligibility criteria are met, the subject will be randomized and enter the Treatment Period.  
Treatment Period (Day 1 to Day 14):  Subjects will be randomized to 
receive vonoprazan 10 mg or vonoprazan 20 mg QD. 
Follow -up Period:  A safety follow-up phone call will occur [ADDRESS_1070251] dose of study drug to assess adverse events (AEs). 
A subject will be considered to have completed the study if the subject 
completes the Treatment Period and the safety follow -up phone call. 
Following the last dose of study drug or early discontinuation, the 
subject will be transitioned to local standard of care in accordance with 
each site’s prespecified process.

Page 12 Estimated Study 
Duration: The total duration of the study is up to [ADDRESS_1070253] study drug administration. 
Pharmacokinetic  
Assessments (Primary Endpoints):  The primary vonoprazan pharmacokinetic endpoints will include the following steady state paramete rs from data collected on Day 7 and 
Day 14: 
• Maximum observed drug concentration at steady state (C
max,ss) 
• Area under the plasma concentration -time curve during the 
dosing interval τ ( AUC τ) 
• Apparent oral clearance (CL/F)  
• Apparent volume of distribution (V z/F) 
Efficacy and 
Pharmacodynamic Assessments (Exploratory Endpoints):  Efficacy and pharmacodynamic characteristics will be assessed by [CONTACT_14504]: 
• The severity of GERD symptoms at screening and Days 7 and 14 as assessed by [CONTACT_093] 
• Mean pH and percentage of time above pH 4, 5, and 6 at Day -1 and Day 7 in the subset of subjects for whom intragastric pH monitoring is performed when clinically indicated per the investigator 
Safety Assessments 
(Safety Endpoints):  Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_716]: 
• AEs 
• Laboratory test values (hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis) 
• Electrocardiograms  
• Vital signs  
Study Drug, Dosage, and Route of Administr ation: Open -label study drug (vonoprazan 10 mg or vonoprazan 20 mg) to be 
taken orally QD for 14 days (Day 1 through Day 14). All study drug doses are to be taken preferably prior to eating any breakfast or food with approximately 240 mL (8 oz) water between 7 and 10 am each day.  
Ethical Considerations:  Clinical studies in adults with GERD have shown a positive benefit-risk for vonoprazan. This study is anticipated to provide benefits to children ≥ 6 to < [ADDRESS_1070254] and risks similar to those observed with vonoprazan in adults. This study is needed to identify doses to be used in future trials in children ≥ 6 to < 12 years of age. 
The study was designed to minimize the number of blood samples and 
visits to investigate the pharmacokinetics and safety in this population.  
  
Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc. vonoprazan  
Protocol: VPED -[ADDRESS_1070255]  2023  
Page 13 Sample  Size:  Approximately 18 subjects will be enrolled with 9 subjects in each dose 
group. Attempts will be made to enroll subjects across the ≥ 6 to < 12 
years age range. Because this is a pharmacokinetic and safety trial with no 
comparator, there is no power determination affecting the sample size. The sample size of approximately 18 subjects is considered sufficient to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of vonoprazan in this population. Fewer subjects may be enrolled based on preliminary da ta, if 
considered sufficient to adequately characterize the pharmacokinetic profile.

Page 16 1 Introduction  
V onoprazan belongs to a new class of acid-inhibitory agents called potassium- competitive 
acid blockers (PCABs). In the [LOCATION_002], vonoprazan in combination with amoxicillin 
and in combination with amoxicillin and clarithromycin have been approved for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori  infection in adults. V onoprazan is being developed for the 
treatment of heartburn in patients with symptomatic non-erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease (sGERD), healing of all grades of erosive esophagitis (EE) and relief of heartburn and maintenance of healing of all grades of EE and relief of heartburn. 
In countries other than the [LOCATION_002], vonoprazan has been studied in other gastric acid-
related diseases such as healing of gas tric and duodenal ulcers, and for the prevention of 
recurrence of gastric or duodenal ulcer during nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_778757]. V onoprazan has received regulatory approval for adults in Japan, Russia, and 
other countries in Asia and Latin America for a variety of indications, including the healing 
of erosive esophagitis and maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis. Vonoprazan is not currently approved for use in pediatric patients in any country.  
Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc. licensed the exclusive rights from [COMPANY_005] Pharmaceutical 
Company Limited ([COMPANY_005]) to develop, manufacture, and commercialize vonoprazan in the 
[LOCATION_002], Europe, and Canada. 
1.1 Study Rationale  
The purpose of this study is to determine a dose of vonoprazan in children aged ≥ 6 to< 12 
years with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) that provides an exposure 
similar to the exposures in adults after administration of vonoprazan 10 or 20 mg once daily (QD). Like proton pump inhibitors, vonoprazan is expected to provide benefit in pediatric patients with GERD.  
1.[ADDRESS_1070261] is a condition that develops 
when the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications 
Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc. vonoprazan  
Protocol: VPED -[ADDRESS_1070262]  2023  
Page 17 [Vakil  2006]. The term GERD covers a spectrum of co nditi ons, including symptomatic 
non-erosive GERD, EE, and Barrett’s esophagus. 
The prevalence of GERD increases with age, from 2.5% of children between 3 and 9 years of 
age to 8.5% of those between 10 and 17 years of age [ Nelso
n 2000]. Similarly, the overa ll 
preva
lence of EE increases with age, from 5.5% in infants to 12.4% in children and 
adolescents [ Gilger  2008 ]. Younger children usually present with extraesophageal 
manifestations, regurgitation, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_50684], while older children and adolescents typi[INVESTIGATOR_778756]-type GERD symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation [Cezard  2004,  Rosen  2018]. Pediatric GERD is a condition that is not always outgrown and 
can manifest itself as a chronic disease [ Rosen  2018].  
Management of GERD includes lifestyle changes (eg, diet, weight loss, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_587929]), over-the-counter antacids, histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H
2RAs), and proton pump 
inhibitors (PPIs). Proton pump inhibitors are considered superior to H 2RAs for the healing of 
EE and  relief of GERD symptoms and have become the pharmacological mainstay for the 
treatment of adult and pediatric GERD [ Gold  2002, Rosen 2018].  
1.2.2 Vonoprazan  
The gastric hydrogen, potassium–adenosine triphosphatase (H+, K+-ATPase), also known as the proton pump, is responsible for acid secretion from parietal cells in the stomach. It is inactive in the cytosol but relocates from the cytosol to the secretory membrane of the parietal cells when food is present in the stomach, thereby [CONTACT_11752][INVESTIGATOR_007] 
H+ ions out of the cells and into the canaliculi in exchange for K+ ions. It represents an 
attractive pharmacological target since it is the final step of the acid secretion process.  
Two classes of pharmaceuticals, with distinct mechanisms of action for inhibiting the gastric 
proton pump, have been developed for clinical application: PPIs and PCABs. As a PCAB, 
vonoprazan has a unique mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics relative to PPIs: 
• Acid activation and stability: Conventional PPIs are prodrugs, which are activated by [CONTACT_778775] H+, K+- ATPase; however, activated PPIs are not 
stable in acidic conditions. In contrast, vonoprazan does not require acid activation, is stable in acidic conditions, and has a more durable effect. Further, vonoprazan is 
Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc. vonoprazan  
Protocol: VPED -[ADDRESS_1070263]  2023  
Page 18 rapi[INVESTIGATOR_522821], which concentrates the drug 
proximal to the H+, K+- ATPase [ Scarpi[INVESTIGATOR_11735] 2019].  
• Activity against proton pumps: V onoprazan inhibits acid secretion by [CONTACT_778776] H+, K+- ATPase. V onoprazan may 
selectively concentrate in the parietal cells in both the resting and stimulated states 
and binds to the active pumps in a noncovalent and reversible manner. In contrast, 
PPIs covalently bind H+, K+- ATPase o nly when the pump is active, as an acidic 
environment is required for the activation and accumulation of PPIs in the parietal 
cell [ Scott  2015
].  
• V onoprazan maintains acid control over 24 hours with QD dosing [ Enge vik 2020
]. 
V onoprazan can also be dosed in the presence or absence of food, while most PPIs requi
re dosing before a meal to optimize their acid suppressant effect because 
activated pumps are at their highest level post -prandially due to activation of pumps 
by [CONTACT_45325] [ Shin 2013].  
• Extended half- life: The mean plasma half -life is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 7 to 8 hours after single and 
multiple QD administration of vonoprazan 20 mg (TAK- 438_107). This is 
significantly longer than the half- life of conventional PPIs (<2 hours) [ Shin 2013
]. 
• Metabolism: V onoprazan is me ta bolized by a combination of cytochrome P450 
(CYP) isoforms including CYP3A4/5, which does not have a high degree of genetic 
polymorphism as compared with CYP2C19, which is the primary enzyme responsible 
for the metabolism of PPIs [ Shin 2013].  
T
hese unique aspects of the vonoprazan mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics relative 
to PP
Is translate into greater magnitude and duration of gastric acid suppression, which are 
reflected in the pharmacodynamic profile [ Jenkins
 2015; Sakurai  2015].  
The
 pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of vonoprazan were assessed in 
multiple studies, including Study TAK-438_107, which showed rapid rise in pH following vonoprazan administration and a dose response for percent time above pH 4. The mean 
percentage of time above pH 4 on Day 1 for vonoprazan 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg were 
43%, 63%, and 86%, respectively, and by [CONTACT_2006] 7 were 60%, 85%, and 93%, respectively [Jenkins
 2015].   
Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc. vonoprazan  
Protocol: VPED -[ADDRESS_1070264]  2023  
Page 19 [COMPANY_005] conducted 8 short- term clinical studies in adults with EE (5  studies) and symptomatic 
non-erosive GERD (3 studies) with treatment durations of 2 to 8 weeks. In addition, [COMPANY_005] 
conducted 3 studies of maintenance of healing of EE with treatment durations of 24 to 52 weeks. V onoprazan is approved in multiple countries outside of the United S tates for the 
treatment of adults for reflux (erosive) esophagitis (for healing: vonoprazan [ADDRESS_1070265], 8 weeks; for maintenance: [ADDRESS_1070266], 20 mg QD). 
The safety profile of vonoprazan in Phase [ADDRESS_1070267]-marketing patient exposure to vonoprazan is estimated to be approximately 97 million patients.  
Overall, with vonoprazan’s pharmacological profile of rapid, potent, and sustained elevations of gastric pH, vonoprazan offers the potential to be a highly effective treatment option for 
children with symptomatic GERD.  
1.3 Justification for Dose  
The proposed pediatric doses are selected to approximate equivalent adult exposures following administration of vonoprazan 10 or 20 mg QD in pediatric patients ≥ 6 to < 12 
years of age.  
The proposed doses are based on simulations using an updated population pharmacokinetic (popPK
) model [ Faci
us 2023]. The 2-compartment linear popPK model for vonoprazan was 
devel
oped with adult pharmacokinetic data from healthy subjects aged 18 to 54 years who 
participated in 9  studies specifically se lected to enable the extrapolation and characterization 
of the disposition of vonoprazan in pediatric subjects. The final dataset consisted of 354 subjects (205 Asian and 149 Western) with [ADDRESS_1070268] adolescent subjects aged 12 to 17 years randomized in Study VPED-102 was performed using the updated popPK model. Interim data from VPED -102 was combined with adult data from the updated popPK model 
to investigate potential differences in the pharmacokinetic properties of vonoprazan between adolescents and adults. Individual predicted area under the drug concentration- time curve at 
steady state ( AUC
ss) values for the [ADDRESS_1070269] included 
Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc. vonoprazan  
Protocol: VPED -[ADDRESS_1070270] doses for younger pediatric subjects.   
For predicting the appropriate doses in pediatric subjects aged ≥  6 to <12 years, simulations 
were performed using the updated popPK model for vonoprazan and were summarized by [CONTACT_778777]. For reference, all boys and girls aged ≥ 6 to < [ADDRESS_1070271] a body weight between 15 and 
65 kg. Different model assumptions in terms of the allometric weight scaling exponent (as 
estimated  (none) in the adult data or fixed at 0.2) were compared. 
The updated model was used to simulate posterior distributions of AUC
ss in both adults and 
pediatric subjects aged ≥6 to <12 years or with a body weight of 15 to 65 kg for a series of 
pediatric candidate doses. Matching pediatric doses were selected to limit the predicted 
percentage of pediatric subjects with an exposure exceeding the adult reference exposure (median AUC
ss) at 50%.  
For children aged ≥ 6 to < [ADDRESS_1070272] similar exposure predictions, thereby [CONTACT_778778] (10 and 20 mg) should result in a majority of exposures that are within the 95% prediction interval in adults for both the 10 and 20 mg targeted doses.

3.1 Study Design  
This is a Phase 1, randomized, open- label, parallel -group, multiple-dose study in children 
aged ≥ 6 to < [ADDRESS_1070278] of care does not include the use of study drug but can include other acid suppressant agents.  
A schematic diagram of the overall study design is presented in Figure 3-1. 
 
Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc. vonoprazan  
Protocol: VPED -[ADDRESS_1070279]  2023  
Page 24 The study will include 3 periods ( see the schedule of events [SoE] in Section  13.1 for 
details ). 
Screening Period (≤ 4 weeks):  Subjects will undergo screening assessments to determine 
study eligibility, and baseline assessments wi ll be performed. If all eligibility criteria are met, 
the subject will be randomized and enter the Treatment Period. 
Treatment Period (Day 1 to Day 14): Subjects will be randomized to receive 1 of 
2 vonoprazan doses (10 mg QD or 20 mg QD) for 14 days. 
Follow-up Period (2 weeks): A safety follow-up visit phone call will occur [ADDRESS_1070280] dose of study drug to assess adverse events (AEs). Following completion of study drug 
dosing or early discontinuation, the subject will be transitioned to local s tandard of care for 
14 days. 
End-of-study definition:  A subject will be considered to have completed the study (up to 8 
weeks, including 4 weeks of screening, 2 weeks of treatment and 2 weeks of safety follow-
up) if the subject completes the Treatment Peri od and the safety follow-up visit phone call. 
3.1.1 Rationale of Study Design  
Blinding is not necessary in this study since the primary objective is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of vonoprazan. The pharmacokinetic endpoints are objective and 
unlikely to be biased by [CONTACT_65464]-label design.  
A parallel -group design with 2 dose levels of vonoprazan (10 and 20 mg QD) was selected to 
provide unbiased estimates of the vonoprazan pharmacokinetic and safety profile across 
doses likely to be safe and efficacious  in children aged ≥ 6 to < 12 years. Dose justification is 
provided in Section  1.3. A placebo control group is not considered practical or ethical in 
children aged ≥ 6 to < [ADDRESS_1070281]. 
Pharmacokinetic studies with PPIs (dexlansoprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, 
rabep
razole) in pediatric GERD patients were generally less than 7 days [ Gunas
ekaran  2002, 
Gremse 2002, James  2007, K ukulka 2014, Kukulka 2012, Li  2006, Rosen  2018, 
Zannikos 2011, Zhao  2006]. Historical PPI [CONTACT_33653] (esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole) 
in pediatric GERD patients have shown benefit in terms of resolution of heartburn and other GERD symptoms within a week of treatment [ Gold  2007, Gunasekaran  2002, Tolia  2006].  
Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc. vonoprazan  
Protocol: VPED -[ADDRESS_1070282] that, if effective, the 
onset of efficacy in pediatric patients would be similar or earlier than with PPIs.  
This study will include children aged ≥ 6 to < [ADDRESS_1070283] with or 
without EE. In Study EE-301, which enrolled 1027 adult subjects with endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_778758] A to D, 514 subjects were evaluated for 
EE heali ng after receiving vonoprazan 20 mg QD for 2 weeks. Of the 514 subjects, 74.3% 
had healed EE at Week 2. Based on this data, the proposed 14- day treatment duration will 
provide clinical benefit to subjects with EE, with a possibility of healing of EE.

Page 29 4.1.3 Screen Failures 
Screen failures are defined as subjects whose LAR signed the informed consent form (ICF) 
to participate in the clinical study but are not subsequently entered in the Treatment Period of the study. A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure subjects to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials 
publishing requirements and to respond to quer ies from regulatory authorities. Minimal 
information includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, pretreatment 
adverse events (PTEs), AEs, and any serious adverse events (SAEs). 
Subjects may be allowed to be rescreened upon discussion with and approval by [CONTACT_35011].  
4.2 Withdrawal of Subjects From Study Drug and/or the Study  
The duration of the study is defined for each subject as the date signed written informed consent is provided through the last follow-up visit phone call performed [ADDRESS_1070294] dose of study drug in the Treatment Period. 
4.2.1 Reasons for Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
Subjects or LARs may withdraw from the study at any time (eg, Treatment Period, Follow-up Period) and for any reason without prejudice to their future medical care by [CONTACT_778780]. Every effort should be made to keep subjects in the study. The primary reason for discontinuation or withdrawal of the subject from the study drug or the study should be recorded in the eCRF. For screen failure subjects, refer to Section 4.1.3.  
A subject may be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons: 
1. Adverse event or SAE: The subject has experienced a PTE, AE, or SAE that requires 
early termination because continued participation imposes an unacceptable risk to the 
subject’s health, or the subject is unwilling to continue because of the PTE, AE, or 
SAE. 
Note: If a subject is discontinued from study participation due to a PTE, AE, or SAE, the event will be followed until it is fully resolved or stable.  
2. Liver function test (LFT) abnormalities: Appropriate clinical follow -up (including 
repeat laboratory t ests) is to be done until a subject’s laboratory profile has returned to 
Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc. vonoprazan  
Protocol: VPED -[ADDRESS_1070295]  2023  
Page 30 normal/baseline status. See Section  13.2 to monitor LFT abnormalities and f or the 
criteria of liver function abnormalities for temporary and permanent discontinuation 
of study drug. 
3. Significant protocol deviation: The discovery post-randomization that the subject failed to meet protocol entry criteria or did not adhere to protocol requirements, and 
continued participation poses an unacceptable risk to the subject’s health. 
4. Lost to follow-up: The subject did not return to the clinic and attempts to contact [CONTACT_39838]. Attempts to contact [CONTACT_45316] ([ADDRESS_1070296] attempts and 1 certified letter, at a minimum) within 
[ADDRESS_1070297] recent planned visit. 
5. V oluntary withdrawal: The subject or the LAR wishes to withdraw from the study. The reason for the withdrawal, if provided, should be recorded in the eCRF. Note: All attempts should be made to determine the underlying reason for the 
withdrawal and, where possible, the primary underlying reason should be recorded 
(ie, withdrawal due to an AE or lack of efficacy). 
6. Study termina tion: The sponsor, Institutional Review Board ( IRB)/Independent Ethics 
Committee s (IECs ), or regulatory agency terminates the study. 
7. Pregnancy: The subject is found to be pregnant. Note: If the subject is found to be pregnant, the subject must be withdrawn immediately from the treatment. See Section  6.3.2 for further instructions on pregnancy. 
8. Lack of efficacy: The investigator has determined that the subject is not benefiting from investigational treatment and continued participation would pose an unacceptable risk to the subject. 
9. Other: The subject is discontinued from the study for any reason other than those 
listed above. The specific reason(s) for subject discontinuation will be recorded in the 
eCRF where appropriate.  
Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc. vonoprazan  
Protocol: VPED -[ADDRESS_1070298] of care in accordance with each site’s prespecified process.  
Subjects who discontinue study drug or active participation in the study will no longer receive study drug. When a subject withdraws from the study drug or active participation in 
the study, the reason(s) for withdrawal shall be recorded by [CONTACT_778781] F. Whenever possible, all subjects who discontinue study drug or withdraw 
from the study prematurely will undergo all end-of-study assessments. Subjects who fail to 
return for final assessments will be contact[CONTACT_778782]. 
It is vital to obtain follow -up data on any subject withdrawn because of an AE or SAE. In 
every case, efforts must be made to undertake protocol- specified follow -up procedures to 
assess safety.  
See the SoE in Section  13.[ADDRESS_1070299]’s study participation at any time during the study 
when the subject meets the study termination criteria described in Section 4.2.1. 
4.2.[ADDRESS_1070300] fails to 
return for scheduled visits during the Treatment Period or Follow-up Period, and the LAR is 
unable to be contact[CONTACT_9298]. 
Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc. vonoprazan  
Protocol: VPED -[ADDRESS_1070301] fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study visit: 
• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_778783], counsel the subject and LAR on the importance of maintaining the assigned 
visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the subject and LAR wish to and/or should continue in the study. 
• Before a subject is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_778784] (wh ere possible, 3 telephone calls and, if 
necessary, a certified letter [or local equivalent methods] to the subject’s last known 
mailing address within [ADDRESS_1070302] recent planned visit). These contact [CONTACT_131994]’s source document. 
• Should the LAR continue to be unreachable, the subject will be considered to have withdrawn from the study due to being lost to follow-up. 
4.2.4 Replacements  
At the discretion of the sponsor, subjects may be replaced to achieve the target of 
approximately 18 subjects with expected usable pharmacokinetic sample collections.

5.1 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the following 2 groups during the Treatment Period: 
• V onoprazan 10 mg QD for 14 days 
• V onoprazan 20 mg QD for 14 days 
An interactive response technology (IRT) system will be used to administer the randomization schedule. Biostatistics will generate the  randomization schedule using SAS 
software Version 9.4 or later (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina) for IRT, which will link sequential subject randomization numbers to treatment codes. The randomization will 
also use an appropriate block size, which will not be revealed. 
5.2 Treatments Administered  
Subjects will be administered study drug orally at the clinic on Day 1 and on Days 7 and 14, after the pre-dose pharmacokinetic sample, with approximately 240 mL (8 oz) of water in the 
morning between [ADDRESS_1070304] or food. If necessary, a dosing cup can be used to facilitate administration. Study drug will be dispensed to the 
parent/LAR for study drug to be administered to the subject at home. Clinic staff will provide 
the parent/LAR a Study Drug Reminder Card and instruct the parent/LAR to record the date 
and time of every dose taken at home and to bring this card back to the next clinic visit.  
On Days 2 to 6 and 8 to 13, the parent/LAR will be instructed to give the subject study drug 
orally with approximately 240 mL (8 oz) of water each morning between [ADDRESS_1070305] or food. Any missed doses should also be recorded by 
[CONTACT_7071]/LAR and communicated to clinic staff immediately. All dosing information 
including missed doses will be recorded on the Study Drug Reminder Card and in the eCRF.

reasons for screening failure, as applicable.  
6.1 Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
6.1.1 Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Parents/LARs will ensure that the subject arrives at the clinic in the morning on Days 7 and 14 for pharmacokinetic sampling. Subjects should not eat or take the vonoprazan study drug 
before arriving at the clinic. The Day 7 and 14 dose of study drug will be given in the clinic.   
Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis of vonoprazan in plasma will be collected on 
Days 7 and 14. On Day 7, one pre-dose sample will be collected prior to the morning administration of vonoprazan along with two additional samples collected after drug 
administration: one between 0.[ADDRESS_1070316]-dose. On Day 14, one pre-dose sample will be collected prior to the morning administration of vonoprazan along with two additional samples collected after drug administration: one between [ADDRESS_1070317] source

Blood samples will be collected into sodium heparin vacutainer collection tubes and 
processed into plasma. Details of collection, processing, storage and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_778761]. 
Bioanalytical Methods Plasma concentrations of vonoprazan will be measured at Labcorp Early Development 
Laboratories Inc. (Madison, WI) using a validated liquid chromatrography/mass spectrometry 
method with an analytical range of 0.5 to 100 ng/mL and will be used for the calculation of 
the plasma vonoprazan pharmacokinetic parameters.  
Depending on pace of enrollment, pharmacokinetic samples from a subset or subsets of subjects may be analyzed prior to the completion of enrollment. In any case, all of the 
pharmacokinetic samples collected from a given subject will be analyzed in the same 
bioanalytical batch.  
Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters shown in Table 6 -1 will be estimated using a non -lin
 ear 
mixed effects model and will be determined from the concentration- time data for all 
evaluable subjects. The primary vonoprazan pharmacokinetic endpoints will include the following steady state parameters: C
max,ss, AUC τ, CL/F and V z/F. Actual sampling times,  
rather than scheduled or nominal sampling times, will be used in all computations using sampling time. Additional pharmacokinetic parameters may be estimated as appropriate.

• Indicates a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a pre-existing condition. 
(Intermittent events for pre -existing conditions or underlying disease should not be 
considered PTEs or AEs.) 
• Necessitates therapeutic intervention. 
• Requires an invasive diagnostic procedure. 
• Requires discontinuation or a change in dose of study drug or a concomitant medication.  
• Is considered unfavorable by [CONTACT_109307].

Protocol: VPED -[ADDRESS_1070333]  2023  
Page 45 • Is caused by a study procedure (eg, a bruise after blood collection); these events 
should be recorded as a PTE/AE. 
Diagnoses versus signs and symptoms: 
• Each event is required to be recorded to represent a single diagnosis or disorder using standard medical terminology rather than individual symptoms. Accompanying signs 
(including abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be 
record ed as additional AEs. If a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should 
be recorded appropriately as a PTE(s) or as an AE(s).  
Laboratory values and ECG findings: 
• Changes in laboratory values or ECG parameters are only considered to be PTEs or AEs if  they are judged to be clinically significant (eg, if some action or intervention is 
required or if the investigator judges the change to be beyond the range of normal 
physiologic fluctuation). A laboratory retest and/or continued monitoring of an abnormal value are not considered an intervention. In addition, repeated or additional noninvasive testing for verification, evaluation, or monitoring of an abnormality is 
not considered an intervention. 
• If abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of a pathology for which there is an overall diagnosis (eg, increased creatinine in renal failure), the diagnosis 
only should be reported as a PTE or as an AE. 
Pre-existing conditions: 
• Pre-existing conditions (present at the time of signing informed conse nt) are 
considered concurrent medical conditions and should NOT be recorded as PTEs or AEs. Abnormal findings identified at baseline evaluations and screening assessments (eg, laboratory tests, ECG, endoscopy, or X-rays) should NOT be recorded as PTEs 
unless related to study procedures. However, if the subject experiences a worsening 
or complication of a concurrent condition, the worsening or complication should be recorded appropriately as a PTE (worsening or complication occurs before start of 
study drug) or an AE (worsening or complication occurs after start of study drug). 
Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc. vonoprazan  
Protocol: VPED -[ADDRESS_1070334]  2023  
Page 46 Investigators should ensure that the event term recorded captures the change in the 
condition (eg, “worsening of…”).  
• If a subject has a pre-existing epi[INVESTIGATOR_174343] (eg, asthma, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]), any occurrence of an epi[INVESTIGATOR_45284] a PTE/AE if the epi[INVESTIGATOR_778764], serious, or severe in nature, that is, investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condition from baseline 
(eg “worsening of…”).  
• If a subject has a degenerative concurrent condition (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid arthritis), worsening of the condition should only be captured as a PTE/AE if 
occurring to a greater extent than that which would be expected. Again, inve stigators 
should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condition (eg, “worsening of…”).  
Worsening of PTEs or AEs: 
• If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of a PTE after starting 
administration of the study drug, the worsening or complication should be recorded appropriately as an AE. Investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded 
captures the change in the condition (eg, “worsening of…”).  
• If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after any change in 
study drug, the worsening or complication should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the 
condition (eg, “worsening of…”).  
• At each required study visit, all AEs that have occurred since the previous visit or 
AEs that have changed in severity since the previous visit must be recorded in the AE 
record of the eCRF.  
Changes in severity of AEs/serious PTEs: 
• If the subject experiences a change in severity of an AE/serious PTE, the event sho uld 
be captured once with the maximum severity recorded. 
Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc. vonoprazan  
Protocol: VPED -[ADDRESS_1070335]  2023  
Page 47 Preplanned procedures:  
• Preplanned procedures that were scheduled prior to signing of informed consent are 
not considered PTEs or AEs. However, if a preplanned procedure is performed early 
(eg, as an  emergency) due to a worsening of the pre-existing condition, the worsening 
of the condition should be captured appropriately as a PTE or an AE. Complications resulting from any planned procedure should be reported as AEs. 
Elective surgeries or procedures:  
• Elective procedures performed where there is no change in the subject’s medical 
condition should not be recorded as PTEs or AEs but should be documented in the 
subject’s source documents. Complications resulting from an elective surgery should 
be reporte d as AEs.  
Insufficient clinical response (lack of efficacy):  
• Insufficient clinical response, efficacy, or pharmacologic action should NOT be recorded as an AE. The investigator must make the distinction between exacerbation 
of pre -existing illness and lack  of therapeutic efficacy.  
Overdose: 
• Any manifested side effects will be considered AEs and will be recorded on the AE 
page of the eCRF.

[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1070337]’s 
daily activities. The intensity of the AE will be rated as mild, moderate, or severe using the 
following criteria:  
Mild:  The event is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].  
Moderate:  The event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject’s usual 
activities.  
Severe:  The event causes considerable interference with the subject’s usual activities.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented to allow an assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. Adverse events characterized 
as intermittent do not require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Assessment of Causality  
The investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to study drug is part of the 
documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the 
study. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be 
reported. 
The relationship or association of each AE to study drug(s ) will be assessed using the 
following categories: 
Related:  An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study 
drug (including the course after withdrawal of the drug), or for which possible involvement of the drug cannot be ruled out, although factors other than the study drug, such as underlying diseases, complications, concomitant drugs, and concurrent treatments, may also be responsible. 
Not Related:  
An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug and/or that can reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_1604], such as underlying diseases, complications, concomitant drugs, and concurrent 
treatments.  
 
Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc. vonoprazan  
Protocol: VPED -[ADDRESS_1070338]  2023  
Page 49 [IP_ADDRESS].3  Relationship to Study Procedures  
Relationship (causality) to study procedures should be determined for all PTEs and AEs. 
The relationship should be assessed as related if the investigator considers that there is 
reasonable possibility that an event is due to a study procedure. Otherwise, the relationship should be assessed as not related. 
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Start  Date  
The start date of the AE/PTE is the date that the first signs/symptoms were noted by [CONTACT_3184]/or physician. 
[IP_ADDRESS].5  Stop Date  
The stop date of the AE/PTE is the date at which the subject recovered, the event resolved but with sequelae, or the subject died. 
[IP_ADDRESS].6  Frequency  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_11742]/PTE (eg, vomiting) or those which occur repeatedly over a period of consecutive days are considered intermittent. All other events are considered continuous. 
[IP_ADDRESS].7  Action Concerning Study Drug  
• Drug withdrawn: A study drug is stopped due to the particular AE. 
• Dose not changed: The particular AE did not require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a study drug. 
• Unknown: Only to be used if it has not been possible to determine what action has 
been taken.  
• Not applicable: A study drug was stopped for a reason other than the particular AE, eg, the study has been terminated, the subject died, or dosing with the study drug was 
already stopped before the onset of the AE. 
• Dose interrupted: The dose was interrupted/held due to the particular AE. 
Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc. vonoprazan  
Protocol: VPED -[ADDRESS_1070339]  2023  
Page 50 [IP_ADDRESS].8  Outcome 
• Recovered/resolved: Subject returned to baseline status with respect to the AE/PTE.  
• Recovering/resolving: The intensity is lowered by [CONTACT_1734]: the diagnosis 
or signs/symptoms have lessened/improved; the abnormal laboratory value improved 
but has not returned to the normal range or to baseline; or the subject died from a cause other than the particular AE/PTE with the condition remaining 
“recovering/resolving.”  
• Not recovered/not resolved: There is no change in the diagnosis, signs, or symptoms; the intensity of the diagnosis, signs/symptoms, or laboratory value on the last day of 
the observed study period has worsened from when it started; is an irreversible congenital anomaly; or the subject died from another cause with the particular 
AE/PTE state remaining “ Not recovered/not resolved.”  
• Resolved with sequelae: Subject recovered from an acute AE/PTE but was left with permanent/significant impairment (eg, recovered from a cardiovascular accident but 
with some persisting paresis).  
• Fatal: The AEs/PTEs are consider ed the cause of death.  
• Unknown: The course of the AE/PTE cannot be followed up due to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_778765]’s participation in the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE 
Information  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1070340] administered study drug (Day 1). Routine collection will continue until the follow-up visit or withdrawal from 
the study. 
Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc. vonoprazan  
Protocol: VPED -[ADDRESS_1070341] occurred. A 
neutral question, such as “How have you been feeling since your last visit?” may be asked. 
Subjects may report AEs occurring at any other time during the study. Subjects experiencing a serious PTE must be monitored until the symptoms subside and any clinically relevant changes in laboratory values have returned to baseline or there is a satisfactory explanation 
for the change. Nonserious PTEs, related or unrelated to the study procedure, need not be 
followed up for the purposes of the protocol. All subjects experiencing AEs, whether considered associated with the use of the study drug or not, must be monitored until the symptoms subside and any clinically relevant changes in laboratory values have returned to 
baseline or until there is a satisfactory explanation for the changes observed. 
All PTEs and AEs will be documented in the PTE/AE page of the eCRF, whether or not the 
investigator concludes that the event is related to the drug treatment. The following information will be documented for each event: 
• Event term  
• Start and stop date 
• Severity  
• Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_637837](s) (related or not related) (not completed for PTEs) 
• Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_117497](s), including the details of the suspected procedure 
• Action concerning study drug (not applicable for PTEs) 
• Outcome of event

Protocol: VPED -[ADDRESS_1070342]  2023  
Page 52 [IP_ADDRESS].2  Collection and Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
When an SAE occurs through the AE collection period, it should be reported according to the 
following procedure:  
An SAE eCRF must be completed and submitted via Medidata Rave immediately or within 
[ADDRESS_1070343] onset or notification of the event. The information should be completed as 
fully as possible but contain, at a minimum: 
• A short description of the event and the reason why the event is categorized as serious 
• Subject identification number 
• Investigator’s name 
• Name [CONTACT_115210](s) 
• Causality assessment  
If the Medidata Rave system is not functioning for any reason, a paper SAE case report form must be completed (in English), signed by [CONTACT_093], and faxed to the contact [CONTACT_778787]. 
The SAE form should be transmitted within [ADDRESS_1070344] Information 
 
SAE Hotline:  
SAE Fax:  or  
 
Any SAE spontaneously reported to the investigator following the AE collection period 
should be reported to the sponsor if considered related to study participation. 

Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc. vonoprazan  
Protocol: VPED -[ADDRESS_1070345] has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study drug or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor. Reporting of serious PTEs will follow the 
procedure described for SAEs. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1070346] report becomes available at a later date, the 
investigator should update the SAE eCRF and transmit it immediately within 24 hours of 
receipt. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1672] (eg, ECGs, laboratory tests, 
discharge summary, postmortem results) should be provided, if requested. 
All SAEs should be followed up until resolution or permanent outcome of the event. The 
timelines and procedure for follow- up reports are the same as those for the initial report.  
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Safety Reporting to Investigators, IRB/IECs, and Regulatory 
Authorities 
The sponsor designee (contract research organization) will be delegated the responsibility for 
reporting all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) and any other 
applicable SAEs to regulatory authorities, investigators, and the IRB/IEC, as applicable. Relative to the first awareness of the event by/or further provision to the sponsor or sponsor’s designee, S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be submitted to the regulatory authorities (eg, EudraVigilance 
Database, FDA Adverse Event Reporting System) as an expedited report within [ADDRESS_1070347] or that would be sufficient to consider changes in the investigational medicinal 
products. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs 
Prompt notification by [CONTACT_68477]/sponsor designee of an SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities toward the safety of s ubjects 
and the safety of a study drug under clinical investigation are met.

the safety of a study drug under clinical investigation. The sponsor/sponsor designee w ill 
comply with regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, 
IRB/IEC , and investigators. 
For all studies except those utilizing medical devices, investigator safety reports must be 
prepared for S[LOCATION_003]Rs according to regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and 
forwarded to investigators as necessary. 
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will revi ew 
and then file it and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate, according to local requirements. 
If there is an increase in unexpected SAEs or if there is a change in the frequency and 
character of expected SAEs based on the known safety profile of vonoprazan, further evaluation will be conducted to characterize these events and any impact on benefit/risk. 
Health authorities will be consulted to agree upon the appropriate action to be taken 
regarding the conduct of the study, including no change to the protocol, revision of the safety monitoring plan, suspension of enrollment, or discontinuation of the study.

Protocol: VPED -[ADDRESS_1070351] of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and the SoE 
(Section  13.1) for the timing and frequency. 
• The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record 
any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the eCRF. Th e laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Abnormal 
laboratory findings that are expected with the underlying disease should not be 
considered clinically significant unless judged by [CONTACT_1173]’s condition. 
• All laboratory tests with abnormal values considered clinically significant during 
participation in the study or within [ADDRESS_1070352] dose of study drug should be 
repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_10982].  
o If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged 
reasonable by [CONTACT_093], the etiology should be identified, and the

o All protocol-required laboratory assessments, as defined in Table  6-4, must be 
conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoE. 
 If laboratory values from non–protocol-specified laboratory assessments performed at the institution’s local laboratory require a change in subject management or are considered clinically significant 
by [CONTACT_093] (eg, SAE, AE, or dose modification), then the 
results must be recorded in the unscheduled laboratory eCRF. 
All samples will be collected in accordance with acceptable laboratory procedures. Details of these procedures and required safety monitoring will be provided in the laboratory manual.

11.1 Monitoring  
11.1.1  External Data Monitoring Committee  
An external data monitoring committee will not be used for this study . This is a Phase 1 study 
with 14 days dosing and adverse events will be evaluated on an ongoing basis. Additionally,  
vonoprazan has a well characterized safety profile in adults.  
11.1.2  Monitoring of the Study  
The clinical monitor, acting as the main line of communication between the sponsor (or 
designee) and the investigator and as a representative of the sponsor, has the obligation to 
follow the study closely. In doing so, the monitor will visit the investigator and study site at periodic intervals, in addition to maintaining necessary telephone and letter contact. The monitor will maintain current personal knowledge of the study through observation, review 
of study records and source documentation, and discussion of the conduct of the study with 
the investigato r and personnel. 
All aspects of the study will be carefully monitored, by [CONTACT_3552], for compliance with applicable government regulation with respect to current GCP and current 
standard operating procedures. 
11.1.3  Inspection of Records  
Investigators and institutions involved in the study will permit study-related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory inspections by [CONTACT_21766]. In the event of an audit, the investigator agrees to allow the sponsor, representatives of the sponsor, or a regulatory agency access to all study records. 
The investigator should promptly notify the sponsor and  of any audits scheduled by [CONTACT_513365][INVESTIGATOR_778766].

IRB/IEC for approval before subjects can be enrolled into an amended protocol. 
11.2.[ADDRESS_1070375]’s source documentation any deviation from the approved protocol. The investigator may implement a 
deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects without prior IRB/IEC approval. As soon as pos sible after such an occurrence, the 
implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it, and any proposed protocol amendments 
should be submitted to the IRB/IEC for review, to the sponsor for agreement, and to the 
regulatory authorities, if required. 
A dev iation from the protocol is an unintended or unanticipated departure from the 
procedures or processes approved by [CONTACT_135785]/IEC and agreed to by [CONTACT_1275]. A significant deviation occurs when there is nonadherence to the protocol by [CONTACT_21768] a significant additional risk to the subject. Significant deviations can include nonadherence to inclusion or exclusion criteria, or nonadherence to FDA regulations or ICH GCP guidelines, and may lead to the subject being withdrawn from 
the study (Section 4.2).  
Protocol deviations will be documented by [CONTACT_730009], the clinical monitor, 
and/or the contract research organization throughout the course of the study. Principal 
investigators will be notified in writing by [CONTACT_778793] a 
monitoring visit. The IRB/IEC should be notified of all protocol deviations they consider reportable in a timely manner.

Contraception Guidance: 
From  signing of informed  consent, throughout the duration of the study, and for [ADDRESS_1070388] dose of study drug, female subjects  of childbearing potential*  who are sexually  active 
with a nonsterilized  male partner** must use adequate contraception. In addition, they must 
be advised not to donate ova during this period. 
*Females NOT of childbearing potential are defined as those who are premenarchal, 
have been surgically sterilized (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation) or who are postmenopausal (eg, defined as at least [ADDRESS_1070389] regular 
menses with a follicle -stimulating hormone level >[ADDRESS_1070390] regular menses, confirmed before any study drug is 
implemented).  
**Sterilized males should be at least [ADDRESS_1070391] obtained documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate.  
Note: If the childbearing potential of a subject changes after start of the study (eg, a 
premenarchal female subject experiences menarche) or the risk of pregnancy changes (eg, a 
female subject who is not heterosexually active becomes active), the p articipant must discuss 
this with the investigator, who should determine if the female subject must begin a highly effective method of contraception or a male participant must use a condom. 
Birth Control: Birth control methods considered acceptable for this study include: 
Barrier methods (each time that you have intercourse) : 
• Male condom PLUS spermicide 
• Cap (plus spermicidal cream or jelly) PLUS male condom and spermicide 
• Diaphragm (plus spermicidal cream or jelly) PLUS male condom and spermicide

• ALT or AST >3 × ULN AND a 2-fold increase above 
baseline value with appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%)  
ALT: a lanine aminotransferase; AST: aspartate aminotransferase; INR: international normalized ratio; 
ULN:  upper limit of normal  
 
In each of these instances, appropriate clinical follow -up should be instituted (including 
repeat laboratory tests) until a satisfactory conclusion (ie, until the AE resolves, the 
laboratory value returns to baseline, or the condition becomes stable). 
If a subject meets the liver safety criteria and must be discontinued from study drug, the 
subject will continue to be followed per the protocol schedule until the study is completed. If the subject r efuses to return for the study visits, telephone visits may be conducted; 
however, this is not preferred or recommended. The reason for discontinuation of study drug 
should be listed as an LFT abnormality.

Introduction (Section 1.0) V onoprazan belongs to a new class of acid-inhibitory agents called potassium- competitive 
acid blockers (PCABs). In the [LOCATION_002], vonoprazan in combination with amoxicillin 
and in combination with amoxicillin and clarithromycin have been approved for t he 
treatment of Helicobacter pylori  infection in adults. V onoprazan is being developed for the 
treatment of heartburn in patients with symptomatic non-erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease (sGERD), healing of all grades of erosive esophagitis (EE) and relief of heartburn and maintenance of healing of all grades of EE and relief of heartburn. 
In countries other than the [LOCATION_002], vonoprazan has been studied in other gastric acid-
related diseases such as healing of gastric and duodenal ulcers, and for the prevention of 
recurrence of gastric or duodenal ulcer during nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_11726]. V onoprazan has received regulatory approval for adults in Japan, Russia, and other countries in Asia and Latin America for a variety of indications, including the healing 
of erosive esophagitis and maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis. Vonoprazan is not 
currently approved for use in pediatric patients in any country.  
Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc. licensed the exclusive rights from [COMPANY_005] Pharmaceutical 
Company Limited ([COMPANY_005]) to develop, manufacture, and commercialize vonoprazan in the

Protocol: VPED -[ADDRESS_1070416]  2023  
Page 88 Study Rationale (Section 1.1) 
The purpose of this study is to determine a dose of vonoprazan in childr en aged ≥  6 to < 12 
years with body weight ≥ 30 kg with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) 
that provides an exposure similar to the exposures in adults after administration of 
vonoprazan 10 or 20 mg once daily (QD). Like proton pump inhibitors, vonoprazan is expected to provide benefit in pediatric patients with GERD.  
 
Vonoprazan (
Section 1.2.2) 
The gastric hydrogen, potassium–adenosine triphosphatase (H+, K+-ATPase), also known as 
the proton pump, is responsible for acid secretion from par ietal cells in the stomach. It is 
inactive in the cytosol but relocates from the cytosol to the secretory membrane of the parietal cells when food is present in the stomach, thereby [CONTACT_11752][INVESTIGATOR_007] 
H+ ions out of the cells and into the canaliculi in exchange for K+ ions. It represents an 
attractive pharmacological target since it is the final step of the acid secretion process.  
Two classes of pharmaceuticals, with distinct mechanisms of action for inhibiting the gastric proton pump, have been developed for clinical application: PPIs and PCABs. As a PCAB, 
vonoprazan has a unique mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics relative to PPIs: 
• Acid activation and stability: Conventional PPIs are prodrugs, which are activated by 
[CONTACT_778796] H+, K+- ATPase; however, activated PPIs are not 
stable in acidic conditions. In contrast, vonoprazan does not require acid activation, is stable in acidic conditions, and has a more durable effect. Further, vonoprazan is 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_778767], which concentrates the drug 
proximal to the H+, K+- ATPase [ Scar
pi[INVESTIGATOR_11735] 2019].  
• Activity against proton pumps: V onoprazan inhibits acid secretion by [CONTACT_778797] H+, K+- ATPase. V onopraza n may 
selectively concentrate in the parietal cells in both the resting and stimulated states 
and binds to the active pumps in a noncovalent and reversible manner. In contrast, PPIs covalently bind H+, K+- ATPase only when the pump is active, as an acidic 
environment is required for the activation and accumulation of PPIs in the parietal cell [ Scott  2015
].  
Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc. vonoprazan  
Protocol: VPED -[ADDRESS_1070417]  2023  
Page 89 • V onoprazan maintains acid control over 24 hours with QD dosing [ Engevik 2020]. 
V onoprazan can also be dosed in the presence or absence of food, while mos t PPIs  
require dosing before a meal to optimize their acid suppressant effect because 
activated pumps are at their highest level post -prandially due to activation of pumps 
by [CONTACT_45325] [ Shin 2013].  
• Extended half- life: The mean plasma half -life is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 7 to 8 hours after single and 
multiple QD administration of vonoprazan 20 mg (TAK- 438_107). This is 
significantly longer than the half- life of conventional PPIs (<2 hours) [ Shin 2013
]. 
• Metabolism: V onoprazan is metabolized by a combination of cytochrome P450 
(C
YP) isoforms including CYP3A4/5, which does not have a high degree of genetic 
polymorphism as compared with CYP2C19, which is the primary enzyme responsible for the metabolism of PPIs [ Shin 2013].  
T
hese unique aspects of the vonoprazan mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics relative 
to PP
Is translate into greater magnitude and duration of gastric acid suppression, which are 
reflected in the pharmacodynamic profile [ Jenkins
 2015; Sakurai  2015].  
The
 pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of vonoprazan were assessed in 
multiple studies, including Study TAK-438_107, which showed rapid rise in pH following 
vonoprazan administration and a dose response for percent time above pH 4. The mean 
percentage of time above pH  4 on Day 1 for vonoprazan 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg were 
43%, 63%, and 86%, respectively, and by [CONTACT_2006] 7 were 60%, 85%, and 93%, respectively 
[Jenkins
 2015].  
[COMPANY_005] conducted 8 short- term clinical studies in adults with EE (5  studies) and symptomatic 
non-erosive GERD (3 studies) with treatment durations of 2 to 8 weeks. In addition, [COMPANY_005] conducted 3 studies of maintenance of healing of EE with treatment durations of 24 to 52 weeks. V onoprazan is approved in multiple countries outside of the [LOCATION_002] for the treatment of adults for reflux (erosive) esophagitis (for healing: vonoprazan [ADDRESS_1070418], 8 weeks; for maintenance: [ADDRESS_1070419], 20 mg QD). 
The safety profile of vonoprazan in Phase 3 studies of adults across indications showed no 
evidence of a dose -related increase in adverse effects with vonoprazan from 5  mg to 40 mg 
Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc. vonoprazan  
Protocol: VPED -[ADDRESS_1070420]-marketing patient exposure to 
vonoprazan is estimated to be approximately 7097 million patients.  
Overall, with vonoprazan’s pharmacological profile of rapid, potent, and sustained elevations 
of gastric pH, vonoprazan offers the potential to be a highly effective treatment option for children with symptomatic GERD.  
 
Justification fo r Dose (Section 1.3) 
The proposed pediatric doses are selected to approximate equivalent adult exposures 
foll
owing administration of vonoprazan 10 or 20 mg QD in children  aged  pediatric patients  ≥ 
6 to < 12 years of age with body weight of ≥ 30 kg.  
The proposed doses are based on simulations using a an updated population pharmacokinetic 
(popPK) model [Facius 2023] . The 2-compartment linear popPK model for vonoprazan was 
developed with adult pharmacokinetic  data from  [ADDRESS_1070421] patients.characterization of the disposition of 
vonoprazan in pediatric subjects . The final dataset consisted of  1,179354 subjects ( 769205 
Asian and 410149 Western) with  [ADDRESS_1070422] doses in pediatric subjects aged ≥ 6 to <12 years, 
simula tions were performed using the updated popPK model for  vonoprazan exposure in

Protocol: VPED -[ADDRESS_1070423]  2023  
Page 91 infants, children, and adolescents (PopPK Simulation Memo).and were summarized by [CONTACT_778798] . For reference, all boys and girls aged ≥ 6 to < [ADDRESS_1070424] a body weight between 15 and 
65 kg. Different model assumptions in terms of  (i) the allometric weight scaling exponent (as 
estimated  (none)  in the adult data or fixed at 0.75) and (ii) if or if not to correct for enzyme 
maturation in infants 2) were compared.  
The resulting models were updated model was  used to simulate posterior distributions of area 
under the drug concentration- time curve at steady state (AUC ss) in both adults and ped iatrics  
pediatric subjects aged ≥6 to <12 years or with a body weight of 15 to 65 kg for a series of 
pediatric candidate doses. Matching pediatric doses were selected to limit the predicted 
percentage of pediatrics pediatric subjects with an exposure exceeding the adult reference 
exposure (median AUC ss) at 50  to 60%.  
For children aged ≥ 6 to < 12 years  or with a  body weight ≥ 30of [ADDRESS_1070425] similar exposure predictions, thereby [CONTACT_778799] (10 and 20 mg) should result in a majority of exposures that are within the 95% prediction interval in adults for both the 10 and 20 mg 
targeted doses.

This section describes the statistical and analytical methods to be used for the study. A 
statistical analysis plan will provide further details of the statistical methods for the analysis.  
 
Sample Size Calculations (Section 7.1) 
Approximately 18 subjects are expected to be enrolled with 9 subjects in each dose group. 
Attempts will be made to enroll subjects across the ≥ 6 to < 12 years age range. Because this is a pharmacokinetic and safety trial with no comparator, there is no power determination affecting the sample size. The sample size of approximately 18 subjects is considered 
sufficien t to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of vonoprazan in this 
population. Fewer subjects may be enrolled based on preliminary data, if considered 
sufficient to adequately characterize the PK profile.  
 
Analysis Sets (Section 7.2) 
The pharmacokinetic population will include subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_1070469] 1 dose of study drug.

From  signing of informed  consent, throughout the duration of the study, and for [ADDRESS_1070480] dose of study drug, female subjects  of childbearing potential*  who are sexually  active 
with a nonsterilized male partner** must use adequate contraception. In addition, they must 
be advised not to donate ova during this period. 
*Females NOT of childbearing potential are defined as those who are premenarchal, 
have been surgically sterilized (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation) or who are postmenopausal (eg, defined as at least [ADDRESS_1070481] regular 
menses with a follicle -stimulating hormone level >[ADDRESS_1070482] regular menses,  confirmed before any study drug is 
implemented).  
**Sterilized males should be at least [ADDRESS_1070483] obtained documentation of the absence of sperm in the 
ejaculate.  
Note: If the childbearing potential of a subject changes after start of the study (eg, a 
premenarchal female subject experiences menarche) or the risk of pregnancy changes (eg, a 
female subject who is not heterosexually active becomes active), the participant must discuss this with the investiga tor, who should determine if the female subject must begin a highly 
effective method of contraception or a male participant must use a condom.

Laboratory Analy ses (Section 6.3.3) 
Investigators must document their review of each laboratory safety report. 
See Table  6-[ADDRESS_1070498] of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and the SoE 
(Secti
on 13.1) f
or the timing and frequency. 
• The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record 
any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the 
eCRF. The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Abnormal 
laboratory findings that are expected with the underlying disease should not be 
considered clinically significant unless judged by [CONTACT_093] t o be more severe 
than expected for the subject’s condition. 
• All laboratory tests with abnormal values considered clinically significant during 
participation in the study or within [ADDRESS_1070499] dose of study drug should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered 
clinically significant by [CONTACT_10982].  
o If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable by [CONTACT_093], the etiology should be identified, and the 
sponsor notified. 
o All protocol-required laboratory assessments, as defined in Tab
 le 6-
[ADDRESS_1070500]
ed in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoE. 
 If la
boratory values from non–protocol-specified laboratory 
assessments perf ormed at the institution’s local laboratory require a 
change in subject management or are considered clinically significant 
by [CONTACT_093] (eg, SAE, AE, or dose modification), then the 
results must be recorded in the unscheduled laboratory eCRF. 
All s amples will be collected in accordance with acceptable laboratory procedures. Details of 
these procedures and required safety monitoring will be provided in the laboratory manual.

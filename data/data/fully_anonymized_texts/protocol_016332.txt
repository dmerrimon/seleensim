PROTOCOL TITLE: Comparing nose & mouth breathing during exercise
Page 4 of 15Revised: January 7, [ZIP_CODE].0Objectives*
2.1Objective: To compare physiological responses between nose and mouth 
breathing at rest and during exercise.
2.2Hypotheses: Breathing through the nose will elicit an improved autonomic 
cardiovascular profile (lower heart rate, higher heart rate variability, etc.) at rest 
and during exercise.
3.0Background*
3.1Breathing patterns can affect the cardiovascular system. Little is known about how 
nose versus mouth breathing affects cardiovascular variables (heart rate, heart 
rate variability, etc.) at rest and during exercise. It has been suggested that 
breathing through the nose can cause calmness and lower blood pressure. 
However, research is needed to examine the extent to which breathing through the 
nose affects cardiovascular variables at rest and during exercise.
4.0Study Endpoints*
4.1The primary outcome of this project is the difference in heart rate between nose 
and mouth breathing during cycling exercise. While this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] (i.e., no aprior 
power analysis was conducted), we expect that having 20 individuals complete 
testing will inform us as to whether additional research is needed (e.g., a new, 
larger study or a request to increase the enrollment for the present IRB).
4.2We expect very low attrition because there is only one visit. However, to be 
conservative, we will employ an attrition estimate of 33% due to potential screen 
failures, loss of interest, the decision to discontinue, etc. Thus, we will enroll up to 
[ADDRESS_439598] collected data from 20 individuals.
4.3There are no safety endpoints. Safety will be monitored throughout the study per 
IRB guidelines.
5.0Study Intervention/Investigational Agent
5.1Description: We will determine the extent to which cardiovascular variables (e.g., 
heart rate) change between nose and mouth breathing conditions at rest and 
during exercise.

Page 5 of 15Revised: January 7, 2021A qualified member of the research team (e.g., Joseph Watso, Ph.D.) will perform 
the initial participant contact [CONTACT_353103], email, or in person. This 
contact [CONTACT_353104]. Interested individuals will be 
invited to the laboratory where a member of the research team will explain the study 
(purpose, procedures, risks, benefits, alternatives to participation, etc.) in lay 
language and will ensure the inclusion/exclusion criteria are satisfied. The potential 
participant will be provided with adequate time to read the consent, ask additional 
questions, and consider his/her options. Care will be taken that the participant is not 
pressured, and that staff is available to address any questions. If the potential 
participant indicates that they would like to participate, open-ended questions will be 
asked to assess comprehension. Once the researcher has ensured that the potential 
participant understands the protocol, s/he will be asked to sign the consent form. 
Staff phone numbers will be provided to the participants for any questions related to 
the study protocol.
Persons from vulnerable populations will not be invited to participate. Potential 
participants will not be coerced to participate, nor will coercive language be used in 
any recruitment materials. When presenting the study to participants, all risks will be 
outlined, the benefits will not be overly exaggerated, and it will be explained as 
completely voluntary.
B) Study Procedures, Materials, and Potential Risks
All devices used for research procedures are used routinely in clinical practice unless 
noted as ‘research only’ devices/procedures in the following section.
Individuals included as personnel in this IRB study will conduct the research 
procedures. The training and qualifications of researchers are available and include, 
but aren’t limited to, education in human physiology, clinical research experience, 
and CITI human subjects research certifications. All data processing would be 
completed while researchers are blind to the participant's condition (nose vs mouth 
breathing). 
We will ask participants to avoid caffeine, alcohol, and vigorous exercise for [ADDRESS_439599] 
and hip circumferences. We will measure blood pressure and autonomic 
cardiovascular function via ECG and beat-to-beat blood pressure. Participants will 
complete submaximal and maximal exercise testing, during which time we will 
assess heart rate, blood pressure, blood oxygenation, and perceptual ratings (e.g., 
exertion and breathlessness). 
Data will be digitized upon acquisition and stored in password-protected computer 
folders. Only approved personnel will have access to participant files that will 
otherwise be locked. Members and staff of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at 
[LOCATION_012] State University may review participant records. A representative of these 
IRBs may contact [CONTACT_353105]. The participant may refuse to answer any questions that the 
representative of the IRB may ask. Participants’ information will be kept confidential 
unless the participant permits the researchers to share that information with others 
or if the investigators are required by [CONTACT_186168]. Hard-copy documents will be 
locked and only personnel who are involved in this research project will have access 
to the files. Information contained in reports or publications issued as a result of this

PROTOCOL TITLE: Comparing nose & mouth breathing during exercise
Page 6 of 15Revised: January 7, 2021research project will be presented in such a way that the participant’s identity will not 
be revealed. The signed consent form will be kept on file in the participant’s 
laboratory folder. Disclosure of information to third parties will be prohibited. 
PROCEDURES
You will be asked to visit the Cardiovascular and Applied Physiology (CAP) 
Laboratory for one visit lasting up to approximately 2.5 hours. We ask that you avoid 
caffeine, alcohol, and strenuous exercise for 24 hours and food for 2 hours before 
your laboratory visit. Please wear, or bring, exercise clothes (e.g., athletic shorts and 
a t-shirt).
Order of procedures:
- Consent 
- Screening (e.g., blood pressure) & questionnaires
- Instrumentation (e.g., ECG for heart rate)
- Quiet seated rest baseline (~10 minutes)
- Submaximal exercise (~21 minutes)
- Maximal exercise (OPTIONAL; ~10-15 minutes)
B1. Body mass and waist-to-hip circumference. We will ask participants to step on a 
scale and use a tape measure to determine their waist and hip circumference.
B2. Heart rate and rhythm (electrocardiogram). We will place sticky pad electrodes 
on the skin of the torso. Participants might feel mild temporary discomfort when the 
sticky pads are removed.
B3. Arm blood pressure. We will measure brachial blood pressure in the laboratory. 
Participants might feel mild temporary discomfort when the cuff is inflated.
B4. Finger blood pressure and blood oxygenation. Blood pressure will be monitored 
using a cuff placed on the finger. Participants might feel mild temporary discomfort 
when the finger cuff is inflated - if needed, we can pause this device intermittently. 
We will place a pulse oximeter on a different finger.
B5. Fabric belt to measure respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. We will place a soft, fabric belt around the 
ribcage on top of any clothing. This belt will measure ribcage expansion/contraction 
to record the rate of breathing.
B6. Submaximal cycling exercise. After a ~10-minute resting period, we will ask 
participants to pedal on a cycle at 75 watts (5.5 METS, or moderate intensity1) of 
resistance for approximately [ADDRESS_439600] parking 
garage (22.5 minutes @ 3.2 mph walking velocity; or 5.3 METS1). The 21 minutes 
of cycling will be broken up into three 7-minute segments: one with ‘free’ breathing, 
one with nose-only breathing (we’ll remind individuals to only breathe through the 
nose by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_353093]), and one with mouth-only breathing (we’ll 
provide participants with a soft nose clip to wear). The order of nose and mouth 
breathing will be randomly assigned. We will periodically show participants two 
printed visual scales (e.g., breathlessness from 1 to 10 with ‘mild’, ‘severe’ etc. as 
anchors) and ask them to rate their overall exertion and breathlessness.

PROTOCOL TITLE: Comparing nose & mouth breathing during exercise
Page 7 of 15Revised: January 7, 2021*During the rest period and last 14 minutes of submaximal exercise testing, 
we will provide audio cues via a metronome to help pace breathing 
based on habitual breathing rate (e.g., if they breathe at 15 breaths/minute 
at rest, we will set the metronome to this pace for the ~10 minutes of resting 
data collection).

B7. Maximal cycling exercise (OPTIONAL). Participants will be asked to perform a 
maximal exercise test (i.e., strenuous exercise) while we progressively increase the 
cycling workload until participants can no longer sustain pedaling. This will take 
approximately 10-15 minutes. We will periodically show participants two printed 
visual scales (e.g., breathlessness from 1 to 10 with ‘mild’, ‘severe’ etc. as anchors) 
and ask them to rate their overall exertion and breathlessness.
C) Protection Against Risk
As with all studies involving human participants, there are risks associated with 
experimentation. To reduce these risks, all participants must meet the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria to participate in this research study to maximize the risk-
to-benefit ratio. We will continually monitor the well-being of each participant. The 
risks and benefits will be explained to the participants before each signs an 
institutionally approved consent form. If any adverse events occur, participants will 
be notified and instructed to notify their primary care physician with any pertinent 
information/documentation. 
The following list describes the precautions and safeguards that are in place to 
minimize risk and treat participants should an adverse event occur:
Exercise Testing: Participants will complete lower-body cycling on a constant-load 
semi-recumbent ergometer. 
Risks and their mitigation: The major experimental procedure risk is the potential for 
abnormal cardiovascular responses (excessive increases in blood pressure, chest 
pain, etc) during exercise testing, particularly during maximal exercise. We will 
continue to follow ACSM guidelines for safely conducting exercise tests in clinical 
populations. Appropriate precautions are in place to prevent an adverse event and 
to treat the participant should an adverse event occur. If an adverse event should 
occur (e.g., chest pain following cessation of exercise), the participant will remain in 
the laboratory until they have fully recovered. Together, these precautions will 
minimize any risk to the participants such that the benefits derived from the proposed 
studies will far outweigh any risks. 
*While unlikely, if anyone is unable to keep their breathing rhythm with the 
metronome or become uncomfortable with nose or mouth only breathing, 
you can breathe as you’d like at any time (e.g., remove the nose clip and 
breathe slower or faster). If this happens, the participant can choose to 
continue with the next procedure (e.g., maximal testing without breathing 
prompts) or discontinue in the study. Either way, if there are incomplete 
data from an individual, we will enroll (up to 30 participants) an additional 
individual to complete this study. Based on the low workload required, we 
don’t expect that this will occur very often, if at all.

Page 8 of 15Revised: January 7, 2021Arterial blood pressure and heart rate: Arterial blood pressure will be monitored 
via automated oscillometric measurement, manual auscultation, and/or 
photoplethysmography (Finometer; beat-to-beat). Heart rate will be measured from 
the ECG.
Risks and their mitigation: There are no known risks involved with this procedure.  
If an adverse event does arise, the study personnel will be responsible for immediate 
medical treatment as needed. Every investigator involved will be knowledgeable of 
emergency service contact [CONTACT_353106]. Information regarding unexpected adverse events that occur will be relayed 
to other participants in the study within 24 hours of the occurrence via telephone, 
email, or in person if necessary.
All unexpected serious adverse events will be immediately (within 24 hours) 
addressed and reported to the IRB. In accordance with the FSU Investigator Manual, 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_353094] 5 business days 
for any of the following information items: information that indicates a new or 
increased risk, or a new safety issue; harm experienced by a subject or other 
individual, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_353095] (will be reported within 24 hours if an unexpected 
serious adverse event); non-compliance with the federal regulations governing 
human research or with the requirements or determinations of the IRB, or an 
allegation of such non-compliance; audit, inspection, or inquiry by a federal agency 
and any resulting reports; written reports of study monitors; failure to follow the 
protocol due to the action or inaction of the investigator or research staff; breach of 
confidentiality; change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate an 
apparent immediate hazard to a subject; incarceration of a subject in a study not 
approved by [CONTACT_353107]; complaint of a subject that cannot be 
resolved by [CONTACT_5051]; premature suspension or termination of the protocol 
by [CONTACT_456], investigator, or institution; or unanticipated adverse device effect 
(any unanticipated serious adverse device effect will be reported within 24 hours). 
The PI, co-investigators, and research staff will protect the rights, safety, and welfare 
of subjects involved in the research.
Overall Risk-Benefits Ratio: In total, the overall risk associated with participating in 
these studies is relatively low. The risks of this study are mitigated by [CONTACT_353108]. The benefits are that the data and mechanistic 
insight gained will help inform us about the effects of nasal versus mouth breathing 
on cardiovascular responses during exercise. It is our opi[INVESTIGATOR_353096].

participant needs treatment not allowed in this study, the study is canceled, or for 
other administrative reasons. 
14.2Participants will be contact[CONTACT_353110]. The reason(s) will be thoroughly 
explained to each participant, and any further questions will be answered. 
14.3Any data already collected from the withdrawn subject will be retained and used in 
the final analysis.
15.0Risks to Subjects*
15.1 Risks
Exercise
The major experimental procedure risk is the potential for abnormal cardiovascular 
responses (excessive increases in blood pressure, chest pain, etc) during exercise 
testing, particularly during maximal exercise. We will continue to follow ACSM 
guidelines for safely conducting exercise tests in clinical populations. Appropriate 
precautions are in place to prevent an adverse event and to treat the participant 
should an adverse event occur. If an adverse event should occur (e.g., chest pain 
following cessation of exercise), the participant will remain in the laboratory until they 
have fully recovered. Together, these precautions will minimize any risk to the 
participants such that the benefits derived from the proposed studies will far 
outweigh any risks.
Loss of confidentiality:
There is a slight risk that information collected about participants could be revealed 
inappropriately or accidentally. Taking part in this research involves providing 
information that is considered confidential or private. Efforts such as coding research 
records, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_353097], and allowing only authorized people to 
have access to research records, will be made to keep volunteer information safe. 
All data and specimen samples will be labeled with a unique series of numbers. If 
samples will be transmitted outside [LOCATION_012] State University, all identifying 
information will be removed from the samples before they are released to any other 
investigators. Researchers will take appropriate steps to protect any information 
collected.
Unknown Risks: 
In addition to the risks listed above, participants may experience a previously 
unknown risk or side effect.
All unexpected serious adverse events will be immediately (within 24 hours) 
addressed and reported to the IRB. In accordance with the FSU Investigator Manual, 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_353094] 5 business days

22.0Consent Process
22.1For this study, we will follow the SOP: Informed Consent Process for Research 
(HRP-090). Participants who have been briefed on study procedures will be provided 
the opportunity to consent to participate. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or study team 
member(s) will brief potential participants on the purpose of the study, the 
procedures involved, risks, and expectations and requirements to participate in the 
study. Study consent briefings will be scheduled to occur in person and will not occur 
over the phone. Study briefings will occur in room 1101 William Johnston Building 
on the [LOCATION_012] State University campus or at a study team member's office. 
Prospective participants will be familiarized with the study procedures and informed 
verbally and in writing of their rights to withdraw from any part of the study without 
penalty or prejudice. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_353101]. 
No study procedures will occur before any volunteer has given their informed 
consent. After the volunteer has had the informed consent explained to them, they 
will have as much time as desired before signing. A copy of the informed consent 
document will be offered to the volunteer with the original kept for study 
documentation. Participants who have consented will be informed of any new 
information or changes to the protocol. Participants will be allowed to withdraw at 
any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled. 
An investigator may stop an individual’s participation in the study if the participant is 
unwilling or unable to complete study procedures or follow study instructions. An 
investigator may also withdraw a participant if the individual becomes ill or injured or 
if it would not be in the participant’s best interest to continue. If the participant is 
withdrawn by [CONTACT_353112], all further data 
collection will discontinue, but the data that was already collected will be included in 
the final analysis.

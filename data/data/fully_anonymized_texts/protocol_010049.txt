Sample Size 
Determination : 
 An approximate total of 60 subjects  will be enrolled .  Subje cts will be 
randomized into three  treatment groups in a ratio of Group 1 (5 mg twice 
daily): Group 2 (10 mg twice daily ): Group 3 (placebo  twice daily ) = 1: 1:1.  No 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_888338]. T he sample size is based  on the 
best medical judgment.  
 
The power to detect a difference between placebo and active treatment with 
respect to change from baseline in liver fat content and serum ALT has been 
determined for a sample size of 20 patients per arm to assess safety and 
potential efficacy.  Fat quantification by [CONTACT_888367] 
a 5% detectable change in fat quantification.  
 
Further, since the endpoint is the change from baseline, plausible estimates 
of the degree of correlation between pre -and post -baseline measurements 
will be  incorporated into the variance estimates.  Given the wide range of 
results observed in the literatu re, several “what -if” scenarios were examined.  
As such, the current sample size was considered sufficient for the 
exploratory objectives of the study for the given range of plausible treatment 
effects and variance estimates.  Du e to the exploratory object s of the 
protocol, no adjustment for the two co -primary endpoints was made.  
Additionally, there will be no adjustments for multiple comparisons between 
the 3 treatment groups.  
 
Assuming the  observed difference between two treatment groups is 20%, 
then th e 95% confidence interval for the true mean is given by (2.5%, 37.5%) 
with 20 subjects in each group.  
 
Fat Liver Content Change from Baseline:  
The current sample size of 20 subjects per group should yield approximately 
85% power to detect a treatment effe ct of at least  5% with respect to the 
difference in the mean change from baseline between one of the JKB-121 
treatment group s and placebo  
 
ALT change from Baseline:  
Patients will be stratified into treatment arms based on threshold of baseline 
elevation of ALT (i.e. ALT < 2x ULN and ALT ≥ [ADDRESS_1243285], but < [ADDRESS_1243286] ).  The 
current sample size of 20 subjects per group should yield approximately 73% 
power to detect a treatme nt effect of at least 30 U/L assuming a SE of 50 U/L 
(α= 0.05; two tailed; unpaired t -test).  The SD of 50 U/L for the change from 
baseline endpoint was derived assuming SDs of [ADDRESS_1243287] not been adjusted for multiple 
comparisons or multiple endpoints, dropouts or stratifications.  
 
The analysis of each primary endpoint will be based on a linear model that 
incorporates the baseline measures as a covariate, the stratification factor 
and randomization treatment group.  Pairwise comparisons of each active 
treatment group to control will be conducted vial linear contrasts.

Full Analysis Set  (FAS) for Efficacy:   includes all subjects who received at 
least one dose of study medication.  Only subjects with clear documentation 
that no study medication was received may be excluded.  In the event of 
allocation errors, subjects will be analyzed for  efficacy according to the 
treatment to which they were randomized.  
 
Safety Analysis Set:  includes all subjects who received at least one dose of 
study medication.  Only subjects with clear documentation that no study 
medication was received may be exclud ed.  In the event of treatment 
allocation errors, subjects will be analyzed for efficacy according to the 
treatment in which they were randomized.  
 
Per Protocol Analysis Set  includes all subjects who complete [ADDRESS_1243288] MRI and A LT measured at baseline and at week 
24 and no major protocol violations, determined prior to break of the 
treatment blind.  
 
All hypotheses will be tested for statistical significance with two -tailed p -
values. Results of all tests will be considered statis tically significant if their p -
value is less than or equal to 0.05,  except results of the tests for interaction 
will be considered statistically significant if the p -value is less than or equal to 
0.10 
 
Efficacy:  The primary e ndpoint of this study is the safety and potential efficacy of two 
dose levels of JKB -121 (5 mg twice daily and 10 mg twice daily) in reducing 
liver fat compared to placebo.   
The secondary endpoint of the study is the time to remission (TTR)  is defined 
as time in weeks from random ization to liver aminotransferase  remission as  
defined as two consecutive ALT values  within norma l range (< 20  U/L for 
women and < 30 U/L for men ) or a 20% reduction from the baseline during 
study period. A Cox proportional hazard model will be used to compare the 
TTR duration between treatment arms.  
Median duration of TTR and the hazard ratio with 95% confidence limits will 
be estimated using Kaplan -Meier survival methodology.  TTR from 
randomization will be compared using estimates fro m the Kaplan -Meier 
survival curves.  A detailed comparison of the treatment effects will be 
analyzed by [CONTACT_6486] a Cox proportional hazard model with baseline variables 
as covariates to assess the benefit -risk ratio.  
Safety:  The primary safety endpoints will be the rates of patients who experience (1) 
one or more AEs; (2) SAEs; and (3) AEs leading to discontinuation of study 
medication. Treatment effect will be explored by [CONTACT_888368]. Other 
safety parameters such as laboratory test, vital signs, and other safety 
related variables will be summarized regarding each scheduled visit. Shift 
tables will be presented for laboratory values based on the referen ce 
laboratory normal ranges.

   Page 15 of 60  3.0   BACKGROUND  
3.1 Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) 
The emerging epi[INVESTIGATOR_888340] (NASH) as what is now considered to be the leading 
cause of chronic liver disease in the Western World [ 1].   An estimated 25% of the industrialized 
world has hepatic steatosis and fatty liver, an entity that has been termed nonalcoholic fatty liver 
disease (NAFLD).  NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of liver pathology with different clinical 
prognoses.  The simple accumulation of triglyceride within hepatocytes (hepatic steatosis) is on 
the most clinically-benign extreme of the spectrum.  On the opposite, most clinically-ominous 
extreme, are cirrhosis and primary liver cancer.  The risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_888341], but increases as steatosis becomes 
complicated by [CONTACT_888369]-conspi[INVESTIGATOR_888342], i.e., nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH).  NASH affects approximately 20-25% of all NAFLD patient, which 
equates approximately 6.0% of the overall population [ 2].   NASH resembles alcoholic liver 
disease but occurs in people who drink little or no alcohol [ 3].   
Most subjects with NAFLD are asymptomatic. The diagnosis is often made when abnormal liver 
aminotransferases or features of fatty liver are noted during an evaluation performed for other 
reasons.   NAFLD may also be diagnosed during the work-up of vague right upper quadrant 
abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, or an abnormal appearing liver at time of abdominal surgery.   
The association of NAFLD with obesity, diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, and 
cardiovascular disease is well known.   NAFLD is an independent risk factor for metabolic 
syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus [ 4].  In addition, approximately 50-90% of patients with 
obesity may have NAFLD while 50% of patients with diabetes may have biopsy proven NASH 
and are at increased risk for progressive hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis [ 5, 6].   
The mechanisms underlying NAFLD pathogenesis and progression are not entirely clear.  The 
best-understood mechanisms pertain to hepatic steatosis.  Hepatic steatosis results when 
hepatocyte mechanisms for triglyceride synthesis (e.g., lipid uptake and de novo  lipogenesis) 
overwhelm mechanisms for triglyceride disposal (e.g., degradative metabolism and lipoprotein 
export), leading to accumulation of fat (i.e., triglyceride) within hepatocytes.  Obesity stimulates 
hepatocyte triglyceride accumulation by [CONTACT_888370].  Reduced intestinal barrier 
function increases hepatic exposure to gut-derived products which stimulate liver cells to 
generate inflammatory mediators that inhibit insulin action and cause oxidative or inflammatory 
stress.  Increased delivery of triglyceride precursors (e.g., fatty acids and diacylglycerols) and 
metabolic by-products (e.g., reactive oxygen species) may damage hepatocytes, leading to 
hepatocyte lipotoxicity.   Lipotoxicity also triggers the generation of other factors (e.g., 
inflammatory cytokines, hormonal mediators) that deregulate systems that normally maintain 
hepatocyte viability and result in progressive chronic liver injury. 
Weight reduction with diet and exercise is the only therapeutic strategy that has been shown to 
be beneficial in NASH.  Unfortunately, most patients are unable to achieve and maintain the 
required lifestyle change for any significant period of time.  Bariatric surgery is effective for 
JKB121         March 2, [ADDRESS_1243291] been used experimentally with some 
limited evidence of short term benefit; however, the benefits are not sustained.  Experimental 
approaches under clinical evaluation in patients with NASH include antioxidants, newer 
antidiabetic medications and antifibrotic agents. In two pi[INVESTIGATOR_4250], pentoxifylline [ 7, 8], which 
inhibits Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- ) production, was reported to show beneficial effects 
in improving aminotransferase levels, hepatic steatosis, fibrosis and necroinflammation among 
patients with NASH.  Currently, there are no FDA-approved treatments for NAFLD and NASH.  
3.2 Toll-Like Receptor 4   
Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR- 4) is a cell surface, type 1 trans-membrane protein that recognizes 
bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and endotoxins, among other ligands, a key mediator of the 
release of proinflammatory cytokines and inflammatory responses, and a member of TLR family 
which are mainstays of the innate immune system and best known for their role in host 
defenses against infections.  Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an endotoxin, is a specific agonist for 
TLR- 4. Activation of inflammatory signaling pathways is of central importance in the 
pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and NASH.  Recent studies demonstrated that 
Toll-like receptors, the sensors of microbial and endogenous danger signals, are expressed and 
activated in innate immune cells as well as in parenchymal liver cells involved in hepatic fibrosis 
(hepatic stellate cells and Kupffer cells) and thereby [CONTACT_888371] [ 9]. The 
importance of gut-derived endotoxin and its recognition by [CONTACT_422302]4 in the liver, the significance of 
TLR-induced intracellular signaling pathways and cytokine production as well as the contribution 
of TLR-[ADDRESS_1243292] for therapeutic target for the treatment of chronic liver disease 
[10].  
3.3 Obesity, Insulin resistance and TLR-4  
Chronic low-grade inflammation is a hallmark of obesity and thought to contribute to the 
development of obesity-related insulin resistance. TLR-4 is a key mediator of pro-inflammatory 
responses. Mice lacking TLR-4s are protected from diet-induced insulin resistance and 
inflammation.  Mice deficient in hepatocyte TLR-4 (TLT4KO) exhibit improved glucose 
tolerance, enhanced insulin sensitivity and ameliorated hepatic steatosis despi[INVESTIGATOR_888343] a high-fat diet (HFD) challenge [ 11]. Furthermore, TLR4KO mice 
have reduced macrophage content in white adipose tissue, as well as decreased tissue and 
circulating inflammatory markers. TLR4 are activated by [CONTACT_888372] (a 
marker of gut permeability), features of both obesity and metabolic syndrome, resulting in 
activation of nuclear factor-kappa beta (NFK-β) and increased release of inflammatory 
biomediators such as IL-6, IL-1 , TNF-α, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP- 1), which 
play a role in the pathophysiology of obesity and metabolic syndrome [ 12] 
Such data indicate that the activation of TLR-[ADDRESS_1243293] that targeting hepatocyte TLR-4 might be a 
useful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes [ 13].  Given the very strong 
JKB121         March 2, [ADDRESS_1243294] shown a close association between compositional changes in gut 
microbiota and the development of NAFLD [ 14, 15]. The change in gut microbiota may alter 
nutritional absorption and storage. In addition, gut microbiota are a source of TLR ligands, and 
their compositional change can also increase the amount of TLR ligands delivered to the liver. 
TLR ligands can stimulate liver cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines. Therefore, the gut-
liver axis has attracted much interest, particularly regarding the pathogenesis of NAFLD [ 16]. 
The abundance of the major gut microbiota, including Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, has been 
considered a potential underlying mechanism of obesity and NAFLD, but the role of these 
microbiota in NAFLD remains unknown [ 17].  Several reports have demonstrated that certain 
gut microbes are associated with the development of obesity and NAFLD. For instance, a 
decrease in Akkermansia muciniphila causes a thinner intestinal mucus layer and promotes gut 
permeability, which allows the leakage of bacterial components. Interventions to increase 
Akkermansia muciniphila improve the metabolic parameters in obesity and NAFLD.  In children, 
the levels of Escherichia were significantly increased in NASH  compared with those in obese 
control. Escherichia can produce ethanol, which promotes gut permeability [ 18]. Another 
possibility by [CONTACT_888373]-containing microbiota [ 19] and increased intestinal permeability to LPS [ 20].  
Bacterial LPS stimulates Kupffer cells and participates in the pathogenesis of hepatic 
fibrogenesis [ 21].  Thus, normalization of gut microbiota using probiotics or prebiotics is a 
promising treatment option for NAFLD.  In addition, TLR signaling in the liver is activated, and 
its downstream molecules, such as proinflammatory cytokines, are increased in NAFLD. T o 
date, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR9 have been shown to be associated with the pathogenesis 
of NAFLD. Therefore, gut microbiota and TLRs are targets for NAFLD treatment.   Thus, 
plausible evidence exists to support the use of a TLR-[ADDRESS_1243295] at the TLR- 4 receptor, thus reducing the likelihood of affecting 
the innate immune system.  It is an off-patent FDA-approved drug (as a non-selective opi[INVESTIGATOR_238310]) with no known safety issues.   
JKB- 121 has been shown to prevent the LPS induced inflammatory liver injury in a 
methionine/choline deficient (MCD) diet fed rat model of NAFLD [ 22].  In vitro, JKB- 121 
neutralized or reduced the LPS-induced release of IL-6 and IL-12 in murine macrophages, 
deactivated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), inhibited HSCs proliferation, collagen expression  and 
α-SMA expression in cultured HSCs (spontaneously activated) [ 23]. In vivo , JKB- 121 
neutralized the stimulated release of TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-18 by [CONTACT_162267]/D-Gal in mice.  Moreover, 
JKB- 121 also neutralized LPS-induced p38 phosphorylation and TNF- α in isolated rat Kupffer 
cells [22].   The data supports that JKB-121, a TLR4 antagonist, exhibits the potential for treating

6.2 Sponsor’s Termination of Study   
Although TaiwanJ Pharmaceuticals has the intention of completing the study, the company 
reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for clinical or administrative reasons. If ≥ 
30% of subjects received study treatments has a hepatic AE of > Grade 3 or a non-hepatic, 
drug-related AE of ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_1243301] who experiences an increase 
in ALT value greater than 3X baseline during the treatment period will be monitored weekly. If 
ALT values increase to greater than 5X the baseline ALT will be rechecked within 48 hours and 
if value remains > 5X baseline, the subject will be withdrawn from the study. The subject will 
then be followed, and ALT, AST, prothrombin time, and total bilirubin will be monitored every [ADDRESS_1243302]’s discontinuation of therapy has returned 
to the baseline value (Baseline for prothrombin time and total bilirubin is the value obtained at 
the screening). 
Other reasons for withdrawal from the study may include, but are not limited to the following: 
 Subject is in violation of the protocol, defined as refusal or inability to adhere to 
prescribed dosing and/or follow-up regimen. 
 Subject is lost to follow-up. 
 Subject experiences a serious or intolerable AE that, in the medical opi[INVESTIGATOR_53038], warrants discontinuation. 
 Subject has laboratory safety assessments that reveal clinically significant worsening 
from baseline values. 
 Subject develops, during the course of the study, symptoms or conditions listed in the 
exclusion criteria. 
 Subject requires a medication that is prohibited by [CONTACT_760]. 
 Investigator or TaiwanJ Pharmaceuticals requests an early discontinuation of the trial for 
any reason. 
 
The investigator may also withdraw a subject upon the request of TaiwanJ Pharmaceuticals or if 
TaiwanJ Pharmaceuticals terminates the study. Upon occurrence of a serious or intolerable AE, 
the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_888344]. If a subject is discontinued 
because of an AE, the event will be followed until it is resolved or until the principal investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_11637]-investigator deems the event to be chronic or the subject to be stable.

Subjects should be encouraged to complete all study procedures; however, all subjects are free 
to withdraw from the study at any time. Subject participation in the trial may be stopped at any 
time at the discretion of the investigator or at the request of TaiwanJ Pharmaceuticals .  
When a subject withdraws from the study, the reason(s) for withdrawal shall be recorded by [CONTACT_888374]. Whenever possible, 
all subjects who withdraw from the study prematurely will undergo all end- of-study (Visit 8) and 
follow-up (Visit 9) assessments. Subjects who fail to return for final assessments will be 
contact[CONTACT_160514]. Follow-up 
assessment for early withdrawals will be attempted through [ADDRESS_1243303] withdrawn because of an AE or serious adverse 
event (SAE). In any case, every effort must be made to undertake protocol-specified safety 
follow-up procedures. 
6.3.[ADDRESS_1243304] who fails a screening investigation 
may, at the discretion of the investigator, be re-tested, providing that they remain able to 
complete screening assessments within the protocol-specified screening period (up to 4 weeks). 
7.2. Assignment of Subjects Numbers 
Patients will be randomized in the order in which they are enrolled into this double-blind study 
by [CONTACT_2329] a computer-generated randomization schedule.  TaiwanJ Pharmaceuticals will prepare 
the schedule prior to the start of the study.  This number will designate which allocated

2. JKB- 121 5mg tablet twice daily 
3. JKB- 121 10mg tablet twice daily 
9.1.1 Investigational Drug 
JKB-121 is a tablet which contains nalmefene (as hydrochloride) in different strength of 5mg, 
10mg and with GRAS (generally recognized as safe) excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  The tablet is white to off white, 
round and plain biconvex tablet. 
9.1.2 Reference Drug:  
Placebo will be supplied as a similar appearing tablet which also contains lactose .  
9.2   Justification for the dose chosen   
JKB-121 is effective at a dose of 1 mg/kg in reducing elevated serum liver enzyme ALT in D-
G
al/LPS mouse model (Szabo et al.  Alcohol Clin Exp Res 2005) . Using the FDA guidelines 
(fda/cder/guidance/ 5541fnlcln1.doc  07/06/05, page 29), 1 mg/kg dose in mouse corresponds to 
6.[ADDRESS_1243311] 
one study in cholestatic pruritus patients lasted for over 26 months at 10 mg and higher twice 
daily, while maximal dose of 120 mg bid was given to 2 patients for 4 months. The daily 
administered doses in these trials were 2 to 12 times higher than the 5mg and 10 mg bid in 
proposed JKB-121 IND application (Refer to Investigational Brochure pages 15-17).

9.3   Rationale for a placebo group  
In order to assess the efficacy of an agent in NASH, a placebo-arm is needed to determine its 
relative efficacy in improving NASH histology beyond that achieved with a placebo [ 24]. 
Currently, there are no FDA approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_110234]. The recently completed PI[INVESTIGATOR_888345] [ 25] did not find either vitamin E or pi[INVESTIGATOR_888346]. The study 
demonstrated that 43% of vitamin E treated patients and 34% of pi[INVESTIGATOR_888347] a pre-determined histological endpoint compared to 19% of placebo treated patients (P = 
0.001 and P = 0.04 for each drug respectively) [ 25].  Previous non-randomized and pi[INVESTIGATOR_888348] [ 26] and betaine [ 27] in the 
treatment of NASH, but follow-up randomized, placebo controlled studies failed to show 
improvement in liver histology in patients with NASH beyond that observed in placebo groups. 
To have the highest quality of evidence to test our hypothesis, the proposed JKB- [ADDRESS_1243312] to other

9.4.2 Drug Preparation/Administration/Dispensing 
Each patient will receive one bottle of study medication at each visit during the treatment period.  
Bottles will contain single panel label. One part of the label, containing study and patient 
information is attached to the carton.  Directions on the bottles will indicate the following:  
• JKB- 121 is for oral use. 
• The tablet should be swallowed whole. 
• The tablet should not be divided or crushed because nalmefene may cause skin 
sensitivity when in direct contact [CONTACT_888377] [ADDRESS_1243313] be 
maintained.  A specific drug accountability form supplied by [CONTACT_888378], can be used to provide drug 
accountability information.  Drug compliance will be based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_692].  Paper diaries will be 
provided to subjects, reviewed at each visit, signed by [CONTACT_888379]. Other 
required data includes relevant dates, quantities, and patient identification (subject number and 
initials) for patients who receive study.  Patients will be instructed to return all unused study 
medication to the investigator, in the original bottles. 
At the end of the study, all unused products will be collected and counted by [CONTACT_888380].  
 
10. SCHEDULE OF EVENTS 
10.[ADDRESS_1243314] be performed prior to that day’s administration of study drug 
treatment. Subjects should undergo all tests and evaluations specified in the protocol, 
regardless of whether they remain on study drug. Insofar as possible, all blood samples should 
be collected at approximately the same time of day in each visit, in order to minimize diurnal 
variation 
The required procedures for patient evaluation at each study visit are outlined in the study. 
Schedule of Visits and Procedures are in Sections 10.2 and detail items in section 10.3 through

10.3.2 Screening Period (within 4 weeks before randomization) 
Prior to performing any study procedures, an informed consent form will be reviewed and signed 
by [CONTACT_6992].   Subjects will be screened within 4 weeks before starting study treatment to 
determine eligibility for participation in the study, unless otherwise noted below.  Subjects who 
fail to meet eligibility due to an abnormal laboratory results (other than what is otherwise 
explained by [CONTACT_888381]) may undergo retesting of the abnormal laboratory test during the 
screening window.  This will be done at the discretion of the investigator and with prior approval 
from the Sponsor or Medical Monitor.  
Sufficient time should be allowed for all screening laboratory studies to be resulted prior to 
scheduling subject for MRI testing.  The following will be performed and documented at 
screening:

Peripheral blood collection: Blood will be collected venipuncture.  Serum and plasma will be 
collected for assessing non-invasive biomarkers related to NAFLD / NASH as well as liver 
fibrosis (i.e. CK-18, adiponectin, leptin, TNF-α, TGF-β, hyaluronic acid, and MMP-2) .  MRI 
Procedures as detailed in Section 11 .3. 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI )  
The purpose of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exam is to quantify the hepatic proton 
density fat fraction non-invasively in participants who participate in the study.  The fat fraction is 
the proportion of mobile protons in liver tissue attributable to fat and thus is a non-invasive MR-
based assessment of liver triglyceride concentration. To quantify the fat fraction, the MRI exam 
will use a fast spoiled gradient recalled echo sequence that uses a low flip angle to reduce T1 
bias, acquires multiple echoes after a single excitation to measure and correct for T2*decay, 
and uses spectral modeling to address fat-water and fat-fat signal interference effects. The 
proposed MRI technique measures hepatic fat fraction accurately in human subjects at 1.5T or 
3T and across different vendors. The technique provides high within-examination and between-
examination precision. Linearity is maintained across the entire relevant biological range from 
<1% to >40% hepatic fat fraction. The technique is robust to minor variations in acquisition 
parameters, including those that may be encountered during usage in a clinical trial.  The echo 
sequence proposed for imaging-based hepatic fat fraction quantification can be implemented o n 
any up- to-date clinical scanner and thus can be used at any clinical centers with access to such 
a scanner. Moreover, the technique is imaging based and covers the whole liver, thus providing 
information on both the quantity and distribution of hepatic f at fraction. MRI is currently the most 
accurate noninvasive technique to quantify hepatic fat fraction. 
Percutaneous Liver Biopsy  
The purpose of the liver biopsy within 12 months of screening is to ensure the presence of 
NASH and the absence of cirrhosis prior to randomization.  The histologic features of liver injury 
(ie. necroinflammation, ballooned hepatocytes) and hepatic fibrosis is best assessed by [CONTACT_888386] “gold-standard” for grading and staging NASH.  The ideal target 
population “at risk” for disease progression, and thus, the appropriate cohort of subjects for 
investigational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_888353]. Due to the early phase of investigation and the interdeterminate safety of JKB-121 in 
patietns with cirrhosis, subjects with histologic features of cirrhosis (stage 4 fibrosis) and/or any 
history of hepatic decompensation attributable to cirrhosis will be excluded. The screening liver 
biopsy should be considered for patients with known history of NASH and for whom historical 
liver biopsy is in excess of 12 months.  Given the dynamic changes in NASH which may occur 
due to life-style changes alone and the reassurance of targeting patient with histologic features 
of NASH, only patients with biopsy-proven NASH within 12 months of screening will be enrolled.

prior to obtaining the subject’s consent to participate in the clinical trial, 
b) the condition requiring the pre-scheduled elective procedure or routinely scheduled 
treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress between the subject’s 
consent to participate in the clinical trial and the time of the procedure or treatment, and  
c)   the p re-scheduled elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment is the sole reason 
for admission and intervention.  
However, if complications occur during procedures or surgeries, they are considered to be 
adverse events and should be recorded. Any adverse event classified as serious must be 
reported immediately to the CRO via the electronic data capture (EDC) system. \.

subject uncomfortable; does not influence performance or functioning; prescription drug not 
ordinarily needed for relief of symptom(s) but may be given because of personality of 
subject. 
Grade 2  Moderate Adverse Event: symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to make subject 
uncomfortable; performance of daily activity is influenced; subject is able to continue in 
study; treatment for symptom(s) may be needed. 
Grade 3  Severe Adverse Event: symptom(s) cause severe discomfort; symptoms cause 
incapacitation or significant impact on subject’s daily life; severity may cause cessation of 
treatment with investigational drug; treatment for symptom(s) may be given and/or subject 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. 
Grade 4  Life-Threatening or Disabling Adverse Event: symptom(s) symptoms pose 
significant risk to life or risk of permanent disability.

The toxicity management will be based on DAIDS AE Grading system,  
Hepatic toxicity: 
ALL patients will have increased liver enzymes at baseline. Liver function tests will monitored 
with each visit.  For any elevated ALT 5-10.[ADDRESS_1243349] (Grade 3 or 4) on study drug , repeat testing 
and evaluation will be performed in 1 week. Treatment will be interrupted for drug-related Grade 
3 AE until their AE Grade is less than 3.  Liver function tests and assessment will be performed 
weekly to ensure resolution of Grade 3 AE.  Study drug may be resumed following confirmation 
of resolution of Grade 3 AE or if investigator confirms AE is keepi[INVESTIGATOR_888357]’s underlying 
NASH. The investigator must assess whether or not Grade 3 AE is clinically or not clinically 
significant in the setting of NASH and in reference to baseline ALT levels.  Increases in liver 
enzymes > [ADDRESS_1243350]’s baseline  will prompt retesting and patient examination within 1 week.  
Increases in liver enzymes > [ADDRESS_1243351]’s baseline will prompt immediate drug discontinuation

12.5 Emergency Procedures 
In the event of a medical emergency (i.e., an event that requires Taiwan’s immediate attention 
regarding the treatment of the subject, operation of the clinical study, and/or use of study drug), 
study site personnel will immediately contact [CONTACT_1689].  
The investigator will ensure that all study site personnel responsible for the subject’s medical 
care are familiar with the Medical Emergency Call number, its location and have access to it.  
Prior to the start of dosing at the site, the Clinical Monitor will review medical emergency call 
procedures with study personnel. 
12.5.[ADDRESS_1243371] is randomized into the study, his/her treatment assignment will be individually 
determined using IVRS/IWRS. This information will be kept in a secured fashion. 
In the event of a medical emergency when knowledge of the subject’s treatment assignment 
would influence the subject’s clinical care, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_888355]. Only under these circumstances will TaiwanJ and/or 
Medical Monitor authorize unbinding of the subject’s treatment assignment. 
If a subject’s treatment assignment is unblended for a medical emergency or for regulatory 
purposes, that subject must immediately and permanently discontinue treatment with study drug 
but should remain in the study and continue the protocol specified follow-up evaluations. 
If a subject’s treatment assignment is accidentally unblended, that subject should continue 
treatment with study drug and remain in the study. The data will be included in the intent- to-treat 
data set. 
The investigator must document the reasons for the unbinding in the subject’s CRF and is 
strongly encouraged not to divulge the subject’s treatment assignment to any individuals not 
directly involved in managing the medical emergency. 
13.  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
13.1 Sample Size Calculation 
The study will need to screen approximately 100 subjects to enroll 60 patients with biopsy-
proven NAFLD who meet the study inclusion / exclusion criteria.  With 20 subjects per treatment 
group, the study will not be powered for efficacy assessment between the two doses. Based on 
precision analysis, the proposed sample size will provide the maximum error (defined as the 
half-way of the width of the 95% confidence interval for the difference (change in liver-
biochemistry) between two doses (5 mg twice daily vs 10 mg twice daily dose) allowed.

confidence interval for the true mean is given by (2.5%, 37.5%) with 20 subjects in each group .  
13.2 General Statistical Methodology 
Prior to database lock, a final detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be available. Results, 
when available, will be summarized into tabulations, case listings, plots, and histograms for 
comparison. 
Three major study populations are planned, modified intent- to-treat (met) population, per 
protocol (PP), and safety populations.  
Baseline variables will be ascertained for conformity among all stratification factors.  All baseline 
analysis will be based on the met population. In the met population, the subjects will be counted 
in the treatment group to which they were randomized, as long as they received at least one 
dose of study medication and have at least one return visit.   
The safety analysis will be based on the safety population. In the safety population, subjects will 
be counted in the group in which they were treated.  To assess the robustness of the study 
outcomes, a sensitivity analysis will be performed on all pertinent major efficacy variables. The 
sensitivity analysis will include and exclude patients with major study deviations and early 
withdrawals to assess the impact on the study endpoints.  
The criteria may be amended prior to unbinding of the treatment assignment for the analysis of 
data. Reasons for changes may include study conduct changes, protocol amendments, or 
changes in the appropriateness of the criteria, which may be assessed based on review of 
blinded data. 
For all analyses, all missing values due to patient early termination from the study will be not 
imputed.    
For each patient, the Baseline values will be defined as those values recorded at Day 1 prior to 
dosing or Screening, as appropriate. 
All hypotheses will be tested for statistical significance with two-tailed p-values. Results of all 
tests will be considered statistically significant if their p-value is less than or equal to 0.05, 
except for results of the tests for interaction will be considered statistically significant if the p-
value is less than or equal to 0.10.  
13.2.1. Analysis of Continuous Variables 
Continuous variables will be summarized with descriptive statistics (i.e., sample size, mean, 
standard deviation, minimum, maximum, median, and quintiles). The continuous variables will 
be analyzed using a general linear model to test the treatment effect of the changes from pre- to 
post-treatment [ 29].

13.2.2. Analysis of Categorical Variables 
Categorical variables will be summarized with descriptive statistics (i.e., sample size, frequency 
counts, percentage, and 95% confidence interval) and will be analyzed with CMH test adjusting 
for tumor size  [30]. 
13.2.3. Analysis of Time- to-Event Variables  
Time to event variables (such as time to treatment success) will be assessed by [CONTACT_888394]. The cumulative portion of the time- to-event variables of each treatment group will be 
determined by [CONTACT_5263]-Meier estimates. Fisher's exact or chi-square test will be used to 
compare the portion of patients with the event occurring at different time intervals throughout the 
study period.  
When it is beneficial, a more precise comparison of the treatment effects will be analyzed by 
[CONTACT_6486] a Cox proportional hazard model to assess the benefit-risk ratio.   
13.4. Analyses 
13.4.1. Efficacy Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary endpoint of this study is assessment of safety and the change in hepatic steatosis 
as measured by [CONTACT_9268]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Secondary Efficacy Endpoint 
The secondary endpoints of this study are: 
 Time to remission ( TTR) is defined as time, in weeks, from randomization to liver 
function remission as defined as two consecutive ALT values within normal range (< 40 
IU/mL) during study period.   The Cox proportional hazard model with treatment and 
diabetes status as factors, will be used.  
 ALT changes from baseline. The statistical analysis will the same as the one 
used for the primary efficacy endpoint 
 Changes in metabolic markers and NASH related biomarkers 
13.4.2. Timing of Analyses 
 All endpoints will be analyzed at the time point when all subjects have completed the 
treatment program and at the time when all subjects have completed the study.

related variables will be summarized regarding each scheduled visit. Shift tables will be 
presented for laboratory values based on the central laboratory normal ranges.  
All abnormalities deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_888401]. The patients who have no laboratory results at the Screening or post-
Baseline visit will be excluded from the change from Baseline and shift table analyses. 
Treatment effect will be explored by [CONTACT_888402]. 
13.4.4. Sensitivity Analysis 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy variable will be conducted as described below to 
assess the robustness of the primary analysis results. In the sensitivity analysis, decreases in p-
values due to drops in power (decreasing sample sizes and increasing standard errors) will be 
distinguished from changes in the effect size. The criterion that defines substantial changes will 
be those changes that alter the effect parameter by [CONTACT_888403]. 
The sensitivity analysis will use the following algorithm: 
1. Subjects who are excluded from per protocol population and subjects who withdraw 
from the study at or after interim analysis will be considered as a responders or non-
responders at the end of the study according to their response status at the time of 
withdrawal. 
2. Subjects who drop out at the time are considered as non-responders at the time of 
withdrawal. Subjects who withdraw early, regardless of their final outcomes, will be 
considered as non-responders at the end of study 
3. Remaining patients assigned to treatment will be considered as responders at the end 
of study if the withdrawals occur at the end of the study and they are also responders

14. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
Monitoring visits to the trial site will be made periodically during the trial to ensure that all 
aspects of the protocol are followed. Source documents will be reviewed for verification of 
agreement with data on case report forms. The investigator/institution guarantees direct access 
to source documents by [CONTACT_888405]. 
The trial site may also be subject to review by [CONTACT_21980] (IRB)/independent 
ethics committee (IEC), to quality assurance audits performed by [CONTACT_888406] , 
and/or to inspection by [CONTACT_4708]. 
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.

  Page 49 of 60 8 It is the investigator's responsibility to ensure completion and to review and approve all case 
report forms. Case report forms must be signed by [CONTACT_093]. These signatures serve to 
attest that the information contained on the case report forms is true. 
At all times, the investigator has final responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of all 
clinical and laboratory data entered on the case report forms. Subject source documents are the 
physician's subject records maintained at the study site. In most cases, the source documents 
will be the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]'s or the physician's chart. In cases where the source documents are the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54602]'s chart, the information collected on the case report forms must match 
those charts. In some cases, a portion of the source documents for a given subject may be the 
case report forms. 
15.[ADDRESS_1243376] Retention 
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or TaiwanJ Pharmaceuticals the 
investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient 
information to link records, e.g., case report forms and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed 
informed consent forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_888359]. The records should be retained by [CONTACT_888407], whichever is longer. 
If the investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withdraws from the study, the study 
records may be transferred to an acceptable designee, such as another investigator, another 
institution, or to TaiwanJ Pharmaceuticals. The investigator must obtain TaiwanJ’s written 
permission before disposing of any records.  
 
16. ETHICS 
16.[ADDRESS_1243377] (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain approval of the trial protocol and subsequent 
protocol amendments, if applicable, from the IRB/IEC. All correspondence with the IRB/IEC 
should be retained in the Investigator File. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/IEC approvals should be forwarded to 
TaiwanJ Pharmaceuticals. 
The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/IEC approval is 
where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects. In that 
event, the investigator must notify the IRB/IEC and the local TaiwanJ Pharmaceutical site 
personnel (see protocol cover page) in writing within [ADDRESS_1243378] (or the subject’s acceptable 
representative) full and adequate verbal and written information regarding the objective and 
procedures of the trial and the possible risks involved. This information must be provided to the 
subject prior to undertaking any trial-related procedure.  
The subjects must be informed about their right to withdraw from the trial at any time. Written 
subject information (included as an appendix to the protocol) must be given to each subject 
before any trial-related procedure is undertaken. The written subject information must not be 
changed without prior approval by [CONTACT_888408]/IEC. Furthermore, it is 
the responsibility of the investigator to obtain signed informed consent or witnessed verbal 
consent according to applicable regulations , from all subjects, and a signature [CONTACT_888415], prior to undertaking any trial-related procedure.  
17. SPONSOR DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA 
TaiwanJ Pharmaceuticals reserves the right to discontinue the trial prior to inclusion of the 
intended number of subjects, but intends only to exercise this right for valid scientific or 
administrative reasons. After such a decision, the investigator must contact [CONTACT_888409] [ADDRESS_1243379] extent possible.

APPENDIX I: WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI  
Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects 
 
 
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964 and amended by 
[CONTACT_941]: 29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October [ADDRESS_1243381] WMA General Assembly, 
Washington DC, [LOCATION_003], October 2002 (Note of Clarification added) 55th WMA General 
Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 2004 (Note of Clarification added) 59th WMA General 
Assembly, Seoul, Republic of Korea, October 2008 64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, 
Brazil, October 2013  
 
Preamble  
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a 
statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including 
research on identifiable human material and data.  The Declaration is intended to be 
read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should be applied with 
consideration of all other relevant paragraphs.  
2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to 
physicians. The WMA encourages others who are involved in medical research involving 
human subjects to adopt these principles.  
 
General Principles  
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health 
of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical Ethics 
declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient's best interest when providing medical 
care.”  
4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health, well-being and rights 
of patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's 
knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty.  
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving 
human subjects.  
6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the 
causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and 
therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best proven 
interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, 
effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
7. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for all 
human subjects and protect their health and rights.  
JKB121                                                                                                                                    March 2, [ADDRESS_1243382], incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for treating and/or 
compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the research 
study. 
 
In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements for post-trial 
provisions.  
 
Research Ethics Committees  
23. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and 
approval to the concerned research ethics committee before the study begins. This 
committee must be transparent in its functioning, must be independent of the researcher, 
the sponsor and any other undue influence and must be duly qualified. It must take into 
consideration the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the research 
is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but thes e 
must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects 
set forth in this Declaration.  
 
The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must provide 
monitoring information to the committee, especially information about any serious adverse 
events. No amendment to the protocol may be made without consideration and approval by 
[CONTACT_942]. After the end of the study, the researchers must submit a final report to the 
committee containing a summary of the study’s findings and conclusions .  
 
  
JKB121                                                                                                                                    March 2, [ADDRESS_1243383]’s freely-given 
informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non-
written consent must be formally documented and witnessed. 
 
All medical research subjects should be given the option of being informed about the general 
outcome and results  of the study.  
 
27. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician must 
be particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the 
physician or may consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent must be 
sought by [CONTACT_54127].  
28. For a potential research subject who is incapable of giving informed consent, the 
physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. These 
individuals must not be included in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for 
them unless it is intended to promote the health of the group represented by [CONTACT_62386], the research cannot instead be performed with persons capable of providing 
informed consent, and the research entails only minimal risk and minimal burden.  
29. When a potential research subject who is deemed incapable of giving informed consent 
is able to give assent to decisions about participation in research, the physician must 
seek that assent in addition to the consent of the legally authorized representative. The 
potential subject’s dissent should be respected.  
30. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consen t, 
for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition 
JKB121                                                                                                                                    March 2, [ADDRESS_1243384] fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to the 
research. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to 
withdraw from the study must never adversely affect the patient-physician relationship.  
32. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as research on 
material or data contained in bio banks or similar repositories, physicians must seek 
informed consent for its collection, storage and/or reuse. There may be exceptional 
situations where consent would be impossible or impracticable to obtain for such 
research. In such situations the research may be done only after consideration and 
approval of a research ethics committee.  
 
Use of Placebo  
33. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested 
against those of the best proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances: 
 
Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable; or  
 
Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of any 
intervention less effective than the best proven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention is 
necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients who receive 
any intervention less effective than the best proven one, placebo, or no intervention will not 
be subject to additional risks of serious or irreversible harm as a result of not receiving the 
best proven intervention.  
 
Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option.  
 
Post-Trial Provisions  
34. In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country governments 
should make provisions for post-trial access for all participants who still need an 
intervention identified as beneficial in the trial. This information must also be disclosed to 
participants during the informed consent process.  
 
Research Registration and Publication and Dissemination of Results  
35. Every research study involving human subjects must be registered in a publicly 
accessible database before recruitment of the first subject.  
36. Researchers, authors, sponsors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with 
regard to the publication and dissemination of the results of research. Researchers have 
JKB121                                                                                                                                    March 2, [ADDRESS_1243385] been ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert 
advice, with informed consent from the patient or a legally authorized representative, 
may use an unproven intervention if in the physician's judgment it offers hope of saving 
life, re-establishing health or alleviating suffering. This intervention should 
subsequently be made the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and 
efficacy. In all cases, new information must be recorded and, where appropriate, made 
publicly available.

Histological Scoring System for Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease  
Components of NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) and Fibrosis Staging 
 
NAS Components (see scoring interpretation)  
Item Score  Extent  Definition and Comment  
Steatosis  0 <5% Refers to amount of surface area involved by 
[CONTACT_888412]; minimal steatosis (<5%) 
receives a score of 0 to avoid giving excess 
weight to biopsies with very little fatty change  
1 5-33%  
2 >33-66%  
3 >66%   
Lobular 
Inflammation  0 No foci  Acidophil bodies are not included in this 
assessment, nor is portal inflammation  
1 <2 foci/200x   
2 2-4 foci/200x   
3 >4 foci/200x   
Hepatocyte 
Ballooning  0 None   
1 Few balloon cells  The term "few" means rare but definite 
ballooned hepatocytes as well as cases that 
are diagnostically borderline  
2 Many cells/prominent 
ballooning  Most cases with prominent ballooning also 
had Mallory's hyalin, but Mallory's hyaline is 
not scored separately for the NAS  
Fibrosis Stage (Evaluated separately from NAS)  
Fibrosis  0 None   
1 Perisinusoidal or 
periportal   
1A Mild, zone 3, 
perisinusoidal  "delicate" fibrosis  
1B Moderate, zone 3, 
perisinusoidal  "dense" fibrosis  
1C Portal/periportal  This category is included to accommodate 
cases with portal and/or periportal fibrosis 
without accompanying 
pericellular/perisinusoidal fibrosis  
2 Perisinusoidal and 
portal/periportal   
3 Bridging fibrosis   
4 Cirrhosis   
Total NAS score represents the sum of scores for steatosis, lobular inflammation, and ballooning,  
and ranges from 0 -8. Diagnosis of NASH (or, alternatively, fatty liver not diagnostic of NASH) 
should be made first, then NAS is used to grade activity. In the reference study, NAS scores of 0 -2 
occurred in cases largely considered not diagnostic of NASH,  scores of 3 -4 were evenly divided 
among those considered not diagnostic, borderline, or positive for NASH. Scores of 5 -8 occurred in 
cases that were largely considered diagnostic of NASH

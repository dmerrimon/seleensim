Intervention The drug, device, therapy or process under investigation in a clinical study that 
is believed to have an effect on outcomes of interest in a study (e.g., health -
related quality of life, efficacy, safety and pharmacoeconomics). 
Investigational 
periodPeriod of time where major interests of protocol objectives are observed, and 
where the test drug or comparative drug (sometimes without randomization) is 
usually given to a subject, and continues until the last assessment after 
completing administration of the test drug or comparative drug.
Post investigational 
periodPeriod of time after the last assessment of the protocol. Follow -up obs ervations 
for sustained adverse events and/or survival are done in this period.
Randomization The process of assigning study subjects to treatment or control groups using an 
element of chance to determine assignments in order to reduce bias.
Screening A process of active consideration of potential subjects for enrollment in a 
study.
Screen failure Potential subject who did not meet [ADDRESS_117964] drug or comparative 
drug (sometimes without randomization) is given to a subject. 
Study period Period of time from the first site initiation date to the last site completing the 
study.
Variable Any entity that varies; any attribute, phenomenon or event that can have 
different qualitative or quantitative values.

The objectives of this study are to evaluate safety, tolerability including reactogenicity and 
immunogenicity in ad ult subj ects [ADDRESS_117965] of 3 different groups: Group 1 - Stage 1 PCV13 naïve subjects 
randomized within 3 sequential cohorts to ASP3772 or PCV13; Group 2 -Stage 2 PCV13 naïve 
subjects randomized within 3 sequential cohorts to ASP3772 or PCV13; and Group 3 -Stage 2 
subjects previously vaccinated with PCV13 tha t will receive PPSV23.  
To minimize the risk to subjects, a sentinel group of subjects (n =2; 1 ASP3772:1 PCV13) will be 
vaccinated in each cohort prior to initiating enrollment of the full cohort.  Safety data through day 7 
from sentinel subjects will be evaluated by [CONTACT_99470] (DEC) prior to enrolling 
the remainder of the cohort.  Safety data through day 7 from all subjects within a dose cohort will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_99470] (DEC) prior to escalating to the next do se cohort within 
the adult and within elderly subjects. Based on the safety data through [ADDRESS_117966] occurred that require additional observation in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].  The DEC membership may include representatives from Astellas
Medical Science, Pharmacovigilance and Statistics personnel, as well as external independent safety 
physician(s).  The external safety physician will be selected based on expertise in vaccine clinical 
studies and other considerations such as the disease a rea. A DEC charter will detail the roles, 
responsibilities and procedures for decision -making.
See the Schedule of Assessments for details on procedures performed at each study visit for each 
group.
Stage 1 Group 1:
Stage 1 of the phase 1/2 design is a ran domized, active -controlled, observer -blinded, dose -escalation 
study of the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the ASP3772 pneumococcal vaccine in adult 
subjects (18 to 64 years of age) compared with PCV13 with a 3:1 randomization (ASP3772: PCV13 ).  
After screening, subjects will be enrolled sequentially into 3 cohorts designated by [CONTACT_106330]3772 dose levels.  A single dose of ASP3772 will be administered as a 0.5 mL intramuscular

Version 2.1 Non substantial Amendment 2Study Design Overview (continued) :  
injection into the deltoid muscle of the right or left arm on day 1 at 1 of 3 dose levels: 1, 2 or 5 g of 
ASP3772 for cohorts 1, [ADDRESS_117967] dose of PCV13 on day 1.
After all subjects comple te dosing in Cohort 1 (low dose, 1 g of ASP3772 or PCV13), safety 
(including reactogenicity) and tolerability through [ADDRESS_117968] immunization will be assessed by [CONTACT_106331].  Assessments of safety and tolerability by [CONTACT_106332] e next dose 
group, Cohort 2 (2μg of ASP3772 or PCV13) and then Cohort 3 (5 μg of ASP3772 or PCV13), based 
on safety and tolerability data through [ADDRESS_117969] immunization .  Safety 
assessments for serious adverse events (SAEs) and medically attended adverse events (MAAEs) 
including potential immune- mediated medical conditions (PI[INVESTIGATOR_106279]), and new -onset chronic disease 
(NOCDs) will continue through day [ADDRESS_117970] immunization .  Data will be collected in an observer -
blinded manner (vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_106280]).  
Serum samples to measure immunoglobulin G (IgG) and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) will be 
collected prior to the first study immunization on day 1 and on day 30 postimmunization .  
Stage 2 Group 2:
Stage 2 of the study is a dose -finding (sequentially higher doses), active -controlled, observer -blinded 
study with 3:1 rand omization (ASP3772: PCV13 ) in elderly subjects 65 to 85 years of age.
After screening, PCV13 naïve subjects will be randomized within each cohort to receive ASP3772 or 
PCV13.  Subjects randomized to ASP3772 will receive a single dose of ASP3772 administered as a 
0.5 mL intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the right or left arm on day 1, at 1 of 3 dose 
levels: 1, 2 or 5 g of ASP3772 for Cohorts 4, [ADDRESS_117971] dose of PCV13. 
Approximately 396 subjects will be enrolled in Stage 2 of the study; 132 subjects per cohort 
(ASP3772 n = 99 and PCV13 n = 33).
Stage 2 will commence after the DEC has evaluated safety (including reactogenicity) data through 
30days from all cohorts in Stage 1.  Dose escalation to Cohort 5 (intermediate dose, 2 g) in Stage 2 
will commence once the DEC has evaluated Stage 2 Cohort 4 (1 g) safety (including reactogenicity) 
and tolerability through [ADDRESS_117972] immunization.  Dose escala tion into Cohort 6 (high dose, 5 g) in 
Stage 2 will commence once the DEC has evaluated Stage 2 Cohort 5.  Randomization for Stage 2 
subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (65 to 74 years of age and 75 to 85years of age) to ensure there is a 
balanced number of subjects immunized with PCV13 and ASP3772 with immunogenicity data across 
the elderly population.
Safety and tolerability assessments including adverse events (AEs) will continue through [ADDRESS_117973] immunization .
Data will be collected in an observer -blinded manner (vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_106281]).  
Serum samples to measure IgG and OPA will be collected prior to study immunization on day 1 and 
postimmunization on day 30. 
Primary immunogenicity evaluation for dose finding is 30 days following the initial immunization .  
Stage 2 Group 3:
A sepa rate group of elderly subjects previously immunized with PCV13 will be enrolled and receive 
the recommended booster immunization with PPSV23 only (n =99) (Group 3) .

Statistical Methods: 
Sample Size Justification 
The sample size in Stage 1 is considered sufficient to obtain preliminary estimates in a phase 1 study 
of safety and reactogenicity in the adult population, ages 18 to 64. 
In Stage 2, approximately 495 evaluable adult subjects from 65 to 85 years of age are planned to be 
enrolled. For each PCV13 serotype, the OPA titer-1responses (geometric mean titer [GMT] and 
geometric standard deviation [GSD]) in subjects 60 to 64 years of age administered PCV13 (Sou rce 
Prevnar13®label) were assumed to be representative of the response following immunization with 
ASP3772. The width of 95% confidence intervals for each serotype with 30, 100 and 150 subjects 
were calculated. A sample size of 100 subjects treated with A SP3772 under these assumptions was 
considered sufficient to provide good estimates of OPA titer-1responses.
Analysis of Safety and Tolerability
Stage 1 and Stage 2 (Group 2):
Safety analyses will be performed on the safety population; all subjects who receive study 
immunization. Data from PCV13 subjects in each cohort will be pooled for comparison with the 
ASP3772 groups.  For each immunization arm, the frequencies and percentages will be displayed for 
the following TEAEs (coded using the Medical Dictio nary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA]) by 
[CONTACT_6657]:
Overall
Serious
Related (yes or no) to study vaccine
Descriptive statistics for each laboratory test (e.g., hematology, biochemistry and urinalysis) and vital 
signs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_106343], dose level for ASP3772 and scheduled time point.  
MAAEs, if any, will be summarized. 
For each local and systemic solicited reaction the percentage of subjects who reported each symptom 
by [CONTACT_479] (None, Grade 1, 2, 3 or 4) w ill be summarized (n, %) by [CONTACT_106343] (PCV13 vs 
ASP3772) and dose level (ASP3772: 1, 2, 5 µg) and the percentage of subjects who reported any 
symptom.

Version 2.1 Nons ubstantial Amendment 21 INTRODUCTION
Streptococcus (S.) pneumoniae is a significant cause of morbidity  and mortality  among infants, 
young children, the elderly  and individuals who have certain underlying medical conditions.  
S.pneumoniae remains a leading cause of serious illness, including bacteremia, m eningitis and 
pneumonia among children and adults worldwide.  I t is also the most frequent cause of sinusitis 
and acute otitis media [CDC, 2010].  Pneumococcal disease can cause both invasive and 
noninvasive disease.  The most common form of noninvasive di sease, nonbacteremic 
pneumococcal pneumonia, remains one of the most frequent disease manifestation accounting for 
pneumonia hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  I nvasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is defined as S.pneumoniae
isolated from a normall y sterile site (e.g., cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872], blood, joint fluid, pleural fluid or 
peritoneal fluid).  The highest incidence of I PD is found at the extremes of age –in elderl y adults 
and in y oung children < 2 y ears of age.  S.pneumon iaecauses approximately  [ZIP_CODE] cases of 
invasive disease each year among children younger than 5 years of age, including 700 cases of 
meningitis and 200 deaths [CDC, 2000].  The highest morbidity  and mortality  rates have been 
reported in developi[INVESTIGATOR_106294], but the disease burden is also considerable in industrialized 
countries.
Two different vaccines for S. pneumoniae are currently  available in the US.  PCV13, a 13 -valent 
conjugate vaccine, has been approved for the prevention of I PD caused by  [CONTACT_941] 13 serotypes 
contained in the vaccine in children and for the prevention of pneumonia and I PD in adults. In 
this vaccine, conjugation of pneumococcal saccharides to the CRM197 protein creates a 
saccharide -protein complex, which is capable of inducing a T -depende nt immune response; thus, 
T helper cells are stimulated, leading to a substantial primary  response and a strong booster 
response at re -exposure [PREVNAR 13 prescribing information, 2017].  However, there are 
> [ADDRESS_118004] seroty pe 3, as its 
prevalence persists in the population [Richter et al, 2014].
The second vaccine, Pneumova x®23 (PPSV23), is a 23- valent pol ysaccharide (PS) vaccine and is 
indicated for the prevention of pneumococcal disease in adults ≥ 50 y ears of age or in persons 
≥ 2years of age at increased risk of pneumococcal disease.  It is composed of purified capsular
PS from [ADDRESS_118005] the emerging seroty pes 35B, 23A and 
23B.  In addition, PPSV23 elicits a T- independent PS immune response that stimulates mature B-
lymphocy tes, but not T -lymphocy tes, and induces an immune response that is neither long -lasting 
nor anamnestic upon subsequent challenge.  In addition, PS -type vaccines are not used in infants 
and children < 2 years of age, because these children respond poorl y to T -independent antigens 
[Pneumovax 23 prescribing information, 2017; CDC, 2010].  Data suggest that PPSV23 protects 
adults and the elderl y against I PD; however, no consistent effect has been observed in the 
prevention of pn eumonia [Gruber et al, 2008].
Sponsor: APGD ISN/Protocol 3772-CL-[ADDRESS_118006] range of serotypes of S. pneumoniae .  
Background
ASP3772 is an investigational vaccine that contains 24 serotypes of S. pneumoniae and a unique 
carrier protein (CP1) created by [CONTACT_106345] 2 pneumococcal proteins (SP1500 and SP0785), which has the potential to induce a T- and B-cell response providing extended protection (refer to details in the [ASP3772 Investigator’s Brochure]). This novel pneumococcal vaccine is based on multivalent multiple antigen-presenting system (MAPS) platform containing each of the 13 pneumococcal capsular PS contained in PCV13 (serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F) and 11 additional pneumococcal capsular PS (serotypes 2, 8, 9N, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 17F, 20B, 22F and 33F), individually biotinylated and complexed with a CP1 carrier protein.  In nonclinical studies, MAPS vaccines have also been shown to induce antigen-specific Th1/Th17 responses, which efficiently protect against pneumococcal disease [Zhang et al, 2013].
The MAPS platform takes advantage of the high affinity (dissociation constant 
[KD]≈10
-15M) noncovalent binding between biotin and rhizavidin, a biotin-binding protein, 
which has no significant predicted homology with human proteins.  Rhizavidin, a naturally occurring dimeric protein in the avidin protein family, was first discovered in Rhizobium etli , 
a symbiotic bacterium of the common bean.  Rhizavidin has only a 22% amino acid identity with chicken avidin, a protein commonly found in eggs, but with high conservation of amino acid residues involved in biotin binding.  No cross-reactivity to rhizavidin was observed in human serum samples obtained from subjects exposed to avidin [Helppolainen et al, 2007], suggesting that rhizavidin antibodies may not cross-react with chicken avidin.  Biotin conjugates have been used in several clinical applications without any reported adverse events (AEs) [Buller et al, 2014; Paty et al, 2010; Lazzeri et al, 2004].  The biotinylation of the PS and MAPS complexing process in ASP3772 has been optimized to consistently show no free biotin, thus reducing the potential for generating anti-biotin antibodies.
The total amount of aluminum per dose in ASP3772 vaccine formulation is expected to be 
0.625 mg, which is below the FDA/WHO maximum recommended dose of 0.85 mg to 1.25 mg.

Nonclinical and Clinical Data
The nonclinical pharmacology data demonstrated that ASP3772 is highly  immunogenic in 
New Zealand White rabbits.  The literature reported for conjugated pneumococcal vaccines 
suggests that an immunogenic response el icited in nonclinical programs is translatable to an 
immunogenic response in humans.  The successful translation between the rabbit 
immunogenicity studies and human efficacy observed for conjugated pneumococcal vaccines
supports the position that ASP3772 h
as the potential to be clinically effective. There were no 
treatment -related effects on survival, clinical signs, skin reaction, bod y weight/food 
consumption, ophthalmology , hematology  parameters, serum biotin, anti-biotin antibodies or 
organ weights.  With the exception of the injection sites, there were no treatment -related 
macroscopic post- mortem or histopathological findings in the tissues/organs examined.  
Analy sis of post -dose sera confirmed that animals treated with ASP3772 had robust serum 
immuno globulin G (IgG) antibody responses to all pneumococcal polysaccharides included 
in the ASP3772.
In the pharmacology  studies, intramuscular administration of ASP3772 in rabbits resulted in 
a higher immune response (antibod y production) in the ASP3772 group in comparison to the 
PCV13 group not only  for a majorit y of the PCV13 serotypes, but also for non -PCV13 
seroty pes contained in ASP3772.  Antibody  responses to the pneumococcal proteins were 
also robust in the ASP3772 group compared to the levels seen in t he PCV13 group in rabbits.
Intranasal administration with either purified pneumococcal proteins (components of carrier 
protein) in mice induced a strong antigen -specific Th17 response and a significant reduction in 
pneumococci colony -forming units recove red from the nasophary ngeal wash following 
challenge with t ype 6B pneumococci (603 strain).  Similar responses were observed in 
subcutaneous i mmunization of [ADDRESS_118007] 
pneumococcal infection following immunization.  
Please refer to the current I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) for the most recent data.
Summary of Key Safety Information for Study Drugs
No clinical studies of ASP3772 have been conducted to date.
In the 5 -cycle intramuscular dose toxicity  study  in rabbits (3772 -TX-0001), a total of 
5intramuscular injections of ASP3772 at dose level of 5 µg of each PS per animal given once 
every  2 weeks to male and female New Zealand White rabbits over a period of 57 days was 
well-tolerated.  There were no treatment -related effects on survival, clinical signs, skin reaction, 
body  weight/food consumption, ophthalmology , hematology  parameters, serum biotin, anti -
biotin antibodies or organ weights.  With the exception of the injection sites, there were no 
treatment -related macroscopic post -mortem or histopathological findings in the tissues/organs 
examined.  Analy sis of postdose sera confirmed that animals treated with AS P3772 had robust 
serum IgG antibod y responses to all pneumococcal PS included in the ASP3772.

Version 2.1 Nons ubstantial Amendment 2In animals treated with ASP3772, slightly  elevated body  temperature, changes in clinical 
pathology  and histopathological findings at the injection sites were obse rved.  The elevated 
body  temperature and changes in clinical pathology  such as reductions in prothrombin time 
and/or activated partial thromboplastin time, as well as increased fibrinogen concentrations, 
and decreased albumin and albumin/globulin ratio, an d increased globulin, creatine kinase 
and C -reactive protein levels were considered to be consistent with the immune and/or 
inflammatory  reactions induced by  [CONTACT_106346]3772 administration, which are expected responses in 
intramuscular immunization.  
Microscopic findings at the intramuscular injection sites included ASP3772- related findings 
consisting of minimal to moderate m yofiber degeneration/necrosis, minimal to mild histiocy
tic 
inflammation (muscle) and minimal histiocy tic inflammation (subcutis), as well as ASP3772 -
related exacerbation of local injection site findings that included minimal to moderate mixed 
cell inflammation (subcutis), minimal to marked mixed cell inflammation (muscle), minimal to 
mild mixed cell inflammation (dermis), minimal to moderate hemorrhage (subcutis), minimal to 
mild hemorrhage (muscle) and minimal serocellular crusts (epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196]).  These changes 
recovered or tended to recover after a 4- week recovery  period suggesting that the ASP3772 -
related findings were reversible.  
In clinical studies, measurement of bod y temperature, monitoring of subjective symptoms 
such as pain and soreness, observation of injection sites, evaluation of clinical pathology 
parameters including coagulation, clinical chemistry and C -reactive protein w ill be monitored 
[Table 4].

Risk  Benefit Assessment
Subjects participating in this clinical study  may  not benefit from administration of ASP3772. 
In contrast, subjects might exp erience AEs related to study  vaccines (e.g., allergic reactions) 
or procedural complications (e.g., blood draws or slight skin irritation from the adhesive on 
the electrocardiogram [ECG] electrodes).  
A summary  of the nonclinical safet y findings and risk minimization and characterization 
actions are given in Table 4. Overall, the toxicological target organs and AEs that were 
identified in the nonclinical toxicology  studies will be carefully  monitored so that subjects 
will not be exposed to undue risks. However, since this is the first study  of this vaccine in 
humans, the risk profile in humans is unknown.

2.2.2 Dose Rationale
The proposed initial doses of 1, 2 and 5 g for this FIH clinical study  were chosen based on 
the PS levels contained in marketed PS conjugate vaccines and the ASP3772 nonclinical 
pharmacology  and toxicology  studies.
The 3 currently  licensed pneumococcal conjugated vaccines vary  in the number of serot ypes 
they contain, the carrier proteins used and the methods of conjugatio n employ ed.  The 
7-valent formulation ([COMPANY_007]’s Prevnar 7/Prevnar 7) with all seroty pes conjugated to 
diphtheria toxoid mutant (CRM197), using a reductive animation conjugation method, was 
first licensed in the year 2000.  The 10 -valent formulation (GlaxoS mithKline Biologicals’ 
Synflorix), with 8 serotypes conjugated to Protein D, a recombinant non -lipi[INVESTIGATOR_106297] a 
highl y conserved 40 kDa cell -
surface lipoprotein of non- typeable Haemophilus influenzae, 
seroty pe 18C conjugated to tetanus toxoid and seroty pe 19F conjugated to diphtheria toxoid 
via bifunctional spacer, was licensed in Europe in 2009.  The 13-valent formulation ([COMPANY_007]’s 
PCV13/PCV13), with all seroty pes conjugated to CRM197 using reductive animation, was 
licensed in 2010.  In addition, [COMPANY_006] initiated the development of a 15 -valent formulation 
(V114), using the PS dose ranges used previousl y by [CONTACT_106350] y available 
pneumococcal conjugated vaccines.  
In all of these cases, the P S doses ranged from 1 µg to 
4.4µg for each of the seroty pes.  A nonclinical immunogenicit y stud y with ASP3772 and 
PCV13 at one -tenth of the human PCV13 dose for each PS showed that ASP3772 
Sponsor: APGD ISN/Protocol 3772- CL-[ADDRESS_118019] response elicited in rabbit for ASP3772 and no response for PCV13. I n the toxicology  
study  in New Zealand White rabbits, ASP3772 was adminis tered at 5 μg of each of the 24 PS 
every  2 weeks, for a t otal of 5 intramuscular injections (5 cy cles). The findings were mild in 
nature, and monitorable and reversible.
The above information, coupled with the literature showing successful translation between 
the rabbit immunogenicity studies and human efficacy for pneumococcal vaccines, support 
the position that ASP3772 has the potential to be clinically  effective at the proposed doses 
(1μg, 2 μg and 5 μg).

Blinding
4.4.1 Blinding Method
This is an observer -blind study  since the comparator has a unique s yringe that the sponsor 
cannot duplicate.  Subjects will be randomized at a 3:1 ratio (ASP3772:comparator vaccine 
PCV13) in a blinded fashion such that the investigator, clinical staff, nor the subject will 
know whi ch agent is being administered.  Onl y the pharmacist and designated staff, including 
the person(s) injecting the vaccine will be unblinded to study vaccine.  The syringes will be 
masked prior to dosing to maintain the blind for subjects and all other perso nnel.  The details 
regarding stud y blinding will be described in the pharmacy manual.  The randomization 
number will be assigned based on information obtained from the IRT.  The study  will be 
unblinded to the investigator after the database lock.

(i.e., a SAE, an AE of severe intensit y, or 2 or more subjects experience a rea ctogenicity  
event of grade 3 or higher intensity ), the stud y vaccine assignment for these subjects will be 
revealed to determine if these events are related to ASP3772.  I f 10% or more of the subjects 
within a cohort experience the same or related AE, the study  vaccine assignment for those 
subjects will be revealed to determine if there is an imbalance in unsolicited AEs between 
ASP3772 and PCV13.  The DEC can request the study  vaccine assignment for 1 or more 
subjects.

Assignment and Allocation
At the Screening Visit, after the informed consent form (ICF) has been signed, site staff will 
access the IRT s ystem, enter the subject’s required information, and the subject will receive a 
subject number assignment through the IRT for use throughout the study. 
Each cohort will be initiated with randomization of [ADDRESS_118037] of the cohort. Subjects in the full 
cohort who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio 
(ASP3772:PCV13) according to the randomization schedules through IRT.  I n Stage 2, the 
randomization to stud y vaccine assignment will be stratified b y age.  Prior to study  
immunization, the site staff will access the IRT s ystem in order to determine the randoml y 
assigned stud y vaccine.  The site personnel will dispense the stud y vaccine according to the 
IRT s ystem’s assignment.  Specific procedures for randomization through the I RT are 
contained in the study  procedures manual.
Subjects who subsequently  meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomly  assigned to 
receive either ASP3772 or PCV13. The randomiz ation to study  vaccine will be stratified by  [CONTACT_654].
The I RT vendor will generate the randomization schedule. To obtain the randomized study  
vaccine assignment for a subject, the pharmacist or designee will utilize an IRT s ystem, 
which is available [ADDRESS_118038] 
and designated staff (i.e., the blind mus t be maintained as it is with all other subjects).

Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_106299] [Section 5.1.5 Criteria for 
Continuation of I mmunizat ion].
5.1.3 Previous and Concomitant Treatment (Medication and NonMedication 
Therapy)
Subjects will not be allowed to take immunization s, blood product, immunosuppressants 
including s ystemic steroids (topi[INVESTIGATOR_106282]) from first study vaccine 
administration until [ADDRESS_118044] immunization . Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory  drugs (NSAIDs) are allowed during the study , but not within 24 hours 
prior to immunization and collection of serum samples for immunogenicity.  Subjects who 
are taking concomitant medications (3 months prior to study  enrollment) to treat pre -existing 
conditions (e.g., h ypertension) must remain on stable doses of these medications throughout 
the study .  The doses of all concomitant medications should remain stable throughout the 
study , but may  be changed for medical reasons as determined b y the clinical investigator.
If during the stud y, a subject’s health condition necessitates the use of an y medication from 
those listed above, the investigator and medical monitor or designee(s), will discuss the case 
and determine if the subject should be withdrawn from the study.  The excluded concomitant 
medicatio n will be recorded as a protocol deviation.  All concomitant medication including 
prescription and nonprescription, vitamins and natural and herbal remedies (e.g., St.John’s 
Wort) will be documented.
Use of systemicall y absorbed antibiotics during the 30 -day period prior to collection of the 
immunogenicit y samples should be restricted unless clinically warranted (e.g., avoid 
prophy laxis) to avoid interference with the immunoassay . If a subject has been treated with 
any systemically  absorbed antibiotics bet
ween day [ADDRESS_118045] dose of the antibiotics.
Subjects may  receive other routine immunization at the 30- day follow -up visit after the 
completion of all study  procedures at each site’s discretion; however, routine vaccines should 
not be given in less than 30 days after study  immunization .

Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
5.2.1 Demographics
Demographic information will be collected for all subjects (where permitted) at the screening 
visit and will include age, date of birth, sex, race and ethnicity.
5.2.2 Medical History
Medical history will be collected at the screening visit in order to assess Inclusion/Exclusion 
criteria and will be reconfirmed prior to study immunization (if screening was performed > 7 days from study immunization [day 1]). 
Immunogenicity Assessments
The immunogenicity assessments described below are accepted surrogates for efficacy in pneumococcal vaccine studies.
5.3.1 Immunological Response
Considering its mechanism of action, ASP3772 is expected to induce the immune response to 
pneumococcal PS and carrier proteins, the antigens present in ASP3772.  Blood samples to assess immunogenicity will be collected as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments [Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3]. Immunogenicity assessments will be performed from blood samples collected at the dosing visit (day 1) prior to study immunization and at the 7-day and30-day follow-up visits.  Immunogenicity data will be provided to the investigative site when available.
Immunogenicity of ASP3772 will be evaluated by [CONTACT_106360]-specific anticapsular 
IgG antibody concentrations by [CONTACT_106361] [ADDRESS_118051] the pneumococcal serotypes. In addition, pneumococcal carrier protein (SP1500[PHONE_2435])-specific immune response will be assessed by [CONTACT_106362]-vaccine serotypes.

5.4.2 Vital Signs
Vital signs (bod y temperature, blood pressu re and pulse rate) will be measured at screening, 
the dosing visit (day  1) and at each subsequent visit (day  7 and day  30 [all groups]). On day  1, 
vital signs (bod y temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]) will be collected 
pre-dose an d [ADDRESS_118052] ion for safety  evaluation. 
Subjects may  be discharged after 60 minutes at the discretion of the investigator.  Local and 
systemic reactogenicity  will also be reported for each of 7 consecutive day s following the 
study  injection. 
Reactogenicit y will be ass essed using solicited adverse reactions from the time of 
immunization (day 1) up to [ADDRESS_118053] immunization.  These include local and sy stemic 
reactions with a protocol -specified predefined grading scale (see [Appendix 12.6 Grading of 
Local Reactogenicity ; Appendix 12.7 Grading of Signs of Sys temic Reactogenicity ; and 
Appendix 12.8 Grading of Laboratory  Abnormalities]).  L ocal reactions are pain, tenderness, 
redness/ery thema and swelling /induration.  Sy stemic reactions are nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, 
headache, fever, fatigue , joint pain or arthralgia and muscle discomfort or pain/my algia.  The 
daily  maximum measurement of local and s ystemic reactogenicit y signs will be recorded b y

Laboratory assessments will be performed at the screening visit and at study  immunization (if 
screening was performed >
7days from study  immunization [day 1]). Assessments will be 
repeated at follow -up visits on day  7 and day  30. See [Appendix 
12.5 Laboratory  Assessments] 
for details of laboratory  tests.
Clinical significance of out-of- range laboratory  findings is to be determined and documented 
by [CONTACT_093]/subinvestigator who is a qualified phy sician.
5.4.5 Anti -biotin Antibodies
Anti
-biotin antibodies will be measured from serum samples on day  1 prior to study  
immunization and at day  30 follow -up visit for Group 1 and Group 2 subjects. Serum anti- biotin 
antibodies will be rep eated on day  180 if tested positive on day  30.  In subjects with positive 
serum anti -biotin antibodies, serum biotin levels will be measured in the same sample. 
5.4.6 Physical Examination
A phy sical examination consisting of an examination of general appearance , eyes, nose 
throat, neck (including thy roid), l ymph nodes, chest, lungs, cardiovascular, abdomen, skin, 
extremities, musculoskeletal and neurological s ystem including mental status will be 
conducted at the screening visit, prior to study  immunization (day 1) and at the day  30 
follow -up visit. A sy mptom -directed ph ysical exam may  be performed at any  other time, if 
necessary .  The screening ph ysical examination also includes evaluation of significant, 
ongoing medical conditions. Any  changes between screening and randomization will be 
captured in the medical/surgical history.
Any abnormal finding(s) at screening must not be exclusionary  per the eligibility  criteria and 
must be assessed and documented as not clinicall y significant if a subject is to be enrolled in 
the study . After receiving the study  vaccine, new abnormal findings or a worsening of an 
ongoing abnormal condition will be recorded as an SAE or AE ([S]AE).
5.4.[ADDRESS_118056] management b y the Investigator.
A 12 -lead, resting ECG is to be recorded at each timepoint as indicated in Table 1, Table 2
and Table 3(Schedule of Assessments). Subjects s hould remain supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] 5 minutes 
prior to all ECGs. Dates and times may  be generated by  [CONTACT_101488]’s internal clock and are 
considered source data. The results are to be interpreted b y qualified personnel in real time 
for the management of the s ubjects’ clinical condition. The principal investigator/designee 
will initial and date, and provide his/her clinical interpretation on each report. The results 
(normal, abnormal not clinically  significant, abnormal clinically  significant) are to be 
recorde d in the electronic case report forms (eCRFs).
The ECG recorded during screening will be used to determine eligibility  for study  
participation. Subjects who have a clinically  significant abnormal ECG will not be eligible

can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporall y associated with the use of a 
medicinal product whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
In order to identify  any events that may  be associated with study  procedures and could lead to 
a change in the conduct of the study , Astellas collects AEs even if the subject has not 
received study  product. AE collection begins after the signing of the I CF and will be 
collected until [ADDRESS_118058] is determine d to be a 
screen failure.
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
non
-leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about 
AEoccurrences.
An abnormality  identified during a medical test (e.g., laboratory  parameter, vital sign, ECG 
data, ph ysical exam) should be identified as an AE only  if the abnormality meets 1 of the 
following criteria:
●Induces clinical sign or symptoms
●Requires active intervention
●Requires interruption or discontinuation of study  medication
●The abnormalit y or investigational value is clinically significant in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070].
MAAEs are AEs for which the subject has received medical attention by [CONTACT_80348], 
or in an emergency  room, or which led to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. For each reported AE, the 
investigator will ask the subject if such medical attention has been received. I n addition, the 
investigator will assess each MAAE if it constitutes a new -onset chronic disease (NOCD), 
defined as a MA AE which a) was absent at baseline, b) is not resolved at the follow -up 
telephone call, c) requires continuous medical care or attention. The investigator will also 
assess if an y MAAE constitutes a PI [INVESTIGATOR_106286]. PI [INVESTIGATOR_106303] y AEs of autoimmune 
Sponsor: APGD ISN/Protocol 3772- CL-[ADDRESS_118059] MAAEs, NOCDs and PI [INVESTIGATOR_106304]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Findings
Any abnormal laboratory test result (e.g., hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinal ysis) or 
other safet y assessment (e.g., ECGs, radio graphic scans, vital signs measurements, phy sical 
examination), including those that worsen from baseline, that is considered to be clinically  
significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator and not related to 
underly ing disease, is to be reported as an unsolicited (S)AE.
Any clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  finding or other abnormal safet y assessment, 
which is associated with the underl ying disease does not require reporting as an (S)AE, 
unless judged b y the investigator to be more severe than expected for the subject’s condition.
Repeating an abnormal laboratory  test or other safety assessment, in the absence of any  of the 
above criteria, does not constitute an AE.  Any  abnormal test result that is determined to be 
an error does not require reporting as an AE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury
Refer to [Appendix 12.5 Liver Safet y Monitoring and Assessment] for detailed instructions 
on drug- induced liver injury . Abnormal values in aspartate transaminase (AST) and/or 
alanine transaminase (ALT) concurrent or with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin that 
meet the criteria outlined in [Appendix 12.5 Liver Safety Monitoring and Assessment], in the 
absen ce of other causes of liver injury, are considered potential cases of drug -induced liver 
injury  (potential Hy ’s Law cases) and are alway s to be considered important medical events 
and reported per [Section 5.5.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events].
5.5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in 
any of the following outcomes:
●Results in death
●Is life -threatening (an AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death)
●Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  or substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions 
●Results in congenital anomaly , or birth defect
●Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (except for planned procedures as allowed per study ) 
or leads to prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (except if prolongation of planned 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_106305]). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_106306]/observation/examination caused b y AE is to be considered as serious.) 
●Other medicall y important events (defined in paragraph below)
Sponsor: APGD ISN/Protocol 3772- CL-[ADDRESS_118060] or may  require intervention to prevent 1 of the other outcomes listed in the definition 
above. These events, including those that may  result in disability /incapacity , usuall y are 
considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or 
at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of dr ug dependency  or drug abuse.
[IP_ADDRESS] Always Serious Adverse Events
The sponsor has a list of events that they  classify  as “alway s serious” events.  I f an AE is 
reported that is considered by [CONTACT_106364] “alway s 
serious”, additional information on the event (e.g., investigator confirmation of seriousness, 
causality) will be requested.  
5.5.3 Criteria for Causal Relationship to Study Vaccine
A medicall y qualified investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between the stud y 
vaccine and each occurrence of each (S)AE. This medically  qualified investigator will use 
medical judgment as well as the Reference Safet y Information to determine the relationship. 
The causality  assessment is 1 of the criteria used when determining regu latory  reporting 
requirements.
The medicall y qualified investigator is requested to provide an explanation for the causality 
assessment for each (S)AE and must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed 
the (S)AE and has provided an assessment of causality .
Following a review of the relevant data, the causal relationship between the study  vaccine 
and each (S)AE will be assessed by  [CONTACT_49419] ‘ yes’ or ‘ no’ to the question “ Do you 
consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by 
[CONTACT_106365] ”.
When making an assessment of causalit y, the following factors are to be considered when 
deciding if there is evidence and/or arguments to suggest there is a ‘reasonable possibility ’ 
that an (S)AE may  have been caused by [CONTACT_106365] (rather than a relationship cannot 
be ruled out) or if there is evidence to reasonably  deny  a causal relationship:
●Plausible temporal relationship between exposure to the study  vaccine and (S)AE onset 
and/or resolution. Has the subjec t actually  received the study  vaccine ? Did the (S)AE 
occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the study  vaccine? 
●Plausibility ; i.e., could the event been caused by  [CONTACT_106366] ? Consider biologic 
and/or pharmacologic mecha nism, half -life, literature evidence, drug/vaccine class, 
preclinical and clinical study  data, etc.
●Laboratory  or other test results; a specific lab investigation supports the assessment of 
the relationship between the (S)AE and the stud y vaccine (e.g., ba sed on values pre -
, 
during and post -immunization).

Version 2.1 Nons ubstantial Amendment 2●Available alternative explanations independent of study  vaccine exposure; such as other 
concomitant drugs, past medical history , concurrent or underl ying disease, risk factors 
including medical and family  history , season, location, etc., and strength of the 
alternative explanation.
There may  be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the sponsor. However, it is very important that 
the medically  qualified investigator alway s make an assessment of causalit y for every  event 
before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the sponsor. With limited or insufficient 
information about the event to make an informed medical judgment and in absence of an y 
indication or evidence to establish a causal relationship, a causalit y assessment of ‘no’ is to 
be considered. In such instance, the investigator is expected to obtain additional information 
regarding the event as soon as possible and to re -evaluate the causality  upon receipt of 
additional information. The medica lly qualified investigator may  revise his/her assessment of 
causality  in light of new information regarding the SAE and shall send an SAE follow -
up 
report and update the eCRF with the new information and updated causality assessment. 
5.5.4 Criteria for Defining the Severity of an Adverse Event
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity  of each AE:
●Mild: No disruption of normal daily  activities
●Moderate: Affect normal daily  activities
●Severe: Inability to perform daily  activities
●Potentially  life threatening: Emergency  room visit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
5.5.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
The collection of AEs will continue until [ADDRESS_118061] the sponsor by  [CONTACT_77787]

The investigator must complete and submit an SAE worksheet containing all information that 
is required b y local and/or r egional regulations to the sponsor by  [CONTACT_77788]  
(within 24 hours of awareness).
The SAE worksheet must be signed by a medically qualified investigator (as identified

Discontinuation of the Study
The sponsor may  terminate this study  prematurel y, either in its entirety or at any stud y site, 
for reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended 
termination . Advance notice is not required if the study  is stopped due to safety  concerns. If 
the sponsor terminates the study  for safet y reasons, the sponsor will immediately notify the 
investigator and subsequently  provide written instructions for stud y termination.  
7 STATI STICAL METHODOL OGY
A statistical anal ysis plan (SAP) will be written to provide details of the analy sis, along with 
specifications for tables, listings and figures to be produced. The SAP will be finalized before 
the database soft lock at the latest. An y changes from the anal yses planned in SAP will be 
justified in the clinical study  report.
In general, continuous data will be summarized with descriptive statistics (number of subjects, 
mean, standard deviation, geometric mean and geometric standard deviatio n (GSD) where 
applicable, minimum, median and maximum), and frequency  and percentage for categorical 
data. Percentages b y categories will be based on the number of subjects with no missing data, 
i.e., the percentages will sum to 100%.
Baseline will be defi ned as the last observation prior to first dose, unless otherwise specified.
Sample Size
In Stage 1, approximately 120 evaluable adults 18 to 64 years of age are planned to be enrolled.  
This sample size in is considered sufficient to obtain preliminary estimates in a phase 1 study  of 
safet y and reactogenicit y in the adult population, ages 18 to 64. In Stage 2, approximately 495 
evaluable adult subjects from 65 to 85 y ears of age are planned to be enrolled.  For each PCV13 
seroty pe the OPA titer-
1responses (geometric mean titer [GMT] and GSD) in subjects 60 to 
64years of age administered PCV13 (Source Prevnar13®label) were assumed to be 
representative of the response following immunization with ASP3772.  The width of 95% 
confidence intervals for each sero type with 30, 100 and 150 subjects were calculated. A sample 
size of 100 subjects at each dose level treated with ASP3772 under these assumptions was 
considered sufficient to provide good estimates of OPA titer-
1responses.  The sample size and 
dose level for the phase 3 study  will be determined based on the responses in Stage
2 elderl y 
subjects. 
Analysis Sets
The Safet y Analysis Set (SAF) will consist of all subjects who receive an immunization in 
this study  with either ASP3772, PCV13, or PPSV23.  The Ful l Anal ysis Set (FAS) will 
consist of all subjects who receive an immunization in this study  with either ASP3772, 
PCV13 or PPSV23 and have at least [ADDRESS_118070] immunizati on measurement.
For each ASP3772, PCV13 or PPSV23 immunization group, the number and percenta ge of 
subjects in each anal ysis set will be given for all randomized (ASP3772 or PCV13) or 
enrolled (PPSV23) subjects.

investigator with a complete and clean cop y of the site’s data and will provide the sponsor or 
designee with a complete and clean cop y of the study data.  The ownership of this data is 
with the investigator and subsequently  any changes requested to the non- subject reported data 
will be made using a Data Clarification Form (DCF) to the vendor.  The requested change 
must be supported by  [CONTACT_77802].  For this stud y, it has been decided that 
there are justifiable scientific reasons (e.g., recall bias) for not allowing changes after the

For screen failures the demographic data, reason for failing, informed consent, inclusion and 
exclusion criteria and AEs will be collected in the eCRF.
Major Protocol Deviations
A major protocol deviation is generally an unplanned excursion from the protocol that is not 
implemented or intended as 
a systematic change. The investigator is responsible for ensuring 
the study  is conducted in accordance with the procedures and evaluations described in this 
protocol and must protect the rights, safet y and welfare of subjects. The investigator should 
not implement any  deviation from, or changes of, the protocol, unless it is necessary  to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to study  subjects.  
A protocol waiver is a documented prospective approval of a request from an investigator to 
deviate from the protocol. Pr otocol waivers are strictly  prohibited.  The major protocol 
deviation criteria are described in [Section 7.8Major Protocol Deviations and Other 
Analyses].
When a major deviation from the protocol is identified for an individual subject, the 
investigator or designee must ensure the sponsor is notified.  The sponsor will follow- up with 
the investigator, as applicable, to assess the deviation and the po ssible impact to the safet y 
and/or efficacy of the subject to determine subject continuation in the study . 
If a major deviation impacts the safet y of a subject, the investigator must contact [CONTACT_106374] .  The investigator will also assure that deviations meeting IRB/IEC and 
applicable regulatory  authorities’ criteria are documented and communicated appropriatel y. 
All documentation and communications to the I RB/IEC and applicable regulatory  authorities 
will be provided to the sponsor and maintai ned within the trial master file.

●ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks.  
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and International Normalized Ratio (I NR) > 1.5 (If INR testing

The investigator may  determine that abnormal liver function results, other than as described 
above, may  qualify  as moderate or severe abnormalities and require additional monitoring 
and follow -up.
Follow -up Procedures
Confirmed moderate and severe abnormalities in hepatic functions should be thoroughly  
characterized b y obtaining appropriate expert consultations, detailed pertinent history, 
physical examination and laboratory  tests. The site staff is to co mplete the liver abnormality  
case report form (LA -CRF). Subjects with confirmed abnormal liver function testing should 
be followed as described below.

Severe hepatic liver function abnormalities as defined above, in the absence of another 
etiology , may  be considered an important medical event and may be reported as a SAE.  The

To further assess abnormal hepatic laboratory  findings, the i nvestigator is expected to:
●Obtain a more detailed history  of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.  Sy mptoms 
and new -onset diseases is to be recorded as “AEs” within the eCRF. Illnesses and 
conditions such as hy potensive events, and decompensated cardiac disease that may  lead 
to secondary  liver abnormalities should be noted. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is seen in 
obese h yperlipoproteinemic and/or diabetic patients, and may be associated with 
fluctuating AT levels.   The investigator should ensure that the medical history  form 
captures an y illness that predates stud y enrollment that may be relevant in assessing 
hepatic function. 
●Obtain a history  of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medication, 
complementary  and alternative medications), alcohol use, recreational dr ug use and 
special diets.  Medications, is to be entered in the eCRF.  I nformation on alcohol, other 
substance use and diet should be entered on the LA- CRF or an appropriate document.
●Obtain a history  of exposure to environmental chemical agents.
●Based on the subject’s history , other testing may  be appropriate including: 
oAcute viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E or other infectious agents), 
oUltrasound or other imaging to assess biliary  tract disease,
oOther laboratory  tests including INR, direct bilirubin.
●Consider gastroenterology or hepatology  consultations.
●Submit results for any  additional testing and possible etiology  on the LA -CRF or an 
appropriate document.
*Hy’s Law Definition: Drug -induced jaundice caused by  [CONTACT_77813] , without a 
significant obstructive component, has a high rate of bad outcomes, from 10 to 50% mortality  
(or transplant). 
The 2 “requirements” for Hy ’s Law are: 
1) Evidence that a drug can cause hepatocellular -type injury , generally  shown by  [CONTACT_106382] 3 × ULN (“2 × ULN elevations are too common in 
treated and untreated patients to be discriminating”). 
2) Cases of increased bilirubin (at least 2 × ULN) with concurrent transaminase elevations at 
least 3 × ULN and no evidence of intra- or extra -hepatic bilirubin obstruction (elevated 
alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) or Gilbert’s sy ndrome [Temple, 2006].

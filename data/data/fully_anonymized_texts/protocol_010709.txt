CEP287 Version: C Medtronic Confidential Page [ADDRESS_130194] the print date. 1. Background 
Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII), or  pump therapy, allows for insulin to be delivered 
continuously into the body, as opposed to delivery at sp ecific times. Rapid-acting insulin is infused into 
the body at constant/basal rates throughout a 24-hr period via the insulin pump which mimics normal 
insulin secretion from the pancreas. Additional rapid-acting insulin can be delivered in boluses to 
compensate for anticipated fluctuations in blood glucose in response to meals.  
 
Frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is al so an important part of the management of Type [ADDRESS_130195] insulin dosages. However, because SMBG va lues are taken only at specific time points and 
measure brief instances of time within a 24-hour period, there are limits to the usefulness of this 
information. The “snap-shot” effect of SMBG proves to be a challenge for tracking of blood glucose (BG) 
trends which can be overcome through the addition of c ontinuous interstitial glucose monitoring to the 
SMBG regimen. 
 
Current methods of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) include the use of subcutaneous glucose 
sensors worn by [CONTACT_116661]’s interstitial fluid into an electronic 
signal, the strength of which is proportional to the am ount of glucose present in the fluid.  The Paradigm® 
System, which received market approval from FD A on April 7, 2006 (P980022/S013), combined the 
technology of the Paradigm Insulin Pump (Models 522/722) with that of the MiniMed Guardian® REAL-Time Clinical device. The Paradigm System repres ents a combination of innovative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_116643] 1 diabetes mellitus: Pump therapy in conjunction with continuous interstitial glucose 
monitoring, as well as SMBG to perfect treat-to-glycemic–target approach.  
 In this study, the sensor is attached to a transmitte r which sends interstitial glucose information to the 
study Pump via radio signals. The pump screen is the data collection/user interface of the system and 
provides continuous real-time glucose values to the us er, as well as high/low glucose alerts set according 
to the individual patient’s needs. The Diabetes Cont rol and Complications Trial (DCCT) convincingly 
established the benefits of tight glucose control in the avoidance of long-term diabetic complications. 
However, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_116644] a. Surveys investigating the pr evalence of hypoglycemia have 
provided some alarming results. The DCCT reported a threefold increase in severe hypoglycemia and coma in intensively treated patients versus c onventionally treated patient s [DCCT Research Group, 
1991]. 
 
For many individuals with diabetes, epi[INVESTIGATOR_116645]-term complications. Hypoglycemia is frightening to 
patients and their families. It has been estimated that  about 55% of severe hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_116646]. Acutely diminished brain function du ring a hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_116647]. In addition, recurrent hypogl ycemia may impose long-lasting damaging effects on 
the brain, resulting in impairment of memory or other cognitive functions.   
 
In addition to adversely affecting cognition, re current hypoglycemia also impairs the body’s defense 
mechanisms against hypoglycemia, creating a viciou s cycle for the patient. Normally, hypoglycemia 
triggers a series of hormonal and neural responses designed to restore glucose concentration towards normal, to maintain brain metabolism.  A component of  this counter-regulatory response is the secretion 
of epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], which generates “neurogenic” sympto ms (e.g., palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], sweating, and anxiety) that 
serve to warn the patient of the drop in blood glucose.   The patient can then take action (i.e., eat) to help 
reverse the hypoglycemia.  After an epi[INVESTIGATOR_116648]’s  natural responses are 
impaired further increasing the patient’s risk of another hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
 
Terms regarding TS used in this protocol:  
 
 Threshold Suspend (TS) refers to low glucose suspend which allows for the suspension of insulin

2. Devices and Supplies 
2.1 Names and Intended Use of Devices  
2.1.1 Medtronic MiniMed® 530G Pump (MMT-551, MMT-751) – Investigational  
The Medtronic MiniMed® 530G Pump model (MMT-551, MMT-751) used in this 
study is an approved device in the [LOCATION_002]. This insulin pump is equipped 
with a number of features to actively manage the user’s glucose levels. The Threshold Suspend (TS) feature automatic ally stops insulin delivery based on a 
low Sensor Glucose Value (SGV). The TS  feature is only available when the 
pump is used in conjunction with cont inuous glucose monitoring (CGM) which 
consists of a subcutaneous glucose sensor and transmitter to communicate 
sensor glucose readings to the insulin pump. 
2.1.2 Paradigm Remote Control/Programmer (MMT-503) – Approved under 
510(k) K001829  
The Paradigm Remote Controller is a hand-held, reusable accessory device that 
uses radio frequency to transmit a signal to Paradigm Infusion Pumps for limited pump programming.  Using this accessory, a pump user can program a normal 
bolus, suspend or restart the pump. The device is considered an accessory to 
the Paradigm Infusion Pump family 
2.1.3 Medtronic MiniMed Enlite™  Glucose Sensor (MMT-7008) – 
Investigational  
The Medtronic MiniMed Enlite Sensor is a sensor that is similar in design and 
materials to the Medtronic MiniMed Glucose Sof-Sensor. The sensor includes a 
microelectrode with a thin coating of gl ucose oxidase beneath several layers of 
biocompatible membrane. It is intended to penetrate the skin at a 90-degree angle and is smaller than the Medtroni c MiniMed Glucose Sof-Sensor. An 
introducer needle penetrates the skin surface and provides support for the 
sensor microelectrode during insertion. The electrode tubing maintains the 
electrode structure by [CONTACT_116662]. 
The sensor continuously c onverts small amounts of glucose from the subject’s 
interstitial fluid into an electronic signal, the strength of which is proportional to the amount of glucose present in the blood. The electrode is composed of 
embedding, signal-conducting and insulating layers. 
2.1.4 Medtronic MiniMed MiniLink®  2 REAL-Time Transmitter (MMT-7713) – 
Investigational  
The MiniLink 2 is an investigational small transmitter device. The hardware of this 
transmitter is identical to MiniLink tr ansmitter approved under (PMA supplement 
approval number P980022/S018). The only difference between the two devices is the addition of the Artifact Detecti on software feature. Once the sensor has 
been inserted, the MiniLink 2 is connected directly to the sensor where it receives 
the electronic signal from the sensor el ectrode, converts signals into glucose 
data, and transmits the data to the pump. When a sensor is attached to the 
CEP287 Version: C Medtronic Confidential Page [ADDRESS_130197] the print date. MiniLink 2, it enters an initialization period. After two hours, it begins to 
periodically transmit glucose data to the pump, using a radio signal. 
 The MiniLink 2 contains a rechargeable battery, sensor electronics, and a radio 
frequency (RF) transmitter. A fully charged battery provides up to 14 days of 
transmitter use. The system includes a battery charger that will recharge the 
device according to the user guide.  For additional information on the MiniLink 2 REAL-Time Transmitter, refer to the MiniLink REAL-Time Transmitter User 
Guide. 
2.1.5 Medtronic CareLink® Therapy Management Software for Diabetes 
(MMT-7334) – Investigational – referred to as CareLink Clinical in the 
protocol  
Carelink Clinical is an Internet based software system which allows data to be 
viewed and is easily evaluated by [CONTACT_116663]/her physician but should 
not be used by [CONTACT_116664]. A Personal Computer (PC) is used to access CareLink Clinical via 
the Internet, which then allows subjects/parents/caregivers to upload data from Medtronic MiniMed insulin pumps and a range of system-supported, third-party 
blood glucose meters. Carelink Clinical was developed for use by [CONTACT_116665]. The data contained in CareLink Clinical is accessible to users using a standard browser, e.g., Microsof t® Internet Explorer on an Internet 
enabled PC. 
  
CareLink Clinical uses standard Secu re Socket Layer (SSL) technology. SSL 
transmission protocol invokes encryption on both ends of the transmissions and is the standard for all security based syst ems. The encryption remains in effect 
whether the data is moving to and from the client and server in the [LOCATION_002], 
or to and from a client in another country to the [LOCATION_002]. The data is secure 
behind a three tier industry standard architecture, which places the database behind three different firewalls, where each firewall separates a tier: 
 
1. The internet to the web server; 
2. Web server to the application server; 
3. Application server to the database server. 
This software has been developed especially for use in clinical trials. 
2.1.6 Medtronic MiniMed charger ( MMT-7705) – FDA approval P980022/S018

setting as a means of facilitating communication between Medtronic diabetes therapy management devices that use Pa radigm-compatible RF telemetry and a 
personal computer that uses data ma nagement application software. The 
CareLink USB device will enable data from the Medtronic MiniMed® 530G to be 
uploaded to CareLink Clinical. 
2.1.10 Bayer CONTOUR™ Next Link Blood Glucose Meter (HMS 9740) – FDA 
approval K110894 
The Bayer Contour Next Link RF enabl ed BG Meter measures a subject’s 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_116649], which is then used to calibrate the pump. The 
Medtronic MiniMed
® 530G pump uses the calibration point in the real-time 
algorithm which calculates the sensor gl ucose values that are displayed to the 
subject. In a normal setting, the result of the SMBG reading is transmitted to the pump via radiofrequency (RF) and can be stored in its memory as a glucose 
calibration point. The pump asks the user every time if the user wants to use the linked meter BG for calibration. If accept ed, the glucose value will be stored in 
the pump’s memory as a calibration point.

6.3 Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
6.3.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis  
A mixed effects model be used to produce the estimate and confidence interval 
of the overall mean change in A1C while accounting for inter-site variability. The 
97.5% upper confidence interval of A1 C will be calculated and compared to the 
0.4% non-inferiority margin. As for endpoi nt analysis, the proposed mixed effects 
model using all A1C measurements has more power than the model only using

take precedence over any previous versions.  
 
CEP287 Version: C Medtronic Confidential Page [ADDRESS_130246] received appropriate training, will serve as the 
Study Monitor(s). Monitoring visits will be conducted based on Medtronic’s Standard Operating 
Procedures and the needs of the study. Quality documents will be fo llowed for the conduct of all activities 
related to monitoring for this study.    
 
Site Qualification and Initiation Visits will be complete d prior to enrollment of the first subject.  Interim 
study monitoring activities will include an inspection  of completed study docu ments, source document 
verification and reporting, verification of database ac curacy and completeness.  All subjects enrolled in 
the trial will be monitored and the eCRF data verifi ed against the subjects’ source documents.  Following 
each monitoring visit, a report will be prepared and submi tted to the Sponsor.  From initiation of the study 
to the final close out visit, the Study Monitor(s) will assume primary respon sibility for communications 
between the Study Investigators and the Sponsor. 
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_116653].  Initial and ongoing Inve stigational Center training will be provided during 
the Site Initiation Visit, subsequent monitoring visits , and regular Investigational Center contact.  All 
Investigational Center staff must complete and si gn the Study Training Record(s) and maintain the 
record(s) in the Investigational Center regulatory bi nder.  Prior to enrollment of the first subject, all 
Investigators and study coordinators who will be part icipating in enrollment, eCRF completion, device 
insertion/application, device training, and consen ting subjects must complete the Sponsor-required 
training. 
 
All monitoring visits and visits from the Sponsor to the Investigational Center will be recorded using the 
Site Visit Sign-In Log and co-signed by [CONTACT_116682].  The log will be kept in the Investigational Center regulatory binder and the original will collected at the end of the study and 
submitted to the sponsor.

welfare of study subjects. 
12.3 Investigational Center Disqualification  
Medtronic and/or the IRB retain the right to disqua lify an Investigational Center and remove all study 
materials at any time. Specific instances, which may precipi[INVESTIGATOR_116654], 
include but are not limited to:  
 Unsatisfactory subject enrollment  with regard to quality and quantity. 
 Persistent non-compliance to protocol procedur es on the part of an Investigator/Investigational 
Center. Inaccurate, incomplete, and/or untimely data recording on a recurrent basis. 
 The incidence and/or severity of adverse experiences  in this or other studies indicating a potential 
health hazard caused by [CONTACT_8121]. 
 
A written statement fully documenting the reasons for such a termination will be provided to Medtronic, 
the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and other regulatory authorities, as required. 
12.4 Protocol Deviations  
A deviation is any instance(s) of failure to follow, intentionally or unint entionally, the requirements of the 
protocol. It is expected that the Investigator will conduct this clinical tr ial in compliance with the protocol 
and all applicable regulations governing the conduct of clinical research involv ing human subjects. Failure 
to do so could result in one or all of the following:  
 observation in the monitoring report 
 deviation to document the event 
 corrective action plan 
CEP287 Version: C Medtronic Confidential Page [ADDRESS_130248] the print date.  site disqualification  
 notification to the regulatory authorities depending on the severity of the deviation  
 
The investigator is responsible for protecting the safe ty and welfare of the clinical research subjects.   
 
Compliance with Protocol:  
The Investigator or person designated by [CONTACT_116683]. The date and reason for each 
deviation will be documented. (CFR 21 812.140 Records)  
 The investigator should not implement any deviation fr om, or changes of, the protocol without agreement 
by [CONTACT_116684]/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_5698]/IEC of an 
amendment, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to trial subjects, or when the change(s) involves only logistical or administrative as pects of the trial (e.g., change of monitor(s), change 
of telephone number(s)). 
 
The investigator may implement a deviation from, or a change in, the protocol to eliminate an immediate 
hazard(s) to trial subjects without prior IRB/IEC approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. As soon as possible, the 
implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it, and, if appropriate, the proposed protocol amendment(s) should be submitted: 
 
(a) To the IRB/IEC for review and approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]; (b) To the sponsor for agreement and, if required; 
(c) To the regulatory authority(ies). 
 
21 CFR 812.150 (4) states “….except in such an emergency, prior approval by [CONTACT_116685] a plan, and if thes e changes or deviations may affect the scientific 
soundness of the plan or the rights, safety, or we lfare of human subjects, FDA and IRB in accordance 
with 21 CFR 812.35(a) also is required”.   
 
Emergency deviations must be reported to the spon sor and IRB within [ADDRESS_130249]  the integrity of study data and/or affect subject’s 
willingness to participate in the study. These deviat ions are significant and require immediate sponsor 
notification upon investigator awareness:

14.[ADDRESS_130254] fi ndings. Reports of adverse events will be requested 
from subjects/parents/caregivers at each visit and adverse event eCRFs will be completed as required. 
Investigational Center staff will assess the intensity of each adverse event and its relationship to study 
procedures or devices. 
 
CEP287 Version: C Medtronic Confidential Page [ADDRESS_130255] a relationship to a study procedure or study device will be 
analyzed by [CONTACT_116690] a 
connection to mis-use of the device(s) or user error.   
 
Events that are moderate and severe in intensity, all SAE, SADE and UADE that have not resolved at the 
time of the subject’s discontinuation or completion of  the study will be followed until the medical outcome 
is determined or until no further change in the condit ion is expected. All adverse events that have not 
resolved will have a final status of ‘ongoing’. 
Adverse Events reported to sponsor: 
The Investigator or designee will repo rt all adverse event s to the sponsor: 
 
 Adverse Events not related to the study device or study procedure 
 Adverse Events related to the study device 
 Adverse Events related to study procedures 
 UADE (Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect) 
 All SAE (Serious Adverse Events) 
 Severe Hypoglycemia 
 DKA (Diabetic Ketoacidosis) 
 A pre-existing medical condition will only be document ed as an adverse event if the condition worsens 
during the course of the subject’s participation in  the study. Non-serious Adverse events should be 
entered on the appropriate Electronic Case Report Form  (eCRF) within [ADDRESS_130256] report to the 
site. For serious adverse events, reporting is require d to sponsor within 24 hours of site awareness.  
14.3 Review of Severe Hypoglycemia and DKA.  
Severe hypoglycemia, and DKA will be adjudica ted by [CONTACT_116691] (CEC) 
comprised of external physicians.  The adjudi cation will include device relatedness and whether 
the event was considered to be serious or not. The CEC may use Carelink reports, medical 
records and information on CRF to make determination.   
14.4 Definitions  
Adverse Event (AE)  (ISO14155: 2011) 
Any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or  injury, or untoward clinical signs (including 
abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or  other persons, whether or not related to the 
investigational medical device. Note 1: This definition includes events related to t he investigational medical device or the comparator. 
Note 2: This definition includes events related to the procedures involved. 
Note 3: For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to investigational medical 
devices. 
 
Adverse Device Effect (ADE) (ISO [ZIP_CODE]: 2011) 
Any untoward and unintended response to a medical device.  
Note 1: This includes any adverse event resulting from  insufficiencies or inadequacies in the instructions 
for use, the deployment, the implantation, the inst allation, the operation, or any malfunction of the 
medical device. 
 Note 2: This includes any event that is a re sult of a use error or intentional misuse.   
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  (ISO [ZIP_CODE]: 2011) 
An adverse event that  
(a) Led to a death 
(b) Led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that 
CEP287 Version: C Medtronic Confidential Page [ADDRESS_130257] the print date.  resulted in life threatening illness or injury, 
 resulted in a permanent impairment of  a body structure or a body function 
 required in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]* or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
 resulted in medical or surgical intervention to  prevent permanent impairment to a body structure 
or a body function  
(c) Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
*Inpatient Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31561]: 24 hour ac ute admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_116657]. 
Note: A planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5912]-existing conditi on, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_10396], without a 
serious deterioration in health, is not considered to be a serious adverse event.  
 
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE)  (ISO [ZIP_CODE]: 2011) 
Adverse device effect that has resulted in any of t he consequences characteristic of a serious adverse 
event.  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) (21 CFR 812.3(s)) 
Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, 
or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious problem as sociated with a device that  relates to the rights, 
safety, or welfare of subjects. 
 
Severe Hypoglycemia is an event requiring assistance of another person (due to altered consciousness) 
to actively administer carbohydrate, gluc agon, or other resuscitative actions.  
This means that the subject was impaired cognitively to the point that he/she was unable to treat his or 
her self, was unable to verbalize his or her needs, and was incoherent, disori ented and/or combative. 
 These epi[INVESTIGATOR_27982]. Plasma glucose measurements may not be available during such an event, but neurological recovery attributable 
to the restoration of plasma glucose to normal is  considered sufficient evidence that the event was 
induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.  (adapted from the
 American Diabetes Association 
Workgroup on Hypoglycemia, 2005)   
 
“Severe Hyperglycemia” is defined as Hyperglycemia (blood glucose >300  mg/dL ) with blood glucose 
ketones >0.6mmol/L or accompanied by [CONTACT_96502], vomiting or abdominal pain. 
 
“Diabetic Ketoacidosis/DKA” is defined as: Hyperglycemia (blood glucose greater than 250 mg/dL or 
greater than 13.9 mmol/L) with either low serum bi carbonate (less than 15 mEq/L) and/or low pH (less 
than or equal to 7.24) Anion gap (greater than 12) and either ketonemia or ketonuria and requiring 
treatment within a health -care facility. (American Diabetes Associati on-Diabetes Care, Volume 27, 
Supplement 1, January 2004 ) 
14.5 Device or Procedure Relatedness:  
The relatedness of the event to the study device or procedures will be determined for each adverse 
event. Subjects participating in this study have type [ADDRESS_130258] possibly caused the event and 
therefore is related to the study device or procedure.   
The investigator will review all elements surroundi ng the event to properly determine relatedness – this 
would include the subjects/parents/caregivers de scription of the event, study device downloads and 
medical records (if applicable) from the treating fa cility. These records will be made available to the 
CEP287 Version: C Medtronic Confidential Page [ADDRESS_130259] of the sponsor. The following definitions should 
be considered when determining the relationship of  the event to the device or study procedure: 
 
Definite – clearly related to the device or procedure 
Probable – likely related to the device or procedure 
Possible – may be related to the device or procedure Unlikely – doubtfully related to the device or procedure 
Not Related – clearly not related to the device or procedure 
 If the investigator determines the ev ent meets the definition of definit e, probable or possible the event 
should be considered related and the Yes box on the AE eCRF would be checked for the question related to. If the investigator determines the event meets th e definition of unlikely, not  related or unknown the 
event should be considered unrelated and the NO  box would be checked on the AE eCRF for the 
question was the event related to.  
14.6 Event Intensity (severity):  
Mild:  Transient, needing no special treatment, and/or does not interfere with the subject’s daily 
activity.  Moderate: Low level of inconvenience or concern to  the subject and may interfere with daily 
activities, but is usually improved by [CONTACT_116692].  
Severe*:  Interrupts a subject’s daily activity and typi[INVESTIGATOR_116658]. 
 
Please Note*: The terms “serious” and “severe” are not synonymous.  Severe is often used to 
describe the intensity (severity) of a specific ev ent (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial 
infarction); the event itself, however, may be of rela tively minor medical significance (such as severe 
headache). This is NOT the same as “serious” whic h is based on the definition of “serious criteria” 
which have been provided.  
14.7 Clinical Events Committee  
A clinical events committee consisting of external physicians with an expertise in Endocrinology and the 
management of Type 1 diabetes including CGM will be convened. The CEC will review all reports of: 
 Diabetic Ketoacidosis 
 Severe Hypoglycemia 
 Serious Adverse Event 
 Serious Adverse Device Effect 
 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect 
 
The CEC will assess these events to determine agree ment or disagreement with the investigator 
determination of the event. The investigator will be notified of any disagreem ent in assessment of an 
event by [CONTACT_15741].

15. Administrative Considerations 
15.1 Document Storage and Retention  
The Sponsor and Investigator will retain all records and documents pertaining to this study. They will be 
available for inspection by [CONTACT_116693]. In addition, the Investigator will retain the 
source documents from which the information entered  on the eCRF was derived. These records are to be 
retained in a secure storage facility maintained by [CONTACT_116694] 2 years after approval of 
the above-listed study devices or term ination of the study, whichever is longer. The Investigator should 
not dispose of these records wi thout the approval of the Sponsor . 
15.2 Data Handling  
All data required for analysis will be captured on electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) using Oracle Clinical’s 21 CFR Part 11 compliant Remote Data  Capture (RDC) module. Original eCRFs will not be 
used as source data and supporting documentati on will be required. Electronic device data will be 
collected from the study pump using Medtronic CareLi nk Clinical, which is [ADDRESS_130261] with CRF completion. In the event of data discrepancies, 
Investigational Centers will be asked to resolve que ries electronically in the RDC system; otherwise, 
irresolvable data-related issues will be routed to the S ponsor for review and final disposition. An audit trail 
is maintained in Oracle Clinical to capture any corrections or changes  of the eCRFs. System backups for 
data stored in the Oracle Clinical system will be consistent with Medtr onic standard procedures. 
 

CEP287 Version: C Medtronic Confidential Page [ADDRESS_130262] also be reviewed and electronically sign ed by [CONTACT_737], indicating his/her agreement 
with the accuracy of all recorded data. It is expected that the Investigator and his/her staff will cooperate 
with the monitoring team and provide any missing data in a timely manner. 
15.[ADDRESS_130263] of the study and system being studied will be 
initiated before the protocol is implemented.  All participating physicians and coordinators will be 
familiarized with the system. Specific Investigationa l Center staff will be trained on each of the system’s 
components. Training will contain both lecture a nd hands-on experience.

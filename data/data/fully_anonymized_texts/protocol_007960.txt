Subjects will be required to return to the clinic at Baseline, Day 14 (Week 2) and Day 28 (Week 4). All subjects will be asked to attend a Week 8 follow-up visit 4 weeks (28 days (±3) days) after the last dose of study medication. Statistical Considerations: Sample Size: Approximately 576 subjects may be enrolled to account for 16.7% drop out rate prior to completing the study.  A total of 160 evaluable subjects per group (480 total) are required to achieve at least 80% to detect a pairwise difference of 0.[ADDRESS_788472] deviation of 2.5 and applying a Dunnett 
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 10  Testing Method at a one-sided familywise error rate of 0.10. Populations:  ● ITT population:  All subjects who are enrolled and apply at least 1 dose of study treatment will be included in the Intent to Treat (ITT) population.  The ITT population will be the primary population for safety and efficacy assessments. ● Per Protocol (PP) population:  All subjects in the ITT population without any protocol deviations that may have an impact on the efficacy assessments, who complete their Week [ADDRESS_788473] 50% of investigational product (IP), will be included in the Per Protocol (PP) population. ● Safety Population:  All subjects treated with at least one dose of IP.  Efficacy Analysis:  Efficacy analysis will be performed on the ITT population with some supportive analysis on the PP population.  Regression models will include all eligible subjects for the respective analysis, from the [ADDRESS_788474] vehicle and comparison of the B244 groups to one another.   The frequency and rate of NRS responders at Week 4 (≥4 point change from baseline in NRS) will be reported and compared between treatment groups using a logistic regression model. Continuous measures of change from baseline to Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, Week 8 for AI-NRS and WI-NRS; and change from baseline to Week 2, Week 4, Week 8 for POEM and 5-D Pruritus Scale will be analyzed using mixed models with repeated measures (MMRM) to account for within-subject variability over time.  Comparisons at each time point will be performed within the longitudinal model. Safety Analysis:   
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 11  Analysis of safety measures will be performed on the Safety Population, including all treated subjects.  The incidence of all adverse events (AEs) and treatment-related AEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_82153]. These AEs will be classified by [CONTACT_223264] (MedDRA). The incidence and severity of changes in local tolerability and adverse reactions will be collected as a solicited AE of special interest.  For incidence reporting, if a subject reported more than one AE that was coded to the same system organ class or preferred term, the subject will be counted only once for that specific system organ class or preferred term. An overview of AEs, which includes subject incidence of AEs, treatment-related AEs, AEs by [CONTACT_926], SAEs, deaths, and AEs leading to discontinuation, will be presented.   Summaries of IP exposure, clinical laboratory measures, vital signs, rescue medications, and concomitant medications will be presented. Study Sites Approximately [ADDRESS_788475]’s Participation Approximately 11 weeks: Up to 3 weeks of screening, 4 weeks of treatment, and a follow-up period of 4 weeks.   This study will be conducted in accordance with the Guidelines of Good Clinical Practices (GCPs).

Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 18  2 INTRODUCTION 2.1 Background Ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) are essential for the initial step in environmental nitrification processes, specifically the oxidation of ammonia (NH3) to nitrite (NO2-). Nitrosomonas are Gram-negative chemolithoautotrophic betaproteobacteria that obtain energy solely from NH3 oxidation, while fixing CO2 for their carbon needs2. Oxidation of NH3 proceeds in two steps (Figure 1) leading to sequential generation of hydroxylamine (NH2OH) and NO2- that require two enzyme complexes: the membrane-bound ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) comprised of subunits AmoA, AmoB and AmoC; and the periplasmic NH2OH oxidoreductase (HAO). In addition to high NO2- levels, NH3 oxidation leads to nitric oxide (NO) and N2O production through two independent pathways downstream of NH2OH production: nitrifier denitrification and NH2OH oxidation3.  Figure [ADDRESS_788482] genetic profile from that of other published Nitrosomonas strains and AOB genomes. Based on in vitro co-culture studies, B244 was able to reduce survival of pathogenic bacteria. Nitrite generation from ammonia concurrently with medium acidification by B244 led to strong antibacterial effects and a marked reduction (~100-fold) in viable counts of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, two pathogens frequently isolated from infected skin and wound sites. In contrast, control cultures with B244 in the absence of ammonium or with heat-killed B244 supplemented with ammonium, had no antibacterial effects. The unique metabolic and antimicrobial activity of Nitrosomonas, in combination with their lack of virulence render these bacteria as attractive candidates for topi[INVESTIGATOR_596867]. NO-releasing drugs or NO donors have also shown activity against Propi[INVESTIGATOR_596868], anti-inflammatory activity, and inhibition of lipogenesis by [CONTACT_134755]-stimulated immortal sebocytes4-6.   2.2 Clinical Experience B244 is being developed as a ‘live topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]’ to provide a natural source of AOB and NO/NO2 to the human skin.

In addition, a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial titled, “A Randomized, Double Blinded, Phase IIb/III, Decentralized Study of B244 Delivered as a Topi[INVESTIGATOR_596869] 372 patients with clinical diagnosis of facial acne” has been completed.  B244 was safe and well tolerated with no attributable drug related SAEs.  Efficacy was supported by [CONTACT_596899] 2-point reduction in IGA with B244 and a trend in the reduction of the number of inflammatory lesions compared to vehicle.   A study titled, “A Prospective, Vehicle Controlled, Double Blind, Multicenter, Randomized, Phase II Study of B244 Delivered as a Topi[INVESTIGATOR_596870]” has recently been completed.  A total of 122 subjects were enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive B244 or vehicle in the study. Overall, there were no unexpected safety signals observed following treatment with B244. A total of 30 (25%) subjects experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) during the study, including 16 (26%) subjects in the B244 treatment group and 14 (23%) subjects in the vehicle group.   AOBiome completed a Phase Ib study in pediatric and adolescent subjects aged 2-17 years of age. A study titled, “An Open-label, Multicenter, Phase Ib Study of B244 Delivered as a Topi[INVESTIGATOR_596871] 2 to 17 years with Atopic Dermatitis” enrolled a total of 28 subjects across 3 cohorts.  Overall, there were no unexpected safety signals observed following treatment with B244 in pediatric subjects with atopic dermatitis. The B244 spray was well tolerated and not associated with any increased pain or redness at the application site.  “A Vehicle-Controlled, Double-Blind, Randomized Phase II Study of B244 Delivered as a Topi[INVESTIGATOR_596872]” has been completed with a total of 140 subjects randomized. Generally, there were no unexpected safety signals observed following treatment with B244. Overall, 31 (22.1) subjects had experienced at least one treatment emergent adverse event of which 19 (26.0%) subjects in B244 spray group and 12 (17.9%) in the Vehicle group.  In addition, other topi[INVESTIGATOR_276905] B244 include hypertension.  A study titled, “A Prospective, Controlled, Double Blinded, Multicenter, Randomized, Vehicle Controlled, Phase II Study of B244 Delivered as a Topi[INVESTIGATOR_596873]” has been completed.  Safety data indicated that B244 was safe and well tolerated.  Overall, 16% of subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE during the study with comparable incidence in the B244 and Vehicle groups.  Overall, there were no unexpected safety signals observed following treatment with B244.  
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 20  Moreover, intranasal application of B244 is being developed for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and migraines.  A rat toxicology study performed by [CONTACT_276938] B244 twice daily for 28 days found that B244 was safe and well tolerated in rats at levels of up to the maximum dose 8x109 cell/mL.  A study titled, “A Prospective, Controlled, Double Blinded, Single Center, Randomized, 3 arm, Phase 1b/2a Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, and Preliminary Efficacy of B244 Delivered as an Intranasal Spray in Healthy Volunteers and Subjects with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis” has been completed.  In addition, a study titled “A Prospective, Randomized, Vehicle-Controlled, Double-Blind, Phase 2 Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of B244 Delivered as an Intranasal Spray for Preventive Treatment in Subjects with Epi[INVESTIGATOR_33185]” is in progress.  2.[ADDRESS_788485] heterotrophic bacteria, with optimum doubling times of 8 hours or higher.  In particular, Nitrosomonas growth is rate limited by [CONTACT_276936] 27 moles NH3/mole CO2 fixed.  Due to their dependence on ammonia for their growth, the numbers of Nitrosomonas on the skin will be necessarily limited and naturally regulated by [CONTACT_596900].  This would ensure that the amount of nitrite and NO generated would be relatively low, without any adverse effects.   2.4 Rationale for the Study Eczema or Atopic dermatitis is an inflammatory skin condition that affects nearly 20% of children and between 2-10% of adults7. Disease prevalence has steadily grown in the last [ADDRESS_788486] potent mediators in AD related pruritus.

Correlation between the severity of the disease and presence of Staphylococcus aureus has been well established and it has been shown that the presence of bacteria is an important factor in skin aggravation10. The goal of therapy for AD is to restore the epi[INVESTIGATOR_596876], thereby [CONTACT_596901]. However, systemic antibiotic use is controversial.  B244 has been developed as a topi[INVESTIGATOR_55594] a natural source of AOB and NO/NOx to the human skin.  We hypothesize that application of AOB to eczematous skin may reduce Staphylococcus aureus skin load and normalize the inflammatory response by [CONTACT_283040]2 activation. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of B244 in the treatment of pruritus in adults with a history of atopic dermatitis. 3 STUDY OBJECTIVES 3.1 Primary Objective ● To assess the efficacy of B244 in the treatment of pruritus in adults with a history of atopic dermatitis.  3.2 Secondary Objectives ● To assess the safety and tolerability of B244 in adults with a history of atopic dermatitis. 4 ENDPOINTS 4.1 Efficacy 4.1.1 Primary ● Mean change in WI-NRS from baseline to Week 4 4.1.2 Secondary ● Proportion of patients with ≥4 point improvement in WI-NRS from baseline to Week 4 ● Proportion of subjects with any improvement in WI-NRS from baseline to Week 4 ● Mean change in AI-NRS from baseline to Week 4 ● Proportion of subjects with ≥4 point improvement in AI-NRS from baseline to Week 4 ● Proportion of subjects with any improvement in AI-NRS from baseline to Week 4 ● Mean change in WI-NRS from baseline to Week 2 ● Proportion of subjects with ≥4 point improvement in WI-NRS from baseline to Week 2 ● Mean change in POEM from baseline to Week 4 ● Mean change in 5-D Pruritus Scale from baseline to Week 4 4.1.3 Exploratory

Participants will report for a Screening visit and if all inclusion/exclusion criteria are met, subjects will go through a two-week washout phase (see Section 10.6.2) before reporting for a Baseline visit.   ● After screening and baseline, participants will be randomized to one of two doses of B244 or vehicle application for 4 weeks.  ● Randomization will be 1:1:1 so that an equal number of patients will be treated in each Arm of the study. ● All B244 randomized subjects will be treated at the dose of 1x1010 cells/ml (O.D. 5.0) or 4x1010 cells/ml (O.D. 20.0). ● Subjects must be willing and able to complete diary within a consistent time frame on a daily basis and to comply with restrictions on allowable therapi[INVESTIGATOR_82482].  ● All subjects will attend a screening visit not more than 21 days prior to Baseline (Day 0). Subjects will be required to return to the clinic at Baseline, Day 14 (Week 2) and Day 28 (Week 4) visits. All subjects will be asked to attend a Week 8 follow-up visit 4 weeks (28 (±3) days) after the last dose of study medication. ● Subjects will apply a total of 10 pumps of IP per application across all affected areas twice-a-day (i.e. 10 pumps in the morning and 10 pumps again at night) for 4 weeks. ● Safety evaluations will consist of review of participant’s medical history at screening and on-going assessment of adverse events reported throughout the study duration.

Subjects will be allowed to use their emollient of choice at a similar dose and frequency throughout the study if used.  Any clinically significant changes in type, dose, or frequency of bland emollients will not be allowed during the study.  A detailed guideline will be shared with the sites and subjects to ensure consistency in study medication treatment application and relation to body washing, emollient use, and other chemical exposure to skin.  Subjects will be encouraged not to use sunscreen on the treated lesions during participation in the study. Sunscreen should be used minimally or used sparingly while in the active treatment phase (Baseline to Week 4) of the study.  Alternatively, sunscreen should be washed off prior to study medication use.  Subjects who do not have atopic dermatitis on their face may apply makeup as needed. However, those subjects who have atopic dermatitis on their face and require to use makeup will be advised to use it minimally.  [ADDRESS_788496] (2-8oC).

Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 29  All investigational drug supplies in the study will be stored in a secure, refrigerated (2-8°C) safe place, under the responsibility of the Investigator or other authorized individual.   8.4 Description of Blinding Method This study will be double-blinded: neither Investigator(s), nor study participants, nor those involved in the conduct of the trial (including sponsor staff) will be aware of the treatment the participants are receiving.  The appearance of B244 and vehicle dispensing containers will be identical.  8.5 Treatment Assignments: This is a double-blind study. Participants will be assigned to study treatment in accordance with the randomization schedule generated for the allocation of B244 or vehicle prior to the initiation of the trial. Randomization will be centrally-based and performed using an appropriate IWRS (an automated randomization system).   Each participant scheduled to receive investigational product (IP) will receive a randomization number at the time of randomization. The randomization number will be used to identify the study medication kit assigned to the participant and indicate the treatment to be administered to that participant.      8.[ADDRESS_788498]’s compliance by [CONTACT_596903], Week [ADDRESS_788499] will count the number of pumps that were made with Bottle 1 and complete the remaining number of pumps needed to achieve a total of 10 pumps using Bottle 2.    At the Week 2 visit, subjects will return any empty bottle (likely Bottle [ADDRESS_788500] should be on Bottle 2 at the time of visit) to the site for weight measurement (without the safety cap) to confirm usage.  At this visit, a third bottle of the same treatment group will be labeled as Bottle [ADDRESS_788501] following a detailed instruction on treatment application that will be shared with the sites and subjects to ensure consistency in treatment application and relation to body washing, emollient use, and other chemical exposure to skin.  Key guidelines include:  ● The subject should wash his/her hands before applying study treatment. ● Subjects will apply a total of 10 pumps of IP per application to all affected. areas twice-a-day (i.e., 10 pumps in the morning and 10 pumps again at night). ● The subject will apply the IP to the affected area twice daily (approximately 12 hours apart) for 28 consecutive days. ● Subject should mix the bottle thoroughly per instructions provided before each application and then saturate the application area well, holding the bottle approximately [ADDRESS_788502] from the skin. 
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 31  ● Subjects will be asked to let the product air dry after each application. ● Subjects will follow instructions provided for body washing, emollient use, and other chemical exposure to skin in relation to timing of IP application. ● The spray bottle in use may be stored at ambient temperature until used up, while additional unused bottles will be stored in the refrigerator until use.  DO NOT FREEZE. ● The subject will apply the IP to the worst and largest lesions first and then apply the IP to the smaller lesions. If after covering all lesions, the total number of pumps per application has not been exhausted, subject should go back and cover the worst lesions with the remaining number of pumps. However, the total number of 10 pumps allowed should not be exceeded per application.  ● Subjects will be asked not to expose the treatment kit to conditions which are unnatural or harmful to the product, such as excessive heat (temperatures over 77°F [25°C] and freezing temperatures below 32°F [ 0°C]). Subjects may travel with their study medication but should not leave it in a hot car, outside in the cold temperatures, etc. Subjects will also be asked not to tamper or cause damage to the IP bottle. 8.[ADDRESS_788503]. The Investigator will use clinical judgment to treat any overdose.   8.9 Study Drug Discontinuation  Subjects will be discontinued from study drug treatment in the following events:  ● The subject experiences a Grade 2 or higher treatment emergent AE that is assessed as likely related to study drug  ● The subject receives treatment with an excluded therapy or has a clinically significant change in dose or frequency of allowed adjunctive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_596882] ● The female subject becomes pregnant or female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant or is breastfeeding  Discontinuation from study drug treatment may also occur for any of the following reasons:  ● Subject decision to discontinue study drug treatment, or subject decision to withdraw consent from the study  ● Any medical condition that may jeopardize the subject’s safety if study drug is continued, in the investigator’s and/or Sponsor’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]  ● Discontinuation is deemed to be in the best interest of the subject, in the investigator’s and/or Sponsor’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_596883]244-[ADDRESS_788504] be maintained throughout the course of the trial. Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or use of an IP (deficient IP in condition, appearance, pertaining documentation, labeling, expi[INVESTIGATOR_5695], etc.) should be promptly reported to the Sponsor, who will initiate a complaint procedure. All investigational product must be stored in a secure locked room with access limited to the Investigator and designated site personnel. Study product is to be stored in a refrigerator between 2-8°C. Maintenance of a temperature log is required. Under no circumstances will the Investigator allow IP to be used other than as directed by [CONTACT_204264], or dispose of IP in any other manner.   8.11 Unblinding Procedures The Investigator may unblind a participant’s treatment assignment only in the case of emergency or in the event of a serious medical condition when knowledge of the study treatment is essential for the appropriate clinical management or welfare of the participant, as determined by [CONTACT_737]. It is preferred (but not required) that the Investigator first contacts the Medical Monitor to discuss options before unblinding the participant’s treatment assignment. The Investigator must notify the Sponsor as soon as possible when a participant’s treatment assignment is unblinded without revealing the treatment assignment of the unblinded participant unless that information is deemed important for the safety of participants currently in the study. The date and reason for the unblinding must be documented in the participant’s study record.  The Medical Monitor may unblind the treatment assignment for any participant with an SAE. If the SAE requires that an expedited regulatory report be sent to one or more regulatory agencies, a copy of the report, identifying the participant’s treatment assignment, may be sent to clinical Investigators in accordance with local regulations and/or sponsor policy.  8.[ADDRESS_788505] All partially used or unused treatments will be returned to the site as brought by [CONTACT_19288]. A detailed IP log of the returned IP shall be established.  The site will not destroy unused IP unless the Sponsor provides written authorization to the contrary. All used and unused bottles will be shipped to the authorized drug depot at the end of the study.  8.13 Concomitant and Excluded Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_596884]244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 33  Any medication or vaccine (including over-the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) that the subject is receiving within 30 days prior to screening and through the final study visit will be recorded on the appropriate CRF) along with:  ● Reason for use. ● Dates of administration including start and end dates. ● Dosage information including dose and frequency.

Women of childbearing potential are defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who is NOT permanently sterile (e.g., by [CONTACT_306620]) or postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is defined as 12 consecutive months with no menses without an alternative medical cause.  Effective contraception methods include:  ● Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement of an IUD or IUS or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy, for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception  ● Use of barrier methods (i.e., condom, diaphragm) used with a spermicide (i.e., foam, cream, or gel that kills sperm) ● Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the study participant).   Periodic abstinence (i.e., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.   Male participants of the study who are having sexual intercourse with a woman who can become pregnant must use an acceptable form of birth control while participating in the study. Additionally, male participants are expected to inform their female partners of their participation in a research study of an investigational drug, the effects of which on a fetus and on a pregnant woman are unknown. Male participants will also be expected to provide their female partners with the contraception requirements information previously described and the study doctor’s contact [CONTACT_276950].

Vital signs will be assessed as outlined in Appendix A and at unscheduled study visits when clinically indicated. The subjects’ height and weight will be measured as outlined in Appendix A.  11.1.2 Physical Examinations  The physical examination will be performed at Screening, Day 56, and at any Unanticipated visit should one occur as outlined in Appendix A. The physical examination includes an assessment of general appearance and a review of systems (dermatologic, head, eyes, ears, nose, mouth/throat/neck, thyroid, lymph nodes, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, extremities, musculoskeletal, and neurologic systems).  
 
Protocol PRB244-[ADDRESS_788514] venipuncture techniques. Blood sampling will be performed according to the site SOPs.  The following laboratory variables will be determined as outlined below:  The following routine clinical chemistry, hematology and Lipid Panel will be performed according to Time and Events table (Appendix A): Albumin, Alkaline Phosphatase, ALT, AST, Total Bilirubin, BUN, BUN:Creatinine ratio, Calcium, Chloride, Creatinine, eGFR, Glucose, Potassium, Sodium, Uric Acid, Total Protein, Bicarbonate  Lipid Panel: HDL Cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, Total Cholesterol, Triglycerides, VLDL Cholesterol, LDL/HDL Cholesterol Ratio, Non-HDL Cholesterol.  Urinalysis: Color, clarity, pH, specific gravity, bilirubin, glucose, ketones, leukocytes, nitrite, blood, protein, urobilinogen, microscopic analysis.          Hematology: WBC, RBC, Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, Platelets, WBC Differential (Neutrophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Eosinophils, Basophils)  Serology will only be done at Screening: HIV Ab, HCV Ab, and HBsAg.   Pregnancy testing: All females of childbearing potential will have a local urine pregnancy test performed at specified visits.   Patients will be asked to fast for at least [ADDRESS_788515] deviation, minimum, and maximum of scores/values at all applicable time points and for all treatments in the ITT Population. 11.2.1 EASI Assessment An EASI score is used to measure the extent (area) and severity of atopic eczema (Eczema Area and Severity Index). The score will be calculated at the times indicated in the Time and Events Table (Appendix A). The investigator will assess improvement of eczema based on intensity and severity of the disease. EASI score sheet can be found in Appendix C.  The severity strata for the EASI are as follows:  0 = clear 0·1-1·0 = almost clear 1·1-7·0 = mild 7·1-21·0 = moderate 21·1-50·0 = severe 50·1-72·0 = very severe   11.2.2 Patient Oriented Eczema Measure The POEM is a tool developed by [CONTACT_596906], [LOCATION_008], for monitoring atopic dermatitis severity (Appendix D). The subject will complete the questionnaire at each of the assessment timepoints as outlined in Appendix A. Each of the 7 questions in the POEM questionnaire carries equal weight and is scored from 0 to 4: ● No days = 0. ● 1 to 2 days = 1. ● 3 to 4 days = 2. ● 5 to 6 days = 3. ● Every day = 4. Scores are then added to yield a total score of 0 to 28; higher scores mean the greater the severity of atopic dermatitis. 11.2.3 Itch Numeric Rating Scale The Itch NRS is a validated, self-reported instrument for measurement of itch intensity. It uses a 24-hour recall period and asks subjects to rate the intensity of their itch on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst itch imaginable). Higher scores indicate greater itch intensity. In this study, both worst itch intensity (WI-NRS) and average itch intensity (AI-NRS) during a 24-hour recall period will be captured. Subjects will record their Itch NRS scores once 
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 44  daily via eDiary throughout the screening, treatment, and follow-up periods, as outlined in Appendix A.  The question for WI-NRS would be, “Please rate the itching severity due to your atopic dermatitis by [CONTACT_596907] 24 hours.”  The question for AI-NRS would be, “Please rate the itching severity due to your atopic dermatitis by [CONTACT_596908] 24 hours.”  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  0 = No itching        10 = Worst itch imaginable  11.2.4 Investigator Global Assessment Score (IGA) IGA will be performed at the times indicated (Screening, Baseline, Day 14, Day 28, and Day 56) in the Time and Events Table of the Protocol (Appendix A) as static IGA. The Investigator will assess improvement of Atopic Dermatitis based on the 5-point severity scale summarized below and in Appendix E.     11.2.5 5-D Pruritus Scale The 5-D Pruritus Scale is a validated, multi-dimensional measure of itching that assesses the five domains of degree, duration, direction, disability and distribution (Appendix F). Subjects rate their symptoms over the preceding 2-week period on a [ADDRESS_788516] affected. Subjects will complete the 5-D Pruritus Scale during study visits as outlined in Appendix A.  11.3 eDiary and Efficacy Assessments All patient reported outcomes and clinical outcome assessments (ePRO/eCOA) will be obtained electronically using either a smartphone application or a tablet.  Participants will be provided with eDiary at screening to initiate daily diary entries from screening to follow-up and will include responses to WI-NRS, AI-NRS, daily dose confirmation (during the treatment period), 

 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 45  rescue medication (if any), and local skin tolerability (Day 1 to Day 7 of treatment).  In addition, participants’ usual adjunctive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (e.g., bland emollient, oral H-1 antihistamine) may be collected using eDiary or CRF at screening and optionally throughout the study.  POEM and 5-D Pruritus Scale will be reported by [CONTACT_596909] a site provided tablet.  IGA and EASI will also be assessed at the designated site visits by [CONTACT_15370]. 11.4 Patient Reported Local Tolerability Solicited local adverse reactions (e.g., itching, new rash, pain, tenderness, stinging, skin color change, etc.) and severity from subjects will be collected during the first week of treatment using eDiary with the questions outlined in Appendix G to inform local skin tolerability.  11.5 Pregnancy Reporting Any pregnancy will be reported by [CONTACT_596910]. Participants who report pregnancy or lactation during the review of inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to randomization will not be enrolled in the trial. In case of pregnancy, Investigational Product should be discontinued and the Sponsor informed. Follow-up of the pregnancy will be mandatory until the outcome is available.  11.6 Study Completion A completed participant is one who has completed all study visits. Day 56 study visit is defined as the participant’s last visit. 11.[ADDRESS_788517] may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request, or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the Investigator for safety, behavioral, or administrative reasons.  Reasons for withdrawal (subjects who refuse to return for any remaining study visits) or discontinuation (subjects who prematurely stop the application) at any time during the study may include, but are not limited, to the following:  ● For safety reasons, either at the discretion of the Investigator or at the subject’s request ● For protocol violations at the discretion of AOBiome ● Due to concomitant therapy that could interfere with the results of the study (the Investigator will report all such information on the CRFs and decide, in accordance with AOBiome, whether the subject is to be withdrawn).   All premature discontinuations and their causes must be carefully documented by [CONTACT_596911].    If, for any reason, a subject is withdrawn before completing the final visit, the reason for termination will be entered on the CRF.  All data gathered on the subject prior to termination will

For subjects who refuse to complete the assessments for their early termination, every attempt must be made to check on their status, using any mode of communication such as telephone, email, fax, or text.  12 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 12.1 Sample Size Approximately 576 subjects may be enrolled to account for 16.7% drop out rate prior to completing the study.  A total of 160 evaluable subjects per group (480 total) are required to achieve at least 80% power to detect a pairwise difference of 0.[ADDRESS_788519] deviation of 2.5 and applying a Dunnett Testing Method at a one-sided familywise error rate of 0.10.  12.2 Populations for Analysis Intent to Treat (ITT): All randomized participants who apply at least 1 dose of study medication. Subjects will be grouped as randomized.   Per Protocol: All subjects in the ITT population without any major protocol deviations that may have an impact on the efficacy assessments, who complete their Week [ADDRESS_788520] 50% of investigational product (IP). Subjects will be grouped as treated. Safety: All subjects who apply at least 1 dose of study medication. Subjects will be grouped as treated. 12.3 Data Analysis A separate statistical analysis plan will be developed. All data collected will be documented using summary tables, figures, and/or patient data listings. For continuous variables, descriptive statistics (number (n), mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum) will be presented. For categorical variables, frequencies and percentages will be presented. As appropriate, a 95% CI will be presented. Graphical displays will be presented, as appropriate.  Data will be presented by [CONTACT_6654]. Descriptive statistics for each treatment group will be provided for clinical laboratory values (e.g., hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis) and vital signs data, presented as both actual values and changes from baseline relative to each on-study evaluation. Abnormal clinical laboratory values will be listed.  
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 47  12.3.1 Disposition A tabulation of the disposition of subjects will be presented, including the number enrolled, the number randomized, the number treated, and the reasons for study discontinuation. Summaries of the number in each analysis set will be presented. Entry criteria violations and protocol deviations will be listed. 12.3.2 Demographic and Baseline Demographic and baseline characteristic data summarization will be performed in order to descriptively assess the comparability of treatment groups. Data to be tabulated will include age, race, ethnicity, height, weight, and BMI, as well as baseline characteristics related to medical history. 12.4 Safety Analyses 12.4.1 Definitions  All adverse events recorded during the study will be coded according to MedDRA.  12.4.2 Adverse Events  All adverse events (AEs) recorded during the study through the date of randomization through [ADDRESS_788521] dose of study drug will be analyzed.   Adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_596912] (MedDRA) system organ class and preferred term. Separate tabulations will be produced for all treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), treatment-related AEs (those considered by [CONTACT_192158]), SAEs, discontinuations due to AEs, and AEs ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_788522] listings will be provided for any deaths, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation.  AE’s will be summarized using incidence rates. Therefore, each subject will only contribute once for a given adverse event SOC or PT.   Any treatment emergent AEs related to local safety (e.g., erythema, edema, induration, vesiculation, etc.) will be collected by [CONTACT_596913].  In addition, solicited local adverse reactions (e.g., itching, new rash, pain, tenderness, stinging, skin color change, etc.) and severity from subjects will be collected during the first week of treatment using eDiary to inform local skin tolerability. A summary of the incidence of any adverse event, SAE, and adverse events leading to discontinuation will be presented.  Summaries will display, by [CONTACT_1570], the incidence of patients with events, the frequency of patients with events within each primary system organ class and by [CONTACT_73972]. For each preferred term and each system organ class a patient will 
 
Protocol PRB244-[ADDRESS_788523] be interpreted in an exploratory fashion. The primary endpoint of mean change from baseline to Week 4 in WI-NRS will be analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models.  In addition, continuous efficacy endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics at Baseline, Week 2, Week [ADDRESS_788524] variability and including visit (Baseline vs. Week 2, Week 4, Week 8), treatment group, visit-by-treatment interaction, and baseline value as explanatory variables.  Categorical variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics and analyzed using a logistic regression model at each respective timepoints.  Generalized estimating equations to account for repeated measures and within-subject variability may also be applied.  Supportive analyses may be performed combining the B244 dose groups in comparison against vehicle and comparison of the B244 groups to one another.       
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 49  12.6 Handling of dropouts or missing data  All available data will be analyzed.  The details for any imputations for missing data will be documented in the trial’s Statistical Analysis Plan.  Subjects who dropout after enrollment but prior to randomization will be replaced.   12.7 Clinical Trial Protocol deviations  At minimum, the following deviations will be summarized on the ITT patient population:   ● Inclusion or exclusion criteria not satisfied.  ● Deviations related to the Investigational Product administration  ● Not permitted concomitant medications.  13 ADVERSE EVENTS (AE) AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE) The Investigator and study staff are responsible for detecting and recording AEs and SAEs during scheduled safety evaluations and whenever such information is brought to their attention. This section of the protocol provides definitions and detailed procedures to be followed.  13.[ADDRESS_788525].  An AE, therefore, can be any unfavorable or unintended sign, including an abnormal symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated), whether or not related to the investigational product (IP).    Examples of an AE include: ● Exacerbation of a pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. ● New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product administration even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study. ● Signs, symptoms of a drug interaction. ● Signs, symptoms of a suspected overdose of either investigational product or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE/SAE).  AEs may include pre- or post-treatment events that occur as a result of protocol-mandated procedures (i.e., modification of participant’s previous therapeutic regimen).  13.[ADDRESS_788526] medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 50  a) results in death. b) is life-threatening. NOTE:  The term 'life-threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  c) requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. NOTE:  In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19949] (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or out -patient setting.  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084].  If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. Routine hospi[INVESTIGATOR_276914].   d) results in disability/incapacity NOTE:  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  e) is a congenital anomaly/birth defect f) Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22772].  These should also be considered serious.  Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 13.[ADDRESS_788527] resolved, this should be documented.  Changes in intensity or frequency of AEs should be recorded as separate events (i.e., a new record started).  The recording of AEs and SAEs are described in Section 13.4 (“Recording of AEs and SAEs”).  13.4 Recording of AEs and SAEs All clinical events, including either observed or volunteered problems, complaints or symptoms are to be recorded on the Adverse Events page(s) of the CRF.  The need to capture this information is not dependent upon whether the clinical event is associated with study treatment. Adverse clinical events resulting from concurrent illnesses or reactions to concurrent medications are also to be recorded.  In order to avoid vague, ambiguous, or colloquial expressions, the AE should be recorded in standard medical terminology rather than the participant’s own words.  Each adverse clinical event is to be evaluated for duration, intensity, and whether the event may be associated with the investigational product (IP) or other causes.  Start and stop dates, relationship to investigational product (IP), medical management, and alternative causality of event must be recorded in the Adverse Events section of the CRF.  AEs believed to be possibly related to investigational product (IP) must be followed until resolution.  13.5 Evaluating AEs and SAEs  13.5.1 Severity Rating The severity of an adverse event (AE and SAE) is to be scored according to the following scale: Mild Awareness of symptoms, but easily tolerated Moderate Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity Severe Incapacitating with inability to work or perform usual activity An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with a SAE.  An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre-defined outcomes as described in Section 13.2 “Definition of a SAE”.  13.5.[ADDRESS_788528] (IP)  SAEs will be classified as “not related” or “related” (including unknown).   
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 52  For AEs, the relationship to study treatment is to be assessed according to the following definitions: Definitely not related: The AE is definitely not related to the drug.  This designation should be reserved for those events which occur prior to study treatment or for those events which cannot be even remotely related to study participation (e.g., injuries sustained in an automobile accident).  Unlikely related: There is no reasonable association between the study treatment and the suspected event and the event could have been produced by [CONTACT_2299] 's clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to the participant.  Possibly related:  The suspected adverse event may or may not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from study treatment administration but seems to be the type of reaction that cannot be dismissed as unlikely.  The event could have been produced or mimicked by [CONTACT_2299] 's clinical state or by [CONTACT_596914].  Probably related: The suspected adverse event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study treatment administration, abates upon discontinuation of the treatment, and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_82977] 's clinical state.  Definitely related: This designation should be reserved for those events which have no uncertainty in their relationship to treatment administration.  13.[ADDRESS_788529] occur to determine the outcome of the pregnancy (including premature termination) and the status of mother and child.  Pregnancy complications and elective terminations for medical reasons must be reported as AEs or SAEs.  Spontaneous abortions must be reported as an SAE.  Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy and considered by [CONTACT_596915], even if the event occurred after the participant completed the study.  The Investigator must attempt to collect pregnancy information on any female partners of male participants who become pregnant while the male participant is enrolled in the study. Pregnancy information must be reported to the Sponsor as described above.  13.[ADDRESS_788530] immediately:  ● SEND (within 1 working day) the signed and dated SAE Report Form to the Safety Team or to a designated Safety email or fax number provided by [CONTACT_596916];  ● ATTACH a photocopy of all examinations carried out and the dates on which these examinations were performed. Care should be taken to ensure that the patient's identity is protected and the patient's identifiers in the Clinical Trial are properly documented on all copi[INVESTIGATOR_276915]. For laboratory results, include the laboratory normal ranges;  ● Follow-up of any Serious Adverse Event that is fatal or life threatening should be provided within one additional calendar week. The treatment code will be unblinded for reporting of Serious Adverse Events that are unexpected and determined to be related to the use of the Investigational Product.  Follow-up  ● The Investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the patients, including referral to a specialist if indicated. Notably the Investigator should follow up the outcome of any adverse events (clinical signs, laboratory values or other, etc.) until the return to normal or stabilization of the patient's condition;  ● In the case of any Serious Adverse Event, the patient must be followed up until clinical recovery is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized. This implies that follow-up may continue after the patient has left the Clinical Trial and that additional investigations may be requested by [CONTACT_596916];  ● In case of any Serious Adverse Event brought to the attention of the Investigator at any time after cessation of Investigational Product and considered by [CONTACT_596917], this should be reported to the Safety Team.

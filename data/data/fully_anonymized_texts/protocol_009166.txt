Omalizumab in CIU  May 29, 2019    Study Design              This is a Phase IV, single-site study that will examine blood cells or tissue obtained from CIU patients receiving open-label treatment with omalizumab at the current FDA-approved dose of 300 mg/month for [ADDRESS_382565] therapy with anti-histamines. Results from the 3 Phase III studies in CIU patients provide evidence that a meaningful change in symptoms is apparent at 1-2 wks. The MID (Minimal Important Difference) is achieved by 70% of patients by [ADDRESS_382566] of three phases.  Screening Visit (Week -3 to Week-2)-establish compliance with diary and review safety labs.  Standard therapy Run-in (Week -2 to Day 0)    Open-label Treatment Period (Day 0 to Week 12)   During the screening period (Week -3 to Week -2), each patient’s eligibility for the trial will be established. To be eligible at the screening visit (Week -1), subjects must:  1) Be 18 years of age or older  2) Have a diagnosis of moderate to severe CIU, as defined by [CONTACT_311039] > 3 days in a 7-day period for > 6 consecutive weeks despi[INVESTIGATOR_12847] H1 antihistamine:  Must have a non-diary based daily urticaria activity score (UAS) score ≥ 2 established in the outpatient setting based on the patient’s condition over 12 hours prior to the visit; the UAS is a composite score of pruritus (0–3) and number of hives (0–3) with a maximum value of 6. This requirement may be met either at screening visit, run-in visit (Week -2), or beginning of treatment (Day 0).  Must have been on an approved dose of an H1 antihistamine for CIU such as loratidine [ADDRESS_382567] be willing to fill out a twice-daily patient-diary to establish the patient’s Urticaria Activity Score 7 (UAS7) score. The UAS is a composite diary- recorded score with numeric severity intensity ratings (0 = none to 3 = intense) for 1) the number of wheals (hives); and 2) the intensity of the pruritus (itch). The UAS7 is the sum of the daily average UAS scores (average of a.m. and p.m.) for 7 days. The maximum UAS7 value is 42.   To be eligible to begin the run-in period (Week -2 to Day 0), the patients:  Must have a UAS7 score ≥ [ADDRESS_382568] remain on stable dose of a H1 antihistamines (not including antihistamine rescue medication) as established at the screening visit.   During the run-in period, patients will establish their baseline symptom scores using the diary. Patients with a diary-based UAS7 symptom score ≥ 16 during the screening or run-in periods  will be eligible to enter the 12-week open treatment period.  The baseline UAS7 score at time of treatment (Day 0) must be calculated using the diary scores for 7 days.  Only in rare circumstances, (pending lab studies, in clinic UAS score < 2) will a longer screening period be permitted.   On the first day of the treatment period (Day 0), eligible patients will receive [ADDRESS_382569] diary, blood work, non-lesional skin biopsy and safety data.

Study Duration 15 months (including recruitment) Primary Endpoint The time to meaningful change in diary-based clinical symptoms as measured by [CONTACT_311040] (Wk -7 to Day -1) to the date at which an MID (5 point change in weekly UAS 7) or achievement of > 50% reduction in daily symptom score for [ADDRESS_382570] week. The UAS score, which is the sum of pruritus and hives, will be used to calculate the UAS7. The UAS7 score obtained 1 week prior to randomization will be used as the baseline.    Secondary Endpoints  Change in the weekly pruritus score from baseline to the 12th week in the treatment period. The pruritus score will be measured twice daily (a.m. and p.m.), on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (intense). The weekly pruritus score is the sum of average daily pruritus scores over the previous 7 days.  Change in the weekly score for number of hives from baseline to the 12th week in the treatment period. The number of hives is measured twice daily (a.m. and p.m.), on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (> 12 hives, see below). The weekly score of number of hives is the sum of the average daily scores over the previous 7 days.  Scoring for Wheals 0= None 1= Mild 1-6 hives/12 hours 2= Moderate 7-12 hives/12 hours 3= Severe > 12 hives/12 hours  Scoring for Itch 0= None 1= Mild 2= Moderate 3= Severe   Change in the amount of rescue medication (diphenhydramine 25 mg) from baseline to the 12th week in the treatment period using the question on the rescue medication use in the patient diary.

[ADDRESS_382580] up to 25% of the US population during their lifetime (1, 2). While many short-lived, urticarial reactions have identifiable causes such as allergens or infections, there is a large class of reactions for which the underlying cause is unknown (3). Recurrent urticaria for greater than 6 weeks is termed chronic urticaria (CU), and in the vast majority of cases (>90%) no trigger is found and thus is termed chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU). The annual prevalence of CIU is approximately 1% (4, 5).  CIU is a widely recognized disorder in multiple continents (North America, Asia, Europe) and multiple disease guidelines have been issued in these various regions supporting the global burden of this ailment (6-9). CIU also affects both children and adults and nearly twice as many females in the adult population (4, 10-14). Although CIU skin reactions are rarely life-threatening and are limited in duration for an average of 2-3 years in 80% of cases, the pruritus that accompanies the disease has an impact on quality of life that is similar to heart disease (15). Mechanisms active in CIU   It is well-accepted that CIU subjects suffer from recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_311011] (16). The pathology observed in CIU lesional skin biopsies, is of mast cells that are degranulated and presence of skin infiltrating basophils, and blood basopenia (17, 18). However, the identifiable triggers for these two cells remain unknown. The skin pathology in CIU lesions closely resemble that found in skin biopsies of allergen triggered skin late-phase reactions but lacks an identifiable trigger (19, 20). Over the last decades, two theories have been explored for the cause of this condition. The first suggests an autoimmune trigger for either mast cells or basophils and the second focuses on the cell that might be controlling the reaction, the mast cell or the basophil. In the 1980s it was noted that there was a higher frequency of thyroid autoantibodies among CIU patients as compared to the normal population (21). This observation gave rise to the idea that autoimmunity may also be a trigger for CIU lesions given the absence of external triggers. Subsequently, a subset of CIU patients was identified with circulating IgG anti-IgE (5-10% of patients) or anti-FcεRI antibodies  (35-40 % of patients) (22, 23). This seemed a remarkable discovery since either type of antibody could be the trigger for driving secretion from either mast cells or basophils. However, additional studies have raised a number of issues with this explanation such as (3, 24): 1) the lack of specificity of autoantibodies for CIU given that such IgG antibodies occur in other skin diseases, SLE, RA and healthy subjects 2) antibody titers are stable in remission and do not follow disease symptoms 3) the lack of distinct clinical phenotype, skin biopsy, or therapeutic response in those with autoantibodies 4) the lack of a standardized autoantibody detection assay despi[INVESTIGATOR_311012]. The success of omalizumab (Xolair, anti-IgE antibody) therapy in CIU patients provides support that this disease depends on IgE dependent pathways. However, the clinical response kinetics to omalizumab therapy did not differ among the subset of CIU subjects (25-30%) with serologic evidence of functional autoantibodies (CIU Index assay-basophil histamine release assay), raising questions about the pathogenic role of such autoantibodies (25-27). The second area of 
Protocol            Version 1.[ADDRESS_382581] is the role of the basophil (28).  The blood basophil is selectively recruited to the skin lesions of CIU patients and is capable of secreting histamine that can drive the skin reaction, yet it is hard to reconcile with the long-standing view that the skin mast cell drives the disease (29). But studies have shown that IgE-mediated basophil reactivity tracks well with the remissions and exacerbations of this disease (30-32). We have identified 2 patterns of basophil reactivity based on the degree of histamine release after optimal IgE receptor activation: CIU-non-responders (CIU NR) which release less than 10% of total cellular content and CIU-responders (CIU-R) which release greater than 10% of histamine content (33). We have established the stability of these 2 functional phenotypes in active disease and improvement with disease remission (30, 32).  Blood basopenia is a unique feature of this disorder since it was first reported in the 1960’s (34). Evidence also exists that blood basopenia is related to disease severity and improves with symptom improvement and in remission (31, 32, 35). Indeed, the concordance between basophil functionality and the disease is far better than the relationship between the presence of autoantibodies and disease (30). Further, systemic corticosteroids rapi[INVESTIGATOR_311013], but not skin mast cell degranulation.  Systemic corticosteroids therapy leads to a rise in blood basophil numbers in CIU whereas in normal subjects basophil numbers fall (35), favoring the idea that steroids impair basophil migration to the CIU skin lesions.   While skin mast cell degranulation is generally accepted in CIU, the trigger remains unclear. Evidence supports that skin mast cell numbers are not increased in skin biopsies (18, 36-38) and serum tryptase levels, an indicator of total body mast cell number, are within the normal range (39, 40). Older studies support that increased skin mast cell releasability to stimuli such as 48/80 and codeine (41, 42) occurs in CIU. Recently, MrgX2 has been identified as the receptor for numerous stimuli (48/80, codeine, and multiple drugs) on human and murine mast cells (43). A recent report has identified increased MrgX2 in skin mast cells in CIU(38).  Without a clear mechanism or knowledge of the principle cell type responsible for CIU disease, treatments are relegated to symptomatic relief (44). The purpose of this proposed research is to determine what cell type(s) strongly influence expression of this disease. This will be done by [CONTACT_311045], a monoclonal IgG anti-IgE therapeutic antibody, into the treatment regimen for CIU (25-27, 45).  Omalizumab therapy in CIU 	Omalizumab has shown success in H1 refractory CIU cases and was approved by [CONTACT_163881] 2014 for this indication. It has undergone 3 Phase III studies that support a fixed dose of 150 mg or 300 mg every 4 weeks is effective in 70% of anti-histamine refractory CIU recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (25-27). However, it carries the high costs of a biologic agent, requires subcutaneous injection in a physician’s office, and requires an Epi[INVESTIGATOR_311014]-related anaphylaxis of 0.2%. The efficacy of omalizumab therapy in CIU has raised questions as to the role of IgE in this non-allergic skin disease. A recent study has shown changes in blood basophils but not skin mast cells at an early timepoint associated with clinical symptom improvement. The results for omalizumab have been surprising. The surprise occurs at two levels, first, that an anti-IgE therapeutic would have such dramatic effects in this disease and second, that the effects occur so rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] (25-27, 45, 46).

Omalizumab in CIU  May 29, 2019    70% of CIU subjects treated with 300 mg/month omalizumab for [ADDRESS_382582] a 70% reduction in their pretreatment UAS7 (Urticaria Activity Score for 7 days: scale is 0-3 for itch and 0-3 for number of hives; maximal daily score is 6 (average of AM and PM scores), and maximum UAS7 is 42); 60% will have an 80% reduction in symptoms (UAS7< 6), and 40% are fully asymptomatic (UAS7=0) (47). The MID (Minimal Important Difference) is achieved by 70% of patients by 2 weeks in patients on multiple drugs for hives versus a median time of 4-5 weeks on placebo injections (26). Therefore, this protocol is designed to make an assessment of the clinical symptoms at a high frequency in the early [ADDRESS_382583]-line oral, non-sedating antihistamines (48). This is important because up to 50% of patients fail to respond to a non-sedating oral antihistamine (49).  Current guideline recommended add-on therapi[INVESTIGATOR_31430] H2 blockers, leukotriene receptor antagonists, older generation sedating antihistamines (48). In more severe CIU cases, systemic steroids are recommended and in steroid-dependent cases, there are several other agents that have been reported to be beneficial such as cyclosporine, sulfasalazine, dapsone, plaquenil, and mycophenolate mofetil but all carry significant toxicities and require frequent, costly laboratory monitoring (CBC, renal function, G6PD)(50, 51).  Thus, there is an unmet need to improve the understanding of the pathogenesis of CIU to lead to improved, less toxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].     Rationale for Selection of Study Population  Results from the 3 Phase III studies in CIU provide evidence that a meaningful change in symptoms is apparent at 1-2 weeks (25-27). The MID (Minimal Important Difference) is achieved by 70% of patients by 2 weeks in patients on multiple drugs for hives versus a median time of 4-5 weeks on placebo injections (26). Therefore, this protocol is designed to make an assessment of the clinical symptoms at a high frequency in the early 2 weeks during treatment along with the blood and skin tissue biopsy studies. The goal is to identify which cell type(s) strongly influence expression of this disease using a monoclonal therapeutic anti-IgE antibody that is FDA approved in CIU subjects not controlled on treatment with anti-histamines.  Intervention(s)  Omalizumab is a recombinant DNA-derived humanized IgG1κ monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to human immunoglobulin E (IgE). The antibody has a molecular weight of approximately [ADDRESS_382584].  
Protocol            Version 1.3                                                      Page 20 of 80   
Omalizumab in CIU  May 29, 2019    Rationale for Selection of Intervention(s) and Regimen   We propose a single-site study with 12 weeks of open label therapy with omalizumab 300 mg/month with no placebo arm. We favor the higher dose of approved drug given it’s faster onset of clinical benefit and open label therapy to gain the greatest possible participation from eligible subjects given the widespread knowledge of the efficacy of omalizumab in CIU. Omalizumab is currently FDA approved, and a standard of care option for patients who have anti-histamine refractory urticaria. We propose to treat for [ADDRESS_382585] cell IgE receptors expression based on prior studies  after 8 weeks (52). This is a study of the kinetics of clinical symptom relief during treatment with omalizumab of patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria. The purpose is to determine whether the rate of clinical remission is concordant with the rate that IgE-dependent functions of basophil change during treatment. In addition, skin mast cell expression of FcεRI and IgE in the non-lesional skin will be monitored to determine if the rate of change in these two parameters is consistent with prior measurements (52) or uniquely faster in these individuals. Previous studies of omalizumab therapy in CIU have not examined the changes in cellular functions with a temporal granularity being proposed in this study. Notably, the earliest assessment of basophil functions in previous studies occurred at [ADDRESS_382586] patients (53). We are interested in judging whether the kinetics for early clinical symptoms matches the changes to the blood basophil phenotype. Other IgE-bearing cell types known to be impacted by [CONTACT_311046]. We have previously shown that these cells change in allergic patients in a time-frame similar to basophils. IgE receptor function of dendritic cells includes impacting their ability to release various cytokines induced by [CONTACT_311047]. To date, TLR9 receptors activation of pDCs is impaired in subjects with CIU(54).  In addition, we will examine whether IgE receptor alteration of skin mast cells via omalizumab has an impact on MrgX2 expression. Our proposed hypothesis is that omalizumab in CIU will reduce IgE levels and IgE receptor bearing leukocyte expression in a time dependent fashion with clinical symptom improvement and most rapi[INVESTIGATOR_311015] (basophils) implicated in disease pathogenesis thus reducing the signs and symptoms in CIU refractory to control with antihistamines.   Clinical Studies  Omalizumab has undergone extensive clinical trials in subjects with allergic asthma and chronic idiopathic urticaria. It is currently FDA approved for both of these indications with allergic asthma approval occurring in 2003 and CIU in 2014.  In the clinical studies completed in subjects with chronic uriticaria, omalizumab was generally well tolerated(25-27). Dose ranging studies identified that flat dosing schedule was efficacious with maximal efficacy seen at [ADDRESS_382587] study tested only the 300 mg dose or placebo injection every 4 weeks for 24-week studies in patients refractory to usual CIU care per guidelines (up to 4 –fold standard dose of non-sedating antihistamines, ± H2 blocker, ± leukotriene receptor antagonists.).  All three studies demonstrated efficacy in reducing the UAS7 score and weekly itch score. Differences between treatment groups for secondary variables (weekly hive score, angioedema) also favored either the 150 mg or 300 mg dose of omalizumab . As per the PI, the mechanism of action, besides lowering IgE receptors through binding of IgE, remains unknown.  Risks Risks of Intervention(s)  Omalizumab:  In CIU patients ≥[ADDRESS_382588] commonly observed adverse reactions: from 3 placebo-controlled CIU studies for omalizumab 150 mg and 300 mg, respectively, were: headache (12%, 6%), nasopharyngitis (9%, 7%), arthralgia (3%, 3%), viral upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] (2%, 1%), nausea (1%, 3%), sinusitis (1%, 5%), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (1%, 3%), and cough (1%, 2%). Injection site reactions of any severity occurred during the trials in more omalizumab treated patients;[2.7%] at 300 mg, [0.6%] at 150 mg) compared with 0.8% in  placebo-treated patients.   Anaphylaxis has been reported to occur after administration of omalizumab in asthma clinical trials and in postmarketing spontaneous reports. The frequency of anaphylaxis was estimated to at least 0.2%. A case-control study showed that among XOLAIR users, patients with a history of anaphylaxis to foods, medications, or other causes were at increased risk of anaphylaxis associated with XOLAIR, compared to those with no prior history of anaphylaxis. Based on this, AAAAI guidelines support monitoring patients for [ADDRESS_382589] 3 injections of xolair and the prescription of an epi[INVESTIGATOR_311016].   Malignant neoplasms were observed in 20 of 4127 (0.5%) omalizumab treated patients compared with 5 of 2236 (0.2%) control patients in clinical studies of adults and adolescents (≥12 years of age) with asthma and other allergic disorders. The observed malignancies in XOLAIR-treated patients were a variety of types, with breast, non-melanoma skin, prostate, melanoma, and parotid occurring more than once, and five other types occurring once each. A subsequent 5-year observational study of [ADDRESS_382590] reaction or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen found that the incidence rates of primary malignancies (per 1000 patient years) were similar in both groups (12.3 vs 13.0, respectively) ( Package Insert).    Risk of Study Procedures  Phlebotomy: pain, bruising, infection, light-headedness and fainting.  The American Red Cross recommends that no more than 480 mL of blood be donated in a 2 month time period.  The maximum blood that would be drawn in a 2-month period in the primary outcome study is 436 mL over 9 separate blood draws, whereas the total volume drawn is 515 over 90 days.  At no

Omalizumab in CIU  May 29, 2019    time will Red Cross guidelines be exceeded.  Further, CBCs will be drawn at baseline for safety monitoring and at the end of week 12.  Skin biopsy: Risks of skin punch biopsy include pain, swelling, bleeding, bruising, infection, and scarring at the site of the biopsy.  Allergic reactions to lidocaine are rare, but may cause hives, itching, asthma, hay fever, or a drop in blood pressure.  Significant bleeding from biopsy sites is rare.  Infection of a biopsy site is unusual, but may occur.  A scar the size of a pencil eraser will result at the biopsy site.  This scar will be slightly raised or depressed below the surface of the skin and will be a little lighter or darker than the rest of your skin. Risk of Concomitant Medications, Prophylactic Medications and Rescue Medications  Antihistamines (concomitant medications allowed during study) may cause sedation, dizziness, coordination problems, and dried mucous membranes.  Diphenhydramine (Rescue medication) may cause sedation.  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_130530]  (Rescue medicine). The most common side effects include increase in heart rate, stronger or irregular heartbeat, sweating, nausea and vomiting, difficulty breathing, paleness, dizziness, weakness or shakiness, headache, apprehension, nervousness or anxiety. These side effects usually go away quickly. Benefits of Intervention(s)  The patients treated with omalizumab are expected to experience decreased urticarial symptoms. These benefits are not expected to be maintained after treatment discontinuation.  The benefits may begin at any point during treatment. There are no known benefits of the study procedures in the general population or in subjects with CIU.

Omalizumab in CIU  May 29, 2019    OBJECTIVES Primary Objective(s)  This is a study of the kinetics of clinical symptom relief during treatment of patients with CIU with omalizumab. The purpose is to determine if the rate of clinical remission is concordant with the rate that IgE-dependent functions of basophil change. We propose as the primary outcome as the time for change in the functional response from baseline of basophil in vitro anti-IgE for histamine release (defined as a 2-fold rise at suboptimal concentrations of anti-IgE) relative to the time to reach MID of > [ADDRESS_382591] subjects with baseline basophil CIU-NR (non-responder) phenotype to become Responders and baseline Responder phenotype to demonstrate a rise the in suboptimal anti-IgE response.   Secondary Objective(s)  1.Change in the weekly pruritus score from baseline to the 12th week in the treatment period. The pruritus score will be measured twice daily (a.m. and p.m.), on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (intense). The weekly pruritus score is the sum of average daily pruritus scores over the previous 7 days.  2. Change in the weekly score for number of hives from baseline to the 12th week in the treatment period. The number of hives is measured twice daily (a.m. and p.m.), on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (> 12 hives, see below). The weekly score of number of hives is the sum of the average daily scores over the previous 7 days.  Scoring for Wheals 0= None 1= Mild 1-6 hives/12 hours 2= Moderate 7-12 hives/12 hours 3= Severe > 12 hives/12 hours  Scoring for Itch 0= None 1= Mild 2= Moderate 3= Severe   3. Change in the amount of rescue medication (diphenhydramine 25 mg) from baseline to the 12th week in the treatment period using the question on the rescue medication use in the patient diary.  4. Change in SKINDEX29 quality of life survey instrument with 29 questions on a 5-point Likert will be given at baseline and again at 90 days.

CIU patients will receiving open-label treatment with omalizumab at the current FDA-approved dose of 300 mg/month for [ADDRESS_382594] participation from eligible subjects given the widespread knowledge of the efficacy of omalizumab in CIU. Results from the 3 Phase III studies in CIU provide evidence that a meaningful change in symptoms is apparent at 1-2 wks. The MID (Minimal Important Difference) is achieved by 70% of patients by [ADDRESS_382595] a baseline UAS score of 2 or greater despi[INVESTIGATOR_311017]-sedating H1 antihistamines. The UAS is a composite score of pruritus (0-3) and hives (0-3) with a maximum value of 6. This study will include a 2-week run-in. The study will enroll 30 patients.

Omalizumab in CIU  May 29, 2019     During the screening period, each patient’s eligibility for the trial will be established. To be eligible at the screening visit (Week -3), patients:  Must have a non-diary based daily urticaria activity score (UAS) score ≥ 2 established in the outpatient setting based on the patient’s condition over 12 hours prior to the visit; the UAS is a composite score of pruritus (0–3) and number of hives (0–3) with a maximum value of 6. This requirement may be met either at screening day, run-in visit (Day -14), or Day 0.  Must have been on an approved dose of an H1 antihistamine for CIU such as loratadine [ADDRESS_382597] be willing to fill out a twice-daily patient-diary to establish the patient’s Urticaria Activity Score 7 (UAS7) score. The UAS is a composite diary- recorded score with numeric severity intensity ratings (0 = none to 3 = intense) for 1) the number of wheals (hives); and 2) the intensity of the pruritus (itch). The UAS7 is the sum of the daily average UAS scores (average of a.m. and p.m.) for 7 days. The maximum UAS7 value is 42.    Run-in (Day -14  to Day 0)    To be eligible to begin the run-in period (Day -14 to 0), patients:  Must have a UAS7 score ≥ [ADDRESS_382598] remain on stable dose of a single H1 antihistamine at approved dose (not including antihistamine rescue medication) as established at the screening visit.   During the run-in period, patients will establish their baseline symptom scores using the diary. Patients with a diary-based UAS7 symptom score ≥ 16 during the screening or run-in periods  will be eligible to enter the 12-week open label treatment period.  The baseline UAS7 score at time of drug treatment (Day 0) must be calculated using the diary scores for [ADDRESS_382599] drug treatment visit. Only in rare circumstances, (pending lab studies, in clinic UAS score < 2) will a longer screening period be permitted.   Open Label Treatment Period (Day 0 to Week 12) At Day 0 of treatment, eligible patients will be give 300 mg of omalizumab SQ every 4 weeks for a total of 12 weeks ( 3 injections) . Efficacy, safety, and pharmacodynamic (PD) data will be collected. The primary endpoint will be measured at the time of meaningful change in UAS7 expected to occur within 1-[ADDRESS_382600] remain on stable doses of their pre-determined CIU H1 antihistamine treatment.

Omalizumab in CIU  May 29, 2019     Adverse Events  This section defines the types of adverse events and outlines the procedures for appropriately collecting, grading, recording, and reporting them.  Information in this section complies with ICH Guideline E2A: Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting and ICH E6: Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and applies the standards set forth in the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (Aug. 9, 2006).  The Investigators conducting this trial have reviewed these criteria and consider them appropriate for this subject population.   Steps included in the protocol to enhance patient safety are as follows: Subjects will receive omalizumab in room 3B. [ADDRESS_382621] previously conducted several studies of CIU with omalizumab in this research space and are experienced in this administration and safety monitoring. In clinical care, omalizumab is approved since 2003 and has been given to > 100,000 pts using a similar practice of administration. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/ or study nurse is present during the dosing observation period of [ADDRESS_382622]. The XOLAIR(r) (omalizumab) Events of Special Interest are: - Anaphylaxis -       Drug-induced liver injury -       Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_311053], symptom, abnormal laboratory finding, or disease that is temporally associated with participation in this study whether considered related to the study or not.  Any adverse event that occurs from the moment the subject has signed the consent form will be recorded and is reportable.  An adverse event will be followed until any of the following takes place:  a) it is resolved, b) participant is stable, c) a minimum of 30 days after participant is terminated from the study or d) the Medical Monitor and the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_311024]-up is complete.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Definitions An SAE is defined as “any adverse event occurring at any dose that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution.” This includes but is not limited to any of the following events: 
Protocol            Version 1.[ADDRESS_382623].  Regardless of the relationship of the adverse event to the study, the event will be reported as an SAE if it meets any of the above definitions.  ‘Expected’ verses ‘Unexpected’ Adverse Event Definition A suspected adverse reaction is considered “expected” when it is listed in the investigator brochure, the package insert or the protocol. An adverse event is considered “unexpected” when its nature or severity is not consistent with the information that is provided in the Package insert, and/or this protocol (Section 0).  Management of Adverse Events Collecting Procedure Adverse events may be discovered through any of these methods: Observing the participant. Questioning the participant, with standardized questions at the beginning (except Visit 1) and the end of all study visits. Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the participant. An abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation (e.g., a radiograph, an ultrasound, or an electrocardiogram) can also indicate an adverse event.    
Protocol            Version 1.[ADDRESS_382624]  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_311025].  Grading and Attribution  GRADING CRITERIA In addition to determining whether an adverse event fulfills criteria for a serious adverse event or not, the severity of adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_311054]’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 3.0 (published Aug. 9, 2006).  This document (referred to herein as the NCI-CTCAE manual) provides a common language to describe levels of severity, to analyze and interpret data, and to articulate the clinical significance of all adverse events.  Adverse events listed in the NCI-CTCAE will be graded on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the following standards in the NCI-CTCAE manual:  Grade 1 = Mild adverse event. Grade 2 = Moderate adverse event. Grade 3 = Severe and undesirable adverse event.  Grade 4 = Life-threatening or disabling adverse event. Grade 5 = Death.  Adverse events not included in the NCI-CTCAE listing, which have relative specificity for this protocol will be recorded and graded 1 to 5 according to the grade definition provided below:

Omalizumab in CIU  May 29, 2019    SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATIONS AND STATISTICAL PLAN Sample Size and Power Calculations The sample size will be determined based on power calculations for the primary endpoint. The primary endpoint for the study utilizes the Urticaria Activity Score 7. This is a composite of a daily score of 0-3 for hives and 0-3 for itch with a maximal daily score of 6 and maximum weekly score of 42. Based on the Phase III study results with omalizumab in CIU, the baseline scores were UAS7=[ADDRESS_382627] deviation of 7 in approximately 300 subjects completing run-in evaluation (25). Given that the minimally important difference based on this scoring system is 5 (55), we estimated the number of subjects needed for the present study. In that study, the 1-week test-retest correlation coefficient for UAS7 was 0.74. We have thus conservatively estimated the 4-week test-retest correlation to be 0.5. A sample size of [ADDRESS_382628] a clinically relevant difference of 5 units of UAS7 with 80% power and 5% alpha error.   We are guided in our design by [CONTACT_311056], past studies of kinetics and function reported for basophil receptor changes, and our knowledge of two equally distributed functional basophil subsets.   Based on pooled Phase III CIU trial results with omalizumab for 300 mg/monthly for 12 weeks (Maurer EAACI 2014), approximately 70% of CIU subjects have a 70% reduction in UAS7 and 40% are fully asymptomatic (UAS7=0). The median time to achieve an MID response is [ADDRESS_382629] dose anti-histamine therapy (25, 27), and 2 weeks for patients maintaining multiple therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (4-fold standard dose antihistamines, ± LTRA, ± H2 blockers)(26) as compared to a median of 4-5 weeks for those treated with placebo. Overall, 70% of treated subjects across all phase III studies achieved an MID for itch score at week 2.   The worst-case scenario is that 30% percent of our omalizumab treated CIU subjects will not have a meaningful change in symptoms by [ADDRESS_382630] a 20% dropout, we would expect [ADDRESS_382631] a significant clinical response (roughly 50/50 distribution for basophil subsets, CIU R and NR). Our plan is to look at multiple cellular parameters in treated patients and relate cellular changes to the timing of the MID for itch (>5 points) or hives (> 5 points) with the primary outcome being the percentage achieving a 50% rise in basophil anti-IgE functions at the time of reaching a clinical MID. We have also considered the concerns of basopenia, which may interfere with meaningful assessments through the study or allow reasonable collection of basophils for mRNA studies. Our longitudinal study involving active CIU subjects (n=164, with repeated sampling of basophil measures) reveals that 12-15% of individuals had extreme basopenia (56). We also expect that omalizumab therapy will yield an increase in circulating blood basophil presence. We have documented a 40-50% increase in blood basophils in Phase III study participants after 12 weeks therapy with monthly 300 mg injections (Saini, 2014 AAAAI meeting).

Omalizumab in CIU  May 29, 2019    Data Analysis Study Participant Baseline Characteristics and Demographics Summary descriptive statistics for baseline and demographic characteristics will be provided for all enrolled participants.  Demographic data will include age, race, sex, body weight, and height; these data will be presented in the following manner: Continuous data (i.e., age, body weight, and height) will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_8477], standard deviation, median, and range.   Categorical data (i.e., sex and race) will be presented as enumerations and percentages. The Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used to before and after treatment if a non-Gaussian distributed of data is generated; otherwise, if the data are normally distributed, and paired t test will be used.  Wilcoxon singed rank tests will be used to compare continuous variables and Fisher's exact tests will be used to compare categorical variables.  The level of significance employed will be 0.05.  Relationships between the primary efficacy variable and various in vitro and in vivo variables in will be explored using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient or the Spearman rank correlation coefficient, as appropriate.  Summary statistics will be reported for all secondary efficacy variables.  Continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_19462], mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.  Discrete variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_22977].     Primary Endpoint Analysis The primary endpoint analysis is treated patients and relate cellular changes to the timing of the MID for itch (>5 points) or hives (> 5 points) with the primary outcome being the percentage achieving a 50% rise in basophil anti-IgE functions at the time of reaching a clinical MID.  Diary entries for itch and/or hive a.m./p.m. scores may be missing for some days. These missing scores will be imputed using the average of available corresponding scores in that week.  Patients whose post-baseline diaries are completely missing will not be included in the analysis.  Secondary Endpoint Analyses  This study is not designed or powered to perform hypothesis testing on secondary endpoints. All secondary analyses will be treated as supportive. P-values will be presented for the secondary endpoints but will not be adjusted for multiplicity and should be interpreted with caution.

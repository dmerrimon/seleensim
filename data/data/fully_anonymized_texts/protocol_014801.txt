1.0 BACKGROUND, RATIONALE  
• There is a large unmet need for substance -use disorder (SUD) treatment in the U.S. In 2015, 20.4 
million adults in the U.S. (8.4 % of all adults) needed treatment for an illicit drug or alcohol use 
problem; of these, 18.1 million did not receive it.  1  The consequences of untreated SUDs are 
enormous: premature death, billions of dollars in avoidable health care and criminal justice 
costs, decreased economic productivity, individual  suffering, and long -term harmful effects on 
families and communities.  2-6  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_71048] (OAUDs)  are of particular 
concern because of high rates of morbidity, mortality, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71050],  7-10   
and because of the increasing incidence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -use disorders (OUD) and associated 
consequences from the non -medical use of prescriptio n opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].11   Medication -Assisted -
Treatment (MAT) is available for OAUDs, but less than a quarter of publicly funded treatment 
programs12 and fewer than half of private sector treatment programs offer MAT.  
• Despi[INVESTIGATOR_71051], few inpatients with OAUDs receive evidence -based treatments while in 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].13-[ADDRESS_77368] physicians and other providers in acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71052], 16  contributing to low rates of OAUD identification

Version 3. 1 START Protocol  04-08-21 
 and treatment initiation.17-21   Pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_71053] (acamprosat e, oral and 
injectable naltrexone, and disulfiram) and OUDs  (buprenorphine/naloxone, methadone, and 
oral and injectable naltrexone) are effective for use across medical settings22-28  but are seldom 
administered in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71054] -up care.  29,30  New research 
demonstrates that initiating buprenorphine/naloxone in the emergency department with 
follo w-up in primary care for patients with OUDs can increase SUD treatment entry and 
abstinence,[ADDRESS_77369] of care 
for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71055], brief intervention  outcomes for people with 
moderate to severe AUDs or for people with OUDs.33,34 ,16,35  Two possible reasons are that SBIRT 
does not incorporate MAT initiation or address the needs of those needing more than a brief 
intervention prior to referral. Barriers to initiating MAT for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71056] a patient -centered, 
measurement - and population -based system for assessing and treating patients with OAUDs. 
Embedding a collaborative care team ( START ) for inpatients with OAUDs within an existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71057] n-liaison psychiatry service could improve MAT initiation and linkage to 
follow -up care and clinical outcomes, and, ultimately, reduce 90 -day readmission rates.  
• Collaborative care is a systematic approach to organizing and coordinating care for patients w ith 
complex conditions .36 Based on the Chronic Care Model developed by [CONTACT_71115].,37  
collaborative care addresses barriers to assessing and providing comprehensive, patient -
centered care and leads to improved  care and patient outcomes.38,39  Collaborative care has 
four core attributes: (1) Team -driven: a behavioral health team is integrated into the medical 
team to provide coordinated care and develop patient -centered care plans; (2) Population -
focused: the team provides care to a defined group of patients; (3) Measurement -based: The 
team [ADDRESS_77370] clinical decision -making; and 
(4) Evidence -based: the team facilitates use of evidence -based practices in the clinical setting.40-

2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
Primary Objectives:  
Test if embedding a collaborative care team called  START  the substance use treatment and 
recover y team (START)  for inpatients with OAUDs within an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71058] -liaison 
psychiatry service could improve MAT initiation and linkage to follow -up care and clinical 
outcomes, and, ultimately, reduce 90 -day readmission rates.  
 
Secondary Objective:  
In a larger study, subsequent to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], we will test [ADDRESS_77372] semi -structured in-person  or remote  (telephone or

subjects (variables include demographics, alcohol and/or opi[INVESTIGATOR_71063]).  
• The Principal Investigator, Co -Investigators, and approved study staff will have access to 
these records.  
3.[ADDRESS_77375] RECRUITMENT  
The study will recruit adults with moderate to severe OAUDs  who are admitted to the 
inpatient medical center. Patients will be identified through physician referral, or through 
review of an existing daily EPIC workbench report of opi[INVESTIGATOR_71064] (Daily 
Report).  The approved CSMC study staff will identify patients with probable moderate -to-
severe OAUD through a daily printout from EPIC or by [CONTACT_71116] (see Figure 1 below).  
• The CSMC approved study staff  will identify patients with probable moderate -to-
severe OAUD through a Daily Report or by [CONTACT_71117].  
• Once a potential patient is identified, someone from the study team  will contact [CONTACT_71118] n, briefly explain th e study, and ask the physician for permission to 
contact [CONTACT_102] .  
• If the attending physician agrees, the physician or someone from the medical team 
will explain the study to the patient and ask for their permission to be visited b y study 
staff.

4.0 STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS  
• Eligibility screening - Assessments, demographics  (conducted in  person or remotely)  
• Informed Consent , if eligible  (to be obtained in  person either on paper or electronically using an 
approved platform or remotely using an approved platform)   
• Enrollment - the CSMC study staff will enroll consented, eligible patients.  
• Baseline interview  - after enrollment, the CSMC approved study staff  will con duct an in-person  
or remote  30-40-minute baseline interview. Interview data will be recorded on a tablet  or 
computer  into a web -based survey system  (REDCap ). Patients will be compensated with a $[ADDRESS_77376]  (given in person or mailed) .  
• Randomization  - following consent and the baseline interview, the CSMC approved study staff  
will randomize the patient to the START  or UC arm  using REDCap.  
• All patients will be given patient education materials  on alcohol and/or opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427], as 
well as harm reduction materials (OUD only) . If the visit is remote, the research team will give 
these materials to a member of the medical team to deliver to the patient or place them in the 
patient’s room.  
• 1-mon th post discharge follow -up interview  - the CSMC  approved  study staff  will conduct a 
follow -up interview by [CONTACT_756] 1 -month after the patient is discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
Patients will receive  $[ADDRESS_77377]  for par ticipation . 
 
The components  of the START workflow  process  are as follows  (also shown in Figure 2):  
1. Triage  (Care Manager CM and Addiction Medicine Specialist AMS) :  
The CM  assesses  the patient  for acute biomedical needs related to the OAUD.  The AMS 
addresses acute biomedical needs (e.g. facilitates withdrawal management).    
2. Engage, assess, plan  (CM and AMS)  (conducted in person or remotely based on 
circumstances) : 
3. If there is not an urgent need for medical intervention  or after the urge nt medical need is 
addressed, the CM  and/or  AMS:    
o engages  with  the patient  (CM and AMS)   
o conducts  a diagnostic and biopsychosocial assessment  (CM)    
o conducts a complete biomedical assessment and addresses comorbidities (AMS)   
o delivers  the brief negotiated interview ( BNI), an evidence -based intervention,  to 
assess  to increase  readiness  and develops  a plan for  initiating  evidence -based 
treatment for OAUD (MAT) and/or psychosocial treatment) during and after the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  (CM)   
o ensures the patie nt understands the follow -up plan and addresses barriers (CM).  
4. Treat  (AMS)  The AMS:   
o facilitates MAT initiation  
o facilitates psychosocial treatment for the substance use disorder, if indicated 
and available.   
5. Communicate  and Coordinate  (CM, AMS)   
o The CM and AMS communicate with each other  to continue care through one -
month (or more) after the patient  is discharged.    
o The CM and AMS communicate with the  patient and  medical  team,  and, when 
appropriate,  the patient’s family  and outpatient providers.   
6. Follow -up (CM):   
 
Page 9 of 27 
Version 3. 1 START Protocol  04-08-21 
 o The CM calls the patient once a week for 1  month  after the patient is discharged 
from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71065].   
o The CM may also call outpatient providers to determine if the patient linked to 
care and has encountered barriers.   
7. Monitor (AMS):   
o The AMS continues to monitor the patient after discharge through the CM’s 
follow -up work.

INNOVATION   
• This proposed study identifies the inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71066] a new opportunity to initiate MAT and 
link patients with follow -up care for their OAUD. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71067] -up care for patients with either an O UD or AUD.16  To our 
knowledge, no experimental studies ha ve focused on initiating MAT and providing focused 
discharge planning and follow -up monitoring for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71068].  
• The study offers a new model —a consultation -liaison service -based START —for improving care 
processes for hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_71069]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71070] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71071] -up care for several patient populations at high risk of 
readmission,46,[ADDRESS_77378] common SUDs among inpatients.  
• This study will provide several types of new knowledge:  
(1) Whether a START  compared with usual care improves care for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71072]. That is, whether START  leads to improved initiation of medication and linkage to follow -
up care for patients who are admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], either for a probl em related to their OAUD 
or for another medical issue.   
(2) Whether a START  compared with usual care reduces substance use.
 
(3) Whether a START  is feasible and acceptable with in the inpatient medical setting. These 
knowledge gains will provide invaluable, preliminary information on how to improve the quality 
of care for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71073]. The knowledge obtained in the study (and even 
more so in the larger, subsequent RCT) not only will benefit individual patients who participate in 
the study but also hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71074] a pragmatic and feasibl e way to improve OAUD care. On a 
societal level, providing a new way to identify and initiate treatment for patients with OAUD 
could fill a previous unmet need and bring down healthcare costs related to untreated OAUD. We 
believe that the long -term gains o f the study, in terms of knowledge and substantive gains to the 
community, far exceed any risks for participants.

• Paper consent forms will be stored inside a locked cabinet or locked office. Electronic 
data will be stored in a secure REDCap database. Recorded interviews will be stored 
on a digitally -encrypted recorder. Transcribed interviews will be uploaded to a secu re 
file transfer protocol (SFTP) program such as Kiteworks.  
• Only members of the study team will have access to study data. A limited date set  will 
be transferred to RAND (collaborating institution) using SFTP programs  and may 
include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71083] , patient age,  and patient zip codes . 
• Linking files and identifiable information will be destroyed within a year after study 
completi on.   A limited data set  will be retained for five years after study completion 
to allow ample time for analysis and publication.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_77382]’s study participation in front of family members will 
be obtained. Written permission to discuss a subject’s condition with family will be 
obtained as  part of the consent form prior to any dissemination of a subject’s 
information. One or more investigators with access to identifiable data are not at Cedars -
Sinai, and the study team  will work with the Office of Research Administration to execute 
an approp riate Data Use Agre ement before sharing the limited data set.  
6.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
6.1 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
I. Responsibility for Data Safeguarding   
PI’s Ober and Danovitch have joint responsibility for overseeing data safeguarding.  They 
will train the designated CSMC approved study staff and project manager in data 
safeguarding techniques and will be responsible for the secure transmission of data fr om 
CSMC to secure research computers at RAND.   
Additional oversight will be provided by [CONTACT_71123], 
consisting of [CONTACT_71140]  and Dr . Karl Wittnebel  of CSMC .  Drs. Ober and Danovitch  will 
consult the committee as need ed (e.g., to assess randomization issues, patterns of SAEs, 
etc.)  during the course of the 6 - 7- month data collection period. This committee is in lieu 
of a full DSMB due to the short data collection period  and small patient size (N=80)  of this

Version 3. 1 START Protocol  04-08-21 
 pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] . 
II. Risks associated with study participation  
The collaborative care START intervention, called substance use treatment and recovery 
team (START) itself is inherently low -risk and therefore adverse events (AEs) experienced 
by [CONTACT_71124]’ underlying opi[INVESTIGATOR_71084] (OAUD) and other illnesses.  Based on our prior research with this population, we 
expect depression and anxiety, medical illness and injury associated with OAUD, and, in 
some cases, unsta ble living conditions. Thus, adverse events may be related more to these 
underlying issues than to the START itself.  
III. Handling of adverse events and serious adverse events and safety reporting  
AEs and SAEs will be handled the same way in which hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71085].  
The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71086].  If 
a client presents as suicidal, a social worker meets with him/her and then consults with a 
licensed mental health clinician (e.g., the CSMC PI [INVESTIGATOR_71087]). The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71088], assess the client’s state, and develop an appropriate plan. Clients with medical 
emergencies will be treated with usual hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71089].  AEs occurring while the patient is 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71090] b e reported to PI [INVESTIGATOR_71087].  AEs/SAEs occurring after discharge will be 
assess by [CONTACT_71125] [INVESTIGATOR_71087]. Incident 
reports will be written within one business day. All adverse and serious adverse events will 
be reported to the IRB and NIH according to CSMC IRB  and NIH  policies and procedures 
guidelines.  
IV. Availability of trained personnel and referral resources  
Prior to data collection [CONTACT_71141] (or designee) will conduct training for the designated 
CSMC approve d study staff and CSMC project manager. The training will address good 
clinical research practices, including data safeguarding and confidentiality.  The approved 
study staff will be trained to promote standardized and objective collection and recording 
of participant information. All research staff will complete a human subjects protection 
course.  
V. Procedures for data quality assurance and protecting confidentiality of participant data  
A. Types of data needing safeguarding  
a. Patient contact [CONTACT_3031] – nam e, telephone number, address, alternate contact 
[CONTACT_71126], entered on a tablet into an electronic record management system.  
b. Consent forms.  Patients will provide written consent to participate in the study.  
c. Patient interview data – baseline and follow -up data from computer -assisted interview, 
entered on a tablet. (Appendix A).  
d. CSMC patient administrative data. Patient data obtained from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71091] (EPIC). (Appendix A).  
 
B. Data sensitivity.  This study will collect partic ipant names, phone numbers, addresses, 
and alternate contact [CONTACT_3031]. These personal identifiers are necessary to obtain 
informed consent, to notify and contact [CONTACT_71127] -up interview and 
to conduct follow -up monitoring for patients  in the START experimental arm of the 
study. A study ID connecting identifiable information with confidential data will be 
assigned to each participant. Signed consent forms and contact [CONTACT_71128] [ADDRESS_77383] management system using a secure, web -based system called 
Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) (see  Appendix B).  REDCap will allow the 
CSMC approved study staff to assign participant IDs to interviews, to maintain a link file 
between study ID and medical record number through a tablet that is securely linked to 
the web.  REDCap is a secure, web -based t ool used by [CONTACT_71129].  REDCap was developed at Vanderbilt University in 
Nashville, Tenn., and is available at no charge. It has become the primary standard for 
most Clinical and Translational Science Instit utes (CTSIs), a national consortium of 
medical research institutions. The UCLA CTSI, to which Cedars -Sinai belongs, has helped 
support access to REDCap. There are two production websites — one that handles data 
that can be linked to an individual (known as  protected health information, or PHI, 
under the federal HIPAA Privacy Rule) and another for non -patient -identified data. 
Research may build their own database after completing REDCap training or have the 
REDCap database developed at no charge.  The link f ile will have read and write access 
restricted to approved study staff and the CSMC project manager.  
2. Patient consent forms.  If collected on paper, s igned consent forms will be stored in a 
locked file cabinet at CSMC, separate from all study data.  
3. Patient interview data.  
a. Baseline. CSMC will also use REDCap to house the electronic computer -assisted 
patient interview. REDCap will allow the CSMC approved study staff to collect 
baseline data through a tablet that is securely linked to the web.  The CSMC  project 
manager will transmit baseline data (identifiable only by [CONTACT_40337]) to RAND via secure 
file transfer protocol (SFTP) site. A program, such as PGP, that provides RSA -level 
security will be used to encrypt files.  These data will not be shared with individuals 
who are not part of the project team, and no data shared with any members of the 
project study team will contain participant names.  
b. 1-month follow -up. [ADDRESS_77384] 
manager will transmit baseline data (identifia ble only by [CONTACT_40337]) to RAND via secure 
file transfer protocol (SFTP) site. A program, such as PGP, that provides RSA -level 
security will be used to encrypt files.  These data will not be shared with individuals 
who are not part of the project team, and n o data shared with any members of the 
project study team will contain participant names.  
4. CSMC administrative data. CSMC administrative data will be pulled from the 
electronic medical record system, EPIC, via a request submitted to the Research 
Informatics and Scientific Computing Core (RISCC). The CSMC project manager will 
replace all medical record numbers with study IDs. The CSMC project manager will 
then transmit the administrative data to RAND via the SSH File Transfer Protocol 
(SFTP) which is a network  protocol that provides file access, file transfer, and file 
management functionalities over secure connection. It was designed by [CONTACT_71130] (IETF) as an extension of the Secure Shell protocol (SSH) 
 
Page [ADDRESS_77385] -protected database.  
Paper files (i.e., consent forms) will be stored in locked file cabinets at CSMC, and 
electron ic files will be stored in encrypted and password -protected files. Furthermore, 
electronic files transmitted to the RAND research team will be identified only by [CONTACT_71131]. Identifying information linking patients to their study ID number will  be 
retained in an encrypted and password protected record management system at CSMC.  
Confidentiality policies and procedures will be reviewed with all new staff.   
E.  Destruction of Data  
Consent forms will be retained at CSMC for three years after completion of the study. 
Linking files and identifiable information will be destroyed within a year after study 
completion. A limited date set  will be retained for five years after study completion to 
allow ample time for analysis and publication.  
 
VI. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_71092]: if there is clear evidence of 
harm. Although  we do not expect any physical harms or serious psychological harms 
beyond minimal distress, we have several procedures for monitoring harm from the 
intervention, including asking participants to contact [CONTACT_71132], offering a dditional resources to those with very high levels of mental health 
symptoms and problem drinking or drug use, and providing resources after baseline and at 
follow -up. We do not expect there to be overwhelming evidence of the benefit of START 
during this p ilot study due to the small sample size, but we will monitor this and stop the 
trial if this is indicated. We also do not expect that there will be no likelihood of 
demonstrated treatment benefit (futility) for the intervention as compared to control.  
6.2 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
• PI [INVESTIGATOR_71093].     
• PI [INVESTIGATOR_71094] D will be responsible for evaluating 
data quality. Reports generated from the database will provide a basis for ongoing 
monitoring of subject accrual and retention, as well as completeness of data. These 
will be used to identify and resolve problems that m ay arise.  EPIC data will be 
exported and checked monthly during the study and survey data will be transmitted 
and checked monthly.  Under the direction of a statistician, a quantitative analyst will 
check the data for completeness.  
 
Page 21 of 27 
Version 3. 1 START Protocol  04-08-21 
 • Fidelity to interventio n methods may be monitored and assessed by [CONTACT_71133] 5% of intervention sessions  of subjects randomized to the 
intervention arm . Patient confidentiality  will be maintained by  1) uploading 
recordings to a secure Box folder ; 2) allow ing access to the Box folder by [CONTACT_71134] -investigator (Karen Osilla, PhD) ; 3) ensuring recording s will be  
listened to in Box  and not downloaded or saved; 4) ensuring recording s are deleted 
after listening. Verbal permission to record the sess ion will be obtained  from subjects  
prior to the start of recording . 
7.[ADDRESS_77386] estimator, which will be used in power calculations for future study 
design, and detecting areas of potential concern. This model would look for differences in 
outcomes  between intervention (START) and control (UC) conditions, controlling for 
baseline measure of the outcome, where appropriate, using a generalized linear modeling -
based framework. For dichotomous outcomes, we will employ a logistic regression model 
of the form Pr (𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖  = 1) =1/(1 + exp (−( 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2𝑧𝑧𝑖𝑖))). Here i indexes 
individuals, 𝛽𝛽0 represents the overall intercept, 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖  represents the treatment status of 
individual i, [ADDRESS_77387] of the intervention. 
The variable 𝑧𝑧𝑖𝑖 represents the baseline measure and 𝛽𝛽2 associated coefficient. 
Continuous outcomes will be modeled using linear regression. We will also perform 
exploratory analyses to investigate whether there ar e subgroups that may be responding 
better or worse to the intervention by [CONTACT_71135] 2 with the 
treatment indicator. Because there will be nearly as many potential covariates as 
observations, we will employ the “horseshoe prior” in  Bayesian analyses of the outcome.  [ADDRESS_77388] (if not all) of the covariates 
are unimportant for predicting the outcome, and attempts to  learn which covari ates are 
important. The intention is not so much to detect significant differences, but rather to 
highlight areas of potential concern. For example, if individuals with high pain levels 
respond less well to START recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], this exploratory approach could  draw attention to 
potential issues that could be optimized ahead of a future trial.  
 7.2 SAMPLE SIZE CONSIDERATIONS  
• Due to the short [ADDRESS_77389] withdrawal from the study 
is not anticipated to be significant.  
• The proposed sample size (40/condition) is consistent with those recommended for 
small intervention tests in staged intervention development.  65  Based on 
administrative data for 54,466 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54992] 2014, 1,037 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71095] (indicating moderate to severe alcohol use) and [ADDRESS_77390] that the majority (at least 
1400) of these are unique patients, suggesting that about 117 patients per month will 
be identified through EPIC, with more referred directly by [CONTACT_71136]. Althoug h, we believe our enrollment rate of 16 per month over 5 months is 
realistic, if not conservative, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_71096].  
 
Page 22 of 27 
Version 3. 1 START Protocol  04-08-21 
 • It is not feasible to blind the staff to study condition because the stud y condition 
requires specific care by [CONTACT_71137]. While it is likely (and expected) that medical teams 
will treat patients in both the experimental and usual care (UC) conditions, patients in 
the START will have an enhanced experience because they (unlike p atients in the UC 
condition) will be receiving START components designed to increase their readiness to 
take the medication and link to follow -up care. Moreover, the support provided by [CONTACT_71138] t we hypothesize 
will take the burden off of the medical team and increase the likelihood of the patient 
receiving medication. Even as medical teams become more aware of medication for 
OAUD and perhaps increase prescribing, we hypothesize that patients who se medical 
teams receive support for their START patients will still be more likely to receive 
medication, even if medical teams are aware they can prescribe these medications. 
Thus, over time, while we might see increased medication initiation for patient s in both 
study conditions, we still hypothesize statistically and clinically significant differences 
for patients in the CCT group. Nevertheless, we still plan to safeguard against any 
biases and effects of UC patients receiving the START. The research te am will review 
electronic health record data to determine whether the START AMS or CM accidentally 
treated UC patients. Further, as part of this developmental study and pi[INVESTIGATOR_21087], we are 
carefully assessing whether (and why) contamination occurs and, if i t does, we will take 
additional steps to further safeguard the experimental condition in the future  RCT.

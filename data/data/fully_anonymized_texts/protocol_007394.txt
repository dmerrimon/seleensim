Note: A woman is considered of childbearing potential following menarche and until 
becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile (permanent sterilization methods 
include hysterectomy, bilateral salp ingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy). A 
postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 consecutive months without an 
alternative medical cause. A follicle-stimulati ng hormone level in th e postmenopausal range 
will be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women [ADDRESS_810939] agree to use a dual method o f 
contraception (a highly effective method of contraception in conjunction with a barrier 
contraception) consistently and correctly from the first dose of study drug until [ADDRESS_810940] dose of study drug. Highly effective methods of contraception are thos e that result in 
a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly and include the 
following: hormonal intrauterine devices; hormonal contraceptives (oral birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], 
depo, patch, or injectable ); male sterilization perfo rmed more than 6 months  prior to screening; 
and complete abstinence from sexual intercourse (if this is the patient’s usual and preferred lifestyle). Barrier methods of contraception include male or female condoms used in 
combination with a separate spermicide product (eg, foam, gel, film, cr eam, or suppository). 
16. Male patients must agree to ab stain from sperm donation from the first dose of study drug until

of NASH. The study includes a screeni ng period, double-blind treatment period, and post-treatment 
follow-up. The Screenin
g Visit will occur up to [ADDRESS_810948]-02 
Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 8.0, 21 July 2022 9 (Week 0); more than [ADDRESS_810949]-4016, and patients in 
Group 3 will receive placebo. Patients  will be stratified by [CONTACT_611612] (2 levels: F1 
versus F2 or F3). 
Baseline assessments will include hepatic imaging (MRI-PDFF and iron-corrected T1 [cT1]), liver 
biopsy, vital signs (blood pre ssure, pulse rate, and body temper ature), physical examinations, 
laboratory evaluations (h ematology, biochemistry, coagulation, and lipid panels and urinalysis), 
and 12-lead ECGs. Historical liver biopsy within [ADDRESS_810950] dose of the prior investigational drug, 
whichever is longer. Patients who screen fail may be rescreened once. With the exception o f 
MRI-PDFF, cT1, and liver biopsy, baseline assessments will be collected at Visit 2 (Week 0, 
Day 0), prior to dosing; for MR I-PDFF, cT1, and liver biopsy, th e assessments performed during 
screening will provide the baseline data. Study drug dosing will begin at Visit 2 (Week 0, Da y 0) and will continue daily for 52 weeks. 
During the 52-week treatment perio d, patients will return to the c linic for study visits every 1 to 
3 months. The following assessments will occur at  every study visit during the treatment period: 
adverse events, concomitant me dications, body weight, vital signs, physical examinations, 
laboratory evaluations (h ematology, biochemistry, coagulation, and lipid panels and urinalysis), 
and trough pharmacokinetic (PK) sa mpling. For a subset of patient s (approximately 8 patients per 
group) at pre-identified sites, blood samples for an alysis of additional PK parameters will also be 
collected predose and up to 24 hou rs postdose at Visit 2. In a ddition, hepatic imaging will be 
performed at Visit 5 (after 16 w eeks of treatment) and Visit 9 (a fter 52 weeks of treatment).  
Evaluation of liver inflammation and fibrosis biomarkers (Hom eostatic Model Assessment for 
Insulin Resistance [HOMA-IR], high-sensitivity C-reactive protei n [hsCRP], N-terminal type 3 
collagen propeptide [Pro-C3], and enhanced liver fibrosis [ELF] panel) will be performed at 
Visits 2, 5, and 9. Twelve-lead ECGs will be perf ormed at Visits 2, 5, 7, and 9, and a liver biopsy 
will also be performed at Visi t 9. Throughout the study, patients will  be monitored for suspected 
drug-induced liver injury. A Safety Follow-up Visit (Visit 10) will occur [ADDRESS_810951] dose of study drug to assess 
adverse events, concomitant me dications, body weight, vital signs , physical examination findings, 
laboratory parameters, and 12-lead ECGs. Lipid parameters will be monitored throughout the 
follow-up period and will be managed by [CONTACT_737]. 
Patients who discontinue early from the study for a ny reason prior to comp letion of the treatment 
period will be requested to return to the clinic  for an Early Terminatio n (ET) Visit as soon as 
possible after their last intake of study drug. Pa tients who discontinue earl y from the study for any 
reason after completion of the trea tment period and before the Safet

For all patients, blood samples for evaluation of  trough plasma PK concen trations of NST-4016 
will be collected predose at Visits 2 to 9 (or the ET Visit, if applicable). For those patients participating in  the intensive PK subset, PK bl ood samples will be collected in 
relation to the first dose of study drug at Visit 2. Samples will be ta ken at the follo wing timepoints: 
predose (within [ADDRESS_810955] dos e), followed by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours postdose 
(10 minutes) at Visit 2 (Day  0) and 24 hours postdose ( 1 hour, but prior to  the second dose o
f 
study drug on Day 1). For the intensive PK subset of patients, the followi ng PK parameters will be calculated in order to 
further characterize the PK of  NST-[ADDRESS_810956] dose: 
 AUC
0-t: area under the plasma concentr ation-time curve fr om time [ADDRESS_810957] 
observed concentration 
 AUC0-inf: area under the plasma concentration-time curv e from time 0 extrapol ated to infinity 
 CL/F: apparent plasma clearance  
 Cmax: maximum observed plasma concentration 
 Tmax: time to reach the maximum observed plasma concentration 
 Vz/F: apparent volume of distribution 
Additional PK parameters may be de termined, if deemed appropriate. 
SAFETY VARIABLES: Safety assessments will include the monitoring of adverse events, serious adverse events (SAEs), 
vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, and bo dy temperature), physical examinations, 12-lead 
ECGs, and clinical laboratory  parameters (hematology, biochemistry, coagulation, and lipid 
panels and urinalysis). Throughout the study, all treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), clinical assessments, and 
clinical laboratory parameters will be clos ely monitored against the criteria for suspected 
drug-induced liver injury.

prior to database lock and unblinding. 
Analysis Populations The Randomized Population will include all pa tients who are randomized to the study. 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Populatio n will include all patients who are randomized and receive at 
least 1 dose of study drug. The Modified ITT (mITT) Population will includ e all patients from the IT T Population who have 
valid baseline and Week 52 (or ET, if applicable) liver biopsy measurements.

Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 8.0, 21 July 2022 12 The Per-Protocol (PP) Population will include  all patients from the mITT Population who 
complete the 52-week treat ment period without any ma jor protocol violations. 
The Trough PK Population will include all patients who received at least [ADDRESS_810958] 1 dose of study drug. 
Efficacy Analysis 
The efficacy analysis will be performed on the ITT Population; missing values for continuous 
endpoints will be imputed using multiple imputation methods. 
Baseline will be defined as the va lue at the Screening Visit for m easurements from the liver biopsy 
and imaging data and as the predose value at Visit 2 (Week 0) for the biomarker data. For other 
efficacy endpoints, baseline will be defined as the predose value at Visit 2 (Week 0); if this value 
is missing, then the latest predose value will be used. 
Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary endpoint (ie, the percentage of pati ents with resolution of NASH without worsening 
fibrosis) will be analyzed using the ITT P opulation. Patients without a Week 52 (or ET, i f 
applicable) liver biopsy will be imputed as nonr esponders. The number and percentage of patients 
meeting the criteria for the primary endpoint will be su mmarized by [CONTACT_1570]. 
The primary analysis will be conducted using the data from the [ADDRESS_810959], stratified by [CONTACT_611612] (2 levels: F1 
versus F2 or F3). The primary analysis will be based on the use of a 2-sided test at the 
alpha=0.05 level of significance. 
If the primary analysis is statis tically significant (p<0.05), the key secondary analysis of the 
primary endpoint will be conducte d using the data fro m the [ADDRESS_810960], stra tified by [CONTACT_611612] (2 levels: F1 
versus F2 or F3). Due to the use of this fi xed-sequence testing procedure, the key secondary 
analysis will be based on the use of  a 2-sided test at the alpha=0.[ADDRESS_810961]-4016 and placebo groups will be exploratory rather than confirmatory. A sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint will be carried out using a logistic regression model 
with treatment group ([ADDRESS_810962]-4016, 600 mg NS T-4016, or placebo) and biopsy fibrosis 
score (2 levels: F1 versus F2 or F3) as factors.  Pairwise treatment comparisons will be estimated 
in this model as odds ratios (NST-[ADDRESS_810963] acebo) along with their 95% confidence intervals 
and p-values. The primary, key secondary, and sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will be repeated on 
the mITT and PP Populations. Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
Continuous efficacy variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics for the observed data 
and change and/or percent change from baseline by [CONTACT_611613].

Pairwise treatment comparisons between each NS T-[ADDRESS_810965] square (LS) means, standard  errors, 95% confidence intervals, and p-values. 
A similar analysis will be carried out for th e imaging parameters at Week 16 and Week 52. 
Efficacy variables measured at multiple timepoi nts will be analyzed with Mixed Model Repeated 
Measures methods, with change (or percent cha nge) from baseline as the dependent variable, 
adjusting for treatment ([ADDRESS_810966]-4016, or placebo), biopsy fibrosis score 
(2 levels: F1 versus F2 or F3), and baseline score. Pairwise treatment comparisons between each

Exploratory Biomarker Analysis 
The analysis of exploratory endpoints will be furt her described in the Statistical Analysis Plan. 
Pharmacokinetic Analysis Trough plasma PK concentrations at Visits 3 to  9 will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_611614]. For the subset of patients with intensive PK sampling data, additional PK parameters will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_611615]. No formal 
statistical analysis of PK parameters will be performed. Safety Analysis Safety variables will be tabulated an d presented for the Safety Population. 
Baseline will be defined as  the predose value at Visit 2 (Week 0) ; if this value is  missing, then the 
latest predose value will be used. A TEAE is defined as a new or worsening adverse event after the first dose of study drug. The 
number and percentage of patients with at le ast 1 TEAE will be summar ized by [CONTACT_611616]. Similar summaries will be presented for study 
drug-related TEAEs and SAEs. Safety laboratory parameters, vital signs, and ECGs will be summarized by [CONTACT_611617]. Change from baseline values  by [CONTACT_611618].

Version 8.0, 21 July 2022 23 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
NorthSea Therapeutics B.V. (hereinafter NorthSea)  is developi[INVESTIGATOR_611585] 
(International Nonproprietary Name) (development c ode NST-4016). Icosabutate is a novel, orally 
administered, semisynthetic fatty ac id for the treatment of lipid disorders (hypertriglyceridemia, 
mixed dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and hyperc holesterolemia) and nona lcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).  
1.1 Rationale 
Icosabutate is a novel, orally ad ministered, highly potent, semisynthe tic fatty acid fo r the treatment 
of various dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_611586]. Structural modification of the natural omega-3 fatty acid 
(n-3 FA) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is designed to potentiate the pharmacological effects of 
naturally occurring n-[ADDRESS_810981] that icosabutate has additional hepat oprotective effects not typi[INVESTIGATOR_611587]. Similarly, th e significant improvements in gl ycemic control observed in 
patients with severe hypertriglycerid emia in response to treatment with icosa butate is not observed 
with either unmodified EPA or cholesterol-loweri ng drugs. Beneficial effects on both plasma lipi[INVESTIGATOR_611588] r the treatment of patients with 
NASH given the strong associati on of NASH with both cardiovasc ular disease and diabetes. 
The nonclinical experience with icosabutate thus far indicate s potent reductions in hepatic 
steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in multiple differentiated NASH models. There are likely multiple contributors to the observed pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of icosabutate in NASH. 
Although icosabutate is a partia l peroxisome proliferator-ac tivated recepto r alpha (PPAR α) 
agonist, the activation of which may underlie its beneficial effe cts on plasma triglycerides, the 
beneficial effects in fibrosi ng NASH are likely mediated via other mechanisms. However, PPAR α 
activation does likely contribute to the increase in hepatic fatty acid β-oxidation and increase in 
ketone formation, which in turn may reduce th e hepatic lipid load. Reductions in hepatic 
diglycerides (DAGs) and cholesteryl ester may also be partially related to PPAR α, although 
icosabutate has potent effects upon hepatic c holesterol not seen with synthetic PPARα  agonists. 
Icosabutate induces highly sign ificant improvements in hepatic inflammation, including 
reductions in proinflamm atory gene expression along with decreases in hepatic inflammatory 
cellular infiltrates and galectin -3 content in rodent NASH models. The mechanisms underlying 
these effects may involve signifi cant reductions in the hepatic leve ls of proinflammatory bioactive 
arachidonic acid (AA)-derived me tabolites (ie, hydroxyeicosatet raenoic acids [HETEs]), which 
are associated with NASH in humans and rodents. The ability of icosabutate to remain as a free 
acid and avoid incorporation into complex lipi[INVESTIGATOR_611589].  
Icosabutate also decreases the hepatic expression of 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_611590] s regulating HETE and 
leukotriene formation (eg, 5-lipoxyg enase activation protein and cytosolic phospholipase A2). In 
addition to the effects on hepatic inflammation, the reductions in proinflammatory AA metabolites 
may also underlie the improvements in insulin resistance and reductions in NASH-associated 
hepatic lipi[INVESTIGATOR_611591]. The formation of anti-inflammatory om ega-[ADDRESS_810982]-02 
Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 8.0, 21 July 2022 24 (CYP) epoxides is also seen with icosabutate,  which in concert with  the reductions in AA 
metabolites, leads to a reversal of the balance between hepati c proinflammatory and 
anti-inflammatory fatty acid metabo lites derived from the AA cascade. 
Icosabutate significantly reduces, and even reverses, fibrosis in  rodent models of NASH in 
association with a marked reduc tion in collagen fiber number. Significant reductions in the 
expression of pi[INVESTIGATOR_611592], such as COL1A1 and PDGFR1, are also observed in 
concert with the reduc tion in hepatic fibrosis. The reduction in hepatic fibrosis is  likely secondary 
to the significant reduction in the nu mber of proliferating stellate cells (ie, myofibroblasts) in the 
livers of rodents with established NASH after trea tment with icosabutate. These effects are likely 
to be at least partially  related to the above-mentioned anti-i nflammatory effects.  However direct 
antiproliferative e ffects are seen in isolated  human stellate cells, whic h suggests that icosabutate 
has direct antifibrotic effects independent of effects on infl ammatory cell types such as 
macrophages and/or dying hepatocytes. 
The mechanism underlying the direct antifibrotic effects of icosabutate is not clarified. However, 
icosabutate functions as a potent hepatic antioxi dant, inducing significant decreases in the amount 
of hepatic oxidized glutathione in multiple rodent NASH models. This occurs in concert with a 
highly significant increase in the reduced to oxidized glutathione ra tio and increases in the hepatic 
expression of enzymatic antioxidant genes, such as  SOD1, SOD2, and catalase.  As oxidative stress 
sensitizes stellate cells to multiple proliferatio n-inducing stimuli such as  tumor necrosis factor 
alpha (TNF- ), and increases the prolif erative response per se, a re duction in oxidative stress and 
improvements in redox status may play a key role in the antifibrotic effects of icosabutate. A 
reduction in oxidative stress may al so be involved in the signifi cant reduction in proinflammatory 
genes regulated by [CONTACT_611620]- sensitive transcription factor nuclear factor- B, such as TNF- α. The 
ability of icosabutate to be ra pi[INVESTIGATOR_611593] a key role in mediati ng the reduced ox idative stress.

1.2 Coronavirus Disease 2019 Impacts 
In March 2020, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by [CONTACT_344169][INVESTIGATOR_190276] s 2, was characterized as a pandemic by [CONTACT_67848] (WHO). The COVID-19 pandemic has imp acted clinical studies worldwide due to 
quarantines, site closures, travel limitations, diversion of resources, and/or general in terruptions in 
study-related procedures.  
This study protocol includes contingency measures to manage disruptions due to COVID-19 
control measures; see Appendix G for details. The impacts of these implemented contingency 
measures on the outcomes of this study, including any protocol deviations that result from 
COVID-19 illness and/or COVID-19 control measures , will be discussed in the Clinical Study 
Report (CSR).

1.4.1 Pre-Specified Interim Analysis of the Ongoing Phase 2b Study in Non-Cirrhotic 
Patients With NASH (Study NST-02) 
[IP_ADDRESS] Overview of interim analyses 
A pre-specified interim analysis  was performed in this ongoing Phase 2b study in patients with 
biopsy-confirmed NASH. This interim analysis was performed after 90 patients had randomized 
and completed 16 weeks of treatment. The purpose of  this interim analysis was to evaluate safety 
as well as multiple non-invasive biomarkers re levant for NASH, fibrosis, metabolic syndrome, 
lipid metabolism, and cardiovascular risk. The in dividual patient disposition remains blinded to 
both the Investigators and the Sponsor but was unblinded to an  independent Data Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC) as part of their sta ndard review. The baseline patient populations 
of the 90 patients in the interim analysis cohor t were reflective of those enrolled into NASH 
clinical trials and generally well balanced across the treatment arms  (Study NST-02 interim 
analysis; data on file). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical pharmacodynamics 
Rapid, sustained, and significant dose-dependent decr eases were seen in alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma  glutamyl transferase (GGT), and alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP) at levels predictive of hist ologic improvement (see Table 1). Both doses 
showed significant reductions in N-terminal type 3 collagen pr opeptide (Pro-C3) and enhanced 
liver fibrosis (ELF) score (bot h total score and individual co mponents) supporting an effect on 
fibrogenesis. High -sensitivity C-reactive protei n (hsCRP) significantly decreased by 52% with 
600 mg, in conjunction with improvements in gly cemic control and key at herogenic lipoproteins. 
There were no changes in weight or body mass index (BMI), suggesti ng a treatment effect 
independent of weight loss. Liver fat content was unchanged with both doses, consistent with the 
icosabutate mechanism of action.

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical safety 
A safety review was performed of the 157 patient s screened at the time of the Week 16 interim 
analysis with the treatment-emergent adverse ev ents (TEAEs) presented in Table 2. There was no 
notable difference in the frequency, severity, or causality of the overall safety profile between 
placebo and either 300 mg or 600 mg of icosabutat e for up to 16 weeks. The majority of TEAEs 
were mild to moderate in severity and generally  comparable across the study arms. The treatment 
was well tolerated and comparable  to placebo, with the exception of mild nausea (4.3%, 9.0%, and 
21.3% in placebo, 300 mg, and 600 mg, respectively).

No confirmed drug-induced liver injury, cardiovasc ular events, or worsening of diabetes were 
observed during the study period. Laboratory values remained stab le or improved and there were 
no clinically relevant changes in vital signs or el ectrocardiograms (ECGs). No safety or tolerability 
signals of concern were observed during the study period as confirmed by [CONTACT_611622]. In summary, the safety and tolerability of icosabutate remains favorable 
and similar to that observed in other patient populations.

Version 8.0, 21 July 2022 27 1.5 Risk/Benefit 
Clinical studies conducted so far suggest that ic osabutate is safe and we ll tolerated and confers 
clinically significant changes in triglycerides, atherogenic choleste rol, and other atherosclerotic 
risk markers such as apolipoprotein C3. The reduc tion in elevated liver enzymes seen in Phase [ADDRESS_810985] common adverse events, again, were gastrointes tinal symptoms (other 
than an increase in mild gastrointestinal disturba nce at supratherapeutic doses). There have been 
no other findings of clinical impor tance in the clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs, 12-lead 
ECGs, telemetry, physical examinations, or body weight observed during the clinical studies. None 
of the nonclinical safe ty findings have been obs erved in the clinical studi es, with no evidence of 
ophthalmic effects in human studies. A thorough QT study has demonstrated no effect of 
icosabutate on QT interval at supratherapeutic doses. 
Based on the nonclinical and clinical  experience to date, icosabutate has a favorable safety and 
tolerability profile with the poten tial for addressing common comorbid conditions in patients with 
NASH without cirrhosis. The potenti al benefits of icosabutate tr eatment in patients with NASH 
without cirrhosis outweigh any potential harm.

3.1 Summary of Study Design 
This is a 62-week (including screening and fo llow-up), multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in male a nd female patients with a histological diagnosis 
of NASH. 
The study includes a screeni ng period, double-blind treatment period, and post-treatment 
follow-up. The Screening Visit will occur up to 8 w eeks prior to randomization at Visit 2 (Week 0); 
more than [ADDRESS_810987]-4016, and patients in 
Group 3 will receive placebo. Patient s will be stratified by [CONTACT_611623] (2 levels: F1 versus 
F2 or F3). For a schematic of  the study design, see Figure 1.  
Figure 1. Study Design 
Baseline assessments will include hepatic imag ing (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]-proton 
density-fat fraction [PDFF] and iron -corrected T1 [cT1]), liver bi opsy, vital signs (blood pressure, 
pulse rate, and body temperature) , physical examinations, labor atory evaluations (hematology, 
biochemistry, coagulation, and lipid panels and urinalysis), and 12-lead ECGs. Historical liver 
biopsy within [ADDRESS_810988]-02 
Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 8.0, 21 July 2022 30 baseline assessments will be collected at Visit 2 (Week 0, Day 0), prior to dosing; for MRI-PDFF, 
cT1, and liver biopsy, the assessments performed during screeni ng will provide the baseline data. 
Study drug dosing will begin at Visit 2 (Week 0, Da y 0) and will continue daily for 52 weeks. 
During the 52-week treatment perio d, patients will return to the c linic for study visits every 1 to 
3 months. The following assessments will occur at every study visit during the treatment period: 
adverse events, concomitant medications, body weight, vital signs, physical examinations, laboratory evaluations (hematology, biochemistry, coagulation, and lipid panels and urinalysis), 
and trough PK sampling. For a subset of patient s (approximately 8 patients per group) at 
pre-identified sites, blood sample s for analysis of additional PK parameters will also be collected 
predose and up to 24 hours postdose at Visit 2. In  addition, hepatic imaging will be performed at 
Visit 5 (after 16 weeks of treatment) and Visit 9 (after 52 week s of treatment).  
Evaluation of liver inflammation and fibrosis biomarkers (Hom eostatic Model Assessment for 
Insulin Resistance [HOMA-IR], hs CRP, Pro-C3, and ELF panel) will be performed at Visits 2, 5, 
and 9. Twelve-lead ECGs will be performed at Visits  2, 5, 7, and 9, and a liver biopsy will also be 
performed at Visit 9. Throughout the study, patients  will be monitored for suspected drug-induced 
liver injury. 
A Safety Follow-up Visit (Visit 10) will occur [ADDRESS_810989] dose of study drug to assess 
adverse events, concomitant medications, body wei ght, vital signs, physical examination findings, 
laboratory parameters, and 12-lead ECGs. Lipid parameters will be monitored throughout the 
follow-up period and will be managed by [CONTACT_737]. 
Patients who discontinue early fro m the study for any reason prior to completion of  the treatment 
period will be requested to return to the clinic for an Early Termination (ET) Visit as soon as 
possible after their last intake of study drug. Pa tients who discontinue early from the study for any 
reason after completion of the tr eatment period and before the Safety Follow-up Visit will be 
requested to return to the clinic for an ET Visit as soon as possible and no later than the planned 
Safety Follow-up Visit. 
From screening through follow-up, the total stud y duration for each patient who completes the 
entire treatment period will be approximately 62 weeks. For a summary of procedures to be 
performed at each visit, refer to the Schedule of Procedures in Appendix A. 
An external, independent DSMC will review al l available unblinded preliminary safety and 
biomarker results per the DSMC Charter.  
In addition, the following data was comprehens ively reviewed during an interim analysis, 
which was performed after 90 patients had co mpleted 16 weeks of treatment: ALT, AST, 
HOMA-IR, Pro-C3, ELF panel, MRI-P DFF, cT1, and lipid parameters.

 The patient withdraws consent or requests discontinuation from the study for any reason 
 Occurrence of any medical condition or circumst ance that exposes the patient to substantial 
risk and/or does not allow the patient to a dhere to the requirements of the protocol 
 Any serious adverse event (SAE), clinically significant adverse event, severe laboratory 
abnormality (including meeting an y of the suspected drug-induced liver injury criteria as

5.1 Treatment Groups 
Approximately 264 eligible patients  with NASH will be randomized in to 1 of 3 parallel treatment 
groups (stratified by [CONTACT_611612]), each of which will contain approximately 88 patients, 
as outlined in Table 3. 
Table 3. Study Treatment Grou ps and Dosing Regimens 
Treatment Group Dosing Regimen [1] 
Group 1: [ADDRESS_811009]-4016 1 capsule (300 m g) NST-4016 and 1 capsule matchin g placebo 
Group 2: [ADDRESS_811010]-4016 2 capsules (300 m g each) NST-4016 
Group 3: placebo 2 capsules matchin g placebo 
1. Patients will take 2 capsules in the morning with water once daily (at approximately the same time each day) for 
52 weeks. Study drug can be taken in the fed or fasted state. 
5.2 Rationale for Dosing 
The maximum dose selected for this study (600 mg) was previously administered for 12 weeks 
daily in patients with hypertriglyceridemia or mixed dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_611594] a nd cholesterol and was shown to 
be safe and well tolerated. Singl e ascending doses >600 mg (up to 2800 mg) resulted in increasing 
gastrointestinal side effects, which were mainly mild. The low dose selected for this study (300 mg) demonstrated significant reductions in triglycerides and cholesterol, although not as 
notable as the effects s een with [ADDRESS_811011] acebo-controlled design. Patients will be 
randomized via the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system to 1 of 3 parallel treatment 
groups at Visit 2 (Week 0)  in a 1:1:1 ratio. Patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_611612] 
(2 levels: F1 versus F2 or F3). Randomization information will be concealed from the Investigators 
and the patients until the end of the study, with the exception of an emer gency situation involving 
a patient that requires unblindi ng of the treatment assignment. 
Both NST-4016 and placebo will be provided as capsules for oral admin istration and will be 
identical in appearance. 
5.4 Breaking the Blind 
Until formal conclusion of the study, patients, I nvestigators, and all site study personnel will 
remain blinded to treatment allocation, except in the event of a medical emergency that necessitates 
unblinding. In the event of a medical emergency where knowledge of the patient’s treatment 
assignment would influence the patient’s clini cal care, the site will be able to unblind the patient

designed as 300 mg icosabutate (drug substance) in Self-Emulsifying Drug Delivery System 
(SEDDS). In general, a SEDDS formulation is a mixture of oils and surf actants, which emulsify 
in aqueous media under conditions of gentle ag itation and digestive moti lity that would be 
encountered in the stomach and ga strointestinal tract. The use of a self-emulsifying formulation is 
proposed to increase the bioava ilability of drugs with poor wa ter solubility. The formulation 
contains [ADDRESS_811013], it is expected that Investigators and patients follow the protocol requirements as set forth. 
5.5.3 Study Drug Administration 
All patients will take 2 capsules of study drug (either [ADDRESS_811014]-4016 and/or matching placebo) 
orally in the morning with water once daily for [ADDRESS_811015] udy drug daily until the bi opsy occurs, for up to 
30 days after the originally  projected Visit 9 date. 
Patients should take study drug at approximately  the same time each day. Study drug can be taken 
in the fed or fasted state. 
On study visit days, patients should take their daily dose of study drug at the clinical site to 
accommodate predose trough PK sampling. 
5.5.4 Treatment Compliance 
The quantity of study drug dispense d to and returned by [CONTACT_611625] C linical Research Associate (CRA) monitoring the study. All 
discrepancies in drug accountab ility should be explained and documented (missed dose, lost 
capsule, overdose, etc). If the pa tient is not compliant  with study drug intake, the Investigator 
should discuss this with the patient. 
If study drug compliance drops below 80% or surpasses 100% at an y given time during the 
treatment period, the Investigator or designee should discuss compliance with the patient and 
counsel the patient appropriately. Noncompliance includes missed doses in addition to taking the

the study drug should not be used but returned to site for replacement with new study drug. The 
study drug must not be frozen.  
At the completion of the study, all used and unus ed supplies should be accounted for, and any 
unused study drug should be returned  to the clinical site for dest ruction or for return to the 
distribution site (or desi gnee) for destruction. 
5.6 Prior and Concomitant Medications and/or Procedures 
Unless medically warranted, all concomitant medi cations should remain stable from screening 
through the Safety Follow-up Visit (Visit 10). Throughout the duration of the study, patients 
should not introduce changes to th eir usual diet (including dietary supplements) or lifestyle. 
5.6.1 Excluded Medications and/or Procedures 
Excluded medications and proce dures include the following: 
 Any drug known to produce hepatic steatosis , including systemic corticosteroids, 
methotrexate, tetracycline, amiodarone, tamoxife n, estrogens at doses gr eater than those used

is [ADDRESS_811021] to notify the Investigator of 
low-density lipoprotein-choles terol (LDL-C) values. If LDL- C increases from baseline by 
10 mg/dL and is >ULN on 2 consecutive visits, add itional treatment (eg, initiation of statin therapy 
or an increase in the statin dose for patients  who are already on trea tment) may be introduced 
according to the 2018 AHA/American Colleg e of Cardiology (ACC) Guideline on the 
Management of Blood Cholesterol,2 after discussion with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor. 
Throughout the study, it is recommended that a patie nt’s LDL-C is managed in accordance with 
the 2018 AHA/ACC Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol. The 2018 AHA/ACC 
Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholestero l recommends personaliz ed risk assessments 
and new cholesterol-lowering drug options for people at the highest risk for cardiovascular disease. 
The guideline provides treatment algorithms for Primary Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease 
(ASCVD) prevention and Secondary ASCVD prevention. See Appendix F for links to the full and 
abbreviated versions of the 2018 AHA/ACC Guideline on the Manageme nt of Blood Cholesterol.  
In this study, it is recommended that a patient’s LDL-C is managed with a statin, when necessary, 
in accordance with the treatment algorithm outlined in the 2018 AHA/ACC Guideline on the 
Management of Blood Cholesterol. In addition, I nvestigators should identify patients who are at 
“Very High Risk of Future ASCVD Events” w ho may benefit from additional LDL-C lowering 
therapy. Patients with “Very High Risk of Futu re ASCVD Events” include those with multiple 
major ASCVD events in the past or 1 major AS CVD event and multiple high-risk conditions as 
defined below: 
 Major ASCVD events include the following: 
o Recent acute coronary syndrome (within the past 12 months)  
o History of myocardial infarcti on (other than recent acute coronary syndrome event listed 
above)  
o History of ischemic stroke  
o Symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (history  of claudication with ankle brachial index) 
 High-risk conditions in clude the following: 
o Age 65 years  
o Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia  
o History of prior coronary artery by[CONTACT_611627](s)  
o Diabetes mellitus  
o Hypertension  
o Chronic kidney disease (eGFR 15 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2)  
o Current smoking

Version 8.0, 21 July 2022 41 o Persistently elevated LDL-C (LDL-C 100 mg/dL [ 2.6 mmol/L]) despi[INVESTIGATOR_611596]  
o History of conges tive heart failure 
In certain circumstances as outlined in AHA/A CC treatment algorithm, Investigators should 
consider other cholesterol-loweri ng medications along with statins.  For example, patients with a 
history of myocardial in farction or ischemic stroke, who ha ve high-risk conditions as outlined 
above. A stepwise approach should be used. If a patient is already on  a maximal dose statin 
(eg, rosuvastatin 40 mg) and has LDL-C 70 mg/dL ( 1.8 mmol/L), adding ezetimibe is a 
reasonable step. If that combination is not successf ul, then the addition of a proprotein convertase 
subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibito r should be considered. However, if a patient is unable able to 
tolerate a maximal dose of stat in, then ezetimibe can be added. In  addition, for patients who are 
unable to take statins (eg, due to poor tolerability or adverse effects), then adding ezetimibe or a 
PCSK9 inhibitor such as evolocumab or al irocumab would be a reasonable approach. 
Lipid parameters will be monitored throughout the follow-up period and any lipid-lowering 
treatment started during the study should be reviewed during the follow-up period and adjusted or 
discontinued in accordance with the 2018 AHA/A CC Guideline on the Management of Blood 
Cholesterol. 
Patients with T2DM should be on a stable dose of antidiabetic medication, including insulin 
regimens, for at least 3 months prior to screening (with the exception of SGLT2 inhibitors and 
GLP-[ADDRESS_811022] be stable for 6 months at screening). Patients may switch drugs 
within a class prior to screening if the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c remain controlled 
(as assessed 30 days after the sw itch), the drug is well tolerated, and there is no exclusionary drug 
interaction. Patients must agree to remain on a stable regimen fo r their entire part icipation in the 
study unless at the Investigat or’s discretion and according to the following rules: 
 In case of confirmed FPG/HbA1c above the th reshold value, defined as FPG >270 mg/dL 
(15.0 mmol/L) and HbA1c >9% (for patients w ith baseline HbA1c <8%) and HbA1c increase 
of more than 1% from baseline (for patients with baseline HbA1c 8% and 9.5%), the 
Investigator should ensure that no reasonable explanation exists for insufficient glucose control 
and that: o Plasma glucose was measured  in the fasting condition. 
o Absence of intercurrent disease that may je opardize glycemic control. In case of an 
emergency (eg, surgery, infec tion), the Investigator can ta ke appropriate measures for 
glycemic control. 
o Compliance to treatment is appropriate. 
o Compliance to diet and lif estyle is appropriate. 
NorthSea Therapeutics B.V. 
Clinical Study Protocol NST-02 
Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 8.0, 21 July 2022 42 If any of the above can reasonably explain the insufficient glycemic cont rol, the Investigator 
should consider the following: 
 Investigation and treatmen t of intercurrent diseas e (to be reported in adverse event/concomitant 
medication forms on of the eCRF). 
 Stress to the patient the need to be compliant to treatment. 
 Stress to the patient the need to be compli ant to diet and life style recommendations. 
An FPG/HbA1c follow-up assessment  should be arranged after appr opriate action has been taken. 
If none from the above-mentioned reasons can be f ound, or if appropriate action fails to decrease 
FPG/HbA1c under the threshold values, additio nal medication may be introduced at the 
Investigator’s discretion and according to local  guidelines after discussion with the Sponsor’s 
Medical Monitor.

this treatment. An adverse event can therefor e be any unfavorable a nd/or unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease te mporally associated with the 
use of an investigational medicinal product, whethe r or not related to the investigational medicinal 
product. All adverse events, in cluding observed or volunteered  problems, complaints, or 
symptoms, are to be record ed on the appropriate eCRF. 
Adverse events, which include clinical laborat ory test variables, will be monitored and 
documented from the time the patient signs the informed consent form (ICF) until Visit 10 
(Week 54) or the ET Visit (if applicable). Patients  should be instructed to report any adverse event 
that they experience to the Investigator, whethe r or not they think the event is due to study 
treatment. Investigators should make  an assessment for adverse events  at each visit and record the 
event on the appropriate adverse event eCRF. 
Wherever possible, a specific dise ase or syndrome rather than in dividual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by  [CONTACT_445239]. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not cons idered a component of a specific disease or 
syndrome by [CONTACT_737], it should be recorded as a separate adverse event on the eCRF. 
Additionally, the condition that led to a medical or surgical  procedure (eg, surgery, endoscopy, 
tooth extraction, or transfus ion) should be recorded as an adve rse event, not the procedure itself.  
Any medical condition already presen t at screening should be record ed as medical history and not 
be reported as an adverse event unless the medi cal condition or signs or  symptoms present at 
screening changes in severity, fr equency, or seriousness at any tim e during the study. In this case, 
it should be reported as an adverse event. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination (eg, EC G) findings that are 
detected during the study or are present at scre ening and significantly worsen during the study 
should be reported as adverse events , as described below. The Investig ator will exercise his or her 
medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnorma l laboratory finding or other 
abnormal assessment is clin ically significant. Clin ically significant abno rmal laboratory values 
occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests return to  normal, stabilize, or 
are no longer clinically significant. Abnormal test results th at are determined to  be an error should 
not be reported as an ad verse event. Laboratory abnormalities or other abnormal clinical findings 
(eg, ECG abnormalities) should be reported as an adverse event if any of the following are 
applicable: 
 If an intervention is required as a result of the abnormality 
 If action taken with the study drug is requi red as a result of the abnormality 
 Based on the clinical judgm ent of the Investigator

8.1.3 Assessment of Adverse Even ts by [CONTACT_248128] (intensity ) of each adverse event and will also categorize 
each adverse event as to its potential relationship to study drug. 
The Investigator will assess all adverse even ts using the Common Te rminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 grading system. Assessment of severity 
The severity of all adverse events should be gr aded according to the CTCAE. For those adverse 
event terms not listed in the CTCAE, the following gradi ng system should be used: 
 CTCAE Grade 1: Mild; asymptomat ic or mild symptoms; clinic al or diagnostic observations 
only; interventi on not indicated 
 CTCAE Grade 2: Moderate; minimal local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental  activities of daily living 
 CTCAE Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; di sabling; limiting self-care 
activities of daily living 
 CTCAE Grade 4: Life-threatening conse quences; urgent intervention indicated 
 CTCAE Grade 5: Death related to the adverse event 
Causality assessment 
The relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the study drug is to be assessed 
according to the following definitions: 
No (unrelated, not related, unlikely to be related) – The time cour se between the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of th e adverse event rules out a causal relationship 
and another cause (concomitant drugs, therap ies, complications, etc) is suspected. 
Yes (possibly, probably, or defin itely related) – The time course  between the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of th e adverse event is cons istent with a causal 
relationship and no other cause (concomitant dr ugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc) can be 
identified. The definition implies a reasonabl e possibility of a causal relati onship between the event and the 
study drug. This means that there are facts (eviden ce) or arguments to sugge st a causal relationship.

Version 8.0, 21 July 2022 54 The following factors should also be considered: 
 The temporal sequence from  study drug administration- 
The event should occur after the study drug is  given. The length of time from study drug 
exposure to event should be  evaluated in the clinical  context of the event. 
 Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases- 
Each report should be ev aluated in the context of  the natural history and course of the disease 
being treated and any other disease the patient may have. 
 Concomitant drug- 
The other drugs the patient is taking or the trea tment the patient receives should be examined 
to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event in question. 
 Known response pattern for this class of study drug- Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate wh ether a particular respon se is likely to be a 
class effect. 
 Exposure to physical and/ or mental stresses- 
The exposure to stress might induc e adverse changes in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_445214] a logical and 
better explanation for the event. 
 The pharmacology and PK of the study drug- 
The known pharmacologic properties (absorption, distribution, me tabolism, and excretion) of 
the study drug should be considered.

Events of suspected drug -induced liver injury will  be monitored as AESIs during this study. During 
the course of the study, additional AESIs may be identified by [CONTACT_1034].  
The Investigator will assess and record in detail any additional information on AESIs on an SAE 
form (whether or not the event meets seriousness criteria in Section 8.2), to be submitted within

8.2 Serious Adverse Events 
An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered se rious if, in the view of either the Investigator 
or Sponsor, it results in a ny of the following outcomes: 
 Death. 
 A life-threatening adverse event. 
Note: An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered “life-threat ening” if, in view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of death. It does 
not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe fo rm, might have caused death.

inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. 
 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions. 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 An important medical event. 
Note: Important medical events that do not meet any of the a bove criteria may be considered 
an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical ju dgment, they may jeopardize the patient and 
may require medical or surgical  intervention to pr event one of the outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such medical events include alle rgic bronchospasm requir ing intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dys crasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or the development of drug dependency. 
8.3 Serious Adverse Event Reporting − Procedures for Investigators 
Initial reports 
All SAEs occurring from the time of informed consent until [ADDRESS_811043] be reported to the Medpace Clinical Safety or Sponsor designee. 
To report the SAE, complete the SAE form electr onically in the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) 
system for the study. When the form is comple ted, Medpace Safety personnel will be notified 
electronically by [CONTACT_611630]. If the event meets serious 
criteria and it is not possible to access the ED C system, send an email to Medpace Safety at 
[EMAIL_6741] or call the Medpace SAE reporting line (phone 
number listed below), and fax/email the comp leted paper SAE form to Medpace (contact 
[CONTACT_248130] 8.6 ) within [ADDRESS_811044] continue to follow the patient until the SAE has subsided or until the 
condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persis tent impairment), or the patient 
dies. 
Within [ADDRESS_811045] update the SAE form 
electronically in the EDC system for the study and submit any s upporting documentation 
(eg, patient discharge summary or autopsy reports) to Medpace Clinical  Safety via fax/email. If it 

NorthSea Therapeutics B.V. 
Clinical Study Protocol NST-02 
Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 8.0, 21 July 2022 56 is not possible to access the EDC sy stem, refer to the procedures outlined above for in itial reporting 
of SAEs. 
8.4 Pregnancy Reporting 
If a patient becomes pregnant durin g the study or within the safety follow-up period (ie, prior to 
the Safety Follow-up Visit), the Investigator is to stop dosing with study drug(s) immediately, and 
the patient should be withdr awn from the study. Early termin ation procedures should be 
implemented at that time. 
A pregnancy is not considered to be an advers e event or SAE; however, it must be reported to 
Medpace Clinical Safety within 24 hours of knowledge  of the event. Medpace Clinical Safety will 
then provide the Investigator /site the Exposure In Utero (EIU) form for completion. The 
Investigator/site must complete the EIU form and fax/email it back to Medpace Clinical Safety.  
If the female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant while  the patient is receiving study drug 
or within the safety follow-up period, the Inve stigator should notify Medpace Clinical Safety as 
described above. The pregnancy should be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy, whenever possible. Once 
the outcome of the pregnancy is known, the EIU form should be completed and faxed/emailed to 
Medpace Clinical Safety. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate 
classification as an SAE (ie, postpartum complica tion, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal 
death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator sh ould follow the procedures for reporting an SAE. 
8.5 Expedited Reporting 
The Sponsor/designee will report all relevant in formation about Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) that are fatal or li fe-threatening as soon as possible to the Food and 
Drug Administration, and in any case no later than  7 days after knowledge by [CONTACT_1034]/designee 
of such a case. Relevant follow-up information will subsequen tly be communicated within an 
additional [ADDRESS_811046] knowledge by [CONTACT_1034]/designee.  
The Sponsor/designee will also report any additional expedited safety reports required in 
accordance with the timelines outlined in country-specifi c legislation.  
The Sponsor/designee will also inform all Inve stigators as required per local regulation. 
The requirements above refer to the requirements relating to inve stigational medicinal products.

8.7 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Clinical safety laboratory parameters will be m easured or calculated at all study visits (see 
Appendix A). Fasting hematology, biochemistry, coagulation, and lipid panels and urinalysis 
parameters will be evaluated at all study visits. Further analysis  of urine sediment or urine 
microscopy will be performed if there are any a bnormalities on any of the following 3 dipstick 
results: leukocyte esterase, blood, or nitrite. A lthough lipid parameters will be evaluated at every 
visit, lipoprotein particle size  will be assessed only at baselin e, Week 16, and at the end of 
treatment (Week 52/ET). Lipid parameters will  be monitored throughout the follow-up period and 
any lipid-lowering treatment started during the study should be reviewed during the follow-up 
period and adjusted or discontinued in a ccordance with the 2018 AHA/ACC Guideline on the 
Management of Blood Cholesterol.

For women of childbearing potential, a serum hCG te st will be performed at screening, Week 0, 
and at study exit (whether at the Safety Foll ow-up or ET Visit). Urine hCG testing will be 
performed at all other visits. If a urine hCG test is positive, pregnancy will be confirmed by a 
serum hCG test. Follicle-stimulating hormone le vel will be measured at screening to confirm 
postmenopausal state in women 55 years of age. 
Samples will be collected for viral serology at  screening to confirm patients are negative for 
hepatitis B virus, HCV (patients with a confirmed history of HCV infection can be included if HCV PCR is negative for at least th e last 2 years), and HIV infection.

Full physical examinations (includi ng general appearance; eyes, ear s, nose, and throat; head and 
neck; chest and lungs; cardiovas cular; abdomen; musculoskele tal; lymphatic; dermatological; 
neurological systems; mental st atus; and extremities) will be performed at screening; Visits 2 
and 9; and at study exit (whether at the Safe ty Follow-up or ET Visit). Abbreviated physical 
examinations will be performed at  all other visits. Abbreviated physical examinations should be 
targeted based on Investigator discretion and interval history. 8.[ADDRESS_811050]-02 
Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 8.0, 21 July 2022 59 Images will be provided to the cen tral imaging reader in order to assess the following parameters: 
 MRI-PDFF: a chemical shift-base d method to assess for water-fat separation. This has been 
shown to correspond to histologic al measures of steatosis. 
 cT1: a measure of free-water content in tissue. This has been shown to increase in inflammation 
and fibrosis, when corrected for hepatic iron. 
Hepatic imaging will be performed at screening, Visit 5, and Visit 9 (or the ET Visit, if applicable). 
The MRI performed during screening will provide the baseline data for MRI-PDFF and cT1; 
however, baseline cT1 will be calculated at Vi sit 2, only after the patient is randomized. 
8.12 Liver Biopsies 
Liver biopsies will be performed at screening and Visit 9 (or the ET Visit, if applicable and the 
patient has been on study drug for at least 6 months). Assessment of the tissue collected will be 
performed by a blinded central pathology reader. In addition, in a subgroup of patients, the tissue collected at the End of Treatment Visit (Visit 9) will be analyzed by a central laboratory (OWL) 
for lipi[INVESTIGATOR_611597]. Further details on biopsy collection, processing, stor age, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_611601].

Baseline will be defined as the value at the Screening Visit for measurements from the liver biopsy 
and imaging data and as the predose value at Vi sit 2 (Week 0) for the bi omarker data. For other 
efficacy endpoints, baseline will be defined as the predose value at Visit 2 (Week 0); if this value 
is missing, then the latest predose value will be used. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary efficacy analysis 
The primary endpoint (ie, the percentage of patients with resolu tion of NASH without worsening 
fibrosis) will be analyzed using the ITT Popul ation. Patients without a Week 52 (or ET, if 
applicable) liver biopsy will be imputed as nonresponders. The number and percentage of patients 
meeting the criteria for the primary endpoint will be su mmarized by [CONTACT_1570]. 
The primary analysis will be conducted using the data from the [ADDRESS_811058] ratified by [CONTACT_611612] (2 levels: F1

secondary analysis will be based on the use of a 2- sided test at the alpha=0.[ADDRESS_811060]-4016 and placebo groups will be e xploratory rather than confirmatory. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint 
A sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint will be carried out using a l ogistic regression model 
with treatment group ([ADDRESS_811061]-4016, 600 mg NS T-4016, or placebo) and biopsy fibrosis score 
(2 levels: F1 versus F2 or F3) as factors. Pairwise treatment comparisons will be estimated in this 
model as odds ratios (NST-4016 versus placebo) along with thei r 95% confidence intervals and 
p-values. 
The primary, key secondary, and sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will be repeated on 
the mITT and PP Populations. [IP_ADDRESS] Secondary efficacy analysis 
Continuous efficacy variables will be  summarized using descriptive sta tistics for the observed data 
and change and/or percent change from baseline by [CONTACT_611613]. 
Change from baseline to Week 52 in NAS and indivi dual histological scores will be analyzed in

Good Clinical Practice (GCP) is an internationa l ethical and scientific quality standard for 
designing, conducting, recording, and reporting studies that invol ve human patients. Compliance 
with this standard provid es public assurance that the rights, sa fety, and well-being of study patients 
are protected, consistent with the principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, 
and that the clinical study data are credible. 
11.[ADDRESS_811072] (IRB) will review all appropriate study documentation in order to 
safeguard the rights, safety, and well-being of pa tients. The study will only be conducted at sites 
where IRB approval has been obtaine d. The protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, ICF, advertisements 
(if applicable), written information given to the patients, safety  updates, annual progress reports, 
and any revisions to these documents will be provided to the IRB by [CONTACT_737]. 
Federal regulations and Interna tional Council for Harmonisation (I CH) Guidelines require that 
approval be obtained from an  IRB prior to participation of patie nts in research studies. Prior to 
study onset, the protocol, a ny protocol amendments, ICFs, advert isements to be used for patient 
recruitment, and any other writte n information regarding this study to be provided to a patient or 
patient’s legal guardian must  be approved by [CONTACT_1201]. 
No drug will be released to the site for dosing until written IRB authorization has been received 
by [CONTACT_1034]. 
11.[ADDRESS_811073] ensure that the 
patient has been informed of his/ her rights to privacy. The Investigat or will obtain written informed 
consent from each patient before any study-specific  activity is performed and should document in 
the source documentation that cons ent was obtained prior to enrol lment in the study. The original 
signed copy of the ICF must be maintained by [CONTACT_255626] a 
representative of the Sp onsor, their representatives, auditors , the IRB and/or regulatory agencies. 
A copy of the signed ICF will be given to the patient. 11.4 Study Monitoring Requirements 
It is the responsibil ity of the Investigator to ensure that the study is c onducted in accordance with 
the protocol, Declaration of Hels inki, ICH GCP, and applicable re gulatory requireme nts, and that 
valid data are entered into the eCRFs. 
To achieve this objective, the monitor’s duties are to aid the Investigator and, at the same time, the 
Sponsor in the maintenance of co mplete, legible, well organized a nd easily retrievable data. Before 
the enrollment of any patient in this study, the Sponsor or their designee will review with the Investigator and site personnel th e following documents: protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, eCRFs

COVID-19 contingency measures: This study pr otocol includes contingency measures to ma nage disruptions due to COVID-[ADDRESS_811079] occurred since  screening.  
d. All prior and concomitant medications will be documented in the eCRF. Prior medications include any medication taken within 6 m onths prior to screening. Concomitant 
medications include any medicati on taken on or after the date the patient signs informed consen t. Unless medically warranted, a ll concomitant medica tions should remain 
stable from screening through the Safety Fo llow-up Visit (Visit 10). Throughout the duration of the study, patients should not introduce changes to their usual diet 
(including dietary supplements) or lifestyle. Any changes to concomitant medication dosing during the study will be captured in  the eCRF and closely monitored. 
e. Height will be measured at screening only. Body  weight will be measured at every visit.  
f. Full physical examinations (including genera l appearance; eyes, ears, nose, and throat ; head and neck; chest and lungs; cardiov ascular; abdomen; musculoskeletal; 
lymphatic; dermatological; neurological system s; mental status; and extremities) will be performed at screening; Visits 2 and 9 ; and at study exit (whether at the Safety 
Follow-up or ET Visit). Abbreviated physical examinat ions will be performed at all other visits. 
g. Vital signs will include blood pressure, pul se rate, and body temperature, and will be performed with  the patient in the sitting position after [ADDRESS_811080] and before 
any blood draws. Three replicate blood pressure readings will be take n at each visit.  
h. Only patients with AUDIT-C scores 3 points at screening will receive the full AUDIT at screening and will be excluded if they score 8 points on the full AUDIT. 
Patients with AUDIT-C scores <[ADDRESS_811081] negative for hepatitis B virus, HCV (patients with a confirmed history of HCV infection can be included if H CV PCR is negative for at least the last 
2 years), and HIV infection to be eligible for the study. 
j. If a patient has a qualifyi ng historical biopsy, the required AST levels (AST 20 U/L in men and 17 U/L in  women by [CONTACT_611629] 30 U/L by a local 
laboratory within 60 days of screening) will not apply. 
k. Further analysis of urine sediment or urine microscopy will be  performed if there ar
e any abnormalities on any of the following  3 dipstick results: leukocyte esterase, 
blood, or nitrite. 
l. For women of childbearing potential, a serum hCG pregnancy test will be performed at sc reening, Week 0, an d at study exit (whet her at the Safety Follow-up or ET Visit). 
Urine hCG testing will be performed at all other visits. If a urine hCG test is positive, pregnancy will be confirmed by a seru m hCG test. Follicle-stimulating hormone 
level will be measured at screening to confirm postmenopausal state in women [ADDRESS_811082] 10 minutes. In cas e of evident bad quality of the tracing 
(eg, muscle tremor), the ECG will be repeated. QTcF will be measured. 
n. Patients without a historical biopsy must have a FibroScan VCTE measurement 8.5 kPa and a CAP for steatosis with cut-off values 300 dB/m at screening or a 
historical FibroScan (with eligible VCTE and CAP values) within [ADDRESS_811083] evaluable histology slides from a 
liver biopsy performed in the previous 6 months av ailable for review by [CONTACT_611636]. 
o. At screening, perform MRI-PDFF if FibroScan  values (VCTE and CAP) are within eligib ility range (for patients without historical  biopsy) or if the patient has a qualifying 
historical biopsy. If the patient is elig ible based on a historical biopsy, the MR I-PDFF procedure should be performed but the eligibility criterion of liver fat content 8% 
will not be applied. Magnetic resonance imaging-PDFF will be pe rformed using a standardized central imaging protocol and will b e validated by [CONTACT_611637] (as the baseline value), Visit 5 (Week 16), and Visit 9 (Week 52) or the ET Visit. Iron-corrected T1 will b e calculated for all randomized patients at 
Visit 2 (Week 0) (using the screenin g MRI), Visit 5 (Week 16), and Visit 9 (Week 52) or the ET Visit.

Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 8.0, 21 July 2022 80 Suspected drug-induced liver injury  monitoring in patients with  normal liver transaminases and 
bilirubin at baseline should be performed throughout the study according to the procedures 
summarized below.  
 If patients with normal baseline liver indices develop elevations of aspart ate aminotransferase 
(AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >2  upper limit of normal (ULN) or total bilirubin 
(TBL) >1.5  ULN values during the study, repeat testing should be performed within 
48 hours. o If there are persistent elevations (ALT or AST >2  ULN or TBL >1.5  ULN) upon repeat 
testing, close observation (testing and physical examinati on 2 to 3 times per week) should 
be implemented. An important purpose of the close observati on is to gather additional 
clinical information to  seek other possible causes of the observed liver test abnormalities, 
such as one of the following: acute viral he patitis, alcoholic and autoimmune hepatitis, 
hepatobiliary disorders, cardiovascular causes,  or concomitant treatments. Discontinuation 
of study drug should be considered. 
 Study drug should be discontinued, and the patient should be followed until  resolution of signs 
or symptoms, in the following situations:  o ALT or AST >8  ULN. 
o ALT or AST >5  ULN for more than [ADDRESS_811090] >3  ULN and (TBL >2  ULN or international norm alized ratio [INR] >1.5). 
o ALT or AST >3  ULN with the appearance of fa tigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever,  rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%). 
For any patients who present with a constellation of syndromes indicative of liver disease as per 
the Investigator’s overall assess ment (ie, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or 
tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia [>5 %]), perform liver function tests to determine if 
liver disease is worsening and discontinue the study drug if wors ening is confirmed. 
Reinitiation of study drug may be considered after consultation with the Medical Monitor.

Version 8.0, 21 July 2022 82  If patients with abnormal baseline liver i ndices develop elevations of AST or ALT 
>2  baseline average or TBL >1.5  baseline average values dur ing the study, repeat testing 
should be performed within 48 hours. 
o If there are persistent elevations (ALT or AST >2  baseline average or TBL 
>1.5  baseline average values) upon repeat te sting, then close observation (testing and 
physical examination 2 to 3 times per week) should be implemented and discontinuation 
of study drug should be considered. 
 Discontinue the study drug if a ny of the following occur:  
o Baseline average measurements were <2  ULN and ALT or AST increases to 
>5  baseline measurements. 
o Baseline average measurements were 2  ULN (but <5  ULN as per eligibility 
requirements) and ALT or AST increases to >3  baseline measurements. 
o Baseline average measurements were 5  ULN and ALT or AST increases to 
>2  baseline measurements. 
o ALT or AST increase >2  baseline average measurements AND the increase is 
accompanied by a concomitant increase in TBL to >2  baseline average measurements or 
the INR concomitantly increases by >0.2. 
For any patients who present with a constellation of syndromes indicative of liver disease as per 
the Investigator’s overall assess ment (ie, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or 
tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia [>5 %]), perform liver function tests to determine if 
liver disease is worsening and discontinue the study drug if wors ening is confirmed. 
Reinitiation of study drug may be considered after consultation with the Medical Monitor. 
For all patients, close observati on for suspected drug-induced liver  injury includes the following: 
 Repeating liver enzyme (ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase) a nd serum bilirubin tests 2 or 
3 times weekly (if a patient lives in a remote area, he or she can be tested locally and the results 
promptly communicated to the study site). 
 The frequency of repeat testing can decrease to once a week or less if abnormalities stabilize 
or the study drug has been discontinue d and the patient is asymptomatic. 
 Obtaining a more detailed hi story of symptoms and prio r or concurrent diseases. 
 Obtaining a history of concom itant drug use (including nonprescr iption medications and herbal 
and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and special diets. 
 Ruling out acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C,  D, and E; autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis; 
hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and biliary tract disease. 
 Obtaining a history of exposure to  environmental chemical agents. 
 Obtaining additional tests to evaluate liver func tion, as appropriate (eg, INR, direct bilirubin). 
 Considering gastroenterology or hepatology consultations.

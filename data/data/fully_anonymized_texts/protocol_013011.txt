A. Specific Aims and Hypothesis : 
 
1. Hypothesis 1 : We hypothesize that the high-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (HD -TIV) 
group will have a greater frequency of ≥4-fold rise , HAI titer ≥1:40 , and higher  geometric mean titer  
(GMT ) to influenza A antigens compared to  the standard dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza 
vaccine ( QIV) group in pediatric hematopoietic  stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].   
 
Specific aim 1 : To determine whether HD-TIV compared with standard dose Q IV will increase the 
probability of achieving either a ≥4 -fold rise in  HAI titer, a HAI titer ≥1:40, or higher GMT HAI to 
influenza A antigens in pediatric HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] .  
 
2. Hypothesis 2:  The administration of HD-TIV in pediatric HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_225651]. 
 
Specific aim 2:  To determine the frequency and severity of solicited local injection site adverse events 
and solicited systemic adverse events related  to HD-TIV compared with standard dose Q IV in pediatric 
HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
 
3. Hypothesis 3 : HD TIV vaccination will induce higher protective HAI titers and higher frequencies of 
circulating activated T-follicular ( Tfh) cells and circulating B cell plasmablasts, it will also induce higher 
levels of influenza -specific B and T cell responses compared to standard dose QIV.  
 
Specific aim 3:  To define the relationship between HAI titers, ex-vivo T and B cell phenotype, and ex-
vivo influenza -specific T and B cell response in pediatric HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_225652] -TIV or 
standard dose QIV.  
 
B. Background and Significance : 
 
1. Burden of I nfluenza : 
Over 13,000 hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) are performed each year in the [LOCATION_002], 
according to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research .1 Mortality due to infections is 
seen in 8 -17% of HSCT patients who died within [ADDRESS_271261] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840];2 however, the majority of 
disease is due to circulating influenza A/H3N2 or influenza A/H1N1,3 including in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65304].4 In a 
prospective viral surveillance study involving 37 European transplant centers, 3.5% of the patients had a 
documented respi[INVESTIGATOR_130286], 16  subjects wit h influenza virus A, and of those 23%, of confirmed influenza 
patients died.[ADDRESS_271262] associated to influenza range around 15 -17%;5,[ADDRESS_271263]

(DFA) during a single i nfluenza season. Of the 43 subjects  were eligible to receive the influenza vaccine, only 
19 (44%) subjects were immunized. Of the 19 subjects who did receive influenza vaccine, only two (10.5%) of 
them had nasal samples positive for influenza. Among the re maining 24 unvaccinated individuals, 12 (50%) 
were diagnosed with influenza infection. These data suggest a potential influenza vaccine efficacy of 80%.[ADDRESS_271268] R ecipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]:   
Influenza vaccination is the primary mode for prevention of influenza infection. Protection is primarily mediated 
by [CONTACT_166193] -specific antibodies that depend on an intact humoral response . Both B cell  and T cells  responses are 
impaired in HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] , functional recovery of B and T lymphocytes can take up to [ADDRESS_271269] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_225658] (HAI) 
titers (defined as 1:40) one month after standard in fluenza vaccination is very low when compared to healthy 
controls. While this impaired vaccine -induced immune response is likely due to incomplete immune 
reconstitution or  immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], the exact immune mechanisms of HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]’ poor 
response to influenza vaccination are not well described. Notably, graft versus host disease ( GVHD), low 
number of CD19+ B cells, and earlier timing of vaccination post -transplant have been im plicated as factors 
associated with lower titers after influenza vaccine.[ADDRESS_271270] Patients,  recommends yearly  inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) each influenza season to HSCT 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]; vaccine is preferably given prior to the influenza season, usually at least [ADDRESS_271271] and a 
second dose of vaccine after 3 –[ADDRESS_271272] marginal 
benefit.8 Results from trials comparing two doses  of influenza vaccine are conflicting: some suggest no benefit 
with [ADDRESS_271273] during an influenza outbreak.48 Thus, both the optimal timing of influenza vaccination and the ideal 
number of doses needed remain unclear.  A better understanding of immune responses to influenza 
vaccination (e.g. B and T cell responses to influenza antigens) is also necessary. A promising strategy and

 only immediate practical alternative to overcome the poor immunogenicity of influenza vaccine  may be to 
increase the antigen dose in the vaccine.49 This strategy has been  successful in individ uals 65 years, a group 
with a historically poor response to influenza vaccines compared to healthy young adults.50-52  
3. Prior E xperience with HD-TIV in the Elderly :  
a. Phase 1 Trial : Since the elderly population responds poorly to standard dose influenza vaccine compared to 
younger adults, a higher dose influenza vaccine was hypothesized to be more immunogenic in this 
population.[ADDRESS_271274] trial enrolled 202 adu lts ≥[ADDRESS_271275] influenza A/H1N1; 43, 86,  91, and [ADDRESS_271276] influenza A/H3N2; and 10, 14, 18, and [ADDRESS_271277] the three vaccine antigens in participants given the 60µg dosage were 44% 
to 71% and 54% to 79,%, respectivel y, higher than those in participants given the standard 15 µg dosage. 
Among recipi[INVESTIGATOR_225659] -immunization antibody titers, the rate of seroconversion was nearly double for 
those who received 60 µg, as compared to 15 µg, dosage level.52 Dose -related increases in the occurrence of 
injection site reactions were observed, but all dosages were well tolerated.  
 
b. Phase 2 T rial: A multicenter, phase II, randomized, double -blind, stratified study enrolled individuals  ≥[ADDRESS_271278] ions but only local pain and myalgia were significantly increased. The HD-TIV vaccine induced a higher 
frequency of ≥4-fold serum antibody increases in both HAI (16.8 -27.9%) and neutralization tests (11.9 -24.5%) 
for all three vaccine viruses in the total g roup as well as in subjects  vaccinated and not vaccinated the previous 
year.51 Mean titers of antibody attained, the magnitude of antibody increases , and the frequencies of persons 
with final HAI antibody titers ≥1:32, ≥ 1:64, and  ≥1:128 were all greater for the HD-TIV group in both serologic 
tests  (e.g., HAI and neutralization assays) , for all titer groups  ≥1:32, ≥1:64, and ≥1:128) , and for all vaccine 
viral strains compared to the stand ard dose TIV .51  
 
c. Phase 3  and 3b  Trials, HD-TIV has Increased Immunogenicity and Efficacy  in the Elderly : A phase III, 
multicenter, randomized, double -blind study enrolled 
individuals [ADDRESS_271279] -
vaccination GMT  (Table 1). The HD-TIV vaccine met 
superiority criteria for both influenza A strains (>1.5 GMT r atio), and the responses for influenza B met non -
inferiority criteria. For all strains, seroprotection rates were higher in those individuals who  received HD-TIV than 
in those who received standard dose TIV. Local reactions were more frequent in individuals who received HD-
TIV, but the reactions were  mild to moderate. The superiority of immune responses to influenza A antigens in 
the HD -TIV, compared to the standard -dose group , in this phase III trial led to the licensure of HD -TIV in 
individuals 65 years.50 In addition, not only does the HD -TIV induced significantly higher antibody responses in 
this population, it provided better protection (relative efficacy, 24.2%) against laboratory -confirmed influenza 
illness compared to standard dose TIV.54 
 
4. Prior Experience with HD -TIV in the Immunocompromised Subjects:   
a. Adult HSCT Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  This single -center, randomized, double -blind, phase I safety and immunogenicity

transplant. Subjects were randomized in a 2:[ADDRESS_271282] 
dose TIV.  Forty -four subjects were enrolled (19 in year 1 and 25 in year 2) at a median of 7.[ADDRESS_271283], median age of 50.1 years, 61% male, and 100% white, and 29 HD and 15 SD subjects. HD 
group had higher median IgG level (676 vs. 469, p=0.025).  The HD group reported more local symptoms 
compared to standard dose. No serious adverse events ( SAEs) were attributed to the vaccine, and no 
differences in systemic reactions were noted. The HD group had a higher percentage of individuals with a HAI 
titer >1:40 to H3N2 after HD -TIV, (81% versus 36%, p=0.004) and higher GMT [207.9 versus 30.3, 177.6 95% 
CI difference, (63.5 - 401.8 )], with GMT ratio 6.9 . These results are  published in Biology of Blood and Marrow 
Transplant .55 .  
b. Pediatric Solid Organ Transplant ( SOT) Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  This multi -center, randomized, double -blind, phase I 
safety and immunogenicity trial, conducted at Vanderbilt and the Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_225660] 
[ADDRESS_271284] -transplant. The mean age was 11.25 years, 68% were male, 
transplanted organs were 45% renal, 26% heart, 21% liver, 5% lung, and 5% intestinal, with median of 2.[ADDRESS_271285] dose group (56% versus 
13%, p=0.08). These results were published in Pediatric Transplantation .49 
c. Pediatric Acute Lymphoblas tic Leukemia ( ALL) Subjects . This single -center, r andomized, double -blind, 
phase I safety and immunogenicity trial was conducted at Vanderbilt University,  comparing HD to standard 
dose TIV  in children 3 -17 years of age with ALL. Fifty subjects were enrolle d (20 in year 1 and 30 in year 2), 
with a mean age of 8.25 years, 62% were male, and 78% were receiving maintenance therapy. Thirty -four 
subjects were given HD and [ADDRESS_271286] dose. Safety data revealed no differences between the 
groups for tota l solicited systemic and local reactions; however, the standard dose group reported more fatigue 
and headache. No SAEs were attributed to vaccination. The immune response, measured by a ≥4 -fold rise in 
HAI titer, was similar for each vaccine antigen in bot h groups; however, descriptive data in ALL recipi[INVESTIGATOR_225661] B -cell immune r esponse to each antigen suggest  better responses with HD -TIV 
(unpublished data, [CONTACT_225719] McCuller’s laboratory, St. Jude, Memphis, TN). The main results  are published in 
Pediatric Blood  Cancer .56 
5. Inclusion  of Quadrivalent  Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (QIV).  Although two influenza B lineages have 
been co -circulating since the 1980s, TIV contains only one B strain, which provides little -to-no protection 
against the alternate B -lineage strain; however, about 70% of recent B viruses have been antigenically relat ed 
to the B virus component of the trivalent flu vaccines .[ADDRESS_271287] the second B strain while retaining non -inferior immunogenicity to the other 3 TIV 
strains.57,58 High dose QIV will not be available for the upcomi ng influenza season ( personal communication 
with [COMPANY_011] Pasteur ). This study will be the first to evaluate standard dose QIV and HD -TIV in this population.  
6. Rationale . Patients who have undergone HSCTs have a higher burden of disease from influenza infection 
compared with healthy controls, with significant morbidity and mortality due to influenza disease. They are also 
at high risk of influenza -associated complications, particularly pneumonia. Thus,  strategies to reduce influenza 
disease in  this highly susceptible population are critical, especially since these individuals respond poorly to 
standard dose IIV. HD-TIV has increased immunogenicity and efficacy in adults  ≥[ADDRESS_271288] Dose Flu Vaccine in Pediatric Stem Cell Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_225640]  16-0117

burden, morbidity, and mortality in these high -risk patients.  
 
C. Research Design and Methods:   
 
1. Study Design: The proposed study is a multi -center, phase II immunogenicity and safety trial comparing 
HD-TIV to standard dose QIV in pediatric HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] . Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashi on to 
receive either 2 doses of 0.5 mL HD-TIV (60µg of each influenza antigen) or [ADDRESS_271290] dose QIV 
(15µg of each influenza antigen) of the season -specific vaccine  28-42 days apart . HAI and microneutralization 
(MN) titers  to influenza virus antigens, phenotypic B and T cell responses, B and T cell specific influenza 
responses, complete blood count  with differential and platelets ( CBC  d/p), quantitative CD4+/CD8+/CD19+ 
levels, and quantitative serum IgM and IgG concentrations will be measured prior to the first and second 
vaccine dose, 28-42 days after the second vaccine dose , and 180 days ( +42 days) after second vaccine . If 
children are receiving  intravenous (IV)/subcutaneous (SC) immunoglobulin (I G)  during any visit , additional 
sera will be collected to measure HAI and MN titers following  IVIG/SCIG  dose administration . A subset of 
children will have cellul ar imm une responses measured 5 -10 days after each vaccination . Approximately 20-40 
mL* of venous blood will be obtained at each of these visits. Parents/subjects will record solicited events for 7 
days after each vaccination  (Day 0 -7). On days 1 -3 and 8 -10, an attempt of telephone and/or electronic 
commun ication will be made to assess for solicited AEs following each vaccination. Each female of 
childbearing age will be given a pregnancy test before each vaccination. If she is pregnant, she will not be 
eligible for the study.   
 
*Note, for all blood draws, if blood is being drawn and discarded for clinical reasons, blood volumes can 
exceed [ADDRESS_271291] time during the 2018 -2019 season will be approached and asked to participate a  second  year.   
 
Influenza Surveillance : Active surveillance for influenza -like symptoms will begin when influenza season 
starts in each site’s community. I nfluenza season begins in the specific community, defined as in previous trials 
by [CONTACT_225685] [ADDRESS_271292] 10% of diagnostic tests 
positive during 2 consecutive weeks in the local clinical or research laboratory.60,61  Enrollment will continue  
during influenza season  with nasal swabs obtained at all main visits during the influenza season  to document 
the occurrence of influenza virus detection both prior to and after vaccination.   
 
During the influenza season, the study staff will attempt to do a weekly  telephone and/or electronic 
communication with the participants to detect and document  any influenza like illness ( ILI). 
 
If subjects meet ILI criteria (see below), a nasal swab will be collected .

5. Treatment G roups:  There will be two groups – HD-TIV versus standard dose Q IV. The ch ildren will be 
randomized in a 1 :1 HD-TIV (100 subjec ts) versus standard dose QIV (100  subjects)  for current enrollment 
season .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a. Randomization:  Subjects will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_271306] dose QIV. Randomization 
will be frequency -matched within each site to ensure balance between the groups  and will be implemented 
using the Randomization Module within Vanderbilt’s REDCap database.  The investigational pharmacy at each 
of the [ADDRESS_271307]-transplant , we will limit enrollment to 6 0 (30%) subjects to ≥[ADDRESS_271308]-transplant.   
 
For block randomization:  
1. For subjects 12 -35 months since transplant, we will do block randomization on the following 
question:  “Is the subject currently being treated for GVHD with  systemic  steroids ?” (yes/no) ; if yes, they 
will be evenly distributed for randomization.  
2. For subjects 3 -11 months since transplant, block randomization will be on the following question:  “Is the 
subject  currently being treated for GVHD with  systemic  steroids or does the subject fall into one or 
more the following criteria: history of campath ( alemtuzumab) ; history of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) ; 
cord transplant; h aploidentical transplant ; or post -transplant cytoxan  (cyclophosphamide)? ” 
3. Repeaters will retain their randomization numbe r given from their initial enrollment and will not be re -
randomized  
 
b. Enrollment : Subjects will be enrolled from the Outpatient Pediatric Oncology /HSCT  units, clinics , or clinical 
research centers at each institution. The healthcare team will help identify individuals w ho are eligible and will 
ask permission to be approached about the study. The research team will inform the subjects and their 
parents/guardians of the study and its procedures. Consent will be given to them to review. Ample time will  be 
given to explain the study and answer any questions prior to signing the consent.

undertaken, or not attributable to GVHD, or not attributable to complications of  immunosuppressive 
medications that are observed or reported  through 7 days following vaccination  (Day 0 thr ough Day 7) , 
regardless of their relationship to study product.  
 
• Any other AE will not be reported unless it meets the SAE criteria (see Section 16.f). 
 
Initial vaccine reactions will be assessed for at least [ADDRESS_271310] both solicited vaccine reactions and any unsolicited AEs on a memory aid for 7+ days after each 
vaccination (Day 0 through Day 7). Study personnel will  attempt  contact [CONTACT_225688]/or 
electronic communication at 1-3 days and 8 -10 days after vaccination to review any AEs and SAEs. Adverse 
events and serious adverse events will be collected through 7 days following vaccination.  
 
Solicited systemic AEs  will be collected for 7+ days post each vaccination and will include the following:  
fevers, headache, fatigue/malaise, nausea, body ache/myalgia, general activity level, and v omiting . Solicited 
injection site AEs  will include the following: pain, tenderness, redness /erythema , and swelling /induration  at 
injection site . 
Reporting of Deviations : All deviation s will be reported to the IRB at the time of annual continuing review. 
Note: if the deviation affects patient safety and/or risk , the event will be report ed immediately.

light. The vaccine will b e stored in  secure, limited -access, temperature -monitored refrigerator 
environments at 2°C to 8°C (35.6°F to 46.4°F) until needed. The temperature of the storage unit will be 
monitored for the duration of the trial, and documentation of proper dedicated storage will be 
maintained. It will not be frozen. In the event of accidental deep -freezing or disruption of the cold chain, 
vaccines will not be administered.  
d. Dosage, Preparation and Administration of Study Intervention/ Investigational Product  
Either dose (0.5 ml) of TIV or QIV (Fluzone® HD -TIV, [COMPANY_011] Pasteur ) or (Fluzone Quadrivalent® , 
[COMPANY_011] Pasteur  will be administered intramuscularly in either the right or left arm. In preparing either 
vaccine, the pre -filled syringe will be gently shaken and visually inspected for particulate matter and/or 
discoloration prior to administration (the TIV/QIV may normally be clear to slightly opalescent). If either 
condition exists, the pre -filled syringe will not be used.  
 
Subjects will be randomized in a 1: 1 fashi on to receive either 2 doses of 0.5 mL HD -TIV (60µg of each 
influenza antigen) or [ADDRESS_271313] dose QIV (15µg of each influenza antigen) of the current seasonal 
influenza vaccine (e.g. 2016 -2017 or 2017 -2018  or 2018/2019  or 2019/2020 ) 28-42 days apart.  The repeaters 
retain their randomization code.  
 
Each of these study products will be labeled according to manufacturer specifications and include the 
statement “Caution: New Drug – Limited by [CONTACT_12201].”  
 
e. Modification of Study Intervention/Investigational Product for a Participant  
No dose modifications will be allowed.  
 
11. Side Effects with Influenza V accination. The side effects  listed in the package insert include:  
a. Local Reactions: In placebo -controlled studies among adults, the most frequent side effect of vaccination 
is soreness at the vaccination site (affecting 10% –64% of subjects) that lasts ≤ 2 days. These local 
reactions typi[INVESTIGATOR_225664]’ s ability to conduct usual daily activities.  
 
b. Systemic Reactions: Fever, malaise, myalgia, and other systemic symptoms can occur following 
vaccination and most often affect persons who have had no exposure to the influenza virus antigens in the 
vaccine (e .g., young children). These reactions begin [ADDRESS_271314] for 1 –
2 days. Recent placebo -controlled trials demonstrate that among older persons and healthy young adults, 
administration of split -virus vaccine is not associate d with higher rates of systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, 
malaise, myalgia, and headache) when compared with placebo injections. Immediate, presumably allergic 
reactions (e.g., hives, angioedema, allergic asthma, and systemic anaphylaxis) rarely occur after i nfluenza 
vaccination. These reactions probably result from hypersensitivity to certain vaccine components; the 
majority of reactions likely are caused by [CONTACT_225691]. Although current influenza vaccines contain

 Influenza Surveillance :  
Active surveillance for influenza -like symptoms will begin when influenza season starts at each site’s 
community. I nfluenza season begins in the specific community, defined as in previous trials by [CONTACT_225698] [ADDRESS_271327] 10% of diagnostic tests positive during [ADDRESS_271328] nasal swabs from patients who meet the ILI criteria during the  entire  study 
period.  
 
When the flu season starts, the study staff will attempt to do a weekly telephone and/or electronic 
communic ation with the participants to detect and document any influenza like illness (ILI) . Patients who meet 
the ILI criteria will be asked to collect a nasal swab and mail it back to the study site.  
 
ILI criteria:  One of following criteria met:  
• Fever:  ≥38.3°C (101°F); or  
• Two or more of any of the following: respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856] ( rhinorrhea, sinus congestion, post -
nasal drip, shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, sputum production, sore throat, sneezing, watery 
eyes, ear pain, hoarseness); or systemic s ymptoms (myalgias and headache).  
 
A nasal swab will be collected . If distance is an issue  or if symptoms start on a weekend , subjects will be given 
PrimeStore MTM to take to their local pediatrician’s office , or with proper instructions, home collection can be 
done, and arrangements will be made for specimens to be sent either to the local academic center or directly 
to Vanderbilt in Nashville, TN . Specimens should be collected within 7 d ays of onset of symptoms, ideally 
within 48 hours.  
 
Note: For subjects who finish their visit 4 before the end of the flu season, i nfluenza surveillance will continue  
until the end of the flu season at th eir site’s community .  
 
Visit  4: 180 D ays ± 42 after  Visit 2 
• Approximately 20-40mL of blood will be collected for HAI and MN assays to influenza virus antigens, 
phenotypic B, and T cell responses, B and T cell specific influenza responses, CBC  d/p, quantitative 
CD4+/CD8+/CD19+ levels, and quantitative  serum IgM and IgG concentrations.  
• A second blood draw will be obtained post -IVIG/SCIG  if administered . 
• Only during influenza season, a nasal swab will be obtained, regardless of symptoms.  
• For the 2019/[ADDRESS_271329] the procedures outlined above.  
 
Optional visit s: 5-10 days after each vaccination  
• Only those subjects who volunteer, will return for a blood draw only.

a. Specimen Preparation, Handling, and Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]:  Blood will be collected from a vein or from a 
central line from subjects. Study personnel or clinical research staff will collect the blood 
samples, label without personal identifiers, and deliver to the laboratory for preparation of serum 
and freezing of the sera until further testing and/or shipment to [COMPANY_011] laboratory for HAI and 
MN testing and B and T cell influenza -specific testing at Vanderbilt. Other clinical labs will be 
sent the local lab.   
b. Hemagglutination Inhibition Assays (HAI):  Sera will be sh ipped  to [COMPANY_011]  laboratory for HAI 
testing. Sera will be initially diluted 1: [ADDRESS_271331] -vaccination 
sera will be analyzed simultaneously to minimize variability in the HAI assay. HAI titers will be 
determined for each  influenza antigen included in Q IV 2016 -2017  or 2017 -2018  or 2018 -2019.  
c. Neuraminidase Inhibition Assa ys (NAI):  Sera will be shipped to Vanderbilt for NAI testing and 
results will be compared to HAI.  NAI testing will be done at [CONTACT_225720]’s lab in Mt. 
Sinai.  
d. Microneutralization assays : Sera will be shipped to [COMPANY_011]  laboratory for MN testing and 
results will be compared to HAI.68 
e. Influenza -specific B and T cell Responses and I mmunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_31081] B and T cells:  
Samples  will be collected at baseline, 5-10 days (optional) and 28 -42 days after each 
vaccination  and 180 days ( +42 days) after second vaccination . After ficolle  separation, 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) will be cryopreserved for future analysis.  Each site 
will do this locally and the off -sites will ship to [CONTACT_225721] labora tory at Vanderbilt  in 
Nashville, TN . This will ensure all time points fr om each individual can be evaluated 
simultaneously.  We propose to study B and T  cell responses to vaccination with mass cytometry 
technology (CyTOF), and functional assays such as in-vitro IL-21 production in response to 
vaccine antigen.  
f. Nasal swabs:  a nasal swab  will be collected by [CONTACT_225699] , which can be stored at room temperature until ready for shipment to 
Vanderbilt in Nashville, TN for PCR testing for influenza.  
 
16. Specification of Safety Parameters:  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_35043], incidence and severity of AEs and SAEs solicited in -clinic and via 
memory aids, telephone and/or electronic communication  conversations, concomitant m edications , and 
periodic physical evaluations.  
 
Safety monitoring plan post 15 minute  vaccination : Either a nurse, NP, or LPN will administer the vaccine. 
The subject will wait at least [ADDRESS_271332] access to individuals with advanced cardiac life support skills.  
 
Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Parameters

 (reactogenicity) and any unsolicited AEs on a memory aid for 7+ days after each vaccination (Day 0 through 
Day 7). Study personnel will  attempt to  contact [CONTACT_225700]/or electronic communication  at 1 
to 3 days and again 8 -10 days after  each  vaccination to review any AEs and SAEs.   
AEs and SAEs will be collected through 7 days following each vaccination. Adverse events will be followed 
until resolution or until considered stable.  Solicited injection site AEs  will include the following: pain, 
tenderness, erythema/redness, and swelling/induration (Table 4). Solicited systemic AEs  will be collected for 
7+ days post each vaccination and will include the following: fe vers, fatigue/malaise, headache, nausea, body 
ache/myalgia, generally activity, and vomiting  (Table 5) .  
 
b. Definition of Adverse Event :  
Adverse Event:  The International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guideline E6 defines an AE as any 
untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical 
product regardless of its causal relationship to the study treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally related to  the 
use of medicinal (investigational) product. The occurrence of an AE may come to the attention of study 
personnel during study visits and interviews or by a vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_12189].   
AEs must be graded for severity and relationship to study product (see below). Severity can be assessed by a 
licensed clinician (i.e., physician, nurse, nurse  practitioner, physician’s assistant). Relationship to study product 
can only be assessed by a clinician licensed to make medical diagnoses (i.e. physician, nurse practitioner, 
physician’s assistant) listed on the Form FDA 1572.  
Adverse events characteriz ed as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
The start and stop date of each reported AE will be recorded on the data collection forms and eCRF.  
c. Severity of Event:  AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_19811] a protocol  defined grading system. For 
events not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used to quantify 
severity :  
• Grade 1 -Mild: events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the patient’s daily activities.  
• Grade 2 -Moderate : events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Grade 3 -Severe : events interrupt a patient’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or 
other treatment. Severe events are usually incapacitating  or Life-threatening , i.e. any adverse drug 
experience that places the patient or subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from 
the reacti on as it occurred . It does not include a reaction that had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death.  
 
d. Relationship to study products/vaccines :  
The investigator’s assessment of the relationship of an AE to the study drug/vaccine is part of the 
documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. If there is any 
doubt as to whether a clinical observa tion is an AE, the event should be reported. AEs must have their possible 
relationship to study vaccine assessed using the following terms: related  or not related . In a clinical trial, the 
study product must always be suspect. To help assess, the following  guidelines are used.  
• Related  – The event is temporally related to the administration of the study product and no other etiology 
explains the event.  
• Not Related  – The event is temporally independent of study product and/or the event appears to be 
explained  by [CONTACT_11693].

f. Serious Adverse Event :  
An SAE is defined as an AE meeting one of the following conditions:  
• Results in death during the period of protocol defined surveillance  except deaths that are the result of 
trauma or accident . 
• Is life -threatening (defined as a subject at immediate risk of death at the time of the event).  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_225667] -
defined surveillance.  
• Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
• Any other important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, the even t 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
Note*  
The SAEs should not be attributable to underlying disease for which the transplant was undertaken, or not 
attributable to GVHD, or not attributable to complications of immunosuppressive medications . 
 
g. Reporting Procedures : 
Adverse events including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the 
appropriate case report form ( CRF). Information to be collected for unsolicited adverse events  includes event 
description, date of onset, invest igator assessment of severity, investigator assessment of relationship to study 
product, date of resolution of the event, seriousness, and outcome. The severity  of non -serious AEs will be 
assessed by a licensed clinician (i.e., medical doctor, nurse, nurse  practitioner, physician’s assistant). The 
relationship  of non -serious AEs will be assessed by a licensed clinician (i.e., medical doctor, nurse practitioner, 
physician assistant) listed on the Form FDA 1572. All AEs occurring during the AE reporting perio d of the study 
will be documented appropriately regardless of relationship.  AEs will be followed to adequate resolution or until 
considered stable.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at screening will be considered a baseline condition and will not be  
reported as an AE. If the severity of any pre -existing medical condition increases during the study period, then 
it will be recorded as an AE.

the FDA no later than 7 calen dar days after SAE awareness.  
• SAEs related to  the study vaccine that are unexpected and serious  (not fatal or life -threatening)  are to 
be reported to the FDA no later than 15 calendar days af ter SAE awareness.  
• All other SAEs will be submitted with the FDA Annual Report in summary form.  
• All SAEs unex pected and deemed related to the study vaccine will be reported to [COMPANY_011] within 7 -15 
calendar days after SAE awareness.  
SAEs occurring through  7 days following  vaccination will also be reported to the local IRB within 1 -2 calendar 
days as the team becomes  aware of the SAE or per local IRB protocol/procedures.  
Any AE that meets a protocol -defined serious criterion as defined in Section 16.f will be submitted immediately 
(within 24 hours of site awareness) on a SAE form to the DMID Pharmacovigilance Group, to the following 
address:

 i. Independent Safety Monitor (ISM)  and the Data Safety Monitoring Board  (DSMB):  
An Independent Safety Monitor ( ISM) is a physician at the enrollment site with relevant expertise whose 
primary responsibility is to provide independent medical assessment in a timely fashion at each site. Each site 
will have an ISM and back -up ISM. Participation is for the duration of the study.  
The ISM should be able to readily access participant records in real time , have the privileges to examine the 
subject, and provide an independent medical assessment and recommendation to the IND sponsor and DMID . 
The primary focus of the ISM is to independently review all SAEs with follow -up through resolution and 
thoroughly investigate those events considered unexpected. Clinical and laboratory data, clinical records, and 
other study -related records should b e made available for ISM review. The ISM may be a faculty member at the 
clinical site but will not be under the direct supervision of the PI. It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_225669] t he study product and the study.   
Safety oversight will be conducted by a Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) that is an independent 
group with expertise to interpret data from this study and will monitor subject safety and advise DMID and the 
IND spons or. The DSMB members will be separate and independent of study personnel participating in this 
study and should not have scientific, financial, or other conflict of interest related to this study.  The committee 
will consist of a minimum of 3 members.  A sim ple majority will be considered a quorum for meeting purposes.  
The DSMB will operate under the rules of a DMID -approved charter  that will be written at the organizational 
meeting of the DSMB and  defines the data elements to be assessed and th e procedures f or data reviews. At 
this time, each data element that the DSMB needs to assess will be clearly defined. Procedures for DSMB 
reviews/meetings will be  defined in the charter. The DSMB will review applicable data to include, but not limited 
to, overall study progress and participant, clinical, safety, reactogenicity , and immunogenicity  data. Reports 
may include enrollment and demographic information, medical history, concomitant medications, physical 
assessments, clinical laboratory values, dosing compli ance, and solicited and unsolicited AE/SAEs . Additional 
data may be requested by [CONTACT_4318], and interim statistical reports may be generated as deemed necessary 
and appropriate by [CONTACT_225703]. The DSMB may receive data in aggregate and presente d by 
[CONTACT_2939].  The DSMB may also be provided with expected and observed rates of the expected AEs in an 
unblinded fashion, and may request the treatment assignment be unblinded for an individual subject if required 
for safety assessment.  The DSMB will  review grouped and unblinded data in the closed session only.  The 
DSMB will meet and review this data at scheduled time points or ad hoc as needed during this study  as 
defined in the DSMB charter.  As an outcome of each review/meeting, the DSMB will make a  recommendation 
to the IND sponsor and DMID as to the advisability of proceeding with study vaccinations (as applicable), and 
to continue, modify, or terminate this trial.  
DMID or the DSMB chair may convene the DSMB on an ad hoc basis according to protocol  criteria or if there 
are immediate concerns regarding observations during the course of this trial . The DMID Medical Monitor is 
empowered to stop enrollment and study vaccinations if adverse events that meet the halting criteria are 
reported. The DMID Med ical Monitor and the ISM will be responsible for reviewing SAEs in real tim e. The 
DSMB will review SAEs on a regular basis and ad hoc during this study . 
The DSMB will review study progress and participant, clinical, safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenici ty data 
at the following times:  
o Data review for safety and reactogenicity at specified times during the course of this trial – every [ADDRESS_271336] patient is enrolled until the end of the study.  
o Final review – [ADDRESS_271337] Dose Flu Vaccine in Pediatric Stem Cell Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_225640]  16-0117

 summary format.  The DSMB may be asked to provide recommendations in response to questions 
posed b y the IND sponsor and DMID.  
o Ad hoc when a halting rule is met, for immediate concerns regarding observations during this study , or 
as needed – for a specific safety concern, such as SAE deemed related  to the study vaccine.  
 
j. Halting Rules : 
The ISM of each site , DMID,  and DSMB will be provided safety data in order to advise on matters of safety, 
including halting the trial. The safety data will consist of immediate reactogenicity events (in the 15 minutes 
after vaccination), reactogenicity events record ed on the memory aid (each day for the week after vaccination), 
AEs, and SAEs. The data will be entered into ONCORE and/or REDCap and provided to the ISM , DMID, and 
DSMB  for review. The presentation of the data will include whether any events contributing towards a halting 
rule have  been met. The frequency of DSMB review will be defined in the charter .  
The study  will be halted (for further DSMB  review/recommendation) if any of the following occur  and it was not 
the result of trauma or accident , scheduled h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_64329], and is not attributable to disease relapse, 
GVHD, or and infection due to the immunosuppresse d state of the patient . No new subjects will be enrolled  if: 
1. If one subject has  an SAE and  the adverse event is deemed severe within [ADDRESS_271338] the same Grade 3 event in any reactogenicity category (excluding 
grade 3 redness/ induration size or grade 3 fever) that is determined to be study vaccine -
related , no new subjects will be enrolled. The  AEs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_9288] B for the 
relationship with the study vaccine.  For [ADDRESS_271339] 7 days following administration of study vaccine .  
 
 
If any of the halting rules are met, the study will not proceed with the remaining enrollment or vaccinations 
without a review by [CONTACT_225704]. CBER will be notified if a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_225670] y. DMID retains the authority to suspend additional enrollment and 
study interventions/administration of study product during the entire trial, as applicable . 
 
k. Safety Oversight : 
The Vanderbilt -Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) oversees patient safety and data  monitoring for its investigator -
initiated and NIH -NCI funded clinical trials through its Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). The 
Committee maintains authority to intervene in the conduct of studies as necessary to ensure clinical research 
perform ed at VICC achieves the highest quality standards.  
  
l. Data and Safety Monitoring Committee /Quality Assurance :  
The Vanderbilt -Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) oversees patient safety and data monitoring for clinical trials 
through the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). The committee will convene on a quarterly basis 
and ad-hoc as necessary. The DSMC provides o versight of the internal audit function. During audits the

 Quality Assurance (QA) auditor will review selected case histories. In addition they will conduct a regulatory 
and pharmacy audit as needed. The data presented to the DSMC will be blinded unless th e committee 
requests un -blinded data.  The DSMC will determine if the findings in the audit report require a response from 
the Principal Investigator. After reviewing submitted corrective action plans, the committee has the authority to 
approve the continua tion of the study, increase the frequency of auditing, suspend accrual , or terminate a 
protocol ; however, this will be in discussion with the DSMB.  
 
This trial will be monitored continuously by [CONTACT_1758]’s principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_225671] a weekly and monthl y basis 
by [CONTACT_225705].  Quarterly safety and monitoring report s are available to the DSMC . The DSMC 
reviews all serious adverse events reported during the previous quarter for all clinical trials active at the VICC 
and makes recommendations to addres s concerns of patient safety. Since data from REDCap will be 
transferred to Oncore, the DSMC will be able review all safety data from all nine sites.   
 
A Quality Assurance auditor under the direction of the DSMC will audit this clinical trial quarterly for  compliance 
with adverse event reporting, regulatory and studies requirements, and data accuracy and completion. Audit 
reports detailing the findings are provided to the DSMC.  
 
Any DSMC c ommunications regarding safety evaluations will be shared with the Chair of DSMB and the 
DSMB.  This information will also be shared with FDA -CBER and NIH .  
 
m. Blinding:  
All study staff, subjects, and their parent/guardians will be blinded to which vaccine the subject will receive, 
except for an un -blinded vaccinator.  This individual will not inform the study team, subjects, and/or their 
parent/guardians which vaccine they administered to the subject.   The un -blinded vaccinator will not participate 
in any other study activities.  If the study vaccine is provided in a blinded  manner , then research staff will be 
able to administer the vaccine, and an un -blinded va ccinator will not be necessary. The pharmacy will be un -
blinded and will have a record of which vaccine was given to each subject.  
 
n. Vaccine Labeling Plan:  
The following statement will be used: “Caution: New Drug – Limited by [CONTACT_4496] (or [LOCATION_002]) law to 
investigational use” and subjects and parents/guardians will be informed of this during the consent process.   
 
17. Statistical Considerations:  
a. Sample Size Calculations : A total of 200 children will be targeted , with 100  in each group. This 
is based on the assumption, with 80% power, that 20% of the children in the standard dose 
group will achieve a protective titer compared to 40% of the HD-TIV group for at least one 
influenza antigen. Accounting for a 20% drop out rate,  [ADDRESS_271340] dose  N (HD)  N (SD)  Power  Total N

distribution of the probabilities under all [ADDRESS_271341] and HD-TIV crossed with a 
single dose and two doses. From these probabilities, odds ratios will be calculated along with 
95% credible intervals.  These quantities will be modeled as a logit -linear function of several 
covariates, including CD4+/CD8+/CD19+ and IgG levels, absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte 
count (or their ratio), time from post -transplant to enrollment, type of preparative regimen, donor 
status, and stem cell source. In additi on, the distributions of geometric mean HAI titers for high

increase, and >70% with ≥1:40) .69 
 
c. Safety analysis:  For the primary analysis of the safety data, the proportion of subjects in each 
group experiencing at least one solicited AE will be calculated along with 95% posterior credible 
intervals.  The difference between the rates of solicited AEs between the groups will be 
estimated by [CONTACT_225707] 95% credible interval of the difference in proportions.  For 
each group and each event, solicited and unsolicited AEs will be descriptively summarized.  
Severities of solicited and unsolicited AEs will al so be descriptively summarized for each group 
and each type of event.  Descriptive statistics will include number experiencing event, mean and 
95% posterior credible interval.  Maximum size of redness and swelling may be descriptively 
summarized for each gro up and event; proportion of events lasting longer beyond Day 3 may 
also be descriptively summarized.  
 
d. Specific B and T cells responses:  We will estimate the association between HAI titers and 
expression of ICOS and CD40L on CD4+CXCR5+ T cells. We anticipat e that the frequency of 
circulating T FH cells with expression of ICOS and CD40L will directly correlate with higher 
influenza titers. We will also estimate the association between HAI titers and the distribution of 
circulating plasmablasts (CD19+CD27+CD38+ ), using either parametric linear models or 
Gaussian processes if the relationship cannot adequately be modeled linearly. In addition to the 
phenotypic analysis, we will perform in vitro stimulation of PBMC with influenza antigen. We will 
measure the degre e of ICOS and CD40L expression of CD4+CXCR5+ T cells in the presence 
or absence of antigen, and model the relationship between response and HAI titer, where we 
predict responders to have higher HAI titers. Comparisons between marker expression on 
CD4+CXCR5 + T cells in the presence or absence of antigen and correlations between HAI titer 
and Marker expression on CD4+CXCR5+ T cells will be evaluated by [CONTACT_225708] T cell counts on HAI titers. We will compare both linear and non -linear fits to the data, 
and choose the optimal model as determined by a model selection criterion, such as AIC. 
Should the parametric models not adequately fit the data, we will use a semi -parametric 
regression via Gaussian processes as a robust alternative.

e. Subject Confidentiality : 
1. All information will be in the research record that will be handled by [CONTACT_147849]. Th e 
results of the res earch study may be published, but volunteers’ names or identities will not be 
revealed. Records will remain confidential.   
2. In order t o maintain  subject confidentiality, records will be kept locked and results of tests will be 
coded to prevent association w ith volunteers’ names. This confidentiality is extended to cover 
testing of biological samples in addition to the clinical information relating to participating 
subjects. Volunteers’ records will be available to the FDA , NIH,  external monitors, and the IRB . 
3. The study protocol, documentation, data and all other information generated will be held in strict 
confidence. No information concerning the study or the data will be released to any 
unauthorized third party, without prior written approval of the sponsor . 
4. The following confidential information will be collected into folders and stored in a safe, locked 
location, identified only by [CONTACT_105751]: age, gender, race, family history, social history, full 
address, phone number (home, cell, and work), and date of birth, fax number, secondary name, 
birth history, and contact [CONTACT_6227], and email address of the subject’s parent/legal guardian.  
5. The records will be sent to storage after study completion and data analysis.  
6. Serum samples will be collected during thi s study and stored with their subject ID as the only 
identifiers. Laboratory assays containing data from the study will be labeled only with volunteer 
code numbers.  
7. The information in the REDCap or ON -Core database will only include non -identifiable 
inform ation.  
f. Study Discontinuation : 
If the study is discontinued, enrolled subjects will continue to be followed for safety assessments. No further 
doses of vaccine will be administered. Samples will be stored at Vanderbilt . 
 
g. Future Use of Stored Specimens : 
Subjects will be asked for permission to keep any remaining specimen for possible use in future research 
studies, such as testing for antibodies against other viruses or bacteria.  By [CONTACT_2054], all  samples 
will be stored at Vanderbilt. The samples may be shared with other  investigators. The samples will not be sold 
or used directly for production of any commercial product. No human genetic tests will be performed on 
samples prior to obtaining new, written permission (consent) from the subject. Each sample will be labeled with 
a unique number to protect  the subject’s confidentiality. There is a small risk of loss of confidentiality. The 
samples will be stored indefinitely.  
 
There are no benefits to subjects in the collection, storage , and subsequent research use of specimens . 
Reports about future research done with subject’s samples will NOT be kept in their health records, but 
subject’s samples may be kept with the study records or in other secure areas. Subjects can decide if they 
want their samples to be used for future re search or have their samples destroyed at the end of the study. A 
subject’s decision can be changed at any time prior to the end of the study by [CONTACT_225712]. However, if a subject consents to future use and some of thei r blood has already been used 
for research purposes, the information from that research may still be used.   
 
19. Data Handling and Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] : 
The investigator is responsible to ensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data 
reported.  All data collection forms should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate 
interpretation of data. Black or blue ink is required to ensure clarity of reproduced copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. When making a

erase, overwrite, or use correction fluid or tape on the original.  
 
a. Data Capture Methods : 
For all the sites, the data will be entered into a standardized, secured database: REDCap  (Research Electronic 
Data Capture) system. REDCap is a secure, web -based application designed to support data capture for 
research studies, providing: 1) an intuitive  interface for validated data entry; 2) audit trails for tracking data 
manipulation and export procedures; 3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to 
common statistical packages; and 4) procedures for importing data from external sources .70 The research team 
at each site will be given a user name [CONTACT_225718].   
 
At Vanderbilt, safety data from REDCap maybe  transferred to On-line Clinical  Oncology  Research 
Environment  = ONCORE  (OnCore ) is a highly secure, web based, cancer specific, and customizable system 
that provides fully integrative clinical data management and study administration capabilities developed in an 
ongoing collaborative effort with National Cancer Institute ( NCI) design ated Comprehensive Cancer Centers. It 
fully integrates study administration functionality including protocol tracking, patient registration, NCI reporting, 
review committee tracking, and SAE tracking, with clinical data management functionality including e lectronic 
case report forms (eCRF) design, clinical data capture, protocol and regulatory compliance monitoring. Also 
the system is capable in storing basic protocol information (e.g., IRB approval dates, dates for annual 
renewals, etc.) and clinical trial s research data. Oncore allows the investigator to define specific protocol 
requirements and generate data collection forms. Creation of the data collection form is done with a single 
button click after the parameters of an individual protocol have been sp ecified. Oncore permits specification of 
study protocols, management of patient enrollment, clinical data entry and viewing, and the generation of 
patient or study -specific reports based on time stampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. OnCore is embedded with a comprehensive domain 
repository of standard reference codes and forms to promote standardization. The sources for the repository 
include CDUS, CTC, CDEs from NCI, ICD, MedDRA and various best practices from contributing NCI -
designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers. OnCore provides several reporting features specifically 
addressing NCI Summary 3 and Summary 4 and other reporting requirements. Data may also be exported in a 
format suitable for import into other database, spreadsheets or analysis systems (such as SPSS). This system 
will be used to manage all Vanderbilt Ingram Can cer Center (VICC) clinical trials data. OnCore is maintained 
and supported in the VICC  Clinical and Research Informatics Resource. A copy of the paper records will be 
retained for at least 7 years after completion of the study. The information stored in the ONCORE and REDCap 
database will be kept indefinitely.  
 
 20. Publication Policy : 
The intention of this study is to publish the da ta from this trial.  The International Committee of Medical Journal 
Editors (ICMJE) member journals have adopted a trials -registration policy as a condition for publication. This 
policy requires that all clinical trials be registered in a public trials registry such as Clinica lTrials.gov , which is 
sponsored by [CONTACT_1055]. Other biomedical journals are considering adopting similar 
policies.  
 
21. Certificate of Confidentiality:  
To protect privacy, we have received a Certificate of Confidentiality.   With this Certificate, the researchers 
cannot be forced to release information that may identify the research subject, even by a court subpoena, in 
any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other procee dings.   The researchers will 
use the Certificate to resist any demands for information that would identify the subject, except as explained 
below.  
 
Comparison of High vs. Standard Dose Flu Vaccine in Pediatric Stem Cell Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_225640]  16-0117  
Protocol Version  8.0                                                                                                                                             
 Date:  9/12/[ADDRESS_271343] be released in order to meet the requirements of the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  
 
A Certificate of Confidentiality does  not prevent the subject from voluntarily releasing information about 
themselves or their involvement in this research.   If any person or agency obtains a written consent to receive 
research information, then the researchers may not use the Certificate to withhold that information.  
  
The Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent the researchers from reporting without the subject’s consent, 
information that would identify the subject as a participant in the research project regarding matters that must  
be legally reported including: child and elder abuse, sexual abuse, or wanting to harm themselves or others.    
 
The Certificate of Confidentiality applies only under US law.

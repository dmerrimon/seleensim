Non- invasive treatment options are in high demand by [CONTACT_482436]. As a result, patients now have a variety of options for non -invasive skin rejuvenation, 
from laser and light -based treatments to devices that utilize ultrasound and radiofrequency, however this was 
not always the case. Conventional treatment of dyschromia pi[INVESTIGATOR_482428], respectively [1,2]. Dyschromia and diffuse redness can also be treated by [CONTACT_482437], whereby [CONTACT_482438][INVESTIGATOR_2517] -producing skin cells [ 3, 4]. Absorption of laser light by [CONTACT_482439], leading to the ablative destruction of unwanted blood vessels and pi[INVESTIGATOR_482429]. However, since ablative treatments destroy the epi[INVESTIGATOR_482430], ample post -procedure recovery time is required and patients may experience side effects lasting 
for a few w eeks. Furthermore, hypo - or hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], prolonged wound healing and even scarring can 
occur following ablative laser treatments [ 5-7]. Treatment methods with less risk of side effects and post -
treatment down time are in high demand. As such, the choices are vast and varied, ranging from fractional non-ablative laser devices to those that use radiofrequency [ 8-15]. Fractional lasers inflict microscopic zones 
of thermal damage in the dermal layers of the skin without destruction of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196], thereby [CONTACT_482440] [16]. Treatment with non- fractional, non -
ablative laser devices requires little to no post -procedure recovery time. In addition, the micro -thermal 
damage zones and heating within the dermis results in immediate collagen contraction and heat -induced 
wound healing that, over time, causes a cascade  of cellular events leading to new collagen production and 
improved skin appearance [ 17-18].

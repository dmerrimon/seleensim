1. PURPOSE OF STUDY 
To prospectively investigate the efficacy of an insertable cardiac monitor-guided atrial 
fibrillation (AF) management in reducing subsequent atrial arrhythmia burden in patients 
with persistent AF undergoing ablation.  This is a Phase 4 study, and we are comparing two 
management strategies that are currently employed in clinical practice.
2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
Percutaneous catheter ablation to achieve pulmonary vein electrical isolation is an effective 
and recommended treatment for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Catheter ablation for persistent 
AF is more complex, often may involve ablation of additional targets that maintain AF. 
Nevertheless, recurrence rate after a single ablation procedure in patients with persistent AF 
is in the range of 50%-70% at 1-year, and 70%-90% at 2-years. Accordingly, catheter 
ablation for persistent AF has been associated with less favorable outcomes. Continued 
antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) use, or redo AF ablation procedures often can improve outcomes 
in persistent AF patient’s further substrate deterioration if sub-clinical AF recurrences are 
detected by [CONTACT_10104].  Thereby, we propose utilizing the Biotronik ICM 
(BioMonitor3® or future generation of Biotronik ICM) in persistent AF patients following 
AF ablation to guide post ablation strategies of AAD treatment and/or repeat AF ablation and 
to continuously post-AF ablation to reduce the burden of atrial arrhythmia. However, these 
management strategies are currently limited to a subset of patients who present with 
symptomatic AF post-AF ablation, possibly late in the clinical course, due to lack of 
appropriate continuous monitoring tools following the procedure. With the Biotronik 
insertable cardiac monitor (ICM) in persistent AF patient’s post-AF ablation, one may be 
able to provide patient-specific tailored management, and to identify those who may benefit 
from early intervention to prevent monitor AF burden. We hypothesize that early patient-
specific intervention, guided by [CONTACT_10101], will be associated with a significant 
reduction in AF-burden at [ADDRESS_9363] line therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation. Therefore, many patients with 
persistent AF are referred for AF ablation today without being on an AAD (Calkins, et al. 
Heart Rhythm, Vol 14, No 10, October 2017), thereby [CONTACT_10105].  
 
Patients with persistent atrial fibrillation remain a challenging population in terms of 
achieving and maintaining sinus rhythm. Recent studies (Heart Rhythm. 2018 Mar; 
15(3):363-368) have reported pulmonary vein isolation ablation to be a "safe, effective, and 
efficient" treatment. However, even with extensive ablation of PV isolation plus other 
targets, the recurrence of atrial arrhythmia post ablation for persistent AF ranged from at 
Page 2 of 19
Version Date: [ADDRESS_9364] 41 to 54% with periodic ambulatory ECG monitors (Schreiber, et al. Circ Arrhythm 
Electrophysiol 2015; 8:308–317.; Verma, et al. N Engl J Med 2015; 372:1812–1822.). Most 
clinicians suspect the recurrence rates to be substantially higher if more robust surveillance is 
obtained. We had previously reported on the efficacy of hybrid therapy combining ablation 
of atrial flutter circuit and medical therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation who converted 
to atrial flutter with medical antiarrhythmics (Huang, et al., JCE May 1998, 9(5):462-469), 
and noted the importance of maintaining medical antiarrhythmic therapy to achieve long term 
substrate modification leading to sinus rhythm. A recent study reported >90% patients who 
experience AF events during the typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 3 months blanking period actually develop recurrent 
atrial arrhythmia by 1 year (Willems et al. Circ Arrhythm Electrophysiol 2016;9(8). Early 
recurrence of AF during the post ablation blanking period may be more aggressively treated 
to help reduce risk of late recurrence of AF. Therefore, in our study, we propose to initiate 
monitoring AF events during the blanking period, starting from the first month post-AF 
ablation (to allow sufficient time for post ablation healing). On the other hand, it is postulated 
that a subgroup of patients with persistent AF may respond well to repeat ablation alone, 
similar to patients with paroxysmal AF (Kirchhof, Calkins. European Heart Journal, 2017 
Jan; 38(1):20–2). Thus, a management strategy of uniform continued AAD post ablation for 
persistent AF will result in unnecessary medical therapy in responders to the procedure. We 
therefore hypothesize that a patient-specific management strategy that incorporates 
continuous monitoring with Biotronik ICM will result in improved outcomes and resource 
utilization compared to conventional management in this high-risk population.

4. STUDY DESIGN
This is a multi-site, randomized clinical trial of approximately 90 subjects with 45 subjects in 
each arm randomized (1:1) to conventional AF management vs. Biotronik ICM-guided AF 
management following ablation for persistent AF. The study subject population will include 
subjects with history of  persistent atrial fibrillation (sustained AF epi[INVESTIGATOR_10087] 
7 days, but less than 1 year), according to current guideline indications for persistent AF 
ablation and ICM (Biotronik ICM) implantation. Clinical and functional data will be

Version Date: 21 April 2021 Ver2.0captured related to: activity, heart rate, blood pressure, weight, quality of life status, and 
clinical events.
A total of 4 high-volume sites will be enrolling subjects for this study. Estimated enrollment 
will be 1-2 subjects per study site per month. Patients will be enrolled at the time of the AF 
ablation and will be followed for 15 months after a 3 month blanking period following AF 
ablation. The planned study startup period is 3 months with an enrollment period of 10 
months, a follow-up period of 15 months, and 2 months for closeout and analysis for a total 
of 30 months (2.5 years).

approved informed consent are randomized 1:1 into:
The Intervention ICM-based AF management Arm
In the intervention arm, the ICM obtained data will be actively used to guide and monitor 
treatment (See Figure 2A and B).  A report of AF data (comprising the total number of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], duration, average heart rate response, and correlation with patient-reported 
symptoms) will be provided to the treating physician/nurse at monthly intervals, starting 
from the first month post-AF ablation from the study team comprised of 
electrophysiologists and cardiologists. A general recommendation for early intervention 
with AAD continuation/resumption or redo AF ablation will be provided to the treating 
physician if recurrent AF epi[INVESTIGATOR_10091] (≥2 epi[INVESTIGATOR_10092] a duration of 
≥ 6 minutes each), even without the presence of clinical symptoms. However, the final 
decision regarding management will be left to the discretion of the treating physician.  
oManagement during the blanking period: Treatment with AAD after ablation will 
be left to the discretion of the treating physician per standard of care. If the patient 
is on an AAD after ablation, medical therapy with AADs in the intervention arm 
will continue for 3 months after the index CA procedure arm. Symptomatic AF 
recurrences during the blanking period will be treated with cardioversion. If, 
either SCAF (as defined above and in Figure 2A) is detected by [CONTACT_10110]-month post-ablation (i.e. during the 
second or third months), AAD therapy will not be discontinued at 3 months per 
protocol (or will be initiated for those not treated with an AAD after ablation). AF 
recurrence during the blanking period will not be an indication for re-ablation.
oManagement after the blanking period: If SCAF recurrences detected by [CONTACT_10111] 
(as defined above and in Figure 2B) or if clinical recurrence occurs after the 
blanking period, treatment will be escalated as follows:
oIf the patient is not on an AAD after the blanking period, treatment with an 
AAD will be resumed (to the same drug discontinued at 3 months) or initiated 
(type of AAD will be left to the decision of the treating physician as per 
standard of care). Alternatively, if the patient does not tolerate or does not 
wish treatment with an AAD, the patient can be referred for repeat AF 
ablation. 
oIf AF recurrence occurs on AAD, the e patient will be referred for re-ablation. 
oThe ICM-derived heart rate monitoring data will also be used for improved 
rate control (with a target mean heart rate of <80-100 bpm) regardless of atrial 
rhythm.

Version Date: 21 April 2021 Ver2.0Plans for return of research results:
Research results will not be provided directly to patients, but will be presented in national 
conferences and published in peer-reviewed papers after study completion. If requested by 
[CONTACT_1962], we will send the published research results to patients.
9. RISKS TO SUBJECTS
This is a prospective study in subjects with persistent AF undergoing ablation and ICM 
implant prior to randomization.  The study is not evaluating any medical device. The study 
includes the use of a currently available ICM to investigate the efficacy of an insertable 
cardiac monitor-guided atrial fibrillation (AF) management in reducing subsequent atrial 
arrhythmia burden. 
There is some risk of associated with the use of any medication. It is important to note that in 
this study, we are using standard of care and recommended guideline directed medications 
already indicated in this population of patients; which are often associated with improved 
outcomes.  We are not testing new medications.  Medications inherently may be associated 
with side effects. The clinical research team is experienced in cardiovascular trials and the 
clinical management of patients with heart disease/heart failure and will be monitoring for 
any adverse effects and adjust medications accordingly. This is a Phase [ADDRESS_9374] protected electronic data capture (EDC) system.   Subjects will be assigned a 
unique subject identification number at the time of registration, which is completed in the 
EDC system. The subject identification number is not connected with any PHI, such as date 
of birth or medical record. Each enrolling site will maintain an internal key linking the 
subject’s name [CONTACT_10124].  
10. POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO SUBJECTS
There are no potential benefits to subjects. 
11. COSTS FOR PARTICIPATION
There are no additional costs to the subject. All office visit/procedures follows standard of 
care guidelines.
12. PAYMENT FOR PARTICIPATION 
Subjects will be reimbursed per the institutional policies for each enrolling site (e.g., cash,

Version Date: [ADDRESS_9375]).  
13. SUBJECT WITHDRAWALS
Subjects enrolled in the study may be withdrawn prior to the study completion for a variety 
of reasons including:
• Subject withdraws consent for any reason;
• Subject is lost to follow up despi[INVESTIGATOR_10094];
• Subject is withdrawn at study investigator discretion.
Subjects may be considered lost to follow up after missing two consecutive follow-up visits 
with documented efforts to contact [CONTACT_423]. 
These subjects will not undergo any additional study activities after withdrawal. If a subject 
becomes pregnant during the course of a study, they will continue to be monitored but no 
longer be part of the interventional arm. Data collection will occur until the date of 
withdrawal and utilized in the study analysis.
Patients who complete fewer than [ADDRESS_9376] identifiers that 
are stored separately in a study log solely maintained by [CONTACT_10119]. 
The electronic data will be directly entered and extracted from computer system for data 
collection using encryption and physical controls. There is no plan to share, transmit or 
transfer the data. 
15. DATA/SAMPLE STORAGE FOR FUTURE USE
Study coordination, database management and statistical analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_10120] (CCRC) at the University of [COMPANY_002]ster Medical 
Center (U of R) acting as the Coordinating Center for the study.  
Data will be captured using TrialMaster, a HIPAA compliant secure web-based electronic 
data capture (EDC) system that is used to support the clinical research process.  Data that are 
entered are validated against a set of rules to ensure the accuracy of the clinical data.  The 
TrialMaster system is housed on CCRC servers that are housed behind the U of R firewall in

Adverse Event Reporting 
Investigators shall report to their local IRB per local reporting guidelines, and report in the 
electronic data collection system within five business days of PI [INVESTIGATOR_10095], serious and unanticipated adverse events that are related to participation in the 
study. Events related to standard of care such as medications side effects do not need to be 
reported unless severe as defined below. Death of a subject must be reported as an adverse 
event, per the serious adverse event definition below. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_10096], including the Institutional Review Broad (IRB). 
The CDC will be forwarding relevant documents to the Chair of DSMB for review and the 
Chair will determine whether individual case will require immediate assessment by [CONTACT_10121]. The 
main point of assessment by [CONTACT_10122].

Version Date: 21 April 2021 Ver2.0Serious Adverse Event Definition 
This population is at increased risk of heart failure, death, and poor clinical outcomes. A serious 
adverse event (SAE) is defined as any adverse medical experience that results in any of the 
following outcomes: 
death; 
is life-threatening; 
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
results in permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function; 
requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage; 
leads to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect. 
 
Data Safety Monitoring Board
A data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be convened to independently monitor the 
conduct and the outcomes of the trial. The DSMB will be responsible for monitoring the 
safety and well-being of the patients participating in this study and ensuring the ethical 
conduct of the trial.  The DSMB will be responsible for safeguarding the interests of study 
participants, assessing the safety and efficacy of study procedures, and for monitoring the 
overall conduct of the study. The DSMB will be an independent group advisory to the study 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_10097], 
continuing, and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098]. In addition, the DSMB is asked to make 
recommendations, as appropriate, about:
Efficacy of the study intervention
Benefit/risk ratio of procedures and participant burden
Selection, recruitment, and retention of participants
Adherence to protocol requirements
Completeness, quality, and analysis of measurements
Amendments to the study protocol and consent forms
Performance of individual centers and core labs
Participant safety
Notification of and referral for abnormal findings
Data on clinical events including procedural complications, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], stroke, atrial 
tachyarrhythmias, and death will also be collected by [CONTACT_10123]. 
The board will be comprised of 3 independent members: (1) 1 statistician with experience in 
clinical trials; (2) [ADDRESS_9379] with expertise in clinical trials; and (3) [ADDRESS_9380] 
with expertise in ablation. 
The DSMB will meet before trial commencement and 3 times after each group of 30 patients 
Page 18 of 19
Version Date: [ADDRESS_9381] to non-
parametrically compare the overall survival curves for the two treatments. The other 
secondary endpoints of atrial flutter/tachycardia recurrence, repeat ablation incidence, and 
major adverse events will be compared utilizing negative binomial regression tests to 
statistically compare the event rates in the two arms, using the natural log of follow-up time 
as an offset. Quality of life measures will be compared between the arms using the non-
parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
The estimate for the sample size necessary to compare AF burden at 12 months between the 
conventional AF management arm vs. the Bio-Monitor 3-guided repeat ablation arm will 
assume a 1:[ADDRESS_9382] a re-ablation rate of 50% in the intervention arm vs. 5% in the 
conventional arm (in which only clinical epi[INVESTIGATOR_10099]). 
For the planned analysis of the primary end point of AF burden involving the Wilcoxon rank-
sum test, a two-sided  = 0.05 and power of 80% was assumed. Based on our preliminary data 
and our prior studies on AF burden (The HARMONY Trial, Circulation Arrhythmia and 
Electrophysiology, 2015), the 12 month primary outcome of AF burden is assumed to be 
25% vs. 16% in the conventional group, with a standard deviation of 15% (a conservative 
estimates which allows for 10% drop-out). A reduction from 25% to 16% and 80% power, 
Page 19 of 19
Version Date: 21 April 2021 Ver2.0with a drop-out rate of 10%, will result in a total sample of 90 patients.
18. COORDINATING CENTER TRACKING
Acting as Coordinating Center for the study, in order to ensure all required information is 
provided to the Sponsor IRB, a Coordinating Center Tracking Spreadsheet will be submitted 
at the time of each annual progress review.

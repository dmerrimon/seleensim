 1.[ADDRESS_1080159] lens has been touted as a 
“revolution” in the evolution of contact [CONTACT_785200], 
a consistent barrier to the global growth of t he contact [CONTACT_785201].   With the silicone core 
and six micron thic k hydrophilic surface gel, this lens is designed to mimic the ocular surface 
and increase lubricity while maintaining optimal oxygen permeability.   While all types of 
contact [CONTACT_785202][INVESTIGATOR_785163] a decrease in apoptotic -mediated surface cell shedding and a 
corresponding increase in size of surface cells, the cellular impact of the water gradient

 An advertisement will be sent out to all medical students, graduate students, 
postdoctoral scholars and allied health students using the campus list -server network.  
 If further needed, a general advertisement will be placed in the Dallas Morning News to 
attract volunteers from the general public.  
From the dropout  rates seen in our previou s studie s, we have found that [ADDRESS_1080170] 90 % of patients  (84) complete the study.  Overall, we plan to generate the 
required number  of patients within the first six  months and allow these to enter the study such 
that smooth and continuous tes ting is maintained.

 3.[ADDRESS_1080171] lens studies require that 
patients wear the same lens in each eye which corrects vision to acceptable levels 
(≥20/30 OU) for daily function.  
3.4.[ADDRESS_1080172] subjects will be randomized to either the D AILIES  TOTAL 1 or 
the ACUVUE TruEye .  Lenses will be worn for daily wear over a 2 month time period.  
Following a second washout period, subjects will be fi t in the second lens material  
(crossover arm)  for an additional [ADDRESS_1080173] group.  Since 
the methods of data collection are objective and standardized, outcome data samples 
will be analyzed indepe ndently in masked fashion.  
3.4.4 Sample Size Determination and Statistical M ethods  
A total of 140 patients will be recruited for this study.  Sample size calculations (detailed 
below) and statistical methods to detect significant changes in the outcome mea sures 
were derived from our previous studies evaluating the effects of silicone hydrogel lens 
wear on the corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130] (Ladage et al, Ophthalmology 2001; 108: 1279 -1288 and 
Robertson et al,  IOVS  2008; 49:  7 -15). The magnitude of change for of all outcome 
measures will be simultaneously compared between lens types using a  Type I error rate 
of α=0.05.  Statistical analysis will be completed in the Department of Clinical Sciences 
and Biostatistics at UTSWMC.  
 
A. Surface epi[INVESTIGATOR_785174].  In our prior studies , silicone 
hydrogel lens wear worn in a daily modality reduced corneal surface epi[INVESTIGATOR_785175] 40 -50% .  We hypothesize that the impact on epi[INVESTIGATOR_785176] 
(cells/minute) will be less following wear of the Dailies Total 1 (delta ≤ 20% reduction) 
compared to wear of a standard silicone hydrogel daily disposable, the ACUVUE TruEye  
(delta ≥ 40% reduction ).  Assuming a difference in means between the two test lenses of 
16.3 cells/minute and a standard deviation of 37 cells/minute, a total sample of [ADDRESS_1080174] 80% power at a significance level of α=0.0 5.

13 | P a g e  
 B. Drop  outs  
Additional subjects were added to compensate for the potential dropouts to satisfy the 
requirements for completion of  the 6 month study.   Based upon our previous clinical 
trials, we anticipate a dropout rate of 1 0-12%. In the absence of time, cost, and ethical 
concerns, Guo et al. (2013) suggested choosing the largest sample size to guarantee 
power for all 2 tests. Therefore, we will recruit a total of 94 subjects  for this cross -over 
trial.  That is, 47  subjects will be allocated to each sequence in this 2x2 cross -over trial.

 4.1.1.a  Patient Orientation  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_785177], as well as derived benefits  (see below:  human subjects 
protection).  
Key elements to be stressed include:  
 Necessity for wear of corrective spectacles after all ocular irrigation procedures, 
including driving home afterwards.  
 A need to complete the study voluntarily to receive a $140 allowance for frames and 
spectacle lenses  (anything above the allowance to be paid by [CONTACT_2299]), and a 
monetary bonus of $125 .  Involuntary termination, excluding non -compliance, will not 
result in loss of benefits.  
 
4.1.1.b Comprehen sive Ocular E xamination  
Volunteers who meet all criteria above, and who wish to participate in the study, will undergo a 
comprehensive ocular examination as follows:  a single standard room (tw enty -foot test lane 
within the contact [CONTACT_13293] s ervice) and the same examining e quipment will be used for all patients 
on all visits.  
 
The examination will be  performed sequentially as follows:  
 Snellen visual acuity testing (OU)  
o This will be performed using  a standard projector chart at twenty feet .  
All patients will be refracted to ensure that visual acuity and prescription 
are within the inclusion criteria.

 4.3.2 Clinical Assessments  
4.3.2.a Overview  
Significant numbers of visits and complications are not anticipated.  Since it is important not to 
disturb successful lens wear, brief clinical screen ing will be performed as detailed below.  
4.3.2.b Clinical Screening P rocedures  
History :  At each visit, the screening clinical observer will ascertain any history of (both 
eyes):  
 Redness  
 Visual change  
 Pain  
 Irritation  
 Decreased w earing time with unscheduled lens removal  
 Excessive lens movement or  displacement  
 
Screening exam  
At each visit, the clinical observer will perform (Table III): 
 Snellen VA measurement at 20 feet  
 Slit lamp exam  
 In the absence of any historical or clinical ( objective) abnormalities, wear will 
proceed or experimental testing will be performed

 4.3.2. c  Unscheduled lens removal  
Patients are instructed to remove their lenses following the RSVP clinical rule:  redness 
(irritation), sudden change in vision, or pain.  They will then be examined as soon as they are 
able to come to the clinic  on an emergency basis by [CONTACT_204523] 24 -hour telephone number 
(after hours) or the Contact [CONTACT_785214] (8 a.m. – 5 p.m., Mon -Fri) to rule out serious 
complications of lens wear.  Once the problem has resolved, the patient will be reinstated into 
the study .  If lenses are removed for any reason of positive ocular findings (Ta ble III  above) by 
[CONTACT_785215], or by [CONTACT_102], the following additional steps will be taken.  
o Fluorescein strip staining will be applied (as above) to determine if the corne al 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_785179] (punctate epi[INVESTIGATOR_143592]).  
o If indicated, corneal infiltrates will be cultured in thioglycollate broth, and on 
chocolate and blood agar plates; Saboraud’s media will be used additionally if 
fungus infection is suspected.  The patie nt will be removed from the study and 
accordingly treated with antimicrobial therapy.  
4.3.3 Laboratory A ssessments  
In general, laboratory assessment of each patient is performed sequentially as follows:  
4.3.3.a  Tear collection  
Tear collection will be perf ormed as the first clinical test.  Three µl sample volumes t ears will be 
collected non -invasively in vivo using microcapi[INVESTIGATOR_785180]. Tears will be collected with the patient seated at the slit lamp 
with the light on low illumination.  Pooled tear samples will be placed in DNase free 
microcentrifuge tubes and briefly centrifuged at maximum speed to ensure all tears are at the 
bottom of the tube.  Samp les will then be maintained on ice while in the clinic and transferred 
to the -80˚ freezer for storage until processing.  The procedure for tear collection and 
extracellular DNA quantification has been published elsewhere (Tibrewal et al, IOVS  2013).   
Extracellular DNA present on the posterior surface of the contact [CONTACT_785216] -
EDTA buffer and processed in parallel with the tear samples.  
4.3.3.b   Corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_785181] -invasively in vivo using a  custom -made  ocular 
irrigation chamber specific for these types of studies.  The corneal irrigation chamber collects 
corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_785182] a [ADDRESS_1080184]; a fixation tar get is placed to orient the eye to be irrigated downwards; and 
the irrigating tip is positioned 2 mm below the corneal apex.  Irrigation involves the delivery of 
9 ml of sterile saline to the central cornea for a period of 1 minute via a tubing pump (Cole -
Parmer Instrument Co).  By [CONTACT_785217], a 
precise area of the ocular surface can be washed preventing contamination of conjunctival 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_11036].  We and others have established the validity of this techni que.  Intersubject variation 
has likewise been established.  Studies will be performed on left eyes of patients after lens

 removal.  Care is taken to count only corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], which can readily be distinguished 
from conjunctival cells by [CONTACT_785218]  (as previously published ).  The 
total shedding rate per minute is also attained.  
4.3.3.c In vivo confocal microscopy  
Details of the clinical use of this micr oscope are given in Appendix A.1.6 .  For these studies, a 
Heidelberg  HRT confocal microscope engineered in house with remote controlled scanning 
capabilities will be utilized in the proposed studies  (Petroll et al, Cornea , 2013) .  One drop of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_785183]'s eye; the subject's head is the n placed in the 
headrest as for regular slit lamp examination.  Care must be taken to adjust the height of the 
chin rest to a comfortable level such that the patient can rest both feet flat on the floor to 
minimize movement.  A drop of Genteal (Alcon Labor atories) is placed upon the top of the 
objective lens to serve as an immersion fluid. The cornea is then applanated using the standard 
tomocap objective lens tip. Both confocal microscopy through focusing scans and static images 
of the corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] s urface will be acquired  in the central cornea and in the temporal 
quadrant of the limbus  by [CONTACT_785219]’s direction of gaze .  Similar image 
sequences will be performed to  sequentially  image the upper eyelid  at the midpoint  of the 
eyelid  (corresponding to the 5 and 7 o’clock position of the limbus).   For upper lid imaging, the 
lid will be everted prior to image acquisition.   Sequential imaging will allow for subsequent 
montage generation of the mid -point of the upper lid.   
5.[ADDRESS_1080185] (IRB) of the University of [LOCATION_007] Southwestern Medical Center.  As both lenses are FDA 
approved, this will undergo an expedited study and we anticipate approval within a four week 
time period.  Studies will commence upon approval.  The investigator is responsible for 
ensuring that patients understand the intent of the investigation and their questions have been  
answered to their satisfaction before signing the Patient Informed Consent.  The investigator is 
responsible for making sure each patient is aware of the time requirements and cooperation 
necessary on his/her part.  The investigator will retain a copy of the consent form in the 
patient’s file and a copy will be given to the patient.

5.[ADDRESS_1080187] Lens W ear 
Lens wear will be discontinued by [CONTACT_128762] a temporary basis in accordance with the RSVP 
clinical rule (as defined above); and examined as soon as possible thereafter on a scheduled or 
24-hour emergency basis.  Following standard FDA contact [CONTACT_785220], an adverse 
reaction is defined as an unanticipated complication that might have been  attributed to the use 
of the test lens or following testing (irrigation), and if untreated or ignored would have led to 
progressive or permanent reduction in visual acuity or resulted in sustained ocular damage; 
such occurrences will be reported promptly to the IRB and to the study sponsor.  
In general, an adverse reaction, patient non -compliance, or patient choice will be the cause for 
discontinuance from the study.  Major potential outcomes mandating discontinuance include:   
2. The investigator will discont inue a patient at any time during the study for any 
reason if, in her opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], it is in the best interest of the patient.  The reason must be 
recorded.  
3. A patient may voluntarily withdraw from the clinical trial for any reason.  This 
reason must be recorded . 
4. Discontinuation may be needed when the patient has not worn lenses for more 
than two days due to non -compliance.   
5. Additionally, patients may need to be discontinued because of protocol deviations 
or because of lack of follow up or relocation.  A patient  is considered lost to follow 
up if a scheduled visit is missed and the patient is unresponsive to repeated 
attempts at rescheduling.  
6. Patients will be discontinued if monitoring of the clinical trial reveals an 
unacceptable level of device related adverse events, even though some patients are 
not affected.  
 
There are certain actions that are required for discontinued patients:  
1. The investigator will perform an ocular examination and document the results and 
reason for discontinuation.  Patients who have posi tive slit lamp findings that are at 
least one whole grade greater than baseline should be subsequently followed until 
their findings are stabilized and returned to baseline.  
2. The investigational lenses must be retrieved from the patient.  For relocated 
patients or those lost to follow up it must be documented that every attempt and 
effort was made to locate the patient and retrieve all investigational lenses.  
3. Should a patient be discontinued because of an ocular complication or adverse 
reaction, visits must be documented until recovery of ocular he alth and full visual 
acuity has  been achieved, if such can occur.

specific visits or tests will be taken to the clinic or laboratory for data recording.  These will be 
returned to the master file the same day of completion . 
 
6.2 Dat a Entry and Storage  
Data entry will be accomplished in the Department of Ophthalmology upon completion of a 
visit.  The patient’s master file containing all completed forms will be kept in the clinical 
research office under secure conditions.  Weekly backups will be c ompleted for the entire 
database.  In order to protect the confidentiality of patients, data access will be denied to all 
but authorized personnel.  This will be achieved by a password system for the datasets.  
Further, patient names and other sensitive da ta will be encrypted on all storage media.  To 
further ensure confidentiality, data collected within the laboratory and data sent to the 
biostatistician will all be numerically coded.

analysis.  Patient confidentiality will be ass umed during data analysis in that the patient names 
will not be used but will be numerically coded.  Data will be analyzed using an intent -to-treat 
approach.  
 
Continuous demographic  and baseline characteristics will be compared between the DAILIES 
TOTAL1 and the ACUVUE TruEye using Student’s t -tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests.  Categorical 
demographic and baseline characteristics will be compared between the DAILIES TOTAL1 and 
the AC UVUE TruEye using Fisher’s exact tests or Chi -square tests.  
 
Data analysis will be specific to the objectives outlined below:  
Robertson DM.

 1.   The primary experimental objective of this study is to characterize the effect of the 
DAILIES TOTAL1 compared to a control, high oxygen permeable silicone hydrogel daily 
disposable contact [CONTACT_13293], the ACUVUE TruEye,  on corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_785185].  
This effect will be assessed using a standardized ocular irrigation technique to measure:  
  a.   Rate of desquamation of corn eal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] (cells/min).  
 
In this cross -over trial, treatment effects and carryover effects on the rates of desquamation 
of corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] (cells/min) will be compared between two treatment groups using 
Student’s t -tests in Rosner (2006) , and ANOVA in Chow and Liu (2014).  If the p -value is less

normal illumination.  
3) The top of the capi[INVESTIGATOR_5778] y tube is applied to the temporal edge of the tear meniscus inferiorly.  
4)  Three microliters of tears will be collected without touching the lid, conjunctiva or cornea 
to avoid stimulating reflex tearing  from each eye . 
5) Right and left eye samples will b e pooled  in a DNase -free microcentrifuge tube .  Similarly, 
DNA extracted from the right and left  worn  lenses will be pooled.   
6)  All tear samples will be collected by a single trained investigator, numerically coded at 
time of collection and masked to la boratory personnel.   
7)  Samples will be frozen at -80°C until use.  
8) Total DNA levels in tear  sample volumes taken from each po oled sample will be assessed  
using the  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_785190]  (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) . 
A.1. 3 Lid Wiper Staining  
Fluorescein and lissamine green staining will be used to assess the upper and lower lid wiper in 
the left eye of all subjects after lens removal.  
1)  2% unpreserved fluorescein and 1% lissamine green will be sequentially instilled onto the 
inferior palpebr al conjunctiva of the left eye.  
2)  Three minutes following dye instillation, the upper eye lid will be everted using a cotton 
tipped applicator and LWE staining evaluated.  
3)  Fluorescein staining will be visualized using Cobalt blue illumination and a Wratten No. 12 
filter (Kodak, [LOCATION_003]).  Lissamine green staining will be illuminated using white light.  Staining will 
be imaged using a SONY digital camera mounted to the slit lamp.  
4)  Staining will be graded according to the horizontal linear area (length) and the sagittal height 
(width) as published by [CONTACT_785222], Cornea  2010.  The individual grades for length and width will 
be averaged to a final grade for fluorescein and a final grade for lissamine green.  The higher of 
the final fluorescein and lissamine green staining grades were used as the LWE severity 
according to the following scale:

A.1. 4 In Vivo  Confocal M icroscopy  
In vivo confocal microscopy will be performed on left eyes after lens removal.  
1) 1 drop of topi[INVESTIGATOR_15413] (tetracaine) is placed in the lower cul -de-sac of the right and left 
eyes.  
2) The patient is seated such that the head is co mfortably placed in the microscope chin -
forehead rest with no hypo -hyper neck extension, both feet are flat on the floor and both arms 
are allowed to rest on the microscope table.  
3) The patient fixates on the wall (distance) or near (light) target with th e right  eye to provide 
good fixational acuity.  
4) One drop of Genteal (Alcon Laboratories, Ft. Worth, TX ) is placed on the applanating tip to 
couple the cornea to the objective.  The microscope joystick is used to adjust the microscope in 
the x -y-z directi on to ensure proper alignment on the central cornea.  
5) The remote controller is used to scan through the full thickness cornea.  Images will be 
acquired by [CONTACT_785223] . For assessments of limbal changes, including the 
presence of dendri tic cells, the limbal epi[INVESTIGATOR_785191] 3o’clock

Similar methodology will be used for the lid margin, with eversion of the upper eyelid required.   
Scanning of the lid margin will be performed using sequential image capture of overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_785192] 5 o’clock position of the limbus to the 7  o’clock position.  
7) Note that the patient can freely withdraw backwards at  any time desired.   
8) When enough good quality images have been obtained, the patient withdraws the head, and 
microscopy is terminated.  
10) For measurements of surface epi[INVESTIGATOR_785193], cell borders will be manually delineated 
on screen using MetaMor ph software and total area per cell determined .   
11) Dendritic cells present in the limbus will be manually counted from 3D image stacks using 
MetaMorph software.  
 
A.1. 6 Exfoliated Cell Collection  and Quantitation  
Ocular irrigation will be performed on the left eyes after lens removal and after staining with 
fluorescein.  
1) The patient will be seated with forehead resting against a headrest; a fixation target is placed 
to orient the eye to be irrigated downwards.  
Robertson DM.

 2) The i rrigating tip is positioned 2 mm below the corneal apex.   
3) Irrigation involves the delivery of 9 ml of sterile saline to the central cornea for a period of 1 
minute via a tubing pump (Cole -Parmer Instrument Co., Chicago, IL).   
4) Following irrigation, sample s will be immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde.  This will be 
accomplished by [CONTACT_1583] 9 ml of 8% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Services) to the 
existing 9 ml of sterile saline containing exfoliated cells.  
5) Samples will be mixed by [CONTACT_785224].  
6)  The f ixed cell  suspension will be  passed through a syringe filter holder containing a 13 
mm diameter, 5 µ m pore size polycarbonate filter (Nucleopore) to collect cells.

 A.[ADDRESS_1080193] lenses are used for the correction of blurred vision due to light being out of focus in 
non-diseased and otherwise healthy eyes.   
STUDY PARTICIPANT GENERAL DIRECTIONS  
• Please read and understand all the warnings, daily checks, precautions, contra -indications and 
adverse reactions sections.  
• Do not wear any other lenses and use only the solutions provided by [CONTACT_785227].  
• It is important that you attend all scheduled office visits and wear your lenses as prescribed.  
LENS WEARING SCHEDULE  
• Lenses will be worn only during waking hours.  Non -preserved saline, provided by [CONTACT_93944], may be used to rinse lenses prior to insertion.  Upon removal, lenses will be 
stored in the appropriate vials until your next scheduled appointment.  At no time will lenses 
be left in overnight or re -used on additional days.   
WARNINGS  
You must follow the verbal instructions given to you by [CONTACT_785228], lens care products, 
daily checks and precautions as this is essential for the safe use of contact [CONTACT_785229].  Ignoring and disregarding thi s advice could result in serious injury to the eye.  
DAILY CHECKS  
Why should I check my eyes?  
Although daily wear contact [CONTACT_785230], in appropriate use of daily lenses can result 
in a serious eye infection.  Regularly checking your eyes and acting appropriately should you 
detect any problems will significantly reduce the risks involved with lens wear.  
 
How should I check my eyes?  
Ask yourself these qu estions:  • Do my eyes LOOK as they normally do?  
• Do my eyes FEEL as they normally do?  
• Do my eyes SEE as they normally do?

 If the answer is no to any of these questions then you should take the actions described below in  
“What should I do if a problem occurs ” to remedy the problem and more importantly to prevent 
the occurrence of a serious adverse reaction.  
What should I look for?  
Some of the signs and symptoms of developi[INVESTIGATOR_785197] r vigilance and prompt action are  vitally important to reduce to a minimum the 
risks involved with contact [CONTACT_13279].  
You should specifically check for the following:  
• Redness:   A red eye indicates an irritated eye.  You may not feel any discomfort so always 
check in the  mirror.  Compare the eyes - increased redness in one eye only is highly 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_785198].  
• Watering:   This is typi[INVESTIGATOR_785199].  Is it occurring in both 
eyes?  
• Light Se nsitivity:   Most contact [CONTACT_785231].  You may need to use sunglasses more often.  Be cautious if you 
notice a sudden increase in the sensitivity of your eyes to light , especi ally if it occurs in one 
eye only.  
• Discomfort:   Never ignore times when your eyes and lenses have become less comfortable.  
Some things like a speck of dust or lint under the lens can be easily removed by [CONTACT_785232], rinsing and reinserting the lens.  More serious 
problems such as superficial damage to the cornea will cause a progressive increase in 
discomfort.  The sooner this is assessed and treated the better.  
• Illness:  Feeling unwell can have an impact on how your eyes cope with the contact [CONTACT_13276].  In 
general if you have an illness such as influenza  or viral gastroenteritis, where the body feels 
very "run down" – it is best that you DO NOT wear your lenses.  
What should I do if a problem occurs?  
1. Remov e your lenses  
2. If the discomfort or problem stops look closely at the lens  
3. If the lens is in any way damaged, DO NOT put the lens back on your eye.  Return the lens to 
the storage case and contact [CONTACT_785233]  
4. If the lenses have dirt,  an eyelash or other foreign bodies on them, or if the problem stops 
and the lenses appear undamaged, thoroughly clean, rinse and disinfect your lenses before 
re-inserting them.  
Note:  You must only use the lens care products given to you by [CONTACT_785234].

 5. If the problem does not stop, or if it recurs when you replace the lens, immediately remove 
your lenses and contact [CONTACT_785235] d following good hygienic 
habits, avoiding hazards, and understanding the nature of your lenses and how they work.   This 
is a list of precautions  you must follow to prevent damage to your eyes or your contact [CONTACT_13276]:  
• Always wash and rinse your hands befo re you handle your lenses.  Eye irritation may result if 
cosmetics, lotions, soaps, creams or deodorants come in contact [CONTACT_785236].  
• Avoid using aerosol products such as hair spray while wearing your lenses. If sprays are used, 
keep your eyes close d until the spray has settled.  
• Always follow the lens care system explained to you for this study.  
• Always use fresh solution when rinsing lenses . 
• Do not use saliva or anything other than the recommended solutions to wet your lenses.  
• Never use tweezers or other tools to remove your lenses from the lens container.  
• Do not touch the lens with your fingernails since this may cause damage to the lens.  
• Do not swim with your lenses on your eyes.  
• Avoid all harmful or irritating vapors a nd fumes while wearing your lenses.  
• Always inform your employer that you wear contact [CONTACT_13276].  Some jobs may require that you 
not wear contact [CONTACT_13276].  
• As with any contact [CONTACT_13293], follow -up visits are necessary to assure your health.  
• Always consult your  eye care practitioner before using any medicine in your eyes.  
CONTRAINDICATIONS  
Do not use your contact [CONTACT_785237]:  
• Acute or subacute inflammation of the anterior chamber of the eye.  
• Any eye disease, injury, or abnormality of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would  affect 
the wearing of contact [CONTACT_13276].  
• Any active corneal infection (bacterial, fungal or viral) or purulent production (pus).  
• Insufficiency of lacrimal secretion (dry eyes)  
• Corneal hyposthesia (reduced  corneal sensitivity).  
• Any systemic disease which may affect the eye or be exaggerated by [CONTACT_35543].  
• Allergy to any ingredient in a solution used to care for your contact [CONTACT_13276].  
• Any medication which is contraindicated.

 ADVERSE REACTIONS  
Adverse reactions are symptoms and problems which are either known to occur and have been 
reported with the use of soft contact [CONTACT_13276], or new and unexpected findings.  In general these 
effects are both more severe and serious with the use of ext ended wear contact [CONTACT_13276].  
Additionally there are effects which are most frequently only associated with extended wear.   
Do not sleep in your lenses overnight or wear lenses continuously for more than the duration 
prescribed by [CONTACT_785233].  
 
The following adverse reactions have been reported:  
• Discomfort or feeling something is in the eye (a foreign body)  
• Corneal abrasion or ulcer (or a scraped area)  
• Eye infection  
• Stinging, burning, itching (irritation)  
• Excessive watering of the eyes (tearing)  
• Unusual eye secretions  
• Redness of the eyes  
• Reduced sharpness of vision (poor visual acuity)  
• Blurred vision, rainbows or halos around objects  
• Sensitivity to light  
• Dry eyes  
• Corneal swelling  
 
Reactions most frequently associated with contact [CONTACT_512343]:  
• Acute "Red Eye" Reactions  
The exact cause of this reaction is unknown.  The eye is likely to experience considerable 
discomfort, redness and watering.  This condition usually clears up with lens removal and 
leaves no permanen t damage to the eye.  
• Corneal Infection  
This can occur when the protective layer of the cornea is damaged (e.g. by a foreign body 
beneath the lens) and the wound becomes infected by [CONTACT_274917], some of which may 
be present in the normal healthy eye.   A severe infection can result in scarring of the cornea 
which may affect vision if located in the center of the cornea.  There have also been cases of 
patients suffering serious and permanent eye damage, including loss of the eye, following 
severe corneal infection.   Corneal infection can occur with daily  wear  of contact [CONTACT_13276] .   
 
When any of the above symptoms occur, a serious condition such as infection, corneal  
ulcer, neovascularization or iritis may be present which could result in blindness. Seek  
immediate professional identification of the problem and prompt treatment to avoid  
serious eye damage.

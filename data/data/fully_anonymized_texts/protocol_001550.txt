 Background and significance: 
     After a tooth extraction,  the alveolar process  loses a mean of 3.[ADDRESS_1038504] 3  months of healing . 1, 2 It loses up to 50% of its original 
dimension during the first year . [ADDRESS_1038505]  tooth extraction .6-9 Current methods  in socket grafting 
or ridge preservation  include the use of autogenous grafts (graft from the same individual) , 
allografts  (graft from different individual of the same species ), xenografts  (graft from different 
species), and alloplasts ( synthetic graft materials). These methods include  naturally derived or 
synthetic, resorbable or non- resorbable membranes . 10-[ADDRESS_1038506] been used, with different rates of bone form ation.4, 5 Usually, resorbable and  permeable  
synthetic membranes  require tension free primary closure, which increases surgical complexity, 
reduces t he amount of keratinized gingiva, disrupts the  architecture of soft tissues, and 
compromises the vascularity of the flap with  periosteal releasing incisions.  The micro -porosity of 
high-density polytetrafluoroethylene (dPTFE)  can exclude the bacteria and protect the graft even 
when exposed to the oral cavity .17 The successful use of (dPTFE) membrane  has been  
demonstrated in a nimal and clinical trials.18-[ADDRESS_1038507] in 
preventing ridge resorption22 while, x enografts maintain the dimensions of the ridge  better 
compared to allografts  alloplastic materials and natural healing . Sockets grafted with alloplastic 
materials (after >12 weeks)  provide the highest amount of vital bone  ( 45.5%), and the least 
amount of remnant graft material (13.7%), and connective tissue  (38.4%),  while, allograft

 provided (30%, 21.7%, 51%) , and xenograft  provided (35.7%, 19.3%, 44.4%)  respectively .[ADDRESS_1038508] that implant primary stability could  be affected by [CONTACT_758455].24  
 
    There is limited evidence  to support the use of growth factors, human platelet -derived materials, 
platelet-rich fibrin, and stem cells  as adjuncts to ridge preservation.23 Leucocyte and platelet -rich 
fibrin (L-PRF) alone or in combination with a graft material can improve soft tissue healing, bone 
regeneration, ridge preservation, and reduces infection rate,25-[ADDRESS_1038509] of L -PRF plug on the 
quality of newly formed bone in the preserved socket using non- resorbable membrane (d -PTFE). 
 Null hypothesis: 
The use of L-PRF plug, in combination with non-resorbable, open barrier membrane technique to fill the extraction sockets will have no effect on the quality of the newly formed bone nor on the 
dimensional changes of the ridge, compared to non- resorbable, open barrier membrane technique 
with natural blood clot. 
 
Alternative hypothesis: 
The use of L-PRF plug, in combination with non-resorbable, open barrier membrane technique to 
fill the extraction sockets will have a positive effect on the quality of the newly formed bone and 
on preserving the dimensions of the alveolar ridge, compared to non- resorbable, open barrier 
membrane technique with natural blood clot.

 Specific aims:  
The primary aim is to assess the  quality of the newly formed bone at the time of implant placement 
by [CONTACT_758456]. The second aim 
is to assess the  primary stability of the implant using the resonance frequency analysis (RFA) and 
insertional torque (IT) of the implant. The third aim is to  assess the horizontal and vertical changes 
of the residual bony ridge using Cone Bean Computerized Tomography (CB CT) analysis at 
baseline immediately after tooth extraction  and prior to implant placement at [ADDRESS_1038510] group will 
be filled with autogenous L -PRF Plug (Intralock ) and d-PTFE membrane (Cytoplast) will be 
laid on the top to seal the extraction socket. In the control group, d-PTFE membrane (Cytoplast ) 
will be laid on the top of twenty extraction socket s to allow natural blood clot formation in the 
extraction socket . To account for expected attrition, an additional four patient s will be tried to  be 
recruited in each group.  
 
Inclusion  and exclusion  criteria:  
The subject must have an unsalvageable tooth that is planned for extraction and delayed implant placement . The tooth should be free of acute odontogenic infections, and only the extraction 
sockets with  minimal to moderate bony defect will be included in the study.  
Any patient who is planned for full mouth extraction, who is a heavy smoker  (more than 10 
cigarettes a day) , who has  a history of malignancy , chemotherapy, radiation therapy,  
immunosuppressive disease, uncontrolled systemic disease, or any contraindications to surgical 
procedures will be excluded from the study . Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding  will be 
excluded as well. Also, for multi -rooted teeth, if the most coronal part of the interradicular septum 
is less than [ADDRESS_1038511] v isits:  
Screening Visit: All subjects will receive a comprehensive oral and periodontal examination. 
Patients who fulfill the inclusion criteria will continue in the study and will complete the baseline 
visit and all subsequent visits. After providing a thorough explanation about the study,  an informed 
research consent will be obt ained. The clinical examinations will be done on all patients by [CONTACT_758457]. If the patient is eligible, a pre-operative assessment  and 
treatment planning will be done at this stage . 
Visit 1 (Baseline) : Tooth extraction , ridge preservation procedure, and CBCT will be performed. 
Autologous blood will be withdrawn and centrifuged to make the L-PRF plug  in the test group. 
Intraoral occlusal photograph will be taken  before and after tooth extraction. 
Visit 2 (1-week from the baseline visit):  Suture removal, and post- surgical follow-up evaluation  
will be performed and intraoral occlusal photograph  will be taken.  
Visit 3 (4-week from the baseline visit):  Non-resorbable membrane will be removed and intraoral 
occlusal photograph will be taken . 
Visit 4 (12-week from the baseline visit): A conventional or digital impression of the site will be 
taken and intraoral occlusal photograph will be taken. Then CBCT will be performed for implant 
planning. Visit 5 (14-week from the baseline v isit): A bone core biopsy  will be performed and will be  
followed by [CONTACT_758458].  Intraoral occlusal 
photographs will be taken before and after the surgery.

 L-PRF plug preparation Protocol :[ADDRESS_1038514] up to six 9 ml tubes of 
blood. Tubes immediately are placed into the IntraSpin™ centrifuge. and counterbalanced with 
each other.  Centrifugation will be run at 2700 rpm for 12 minutes, however, in patient taking anti -
coagulant medication up to 18 minutes are recommended. The centrifugation would separate the 
red blood cells layer at the bottom, the platelet poor plasma layer on the top, and the L -PRF fibrin 
clot in the middle of the tubes. Fibrin clots will be taken out of the tubes and then will be placed in the small white cylinder of the Xpression™ box, and compressed until holder is level to cylinder. 
The plugs stay viable up to 3 hours, if they are re- hydrated with the PRF exudate.  
 
Ridge preservation surgical Procedure:  
After administration of the local anesthetic ( LA), full thickness buccal and  lingual flaps will be 
elevated about [ADDRESS_1038515]. Atraumatic tooth extraction will be performed 
using peizosurgery, periotomes and/or elevators with root sectioning on multi -rooted teeth. The 
socket will be curreted , then copi[INVESTIGATOR_758446]. The extraction sockets of the 
test group will be filled up to the crest of the ridge with  3-5 L-PRF Plug s, depending on the size 
of the socket , and condensed with the amalgam condensor . A d-PTFE membrane (Cytoplast ) 
will be laid on the  top of the extraction socket  of test and control group and will be inserted 3-[ADDRESS_1038516]  at 12-week visit. Then surgical guide will be fabricated (Dreve ) utilizing the 
coDiagnostiX™ software in order to plan for the future implant size and location in a prosthetic 
driven manner . The same guide will be used for the bone core sample, with a trephine bur of a 
suitable size.

 Implant placement surgical Procedure:   
Using the implant surgical gu ide a core bone biopsy will be taken from the he aled extraction site. 
Then the i mplant will be placed as recommended by [CONTACT_3455]  (BLT, Strauman n), and 
additional bone grafting will be done if needed. The implant stability quotient (ISQ), and 
insertional torque (IT) will be recorded at the implant placement time to assess the primary 
stability. 
 
Pre- and Post - operative instructions:  
Prophylaxis Antibiotics: Standard of care Amoxicillin [ADDRESS_1038517] is  reported to be allergic to 
Penicillin.   
Analgesic: NSAID will be prescribed as needed. Patient will be instructed to use Chlorhexidine 
0.12% mouth rinse twice a day for five weeks. The patient will be instructed to be refrained from 
brushing or flossing to the surgical site for 10 days. 
 
Histomorphometric assessment:  
The core bone biopsy will be harvested using the surgical implant guide at the time of implant placement. It will be placed in a container with 10% neutral buffered formalin. The sample will be 
sent for light microscopy histologic slides preparation in the lab. The  bone specimens will be de -
mineraliz ed in EDTA for a month and embedded in paraffin wax . Bone sections (~5µm) will be 
obtained using the Leica (RM  2255, Leica, IL) microtome. F or each biopsy specimen, longitudinal 
section will be used for light microscopic examination. Histomorphometric analysis will be 
performed on three fields for each section using specialized software (Bioquant, Nashville, TN).  
Percentages of newly formed bone, residual connective tissue , and any material remnants  will be 
measured based on the averages of the percentages at a magnification of 100X.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_1038518] acquisition : 
CBCT images38, 39 will be acquired by i -CAT FLX Cone Beam 3D system (Imaging Scien ces, 
Hatfield, PA, [LOCATION_003]) at baseline immediately after tooth extraction, and prior to i mplant placement 
at [ADDRESS_1038519] protocol (360° rotation, 300 
frames, 120 kVp, 5 mA, 3.7 sec, 16 x 8 cm FOV, 400 µm voxel size). 
 
CBCT analysis26 
The analysis of the CBCTs will be performed according to the analysis described by [CONTACT_403909]. 
(2013). To perform the CBCT measurements, scans taken immediately after extraction  (CBCT 0), 
will be superimposed on scans taken at [ADDRESS_1038520] extraction  (CBCT 12 ) using InVivo 5.2 
imaging software (Anatomage, San Jose, CA, [LOCATION_003]). For the superimposition of the cross -sectional 
slices, the fixed anatomical landmarks include the palatal  vault in the maxilla, the lower border 
and angle in the mandible, where no changes would occur after extraction. Both data sets would 
be spatially aligned in order to obtain a match. To set a reference, in single -rooted teeth, the most 
api[INVESTIGATOR_758447] (A) of  the extraction socket is defined in the baseline image (CBCT 0), while in the 
multi-rooted teeth point (A) to be the most coronal point on the  interradicular septum, right at the 
center of the extraction socket (Fig 1). Two reference lines are subsequentl y drawn. The vertical 
reference line is drawn in the center of the extraction socket crossing (A)  reference point. The 
horizontal reference line is drawn perpendicular to the vertical line crossing the api[INVESTIGATOR_758448] (Fig 2). 
 
The following measure ments are then  performed  (Fig. 3): 
1. The thickness of the buccal plate (BP) on CBCT0 will be measured at 1, 3 & [ADDRESS_1038521]. 
2. Horizontal ridge width (RW) will be measured at 3 levels : 1,3,[ADDRESS_1038522]  -1mm, 3 mm, and 5 mm  levels; and vertical resorption at the lingual 
and buccal side. 
  (Fig 1) 
 Figure 1. In single -rooted teeth the most api[INVESTIGATOR_758447] (A) of the extraction socket is def ined in the 
baseline image (CBCT 0), while in the multi- rooted teeth  point (A) to be the most coronal  point 
on the septum, right at the center of the extraction socket. 
 (Fig 2) 
Figure 2.  Two reference lines are subsequently drawn. The vertical reference line (the blue 
interrupted line) is drawn in the center of the extraction socket crossing the api[INVESTIGATOR_758448]. 
The horizontal reference line (the red interrupted line) is drawn perpendicular to the vertical line 
crossing the api[INVESTIGATOR_758449].

    (Fig 3) 
Figure 3.  Following measurements are then performed: 
1. The thickness of the buccal bone plate is to be measured at 1, 3 & [ADDRESS_1038523] (PB Width), on baseline image only. 
2. Horizontal ridge width at 3 levels (crest -1 mm (RW -1 mm), crest -3 mm (RW -3 mm) & 
crest -5 mm (RW -5 mm)) below the most coronal point of the buccal crest, in millimeter.  
3. Vertical resorption on bo th the buccal and palatal side,  in millimeter.  
4. Socket fill as being the highest point of viewable mine ralized bone. Percentages of socket 
fill will be measured by [CONTACT_758459] 12  
weeks of healing.  
Adverse Effects : 
If patients experience pain that cannot be managed by [CONTACT_758460], they will be to ld 
to contact [CONTACT_458] [CONTACT_20687] -up.  
The membrane will be  left on the extraction socket for 4 weeks, if there is no sign of infection, 
otherwise any infection will be treated which may necessitate the removal of membrane. 
Subjects will be monitored for other adverse reactions throughout the study. All adverse events 
will be managed and documented by [CONTACT_673183] .

WHY ARE YOU BEING INVITED  TO TAKE PART IN THIS RESEARCH?  
 
You are being  invited  to take part in a research study about  post tooth  extraction  ridge preservation with 
platelet  rich fibrin.  You are being  invited  to take part in this research  study  because  you need  to have  a 
non-restorable tooth that is  planned  for extraction  and delayed implant placement.   If you volunteer to 
take part in this study,  you will be one of about  forty people at the University  of Kentucky  College  of 
Dentistry  to do so. 
 
WHO IS DOING THE STUDY?  
 
The person  in charge  of this study  is Mhdfiras  Al Yafi DDS,  resident  at the University  of Kentucky,  
Department of Periodontics.  He is being  guided  in this research  by [CONTACT_758461]-Sabbagh DDS MS, 
Periodontics  Division  Chief.  There may be other  people on the research team  assisting  at different  
times  during  the study.  
 
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY?  
 
The focus  of this research  is to see how much  the use of Leukocyte- Platelet  Rich Fibrin  Plug in the 
ridge preservation procedure following  a tooth extraction  will improve  the quality  of the newly  formed  
bone in the extraction  socket.  By [CONTACT_96399], we hope  to find the best way to prevent the bone  loss after 
tooth extraction.  
 
 
ARE THERE REASONS  WHY YOU SHOULD  NOT TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?  
 
If you are a heavy smoker  (more  than 10 cigarettes  a day), have a history  of malignancy,  
chemotherapy, radiation  therapy,  immunosuppressive disease,  uncontrolled  systemic  disease, or any 
contraindications  to surgical  procedures, you should  not participate in the study.  Also,  females  who are

Page 2 of 35Version Date: 5/14/2019NIH Definition of a Clinical Trial: 
A research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one 
or more interventions. An "intervention" is defined as a manipulation of the subject or 
subject’s environment for the purpose of modifying one or more health-related 
biomedical or behavioral processes and/or endpoints. Examples include: drugs/small 
molecules/compounds; biologics; devices; procedures (e.g., surgical techniques); delivery 
systems (e.g., telemedicine, face-to-face interviews); strategies to change health-related 
behavior (e.g., diet, cognitive therapy, exercise, development of new habits); treatment 
strategies; prevention strategies; and, diagnostic strategies (which may include placebo or 
other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on  health-related biomedical 
or behavioral outcomes. 
Use the following four questions to determine the difference between a clinical study 
and a clinical trial:       
1) Does the study involve human participants?  Yes    No
2) Are the participants prospectively assigned to an intervention?  Yes    No
3) Is the study designed to evaluate the effect of the intervention on the participants? 
 Yes    No 
4)  Is the effect being evaluated a health-related biomedical or behavioral outcome? 
 Yes    No
Note that if the answers to the 4 questions are yes, your study meets the NIH definition of 
a clinical trial, even if… 
You are studying healthy participants
Your study does not have a comparison group (e.g., placebo or control)
Your study is only designed to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety, and/or 
maximum tolerated dose of an investigational drug
Your study is utilizing a behavioral intervention
If yes to all 4 questions, please confirm that the research team is familiar with and agrees 
to comply with the investigator requirement to register the study on the ClinicalTrials.gov 
database. Additionally, the approved consent document(s) must be uploaded to the 
ClinicalTrials.gov database     Yes    No

2. Background
Kidney transplantation (KT) is the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage 
kidney disease (ESKD). Although KT reduces cardiovascular events, cardiac death rates 
in KT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_506505] [ADDRESS_653492] year after KT, and especially an increase in fat mass, is a very 
common contributor to elevated cardiometabolic risk. In addition, low levels of physical 
activity and reduced physical functioning are common after KT, associated with a 
reduced quality of life (QOL)25 and poor sleep quality.26 Lifestyle modification (dietary 
changes and exercise) has been the mainstay for initial management of diabetes and 
cardiovascular disease for decades in the general population. Because of the presence of 
both traditional and transplantation-specific risk factors for cardiovascular events and 
diabetes after transplantation,27-[ADDRESS_653493]-transplant lifestyle modification specifically for the KT population.30 
Although an approach specifically tailored to KT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_506506],31,32 Takahashi’s33 seminal review of physical activity in the KT population 
noted that previous programs had limited testing (e.g., small sample sizes; brief follow-

(IMPACT)
Page 6 of 35Version Date: 5/14/2019up),17,33-[ADDRESS_653494] intervention studies are targeted at 
White (WH) or African American (AA) patients, with lowest representation of American 
Indian (AI) or Hispanic/Latina(o) (HL) populations; overall, only 10% of interventions 
were culturally appropriate to the target population. 
In Improving Healthcare Outcomes in American Indian and Hispanic Transplant 
Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_506503]-Tailored Novel Technology (IMPACT), we will pi[INVESTIGATOR_506507] a culturally-tailored, multi-behavior lifestyle intervention 
using a novel technology for 14-20 AI, HL, and White KT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Because of KT 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]’ varied stability immediately post-transplant, and the need to individually 
monitor their post-transplant immunosuppression regimen,1,23,24,[ADDRESS_653495]/exercise physiologist and a registered dietitian nutritionist, who will work 
closely with the post-transplant team to carefully monitor patient stability. IMPACT will 
combine a personalized assessment of the patient’s food preferences and access to 
exercise resources within their environment (based on a standard list of factors developed 
by [CONTACT_506546]) along with clinical specifications from the 
transplant team. Our study is innovative because it addresses previous limitations,33,[ADDRESS_653496], and incorporates a rehabilitation 
approach to slowly increasing KT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]’ physical activity40-42 until they can 
engage in exercise at levels consistent with the KDIGO guideline. We argue that in the 
current era of personalized medicine, it would not be appropriate to prescribe one form of 
exercise across all patients. Rather, a tailored approach to physical rehabilitation with the 
end goal of a patient’s ability to meet the KDIGO guidelines (and within their specific 
cultural environment) is optimal for patient health and outcomes. Our intervention is 
innovative because it addresses the limitations identified by [CONTACT_506547]’s33 review of 
physical activity and the Cochrane review of dietary guidelines37 in the KT population, 
while having the capacity to be culturally adapted to meet the needs of the diverse ESKD 
population that exists in the US today.
Another innovation of our approach is to work with the existing resources of the 
core transplant team in any transplant center (namely, the transplant registered 
dietitian) and empower that team member to develop a culturally-tailored diet approach

of post-transplant cardiovascular events. This is an innovative health services research 
approach that will allow our team to determine the cost effectiveness of expanding the 
role of the registered dietitian on the KT team in a subsequent R01 project. Only one 
study of a lifestyle modification intervention targeting diet and exercise with KT 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_506508], but it lacked a randomized controlled trial because it

patients the connection between behavior and health and be particularly amenable to 
making changes in patient health behavior (e.g., in-patients with unhealthy alcohol use, 
diabetes, pediatrics, cancer).44-[ADDRESS_653498] pi[INVESTIGATOR_506510] (Fig. 1).39 Twistle is a HIPAA-compliant patient engagement 
platform designed to perform across all clinical specialties, procedures, and chronic 
conditions. Twistle is used for patient education, reminders, and secure messaging. 
Clinicians and patients can automatically send and receive HIPAA-compliant messages 
including text, emojis, photos, and videos. Twistle has an automation engine that can 
engage, respond and manage conversations, allowing staff and clinicians to take over 
conversations that need extra attention. It can also automatically send alerts and follow-
up messages based on survey responses and triage appropriately based on pre-defined 
rules and on-call schedule. Twistle is designed to integrate with electronic health records, 
registries, databases and predictive analytics tools. It also automatically synchronizes data 
from smart devices, such as blood pressure cuffs, weight scales, CPAP machines, and 
activity trackers.

random allocation scheme by [CONTACT_506549], gender, etc. Within each stratum or block, we 
will accomplish random allocation to IMPACT vs UC with systematic sampling (e.g. 
alternating the assignment of IMPACT and UC with a random start). This scheme will 
result in a nearly equal number of patients in IMPACT and UC within a block. We will 
reduce potential bias using stratified randomization by [CONTACT_506550] a priori. It also reduces bias by [CONTACT_506551]. We can also use 
systematic sampling to reduce sampling variation in comparison with simple random 
sampling. Because of the close interaction between the clinical team and the research 
interventionists, we will not be able to blind the clinical team to group assignment.50,[ADDRESS_653500] in a locked file cabinet drawer in the office of the 
PI’s Office Administrator. Only the sequence numbers (A1 – block A patient #1, A2, A3, 
etc.) will appear on the sealed envelopes and the corresponding group assignment will be 
placed inside the envelope. The research coordinator will open the sealed envelope 
sequentially and inform the consented participant of his or her assigned group. After 
random assignment, the research coordinator will direct participants in the IMPACT 
intervention to the study interventionists (the physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_506511]).
4. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
We plan to recruit participants shortly before or after undergoing KT at the UNM 
HSC Transplant Center. The Transplant Center provides transplant services to all 
New Mexico residents as well as the surrounding Pueblos and the Navajo Nation. 
Reflecting the demographics of the state, only 3% of patients are AA at UNM. Male 
and female KT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379334] 18 and older will be eligible for enrollment.

Team Members
Inclusion criteria:
1. Transplant clinic staff
2. Key administrators involved in the transplant process
5. Number of Subjects
To estimate the number of patients we can expect to recruit for the study, we used 
data from the last five years of KT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_506512]. The center transplants an 
average of [ADDRESS_653501] that 80% will agree to participate in our 
study (n=26), based on previous intervention research with KT patients,13,16,17,34,41,52-54 
and our own work.55-57 Thus, for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], we aim to recruit and retain 14-20 KT 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Virtually all of UNM ESKD patients are (a) HL (44%) or AI (33%), (b) 
income <$25K, (c) on public insurance, (d) high school or lower education; and/or, (e) 
low occupational status. Thus, our patient sample will include members of different 
vulnerable populations that have been underrepresented in past research, and hence 
prepare us to conduct a formal study in a diverse population.
Team members will include up to fifteen people from the following groups: 
transplant clinic staff and key administrators. 
6. Study Timelines
Participant expected duration in the study will be one year, if they complete all study 
visits. Patient recruitment and enrollment will be completed in 12 months of the study 
(Month 4, Year 1 through Month 3, Year 2). Participant follow-up, data analysis, and 
manuscripts are schedule to be completed in Year [ADDRESS_653502] Period: 03/01/2020 – 02/28/2022

7. Study Endpoints
The primary endpoints for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_506513]. To assess intervention acceptability we will measure patients’ satisfaction 
with the interventions with a revised version of the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire;58-60 
where higher satisfaction will indicate greater intervention acceptability, and the System 
Usability Scale (SUS),61 where higher scores indicate ease of usability. We will assess 
questionnaire acceptability using open-ended patient questions. In addition to quantifying 
feasibility using recruitment and retention rates, to provide concrete estimates of the 
expected rates of missing data and participant attrition, we will keep a detailed log of 
relevant factors that could create barriers to subsequent study completion. We will 
measure time spent sedentary (sitting/lying), standing, and steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (and the intensity) 
during awake hours with the activPAL3 accelerometers, and compare these values 
between the IMPACT and UC groups. Time required for study participation will be 
measured using survey completion times as well as intervention session time estimates. 
In addition to the primary endpoints noted above, we will assess the feasibility and 
acceptability of collecting a number of patient outcomes that will be the key target 
outcomes in a large scale R01. A systematic review of [ADDRESS_653504] relevant outcomes to assess in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_506514]: (a) variables 
that we will gather from participants’ medical records (i.e., % weight change, lipid 
profile, and HbA1c); (b) patient reported outcomes, including the PROMIS Sleep Related 
Impairment62 and Sleep Disturbance63 Measures and PROMIS Global Health64; and, (c) 
occupational functioning, using the occupation subscale of the CHART-SF.[ADDRESS_653505] widely used participation measure in rehabilitation research,66 
and has been used in various ethnic groups.67

12.Study Procedures 
Intervention 
Intervention timing: We will minimize participant burden by [CONTACT_506552]’ standard post-transplant clinic visits. We display how the 
intervention time points correspond to the standard clinic schedule in Figure 2. The 
transplant team schedules patients for appointments at the post-transplant clinic 1x/week 
for the first month, then every two weeks for the next two months, then once a month at 
4-[ADDRESS_653509]-KT, at which 
point the exercise intervention can begin. We will take advantage of these frequent in-
person visits to deploy our exercise and diet intervention. Prior to the start of the exercise 
intervention, we will include a “baseline” test. We will measure time spent sedentary 
(sitting/lying), standing, and steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (and the intensity) during awake hours with the 
activPAL3 accelerometers. At the baseline visit for both groups, we will assess self-
reported exercise and physical functioning prior to transplant. Those in usual care will not 
undergo any diet or exercise intervention, but will wear an activity monitor. They will 
only undergo the baseline interview, and a follow-up at [ADDRESS_653510] delayed activPal monitor assessments at any of the 
four timepoints, based on current health status and at the discretion of the PI. 
Exercise intervention: Patient-reported levels of physical activity and objective 
measures of physical fitness indicate lower levels of exercise in ESKD patients awaiting 
KT. After KT, physical activity increases, but it remains lower than in the general 
population.122-[ADDRESS_653511] recent meta-analyses/reviews of physical activity 
post-transplant,33,126,127 our approach combines instructions that are professionally-
assessed with the culturally-tailored assessment of exercise needs (Appendix A), guided 
by a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], and incorporate a rehabilitation approach to slowly increasing KT 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]’ physical activity40-42 with appropriate build-up to more intense physical 
activity until they can engage in KDOQI guideline-based exercise.128  After the initial

(IMPACT)
Page 13 of 35Version Date: 5/14/2019rehabilitation intervention, the latter set of KDOQI guideline-based target activities will 
include movements that can be performed in the home without supervision or the use of 
equipment such as abdominal curls, pushups, running in place, vertical jumps, stretching 
exercises, movement to music, study-provided therapy bands, and some basic yoga 
exercises. Each at-home session will last about 30-minutes, with the goal of engaging 
participants in continuous movement. 
Participants will be asked to wear the activPAL3, an electronic activity monitor, for 
the objective assessment of sedentary activity and physical activity.  The small, thin 
device (like a patch) will be worn on their mid-thigh (day and overnight) for 4-[ADDRESS_653512] general 
movement (sitting, standing, and steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) and will enable us to get a better idea of the 
participant’s daily activity and inactivity levels (versus self-report alone). We will also 
provide participants instructions for applying and removing the monitor. The activPAL3 
monitor will be mailed to the study team after each use. After data collection, participants 
will be given the following instructions: 
Once you have completed using the ActivPAL monitor, please remember to return it to 
our office using the pre-paid mailer we provided. You can drop off the mailer at any 
post office location. Please contact [CONTACT_69759] ([PHONE_10531] if you 
have any questions.
Participants will be given safety instructions (see Exercise Instructions) related to at-
home exercise, in writing and orally, to help support their physical activity after 
transplant. The instructions will also be delivered through Twistle for intervention 
participants.
The study team will follow COVID safe practices as outlined in the related 
attachment. Additionally, if participants are transitioned to remote clinic visits per the 
transplant team and therefore not coming in-person to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_506521], activPal monitors may be mailed. 
(see attached sample letter) 
Dietary intervention: As in most other KT centers, post-transplant usual care in our 
transplant center includes one post-transplant visit with the registered dietitian. Patients 
only see a dietitian again if they return to clinic specifically with a nutritional issue. In 
contrast, KT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_506522]-transplant appointment through six months post-transplant, with follow-up at [ADDRESS_653513]-txp (Figure 2). Based on dietary and nutritional guidelines from KDOQI and 
other national and international sources,128,[ADDRESS_653514] nutrition visit 
(including the culturally-tailored assessment of dietary needs and access, Appendix B) 
occur immediately after transplant because patients are dealing with a lot of information 
and instructions post-transplant and may otherwise lose sight of their dietary needs. Thus, 
recruiting patients and starting the intervention early post-transplant will ensure that they

Hispanic Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_506503]-Tailored Novel Technology 
(IMPACT)
Page 14 of 35Version Date: 5/14/2019perceive the importance of diet and exercise with the same seriousness as 
immunosuppression and other aspects of their post-transplant regimen. The continued 
support they receive from a registered dietitian at the additional follow-up visits will 
support dietary patterns that meet their individualized nutritional needs post-transplant 
while also helpi[INVESTIGATOR_506523]. 
Usual care groups: All participants will continue to receive care according to 
national standards. As required, all patients will have laboratory evaluations 2-3x/per 
week during the first month post-txp with a clinic visit 1-2x/week. Between months 1 and 
3, labs will be drawn weekly or bi-weekly (depending on the stability of the patient), with 
a clinic visit every [ADDRESS_653515] labs drawn every 2 weeks, or 
once a month (depending on the stability of the patient), with a monthly clinic visit. 
Finally, in months 6-12, patients get labs every 1-[ADDRESS_653516] a monthly clinic 
visit. However, none of these lab draws will be used for the research study.
Questionnaires: Questionnaires will be delivered via Twistle or REDcap. See Appendix 
F for Twistle Script listing all comments being used throughout the study that will be 
delivered according to the relevant questionnaire and the timeline in Fig. 2. Brief surveys 
will be conducted over the phone. 
In-Depth Interviews with Participants. We will conduct interviews with participants in 
the IMPACT condition, either in-person, over the phone or via HIPAA compliant Zoom, 
and focus on participants’ experience with the intervention and recommendations for 
improvement (Appendix D). Interviews will be recorded and transcribed for analysis. 
Periodic Survey. Periodically, the Project Coordinator will contact [CONTACT_2085], and 
administrative teams asking to what extent, if any, barriers and/or facilitators to the 
intervention they have observed or experienced and suggestions for change if indicated. 
We will ask the transplant team to elicit feedback on the intervention process and provide 
any feedback to the Project Coordinator. We will elicit impressions of the IMPACT 
intervention and solicit suggestions regarding optimizing the future large-scale study 
(Appendix D). The Project Coordinator also will document all observations and 
experiences in a log (Appendix E), noting the date and source of the observation. We will 
review the log during research team standing meetings, and identify need for process 
changes. We will then communicate the problems identified and planned changes to the 
research, clinical and administrative teams. We will capture this data in REDCap, either 
over the phone or via direct link, whichever is more convenient for the team member. 
Interviews conducted over the phone will be recorded and transcribed.
Types of data
In addition to the in-depth interviews and brief/periodic surveys, we will collect data 
using questionnaires and from medical records. We selected the measures (see Appendix 
C for all measures) for data collection because they (a) are widely used in organ donation

13.Data Analysis
Intervention Evaluation
We will evaluate the process of implementing the IMPACT intervention using a mixed-
methods approach consistent with a Type I Hybrid Intervention/Implementation 
design.130 Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR)[ADDRESS_653517]. This 
evaluation will be comprised of a periodic survey of research, clinical, and administrative 
staff regarding barriers and facilitators of implementation and in-depth interviews with 
participants regarding experiences with the interventions.
Quantitative Analysis Plan
Primary and ancillary analysis: We will describe our patient sample with detailed 
descriptive statistics with respect to demographics and health-related characteristics. We 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Improving Healthcare Outcomes in American Indian and 
Hispanic Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_506503]-Tailored Novel Technology 
(IMPACT)
Page 16 of 35Version Date: 5/14/2019will record and summarize missing data points during the study, attrition and its 
underlying reasons when feasible.  Our primary analysis will focus on measures of 
feasibility and acceptability as outlined in Aim 1: Examine IMPACT’s acceptability and 
feasibility in an ethnically diverse KT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_506524]. We will use these analyses to 
determine endpoints, their variation, plausible intervention effect size, sample size, 
planned analyses, and accrual expectations. These analyses will guide the design of the 
subsequent study.132 We will also use these analyses, as well as those of Aim 2 to 
determine a clear rationale to support the next steps in the study process, including “go 
versus no go” decisions.132
Outcomes: Whereas our primary objective is to establish the feasibility and 
acceptability of the study intervention, we will also compare the intervention group to the 
UC group with respect to the type, frequency, and intensity of exercise, as well as diet 
structure using common statistical methods, we will also compare activity tracking data 
from both groups. For example, our analysis will answer the question: what is the 
plausible range of difference in the proportion of participants engaging in the 
recommended diet and exercise routine? What is the difference in the amount of activity 
between the two groups? Given the small sample size of this study, we do not expect 
such differences will be necessarily statistically significant, but such differences will 
inform our planned large scale R01. In our future large-scale study, we will hypothesize 
that IMPACT will result in improved exercise and diet and will lead to improvements in 
post-transplant health and quality of life. When feasible we will also estimate the range of 
plausible improvements in post-transplant health and quality of life. 
Intervention Evaluation Analysis Plan 
Survey Data: We will quantitatively analyze the survey data, categorizing comments 
as to which of the four major CFIR constructs (Intervention, Outer Setting, Inner Setting, 
Characteristics of Individuals, Process) they refer to and assessing counts and frequencies 
of comments found in each construct. Sub-analyses will include assessing responses in 
relation to respondent’s role.
Participant Interviews: The core research team will review all of the interview 
transcripts to develop an annotated provisional codebook, using qualitative analysis 
software (Dedoose)133 to support this analyses. Analysis of subsequent interviews will 
proceed iteratively as follows: two primary coders will apply existing codes and will add 
new codes to the codebook as needed. We will resolve disagreement in coding through 
consensus, and we will assess inter-rater agreement between coders will be assessed.[ADDRESS_653518] line coding to identify key concepts, including confirmation of 
existing knowledge and identification of novel themes.
Surveys with clinical team and administrators: We will create a provisional 
codebook with the barriers and facilitators we identified in the brief surveys with key 
stakeholders. We will pay particular attention to themes that deal with overall ease of use 
of the intervention and overall satisfaction with implementation.

the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-Investigators with expertise in kidney 
transplantation, clinical trials, disparities, and biostatistics, plus one independent 
reviewer (IR), who has no financial, scientific, or other conflict of interest with the 
study.  Written documentation for the IR attesting to absence of conflict of interest 
will be required. The study team will present the IR with the study protocol, informed 
consents, and reports to assess study safety and progress. In addition, the co-
investigators will explain plans for participant recruitment, accrual and retention, 
participant risk versus benefit, performance of the trial sites, confidentiality of patient 
data, monitoring of study progress and assessment of other factors that can affect 
study outcome during the DSMB meeting. 
The IR will review all data captured for the study including unanticipated events. This 
will allow the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_506525]. 
The IR will have the authority to recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_506526]. The DSMB will review the progress of the study

15.Withdrawal of Subjects
Subjects are free to withdraw from study participation at any time during this clinical 
study. The Investigator may withdraw a subject if continued participation is not in the 
interest of the subject’s health and welfare, for noncompliance with protocol-
specified procedures, or because of a protocol violation.  This will be evaluated on a 
case-by-case basis by [CONTACT_737]. All data collected from a withdrawn 
participant will be destroyed if the participant withdraws from the study at any point.
The primary reason for discontinuation or withdrawal will be documented as one of the

and databases. REDCap is supported at the University of New Mexico, and will be 
used to capture data from the study and to temporarily store the resulting research 
data. Data will be exported from REDCap and imported into SAS for data analysis. 
The statistical team will work closely with the investigative team and other study 
personnel to ensure that protocols are being followed, data integrity and 
confidentiality are maintained, and that the degree of missing data is minimized. All 
study files residing in designated network folders will be backed-up daily and 
archived weekly. The weekly data will be stored on a separate server that is 
physically located > [ADDRESS_653520] staff to review any changes in

18.Risks to Subjects
This trial is voluntary and those undergoing KT who do not wish to participate will 
have access to usual care. We will obtain consent via a formal signed consent form. 
Patients will be provided adequate time to weigh enrolling in the trial. 
The assessors and interventionists will be sure to interview patients in a respectful 
manner, and will have enough knowledge to be able to explain what steps would be 
taken to ensure patient confidentiality. For some patients, discussing the intervention 
and their adherence to it, may be upsetting. Any patients requesting additional 
counseling will be provided with contact [CONTACT_506555]: Improving Healthcare Outcomes in American Indian and

participation at any time or taking a break if the interview length feels too 
burdensome. Results from our current work indicate that the interview should be 
completed in approximately [ADDRESS_653521].
Clinical team and administrators’ surveys will remain anonymous. Informed consent 
will be obtained from all participating staff before the start of the first survey via 
consent letter. Data from these surveys will also be kept confidential.  
The study team will follow COVID safe practices as outlined in the related 
attachment.
19.Potential Benefits to Subjects
Benefits include: reducing the likelihood of weight gain, diabetes, and cardiovascular 
events post-transplant. Participation in the study will address the limitations of 
previous physical activity and dietary interventions in KT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]: (1) small sample 
size, (2) short patient follow-up, and (3) limited population diversity. Finally, 
participants will benefit from knowing that they will be helpi[INVESTIGATOR_506529], which gives them a way to tailor the intervention to the needs of their 
specific patient population and maintain regular interaction and follow-up.
20.Recruitment Methods
Flyers will be placed and brochures in the UNM HSC Transplant Center. In 
addition, potential participants will be approached shortly before or after 
undergoing KT, as they are in recovery, at the UNM HSC Transplant Center. 
All participants will continue to receive care according to national standards 
whether or not they participate in the study. All participants who are 
randomized to the IMPACT intervention will have in-depth interviews. All 
IMPACT intervention study staff, transplant clinic staff and key 
administrators involved in the transplant process will be recruited for post-
intervention surveys at the time of study initiation.

33.Drugs or Devices
NA - this research does not evaluate the safety or effectiveness of a medical device
The activPAL3 activity monitoring device (worn on the thigh):
a. This is not a device study, i.e., this study does not evaluate the efficacy or safety of 
a device. There is no information on the FDA website regarding the activPAL3 
monitor (NOTE: these monitors are from a company in Scotland, [LOCATION_006]). However, 
these monitors are similar to the ActiGraph monitors except for the attachment 
method. The activPAL3 monitors are not investigational devices as they are 
commercially available (http://www.paltechnologies.com/); the shipment of 
activPAL3 monitors was cleared by [CONTACT_123895]. These 
monitors are the gold standard for objectively measuring sedentary behavior and 
ambulation in research study participants and have been used in many trials in the 
U.S. The activPAL3 monitors are more expensive than consumer wearable 
monitors (e.g., FitBit, Jawbone) and require special software to analyze the data, 
thus these monitors are used in research rather than being purchased by [CONTACT_123896]. 
In this study, the monitors are used to measure outcomes (frequency, duration, and 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Improving Healthcare Outcomes in American Indian and 
Hispanic Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_506503]-Tailored Novel Technology 
(IMPACT)
Page 22 of 35Version Date: 5/14/2019intensity of free-living sedentary behavior and light physical activity), and are not 
used to diagnosis or treat disease, or to support/sustain life.
b. These monitors do not present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or 
welfare of the subject. There is a potential for a small risk of skin irritation due to 
the adhesive used to attach the activPAL3 to the thigh. We are minimizing this risk 
by [CONTACT_123897], to remove the monitor and contact [CONTACT_464].
To our knowledge, the FDA has not evaluated this device; however, it would likely fall 
under the same category as a similar research grade activity monitor, ActiGraph (not used 
in this study). We believe, that like the ActiGraph monitors, the activPAL3 monitors used 
in this study poses non-significant risk per the FDA definition: i) it is not an implanted 
device, ii) it is not a life sustaining/ supporting device, iii) it is not “for a use of substantial 
importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing 
impairment of human health”, and iv) it does not otherwise present “a potential for serious 
risk to the health safety, or welfare of a subject”. 
34.Principal Investigator’s Assurance
By [CONTACT_123898], the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_123858]:
☒ The information supplied in this form and attachments are complete and correct.  
☒ The PI [INVESTIGATOR_123859]’s Manual and will conduct this research in accordance 
with these requirements. 
 ☒ Data will be collected, maintained and archived or destroyed per HSC Data Security 
Best Practices, including:
1.Best Practice for data collection is for it to be directly entered onto a data 
collection form that is in a secured access folder on an HS drive behind a firewall, 
or in a secure UNM Data Security approved system such as RedCap.
2. Data collection of de-identified data, if done in a clinical setting or other setting 
that does not allow direct entry into a secured system, may be done temporarily 
using a personal or university owned electronic storage device or hard copy 
document. The important security safeguard is that no identifiers be include if 
the data is entered or stored using an untrusted device or storage.
3.Permanent (during data analysis, after study closure) storage must reside on 
HSC central IT managed storage. Processing of data (aggregation, etc.) are to be 
carried out in such a way as to avoid creating/retaining files on untrusted storage 
devices/computers. Trusted devices are HSC managed and provide one or more 
of following safeguards: access logs, encryption keys, backups, business 
continuity and disaster recovery capabilities.

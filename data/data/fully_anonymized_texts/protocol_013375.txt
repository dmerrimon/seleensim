1. Primary objective:
1.1. To 
assess the activity of ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_84482]-
resistant/refractory epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] (non-mucinous) ovarian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], or 
primary peritoneal cancer. We will assess this by [CONTACT_84541][INVESTIGATOR_54575] 
+bevacizumab (experimental) arm to the ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_54575]-alone (control) arm for an 
improvement in median progression free survival (PFS).
2. Secondary objectives:
2.1. To 
compare the experimental arm to the control arm for increases in objective 
response rate (ORR) and durable disease control rate (DDCR).
2.2.
To compare the experimental arm to the control arm for an increase in overall 
survival (OS).
2.3. To 
assess the safety profile of ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_84483], fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916],
 or primary peritoneal cancer patients.
2.4. To assess whether prior treatment with bevacizumab impacts future response to 
bevacizumab in combination with ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_54575].
3.
Exploratory/correlative objectives:
3.1. To 
characterize number, length and composition (e.g., class III β-tubulin  
expression) of 
microtentacles (McTNs) isolated from circulating tumor cells 
isolated from whole blood of patients undergoing treatment with ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_84484], and correlate with best response, PFS, and OS.
3.2. To observe McTNs on circulating tumor cells in blood using a novel 
polyelectrolyte multi-layer (PEM) tethering technology.
3.3.
To correlate ex vivo  response of McTNs to drug treatment with clinical response 
in order to develop a real-time assay to predict response to therapy. 
3.4. To explore use of circulating tumor (ct) DNA as a biomarker for disease 
response and compare its performance to CA-125.
3.5.
To examine whether clinical response to ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_84485] β-tubulin.

Version date: 02.03.202162.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
2.1 Clinical Objectives  
In the [LOCATION_002], ovarian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], or primary peritoneal cancer represents the leading cause 
of death 
from gynecologic malignancy. In 2016, there will be a projected 22,290 new cases and 14,240 
resultant deaths in the [LOCATION_002] alone.1 Due in part to a lack of adequate screening tests and non-
specific symptoms, >65% of ovarian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], or primary peritoneal cancers are diagnosed at an 
advanced stage (III or IV).[ADDRESS_92156]-line 
adjuvant therapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel is as high as 77-90%,3,[ADDRESS_92157] platinum and diagnosis of recurrence. Tumors are considered platinum sensitive 
if they recur ≥ [ADDRESS_92158] platinum exposure, platinum-resistant if they recur  < [ADDRESS_92159] platinum exposure, and platinum-refractory if they progress during platinum therapy.6  Response 
rates to re-treatment with platinum after no treatment for two years can be as high as 70%,7 compared 
to a rate of 10-40% in platinum-resistant population.8 Use of non-platinum therapy in the latter 
produces objective response rates of 10-35% and disease stabilization in an additional 35-50%.[ADDRESS_92160] vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), to standard cytotoxic 
chemotherapy statistically improves overall response rate (ORR) and progression-free (PFS) in 
platinum-resistant disease. In this phase III study, 361 patients were randomized to receive intravenous 
cytotoxic chemotherapy (weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28-day cycle, pegylated 
liposomal doxorubicin 40 mg/m2 every 4 weeks, topotecan 4 mg/m2 days 1, 8, 15 of a 21-day cycle or 
1.25 mg/m2 days 1-5 of a 21-day cycle) with or without bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 15 
mg/kg every 3 weeks). Median PFS was 6.7 versus 3.4 months among patients who did and did not 
receive bevacizumab, respectively (p<0.001, HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.32-0.53). ORR was 27.3% versus 
11.8% (p=0.001). Median OS did not differ between groups: 16.6 versus 13.3 months (p=0.174, HR 
0.85, 95% CI 0.66-1.08). Weekly paclitaxel may be synergistic with bevacizumab, as paclitaxel 
treatment has been shown to induce VEGF expression in vitro through the production of reactive 
oxygen species.[ADDRESS_92161] (PFS 10.4 versus 3.9 months).11 
At present, bevacizumab is currently approved for use in platinum-resistant recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_12248], fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_84486], or primary peritoneal cancer in combination with chemotherapy. In phase II 
studies by [CONTACT_84542] (GOG 170D), clinical response rate of bevacizumab 
monotherapy in recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_84487] 21% (15% complete, 85% 
partial), with a median PFS and OS of 4.7 and 17 months respectively.12 Treatment in the primary 
setting has not gained approval, though bevacizumab has been well-studied in two large phase III

randomized after 
cytoreduction to adjuvant therapy in one of the three arms: control (carboplatin area 
under the concentration [AUC] 6 plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 plus placebo), control with bevacizumab 
15 mg/kg, or control with bevacizumab followed by [CONTACT_84543].13 Bevacizumab 
maintenance therapy resulted in an improved PFS (median PFS 14.1 months vs 10.3 months without 
bevacizumab, HR 0.717, 95% CI 0.625–0.824, P=0.001), but there was no difference in overall 
survival. In ICON7, 1528 women stage I–IIA high-grade or clear cell ovarian carcinoma or IIB–IV 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_76296], primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_84488]-
line adjuvant therapy with carboplatin (AUC 5 or 6) plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for six 
cycles or this regimen plus bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg given concurrently, some of whom received 12 
cycles of bevacizumab maintenance.14 PFS was higher with bevacizumab therapy (median PFS 19.8 
months vs 17.4 months, HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77–0.99, P=0.04), without effect on overall survival.  It 
is currently unknown whether prior treatment with bevacizumab alters response to re-treatment. 
Retrospective studies in recurrent ovarian cancer have suggested  improved progression-free survival 
in bevacizumab-naïve patients who receive bevacizumab with chemotherapy relative to those who 
previously received bevacizumab.15 A phase III trial (MITO16MANGO2b) is onging to assess 
whether administering bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy in second-line therapy to 
patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who have received first-line bevacizumab will be more effective 
than chemotherapy alone ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]),16 which has been shown for colorectal carcinoma (HR 
0.81, p = 0.0062).[ADDRESS_92162] shown previously that upregulation of class 
III β-tubulin is linked to paclitaxel resistance and poor survival (Figure 1) in a variety of aggressive

Epothilones such as ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_54575] (Ixempra,® R-Pharm US, Inc., Princeton, NJ) are microtubule-
stabilizing agents isolated from the myxobacterium Sorangium cellulosum that are structurally distinct 
from paclitaxel. Putatively, these agents overcome paclitaxel resistance conferred by [CONTACT_84544] β-tubulin through equal binding affinity for both class I and class III isoforms.[ADDRESS_92163] cancers (1) in combination with capecitabine in anthracycline and taxane-

Ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_84489]-studied for gynecologic indications, but has a number of promising 
applications. In a phase II study of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer by [CONTACT_84545] (GOG 126M),31 weekly ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_84490] 20 mg/m2 over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 
15 of a 28-day cycle produced an objective response rate of 14.3% with 3 complete and 4 partial 
responses and disease stabilization in 40.8%; median progression-free and overall survival was 4.[ADDRESS_92164] 30% of ovarian cancer cells;[ADDRESS_92165] previously published our clinical retrospective experience with this

McTNs may be critically linked to metastasis by [CONTACT_84548]-floating tumor cells as 
well as adherence to endothelial cells. Very recently, a novel platform consisting of polyelectrolyte 
multi-layer (PEM) films has been developed through the laboratory of Christopher Jewell in the 
Department of Bioengineering at the University of Maryland to allow the three-dimensional study of 
free-floating tumor cells47 such as those found in ascites or blood, in near-native form. The PEM 
platform eliminates blurring during confocal microscopy to permit dynamic measurements of McTNs 
over time (Figure 3). This technology would also allow for rapid testing of the effects of drugs on 
McTNs in as little as a few hours. 
One translational component of this study will focus upon the ability to isolate circulating tumor cells 
from whole blood of patients undergoing treatment with ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_84494], 
and explore the possibility to use the patent-pending PEM tethering technology to characterize 
McTNs. McTN composition (e.g., class III β-tubulin expression), number, and length will be 
correlated with best response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. We will associate the ex 
vivo responses of McTNs to drug treatment with observed clinical response in order to develop a 
meaningful real-time assay to  predict response to 
this therapy.

8. Any hypersensitivity to Cremophor® EL or polyoxyethylated castor oil.
9. CTCAE grade 2 or higher peripheral  neuropathy. 
3.3      Inclusion of Minorities/Rare Tumor Types:
1. As 
men do not have uteri, only women will be enrolled in this trial. Participating 
institutions will 
not exclude potential subjects from participating in this or any study 
solely on the basis of ethnic origin or socioeconomic status.  Every attempt will be 
made to enter all eligible patients into this protocol and therefore address the study 
objectives in a patient population representative of the entire platinum-
resistant/refractory recurrent/persistent ovarian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], or primary peritoneal 
cancer population treated by [CONTACT_69146].
2. The expected frequency of histologies is serous (80-85%), endometrioid (<10%), clear 
cell (<5%),
 carcinosarcoma (<7%), or transitional cell/malignant Brenner (<0.5%), 
mixed, or undifferentiated histologies. Increasingly, mucinous disease is felt to 
represent a separate entity, and is therefore not included in this study.64,65,66

7.3.1 Rescue Medication
[IP_ADDRESS] Ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_84505]. There is no specific antidote for over dosage with ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_54575]. The adverse reactions reported   in   these   cases   included   peripheral   neuropathy,  fatigue,   musculoskeletal  pain/myalgia, and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, anorexia, diarrhea, abdominal pain, stomatitis). The highest dose mistakenly received was 100 mg/m
2 (total dose 185 mg). Potential adverse events 
should be treated symptomatically. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Bevacizumab
Rescue medications to reverse the actions of bevacizumab are not currently available. The

7.3.3 Concomitant Treatment(s)
Concomitant medications or therapy to provide adequate supportive care may be given as 
clinically necessary. 
After study enrollment, palliative radiotherapy may be given for bone pain or for other reasons 
(e.g. bronchial obstruction, skin lesions), provided that the total dose delivered is in a palliative 
range according to institutional standards. The irradiated area cannot be used for tumor 
response assessment. During palliative radiotherapy, study treatment should be delayed and 
may be resumed once the patient has recovered from any radiation associated toxicity. If 
medication is interrupted for more than 14 days, the decision to continue will be made by [CONTACT_1268]/Sponsor in agreement with the Sub-Site Principal Investigator. 
Continuous interruption of >28 days due to palliative radiotherapy will not be allowed.
All concomitant therapy, including anaesthetic agents, vitamins, homeopathic/herbal remedies, 
nutritional supplements, must be recorded in the case report form (CRF) during the screening 
and treatment period, starting from the date of signature [CONTACT_43998], and ending at 
the end of treatment (EOT) visit. After the EOT visit, only concomitant therapy indicated for 
treatment of an adverse event has to be reported. 
In case of emergent surgery, it is recommended to restart treatment after complete wound 
healing. If 
therapy is interrupted for more than 14 days, the decision to continue will be made 
by [CONTACT_079]/Sponsor in agreement with the Sub-Site Principal Investigator.
7.[ADDRESS_92195] signs of symptoms. Suggested treatments for 
adverse events are described below.
7.4.1 Gastrointestinal
[IP_ADDRESS] It is anticipated that nausea and vomiting may be a side effect of chemotherapy. The following 
representative antiemetic 
regimens are suggested: ondansetron 8-32 mg IV 30 minutes prior to 
administration of chemotherapy and dexamethasone 10-20 mg IV 30 minutes prior to drug 
administration, or granisetron 10 mcg/kg IV (or 2 mg PO) 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy, 
with or without lorazepam 0.5-2.0 mg IV 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy or palonosetron 
0.25 mg IV 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy.

nausea/ vomiting. Grade 4 gastrointestinal toxicity will require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69093]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] If any mucositis is present on day 28 of a cycle, treatment should be withheld until the 
mucositis has 
returned to Grade 1. Grade 3 or 4 mucositis or diarrhea requires a dose reduction 
of ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_54575].
[IP_ADDRESS] Bilirubin must be within normal limits prior therapy.
7.4.2 Hematologic
[IP_ADDRESS]
Initial treatment modifications  will consist of cycle delay and/or dose reduction as indicated in 
Section 7.1. The use of hematopoietic cytokines and protective reagents are restricted as 
follows
- patients will NOT receive prophylactic growth factors  [filgrastim (GCSF), sargramostim 
(GM-CSF), pegfilgrastim (Neulasta)] unless they experience recurrent neutropenic 
complications after treatment modifications
 specified above
- patients will NOT receive prophylactic thrombopoietic agents
- patients may receive erythropoietin for management of anemia AFTER documentation of 
hemoglobin less than 10 g/dl (CTCAE
 v4.0 grade 2)
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment decisions will be based on the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) rather than the total 
white cell count (WBC).
[IP_ADDRESS] Subsequent cycles of therapy will not begin until the ANC is ≥1500 cells/microliter (CTCAE 
v4.0 grade 1) and the platelet count is ≥ 100,000/microliter. Therapy will be delayed for a 
maximum of two weeks until these values are achieved. Patients who fail to recover adequate 
counts within a two week delay will be removed from study therapy.
[IP_ADDRESS] For first occurrence of febrile neutropenia, and/or documented grade 4 neutropenia persisting 
>7 days, reduce ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_84506].
[IP_ADDRESS] For recurrent febrile neutropenia, and/or recurrent documented grade 4 neutropenia persisting 
≥7 days (after initial dose reduction), add prophylactic growth factors. In this circumstance, it 
is recommended that G-CSF at a dose of 5 microgram/kg/day* (or equivalent dosing of 
pegfilgrastim or sargramostim) will be administered subcutaneously starting the day after the 
last dose of chemotherapy (normally day 2-4) and continuing through hematopoietic recovery. 
Growth factors should not be used within 72 hours of a subsequent dose of chemotherapy.

Version date: 02.03.202121Grade 1.  The protocol regimen will be discontinued in patients with recurrent Grade [ADDRESS_92196]. 
7.4.5 Cardiovascular
[IP_ADDRESS] Asymptomatic bradycardia is not an indication for discontinuation of therapy, however, 
infusion should be discontinued for chest pain, clinically significant arrhythmia, hypotension, 
or serious allergic reaction. Any arrhythmia that is felt to necessitate discontinuation of therapy 
should be discussed with the Study Chair as soon as possible.
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment, surveillance, and management of blood pressure is required in patients receiving 
vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway inhibitors. For patients who develop 
hypertension while receiving treatment with an antiangiogenic agent, treatment with 
angiotensin system inhibitors (e.g., angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs], 
angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) may be preferred over other agents. 
Treating investigators should  refer to guidelines established for use of antiangiogenic agents:[ADDRESS_92197] several weeks of therapy
- 
manage blood pressure during therapy with an ideal goal of <130/[ADDRESS_92198] patients, 
lower in 
those with specific preexisting cardiovascular risk factors, such as diabetes or chronic 
kidney disease
- patients who develop hypertension during treatment (defined as blood pressure ≥140 mm 
Hg/90 mmHg or a 20 mm increase in diastolic blood pressure over baseline) should be treated 
with antihypertensives
7.4.6 Hypersensitivity Reaction
[IP_ADDRESS] If 
hypersensitivity reactions to ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_84507] (Cremaphor) occur, it will usually be 
during the
 first few minutes of infusion. Appropriate symptomatic therapy should be given. 
Continued treatment may be considered if the reaction is not life-threatening; however, patients 
must be cautioned about potential recurrences of the reaction.  Should the patient decide to 
continue with treatment it is preferable that this be done on the same day of the occurrence. 
Patients will follow the institutional protocol for desensitization. A suggested procedure would 
be to administer the drug first with 1 ml of the original IV solution diluted in 100 ml over one 
hour, then 5 ml in 100 ml over one hour, then 10 ml in 100 ml over one hour, and finally, the 
original solution at the original speed.

7.4.7 Musculoskeletal
In the several days following ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_84508] (myalgia/arthralgia) may be severe, and 
should receive aggressive symptomatic treatment, including narcotics or steroids as required.  
They are not, however, an indication for dose reduction.
7.5 Restrictions
7.5.1 Concomitant Treatment
Concomitant medications, or therapy to provide adequate supportive care, may be given as 
clinically necessary. Additional experimental anti-cancer treatment and/or standard chemo-, 
immunotherapy, hormone treatment (with the exception of megestrol acetate)), or radiotherapy 
(other than palliative radiotherapy for symptom control) is not allowed concomitantly with the 
administration of study treatment. 
7.5.2 Diet and Lifestyle
Patients should be  advised to avoid any foods known to aggravate diarrhea/constipation. To 
prevent skin-related adverse events it is recommended to avoid intense irradiation with UV 
light and harsh detergents.
7.5.3 Women of Child-Bearing Potential and Pregnancy Prevention
Patients 
who are not of childbearing potential due to being postmenopausal ([ADDRESS_92199] 2 years without menstruation following chemotherapy) or surgical 
sterilisation (oophorectomy, hysterectomy and/or tubal ligation) do not need to use 
contraception to be eligible for the trial. All other patients are considered to have childbearing 
potential and must use adequate contraception throughout the trial (from screening until end 
of trial participation).
Acceptable methods of contraception include surgical sterilization and double barrier method, 
and must be in accordance with local regulations where applicable. Double barrier method of 
contraception is defined as two barrier methods used simultaneously each time the patient has 
intercourse. Accepted barrier methods include diaphragm, female condom, cervical cap, male 
condom and intrauterine device (UID) (the diaphragm and cervical cap must be used in 
conjunction with spermicidal jelly/cream). Those using hormonal contraceptives, or with 
partners using hormonal contraceptives, must also be using an additional approved method of 
contraception (as described above).  Partner vasectomy, natural "rhythm," and spermicidal 
jelly/cream are not acceptable methods of contraception.
Women who become pregnant while participating in the study must discontinue study 
medication immediately.  The pregnancy must be reported following procedures detailed in 
section 11.10.2.

11.1     Personnel Responsible for the Safety Review  and Its Frequency
The Principal Investigator/Sponsor  will be responsible for monitoring the data, assuring 
protocol compliance, and conducting the safety reviews at the specified frequency, which must 
be conducted at a minimum of once every 6 months (including when re-approval of the 
protocol is sought).  During the review process, the Principal Investigator/Sponsor with the 
help of the Remote Monitoring Coordinator will evaluate whether the study should continue 
unchanged, require modification/amendment, or close to enrollment. The Principal 
Investigator/Sponsor and the IRB or the Yale Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC) have the authority to stop or suspend the study or require modifications.
11.2    Risk Assessment
The risks associated with the current study are deemed moderate for the following reasons: 
1. We do not view the risks associated with the combination of ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_84510].
2. Ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_84511]-approved  as monotherapy for metastatic or locally advanced 
breast carcinoma after failure of an anthracycline, taxane, and capecitabine. 
Bevacizumab is FDA-approved in metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer and 
platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian/fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916]/primary peritoneal cancer in 
combination with chemotherapy, therefore we do not view the proposed study as high 
risk.
Although we have  assessed the proposed study as one of moderate risk, the potential exists for 
anticipated and/or unanticipated adverse events, serious or otherwise, to occur since it is not 
possible to predict with certainty the absolute risk in any given individual or in advance of 
first-hand experience with the proposed study methods. Therefore, we provide a plan for 
monitoring the data and safety of the proposed study as outlined below.

Each reported AE or SAE will be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e., start and end dates), regulatory 
seriousness criteria if applicable, suspected relationship to ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_54575], bevacizumab, or the 
combination (see following guidance), and actions taken.
To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, the Principal 
Investigator/Sponsor should apply the following general guidelines:
a.) 
Definite: Adverse event is  clearly related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s). There is 
a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and administration of 
ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_54575], bevacizumab, or the combination, and the AE cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_1560]’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; AND/OR the AE follows 
a known pattern of response to ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_54575], bevacizumab, or the combination and/or the AE 
abates OR resolves upon discontinuation of ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_54575], bevacizumab, or the combination OR 
dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re-challenge.
b.) Probable: Adverse event is likely related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
c.) Possible:
 Adverse event may be related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
d.) 
Unlikely: Adverse event is likely not to be related to the investigational 
procedures(s)/agent(s).
e.) Unrelated: Adverse event is clearly not related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s). 
Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_54575], bevacizumab, or the 
combination (e.g., pre-existing medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or 
concomitant medication); and/or the AE has no plausible temporal relationship to 
administration of ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_54575], bevacizumab, or the combination (e.g., cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_92211] dose of study drug).
Expected adverse events are those adverse events that are listed or characterized in the 
Package Insert or current Investigator Brochure. 
Unexpected adverse events are those not listed in the Package Insert (P.I.) or current 
Investigator Brochure (I.B.) or not identified.  This includes adverse events for which the 
specificity or severity is not consistent with the description in the P.I. or I.B.  For example, 
under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected if the P.I. or I.B. only referred to 
elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Refer to Section 12.0 for further guidelines.
The treating investigator will be responsible for performing this assessment, with oversight of 
the Principal Investigator/Sponsor.

adopted.  Examples of non-directive questions include: 
“How have you felt since your last clinical visit?
“Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?” 
11.[ADDRESS_92213] medical terminology/concepts when reporting AEs or 
SAEs.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.  All information will be recording using 
Oncore Clinical Trials Management System.
a. Diagnosis vs. Signs and Symptoms
If 
known at the time of reporting, a diagnosis should be reported rather than individual signs 
and symptoms 
(e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and 
elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be 
medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, it is ok to 
report the information that is currently available.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it 
should be reported as follow-up information.
b. Deaths
All deaths that occur during the conduct of the research must be reported to the Principal 
Investigator/Sponsor and
 the Remote Monitoring Coordinator immediately (if possible) to 
ensure that all over site committees are properly informed.  All information will be entered 
into Oncore Clinical Trials Management System and updated appropriately.  Further 
determination regarding the need to submit to the subjects local IRB, Yale University HHRP 
following IRB Policy 710 for reporting Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects 
and RPharm US Drug Safety Committee will be reviewed. Specific information is outlined in 
section 12.0 of the protocol. 
When recording a death, the event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome 
should be reported as the single medical concept.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot 
be ascertained at the time of reporting, report “Unexplained Death”.
c. Preexisting Medical Conditions
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  Such conditions 
should be reported as medical and surgical history.
A preexisting medical condition should be re-assessed throughout the trial and reported as an 
AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the 
study.  When reporting such events, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting 
condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., “more frequent headaches”).
d. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84512].
If 
a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9615] a medical or surgical procedure as a result of an AE, the 
event responsible 
for the procedure, not the procedure itself, should be reported as the SAE.

e. Pregnancy
If 
a female subject becomes pregnant while receiving investigational therapy or within [ADDRESS_92214] dose of study drug, a report should be completed and expeditiously 
submitted to R-Pharm US, Inc.. Follow-up by [CONTACT_079]/Sponsor to obtain the 
outcome of the pregnancy should also occur. Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or 
spontaneous, should always be classified as serious, and expeditiously reported as an SAE.  
Similarly, any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female subject exposed to 
ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_54575], bevacizumab, or the combination should be reported as an SAE as outlined in 
section 12.0.
f. Post-Study Adverse Events
The Principal Investigator/Sponsor and Sub-Site Principal Investigators should expeditiously 
report any SAE occurring after a subject has completed or discontinued study participation if 
attributed to prior exposure to ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_54575], bevacizumab, or the combination. If the 
investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or a congenital anomaly in a 
subsequently conceived offspring of a female subject who participated in the study, this should 
be reported as an SAE.
g. Reconciliation  
The Principal
 Investigator/Sponsor is responsible  to monitor successful transmission of SAE 
reports to R-Pharm US, Inc. and the sponsor will conduct reconciliation on an as-needed basis 
to make sure that all SAEs are received and captured in the R-Pharm US, Inc. safety database.

14.0   STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Study Design and Primary Objective: This is a randomized, two-arm, open-label Phase II 
multicenter study. Its design reflects its overarching goal: to examine the effects of adding 
bevacizumab to ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_84521]-resistant/refractory epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] (non-mucinous) ovarian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], or primary 
peritoneal cancer. Its primary objective is to assess whether adding bevacizumab to ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_84522]-free survival  in its target population. Study participants will be stratified 
by (a) study site and (b) previous receipt of bevacizumab prior to randomization. Up to 88 
participants will be randomly assigned at a 1:1 allocation ratio to the control arm (ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_84523]) or experimental arm (ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_54575] +bevacizumab) using a dynamic randomization 
procedure that minimizes stratification-factor imbalance between the treatment arms. Patient 
registration will be accomplished in the usual fashion. 
Secondary objectives:
- To compare the experimental arm to the control arm for increases in objective response rate 
(ORR) and durable disease control rate
 (DDCR).
- To compare the experimental arm to the control arm for an increase in overall survival (OS)
- To
 assess the safety profile of ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_84524]-resistant/refractory
 epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] (non-mucinous) ovarian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], or 
primary peritoneal cancer. 
Exploratory/correlative objectives: 
- To characterize number,  length and composition (e.g., class III β-tubulin  expression) of 
microtentacles (McTNs) isolated from circulating tumor cells isolated from whole blood of 
patients undergoing treatment with ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_84494], and correlate 
with best response, PFS, and OS.
- To observe McTNs on circulating tumor cells in blood using a novel polyelectrolyte multi-
layer (PEM) tethering
 technology.

develop a real-time assay to predict response to therapy.

14.1 Sample-Size Justification and Accrual  Goals
The primary objective of the study is to compare the experimental arm to the control arm for 
evidence of 
an increase in progression-free survival (PFS). We estimate that median PFS on 
the control arm will be approximately 5 months. This estimate is based on the observation of 
a 4.4-month median PFS in GOG 126M, a phase II study of ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_84526]-resistant ovarian and primary peritoneal cancers.37 In addition, and based on our own 
observational data with the addition of bevacizumab to ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_54575]42 along with results from 
the AURELIA trial,9 we propose that the addition of bevacizumab to ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_84527] 
a 2-fold increase (to 10 months) in median PFS (or 50% reduction in hazard of PFS events). 
Treatment arms will be compared for the proposed PFS improvement via one-sided log-rank 
test. We require this test to have at least 80% power at 5% alpha to detect the 2-fold increase 
while allowing for a single interim analysis for efficacy and futility. Calculations conducted in 
East version 6.4 software (Cytel, Inc, Cambridge, MA, [LOCATION_003]) using the null-variance estimator 
along with O’Brien-Fleming spending functions for both alpha and beta indicate that [ADDRESS_92224] with 80.8% overall power at 4.7% overall alpha, thereby [CONTACT_84569]. 
To achieve the required 56 PFS events in a timely manner while allowing for up to 10% 
dropouts among 
recruited subjects, we plan to recruit subjects for 17.6 months at a target 
accrual rate of 5 subjects/month to reach a final recruitment goal of 88 subjects before dropout 
(80 subjects after dropout). If our target accrual rate is met from the beginning, and if the 
control arm has the expected median PFS of 5 months, then the 56th PFS event is projected to 
occur no later than 21.8 months after the study opens. The study’s total duration is thus 
projected to have a maximum of 21.8 months.  
14.2 Analysis Plan in support of the Primary Objective
Progression-free 
survival (PFS), the primary endpoint, will be defined as the length of time 
from randomization to disease recurrence, disease progression, or death for any reason.  
Subjects who are alive and who did not experience disease recurrence or progression by [CONTACT_84570]. The experimental 
arm will be compared to the control arm for improvement in PFS via one-sided log-rank test. 
This test will be conducted once for the interim analysis and once for the final analysis.
14.2.[ADDRESS_92225] occurred among enrolled study subjects. Based on previously stated 
assumptions (section
 14.1), we would project that the 28th PFS event will occur sometime 
between when the 58th and 67th subject has enrolled, or between 11.5 and 13.2 months after the

remain open during this interim analysis. To conduct the interim analysis, the experimental arm will be compared to the control arm via one-sided log-rank test. 
If the test yields a Z-score equal to or more negative than –2.538 (equivalent to a one-
sided P≤0.[ADDRESS_92226] ratio ≤0.383),  then the experimental arm (ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_54575] + 
bevacizumab) will be declared promising enough to warrant closing the study early for efficacy. 
On the other hand, if the test yields a Z-score equal to or more positive than –0.3204 
(equivalent to a one-sided P≥0.[ADDRESS_92227] ratio ≥0.886),  then that result will be 
considered negative enough to warrant closing the study early for futility.
Findings of either kind that warrant closing the study early will not be binding, but will be evaluated for closure in conjunction with safety, toxicity, and other relevant evidence.
14.2.[ADDRESS_92228] yields a Z-score equal to or more negative than –1.6621 (equivalent to a one-
sided P≤0.[ADDRESS_92229] ratio ≤0.641),  then this study will be declared a success, 
and the combination of ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_54575] + bevacizumab will be considered worthy of further study in a Phase III trial. 
The above final analysis will be accompanied by [CONTACT_5263]-Meier estimates of PFS medians and quartiles on each arm. It also will be followed up with re-analysis using a stratified version of the one-sided log-rank test that has study site and receipt of prior bevacizumab as stratification factors.

OS will be plotted as Kaplan-Meier curves, summarized by [CONTACT_84571], then compared for increase with bevacizumab via one-sided log-rank test at alpha=0.05. Both the unstratified and stratified versions of the log-rank test will be used. The stratified version will have study site and prior bevacizumab status as the stratification factors. 
Exploratory objectives.  See also Section 5.2, Exploratory Objectives.
Both PFS and OS will be analyzed via multivariate Cox regression with treatment arm and 
additional predictor variables consisting of class III β-tubulin  status, baseline levels of CA-
[ADDRESS_92231]-DNA, and baseline values of McTN characteristics such as 
number, length, and composition. These analyses will assess each additional predictor for its potential as a prognostic biomarker.APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 2/18/2021

such as number, length, and composition. These analyses will assess each additional predictor for its potential as a prognostic biomarker of response to treatment. 
Results of the proposed McTN chemosensitivity assay (Section 5.2.2), measured at 
baseline, will be used as predictor variables in logistic regression (with ORR and DDCR as outcomes) to assess how strong the correlation is between patients’ tumor-cell response to drugs and their clinical response to treatment.
The behavior during treatment of longitudinally measured McTN characteristics, TP53 -
mutated ct-DNA, and CA-125 will be studied using trajectory plots in conjunction with longitudinal-analysis approaches such as mixed-models analysis, logistic regression with generalized estimating equations, and other procedures as suggested by [CONTACT_84572]. The same longitudinally measured markers may also be entered as time-dependent covariates into Cox-regression models to study how strongly their behavior during treatment is associated with PFS and OS. These analyses will be an important component of evaluating how effective the biomarkers may be at signaling and/or presaging changes in the patient’s health in a patient-monitoring situation.    
14.4 Evaluability for Efficacy and Toxicity:
Only those patients who are deemed “ineligible” or who receive no therapy will be eliminated from the analysis. All patients who receive any therapy will be evaluated for both treatment efficacy and toxicity. While on occasion, circumstances may prevent the determination of treatment efficacy, such patients will be included in the analysis and labe led as “unknown”. This category will be listed and be 
reflected in the calculation of the response rate.APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 2/18/2021

Caregiver smoking is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in both adult smokers and their 
children who are involuntarily exposed to secondhand smoke (SHSe). Our research has found that 
caregivers who visit the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) with their children have a high 
prevalence of smoking (up to 48%), their children have high levels of SHSe equivalent to that of active 
smokers, and they regularly use the PED for nonurgent, SHSe -related complaints. These smokers are 
motivated to quit and eager to receive cessation counseling in this setting. Annually, more than 3 million 
PED visits involve treatment of children with SHSe -related illnesses. These visits provide a unique 
“teachable moment” to motivate caregiver quitting, given the relationsh ip between quitting and 
improvements in their child’s health. Because of the long, unavoidable wait times and the frequent use 
of the PED for non -urgent care, this is an ideal venue for intervening with this population. Moreover, we 
and others have demonst rated the feasibility of conducting complex randomized trials in PEDs without 
disrupting clinical flow. Building on our prior research, we propose to conduct the first randomized trial 
to test whether a cessation intervention in the PED setting can reduce caregiver smoking and decrease 
children’s SHSe . This study will test the efficacy of a cessation intervention for caregivers in a large, 
inner -city PED that is a major nodal site for the federally funded Pediatric Emergency Care Applied 
Research Network (P ECARN). The proposed Screening, Brief Intervention, and Assisted Referral to 
Treatment (SBIRT) will highlight the effects of SHSe on their child’s health. We will randomize 750 
caregivers who smoke who present to our PED with their child who has a SHSe -related illness to either 
one of two conditions: 1) SBIRT; or 2) Healthy Habits Control (HHC). The SBIRT condition will use 
components shown to be effective in the out -patient setting but not yet tested in the PED setting. It will 
include a brief form of the Clinical Practice Guideline: Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence, 
motivational interviewing, engaging and personalized materials on the effects of smoking and SHSe, 
immediate access to caregivers’ choice of cessation resources (e.g., Quitline, smokefree.go v, or 
smokefreeTXT ), a 12 -week supply of nicotine replacement therapy and booster materials for 12 weeks. 
The HHC program has been previously developed and used in the out -patient setting, and will be used 
as an attention control in which caregivers will r eceive instruction on healthy lifestyle choices to improve 
their child’s health. Cessation assistance will be offered at the study’s conclusion.  If effective, the 
SBIRT model could be routinely used in the PED setting, which could reach at least one million 
smokers a year, and could result in significant reductions in caregivers’ tobacco use, SHSe -related 
pediatric illness, and costs in this population. In addition, our results will inform the conduct of public 
health research efforts aimed at adults via the PED.  If successful, we will create a comprehensive 
package of materials for disseminating the implementation of the intervention throughout PECARN and 
non-PECARN PEDs, and EDs nationwide.   This study will also assess the prevalence and correlates o f 
cannabis smoke exposure (CSE) among PED patients who are in the SHS -exposed group.  
 
 
PURPOSE  
We propose to conduct the first randomized controlled trial to test whether a cessation intervention in the PED 
setting can reduce caregiver smoking and decrea se children’s SHSe.  
 
Primary Aim  1: To evaluate the  efficacy of the SBIRT compared to Healthy Habits Control  (HHC) condition . 
Primary outcomes are self -reported prolonged abstinence and point prevalence at 6-weeks and [ADDRESS_260967]-
enrollment , validated in all participants via expi[INVESTIGATOR_217480] .  Secondary outcomes 
include number of cigarettes smoked, quit attempts, readiness to quit, and use of cessation resources .  
 
Version:  10Dec 2021  Page 3 of 25 Hypothesis 1:  Caregivers who recei ve the SBIRT will have higher prolonged abstinence and point prevalence 
cessation rates compared to caregivers in the HHC  condition.  
Primary Aim 2:  To evaluate the eff icacy  of the SBIRT on reducing children’s SHSe. Outcomes are caregiver 
reports of total home/car smoking bans and reductions in SHSe (validated using salivary cotinine  in children ).  
Hypothesis 2 : Children of SBIRT caregivers will have higher  total home/car smo king bans and lower home/car 
smoking exposure compared to children of HHC  caregivers.  
Primary Aim 3:  To explore mediators and moderators of the SBIRT outcomes.  
Hypothesis 3:  The SBIRT intervention effect on prolonged abstinence and point prevalence cessa tion rates will 
be mediated by [CONTACT_18629]’s perception of the risk of smoking on their child’s health and the caregiver’s 
motivation to quit over time. The intervention effect will be moderated and attenuated by [CONTACT_217530], financ ial strain, and low social support to quit.   
Secondary Aim  1: To conduct a cost analysis to determine the numbers of SHSe -related PED visits and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217481]. This will provide a basis for a future, full -scale cost -benefit analysis.     
Secondary Aim 2:  Using the findings from this project and our prior research, we will develop a manual of 
operations and a comprehensive package of provider and patient materials that will be disseminated for use in 
other PEDs and EDs nationwide.    
Secondary Aim 3:  To quantify the prevalence and identify correlates of Cannabis Smoke Exposure and SHSe 
among SHS -exposed PED patients . 
Exploratory Aim:   To examine the DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns and associated clinical patterns in 
female children of smokers and their moth ers compared to a control group of female children of nonsmokers. 
We will use cheek (buccal) swabs that have been collected from participants in this Aim. We will measure 
genome-wide gene expression and DNAm  patterns  to identify and compare differentially methylated cytosine -
[phosphate] -guanine (CpG) loci in children of smokers and their mothers, and children of nonsmokers, focusing 
on loci implicated by [CONTACT_49808]. We will also examine the association between DNA m levels compared 
to cotinine levels and maternal -reported TSE patterns in children, maternal -reported tobacco use p atterns, and 
child illness types . 
 
 
BACKGROUND  
Involuntary exposure to secondhand smoke (SHSe) from caregivers who smoke is an important cause of 
morbidity and mortality in children.  Annual healthcare costs associated with SHSe and adult smoking are over  
$100 billion and increasing.1 Our research has found that among children who visit the Pediatric Emergency 
Department (PED), there is high prevalence of caregiv ers who smoke (up to 48%) and children of these 
caregivers have high levels of SHSe equivalent to that of active smokers. These smokers have incomes at or 
below the poverty level (over 50%), have limited access to cessation resources, and frequently use th e PED as 
a “safety net” for non -urgent, SHSe -related complaints such as colds and ear infections.2-6 In 2010, 56% of the 
29.[ADDRESS_260968] in those who were uninsured or Medicaid recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].7,8 These families are at increased risk 
for a variety of tobacco -related disparities including differences in: tobacco use, cessation rates, access to 
cessation resources, and adult and pediatric tobacco/SHSe -related morbidity.9-13 Encouragingly, these 
caregivers are motivated to quit and eager to receive cessation interventions in this setting.4,14-16                   
Annually, more than 3 million PED visits involve treatment of children with SHSe -related illnesses.8 These 
visits provide a unique “teachable moment” in which providers can leverage the caregiver’s desire to quit and 
the child’s current SHSe -related health condition.17-[ADDRESS_260969] 
shown that even complex randomized trials can be achieved without disrupting clinical flow .20-22 The proposed 
study will be conducted in a PED that is one of the 7 main nodes in the federally funded Pediatric Emergency  
Care Applied Resea rch Network (PECARN) which consists of [ADDRESS_260970], as the provision of cessation interventions for the caregiver, 
who is not the patient , is quite different than for an adult patient . Furthermore, the need for such interventions in 
 
Version:  10Dec [ADDRESS_260971] is responsive to the mandate to help  the “population to feel empowered to manage its health” 
thus “reducing the supply (and the demand) of unnecessary care”.[ADDRESS_260972] interventions that will reduce tobacco -related consequences in caregivers, especially in low income 
caregivers with young, racial/ethnically diverse children, are urgently needed in the PED setting.26,31-[ADDRESS_260973] of such interventions, defined as reach (the number of people who would use the intervention) 
multiplied by [INVESTIGATOR_80009] (percentage of people who use the intervention), could have a substantial public health 
impact.34 For example, of the 3 million PED visits for SHSe -related illnesses, we can conservatively estimate 
that 35% are by [CONTACT_217531]. Of these 1.1 million visits, if 20% of these caregivers 
quit, this equals over 200,[ADDRESS_260974] is to explore prevalence and correlates of cannabis smoke exposure (CSE) among 
PED patients who are in the SHS -exposed group. Trends reveal cannabis smoking is  almost four times more 
common among cigarette smokers who live with children than among nonsmokers.38 Thus, cannabis smoke can 
also be involuntarily inhaled by [CONTACT_7683], and may be harmful to their health.39 Other smoke exposure -related 
chemicals (e.g., v olatile organic compounds40) are also harmful to child health.  
 The prevalence, risk factors, and clinical effects of child cannabis smoke exposure (CSE) compared to 
SHSe is also important to understand.  However, little is also known on the prevalence of CSE and SHSe 
among PED patients and related risk factors, health effects, and healthcare utilization.   There is currently no 
precise estimate of CSE among SHS -exposed children.  Therefore, this study will  also quantify the prevalence 
and identify correlates of CSE and SHSe among SHS -exposed PED patients.  
 
 
 
METHODS  
Study Design  Overview   
Design.  We will use a randomized, two -group design for the proposed study. We will recruit 750 caregivers who 
smoke and present to the PED with their child for a SHSe -related chief complaint. Participants will be randomly 
assigned to one of two study conditions: (1) Screening, Brief Intervention, and Assisted Referral to Treatment 
(SBIRT ) Condition or (2) Healthy Habits Control (HHC) Condition.  
Pool of Potential Participants:  Approximately 6,000 pediatric patients with a SHSe related illness will present to 
the P ED with their caregiver in a 30 month period. Based on our research, we know that approximately 85% of 
caregivers (N=5,100) will be able to be screened by a Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC); at least 35% will be 
smokers (N=1,785); and at least 80% of th ese caregivers will consent (N=1,428).  
Assessments . Caregivers  will complete an informed consent .  They will also complete  the baseline electronic 
assessment on a study tablet . Caregivers will be assessed with questionnaires at baseline, approximately 6-
weeks, and approximately 6-months post -enrollment.   We will also contact [CONTACT_217532], email, 
phone, or social media to remind them of study participation.  Should we discover any missing data, we may call 
participants or conduct home visits at any time point during the study.   Before conducting these additional home 
visits, we would contact [CONTACT_217533].   We will assess all 
children at baseline and at approximately 6-weeks post -enrollment.   At 6-weeks  we will contact [CONTACT_217534] , emails , social media, text messaging,, and home visits to  children and caregivers in the SBIRT and 
HHC condition to : 1) verify abstinence on 100% of caregivers who report that they have not  smoked in the past 
 
Version:  10Dec 2021  Page 5 of 25 7 days via expi[INVESTIGATOR_217482]/or salivary cotinine , 2) obtain a follow -up salivary cotinine level 
on 100%  of children to validate total smoking bans, and 3) complete assessment of outcomes. At [ADDRESS_260975] them via social media or text messaging as well.  
Participant’s privacy will be maintained when contact[CONTACT_217535].  PHI will not be used on these messages. Should the caregiver 
report abstinence and smoking bans , a home visit will be conducted to  validate self -reported abstinence and 
total home smoking bans via salivary cotinine  on the child and via expi[INVESTIGATOR_217483]/or 
salivary cotinine on the caregivers during home visits .  Follow -ups may be conducted at CCHMC hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217484] a scheduled appointment at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] .  If study staff is unable to make contact [CONTACT_217536] -ups an unannounced home visit may be conducted 
in order to complete study procedures.   
  
Randomization.  We will stratify by [CONTACT_217537] 1: pre -contemplation, 2: contemplation  1 or 2 , or 3: preparation;41,42  thus there will 
be 8 strata for randomization. A random block randomization scheme will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_217485], and used by [CONTACT_217538]. The biostatistician 
has a SAS® program for creating  the randomization scheme that has been tested and used for other studies. 
As it is anticipated that there will be fewer male caregivers, the random blocks used will be smaller than for the 
females. The randomization scheme will be accessed by [CONTACT_217539] l ogging into a dedicated website  and 
entering the gender and readiness to quit stage, the study group assignment and a study identification number 
will be returned. Backup will be opaque envelopes, kept within the PED with stratification and study identific ation 
number marked on the outside.  
Delivery of the SBIRT and HHC.  Six or more clinical counselors/intake coordinators /research coordinators  will 
be available in the PED to deliver the SBIRT  and HHC43_ENREF_65  interventions . The use of clinical 
counselors/intake coordinators /research coordinators  will increase the generalizability of the intervention, as 
most U.S. emergency departments have clinical counselors/intake coordinators /research coordinators  available.  
Resources for quitting marijuana use:   Should participants report that they are current marijuana users, they will 
be offered  information  to help them quit marijuana use.   
Setting . This study will occur in the main PED or in the Urgent Care of CCHMC.  
Clinical Counselor /Intake Coordinator /Research Coordinator  Activities, Training, and Monitoring    
     Three or more clinical counselors/intake coordinators /research coordinators  will deliver the SBIRT 
intervention and three or more  clinical counselors/intake coordinators /research coordinators  will deliver the HHC 
intervention to caregivers while their child is waiting to be seen in the PED. All clinical counselors/int ake 
coordinators /research coordinators  will receive formal motivational interviewing (MI) training from an MI expert. 
This training, followed by [CONTACT_217540] (s) after approximately 6 months  or more , will teach them how MI can 
be used as a collaborative,  person -centered form of guiding to elicit and strengthen motivation for change and 
will help them use specific skills related to MI. Clinical counselors/intake coordinators /research coordinators  will 
be trained in MI strategies and techniques .  The MI trainer will review a selection of audio recordings of each 
clinical counselor/intake coordinator/research coordinator chosen randomly throughout the study period and they 
will receive individualized feedback on these sessions from the MI trainer. T he reviews will be spread out over 
the course of recruitment period.  The clinical counselors/intake coordinators /research coordinators ’ audio -
recorded sessions will be independently rated for adherence using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment 
Integrit y (MITI) system by [CONTACT_217541], who will provide individualized written and verbal feedback to each 
clinical counselor/intake coordinator /research coordinator .44These audio -recorded sessions will be collected in 
an ongoing basis to facilitate fidelity to  MI. MI approaches have been successfully applied in the ED setting for 
a variety of issues, including alcohol and smoking.45  
     The clinical counselor/intake coordinator /research coordinator  who delivers the SBIRT will be trained as 
a Tobacco Treatment  Specialist at a TTS training center.  This training will teach the clinical counselors/intake 
coordinators /research coordinators  how to deliver an evidence -based, cognitive behavioral treatment for nicotine 
dependence. Presentations and hands -on exercises will emphasize the understanding the addictive nature of 
tobacco use, its impact on health, and key clinical activities for asse ssing and treating the nicotine dependent 
individual. The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_217486]/intake coordinator /research coordinator  with an 
“Assisted Referral” training session focused on study logistics, the delivery of brief cessation and SHSe  reduction 
 
Version:  10Dec [ADDRESS_260976] connection to the QL, or smokefree TXT, or smokefree.gov during the PED visit. The 
clinical counselors/intake coordinators /research coordinators  will be taught to frame the messages to increase 
caregiver’s risk perception o f smoking to their child and themselves, and they will be trained to tailor the 
messages to motivation to quit and level of tobacco dependence.  46,47 The clinical counselors/intake 
coordinators /research coordinators  who deliver the HHC intervention will receive training from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_217487]’s health43 
_ENREF_65  and will be given guidance on engaging and delivering the intervention to caregivers during the PED 
visit; barrier identification and reduction techniques will be taught.  
     In order to promote fidelity and uniform implementation of the SBIRT and HH C interventions, the clinical  
counselors/intake coordinators /research coordinators  will complete a fidelity checklist after each session. 
Separate checklists for each condition will include key prescriptive and proscriptive elements for each 
condition. Sample prescriptive elements for the SBIRT include recommending total home/car bans, asking 
visitors to smoke outside, using NRT and other cessation resources to quit; sample proscriptive eleme nts are 
the presentation of the effects of SHSe on children, brief statistics on SHSe and child health outcomes, and 
benefits of quitting on children. Sample prescriptive elements for the HHS include recommending 5 fruits and 
vegetables each day, gradually  decreasing screen time, and getting kids active with fun options; sample 
proscriptive elements are the presentation of the health effects of poor diet and inactivity. Although completing 
these checklists does not ensure ideal implementation, they provide reminders to the clinical counselors/intake 
coordinators /research coordinators  to be aware of essential features that must be included in each session. In 
addition, every SBIRT and HHS intervention will be audio -recorded , except in cases where the caregive r 
declines to be audio recorded  Approximately 10% of the audio recordings will be randomly selected and 
independently rated by [CONTACT_217542].   
  Booster training sessions and problem solving sessions will  occur by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_179167] , if needed , every 
several months to problem solve issues that have come up and to provide refreshers and reminders about the 
key elements of the intervention to pr event drift and maximize consistency.  
 
SBIRT Condition  
SBIRT Protocol.  After potential participants have been identified, CRCs will obtain informed consent and enroll 
eligible caregivers, and collect baseline data. The clinical counselors/intake coordinato rs/research coordinators  
will then provide caregivers with the brief  “Advise, Assess, Assist” intervention based on the Clinical Practice 
Guidelines , and tailored on levels of motivation to quit and tobacco dependence.32_ENREF_21  If both caregivers 
are present, eligible, and wish to receive the intervention, then the clinical counselors/intake 
coordinators /research coordinators  will provide each caregiver with the “advise” portion of the intervention. 
However, only the primary caregiver (designated by [CONTACT_217543] ) will be enrolled in the study and assessed for 
data collectio n. The intervention components that will be provided are  as follows :  
1. Advise . Discuss  the effects of SHSe on their child’s health  and the benefits of quitting , and how quitting could 
improve their child’s medical symptoms and decrease future PED visits . Motivational interviewing (MI) 
techniques will be used to increase caregiver’s risk perceptions of their child’s vulnerability to SHSe and the 
health risks associated with smoking to the smoker and child.  46,49 ,50 The clinical counselors/intake 
coordinators /research coordinators  will elicit the caregiver’s beliefs about their tobacco use, the importance they 
place on quitting, and the confidence they have to quit. The clinical counselors/intake coordinators /research 
coordinators  will ask about specific barriers or facilitators to quitting (e.g., financial stress, other household 
smokers, social support, home environment, prior quit attempts, and rewards associated with quitting). They will  
collaborate to increase confidence in quitting, problem -solve how to by[CONTACT_217544], and cre ate action steps to 
quit. All caregivers will be encouraged to implement total smoking bans as a way to decrease SHSe . 51,52 For 
those not wanting to quit, o ptions will be discussed , and goals set for reducing SHSe (e.g., gradually increasing 
the proportio n of cigarettes smoked outdoors  until eliminating indoor/car smoking completely ).   
2. Assess.  The clinical counselors/intake coordinators /research coordinators  will assess caregivers’ readiness 
to quit by [CONTACT_217545] [ADDRESS_260977] in quitting, as well as to solidify and maintain  
 
Version:  10Dec [ADDRESS_260978] of 3 components:  
1) NRT:  All caregiver s who do not have any contraindications to NRT will be offered a free, 6 week supply of 
their choice of NRT patches or lozenges. . NRT will be stored in a locked cabinet in the CRC office in the PED. 
The clinical counselors/intake coordinators/ research coordinator  will screen all participants for eligibility and for 
any contraindications to NRT  using a screening  checklist (See Appendix  F). If there are any questions about 
eligibility for NRT, the clinical counselors/intake coordinators /research coordinators  will contact [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_217488] ,. The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_217489] -person or by [CONTACT_217546]. This 
arrangement has worked well for our most recent cessation trial (5K22CA163747). The screening checklist will 
be sent electronically to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_217490],  who will 
approve/disapprove the distribution of NRT to the caregiver. If there are no contraindications to NRT on the 
checklist, the form will not be sent to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_217491], and the research coordinator may dispense NRT 
to the c aregiver.  Study staff will instruct the caregiver on NRT use and they may  use expi[INVESTIGATOR_217492].  In addition, all caregivers 
will be provided a home visit for f ollow -up at 6 -weeks during which they will be asked if they were given NRT at 
baseline, and if so, i f they used the NRT . If they used approximately  80% of the NRT and wish to receive more 
NRT, they will be screened for eligibility and for any contraindications to NRT using the screening checklist in 
the same manner listed above as at baseline  (See Appendix I) . If eligible, they will receive 6 weeks of NRT.   If a 
home visit is not possible, the s urvey will be completed via phone or email and the sample may be obtained from 
the family via mail.   An approximately  four week window for follow -up will be used.   The follow -up may also be 
completed at CCHMC or another mutually agreed upon location, if the participant has an already scheduled 
appointment.   
2) Immediate connection to cessation resources:  All caregiver s will be provided an “Assisted Referral” based on 
preference. These options will include : a) Quit Line:  The clinical counselors/intake coordinators /research 
coordinators  will dial a direct number to the Ohio QL. A QL counselor will initiate brief counseling  which may 
include  counseling calls and free NR T53  If the caregiver prefers, a fax referral  may be completed and f axed to 
the QL.  
b) Web -based:  the clinical counselors/intake coordinators /research coordinators  will help the caregiver  log onto 
smokefree.gov using the computer that is in every patient’s PED room. This site has a variety of interactive tools 
including a LiveHelp online “chat” service, SHSe and cessation quizzes, a cessation mobile app, and other 
helpful resources; c) Text Messaging:  the clinical counselors/intake coordinators /research coordinators  will help 
the caregiver  sign up with smokefreeTXT. These f ree mobile services provide encouragement, advice, and tips 
to help smokers quit.   
3) Intervention Materials:  To supplement the baseline intervention, we will provide free caregiver materials shown 
to be effective in previous studies54,55   (See appendix B ).  All or some of the materials listed in Appendix B will 
be provided to the caregiver, as applicable.  Booster messages with reminders of the benefits of quitting will be 
sent by e mail, mail, or text message for 12 weeks.   
Feasibility and Genera lizability : The SBIRT is feasible for deployment in PEDs and general EDs that serve both 
children and adults. The vast majority of these settings have clinical counselors/intake coordinators /research 
coordinators  or equivalent professionals who could be tr ained to deliver the intervention. SBIRT is streamlined 
and efficient and can be integrated into acute care. Even in the most time -efficient ED settings, waiting times are 
inevitable. These provide opportunities for delivery of the SBIRT. The format of the  intervention mirrors other 
successful prevention approaches in the ED setting. Our association with PECARN provides an infrastructure 
for rapid deployment of the intervention dissemination materials leading to  widespread adoption.  
 
The Healthy Habits Control Condition  
Rationale for the use of an attention control condition.  We will use an attention control condition in order to 
determine the efficacy of the SBIRT condition. In a RCT examining the effects of a behavioral intervention, the 
use of an attention control condition helps to reduce differential attention and expectancies of treatment in the 
intervention, and will decrease threats to internal validity.56-[ADDRESS_260979] 
with the CRC as the SBIRT. The use of this attention control condition is highly consistent with good clinical care, 
unrelated to the focus of the active intervention (i.e., smoking cessation), and likely to be perceived by [CONTACT_217547].  We will use a childhood obesity prevention program entitled “Let’s Go! 5 -2-1-0” 
 
Version:  10Dec 2021  Page 8 of 25 which is a program which has been developed and used in the outpatient clinic and school  setting. This program 
is designed to help children and families eat healthy and be active, by [CONTACT_217548]: 5 fruits/vegetables, no more than 2 hours of TV/computers, [ADDRESS_260980] baseline data. The clinical counselors/intake coordinators /research coordinators  will 
provide caregivers with the brief HHC intervention based on the “Let’s Go! 5 -2-1-0” program43,58 -60  and tailored 
on current diet and activity levels. If both caregivers are pr esent, eligible, and wish to receive the intervention, 
then the clinical counselors/intake coordinators /research coordinators  will provide each caregiver with the 
recommendations. However, only the primary caregiver (designated by [CONTACT_217543]) will be enrol led in the study 
and assessed for data collection . The intervention components that will be provided are:  
1. Advise.   Caregivers will be advised by [CONTACT_217549]/intake coordinators /research coordinators  about 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_217493].  He/she will give them recommendations on daily 
nutritional and healthy lifestyle guidelines with the 5 -2-1-0 behaviors.  MI techniques will be used to increase 
caregiver’s risk perception s of the benefits of healthy choices and the clinical counselors/intake 
coordinators /research coordinators  will ask about specific barriers or facilitators to making and adhering to these 
choices.     
2. Assess.  The clinical counselors/intake coordinators /research coordinators  will assess caregivers’ readiness 
to make good lifestyle choices by [CONTACT_217550] [ADDRESS_260981] of the following components:  
1) Water bottle :  All caregiver s will be offered a free colorful  water bottle to encourage children to drink more 
water.  
2) Immediate connection to 5 -2-1-0 resources:  All caregiver s will be provided with the option to view a [ADDRESS_260982] cel ebrated holidays without extra 
sugar and fats; ideas for non -TV or video game related activities; and information on how to read food labels.   
3) Intervention Materials:  To supplement the baseline intervention, we will provide free caregiver materials use d 
in other healthcare setting ( see appendix C ).  All or some of the materials listed in Appendix C will be provided 
to the caregiver, as applicable.   These materials are  downloadable from www.letsgo.org.68,91 -93  The caregivers  
will receive email/mail/text message s (caregiver’s preference), for [ADDRESS_260983] participants via  phone calls , emails, text messaging, social media,  and 
home visits to  children and caregivers in the SBIRT and HHC condition to : 1) verify abstinence on 100% of 
caregivers who report that they have not smoked in the past 7 days via expi[INVESTIGATOR_217494] , 2) obtain a follow -up salivary cotinin e level on 100%  of children to validate total smoking bans, 
and 3) complete assessment of outcomes. At [ADDRESS_260984]  all caregivers  via phone , text messaging, 
social media  or email.  Should the caregiver report abstinence and smoking bans , a home visit will be conducted 
to validate self -reported abstinence and total home smoking bans via salivary cotinine  on the child and via 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_217495]/or salivary cotinine  on the caregivers during home visits .  Follow -ups may 
be conduct ed at CCHMC hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217496] a scheduled appointment at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].   If a 
home visit is not possible, the assessments will be conducted over the phone or via email.  An approximately  
four week window for the follow -up assessments will be used.   
At the study’s conclusion, the HHC group will be given brief information regarding resources for quitting smoking 
over the telephone.  A script will be used by [CONTACT_217551].   
Screening for missed eligible patients  
We will assess for missed eligible patients by [CONTACT_217552], but not limited to, second hand smoke exposure  
complaints in children 0-18 years old through our EMR periodically, and a chart revie w will be completed for 
those not enrolled in the study to gather data about missed eligible patients.  We are requesting a waiver of 
consent to review these patient s’ charts.   Data about missed patients may be used to assess screening hours 
as well asses s for training needs when missed eligible patients are identified during screening time.  Missed 
eligible data will include the patients ’ encounter ID and medical record number, arrival date and time, age, who 
escorted the patient to the ED, triage code, spoken language, chief complaint and arrival complaint, triage start 
 
Version:  10Dec [ADDRESS_260985] results, 
treatment, disposition, and healthcare visit patterns. Again, we are requesting a waiver of consent to review 
these patient’s charts.  These patients cannot be  consented prior to participation.  However, their rights and 
welfare will not be affected by [CONTACT_217553].  The patients’ data will be the same as those consented into 
the study and they will still receive the same care regardless of study participation.  
Participant Screening, Enrollment, and Exclusion  
     During the approximat ely 48-month or longer study enrollment period, CRCs and approximately 1-2 pairs of 
clinical counselors/intake coordinators /research coordinators  (i.e., one from each condition) will provide study 
coverage every weekday. This increases the opportunities fo r recruitment and delivery of the interventions. Our 
prior research demonstrates that approximately 3 CRCs will be more than adequate to recruit 750 caregivers. 
Enrollment times will represent peak PED volumes. CRC s will screen consecutive caregivers of pa tients 
presenting to the PED using CCHMC’s EMR system, Epic. CRCs will identify caregivers by [CONTACT_217554].   A secure database will be used which will include all patients, their age, gender, 
race, chief complaint, enrollment status, and reasons for non -enrollment.   
     Eligible caregiver adult participants must: 1) be > or equal to age 18; 2) be accompanying a child 0 -17 years 
of age 2) be a daily smoker; 3) speak and read English (if shown to be efficacious, we will translate the 
intervention materials and test it with multi -lingual CRCs and clinical counselors/intake coordinators /research 
coordinators  in a f uture trial),  4) have a permanent address and a working cell or landline number , 5) live within 
an approximately  50 mile radius of CCHMC (since we will conduct home visits .)  
Eligible child participants must:  1) Not be a current smoker  of tobacco or mari juana ; 2) present to the 
PED with : (a) a stable condition, that is, patients who are not critically ill and do not require immediate treatment 
and intervention by [CONTACT_217555]  (triage levels 2 -5) and (b) a potentially SHSe -related complaint ( which 
will include complaints such as wheezing, difficulty breathing, cough , ear infection, cold , ear pain, runny nose, 
congestion, flu, asthma, shortness of breath ) as outlined by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Surgeon General;48  or SHSe -related 
discharge diagnosis . 
 If both caregivers are present and eligible, they will be asked to identify the primary caregiver and if one 
or both want to receive the intervention. Although both caregivers may receive the intervention, only the primary 
caregiver will be enrolled and  assessed for data collection. Based on our previous studies, we know that both 
caregivers are present in the PED and eligible for the study less than 5% of the time. Child participants  will be 
excluded if they have  a tracheostomy .  Adult caregivers will b e excluded if they are  tobacco chewers only, using 
pharmacologic cessation treatment,  plan to move within the study period  (if they do not know their new address) , 
or do not have a working phone number or permanent address  The CRC will obtain informed con sent.  
For the CSE study aim, caregiver survey data on cannabis use and child CSE  and stored child urine 
samples will be assessed from the child -parent participants in the SHS -exposed group who consented to 
providing this additional data and child urine sam ples.   Eligibility criteria for the CSE study aim of this project 
are the same as the SHS -exposed group, and with the additional eligibility criteria that they will have: caregiver 
survey data on cannabis use and child CSE ; a sub -sample of children have stored urine samples available for 
lab analysis of biomarkers of exposure; and provided informed consent to analyze the associated data and 
child urine samples.  
 
 
 
POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
There may be no direct benefit to adult participants other than the counseling and NRT that they will receive 
from the study in the intervention condition. The intervention may help them decrease their smoking. Cessation 
would reduce their risk of contracting lu ng and/or oral cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary 
heart disease, or periodontal disease. Intervention participants will become more aware of the health risks 
 
Version:  10Dec [ADDRESS_260986] benefit to the 
children of the caregivers in the intervention condition : if their caregivers quit or decrease their smoking habits, 
then their children will be exposed to lower levels of SHS. In addition, the benefit to society and rese arch on 
PED-based cessation is potentially great. Since patients who are economically disadvantaged or of minority 
status use PEDs disproportionately, the results of this study may especially help determine the effectiveness of 
cessation interventions in t his setting which could benefit society and the scientific community. The intervention 
may be disseminated to other PEDs if found to be effective. The risks this research may have for participation 
are very small  but the potential benefit far outweighs the  risk of slight embarrassment, increased time in the PED, 
potential loss of confidentiality, and risks of NRT.  
 
POSSIBLE RISKS, DISCOMFORTS, OR INCONVENIENCES  
 
There are [ADDRESS_260987] to study participation :   
(1) The potential to interfere with medical care that is ongoing : The study will specifically exclude caregivers 
of patients who are not medically stable during the ED visit. Only caregivers of patients who are stable, that is , 
who are not critically ill and do not require imm ediate treatment and intervention by [CONTACT_217555] , will be 
eligible for enrollment in this proposed study. These patients are, by [CONTACT_217556], clinically stable, not ill 
appearing, and not felt to be at high risk of deterioration or morbidi ty. All enrolled patients will be assessed, 
examined, and reassured by a triage nurse prior to enrollment.  We will stress in the consent that participation 
in the study will be entirely voluntary and will not affect the care in the emergency department. C aregivers who 
participate may have an additional 30 -40 minute longer ED visit time; however, the interviews and surveys will 
not be done while medical care is being delivered;  
(2) Emotional discomfort when an swering the issues raised by [CONTACT_114380] : Som e of our participants may 
feel uncomfortable an swering some of the questions about their smoking habits, particularly in an ED setting 
where such questions are not anticipated.  The consent form will clearly state that caregivers will be asked 
questions su ch as “Do you smoke?” and “How many cigarettes do you smoke a day?”  
(3) Loss of confidentiality : Confidentiality issues dominate concerns for the successful completion of this 
study. Subjects are asked to provide the participants/family members/neighbor’s address, phone numbers: 
home number, work number, cell phone number; and email address. Participants may also be concerned 
about providing information on their demographics and smoking habits and the related lack of privacy. Special 
procedures will be put in place to assure that the data from the electronic questionnaires and follow -up 
questionnaires are kept secure and confidential.   In addition, there is the potential for breach of confidentiality 
from the audio recorded sessions.  In o rder to prevent this, no identifying information will be used in the audio 
recordings and the audio recordings will be destroyed at the end of the study.   
(4) Nicotine withdrawal and NRT effects : If the participant quits using tobacco, he or she could expe rience 
withdrawal symptoms from nicotine cravings such as hunger, anxiety, restlessness, or sleep disturbance. 
Individuals who quit their addiction to tobacco products commonly experience these symptoms. If the subject 
uses NRT, they might experience a neg ative reaction. We will include a statement on the informed consent 
form warning of the possible side effects of NRT use, and the contraindications for use of NRT. NRT will never 
be dispensed without review of the caregiver’s history by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_217497]. In addition, detailed information on 
the use of Nicotine Replacement Therapy (including contraindications for use) will be given to participants. 
Participants will be screened by [CONTACT_978] (a physician) or a trained CRC supervised by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_217498]. Participants receiving NRT will be instructed to call the PI [INVESTIGATOR_217499], concerns 
or problems related to the NRT. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_217500], 
appropriate medical advice. If any adverse reactions or complications occur as a result of this study, we will 
contact [CONTACT_4707] (IRB) Chairperson within five working days.  
 
Pregnancy : Pregnant smokers, nursing mothers, or women attempting to become pregnant during the course 
of this study will be allowed to participate in the study, but will not receive nicotine patches  or lozenges .  
 
 
Version:  10Dec 2021  Page 11 of 25 RISK -BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
Risk -Benefit Analysis:   We believe the benefits of this study outweigh the potential risks of participation.  It is 
recommended that this proposal be classified as minimal risk with potential direct benefit to the participants.  
 
DURATION  
   This project will take 7 years. In Year 1 (YI), we will:  obtain IRB approval; finalize the SBIRT and HHC protocol, 
materials, and procedures; train CRC and clinical counselors/intake coordinators /research coordinators ; provide 
practitioner in -services. Recruitment, follow -up assessments, and chart review to evaluate SHSe -related PED 
visits/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217501] 54. The remainder of Y5 will be devoted to data 
and cost analyses; delivery of the cessation information to HH C caregivers; and if the intervention is found to be 
effective, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706] -I ([CONTACT_217584]) will develop a comprehensive guide for implementation at other PEDs. In 
addition, we will develop dissemination and cost benefit analysis plans for CCHMC and other  PEDs.    
For the CSE study aim, this study has caregiver survey assessment data available from caregivers who 
responded to the cannabis use and child CSE questions.  Stored urine samples from children in the SHS e 
group will be sent by [CONTACT_217557] (CDC) Laboratory where they 
will conduct biochemical validation of smoke exposure. In Years [ADDRESS_260988] (EHR) data from CCHMC Epic, and 
stored child urine samples from CCHMC.   In Years [ADDRESS_260989] statistical analyses and disseminate 
the additional CSE and SHSe results via publications and presentations.  It will take about 6 -8 months to 
receive the urine sample analysis results.  
 
DATA ANALYSIS M ETHODS  
Data Collection, Retention Strategies, and Measures    
Data Collection and Participant Retention . All baseline assessments will be electronically sent to a central, 
secure, HIPAA -compliant firewalled CCHMC database.  We will use multiple strategies to retain the sample by 
[CONTACT_217558] [INVESTIGATOR_7706] -Is in studies of high -risk, low income populations.61-
65  These strategies include: 1) Generous incentives:15_ENREF_92  Participants will be paid with increasing 
compensation of $ 30 at baseline, $50 at 6 -weeks  ($20 for phone assessment and $30 for home visit) , and $6 5 
at 6-months  ($30 for ph one assessment and $3 5 for home visit) ; 2) Conducting home visits on all caregivers 
and children at the [ADDRESS_260990] used approximately 80% of the NRT provided at baseline ; 3) 
Hiring and training CRCs to carefully track participants, make home visits, and obtain follow -up data by [CONTACT_217559] -up attempts as is necessary to locate participants; 4) Sending caregivers: weekly 
email/mail/text messages with cessation or healthy hab its tips for 12 weeks, reminders of upcoming 
assessments. We will ask order of preference of type of reminders and follow -up; however if one technique is 
unsuccessful, the second and finally third choice will be used; 5) B randing study contact [CONTACT_217560];  6) Collecting contact [CONTACT_217561]. Cell phone numbers, e -mail addresses, 
and preferred times of contact [CONTACT_183884] ; 7)  Asking our on-site Co -I (Ammerman) to provide  strategies 
to maximize retention through thorough tracking and monitoring of study participants .8) Study staff will attempt 
to contact [CONTACT_38439], text, email or traditional ma il in order to complete the follow -ups.  In the event 
that a research participant becomes lost to follow -up and traditional re -contact [CONTACT_41528] (i.e. telephone, text, 
email, traditional mail, etc.) are unsuccessful, the use of a nationwide electronic search  strategy will be 
employed,  This will include general use of public web -based search functionality, and as a last resort, the use 
of a 3rd party service (Accurint).  Accurint  will be administered through a centralized standard process 
managed by [CONTACT_217562] C Center for Clinical and Translational Science and Training (CCTST) .  Only 
demographic information will be utilized for the purpose of facilitating the Accurint search function.  Specific 
individual requests will be submitted to a designated member of the  CCTST staff that will perform the search 
using the Accurint functionality.  CCTST staff will provide a report back to the research team that includes the 
most current available contact [CONTACT_217563](s).  Records of eac h search 
will be maintained and available for IRB review if needed.

months.  
Outcome Measures . Primary outcomes will be caregiver prolonged abstine nce and 7 -day point prevalence of 
tobacco use at 6 -weeks and 6 -months. Secondary caregiver outcomes will include cigarettes smoked, quit 
attempts, readiness to quit, and use of NRT and cessation resources (QL, smokefreeTXT , smokefree.gov). Child 
outcomes will be presence or absence of total home/car smoking bans, reported SHSe, and number of SHSe -
related PED visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217502].  
Baseline Assessment.  (Table 1) The brief baseline assessment (T0) will be conducted using a self -
admini stered electronic survey to be completed on a tablet computer. The assessment items chosen are 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_217503] -income disadvantaged study populations.42,66 -
71 39,63-68 The items are brief, easily comprehensible , and take into account low literacy levels. They are as 
follows:

1. Demographics and tobacco use . We will collect gender, age, race/ethnicity, level of education, employment 
status, , number of cigarettes smoked daily, time to the first cigarette of the day, nicotine dependence, number 
of attempts to quit >24 hours, use of pharmacological and/or beha vioral treatments for quitting, motivation to quit 
using the Contemplation Ladder, and stage of change in readiness to quit. 41,72 Questions will also be asked 
about marijuana use by [CONTACT_217565]; participants will not be required to answer these 
questions. Participants who consented prior to Version 11 of the protocol may be re -consented at follow -up such 
that we may obtain information about marijuana use.   
2. Financial Strain.  Three items will be used to measure financial strain.74 The questions are: “How difficult is 
it for you to live on your total household income right now?”, “In the next three months, how often do you think 
that you or your family will experience a bad time such as poor housing or not having enough food?”, and “I n 
the next three months, how often do you expect that you will have to do without the basic things that your 
family needs?” The three items will be measured on five -point scales and averaged to create a financial strain 
score (α = .802). Higher scores will  reflect more financial strain.  
3. Risk perception to child.  Perceived vulnerability regarding the effects of his/her smoking on their child will be 
assessed using adapted measures by [CONTACT_217566]. Perceived Vulnerability -Child will be measured with  items 
including: “How concerned are you that smoking will make y our child’s illness worse?”. Higher scores indicate 
higher perceived vulnerability.77-[ADDRESS_260992] on their child using the adapted precaution -effectiveness measures by [CONTACT_217567], et. al. Precaution 
Effectiveness -Child (PE -C) will be measured by [CONTACT_217568]: “If you stop smoking, how much would that 
decrease your child’s symptoms?” . Higher scores indicate higher perceived vulnerability.77-79  
7. Child’s SHSe . Child’s SHSe will be assessed by [CONTACT_217569], locations of smoking, and number of cigarettes smoked. We 
will use questions adapted from previous studies.52,[ADDRESS_260993] a complete smoking ban. Epic c hart review will be conducted to assess 
SHSe -related PED visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217504] 6 -months prior to baseline.  
8. Healthy Lifestyle Habits.  We will assess healthy lifestyle practices (daily fruit/vegetable/sugary drink 
consumption, daily exercise and screen time) of all children.  
9. Consumer satisfaction measure . SBIRT and HHC caregivers will complete a satisfaction survey measuring 
interven tion satisfaction  and perceived usefulness.84   
10. Secondhand and Thirdhand tobacco smoke from tobacco and marijuana exposure.  There is evidence that 
homes of smokers of tobacco and marijuana become reservoirs of persistent toxic tobacco smoke pollutants 
(including nicotine, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH),  tobacco -specific nitrosamine (TSNA) , and other 
pollutants) , to which nonsmokers may be exposed even after smoking cessation through inhalation, ingestion, 
 
Version:  10Dec [ADDRESS_260994] : 1) saliva samples from all children  and hand  wipe 
samples of all children during the baseline visit, 2) urine samples from all children who can easily urinate into a 
cup or bag or who urinate in a diaper if there is time during the baseline visit, 3) hand  wipe samples of all 
children during the 6 -week home /other location  visit, 4) urine samples from all children who can easily urinate 
into a cup or bag or who urinate in a diaper if there is time during the 6-week visit, 5) home dust samples and 
surface wipe samples and air samples from all home visits at 6 -weeks if the CRC goes to the home, 6) hand  
wipe samples of children that have home /other location  visits at 6 months, 7) home dust samples and surface 
wipe samples and air samples from any home visits at 6 -months  if the CRC goes to the home, 8) urine 
samples from all children who can easily urinate into a cup or bag or who urinate in a diaper if there i s time 
during any 6 -month visits ; 9) cheek swabs from the caregiver and the child at six weeks and at six months , 10) 
home surface area measurements . Urine collection kits may be given to participants at any of the study time 
points  and may be mailed to, g iven to, or collected from participants before or after follow -up visits. Urine that 
is collected by [CONTACT_217570]. These biological and environmental samples will be stored in the CTRC  and 
may be analyzed for thirdhand tobacco smoke , secondhand and thirdhand marijuana smoke  exposure . Once 
sample analyses are completed, we may examine how SHS and THS tobacco and/or marijuana levels are 
associated with data that may include  child demographics, caregiver tobacco and/or marijuana use, home 
characteristics, child clinical findings, disposition, and child healthcare visits  once  funds become available.   
Participants may opt out of h aving their samples analyzed for marijuana smoke exposure.  Participants who 
were consented prior to version 11 of the protocol may be re -consented at follow -up in order to use these 
samples for marijuana smoke exposure analyses.   If the follow -up visits do not occur in the participant’s home, 
then dust samples will not be obtained ; although participants who do not have a home visit will be asked to 
bring a vacuum bag, if available .  When funds become available, biological and environmental samples from 
participants and their homes  will be sent to the Measurement & Evaluation Research Group (MERG) at San 
Diego State University Research Foundation  for analysis.  The San Diego State University site will be given 
information  that may include  data such as : type of specimen, study ID number, portions of baseline and follow -
up assessments (including sociodemographics), and measurements and description of the area of the home 
sampled .  Leftover samples will be returned to  CCHMC.  A Materials Transfer Agreement is in place which 
details these procedures .  
For the CSE study aim, this study has caregiver survey assessment data available from caregivers who 
responded to the cannabis use and child CSE questions.  Stored urine s amples from children in the SHS -
exposed group will be sent by [CONTACT_217571] (CDC) Laboratory 
where they will conduct biochemical validation of smoke exposure. It will take about [ADDRESS_260995] submitted an application to The Children’s Health Exposure Analysis Resource (CHEAR). As stated 
on the CHEAR Data Repository Data Submission Agreement: “CHEAR  was establish ed by [CONTACT_217572] (NIEHS) to provide analytical and laboratory services to support 
researchers who want to include environmental exposure assessment in their studies. If our application is 
 
Version:  10Dec 2021  Page 14 of 25 accepted, The Center fo r Data Science (“Data Center”) at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai will 
provide a data repository for storing epi[INVESTIGATOR_217505] (“Lab Hubs”).”  
Should our application get accepted, the terms of the “CHEAR Data Repository Data Submission Agreement” 
and the “Data Sharing Plan for the CHEAR Data Repository” must be agree d upon and signed by [CONTACT_978] ([CONTACT_217585] -Gittens) and an “IRB Attestation Letter for CHEAR Data Submission” from the CCHMC IRB must be 
signed and submitted to CHEAR.  
 
Should our application get accepted, we will share human data and samples on those parti cipants who 
consented to future research, with the CHEAR Data Repository. As per the Data Sharing Plan and the CHEAR 
Data Repository Data Submission Agreement, this data will include individual -level data such as 
“…epi[INVESTIGATOR_75144], information which h as been collected and recorded from study participants. These 
data include, but are not limited to, research and clinical assessments and information obtained via interviews, 
direct observations, biomarker data, records reviews, genomic data (e.g., sequenc e, transcriptomic, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_141214], and/or gene expression data), psychophysiological assessments, data from physical 
examinations, etc. Additionally, information necessary to interpret the data (e.g., study protocols, data 
collection instruments, survey tools)  will be shared (Please see Data Sharing Plan).  The data will be submitted 
to the CHEAR Data Repository at the CHEAR Center for Data Science at Mount Sinai (CHEAR Data Center).   
    Within the embargo period, the data will be available only to the CHEAR Data Center and the Study PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_217506] -access.  After the embargo period, data stripped of personal identifiers will be available 
through unrestricted access. All submitted data will be made available for public use access, after an embargo 
period , as publically accessibledatasets  that have been stripped of personal identifiers .  If appropriate, it is 
expected that the Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_217507] 
(dbGaP) in addition to submitting the data to  the relevant NIH -designated data repository (e.g., dbGaP, Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO), Sequence Read Archive (SRA), the Cancer Genomics Hub) after registration.  
     Data Submission and Release Timeline:  Data that has been stripped of personal identifiers will be shared 
no later than the acceptance for first publication of the findings from the data set (embargo period).”      
      
11. Clinical and cost data. We will be evaluating the clinical characteristics a nd associated costs/charges of the 
baseline visit and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (if the child is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]) and any SHSe -related or other visits or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217508] 12  months prior and /or [ADDRESS_260996] 
clinical data and costs from the charts that may include data on the presenting illness and illness severity (e.g., 
heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], oxygen saturation, physical exam findings, triage level, chief complaint, discharge 
diagnosis, disposition), lab  tests, procedures, interventions, and test results (if any) , during these visits and/or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
12.   
Follow -up Assessments (Table 1). All participants will be assessed at 6 -weeks (T1) during home visits and at 6 -
months (T2) via phone or email; home visits will be made to conduct biochemical validation of caregivers and 
children when caregivers report that they have quit at T2. We will u se self -report measures of prolonged 
abstinence and biochemically validated point prevalence at T1 and T2 to assess cessation.85-87  Point prevalence 
of tobacco use will be measured by [CONTACT_67935]: ‘‘Have you smoked, even a puff, in the last 7 days?’’ Car egivers 
will be considered abstainers if they report no tobacco use in the past 7 days. Prolonged abstinence will be 
measured by [CONTACT_67935]: ‘‘When did you last smoke a cigarette?’’ Response categories will range from ‘‘less 
than 1 month ago’’ to ‘‘more than 6 months ago.’’ Secondary outcomes will be assessed, including nicotine 
dependence, readiness to change, a quit attempt of > 24 hours, patterns of smoking, number of cigarettes 
smoked/day, treatment initiation, NRT or other pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_99399], QL,  text, or web follow -up. As described 
above, we will use measures of child SHSe to assess children’s exposure and if home/car smoking bans are 
present . Secondary outcomes pertaining to the child’s SHSe, total home/car smoking bans, and SHSe -related 
healthc are utilization (PED visits or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217502]) will be assessed .  
Biochemical Validation.  At 6-weeks, we will conduct home visits to: (1) verify abstinence on caregivers who report 
that they have not smoked in the past 7 days via expi[INVESTIGATOR_217509]  (2) obtain 
 
Version:  10Dec 2021  Page 15 of 25 a follow -up salivary cotinine level on children to va lidate total home smoking bans, and (3) complete assessment 
of outcomes. Cotinine is generally accepted to be the best of the available biomarkers, with over 95% specificity 
and sensitivity, it is noninvasive, and easily obtained in young children .85,86_ENREF_114  A standard protocol will 
be used to collect saliva samples from each child  at baseline ,  6-weeks , and possibly 6 months . Cotinine analyses 
will be performed with Enzyme Immunoass ay techniques by [CONTACT_217573], Sate College, PA.    In the child 
samples, the lower limit of cotinine sensitivity is 0.05 ng/ ml (range of sensitivity: 0.06 -200 ng/ml); undetectable 
cotinine values will be recorded as 0 ng/ml.87,88 Alternatively, if additional funds are avai lable, cotinine analyses 
may be assessed with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS).   Caregiver abstinence will be 
established if the caregiver’s expi[INVESTIGATOR_217510] 6 ppm ; salivary cotinine may be 
assessed to confirm abst inence in caregivers who report they have quit if their exhaled carbon monoxide does 
not provide verification .  At 6 months, we will assess all caregivers via phone or email, and validate self -reported 
abstinence and total home smoking bans via expi[INVESTIGATOR_217511]/or salivary cotinine .  
    
Data Management  
Data management will occur at CCHMC. P articipants will complete the baseline assessment on a web -
enabled tablet research computer. D ata will be collected and managed using REDCap (Research Electronic 
Data Capture) .92_ENREF_116  The Redcap Mobile App may also be used in order to scan barcodes  on samples .   
 
DATA ANALYSIS  
Sample Size and Power Estimates  
Sample Size. Our estimate of the number of caregivers that we plan to enroll is based on the average number 
of unique patients and the smoking prevalence of caregivers seen in a 12 -month period in the PED at CCHMC.  
Based on enroll ment in previous studies (which had average annual enrollment of 300 -350 caregivers), and a 
30 month chart review on the number of annual visits for patients with SHS -related complaints (at least 6,000), 
we are conservatively expecting to enroll [ADDRESS_260997] be 
adjusted for potential attrition of approximately 20% at 6 months, although all efforts w ill be used to decrease 
this attrition rate, leaving a total of 600; [ADDRESS_260998] sizes: Evaluation of outcomes.  Based on the recommendations of Hughes et al.,85,86 we will 
use 2 criteria for abstinence: [ADDRESS_260999] that 6 -month point prevalence in the HHC condition will be 6.3%.54 For prolonged 
abstinence, we are basing our estimation on the 2.1% rate for the HHC and 7% rate for SBIRT. We are 
conservatively estimating a point prevalence cessation rate of 6.3% and prolonged abstinence rate of 2.1% in 
the HHC group.54 We are basing our estimate of 6 -month point prevalence of th e SBIRT group on the odds ratio 
derived from meta -analyses assessing the effectiveness of NRT vs. a control, ranging from 1.4 -4.6,54 to give a 
cessation rate of 10 -12% in the SBIRT group. However, since a clinical counselor/intake coordinator /research 
coordinator  will be conducting the intervention, we expect high compliance in implementation. Thus, we are 
estimating a cessation rate of 12% in the SBIRT group. Similarly, for prolonged abstinenc e, we are assuming a 
rate of 7% in the SBIRT group.   
 
 
Power (Table 2). Power analyses are based on estimates of differences in both [ADDRESS_261000] 80% power

be able to detect a 5.5% increase in cessation rate. 
For [ADDRESS_261001] an increase 
of 4.5% with 300 subjects per group and 4.2% with 
the multiple imputation assumption. These 
estimates are c onsistent with the predicted

Analytic Plan  
Data analyses will be conducted at CCHMC and at the University of Cincinnati. A DTA will be established with 
study investigators at the University of Cincinnati.  Data will incl ude demographics, smoking behavior, data from 
the parent assessments, clinical data, and EMR data.  The data will be a limited data set stripped of identifiers.  
It will be shared on an encrypted file.   
 
Preliminary Analyses.  Univariate and bivariate examination of variables will be done first. Distributional properties 
of the continuous outcome variables will be examined. T o control for non -normal distributions and heterogeneous 
error variances, we will use logarithmic transformation and rep ort geometric means and associated 95% 
confidence intervals; this is particularly relevant for cotinine. We will conduct several preliminary analyses prior 
to addressing the Study Aims: (1) Examination for out of range values; (2) Comparison of baseline ch aracteristics 
of caregivers and children across groups. If baseline differences are found, further analyses will include these 
variables as covariates in assessing caregiver and child outcomes as appropriate; and (3) Attrition analyses to 
assess if: Partic ipants who were lost to follow -up are different from those retained. Although we do not expect 
differential attrition by [CONTACT_19313], it will be evaluated and if it occurs, we will weight the follow -up data to reflect the 
proportion assigned to each group. If ke y variables significantly predict attrition, we will examine the analysis 
with and without the drop -outs. Thus, we will compare our primary outcomes using a multiple imputation 
approach for missing data to allow maximum utilization of our data. When includ ing those that were lost to follow -
up, the outcome data may be weighted using a response propensity analysis94,95  which uses the baseline 
distributions on these variables so that follow -up data has the same distributi ons on these variables as the 
baseline data. For all analyses we shall include in the model an indicator variable to account for which clinical 
counselor/intake coordinator /research coordinator  was involved in the delivery of the SBIRT or HHC.  
General approach for addressing study aims.  This is a two -group RCT, wherein caregivers are randomly 
assigned to the SBIRT Group vs. HHC group. The appropriate statistical models for analyses of data for inclusion 
of time dependent outcomes are General Lin ear Mixed Models (GLMM) for data either with a Gaussian/normal 
distribution or with a binomial or Poisson distribution, using the appropriate link function, invoking Generalized 
Estimating Equations (GEE) to account for the longitudinal aspect of the data.96  
   We will use GLMM to evaluate the relative effectiveness of the SBIRT versus HHC group on our primary 
outcomes: point prevalence and prolonged abstinence at 6 -months. The analysis will be repeated with caregiver 
level differences between groups inclu ded as covariates. We will use mixed model analysis of covariance, with 
repeated measures to assess change (controlling for baseline differences between groups) to assess the effect 
of the SBIRT on secondary outcomes including reduction in use, number of q uit attempts, and changes in 
readiness to quit.  Kappa statistic will be used to assess agreement between the caregiver’s self -report and the 
assessment of tobacco use based on expi[INVESTIGATOR_217512]/or salivary cotinine at 6 months. It is 
possible that use of and adherence to the NRT will influence outcomes in the intervention group. In addition, 
some of the participants in the control condition may obtain NRT during the study interval. We will examine NRT 
use or dose, de fined as self -reported adherence, as a covariate in order to control for this possible relationship.  
Analyses for Primary Aims 1 -3. 
  Primary Aim 1, Hypothesis 1:  We hypothesize that SBIRT participants will have higher prolonged abstinence 
and point preva lence cessation rates compared to those in the HHC group. As stated above, our primary 
approach to the analysis is using multiple imputation, with  clinical counselors/intake coordinators /research 
coordinators  included in the model. We shall then use analy sis of covariance, to control for any baseline 
differences of caregivers between conditions. In addition we will also control for motivation to quit, considered a 
priori as a potential covariate, using the score on the contemplation ladder. As we are strat ifying on motivation 
to quit and caregiver gender, we will initially enter this into the model as an interaction. To address child cotinine 
as the [ADDRESS_261004] and then an analysis of covariance to incorporate the variables 
differe nt at baseline. Incorporating the 6 -week outcome values, we will use GLMM invoking GEE for the repeated 
 
Version:  10Dec 2021  Page 17 of 25 measures and also a model including covariates. This approach will be used to assess the intervention’s effect 
on abstinence and point prevalence and ch ild cotinine.  
   Primary Aim 2, Hypothesis 2: We will evaluate the effectiveness of the SBIRT on total home/car smoking bans 
and on child SHSe which will be measured by [CONTACT_217574], as recommended 
by [CONTACT_217575].87 The reliability of caregiver’s reports will be examined by [CONTACT_217576] 6-months using Pearson’s correlations. For validation, we will compare the child’s 
salivary cotinine concentrations for those reporting total home/car smoking bans and those not, we shall also 
examine the change in cotinine levels from baseline for those i nitiating bans versus not. The computational 
procedure will use data from the [ADDRESS_261005] -intervention. Next, we will investigate change from 6 -weeks to 6 -months to examine maintenance 
effects. To examine overall change, we will use GEE, examining linear and quadratic terms for time, group, and 
group × time interactions as explanatory variables.[ADDRESS_261006] 
as a covariate for this analysis.  
  Primary Aim 3, Hypothesis 3:  We hypothesize that the SBIRT intervention effect on prolonged abstinence and 
point prevalence cessation rates will be mediated by [CONTACT_18629]’s perception of the risk of smoking on their 
child’s health, or on their readiness to quit over time.42,66,67, 69,70,99 Bivariate analyses will be used to initially 
examine if the variables measuring this phenomena, susceptibility, severity and benefits of quitting are 
associated with cessation at each time point and if there are any changes in perceived health ris k from baseline 
to 6-months in the SBIRT versus HHC groups. We will build on the models from our primary aim to determine 
the association of these potential mediators.  Analysis assessing these effects will be conducted using 
abstinence at each follow -up point as the dependent variable and testing for interactions between treatment (i.e., 
intervention) and the potential mediator. Additionally, we will examine the main effects of the intervention within 
each level of the mediator to establish whether the int ervention is effective in each subgroup, acknowledging 
that we may be underpowered for some subgroups.  
Mediation analysis :  To assess whether our intervention improved cessation outcomes via the proposed 
mediators, we will perform mediation analyses using  both the criteria of Baron & Kenny100  and Holmbeck.[ADDRESS_261007]; outcome, intervention and mediator are mainly categorical. The first [ADDRESS_261008] step, we will assess the relationship between 
each of the proposed mediators and the study outcome at each follow -up. The same 3 steps will be repeated 
with adjustment for potential confounders and/ or moderators as determined from analysis for Hypothesis 3. The 
mediating variables that will be considered are: perception of child’s risk from SHSe and the benefits to the child 
of quitting, also motivation to quit, self -efficacy .  Moderating variables a re household smokers, financial strain, , 
nicotine dependence, and prior quit attempts.  
In the final analysis, the entire theoretical model to predict outcome will be examined using structural equation 
modeling (SEM). The strength of SEM in examining the e ntire model is that this method allows for the analysis 
of a hypothesized pattern of directional and non -directional linear relationships among a set of latent variables 
(e.g., caregiver beliefs about their child’s SHSe risk) and measured variables (e.g., point prevalence).[ADDRESS_261009] of perceived risk of SHSe and perceived child benefits of quitting; 
we will incorporate the former as latent variables over the study period. We will also be able to examine the 
relati ve relationship of caregiver’s beliefs and readiness to quit with the outcome of cessation.  
Analyses for Secondary Aim 1.  Working closely with [CONTACT_217586] (health services and economic consultant), 
we will collect the cost data needed to conduct a cost  analysis of the SBIRT intervention. The cost inventory may 
include costs and charges from the baseline PED visit  and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (if the child is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]) and from 
SHSe -related PED visits or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217513] [ADDRESS_261010] inventory will also include  data collected from CRCs and clinical counselors/intake 
coordinators /research coordinators  in both conditions about cessation -related activities and expenses, self -
reported abstinence, an d use of all tobacco products at each follow -up. Cost inputs will include staff time for 
tobacco screening, chart flagging, cessation counseling, giving informational materials and NRT, and referral to 
the QL, smokefreeTXT , or smokefree.gov.  To determine costs of SHSe -related PED visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217514]:  10Dec [ADDRESS_261011]/charges data will be collected from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217515] [ADDRESS_261012] component for intervention delivery will be the minutes the 
clinical counselors/intake coordinators /research coordinators  spends in counseling. Alth ough the intervention 
will occur during the time the patient is waiting for care, the time the clinical counselor/intake coordinator /research 
coordinator  spends represents an opportunity cost of other alternative ways of spending this time with caregivers 
and should be tracked for inclusion in the cost -effectiveness analysis. Because the intervention will be delivered 
during visits of normal length, we do not anticipate that PEDs will incur any other overhead costs (e.g., facilities) 
due to adoption of the intervention. It is possible that a final version of the SBIRT will require changes in CMS 
billing codes to accommodate payment for the service. It is premature to determine this now, and establishment 
of the evidence -base of the intervention is required t o provide a justification for a full review of coding options. 
As we conduct the cost analysis, we will conduct a preliminary review of coding options in anticipation of 
continued empi[INVESTIGATOR_217516].  
Procedures for Secondary Aim 2.   If successful, u sing the findings from this project and our prior research, we 
will develop a manual of operations that will enable other PEDs and EDs to adapt and implement the intervention 
in their setting. Using the CEA SE program as a model,55 this manual of operations will include step -by-step 
guides with tips and techniques for successful implementation of the intervention. This information will include 
how to obtain buy -in of policy/decision makers, clinicians, and an cillary staff members, and how to gather 
information from clinicians and staff on adapting the intervention for use in their site (e.g., taking into account 
differences in PED patient flow, patient acuity, PED operations, and PED staffing). The manual of o perations will 
also include all provider training materials and intervention guides (e.g., screening for tobacco use, brief intake 
assessments, instructions on how to give the 3As, motivational interviewing tips, referral resources, and 
cessation medicatio n prescribing). In addition, we will provide a comprehensive package of patient materials 
refined during the trial, such as fact sheets (e.g., health effects of SHSe, how to implement a home smoking ban) 
and cessation referral resources. Finally, we will i nclude all assessments to allow local evaluation of program 
results.    
Analysis for Secondary Aim 3.   For the analysis of the CSE study aim, we will calculate descriptive statistics 
including means, confidence intervals, medians, and interquartile ranges of reported and biochemically 
measured CSE and SHSe.  Logarithmical transformation of the biomarkers may be performed to control for 
nonnormality and unequal variances.  We plan to perform a series of logistic or linear regression mode ls (as 
appropriate) to assess the associations between reported and biochemically measured CSE and SHSe and 
child sociodemographics and other characteristics, and household smoking behavior.  We will fit linear and 
logistic regression models (as appropriat e) to examine the effect reported and biochemically measured CSE 
and SHSe has on health effects and healthcare utilization.  We will also assess correlations of child SHSe and 
CSE.  We will consider using other appropriate models based on the nature of the  data (e.g., fixed effects 
models, Poisson regression).  
Analysis for Exploratory Aim. For our primary goals, we will detect genomic features that distinguish TSE by 
a 2-fold change with  P value < 0.05. For a clinical biomarker, it will be important that th ere is a large enough 
effect size to be useful in a clinical setting; thus, our pi[INVESTIGATOR_217517]. In addition to our genome -wide analysis, we will 
especial ly focus on those loci with significance in previous studies of TSE. Principal component analysis and 
unsupervised hierarchical clustering will be used to statistically distinguish patients and controls as assessed 
by a subsequent ROC analysis. Pathway ana lysis will be performed to identify groups of genes with similar 
functions or that act in the same biological pathway. We will also specifically evaluate changes in genes found 
to be altered in previous studies.  
 
 
CONFIDENTIALITY/SECURITY  
     All measures will be taken to ensure patient confidentiality. All information will be used for scientific 
purposes only. Only the primary investigator, co -investigator s, and trained study staff will have direct access to

meeting would be devoted to reviewing study protocols, including plans for human subjects, and determining the 
frequency and content of interim data analyses (if warranted). Subsequent meetings would occur as determined 
by [CONTACT_217580], but will occur at least annu ally. During these subsequent meetings, the DSMB 
will evaluate various aspects of the trial, including progress, data quality, recruitment, etc. The DSMB, together 
with the IRB, will review the rates of adverse events and serious adverse events and provide  recommendations 
to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_217518]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_217519] a result of 
the DSMB finding.  
Frequency of DSM Reviews   
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_217520] -going basis, 
implementing the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP), and complying with the reporting requirements. The 
IRB or DSM Board may request more frequent reviews (based on reported Adverse Events or Serious Adverse  
Events or for other reasons), with which [CONTACT_217587] -Gittens will comply.  
Collection and Reporting of AEs and SAEs  
For purposes of monitoring and reporting adverse events, the following NIH definitions will be used: “Adverse                          
event  (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence that may present itself during treatment or administration of an 
intervention, and which may or may not have a causal relationship with the treatment.” “Serious adverse event 
(SAE): Any medical occurrence that results  in death; is life -threatening; requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8448]; creates persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defects.”  
We do NOT anticipate any SAEs to be reported as  a result of participation in this study. If a subject experiences 
any AEs/SAEs as a result of this study, all study staff will be trained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_217521] -free phone number to contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_217522] [ADDRESS_261015] report the event to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours of 
notification. Patients may report AEs or SAEs directly to CCHMC via a local phone number available in their  
copy of the consent form.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_217523]/SAEs to the CCHMC IRB within 24 hours of receipt of report from any source.   AEs 
and SAEs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_4158]/or the DSMB in a timely manner (depending on the severity of the 
event). All AEs and SAEs will be reported to NIH at a minimum in the annual progress report, or within 24 
hours depending on the severity of the event.  
Reporting Mechanisms of AEs/SAEs to the IRB, FDA, and NIH  
All study CRCs will be trained to report any adverse event  regarding patients enrolled in the study. These 
events would include severe withdrawal symptoms, reaction to use of nicotine replacement products, severe 
illnesses or death (from any cause).

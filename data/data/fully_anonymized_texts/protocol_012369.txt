resolved with prior IUD before insertion of Veracept.  It is however suggested the 
subject have a return of menses if she had amenorrhea prior to placement.  
  STATISTICAL METHODS  
 Effectiveness Outcome  
 The primary efficacy population will include all subjects aged 18- [ADDRESS_347909] occurred during  study device use 
(determined by [CONTACT_284950]), for w hich the estimated date of 
conception was within 7 days after study device removal or calculated date of expulsion,  will be included in the per protocol analysis of pregnancies.    
 The Pearl Index (and 95% confidence intervals) will be calculated through 12 months 
for cycles in subjects aged 18- 35 at the time of study device placement, excluding the 
following  cycles (unless the subject became pregnant in the cycle): 
• When  back -up contracepti ve or emergency contracepti ve use was documented on 
the daily diary   
• When the subject denied having any  intercourse.   
All pregnancies will be counted in the intent to treat analysis.  
 Life table analyses will be used as further assessment of pregnancies. Secondarily the Pearl index and life table analyses will be done through 3 years.   
  
Safety and Other Outcome Measures  
 
VeraCept  ease of placement , removal  and placement  success will be descriptively 
summarized.

Phase II Feasibility Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP)  
 
 
CMDOC- 0008 Version 5 .0 / 19 September 2017   Confidential    Page 11 of 44 Safety evaluations will be based on the incidence of adverse events  and serious 
adverse events  changes from baseline in other assessments (examinations and vital 
signs) and by [CONTACT_284951].   
Study device tolerability will be based on changes in bleeding and spotting patterns and 
study discontinuation (including reasons for discontinuation).  
Safety analyses will be bas ed on the experience of  all subjects who had attempted 
study device placement  and provided any relevant data.  Tolerability analyses will be 
based on the experience of all subjects who received a study device and provided any 
relevant data.  
 
Subjects will record frequency and intensity of vaginal bleeding through a daily diary.  
The number of bleeding or spotting days will be summarized for each cycle.  In addition, bleeding and spotting will each be summarized separately.  Bleeding analyses will 
include all subjects who had a study device placed and have at least [ADDRESS_347910] deviation, minimum, and maximum. For qualitative (categorical) variables the summaries will include the number and percentage of subjects in each 
category.   
 
SAMPLE SIZE  
 No formal sample size calculations were performed for the study.  It is estimated  that 
with 225 subjects enrolled with age 18- 35, a 12 -month P earl Index of 0.6 (1 observed 
pregnancy), and 2, 015 evaluable cycles, we will observe a 95% confidence interval for 
the 12 month P earl Index of (0.1, 3.3).   
 2,015 evaluable cycles assumes that in the overall study : 
• Each subject will  average10 evaluable cycles of VeraCept  use 
• 1% of subjects will not pr ovide any diary data and will be excluded from the 
primary efficacy population 
• Subjects will not have intercourse or will use backup contraception in 9.2 % of 
cycles

CMDOC- 0008 Version 5 .0 / 19 September 2017   Confidential    Page 14 of 44 1. INTRODUCTION 
The VeraCept  Intrauterine  Copper Contraceptive is designed as a birth control  device. 
There are over 62 million US women in their child- bearing years, ages 15 to 44. Thirty  
eight million (38M) use some form of contraception (62%). Thirty -one (31%) percent do 
not use or need contraception because they are either trying to get pregnant, are 
pregnant, are infertile or are not sexually active. Seven (7%) percent are at risk for 
unintended pregnancy since they are using no method1. 
Contraceptive options for those 38 million US women include permanent sterilization 
(tubal ligation or vasectomy  in male partner), contraceptive implants, intrauterine 
devices, injections, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], patches, vaginal rings, male and female condoms, other female barrier methods, vaginal spermicides, and behavioral methods such as coitus 
interruptus and fertility awareness. Of all these methods, oral contraceptives are used 
by 30% of sexually active women. The more effective methods, such as intrauterine 
contraceptives, are used by [CONTACT_143407] 10% of women.
[ADDRESS_347912] -effectiveness. The early rates of user dissatisfaction due to 
complications or  side effects may be associated with the materials used in these 
devices and/or their design. The Copper T380A IUD has been associated with complaints of increased bleeding, inter -menstrual bleeding and crampi[INVESTIGATOR_284933]. The 
LNG-IUS (Mirena®) is also associated with early complaints of irregular bleeding 
patterns, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_284934].  First year discontinuation rates for 
Copper IUDs in most studies range from 4- 15%.
5,6,7  
With high unintended pregnancy rates in the U.S. (49%)1, additional effective, safe and 
long-acting reversible contraceptives are needed. An intrauterine device with low -dose 
copper that achieves high contraceptive effectiveness, minimizes side effects and has improved mechanical advantages could offer an attractive option to women seeking 
effective protection against unintended pregnancy.  We believe the VeraCept 
Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive embodies these advantages.  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_284935]  
 A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_284936] a population of 
parous women enrolled at a single site demonstrated the safe use of the study  device in

CMDOC- 0008 Version 5 .0 / 19 September 2017   Confidential    Page 15 of 44 approximately 463 subjects total in two phases of the study, representing approximately 
6,706 combined women- months (558 women- years) of experience.  
 
In this time period, there were no serious adverse events due to the study device or its 
placement. Discontinuation rate due to tolerability was low. There have been no intrauterine pregnancies over the course of the study to date, and one serious adverse 
event (an ectopic pregnancy ) early in the Phase I portion of the study. 
 
VeraCept was successfully placed in all enrolled subjects with no peri -procedural 
adverse events and without the use of anesthetics, pre- medication or mechanical 
dilatation.  The VeraCept Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive, in this initial experience, 
satisfied the objectives of providing a safe, easy to place, conformable low -dose copper 
contraceptive that is highly tolerated.  
In the Phase II Confirmation portion of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116], the Subject Continuation Rate is 
90% at 10 months, with only 2% expulsion rate and 3% discontinuation for tolerability.  
The remaining 5% discontinued due to other reasons (e.g. the desire to get pregnant or 
inability to comply with study follow -up requirements.)   
Comparative Study of the VeraCept Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive 
 Subsequent to the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116], a 2:[ADDRESS_347915]- related 
outcomes such as improved tolerability, reduced expulsions and reduced pain- at-
insertion.  
 
 
VeraCept was successfully placed in 99.5% of all subjects to whom the study device 
was randomly assigned, with no peri- procedural adverse events, and without the use of 
anesthetics, pre- medication or mechanical dilatation. No new or unanticipated adverse 
events were introduced. Statistically significant improvements  (95% CI)  in Subject 
Continuation Rate, Tolerability, Study D evice Expulsion and Pain at Insertion were all 
demonstrated when compared to the control intrauterine device.  
 In this experience to date, VeraCept satisfied the objectives of providing a safe, easy to 
place, conformable low -dose intrauterine copper contraceptive without sacrificing safety 
or effectiveness. Study completion to 12 months and, subsequently, a larger multicenter study is warranted.  
 
This Phase II Clinical Study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness, study device

4.  STUDY TREATMENTS  
 
After the risks and benefits of study participation have been explained to the candidate, 
her questions have been answered, she has signed a written consent  and PHI form , 
and eligibility has been established, a subject identification number will be assigned by 
[CONTACT_284952].  If subject has a current IUD that is being removed; if 
subject had monthly menses, you do not need to wait any amount of time between removal of her first IUD and placement  of VeraCept – however, if pain is present you 
should wait until pain has resolved with prior IUD before insertion of Veracept.  It is however suggested the subject have a return of menses if she had amenorrhea prior to 
placement.

 14. CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
Concomitant medications include any medication or health product (any prescription 
medications or over -the-counter preparations) taken from the time the subject signs the 
informed consent documents until Study Exit  and must be recorded appropri ately on the 
eCRF .   
15. ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
During the study, the Investigator or study site personnel will be responsible for 
querying and recording adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), as detailed below. Subjects will also be required to record AEs on their daily diary. For the  
Sponsor to fulfill safety assessment obligations , the Investigator must report  all SAEs  to 
the Study Sponsor , whether or not they result from study participation, within 24 hours 
of learning of the event.  
15.1 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event occurring within the 
timelines specified in the protocol that results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death;  
• Life- threatening situation (subject is at immediate risk of death);  
ContraMed, LLC VeraCept Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive  
Phase II Feasibility Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP)  
 
 
CMDOC- 0008 Version 5 .0 / 19 September 2017   Confidential    Page 32 of 44 • Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who 
received study device; or  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered an SAE 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize 
the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of serious adverse 
events  include, but are not limited to: intensive treatment in an 
emergency room , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120264], and extensive treatment 
at home for an adverse event.  An ectopic pregnancy is considered a 
serious adverse event.  
 
15.[ADDRESS_347936] a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can, therefore, be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (that could include a clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with 
the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.  
 
• Any medical condition or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an 
onset date before the first date of attempted study device placement  is usually 
considered to be pre -existing, and should not be documented in the e CRF as an 
AE, unless there is an increase in frequency or intensity of that AE, but should 
be recorded as medical history.  
 • Any AE (i.e., a new event or an exacerbation of a pre -existing condition) with 
an onset from the first attempt of study device placement  through Study Exit  
should be recorded as an AE on the e CRF. All AEs must be recorded on the AE 
eCRF regardless of the severity or relationship to study device. It is important 
that Investigators also report all AEs that result in expulsion or removal of the 
investigational product being studied, whether serious or non- serious.  
 Pregnancy is an outcome, and not an adverse event in this study. 
15.3 Causality: Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Event Relationship to 
Study Treatment  
 
The Investigator will assess the relationship of the SAE and AE to  study device 
placement procedure (procedure) or  study device  by [CONTACT_284964]:  
 
Not Related: A causal relationship between the study device  and the AE can be 
ruled out (e.g., based on the temporal sequence, absence of a reasonable pathophysiological mechanism, or direct evidence of actual cause).  
 
ContraMed, LLC VeraCept Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive  
Phase II Feasibility Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP)  
 
 
CMDOC- 0008 Version 5 .0 / 19 September 2017   Confidential    Page 33 of 44 Unlikely related : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
temporal relationship to procedure or study device initiation which makes a 
causal relationship improbable, and in which other drugs, chemicals or 
underlying disease provide plausible explanations.  
 Probably Related: A cl inical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
reasonable time sequence to  first attempt of  study device placement , unlikely to 
be explained by [CONTACT_9153].  Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
 Related: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
reasonable time sequence to first attempt of study device placement, cannot be attributed to concurrent disease or other medical devices, drugs , or chemicals, 
and which follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal.  
 
15.3.[ADDRESS_347937] event that occurs from the beginning of the study device placement procedure until completion of placement, or from the 
beginning of the removal procedure until the completion of removal, will 
be reported as an AE. The AE should be recorded on the AE e CRF with 
a causality assessment of “related to study device placement 
procedure.” If the AE also meets the criteria for an SAE,  an SAE e CRF 
should be completed and submitted to Sponsor. 
 
15.4 Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Event Severity  
 
The Investigator will assess the severity of the AE using the following general 
guidelines:  
 
• Mild: An AE that is usually transient, requiring no special treatment, 
and does not interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
 • Moderate: An AE that introduces a low level of inconvenience or 
concern to the subject and may interfere with daily activities, but is usually ameliorated by [CONTACT_14212].  
 
• Severe: An AE that interrupts a subject’s usually daily activity and 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_40762] (a severe AE may not necessarily qualify as a n SAE).  
 
• Life-threatening: An AE that put the subject at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred. This does not include an event that might have led to death if it had occurred with greater severity.  
15.5 Adverse Event Outcome  
 The Investigator will categorize the outcome of each SAE and  AE according to 
the definitions below:  
ContraMed, LLC VeraCept Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive  
Phase II Feasibility Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP)  
 
 
CMDOC- 0008 Version 5 .0 / 19 September 2017   Confidential    Page 34 of 44  
• Resolved: The subject recovered from the SAE or AE. 
 
• Resolved with sequelae: a condition whereby [CONTACT_40770] a 
disease or injury include lingering effects.  
 
• Ongoing: At the time of the last assessment, the event is ongoing, with 
an undetermined outcome. Note: Ongoing SAEs and AEs are not 
considered resolved as a result of death and no SAE or AE stop date should be recorded for an AE that is ongoing at the time of death. 
 
• Fatal: Adverse Event directly caused death. The Sponsor may request 
that the Investigator perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations. If a subject dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up period, the Sponsor should 
be provided with a copy of any post -mortem findings, including 
histopathology.   Note: Death is an outcome  of an adverse event and not 
an adverse event in itself. All reports of subject death should include an adverse event term (other than “Death”) for the cause of the death.  
 
Since reporting of an SAE is required within 24 hours of discovery, Death can be reported as an initial event term and updated to the final diagnosis in a follow -up 
report. If an adverse event term is not provided, the Investigator will be queried to obtain the cause of death. Only in the rare occurrence that no verbatim description of an adverse event can be obtained from the investigative site will 
“Death – Unknown Cause” be used as the event term. 
 The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on 
the signs, symptoms and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE (and SAE if serious) and not the 
individual signs/symptoms.  
 In the case of abnormal labs or diagnostic tests judged to be clinically significant 
by [CONTACT_737]  a diagnosis, if known, or clinical signs or symptoms if the 
diagnosis is unknown, rather than the clinically significant laboratory finding or abnormal  assessment, should be used to complete the AE  or SAE eCRF. If no 
diagnosis is known and clinical signs or symptoms are not present, then the 
abnormal finding should be recorded on the AE  or SAE eCRF. If an SAE report 
is completed, pertinent laboratory data should be recorded on the SAE e CRF, 
preferably with baseline values and copi[INVESTIGATOR_284944].  
15.[ADDRESS_347938] be 
notified within 24 hours of discovery and the Investigator determines that an 
adverse event meets the prot ocol definition of an SAE.  
 All SAEs occurring from the beginning of study  entry  through study exit require 
immediate  reporting to the Sponsor. Investigators should not wait to receive 
additional information to fully document the event prior to notifying the Sponsor 
ContraMed, LLC VeraCept Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive  
Phase II Feasibility Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP)  
 
 
CMDOC- 0008 Version 5 .0 / 19 September 2017   Confidential    Page 35 of 44 but should provide as much relevant information as immediately available. 
Further details of the event can be provided as they become available. The procedures for reporting SAEs are as follows:  
 
• Complete the “Serious Adverse Event Report” form ; 
 • Submit the completed form to Sponsor;  
 
• For fatal or life- threatening events, also submit copi[INVESTIGATOR_5913], autopsy reports, and other documents when requested and applicable;  
 • The Sponsor may request additional information from the Investigator 
to ensure the timely completion of accurate safety reports;  
 
• Any fatal or life -threatening events should also be reported immediately 
by [CONTACT_284965];  
 
• The SAE e CRF should be completed as thoroughly as possible and 
signed by [CONTACT_284966]. It is very 
important that the Investigator provides an assessment of the causal 
relationship between the event and the study  device at the time of the 
initial report ; and 
 • The Investigator, or responsible person according to local 
requirements, must comply with the applicable local regulatory 
requirements concerning the reporting of SAEs to regulatory authorities 
and the IRB.  
15.7 Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments 
as Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
 
Abnormal laboratory findings (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology) or other 
abnormal assessments (e.g., electrocardiogram, X -rays, vital signs) per se are 
not reported as AEs.  However, abnormal findings that are deemed clinically 
significant (i.e., associated with signs and/or symptoms or requiring therapeutic 
intervention) must be recorded as AEs if they meet the definition of an adverse 
event (and recorded as an SAE if they meet the criteria of being serious) as 
described previously. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other 
abnormal f indings that are detected after study  device  placement or  that are 
present at baseline and worsen following the placement of VeraCept are 
included as AEs ( or SAEs if serious).  
 The Investigator should exercise his or her medical judgment in deciding 
whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is 
clinically significant. A clinically significant laboratory abnormality in the absence of clinical symptoms may also jeopardize the subject and may require 
intervention to prevent immediate consequences (e.g., a markedly high serum 
potassium concentration may not be accompanied by [CONTACT_284967], yet be of a 
magnitude to require potassium -binding resin administration to prevent such

abnormal laboratory findings as soon as they are recognized.  
15.[ADDRESS_347939]’s study records and on 
the AE e CRF. SAEs that occur during the study must be documented in the 
subject’s study record, on the AE e CRF and on the SAE e CRF as appropriate. 
 
The investigator’s assessment of causality, severity and status of the adverse 
event must be documented. When a causality assessment is provided for a 
serious adverse event, it is important to include a rationale for the assessment so that a better understanding of the reported event can be compi[INVESTIGATOR_42602]. The rationale should be accompanied by [CONTACT_209789], including 
relevant laboratory tests, histopathology evaluations and the results of other 
diagnostic procedures. The Investigator’s rationale with supporting evidence is 
valuable when Sponsor performs a cumulative analysis of similar events.  
15.[ADDRESS_347940] to follow -up 
(including withdrawal of consent), whichever occurs first . The Investigator is 
responsible to ensure that follow -up includes any supplemental investigations as 
may be indicated to elucidate as completely as practical the nature and/or 
causality of the AE/SAE. This may include additional laboratory tests or 
investigations, histopathologic examinations, or consultation with other health 
care professionals. Follow -up information should be submitted to the Sponsor in 
a timely many as the information is obtained.  
15.[ADDRESS_347941] deaths (regardless of relationship to study device) should be reported 
that occur from the beginning of study device placement through Study Exit . The 
information should be recorded on the Subject Death form and the SAE e CRF. 
15.[ADDRESS_347942] has had the study device removed, and such 
event seems reasonably related to study drug, the Investigator should 
immediately  notify the Sponsor.  
15.12 Study Device Malfunction  
Should the study device not  perform mechanically as expected, it is essential that 
it be returned to the study Sponsor for assessment.

Phase II Feasibility Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP)  
 
 
CMDOC- 0008 Version 5 .0 / [ADDRESS_347943] the health and safety of the 
subjec t will be reported to the IRB  and as required by [CONTACT_427].  All 
protocol violations or deviations will be recorded on the case report forms 
(eCRFs). A protocol violation or deviation may be requested in advance of 
implementation and will be reviewed for approval  by [CONTACT_284968], 
or a violations/ deviation may be identified after the fact, by [CONTACT_737], 
ContraMed,  or the monitoring staff.  Investigators will  be asked to provide an 
explanation for the all violations and deviations identified. ContraMed, or 
designee, will be responsible for analyzing deviations and may implement 
corrective actions as necessary.    
 
17. SUBJECT CONFIDENTIALITY  
At all times throughout this study, all parties shall strictly observe the confidentiality of 
subject’s health information.  All data shall be secured against unauthorized access.  
Each subject participating in this study will have consented to allow access to her data, as described during the informed consent process and document ed in the signed 
informed consent form.  Each subject will also sign an Authorization For Release of Protected Health Information (PHI) form granting ContraMed and its designees ac cess 
to her medical records, should she receive medical care from non- study sites where 
she gets care (e.g., emergency room, urgent care, etc.) .Each subject will be assigned a 
unique identifier.  All e CRFs will be tracked, evaluated, and stored using only this 
unique identifier.   HIPAA guidelines and regulations will be followed.  
 
The Investigator will maintain a confidential study subject list identifying all enrolled 
subjects. This list will contain the assigned study subject’s unique identifier and name .  
The Investigator bears responsibility for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_147345].  This list will not be 
provided to the study Sponsor and is only to be used at the study center.  
 Monitors and auditors will have access to the study subject list and other personally 
identifying information of study subjects to ensure that data reported in the eCRFs 
corresponds to the person who signed the consent form and the information contained 
in the original source documents.  Such personal identifying information may include, 
but not limited to, the subject’s name, address, date of birth, gender, race and medical 
record number.  
 In an effort to protect subject confidentiality , any source documents copi[INVESTIGATOR_284945]’s 
assigned unique identifier and personal identifying data  will be obscured . 
 
18. PREGNANCY DETERMINATION AND FOLLOW UP  
Suspected pregnancy will be confirmed with a urine pregnancy test.  A positive 
urine test will be confirmed by a serum test.  Pregnancies will be promptly

CMDOC- 0008 Version 5 .0 / [ADDRESS_347944] consent  
(note: removal itself may be performed by [CONTACT_213989], such as a nurse practitioner).  Consideration of study device removal should include the following 
standard of care criteria: If the subject  has an intrauterine pregnancy in the first 
trimester and the study device is seen to be in the uterine cavity or cervix on 
ultrasound, remove the s tudy device if the retrieval threads are visible. If the 
retrieval threads are not accessible , the IUD should remain in the uterus until 
delivery (abortion or term) .  
Subjects will be counseled and followed through completion of pregnancy, and the clinical  outcome will be recorded.

plan or regulations.   See monitoring plan for full details.  
19.2 Electronic Case Report Forms ( eCRF) 
Electronic case report forms ( eCRFs) will be used to collect all subject data 
during the study  
 
The Investigator is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all data on 
the eCRFs.  
 Sponsor personnel or designee will review completed e CRFs at regular intervals 
throughout the study. Information on the eCRFs will be compared to  information 
originally recorded on source documents related to the study.  Information on the eCRF must match the same information on the source documents or a data 
query will be issued.   
 
The Sponsor will use the study data for statistical and tracking purposes and will treat the information as confidential.

Practice (GCP), and the Declaration of Helsinki.  
 The Investigator(s) shall be responsible for the day -to-day conduct of the 
investigation as well as for the safety and well- being of the human subjects involved 
in the clinical investigation.  The Investigator(s) shall:  
 
a) Have the resources to conduct the investigation properly  
b) Ensure that conducting the investigation will not give rise to a conflict of 
interest  
c) Obtain from the Sponsor the information which the Investigator(s) judges 
essential about the study device and be familiar with this information  
d) Be well acquainted with the protocol before signing it  
e) Support the monitor  and/or auditor, if applicable, in their activities to verify

compresses and lid hygiene since the previous visit  
2. Pre-treatment biomicroscopy with the slit lamp (observation of lid margins, 
eyelashes, conjunctiva ) 
3. In the study arm : 
Active IPL administered on the malar region (from tragus to tragus, below the lower 
eyelids, including the nose)  
In the control arm : 
Sham IPL administered on the same facial areas  
4. Meibomian gland expression (MGX) of the upper and lower eyelids in both eyes   
5. Post-treatment biomicroscopy  with the slit lamp

Safety outcome 
measures   incidence of non -ocular adverse events throughout the study  
 incidence of ocular adverse events throughout the study  
 incidence of unanticipated serious adverse events  throughout the study  
 self-assessment of pain/discomfort of IPL in treatment sessions  (using a VAS) 
 self-assessment of pain/discomfort of MGX in treatment sessions (using a VAS) 
Covariates   Baseline TBUT (continuous)  
 Baseline skin rosacea (4-point scale)  
Sample Size  The following assumptions were used to calculate the original sample size:  
(1) In the study arm, the change of TBUT from BL to FU  5  5 sec 
(2) In the control arm, the change of TBUT from BL to FU  1  5 sec 
(3) A type I error of 0.05 (two -tailed test)  
(4) A type II error of 0.2 (power = 0.8)  
(5) A 1:1 ratio of Treatment to Control  
 
With these assumptions, the minimal sample size was calculated to be  50 evaluable subjects  (100 
evaluable eyes): 25 subjects (50 eyes) in the control arm and 25 subjects (50 eyes) in the study 
arm.  
Assuming a dropout rate of 15%, the anticipated number of enrolled subjects was 59. Assuming a 
screening failure rate of 15%, the anticipated total  number of screened subjects was 69.

After study  initiation (but before any data were unmasked) it was found that [ADDRESS_354234]  patients at one 
site were not treated in accordance with the protocol .  Accordingly,  patients were added  to the 
study  to restore the original power and to allow comparison before/after corrective actions were 
taken.  The final sample size is 83 evaluable subjects (166 evaluable eyes).Based on an updated 
dropout rate of 7%, the  anticipated number of enrolled subjects is 89. Ba sed on an updated 
screening rate of 23%,  the anticipated number of screened subjects is 116.

1. Introduction  
1.1. Background  
1.1.1.  Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD): prevalence and current management  
Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is one of the most frequent diseases observed in 
ophthalmology. It is considered the major cause of evaporative dry eye disease (DED) [1, 2] , a 
condition which severely affects the qua lity of life  [3]. Symptoms include burning, itching, pain, 
redness, blurry vision and decrease in visual acuity. It is estimated that, in the US alone, over 40 
million individuals are affected by [CONTACT_2403] [4]. More than two -thirds of DED cases are caused by [CONTACT_290422]  
[5]. 
In normal healthy eyes, moisture of the ocular surface is maintained and stabilized by [CONTACT_290423], a thin multilayer structure comprising: an inner layer of muc in (a protein produced by [CONTACT_290424][INVESTIGATOR_290387]); a middle layer of aqueous substance (generated by [CONTACT_290425]); and an external layer of olive -oil like liquid (the meibum, secreted by [CONTACT_290426]). Abnormal quality or quan tity of the meibum may lead to evaporation of the 
tear film.  
The meibomian glands (MGs) consists of a few dozens of glands located at the base of the eyelid 
margins. In MGD, the glands narrow and the viscosity of the meibum increases, often due to 
inflammatory processes near the ocular surface. As a result, the meib um outflow is severely 
reduced, leading to evaporation of the tear film. This, in turn, leads to further inflammation of the 
ocular surface, further obstruction of the MGs, more reduction of the meibum outflow and more 
evaporation of the tear film.  
1.1.2.  Prefer red practice pattern  for management  of MGD 
Currently, there is no accepted standard of care for MGD. The preferred practice pattern for 
management of MGD includes dietary modifications, ocular lubricants with lipid -containing 
supplements , lid hygiene, warm  compresses, intra -ductal probing, debridement scaling, and 
meibomian gland expression  (MGX)  [6, 7] .  The effects of these methods is temporal and limited, as 
they mostly address symptoms and not the underlying cause.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_290388] -inflammatory drugs may also be useful.  
In the current study we will examine the effect of IPL followed by [CONTACT_290427]. In MGX, meibomian glands 
are squeezed ( by [CONTACT_290428] a specially 
designed forceps , Q-tips, or fingers ) in order to unclog obstructed glands and evacua te their content 
(the meibum) , which in MGD  is often viscous and thus c ausing obstruction. A limitation of this 
method is the discom fort experienced by [CONTACT_102], especially when the meibum is  viscous and not 
liquid as should be in healthy glands.

1.1.3.  Use of intense pulsed light (IPL) for treatment of rosacea  
Pulsed dye laser is a well -established method for treatment of benign vascul ar lesions such as 
rosacea. However, one limitation of this method is that most energy is deposited in the superficial 
vessels. Thus, clinical success is highly dependent on vessel depth, diameter and wall thickness.  
Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) treatment r elies on the principle of selective photothermolysis, in which 
thermal damage is limited to specific targets at the cellular level. In the case of skin conditions such 
as erythema of rosacea or acne, this target is the oxyhemoglobin within blood cells, whi ch circulate 
in capi[INVESTIGATOR_290389]. In contrast with pulsed dye laser, IPL has a wider 
wavelength range, a variable pulse duration and multiple split light pulses. These characteristics 
cause an additive heating, leading to coagulatio n of vessels of different diameters and depths. 
Delays between pulses allows the epi[INVESTIGATOR_290390].  
The first IPL device for treatment of lower extremity telangiectasias received FDA approval in 1995. 
Since then, the use of IPL was FDA -approved for dozens of indications in dermatology  [8]. 
A first report of IPL for treating facial dermatological conditions dates from 1996, when it was 
utilized to successfully treat 80 subjects with treatment resistant facial port wine stains  [9].  Later 
that year, a small study of [ADDRESS_354241] -treatment side effects such as purpura and 
changes in pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], which are common after laser therapy  [10].  A larger study of 200 
subjects wi th various facial vascular lesions (facial veins, telangiectasias, facial hemangiomas, 
rosacea and port wine stains) demonstrated that IPL is an effective and safe alternative to laser 
treatment  [11]. These results were later s upported with a study of 1,000 consecutive subjects with 
facial telangiectasias [12]. In this retrospective study, 90% of the subjects experienced a clearance 
of 75% to 100%. Adverse side effects were minimal, involving only ab out 7% of the treatments.  
1.1.4.  Clinical evidences for the effectiveness of IPL in the treatment of MGD  
In 2002, Toyos and colleagues observed that rosacea subjects treated with IPL showed 
improvement in symptoms of dry eye disease  [13]. They hypothesized that IPL application to the 
malar region and nose closes the abnormal telangiectasias, thus decreasing the secretion of 
inflammatory substances and improving the function of meibomian glands.  
Since this discovery in 2002, Toyos and h is colleagues used IPL off -label to treat hundreds of 
rosacea subjects presenting with dry eye disease  [14, 15] . A case report from [ADDRESS_354242] technology for treatment of dry eye disease (DE D) [16]. Prior to the IPL 
sessions, the subject reported unbearable dry eye symptoms that were unresponsive to other lines 
of therapy (artificial tears, punctal plugs, cyclosporine, etc.). After [ADDRESS_354243], 
there was a dramatic improvement in tear break -up time (TBUT) and in Schirmer’s test. A recent 
publication summarizes data collected from 78 subjects presenting with severe symptoms of dry 
eye. In this retrospective study, TBUT and subjective evaluat ion of dry eye symptoms with the OSDI 
questionnaire were improved in 87% and 93% of the subjects, respectively  [17]. The change in 
TBUT reflected a shift from severe to moderate dry eye.

studies demonstrated that the combination of IPL and MGX was able to improve both objective signs 
and subjective symptoms of DED secondary to MGD [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25] . Other studies 
showed that IPL alone, without meibomian expression, was effective as well: in [ADDRESS_354245] -treatment in the treated eye, but not in the control eye [26, 27] . These 
studies support the hypothesis that IPL has a genuine effect on MGD, rather  than merely a placebo 
effect.  
1.2. Rational e of the Study  
A number of recent prospective studies demonstrated that IPL treatment as monotherapy or in 
combination with MGX gave some relief to signs and symptoms of DED due to MGD.  In all of these 
studies , the main limitation was that the study was designed as a single arm trial .  Hence,  at least part 
of the relief observed in these studies  could result from a placebo effect . 
The aim of the current prospective study is to examine the contribution of the IPL treatment itself. For 
the first time, the effect of IPL will be examined in a  study designed as a blinded randomized controlled 
trial. Subjects in the study  arm will be treated with IPL followed by [CONTACT_290427] , while subjects in the control 
arm will be treated with sham IPL followed by [CONTACT_290427] . A significant difference in the outcomes of the two 
arms will provide support for a genuine contribution  of the IPL treatment.  In addition, it is expected 
that subjects in the study arm might feel less pain during MGX, as the heat transferred from the site of 
IPL administration to the meibomian glands may liquefy the meibum thus facilitating expression.

 An additional filter was specifically designed for the purpose of this study , to implement a 
sham treatment with the M22-OPT (not available commercially). This filter  completely 
blocks all wavelengths emitted by [CONTACT_290430] . Hereafter , this filter is referred to 
as the “ filter”.  
In this study, 3 types of filters are used:  
(1) the 560 nm  or the 590 nm  filter, for subjects the study arm  
(2) the  filter, for any subject in the control arm.  
2.1.4.  Lightguides  
In the M22-OPT, IPL pulses  are emitted perpendicular to the light bulb (located within the 
handpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]), through a SapphireCoolTM lightguide. Three  types of lightguides exist: a small round  
lightguide ( 6 mm in diameter), a small rectangular lightguide (8 mm x 15 mm = 1.2 cm2) and a 
large rectangular lightguide (15 mm X 35 mm = 5.25 cm2) (Figure 2). In this study, only the 
rectangular lightguides are used.

2.5.3.  Coupling gel  
The area to be treated will be coated with a thin (1 -2 mm) layer of transparent coupling gel . The 
coupling get will be provided by [CONTACT_1034] . 
2.5.4.  Eye protection  
During the entire duration of IPL administration , the subject must wear two types of eye protect ion: 
First, adhesive disposable eye patches (Honeywell, Derma Aid) will be positioned over the eyelids, to 
cover  the entire periocular area extending from the upper lid crease to the lower lid crease. On top 
of these, the subject will wear opaque goggles (OD ≥ 5).  
In addition, during IPL administration physicians and staff  present in the room must wear protective 
eyewear with OD = 3.  
Eye protection goggles (for subjects) and glasses (for operators) will be provided by [CONTACT_1034].  
2.5.5.  Determination/confirmation of skin type  
Darker skin types react more strongly to the IPL administration. Hence, before setting the IPL 
settings it is imperative to determine /confirm the subject’s Fitzpatrick skin type, according to      
Table  1 [28].

2.5.6.  Settings and adjustment of  IPL parameters  
IPL parameters include fluence (range: 10 -32 J/cm2), number of sub -pulses (1 -3), pulse duration 
(range: 3-20 msec), delay or intra -pulse duration (range: 5 -150 msec), and a chiller option for 
cooling the lightguide tip. Note that for a single pulse, the minimal pulse duration is 4 msec, but for 
a double o r triple pulse, the minimal sub -pulse duration is 3 msec. Settings can be viewed and 
modified on a touch -screen monitor ( Figure 3).

malar region, as illustrated in Figure 4. For the first test spot of a subject, it is recommended to use 
the pre -defined IPL settings for the “Skin Treatments” (ST) application, with the Primary Condition  
set to “Rosacea/Telangiecta sia”, the Lesion Depth  set to “Shallow” and the Skin Type  set to the 
Fitzpatrick skin type. This action will select a set of pre -defined IPL settings (Fluence, pulse 
duration, pulse delay and filter) adequate for a subject with that skin type.

Table [ADDRESS_354250] settings , depending 
on the sensation of pain/discomfort, the immediate skin reaction, th e long -term skin reaction, and 
the efficiency of treatment .  
 
For the first IPL treatment, the IPL settings are based on the results of  the test spots. For the 1st 
test spot, it is advised to use the IPL settings recommended for treatment of shallow 
Rosacea/Telangiectasia (numbers in Table 2) and to examine the skin reaction after a few minutes.  
Upon decision of the study investigator, the IPL settings may be modified  according to the ranges 
specified  in Table 2. If the skin reaction  to the 1st test spot is excessive  (such as: a break in skin 
integrity, blistering, sloughing and/or discoloration or bruising), or if the IPL pulse is not well -
tolerated , it is recommended to gradually decrease  fluence, and/or gradually increase the delay 
Test spots can be repeated up to 5  times.

In the written Informed Consent F orm (ICF), the subjects will be advised that they have the right to 
withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice, and may be withdrawn at the 
Inves tigator’s/Lumenis’ discretion at any time. In the event that a subject drops out of the study or is 
withdrawn from the study, an Exit/Termination eCRF must be completed. On the withdrawal page the 
Investigator will record the date of the withdrawal, the person who initiated withdrawal and the reason 
for withdrawal.  
Reasonable effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_169659] -up during the course of the 
study , in order to complete assessments and retrieve a ny outstanding data and study 
medication/supplies. The records of subjects who terminate prior to completing the study will be 
retained and the reason for termination will be documented.  
The following are possible reasons for subject dropout/withdrawal:  
 Adverse event that would prevent subject compliance with the protocol;  
 Subject withdrawal of consent;  
 Subject lost to follow -up (e.g., subject cannot be located or contact[CONTACT_290434] -up visits);  
 Subject death;  
 Investigator/Lumenis reque sted subject to be withdrawn.  
Every effort will be made to follow the  subject for the remainder of the study , even if the subject was 
withdrawn from the study.

3.3.1.  Screening an d Baseline Assessments  
The study investigator or a designee will start an informed consent (IC) process. The study 
investigator or a designee will explain that only subjects who sign the IC form are allowed to 
participate in this study. In the IC process, t he subjects will be told that they have a 50% probability 
to be included in a study arm, and a 50% probability to be included in a control arm. Procedures in 
each of the arms will be explained to the subjects. The subject must understand that, after signing 
the IC form, further  tests will be  necessary to decide if he or she can continue in the study. The 
study investigator or a designee should clearly indicate that, even if the IC form is signed, the 
subject may not be allowed to participate in the study if the outcomes of some of the tests do not 
meet all inclusion and exclusion  criteria , or if the immediate skin reaction to  the test spots is not 
acceptable.  
Following signing the IC form , the subject will first self -evaluate his/her symptoms using two tools: 
(1) the  OSDI questionnaire ; (2) the EDS, using a visual analog  scale (0 -100 VAS) .  
The following assessments will be performed in both eyes by a masked examiner : 
 Three consecutive readings of TBUT  (before any other test)

3.5.2.   Success criterion   
The study will be determined as successful if it satisfies  two conditions : 
1. The differen ce in the change of TBUT , between eyes in the study arm and eyes in the 
control arm, is statistically significant at the = 0.05 level . 
2. The change  of TBUT  is higher  in eyes of the study arm, compared to eyes of the control 
arm 
, where the change  of TBUT is defined as TBUT at the follow -up minus TBUT at the baseline . 
3.5.3.   Secondary efficiency  endpoints  
 The difference in the change  of OSDI, between subjects in the study arm and subjects in 
the control arm   
 The difference in the change  of EDS, between subjects in the study arm and subjects in the 
control arm  
, where the change  of the variable ( OSDI or EDS) is defined as the value of the variable  at the 
follow -up minus the value of the variable at the baseline.  
3.5.4.   Exploratory efficiency  endpoints

 The difference in the incidence of unanticipated serious  adverse events, between subjects in 
the study  arm and subjects in the control arm  
 The difference in the level of pain/discomfort during IPL treatment, between subjects in the 
study arm and subjects in the control arm  
 The difference in the level of pain/discomfort during MGX, between subjects in the study arm 
and subjects in the control arm  
 The difference in the change of biomicroscopy immediately before and immediately after IPL 
treatmen t, between subjects in the study arm and subjects in the control arm  
3.6. Study duration  
 For an individual participant, from the screening  visit to the follow -up visit, the study duration is 
expected to  be between 10 -11 weeks (depending on whether  screening and  randomization/Tx1 
were performed on the same day , or up to 1 week later).  
 
 For the entire sample, f rom the screening  of the first subject to the follow -up of the last subject , 
the study duration is expected to be 75 weeks. This is based on the following assumptions: a 
final sample size of 83 subjects (166 evaluable eyes); 3-4 sites; a screening  rate of 1.5 subjects 
per week  per site ; a 23% rate of screening failures; and  a lost to follow -up rate of 7% ([ADDRESS_354260] s) 
 
 Enrollment will continue until at least [ADDRESS_354261] no signs of skin rosacea, even if 
89 subjects  were already enrolled to the study.  Hence, in principle study duration can extend 
beyond 75 weeks.

3.8. Concurrent Control  
Subjects will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_354266] a temporary redness 
of the skin . This said, the following steps will be taken :  
In the informed consent  process , subjects will be told that in some cases the IPL treatment might be 
felt as a mild pain/discomfort on the skin, and that the treatment can cause redness of the skin that 
should disappear within a few minutes .  During  IPL admi nistration, all subjects will wear protective 
goggles  that will completely occlude their vision .  
In the control arm, subjects will undergo a sham  treatment that will mimic the IPL (IPL) therapy . The 
sham treatment will be implemented using a filter that blocks all light emitted by [CONTACT_941] M22 -IPL (the  
filter described in section 2.1.3). The tip of the lightguide will still be cooled an d the device will still 
produce clicking sounds whenever the trigger button on the IPL handpi[INVESTIGATOR_290406], but no light will 
be actually transmitted to the skin . Following the sham IPL procedure, subjects will undergo meibomian 
gland expression.  
3.9. Blindi ng 
Every effort will be made  to ensure examiners measuring primary outcomes are masked to the 
treatment allocation. However, d ue to the nature of the IPL treatment, it is not possible to completely 
ensure masking of the examiner . The examiner that will assess the outcome measures at the baseline 
visit and at the follow -up visit will not be the study investigator  that will administer the IPL pulses . This 
will increase the probability that the examiner  is masked  to the allocation.  
3.10.   Interim analysis  
There will be no interim analysis in this study.  
4. Study Population and Subject Selection  
4.1. Source and Sample Size  
The aim of this study is to analyze up to 83 subjects  (166 eyes) who completed the full schedule , 
randomized 1:1 to a study arm and a control arm. It is estimated that 23% of the subjects will be 
screening failures, and that 7%% of the randomized subjects will drop out or will be lost to follow -up. 
Therefore, to reach up to 83 subjects (166 eyes) who will complete the study, 116 subjects are 
expected to  be screened  and  89 subjects are expected to be enrolled .

5.1.4.  Informed consent  
During the informed consent (IC) process with the subject, the study investigator will explain the 
purpose of the study, the possible risks and benefits, and the schedule of visits required for 
participation. The study investigator will explain to the subj ect that, after signing the IC form, the 
subject may not be found eligible to participate in the study if he/she doesn’t satisfy all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
The subject may take the IC form, consult with family, friends or doctor. After reading and 
understanding the IC, if the subject decides that he/she wishes to participate in the study, he/she 
should return within 1 week, with a signed IC form at which time he/she will undergo specific tests 
as specified below (sections 5.1.5 to 5.1.9). These tests will  be done only after the subject  signed 
the ICF, clearly indicating his/her understanding of the requirements and risks involved with study 
participation and other applicable treatment options.  
5.1.5.   Self-Assessment of Symptoms  
To reduce the risk of bias, symptoms will be self -evaluated by [CONTACT_290443] (TBUT, MGS, and close-up photos of the eyelids) are performed by [CONTACT_31821] (s).   
Self-assessment of symptoms will be performed using 2 different methods:  
(1) Ocular Surfa ce Disease Index (OSDI), u sing a questionnaire (developed by [CONTACT_78562] , Inc.) 
questionnaire. This questionnaire , which reports a single score for both eyes, is well -established 
for diagnosing symptoms of DED  [30].  
 The questionnaire will be filled -out by [CONTACT_423]  
 The subject will grade  12 questions related to:  ocular symptoms (3 questions), vision -
related function items (6 questions) and environmental triggers items (3 questions)  
 Each of the 12 items will be scored f rom 0 to 4, where 0 indicates “never” and 4 indicates 
“always”  
 The questionnaire should take 5 minutes to complete.  
 OSDI will be calculated as the sum of the answered scores times 25, divided by [CONTACT_290444]  (range: 0 to 100) . 
 Based on the OSDI, a subject can be categorized as having a normal ocular surface (0 -12 
points), mild symptoms (13 -22 points), moderate symptoms (23 -32 points), or severe 
symptoms (33 -100 points), as described in [30]. 
 OSDI at baseline is used for an inclusion criterion: to be included in the study, the subject  
must have OSDI ≥ 23 at baseline (moderate or seve re symptoms).

(2) Eye Dryness Score (EDS), u sing a VAS. This questionnaire , which reports a single score for both 
eyes, has been used in other dry eye studies and was recently used as the primary symptom 
endpoint for FDA approval of lifitegrast  for the treatment of signs and symptoms of dry eye  
(Xiidra , manufactured  by [CONTACT_290445] , Inc.).  EDS was accepted as a clinical outcome as sessment by 
[CONTACT_290446].gov  (NDA 208073, June 2015)  
 
 The subject will be shown a 10 cm line, and will be asked to mark an X sign along  the line  
 The subject will be instructed to mark the X sign on the leftmost side of the line if he/she 
does not have any symptoms of DED, on the rightmost side of the line if he/she has 
intolerable symptoms of DED, or somewhere along the line at a location that best represents 
his/her perception of symptoms in all other cases.  
 The distance between the left side of the line and the X mark will be measured.  EDS (0-100) 
will be calculated as this distance times 10.  
5.1.6.  Assessment of TBUT  
TBUT  will be me asured for each eye separately as follows:  
 A FUL -GLO® fluorescein sodium ophthalmic strip (0.6 mg) will be applied to the inferior tarsal 
conjunctiva  
 The subject will be asked to blink a few times to distribute t he dye over the ocular surface.  
 Once positioned at the slit lamp, t he subje ct will close his/her eye completely.  
 Then, the subject will be asked to open his/her eye without blinking.  
 The timer will start as soon as the subject will open his/her eye, and it will be stopped at the 
first sign of breakup ( first dark spot or discont inuity in the precorneal fluorescein -stained tear 
layer).  
 For each eye, 3 consecutive  readings  will be taken . 
 TBUT will be calculated  as the average of the se [ADDRESS_354273] TBUT ≤ 7 seconds  at baseline  (severity 
levels 2 -5, as described in [31]). The study eye will be the eye with the lower TBUT at baseline (if 
both eyes have the same TBUT at baseline, see section 1).   
5.1.7.  Routine ophthalmic examination  
Routine ophthalmic examination s will be performed separately for each eye, and will include: 
biomicroscopy with the slit lamp (examination of lid margins, meibomian gland orifices, eye lashes, 
conjunctiva, etc .), BCVA with an ETDRS chart, and IOP with tonometry.

 Each gland will be graded  as follows:  3 = clear liquid secretion, 2 = cloudy liquid secretion; 
1 = inspi[INVESTIGATOR_89057]/toothpaste consistency; 0 = no secretion.  
 Along the lower eyelid, 15 glands will be evaluated: 5 nasal, 5 central and 5 temporal.  
 MGS will be estimated as the sum of grades of these 15 glands  (range: 0 to 45) . 
The MGS score at baseline will be  used for an inclusion criterion: t o be included in the s tudy, the 
study eye  must have MG S ≤ 12 at baseline.   
5.1.9.  Close -up photos of the eyes 
Close-up photos of both eyes will be captured with a high -resolution camera (> 325 ppi). Image 
resolution should be high enough to see the lid margins, the iris and individual eye lashes  in focus .  
 
For best results, the camera should be used in “Macro” mode. For a simpler camera with no macro 
mode (for example , iPhone 7), position the camera at a distance of 30 -40 cm from the eye, and use 
the optic zoom to take a close -up photo. If a mobile phone camera is used, i t is advised to use a 
second mobile phone to provide illumination, rather th an rely on the flash capabilities of the camera.

5.1.12.  Randomization  
Upon enrolment  to the study, s ubjects will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_354277] treatment , followed by [CONTACT_290427]. 
5.2.1.  Pre-Treatment Procedures  
 Before treatment, the subject’s face must be thoroughly cleaned with a mild cleansing agent, 
like soap, facial wipes, or a medical grade alcohol diluted by 50%.  
 The area to be treated will be coated with a thin (1 -2 mm) layer of transparent coupling gel 
(provided by [CONTACT_290447]).  
 Both eyes of the subject must be completely occlu ded with protective goggles . The goggles 
must cover the entire per i-ocular region, including the upper and lower eyelids . 
 In all subjects , several  test spots (active IPL or sham  IPL, depending on the arm) will be given  in 
inconspi[INVESTIGATOR_290408], for example on the lateral aspect of the malar region. In 
subjects of the control arm, these sham spot tests will have no function other than to mimic the 
actual treatment. In subjects of the study arm, these test spots will be used  to determine the 
IPL settings.  
 For the first treatment session, the IPL settings fo r the 1st test spot may be set using the values 
recommended in Table 2 , or using less intensive settings at the discretion of the investigator(s). 
For subsequent treatment session, the IPL settings for the 1st test spot may be copi[INVESTIGATOR_290409] , unless the long -term skin reaction is not 
acceptable (including: a break in skin integrity, blistering, sloughing and/or discoloration or 
bruising ). In this latter case the intensity of IPL settings for the 1st test spot should be reduced 
with respect to IPL settings used in the previous IPL session, either by [CONTACT_290448], 
increasing the pulse duration, and/or increasing the delay.  
 After each test spot, the investigator will wait a few minutes and then will exam ine the 
immediate skin reaction. If the skin reaction is acceptable and as expected (pi[INVESTIGATOR_290410], which should gradually fade within a few minutes), the IPL treatment

itself can continue with these settings. If the skin reaction i s excessive (including: a break in skin 
integrity, blistering, sloughing and/or discoloration or bruising ), or if the subject complains of  
more than mild pain/discomfort , the intensity of the IPL will be reduced  either by [CONTACT_290449], increasing the pulse duration and/or increasing the delay.  Then, a new test spot will be 
performed.   
 Up to [ADDRESS_354278] spots is not 
acceptable (including: a break in skin integrity, blistering, sloughing and/or discoloration or 
bruising ), upon decision of the investigator this subject may be discontinued from the study. It is 
recommended to perform up to [ADDRESS_354279] spots.  
 Whether or not the IPL settings were mod ified from the previous treatment session , the IPL 
settings used for the current treatment must be recorded in the appropriate eCRF. 
 
5.2.2.  Treatment  
 IPL pulses will be administered on the entire malar region, below the lower eyelids, from tragus 
to tragus including the nose.  Adjacent pulses should be given with overlaps of about 1 mm.  
 In subjects with skin type I -III, two passes will be performed. The first pass will be performed in 
one orientation of the IPL lightguide (for example, when the long side of t he lightguide is 
parallel to the nose axis), and the second pass will be performed in the perpendicular orientation 
(in this example, when the short side of the lightguide is parallel to the nose axis).  In subjects 
with skin type IV, a single pass or a do uble pass will be performed , at the discretion of the study 
investigator . 
 If needed, the lightguide can be changed from small to large, for better accessibility.  
 In subjects of the control ar m, the IPL treatment  will be sham . The study investigator  will to uch 
the skin with the lightguide of the IPL handpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], as he/she would have done if the subject was 
in the study arm, but the trigger button will not be pressed. A clicking sound will be played 
whenever the sapphire lightguide will touch a new location on the skin , to give the subject the 
impression that the treatment is given .  
 At the end of the IPL or sham treatment , the protective goggles  will be removed.  
 The subject will then assess his/her own level of pain/discomfort using a Visual Analog  Scale 
(VAS).  
 Then, e ach eye will be numbed with a topi[INVESTIGATOR_166461], for example P roparacaine Hydrochloride 
0.5%, and the meibomian glands of both the upper and lower eyelids will be manually 
expressed. Expression of the meibomian glands will be done by s queezing the meibomian glands 
with the aid of two Q -tips positioned on either side of the meibomian glands, or with a 
meibomian gland expressor forceps. Upon decision of the study investigator, the Q -tips or the 
meibomian gland expressor forceps may be dip ped in a numbing solution as well.  Squeezing the

 Following MGX, the subject will assess his/her own level of pain/discomfort using a Visual Analog  
Scale ( VAS).  
 Up to 10  minutes later, the study investigator will assess the i mmediate/short term response 
(erythema, edema, purpura, etc.) of the skin using a 5 level scale: 0 = None, 1 = Trace, 2 = 
Mild, 3= Moderate; 4 = Severe.  
 Longer term response (e.g. dryn ess) of the skin are anticipated to appear after the treatment 
and should disappear within several days. This will be documented in a specific section of the 
electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF), at the next visit.  
 
5.2.3.  Post-treatment Instructions  
 At the end of each treatment visit, the study investigator or a designee will apply a sunblock 
protection (30 -50 SPF) to the treated area.  
 On the night following treatment, subjects should generally avoid hot water, cleanse their skin 
gently with tepid water, and hydrat e the treated area with a suitable moisturizer, Aloe  Vera gel, 
or any other anti -burn cream or gel. It is important to avoid mechanical damage to the treated 
area and it should not be rubbed, scratched or pi[INVESTIGATOR_112899].  
 Between treatment sessions and up to 1 mont h after the final treatment session , subjects will be 
instructed to apply a sunblock protection (30 -50 SPF) on the treated area, daily. The study 
investigator should make sure that the subject understands the need to avoid sun exposure, 
especially during t he first 48 h after treatment.  
 If the skin remains intact, subjects will be instructed to continue using standard make -up and 
moisturizing routine when relevant.  
 In the case an unexpected skin reaction occurs, subjects will be instructed to stop using an y 
make -up. Subjects will be instructed to immediately contact [CONTACT_290450].  
 Should subjects experience bothersome pain following a study treatment, they will be instructed 
to use an over -the-counter acetaminoph en-based analgesics for pain management.  
 
5.2.4.  Check -up call  
One day after Tx1, the study investigator or designee will call the subject to ask about his/her 
medical condition and whether any adverse events occurred.

5.3. Follow -up Visit  
5.3.1.  Schedule  
There will be a single follow -up visit at 4 weeks ( - 3 days, + 7 days ) after the 4th treatment  visit  
5.3.2.  Examiner  
The examiner performing the follow -up procedures should be  a different person than the study 
investigator  who treated the subject . 
 
5.3.3.  General examination and r eport of adverse events  
At the beginning of the follow -up visit, the examiner will assess and record the skin condition in the 
treated area. T he examiner will then ask the subject  if any adverse event  occurred. If so, the 
adverse events will be recorded in the appropriate AE form.  In any case of SAE, the study 
investigator must contact [CONTACT_290451] 24 hours, to elaborate whether the SAE is related to the 
device (UADE).  
5.3.4.  Assessment of symptoms  
To redu ce bias, assessment of symptoms will be performed by [CONTACT_423], using the OSDI 
questionnaire, before  any ocular examination  or assessment of study outcome is  performed by [CONTACT_290442].  In addition, the subject will also self -assess his/her symptoms usin g the EDS score with a 
VAS. The change s of OSDI  and EDS , from baseline to the follow -up, will be used to estimate the 
secondary endpoint s. 
5.3.5.  Assessment of TBUT  
TBUT will be measured for each eye separately as follows:  
 A FUL -GLO® fluorescein sodium ophthalmic strip (0.6 mg) will be applied to the inferior tarsal 
conjunctiva  
 The subject will be asked to blink a few times to distribute the dye over the ocular surface.  
 Once positioned at the slit lamp, the subject will close his/her eye completely.  
 Then, the subject will be asked to open his/her eye without blinking.  
 The timer will start as soon as the subject open s his/her eye, and it will be stopped at the first 
sign of tear film break of dry spot formation (first dark spot or dis continuity in the precorneal 
fluorescein -stained tear layer).  
 For each eye, 3 consecutive readings will be taken  
 TBUT will be calculated  as the average of these 3 readings.  
The change  of TBUT , from baseline to the  follow -up, will be used as  the primary efficiency endpoint.

Routine ophthalmic examination s, performed separately for each eye, will include: biomicroscopy 
with the slit lamp (consisting of observation of the lid margins, conjunctiva, and eye lashes), BCVA 
with a n ETDRS chart, and IOP with tonometry.  
 
5.3.7.  Close -up photos of the eyes 
 
Close-up photos of both eyes will be captured with a high -resolution camera (> 325 ppi). Image 
resolution should be high enough to see the lid margins, the iris and individual eye lashes  in focus .  
 
For best results, the camera should be used in “Macro” mode. For a simpler camera with no macro 
mode (for example. iPhone 7), position the camera at a distance of 30 -40 cm from the eye, and 
use the optic zoom to take a close -up photo. If a mob ile phone camera is used, i t is advised to use 
a second mobile phone to provide illumination, rather than rely on the flash capabilities of the 
camera (for an example, see Error! Reference source not found. ). 
 
5.3.8.  Meibography  
Meibography  of the upper and lower  eyelids in both eyes will be performed  using an ophthalmic 
imaging device with a built -in infra -red camera, such as Lipi[CONTACT_39710]/Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_129050] (TearScience/Johnson & 
Johnson), Keratograph 5M (Oculus), Antares (CSO/Lumenis) or equivalent system. While the patient 
rests his/her head on the chin rest, the eyelid  will be gently everted (turned over) using a cotton tip 
applicator, and an image of the eyelid will be captured.  
The percentage of area loss of the meibomian glands will be evaluated using a 5 -point scale, as 
illustrated in Figure 8:  0: no loss; 1: < 25 % loss; 2: 26% -50% loss; 3: 51% -75% loss; 4: > 75% 
loss. 
 
5.3.9.  MGS score  
 
The MGS score will be estimated for each eye separately as described by [CONTACT_290452]  [29]:  
 Along the lower eyelid, 15 glands will be evaluated: 5 nasal, 5 central and 5 temporal.  
 Each group of 5 glands will be squeezed with Q -tips or with the Cunningham expressor 
(Storez) for [ADDRESS_354281].  
 Each gland will be graded  as follows:  3 = clear liquid secretion, 2 = cloudy liquid secretion; 
1 = inspi[INVESTIGATOR_89057]/toothpaste consistency; 0 = no secretion.  
 
 MGS will be estimated as the sum of grades of these 15 glands (range: 0 to 45).

6. Study Evaluations  
6.1. Effic iency   
6.1.1.  Primary  effectiveness  endpoint   
The primary efficiency endpoint will be estimated as the difference in the  change  of TBUT from 
baseline to follow -up (10 weeks) between  the study arm and the control arm, where the change of 
TBUT  is defined as TBUT at the follow -up minus TBUT at the baseline.  
A linear mixed -effect (LME) model  will be used to test the null hypothesis  that the changes of TBUT  
are not different  between the two arms . The success criterion will include the following two 
conditions:  
1. Two-sided p-value < 0.[ADDRESS_354283] s to account for correlation  
between eyes within subjects.  
 
6.1.2.  Secondary  effectiveness  endpoints   
The following secondary  efficiency  endpoints will be estimated : 
 The difference in the change  of EDS, between subjects  in the study arm and  subjects  in the 
control arm  
 The difference in the change  of OSDI, between subjects in the study arm and subjects in 
the control arm  
, where change  is defined as the value of the variable (OSDI or  EDS) at the follow -up minus the 
value of the variable at the baseline.

6.1.3.   Exploratory effectiveness  endpoints  
The following exploratory endpoints will be evaluated : 
 The difference in the proportion s of subjects with TBUT > 10 sec  at the follow -up, between 
eyes in the study arm and eyes in the control arm  
 The difference in the proportion s of subjects with OSDI < 23  at the follow -up, between 
subjects in the study arm and subjects in the control arm  
 The difference in eyelids appearance  at the follow -up, as qualitatively evaluated by [CONTACT_96908], between eyes in the study arm and eyes in the control arm  
 The difference in the percentage of area loss of meibomia n glands, as evaluated using 
meibography, between eyes in the study arm and eyes in the control arm  
 The difference in the change of MGS from BL to FU, between eyes in the study arm and 
eyes in the control arm  
 
, where the change  of a variable is defined as the value of th is variable at the follow -up minus its 
value at the baseline.

7. Study Analysis Plan  
7.1. Primary Study Hypothesis   
The change  of TBUT  (TBUT)  in eyes of the study arm is more positive   than TBUT  in eyes of the 
control arm, 
, where TBUT is defined as TBUT at the follow -up minus TBUT at the baseline , and subscripts  S, C 
indicate the study (S ) or control (C) arms:         
  H0: TBUT S ≤ TBUT C 
  H1: TBUT S > TBUT C 
7.2. Secondary Study Hypotheses  
 
1. The change of OSDI (OSDI) in subjects of the study arm is more negative    than OSDI in 
subjects of the control arm, 
, where OSDI is defined as OSDI at the follow -up minus OSDI at the baseline :    
H0: OSDI S ≥ OSDI C 
                   H1: OSDI S < OSDI C  
 
2. The change of EDS ( EDS) in subjects of the study arm is more negative    than EDS in subjects of 
the control arm, 
, where EDS is defined as EDS at the follow -up minus EDS at the baseline:    
H0: EDS S ≥ EDS C 
                   H1: EDS S < EDS C  
 
7.3. Sample Size  
Approximately  [ADDRESS_354284] lightguide should be  applied ; for IPL and sham subjects the lightguide was being applied too far 
from the eyelid margin  in contrast to what is described in Figure [ADDRESS_354285] treatment s among the initial cohort of subjects at that site was will prove to be ineffective, or 
of reduced effectiveness  compared to the sham control .  The lightguide  was applied correctly at the 
other two sites.

Although no data were unmasked, soon afte r this issue was recognized  by [CONTACT_1750] , Lumenis 
initiated a corrective action (retraining and greater emphasis in the protocol) , to better assure the 
protocol instructions would be followed.  
To restore the original statistical power, the sample size  was increased. Below are the original and 
adjusted calculations of the sample size:  
 
7.3.1.  Original calculation of the sample size  
 
Assuming a 1:1 randomization ratio, a mean of 5 5 sec for TBUT of the study arm, a mean of 1 5 sec 
for TBUT of the control arm, an alpha level of 0.05 and a power of 80%, the total sample size is 50 
completed study eyes (25 for the study arm and 25 for the control arm).  Assuming a dropout rate of 
15%, the anticipated number of enrolled subjects is 58. Assum ing a screening failure rate of 15%, the 
anticipated total number of screened subjects is 66.  
In addition, MGD is less common without concomitant skin rosacea.  Therefore, enrollment  will 
continue until at least 10 subjects without skin rosacea are enrolle d, even if 58 subjects were already 
enrolled.  
 
7.3.2.  Adjusted calculation of the sample size.  
After the corrective action to remedy the treatment errors, the sample size was recalculated using a 
simulation where we made the following conservative assumptions:  
 The initial [ADDRESS_354286] subjects at the affected site had response equal to the control arm (1 5 
seconds)  
 Subsequent  to the corrective action, IPL  subjects at the affected site had a response equal to 
the IPL arm (5 5 seconds)  
 The final analysis was ITT, which i ncluded the inappropriately treated patients in the IPL arm. 
 The correlation between eyes within a subject is 0.5.  
Under these assumptions the overall treatment effect is “diluted” by [CONTACT_290453].  Under the se conservative assumptions, the sample size needed to restore the 
original power was calculated to be 136 evaluable eyes (68 subjects , i.e. 18 subjects more than the 
original 50 subjects ).   
In addition, in order to allow for full comparison of the effect  of the corrective action, 15 patients were 
added to the enrollment at the affected site so there would be sufficient before/after patients to allow 
for clinical  evaluation of the difference.

Adding these 33 (18+15) subjects  to the original 50 completed subjects , the number of completed 
subjects is up to 83. Therefore, with a loss to follow -up rate of 7% the expected number of enrolled 
subjects is 89, and with a screening failure rate of 23% the expected number of screened subjects is 
116. 
All sample size  re-calculations were done prior to any unmasking of any results from the study.  
 
7.4. Study analyses  
The primary  efficacy outcome measure  (TBUT) consist of a pre-treatment measurement (the 
baseline) , a treatment intervention, and a post -treatment measurement (the follow -up). B oth eyes 
will be included in the analysis.  Since the two eyes of a subject are not independent, to estimate 
whether TBUT has improved from the baseline to the follow -up, a linear mixed effects model with 
random intercept , using the subje ct identity as the random effect, is the appropriate test . Since 
there are two eyes per person then there is only one possible covariance structure (i.e. symmetric, 
with a single correlation between eyes).  
The secondary efficacy outcome measures are OSDI a nd EDS which will be collected at the baseline, 
and at a follow -up visit.  In the case of OSDI, the value is estimated per subject. Hence, a single 
value will be collected per subject at each of these two visits. In this case a  paired t -test is the 
appropr iate statistical test to estimate whether dry eye symptoms have improved, using the change 
of OSDI  from baseline to the follow -up.  In the case of EDS, the value is estimated per eye. Hence, 
two values will be collected per subject at each of these two vis its. Since the two eyes of a subject 
are not independent, to estimate whether EDS has improved from the baseline to the follow -up, a 
linear mixed effects model with random intercept, using the subject identity as the random effect, is 
the appropriate test.  The level of statistical significance is  = 0.05. Non -parametric tests will be 
performed if the underlying distributions are not normal.  
For all other  eye-level analyses, where appropriate, sample means of continuous variables will be 
analyzed with linea r mixed effects model with random intercept (whenever both eyes of a subject 
are included in the analysis), or two-sample t -tests. Proportions  will be analyzed with 𝜒2 test s.  
All statistical tests will be two -sided because potentially the treatment procedure may worsen the 
outcome. The level of statistical significance (type I error) is  = 0.05. Non -parametric tests will be 
performed if the underlying distribution is not norma l.   
For descriptive statistics , the N, Mean, Median, S tandard deviation, Standard error of the mean, 
95% confidence interval, M inimum, and Maximum will be reported  for continuous variables; the 
frequency  and proportion for each category will be reported  for nominal and catego rical variables . 
A previous study demonstrated that in subjects with a lower TBUT at the baseline, the change in 
TBUT at the follow -up was larger [21]. Although not shown in this study, the severity level o f skin 
rosacea at the baseline ma y also be a confounder. Hence, in addition to the primary analysis, we 
will carry out an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)  to adjust for these covariates.

The following baseline covariates will be included in th e ANCOVA :  
(1) TBUT at baseline .  This covariate will be treated as continuous.  
(2) The 4 -point severity level of skin rosacea at baseline (0= none; 1 = mild; 2 = 
moderate; 3 = severe).  This covariate will be treated as either a numeric score  
(continuous)  or using orthogona l polynomial contrasts.  
 
 
7.4.1.   Stratified Analysis  
To account for the potential loss of IPL treatment effect at one site (hereafter called  “A”) a stratified 
analysis will be performed that includes a separate stratum comprising subjects at site A who were 
treated prior to the corrective action.  The strata will be labeled as A1, A2, B, and C for sites A, B, and 
C, with A1 and A2 the two separate groups of patients at site A  before and after the corrective action .  
Since the treatment is applied over a sequence  of four visits,  we will conservatively assign to stratum 
A2 only those patients who received all four of their treatments subsequent to the corrective action.  
Any patient who received any one of their four scheduled treatments prior to the corrective act ion will 
be assigned to stratum A1.    
Thus, the following four strata are obtained:  
Stratum  Corrective Action  Description  
A1 No Patients from site A with one or more 
treatment visits prior to the corrective 
action  
A2 Yes Patients from site A with all [ADDRESS_354287] of the corrective action, we will group the strata into two sets: {A1}, for the pre-
corrective -action subjects at site A, and {A2+B+C} for all post -corrective -action subjects at site A, 
combined with all subjects at B or C.   We will test for significance of  the corrective action  by [CONTACT_40397] a 
[ADDRESS_354288] for “treatmen t by [CONTACT_290454]”, using  treatment (1 df) and th e two 
corrective action sets  (1 df) , and test whether the contrast is significantly different from 0, using a two -
sided alpha of 0.15.

 If the contrast is not significant, then the results will be analyz ed as planned, pooling across all 
strata pre - and post - corrective action.  
 If the contrast is significant then we will c arry out the analyses separately  for A1 and for the 
combined {A2+B+C}.  
We will also directly compare outcomes between A1 and A2 by [CONTACT_290455], along with the associated 95% CI.  
8. Adverse events  
8.1. Adverse Events Definitions  
In this study, an adverse event is any undesirable clinical occurrence (sign, symptom, illness, or other 
medical event), that appears or worsens during the clinical study, or requires medical treatment or 
intervention, whether it is considere d to be device related or not. If an adverse event  occur s, the first 
concern will be the safety and welfare of the patient. Appropriate medical intervention will be made . 
Any adverse events or complications reported by [CONTACT_290456]. The study investigator will determine if the adverse event is  device related 
or procedure related. This assessment shall include a description  of the adverse event, the onset date, 
the action taken (drug, surgery, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], etc.), the outcome ( resolved, resolved with residuals, 
ongoing , etc.), the resolution date  (if resolved) , the severity, and seriousness .   
Each adverse event should be assessed according to the following criteria : 
8.1.1.  Severity  
Each adverse event should be assessed for its severity, or the intensity of an event experienced by 
[CONTACT_423].  
 Mild:  Awareness of a sign or symptom that does not interfere with the subject’s activity or is 
transient, resolved without treatment and has no sequelae.  
 Moderate:  May interfere with the subject’s usual activity and require additional intervention 
and/or treatment, and may have additional sequelae.  
 Severe:  Significant discomfort to the subject and/or interferes with the subject’s activity. 
Additional intervention an d or treatment are necessary. Additional sequelae occur. Severe is 
used to describe the intensity of an event experienced by [CONTACT_423].  
8.1.2.  Relationship of AE to the device or the procedure  
Each adverse event should be assessed for its relationship to the de vice or procedure as identified as 
follows:

   Page 55 of 68 
 
 Device:  This category should be restricted to adverse events directly attributable to the study 
device  
Procedure:  A procedure is any activity that supports the usage of the device  
Use the following categories f or assigning the certainty of the relatedness:  
Definitely Related:  An AE is definitely related if it is obvious, certain or there is little doubt 
regarding the relationship  
 Possibly Related:  An AE is possibly related if it is capable of being r elated but relatively unlikely.  
Not Related:  An AE is not related if it is determined that the re is no plausible association.  
Unknown : Use this term if there is insufficient information to determine if the AE is related to the 
device or procedure.  
8.1.3.  Pre-existing Condit ions 
A pre -existing condition should not be reported as an adverse event unless there has been a 
substantial increase in severity or frequency of problems, which has not been attributed to natural 
history.  
8.1.4.  Diagnosis  of Adverse Event  
There should be an atte mpt to report a “diagnosis” of the adverse event, rather than the individual 
signs associated with the diagnosis. However, a diagnosis should be reported only if, in the 
investigator’s judgment, it is relatively certain (i.e., definite or possib le). Otherwise individual signs 
and symptoms should be reported as the adverse events.  
 
8.1.5.  Anticipated Outcome Related Adverse Events  
Anticipated adverse events in this study may include : 
 Skin reactions including: f lare-up, irritation, infection, blistering, pruritis, dryness, 
temporary skin color changes, burns, prolonged edema or erythema, Herpes simplex  
virus reactivation , post-inflammatory hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371] (PIH), contact [CONTACT_8748], and 
scarring. If any antibiotic ointment will be required during the stud y it will be provided 
by [CONTACT_290457].  
 Ocular conditions  including: iritis, iris atrophy, uveitis, elevated IOP, photophobia, 
floaters  
Any anticipated AE that occurs at any time during or after the use of the study device must be 
reported by [CONTACT_290458]. If the anticipated AE, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_72008] 
(Lumenis) or the study investigator, is likely to affect the safety of the subjects or t he conduct of the 
study, the ethical committee  will be notified of t he effect within [ADDRESS_354289]

“any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threaten ing problem or death caused by, 
or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, 
severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary 
plan or applicat ion), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates 
to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.” From a practical perspective, an unanticipated adverse 
device effect means a serious adverse event that is not listed in the device labeling, or the 
frequency or severity is greater than reported in the device labeling.  
In the event of an unanticipated  adverse event, the Investigator will immediately notify the contact 
[CONTACT_290460]. If such an adverse event  is being reported after normal working 
hours, the Investigator will leave a voice message at the telephone number below with 
accompanying report of the adverse event.  
8.1.7.  Serious Adverse Events  (SAEs)  
The term “serious ” is not synonymous with “severe” , the latter being  used to describe the intensity 
of an eve nt experienced by [CONTACT_423].  Any AE that does not meet any of the below criteria will be 
classified as non -serious.  Any AE that meets one or more of the below criteria, will be classified as a 
serious adverse event (SAE).  
An SAE is any event that  satisfies one or more or the following : 
 results in, or contributes to a death;  
 is immediately life -threatening (injury or illness);  
 results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or prolongs an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
 results in permanent impairment of body structure or function, or in persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity;  
 results in an injury that requires medical intervention to prevent permanent impairment of body 
structure or function;  
 is a device malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of the device 
that results in death or serious deterioration in health;  
 is a device malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of the device 
that, if it were  to occur again, could result in death or serious deterioration in health;  
 results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect;  
 is any medically significant injury, event or experience that requires medical/surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above;

8.2. Reporting  
8.2.1.  Adverse Events (AE) and Severe Adverse Events (SAE) Reporting  
All serious adverse events, whether or not deemed expected or device -related, must be reported to 
the contact [CONTACT_290461] 24  hours by [CONTACT_756] (see below). A  written report must 
follow within five (5) working days and is to include a full description of the event and se quence  of 
events . The site personnel will directly contact [CONTACT_290462] C linical Director 
([EMAIL_5693] , +972 -4-9099474 , +972 -52-373416 ).  
The AE source document  must be completed for all adverse events and serious adverse events.  AE 
and SAE data must then be promptly entered into the AE eCRF for review by [CONTACT_290463].  
In addition to reporting adverse events within the context of this clinical study, 21 CFR Part 803 
Medical Device reportin g requirements  and any applicable local device reporting requirements will 
be followed.  
8.2.2.   Device Malfunctions/Medical Device Reporting  
Each device failure will be assessed for possible reporting as a Medical Device Report (MDR), and a 
determination will be made in accordance with the Sponsor’s standard operating procedure. MDRs 
will be reported in accordance with [ADDRESS_354291] 
person at Lumenis within 24 hours . 
8.3. Risk/ Benefit Analysis   
8.3.1.  Risks 
Skin e rythema or edem a is anticipated and should resolve spontaneously , generally within a few 
hours and more rarely within a few days.  More rare complications include skin flare-up, irritation, 
infection, blistering, pruritis, dryness, temporary skin color changes, burns, pro longed edema or 
erythema, Herpes si mplex  reactivation, post -inflammatory hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371]  (PIH) and scarring. 
These complications should all resolve within a few days, possibly with topi[INVESTIGATOR_290411]-biotic, steroids, or anti -inflammatory cre ams or ointments.  
Use of IPL without protecting the eyes at all times with  fully occluding  goggles  may result in severe 
ocular complications , including:  iris photo -ablation, pupi[INVESTIGATOR_290412], uveitis, photophobia, pain, 
posterior synechiae and iris trans -illumination defects.

 Background and Rationale:  Truvada®, is an oral pi[INVESTIGATOR_151855] -retroviral compounds, 
emtricitabine (FTC) and teno fovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) . [COMPANY_009] Sciences reported a total of nearly 100,00 
individuals in the US starting Truvada for  pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) between the years 2012 -2016 1, and 
this number is growing in the US and globally.  Adherence to the one pi[INVESTIGATOR_151856] ( HIV) infection by 
90%, and by 70% from injection drug use 2. Two landmark safety and effectiveness trials which supported the 
FDA approval of Truvada for PrEP were the iPrEX trial, which investigated Truvada use in HIV -negative men 
or transgender women, and the Partners PrEP trial, conducted in serod iscordant couples 3, 4. Both showed 
Truvada reduced risk of HIV infection by 42% (iPrEX) and 72% (Partners PrEP),  noting that risk reduction was 
highly correlated with drug adherence.  Another important study supporting PrEP was the TDF2 trial, which 
showed an HIV risk reduction of 62% 5. Although other clinical studies did not show efficacy, the results 
correlating poor drug efficacy wi th low plasma drug levels did confirm the importance of adherence 6, 7. 
Adherence measured by [CONTACT_6270] -report did not correlate with effectiveness 6, 7. Although adherence is key to 
effectiveness, physicians and other health care providers (HCPs) do not have objective tools to monitor drug 
adherence and be able to tailor counselling to the actual needs of their patients and clients. The evid ence 
supporting the association between adherence and effectiveness is strong, but only objective assessment of 
adherence is reliable and correlates with effectiveness. The scientific premise supporting our work is based on 
this evidence, as well as the ab sence of a point -of-care objective diagnostic test for drug adherence. The most 
objective measure of adherence currently available to detect and quantify drug levels in plasma is liquid 
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS). This method, howev er, requires a specialized lab and 
does not qualify as a point -of-care (POC)  test. Therefore, our project is aimed at filling this gap by [CONTACT_12780][INVESTIGATOR_151857] (aptamer -based biosensor), capable of detecting tenofovir (TFV) in various 
biological fluids at a point -of-care/clinic with a simple -to-use procedure, which will empower HCPs to provide 
real-time adherence feedback with each prescription renewal. Ultimately, real -time monitoring of adherence 
will lead to better counselling, resultin g in higher effectiveness and improved success rates for treatment and 
prevention of HIV infection.   
Given the importance of adherence to the efficacy of TDF/FTC it is of clinical significance to have a reliable 
metric for adherence levels. Self -reporting of adherence, a non -invasive and s imple method of assessment  does 
not reliably correlate with effectiveness and blood serum levels. Currently, the most objective measure of 
adherence available is to detect and quantify plasma levels of tenofovir diphosphate  (TFV -DP), the active 
metabolite of TDF, using LC-MS/MS . Although this method of quantification is reliable, it requires a specialized 
lab and equipment which comes at a significant cost and does not qualify as POC  test. Other recently developed  
methods of measuring TFV levels in urine, ELISA and lateral flow assays, have shown promise, but are limited 
by [CONTACT_151889]. Th e lack of  a POC test to measure adherence leaves a critical gap for physicians and other 
HCPs  when tailoring counseling to improve adherence and ultimately HIV prevention of their patients and 
communities.  
As such, there is an opportunity to evaluate a new method of measuring adherence in a reliable, objective, and 
cost-effective manner. Aptamers are DNA - or RNA -based ligands capable of binding practically any molecular 
target with high specificity, including small molecules suc h as antiretroviral drugs 8. Aptamers have advantages 
over antibodies. They are more stable and made through a process that is more econo mical and reproducible, 
which increases the aptamer’s potential  capability of being more specific than its antibody counterpart.  
Therefore, aptamers are being used as capture molecules for biosensor platforms, which are becoming smaller 
than previous model s, more portable, more sensitive and quantitative (rivaling LC -MS/MS), require less sample 
volume, and simpler to use. Therefore, aptamer -based biosensors or “aptasensors”, have great potential for real -

 time therapeutic drug monitoring.  We will be utilizin g a previously validated DNA aptamer specific for TFV 
and applying it to a biosensor platform.  
This study will focus on determining the sensitivity and specificity of the TFV aptasensor and assess its ability 
to distinguish TFV concentrations associated wi th low and high adherence using biological fluids collected 
from women taking TDF/FTC at different dosing regimens.  
Objectives:  
Compare plasma, urine, and vaginal fluid  TFV concentrations measured by [CONTACT_151890] -MS/MS to determine agreement between the two methodologies, sensitivity, specificity, 
negative predictive value ( NPV ), and positive predictive value ( PPV). 
Primary Objective s:  
 Compare plasma TFV concentrations measured by [CONTACT_151891]-MS/MS to determine agreement between the two methodologies, sensitivity, specificity, NPV  and 
PPV 
 Determine if the TFV aptasensor  can detect differences in  the plasma TFV concentrations between 
high and low adherence dosing regimens and compare the mean difference to the difference calculated 
from values generated by [CONTACT_29864] -MS/MS  
Secondary Objectives:  
 Compare urine TFV concentration measured by [CONTACT_151892] -
MS/MS to determine agreement between the two methodologies, sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and 
PPV 
 Determine if the TFV aptasensor can detect differences in the urine concentrations of TFV between 
high and low adherence dosing regimens and whether these levels correlate with adherence  
 Compare vaginal fluid TFV concentrations measured by [CONTACT_151893]’s limit of detection

 Primary analysis of this study will evaluate the performance of the TFV aptasensor by [CONTACT_151897] V in clinical samples from all women with those values obtained 
from LC -MS/MS. Correlation and agreement between the TFV levels measured by [CONTACT_151898] -
MS/MS will be analyzed using scatterplot and linear regression.   Continuous variables will be compared 
between values measured with the aptasensor versus LC -MS/MS  using paired comparisons.  From this 
comparison, sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and PPV of the aptasensor will also be determined. Confidence 
intervals will b e calculated to assess precision and margin of error of those measures. Using the [ADDRESS_174852] differences in TFV levels 
between the two independent cohorts of women taking TDF/FTC  at different dosing regimens representing 
high (7 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]/week) and low adherence (3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]/week).  We will compar e the two independent cohorts using an 
independent samples t test for normally distributed data or a Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney test for non -parametric 
data.  TFV concentrations from the LA and HA cohorts will be characterized using descriptive statistics (mean,  
median, interquartile range, minimum and maximum).  The values will be compared between the high 
adherence and low adherence groups as well as comparing the mean difference between groups generated by 
[CONTACT_151899] -MS/ M S. Distributions will be checked for normality so as 
to determine the appropriate statistical test.  
Descriptive Statistics:  Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_22977]. Continuous 
variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_3163], standard deviations, medians, quartiles , minima and maxima.  
Control of Type I Error:  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_151864]. P -values and confidence intervals around 
estimates of treatment differences will not be adjusted for multiplicity and are descriptive in nature . These 
statistics will be  provided to guide further future development of the aptasensor; caution must be used as t hese 
statistics will not have a controlled Type I error.

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate / Emtricitabine (TDF/FTC - Truvada®) is the only oral pi[INVESTIGATOR_151867] i s 
approved for prevention of HIV acquisition in the United Sta tes 10. Two landmark safety and 
effectiveness trials which supported the FDA approval of TDF/FTC showed TDF/FTC reduced risk of 
HIV infection by 42% (iPrEX) and 72% (Partners PrEP), noting  that risk reduction was highly correlated 
with drug adherence 4, 5. Although other clinical studies did not show efficacy, the results correlating 
poor drug efficacy with low plasma drug levels did confirm t he importance of adherence 6, 7. The 
approved one pi[INVESTIGATOR_151868]/FTC reduces the risk for sexual transmission of HIV by 90% 
suggesting that with proper adherence a much greater reduction in risk of infection is achievable.  
Given the importance of adhe rence to the efficacy of TDF/FTC it is of clinical significance to have a 
reliable metric for adherence levels. Self -reporting of adherence, a non -invasive and simple method of 
assessment, does not reliably correlate with effectivene ss and blood serum leve ls 6, 7. Currently, the most 
objective measure of adherence available is to detect and quantify plasma levels of tenofovir (TFV) , the

Although this method of quantification is reliable, it requires a specialized lab and equipment which 
comes at a significant cost and does not qualify as point -of-care (PO C) test. Other recently developed 
methods of measuring TFV levels in urine, ELISA and lateral flow assays, have shown promise, but are 
limited by [CONTACT_151900] m white coat effects. This lack of a POC test to measure adherence leaves a critical gap for 
physicians and other health care providers (HCPs) when tailoring counseling to improve adherence and 
ultimately HIV prevention of their patients and communities.  
As such, there is an opportunity to evaluate a new method of measuring adherence in a reliable, 
objective, and cost -effective manner. Aptamers are DNA - or RNA -based ligands capable of binding 
practically any molecular target with high specificity, includin g small molecules su ch as antiretroviral

Only women will be recruited since the endpoints require vaginal sampling. The NIH has mandated that 
children, defined as younger than 18 years old, be included in research trials when appropriate.  This 
study meets “Justifications for Exclusion” criteria f or younger children as set forth by [CONTACT_18121] 
(specifically, “insufficient data are available in adults to judge potential risk in children” and “children 
should not be the initial group to be involved in research studies”). As such, this study does not plan  to 
enroll children. Efforts will be made by [CONTACT_151907]. No selection 
criteria shall be based on race or ethnici ty.

Events, or clinically significant laboratory abnormality as determined by [CONTACT_15370]  
8. Abnormal finding on laboratory or physical examination or a so cial or medical condition in the 
volunteer which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would make participation in the study unsafe 
or would complicate interpretation of data  
7.3. Participant Withdrawal  
7.3.1.  Withdrawal Criteria  
Participants who sign the informed cons ent and agree to participate in the study, but do not meet 
eligibility criteria will not undergo baseline sampling and will not continue in the study.  Once a 
participant undergoes baseline genital/rectal sampling, she may be withdrawn from the study for th e 
following reasons:  
 Failure to follow protocol requirements that is judged severe enough by [CONTACT_151909]  
 Pregnancy or desire to become pregnant  
 Medical reasons, including diagnosis of an STI  
 Personal reasons (pa rticipant request)  
 Discontinuation of treatment adherence arm, or of entire study ( Section  6.5) 
7.3.2.  Target Enrollment   
Participants who initiate product use but discontinue the study prior to completion may not re -enroll.  
Participants will be screened and enrolled so that approximately 14 women (7 per adherence cohort) 
complete all study visits.  
7.3.3.  Follow -up 
If a participant chooses to discontinue the study after baseline sampling, the site may ask the participant 
to return for the next visit’s study procedures, if she is willing and if releva nt. She will be asked about 
medications taken and adverse events ( AEs) since the last visit. She will be exited from the study during 
her last contact [CONTACT_36362].  
 
Page 24 of 45 
 8. STUDY PROCEDURES  
Prospective participants may be pre -screened by [CONTACT_52062]: the study will be explained, the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria reviewed, volunteers’ questions a nswered, and Visit 1 scheduled .  
8.1. Visit 1: Screening/Enrolment  
The following will take place to confirm the volunteer is eligible to continue in the study. Note that if the 
participant is not able to complete any of the  study procedures at this visit, she may return for an 
unscheduled visit prior to Visit 2.  
 The study and informed consent form will be reviewed and all volunteer questions will be 
answered. If the v olunteer is eligible and wishes to participate in the study, she will be asked to 
sign an informed consent form. The Principal Investigator (PI) or designee will sign the form and 
offer a copy to the participant. Permission may be requested as part of the informed consent 
process for storage of the biologic samples obtained during the study for possible future testing, 
as allowed by [CONTACT_779].  
 The informed consent process will include an explanation of adherence support (e.g., text 
message reminders) and a r equest for permission to contact [CONTACT_151910].  
 The participant will be interviewed to obtain medical history and demographic information.  
 Height, weight, and blood pressure will be measured and recorded.  
 A urine specimen will be obtain ed for a urine pregnancy test. If the pregnancy test is positive, the 
participant will be referred as necessary and will not continue in the study.  
 If the participant’s history is significant for a medical condition, a directed physical exam and or 
pelvic exam will be performed  as necessary . 
 Blood samples (approximately 4 teaspoons) will be collected for HIV and HBsAg testing as well 
as serum creatinine to calculate a creatinine clearance.  Participants who test HIV or HBsAg 
positive at screening are not eli gible to continue in the study. They will be counseled and given 
referrals for medical and social services.  
Eligible participants will be scheduled for the next visit  and directed to refrain from vaginal intercourse 
for 48 hours prior to visit 2 . 
8.2. Visit 2 : Baseline Pre-Dose Sample Collection  
This visit will be scheduled for the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (for cycling women) .  
 An interval history will be collected.  
 Eligibility criteria will be reviewed. If any lab tests reveal that the pa rticipant is not eligible, the 
visit should not proceed and the participant will not continue in the study.   
 If indicated by [CONTACT_151911], a directed physical exam and/or urine pregnancy test 
will be performed. If pregnancy is diagnosed, th e participant will be referred as necessary and 
will be discontinued.  
 
Page 25 of 45 
  A vaginal swab for prostate specific antigen (PSA) will be obtained, if the PSA test indicates 
semen exposure, the visit will be re -scheduled.   
 A urine sample will be obtained.  
 Vaginal  swabs will be obtained  
 A blood sample (approximately 2 teaspoons) will be obtained.  
 The participant will be randomized to the HA versus LA regimen and will take her first does of 
TDF/FTC in the clinic under direct observation and the time of product ingestion will be recorded 
in the source document.  The pi[INVESTIGATOR_151874], vaginal and blood samples are 
obtained.  
 The participant will confirm her contact [CONTACT_151912].  
 Participants will be instructed to refr ain from vaginal intercourse for 48 hours prior to visits 3 – 5. 
8.3. Visits 3 – 5: [ADDRESS_174871] 24 hours since the participant’s last 
dose of TDF/FTC.  At each visit, the following procedures will be performed:  
 The study staff will ask the participant if she followed the instructions from the previous v isit, 
and ask about adverse events and concomitant medications.  
 If indicated, a directed physical exam, pelvic exam and/or pregnancy test  will be performed. If 
pregnancy is diagnosed, the participant will be referred as necessary and will be discontinued.  
 Visits 4 and 5:  Study staff will count the number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_151875].  
 A vaginal swab for PSA will be obtained, if the PSA test indicates semen exposure, the 
participant will be remin ded of the restrictions on vaginal intercourse, but the visit will proceed.  
 A urine sample will be obtained.  
 Vaginal s wabs will be obtained  
 A blood sample (approximately 2 teaspoons) will be obtained.  
 Visits 3 and 4:  The participant will take her dose of medication in the clinic, under direct 
observation, if applicable to her dosing regimen , after urine, vaginal and blood samples are 
obtained .  
 Visits 3 and 4:  Study staff will dispense the appropriate number of TDF/FTC pi[INVESTIGATOR_14704] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_151876], so tha t the participant has enough pi[INVESTIGATOR_151877].  
 
Page [ADDRESS_174872] the site if she experiences moderate to severe symptoms 
(e.g. gastrointestinal symptoms).  
Unschedu led visits or procedures (e.g. urinalysis, vital sign measurements)  may be performed at the 
participant’s request or as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_151913]. The 
participant will be asked to come in for an evaluation, as indicated. Unscheduled visits that require 
examination or interview due t o symptoms will be in the study database . 
When an unscheduled visit occurs in response to an AE experienced by a study participant, study staff 
will assess the reported event clinically and provide or refer the participant to appropriate medical care, 
as necessary. All AEs will be evaluated and follow -up of any observed abnormalities will proceed 
according to the s tudy manual.  
8.6. Early Discontinuation  
If the participant discontinues from the study prio r to the final visit, the site may ask the participant to 
return for study procedures and/or sample collection, if she is willing and if relevant. At a minimum, the 
site may ask participants to return for safety assessments. She will be asked about medications taken and 
adverse events including symptoms since the last visit. She will be exited from the study during her last 
contact [CONTACT_36362].

subsequent visits, if indicated by [CONTACT_151916].  
 
Page 32 of 45 
 13. ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
13.1. Definit ion of Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an investigational or approved 
product in humans, whether or not considered product related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including  an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the 
investigational product. Pre -existing events that increase in frequency or severity in nature d uring or as a 
consequence of use of an investigational product in human clinical trials will also be considered as AEs. 
Any AE with an onset date after the first date of study product administration is considered to be 
treatment -emergent.  
All AEs with onse t at or after baseline sampling, whether or not related to the study product, will be 
recorded in the study database .  
According to 21 CFR 312.32 “IND Safety Reports” the following definitions of terms apply to AEs 
occurring in clinical studies involving d rugs.  
13.1.1.  Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is “any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the study product 
caused the event.” An AE is considered to be a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to 
suggest a cau sal relationship between the study product and the AE. Examples of a causal relationship 
include:  
 A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with 
product exposure (e.g., not necessarily applicable to this study, in clude angioedema, hepatic 
injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome)  
 One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with product 
exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the study product (e.g., 
tendon rupture)  
 An aggreg ate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known 
consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that 
commonly occur in the study population independent of product exposure) that indicates 
those events occur more frequently in the product exposure group than in a concurrent or 
historical control group.  
13.1.2.  Adverse Reaction  
An adverse reaction is any AE caused by [CONTACT_145324]. Adverse reactions are a subset  of suspected 
adverse reactions whe re there is reason to conclude that the product caused the event.  
13.1.3.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or 
the sponsor, it:  
 Results in death  
 
Page 33 of 45 
  Is immediately life -threatening  
 Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
 Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  
All SAEs starting from baseline until the last contact [CONTACT_36362], whether or not they are related to the 
study product, must be recorded on in the source documents and study database . Reporting of SAEs is 
outlined in Section  13.4. 
13.1.4.  Unexpected Adverse Event or Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the drug packet 
insert, is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. For example (not necessarily 
applicable to this study), under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_106117]) if the package  referred only to elevated hepatic enzy mes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral 
thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14214]) if the 
package insert  listed only cerebral vascular accidents. “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also 
refers to AEs  or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the package insert  as occurring with a 
class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under in vestigation.  
13.1.5.  Serious and Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction  
The sponsor must report any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected. The sponsor 
must report an AE as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the product and the AE as described above.  
13.2. Relationship to Study Product  
An Investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination of relationship to the 
investigational product for each AE. Relatedness is an asse ssment made by a study clinician of whether 
or not the event is related to the study agent. Degrees of relatedness will be categorized according to 
current DAIDS -approved guidelines. Per the Manual for Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events to 
DAIDS (Versio n 2.0, January 2010), the relationship categories that will be used for this study are:  
 Related:  There is a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study product(s)  
 Not related:  There is not a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to t he study 
product(s)  
13.3. Recording and Grading Adverse Events for Severity  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_4538]/or in response to an open question from 
the study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_151917] t he clinical site. The 
AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when possible. For each AE, the 
investigator will evaluate and report the date of onset, date of resolution, severity, relatedness, action 
 
Page 34 of 45 
 taken, serious outcome (if applicabl e), and whether or not it caused the patient to discontinue the study. 
Each AE will be graded for severity using the applicable DAIDs tables for grading the severity of 
adverse events (see Table  8 ), which can also be found at http://rsc.tech -
res.com/safetyandpharmacovigilance /.  
Table  8: Grading the Severity of Adverse Events  
Adult and Pediatric AEs  http://rsc.tech -res.com/Document/safetyandpharmacovigilance/

Rectal Grading Table  http://rcc.tech -res.com/docs/default -source/safety/rectal -tox-table -
updates -05-11-2012.pdf?sfvrsn=6  
 
For clinical AEs NOT identified in the DAIDS AE Grading Tables, the followin g scale (as listed in the 
DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric AEs) should be used to grade severity:  
 Mild: Symptoms causing no or minimal interference with usual social and functional 
activities  
 Moderate: Symptoms causing greater th an minimal interference with usual social and 
functional activities  
 Severe: Symptoms causing inability to perform usual social and functional activities  
 Potentially Life -Threatening: Symptoms causing inability to perform basic self -care 
functions OR medical or operative intervention indicated to prevent permanent impairment, 
persistent disability, or death  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity whereas 
seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_151918]  13.1.[ADDRESS_174877], the course of the 
pregnancy should be followed until it has an outcome (e.g., spontaneous miscarriage, elec tive 
termination, normal birth, congenital abnormality). If the participant seeks care outside the site, every 
effort should be made to obtain her consent for the site to receive a copy of her medical records related 
to the pregnancy, its outcome and the h ealth of the neonate, if applicable.  
Reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs. Spontaneous miscarriages should be 
reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be reported as AEs.  
 
Page [ADDRESS_174878] be reported to the EVMS IRB 
within 72 hours of discovery. If there is any question whether the event meets the criteria for “serious” it 
should be reported anyway. In additio n, a completed SAE form must be filled out  as soon as possible. 
The investigator must complete, sign and date the SAE pages, verifying the accuracy of the information 
recorded on the SAE pages and the corresponding source documents.  
Additional follow -up in formation, if required or available, should all be sent to the EVMS IRB  within 
one business day of receipt and this should be completed on an SAE form and placed with the original 
SAE information and kept with the appropriate section of the study database and/or study file.  
The investigator will notify the EVMS IRB of any unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse 
reactions as soon as possible, but in no case later than [ADDRESS_174879] Hold/Permanent Discontinuation in R esponse 
to Adverse Events  
13.5.1.  Grade [ADDRESS_174880] use. If the PI/designee opts to temporarily hold study product, reasons for product

Follow -up testing for Grade [ADDRESS_174881] results should be performed at scheduled study visits, as 
clinically relevant. More frequent testing may be performed at any time if required to properly monitor 
and/or manage participant safety, at the discretion of the PI/designee.  
13.5.2.  Grade [ADDRESS_174882] -related, the 
PI/designee may temporarily withhold product. In either case, the PI/designee must continue the 
temporary product hold until resolution of the AE . If product use is resumed and the same AE recurs at 
the same (or worse) gra de level at any time during the study, study product must then be permanently 
discontinued.

 14. STATISTICS  
14.1. Sample Size Justification  
Sample size is based on feasibility rather than statistical considerations; thus, analysis will be primarily 
descriptive and g raphical. Participant flowchart (e.g. number screened, number with genital sampling) 
will be provided.  
14.2. General Statistical Issues  
All attempts will be made to avoid missing data. However, missing values will remain as missing, i.e., 
no attempt will be made to impute. In general, only observed values will be used in data analyses and 
presentations . 
14.3. Analysis Populations  
The population includes healthy, non -pregnant, HIV negative women. The analysis population will 
include all participants who undergo baseline genital/rectal sampling.  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will consist of all subjects who are randomized and have at least one post -
baseline assessment. The FAS will be used to summarize study disposition, baseline characteristics, and 
all non -safety endpoints.  
Evaluation of safety endpoints will be conducted using the Treated Population (TP), consisting of 
women with a t least one dose of product use. If all subjects in the TP have at least one post -baseline 
assessment, then the TP will be identical to the FAS.  
All populations will be defined based on the adherence regimen assigned (HA versus LA) . 
Additional populations or refinements to these definitions, if needed due to unanticipated circumstances, 
will be described in the SAP or statistical report.  
14.4. Statistical Analysis  
Sample size is based on feasibility rather than statistical considerations; thus, analysis will be primarily 
descriptive. Participant flowchart (e.g. number screened, number with sampling) will be provided.  All 
populations will be defined based on the adherence regimen.  
Evaluation of Study Objectives: Study objectives will be evaluated by [CONTACT_151919] w of descriptive 
summaries and graphical displays.  
Primary analysis of this study will evaluate the performance of the TFV aptasensor by [CONTACT_151920] -MS/MS. Correlation and agreement between the TFV levels measured by [CONTACT_151921] -MS/MS will be analyzed using scatterplot and linear regression. Continuous variables 
will be compared between values measured with the aptasensor versus LC -MS/MS using paired 
comparisons.  From this comparison, sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and PPV of the aptasensor will also be 
determined. Confidence intervals will be calculated to assess precision and margin of error of those 
 
Page [ADDRESS_174883] differences in TFV 
levels between t he two independent cohorts of women taking TDF/FTC at different dosing regimens 
representing high (7 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]/week) and low adherence (3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]/week).  We will compare the two independent 
cohorts using an independent samples t test for normally distributed data  or a Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney 
test for non -parametric data.  TFV concentrations from the LA and HA cohorts will be characterized 
using descriptive statistics (mean, median, interquartile range, minimum and maximum).  The values will 
be compared between the hig h adherence and low adherence groups as well as comparing the mean 
difference between groups generated by [CONTACT_151899] -MS/ MS. 
Distributions will be checked to determine normality so as to determine the appropriate stat istical test.  
Descriptive Statistics: Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_22977]. 
Continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_3163], standard deviations, medians, quartiles, minima and 
maxima.  
Control of Type I Error: This pi[INVESTIGATOR_48085] t study is descriptive in nature. P -values and confidence intervals 
around estimates of treatment differences will not be adjusted for multiplicity and are descriptive in 
nature. These statistics will be provided to guide clinical judgment; caution must be  used as these 
statistics will not have a controlled Type I error.  
Definition of Baseline: For both adherence regimens baseline is defined as the Visit [ADDRESS_174884] her should be made 
over the subsequent 30 days. These attempts should be documented in the participant’s study file. The 
final attempt must be a certified letter to the participant with return -receipt requested, or an outreach 
attempt. A copy of this letter or documentation of the final outreach attempt should be in her file. After 
these three attempts, no further efforts need to be made to find her, but her file should remain open until 
study closeout.  
If the participant does not contact [CONTACT_151922], her final disposition will be 
recorded at the time of study closeout, to indicate that she was lost to fol low-up. The lost to follow -up 
designation cannot be made for any participant until study close out.  
15.2. Protocol Adherence and Sampling Windows  
Visits 3, [ADDRESS_174885] 24 hours since the participant’s last dose 
of stu dy medication.  Visit 3 should be conducted 24 hours + [ADDRESS_174886] dose 
at Visit 2.  Visit 4 should be conducted 7 days + [ADDRESS_174887] dose at visit 2.  
Visit 5 should be conducted 1 4 days + [ADDRESS_174888], however, 
report the violation to the IRB as soon  as possible, no later than 5 working days after the emergency 
occurred.  
Other violations from the protocol may not be carried out without prior approval from the IRB if the 
change involves the rights, safety, or welfare of participants; and without prior approval from the grant 
PI (Terry Jacot, PhD) if the change involves the validity of the data, the study's scientific soundness or 
the rights, safety, or welfare of participants.  
All protocol violations should be recorded in a protocol violation log . 
15.4. Modification of Protocol  
No modification of this protocol may be made without written approval of [CONTACT_151933] .

 Page 11 of 49 Template Revised On: 11/1/2021       1.0 Objectives  
1.1 Purpose:   
 
We propose to develop an informatics system to assist people with memory impairment. 
Early stages of Alzheimer's and Alzheimer's related dementia often causes memory 
concerns. Persons with Memory Concern often cannot match names with faces or cannot 
recogn ize faces with a sure feeling of familiarity. Persons with Memory Concern (PWMC) 
may have difficulty remembering the names of family members and friends or may 
address them with a wrong name. They recognize the faces they see daily, such as a 
spouse or car egiver, but they may confuse visiting friends and grandchildren. The inability 
to remember names or relationships contributes to isolation and deeply affects their 
social lives. The proposed solution is a Smartwatch Reminder (SR) system to conspi[INVESTIGATOR_673601]. This system will automatically 
transmit pi[INVESTIGATOR_673602] a smartwatch worn by [CONTACT_673623]. The system will be evaluated on the target persons with memory 
concern population to measure engagement and improvements in social interactions and 
well-being . 
 
Phase I Aims:  
Aim1:  The phase I will develop a prototype SR system with limited features. It will work on 
one model of smartphone and smartwatch. The prototype system can be used to get 
feedback from potential users.  
Aim 2: Examine the feasibility of the SR system for PWMC.  
The result of Phase I will include user feedback that demonstrates the acceptability and 
perceived utility of the system.  
Phase II Aims:  
Aim 3: Phase II will develop smartphone and smartwatch apps designed to work with the 
popular products of 2022. The project will provide a smartwatch and tablet for dyads in 
the treatment group. Family, friends, etc. of the treatment group participants will be able 
to download a smartphone app from an online store. Instructional material will be created 
to show the sugg ested information that can be entered into the app.  
Aim 4: Evaluate whether the Smartwatch Reminders exerts positive benefits for PWMCs’ 
social engagement and well -being via an embedded experimental mixed methods design 
that combines the collection and ana lysis of qualitative data within a traditional 
randomized controlled trial (RCT) design.  
 
2.0 Background  
2.1 Significance of Research Question/Purpose:   Millions of Americans have dementia, 
the loss of mental functions, e.g., thinking, memory, and reasoning, which interferes with

PROTOCOL TITLE: A Mobile Informatics Solution to Aid in Memory  
VERSION DATE: 7/1/2022  
 Page 12 of 49 Template Revised On: 11/1/[ADDRESS_910442] people with memory problems: 
repetitive drill and practice, internal strategies for remembering, and external aids to cue 
or assist people with rememberin g(1). Only the third strategy, using an external tool, has 
been demonstrated to improve social interactions for patients with AD(1 -4). 
2.2 Preliminary Data:  AME Corp. working with [CONTACT_673675] at the University of 
Minnesota has recently completed a s tudy of the use of a smartwatch to display the 
names of people in the vicinity that were identified by [CONTACT_673624]. AME called this 
system a Social Support Assistant (SSA). The SSA consisted of a smartwatch and a body 
worn device with a camera. The bo dyworn device had a database of face images of the 
friends and family of the PWMC. Face recognition software in the bodyworn device 
matched the faces of people who approached the PWMC to the database. Each time a 
new face match occurred the pi[INVESTIGATOR_673603] e would appear on the smartwatch. Other 
information could also appear to identify the relationship that person has with the PWMC. 
A phone app was developed that automated the creation of the face image database for 
the device worn by [CONTACT_673625]’s. This app a llowed a new person to take selfies of their 
face at different angles to optimize the face recognition success. Another person could 
also use the app to take the pi[INVESTIGATOR_673604]. The testing successfully  showed that PWMC liked using reminders about 
friends and family.  
2.3 Existing Literature:  A recent review of intelligent assistive technology describes the 
products that have been or are under development for persons with dementia(5). It is 
significant th at none of these devices has been tested in a clinical study with dementia 
subjects(5). There are also no electronic devices proposed to assist PWMC with the 
recognition of other persons. While little has been developed or tested for PWMC, 
electronic devic es that store information and prompt users to attend to the information 
with alarm and messaging features have been tested with patients with memory 
impairments due to other neurological conditions with promising results(2). For all 
devices being developed  for PWMC, it is important to consider their familiarity with the 
type of device prior to their disease due to their limited ability to learn new 
information(2). Aids that are simple to use and utilize familiar interfaces are most likely to 
be successful(2 ). 
 
3.0 Study Endpoints/Events/Outcomes  
3.1 Primary Endpoint/Event/Outcome:   
Phase I: Twenty care partners will complete a system review checklist and context of care 
items in a  dyadic interview setting. The intervention will be considered successful if at 
SOCIAL PROTOCOL (HRP -580) 
PROTOCOL TITLE: A Mobile Informatics Solution to Aid in Memory  
VERSION DATE: 7/1/2022  
 Page 13 of 49 Template Revised On: 11/1/[ADDRESS_910443] 75% of participants score an average of 4 (out of 5) points or higher on the checklist, 
indicating that SR met their needs (i.e., indicated agree or strongly agree that th e SR was 
useful, acceptable, and feasible overall). This threshold has been used as a benchmark for 
success in prior research evaluating technological interventions for PWMC and their care 
partners(6 -8). If the criteria for success are not met, the technol ogy will be refined based 
on feedback and suggestions from PWMC and care partners, before conducting additional 
testing with the improved prototypes. Ample qualitative feedback will be available via the 
dyadic interviews to guide such refinement.  
Phase I I: Baseline and 6 month data will be used in a 2x2 repeated measures analysis of 
covariance to examine whether use of the SR results in statistically significant changes in 
PWMC negative health transitions and ,  social interaction, pleasant event s, social stress, 
loneliness, relationship closeness, and community engagement and care partner well -
being, such as social support, depression and burden (9). The primary independent 
variable in the proposed investigation consists of an indicator variable for random  
assignment into the SR treatment condition or the attention control group. Additional 
analyses will determine if covariates (context of care, mobile device proficiency, and 
dementia severity indicators) significantly vary across the SR treatment and atten tion 
control groups at baseline and over 6 -months. If statistically significant variations between 
the SR treatment and control groups are found, baseline and/or change scores for these 
covariates will be included in all repeated measures analyses of covar iance tests to 
provide additional statistical control.  
3.2  Secondary Endpoint(s)/Event(s)/Outcome(s):  We will apply a parallel convergent 
mixed methods design. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected and analyzed 
separately, and then paired si de-by-side for comparison(10, 11). Quantitative analyses are 
expected to provide breadth in presenting group -level trends, while qualitative analyses 
will provide insight into variation within these trends, and allow study participants to 
identify meaningf ul SR components for themselves. After independent quantitative and 
qualitative analyses, the results will be paired side by [CONTACT_673626]. Researchers 
will identify and iteratively discuss areas of convergence and divergence to validate the 
results( 10-13). The thematic codes and categories of implementation/use and 
mechanisms of benefit will be cross -tabulated with the empi[INVESTIGATOR_673605], converge, 
or highlight pathways t oward additional questions and analysis(12, 13). This comparative, 
mixed method analysis approach may suggest how and why PWMCs experience the 
greatest benefit while using the SR.  
 
4.0 Study Intervention(s)/Interaction(s)  
4.1  Description:  Researchers will interact with study participants during Phase I and 
Phase II (Table 1). In Phase I, researchers will enroll 20 PWMC and their care partners to

 Page 15 of 49 Template Revised On: 11/1/2021       5.1  Study Design:  The proposed study will enable us to investigate the utility of the 
Smartwatch Reminder for individuals with varying degrees of memory concern. We will 
evaluate the immediate utility of the Smartwatch for persons with memory concern, and 
determine the extent to which participants practice using the system in the three mont hs 
after it is introduced.  By [CONTACT_673627] -to-moderate cognitive 
impairment we will also ascertain the feasibility of starting to use the Smartwatch system 
at a time when participants may immediately benefit from the cues and informati on 
provided by [CONTACT_1190]. Through interview questions, we will probe PWMC and their care 
partners to understand if using the Smartwatch in the early stages of cognitive decline is a

5.2  Study Procedures:   
Phase I Feasibility Pi[INVESTIGATOR_673608]. The objective of Phase I is to make an initial, limited assessment of the value of 
the Smartwatch Reminder (SR) for PWMC and their care partners.  
Phase I Sample Size. The academic team will purposively sample 20 dyads (PWMC and 
their care partners) of varying kin relationships (adult child vs. spouse), gender, and 
race/ethnicity to participate in Phase I feasibility testing.   
Phase I Procedure. A pa rallel -convergent mixed methods design (QUAN+QUAL) will be 
used to generate qualitative and quantitative data on the feasibility and utility of the SR 
system.  
1. Initial Contact: [CONTACT_673628], the RA will explain the 
study procedures and invite care partners to participate in the study. Care partners will 
have the opportunity to ask questions about the study procedures.  
2. Enrollment: If the care partner agrees to participate, the RA will screen the participant 
and schedule the dyad for a      dyadic interview session (see Section 9, “Study 
SOCIAL PROTOCOL (HRP -580) 
PROTOCOL TITLE: A Mobile Informatics Solution to Aid in Memory  
VERSION DATE: 7/1/2022  
 Page 17 of 49 Template Revised On: 11/1/2021       Population”). An email will be sent to the participants containing an instructional 
pamphlet to  read over before the interview.  
3. Consent : The RA will first ensure that the dyad is able to use the video conferencing 
platform and troubleshoot any issues that may have occurred. The RA will then obtain 
informed consent from the care provider and PW MC (see Section 21, “Consent Process”).        
4. Dyadic Interview Sessions: The RA will digitally record each session. Audio recordings will 
be transcribed by a professional transcriptionist. The interview       will begin with  the 
context of care que stions (see Appendix). Participants will then be asked questions on 
technology use prior to and during the COVID -[ADDRESS_910446] about how the technology works (e.g., navigating the 
smartphone app; entering new profiles, photos, and information; using the smartwatch to 
identify the caregiver and other persons nearby).   
 
Immediately after the SR tutorial, participants will be asked to complete a brief survey 
including the SR checklist to evaluate their perceptions of the technology. Questions will 
be asked verbally during the interview session. The SR checklist includes Li kert items 
designed to measure both the PWMC and care partners’ perceptions of the performance 
of SR in terms of ease of use, clarity, and quality of information provided.  
 
The RA will then ask the participants  semi -structured questions      to elicit open -ended 
data on the feasibility and utility of SR (see Appendix). The interview questions include 
prompts about technology more generally to elicit feedback about opportunities and 
barriers for technology to assist care partners and PWMC in nav igating everyday life. This 
will provide a more comprehensive perspective regarding the feasibility and use of the SR 
system.  Participants      will provide in -depth information on the reasons why PWMC and 
care partners felt the SR will or will not be  easy to use, and will point out barriers or 
facilitators to use that will be critical to address when refining SR prior to Phase II.

geographic location, time since diagnosis, type of dementia diagnosi s, Medicaid status, 
living arrangement of the PWMC, and demographics of the PWMC and the care partner.  
 
Semi -structured questions. The RA will conduct  dyadic interviews with Phase I 
participants to elicit open -ended data on the feasibility and utility of SR. Questions will 
also elicit feedback on how participants’ technology use has changed due to the COVID -19

reasons why PWMC and care partners felt the SR was or was not ea sy to use, and will 
point out barriers or facilitators to use that will be critical to address when refining SR 
prior to Phase II (33).  
 
Phase II. Evaluate the Smartwatch Reminder Efficacy  
Overview of Phase II. The primary goal of the SR is to facilitate s ocial interaction for 
PWMC by [CONTACT_673630], friends, and other key people. In this 
Phase II study, the SR will be evaluated to determine whether it provides positive benefits 
for PWMC’s social interactions and well -being.  
Phase I I Sample Size. 100 dyads (PWMCs and their care partners) will be enrolled. Half of 
the PWMCs will be randomly assigned to the intervention group (i.e., use of SR) and half 
to the attention control group. The intervention group will receive the SR.  
Procedu re. An embedded experimental mixed methods design 
([QUAN+qual]→[QUAN+qual])(12) will be utilized to combine the collection and analysis 
of qualitative data within a traditional randomized controlled trial design(12). This will 
assist the project team in ex amining the process of the SR’s implementation during the 
evaluation to determine whether or not and why the SR worked for PWMCs and their care 
partners(12, 34, 35).  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_62701].  Prior to initiating full recruitment, we will pi[INVESTIGATOR_673609] [ADDRESS_910447]: During initial contacts with potential participants, the RA (or, if needed, 
Drs. Mitchell, Mikal and Jutkowitz or the research coordinators) will explain the study 
procedures and invite care partners to partici pate in the study. Care partners will have the 
opportunity to ask questions about the study procedures.  
2. Enrollment: If the care partner agrees to participate, the RA will schedule a brief 
screening and enrollment procedure using the inclusion criteria (see Section 9, “Study 
Population”). The RA will obtain informed consent/assent from the care partner and 
PWMC (see Section 21, “Consent Process”).  
3. Baseline survey:  Following enrollment, a baseline survey will be administered to both the 
CP and PW MC (either online in Qualtrics or via mail, if preferred) within 2 weeks of 
enrollment (see Appendix). The RA will administer this prior to exposure to the 
intervention/attention control.  
4. Randomization: Following completion of the baseline survey, PWMC and  their care 
partners will be randomly assigned to the SR treatment condition that receives full access

 Page 19 of 49 Template Revised On: 11/1/2021       to the SR along with the training procedures or an attention control group. Randomization 
(participant is assigned to either the treatment or control con dition) will be completed via 
an a priori list generated from http://randomizer.org by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Mikal. For those in the SR 
treatment group, the research coordinator will schedule a time to introduce the SR to the 
PWMC and the care partner via Zoom or telephone.   
To ensure blinding is maintained, the RA will not have access to the password -protected 
database containing participants’ group assignment, and will not review survey data 
completion (which would un -blind the RA since all of the treatment participant fol low-up 
surveys will contain the system review and all control participant follow -up surveys will 
not). Additionally, opaque, sealed envelopes will be created for the research coordinator 
to reveal which group each participant was randomized into. The outsi de of each 
envelope will be labeled with a dyad’s ID and the inside will contain their group 
assignment, which will ensure integrity of the randomization order since no one will be 
able to change the order once the envelopes are created.  
5. 3-month survey or contact [INVESTIGATOR_1306]: A survey will be administered (either online in Qualtrics 
or via mail, if preferred) by [CONTACT_673631] [ADDRESS_910448] and open -ended questions (see Appendix) 
and will be sent only to dyads in the intervention group in their follow -up survey (th e RA 
will remain blinded because they will email participants personalized links to the survey 
which do not indicate whether the participant is receiving the SR system review or not in 
their follow -up survey). The attention control group will receive a [ADDRESS_910449] call 
from the research coordinator. Based on our prior experience, PWMC and care partners in 
an attention control group will often seek information and psychosocial support during 
these calls. We will provide free information resources (e.g., brochures or websites of the 
Alzheimer’s Association). See section 10.2 about re -assessing each PWMC’s capacity to 
consent at each time point.  
6. 6-month survey or contact [INVESTIGATOR_1306]:  A survey will be administered (either online in Qualtrics 
or via mail, if prefer red) by [CONTACT_673631] [ADDRESS_910450]. 
Additionally, a system review of the SR will be administered by [CONTACT_673632] 6 months following enrollment (while 
remaining blinded). The attention control group will receive a [ADDRESS_910451] call from 
the research coo rdinator.  
7. Data tracking for 6 months: Detailed data on frequency and duration of use by [CONTACT_673633], allowing for an analysis of exact 
utilization and practicality (i.e., how long and often PWMC and thei r care partners actually 
use the technology). This data will be shared with us securely via Box by [CONTACT_673634].  
8. Semi -structured interview:  [ADDRESS_910452] up to one month 
after completion of the final 6 -month follow -up survey with int ervention group 
participants only.  Due to a change in study funding and timeline, as of 9/1/23, to meet the

following the 3 -month follow up survey with intervention particip ants. Dyads will 
complete only one interview at 3 or 6 months, not at each time point.  
Note: Baseline and follow -up surveys and interviews will be in a format that is convenient 
to care partners and PWMCs: through online or mail  formats, whichever is desired by [CONTACT_673635]. Each baseline survey is anticipated to take no more than [ADDRESS_910454] or moved into a l ong-term care facility as 
determined by [CONTACT_673636] 3 - or 6-months, the PWMC would not be 
administered any additional surveys and the care partner would receive shortened follow -
up surveys if they agree to continue, depending on the per son with memory concern’s 
scenario (bereavement or transition to a long term care/assisted living facility).  
The RA will complete disposition calls or emails ±[ADDRESS_910455] care partners within 1 week of  a missed survey to resend, and 
update participants’ contact [CONTACT_673637]. RA will follow 
up with CG and PWMC via email reminders at 1, [ADDRESS_910456] the date a survey was 
sent if it is still incomplete. Additionally, a t 3 weeks RA/RC will try to contact [CONTACT_673638]. If no response, participants will be considered lost to follow up (LTFU) for that 
time point.  
Note: If LTFU occurs at baseline, the dyad will be withdrawn from study as they were not 
randomized.  
An annual  project newsletter will be sent to all participants to provide updates on study 
progress as well as provide seasonal caregiving tips. Finally, in order to provide additional 
rapport and incentive to participate in the attention control group, all PWMC and  care 
partner dyads in the proposed project will be provided with up to a $100 participation 
incentive following completion of their 6 -month survey  (see more information in Payment 
section 12.5) . Those in the treatment group who are selected for and comple te a semi -
structured interview will receive an additional $[ADDRESS_910457] based on participant scheduling needs.  
Baseline, 3 -Month and 6 -Month Survey.  The RA will administer all surveys (see 
Appendix). The surveys are designed to collect information from both PWMC and care 
partners. The selected measures have strong psychometric properties, sensitivity to 
change, and clinical relevance in the evaluation  of health technology such as SR. Our past 
experience in distributing surveys of similar length indicate that they take PWMC and 
their care partners approximately 20 -45 minutes to complete. Mean and sum scores will 
be calculated for all scales.

VERSION DATE: 7/1/2022  
 Page 21 of 49 Template Revised On: 11/1/2021       ● Context of care (baseline only). Care partners will complete context of care variables 
include geographic location, time since diagnosis, type of dementia diagnosis, Medicaid 
status, living arrangement of the PWMC, and demographics of the PWMC and the care 
partner.  
● Dementia severity. Care partners will complete validated measures of dementia severity 
including the PWMC’s dependence on assistance with 6 activity of daily living tasks and 
dependence on assistance with 6 instrumental activity of daily living tasks(16 -18, 50-52). 
An 8 -item scale will assess the intensity of PWMCs’ memory losses, communication 
deficits, and recognition failures at each time point (memory impairment)(19, 20). From 
the Dementia Severity Rating Scale, we are using one item about the PWMC’s rec ognition 
of others (53). Additionally, during screening, the PWMC will complete the Telephone 
Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS -40) developed from the Aging, Demographics, and 
Memory Study), which will assess their level of dementia severity at the begi nning of the 
study (50).  
● Social interaction. Questionnaires will be administered to care partners to determine the 
frequency and quality of PWMCs’ interaction in six different areas: in -person visits; 
telephone/video calls; traditional mail correspondence,  text messaging, or email;, and 
social media. Per the recommendations of prior research on informal long -term care, a 
prior week estimate will be completed that includes frequency and duration of each 
activity(22). A 7 -day time -window was chosen as it is l ess prone to recall error. In addition 
to frequency data, satisfaction with the quality of interaction will be assessed on a simple 
5-point scale, similar to prior reliable measures utilized in Alzheimer’s disease and related 
dementias care partner interve ntion studies(23).  
● Pleasant Events/Social Engagement. Care partners will complete the Pleasant Events 
Schedule -AD (PES -AD) Short Version (24, 25) for PWMCs. The PES -AD Short Version 
includes 20 items of events and activities for PWMCs. As originally constr ucted, the items 
of the PES -AD were within the capacity of individuals suffering from the earlier/milder 
stages of dementia, and thus were appropriate for inclusion in this Phase II project(24, 
25). Items are rated according to their frequency during the p ast month and how much 
the PWMC enjoys the activity. An overall summary score assessing frequency of 
engagement in enjoyable activities is generated by [CONTACT_673639]. The P ES-AD has 
demonstrated excellent reliability and validity(24, 25).  
● Global Health. The PWMCs’ overall health and quality of life are being measured using the 
PROMIS Scale v1.2 – Global Health (26). This assesses various aspects of health and life, 
such as r atings of mood, satisfaction with social activities/relationships, average pain, etc. 
through a series of 10 questions asked of the PWMC.  
● Mobile Device Proficiency and social media use. The Mobile Device Proficiency 
Questionnaire (MDPQ -16; short form) is a 16 -item scale used to measure how proficient 
the CP and PWMC are using various new technologies, such as tablets  and their different 
features (27). The CPs’ social media usage is also being measured using 3 questions 
developed by [CONTACT_5051].

VERSION DATE: 7/1/2022  
 Page 22 of 49 Template Revised On: 11/1/2021       ● Social Support/Loneliness. Socioemotional support will be measured on a five -item scale 
to assess the affective assistance provided to the care partners by [CONTACT_673640](19, 20). The Lubben Social Network Scale -6 (LSNS -6) is a six -item scale 
that assesses social isolation among the CP and PWMC (55). Loneliness will be measured 
with the 3 -item Short Scale for Measuring Loneliness in Large Surveys(28).  
● Care partner well -being. The 11 -item Eriksonian Psychosocial Stage Inventory - Identi ty 
scale(29) will be administered to assess changes in identity coherence. The 10 -item Center 
for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_2557] -Depression scale will be used to measure care partner 
depressive symptoms(30, 31).  
● Relationship closeness. A 6 -item measure  of Relationship Closeness (32) will be used to 
evaluate the quality of the relationship between the PWMC and their care partner. This 6 -
item measure is part of the Stress Process Model for Residential Care (SPM -RC), 
developed by [CONTACT_578543] a nd based on the Stress Process Model (SPM) for 
deme ntia caregiving . The measure assesses caregiver agreement with statements about 
their relationship with their relative using a 4 -point Likert scale (1=strongly disagree, 
4=strongly agree). Higher scores in dicate a closer relationship (range 6 -24).  
● Community engagement. A [ADDRESS_910458] will 
evaluate the PWMC’s typi[INVESTIGATOR_673610]. The survey evaluates average frequ ency of leaving the home; socializing in -person 
with family and friends; and destinations accessed including senior centers, gyms and 
recreational facilities, educational classes, libraries, faith services, club meetings, coffee 
shops/cafes, and parks. Fol lowing the [ADDRESS_910459] -baseline asks in which situations the SR system was and was not useful, and 
why.  
● Caregiving Burden. A short version of the Burden Scale for Family Caregivers (BSFC -s) is a 
valid measure o f subjective burden among family caregivers and is measured using 10 -
items on a 4 -point scale (54).  
 
Phase II will also feature [ADDRESS_910460] up to one 
month after completion of the final 6 -month follow -up survey.  As of 8 /31/[ADDRESS_910461] up to one month after 
completion of the 3 -month follow -up survey.  Dyads will only complete an  interview at one 
time point (not both). It was determined that interviews at 3 months will be as rich in data 
as the 6 month surveys.  A sequential mixed methods sampling approach will be 
utilized(36) where the results of the first methodological strand w ill inform the selection 
of participants in this second methodological strand. Specifically, the academic 
collaborators (led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Mikal) will purposively select [ADDRESS_910462] scores between 4 and 5 (i.e., SR met thei r needs) and [ADDRESS_910463] scores of 3 and below (i.e., neutral and 
below regarding SR meeting their needs). A stratified purposive sampling approach will be 
applied: the academic collaborators will identify family c are partners of different kin

(middle versus late stage dementia symptomatology), caregiver gender, and racial or 
ethnic background of caregivers to participate.  
The open -ended responses of the semi -structured interviews will provide in -depth

9.0 Study Population  
9.1  Inclusion Criteria:  Inclusion criteria for PWMC are as follows: 1) English speaking; 
2) a physician diagnosis of early -stage Alzheimer’s disease or mild -to-moderate cognitive 
impairment ; 3) live in the community (including at home with or without the care partner, 
in a retirement community, etc.) ; 4) no histor y of serious mental illness (i.e., any major 
psychiatric disorder) and 5) must have some level of cellular connection in their place of 
residence (if known).  
Care partners of PWMC must: 1) speak English; 2) be 21 years of age and over; 3) self -
identify as someone who provides assistance to the PWMC because of their memory loss 
(these individuals are called ‘‘care partners,’’ as these individuals may or may not provide 
the intensive hands -on care typi[INVESTIGATOR_12340] ‘‘caregivers’’); and 5) indicate a willingness to u se 
the smartwatch system as well as to being randomized to a control group.  
9.2  Exclusion Criteria:  Those who do not meet the criteria above will be excluded.  
Additionally, PWMC with severe or no dementia are not eligible.  
9.3 Screening:  Potential participants will complete a brief screening survey prior to enrollment, 
including items assessing each of the inclusion criteria listed above.  Those who are consid ered 
eligible based on their responses will be invited to participate in the study.  It is possible that 
potential participant informally screen as ineligible before completing a screener due to the 
natural progression of conversation via telephone or email . In these instances we would not 
continue to formally screener with those who we know are already ineligible.  
In Phase II, PWMC will be administered the TICS -40 (Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status - 
developed for the Aging, Demographics, and Memory S tudy) via Zoom or the telephone during 
screening (50). The TICS -40 is a brief, 17 -item screening tool, with scores ranging from 0 to 40, 
that is used to screen for different levels of cognitive impairment. According to a crosswalk 
between the Mini -Mental S tate Exam and the TICS -40, cutoff TICS -40 scores for mild dementia 
are 17 -24, for moderate dementia are 6 -16, and severe dementia are 0 -5 (51, 52). Individuals 
with scores indicating presence of mild or moderate dementia (scores from 6 to 24) will be 
eligible to participate in the research. Individuals without the presence of dementia or with 
severe dementia will not be eligible.

10.2 Additional Safeguards:  
The smartwatch technology being tested in this study is designed to be used by 
[CONTACT_673642] -to-moderate dementia severity.  Testing the feasibility and utility of 
the technology for persons with mild or moderate cognitive impairment is therefore 
an im portant research objective.  It is anticipated that the technology will be most 
useful to individuals whose memory has deteriorated enough to benefit from the cues 
and reminders provided by [CONTACT_673643].  Therefore, moderate cognitive 
impairment may repr esent the least degree of impairment compatible with the aims 
of the study.  By [CONTACT_673627] -to-moderate cognitive impairment, 
we will learn whether the technology is feasible for various stages of cognitive 
impairment , whether the tech nology provides improvements in social interactions, 
and whether there are modifications that might improve the utility of the technology 
for PWMC.  
 
Due to the natural progression of AD/ADRD and the length of the study, PWMC will be 
reassessed for their ca pacity to consent and re -assent or re -consent to participate in

 Page 27 of 49 Template Revised On: 11/1/2021       the research at 3 - and 6 -month time points. We will use the UCSD Brief Assessment of 
Capacity to Consent to determine whether participants are capable of providing 
consent for themselves. Thos e who are not able to provide consent will be asked to 
re-assent to participate, in which case, assent will be documented by [CONTACT_673644] (attached). Those who are able to provide 
consent will be asked to re -consent  to participate using the brief follow -up consent 
form (attached).  
 
Since the study involves no invasive procedures, there will be no physical risks to study 
participants.  Thus, no research -related injuries need to be disclosed as none are 
expected.  The consideration of need is potentially stressful, and thus there are 
possible psychological risks for t he PWMC and care partners. However,  the research 
team has considerable e xperience providing psychosocial support to Alzheimer’s 
disease and related dementia caregivers on various research protocols,  so serious 
psychological risks are unlikely to occur  based on this experience . The potential social 
or legal risks for the partic ipants relate only to possible violations of confidentiality.  
Participants with impaired capacity to consent will be closely monitored when first 
introduced to the smartwatch technology and taught how to use it; given that this 
technology is non -invasive, additional monitoring in Phase II will take place at the 3 - 
and 6-month survey interviews.  Participants with memory concerns will be withdrawn 
from the study if they appear unduly distressed.  
We will use the UCSD Brief Assessment of Capacity to Consent to determine whether 
participants are capable of providing cons ent for themselves.  Those who are not able 
to provide consent personally will be asked to assent to participate.  In that case, 
assent will be documented by [CONTACT_673645] 
(attached).  All potential participants wil l be informed of the research objectives and 
procedures to the greatest extent that is compatible with their understanding.  
Though not specifically targeted for inclusion, participants from some of the above 
groups (indicated in the table) may be allowed to participate, as indicated in the table. 
Participants will be reminded that all study procedures are voluntary and will not 
impact the care they receive from any institution. We do not anticipate any individuals 
from the above noted groups to have increa sed risk from participating in the proposed 
research, such as an increased risk of coercion, etc. Thus, our standard protocol 
practices (i.e. data security, confidentiality procedures, etc.) provide reasonable 
protections to these vulnerable participants.  
The research does involve cognitively impaired adults, or adults with fluctuating, 
diminished, or lacking capacity to consent, this the ( CHECKLIST: Cognitively Impaired

any exclusions indicated in the table above:   
Some individuals in the above vulnerable groups are excluded because they are not 
our population of interest (i.e. ADRD does not impact children) or because 
partici pating in such resea rch would potentially be risky  for them  or because they 
would be ineligible (i.e. must live in the community therefore prisoners would be 
ineligible) .  
 
11 Number of Participants  
11.1 Number of Participants to be Consented:   
Phase I: 20 dyads, or 40 participants  
Phase II: 100 dyads, or 200 participants  
 
12 Recruitment Methods  
12.1 Recruitment Process: Participants will be recruited in various in -person and online 
ways using the approved text and images.  In person recruitment opportunities may 
include advertisements at memory clubs and programs for PWMC, through the Care 
Options Network, and at the annu al Caring for People with Memory Loss 
Conference. Additionally, virtual recruitment via advertisement in the University of 
Minnesota Caregiver Registry and via newsletters shared by [CONTACT_673648].  The 
research coordinators, [CONTACT_673681], [CONTACT_131854], [CONTACT_673679], or [CONTACT_673682] will initiate 
email, telephone, or mail contact [CONTACT_673649], or those who complete a permission to  contact [CONTACT_673650] (HRP -580) 
PROTOCOL TITLE: A Mobile Informatics Solution to Aid in Memory  
VERSION DATE: 7/1/2022  
 Page 29 of 49 Template Revised On: 11/1/2021       (sent out via emails, shared at the conference, via newsletters, etc.; attached). In 
addition, [CONTACT_673681], [CONTACT_131854],  [CONTACT_673679], or [CONTACT_673682]  will ask professional care 
providers on the Registry to identify potential family members for recruitment 
purposes, including family members of diverse ethnic or racial origin and geographic 
location (given that many provide care to under -represented olde r persons). 
Snowball recruitment among potential/enrolled participants may also be used. In 
this case, following the initial screening conversation, potential participants may be 
asked if they know of anyone else who might be fitting for the study. If so, UMN 
staff will share an approved flyer for the [potential] participant to then share. If 
needed, participants will be recruited via ads on facebook and newspapers, on the 
National Institutes of Health -supported website called researchmatch.org , and other 
national research recruiting sites  and registries fitting for this population  (such as 
Banner Health  and FTD Disorders Registry LLC ). Using this method, only those who 
are interested are contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
Registration forms for educational presentations (by [CONTACT_673651]) 
may include an opportunity for individuals interested to provide their permission for 
the research team to contact [CONTACT_673652]. 
[Thus, by [CONTACT_673653], UMN staff or other agency staff inv olved in planning, 
hosting, or post -webinar certificates will have access to the names/contact 
[CONTACT_673654]].  Presentation “polls” may offer an additional opportunity for presentatio n 
attendees to provide permission for contact. Presentation slides may also be used 
during these community presentations to increase outreach. Hard copy permission 
forms may also be presented at in -person presentations.  
Note: General promotional materials/ text (emails/newsletters/flyers/etc) are shared 
in the context of general promotional recruitment efforts. However, study staff do 
not pursue individualized study -related contact [CONTACT_673655] a permission form/request for 
information is obtained.  
12.2 Source of Participants:  Participants will be community members  who respond to a 
recruitment source listed in 12.[ADDRESS_910468]. Gaugler and his evaluation team developed 
and actively maintain the Caregiver  Registry based on their community outreach and 
education efforts on Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. All individuals in 
the Registry have provided permission for [CONTACT_283805] and his team to contact [CONTACT_673656]. The registry i ncludes [ADDRESS_910469] 2018,  and calls for new registry participants occur 
annually from March to June.  
12.3 Identification of Potential Participants: Individuals will self -identify as potential 
participants. [CONTACT_283805] has developed and maintains the University of Minnesota 
Caregiver Registry based on his various community outreach and education efforts 
on Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (#10 07S85812). All individuals in the 
Registry have provided permission for [CONTACT_283805] and his research staff to contact 
[CONTACT_578539] (HRP -580)

hosts events among our target population, which may also be used for recruitmen t. 
Finally, [CONTACT_283805] is a member of the Care Options Network, and will post an 
invitation to participate to Network members. No medical records will be used to 
identify potential participants.

12.3.3  No medical records will be used to identify potential participants.  
12.4 Recruitment Materials: Flyers, emails, ads, and phone calls will be used for 
recruitment.  A copy of the flyer and email/phone script are included in the IRB 
application.  
 
12.5 Payment: In order to provide additional rapport and incentive to participate, all 
care partner and PWMC dyads in the proposed project will be provided with up to a 
$100 participation incentive. Those who are selected a nd complete a semi structured 
interview will be provided an additional $50 participation incentive.  Compensation will 
be mailed after completion of  participa tion (following the dyadic interview for Phase 
I, and after the 6 month assessment for  Phase II).  For phase II, dyads will receive a 
prorated amount based on the number of surveys completed ($33.00  for one , $66.00  
for two,  or $100.00  for all three ) The dyads will be compensated using Amazon gift 
cards.  
13 Withdrawal of Participants  
13.1 Withdrawal Circumstances:  If instances of elder abuse or mistreatment are 
identified or reported to the research team, the Minnesota Adult Abuse Reporting 
Center will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (1 -[PHONE_13982]) and the participant will be withdrawn from 
the study witho ut their consent.  
 
Withdrawal Procedures: In instances where care partners or PWMCs wish to withdraw 
from the study, we will determine the reason for study withdrawal, and whether or 
not the care partner or PWMC agrees to still complete regular, brief surveys (either 
online or over the phone) to collect data on outcome variables.  Data prior to 
withdrawal will be used in subsequent analyses unless the dyad does not wish for 
their data to be included at all.

participants will be asked to return the SR technology to the research team.  We will 
thank them for participating and distribute compensation.  After all participants have 
completed their study period, we will clean and analyze the data, and generate 
reports of the findings.  Data will be securely stored for [ADDRESS_910472] been completed.    
14 Risks to Participants  
14.1   Foreseeable Risks: Since the study involves no invasive procedures, there will be 
no physical risks to study participants. The consideration of need is potentially stressful, and thus 
there are possible psychological risks for the PWMC and care partner. Since research team has 
considerable experience providing psychosocial support to Alzheimer’s disease and related 
dementia caregivers on various research protocols, serious psychological risks are unlikely to 
occur. The potential social or legal risks for the participants relate only to possible violations of 
confidentiality.  
Complete privacy cannot be guaranteed while using Zoom video conferencing, as some tools 
keep participant data, and we cannot guarantee others are not keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a log of the discussion. 
Additional steps will be taken by [CONTACT_673657] e dyadic interviews.  
The experience of the University of Minnesota research team will minimize the possibility of 
psychological risks. The unlikelihood of such problems is evident from the absence of any 
clinically significant problems during the past fift een years that [CONTACT_283805] has operated various 
protocols related to dementia caregiving research. Additionally,  as another safeguard,  
participants will receive a list of ADRD and caregiving resources (approved)  at each time point 
with their baseline and f ollow -up surveys, during a time where sensitive questions may prompt 
emotional responses  related to current and future situations . RA will be trained to interview in 
ways that are non -threatening, friendly, and respectful. We will emphasize to all particip ants that 
they do not have to complete any question they do not want to answer, and that the interview 
may be terminated at any time according to their wishes. We will stress to care partners or 
PWMCs that their decision to discontinue the study will in no  way affect the services they are 
receiving from the University of Minnesota or other entities.  
In the event a care partner or PWMC does become upset during the interview process, the RA 
will contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_673611]. If a part icipant is in crisis because of 
their care situation or some other reason, research staff will be instructed to consult with the PI. 
With the participant’s permission, we will then contact [CONTACT_673658] (e.g., the Al zheimer’s Association). Based on the research team’s experience 
working with caregiving families, we expect no or very few such instances to occur. If a member 
of the research team does identify neglect or other potentially inappropriate care practices, th e 
state Ombudsman will be notified to protect the rights of persons with dementia and their 
families.  
There is a possibility that data collected by [CONTACT_673659], such as location, could be 
lost. This is very unlikely to occur, but participants w ill be made aware of this risk prior to 
consenting.

16 Potential Benefits to Participants  
16.1   Potential Benefits: We anticipate that using the smartwatch technology will 
benefit participants by [CONTACT_673660] -being.    
17 Statistical Considerations  
17.1   Data Analysis Plan:  
Phase I Quantitative Analysis: As the aim of Phase I is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, 
and utility of Smartwatch Reminder, the quantitative analyses of Phase I will largely rely on 
descriptive statistics. Specifically, Phase I quantitative analyses will utilize frequency tab les and 
means to examine sample characteristics and item -level responses to the [ADDRESS_910473] and context of care items (see appendix). Mean scores for each item, as well as an 
overall summary score for each participant, will be calculate d.  
Phase I Qualitative Analysis: Analyses of qualitative treatment fidelity data will primarily focus on 
thematic content analysis of open -ended data to examine Smartwatch utility and mechanisms of 
benefit. As noted by [CONTACT_673661], systemat ic reading and rereading of qualitative 
content and hand coding of a significant proportion of this content is necessary in order to 
develop an understanding of meanings in their conversational or observational contexts(38, 39). 
Grounded theory techniques described by [CONTACT_578567](38) and Strauss and Corbin(39) will guide the 
analyses of qualitative data in this evaluation. These approaches allow participants to construct 
meanings, perceptions, and behaviors from their own vantage points. [CONTACT_131854] and [CONTACT_673683] ay 
will lead open -coding of all available qualitative data: the interview  transcripts and RA field notes. 
All qualitative data will be thematically analyzed using Braun and Clarke’s (2006) six steps of 
thematic analysis: (1) familiarization; (2) genera tion of initial codes; (3) search for themes; (4) 
review themes; (5) define and name [CONTACT_172424]; and (6) write up of themes analyzed. Researchers 
will follow an iterative process to continually identify themes, linkages, and explanations. Regular 
debriefing an d audit trails (clear pathways detailing how the data are collected and managed) will 
enhance transparency and credibility(40). All open -ended data collected will be first read by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Mitchell and [CONTACT_673679] to identify textual elements that emerge repeate dly (i.e., codes); these 
codes will then be clustered into larger categories that are later used to construct major thematic 
elements from the text (with the use of nVivo 10 analytic software). These themes will provide 
insights as to the SR’s implementati on and use (i.e., treatment fidelity/process evaluation 
embedded component) and mechanisms of benefit (i.e., semi -structured interview embedded 
component). During weekly meetings in the analysis phase of the proposed project, [CONTACT_131854] 
and [CONTACT_673679] wi ll discuss their own identified codes to reach a consensus about specific codes, 
categories, and themes that emerge from the qualitative data (these decisions will be noted in an 
SOCIAL PROTOCOL (HRP -580) 
PROTOCOL TITLE: A Mobile Informatics Solution to Aid in Memory  
VERSION DATE: 7/1/2022  
 Page 33 of 49 Template Revised On: 11/1/2021       audit trail). In addition, patterns that link particular themes will be ident ified and discussed in 
successive meetings between [CONTACT_131854] and [CONTACT_673679] to identify more complex processes of 
Smartwatch use or this technology’s pathways to benefit PWMC and their care partners. During 
monthly team meetings, the development of code s, categories, and themes will be reviewed with 
the other academic investigators (Drs. Gaugler and Jutkowitz) and the AME team to yield any 
additional input into these project components. The multiple team meetings and discussions will 
allow for an explora tion of alternative interpretations of the qualitative data and will also provide 
a check regarding the quality and richness of the data collected during the embedded mixed 
methods components.  
Phase II Quantitative Analysis: Data available at baseline and 6 months will allow for a 2x2 
repeated measures analysis of covariance to examine whether use of the SR results in statistically 
significant changes in PWMC negative health transitions and ,  social interaction, pleasant events, 
social stress, loneliness, ,  relationship closeness, and community engagement and care partner 
well-being, such as social support, depression and burden (9). The primary independent variable 
in the proposed investigation consists of an indicator variable for random assignment into th e SR 
treatment condition or the attention control group. IBM SPSS Statistics 21(41) will be used to 
conduct these analyses, as it supports a range of univariate, bivariate, and multivariate statistical 
analysis procedures. The team has extensive experience  conducting longitudinal analyses on their 
prior research on dementia(5, 6, 42 -44). Our proposed analyses will provide in -depth tests of the 
study hypotheses. Outcomes will include statistical significance of within -subjects, or 6 -month 
change, in those in  the Smartwatch Reminder treatment or control groups on key outcome 
variables (see above). Additional analyses will determine if covariates (context of care, mobile 
device proficiency,  and dementia severity indicators) significantly vary across the SR tre atment 
and attention control groups at baseline and over 6 -months. If statistically significant variations 
between the SR treatment and control groups are found, baseline and/or change scores for these 
covariates will be included in all repeated measures a nalyses of covariance tests to provide 
additional statistical control.  
Variations in SR use and setting: Empi[INVESTIGATOR_673612] (e.g., frequen cy and 
duration of SR use) will be included as a series of additional analyses. These analyses will explore 
the effects of variations in SR use on the outcomes hypothesized above for PWMCs and their care 
partners.  
Phase II Qualitative Analysis:  The methods  described in Phase I Qualitative Analysis will be 
applied to the open -ended system review checklist responses, as well as the interviews gathered 
at the end of Phase II.  
Phase II mixed methods analysis : Researchers will apply a parallel convergent mixed m ethods 
design. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected and analyzed separately, and then 
paired side -by-side for comparison(10, 11). Quantitative analyses are expected to provide 
breadth in presenting group -level trends, while qualitative analy ses will provide insight into 
variation within these trends, and allow study participants to identify meaningful SR components 
for themselves. After independent quantitative and qualitative analyses, the results will be paired 
side by [CONTACT_673626]. Researchers will identify and iteratively discuss areas of convergence

 Page 34 of 49 Template Revised On: 11/1/2021       and divergence to validate the results(10 -13). The thematic codes and categories of 
implementation/use and mechanisms of benefit will be cross -tabulated with the empi[INVESTIGATOR_673613], converge, 
or highlight pathways toward additional questions and analysis(12, 13). This comparative, mixed 
method analysis approach may suggest how and why PWMCs experience the gre atest benefit 
while using the SRS.  
17.2 Power Analysis:  
 
Phase I: The purpose of Phase I is to evaluate feasibility and utility of the SR 
system, and to identify areas for potential improvement of the technology.  The 
sample size of 20 dyads is appropriate for these objectives.  
Phase II: A repeated measures ana lysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be utilized to 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_673614]. 
The number of PWMC -care partner dyads to be enrolled to address study 
hypotheses was determined using power analysis proce dures(45, 46). A sample 
size of [ADDRESS_910474] (standardized regression 
coefficient = 0.15) at a suitable level of statistical power (0.80 is considered an 
excellent power value) is able to effectively incorporate up to [ADDRESS_910475] (as random assignment is often used 
to ensure statistically comparable treatment and control conditions, we feel this is 
a conservative estimate of baseline covariates)(46). Specifically, we relied on 
statistical power tables by [CONTACT_673662](46) to conduct our 
assessment of power. As noted in Table 2 of Cohen (1992)(45), an alpha level of 
.05, a medium effec t size of .15 (as opposed to using specific measures, Cohen 
operationalized a medium effect size of .[ADDRESS_910476] size was close to the 
average of observed effects ), and a multiple regression model (similar to an 
ANCOVA) that includes up to [ADDRESS_910477] the Phase II efficacy evalu ation. We anticipate having less 
than a 3% attrition rate which will ensure we maintain sufficient power. As noted 
in various recommendations for mixed methods sampling, 20 participants is 
considered an adequate sample size for semi -structured interview pr otocols to 
ensure the richness and depth of open -ended data collected(36, 47).  
17.3   Statistical Analysis:  
Statistical analyses used will include calculation of frequencies, bivariate correlations, 
t-tests, chi -square tests, and repeated measures ANCOVA as detailed above.

VERSION DATE: 7/1/2022  
 Page 35 of 49 Template Revised On: 11/1/2021       Several steps will be taken to ensure data quality. The psychometric properties of the 
study measures are generally well -established; however, additional steps will be 
taken to ensure the reliability and validity of the study measures. For example, 
internal reliability will be established with Cronbach's alpha (α) estimates for each 
measure and subscale. In addition, construct validity will be comprehensively 
assessed with a confirmatory factor analysis. I n this particular method, individual 
items of each measure are loaded onto their latent construct. Indices of fit in 
structural equation models (e.g., Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = .05, 
Goodness of Fit Index =.97, Non -Normative Fit Index = .93 and Comparative Fit Index 
= .97; ‘excellent’ fit is demonstrated in models where p > .05, RMSEA < .05, GFI >.92, 
NNFI >.95 and CFI > .95)(32) then act as tests of significance for the construct validity 
of each measure. These procedures will help to establ ish the psychometric qualities 
of each tool beyond their utilization in prior study. Each outcome variable will be 
examined to determine if skewness exists or outliers are present. Normal probability 
plots and histograms of each dependent variable will be analyzed; this step is 
necessary because individual outcome variables must have near -normal distributions 
in order to be included in subsequent models. If the outcome variables are not 
normally distributed, the original variables can be subjected to algebr aic 
transformations or other standard transformation techniques to meet model 
assumptions(9).

study.  
 
In addition to ongoing review of protocol and human subjects research compliance during 
weekly project meetings with research staff, the  research coordinators and the  Co-Is ([CONTACT_673685], [CONTACT_673679], and [CONTACT_673682]) will generate q uarterly reports (every 3 months) 
and will randomly audit [ADDRESS_910485] (IRB) requirements, including use of IRB -approved forms 
(particularly the verbal consent form) and that each staff person on the proposed project 
adheres to the study protocol.  In both weekly meetings and quarterly audit reports, the 
Co-Is will actively work with project staff to minimize research -associated risk and protect 
confidentiality of participant data ( see Protection of Human Research Subjects).  
 
The research coordinators and the  Co-Is, [CONTACT_131854], [CONTACT_673679], and [CONTACT_673682], (who 
have oversight for the data management and analysis of the project) , will produce a 
quarterly audit report that will hi ghlight the results of the audit analysis as well as study 
progress.  In addition, the report will provide information on any deviations from the 
approved protocol (e.g., deviations in adhering to study eligibility criteria), error rates, and 
any other iss ues related to the progress of the study.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_673615], and will work with the Co -Is if needed, to ascertain if 
audited cases deviate from the approved study protocol.  Audit reports are described i n 
more detail below.  
 
As noted above, the proposed study involves no invasive procedures and there will be no 
physical risks to study participants. The consideration of need is potentially stressful, and 
thus there are possible psychological risks for PWMC  and their care partners. However, 
potential participants with a history of serious mental illness (i.e., any major psychiatric 
disorder) will not be included in the study and since the research team has considerable

staff will be trained to interview in ways that are non -threatening, friendly, and respectful.  
We will emphasize to all participants that they do not have to complete any question they 
do not want to answer, and that the interview may be terminated at any time accordin g 
to their wishes.  We will stress to participants that their decision to discontinue the study 
will in no way affect the services they are receiving from the University of Minnesota or 
other entities.  
 
In the event a participant does become upset during t he interview process, research staff 
will contact [CONTACT_978], who will be available for consultation.  If a participant is in crisis 
because of their care situation or some other reason, research staff will be instructed to 
consult with the PI.  With the parti cipant’s permission, we will then contact [CONTACT_673664] (e.g., the Alzheimer’s Association).  
Based on the research team’s experience working with persons with dementia their 
caregiving families, we expect no or very  few such instances to occur.  If a member of the 
research team does identify neglect or other potentially inappropriate care practices, the 
state Ombudsman will be notified to protect the rights of persons with dementia and their 
families.

 Page 41 of 49 Template Revised On: 11/1/[ADDRESS_910488] for NIH -Supported Multicenter Trials (as suggested in the Policy of the National 
Institute of Nursing Resea rch for Data and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Trials), the definition of 
each event is as follows:  
Adverse event .  Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
participant which does not necessarily have to have a causal relation ship with the 
treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of [an intervention], whether or not considered r elated to the 
[interventions].  
Serious adverse event .  Any adverse experience that results in any of the following 
outcomes: death, a life threatening experience, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital  anomaly/birth defect. Important medical 
events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be 
considered a serious adverse drug experience when based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may require medical or sur gical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.  
Unexpected .  Any adverse experience, the specificity or severity of which is not consistent 
with the risks information described in the protocol or consent documents.  
Related to ( or associated with) the intervention.   There is a reasonable possibility that the 
experience may have been caused by [CONTACT_25234].  
Causality .  A reasonable possibility that the product is etiologically related to the adverse 
event. Causality assessment  includes, for example, assessment of temporal relationships, 
dechallenge/rechallenge information, association with (or lack of association with) 
underlying disease, presence (or absence) of a more likely cause, plausibility, etc.  
In the instance of an adv erse event, the Co -Is will classify whether the event is unexpected, 
adverse, or seriously adverse, whether the event is unexpected or related to the intervention, 
and what potentially caused the event.  The Co -Is will review study -related data on an ongoi ng 
basis and will alert the PI, University of Minnesota IRB, and the NIA program officer as well as NIA 
if these events occur.  Specifically, the Co -Is will utilize an adverse event form that will provide 
detail on the occurrence (who, what, when, where, w hy if relevant) of any adverse, serious 
adverse, unexpected/unanticipated event and whether these events were related to the 
Smartwatch Reminder system.  All adverse event reports and any additional documentation will 
be further provided and collated in th e quarterly audit reports for review by [CONTACT_978], University of

22.1  Consent Process (when consent will be obtained):  
 
In Phase I, care partners and PWMC will ta ke part in a brief consent and enrollment procedure via 
Zoom, during the first hour of the dyadic interview. The research staff will read the verbal 
consent form verbatim over Zoom to the care partners, and give them the opportunity to ask 
questions prior to consenting to participate. Care partners will be asked to provide verbal consent 
to participate after the consent form is read to them verbatim. Completed consent forms will be 
emailed to care partners and PWMC for their records. In Phase II, care partners will be asked to 
provide verbal  consent to participate. After volunteering to participate, the RA will sc hedule a 
brief screening, consent and enrollment procedure to take place either  via Zoom or telephone.  
In Phase I and II, we will use the UCSD Brief Assessment of Capacity to Consent (UBACC) to 
determine whether PWMC participants are capable of providin g consent for themselves. In phase 
I, we will also administer a cognitive screening test called the Mini -Cog to screen for presence of 
dementia. In Phase I, these will be administered via Zoom. The UCSD Brief Assessment of 
Capacity to Consent will be admin istered verbally, as usual in Phases I and II. In Phase II, 
individuals with a UBACC score of 14.[ADDRESS_910490] size. Those with a Mini -Cog score of 3 or higher and are 
able to provide consent personally will be asked to provide verbal consent for Phase I.  Those 
who are not able to pr ovide consent personally or with a Mini -Cog score of 2 or below will be 
asked to assent to participate. In that case, assent will be documented by [CONTACT_673665] I  (attached). In P hase I, the

has been summarized for them over the phone. Given the nature of administering the UBACC and 
the consent/assent process for PWMC, they can only p rovide consent/assent over the phone or 
Zoom.  
 
Due to the natural progression of AD/ADRD and the length of the study, PWMC will be reassessed 
for their capacity to consent and re -assent or re -consent to participate in the research at 3 - and 
6-month time p oints.  We will read a script to the CP over the telephone to communicate our 
follow -up procedures.  We will then use the UCSD Brief Assessment of Capacity to Consent to 
determine whether PWMC  are capable of providing consent for themselves. Those who are no t 
able to provide consent will be asked to re -assent to participate, in which case, assent will be 
documented by [CONTACT_673666] (attached). Those who are 
able to provide consent will be asked to re -consent to partici pate using the brief follow -up

the 3 or 6-month PWMC reassent/consent), a brief Informed Particpation statement will be read 
to the Care Partner and Person with Memory Concerns, then allowing each of them to ask 
questions or decide not to participate. If needed, the research coordinator or research assistant 
will resend the  3 or 6 month consent/re -assent form for full details.

members for recruitment purposes, including family members of diverse ethnic or racial 
origin and geographic location (given that many provide care to under -represented older 
persons). I n addition, [CONTACT_283805] has conducted several prior and ongoing evaluations of 
early -stage dementia support programs throughout the Minneapolis/St. Paul area and works 
with several memory clubs and programs for PWMC. [CONTACT_283805] will contact [CONTACT_673672], in addition to the early -stage services coordinator at the Minnesota -North Dakota 
Alzheimer’s Association Regional Office with whom he has collaborated to further identify 
PWMCs and their care partners for the proposed project.  [CONTACT_283805] also h olds an annual 
Caring For Persons with Memory Loss Conference where participants will be recruited. [CONTACT_283804] also directs the Center for Healthy Aging and Innovation which hosts events among 
our target population, which may also be used for recruitment.  Participants may also be 
recruited via ads on Facebook or in newspapers.  Finally, [CONTACT_283805] is a member of the Care 
Options Network, and will post an invitation to participate to Network members.  
 
In Phase I, interaction with participants will take place in a HIPAA -compliant video 
conferencing platform, Zoom. In Phase II, interaction with participants will take place via

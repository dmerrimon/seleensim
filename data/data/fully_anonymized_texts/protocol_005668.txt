Version and Date of Protocol  Comments  
Version 2.0, 13 April 2018  
Version 3.0, 19 July 2018  Current version  
 
Key changes in the current version of the protocol are summarized below. 
Change and Rationale  Affected Sections  
Removed G6PD deficiency and history of hemolysis as exclusion 
criteria.  Table 3-1, Sections 8.2, [IP_ADDRESS],
Updated language to reflect the current regulatory status of 
Symdeko.  Sections 5.1 and 9.3.2 
Updated study drug interruption and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]; removal of 
exclusion due to G6PD deficiency makes separate interruption 
criterion based solely on serum bilirubin levels unnecessary.  Section 9.8.1 
 
Typographical and administrative changes were also made to improve the clarity of the document.

Assessments  Efficacy: Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], documentation of events related to health outcomes (e.g., PEx), CFQ -R, 
height (for subjects ≤21 years of age only), and weight  
PD: SwCl 
Safety: AEs, clinical laboratory assessments, ECGs, vital signs, pulse oximetry, physical 
examinations, and ophthalmologic examinations (for subjects <18 years of age)  
PK: VX-445, TEZ, M1- TEZ, and IVA plasma concentrations  
  
Statistical 
Analyses The primary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week  4. The 
primary null hypothesis to be tested is that the mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline 
is the same for the 2  treatment groups, VX -445/TEZ/IVA and placebo. The null hypothesis will 
be tested at an overall 2 -sided significance level of 0.05.  
An interim analysis (IA) is planned when at least [ADDRESS_1078373] of the 
study, and the results will be reviewed by [CONTACT_82571] (IDMC). A Lan and DeMets alpha spending fu nction will be applied to control the overall type  I error 
rate of 0.05 for the primary endpoints during the IA and the final analysis such that an alpha of 0.01 will be preserved for the final analysis. If the number of subjects included in the IA is 140, then the primary endpoint of the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV
1 at Week 4 will be 
tested at a significance level of 0.044 during the IA. The actual alpha at the IA ( α0) will be 
determined based on the actual number of subjects included in the IA.  Assuming a within- group 
SD of 7 percentage points and a 5% dropout rate at Week  4, an IA sample size of [ADDRESS_1078374] approximately 98% power to detect a difference between the treatment groups of 5.[ADDRESS_1078375] at a significance level of 0.044.  
If the P value for the primary endpoint at the IA is less than  α0, then the efficacy boundary has 
been crossed. If the IDMC declares that the study has crossed the efficacy boundary, then the study may be unblinded to a limited Vertex team to prepare regulatory submission(s). Members of the limited Vertex unblinded team will not be involved in or influence the conduct of the remaining part of the study to protect the integrity of the study.  
If the P value fails to cross the efficacy boundary during the IA, then the primary endpoint of 
absolute change in ppFEV
1 from baseline at Week  4 will be tested after all subjects complete 
study participation at an alpha of 0.01. Assuming a within -group SD of 7 percentage points and 
a 5% dropout rate at Week  4 and 10% dropout rate at Week  24, a final analysis sample size of 
[ADDRESS_1078376] approximately 99% power  to detect a difference 
between the treatment groups of 5.[ADDRESS_1078377] at a significance level of 0.01.  
The analysis of the primary endpoint during the IA will be based on a mixed -effects model for 
repeated measures (MMRM) with the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 at Day 15 and 
Week 4 as the dependent variable. During the final analysis, the same model will be 
implemented, including all availab le data. The model will include treatment group, visit, and 

Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 6 of 73 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   
 treatment -by-visit interaction as fixed effects; with sex (male versus female), continuous 
baseline ppFEV 1, and age at screening (<18 versus ≥18  years of age) as covariates; and with an 
unstructured covariance structure for the within -subject errors.  
The primary result obtained from the model will be the estimated treatment difference at 
Week 4. The adjusted mean difference at Week  4 with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals and 
2-sided P values will be provided. Furthermore, the adjusted mean and treatment difference at 
each post -baseline visit, obtained from the model at the final analysis, will also be provided.  
The key secondary endpoints will be formally tested only during the final analysis when all subjects complete study participation, at the significance level of 0.05, if the primary endpoint 
is statistically significant at either the IA or at the final analysis.  
The safety endpoints include AEs, clinical laboratory values, ECGs, vital  signs, and pulse 
oximetry through the Safety Follow -up Visit. The safety analysis will be descriptive only.  
  
IDMC Reviews  An IDMC will conduct periodic planned safety review(s) of study data and the planned efficacy 
IA, as outlined in the IDMC charter.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Background  
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive chronic disease with serious morbidities and 
frequent premature mortality. At present, there is no cure. CF affects approximately 
70,000 individuals worldwide1 (approximately 30,000 in the US1,2 and 39,000 in the EU3). Based 
on its prevalence, CF qualifies as an orphan disease .4, 5 
CF is caused by [CONTACT_155412]/or function of the CFTR protein due to mutations in the CFTR gene. The CFTR protein is an epi[INVESTIGATOR_663607], including the lungs, pancreas, and other gastrointestinal organs. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_460360], the predicted median age of survival for a person with CF is 
approximately [ADDRESS_1078390] common disease- causing CFTR mutation, F508del , accounts for 70% of the identified 
alleles in people with CF8, and approximately 40% of people with CF are homozygous for 
F508del (F/F) .2, 3, [ADDRESS_1078391] been developed to address the decreased quantity and/or function of CFTR in order to enhance chloride transport in patients with CF. Correctors facilitate the cellular processing and trafficking to increase the q uantity of functional CFTR at the cell 
surface. Potentiators increase the channel open probability of the CFTR  protein delivered to the 
cell surface to enhance ion transport. Depending on the amount of residual CFTR channel 
activity in the membrane, and the pathophysiology of that activity (reflecting the CFTR genotype 
of the patient and possibly other factors), both approaches may be required. 
The therapeutic activity of CFTR correctors and potentiators has been established with products 
that were developed by [CONTACT_155413]: ivacaftor (IVA) monotherapy (Kalydeco
®), and lumacaftor (LUM) in combination with IVA (Orkambi®). 
Kalydeco and Orkambi are approved to treat CF in patients with specific CFTR genotypes. A 
second corrector/p otentiator combination, tezacaftor (TEZ)/IVA (Symdeko®) is approved in 
certain countries.  
VX-445 is a next-generation CFTR corrector being developed for administration in triple combination (TC) with TEZ/IVA for the treatment of CF.  
5.2 Rationale for the Pre sent Study  
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of VX -445 in TC with TEZ/IVA in subjects with 
CF who are heterozygous for  F508del (F) and a second CFTR allele carrying a minimal function 
(MF) mutation that is non -responsive to TEZ, IVA, or TEZ/ IVA (refer to Appendix  A for MF 
mutations). Patients with this genotype (F/MF) usually have severe disease and lack approved 
CFTR modulator therapy; previous studies with TEZ /IVA (Study  VX14-661-107) and 
LUM/IVA (Study  VX09-809-102) failed to demonstrate efficacy in this patient population. Due 
to this high unmet need, VX-445 is being developed in TC with TEZ/IVA for F/MF subjects. The potential for benefit in these patients is supported by [CONTACT_155414] F/MF 

Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 21 of 73 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   subjects; in addition, the TC of VX- 445/TEZ/IVA is generally safe and well tolerated (refer to 
VX-445 Investigator ’s Brochure).

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   9.1.1 Screening 
The Screening Period (Day  -28 through Day -1) will occur within [ADDRESS_1078398] dose of 
study drug. 
Screening assessments will be used to confirm that subjects meet the eligibility criteria. The 
investigator (or an appropriate authorized designee) will obtain informed consent and assent, if applicable, from each subject before any study procedure takes place.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Repetition of Screening Assessment(s)  
Screening assessments may be repeated once to establish study eligibility.  If repeat values of the 
individual assessment(s) are within the eligibility criteria and completed within the screening window, then the subject is eligible for the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Rescreening  
Subjects may be rescreened once. If a subject is rescreened, all screening assessments will be 
repeated, except for:  
• CFTR genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
• Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level (if serum FSH  level was in the postmenopausal 
range as determined by [CONTACT_577231]) 
• G6PD activity test  
• Ophthalmologic examination (if performed within 3  months of the date of informed consent, 
for subjects <18 years of age )  
If a subject is rescreened, a new screening window will begin when the first rescreening assessment has been initiated.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Extension of Screening Period Window  
A subject may have the Screening Period window extended by 2 weeks for the following reasons: 
• Repetition of the Screening Period assessments (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) 
• Unexpected operational or logistic delays, or to meet the eligibility criteria  
• Scheduling of ophthalmologic examination (for subjects <18 years of age on the date of 
informed consent, Section 11.7.6)

provided in Section 9.6. 

Protocol VX17-445-102, Version [ADDRESS_1078400] prematurely discontinues study drug treatment, an Early Termination of Treatment 
(ETT) Visit should be scheduled as soon as possible aft er the decision to discontinue treatment. 
Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment will also be required to complete the Safety Follow-up Visit, approximately [ADDRESS_1078401] the Safety Follow -up Visit, and a separate Safety Follow -up Visit will not be 
required. 
Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment will continue to complete all 
scheduled study visits for assessments following completion of the ETT Visit, as detailed in Table 3-2.  Data regarding concomitant antibiotic therapy for sinopulmonary signs/symptoms will 
also continue to be collected for these subjects.  
If a subject withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent or assent, no further 
assessments will be performed. Vertex may retain and continue to use any data and samples collected before such withdrawal of consent or ass ent. 
9.1.[ADDRESS_1078402] to follow-up if both of the following occur: 
• The subject misses 2  consecutive study visits (telephone contact [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or clinic visit) and is 
subsequently unable to be contact[CONTACT_5143] (3 documente d attempts by [CONTACT_155417] 2 weeks following the second missed visit) 
• The subject does not respond within [ADDRESS_1078403] is defined as one of the following: 

Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 27 of 73 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • For subjects who complete the Treatment Period and enter an open- label study within 
28 days of the Week  24 Visit: the Week  24 Visit  
• For subjects who complete the Treatment Period and do not enter an open- label study within 
28 days of the Week  24 Visit: the Safety Follow -up Visit 
• For subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment but do not withdraw consent 
(and assent, as applicable): the latest of the Week  24 Visit, ETT Visit, or S afety Follow -up 
Visit (if required)  
• For subjects who withdraw consent or assent: date of withdrawal of consent or assent, 
whichever is earlier ( Section 9.9) 
If subjects are lost to follow -up (Section 9.1.5) , the date of completion of study participation  will 
be defined as the date of the last contact.  
The end of study is defined in Section 13.2.8. 
9.1.7 Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_82571] (IDMC), which will 
conduct periodic planned safety review(s) of study data and the planned efficacy interim analysis (IA) (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) . Procedural details of the IDMC structure and function, frequency of 
meetings, and data planned for review will be included in the IDMC charter. The IDMC charter will be finalized before the first subject is screened.  
9.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to the TC VX-445/TEZ/IVA arm or to the triple placebo arm. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_66763]
1 determined during the Screening Period (<70 versus 
≥70), age at the Screening Visit (<18 versus ≥18 years of age), and sex (male versus female).  
An interactive web response system (IWRS) will be used to assign subjects to treatment. The randomization code list will be produced by [CONTACT_155418] a qualified randomization vendor. 
9.3 Rationale for Study Design and Study Drug Regimens  
9.3.1 Study Design 
This Phase 3 study will assess the efficacy, safety, PD, and PK of VX-445/TEZ/IVA TC therapy 
in subjects with CF who have F/MF genotypes.  
A randomized, double-blind, controlled study design was selected to ascertain the effects of 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA while avoiding observer bias. Placebo is considered the appropriate comparator because efficacy has not been established for a corrector, potentiator, or any corrector/potentiator combination in subjects with F/MF genotypes .  
This study will have a 24-week treatment duration to allow for the collection of placebo-controlled safety data for this duration and the collection of data for outcomes that 
require longer tre atment durations to demonstrate an effect (e.g., PEx and changes in nutritional 
status).  
The primary endpoint is the absolute change in ppFEV
1 at Week 4. Previous studies of CFTR 
modulators (IVA, LUM/IVA, and TEZ/IVA) have demonstrated that efficacy related to lung 

Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 28 of 73 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   function (ppFEV 1) can be reliably established using an endpoint at Week 4. In these studies, 
rapid improvements in ppFEV 1 are observed by [CONTACT_2006]  15, with a separation between the active 
treatment and placebo groups that is sustained through 24 weeks of treatment. These studies 
were conducted in patients with different genotypes, baseline ppFEV 1, and age groups, using 
CFTR modulators that had different magnitudes of response. 
9.3.2 Study Drug Dose  
VX-445 Dosage  
A VX-445 dose of 200 mg qd was selected for the current study based on an assessment of the 
benefit-risk profile from the Phase  2 Study VX16-445-001 (Study 445-001) Part D, which 
evaluated a range of VX -445 doses (50 mg qd, 100 mg qd, and 200 mg qd) in TC with TEZ/IVA 
for 4 weeks in subjects with F/ MF genotypes. The TC was generally safe and well tolerated in all 
VX-445 dose groups, and F/MF subjects who received the VX-445 200 mg qd TC demonstrated 
a clinically meaningful improvement in ppFEV 1 (within-group mean [SE] absolute change of 
13.8 [1.4] percentage points from baseline [ P<0.0001], compared with a mean absolute change 
of 0.0 [2.0] percentage points in subjects who received placebo [ P = 0.9943]).  
The dose-response relationship of VX-445 in TC was assessed for ppFEV 1 and SwCl for F/MF 
patients using population-PK/PD modeling. Results indicate that a dose of 200 mg qd provides meaningful improvement for ppFEV
1 and SwCl, while a dose less than 200 mg qd may result in 
some subjects having suboptimal improvement in CFTR function. No differences in the safety profile of VX -445/TEZ/IVA were observed across the doses.  
TEZ and IVA Dosages 
TEZ will be administered as 100  mg qd and IVA will be administered as 150 mg q12h. This is 
the approved dosing regimen for Symdeko, which is approved in certain countries . 
Dosage for Subjects Aged 12 to 17 Years  
Phase 3 studies with IVA and TEZ/IVA have demonstrated similar exposures between adults 
(≥18 years old) and adolescent subjects ≥12 to <18 years of age. Significant differences in 
VX-445, TEZ, and IVA exposures are not expected between adolescent subjects and adults in the present study; therefore, all subjects will receive the same dose of VX -445/TEZ/IVA.  
9.3.3 Rationale for Study Population 
This study will enroll subjects with CF with F/MF genotypes. As described in Section 5.2, 
patients with F/MF genotypes have unmet need and are expected to respond to a TC regimen of VX-445/TEZ/IVA based on results from a Phase 2 study conducted in F/MF subjects, in vitro experiments in relevant human F/MF cell -based model systems, and results from ongoing 
Phase 2 studies with VX -445/TEZ/IVA.  
Given the progressive nature of CF, there is a strong rati onale for treating patients earlier in life. 
Experience with CFTR modulators in adolescent subjects ≥12 to <18 years of age, including with TEZ/IVA, suggests that the exposures and safety profile of VX-445/TEZ/IVA will be similar in adolescents and adults,  which supports evaluation of VX-445/TEZ/IVA in adolescents 
in the present study.

documentation for medications taken within 56 days before the Screening Visit through 
completion of study participation, as defined in Section 9.1.6. 
For subjects who are screened but are not subsequently randomized, details of prior medication 
will be documented only in the subjects’ source documents. 
• Subjects should remain on a stable treatment regimen for their CF from [ADDRESS_1078408] 28 days 
before the Day  1 Visit. Subjects should not initiate long- term treatment with new medication 
from 28 days before the Day  1 Visit through completion of study participation . Guidelines 
for stable treatment regimens for CF are as follows: 
o Subjects who are taking inhaled tobramycin or other chronically inhaled antibiotics should remain on that regimen throughout the study. 
o Subjects who cycle onto and off of an inhaled antibiotic should continue on their prior 
schedule. The timing of the first dose of study drug on the Day 1 Visit should be synchronized as closely as possible (e.g., not more than ± 3 days) to the first day in the cycle onto the inhaled antibiotic. 

Protocol VX17-445-102, Version [ADDRESS_1078409] dose of study drug on the Day 1 Visit should be synchronized as closely as possible (e.g., not more than 
± 3 days) to the first day in the cycle onto 1 of the inhaled antibiotics. 
• Subjects may receive doses of prednisone or prednisolone of up to 10 mg/day chronically, or 
up to 60 mg daily for up to 5 days.  
• Information about bronchodilator use during the study will be collected and documented. Subjects who are using a bronchodilator must have their spi[INVESTIGATOR_155393] 11.6.1.

1. It is recommended that the dose be taken within 30 minutes of the start of the meal or snack. 
2. Study drug will be administered as 2 fixed -dose combination (FDC) TC or placebo tablets in 
the morning and as [ADDRESS_1078411], doses of study drugs will be taken at approximately the same time (±  2 hours) each day.  
3. The date, amount taken, and time of study drug administration, including whether food was taken with each dose, will be recorded for the 2 doses before PK sample collection and the dose received on the morning of PK sample collection. 
4. On days of scheduled visits, the morning dose of study drug (TC or placebo) will be administered at the site after predose assessments have been completed. A meal or snack will be provided by [CONTACT_784160]. 
5. If a subject ’s scheduled visit is to occur in the afternoon, the following guidelines must be 
used: 
• If the dose in the clinic will be within [ADDRESS_1078412]’s scheduled morning dose, 
the subject should withhold their morning dose of TC or placebo and the morning dose 
will be administered in the clinic.  
• If the dose in the clinic will be more than [ADDRESS_1078413]’s scheduled morning 
dose, the subject should take the morning dose of TC or placebo at home.  
• At the Day  1, Day 15, and Week [ADDRESS_1078414]- dose ECG assessments or PK sampling (as 
applicable) relative to the morning dose. 
6. Subjects will be instructed to bring all used and unused materials associated with the study drug to the site; study drug will be dispensed at e ach visit, as appropriate.

[CONTACT_66768] [ADDRESS_1078421] the tests repeated and sent to the central laboratory as soon as possible (ideally within 48 to 72 hours). 
Study drug administration must be interrupted immediately (prior to confirmatory testing) if 
any of the following criteria are met: 
• ALT or AST >8  × ULN 
• ALT or AST >5  × ULN for more than 2 weeks  
• ALT or AST >3  × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2  × ULN and/or clinical jaundice 
A thorough investigation of potential causes should be conducted, and the subject should be followed closely for clinical progression.

alcohol ingestion) is identified, regardless of whether transaminase levels have improved 
All subjects in whom treatment is discontinued for elevated transaminases (and bilirubin, as 
applicable) should have these levels monitored closely until levels normalize or return to baseline. 
If an alternative, reversible cause of transaminase elevation with or without increased bilirubin or clinical jaundice has been identified, study drug administration  may be resumed once 
transaminases return to baseline or are ≤2  × ULN, whichever is higher. Regardless of the 
duration of interruption, the medical monitor should be notified prior to resumption of study drug. Upon resumption of study drug, transaminases and bilirubin should be assessed weekly for 4 weeks. If a pr otocol-defined transaminase elevation interruption threshold recurs within 
4 weeks of rechallenge with the study drug (with confirmation of the initial elevation by [CONTACT_94525] 48  to 72 hours), then the study drug must be permanently discontinued, regardless 
of the presumed etiology.

In addition, a subject must be discontinued from study drug treatment if the subject meets any of 
the following criteria:  
• Has a screening CFTR genotype that does not confirm study eligibility if a previous CFTR 
genotype laboratory report was used to establ ish eligibility. These subjects must be 
discontinued from the study ( Section 8.1)  
• Meets any of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (discontinuation) criteria ( Section 9.8)  
• Becomes pregnant ( Section [IP_ADDRESS])  
Subjects who discontinue study drug treatment should return for study assessments, as noted in Section 9.1.3. 

Protocol VX17-445-102, Version [ADDRESS_1078425](s), request that the subject return for an ETT Visit and Safety Follow-up Visit, if applicable (see Section 9.1.3), and follow up with the subject regarding any 
unresolved AEs. 
If the subject withdraws consent or assent for the study, no further assessments will be 
performed. Vertex may retain and continue using the study data and samples after the study is over, and may use the samples and information in the development of the study compound, and for other drugs and diagnostics, in publications and presentations, and for education purposes. If the subject withdraws from the study, the study data and samples collected will remain part of the study. A subject will not be able to request the withdrawal of his/her information from the study data. A subject may request destruction of the samples collected from him/her during the study as long as those samples can be identified as his/her sample s.

10.7 Blinding and Unblinding 
This will be a double-blind study. 

Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 36 of 73 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   10.7.1 Blinding  
All subjects (and their parents/caregivers/companions), site personnel (including the investigator, 
the site monitor, and the study team), and members of the Vertex study team will be blinded to the treatment codes.  
Individuals who may be unblinded include only the following: 
• Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the subject 
in the event of a life- threatening medical emergency  
• Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the subject and her fetus in the event of a pregnancy 
• Vertex Global Patient Safety (GPS) and Regulatory Affairs personnel to satisfy serious adverse event (SAE) processing and reporting regulations 
• Vendor preparing the final (production) randomization list 
• Vertex IWRS  Manager  
• Vertex Clinical Supply Chain  
• IDMC 
• External independent biostatistician preparing the unblinded analysis for review by [CONTACT_31849] 
• Bioanalytical contract research organization (CRO) analyzing PK samples and the Vertex Bioanalytical personnel who is not a member of the study team but reviews raw data from the 
Bioanalytical CRO. The Vertex Bioanalytical study team member will continue to be blinded. 
• Vendor for modeling and simulations performing population PK modeling in preparation for regulatory submission(s) 
For the purpose of regulatory submissions, a limited Vertex team may be unblinded to the IA if the IDMC declares that the study has crossed the efficacy boundary ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]) . Members 
of the limited Vertex unblinded team will not be involved in or influence the conduct of the remaining part of the study to protect the integrity of the study.  
Access to Spi[INVESTIGATOR_155395] : 
During the conduct of the study, the Vertex study team will not have access to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_784154] 1.  
Shortly before any planned efficacy analysis is conducted, the spi[INVESTIGATOR_784155] a cleaning purposes by a biostatistician who does not have access to the 
treatment codes.  
Individual SwCl test results will not be disclosed to the study sites with the exception of the screening values. Subjects and their parents/caregivers/companions should not be informed of study-related spi[INVESTIGATOR_784156] 
(i.e., clinical study report [CSR] finalization), regardless of whether the subject has prematurely discontinued treatment. 

Protocol VX17-445-102, Version [ADDRESS_1078429]’ s treatment by [CONTACT_14450]’ s study treatment is 
necessary for clinical management. In such cases, investigators will use their best judgment as to whether to unblind without first attempting to contact [CONTACT_14451]. If investigators deem it not necessary to unblind immediately, they will first attempt to contact [CONTACT_14451]. If investigators have tried but are unable to reach the medical monitor, they will use their best judgment, based on the nature and urgency of the clinical situation, and may proceed with unblinding without having successfully reached and discussed the situation with the medical monitor. In case of emergency, the investigator will have the final decision and unilateral right for unblinding. 
Contact [CONTACT_14452] (or appropriate backup) will be provided in a 
separate document.  
In addition, the Vertex Medical Information Call Center ( ) will answer calls 
[ADDRESS_1078430] ’s treatment assignment has been unblinded for a medical emergency or urgent 
clinical situation, the medical monitor will be notified within [ADDRESS_1078431]’ s study file. 
Information about the treatment assignment obtained from the unblinding will be maintained in a 
secure location with controlled access and will not be shared with the sponsor (Vertex), CRO, or any site personnel (other than the physician treating the subject). In addition, the investigator will 
consider whether the clinical event that prompted unblinding will be considered an SAE, according to the regulatory defini tions or criteria for SAEs, and if so, submit an SAE report to 
Vertex GPS or designee, per Section 13.1.2. 
Unblinding of Individual Subject Treatme nt Assignments by [CONTACT_784162]. In addition, Vertex may, for matters relating to safety concerns, unblind individual subjects at any time.

9.9). 

Protocol VX17-445-102, Version [ADDRESS_1078442] (Screening Period Only) : A blood sample will be collected for a quantitative 
G6PD activity assay, which will be performed in an established laboratory that runs the assay 
routinely. The use of a local laboratory that routinely runs the assay is permissible following approval by [CONTACT_7195].  
Additional Evaluations: Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be perf ormed at other 
times if judged to be clinically appropriate.  
For the purposes of study conduct and unless noted otherwise (e.g., G6PD activity test), only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be used. Local laboratories may be used at the discretion of the local investigator for management of urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically significant, it will be verified by [CONTACT_784165]. If it is 
not possible to send a timely specimen to the central laboratory (e.g., the subject was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94248]), the investigator may base the assessment of an AE on the local laboratory value.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   To ensure the safety of the subjects, a qualified indi vidual at the study site will make 
comparisons to baseline measurements. If the QTcF is increased by >60  msec from the baseline 
or an absolute QTcF value is ≥500 msec for any scheduled ECG, 2 additional ECGs will be 
performed approximately 2 to 4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If either of the QTcF values from these repeated ECGs remains above the threshold value (>60  msec from 
baseline or ≥500 msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF values from 2 successive ECGs fall below the threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement. Further 
details pertaining to ECGs will be provided to sites in the ECG Manual.  
11.7.6 Ophthalmologic  Examination 
Ophthalmologic examinations will be conducted only for subjects who are <[ADDRESS_1078446] and will include: 
• measurement of the best -corrected distance visual acuity of each eye; and  
• pharmacologically dilated examination of the lens with a slit lamp  
The screening examination does not need to be conducted if there is documentation of an 
examination meeting the protocol requirements that was conducted within 3 months before the 
date of informed consent. 
In addition to the screening ophthalmologic examination, subjects who are <[ADDRESS_1078447] a single ophthalmologic examination at completion of study participation (defined in Section 9.1.6), except for those subjects who have withdrawn consent or assent. This 
examination should be completed within [ADDRESS_1078448]

12 STATISTICAL AND ANAL YTICAL PLANS  
This section presents a summary of the planned analyses for thi s protocol. Statistical analysis 
details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), and clinical pharmacologic analysis 
details will be provided in the clinical pharmacology analysis plan (CPAP), both of which will be finalized before the cli nical data lock for the study and treatment unblinding. 
12.1 Sample Size and Power  
Approximately 360 subjects will be enrolled and randomized (1:1) to the TC VX-445/TEZ/IVA arm or the triple placebo arm. This sample size was determined to provide adequate power for the key secondary endpoint of number of PEx through Week 24. Information regarding the powering of primary and key secondary endpoints is provided below. 
Power for Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change in ppFEV
1 from baseline at Week  4. The 
primary null hypothesis to be tested is that the mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline is 
the same for the 2  treatment groups, VX-445/TEZ/IVA and placebo. If the number of subjects 
included in the IA is 140, the null hypothesis will be tested at a 2 -sided significance level of 
0.044 during the IA and at an overall 2-sided significance level of 0.05. 
Assuming a within -group SD of 7 percentage points and a 5% dropout rate at Week 4, an IA

software Version  6.4. 
Power for Selected Key Secondary Endpoints  
A key secondary endpoint is the absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline through Week 24. 
Assuming a within -group SD of 7 percentage points and a 10% dropout rate at Week 24, a 
sample size of [ADDRESS_1078463] approximately 99% power to detect a difference between the treatment groups of 5.[ADDRESS_1078464] at a significance 
level of 0.05. 
Another key secondary endpoint is the number of PEx through Week 24. Assuming a rate of PEx 
for the placebo group of 0.6 over 24 weeks and a 10% dropout rate, with [ADDRESS_1078465] a 40% reduction in the PEx rate for TC group compared to placebo group is approximately 80%, based on a 2-sided, 2-sample negative binomial regression model test for the ratio of rates, at a significance level 
of 0.05.  
12.2 Analysis Sets  
The following analysis sets are defined: All Subjects Set, Full Analysis Set (FAS), and Safety 
Set.  
The All Subjects Set  will include all subjects who were randomized or received at least [ADDRESS_1078466] 1  dose of study drug. The Safety 
Set will be used for all safety analyses in which subjects will be  analyzed according to the 
treatment they received, unless otherwise specified . 
Additional analysis sets related to the interim analysis will be described in the SAP.  
12.3 Statistical Analysis  
12.3.1 General Considerations  
Continuous variables  will be summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics: 
the number of subjects (n), mean, SD, median, minimum value (min), and maximum value 
(max). The precision of the measurement for each continuous variable will be specified in the SAP. Unless otherwise specified, min and max values will be reported with the same precision as 

Protocol VX17-445-102, Version [ADDRESS_1078467] units (metric or SI) will be converted 
with the appropriate precision. 
Categorical variables  will be summarized using counts and percentages. Percentages will be 
presented to [ADDRESS_1078468] recent non -missing 
measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of study drug. For ECG, 
baseline will be defined as the most recent pretreatment measurement (or the average of triplicate measurements, if the most recent pretreatment measurement is obtained in triplicate) before the first dose of study drug.  
Absolute change  from baseline will be calculated as post -baseline value – baseline value.  
The Treatment -emergent (TE) Period  will include the time from the first dose of study drug in 
the Treatment Period (TC or Placebo) to [ADDRESS_1078469] dose of the study drug or to the completion of study participation date (as defined in Section 9.1.6) , whichever occurs first.  
12.3.2 Background Characteristics  
[IP_ADDRESS] Subject Disposition  
The number and percentage of subjects in each disposition category (e.g., randomized, included in the FAS, included in the Safety Set, completed Treatment Period, completed study, prematurely discontinued treatment or study with a breakdown of the reasons for discontinuation, and entered an open- label study) will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_6490].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic, medical history, and baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive 
summary statistics.  
The following demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_460419] (but are not limited to): sex, race, baseline age, 
baseline weight, baseline height, baseline BMI, baseline ppFEV
1, and baseline SwCl.  
Medical history will be summarized by [CONTACT_7204] (SOC) and Preferred  
Term (PT) for the FAS.  
No statistical tests will be performed to evaluate baseline imbalance between treatment groups.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug-Dictionary and categorized as follo ws: 
• Prior medication:  any medication that was administered during the 56 days before initial 
dosing of study drug 
• Concomitant medication:  medication continued or newly received during the TE Period  
• Post-treatment medication:  medication continued or newly r eceived after the TE  Period 

Protocol VX17-445-102, Version [ADDRESS_1078470]-treatment medication; both prior and concomitant; both concomitant and post- treatment; or 
prior, concomitant, and post- treatment. If a medication has a missing or partially missing 
start/end date or time and if it cannot be determined whether it was taken before the first dose of study drug, concomitantly during the TE Period, or after the TE Period, it will be considered in all [ADDRESS_1078471] data listing.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Drug Exposure and Compliance  
Study drug exposure will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_1570], based on the Safety Set in terms of the duration of treatment a subject received (in days), defined as the last day – the first day of study drug plus 1, regardless of study drug interruption. 
Study drug compliance will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_155426], 
and will be calculated as: 100  × [1 - (total number of days of study drug interruption) / (duration 
of study drug exposure in days)]. A study drug interruption on a given day is defined as an 
interruption of any study drug on that day. 
In addition, percentage of tablets taken will also be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_155427], and will be calculated as 100 × [(total number of tablets dispensed) – (total 
number of tablets returned) ] / (total number of tablets planned to be taken per day ×  duration of 
study drug exposure in days). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Important Protocol Deviations  
An important protocol deviation (IPD) is a deviation that may significantly affect the 
completeness, accuracy, or reliability of the study data or that may significantly affect a subject ’s 
rights, safety, or well-being. The rules for identifying an IPD will be described in the SAP.  
All IPDs will be provided in an individual subject data listing, and summarized, as appropriate. 
12.3.3 Efficacy and Pharmacodynamic Analysis  
The primary objective of the study is the evaluation of the efficacy of VX-445 in TC with TEZ 
and IVA. The analyses described in this section will be based on the FAS, unless otherwise specified.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Final Analysis  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Analysis of Primary Variables  
The primary efficacy variable is the absolute change in ppFEV
1 from baseline at Week  4. The 
analysis of this variable will be performed using a mixed -effects model for repeated measures 
(MMRM) with change from baseline at Day 15, Week 4, Week  8, Week 12, Week 16, and 
Week 24 as the dependent variable. The model will include treatment group, visit, and 
treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects, with continuous baseline ppFEV 1, age at screening 
(<18 versus ≥18 years of age) and sex (male versus female) as covariates. The model will be 
estimated using restricted maximum likelihood. Denominator degrees  of freedom for the F  test 
for fixed effects will be estimated using the Kenward -Roger approximation. An unstructured 
covariance structure will be used to model the within -subject errors. If the model estimation does 

Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 52 of 73 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   not converge, a compound symmetry covariance structure will be used instead. Conditional on 
the observed data and covariates, missing data will be assumed to be missing at random; consequently, no imputation of missing data will be performed.  
The primary result obtained from the model will be the estimated treatment difference at Week  4. 
The adjusted mean difference at Week  4 with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals and 2-sided 
P values will be provided. Furthermore, the adjusted mean and treatment difference at each 
post-baseline visit will also be provided, obtained from the model.  Sensitivity analyses for handling missing data will be described in the SAP.  
Supportive analyses and subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy variable will also be 
described in the SAP. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Analysis of Secondary Variables  
Analysis of Key Secondary Variables  
The key secondary efficacy variables include:  
• Absolute change in ppFEV 1 through Week  24: Analysis of this variable will be based on 
an MMRM model that is exactly the same as the primary efficacy variable. Data obtained 
from the Day 15, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, and Week [ADDRESS_1078472] through Week 24.   
• Number of PE x through Week  24: Analysis of this variable will be performed using a 
negative binomial regression model with a fixed effect for treatment, as well as continuous baseline ppFEV
1, age at screening (<18 versus ≥18 years of age), and sex (male versus 
female) as covariates . The logarithm of the subject-specific PEx analysis period duration 
(defined in the SAP) will be treated as the offset in the model.  
• Absolute  change in SwCl from baseline through Week  24: Analysis of this PD variable 
will be based on an MMRM model similar to the analysis of the primary efficacy variable. Data obtained from Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, and Week [ADDRESS_1078473] through Week 24. 
• Absolute change in the CFQ -R respi[INVESTIGATOR_315423] 24: Analysis of this domain will be based on an MMRM model similar to the analysis 
of the primary efficacy variable. Data obtained from Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, and Week  [ADDRESS_1078474] through Week 24.  
• Absolute change in BMI from baseline at Week  24: Analysis of this variable will be based 
on an MMRM model similar to the analysis of the primary efficacy variables. Data obtained from Day 15, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, and Week 24 Visits will be included in the model. 
• Absolute change in SwCl from baseline at Week  4: Analysis of this variable will be based 
on an MMRM similar to the analysis of the primary efficacy variable. Data obtained from 
Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, and Week [ADDRESS_1078475] at Week 4.  

Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 53 of 73 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • Absolute change in CFQ -R respi[INVESTIGATOR_155407]  4: Analysis 
of this variable will be based on an MMRM model similar to the analysis of the primary 
efficacy variable. Data obtained from the Week  4, Week 8, Week 12, and Week [ADDRESS_1078476] completed study participation and the primary endpoint is statistically significant either at the IA or at the  final analysis. Additional details will be provided in the SAP. 
Analysis of Other Secondary Variables  
Other secondary efficacy variables include:  
• Time-to-first PEx through Week  24: Time-to-first PEx will be analyzed using the Cox 
regression model. The model will include a fixed effect for treatment, as well as continuous baseline ppFEV
1, age at screening (<18 versus ≥18 years of age), and sex (male versus 
female) as covariates. A subject who does not experience a PEx during the PEx analysis period will be censored at the PEx analysis period end date. If the proportional hazards assumption is violated for any of the categorical covariates, a stratified Cox regression will be conducted. Additionally, the Kaplan-Meier method will be used to produce a graphical presentation of the cumulative exacerbation -free survival rate for each treatment group and to 
estimate the cumulative exacerbation -free survival rate by [CONTACT_1570]. Note: If the 
number of events is <[ADDRESS_1078477] event will be restricted to the Kaplan -Meier method.  
• Absolute change in BMI z -score from baseline at Week  24 (for subjects ≤20 years of age 
at Baseline):  Analysis of this variable will be based on an MM RM model similar to the 
analysis of the primary efficacy variable, for subjects ≤20 years of age at Baseline. Data 
obtained from Day 15, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, and Week 24 Visits will be included in the model. 
• Absolute change in body weight from baseline at Week  24: Analysis of this variable will 
be based on an MMRM model similar to the analysis of the primary efficacy variable. Data obtained from Day 15, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, and Week 24 Visits will be included in the model. 
Additional details will be provided in the SAP.

alpha of 0.01 will be preserved for the fina l analysis .22 
If the number of subjects included in the IA is 140, the primary endpoint of the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV
1 at Week 4 will be tested at an alpha of 0.044 during the IA. The actual 
alpha at the IA ( α0) will be determined based on the actual number of subjects included in the 
IA. If the study does not cross the efficacy boundary during the IA ( P value ≥ α0), then the 
primary endpoint will be tested at an alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_1078478]

at or after the first dose date of study  drug through the end of the TE Period 
• Post-treatment AE: any AE that worsened (either in severity or seriousness) or that was 
newly developed after the TE Period  
For AEs with missing or partial start dates, if there is no clear evidence that the AEs started 
before or after study drug treatment, then the AEs will be classified as TEAEs.

• Frequently reported TEAEs  
Summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_784166] 
(i.e., number and percentage of subjects with an event). When summarizing the number and 
percentage of subjects with an event, subjects with multiple occurrences of the same AE or a continuing AE will be counted once, only the maximum severity level will be presented in the severity summaries, and the strongest relationship level in the relationship summaries. 
In addition, a listing containing individual subject level AE data for all deaths and other serious 
and significant AEs will be provided separately. All AEs, including pre- and post- treatment AEs, 
will be presented in individual subject data listings.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
For the treatment -emergent laboratory measurements, the observed values and change from 
baseline values of the continuous hematology, serum chemistry, and coagulation results will be summarized in SI units by [CONTACT_10635].

[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examination  
PE findings will be presented in an individual subject data listing only. [IP_ADDRESS] Other Safety Analyses 
Details of other safety analyses will be included in the SAP.  
12.3.6 Interim and IDMC Analyses 
[IP_ADDRESS] Interim Analyses 
An IA is planned when at least [ADDRESS_1078481] of the study, and the results will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_31849]. If the P value for the primary endpoint at the IA is less than α
0, then the 
efficacy boundary has been crossed. Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for how α0 is determined. If the 
IDMC declares that the study has crossed the efficacy boundary, then the study may be 
unblinded by a limited Vertex team to prepare a regulatory submission(s). Members of the limited Vertex unblinded team will not be involved in or influence the conduct of the remaining part of the study to protect the integrity of the study. The study will continue to completion and remain double-blinded through Week 24. 
If the study does not cross the efficacy boundary (i.e., the P  value for the primary endpoint at the 
IA is ≥ α
0), the primary endpoint of the absolute change in ppFEV [ADDRESS_1078482] completed study participation and the primary endpoint is statistically significant either at the IA or at the final analysis. The selected key secondary endpoints at Week  4 

Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 58 of 73 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   (Section [IP_ADDRESS].2)  will be analyzed during the IA, and nominal P  values will be provided for 
descriptive purposes. 
[IP_ADDRESS] IDMC Analysis  
The IDMC  (Section 9.1.7) will conduct periodic planned safety review(s) of study data and the 
planned efficacy IA. Details of the safety and efficacy review(s) will be described in the IDMC 
charter. 
12.4 Clinical Pharmacology Analysis  
12.4.1 Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
The PK analysis of VX -445, TEZ, and IVA may be performed using nonlinear mixed- effects 
modeling and/or standard noncompartmental analysis, as data allow. Me tabolites, including 
M1-TEZ, may be included in the analyses as supported by [CONTACT_33653]. Descriptive statistics will be 
used to summarize PK parameter values for all analytes.  
A detailed description of the planned PK analysis will be presented in the CPAP. 
12.4.2 Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
PD assessments to be included in PK/PD analyses may include SwCl, ppFEV 1, as well as other 
endpoints such as BMI, BMI z-score, or CFQ-R respi[INVESTIGATOR_51774]. 
A sequential approach will be used to perform the population PK/PD analysis. The Bayesian 
estimates of individual PK parameters from the final population PK model will be used to simulate PK profiles for each subject. The simulated VX -445, TEZ, IVA, or metabolite plasma 
concentrations will be used in the potentia l pharmacological response models to describe 
changes in each endpoint from baseline. Fixed- and random- effect parameter estimates and the 
associated asymptotic SEs will be estimated. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize Bayesian estimates of i ndividual PK/PD parameters obtained from the population PK/PD model. 
13 PROCEDURAL, ETHICAL,  REGULATORY, AND ADMI NISTRATIVE 
CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, Severity Grading, and Reporting 
13.1.1 Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of an A dverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly occurring event or worsening of a pre- existing condition ( e.g., increase in its severity or 
frequency) after the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinically Significant Assessments 
Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and 
those deemed to have clinically -significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an 
AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the 

Protocol VX17-445-102, Version [ADDRESS_1078483] result alone (e.g.,  urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, 
the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g.,  bacteria in urine or decreased 
hemoglobin). 
An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1  or more of 
the following: 
• Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment 
• Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention 
• A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study 
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by [CONTACT_093].  
A laboratory value that is Grade [ADDRESS_1078484]’ s clinical status indicates a life -threatening AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Documentation of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be collected from the time the ICF is signed until the subject completes study participation, as defined in Section 9.1.6. 
All subjects will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each 
study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 
[ADDRESS_1078485]’s source documents. The following data will be documented for each AE:  
• Description of the event 
• Classification of “serious” or “nonserious” 
• Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable) 
• Severity 
• Causal relationship to study drug(s)  
• Action taken  
• Outcome  
• Concomitant medication or other treatment given  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Severity  
The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Ver sion 4.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed 
28 September  2017). AEs of CTCAE Gr ades 4 and 5 will be documented as “ life-threatening. ” 
In considering the severity of an AE in a pediatric subject, the investigator will consider that reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory parameters may differ from those given in the 

Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 60 of 73 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   CTCAE. The severity of an AE that does not appear in the CTCAE will be determined according 
to the definitions in Table 13-1.  
Table 13-1 Grading of AE Severity  
Classification  Definition  
Mild (Grade  1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities  
Moderate (Grade  2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities  
Severe (Grade  3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities  
Life-threatening (Grade  4) Any adverse drug event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at 
immediate risk of death  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event  Causality  
Every effort will be made by [CONTACT_63398], if any, to the 
study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories presented in  Table 13-2.  
Table 13-[ADDRESS_1078486] been ruled out, 
and/or the event reappeared on re- exposure to the investigational stud y drug. 
Possibly related  There is an association between the event and the administration of the 
investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative eti ology, such 
as characteristics of the subject ’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be 
related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the study subject’ s medical record).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Drug Action Taken  
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken  with regard to the AE. The action taken 
will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-3.  
Table 13-[ADDRESS_1078487] to an AE 
Classification  Definition  
Dose not changed  Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE  
Dose reduced  Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE  
Drug interrupted  Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE  
Drug withdrawn  Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE  
Not applicable  Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply.  
“Not applicable ” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide 
whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.

Recovered/resolved  Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms  
Recovered/resolved with 
sequelae Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms  
Not recovered/not 
resolved (continuing)  Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains ongoing 
Fatal Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at leas t possibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g.,  a subject lost to follow -up) 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Given  
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given 
in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, surgery, or physical therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE.  
13.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of a Serious Adverse E vent 
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes:  
• Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after 
participation in the study and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of 
the study drug) 
• Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318] 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined a s a substantial disruption 
of a person’ s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgical inter vention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed 

Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 62 of 73 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   above (e.g., an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at home)  
If a subject has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (e.g., surgery) for an event or condition that occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139355], the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155409], unless an AE caused the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139357]. In addition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94253] (e.g.,  social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]) will not be 
considered to indicate an SAE. 
Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “ severe” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “ severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific 
event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be 
of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as 
“serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject ’s life or functionin g. Seriousness, not 
severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Documentation of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent through completion of study participation, 
regardless of causality, will be reported by [CONTACT_155431]. In addition, all SAEs 
that occur after completion of study participation and are considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24  hours. 
SAEs will be recorded on the Vertex Organized Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter referred to as the “SAE Form ”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately 
reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_94316](s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) will be assessed only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and severity assessment will not be required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not resolved at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and report to Vertex t he outcome of the event using the SAE Form. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
The investigator is responsible for notifying the sponsor within 24 hours of identifying an SAE, regardless of the presumed relationship to the investigational study drug. The SAE Form will be completed for new/initial events as well as to report follow -up information on previously 
reported events. Investigators are asked to report follow-up information as soon as it becomes available to ensure timely reporting to health authoritie s.  
Please send completed SAE Forms to Vertex GPS via:  
Email:  (preferred choice)  
Fax:

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   APPENDIX A  Eligible MF CFTR  Mutations  
“MF” mutations are a subset of minimal function mutations that are non -responsive to TEZ, 
IVA, or TEZ/IVA. A mutation is considered an MF mutation if it meets at least 1 of the 
following 2 criteria:  
(1) biological plausibility of no translated protein (genetic sequence predicts the complete absence of CFTR protein), or 
(2) in vitro testing that supports lack of responsiveness to TEZ, IVA, or TEZ/IVA, and evidence of clinical severity on a population basis (as reported in large patient registries). 
Inclusion of MF Mutations Based on In Vitro Testing  
Mutations that were considered to be MF mutations based on in vitro testing met the following criteria in in vitro experiments: 
• baseline chloride transport that was <10% of wildtype CFTR 
• an increase in chloride transport of <10% over baseline following the addition of TEZ, 
IVA, or TEZ/IVA in the assay 
These mutations also had evidence of clinical severity on a population basis (per CFTR2 patient 
registry; accessed on 15  February 2016). Patients with these mutations on one alle le and F508del 
on the other allele exhibited evidence of clinical severity as defined as:  
• average sweat chloride >86  mmol/L, and  
• prevalence of pancreatic insufficiency (PI) >50%  
These clinical severity criteria do not apply to the individual subjects to be enrolled in the study, but were used to categorize each mutation on a population level. 
Eligible MF Mutations  
The list below represents acceptable mutations, which are detectable by [CONTACT_13247] -cleared 
genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_252859] (e.g., sequencing); however, this list may not include every 
eligible mutation, and investigators should contact [CONTACT_784168].

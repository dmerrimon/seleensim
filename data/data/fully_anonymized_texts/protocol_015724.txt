 1. 1.0  INTRODUCTIO N 
 
1.1. Current  treatment for patients with myeloma   
1.1.1.   The current treatment for  myeloma patients  includes  3 to 4 cycles of 
therapy to achieve cytoreduction and then proceed  onto autologous stem cell 
collection and a stem cell transplant ( 1). Prior to an autologous stem cell transplant, 
patients must have their peripheral blood stem cells collected , so the cells can be re-
administered following high dose chemotherapy. The process of stimulating and releasing bone marrow cells into the blood for colle ction is called mobilization.  
1.1.2.            The optimal method to mobilize autologous stem cells for patients wit h 
myeloma is not known ( 2). Autologous stem cell s can be “mobilized” using a growth 
factor  alone or a combination of a growth factor  with a chemotherapy  medication. 
Numerous trials have demonstrated that the administration of chemotherapy with a growth factor, called granulocyte -colony stimulating factor or filgrastim, yields more 
cells than using filgrastim alone ( 3,4). Cyclophosphamide is the most common 
chemotherapy agent used for mobilization, in combination with filgrastim (5) 
Cyclophosphamide is an appealing  agent since it demonstrates clinical  activity against 
myeloma cells and it may provide in vivo  purging of residual myeloma cells ( 6). In 
addition, the combination of cyclophosphamide and filgrastim work synergistically  to 
mobilize autologous stem cells ( 2,7). A multi - center analysi s of transplant centers 
using the Center for In ternational Blood and Marrow T ransplant (CIBMTR) database 
indicates that the  combination of cyclophosphamide with filgrastim  resulted  in an 
increased number of cells collected, a fewer number of apheresis required and a fewer 
number of patients failing to mobilize , when compared to filgrastim alone  (5). 
Unfortunately, when cyclophosphamide is added to filgrastim in a mobilization regimen , there is increased risk for febrile neutropenia and an increased incidence of 
side effects ( 8, 9).  
1.1.3.           In addition to the mobilization  regimen, patient characteristics and a  
patient's  clinical course may also determine a patient’s ability to mobilize autologous 
stem cells . In particular, collections  of a low number of CD34+ cells can be due to the 
patient’s age, prior radiation therapy , prior use of thalidomide or lenalidomide  or the 
use of single -agent filgrastim for mobilization.  The standard international minimal 
number of CD 34+ cells/kg of body weight recommended for an autologous stem cell transplant is 2 x 10
6 CD34+ cells/kg ( 1-4). The term “mobilization failure” refers to 
an inadequate collection of CD34+ cells needed for an autologous stem cell transplant. This definition is based on the absolute number of CD34+ cells collected or the inability to collect a specified number of ce lls in a certain  number of 
leukapheresis. Mobilization failure can also be predicted by [CONTACT_677532]34+ cells mobilized into the peripheral blood following the mobilization treatment regimen . If the number of CD34+ cells in the blood is low, the aphere sis process will 
not collect enough cells.” (10-14 ). Mobilization failure rates for myeloma patients  
vary, based on how “failure” is defined. For example, the Transplant Team at Memorial Sloane Kettering Cancer Center  noted that 13% of myeloma patients fail ed 
to mobilize  cells. This group defined “failure” as the inability to collect 5  x 10
6 
CD34+cells/kg, a number that is much higher than the international standard number 
 
 
Mobilization Trial 05/16/2017 
 Page 5 
 of CD34+ cells required ( 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg ). The general consensus is a 
mobilization failure rate of  5% to 13% in myeloma patients  (1-4, 10).  
 
1.2.Defining  the optimal cyclophosphamide dose  for mobilization  - Review of the literature on 
mobilization in multiple myeloma  
1.2.1.          No prospective randomized trials have evaluated the optimal dose of 
cyclophosphamide to mobilize autologous stem cells ( 1,2,15).  Published reports 
include retrospective analyses, with  the doses of cyclophosphamide ranging  from 1.5 
gms/m2 to 7 gm s/m2 (1-5,14,16). Historically, higher doses of cyclophosphamide (5 
gms/m2 to 7 gms/m2) were used in the early 2000’s ( 9). The literature indicates that 
the higher the cyclophosphamide dose, the greater the toxicities , but the greater the 
number of cells mobilized and collected. Weighing these two conflicting issues, over 
the past [ADDRESS_1125012] been administer ing lower doses of 
cyclophosphami de (doses between 1.5 to 5 g ms/m2) for mobilization,  in an attempt to 
achiev e maximal cell yield with fewer  side effects ( 17-19) .  
1.2.2.          A single center retrospective analysis of two mobilization regimens 
compared low dose (1 to  2 gm s/m2) with intermediate dose (3 to 4 gm s/m2) 
cyclophosphamide in combination with filgrastim . Both groups of patients mobilized  
an adequate number of cells for transplantation (89% of patients  in the low dose arm  
compared with 92% of patients in the intermediate dose arm), but the incidence of febrile neutropenia was three times higher in the interme diate dose arm (38% versus 
13%) ( 17). Another retrospective analysis compared two doses of cyclophosphamide, 
either  2 gms/m
2 or 4 gms/m2, with filgrastim. There was a significant increase in the 
number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_812437], when compared to the lower dose (p = 0.0005). Mobilization  failure occurred in 6% of patients  in the higher dose as compared with 
11% of patients  in the lower dose arm. Of the five patients  that did not mobilize in the 
lower dose arm, four patients mobilized with a subsequent attempt  (19). Finally, a 
recent trial compared mobilizing myeloma patients using low dose cyclophosphamide (1.5 gm s/m
2) and filgrastim with a new mobilizing CXCR4 antag onist,  called 
Plerixafor.  Six patients  (8.1%) in the cyclophosphamide group failed to mobilize cells  
(20).  
1.2.3.           In summary, doses of cyclophosphamide have been used ranging from 1.5 
gms/m2 to 7 gm s/m2. The mobilization failure rate in myeloma patients ranges  
between 5 % and 13%.When used in combination with filgrastim, higher dos es of 
cyclophosphamide mobilize  a larger  number of CD34+ cells, at the expense of 
increased toxicity, side effects and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_812438]. (15-
20). 
1.2.4.           The  International Myeloma Working Group recently reviewed  various 
mobilization  regimens used for myeloma patients . (1,3,4). The Committee concluded 
that the  combination of cyclophosphamide and filgrastim mobilized more cells  when 
compared to filgrastim alone , but the optimal dose of cyclophosphamide was not 
known. The Committee recommended exploring lower doses of cyclophosphamide, 
and not exceeding doses of 4 gms /m2. In addition, the group recommended pursuing 
novel manners  to mobilize cells, including ways to improve efficacy  and decreasing  
costs. ( 3)

 1.2.5. The trial is designed as a non -inferiority trial. If the lower dose arm is shown to be 
non inferior, this will be a major  new findi ng that will change clinical practice here at 
Dartmouth and other transplant centers. As a  result, if the lower dose is shown to be 
non-inferior, additional patients will be accrued to this arm to confirm the findings 
and to address possible superiority of the lower dose arm. The number of patients  
needed will be based on the preliminary results. 
1.2.6.  Since the results of the trial demonstrated no difference  between the two doses of 
cyclophosphamide in terms of number of CD34+cells/kg collected, 13 additional 
patients will be accrued to the lower dose ar m (1.5 gms/m2).  These additional patients 
will be combined with the results from the other participants previously treated on the low dose arm and compared as a group with the high dose arm. (Please refer to 
Statistical Considerations – Section 13, for det ails).   
 
 
2.0 OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Primary Objective  
2.1.2 The primary objective  of this clinical trial is to determine if a lower dose of 
cyclophosphamide combined with filgrastim can mobilize an adequate number of CD34+ 
progenitor cells with less  toxicity.  
We po stulate that low dose cyclophosphamide mobilization (1.5 gm s/m2) will be as 
efficacious as the intermediate dose (3 gms/m2). 
2.1.3 To define the primary  objective, we will identify the number and types of cells 
collected within the apheresis products and characterize the details of the apheresis process. In particular, we will define the following:  
• The number of peripheral blood CD34+ cells identified on Day 1 of collection 
• The number of apheresis required to collect >/= 5 x 10
6 CD34+cells/kg for 
myeloma patients and >/= 3 x 106 CD34+cells/kg for NHL patients . (These 
numbers represent a “goal” and not a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]). 
• The number of cells collected (MNC/kg and CD34+cells/kg) 
• Failure to mobilize will be defined as:  
o < 1x106 CD34+cells/kg collected after 2 days of apheresis OR 
o Failure to mobilize an adequate number of CD34+ progenitor cells 
 Blood CD34+ cell number < 5 cells/mcl if weight < 75kg 
 Blood CD34+ cell number < 10 cells/mcl if weight > 75kg 
• Toxicities during the mobilization and apheresis processes 
2.1.3 If the lower dose arm demonstrates non- inferiority at completion of patient accrual , then 
additional patients will be added to the lower dose arm to confirm non- inferiority or 
superiority. The number of patients needed to answer  this will be based on statistical 
evaluation of the preliminary results  (see Stati stical Analysis).  
 
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
2.2.1 Define resource utilization during the mobilization and apheresis processes: 
• Transfusions of red blood cells

5.2 TREATMENT SCHEMA FOR MOBILIZATION (Table 1)  
 
 
     
 
1.) Samples will be obtained at baseline/pre-treatment (blood), on the first day of collection (mobilized progenitor cells) and a final blood sample at the time of bone marrow recovery (engraftment) following transplant, approximately day 15 following transplant. 
2.) G- CSF dose will be based on National Marrow Donor Program guidelines 
 
****For the remaining patients, each patient will be placed on cyclophosphamide 1.5 gms/m2 arm and 
will NOT be randomized.  
 
  
6.0 RANDOMIZATION and TREATMENT  PLAN   
6.1 Patients will be randomized based on age (> 60 years, <60 years) and duration of 
lenalidomide use (> 4 months, < 4 months) using a randomization process within Micorsoft Excel , developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124] . Jiang, the  study statistician. Patients will be 
randomized to either 1.5 gms/m
2 or 3 gms/m2 after signing a n informed consent.  
Randomization will be based on:

 • Age ( < or > 60 years)  
• Prior radiation (yes or no) 
• Prior therapy ( < or > 2 prior treatments)  
• For myeloma patients, < or > 4 months of prior lenalidomide or thalidomi de 
therapy  
• Platelet count ( < or > 100,000/mcl) 
• As noted previously, randomization will not be used once the preliminary data 
have been analyzed and if the lower dose arm demonstrated non-inferiority.  
Subsequent patients wi ll be treated on the lower dose arm. 
 
6.2 Cyclophosphamide  
After randomization, patients will receive either 1.5 gms/m2 or 3 gms/m2 (based on actual  
BSA). The schedule and the administration of cyclophosphamide and filgrastim  will follow the 
DHMC SOP (BMT SOP 0025: Stem Cell Mobilization Protocol - Appendix). The administration 
of cyclophosphamide is outlined in the SOP. If clinically indicated , patients may receive 
intravenous mesna (600 mg/m2) [ADDRESS_1125020] -cyclophosphamide doses. Oral mesna (1200 mg/m
2) will be administered at [ADDRESS_1125021].  The completed orders  will be provided by [CONTACT_534254] -
Lebanon  to the study participant’s local facility (including local pharmacy) for the single 
treatment dose of cyclophosphamide and subsequent doses of filgrastim.  The evaluation of each 
study participant, data supervision and management, toxicity management, and adverse event 
reporting will all occur at DHMC – Lebanon.   Any significant impediments to treatment on a 
clinic day should immediately be reported by [CONTACT_812460] – Lebanon research 
team.   
  6.3 Zarxio - (filgrastim-sndz ), 
Zarxio (Sandoz, Inc.) is biosimilar to [COMPANY_010] Inc.’s Neupogen (filgrastim). Zarxio is an FDA-approved biosimilar product. A biosimilar product is a compound that is approved based on clinical data demonstrating efficacy to a similar to an already -approved product, known as a 
reference product. The biosimilar shows no clinically meaningful differences in toxicity, safety 
or effectiveness from the reference product. Only minor differences are allowable in biosimilar products. Zarxio is approved for the same indications as Neupogen (filgrastim) , and can be 
prescribed for patients undergoing autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell collection.  The 
dosing of Zarxio is the same as Filgrastim (outlined below).  
 
 
6.[ADDRESS_1125022] dose and schedule of filgrastim will be used.  Approximately 48 hours after 
cyclophosphamide, filgrastim (using NMDP guidelines below) will be administered as a daily 
subcutaneous injection until completion of collection (BMT SOP 0025).  Complete blood counts (CBC)  will be monitored approximately 3x/week and the dose of filgrastim adjusted, according 
 
 
Mobilization Trial 05/16/2017 
 Page 10 
 to the CBC results. Filgrastim will continue until completion of leukapheresis.  The following 
NMDP guidelines will be used for dosing filgrastim, b ased on patient’s weight and vial size.

91 to 96  0 2 960 
97 to 108  2 1 1080  
109 and greater  4 0 1200  
 
 
6.5  Leukapheresis  
We previously demonstrated that the time to collection of autologous hematopoietic stem 
cells is 10 -12 days following cyclophosphamide and daily filgrastim ( 21).  Patients will undergo 
peripheral blood stem cell harvesting via leukapheresis, depending upon the peripheral blood 
WBC and CD34+ cell count, generally between Days [ADDRESS_1125023] strikingly in the WBC, between days 10 to 12 following cyclophosphamide administration. 
Based on this clinical course, peripheral blood CD34+ cell numbers will be  examined (as a 
marker of circulating stem cells), beginning Day 10, based on a patient’s CBC recovery. 
Apheresis will begin once the blood CD34+ number reaches approximately  10 cells/mcl.  
The collection process will be standard for each patient on trial. This will be accomplished 
by [CONTACT_812461] (CD34+ cells and MNC) per volume of 
blood processed. 
 The goal for collection will be the following: 
Patients will receive consecutive days of leukapheresis until > 5 x 10
6 CD34+cells/kg for 
myeloma patients and > 3 x 106 CD34+cells/kg for NHL patients  have been collected.  (See 
Section “How to handle poor mobilizers” below.) 
 
Peripheral blood stem cells will be cryopreserved in the usual manner, per the Cell 
Processing Laboratory protocol.    
If < 1 x 106 CD34+cell/kg has been obtained after 2 days of leukaphereses, leukapheresis 
will be discontinued and this patient will be removed from protocol, since this is one endpoint of the trial. In addition, failure to mobilize cells will be defined as a peripheral b lood CD34+ cell 
number < 5 cells/mcl if patient’s weight < 75kg or a blood CD34+ cell number < 10 cells/mcl if 
patient’s weight > 75kg. 
 
6.5 How to handle “Poor Mobilizers”  
Poor mobilizers are defined as  patients who sluggishly mobilize autologous blood stem cells  
but do not meet criteria for “removal from trial”. T ypi[INVESTIGATOR_897], t hese patients  mobilize enough cells 
for transplant but do not meet the target CD34+ cell number. These patients will NOT be 
removed  from trial. Apheresis can be discontinued in these patients before reaching the target 
CD34+ cell number if, at the discretion of the treating physician or the PI, it is not clinically 
 
 
Mobilization Trial 05/16/[ADDRESS_1125024] been obtained for transplantation. The patient will remain on protocol and 
will be considered evaluable on an “intent to treat” analysis.  These patients will be defined as 
“poor mobilizers’’ within the database.  
 In contrast, if a patient does not meet these end point collection criteria or if another day of collection is not clinically indicated but a patient has not met the CD34+ cell collection criteria, the collection process can be terminated at the di scretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_315226].  For 
example, a myeloma patient mobilizes 4.8 x 10
6 CD34+cells/kg on the first day).  The patient 
will remain on protocol and will be considered evaluable on an “intent to treat” analysis. 
 
6.6 Supportive Medicati ons  
Following cyclophosphamide administration, once the patient’s absolute neutrophil count 
drops to < 500 cells/mcl, oral prophylactic  fluconazole (400 mg/day), acyclovir (800 mg BID) 
and levaquin (750 mg/d) will be started, if the patient is not already taking these medications.  
 
6.7 Peripheral Blood Stem Cell (PBSC) Collection and Storage 
The collection, concentration and storage of PBSC will be standard for all patients. 
Briefly, a 4-blood volum e leukaphereses PBSC collection will b e performed daily using a COBE 
Spectra cell separator (COBE BCT, Lakewood, CO). Collected cells will be concentrated t o 50 – 
100 ml in a refrigerated centrifuge. PBSC concentrates will be cryopreserved in  a medium 
consisting of 6% low molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch  (Normosol- R pH 7 .4, Abbott 
Laboratories, North Chicago, IL.), 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Cryoserv, Research 
Industries, Salt Lake City, UT), and autologous serum albumin, 20% concentr ation. Cells will be 
frozen in Cryocyte freezing bags (Nexell Therapeutics Inc) in a controlled rate freezer (Custom 
BioGenic Systems, Shelby [CONTACT_812462], MI).  At the conclusion of  this freezing, the cells will be 
transferred to the vapor phase of a monitored liquid nitrogen freezer (CryoPlus III, Forma 
Scientific, Marietta, OH) at a temperature of –120 0C or below. 
 
Pregnancy Risks : The risks of the drugs and procedures used in this study to a pregnancy are 
unknown. Pregnant women may not take part in this research study.  All women who could become pregnan t will have a pregnancy test.  Men taking part  should not father a baby [CONTACT_59606].  All men and women who could become pregnant will be  required to use a medically 
approved method of birth control in order to take part in this research study.   
 
7.0 POTENTIAL TOXICITIESAND MANAGEMENT  
7.1 Evaluation of toxicities (other than Hematologic) will be graded using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria , specifically CTC AE 4.[ADDRESS_1125025] result abnormalities  and adverse events  should be captured on the non-
serious AE CRF  page or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:  
• Any laboratory test resul t/adverse reaction  that is ≥ Grade 4 or meets the definition of an SAE  
• Any laboratory test resul t/adverse reaction abnormality that required the subject to have study 
drug discontinued or interrupted 
 
 
Mobilization Trial 05/16/2017 
 Page 12 
 • Any laboratory test result/adverse reaction deemed related to the treatment that required medical 
intervention, either by [CONTACT_812463]/infusion room visit, treatment (ranging from medication administration, hyd ration or transfusion). 
Monitoring of toxicities will terminate on the last day of collection, since treatment- related 
toxicities occur during this time period.  Patients who complete mobilization will be considered 
“off treatment” on the date of the last mobilization.  There will be no specified follow up beyond 
the off treatment period  other than following for engra ftment .  However, should any life 
threatening event directly linked to the study take place within [ADDRESS_1125026] -mobilization, the 
investigator shall use his/her discretion in reporting the event to the appropriate committees . 
7.2 Leukapheresis will be initiated appr oximately 11 - 12 days following cyclophosphamide 
administration.  Patients  will be monitored clinically for toxicities during the 
mobilization process until completion of collection of stem cells.  In particular, the 
following will be monitored:  
• Transfusions of red blood cells  
• Transfusion of platelets  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]  
• Incidence of febrile neutropenia 
 
7.[ADDRESS_1125027] definitions of engraftment will be used.  Engraftment of each cell line will be 
defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of > 500/mm
3 for three days (defined as first 
day) and a platelet count of 20,000/mm3 un transfused (defined as first day).  Standard 
definitions of engraftment are being used to allow comparisons to results within the literature.  
 
 
8.0 DRUG FORMULATION, AVAILABILITY AND TOXICITY 
8.1 Cyclophosphamide
   
8.2 Mechanism of action: Cyclophosphamide is a pro drug that requires activation. 
Following hepatic and cellular activation, phosphoramide mustard and acrolein are 
formed.  Phosphoramide mustard is the alkylating agent that demonstrates cytotoxic 
effects.   Acrolein binds to proteins but does not contribute to the anti- tumor effects.  
8.3 Toxicities : Potential toxicities include: fev er and/or chills, nausea and vomiting, anemia, 
oliguria/anuria, diarrhea, mental status changes, sinus ta chycardia, elevated bilirubin, 
thrombocytopenia, BUN elevation, serum creatinine elevation, elevated t ransaminase, 
elevated alkaline phosphatase, pulmonary congestion, fati gue/weakness/malaise, 
dyspnea, pruritus, edema, erythema leukopenia, stomatitis, anorexia, rash, infection, 
weight gain  (> 10%), arrhythmias, hypomagnesemia, acidosis, hypocalcemia, 
dizziness, dry skin, exfoliative dermatitis, GI bleeding, sensory dysfunction, jaundice, 
pulmonary edema, proteinuria, hypophosphatemia, headache, coagulation disorders.  
Acrolein is toxic to the bladder and is associated with the development of hemorrhagic 
cystitis.  
8.4 How supplied : cyclophosphamide is com mercially available   
 
8.5 Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz; Sandoz, Inc.)  
 
 
Mobilization Trial 05/16/2017 
 Page 13 
 8.6 Zarxio (Sandoz , Inc.) is biosimilar to [COMPANY_010] Inc.’s Neupogen (filgrastim). Zarxio is an 
FDA -approved biosimilar product. The dosing of Zarxio is the same as Filgrastim 
(outlined below). 
8.7 Mechanism of action : The colony stimulating factors (CSFs ) are a family of 
glycoprotein hormones that support survival, clonal expansion, and differentiation of 
hematopoietic progenitor cells.  CSFs induce partially committed progenitor cells to 
divide and to differentiate in the granulocyte-macrophage pathways. 
8.8 Toxicities:  Nausea/vomiting, skeletal pain, alopecia, diarrhea, neutropenic fever, 
mucositis, fever, fatigue, anorexia, dyspnea, headache, cough, skin rash, chest pain, generalized weakness, sore throat, stomatitis, constipation, pain. 
8.9 How  Supplied : Zarxio is commercially available.  
 
8.10 Filgrastim
 (Recombinant Human Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor; 
[COMPANY_010])  
8.11 Mechanism of action : The colony stimulating factors (CSFs ) are a family of 
glycoprotein hormones that support survival, clonal expansion, and di fferentiation of 
hematopoietic progenitor cells.  CSFs induce partially committed progenitor cells to 
divide and to differentiate in the g ranulocyte-macrophage pathways. 
8.12 Toxicities:  Nausea/vomiting, skeletal pain, alopecia, diarrhea,  neutropenic fever, 
mucositis, fever, fatigue, anorexia, dyspnea, headache,  cough, skin rash, chest pain, 
gene ralized weakness, sore throat, s tomatitis, constipation, pain.  
8.13 How  Supplied : Filgrastim is com mercially available.  
  
9.0 REQUIRED DATA and CORRELATIVE LABORATORY STUDIES  
9.1 The required data is divided into four sections: 1) Pre -Treatment Evaluation; 2) 
Mobilization/Collection; 3) Post- transplant engraftment and 4) Evaluation of the 
Laboratory Correlates.   The “Pre- Treatment Evaluation”, the “Mobilization and 
Collection Evaluation” and “Post -transplant engraftment” will be monitored by [CONTACT_812464].  
9.2 Pre-Treatment Evaluation : The “Treatment Evaluation” required for this trial is listed in 
Section 5.0, “General Workup and Diagnostic Procedures”.  
9.3 During the mobilization and collection processed, toxicity will be monitored (Section 7.0, “Potential Toxicities, Dose Modifications and Management”).  
9.4 We will identify the number and types of cells collected with the apheresis process, a 
process that is performed regularly for each transplant patient.  The following data will 
be collected at the time of stem cell collection:   
• The number of peripheral blood CD34+ cells on Day 1 of collection 
• The number of apheresis required to collect > 6 x 10
6 CD34+cells/kg of 
body weight 
• The number of cells collected (MNC/kg and CD34+cells/kg) 
• The number of patients who failed mobilization, defined as: 
o < 1x106 CD34+cells/kg collected after 2 days of apheresis 
o Failure to mobilize an adequate number of CD34+ progenitor cells 
 Blood CD34+ cell number < 5 cells/mcl if weight < 75kg 
 Blood CD34+ cell number < 10 cells/mcl if weight > 75kg 
 
 
Mobilization Trial 05/16/[ADDRESS_1125028]-transplant engraftment of neutrophils and platelets.  
Engraftment of each cell line will be defined as an absolute neutrophil count 
(ANC) of > 500/mm3 for three days (count first day)and a platelet count of 20,000/mm3 
un transfused (count first day).  Standard definitions of engraftment are being used.  
 
9.6 Evaluation of the Mobilized Cells 
Pending budget issues, the following translational studies may be performed, comparing the 
results between the two cohorts:   
• Phenotypic analyses of early progenitor cells 
• Cytotoxicity of the mobilized effector cells  
• CD3+ CD8+ NKG2D+ T cell cytotoxicity; Isolation of the cytotoxic 
effector cells  
• Intracellular cytokine analysis of the mobilized effector cells  
 
9.7 Patient Samples – pending funding, patient blood samples wil l be analyzed in the 
laboratory.  Patient samples will be processed by [CONTACT_812465]. 
Each sample will be labeled with the trial number and provided with a unique patient number (UPN).   No individual patient samples will be identifiable.   The laboratory tests 
will be conducted by [CONTACT_812466] a copy of the results will remain in the laboratory and with the PI.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_812439].  
9.7.1 Phenotypic analysis of early progenitor cells
: The mobilized mononuclear 
cells will be analyzed to determine the presence of early progenitor cells. 
Patients’ samples will include a baseline pre -leukapheresis blood sample and 
one sample from the leukapheresis product.  Cell surface phenotype of the 
mononuclear cell (MNC) fraction of the peripheral blood and peripheral blood stem cells will be determined using appropriate fluorescein isothocyanate (FITC) - or phycoerythrin (PE) -conjugated monoclonal 
antibodies and three -color flow cytometry.  “Early” hematopoietic stem cells 
may demonstrate the following expression of surface antigens: CD34+/CD33- , CD34+/CD38- , and CD34+/HLA -DR-.  Samples of the 
collected mononuclear cells (MNC) cells will be labeled with conjugated monoclonal antibodies directed against the following antigens: CD34, CD33, CD38, HLA-DR, CD133, and CD90.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Significance of CD133 and CD90 : CD133 is a recently  recognized 
stem cell antigen that identifies earlier progeni tor cells then those 
identified with CD34 antigen expression alone. CD133 is found on 50% of CD34- negative cells that contribute to long -term 
hematopoiesis, indicating that CD133 is likely an early marker of hematopoiesis.  The presence of CD90 (also known as Thy -1) on 
progenitor cells is an excellent predictor of prolonged engraftment. 
[IP_ADDRESS] All flow cytometry data acquisition and automated analyses will be performed using two or three color staining on a FACSCalibur ™ 
multipurpose flow cytometer and application- specific software 
(BDIS, San Jose, CA). 
 
 
Mobilization Trial 05/16/2017

9.8 Phenotypic analysis of mobilized effector cells: Patients’ samples will include a baseline 
pre-leukapheresis blood sample and one apheresis sample.  Since we will be focusing on 
the mobilized effector cells with emp hasis on the T cell population, the panel will 
contain antibodies directed against T cells (CD3 ), Helper T cells (CD3+/CD4+), 
cytotoxic T cells (CD3+/CD8), B cells (CD19+), NK cells (CD56+), and cytokine -
induced killer cells (CD3+/CD56+).  Cytokine- induced killer (CIK) cells show surface 
markers of T cells (CD3+) and NK cells (CD56+).  The CIK cell is thought to be of T 
cell origin, yet CIK cells possess the NK marker yielding the phenotype of 
CD3+CD56+. T regs and T suppressor cells will also be identified. 
9.8.1 Peripheral blood monocytes/macrophages will be mobilized.  These cells 
express various surface receptors, representing various biological functions such as adhesion, phagocytosis (CD11b/CD18, CD11c/CD18, CD16), antigen -presentation (HLA -DR, ICAM -1), differentiation (transferrin 
receptor, CD71), receptor for LPS (CD14) and initiation of the coagulation cascade (Tissue factor, CD142).   To test for the presence of 
monocytes/macrophages, we will use antibodies directed against CD64/CD16/CD45/CD14.  
 
9.9 Cytotoxicity of the mobilized effector cell population: Standard 4-hour 
51C release 
cytotoxicity assays will be used to determine cytotoxic potential of the mobilized effector cells against NK -sensitive and LAK -sensitive K562  (CML) and NK -resistant , 
LAK -sensitive Daudi  (lymphoma) human tumor cell lines.  Three effector to target 
ratios will be evaluated (10:1, 50:1, 100:1) .  The percent lysis will be calculated using 
the standard formula with data presented as mean +/ - SEM.  Controls will be patien t's 
own lymphocytes prior to stem cell mobilization.  The change in cytotoxicity comparing 
baseline sample and a sample from the apheresis product will be presented.  Internal 
controls consisting of media only will be used. 
 
9.10 CD3+ CD8+ CTL Cytotoxicity; Isolation of the cytotoxic effector cells : This 
functional assay evaluates CD3 + T cell re- directed lysis of target cells.  Briefly, 
mononuclear cells will be isolated from blood or PBSC and cultured overnight in medium with or without IL -2 (10 U/ml).  Cells will be assayed the next day for their 
ability to lyse chromium- labeled Fc Receptor (FcR) -bearing P815 target cells (Myeloid 
cells).  A 6-hr antigen -independent redirected lysis assay is employed using anti -CD3 
MAb (OKT3) for CTL lytic activity and a co ntrol (no antibody - to measure background 
levels of lysis).  The use of an isotype control MAb W6/32 (directed against a 
monomorphic HLA -A, HLA -B, and HLA -C determinant) has demonstrated that this 
assay is specific.  The benefits of this assay over a standard Cr
51 assay is that the 
addition of OKT3 “recruits” all CD3+ T cells and is specific to CD3+ T cells.   This 
recruitment allows the Fc receptor of the OKT3 to be directed against the FcR of the target cells (P815 cells).  Employing a method we previously  developed for T cell subset 
depletion using antibodies conjugated to magnetic beads (Dynal, Oslo Norway), the immune -mobilized mononuclear cells will be depleted of various T cell subsets and the 
CD3 Re -Directed Lysis Test repeated.  Murine anti -human CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD56 
antibodies conjugated to goat anti -mouse magnetic beads (Dynal, Oslo Norway) will be 
 
 
Mobilization Trial 05/16/[ADDRESS_1125029] CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD56 and analyzed using a lymphocyte gate.   
 
9.11 Intracellular cytokine analysis:  We will determine if the T cells within the 
mobilized product are of T helper lymphocyte type 1 (Th1) or T helper lymphocyte type 
2 (Th2) origin. CD4+  helper T cells differentiate into two effector T cell populations , 
called Th1  cells  or Th2  cells. Th1 cells promote cell -mediated immunity and secrete 
IFN-γ, IL -2, IL -10, and TNF -α.  These cytokines promote cytotoxic T lymphocyte 
proliferation and macrophage activation resulting in destruction of tumor cell s.  Th2 
cells are required for humoral immunity and secrete IL -4, IL -5, IL -9, and IL -13.  We 
have previously published our experience using either flow cytometry or EL ISA to 
examine intracellular cytokines ( 22). 
 
10.0 CRITERIA FOR RESPONSE AND TREATMENT ENDPOINT S 
10.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this clinical trial is to determine if a lower dose of cyclophosphamide combined with filgrastim  can mobilize an adequate number of 
CD34+ progenitor cells with less toxicity.  
Details of this objective, as well as the Secondary and Exploratory objectives are listed within the “Objectives”.  If the lower dose arm demonstrates non- inferiority at completion of patient 
accrual, then additional patients will be added to the lower dose arm to confirm non-inferiority or superiority. The number of patients needed to answer this will 
be based on statistical evaluation of the preliminary results (see Statistical Analysis).  
 
10.2 Secondary Objectives
:  
10.2.1 Define resource utilization during the mobilization and apheresis processes: 
• Transfusions of red blood cells  
• Transfusion of platelets 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]  
• Incidence of febrile neutropenia 
10.[ADDRESS_1125030] and 
characterizing  their functional abilities. This will be performed by 
[CONTACT_318890]:  
• Phenotypic analyses of early progenitor cells  
• Cytotoxicity of the mobilized effector cells  
• CD3+ CD8+ CTL Cytotoxicity; Isolation of the cytotoxic effector cells  
• Intracellular cytokine analysis of the mobilized ef fector cells  
 
 
 
 
Mobilization Trial 05/16/[ADDRESS_1125031] removal from the trial at any time.  In addition, the 
treating physician may remove a patient from the trial at any time during treatment.  If a 
patient requests withdrawal, the patient’s  samples will not be used for analyses.  
11.[ADDRESS_1125032] day of collection, since 
treatment -related toxicities occur during this time period.  Patients who complete 
mobiliza tion will be considered “off treatment ” on the last day of collection.   Patients 
will be considered “off protocol” after engraftment.  There will be no specified follow 
up beyond the off treatment  period.  However, should any life threatening event directl y 
linked to the study take place within [ADDRESS_1125033] -mobilization, the investigator shall 
use his/her discretion is reporting the event to the appropriate committees . 
11.3 Mobilization Failures: Any patient who “fails” to mobilize will be removed from 
the trial.  The term “mobilization failure” refers to an inadequate collection of CD34+ 
cells needed for an autologous stem cell transplant.  This definition is based on the 
absolute number of CD34+ cells collected or the inability to collect a specified numbe r 
of cells in a certain number of leukapheresis.   Mobilization failure can also be predicted 
by [CONTACT_677532]34+ cells mobilized into the peripheral blood following the 
mobilization treatment.   If the number of CD34+ cells in the blood is low, the apheresis 
process will not collect enough cells.  
11.4 Based on a review of the literature, 8% to 13% of myeloma patients will not 
mobilize cells ( 1-4).  Using an estimated 10% of patients failing to mobilize in each 
group, we will need to accrue [ADDRESS_1125034] 40 eligible patients.  Due to the 
complicated clinical course of these patients and factors known to make collection of autologous cells difficult, including patients’ age, previous therapy, previous radiation, the trial will be stopped if 20% of patients (n = 4) receiving the intermediate dose of cyclophosphamide (3 gms/m
2) do not mobilize or 30 % of patients (n = 6) receiving the 
low dose cyclophosphamide (1.5 gms/m2) fail to mobilize.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_1125035], many centers use a much higher  dose of 
cyclophosphamide (5 gms/m2) for mobilization, then commonly used at DHMC.  We 
will closely monitor for any side effects or toxicities.

leukapheresis .  Adverse events will be graded according to the NCI Common Toxicity 
Criteria Version 4.0.  A copy of the CTC version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP home page (http://ctep.info.nih.gov).  All appropriate treatment ar eas should have access 
to a copy of the CTC version 4.0.  Adverse events and unanticipated problems will be 
reported to The Dartmouth Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects (CPHS) as per their statement found at http://www.dartmouth.edu/~cphs/docs/ aedsmmemo.pdf 
using their Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting Form or their Reporting Form for An Unanticipated Problem Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPR)for Clinical Trials found at http://www.dartmouth.edu/~cphs/tosubmit/forms/
.  
 
 
Mobilization Trial 05/16/2017 
 Page 18 
 Adverse events to be reported to the CPHS are: any adverse experience, defined as any 
untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research), that is considered: – Serious: Death; a life -threate ning adverse drug experience; inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; a persistent or significant disability or incapacity; or a congenital anomaly or birth defect; and  
– Unexpected:  Any adverse experience, the specificity o r severity of which is not 
consistent with the current investigator brochure or consent form; and – Possibly related:  There is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or 
outcome may have been associated with the procedures involved in the research; and  is 
experienced by a participant in a trial open at a site subject to review by [CONTACT_188481].  
  The following definitions will be used to assess causality:  
No: The clinical adverse event is definitely unrelated to study procedures (e.g., does 
not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from study procedure, present prior to 
procedure, etc.)  
Unlikely: The study procedures do not have any reasonable association with the 
observed experience; however, relationship cannot be definitely excluded. 
Possibly: The connection with study procedures appears feasible, but cannot be 
excluded with certainty (e.g., follows a reasonable temporal sequence from procedure, but may also be related to other known factors). 
Probably: The clinical experience appears related to the study procedures with a high 
degree of certainty (e.g., follows a reasonable temporal sequence from procedure  and abates upon termination of the procedure, cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_8129]’s clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to the patient, etc.)  
 An unanticipated problem involving risks to subjects or others is defined as any incident, experience, or outcome that meets each of the following criteria:  
• Unanticipated in terms of nature, sever ity, or frequency given: (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -
approved research protocol and consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; and • Possibly related to participation in the research means there is a reasonable 
possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been associated with research participation; and  
• The problem suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk 
of harm (including physical, psychological, emotional, economic, legal, or social harms) than was previously known or recognized. • Copi[INVESTIGATOR_726640]’s study file.  
 
We will monitor and record unexpected toxicities related  to the treatment and all

Mobilization Trial 05/16/[ADDRESS_1125037] a dose of filgrastim.  The primary objective  of this clinical trial is to 
determine if a lower dose of cyclophosphamide combined with filgrastim can mobilize 
an adequate number of CD34+ progenitor cells with less toxicity.  We postulate that the 
low dose cyclophosph amide (1.5 gms/m2) mobilization  regimen  will be as efficacious as 
the intermediate dose (3 gms/m2).  In the event that a patient is not evaluable, that 
patient will be replaced by [CONTACT_812467].  Toxicity will be tabulated 
according to type and grade, both overall and according to dose group.  Toxicity will be 
evaluated during mobilization and collection.   
13.2 The trial is designed as a non -inferiority trial, meaning we will be examining if 
the lower dose of cyclophosphamide will mobilize a similar number of cells with fewer toxicities, when compared with a higher dose of cyclophosphamide.  Based on this 
assessment, 40 patients will be treated.  With 20 patie nts in each arm, we can achieve 
80% power to detect non- inferiority using a one -sided, two- sample t -test.  If the 
difference between the average number of apheresis required to collect cells for lower dose arm and higher dose arm is no greater than 0.5.  The true difference between the 
means is assumed to be 0.  The significance level (alpha) of the test is 0.[ADDRESS_1125038] deviations are 0.55 for both arms.  
13.3 Based on a review of the literature, 8% to 13% of myeloma patients will not 
mobil ize cells ( 3).  Using an estimated 10% of patients failing to mobilize in each group, 
we will need to accrue [ADDRESS_1125039] 40 eligible patients.  Due to the complicated 
clinical course of these patients and factors known to make collection of autologous cells diffic ult, including patients’ age, previous therapy, previous radiation, the trial will 
be stopped if 20% of patients (n = 4) receiving the intermediate dose of cyclophosphamide (3 gm s/m
2) do not mobilize or 30 % of patients (n = 6) receiving the 
low dose cyclophosphamide (1.5 gms /m2) fail to mobilize.  
13.[ADDRESS_1125040] to evaluate if there is any statistical si gnifican ce between the two arms.   Where 
necessary, we will use transformations (e.g., logarithm and square root) to adjust for skewed distributions.  We will use [ADDRESS_1125041]  binomia l methods.  Laboratory a nalysis of the 
parameters related to mobilized cells will include overall summaries and graphical displays.  We will attempt to fit linear and non -linear models as appropriate based on the 
data summaries.  
13.5 We do not anticipat e any long -term toxicities.  As a result, after collection of the 
cells, patient follow-up will be stopped except for collection of engraftment data, if 
available.  
13.6 SUMMARY of PRELIMINARY RESULTS: We have analyzed the preliminary 
data and some of the results are presented below.   In particular, the specific aim of the 
 
 
Mobilization Trial 05/16/2017 
 Page 20 
 trial was to show that the number of CD34+ cells  and the number of mononuclear cells  
collected were similar in each arm (Table 3 ).

The results indicate that patients receiving the lower dose of cyclophosphamide collected  more 
total mononuclear cells when compared with the higher dose of cyclophosphamide (p = 0.03).  The 
number of CD34+ cells collected is lower  in the lower dose arm (7.2 x 108) compared with the 
higher dose arm (10.5 x 108), although this is not statistically significant (p = 0.6).  Although the 
lower number of CD34+ cells collected in the lower dose arm is not statistically significant, this is  
still a critical finding since the difference between the two arms might be clinically  significant.  
Since the number of CD34+ cells is a more important clinical parameter used to determine 
optimal cell collection and to determine the optimal number of cells to infuse, more patients should be accrued  to the lower dose arm to verify the number of CD34 + cells that are collected does not 
decrease.  Based on preliminary analyses of 19 patients who were treated in the lower dose arm, 
approximately 13 more patients would need to be accrued to the lower dose to confirm that the number of CD34+ cells collected remains within the current range and does not decrease.  The results from these additional 13 patients will be combined with the results from the other 
participants previously treated on the low er dose arm and compared as a group with the high dose 
arm.  The addition of 13 patients (32 patients total in the lower dose arm) would achieve 80% 
power to confirm a difference in the number of CD34+ cells collected between the two cohorts, with a p value (alpha) of 0.05, using a two- sided two -sample t -test.  We recognize that this new 
addition may interfere with the previous randomization.  We will use T test and Chi-square to determine if there is any significan t difference between the two arms on all potential confounders.  
If one or more variables are identified, we will use linear regression model to include them as 
confounders.

 Page 21 
 This study  will be monitored by [CONTACT_65063] 
(DSMAC) of the Norris Cotton Cancer Center. The Committee meets quarterly to review 
accrual rates and information of all studies that have accrued participants. The Clinical 
Cancer Review Committee (CCRC) determines the frequency of DSMAC review. The DSMAC has the authority to suspend or to recommend termination to the CCRC of all research activities that fall within its jurisdiction.  In the event that a study is suspended or 
terminated  by [CONTACT_233781], that information will be forwarded to the CPHS (Dartmouth 
IRB) office.  
The DSMAC will monitor this trial. In particular, areas that will be monitored include 
accrual to the trial, toxicity associated with the treatment and patient outcomes (the 
“Objectives ”). Since this trial represents standard of care treatment, we do not anticipate 
severe or life threatening toxicities. In fact, many centers use a much higher dose of cyclophosphamide (5 gms/m
2) for mobilization, then commonly used at DHMC . We will 
closely monitor for any side effects or toxicities.  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_812440], as outlined in Section 11.  Briefly, the trial will be stopped if 20% of patients (n = 4) receiving 
the intermediate dose of cyclophosphamide (3 gms/m
2) do not mobilize or 30 % of patients 
(n = 6) receiving the low dose cyclophosphamide (1.5 gms/m2) fail to mobilize.

Job Aid Pre-Transplant Allogeneic  and Autologous  
Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_812447] - 
Blood  and Marrow  Transplant ID: [ZIP_CODE]  
Keywords  Not Set 
Department Hematology/Oncology  
 
I. Purpose  
The purpose of this procedure is to formalize  guidelines  pertaining  to patient  suitability  and 
eligibility  for allogeneic and autologous  hematopoietic  stem  cell transplantation  and to 
standardize the process of  evaluating  and selecting  prospective hematopoietic stem  cell 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  (peripheral  blood and bone  marrow) to achieve optimal assessment  and 
minimization  of potential  risks  during transplant. 
 
The recipi[INVESTIGATOR_812448],  including the stem  cell mobilization  and collection  process (autologous 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]),  chemotherapy  regimen  (high -dose or  reduced  intensity  or non- myeloablative),  
stem  cell infusion, infectious complications, organ  compromise,  and graft-versus -host 
disease (allogeneic recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]).  These  issues require  early  thoughtful  discussion with the 
prospective hematopoietic recipi[INVESTIGATOR_812449],  along  with consideration of 
relative risk in the context  of the specific  medical  history  and overall  state of health  of this 
individual. 
 
Established  requirements  for high-dose chemotherapy  followed by [CONTACT_812470],  subject  to interpretation  and 
potential modification , depending on  the overall  status  of the patient  in question and 
circumstances  surrounding the transplant. 
The patient  elig ibility  is discussed in the weekly  transplant clinical  meetings  and a consensus 
decision  is made to proceed  or not by [CONTACT_812471].  
 
 
a) General  considerations  for eligibility  
• Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_812450] -sensitive  disease & attainment of minimal residual 
disease and no second  active malignancy.  Disease  status  will be evaluated  using 
accepted  means  based  on the  patient’s  diagnosis  

 
 
Mobilization Trial 05/16/2017 
 Page 31 
 . 
• Potential  Malignancy  
o Female – pap smear,  mammogram  
o Male – prostate exam  and/or PSA 
o Colonoscopy – pending age and risk factors.  
 
• Adequate organ  function. 
o Echo/Muga  – cardiac ejection  fraction  greater  than or equal  to 45%. 
o EKG – no evidence of potentially  life-threatening  cardiac dysrhythmia.  
o Pulmonary function tests – FVC  / FEV1  greater  than or equal  to 50%,  and DLCO  
greater  than or equal to 50% predicted.  
o Chest  x-ray – R/O lung infection  or process  that would indicate recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]  @ high 
risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_812451]/complications. 
o 24 hr urine clearance or Glomerular  Filtration  Rate (GFR)  greater  than 50 ml/min.  
o Liver  function: total bilirubin  less than or equal  to 2.0 and transaminases.  
o No pregnancy 
 
• No life-threatening  viral exposures. 
o Hepatitis  B Core  Antibody  
o Hepatitis  B Surface  Antigen  
o Hepatitis  C Virus  
o HIV 1/2 Antibody 
o HTLV  I/II Antibody   
o Nat Multiplex  
o Syphillis  Serology 
o West  Nile Virus  NAT  
o Chagas  Antibody 
o CMV  Antibody 
o Herpes  simplex  virus IgG 
o Toxoplasmosis antibody  
o Varicella  zoster  virus  IgG 
o EBV  (Epstein  Bar Virus)  nuclear  IgG 
 
• No life-threatening co-morbidities  that would likely  compromise the patient’s  clinical care 
and chance for optimal post-transplant survival. 
 
• Eradication  of any active pre-transplant infection.  A dental assessment  must  be done 
prior to transplant. 
 
• Age,  auto/reduced intensity conditioning and non-myeloablative less than or equal  to 75 years  
and myeloablative  conditioning less than or equal  to 60 years.  
 
 
 
Mobilization Trial 05/16/2017 
 Page 32 
 • Karnofsky  performance score  greater  than or equal  to 70% 
 
• Psychosocial assessment  addressing barriers  to transplant  (financial,  lack of caregivers,  and 
compliance issues).  If a barrier  is identified,  team  will discuss and determine if patient can 
proceed  to transplant.  
 
• Allogeneic transplant  patients  must have an available HLA -matched  related  or unrelated  
donor.  (10/10 match; 9/10 match  feasible,  depending on locus of mismatch)  
 
• Pre-transplant  stem cell goal of 2- 3x106 CD34  positive  cells per kilogram recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22599].  
 
• Patients  registered  on specific  protocols will clearly  meet  the requirements of that protocol. 
 
b) Other points  to consider:  
• Venous access  assessment  
o All patients  will have a 3 lumen  tunneled CVC  line placed  at time of transplant.  
 
• Radiation  Oncology Consultation 
o When  total body irradiation  (TBI)  is intended as part of the pre-transplant conditioning 
regimen,  a formal  request for Radiation  Oncology consultation will be initiated  by [CONTACT_812472]. 
 
• Biological product deviations (case- specific basis)  
o A transplant  physician  will document in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s  medical  record  the prospective 
donor’s  suitability  for stem  cell donation prior to initiation  of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s  
conditioning therapy.  In the event  of circumstances  where a deviation  from  the 
standard donor criteria  for transplant is noted,  including biological product deviations, 
appropriate rationale  for donor selection  will be required  in writing,  along with the 
informed consent of both the donor and the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  If indicated, this will also reflect  
consensus from  a weekly  BMT  Team  Meeting  discussion, documented in writing.  In 
the event  of a biological product deviation (stem  cell contamination, damage during  
storage,  or suboptimal  stem cell yield),  written  documentation of discussion with and 
approval  for use (including the rationale)  by [CONTACT_812473]. 
 
• On a case by [CONTACT_413],  patients  will be considered for their appropriateness for outpatient stem 
cell transplant (autologous or non-myeloablative allogeneic),  depending on several  factors,  
including but not  necessarily  limited  to the following:  
o Personal patient  and caregiver  desire for and commitment  to outpatient transplant  
 
 
Mobilization Trial 05/16/2017 
 Page 33 
 o Patient  compliance  and caregiver  competency/reliability  
o Appropriate home and/or local  environment availability  (e.g., hotel, VNA  services)  
o Suitability  of conditioning regimen  for outpatient  therapy  
o No other  medical  condition  that may complicate  outpatient  therapy.  
 
• Re-evaluation of transplant assessment  will occur in these  two instances:  
o If more  than [ADDRESS_1125052]  or peripheral  blood stem  cell 
(PBSC)  collection  and transplant,  the need for reconfirmation of eligibility  will 
be assessed.  
o Patients  who do not meet  the transplant criteria upon their initial  assessment  will be 
re- evaluated  when  deemed  appropriate by [CONTACT_812474].  The patient’s  
treatment  plan will take into consideration the individual  issue(s)  which  have 
precluded  the patient  from  transplant, determinations of whether they are 
modifiable,  and the appropriate time frames  for re-evaluation.  
 
FOR  ALLOGENEIC  TRANSPLANT  PATIENTS  ONLY  
• As allogeneic patients  are evaluated,  the EBMTR  and Hematopoietic  Stem  Cell Transplant Co-
morbidity Index (HCT -CI) scores  will be assessed  in an effort  to select  those patients that will 
optionally  do best with an allogeneic  stem  cell transplant.  These results  will be documented 
in the patient’s  medical  record.  
 
EBMT Risk  Score 
• It is sometimes  difficult to determine a patient’s  risk when  deciding if a patient is a candidate 
for transplant. The European  Blood  and Marrow  transplant (EBMT)  Group developed  a risk 
score to assess  potential allogeneic  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_812452]. The EBMTR  group identified  
5 patient  and donor  characteristic,  including: 
o Patient  age 
o Disease  stage  
o Time  from  diagnosis  to transplant,  
o Donor type 
o Donor- recipi[INVESTIGATOR_812453]  
• These  5 traits  were  examined  in 56,505 allogeneic  transplant patients  (myeloablative  and non-
ablative  regimens),  with various hematologic malignancies  and were predicative of survival 
and treatment-  related  mortality.

I. Purpose  
The purpose of this Job Aid is educational  information surrounding the selecting  of 
conditioning therapy  prior to hematopoietic  stem  cell transplantation  (HSCT).  
 
A. Selection  of Appropriate  Patients  for Hematopoietic  Stem Cell Transplant  
 
• The recipi[INVESTIGATOR_812456],  including the stem  cell mobilization  and collection  process  
(autologous recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]),  high-dose  chemotherapy,  stem  cell infusion, infectious 
complications,  organ compromise,  and graft-versus - host disease (allogeneic  
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]).  
 
• These issues  require  early  thoughtful  discussion  with the prospective hematopoietic  
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841],  along  with consideration  of relative  risk in the context  of the specific medical  
history and overall state of health  of this individual. 
 
• Established  eligibility  for high-dose chemotherapy  followed by [CONTACT_812477], 
depending on the overall  status  of the patient  in question and circumstances  surrounding 
the transplant. 
 
B. Selection  of High -Dose  Chemotherapy  Regimens  Prior  to Hematopoietic  Transplant  
 
• The conditioning (preparative)  regimen  is a critical  factor  in the hematopoietic  stem  
cell process,  with objectives  that differ between  the allogeneic  and autologous 
settings: 
 
• Conditioning Regimen  Objectives  
 

 
 
Mobilization Trial 05/16/2017 
 Page 40 
 a. Allogeneic  
 Ablation of host immunity  (to prevent rejection  of the transplanted  donor 
graft) 
 Tumoricidal activity  (when  malignant  disease  is present)  
 
b. Autologous 
 Tumoricidal activity  
 Steep  dose-response curve 
 Lack  of cross  resistance with other drugs 
 Low extra- medullary  dose- limiting  toxicity  
• More  specific factors  in the selection  of the pre-transplant preparative agents  relate to potential  
toxicities  of a potential  conditioning regimen  in the context  of the patient’s  pre-transplant  status,  
the relative toxicity  of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_812457].  For example,  a patient  with a 
history  of Hodgkin’s disease including a prior mediastinal mass  that required  radiation  would 
not be an optimal candidate for a BCNU -containing conditioning regimen,  given  the combined 
risks  for interstitial pneumonitis. 
 
• Alternately,  older patients  with a characteristically  lower  threshold for neurologic toxicity  are 
less optimal candidates  for high-dose cytarabine,  given  that cerebellar  toxicity  is a primary  
extra-  medullary  side effect  of this agent.  
 
• The extra- medullary  dose limiting  toxicities  of several  common  conditioning agents are listed  
below:  
 
Extra -medullary  Dose  Limiting  Toxicities  
Therapy  Possible  Toxicities  
Carmustine  (BCNU)  lung (interstitial  pneumonitis)  
Etoposide  (VP-16) mucositis;  liver 
Cytarabine  (Ara-C) CNS  ataxia;  mucositis  
Busulfan  veno -occlusive  disease  (VOD);  seizures;  lung;  mucositis  
Cyclophosphamide  hemorrhagic  cystitis;  heart  failure  
Total  body  irradiation  (TBI)  lung;  heart  
 
• Commonly Used  Conditioning Regimens  for HSCT  
a. Autologous 
• Melphalan  
• Melphalan  & Velcade  
• CBV  – Cyclophosphamide, Carmustine  & Etoposide 
 
 
Mobilization Trial 05/16/2017 
 Page 41 
 • BEAM  – Carmustine,  Etoposide, Cytarabine & Melphalan  
 
b. Allogeneic  
• Non-Myeloablative 
 Fludarabine/Total Body  Irradation  (Flu/TBI)  
 Fludarabine/Busulfan (Dosing for Busulfan 9.6 mg/kg)  
• Reduced  Intensity 
 Fludarabine/Cyclophosphamide (Dosing for Cytoxan  120 mg/kg)  
 Fludarabine/Melphalan 
 Flurabine/Bulsulfan  (Dosing for Busulfan 6.4 mg/kg)  
• Myeloablative 
 Bulsulfan/Cyclophosphamide (BuCy)  
 Cyclophosphamide/Total Body  Irradiation  (Cy/TBI) 
 Fludarabine/Cyclophosphamide (Dosing for Cytoxan  3 mg/m2) 
 
 
• Ultimately,  the final decision  regarding  the choice of pre-transplant conditioning 
regimens  is made  on the basis  of a combination of factors,  including patient -related  
issues (as discussed above),  the disease  in question  (e.g., CBV  being used typi[INVESTIGATOR_812458]),  and personal experience and preference on 
the part of the transplant  center  and its BMT  team.  
 
• Each  potential transplant patient  is discussed  2-3 times  at the BMT  team  meetings  
(Tuesday or  Thursday), with representation  from  Transfusion Medicine,  Cellular  
Therapy,  and Pharmacy.  The patient’s  medical  history is reviewed,  and selection  of a 
treatment  regimen  is finalized.  
 
• As a double -check,  the BMT  Coordinators will confirm  the preparative regimen  with the 
Attending  when  the orders  are being  written.

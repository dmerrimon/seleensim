Revision Total Knee Arthroplasty  
Sponsor  Orthogenics  
Sites  Cleveland Clinic Main Campus (Cleveland, OH) and Cleveland 
Clinic [LOCATION_012] (Weston, FL)  
Objectives  To investigate whether there are quantifiable differences in the level 
of calprotectin in t he synovial fluid that allow separation of different 
modes of joint implant failure (e.g. infected, aseptic loosening).  A 
subset of primary TKA patients  (with history of OA)  will be 
included as a  baseline.  
Design  Prospective clinical  trial involvi ng pati ents undergoing primary or 
revision TKA.  
Test Product  Calprotectin POC test  is a lateral flow device that detects 
calprotectin, a marker of inflammation, in the synovial fluid.  
Number of 
Patients  N=30 primary TKA  
N=120 revision TKA (of which, n=70 aseptic and n=50 septic)  
Procedure  Synovial fluid will be collected pre -operatively or intra -operatively 
from patients meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and will be 
tested for infection using the Calprotectin POC test , which will be 
validated agai nst then CALPRO Calprotectin ELISA test . 
Statistical 
Methods  Diagnostic parameters of Calprotectin POC test  will be assessed 
using the MSIS criteria as the gold standard .

 II. Background  
 
Total knee arthroplasty  (TKA)  is considered to be a very successful procedure which has 
changed treatment of severe degenerative joint disease, improving the quality of life of 
millions [1,2] .  However, infection of these implants, called periprosthetic joint infection (PJI), is 
a serious complicat ion of arthroplasty [3].  PJI can lead to additional surgeries, revision, fusion, 
and other adverse events. It is important to accurately diagnose PJI, because its management 
differs from that of other causes of arthroplasty failure.  
  
Unfortunately, no single test or clinical sign is currently available to diagnose infection. The 
class ic signs of infection such as redness, warmth, swelling and pain can result from a variety of 
septic and aseptic etiologies. Additionally, some cases of PJI, especially those caused by [CONTACT_565622], are often associated with relatively little redness , warmth, swelling and pain.  Though 
rare, the only clinical sign that has been strongly associated with PJI is a sinus tract leading from 
the skin to the joint. Although clinical signs and symptoms should alert a clinician to the 
possibility of infection,  there is general agreement in the field that they are not useful in making 
a definitive diagnosis. Therefore, a combination of laboratory testing techniques has guided the 
diagnostic decision -making related to PJI [4–6].  
 
Recognizing the limitations of any one test for diagnosing PJI, the Mus culoskeletal Infection 
Society (MSIS) has generated a criteria -based definition of PJI for diagnosing PJI [6]. This 
criteria -based definition of PJI places emphasis on culture techniques that identify pathogens.  
However, because the diagnostic sensit ivity of cultures is about 70% [7,8] , and because tissue 
culture results from intraoperative samples are only available after surgery, the MSIS definition 
also includes serological and synov ial inflammatory markers that can be used to diagnose PJI. A 
major disadvantage of the MSIS criteria -based definition of PJI is that two of the essential 
criteria, tissue culture and histological analysis, are only available after surgery.  In cases where 
the surgical samples are critical for the diagnosis of infection, the physician may need to adjust 
his or her treatment post operatively for the patient based on the treatment provided.  The 
availability of a preoperative test that correlates well with the  MSIS criteria could improve 
patient care.  Although the currently available pre -operative tests have been shown to be useful, 
these tests often require laboratory expertise, and the results may not be available in a timely 
fashion. Therefore, there has be en growing interest in point of care (POC) test for the diagnosis 
of infection.  
 
Currently, some of the POC tests available include the alpha defensin and leucocyte esterase 
(LE) tests. Both these test measure markers of infection present in the synovial f luid. The LE 
test, though cheap and easy to perform, is easily affected by [CONTACT_565623] [9,10] . Although centrifugation of the bloody samples might improve the accuracy of the LE 
test, it is cumbersome, and not easily available. As a result, a large number of bloody samples are 
 
[ADDRESS_742940] which has sensitivity of about 70% [11].  Although the clinical results of this are 
promising, they are not as good as previous studies using alpha -defensin levels measured in a 
laboratory [11]. Moreover, there are concerns that the alpha defensing test will yield false 
positive results in ca ses of metal on metal revisions [12]. Therefore, better tests are required.  
 
 
III. Rationale  
 
Calprotectin  is a biomarker closely associated with leucocytes in general, and is present in high 
volumes in neutrophil cells [13–15] . Calprotectin is also produced by [CONTACT_565624], where calprotectin is released upon phagocytosis [16].In neutrophils, calprotectin is 
stored intracel lularly and are released upon activation of the cell. The determination of number 
of neutrophils and proportion of neutrophils out of total number of inflammatory cells is a 
diagnostic strategy commonly used in diagnosis of infection [6,17] . Upon encounter with a 
pathogen, neutrophils have several strategies to fight infections , and produce high -levels of 
calprotectin [13,18] . Activation of neutrophils, and release of calprotectin, can be for any reason 
causing activation of the complement system and aseptic Inflammatory responses [13]. Moreover, 
Calprotectin is a danger associated molecular patterns (DAMP) signal influencing the 
inflammatory responses [14]. The lev el of activated neutrophils in PJI provide basis of the 
presence of calprotectin in the synovial fluid of PJI patients, and thus, for calprotectin as a 
potential biomarker for PJI. Calprotectin -levels in the synovial fluid do not merely reflect the 
level o f leucocytes and neutrophils present in the synovial fluid, but levels are correlated to the 
WBC content. Calprotectin is likely to reflect the number of activated cells and surpass the 
diagnostic accuracy of total WBC counts and neutrophil percentage for PJI diagnosis.  
 
Wouthuyzen -Bakker et al. [19] demonstra ted that a level of calprotectin of 50 mg/L in the 
synovial fluid has very good diagnostic accuracy for PJI, supported by [CONTACT_565625] 0.9. This break point produced a negative predictive value (NPV) of 95% for 
all 42 patients i n the study. In a subgroup analysis for patients with chronic PJI, a NPV of 97% 
was observed [19]. The excellent NPV may assist in the orthopaedic clinic to rule out the 
presence of infection and consider diagnostic alternatives for aseptic loosening and pain revision 
of the joint patient. A rapid and accurate distinction between these two causes is important as PJI 
and aseptic loosening are managed differently with regards to surgical Intervention and follow -
up.  
 
Point of Care Test diagnostics by l ateral flow devices provides reliable test results within 
minut es of sample  collection. Currently, Calprotectin can be detected by [CONTACT_565626] (developed by [CONTACT_565627], Tromsø, Norway ). The speed and ease of use of this test 
allow s for diagnosis at patient’s bed side . These tests  can be applied in the p hysician's office, 
 
6  Calprotectin Protocol_Version 1 .10_3-17-20 
 operating room, an ambulance, the home, the field, or in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. As the results are timely 
they allow rapid diagnostic and identifies treatment alternatives for the patient. This technology 
empowers clinicians to make decisions at the "point -of-care", and can have significant impact on 
health care delivery and ability to address challenges of health disparities. However, it is 
important to validate the diagnostic utility of calprotectin POC in a diverse set of patients 
undergoing re vision arthroplasty.  
 
 
IV. Hypothesis  
 
The study hypothesis is that the use of Calprotectin  POC test  will help differentiate between septic 
and aseptic failure following TKA.  
 
 
V. Aims  
 
Compare levels of calprotectin in these different patient groups:  
 septic revisions v aseptic loosening  
 aseptic loosening v other non -infected failure modes  
 primary knees stratified by [CONTACT_565628]  (or simply for baseline comparison?)  
 
 
VI. Study Setting  
 
This will be a prospective clinical trial. Patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty will be 
eligible to participate in this study. The clinical trial will be conducted with samples 
collected at a Cleveland Clinic Main Campus (Cleveland, OH) and Cleveland Clinic 
[LOCATION_012]  (Weston, FL)  with high volume s of revision surgery. The g oal is to enroll  n=30 
primary TKA patients, n=70 aseptic revision TKA patients, and n=[ADDRESS_742941] Inclusion Criteria

  Subject signs informed consent form. English Speaking  
 
 
Subject Exclusion Criteria  
 MSIS criteria labs no older than 60 days  (revision cases only)  
 Results are not available for medical tests required to perform MSIS classification  (revision 
cases only)  
 Sample was obtained via lavage  
 Quantity not sufficient  (at least  1 ml required) . 
 
VIII.  Study Procedure  
 
Synovial fluid samples will be collected from the affected joint either during pre -operative work -
up or intraoperatively . Sample will be transported to testing site. Once the sample is received by 
[CONTACT_565629], fluid will be first aliquoted for use in the physician -ordered 
diagnostic laboratory testing. The remainder of the specimen will be used for Calprotectin testing 
using the testing protocol described by [CONTACT_565627].  The specimen for the MSIS criteria labs 
need not be collected at the same time as specimen used for the Calprotectin POC test. In brief, 
the Calprotectin  POC testing technology utilizes the natural occurring liquid movement through 
membranes, and by [CONTACT_565630] (gold or 
latex), biomarker detection in the fluid can be achieved. When Calprotectin is pres ent in the 
fluid, a test line will form together with a control line that demonstrate the validity of the test. 
The test will be read as: green (no inflammation), yellow (moderate inflammation) or red 
(massive inflammation). This will then be validated by [CONTACT_565631]. ELISA samples will be diluted 20x for a primary TKA sample and 
1000x for a revision TKA sample.  
 
 
The septic revision cases will be defined using MSIS criteria. All non -infected revision patients 
are considered as aseptic cases.  MSIS criteria -defined PJI diagnosis will be determined by [CONTACT_565632] -physician adjudication panel with expertise in infection who have access to all 
the necessary patient data for clinical diagnosis (eg, all MSIS crit eria and patient history).  The 
adjudication panel will be blinded to the results of the Calprotectin  POC t est. There are two 
major criteria, and five minor criteria in the MSIS definition of PJI.  The existence of one 
positive major criterion is sufficien t for the diagnosis of PJI.  Similarly, the existence of any 
three of the five positive minor criteria is considered sufficient for the diagnosis of PJI.  Table 1 
presents the MSIS criteria based definition of PJI.  
 
Table 1: MSIS Workgroup Standard Definit ion for PJI [6] 
One of the following must be met for diagnosis of PJI.  
 
[ADDRESS_742942] communicating with the prosthesis (major criteria);    
2.  A pathogen is isolated by [CONTACT_565633] (major criteria);  
3.  Three of the following five minor criteria exist:  
      a. Elevated ESR and CRP (ESR≥30mm/hr; CRP≥10mg/L)  
      b. Elevated synovial fluid WBC count (≥ 3000)  
      c. Elevated synovial fluid neutrophil percentage (≥80%)  
      d. Isolation of a microorganism in one periprosthetic tissue or fluid culture  
      e. Greater than 5 neutrophils per high -powered field in 5 high -power fields observed from 
histological analysis of periprosthetic tissue at 400 times magnifica tion 
 
All samples will be classified based on the MSIS criteria into positive (infected) or negative (not 
infected). The MSIS criteria will be considered as the gold -standard for diagnosis.  
 
The interpretation of Calprotectin  POC test will be made in a quantitative way by [CONTACT_565634] a positive or a negative test. A positive test will be the presence of yellow or red 
line. This is expected to improve the sensitivity as Calprotectin POC test  is intended to use  as a 
screening tool. However, additional analysis will be performed for different thresholds.  
 
The aseptic revision cases will be identified first by [CONTACT_565635]. If no loosening 
evident, a bone scan may  be performed.  
 
 
IX. Stability Experiment  
Stability  Experiment Protocol  
Stability 
Definition  The length of time an analyte can be stored at a specific condition without a 
significant change in value and the temperature a specimen with the analyte can be 
stored at a specific condition without a si gnificant change in value.  This is an 
important quality indicator for sample acceptability and result interpretation after 
specimen storage.   
Experiment 
Overview  Four temperature conditions will be tested (room temperature, refrigerated, frozen 
and freez e/thaw cycles) over a designated period of time on at least three (3)  
calprotectin   levels, spanning the device range of 14 -300 mg/L. Each specimen will 
be tested in triplicate for each condition and at baseline  and calprotectin will be  
measured with the Lyfstone Rapid Test.  
Experiment 
Details  1. Create at least three  samples with concentrations in the Low, Mid and High 
ranges of the calprotectin test.  These samples will be prepared using one or 
more samples with high calprotectin  concentrations.  The high sample(s) will be 
leftover from de -identified patient(s) enrolled in his study after the test is 
 
9  Calprotectin Protocol_Version 1 .10_3-17-20 
 performed per the study protocol.  The high sample (s) will be diluted as 
needed to reach the target concentrations using never froz en leftover synovial 
fluid from the clinical laboratory as the diluent.  The use of leftover de -identified 
synovial fluids was approved by [CONTACT_565636]. Up 
to 40 mLs synovial fluid will be used.  
2. The following conditions will be tested for each sample in triplicate:  
a. Time Zero (T0 ), baseline result  
b. Room Temperature (RT), room temperature near 25°C, tested at two 
(2), four (4) and eight (8) hour intervals  
c. Refrigerated (REF) (2 -8°C), tested  at ten (10 ) and twenty -four (24) hour 
intervals  
d. Frozen (F) ( -90 to -70°C) with two (2) freeze thaw cycles. Freeze thaw 
cycle defined  as: Samples will be completely frozen then removed to 
RT and completely thawed. Upon sample being thawed, one set will be 
tested (1X) and the other  sample will be  placed back in the freezer to 
completely freeze. Sample will then be removed from freezer to RT to 
completely thaw and be tested for analyte  (2X) 
3. Assay specimens for Calprotectin concentrations, obtain both qualitative and 
quantitative results, in triplic ate following the IFU  instructions.  
 
Notes:  All r aw data must be saved . Record performance time of assay, stability 
condition of specimen, and qualitative and quantitative values documented .  
Residual synovial fluid specimens will be used as  matrix for  this experiment to dilute 
a known high value of calprotectin from already tested knee synovial fluid samples  
as described above . The standard c alprotectin (64.25 mg/L  CALPRO AS, Norway) 
may also be spi[INVESTIGATOR_565618].  
 
Data   Qualitative agreement: After storage, the qualitative result is in agreement 
with the baseline (T0) result for all samples.  
 Quantitative agreement: Samples will be analyzed for % bias from baseline 
(T0) using the following equation  
 
%𝐵𝑖𝑎𝑠 
 
=(𝐼𝑛𝑖𝑡 𝑖𝑎𝑙 𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒  𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛  (𝑋𝑋) 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑢𝑙𝑡 −𝑇0 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 )

X. Data Collection  
 
Data will be collected preoperatively,  and during surgery  or the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].   All data will be 
entered and maintained in REDCap,  an electronic data capture tools hosted at Cleveland 
Clinic [20]. REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web -based application 
designed to support data capture for research studies, providing 1) an intuitive interface for 
validated data entry; 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulatio n and export procedures; 3) 
automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages; and 4) 
procedures for importing data from external sources.   
   
 
The following will be collected on all patients in the study:  
1. Demographics  –MRN, Age, Gender, BMI, Race, Smoking status, Joint type , current anti -
inflammatory medications, history of inflammato ry disease, ongoing antibiotic therapy, history of 
infectious disease  
2. Comorbidities – Charlson or Elixhauser cormorbidity index  
3. Surgical history - Previous joint replacement related surgeries , severe synovitis status  
4. Laboratory values - ESR/CRP, WBC , RBC , PMN%, LE (optional) , Culture, Histology , 
hemolysis index , synovasure (alpha defensin) test when available ,  
5. Imaging  – Xrays and bon e scans (if available)  
6. Calprotectin results  (POC and ELISA result)

 Samples are considered stable if the value is within ±30% bias; larger bias 
will be investigated to rule out experimental issues.  D ue to the higher 
imprecision observed in previous experiments, this target may be revisited 
after obtaining the data.  
 Analyze data using a statistical software.  
Notes  This experiment represents the minimum verification necessary, and the medical 
director  may require additional steps. An open conversation should be maintained 
during the entire verification.

XI. Analysis  
 
 
A. Statistical analysis  
 
Descriptive statistics will be generated for demographics and medical history. Categorical 
variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_3228]. Continuous variables will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_67067] (N), mean, standard dev iation (SD), median, minimum 
and maximum, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).  
 
For testing of diagnostic utility, MSIS criteria will be used at the gold -standard for PJI. The 
following diagnostic parameters will be evaluated: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive 
value, negative predictive value and accuracy. Additionally, re ceiver operating characteristics 
curves will be plotted. Calprotectin test will be considered to be positive when there is at least 
moderate or massive inflammation (i.e. yellow or red). The diagnostic parameters will also be 
evaluated considering only mas sive inflammation (red) as positive.  
 
The Calprotectin test will be validated by [CONTACT_565637].  
 
Subgroup analysis will be performed based on the infecting organism type,  joint, and presence of 
inflammatory conditions.

XII. Data Safety  
The sample obtained from the patient will be stored at the testing site at -80°. At the end of 
the study, the samples will be transported to the site of principal investigator. Only members 
of the study team (i.e. the personnel listed on the IRB application) will have access to 
protected health information of patients included in this study. All data procurement in this 
research project will utilize the standard of care follow -up visits to coll ect study data. Only 
secure computers will be used on main campus, all will be password protected. Only 
investigators approved by [CONTACT_565638]. The data will be 
maintained in the patient’s medical records, unaltered from its form prior to the study.  
 
XIII.  Co-enrollment  
Patients from IRB 16 -549 may b e co-enrolled in this trial. As this trial is observational no special 
consideration need to be made for recruitment and enrollment. Patients will be identified 
independently using a search of scheduled cases on EPIC by [CONTACT_565639]. Patients who are eligible for both studies will then be contact[CONTACT_565640]. Patients will also be sent a copy of the consent form for the given trial for their 
review via mail or email, based on their preference. Patients will then formally con sented with all 
signatures necessary obtained on the day of surgery  for each study independently using a consent 
form for each study .

Primary Efficacy Analyses : 
There are no primary endpoint s in this Phase 2a study.  
Secondary Efficacy Analyses : 
There are no secondary endpoint s in this Phase 2a study.  
Safety Variables : 
Adverse events  (AEs)  will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary. Frequencies 
and percentages of subjects with treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), 
serious TEAEs, and TEAEs causing premature discontinuation will be provided 
by [CONTACT_34689]. An AE is treatment emergent if it occurs or worsens after the 
first dose of study treatment. Furthermore, frequencies will be given of subjects 
with TEAEs by [CONTACT_9313], by [CONTACT_6657], by 
[CONTACT_9313], pre ferred term and maximal severity, by [CONTACT_9313], 
preferred term and strongest relationship, and by [CONTACT_9313], preferred 
term, maximal severity, and strongest relationship. Separate summaries will be 
performed for ocular and non -ocular AEs.   
Other safety endpoints including visual a cuity, slit -lamp biomicroscopy, 
undilated fundoscopy, and intraocular pressure will be summarized by [CONTACT_514544]. Changes or shifts from baseline will 
also be summarized  where appropriate. For assessments performed by [CONTACT_72067], study 
eye and fellow eye will be summarized separately.

8.1.5 Methods for Assignment to Treatment Groups 
Prior to initiation of study drug (at Visit 1), each subject who qualifies for 
entry will be assigned a screening number. All screening numbers will be 
assigned in strict numerical sequence at a site and no numbers will be 
skipped or omitted. If all inclusion and exclusion criteria are met at 
Visit 1, each qualifying subject will then be assigned a randomization 
number at the end of V

A randomization schedule will be provided to the investigational site. The 
randomization schedule will use block randomization, such that there will 
be an approximate equal number of subjects assigned to each of the three 
treatment arms a

Clinical Trial Protocol ADX-102-DES- [ADDRESS_666850] medical occurrence associated with the 
use of a drug in humans, whether or not the event is considered drug-related.  An 
adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an 
a
bnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease occurring after the subject start ed 
dosing with the study drug, without any judgment about causality.  Any pre-existing 
medical condition that worsens after administration of the study drug will also be 
considered a new adverse event.    
If there is a worsening of a medical condition that was present prior to the 
administration of the study drug, this should also be considered a new adverse event 
and reported.  Any medical condition present prior to the administration of the study 
drug that remains unchanged or improved should not be recorded as an adverse event 
a
t subsequent visits. 
Study drug includes the investigational drug under evaluation. 
Documentation regarding the adverse event should be made as to the nature, date of 
onset, end date, severity, relationship to study drug, action(s) taken, seriousness, and 
outcome
 of any sign or symptom observed by [CONTACT_514545]. 
9.1.1 Severity 
Severity of an adverse event is defined as a qualitative assessment of the 
degree of intensity of an adverse event as determined by [CONTACT_514546]/her by [CONTACT_102]/subject.  The assessment of severity 
is m
ade irrespective of relationship to study drug or seriousness of the 
e
vent and should be evaluated according to the following scale: 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_666851] 
should be determined by [CONTACT_093] (in a blinded manner) using 
these
 explanations:

Confidential Page 32 of 67  
  De finite:  When there are good reason and sufficient 
documentation to demonstrate a direct causal relationship 
between investigational product and adverse event. 
 Probable:  When there are good reasons and sufficient 
documentation to assume a causal relationship in the sense of 
plausible, conceivable, likely but not necessarily highly probable. 
 Possi ble:  When there is sufficient information to accept the 
possibility of a causal relationship in the sense of not impossible 
and not unlikely, although the connection is uncertain or doubtful, 
for example; due to missing data or insufficient evidence. 
 N one: When there is sufficient information to accept a lack of a 
causal relationship, in the sense of impossible and improbable. 
 Unc lassified:  When the causal relationship is not assessable for 
whatever reason due to insufficient evidence, conflicting data or 
poor documentation. 
9.1.3 Expectedness 
The expectedness of an adverse event should be determined based upon 
existing safety information about the study drug using these explanations: 
 Unexpected : An adverse event that is not listed in the 
I
nvestigator ’s brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity 
that ha
s been observed. 
 Expected : An adverse event that is listed in the Investigator’s 
broc
hure at the specificity and severity that has been observed. 
 Not Applicable : Any adverse event that is unrelated to the study 
drug
. 
Adverse events that are mentioned in the Investigator’s brochure as 
oc
curring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological 
properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with 
the particular drug under investigation are to be considered unexpected. 
The investigator should initially classify the expectedness of an adverse 
e
vent, but the final classification is subject to the Medical Monitor’s 
de
termination. 
9.2
 Serious Adverse Events 
An adverse event is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or 
Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death; 
 A life-threatening adverse event; 
Note
:  An adverse event is considered “li fe-threatening” if, in the view of 
e
ither the investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject

 I npatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
Note:  The term “inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any inpatient admission 
(even if less than 24 hours).  For chronic or long-term inpatients, inpatient 
admission includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care 
inpatient unit.  Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80676]:  emergency room 
visits; outpatient/same-day/ambulatory procedures; observation/short stay 
units; rehabilitation facilities; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593]; nursing homes; or clinical 
research/phase 1 units. 
Note
:  The term “prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any 
extension of an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_514542]. 
 A pe rsistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions; 
Note:  A serious adverse event specifically related to visual threat would be 
int
erpreted as any potential impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes (e.g., 
he
morrhage, retinal detachment, central corneal ulcer or damage to the optic 
nerve). 
 A c ongenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, are life-threatening, or

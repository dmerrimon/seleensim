PROTOCOL TITLE: Duration of Untreated Psychosis and Perceived Barriers to Mental 
Health Care Among College Students
HRRC#: 19-174 Page 2 of 19Version Date: 7/05/[ZIP_CODE].0Objectives
Increased duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), defined as the time from 
manifestation of the first psychotic symptom(s) to initiation of evidence-based treatment, 
is associated with poorer clinical and functional outcomes (Fusar-Poli et al., 2009). 
Factors associated with longer DUP include perceived barriers to care among those 
experiencing psychotic-like symptoms and feelings of not being listened to or not being 
offered the opportunity to make decisions regarding treatment (referred to as shared-
decision making). The primary objective of our proposed study is to investigate the 
association between DUP and perceptions regarding barriers to care and shared-
decision making among college students. The secondary objective is to conduct a 
process evaluation of the inclusion of a screening tool (the Prodromal Questionnaire 
Brief- PQ-B developed by [CONTACT_322815]., 2011) during triage at University of New Mexico 
Student Health and Counseling Center (SHAC). SHAC implemented the PQ-B August 
1st, [ADDRESS_398653] 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_16743] (FEP) and referring those identified at high risk to coordinated 
specialty care programs (i.e., Early and CONNECT) in the Department of Psychiatry and 
Behavioral Sciences, University of New Mexico. The Early Program is a coordinated 
specialty care program for the young adults experiencing first epi[INVESTIGATOR_16743] (FEP) 
while the CONNECT program provides stepped care to young individuals at clinical high 
risk (CHR) of developi[INVESTIGATOR_322796]. 
The specific aims are to:
1. Measure DUP among University of New Mexico (UNM) college students enrolled in 
the Early or CONNECT Programs in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral 
Sciences and identify other factors that may contribute to longer DUP, such as 
perceptions relating to barriers to mental health care and shared decision-making. 
We hypothesize that there will be: (1) a positive association between DUP and the 
number of perceived barriers to care, and (2) a negative association between DUP 
and feelings of shared-decision making. 
2.Collect process level data related to the implementation of the PQ-B at SHAC, 
including the number of PQ-Bs completed by [CONTACT_322816]; the number of 
students who meet the cut-off score on the PQ-B; responses to specific items on the 
PQ-B; and basic demographic and clinical characteristics for those who complete the 
PQ-B [i.e., age, gender, ethnicity, level of education,  feelings of depression as 
measured by [CONTACT_199005]-9 (PHQ-9) and feelings around 
alcohol use as measured by [CONTACT_322817]. CAGE stands for Cut, Annoyed, Guilty and 
Eye based on the four questions in the screening tool that indicates a substance 
abuse problem. The four questions include: (1) Have you ever felt you should cut 
down on your drinking? (2) Have people annoyed you by [CONTACT_322818]? (3) 
Have you felt bad or guilty about your drinking? And (4) have you ever had a drink 
first think in the morning to steady your nerves or to get rid of a hangover (eye-
opener)? All of these data are collected as part of standard clinical practice at triage 
among students seeking services at SHAC. Among those students who meet the 
cutoff, we are also interested in tracking the number of students who are referred to 
Early and CONNECT and, if not referred, the reasons for not being referred. 
2.0Background
2.[ADDRESS_398654], the DUP is a 
strong predictor of outcome, such that current clinical recommendations are <3-6 months 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Duration of Untreated Psychosis and Perceived Barriers to Mental 
Health Care Among College Students
HRRC#: 19-174 Page 3 of 19Version Date: 7/05/2022(Compton et al., 2008). Second, in the U.S., individuals are still presenting with DUP on 
average of two years (Marshall et al., 2005). Third, the reasons for treatment delay are 
multiple and complex (Apelodoorn et al., 2014). Various classifications have been 
developed to categorize the factors that contribute to an extended DUP. Compton and 
Broussard (2011) for example, identified six categories, including: (i) demographic, (ii) 
premorbid and onset-related, (iii) illness-related, (iv) family-level, (v) societal, and (vi) 
health system and service level factors. 
With the first symptoms of psychosis being most likely to surface around ages 15 to 24, 
college age young adults are at increased risk of FEP and CHR of psychosis (Kessler et 
al., 2007; Simon et al., 2017). Studies on the course of schizophrenia indicate that the 
initial onset of the disorder shows a steep increase during adolescence and young 
adulthood and then begins to decrease around the age of 25 (Hafner et al., 1993; Sham 
et al., 1994). Simon et al., (2017) reported a FEP incidence rate of [ADDRESS_398655], lack of identification of mental health symptoms and/or treatment 
have surfaced as system-level challenges on college campuses. This contributes to the 
persistence of mental health problems among students, partly due to the under-
resourcing of college mental health services in relationship to needs. Lastly, many 
college students are in the process of transitioning between adolescence to adulthood 
and may be less likely to recognize when to seek help or to feel comfortable with 
accessing services independent of family support. 
Screening has been shown to be a valid and reliable way of identifying individuals at 
high risk of psychosis, and those who have a higher likelihood of transition to psychosis 
in various contexts for clinical referral (Jarrett et al., 2012; Kline and Schiffman, 2014). 
When Rietdijk and colleagues screened all individuals between the ages of 18 and 35 
entering secondary mental health services for non-psychotic conditions with the 
Prodromal Questionnaire (PQ) 92-item version, a three-fold higher prevalence of at-risk 
mental states was detected among the population that was universally screened 
compared to a population that was referred to a diagnostic center of an early psychosis 
clinic based on clinical concerns alone (Rietdijk et al., 2012). Studies on the 
effectiveness of screening for psychosis among college students are scarce. Loewy et 
al., assessed the rates of self-reported “prodromal” psychotic symptoms and related 
distress among 1,020 college students at a university in [LOCATION_004] using the PQ 92-item 
version (Lowey et al., 2007). Forty-three percent of students reported ≥ 8 items (the 
suggested cutoff from the initial PQ validation study). The proportion was 2% when the 
cutoff was modified to ≥8 items rated as distressing (the addition of a distress qualifier is 
intended to improve specificity and thereby [CONTACT_322819]). A 
Chinese version of the PQ-16 was used to determine the prevalence of attenuated 
psychotic syndrome among 579 college students in China (Chen et al., 2014). Using a 
cutoff of ≥ six, 9.3% screened positive. Among 49 who completed a follow-up interview, 
20 (40%) met the criteria for a prodromal risk syndrome as per the Structured Interview 
for Psychosis-Risk Syndrome (SIPS) diagnostic criteria.

Health Care Among College Students
HRRC#: 19-174 Page 4 of 19Version Date: 7/05/[ZIP_CODE].[ADDRESS_398656] to barriers to care, research has shown that as high as 85% of college-age 
students do not seek treatment when experiencing a mental health problem (Blanco et 
al., 2008) despi[INVESTIGATOR_322797] 9% to 33% (Hunt and Eisenberg, 2010). Not engaging in treatment for mental 
health problems can significantly interfere with educational outcome (Eisenberg et al., 
2009).  There are numerous barriers that hinder access to mental health services, 
especially for college age young adults. Barriers include, for example, stigma, negative 
attitudes about treatment providers, poverty, lack of symptom recognition, lack of 
knowing where to get help, lack of transportation, and feelings of disempowerment 
(Jennings et al., 2017). Furthermore, in the literature on why people fail to engage or 
disengage from care, not feeling listened to and not being offered the opportunity to 
make decisions and collaborate in treatment (O’Brien et al., 2009) have been identified 
as contributors. Indeed, shared-decision making, an approach to providing person-
centered care, has been shown to be a critical factor associated with engagement in 
coordinated specialty care for first epi[INVESTIGATOR_16743] (Hamilton et al., 2018; Heinssen et 
al., 2014). The goal will be to transfer what we learn about perceived barriers to care and 
shared-decision making into practice by [CONTACT_12780][INVESTIGATOR_322798]-decision making so that fewer 
college students will go without necessary mental health care and specialty services.
 
While research on screening for first epi[INVESTIGATOR_322799], in general behavioral health-related screening (e.g., for depression, suicidal 
ideation, alcohol use) among college populations has proven to be effective and to 
increase access to care (Shepardson et al., 2014).  As summarized by [CONTACT_322820]., 
“Screening for psychosis may represent a fast, effective solution to identification of early 
psychosis, without the need for additional expertise” (pg. 689) Savill et al., 2018). 
2.3. Contribution to the Literature. Upon successful completion of the proposed 
research, we expect our contribution to the literature to be preliminary data on DUP 
among college students and perceptions regarding barriers to receiving mental health 
care and shared-decision making.
The quality improvement data will also contribute to the literature on screening for first 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_322800] a college population.

assessed during the intake visit through a clinical assessment and the Structured 
Interview of Prodromal Symptoms (SIPS) (Miller et al., 2003) The SIPS will be 
completed by [CONTACT_322821], who are certified in its 
administration. The SIPS is a structured diagnostic interview and includes the Scale of 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Duration of Untreated Psychosis and Perceived Barriers to Mental 
Health Care Among College Students
HRRC#: 19-174 Page 5 of 19Version Date: 7/05/2022Prodromal Symptoms (SOPS); Schizotypal Personality Disorder Checklist, a family 
history questionnaire and a well-anchored version of the Global Assessment of 
Functioning Scale. The SIPS takes approximately 60-90 minutes to complete depending 
on clinical status. Those determined eligible for either program based on the clinical 
assessment and SIPS will be invited to participate in the study.  A copy of the SIPS has 
not been included as attachments as it is a   copyrighted instruments. More information 
about the SIPS can be found on the Prime Psychosis Prodrome Research Clinic 
website.

rganizationId=109519. 
It is important to note that patients who enter either program may complete other clinical 
assessments as part of standard clinical care. While results from these assessments will 
not be used to determine eligibility for this study, they may be used in the proposed 
study to describe the study population. We will be asking permission to use the data 
from these standard clinical assessments through the consent process.
3.2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. Eligible participants included in the study will be: (1) 
15-[ADDRESS_398658] program for an intake, (2) who screen positive for clinical high risk or 
FEP , and (3) agree to participate in the study. Participants will be excluded if: (1) they 
are below the age of 15 years old or above the age of 30, (2) are not UNM college 
students, (3) screen negative for clinical high risk or FEP, (4) refuse to participate in the 
study, and/or (5) are cognitively unable to provide informed consent as demonstrated by 
a brief cognitive screen prior to completion of the enrollment interview. Cognitive 
capacity to consent to research participation will be assessed by [CONTACT_322822] [ADDRESS_398659], 
2020, SHAC extended the universal screening to include risk of psychosis 
through the inclusion of the PQ-B. Universal screening means that all students 
who seek counseling services at SHAC complete the PQ-B at triage. 
Inclusion of Special Populations. 
Adults unable to consent: Those determined unable to provide consent through the brief 
cognitive screen in Attachment 1 will not be enrolled in the study (see Attachment 1 - 
Evaluation to Sign an Informed Consent Document for Research).  
Individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers): While we expect the 
majority of participants to be between 18 and 30, participants as young as 15 may be 
enrolled into the study. Participants younger than 18 will indicate their assent to 
participate in the study by [CONTACT_2960] a child assent form, which will be co-signed by a 
parent or legal guardian (See consent form). Both the child and the parent/ legal 
guardian must consent for the participants between the ages of 15 and 17 to participate 
in the research. 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Duration of Untreated Psychosis and Perceived Barriers to Mental 
Health Care Among College Students
HRRC#: 19-174 Page 6 of 19Version Date: 7/05/2022According to UNM main campus enrollment reports, approximately 1% of students are 
less than 18 years of age. While it will be unlikely that a student less than 18 years of 
age will complete the PQ-B the NM Statutes stipulate that “A child fourteen years of 
age or older has the right to consent to and receive individual psychotherapy, 
group psychotherapy, guidance counseling or other forms of verbal therapy and 
information regarding such counseling is confidential. This means that students 
ages 16 or 17who enter SHAC for counselling will be asked to complete the PQ-
B as part of standardized  SHAC triage process
Pregnant women: 
Pregnant women are not the focus of this study, and research deals with mental health 
issues of the young in general.
Students at SHAC may be pregnant when accessing counseling services. As a result, 
they may complete the PQ-B screening tool. There is no evidence to suggest that the 
completion of the screening tool will be harmful to pregnant women.
Prisoners:  Prisoners will not be included in the study.
Prisoners will not be completing the PQ-B screening tool. Only students seeking 
counseling services at SHAC will complete the screening tool.

Overview of research procedures being performed and when they are performed. 
Participants will be recruited among UNM college students and who are determined 
eligible for the proposed study (see inclusion criteria Section 3.2).  Once determined 
eligible, individuals will be invited to participate in the research. Those who agree to 
participate will complete the consent process.  The research coordinator (Justine 
Saavedra) or PI ([CONTACT_322848]) will be responsible for consenting the individual and data 
collection. Data will be collected through completion of standardized tools that have all 
been determined to be reliable, valid and appropriate for the study population (described 
in 9.3). Data will be collected either through (i) face to face interviews, (ii) phone, or (iii) 
HIPAA Compliant Zoom Account. These last two options have been put in place to 
accommodate the social distancing and public health stay at home orders that have 
been put in place by [CONTACT_322824]. Data will be collected after the 
consent process. We will aim to collect data at one point in time. However, due to the 
illness associated with the target population, we may need to split the interview over two 
time periods. Participants will be provided with a $20.[ADDRESS_398662] per 
hour to standardized compensation across participants. We will always round up. For 
example: if a participant completes the surveys in 45 minutes we will give them a $20.[ADDRESS_398663]; if a participant completes the surveys in an hour and a half we will 
give them two $20.[ADDRESS_398664] clinical assessments that were conducted 
on intake. The following instruments will take approximately 2-3 hours to complete. 
Demographic Data: Basic demographic data will be collected on each participant, 
including city of birth, phone number and email (for future contact), current education 
year, date of birth, sex, gender, race and ethnicity. City of birth and full date of birth are 
required to obtain a Global Unique Identifier (GUID) in the NIMH Data Archive. A GUID 
is a subject ID allowing researchers to share data specific to a study participant without 
exposing personally identifiable information. A copy of the demographic form has been 
attached.
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5) (First et al., 2015). The SCID-5 
Research Version will be used to confirm clinical diagnoses for all participants enrolled in 
the research study. Only the sub-units for psychosis, mood disorders, substance abuse 
and trauma-related disorders will be completed. The SCID-5 will be administered by [CONTACT_322825]. 
Duration of Untreated Psychosis (DUP) will be collected using the Circumstances of 
Onset and Relapse Schedule (CORS) (Norman and Malla, 2002). The CORS includes 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Duration of Untreated Psychosis and Perceived Barriers to Mental 
Health Care Among College Students
HRRC#: 19-174 Page 8 of 19Version Date: 7/05/2022the Topography of Psychotic Epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (TOPE), which together traces the process of 
seeking treatment by [CONTACT_322826]-by-step contacts with medical and mental health 
services in the pathway toward contact [CONTACT_322827]. The CORS 
protocol includes specific questions and follow-up prompts to help determine the onset 
of prodromal and psychotic symptoms and pathways to care (Attachment 2). The CORS 
has well established psychometric properties and takes approximately an hour to 
complete. It will be completed by [CONTACT_322828] [INVESTIGATOR_322801]-
structured interviews. While participants identified as at CHR for psychosis, by [CONTACT_108], 
would not yet have had a psychotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], we will similarly record onset of attenuated 
psychosis symptoms in order to better understand barriers and pathways to care for this 
group.
Barriers to care data will be collected using the Barriers to Seeking Psychological Help 
Scale (BSPHS) that was developed to measure barriers related to psychological help-
seeking for college students (Topkaya et al., 2017). The BSPHS is a self-report survey 
with established psychometric properties. It includes 17 items measured on a 5-point 
Likert-type scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree (Attachment #3). The 
items are summed, and higher scores indicate higher obstacles. We added an open-
ended question to the BSPHS that provides an opportunity for participants to identify 
barriers not addressed, such as cultural beliefs that impede help-seeking. We 
determined this additional item to be important given the high prevalence of Hispanics, 
and to a lesser extent, Native Americans among our target population. The BSPHS 
takes approximately 5 minutes to complete.
Data on shared-decision making will be collected via the CollaboRATE Shared Decision 
Making in Clinical Encounters PhenX Measure (Barr et al., 2014; Forcino et al., 2018). 
CollaboRATE is a component of the PhenX Toolkit, a set of well-established and 
validated measures relevant to biomedical research chosen by [CONTACT_322829]. CollaboRATE is self-administered 
and includes 3-items scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale. Higher scores indicate 
greater shared decision making. It takes about a minute to complete. A copy of 
CollaboRATE is attached (#4).
The PQ-B is completed during triage by [CONTACT_322830]. The PQ-B takes approximately 2-[ADDRESS_398665] had any of the 
21 thoughts, feelings and/or experiences in the past month by [CONTACT_62262] “yes” or “no”. 
They are asked to exclude any experiences that occurred only while under the influence 
of alcohol, drugs, or medications that were not prescribed to them. If respondents 
answer yes to any of the items, they are then asked to indicate how distressing that 
experience had been on a Likert-type scale ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly 
agree”.  Two scores are generated, a total PQ-B score and a total distress score. A copy 
of the PQ-B is attached. 
A counselor at SHAC ([CONTACT_322849]) will maintain and share a limited dataset with 
the research team which will include process level data related to the implementation of 
the PQ-B at SHAC. The limited data set includes two dates: the completion date of the 
PQ-B and, for those students who meet the cutoff on the PQ-B, the date of referral to 
Early and/or CONNECT. These dates are required in the process evaluation to be able 
to describe the number of PQ-Bs completed and referrals on a monthly basis.  A list of 
the variables that will be included in the limited dataset is attached. The variables 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Duration of Untreated Psychosis and Perceived Barriers to Mental 
Health Care Among College Students
HRRC#: 19-174 Page 9 of 19Version Date: 7/05/2022selected will allow us to summarize, at an aggregate level, the number of PQ-Bs 
completed by [CONTACT_322816]; the number of students who meet the cut-off score on 
the PQ-B; responses to specific items on the PQ-B; and basic demographic and clinical 
characteristics for those who complete the PQ-B (i.e., age, gender, ethnicity, level of 
education, presence of co-occurring symptoms of depression as measured by [CONTACT_127659]-
9, and signs for alcohol dependence as measured by [CONTACT_322817]). Among those who 
meet the cut-off, the limited dataset will include information on who was referred to Early 
or CONNECT and among those not referred, the reasons for not being referred. 
[CONTACT_322850] will be responsible for assigning a unique identifier to every student at SHAC 
and this unique identifier will be entered into the excel spreadsheet that will be shared 
with the research team. The limited data set will be shared and stored on a shared drive 
created by [CONTACT_322831]. The shared drive is located under the secure Psychiatry O: drive. 
Only [CONTACT_322848], [CONTACT_322851], Dr. McIver (SHAC, Counseling Director) and [CONTACT_322850] 
have access to this shared drive. The limited data set excel sheet is also password 
protected. 
A letter from [CONTACT_322852] McIver, SHAC Counseling Director supporting this sharing of 
information has also been attached. 
A chart review will also be conducted for those students who were referred to 
CONNECT and completed a SIPS, but were then determined ineligible for enrollment in 
the program based on the results. These students were never enrolled in Early or 
CONNECT and were therefore never eligible to be enrolled in the R34 research project. 
We will access their EHR to get basic demographics such as sex, gender, race and 
ethnicity, age at assessment as well as the results of their SIPS assessment to 
determine why students were deemed ineligible. These limited deidentified data will be 
entered into a password protected excel spreadsheet.
One of the goals of this study is to determine if the Prodromal Questionnaire-Brief (PQ-
B) is an appropriate psychosis screening tool among a college population. We currently 
have three excel files that have been populated over the study period. 
The first excel file (referred to as the triage limited database) is maintained by [CONTACT_322832]. 
This excel file includes demographic (e.g., gender, age, ethnicity, program year) and 
clinical information (e.g., the results of the PQ-B, PHQ-9 and CAGE) of all students who 
complete the PQ-B.  To de-identify these data, SHAC assigns unique identifiers to 
students.
The second excel file (referred to as the secondary phone screen database) is 
maintained by [CONTACT_322833]. This excel file 
includes information on students who are referred to coordinated specialty care 
(CONNECT/Early) and who contact[CONTACT_322834] 888-referral number. 237 people in total called 
the 888-referral number. Of those 237 students, only 57% (n = 136) signed a Release of 
Information (ROI) which allowed us to look up their demographic and clinical data in the 
database maintained by [CONTACT_322832]. Because we do not have an ROI for 43% (N = 101), we 
are missing PQ-B scores, and other valuable demographic and clinical information. As a 
result, we are unable to fully understand the PQ-B scores among those students who 
are referred to coordinated specialty care, who ends up completing a secondary screen 
and who eventually gets enrolled. With missing information on demographic and clinical 
information (including the PQ-B) score on almost half of those students who reached out 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Duration of Untreated Psychosis and Perceived Barriers to Mental 
Health Care Among College Students
HRRC#: 19-174 Page 10 of 19Version Date: 7/05/2022for a secondary screen we will not be able to determine whether the Prodromal 
Questionnaire-Brief (PQ-B) is an appropriate psychosis screening tool among a college 
population (a primary goal of this research). 
The third  excel file includes [ADDRESS_398666] broker process to merge 
all three databases  to\ allow us to fully understand what PQ-B scores indicate clinically 
within this population.  An honest broker is an IRB recommended practice for merging 
data. We have identified [CONTACT_322853] (statistician and Department of Psychiatry and 
Behavioral Sciences faculty member) to serve as the honest broker. 
Using the master key with client names and unique identifiers for records in the triage 
limited database, the honest broker will be responsible for merging the three excel files 
to create a complete dataset.  Once completed, the final merged limited dataset- 
containing both initial screening information from SHAC, secondary screening 
information from Psychiatry and research data- will be stripped of any identifying 
information and returned to the study team.
10.0Data and Specimen Banking
The Early Psychosis data repository will be used to store demographic and clinical 
information collected from consenting participants who agree to have their information 
stored in the data repository. This centralized database will store information for future 
unspecified use. In doing so, this will allow for a less burdensome and more efficient 
process for collecting information routinely utilized by [CONTACT_322835]. Consent for data 
to be included in the repository will be obtained during the consent process. Data will be 
stored for 20 years at which time the electronic repository and the database will be 
cleared. Re-consent will be attempted in person when those who already consented 
return for follow-up visits, if we can do so. For those that we can’t meet in person, we will 
re-consent by [CONTACT_648]. Those who cannot be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], either in person or by [CONTACT_322836] 10 years.
The data from the process evaluation will NOT be stored in the Early Psychosis 
Repository.
11.0Data and Specimen Management
11.1Describe the data analysis plan, including any statistical procedures.  The goals 
of this study are to (1) measure DUP and perceptions regarding barriers to care and 
shared-decision making, and (2) conduct a process evaluation of the implementation of 
the PQ-B (a screening tool to identify risk of psychosis) at SHAC. Descriptive statistics 
(e.g., means, standard deviations, medians, quartiles) and summary statistics (for the 
process evaluation) statistics (will be calculated to summarize the characteristics of the 
student population,  to summarize instrument scores, and to summarize process data 
regarding the PQ-B at an aggregate level . DUP among those with FEP and duration of

24.0Compensation for Research-Related Injury
Not applicable, this study involves minimal risk to participants.
25.0Economic Burden to Subjects
Not applicable, there will be no cost of study participation for participants. 
26.0Consent Process
Participant informed consent will be indicated by [CONTACT_322843] a parent or 
legal guardian on an HRRC-approved informed consent instrument. The consent 
process will occur in: (1) a private office at the Psychiatric Research Building, (2) a 
private office at CBH,  (3) a private location that is convenient for the participant which 
may include clinical offices, (4) by [CONTACT_648], or (5) via a HIPAA compliant zoom account. At 
all times, sites for data collection will ensure privacy and confidentiality. The consent 
process will take place after informing the prospective subject about the study. Through 
the consent process, participants will learn what will be required of them should they 
consent to participate in the study. The consent process will also ask participants for 
their permission to (1) obtain results of assessments that were conducted as part of 
standard clinical care, (2) keep and use their information collected in the proposed study 
in a repository for future research that involves early psychosis or shared with other 
researchers who are studying early psychosis without their additional informed consent 
(see attached Consent form Appendix for Data Repository), (3) be contact[CONTACT_322844]. They will 
also be asked if we can share their de-identified data with the National Institute of Health 
(NIH) Data Archive as required by [CONTACT_10729]. A protocol has been submitted to the IRB 
for the Early Psychosis Repository. When consent is conducted via phone or HIPAA 
compliant zoom account, we will need to delay obtaining a documented signature. In this 
case, we will log this into the non-reportable RNI log and file a “note-to-file” with the 
consent. We will attempt to get a documented signature [INVESTIGATOR_91394].
  
Once informed consent procedures are completed, study data will be collected. 
After a verbal description of the study is given by [CONTACT_322845] [INVESTIGATOR_322811], the following 
will occur to document informed consent in writing: 
• The participant or participant’s legal guardian will sign and date the consent 
document. 
• The individual obtaining consent will sign and date the consent document. 
• A copy of the signed and dated consent document will be provided to the participant. 
If a potential participant who is under the age of [ADDRESS_398673] given 
their assent for participation in the study. Parents or legal guardian will co-sign the 
document according to the procedures described in the preceding paragraph.

Health Care Among College Students
HRRC#: 19-174 Page 16 of 19Version Date: 7/05/2022Following approval of modification #3, we will re-consent those who already consented 
by [CONTACT_322846]. For those that we can’t meet in person, we will re-consent by 
[CONTACT_648]. Those who cannot be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], either in person or by [CONTACT_322847] 10 years.
Non-English Speaking Subjects
All participants must be able to speak and read fluent English in order to 
be able to review and understand the consent form. The consent form 
has not been translated to Spanish. We are excluding Spanish speaking 
subjects because not all of the standardized survey instruments are 
available in Spanish. Based on [CONTACT_322855]’s clinical experience with this 
population over the past three years, 0% of her clients have been only 
Spanish speaking. That is, they have all been English speaking. 
However, if we observe that Spanish speaking participants are being 
excluded once we start participant recruitment, we will: (1) collect Spanish 
versions of the instruments that are available, (2) translate instruments 
that are not available into Spanish, and (3) apply for a modification to our 
protocol to include Spanish speaking subjects. 
Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process (consent will not be obtained, 
required information will not be disclosed, or the research involves 
deception) 
   NA. There will be no waiver or alteration of the consent process. 
Subjects who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers)
Patients younger than 18-years-old will have the opportunity to participate in the 
research study. They will indicate their assent to participate in the study by 
[CONTACT_2960] a child assent form, which will be co-signed by a parent or other legal 
guardian.

[ADDRESS_158424] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_139509], safety, and potential efficacy of targeting MAP within 
the limits of cerebral autoregulation during hip, knee, or lung surgery compared with usual care.  
 2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
 Surgery for hip fracture in particular can be devastating for older adults, with complications that include delirium,
 1 inability to walk unaided, 2 and 1-year mortality  >20%.[ADDRESS_158425] a high incidence of delirium that ranges up to 20%. During many types of surgery, extreme variations in blood pressure are common in older adults due to age-associated vascular and autonomic dysfunction.
 [ADDRESS_158426] of care as to what constitutes adequate blood pressure in individual patients during surgery to avoid cerebral ischemia, with over 80 empi[INVESTIGATOR_139510].
 5   
Our group has champi[INVESTIGATOR_139511] a more precise method for defining optimal blood pressure in individual 
patients than the current practice of empi[INVESTIGATOR_139512]. Through the process of cerebral autoregulation, the 
brain is exquisitely regulated to maintain a constant cerebral blood flow across a wide range of mean arterial pressures (MAP).
 6 However, when MAP declines below the lower limit of autoregulation (LLA) or 
rises above the upper limit of autoregulation (ULA), compensatory mechanisms fail and cerebral hypo- or hyperperfusion can occur. We have developed validated methods to identify the LLA and ULA in real -
time in individual patients, and using these methods during cardiac surgery, we have found several key 
results.  First, the MAPs at the LLA and ULA varied tremendously among individuals, implying that “one 
size fits all” blood pressure targets are inadequate.
 [ADDRESS_158427] importantly, an intervention to maintain MAP during cardiac surgery within a patient’s limits of cerebral autoregulation reduced delirium compared with usual care (in pi[INVESTIGATOR_26923] a trial conducted by [CONTACT_139520]).   
However, the results of this trial in cardiac surgery may not apply in other surgeries due to differences in 
patients and surgical insult.  It is also unclear if MAP can be effectively targeted in the other surgery populations.  To address this gap in knowledge, we plan to determine the feasibility, safety, and potential efficacy of targeting MAP within the limits of cerebral autoregulation during a more generalizable group of surgeries, including hip or knee surgery (fracture or periprosthetic revision) or  lung surgery compared 
with usual standard of care.  
 [ADDRESS_158428] a randomized, double-masked controlled trial.  We will enroll 25 patients  with usable 
data. Randomization will be 2:[ADDRESS_158429] arm  with stratification by [CONTACT_139521]. lung 
surger y in permuted blocks of 3 or 6  (i.e. each surgical strata will have the opportunity for 17 intervention 
patients and 8 control patients to be enrolled).   Patients randomized to the intervention arm will have their MAP targeted within the limits of cerebral 
autoregulation during surgery. Patients randomized to the standard arm will receive observational monitoring.    
 3.2 Perioperative Care 
 
FEAT Study Protocol  
5 
Version 1.0 January 8, 2023 All anesthetic care will be according to usual practice, except the targeting of mean arterial pressure in 
the intervention group.   This trial will not specify general or regional anesthesia, and this decision will be 
left up to the clinical team. Generally, this is as follows: for general anesthesia, induction with propofol 
(1-2mg/kg) or etomidate (0.1-0.3 mg/kg); maintenance with volatile anesthetic titrated to 0.5-1.0 MAC; and pain control with fentanyl (2-5 mcg/kg) or dilaudid (10 -20 mcg/kg).  An epi[INVESTIGATOR_139513].  Depth of sedation may be titrated using a BIS monitor to 40-60. For patients who receive spi[INVESTIGATOR_18227], the protocol may be: spi[INVESTIGATOR_139514], propofol (1-2 
mcg/kg/min) for sedation, and fenta nyl (1 -3 mcg/kg) as needed for pain.  Sedation may be titrated to a 
level consistent with arousability to voice.  Surgical technique will be based on usual clinical practice for 
patients enrolled.   
 
3.[ADDRESS_158430], the near infrared spectroscopy 
(NIRS) monitor measures regional oxygen saturation in the brain using two adhesive pads placed on the patient’s forehead. The NIRS monitor will always be used.  These monitors are FDA-approved and are standard of care during cardiac surgery at Johns Hopkins.  Second, the Clearsight monitor is a non -
invasive measure of real -time arterial blood pressure using a finger cuff.  This device is FDA -approved 
and routinely used in operating rooms.  If the patient has an arterial line, the arterial waveform will be extracted directly from the anesthesia monitor. Third, the Bispectral Index (BIS) is a non-invasive FDA -
approved device also used in operating rooms to measure the depth of anesthesia using two adhesive pads that are placed on the patient’s forehead.   
The waveforms obtained from the NIRS, Clearsight or arterial line, and BIS monitors will be analyzed 
using dedicated software.  In this paragraph, we describe how the data inputs from these three monitors 
are processed to calculate key measures of the adequacy of cerebral autoregulation and organ perfusion. NIRS measures regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) and is weighted toward venous blood, thus indicating the adequacy of O2 supply versus demand. Our group has demonstrated that rScO2 provides 
a clinically acceptable surrogate of CBF for clinical autoregulation monitoring.11,15 Arterial pressure 
waveforms are obtained from the Clearsight monitor  or arterial line.  Both of these signals will be sampled 
with an analog-to-digital converter using ICM+ software (the University of Cambridge, Cambridge, [LOCATION_006]) at [ADDRESS_158431] theorem, allowing detection of oscillations and transients that occur below 0.05 Hz. A 
continuous, moving Pearson’s correlation coefficient will be performed between the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and rScO2, rendering the variable COx (cerebral oximetry index). Consecutive, paired, 10-second averaged values from 300-second duration will be used for each calculation, incorporating 30 data points for each index.  This methodology has been previously validated. The MAP at the lower and 
upper limits of autoregulation will be indicated by [CONTACT_139522]  
<0.3 to >0.3.    
 
4. SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS  
 
4.1 Patients 
  
 
Specific inclusion criteria are:  
• Planned hip or knee surgery (either for fracture or periprosthetic revision), or lung surgery  
• Age ≥60  
• Ambulatory at baseline.  
FEAT Study Protocol

Version 1.0 January 8, 2023 • Expected duration of surgery > 90 minutes  
 
Specific exclusion criteria  
• Planned concurrent surgery  
• Allergy to adhesive tape  
• Short Blessed Test score >20 
• Clinical diagnosis of dementia 
• Opi[INVESTIGATOR_139515].  
 Because of the age of these patients, it is anticipated that they will suffer from chronic diseases common in the elderly. However, each patient will be healthy enough to undergo the proposed operation, as judged by [CONTACT_139523].  
  
4.[ADDRESS_158432] 1) informed each patient accordingly and allowed 
sufficient time to decide whether or not to participate in the study; and 2) given the opportunity to inquire about details of the study and to answer any questions regarding the study.  Patients are free to withdraw consent for participation in the study at any time, without prejudice to further treatment. A patient’s 
participation in the study may be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the PI. 
 If the patient is not signing consent for surgery and has a medical decision maker doing so, then it will be determined that this patient lacks the capacity to give written consent for this project.  Of note, we are excluding patients with known dementia.  We will identify the legally authorized representative in 
accordance with the Maryland law applicable to surrogate decision-making for health care to sign written 
consent.  If the patient regains the capacity to consent, signs their own consents, and no longer requires 
a medical decision maker, then we will discuss this project with them and confirm their willingness to participate. We will attempt to discuss the study with patients who do not sign their own consents due to lack of capacity. However, we anticipate that the cognitive capacity of these patients will be low and they may not be able to understand. Thus, we will not obtain formal assent.

5.2.1  Screening Evaluation 
 
Screening Procedure 
The OR schedules of eligible surgeons will be reviewed daily for potential participants. If the 
patient is ≥  60 years of age and is undergoing traumatic hip fracture surgery  or revision hip or 
knee replacement surgery  or lung surgery , the patient is eligible for further screening and will be 
placed on the screening log. 
 Patients will then be assessed for meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria. Assessment will be done using the patient chart. If they meet all criteria, and staff are available to monitor the patient in the 
OR, they are then eligible for enrollment into the study and will be approached.

5.3 Randomization 
 
Randomization will be 2:[ADDRESS_158436] arm with stratification by [CONTACT_139521]. lung surgery  in permuted blocks of 3 or 6  (i.e. each surgical strata will have the opportunity for 17 intervention 
patients and 8 control patients  to be enrolled).  A patient will be considered to be randomized when they  
enter the operating room and the anesthesiologist is handed a sealed opaque envelope indicating the 
study allocation. 
 5.4 Description of Intervention and Control 
 
The critical difference will be blood pressure targets during surgery. Cerebral autoregulation monitoring will begin prior to anesthesia induction, with the LLA and/or ULA anticipated to be available within 30 minutes.  The methods are described in the subsequent section “Intraoperative Monitoring of Cerebral Autoregulation.”  These values will be used to establish blood pressure targets.  
 
In the intervention group, at [ADDRESS_158437]. Brown will visualize the autoregulation curves every 30-60 minutes to update 
the blood pressure target as necessary.  The lower limit of autoregulation will not be <55 mm Hg. or >90 mm Hg.  
 
In the intervention arm, the anesthesia provider will target MAP>LLA with the following strategy: reduce 
anesthetic agent while maintaining adequate anesthetic depth as clinically determined, IV fluid administration, and vasopressor infusion (likely dopamine or levophed, but at the discretion of the anesthesiologist).  MAP<ULA will be targeted with the following strategy: vasodilator infusion (likely nicardipi[INVESTIGATOR_139517], but at the discretion of the anesthesiologist) or other clinical approaches as 
decided by [CONTACT_101034].  If the treating anesthesiologist or surgeon feels that the blood pressure 
target is too high or too low for clinical reasons, then they will request a different target, and this request will take priority.  In the control arm, the anesthesia provider will use usual care guidelines, which is generally systolic blood pressure >90 mm Hg.   
FEAT Study Protocol

Version 1.0 January 8, 2023 Patients will be allowed to be enrolled in other studies.  Adherence will be assessed as part of the 
feasibility outcomes. 
 
 6   SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
 6.1 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
 Adverse events (AE) encountered during or after surgery are recorded on the appropriate AE section 
of the CRF.  Adverse events are defined as any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human study , including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the participants’ involvement in the research, whether or not considered related to the participant’s participation in the research.  
 
Serious adverse events (SAE) are a subset of AE that meet one of the following criteria:   
• Results in death 
• Is life threatening 
• Places the participant at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred 
• Requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139518]  
• Causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
• Is another condition which investigators judge to represent significant hazards  
Severity Classification  
Classifications of adverse events include the following:  
• Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and are of minor irritant type 
causing no loss of time from normal activities. Symptoms do not require therapy or a medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient.  
• Moderate: Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the participant and may 
interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by [CONTACT_14212]; moderate experiences may cause some interference with functioning  
• Severe:  Events interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and generally require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually incapacitating 
Expectedness of Adverse Events 
AEs will be assessed as to whether they were expected to occur or unexpected, meaning not 
anticipated based on current knowledge found in the protocol, investigator brochure, product insert, or label. Categories are:  
 
• Unexpected - nature or severity of the event is not consistent with information about the 
condition under study or intervention in the protocol, consent form, product brochure, or investigator brochure.  
 
• Expected - event is known to be associated with the intervention or condition under study.   
Relatedness of Adverse Events 
The potential event relationship to the study intervention and/or participation is assessed by [CONTACT_133052]. A comprehensive scale in common use to categorize an event is:  
• Definitely Related:  The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational agent/procedure – i.e. an event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study 
intervention, follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected intervention, that is 
FEAT Study Protocol  
[ADDRESS_158438]’s clinical state.  
• Possibly Related:   An adverse event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study intervention follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected intervention, but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors.  
• Not Related :  The adverse event is clearly not related to the investigational agent/procedure - 
i.e. another cause of the event is most plausible; and/or a clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the event and the study intervention and/or a causal relationship is considered biologically implausible.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_158439] to 
intensity, frequency, relationship to study, and outcome.  
The protocol for the FEAT trial for reporting AE is the following:  
• All AE are recorded on an AE form.   
a. The AE may be identified from a list of pre-defined complications or from informal review 
of the electronic medical record by [CONTACT_3647]. 
b. Serious AE will be further recorded on a separate form. 
c. A panel of three faculty at Johns Hopkins (including [CONTACT_46792]) will adjudicate expectedness and relatedness of each AE. 
• Serious AE (SAE)  
a. If unexpected, SAE will be reported to the NIA, IRB, and the independent safety officer 
within 48 hours.  
b. If expected, then SAE will be reported using the SAE form within 14 days  of discovery.  
c. An SAE will be considered expected if it is listed in the DSMP and/or the adjudication 
committee considers it expected (with consideration that events with <5% incidence 
should be considered unexpected). 
• Non-serious AE that are unexpected, possibly related, and may place participants at greater 
harm than originally recognized will be reported to the IRB, NIH, and the independent safety officer within 14 days.    
• All other adverse events will be maintained in the study database and reported to the IRB during continuing review and to the safety officer every 6 months.  
 7. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 7.1.  Outcomes:   
Primary outcome variables 
 Feasibility outcomes will be recruitment >60%, enrollment of at least 3 patients per month, available 
lower limit of autoregulation target in >65% of all patients, at least 1 delirium assessment in >95%, and 
at least 1 cognitive and functional assessment in >90% . 
 Safety outcomes will be increased operative bleeding and significant organ ischemia (myocardial infarction, as judged by [CONTACT_44375]).  
 Secondary clinical outcome variables  
 Extent of mean arterial pressure outside the limits of cerebral autoregulation (after the establishment of the MAP target) will be assessed based on intraoperative monitoring data. 
FEAT Study Protocol  
13 
Version 1.0 January 8, 2023  
Delirium will be assessed in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139519] 3D -CAM  (CAM-ICU for intubated patients).  
 Cognitive and functional outcomes will be assessed by [CONTACT_139525] 60 and 180, and in-person or by [CONTACT_1381] 1-year follow -up.   
a. Cognitive outcomes are: Short Blessed Test score, Oral Trail Making Test Score, AD8 score  
b. Functional outcomes are: inability to walk ≥10 feet without human assistance, WHO -
DAS 2.0 score, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, and institutionalization  
 
 7.2.  Analytic Plan:  
We will examine whether  targeting MAP  based on the limits  of cerebral  autoregulation during surgery is 
feasible and safe, and we will explore whether  it can reduce delirium, improve cognition, and improve 
function. The primary goal is to assess feasibility  and safety  of the intervention. We will monitor success  
in implementing each aspect of the protocol, and performance and safety  metrics  will be compared  
against pre- specified  criteria as defined in the primary outcome section.  
  
We will then assess  potential  efficacy  of the intervention to optimize blood pressure management, 
reduce delirium, improve  SBT score, and improve functional  status. The first analysis  will be by 
[CONTACT_7586]-to-treat by [CONTACT_139526] a target, frequency  of delirium, change in 
Short Blessed Test score, and change in WHO- DAS score.  We  will calculate the mean or frequency  of 
each outcome and between group differences, each with associated 95% confidence intervals. The 
former will provide estimates  of variability  in outcomes  needed in power  calculations  for a definitive trial, 
and the latter  will provide  a benchmark  by [CONTACT_139527] a further trial can be evaluated. We will then 
examine differences  in characteristics  between groups  and in multivariable regression  models  adjusted 
for surgery  type and age. Finally,  we will examine  secondary  outcomes, including change in OTMT,  
conversion  to dementia, and inability  to walk 10-feet. Together, these analyses  will inform  selection and 
measurement of primary and secondary  outcomes, as well as confounding variables, for a future trial 
powered for efficacy.  
  7.
3.  Sample Size:   
 
Based on the experience of the investigative team, a sample size of [ADDRESS_158440] adequate precision for estimating the primary  outcome 
of delirium.  We estimate that a sample size of n= 25 would provide the precision to estimate the 
incidence of delirium to within 16 percentage points using a 95% CI.   
  8. DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
 8.1 Data Collection Forms 
 
The study administrators will be responsible for obtaining and recording data.   
 8.2 Data Management  
 Patient information will be collected and recorded on a case report form (CRF) for this study by [CONTACT_42641]. Data will be transferred from the CRF to a study database, devoid of any patient identifying 
FEAT Study Protocol  
[ADDRESS_158441] protected. All patient information 
will be kept confidential. All patient binders will be housed in the study administrator’s office at Johns 
Hopkins behind two locked doors.  Additionally, the screening log will be password-protected and housed 
on a server that only study staff will have access to.  
 8.[ADDRESS_158442] (IRB) Review  
 
This protocol and the informed consent document and any subsequent modifications will be reviewed 
and approved by [CONTACT_109753].  The consent form should be separate from the protocol document. 
  
 
9.[ADDRESS_158443] the site will be 
identified only by a participant identification number (Participant ID, PID) to maintain confidentiality.  All 
records will be kept in a locked file cabinet.  All computer entry and networking programs will be done using PI[INVESTIGATOR_34107]. Information will not be released without written permission of the participant, except as 
necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_1744], the FDA, the NIA, and the OHRP.  
 9.4 Study Discontinuation  
 The study may be discontinued at any time by [CONTACT_1201], the NIA, the OHRP, the FDA, or other government 
agencies as part of their duties to ensure that research participants are protected.

READ  THE  FOLLOWING  CAREFULLY  
 
You are being  asked  to give permission  to participate  in a research  study.  Before  you give your 
consent  (permission)  to be part of this study,  please  read the following  and ask as many  
questions  as necessary  to be sure that you understand  what  participation  will involve.  
 
PURPOSE  OF STUDY:  
The purpose  of this study  is to understand  the potential  benefit  of a training  program  to help 
nurses  promote  caring  behavior  for oneself  and others,  improve  connection  with patients  and co- 
workers,  and give rise to altruistic  behavior  and generous  actions.  Stress  and compassion  fatigue  
is a prevalent  symptom  in oncology  nurses  and the present  research  study  is an on-site 
educational  program  designed  to support  oncology  nurses.  More  specifically,  this educational  
program  may help nurses  build  resilience,  reduce  burnout  and stress,  and compassion  fatigue.  
We are asking  you to take part in this research  study  because  you are a nurse  who works  in 
oncology  at the University  of Miami  Sylvester  Comprehensive  Cancer  Center.  
 
NUMBER  OF STUDY  PARTICIPANTS:  
We hope  to enroll  25 participants.  
 
PROCEDURES:  
If you choose  to participate,  the program  involves  several  steps.  The first step is to complete  a 
series  of questionnaires  administered  on-line. Completing  the questionnaires  will take 
approximately  20-30 minutes.  The on-line questionnaires  will include  items  about  your

background,  work  experiences  (including  medical  errors  and level  of stress),  and recent  thoughts  
and feelings.  Your  responses  will be kept confidential,  and only study  staff 
(i.e. the principal  investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_1238] a research  assistant)  will have  access  to the identifiable  
responses.  You may skip over any questions  that you choose  not to answer.  After  this assessment,  
if you decide  not to participate  in the study,  or if we believe  that the educational                  
program  is not right  for you, we will assist  you in finding  resources  that are more  suitable  to your 
needs.  
 
If we believe  the educational  program  is right  for you, and you decide  you would  like to 
participate,  a member  of our study  staff will work  with you and the  other  participants  to explain  
the time and location  that the educational  sessions  will take place.  You will then participate  in 
the educational  sessions  with the other  oncology  nurses  as participants.  
 
The Compassion  Cultivation  Training  (CCT)  is a secular  course  that was developed  by [CONTACT_268715]  & Altruism  Research  and Education  (CCARE)  at Stanford  University,  
School  of Medicine  (Jinpa,  2013).  The course  was developed  by [CONTACT_268716],  PhD,  in 
collaboration  with contemplative  scholars,  psychologists,  and scientist  at Stanford.  The goal of 
CCT  is to provide  a structured  and systematic  way of cultivating  daily -life skills  needed to 
strengthen  qualities  of compassion,  empathy,  and kindness  for oneself  and others.  
The training  is composed  of [ADDRESS_326983]. Amishi  Jha’s  private  
Youtube  account  and only participants  will be sent links  to those recordings.  These  links  are not 
searchable  online.

RISKS AND/OR  DISCOMFORTS:  
You may find some  of the questions  asked  in the assessments  emotionally  upsetting. You may 
decline  to answer  questions  which  upset  you and you are free to leave  the session  at any time.  
Also,  there  is a risk that the confidentiality  of what  you say during  the group  educational  sessions  
could  be broken.  However,  our research  study  staff members  are trained  to create  a supportive  and 
safe environment  for talking  about  sensitive  issues.  We follow  strict  procedures  for         
protecting  confidentiality.  We will ask all study  participants  to keep  private  the information  
discussed  in the group.

BENEFITS:  
There  may not be direct  benefit  to you in this study.  However,  it is hoped  that you will learn  new 
skills  that may reduce  work -related  stress  and compassion  fatigue.  
 
We hope  to learn  more  about  this intervention  in the hope  that the development  of an efficient,  
low-cost psychosocial  training  program  for oncology  nurses  has the potential  to reduce  both 
patient  and provider  frustrations,  to increase  provider  retention,  and to enhance  care provision.

9. INTRODUCTION  
9.1 Background and Current Treatment  
Fixation in soft tissues is traditionally achieved by [CONTACT_2329] a solid anchor which has been loaded with non-absorbable sutures, a technique which has proven adequate ly effective but 
which carries the risk of displacement or relocation of the anchor as well as bone loss and/or 
articular damage. Additionally, existing products require manual “tugging” of the anchor in order to achieve deployment, and, in the event that the anchor is not deployed correctly, the anchor may subsequently pull out.

 10. OBJECTIVES  
10.1 Primary  Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to assess survivorship (lack of reoperation/device 
removal) with the use of the BioWick SureLock  implant.  
 
10.2 Secondary  Objective s 
The secondary objectives of this study are:  
• To document the postmarket effectiveness of the BioWick SureLock i mplant using 
ASES scores, VR -12 scores, and VAS scores, with the corresponding assessments 
made at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months postoperative. 
• To document the postmarket effectiveness o f the BioWick SureLock implant using 
range of motion (ROM) measurements with the corresponding assessments made at 3 
months and 6 months postoperative.

11. STUDY DESIGN  
The study is a prospective, non-randomized, open-label, single- arm, postmarket, multicenter 
study. The schedule of study events list the procedures to be performed in each visit (see Table 7.1).  
11.1 Measures Taken to Avoid Bias 
11.1.1 Randomization 
All subjects enrolled in the study will be treated with the BioWick  SureLock i mplant. As 
there is no comparison arm, there will be no randomization.  
 
11.1.2 Blinding  
As this study is a single -arm study in which all subjects are treated with the BioWick  
SureLock  implant, neither subjects nor investigators will be blinded.      
 11.1.3 Description of  the Study Device  
The BioWick  SureLock  implant is a device constructed of ultra-high molecular weight 
polyethylene suture for use in shoulder and extremity surgery. The BioWick SureLock 
implant eliminates manual tensioning through a unique inserter- controlled deployment 
method that prevents partial deployment as well as displacement or partial deployment of the anchor by [CONTACT_445126]. The inserter is made of surgical grade stainless steel and plastic, and the wick component is made of 85/15 PLGA (L-
lactide-coglucolide ).

13. STUDY PRO CEDURES   
 13.[ADDRESS_566122] Sc reening/Enrollment Log.  
 Any potential subjects who are pre-screened can be added to the log by [CONTACT_445127]. Those who sign the ICF will be assigned a unique study ID. 
 
BioWick® SureLock® Implant     
                          Protocol No.  CAY -[ADDRESS_566123] Enrollment  
Subjects who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be considered eligible for 
enrollment.  S ubjects will be considered enrolled on Day 1 following final confirmation of 
the intra -operative inclusion/exclusion criteria. Hence, subjects who begin a surgical 
procedure may exit the study as a screen failure.   Once enrolled , a subject may only exit the 
study as a withdrawal (not a screen failure). The reason for withdrawal will be documented by [CONTACT_445128]/Enrollment Lo g.  
 
13.3 Screen Failures 
Subjects who sign an informed consent form and fail to meet the inclusion and/or exclusion 
criteria are defined as screen failures.  For all screen failures, the investigator will record  the 
reason for the screen failure on the Su bject Sc reening/Enrollment Lo g.  A copy of the log will  
be retained in the investigator's study files.    
13.4 Description of Study Procedures  
Subjects enrolled will follow the study procedures outlined in Section 13.   
 
13.4.1 Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the rotator cuff tear will be obtained during screening 
(baseline) . A screening MRI scan will not be required if a MRI scan was obtained within [ADDRESS_566124]’s medical history. All pre -operative 
screening or prior qualifying scans and post-operative study scans should be performed on a 1.5T magnet  or better. Additionally, a standardized imaging protocol will be utilized for all 
images collected as par t of the study procedures.  
 All radiographic images will be read and reviewed by [CONTACT_445129]. to confirm inclusion criteria . 
 
13.4.2 Veterans RAND 12 -Item Health Survey (VR -12) 
The VR-12 is  a 12- item self -administered health survey. The VR-12 consists of eight scales 
which evaluate physical health and mental health.  
 Physical Health Scales:  
• General Health  
• Physical F unctioning 
• Role -Physical  
• Bodily Pain 
 Mental Health Scales:  
• Role -Emotional

Confidential and Proprietary  
 19           Version 2.3 June 22, 2020  
 • Vitality  
• Mental Health  
• Social Functioning 
 
The responses to  the physical health scales will be evaluated to produce the Physical 
Component Score (PCS), and the responses to  the mental health scales will be evaluated to 
produce the Mental Component Score (MCS).  Both the PCS and MCS will be determined for all subjects at screening,  and at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months  postoperative. 
13.4.3 ASES Rating Scale  
The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) Functional Questionnaire is an eleven-item self -repor t questionnaire  consisting of ten questions which evaluate function and one 
question that evaluates pain. The function section of the survey yields a score between 0 and 30, with a score of zero indicating maximum disability. VAS Pain Score is included and is measured on a ten point scale, with a maximum pain score of ten. ASES Ratings will be

14. SAFETY  
14.1 Safety Variables 
Safety will primarily be assessed through frequency and incidence of adverse events.. 
 
15. EFFECTIVENESS  
15.1 Effectiveness Variables   
15.1.1 Primary  
The primary endpoint of this study is survivorship (lack of reoperation/device removal)  at 12 
months postoperative.    
 
15.1.2 Secondary  
The secondary endpoints of this study are: 
• Implant survivorship at visit intervals other than 12 months  
• VR-12 scores at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months postoperative 
• ASES rating scale at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months  postoperative 
• VAS pain scores at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months postoperative 
• Range of motion (ROM)  at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months postoperative 
 
The above endpoints based on continuous data will be reported as both raw and change from 
baseline (CFB) results.  
BioWick® SureLock® Implant     
                          Protocol No.  CAY -[ADDRESS_566130]-marketing, single treatment group, prospective study conducted at up to 
three study centers. The study will be conducted at as many as ten (10) center s in the U.S.  
Subjects will be enrolled in the trial for a period of [ADDRESS_566131] to the primary one-year survivorship endpoint of the study. 
Assuming an observed one -year survivorship of 85 %, a total of 59 subjects is required  in 
order to estimate the true  survivorship within a 95% confidence interval with a half-width 
precision of 10.7%. This assumes a two -sided α=0.05 level of significance and that the data 
come from a binomial distribution. In order to account for a 15% lost- to-follow-up rate, the 
sample size will be upwardly adjusted to 7 1 total subjects.  
 
16.3 Analysis Populations  
The following analysis populations will be defined for  the study:   
 
ITT Population – The ITT population will consist of all subjects who have signed 
informed consent, been enrolled in the study, and have had a successful placement of 
the BioWick  SureLock  implant .  
 Safety Population – The safety  population will consist of all subjects who have 
signed informed consent, been rolled in the study and have had a procedure during which placement of the BioWick  SureLock  implant was attempted, whether or not 
placement was successful.     
The primary analysis population for all primary and secondary endpoints will be the ITT population.  The primary analysis population for safety will be the safety population.  
16.[ADDRESS_566132] undergoes a 
revision or reoperation of the study device. Survivorship will be assessed using a Kaplan -
BioWick® SureLock® Implant     
                          Protocol No.  CAY -[ADDRESS_566133] available clinical visit will be used as 
the censored date.   For patients that die during the study, their death date will be used as the 
censored date.   The survivorship point estimate and 95% confidence interval about the point 
estimate will be calculated for the one-year primary endpoint.  
 
16.5.2 Secondary E ndpoint  Analyses 
Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, sample size, median, minimum, and 
maximum) will be computed for all quantitative secondary effectiveness endpoints on the raw 
and change from baseline data by [CONTACT_7206]. Frequency counts and percentages will be reported for all categorical secondary effectiveness endpoints.  
 
16.[ADDRESS_566134] caution.   
 The AEs reported will be evaluated as to incidence, relationship to the time the device was used, how long the device had been in use, severity, and relationship to the medical device.  
The section on AEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_445134]'s assessment of the event's causative relation to treatment. AE counts by [CONTACT_445135] (mild, moderate, and severe) will be tabulated.  
 
17.2 Definitions  
The term "adve rse event," as used by [CONTACT_1034], is synonymous with the term "adverse 
experience," which is used by [CONTACT_1622]. 
 An adverse event  for a device is defined as “untoward medical occurrence”.  An adverse 
event is an untoward occurrence that is temporally associated with, but not necessarily related to or caused by, the use of the device If the untoward medical occurrence does not involve a subject, only occurrences related to the investigational device are included in the definition and handled by [CONTACT_1034] ’s adverse event system.  
BioWick® SureLock® Implant     
                          Protocol No.  CAY -[ADDRESS_566135] medical occurrence that meets the 
following criteria:  
 1.   Results in death  (i.e., the AE actually causes or leads to death ) 
2. Is life -threatening (i.e., an AE that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], places the 
subject at immediate risk of death ) 
3. Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43928] (i.e., the AE 
requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_260003] 24 hours or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_445114]; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_445115])  
4. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity (i.e., t he AE causes 
substantial disruption in the ability of the subject  to carry out normal activities)  
5. Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect in the infant/ newborn of a mother that has 
been exposed to the research compound  
6. Is considered by [CONTACT_445136] (e.g., puts the subject  at risk or may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the aforementioned results) 
  The seriousness must be evaluated independently from  the severity when documenting the 
AEs on the CRF . 
 Additionally, important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.    A life threatening adverse event  is any AE that places the subject at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred .  A life -threatening e vent does not include an event that might 
have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form but that did not create an immediate risk of death as it actually occurred.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329320].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329321] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a criterion for considering an AE to be serious.  In the absence of an AE, the participating investigator should not report hospi[INVESTIGATOR_445116] a form.   In addition, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112044] a preexisting condition that has not worsened does not constitute an SAE (e.g. elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_445117]).  
 Disability  is defined as a su bstantial disruption in subject ’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions.

 17.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
This section will address the reporting of the serious adverse ev ent to the Sponsor and/or their 
representatives. 
 
In the event that any SAEs occur during this study, the Investigator will notify the Sponsor or 
the Sponsor ’s safety representative via fax or phone immediately after becoming aware of the 
incident.  
 The Investigator will fax the SAE Report Form, and other doc umentation regarding the SAE 
to the Sponsor or the Sponsor ’s safety representative. The Investigator will promptly provide 
follow-up information requested by [CONTACT_57756] ’s safety representative.  
 
17.[ADDRESS_566136] evaluation during the study. AEs 
will be recorded stating  the duration (i.e., onset and resolved dates) of the event , the intensity , 
the relationship to the device , the relationship to the surgical procedure , action taken, the 
outcome, the seriousness, regulatory criterion, if any, and the presumed association with the study. 
 
Note: The AE must be recorded on the AE page of the CRF .  Each AE should be marked 
appropriately on the AE page as to whether it is serious. An SAE must be reported to the 
Sponsor or the designated safety personnel as soon as possible after the Investigator has 
become aware of its occurrence.  
 
The causal relation between an AE and the study device will be determined by [CONTACT_445137]:  
• Definitely related: Event can be fully explained by [CONTACT_445138]. 
• Possibly related : Event may be explained by [CONTACT_445139]’s clinical state or other agents/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
• Not related : Event can be fully explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other 
agents/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
When assessing the relationship between the study device and an AE, the following should be 
considered:  
1. Temporal relationship between the administration of the study device and the AE; 
2. Biological plausibility of relationship ; 
3. Subject’s underlying clinical state ;

 4. When applicable, whether the AE abates on discontinuation of the use of the study 
device.  
 SAEs that are not stud y related may nevertheless be considered by [CONTACT_445140] (or designee) to be related to the conduct of the clinical study, i.e., to a subject's participation in the study. For example, a protocol- related SAE may 
be an event that is related to another non -test procedure required by [CONTACT_760]. 
 The following definitions should be used when determining the severity of an AE.    
• Mild : The AE is noticeable to the subject but does not interfere with activity .   
• Moderate:  The AE interferes with routine activity but responds to symptomatic therapy 
or rest.  
• Severe:  The AE significantly limits the subject’s ability to perform activities despi[INVESTIGATOR_296857] . 
 18. STUDY SUSPENSION, TERMINATION, AND COMPLETION

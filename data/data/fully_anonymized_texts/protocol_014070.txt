Protocol Version: 10/13/22   1 Protocol Summary and  Schema  
Quantitatively, up to 95% of patients receiving radiation therapy (RT) experience radiation 
dermatitis (RD) with 20 -25% of patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_648348], ulceration, necrosis, and scarring (R. J. Chan, 2014). There is no gold standard 
treatment for RD. In this study, we seek to conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_648349] a reformulated proton pump inhibitor (PPI) cream (Dermaprazole) in head and neck 
cancer (HNC) patients.  
This conviction stems from our extensive preclinical study that demonstrated pleiotropic 
beneficial effects of PPIs in regulating tissue inflammation and fibrosis induced by [CONTACT_648370]. Our most recent data in a mouse model of RD shows that PPIs have 
remarkable effect in protecting the skin from the harmful effects of ionizing radiation. Primarily, 
we aim to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Dermaprazole cream in HNC patients at risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_648350]. This study will consist of 2 arms: arm [ADDRESS_868622] patient - reported 
quality of life questionnaire (skindex16) throughout the treatment period and during the follow 
up period. Furthermore, inflammatory markers including CRP, TNFa, IL -1b, and IL -[ADDRESS_868623]

Protocol Version: 10/13/22   2 OBJECTIVES  
 
2.1 Safety/Efficacy  
 
2.1.1 Primary Objective  
 
A. Determin e if objectively lower rates of significant radiation dermatitis occur with 
Dermaprazole for HNC patients receiving radiation when compared to patients 
receiving Aquaphor. An objective measure will be tabulated: the rate of clinically 
significant (CTCAE version 5 grade 2 or higher) radiation dermatitis. This measure will 
be reported weekly during treatment by [CONTACT_648371] a board -certified dermatologist via medical photography.  
2.1.2 Secondary Objectives 
[IP_ADDRESS]  
To assess the highest grade of CTCAE version 5 radiation dermatitis during 
radiation treatment  
[IP_ADDRESS]  
To assess the time to occurrence of CTCAE version 5 grade 2 or higher acute 
radiation dermatitis.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  
To assess the time to healing if CTCAE version 5 grade 2 or higher acute radiation 
dermatitis develops.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  
To evaluate quality of life via acute and long -term symptoms and symptom 
scores utilizing the SkinDex16 scoring system.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  
To evaluate the threshold dose at which RD appears in either arm, utilizing skin 
dose tracking structures (V20 to V80 in 5 Gy increments reaching skin shell 
contours of “skin minus 3 millimeters” and “skin minus 5 millimeters”)  
[IP_ADDRESS]  
To evaluate the threshold dose at which RD appears in either arm, using the 
same metrics as in [IP_ADDRESS], but with a new simulation scan in the last week of 
radiotherapy  
[IP_ADDRESS]  
To evaluate the effect of dermaprazole on inflammatory markers: CRP, TNFa, IL - 
1b, IL -6, by [CONTACT_648372], during, and after treatment. We expect this 
to give further evidence for the mechanism of action of dermaprazole.

Protocol Version: 10/13/[ADDRESS_868624] from upfront 
therapy in order to prevent later cancer -related morbidity and mortality, they are also 
more likely to suffer from acute treatment -related morbidity, including radiation 
dermatitis.  
 
Given the unmet medical need for therapi[INVESTIGATOR_648351], our basic 
science team has been investigating candidate drugs to mitigate the problem. After 
screening a library of 130,000 compounds, we found that proton pump inhibitor (PPIs) 
have previously unrecognized yet potent effect in modulating inflammation and fibrosis 
induced by [CONTACT_648373]. Radiation -induced dermatitis occurs in 
most patients following radiotherapy. According to the NCI -CTCAE (Services, 2017) and 
RTOG (J. D. Cox, 1995) scoring systems, mild dermatitis (Grade I) is characterized by [CONTACT_648374] (erythema), epi[INVESTIGATOR_81184] (hyperkeratosis) or dry desquamation and 
appears shortly after initiation of T. Moderate dermatitis (Grade II) occurs within two 
weeks of radiotherapy and manifests painful and intense erythema, loss of hair from the 
root (epi[INVESTIGATOR_344]), blisters and edema. Of note, the presence of grade II toxicity is generally 
regarded as clinically significant toxicity. In severe dermatitis (Grade III and IV), moist 
desquamation occurs excessively and may lead to persistent inflammation, full -thickness 
skin necrosis and severely painful ulceration that is prone to infection. The acute effects 
occur almost immediately at radiation doses between 2 and 40 Gray (2 -40 Gy) whereas 
chronic effects occur several months -to-years after exposure to high radiation doses (> 
45 Gy) and typi[INVESTIGATOR_648352], scarring and spi[INVESTIGATOR_400598] (telangiectasia) 
(S. R. Hymes, 2006).  
 
The effect of radiation on the skin is in part due to its effect in promoting the production 
of highly reactive free radicals that are involved in DNA damage. In addition, radiation 
upregulates inflammatory cytokines (M. A. Brach, 1993) (e.g., TNF α, IL1β, IL6, VCAM1 and 
ICAM1) that can exacerbate sustained injury and compromise skin integrity. Almost all 
head and neck cancer patients are profoundly affected by [CONTACT_648375] (Grade II or 
higher) due to the development of serious skin reactions described above. The predictive 
risk factors for prolonged effect of severe dermatitis include age, sex, body mass index 
(BMI), site and volume of the body exposed to radiation, use of concurrent 
radiosensitizing drugs or chemotherapy regimen and presence of diabetes, autoimmune 
disorders, or genetic mutations (F. Meyer). Severe dermatitis can result in 
discontinuation of the radiotherapy before completion of the prescribed dose and 
threatens the relapse of underlying cancer (S. A. McCloskey, 2009), (Asa Bostrom,  2001).  
  
Page 6  of 23  
Protocol Version: 10/13/[ADDRESS_868625] been evaluated for 
the prevention, treatment or management of severe radiation dermatitis (P. Okunieff). 
However, the use of many of these agents is not recommended either due to lack of 
efficacy or insufficient clinical data. Meanwhile, various pharmacological agents have 
been developed to mitigate radiation dermatitis. Of these, topi[INVESTIGATOR_648353]. Among the steroid -based products, mometasone furoate (0.1%), 
betamethasone (0.1%) and hydrocortisone (1%) are extensively studied in clinical trials 
(Andrew Hindley, 2014).  
While steroid use has been shown in clinical trials to decrease radiation dermatitis, some 
drawbacks have limited their widespread use including concern regarding: risk of 
cutaneous atrophy, stretch marks (striae), and secondary skin infection (e.g., cellulitis, 
candidiasis).  
Proton pump inhibitors now have well described anti -inflammatory effects (R. R. Kedika, 
2009). Our earlier research discovered that PPIs directly regulate the nitric oxide synthase 
(NOS) pathway via inhibition of the inducible isoform (iNOS) which is significantly 
expressed in skin cells in response to inflammatory stimuli as in radiation or 
chemotherapy. The nitric oxide (NO) catalyzed by [CONTACT_648376] -lived and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_648354] (OONO -); a highly reactive molecule that is involved in the generation of 
nitrotyrosine; a more stable product that is involved in tissue inflammation. Additionally, 
a number of inflammatory cytokines released during chemoRT are known to enhance NO 
production. We found that regulation of the iNOS pathway by [CONTACT_648377] (DDAH), an enzyme that 
breaks down asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA, the endogenous and competitive NOS 
inhibitor). Subsequently, we showed that esomeprazole is the most potent PPI [INVESTIGATOR_648355] -inflammatory enzyme DDAH and many classic pro -inflammatory 
cytokines (such as NFKB, TNF α, IL1β, IL6, VCAM1, and ICAM1) that are reported to be 
pathologically upregulated in radiation  dermatitis.

Protocol Version: 10/13/22   
 
 
 
 We recently 
reformulated 
esomeprazole powder 
into a Lipoderm® -based 
cream (Dermaprazole) 
that retained the 
inherent biologic 
antioxidant, anti - 
inflammatory, and anti - 
fibrotic effects of 
esomeprazole. This was 
executed by [CONTACT_648378] 
>98.5% purity esomeprazole 
powder and placing in  a 
mortar, wetting with propylene glycol, and mixing with a transdermal base (i.e., 
Lipoderm). Notably, our LC -MS study showed that a relatively low strength of 
Dermaprazole (1 -2%) was highly stable and biologically active in modulating 
esomeprazole target  
genes.  
 
 
Accordingly, we evaluated 
the efficacy of this 
formulation in a mouse 
model of RD in a 
prophylactic and 
therapeutic settings in the 
presence of corticosteroid 
control. Remarkably, our 
study showed that while 
90% of the animals in the  
corticosteroid group had grade II or higher dermatitis, topi[INVESTIGATOR_648356] 20% showing grade II or higher radiation 
dermatitis (Figure 1). We also observed that Dermaprazole use led to significantly lower 
ulceration, necrosis, inflammation, and fibrosis (Figure 2 and Figure 3). Overall, most 
Dermaprazole treated animals showed complete or nearly complete closure of the 
wounds within 4 weeks  
following exposure to 
ionizing radiation (Pham, 
et al., 2019).

enrolled into the study and consented will be allocated to arm 1 or arm 2 according to 
the sequence of the randomization table.  
 
5.3 Radiotherapy  Administration  
Dose, Prescription, and Planning: Head and neck radiation of over 60Gy will be permitted 
with or without boost up to 70Gy (but not higher). Radiation is to be delivered 5 days per 
week (with exception of weeks with holidays), using intensity -modulated technique.  
Simulation and Treatment : CT-based simulation with thermoplastic mask and volumetric 
planning must precede treatment. Tissue -equivalent bolus is permitted on protocol. Daily 
cone beam CT images are required to confirm accurate delivery.  
Resimulation: Will be done in the last week of radiotherapy to allow for recalculation of 
beams.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_868626] practice. Variations (dose 
adjustments, delays, etc) that follow standard clinical practice are allowed and are not 
considered deviations, though these will be recorded to assess for interference.  
Patients will be managed with twice daily prophylactic use of the proposed intervention 
(Dermaprazole) topi[INVESTIGATOR_648357]. The amount of 
cream or Aquaphor will be 2cc per application and will be measured in pre -filled capped 
syringes for every application.  
The Dermaprazole topi[INVESTIGATOR_648358]. 
After the product is compounded it will be overnight shipped to the Mays Cancer Center 
Pharmacy in insulated shippi[INVESTIGATOR_648359]. The cream will be  
Page 10  of 23  
Protocol Version: 10/13/22   stable for a minimum of 60 days in airtight containers under refrigerated conditions (2o – 
8o C) and is stable at controlled room temperature for at least 1 week. Room 
temperature is 20°C – 25°C (excursions permitted between 15°C and 30°C). A one to 
three week supply of the cream will be dispensed to the subject during study 
participation, with the exception that a [ADDRESS_868627] Simulation (determined by [CONTACT_648380]). The same method will 
be used for the dispensing of the Aquaphor except that refrigeration will not be done in 
the pharmacy.  
Patients will be instructed to apply the cream/Aquaphor along the area exposed to 
radiation from the day of simulation to two weeks after completion, correlating with the 
acute phase of radiation dermatitis. If the time from CT Simulation to start of radiation is 
greater than 2 weeks then the patient may be instructed to start the cream/Aquaphor [ADDRESS_868628] of care treatment if  indicated.  
Subjects will be instructed to not use other lotions, creams or any other products in the 
radiation treatment area without the study doctor’s approval.  
Neither the Dermaprazole cream or the Aquaphor is expected to be irritating or 
sensitizing but, subjects will be instructed to inform study personnel if a skin irritation 
occurs. If eye contact [CONTACT_648381].

8 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
 
8.1. Study  Design/Endpoints  
This portion of the study is designed to evaluate toxicity profile and preliminary efficacy of 
prophylactic Dermaprazole cream for radiation dermatitis in head and neck cancer patients 
receiving chemoradiation.  
The first primary outcome is rates of clinically significant radiation dermatitis as defined as 
NCI CTCAE version 5 grade 2 or higher. Although not expected, if half our expected 
enrollment in the Dermaprazole group, 50% or more of patients experience moderate 
intervention -related toxicity, this treatment regimen will not be considered safe. The trial will 
be monitored for SAEs and stopped early for safety if two treatment -related grade 3 SAEs are 
reported or if one treatment -related grade 4 -5 SAE is reported at any point of the trial for the 
Dermaprazole group.  
Another primary endpoint will be feasibility, which is defined as the consideration of whether 
the protocol implementation will be successful in terms of accrual within the expected 
timeframe, as well as whether patients would comply with the study protocol and necessary 
data collection is logistically feasible in the clinical setting. To evaluate feasibility, we will 
measure:  
Page 15  of 23  
Protocol Version: 10/13/22    
• Accrual rate and summary of causes for  non-enrollment  
• Percentage of patients compliant with therapy, defined as receiving at least 60Gy to the 
head and neck while using prophylactic Dermaprazole as  directed  
• Compliance rate and rate of completion of SkinDex16  forms  
All endpoints will be evaluated when the last patient completes their [ADDRESS_868636] be true:  
• No more than 5 patients fail to complete the treatment regimen due to study drug 
toxicity  
• No more than [ADDRESS_868637]  80%  
• Enrollment takes no longer than 24 months,  and 
• Proportions of analyzable questionnaires at baseline, while on -treatment, and  off- 
treatment during follow -up, and within questionnaires completion rates are no 
worse than 80%, 80%, and 60%  respectively.  
 
8.2 Sample Size/Accrual  Rate  
Participants will continue to be enrolled and monitored for toxicity per the above criteria 
until [ADDRESS_868638] completed the course of head and 
neck radiation as evaluable patients. Patients will be randomized by [CONTACT_34330] a 2:1 
fashion. Per our current database, the clinic is treating approximately 60 eligible patients per 
year. As such, accrual should take no longer than 12 months but will be allowed to extend to 
up to 24 months without closing the  study.  
Initial sample size for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_648361] a phase 
II study. Sample size calculation was determined using significance/alpha ( α) of 0.05, to at 
least detect a difference in incidence of 45% and power ( β) of 80%. In general, rates of 
clinically bothersome grade II dermatitis in the literature appear to be approximately 65%.  
Based on our preclinical study with animal and human skin models, we expect 20% of the 
Dermaprazole arm to have CTCAE grade II or higher RD. Given these values, we calculated our 
final sample size to be approximately 39 and we aim to enroll 45 subjects.  
8.3 Analysis of Primary and Secondary  Endpoints  
Descriptive and summary statistics will be computed for demographic and clinical data of all 
subjects enrolled in the study to describe the study sample.  
Toxicity will be reported as the frequency of each adverse event according to the CTCAE 
version 5.0 as well as the grade of each recorded adverse event (38). Generally, adverse 
events in this system are graded from 1 to 5, with 1 corresponding to either mild or 
asymptomatic clinical manifestations of toxicity and 5 corresponding to death related to the  
Page 16  of 23  
Protocol Version: 10/13/22   adverse event (see Appendix 2). Clinically relevant toxicity will be defined as grade 2 or 
higher, while severe toxicity will be defined as grade 3 or higher. Acute toxicity will be defined 
as adverse events that occur during or within 90 days after completing radiation therapy. We 
will consider this intervention safe if there is a grade 1 toxicity rate of <50%, a grade 2 or 
higher toxicity rate of <10% and no grade [ADDRESS_868639] for specific radiation skin dose stratification by 
[CONTACT_251285] V20 to V80 in 5 Gy increments reaching a skin shell representing the thickness 
between the skin and the “skin minus 3 millimeters” and the “skin minus 5 millimeters.” This 
will be done on both the original dosimetry as well as a recalculated plan from the 
resimulation scan.  
We will also evaluate any statistically significant differences in both the absolute numbers 
and relative changes of the lab values: CRP, TNFa, IL -1b, IL -[ADDRESS_868640] (EMR) system.  
Page 17  of 23  
Protocol Version: 10/13/22   Patient characteristics including age, race/ethnicity, initial biopsy result, cancer stage, BMI and 
known comorbidities will be collected.  
Patient data for analysis will be captured using REDCap. Paper forms including the skindex16 
questionnaires will be kept in a locked cabinet in the Radiation Oncology offices and input into 
REDCap. Photos of patients’ skin reaction will also be kept on this limited -access network drive. 
Patient information will be de -identified for final statistical analysis by [CONTACT_648384]. Each patient will be assigned a study code at time of study registration.  
Information gathered from the planning system will include the V20 to V80 in 5 Gy increments 
reaching skin shell contours of “skin minus 3 millimeters” and “skin minus 5 millimeters” as well 
as the total dose. This will be collected for both simulation scans.  
 
 
10 DATA AND SAFETY  MONITORING  
 
10.1 Data and Safety Monitoring Oversight:  
A Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) is required for all protocols conducted at MAYS 
CANCER CENTER. All protocols conducted at MAYS CANCER CENTER are covered under the 
auspi[INVESTIGATOR_648362]. The MAYS 
CANCER CENTER Institutional DSMP global policies provide individual trials with:  
• institutional policies and procedures for institutional data safety and  monitoring,  
• an institutional guide to  follow,  
• monitoring of protocol accrual by [CONTACT_648385],  
• review of study forms and orders by [CONTACT_648386],  
• tools for monitoring safety  events,  
• monitoring of UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961]’s by [CONTACT_648387],  
• determining level of risk (Priority of Audit Level Score – PALS),  
• oversight by [CONTACT_71333] (DSMC),  and 
• verification of protocol adherence via annual audit for all Investigator Initiated Studies 
by [CONTACT_648388].  
 
10.2 Monitoring  Safety:  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_648363], adverse event 
trends and treatment effects on this study. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_648364] (DSMB) and the 
UT HEALTH IRB. Baseline events and adverse events will be captured using the MAYS CANCER 
CENTER Master Adverse Events Document for each patient using CTCAE v5.0 for the grading and 
attribution of adverse events. Usage of the MAYS CANCER CENTER Master Adverse Events 
Document centrally documents:  
• the event and grades the seriousness of  it, 
• if the event was a change from  baseline,  
Page 18  of 23  
Protocol Version: 10/13/22   • determines the relationship between the event and study  intervention,  
• if the event was part of the normal disease process,  and 
• what actions were taken as a result of the  event.

10.3 Safety Definitions: For this study, the following safety definitions will be applicable:  
Adverse Event  Definition : 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a 
human subject, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s 
participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s 
participation in the research.  
The adverse event (AE) collection/reporting period will begin with the first day of 
treatment with radiation or chemotherapy. AEs after study registration but prior to the 
first day of study treatment will be captured as ongoing concurrent secondary diagnoses 
and symptoms present at the start of study.  
Serious Adverse Event Definition : is any adverse event that:  
 
1. results in  death;  
2. is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as  it 
occurred);  
3. results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10909];  
4. results in a persistent or significant  disability/incapacity;  
5. results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  or 
6. based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’ s health and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed 
in this  definition.  
Page 19  of 23  
Protocol Version: 10/13/22   Unanticipated Problems  Involving Risks to Subjects or Others Definition:  
Unanticipated problem involving risk to subjects or others includes any incident, 
experience or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 
A. unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency)  given  
(a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related 
documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and informed consent 
document;  and 
(b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied (note: the 
unfounded classification of a serious adverse event as “anticipated” constitutes 
serious non -compliance);  
B. definitely related or probably related to participation in the research;  and 
C. suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm  (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.  
 
Expected adverse events  are those that have been previously identified as resulting from 
administration of topi[INVESTIGATOR_648366].  
For purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered expected when the events 
are those related to systems within the radiation treatment field and include: 
infection, allergy, or short & long -term (greater than 6 month) skin changes.  
  
Radiation: The common side effects of radiation to the head and neck most commonly 
includes radiation dermatitis (i.e., erythema, blistering, pi[INVESTIGATOR_16576]) and 
fibrosis/firmness of head and neck in the long -term. Commonly, patients develop dry 
mouth, changes in taste, pain when swallowing, and weight loss. Long term, some 
patients can continue to have changes in taste and lymphedema.  
 
Dermaprazole: The interventional cream is not yet tested in humans and reactions in vivo 
(especially in patients experiencing radiation dermatitis) are not yet known. Possible side 
effects include allergy or infection. Given the success in pre -clinical studies, it is unlikely 
that the interventional cream would lead to worsened rates of radiation dermatitis and 
skin integrity, though this is a possibility.  
 
Acute and late  designations will be defined by [CONTACT_648389].  
• Acute  toxicity will be defined as events occurring during or within 90 days of treatment 
completion.  
• Late  toxicity will be defined as events occurring or persisting ≥90 days from treatment 
completion.  
 
Attribution : An attribution scale which will be utilized to attribute relatedness of the adverse 
event to the radiation treatment or to the Dermaprazole/Aquaphor as determined by [CONTACT_648390]. Assignment of attribution is the responsibility of the treating 
investigator or Principal Investigator.  
Page 20  of 23  
Protocol Version: 10/13/22   • Definite – The AE is clearly related to the study  treatment.  
• Probable – The AE is likely related to the study  treatment.  
• Possible – The AE may be related to the study  treatment.  
• Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study  treatment.  
• Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study  treatment.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_868641] on treatment  
• Expected mild/moderate toxicity (Grade 1 -2) will be managed conservatively by [CONTACT_262744].  
 
• Unexpected or severe adverse events will be managed on a case by [CONTACT_648391]. Emergent 
dermatology consult and face -to-face evaluation within [ADDRESS_868642] 
of care. If the risks of continuation of any portion of the patients’ treatment is felt to 
immediately outweigh the benefits or be detrimental to the patient, it may be 
temporarily withheld at the discretion of the treatment  team.  
 
• Adverse events directly related to Dermaprazole may prompt withdrawal from the 
study. Radiation will continue as scheduled unless Grade 4 toxicity occurs, in which 
case delay to allow for healing is  permitted.  
 
10.5 Reporting  Requirements  
The adverse event (AE) collection/reporting period for events related to Aquaphor or 
Dermaprazole will begin with the first day of application of the product. The adverse 
event (AE) collection/reporting period for all other events will begin with the first day of 
treatment with radiation or chemotherapy. AEs not related to Aquaphor or Dermaprazole 
that occur after study registration but prior to the first day of study treatment will be 
captured as ongoing concurrent secondary diagnoses and baseline symptoms present at 
the start of study.  
The following adverse events, regardless of perceived relationship to study treatment, 
will be reported and recorded:  
• Scarring, fibrosis, epi[INVESTIGATOR_344], or pi[INVESTIGATOR_648367] 6 
months  
• Anaphylaxis, hypotension, urticarial, or other reactions felt to be  allergic  
• All SAEs  
• Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) that are ongoing at the 
end of the treatment and related to radiation treatment or investigational 
product application (but not chemotherapy) or lab abnormalities specified on the 
Study Calendar will be followed until resolution or the end of study  follow -up. 
Page 21  of 23  
Protocol Version: 10/13/22   For this study, all Master Adverse Events Documents collected on patients for this 
protocol will be reviewed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a quarterly basis to determine if 
a serious safety problem has emerged that results in a change or early termination of a 
protocol such as:  
• suspending enrollment due to safety or efficacy,  or 
• termination of the study due to a significant change in risks or  benefits.  
 
As per the MAYS CANCER CENTER DSMP, any protocol modifications, problematic safety 
reports, unanticipated problems, and suspension or early termination of a trial must be 
reported to all members of the research team. Suspension and early termination of a trial 
must also be reported immediately to the Director of Quality Assurance (DQA) who will 
promptly notify the sponsor and the UT HEALTH IRB. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_648368]. The Investigator Initiated Study Annual DSMB Report 
Form includes information on adverse events, current dose levels, number of patients 
enrolled, significant toxicities per the protocol, patient status (morbidity and mortality), 
dose adjustments with observed response, and any interim findings. Any trend consisting 
of three or more of the same event will be reported to the MAYS CANCER CENTER DSMP 
for independent review outside of the annual reporting cycle, which begins three months 
following protocol start up. Conflict of interest is avoided by [CONTACT_648392]. All SAE and UPRISO’s will be reported 
following MAYS CANCER CENTER and UT HEALTH institutional  guidelines.  
 
 
AE’s and SAE events that occur during clinical trials with or without an Investigational 
New Drug (IND) application are mandatory reports submitted to FDA via Medwatch FDA 
F3500A within [ADDRESS_868643] a possible relationship with the drug.  
10.6 Quality  Assurance  
As with all studies conducted at MAYS CANCER CENTER, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_648369], data accuracy/integrity and responding to 
recommendations that emanate from monitoring activities. Protocol compliance, data  
 
 
Page 22  of 23  
Protocol Version: 10/13/[ADDRESS_868644], will maintain stability & bio availability data. Presently, the product is believed to 
be stable for at least [ADDRESS_868645] dose of investigational 
therapy will be immediately withdrawn from all participation in the study. All study 
conclusion/withdrawal assessments will be collected at the time of discontinuation. Pregnancy 
information is to be recorded in the Case Report Forms. While pregnancy itself is not considered 
to be an SAE, it may result in an SAE. Any pregnancy complication or elective termination of a 
pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an SAE and will be reported as such. A 
spontaneous abortion is always considered an SAE and will be reported as  such.  
 
[ADDRESS_868646] patient confidentiality. The study is completely 
voluntary and patients will be able to withdraw at any time.

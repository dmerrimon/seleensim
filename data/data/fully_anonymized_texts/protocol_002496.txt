dosing in septic shock  
 
 
1. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY AND BACKGROUND  
 
1.1. Hypothesis  
 
• Chronic β-blocker or Angiotensin -Converting Enzyme ( ACE )-inhibitor use is associated with 
decreased cumulative doses of vasopressors administered in the first 48 hours of septic shock  
 
1.2. Purpose of the study  
 
• The primary objective is to determine the  effect of chronic β-blocker or ACE -inhibitor  on 
cumulative vasopressor dosing in the first 48 hours of sept ic shock .    
 
• The secondary objectives of this study  
o To determine the effect of chronic β-blocker or ACE -inhibitor  on cumulative  vasopressor 
dosing in the first 6, 12, and 24 hours of septic shock.    
o To determine the  effects of chronic  β-blocker or ACE -inhibitor   on:  
▪ Adequate fluid resuscitation  
▪ Cumulative i notrope use  (48 hours)  
▪ Cumulative hydrocortisone use at 6, 12, 24 , and 48 hours  
o To determine cumulative vasopressor d ose of patients on chronic  calcium channel 
blocker or other antihypertensive s (clonidine, hydralazine, angiotensin -receptor -blocker 
(ARB))  
 
1.3. Background  
 
Literature suggests that extended periods of tachycardia, in patients with shock, are associated 
with increased mortality.1-[ADDRESS_33870] 48 hours of septic shock.    
 
2. STUDY DESIGN  
 
2.1. Overview  
 
This will be a retrospective four -cohort study.  The four cohorts will be septic shock patients 
that were: 1) not on either a  chronic  β-blocker  or ACE -Inhibitor,  2) on chronic β-blocker , 3) on 
chronic ACE -Inhibitor, and 4) on both chronic β-blocker  and ACE -inhibitor  
 
2.2. Rationale for Study Design  
 
This s tudy design was chosen since the  primary object ive is to compare  cumulative vasopressor

Version date: 9/3 /[ADDRESS_33871] Characteristics  
 
Number of Subjects:   
 
It is estimated that approximately 200 patients will be included for this study.  The 
individual number for each group will vary based on screening.  
 
Gender and Age of Subjects:   
 
No restrictions apply to gender of the study subjects.  Only adult, non -pregnant patients 
will be included, define d as 18 years of age or older.  
 
a) Racial and Ethnic Origin:   
 
No restrictions apply to race or ethni c origin of the study subjects.  
 
3.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria   
  
a) Inclusion Criteria:   
 
• Adult patients 18 years of age or older

epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], phenylephrine, dopamine, or vasopressin)  
• Admitted to the medical  intensive care unit ( MICU) at Rush University Medical 
Center (RUMC)

Page 3 of 6 
Version date: 9/3 /[ADDRESS_33873] within 24 
hours of admission to RUMC or if they required neuromuscular blockade.   
 
Patients will be reviewed from 01/01/2012 to 08 /1/[ADDRESS_33874] of MICU patients w ill be 
generated by [CONTACT_34384]-9 and ICD -10 codes for septic shock .  Patients will be 
stratified into 4  groups :  1) not on either a  chronic  β-blocker  or ACE -Inhibitor,  2) on chronic β-
blocker , 3) on chronic ACE -Inhibitor , and 4) on both chronic β-blocker  and ACE -inhibitor.   
 
4.2.    Process of Consent  
 
This study is a retrospective study and therefore it is not feasible to obtain consent.  Direct 
patient involvement is not needed in the study and information will only be gathered from pre -
existing data i n the patients’ medical record.  All data will be de -identified to limit the chance 
of exposure of protected health information (PHI).  
 
5. METHODS AND STUDY PROCEDURES  
 
5.1. Efficacy & Safety Assessments  
 
The electronic medical record system (EPIC) will be used to collect data, including: patient age, 
gender, weight, height, BMI, race, past m edical history (hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, 
afib/flutter, arrhythmia, history of myocardial infarction, hi story of CVA, CAD, CKD, 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], asthma, COPD, cancer ), Charlson Comorbidity Index, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], 
medical intensive care uni t (MICU) length of stay .  Prior to admission medications include:  
beta-blockers, ACE -inhibitors, amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], diltia zem, ARBs, hydralazine, clonidine, hctz, loop 
diruetics, amiodarone, other antiarrhythmics .  Vasopressor types and cumulative doses 
including:  norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238], epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], phenylephrine, dopamine, and vasopressin.  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], phenylephrine, and dopamine  will be converted to norepi[INVESTIGATOR_34378]: 100 mcg dopamine equivalent to 1 mcg norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238], 1 
mcg epi[INVESTIGATOR_34379] 1 mcg norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238], and 2.2 mcg phenylephrine equivalent to 
1 mcg norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238].5,6  Concomitant medications including:  hydrocortisone, inotrope use, 
crystalloid type and amount, colloid use, albumin use, timing of antibiotics, and sedation choice 
if given.  Clinical information collected include:  Peak lactate, MAP, mechanical ventilation, in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380], 28 and  90 day mortality if available .  SOFA score will be calculated as a 
measure of disease severity.

Version date: 9/3 /[ADDRESS_33876] withdrawal will not be an issue encountered.  
 
8. STUDY DRUG/DEVICE/BIOLOGIC ADMINISTRATION/ASSIGNMENT  
 
This study does not involve the implementation of a s tudy drug, device, or biologic.  
 
9. SAFETY AND REPORTABLE EVENTS  
 
Given the design of this study we will not be prospectively collecting adverse events that 
require reporting.  
 
10. RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
 
10.1. Potential Risks  
 
There are  minimal risks to the study subjects.  The only potential risk is invasion of privacy 
since medical records will be accessed.  All data will be de -identified to limit the chance of 
exposure of PHI.  
 
10.2. Protection Against Risks  
 
It will be the responsibility of the primary investigator (PI) for  data collection and storage  in a 
safe, secure area and password protected computer when identifying eligible patients .  Research 
Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) will be used for data collection and storage. Patient 
confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_34385] -identified data onto the data collection 
form.   Although the data collected and stored in REDCap will be exported for analysis, the 
exported data will contain no unique, patient -identifying information.  
 
10.3. Potential Benefits to Subjects  
 
There are no potential ben efits to patients in this study  
 
10.4. Alternatives to Participation  
 
There are no alternatives to participation available for stu dy subjects given the design of the 
study

13. DATA ANALYSIS AND MONITORING  
 
13.1. Sample Size Determination  
 
There are limited data for proper evaluation of a sample size.  However, there was a smaller 
presented study that had a dramatic decrease in norepi[INVESTIGATOR_34381] a β-blocker s 
or ACE -inhibitor s prior to admission  for patients in circulatory shock  of any kind.7 Using these 
data, e stimated 48h cumulative mean dose for norepi [INVESTIGATOR_34382]-hypertensives 
will be  50 mg (SD = 10)  and e stimated 48h cumulative mean dose for norepi[INVESTIGATOR_34383], ACE -Inhibitor, and beta -blocker + ACE -Inhibitor groups will be 25 mg (SD = 10) .  
Using a [ADDRESS_33877] size from 
previous study (f = 1.08) the total sample size would be 16

13.2. Planned Statistical Analysis  
 
All data will be reported using descriptive statistics with mean (SD) used to describe normally 
distributed data and median (interquartile r ange [IQR]) used for non -normal data or data with a 
significant number of outliers .  Distribution of data and assessment of normality will be 
analyzed .  Chi -squared, Fisher’s Exact and Student’s t -test as appropriate will be used to assess 
differences among the study cohorts .  A 4-way fixed effects ANOVA wi ll be utilized for the 
primary outcome , cumulative vasopressor dose at [ADDRESS_33880] hoc  pairwise comparisons 
will be completed between groups  using Bonferroni’s, Turkey, or Hochberg’s GT2 depending 
on final group size and variance .  Statistical support for data evaluation will be sought out if 
necessary.

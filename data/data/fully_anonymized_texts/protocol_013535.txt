 
Resourcefulness Intervention to Promote Self -Management in Parents of Technology -Dependent 
Children  
 
 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
11/8/[ADDRESS_857559] the effectiveness of a 
Resourcefulness Training I ntervention (RTI©) designed for parent caregivers  of 
technology -dependent children on the parents’  (a) psychological and physical outcomes 
at [ADDRESS_857560] -intervention; and (b) self -management 
behaviors (sleep, positive health practices) over [ADDRESS_857561] -intervention . Theoretical 
underpi[INVESTIGATOR_640753] s with greater resourcefulness will experience less 
stress and are better able to maintain self -management behaviors than caregivers with lower 
resourcefulness.28,30 Therefore, RTI© (©1995, Jaclene A. Zausz niewski) is hypothesized to 
improve a parent’s psychological and physical outcomes and self -management behaviors, 
enhancing his/her ability to deliver care to a technology -dependent child.15,18,29,47 We plan to 
measure the effects of RTI on resourcefulness , parent outcomes, and self -management 
behaviors (sleep, positive health practices).  
The specific aims of the study are to: Aim 1 : Determine whether the RTI  versus 
Attention Control improves  psychological (mental HRQoL , depressive cognitions, depressive 
symptoms, appraised stress, burden) and physical outcomes (physical HRQoL, chronic stress 
[hair cortisol]) over 9 months in parents of technolo gy-dependent children, after controlling for 
covariates (parent race/ethnicity, gender, family income,  caregiving duration,  and children’s 
functional status , technology type).32 Aim 2:  Determine whether changes in psychological and 
physical outcomes are me diated by [CONTACT_640783]’ levels of resourcefulness  based on 
intervention condition . Aim 3 : Compare self -management behavior (sleep, positive health 
practices) over 9 months in parents who received RTI versus Attention Control. Aim 4 : Explore 
whether r esourcefulness is a mediator between intervention condition and self-management 
behaviors , controlling for baseline sleep and positive health practices over 9 months. Aim 5:  
Explore the relationship between self -management behavior and parent psychological  and 
physical outcomes  based on intervention condition . Aim 6 : Compare target children’s 
healthcare use (ER visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_598]) over 9 months based on parent intervention condition . 
We hypothesize that: 1) parents receiving the RTI© will have significant improvement in 
outcomes (psychological and physical health, self -management behaviors) compared with 
parents in the Attention Control arm, and 2) resourcefulness will mediate the effect of the 
intervention on all study outcomes.  
 
Parent  caregivers of children who require life -saving technology such as m echanical 
ventilation  or feeding tubes must maintain a high level of vigilan ce 24 hours a day, 7 days a 
week , due to their child’s potential for acute exacerbations and unknown illness trajectory . Their 
chronic stress related to caregiving while juggling household responsibilities affects  their blood 
pressure, cortisol level ,1-3 sleep patterns,4-7 and overall physical health,2,8 compromises self-
management behaviors9 and caregiving capacity,10-12 and leads to more frequent emergency 
room (ER) visits and ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_640754] -dependent child.13-15  It is not surprising,  
therefore, that t hese caregivers report greater levels of stress a nd poorer  psychological and 
physical health than do caregivers of Alzheimer’s patients,16-18 which dramatically  increases 
their mortality risk.19,20 Technology -dependent children (approximately 600,000) are among the 
sickest and most vulnerable subset of children with complex chronic conditions  in the United 
States . They comprise 20% of all children  discharged from  the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21104],13 yet account 
for 61% of all healthcare spending for children,21 up to $110 billion annually.22 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_640755], only psychoeducational interventions are employed to bolster parents’  
ability to manage stress and minimize the long -term negative effects on them and their children.  
Self-management interventions based on cognitive -behavioral theory  significantly 
decreas es appraised stress and improve s psychological , physical , and self -management 
outcomes in many caregiver populations.23,[ADDRESS_857562] as th is study 
proposes to do. Resourcefulness Training is a cognitive -behavio ral intervention to enhance skill 
acquisition for stre ss management that  improve s psychological  and physical  outcomes and 
enhance s the care provided to care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].28-30 Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_640756] -
dependent children suggests that this intervention will  significant ly improve  psychological health 
outcomes and physical health -related quality of life (HRQoL) compared with mothers in a control 
group.[ADDRESS_857563] pi[INVESTIGATOR_48505] 22 mothers of technology -dependent children  we 
explored the  feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of the resourcefulness intervention.31   
Feasibility:  a majority (95.5%) completed s tudy components (journaling, questionnaires, follow 
up phone calls). There was minimal subject attrition by [CONTACT_1192] i ntervention group participants. 
Acceptability :  In content analysis of exit interview transcripts mothers in the RT group 
consistently reported  that the intervention helped them to work through challenges in their daily 
life by [CONTACT_640784]. “It’s a good little card to have because when you go through somethin g 
stressful, a lot of times you’re not thinking like you normally would…the journaling would bring 
out the reasons that I needed to do the (resourcefulness) things on the card.” They also 
indicated that journaling gave them an outlet to express their thoug hts and feelings about the 
situation and provided stress relief. Efficacy:  The means and standard deviations for study 
variables are shown in Table 3. Cohen’s d effect sizes for mental health outcome variables 
between baseline and 6 weeks for the RT interv ention group were as follows: Negative Emotion 
Checklist (d=0.52), Depressive Cognition Scale (d=0.22). This indicates a medium and small 
effect of the intervention on these mental health outcomes respectively  thus a promising 
result.31 However, to date, Resourcefulness Training  has not been tested in a large sample of 
parent  (mothers and fathers) caregivers  or in relation to sleep and positive health practices; we 
will be the first . 
 
 Inclusion  Criteria  
1. Parent primary caregiver (biological, adoptive, or foster mother, father , 
grandmother or grandfather) for a technology -dependent child based on the Office 
of Technology Assessment (OTA) classification criteria32 (Group 1, mechanical 
ventilators; Group 2, intravenous nutrition/medication; Group 3, respi[INVESTIGATOR_640757]). For children with more than one type of technology, we will 
follow OTA guidelines for classification.  
2. At least [ADDRESS_857564] be 17. 4 years or younger and receive care 
in the home from his/her parent  
 
***For the Intervention Exit Interview - We will include all the above inclusion criteria 1 -4 but 
will add the following:  
5. Subjects who were randomly assigned to the Intervention Arm and completed the 
Resourcefulness Training© session with the interventionist  and completed Time 5 data collection.  
 
 
 
 
 Exclusion  Criteria  
1. Parents of children with a cancer diagnosis due to the short term use of technology 
following initial diagnosis and treatment  
***For the Intervention Exit Interview - We will include the above exclusion criteria 1 but will 
add the following:  
 
2. Subjects  who were randomly assigned to the Attention Control arm . 
 
We will enroll 100 subjects  for this study at UH CMC , 50 subjects from Akron Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3491] [ADDRESS_857565] the study at an y time.  
 
In addition, we will invite foster parents who (to the best of their knowledge) will be caring for 
the technology -dependent child long term. This research includes parents of children who are 
patients in pediatric clinics and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_640758]/state. 
Because we will be asking the foster parent questions about the child’s type of technological 
equipment and functional status questions such as their eating and sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], a representative of 
the Department of Child ren and Family Services (who are the legal guardian of the child) will 
review and sign a consent form to permit the child's participation (which is limited to 
information gathering about the child). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_640759]'s 
participation to the representative of DCFS/legal guardian of the child. Once all questions are 
answered, and providing that the legal guardian agrees to the child's role in the study, he/she will 
sign the informed consent in the signature [CONTACT_640836] “Lega lly Authorized Representative ” 
and return it to the PI.  
 
Participant recruitment and enrollment:  The RB&C Specialty Clinics (Pulmonary, 
Gastroenterology, Trach/Vent, Comprehensive Care, Aerodigestive) the RB&C PI[INVESTIGATOR_640760]. 
Potential participants can then call the study staff with questions or to volunteer.  
 
We will also check EMR (All Scripts, Soarian, Whiteboard , Community Record ) and do 
prescreening for potential participants by [CONTACT_640785]. We will come to clinic to meet those who  meet eligibility to invite them to hear 
more about the study. If they are interested the study team member will ask about a date/time for 
appointment. If they are unsure of their schedule we will ask for the best way to contact [CONTACT_640786] a time/place of their choosing like their home or a library.  
 
Another recruitment strategy will be to post IRB approved study flyers in RB&C/UH 
Common areas, Family Learning Center and Family Resource Center as well as the RB&C 
inpatient units such as the PI[INVESTIGATOR_640761] -dependent children and their 
corresponding famil y lounge bulletin boards or posting areas as well as clinic rooms. This will 
help to gain visibility of our study to enhance recruitment efforts.  
 
We will also distribute our br ochures and flyers at family health fairs, specialty organization 
meetings, support groups, parenting events and gatherings that are frequented by [CONTACT_640787] -dependent children in Northeast Ohio community to promote awareness of the study 
by [CONTACT_640788]. In addition, they will be distributed to organizations such as United Cerebral 
Palsy, Achievement Center of Cleveland, Health Departments that provide services for 
technology -dependent children and their families. We will also place ads in regional  Parenting 
Magazines and Facebook to help promote recruitment.  
 
We will also use snowball recruitment. While we will not ask participants or potential 
participants to recruit however some parents may know friends/acquaintances (parents of 
technology -dependent children) from organizations that they are involved in and a sk about 
letting these friends know about signing up for the study. We would make certain that the 
participant knows that this is voluntary thus up to them to give our study contact [CONTACT_3031]. If 
requested, we would give them our study brochure/flyer to pass along to their friend.  
 
The RB&C Specialty Clinics (Pulmonary, Gastroenterology, Trach/Vent, Comprehensive Care , 
Aerodigestive) , the NICU/NICU step down unit on RB&C4  and RB&C [ADDRESS_857566] the researcher will b e 
sent by [CONTACT_640789] . The letter also informs the parent  that study staff will follow -up 
with him/her by [CONTACT_640790] [ADDRESS_857567] the 
research team in 2  week s after the letter was mailed, a phone call will be made to invite them to 
volunteer for the study.  This method of recruitment has been successful in the  Principal 
Investigator’s previous studies. An information sheet with talking points  that is to be discussed  
with a child over age [ADDRESS_857568].  The questions asked during the 
interview do not present more than minimal risk or harm to the participants and the interview 
does not contain any procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the 
research context according to 45 CFR 46.117 (c ) 2. See attached document for pre -screening 
question. This question will determine if the child remains dependent on medical technology and 
thus determine s the parent 's eligibility for particip ation in the study.  Following this assessment 
and affirmation of the parent’s willingness to participate they will be queried if they received the 
information sheet with talking points and discussed it with their child . With the above confirmed, 
the parent  will be asked to set up an appointment with the research staff at a mutuall y convenient 
time and location.  
 
In addition to the informational letter that will be sent to potential participants identified 
by [CONTACT_8979], clinic providers will hand out a fly er that gives the study contact [CONTACT_3031]. It 
will be up to the parent to then contact [CONTACT_640791]. The flyer will help to advertise the study.  
 
We will also recruit potential participants using Faceboo k and Twitter. Both forms of 
social media will assist in the distribution of the IRB approved study flyer to enhance 
recruitment efforts. We will include limits of Northeast Ohio since data collection is done face -
to-face.  This includes development of a Fa cebook page that includes contact [CONTACT_640792]. “Friend” requests will be made to parent 
caregiver organizations who have members likely to meet eligibility requirements that includes 
an introductory le tter asking for permission to post the IRB approved study flyer on their 
Facebook page . The informational letter to be sent with the friend request is attached. We will 
also recruit using Facebook ads that target users that have connections with technologi cal 
equipment, technology -dependence and children. Twitter will also be used for recruitment. An 
image of the IRB approved study flyer will be attached with the tweets.  Tweets are limited to 
140 characters or less. Tweets will be used and an image of the s tudy flyer wi ll be attached with 
the tweets.  As we find more followers and parent caregiver organizations, we will tag them in 
our tweets to increase our visibility. “@” will be used to  tag or mention an organization  and “#” 
will be used to categorize the tweets. Here are examples of tweets:  
@Parent TDkid asks for  help with research study to test a way to reduce stress in #parent 
#caregivers of technology -depen dent children in Northeast Ohio.  
@Parent TDkid Are you a #pa rent #caregiver of a child who uses #oxygen #ventilator or #gtube 
medical technology in Northeast Ohio?

technology in Northeast Ohio. Please contact [CONTACT_640793] . 
 
Another recruitment site will be the Cleveland Metropolitan School District. The school nurses 
who manage the care of children dependent on special technology (medications, tube feedings, 
treatments) during the school day will send a n informational  letter reg arding this research study 
and IRB approved study flyer home to the parents /guardians  in the child's backpack  with their  
medications, formula for feedings or other supplies . The letter will introduce the study and invite 
them to call the study office and/or if interested in hearing more about the study they ma y fill in 
their name [CONTACT_640837]-addressed, stamped 
envelope  provide d. The study team would then call the parent (no more than 3 phone attempts) 
and answer any questions they may have and if they are interested in enrolling in the study invite 
them to schedule an appointment for informed consent and data collection.  
 
Additionally, Akron Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39174] a recruitment site. Designated members of 
Akron Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_640762] s who meet inclusion criteria. For in -person visi ts the parent will be 
approached at the clinic visit and given an IRB approved information sheet specific for Akron 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_640763], brochure. The information sheet 
gives a brief description of the study and if the pa rent is interested in hearing more about the 
study from the Case Western Reserve University  (CWRU) research team they are invited to fill 
in their name, address, phone number(s) and best times to contact [CONTACT_476]. For Akron Children's 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_640764] s a message is sent to the physician through Epic letting them know their 
patient has been prescreened as a potential candidate for the study. At the conclusion of the visit 
the physician then asks the parent if they are willing to hear about a research st udy that is 
examining ways to decrease stress in parents caring for a child dependent on technology. If they 
agree the physician will forward the link to the telehealth visit to the Akron nursing research 
team member after their portion of the visit is fin ished (link to the visit is sent in a secure chat 
feature in Epic when it is nurse research team member’s turn to talk).  The Study Information 
letter is reviewed with the caregiver and any of their questions are answered. If the caregiver 
agrees to have i nformation shared with CWRU, the nursing research team member collects their 
contact [CONTACT_3031], writes it on the sheet including the team member name [CONTACT_640838] a telehealth  visit.  The 
study coordinator from Akron Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (ACH) will send the name, address, phone 
number, ( best time to contact ) of potential study participants’ who have agreed to be contact[CONTACT_640794] s ecure email to the CWRU Project 
Manager.  The CWRU research team would then phone the potential participant to give more 
information about the study and answer any question s they may have. If interested in enrolling in 
the study, the CWRU research team memb er will schedule an appointment with the potential 
participant to obtain informed consent , consent  to have the technology dependent child’s 
information (i.e., ER visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_640765]’s enrollment in the study) released to 
[CONTACT_38817] and the  study team and data collection.  CWRU research team will send the parent’s 
completed and signed release of information form to ACH Study Coordinator via secure email. 
CWRU team wil l provide set up, training plus meet with the  ACH Study Coordinator and 
recruiting team on recruitment protocols. ACH Study Coordinator will schedule at least monthly 
teleconference to discuss progress on recruitment goals  (approximately 44 potential participants) . 
ACH Study Coordinator to send the C WRU research team the number of ER visits and number 
and length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_640754] -dependent children of enrolled study 
participants  after a completed, signed release of information form is received . 
 
An appointment will be made to meet  with the potential participant at the time and private place of 
their choosing (that has an area or nook for a private discussion with no outside person within  hearing 
distance of the conversation e.g., their home, public library, their place of employmen t, child's therapy 
center such as United Cerebral Palsy Center, Dahm's Clinical Research Un it) to obtain informed consent  
and collect data. The hair sample will be collected in a private place of the parent’s choosing . Study 
personnel  will obtain informed consent and explain to the potential participant that he/she is being 
asked to provide consent for participation in a research study. It will be explained that participation is 
totally voluntary and their choice regarding participation will not affect thei r child's care i n any way. 
Additionally, parents  will be given a description of the study, procedures, risks and benefits, 
confidentiality and voluntary nature of the study including the option to withdraw at any time. Fo llowing 
this discussion, parents  will be given the  consent form to review. Parents  will be given the opportunity 
to take a few minutes alone to revi ew the written consent form and to make a decision regarding 
participation. Parents  will be assured that none of the data obtained will be comm unicated to any 
healthcare personnel at the outpa tient clinic or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93966].  
The RB&C Specialty Clinics (Pulmonary, Gastroenterology, Trach/Vent, Com prehensive Care, 
Aerodigestive)  will identify names and contact [CONTACT_640795]. 
We will also screen patients being seen in the above clinics using EMR.  
There are approximately [ADDRESS_857569] not been enrolled in one of the investigators previous 
studies with approximately 15 -20 new candidates at each site per year. Akron Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_640766] [ADDRESS_857570] of the parent’s choosing such as 
their home, library , place of employment, or restaurant . Our study office is located in the FPB 
School of Nursing, CWRU.  
 
As described in the above section we will recruit our participants from a number of RB&C 
Specialty Clinics (Pulmonary, Gastroenterology, Trach/Vent, Comprehensive Care , 
Aerodigestive ). We will also ask the school nurses from the Cleveland Metropolitan School 
District to send study informational letter and study flyer home to eligible p arents. Akron 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_640767]. We will also distribute our brochures and flyers at family health 
fairs, specialty organization meetings, su pport groups, parenting events and gatherings that are 
frequented by [CONTACT_640796] -dependent children in Northeast Ohio community to 
promote awareness of the study by [CONTACT_29436]. In addition, they will be distributed to 
organizations such as United Cerebral Palsy, Achievement Center of Cleveland, Health 
Departments that provide services for technology -dependent children and their families.  We will 
also use social media such as Facebook and Twitter as well as place Facebook ads to advertise 
the study.  The RB&C specialty clinics will provide lists of eligible participants so that an 
introductory letter can be sent out to potential participants asking them to contac t the study office 
or in [ADDRESS_857571] them to see if they are interested in part icipating. We will also be 
using UH EMR ( e.g., Community Record, Sorian ) to screen RB&C specialty clinics described 
above for potential participants and go to the clinic to invite them to hear more about the study. 
We will also have Cleveland Clinic staff in the above mentioned specialty clinics identifying and 
inviting paren ts of their patients to participate in the study.  
 
Consent Process  
1. Indicate whether you will be  obtaining consent : 
☒  Yes  ☐  No 
 
If yes, answer the following questions:  
1. Describe w here the consent process  will take place : 
  Private place of the parent’s choosing.  
 
2. The time that will be devoted to the consent discussion:   
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], it takes [ADDRESS_857572] and 
obtaining the consent :  
The potential p articipant will have time between when they schedule the 
appointment and arriving at the appointment.  
4. Steps that will be taken to ensure the research participants’ understanding:  
To ascertain that potential participants fully understand the study, what  is required 
of them, risks and benefits and their rights as a participant they will be asked to 
indicate understanding with a "yes" or "no" response. They will also be given an 
opportunity to ask any questions they have regarding the study.  
 
 
5. Any process to ensure ongoing consent :  
The participant ensures ongoing consent if they schedule and show up for data 
collection appointments.  
 
6. The role of the individuals listed in the application as being involved in the 
consent process :  
All listed on the appli cation as obtaining consent will ask the potential participant 
if they would prefer to read the consent or to if they’d like the study team member 
to go through the consent form with the participant. The study team member 
would then answer any questions th ey may have about the study.   
 
7. Steps that will be taken to minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence 
to the subjects:   
No study team member performing consent process will be provider of care for 
the parent, child. Study t eam members obtaining consent will be certain to 
mention that they are volunteers and their care won’t be affected in any way by 
[CONTACT_640797].  
1. Give the rationale for the request of a waiver or alteration of the consent process or 
documentation :       
We need to have a waiver due to prescreening to verify if the individual is eligible for the 
study.  
 
 
2. Explain how the research involves no more than minimal risk      
 Minimal risk is involved with participation in this study. Physical risks might  
involve fatigue  thus parents will be given a choice to take a break at any point during the 
interview or intervention session.  Writing about the stress of caring for their child in their 
log (intervention group) might bring out uncomfortable feelings. Parents will be 
instructed that if they experience distre ss, they may stop the writing in the online log  and 
contact [CONTACT_16133]. To reduce the risk of a breach in confidentiality we will  assign 
each subject a code number and use that number rather than names to identify parents on 
all study forms. Identifying data and consent forms will be separated from study data and 
kept in a separate, locked file cabinet.  
 
3. Explain why the waiver or a lteration of consent will not adversely affect the rights and 
welfare of the participants :     
The potential participant retains the right of privacy in that they can  refuse to answer the 
questions about whether  their child still requires medical technol ogy such as described in 
the inclusion criteria, if they care for the child and confirmation of the age of the child. 
The prescreening question s do not affect their welfare  above that experienced in daily 
life.   
 
4. Explain why the research could not practic ably be carried out without the waiver or alteration 
of consent.      
Without the waiver to ask the prescreening questions we would not know if they qualify 
for the study therefore whether we should continue giving a description of the study or 
setting up  an appointment.  
 
5. If you will obtain consent, but not document consent in writing (e.g. over the phone, verbally, 
electronic survey, etc.), please describe and provide a rationale.   
     ☒  N/A  
 
An appointed child advocate will be appointed for a foster child whose foster parent would like 
to participate in the study. The advocate will act in the best interests of the child. The research is 
not FDA -regulated. The research is a randomized controlled trial to examine effectiveness of the 
Resourcefuln ess Training intervention on the health and wellbeing of parent caregivers. It is 
hypothesized to be of benefit for the parent caregivers. The research would not be able to be 
practically carried out to include foster parents in a diverse sample of partici pants without the 
waiver of consent because the biological parent does not have custody of the child.  
 
 
The proposed study is a longitudinal ( 9-month) RCT in which primary caregiver parent s (as 
defined in inclusion criteria) of technology -dependent children will be randomly assigned to one 
of two study arms: (1) The Attention Control arm  will receive weekly phone calls for the first [ADDRESS_857573] questions or concerns ; and (2) The 
Resourcefulness Training© arm will receive (a) individually tailored instruction on pe rsonal 
and social resourcefulness skills  via the Resourcefuln ess Video and interventionist , (b) 
instruction for the online log -writing  (via REDCap) so for the parent to describe resourcefulness 
application , (c) access to the study website with videotape vignettes  and Resourcefulness 
Video , and (d) boosters at [ADDRESS_857574] -enrollment  that will include reinforcement of 
skills learned and additional online log  writing. Measures of parents’  outcomes (mental and 
physical HRQoL, depressive cognitions, depressive symptoms , appraised stress, and burden) 
and self -management behaviors (appraised/objective sleep, positive health practices) will be 
obtained at enrollment (T1), then 6 weeks (T2), 3 months (T3 ), 6 months (T4) , and 9 months 
(T5) post-enrollment to  analyze the immediate, extended, and long -term effects of the 
intervention on parents’ outcomes. Chronic stress will be measured by [CONTACT_640798]’ hair 
cortisol levels and objective sleep by [CONTACT_640799] T1, T3, T4 , and T5  to examine changes over 
time. We will also obtain measures of the mediating (personal and social resourcefulness) 
variable and covariates (caregiver’s race/ethnicity, gender , family income,  duration of 
caregiving,  child’s functional status , and type of technology ). 
 
Resea rch Procedures.  The Project Director will notify the data collector  of potential 
participants . He/she will schedule an appointment at a mutually agreed  upon time and in a 
private place of the parent’s  choosing  (e.g., parent’s home , library) . At that meeting, the  data 
collector  will have the parent read the consent form and answer any questions. After written, 
informed consent is obtained, the data collector will collect baseline (T1) data (questionnaires), 
and afterwards collect a hair sample (at the place of the data collection visit) for hair cortisol 
analysis from the vertex of the parent’s head using a standardized protocol.[ADDRESS_857575] the parent regarding the Actiwatch (Philips Respi[INVESTIGATOR_5770], Bend, OR) 
protocol to measu re sleep patterns. This includes application of the Actiwatch on the non -
dominant wrist during the enrollment visit with instructions to wear it continuously for 10 days in 
order to capture baseline sleep patterns.  Parents will also rec eive instructions o n a sleep 
history booklet  that will supplement Actiwatch actigraphy data during sleep pattern analysis 
(e.g., reason for night awakenings). Following data collection, the Project Director will log into a 
secured database and receive the subject’s randomly assigned study arm (Attention Control or 
Resourcefulness Training). Data collectors will be blinded to all participants’ study arm 
assignment. Randomization will be performed using Minim,91 a computer minimization stratified 
randomization program. Minimiza tion helps achieve balance in treatment assignment within 
strata for targeted covariates.92 Stratification variables are sex (female, male), race/ethnicity 
(White non -Hispanic, all others), and OTA32 group (mechanical ventilator, intravenous 
nutrition/medi cation, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]/nutritional support). In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_640768] (NOT -OD-16-148), the PI [INVESTIGATOR_640769].  The Graduate Student RA will keep a list  in our NIH Regulatory 
Binder.  
 
Attention Control arm . The Attention Control arm will receive study attention via in -person 
contact [INVESTIGATOR_136] T1, T3 -5, weekly phone calls from the Project Director (2 -4 minutes) for the first [ADDRESS_857576] Director will ask parents to describe how they/their child are doing. 
These calls will help to build a relat ionship with subjects to promote study retention. We 
recognize that in this group parents may obtain self -initiated caregiving information and support, 
which will vary among this group. We will use the Information and Support Form to monitor their 
acquisit ion of information and support at [ADDRESS_857577] -
enrollment. While usual care may vary depending on the healthcare providers seen, all parents 
assigned to this group can call a physician or nurse to ask specific questions as  needed.  
      Resourcefulness Training Intervention© arm.  After we collect  T1 data, the interventionist  will 
schedule an appointment to conduct the initial instruction for the RTI© during a  session lasting 
approximately [ADDRESS_857578] of the parent’s choosing  or via Zoom  using a 
computer, tablet or smart phone . The interventionist  will also conduct all intervention arm follow up. 
The intervention includes:  tailored instruction on personal and social resourcefulness sk ills using the 
Resourcefulness Video and viewing video vignettes via an iPad, 4 weeks of skills’ reinforcement usi ng 
daily semi -structured online log  writing  in REDCap , weekly phone c alls from the interventionist  for [ADDRESS_857579] -
intervention (Table 1). Spec ifically, the interventionist  will teach 3 social (help -seeking) and 5 personal 
(self -help) resourcefulness skills using mnemonic strategies (acronym, practice) to l earn them. Subjects 
will learn to use the acronym to prompt recall of skills. They will be given a wallet -sized, laminated card 
to keep in their journal and a refrigerator magnet listing these skills as convenient, daily r eminders. The 
interventionist  will play the Resourcefulness Video that explains each skill in order, identifying which 
skills reflect help -seeking, and which reflect self -help. Additional teaching will be individually tailored to 
each parent’s specific s ituation. The interventionist  will a sk the parent for examples of how he/she 
previously has applied each of the skills. I f he/she cannot do so, the interventionist  will provide 
examples by [CONTACT_640800] a recent stressful situation. To gether, the parent and the 
interventionis t will develop examples of how each skill can be used for that specific situation. For 
example, if the parent feels overwhelmed by [CONTACT_640801] -
dependent child and other family ta sks, then the interventionist  would discuss  the use of each skill The 
interventionist  will also ask the parent to describe other situations where the skills can be applied in the 
future. Parents will be given the opportunity to ask questions and seek clarification of each skill as 
needed.

demonstrating practical examples of resourcefulness skill application delivered by 
[CONTACT_640796] -dependent children who participated in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  The parents 
share personal stories o f using resourcefulness skills while caring for their technology -
dependent children. A total of 15 short (1 -3 minute) videotapes are posted on the website, with 
at least one vignette for each of the [ADDRESS_857580] them access the website 
during the intervention visit. We will temporarily lend a study iPad with built in Wi -Fi to any 
intervention participant without internet access through a computer or sm artphone during the 
initial 4 -week period and at booster sessions as needed.  
The Resourcefulness Video and Video Vignettes will be accessible to intervention arm 
participants via the secure study website compatible with a household computer or mobile 
device 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for the study duration.  The videos will b e loaded onto 
Vimeo (approved by [CONTACT_640805]# 08 -10-30) and embedded in Qualtrics to track user 
interactions. We will use Qualtrics to enable subjects to access all study com ponents while 
allowing  study staff to track subjects’ activities. Qualtrics uses secure, encrypted data collection 
that restricts access of data to study staff and provides interaction analytics, including frequency 
of access to the videos.  
      Prac tice in conjunction with  writing in the REDCap log is another strategy the 
intervention arm will use to reinforce and accelerate acquisition of resourcefulness skills 
and help incorporate them into their daily routine.  The interventionist  will discuss with the 
parents the importance of continued daily practice of each of the resourcefulness skills, 
personalizing the skills by [CONTACT_640806], and if desired, 
recording their thoughts and feelings related to such events in a journa l. More specifically, the  
parents will be asked to review their acronym r eminder card each day . They will check off 
(yes/no) in their semi -structured REDCap log  which resourcefulness skills they used that day 
and if they found the skill helpful.  The log  also provides space to express their thoughts and 
feelings about use of the skills related to caring for their child or daily tasks and any 
resourcefulness skills they used. Th ey can also write in the log  a plan for use of a particular 
resourcefulness skill.  We will ask  them to write in their log  daily for 4 weeks, at about the same 
time ever y day . They will receive up to daily reminders (via text if participant checks box on 
consent form indicating agreement) based on their rate of completion. The participant 
preference for timing of reminders (daily or twice weekly) will be asked at first contact [CONTACT_640807]. Their preference will then be noted in the Intervention REDCap Database . To 
promote adherence, the intervention ist will call  the parents weekly (5 minutes) for [ADDRESS_857581] 4 weeks of the intervention to monitor for signs of psychological 
distress.  
      Booster sessions  of RTI© will be delivered at [ADDRESS_857582]’s memory of resourcefulness skills and pr event decline in skill 
usage.98-[ADDRESS_857583] the parent’s recall of skills learned, review skills that have been forgotten, determine 
whether he/she still has and uses the reminder card and magnet, ask for examples of skill 
application since the last study contact [CONTACT_640808], and collaboratively plan approaches to promote continued skill application. 
Parents who are un able to locate the reminder  card and/or magnet will be mailed a new one. 
Because practice is an important component of this intervention, we will ask them to begin 1 
week of daily REDCap log  as they did for the initial  RTI. We will phone them one week afte r 
each booster session (2 -3 minutes) t o inquire about their use of the REDCap log  and answer 
questions about application of resourcefulness skills.  
      Ensuring Fidelity of the Intervention (Interventionist ). Drs. Toly and Zauszniewski will use a 
system atic procedure  to train the interventionist  and monitor standardized administration of the RTI©. 
Examples of each resourcefulness skill and instructions for intervention delivery will be included in the 
written protocol and  given to the interventionist . Before enrollmen t begins, the interventionist  will have 
two practice sessions with student volunteers, who will present typi[INVESTIGATOR_640770], to assess intervention fidelity. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_640771] [ADDRESS_857584] 30% of the recordings to monitor for the delivery, receipt, and enactment of the 
interventions, evaluating them using an intervention fidelity checklist based on the guidelines of Bellg et 
al.[ADDRESS_857585]  when scheduled for the intervention appointment  that they will need to sign a 
consent form. If in agre ement, emailed a GM -23 consent form via REDCap to be signed prior to 
the audiotaped int ervention session. If any participant  refuse s to consent  it will be noted in the 
REDCap form . Retraining will occur if 100% accurate delivery of the intervention is not 
achieved. Once enrollment has begun, the Project Director and [CONTACT_640839] will hold weekly 
supervision meet ings with the interventionist  and data collectors to addres s questions or 
concerns. Log s will be analyzed for the number of days entries were completed,  as well as the 
number, type, and exemplars of each resourcefulness skill. [CONTACT_640840], who has used journals 
and diaries102,103 in mixed -methods research with grandmother caregivers in addition to our pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480], will oversee content analysis. Fidelity wil l also be assessed by [CONTACT_640809]104 and Resourcefulness Skills Scale86 over time.  
      Fidelity of the Intervention (Subject).  Fidelity of the intervention (uptake) for each subject 
(i.e., parent) will be measure d [ADDRESS_857586] outcomes for either group.  
Intervention Exit Survey . A brief 10 -15 minute survey will be administered via REDCap to 
participants who meet the following eligibility criteria : 1. randomized to the intervention arm ;  
2. completed the intervention and follow up data collection points ; and 3. have not asked to 
withdraw from the study . This brief survey includes questions about the intervent ion such as 
what the easiest/most challenging part was , ways we could make the Resourcefulness 
Training© better in the future.  Eligible p articipants will be notified (no more than 3 attempts) of 
the opportunity to complete the Intervention Exit Survey  using their preferred mode of contact 
[CONTACT_640810] , that participation  is voluntary . If they agree to complete the 
intervention exit survey,  we will inform them of the need to sign a consent form that includes the 
extra procedure; completion of the intervention exit survey. We will email the m the  REDCap link 
for the consent form and once they have signed the consent they will  proceed to the intervention 
exit survey .  
      Data Collection . The data  collectors will collect baseline data (T1) using 12 questionnaires 
to obtain demographic characteristics of the parent and technology -dependent child and to 
measure the parental outcomes, self -management behaviors, mediating variables, covariates, 
and des criptive variables (Table 2).  Based on previous experience, this will take about [ADDRESS_857587] studies found 9% of nights not scored due to artifact or 
device not worn.106 Instructions regarding Acti watch  (and sleep history booklet)  return to the 
study office in the self -addressed, postage paid envelope will be given. Subject s will also be 
given a sleep history booklet  and instructed to record the time they went to bed and woke up, 
number and reason f or night awakenings, and naps. Sleep history booklets  have been used in 
past studies for agreement and interpretation of actigraphy findings; 3 -10% were excluded due 
to non -compliance.[ADDRESS_857588] to keep the sleep history boo klet 
that will serve as a reminder.  Participants will be mailed a $[ADDRESS_857589] each time they return the 
Actiwatch and sleep history booklet to the study office (baseline and 3month, [ADDRESS_857590] baseline).  
Follow -Up Contacts and Data Col lection.  Data will be collected for both study arms via 
mailed questionnaires , emailed link to REDCap surveys  (depending on participant preference) 
at approximately 6 weeks (T2) after the initial delivery of the Resourcefulness Training 
Intervention or enr ollment for the control group . Reminder phone calls will be made by [CONTACT_640811] [ADDRESS_857591] en at  (e.g., phone calls to healthcare providers, amount and type of 
Internet usage to obtain information, social support or lay caregiving, home nursing) using the 
Information and Support Form by [CONTACT_1555] T2 and in person  T3-T5 (3, 6, [ADDRESS_857592] -
enrollment). Data collectors will also meet with parents face -to-face at T3 -T5 to collect 
questionnaire data, obtain hair samples, and reapply the Actiwatch and will be blinded to group 
assignment. Table [ADDRESS_857593] -enrollment, and then at 2 and 4 months after 
enrollment. We will also invite eligible intervention arm participants to complete the Intervention 
Exit Survey (see section Intervention Exit Survey above). If a parent asks a question about the 
care of their children, they will be referred to their healthcare provid er.  
Technology -Dependent Child Death . If a technology -dependent child dies during the study 
period, the Project Manager will send a condolence card to the family and obtain descriptive 
data about the date and cause of the child’s death  in the Electronic M edical Record . Data 
regarding the technology -dependent child’s death will not be collected by [CONTACT_640812].  
      Children Who No Longer Require Technology . Parents  whose children no longer require 
medical technology will remain in the study, and their data will be analyzed separately.[ADDRESS_857594] about 
5% will have technology discontinued and thus we will enroll additional participants to 
compensate for this attrition.  
      Retention Plans.  To maximize retention over the 9 months , we will send birthday cards on 
the parent’s  and child’s birthdays , as well as bi-monthly postcards with an inspi[INVESTIGATOR_640772]. Furthermore, we will re cruit data collectors who are 
experienced and comfortable working with families who have children with special needs.  
      Controlling diffusion of intervention approaches.  In our prior work, we found that few 
participants knew one another, so we believe  the threat of diffusion is low. We recognize the 
possibility of the Hawthorne effect impacting our data. Therefore, the research team believes 
that it is vital to reliably track the amount of information and emotional support obtained by 
[CONTACT_640813].  
 
      Measures.  Study measures will be obtained at baseline (study enrollment) , [ADDRESS_857595]-enrollment , time frames selected based on prior work with caregivers and 
RTI© in order to capture variability over time. Table 2 shows study measures and measurement 
points. We chose measures based on our prior work with caregivers that are psychometrically 
sound and/or recommended by [CONTACT_640814] -study analysis 
and increase the scientific impact of our study analyses.  
      Parent Outcome Variables: Parent  Mental and Physical HRQoL will be measured by [CONTACT_941]  10-
item Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMISR) Short Form v. 
1.[ADDRESS_857596] been extensively tested and 
demonstrate excellent psychometric properties. Depressive cognitions will be measured by [CONTACT_941] 
8-item Depressive Cognitions Scale110 to assess  cognitive symptoms that precede  
depression;111 higher scores indicat ing more depressive cognitions.110,112 Depressive symptoms 
will be measured by [CONTACT_941] 8-item PROMISR Short Form v 1.0 -Depression 8a.113 A clinically 
significant T score  of 60 (raw score ≥22) requires action steps (see Human Subjects).114 
Appraised stress (subjective) will be measured by [CONTACT_941] 10-item Perceived Stress Scale115 (NIH 
Toolkit); higher score s indicat e greater stress. The level of chronic stress will be measured by a 
hair cortisol sample that measures cortisol level over the past 3 months.68,90,116 Caregiver 
burden will be measured using the Zarit Burden Interview -12, a 12 -item tool assess ing caregiver 
burden, with  higher scores indicat ing higher burden.117 While originally  developed for caregivers 
of older adults , it has been successfully used with parent caregivers.118,119  
      Self-Management Behaviors:  Appraised sleep quality will be measured by [CONTACT_604991][INVESTIGATOR_22336] (PSQI), a 19 -item, self-report measure of sleep disturbance in adults120 It 
provi des a global score that includes 7 subscale scores: sleep quality, sleep duration, sleep 
latency, sleep disturbance, habitual sleep efficiency, daytime dysfunction, and sleep 
medications over the past month. A global sum of ≥5 indicates a “poor” sleeper.120 Objective 
sleep patterns (total sleep time, wake after sleep onset [WASO], sleep latency  [time to fall 
asleep ], sleep efficiency [% of time spent in bed sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]], longest sleep period, night -to-night 
instability [mean square successive differences])4 will be measured using the Actiwatch (Philips 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_5770], Bend, OR) for actigraphy. Actigraphy is a valid and reliable measure of sleep that 
is highly correlated with the clinical gold standard, polysomonography,121,[ADDRESS_857597] in identification of bedtime in -bed  
 
periods. Actigraphy will be analyzed using Actiware software (Philips Respi[INVESTIGATOR_5770], Bend, OR) to 
apply sleep/wake scoring algorithms, and summary reports wi ll be generated  to return the 
objective measures of sleep described above.  Positive health practices will be measured using 
the Personal Lifestyle Questionnaire, a 24 -item self -report tool that measures exercise, 
substance use, nutrition, relaxation, safet y, and general health promotion.123,124 Higher scores 
indicate more positive health practices.  
      Mediating Variable.  Personal and social resourcefulness  will be measured by [CONTACT_941] 28 -item 
Resourcefulness Scale that measures personal (16 items) and social  (12 items) resourcefulness 
skills.104 Higher scores indicate greater resourcefulness.  
      Covariates.  Parent covariates  (race/ethnicity, gender, family income , duration of caregiver 
role) will be recorded on the enrollment form. Child covariate s. Functional status  will be 
measured using the 14 -item Functional Status II -Revised (FS II -R);[ADDRESS_857598] with future intervention delivery improvements .  
      Descriptives.  The parent’s characteristics  (age, marital status, education) will be recorded 
using the enrollment form.  The amount of outside lay caregiving assistance  and home nursing  
will be recorded on the Information and Support Form . Interpersonal support will be measured 
by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_857599] (ISEL).126,127 Higher scores indicate greater 
social support. The technology -dependent child sample character istics  (age, gender, primary 
medical diagnosis)  will be recorded on the enrollment form.  
      Design and methods to achiev e robust and unbiased results (Rigor). This carefully 
powered [ADDRESS_857600] selected psychological measures with excellent psychometric properties.  
Measures to assess biological processes (sleep, cortisol) were chosen for their ability to  directly  
measure the process or marker being studied —a gap identified in prior res earch —thus reducing 
another source of error. Second, we have developed our analytic plan to incorporate relevant 
covariates and will achieve unbiased results by [CONTACT_281872] a dditional statistician to evaluate  
reproducibility of results via a confirmat ory analysis of study findings.  By [CONTACT_640815], we will establish reproducibility of results and ensure the 
robustness of our findings.  
      Study results will be generalizable to parent caregivers of technology -dependent 
children w ith complex chronic conditions. We have broad  inclusion criteria , increasing  
generalizability of results. All parent caregivers’ children  will be technology -dependent with  a 
range of complex , chronic conditions. Based on prior work , we expect our sample to range in 
age from [ADDRESS_857601] recruitment, da ta collection and coding, and data management. The Graduate 
Student Research Assistant will be responsible for the day -to-day data management of the 
study.  
 
 
Sample Size and Justification.  Using data obtained from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], parents’ 
outcomes at baseline and 6 weeks in the control and intervention arms (e.g., standard deviation 
and correlation between outcomes measured at baseline and 6 weeks), a two -stage model for 
longitudinal data that assumes an exchangeable correlation structure among pairs of outcomes 
measured at five time points, and a Bonferroni corrected, two -sided significance level of 0.05/2 = 
0.025 to account for multiple comparisons between the two arms, the detectable mea n 
differences ( d) in the monthly rates of change in each outcome between two arms that will be 
detected with ≥80% power based on a total sample size of 144 (72 subjects per arm) are as 
follows: parent’s depressive cognitions ( d = 0.22 ) and parent’s HRQoL ( d = .45 ). Based on prior 
longitudinal research with caregivers,41,[ADDRESS_857602] a 20 -30% attrition rate by [CONTACT_43380] 9. We will 
enroll a total of 2 10 parents (10 5 per arm).  
ANALYSIS   
      We hypothesize that: 1) parents receiving the RTI© will have significant improvement in 
outcomes (psychological and physical health, self -management behaviors) compared with 
parents in the Attention Control arm, and 2) resourcefulness will mediate the effect of the 
intervention on all study outcomes.  
      Preliminary Analyses. Exploratory data techniques will be performed by [CONTACT_640816] (central tendency, dispersion, and distribution)  
of demographics and covariates measured upon randomization in each arm.  These exploratory 
techniques will be based on proportions (in the case of dichotomous variables) and medians 
and/or means (in the case of variables measured on an interval scale). Due to randomization, no 
formal tests of these variables will be performed because any imbalance between arms is known 
to be due to chance. Profile plots will also be used to describe the participant -specific (parent) 
and arm -specific trends for each outcome over the five time points. Differentiation in outcomes, 
due to the sex, will be studied in the preliminary analysis using descriptive statistics and graphs 
(e.g. box plots). In the regression analyses (presented below) we will control the effects of sex as Estimated time required (minutes)  Pre-Screening  Time

      Primary Analyses.   
      Aims 1 & 3: Analysis of the monthly rate of change for each parent outcome in each arm will 
be estimated via linear mixed models and fit using SAS PROC MIXED.128,129 Each model will 
include a random intercept and slope (possibly modeled using a polynomial spline) to account 
for between -subject variance in each outcome over time. Conditional on these random effects, 
we will explore within -subject variance in each outco me over time using different residual 
covariance structures and select the most appropriate structure using likelihood -based criteria. 
Fixed effects will include a continuous variable to represent time since randomization, an 
indicator variable to represen t the intervention, and stratification factors used during 
randomization (facility, OTA technology group, race/ethnicity). Assuming a linear rate of change 
over time, the regression coefficient of the terms representing interactions between time and the 
intervention indicator variable will be used to estimate the difference in the monthly rate of 
change in each outcome between arms.  
      Aim 2 & 4: To determine if resourcefulness mediates the effect of the RTI© on parent 
outcomes (psychological and physic al health, self -management behaviors), a theory -based causal 
mediation model130,[ADDRESS_857608] (or mediated) 
effects and estimate the proportion of the total effect that is me diated. Variance estimates and 
95% confidence intervals will be estimated using a bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_640773] [ADDRESS_857609] using measurements of the mediator and parental 
outcome taken at other time points as well (e.g., total effect of RTI© on parent outcomes at 6 
months that are mediated by [CONTACT_640817]/or social resourcefulness at 3 months).  
      Aim 5: To assess th e relationship between self -management behavior and parent 
psychological and physical health outcomes, we will use correlational and regression analyses. 
The effect of RTI© on outcomes will be estimated after controlling for important covariates in 
the str uctural equation model (SEM). Also, we will study parental psychological and physical 
health outcomes and its association with sleep (or positive health practices), using the SEM 
framework. The SEM is a general, flexible, powerful, and comprehensive method ology for 
representing, estimating, and testing a network of relationships among variables of interest. By 
[CONTACT_640818], we will be able to develop a hypothetical model or path diagram that allows for 
specification of relationships and the directionality  of the relationships among the variables of 
interest. These exploratory models or path diagrams that are derived from this study will be a  
basis for further study/validation. In the model fitting, we will use the method of maximum 
likelihood estimation (M LE) for estimating parameters.  
      To account for any multiple comparisons, a Bonferroni -corrected, two -sided significance 
level will be applied to all analyses for all aims. Additionally, we expect some level of missing 
data at each time point. To adjus t for the missing data in all mixed -models analyses, we will 
apply pattern -mixture models to each model to ensure that missing data is adequately accounted 
for in each analysis. In contrast to a “completers only” approach, pattern -mixture models will 
provi de a consistent and asymptotically efficient estimate of the effect of intervention on the 
monthly rate of change in parent outcomes when data is missing not at random.  
Aim 6: We will analyze the technology -dependent children’s ER visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_640774] r [ADDRESS_857610] 
modifier.  
      Sensitivity analyses will also be applied to all mediation models described for the Primary 
Analysis to evaluate the assumption of sequential ignorability (no unmeasured confoun ders of 
the association between the mediator and each parent outcome). As described by [CONTACT_640819].,[ADDRESS_857611].  
 
There are few risks to participants . A potential emotional risk during the interview is that 
recalling information regarding their child’s course of illness and home management di fficulties 
may make some parents uncomfortable. The interviewer will be vi gilant to assess the parent’s 
discomfort. Parents  experiencing considerable discomfort will be asked if they wish to stop the 
interview and will be given supportive assistance by [CONTACT_640820].  The parent  will then be told 
to contact [CONTACT_640821] a resource sheet with the number of United 
Way First Call (211) to access on -call mental health professional services in their local area or 
Cuyahoga County 24 -Hour  Mental Health Crisis Information and R eferral Hotline (216 -623-
6888).  If any participant is noted to have a level of depressive symptoms  above the recognized  
clinical T score  of 55.1  (raw score ≥16 - mild depressive symptoms ) on the Patient -Reported 
Outcom es Measurement Information System ( PROMIS ) Short Form v 1.0 -Depression 8a  
measure , he/she will be told o f the findings and given instructions to contact [CONTACT_5657]/her primary 
health care provider and the resource sheet with mental health contact [CONTACT_640822]  (See Mental Health Resources Decision Tree) . Any parent expressing signs or symptoms 
of major depression (i. e., hopelessness and/or helplessness) in the enrollment interview, 
Resourcefulness Training appointment, telephone follow -up, journal writing, data collection 
appointments, booster sessions, or parents with a P ROMIS -Depression 8a score of ≥22  
(moderate to severe depressive symptoms) or a Depressive Cognitions Scale score of ≥7, will 
be assessed for imminent risk of suicide by [CONTACT_381748] t hey have had any thoughts of harming 
themselves in any way or perhaps killing themselves. If the answer to any portion of the 
question is “yes” the participant will be told of a concern for their safety and the necessity for the 
interviewer to contact [CONTACT_640823] [ADDRESS_857612]  and data collectors when needed. Also, 
physical risks  might involve fatigue du e to the length of time (about 45  -50 minutes) ne eded to 
answer the  study questions and about 1 hour for the Resourcefulness Training© intervention  and 
practice journal entry. There is a slight inconvenience for all participants will need to take 
scheduled ph one calls as per protocol, schedule time to m eet with data collectors, wear 
Actiwatch at specified times and mail them back to study office. The intervention group will 
experience slight inconvenience due to time for intervention session, time to write in semi -
structured journal 2 -3 minutes daily for 4 weeks and 1 week booster journals ([ADDRESS_857613] intervention).  Finally, there is a minimal risk to loss of confidentiality  with collection 
of data particularly with the collection of Personal Heal th Information regarding the technology -
dependent child . The consent form wil l specifically discuss these risks . 
There is a slight risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_640775]. The participant will be 
instructed at enrollment that if any redness o f the skin develops in the area where the watch is 
worn they are to remove it and contact [CONTACT_627552]. There is also a very rare  risk during hair 
sample collection of a minor scalp laceration (a cut) and  infection related to same.  
All participants are volunteers and non -participation and withdrawal from the study are 
alternatives to study participation. Parents  will be told that they may withdraw from the study at 
any time.  There are no risks to non -participation or withdrawal from the study.  The Project 
Director (at recruitment) and the data collectors (at enrollment) will explain that part icipation or 
non-participation  will have no effect on the type, quality, or nature of medical care that the 
technology -dependent child  receives, and that all resear ch data will be o btained by [CONTACT_640824] .    
 Writing abo ut the stress of caring for their  child in their journal might bring out  
uncomfortable feelings. Parents will be instructed that if they experience distress, they  may stop 
the journaling and contact [CONTACT_612698]. In addition, they will be  instructed to tell the 
research staff about these feelings during the weekly follow -up telephone calls. If needed, we 
will provide  emotional support and refer them  to mental health r esources such as the [ADDRESS_857614] informa tion and study ID will be destroy ed 5 years after completion of 
the study . Participants will also be told that individual responses will not be shared with others. 
Participant names will not be used in any reports of the study.  
All information obtained dur ing data collection will be kept confidential and will be disclosed 
only with the participant 's permission or as required by [CONTACT_640825] . If disclosure is made by [CONTACT_640826],  
the appropriate agencies such as the 24 Hour  Mobile Crisis Team or the Ohio Department of 
Job and Family Services (216 -696-KIDS) will  be notified as per study adverse event/ serious 
adverse event, abuse protocol. If a participant discloses domesti c abuse/violence to a member 
of the study team the study adverse event , serious adverse event, abuse  protocol will be 
implemented that includes giving the phone number to the Domestic Violence Hotline: [ADDRESS_857615] of the mother’s/father's choosing such as her/his home, public libr ary, place of 
employment, private place in a coffee shop or the Dahms Clinical Research Center. 
Privacy will be maintained as well in the procedures for identifying participants as 
described above. Participants will be mailed an introductory letter prior t o study staff 
making telephone contact.  We will respect their wishes related to the best way to 
maintain contact [CONTACT_116744] (phone, text, email).  
Facebook and Twitter will be used to post the IRB flyer about the study. A 
"Friend" request will be sent to par ent caregiver organizations who have members likely 
to meet inclusion criteria along with an introductory letter about our study and the 
request to post our recruitment flyer. The organization can make a decision to accept or 
reject the request to post our  study flyer. Potential participants reached through either 
Facebook or Twitter would then self -identify and voluntarily contact [CONTACT_640827]. When they contact [CONTACT_640828] -to-face data  
collection.  
 
Participants may receive some benefit from the stress reducing methods used in this 
study (Re sourcefulness Training, writing  in log ). The potential risk for emotional distress 
is minimal and reasonable given the potential benefit for reducing stress and improving 
a parent’s psychological and physical health outcomes and self -management behaviors 
(sleep, positive health practices). This study will benefit other families by [CONTACT_640829] -management behaviors when they are 
caring f or a technology -dependent child. It is hoped that parents who participate in the 
Resourcefulness Training arm of the study will feel more confident as they implement 
resourcefulness skills over the intervention period and will have a reduction in negative 
impact of caregiving over time. In addition, it is believed that the Resourcefulness 
Training intervention will enhance the care delivery by [CONTACT_640830][INVESTIGATOR_602].  
Possible causes for the participant to be withdrawn from the study include that the 
child with special medical t echnology has become too ill or has died. The participant 
may decide to withdraw from the study due to lack of interest to complete the remaining 
questionnaires at T2, T3, T4 , T5 or that she/he is not interested in continuing to 
complete the journal writing. If the participant indicates an intent to withdraw from the  
study, she/he will be invited to share reasons for desire t o withdraw from  study. 
Participants will not be followed after they have voluntarily withdrawn from the study 
unless they indicate that they wish to be contact[CONTACT_640831] -up 
studies.  If the child has the special medical technology remove d during the course of 
their parent’s participation in the study we will continue to conduct data collection but 
will note removal of technology in analysis.  
 
There is no reimbursement for parking and meals but an incentive will be given to 
participants for their time and inconvenience. Participants will be given a $[ADDRESS_857616] at 
each of 5  time points following completion and return of the questionnaires . The total 
payment will be $125  over the study time if they complete all portions (5  data collection 
points) of the study.  They will also receive a $[ADDRESS_857617] each of the 4 time points they 
need to return the Actiwatch and sleep history booklet to the study o ffice. The total 
payment for returning these items each time (4 time points) is $20.  
 
Data and safety monitoring will be conducted to determine if data collection should be 
altered or stopped. Every [ADDRESS_857618]. Toly, the principal 
inves tigator will make the decision related to altering the study in collaboration with the 
committee if more than two mothers/fathers experience significant discomfort or distress 
that required a referral to United Way First Call.  
 
Data and safety monitoring will be conducted to determine if data collection should be 
altered or stopped. Every [ADDRESS_857619] occurred during the study. The committee members are not part of the 
research team . This committee will review data on this study regarding 1) study safety, 
including auditing selected cases for compliance with IRB requirements, conformance 
with informed consent requirements, verification of source documents , and investigator 
compliance; 2) minimizing research -associated risk; and 3) protecting the confidentiality 
of participant data. In addition, it will review (1) all causes of mortality and (2) issues 
with participation. The rate of recruitment refusal (pe rcent and reasons) and subject 
attrition (percent and reasons) will be tracked and reported at these reviews. Differential 
attrition from the intervention and control arms also will be monitored. Written reports 
will be developed and sub mitted to the commi ttee by [CONTACT_640832], [CONTACT_640839], the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_640776]/fathers experience significant discomfort or  
distress that required a referral to Un ited Way First Call.   [CONTACT_640839] will be responsible to 
submit written reports to any funding agency within [ADDRESS_857620]. Toly   within 3 business days after they are identified. If there are 
recommendations made by [CONTACT_4484], the action plan for response or notice of any 
actions taken by [CONTACT_640833] 2 weeks.

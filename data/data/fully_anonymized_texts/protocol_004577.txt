“active ingredients” of chaplaincy spi[INVESTIGATOR_60408], and a subsequent lack of standardization and 
best -practice guidelines informing chaplain training and chaplain spi[INVESTIGATOR_800424]. CCSH ® 
(Compassion -Centered Spi[INVESTIGATOR_800423] ) is a se cularized compassion meditation program 
adapted from the Tibetan Buddhist mind training ( lojong ) tradition, and it may be an ideal 
addendum to both chaplain training programs and to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_800425] 100,000 patients each year.  
Importance of integrative treatment for depression and quality of life (QOL) in cancer.  In 
2016, more than 15.[ADDRESS_1104510] significantly poorer mental health2 and health -related QOL3 than people 
without cancer. At one year after diagnosis, the prevalence of depression in cancer survivors is estimated to range between 8 -24% compared to the 4 -7% in the general population.
4-6 The 
rates of depression among cancer patients actively undergoing treatment is higher, closer to 
32%,7-9 and an astounding 73% of cancer patients with depression do not receive any treatment 
for this very debilitating symptom.[ADDRESS_1104511] mortality, independent of, and sometimes better than,11 clinical variables of 
disease.12,13 Effective evidence- based interventions to improve psychosocial well -being and 
long -term QOL for cancer survivors are imperative to advancing cancer care.14-16   
Hematopoietic stem cell tr ansplant (HSCT) is among the most physically and mentally 
arduous cancer treatments. Due to chemotherapy -induced toxicity and early post -transplant 
medical complications, HSCT patients experience a multitude of acute physical symptoms that 
negatively impac t their QOL and psychosocial well- being.17-19 This array of symptoms occurs  
concomitant with requisite physical isolation, as the average hospi[INVESTIGATOR_800426] 2-3 weeks.20 While rates of emotional distress and physical limitations are acutely elevated in 
the 100 days following transplant,21,22 the majority of survivors don’t regain high levels of

inhibitor (sertraline) reduced engraftment time for patients with depression and/or anxiety.[ADDRESS_1104513] may reduce depression and improv e QOL, which is so critical for well- being and survival.  
Compassion meditation can be an eminently feasible adjunctive intervention for depression 
and QOL.  The Society for Integrative Oncology highly recommends (grade A) meditation as an 
adjunctive intervention for anxiety and depression and for improving QOL for patients during 
and after cancer treatment.33,[ADDRESS_1104514] 
research attention and appear to be particularly promising, with a 0.44 ( Hedges’ g) effect on 
symptoms of depression for adult cancer patients and survivors, estimated from 22 randomized controlled trials (n = 1, 403).
[ADDRESS_1104515] whether C CSH (Compassion -Centered 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_800423])  a secular  meditation program that includes mindfulness and compassion 
practices, can be delivered at the bedside by [CONTACT_800443]. Previous work from our group and others has found that CCSH is beneficial: CCSH increases 
hope
[ADDRESS_1104516] cancer survivors, CCSH reduced 
depression and psychological stress associated with the fear of cancer recurrence.37,38  
Scientific Premise:  CCSH is a secularized, research -based mindfulness and compassion 
meditation program designed to expand and strengthen compassion for self and others. Practices include training in attentional stability and increased emotional awareness, as well as 
targeted ref lections to appreciate one’s relationship with self and others. By [CONTACT_800444], controlling debilitating ruminative thoughts, and cultivating personal resiliency and an 
inclusive and more accurate understanding of others, CCSH reduces the sympatheti c response 
to psychosocial stress and thus reduces beta -adrenergic induction of inflammatory 
processing.
43,[ADDRESS_1104517] a pre -
implementation study to evaluate the feasibility  of chaplain- delivered CCSH for patients 
receiving stem cell transplantation. Systematic investigation of the fidelity of progra m 
implementation (FOI) of chaplain -delivered CCSH is required to establish methodological rigor. 
1) Incorporating evidence -based interventions requires rigorous evaluation of whether the 
Protocol Title:   A feasibility study of Chaplain -delivered compassion meditation for patients 
receiving stem cell transplantation.  
 
 
Page 7 of 20   Version: VERSION 1 AND 10/21/2021  
IRB Form SOCIOB 03152021  intervention is being implemented as intended,  and whether its implem entation varies 
depending on individual - or system -level factors . 2) Assessing FOI of chaplain -delivered CCSH 
will be essential for program improvement and refinement. 3) Quantifying FOI will be necessary 
for future studies evaluating the impact of CCSH on patient outcomes, as fidelity to intervention 
delivery  directly informs conclusions that can be made about the effectiveness of the 
intervention  [i.e., Does chaplain- delivered CCSH  reduce depression?] . In general, counseling 
programs delivered with high fidelity report better outcomes than those of programs implemented with lower fidelity.
45 4) Quantifying FOI will be imperative for any future 
mechanistic study aiming to identify the core components, or “active ingredients”, of CCSH that 
improve outcomes ( i.e. How does chaplain- delivered CCSH  reduce depression? ). 
4. Study Endpoints  
The primary endpoints for this feasibility study are measuring fidelity to intervention delivery . 
As a secondary outcome, we will measure number of sessions completed. We will use an 
iterative theoretical framework fo r FOI proposed for mindfulness and yoga interventions46 to 
refine the fidelity coding manual.  
 
5. Study Intervention/ Design   
This will be an open -pi[INVESTIGATOR_800422] -delivered CCSH to examine chaplain fidelity to CCSH.  
 6. Procedures Involved  
Chaplains will be asked to volunteer to participate and be consented  according to standard IRB -
approved protocols. We will enroll a convenience sample of [ADDRESS_1104518] already 
completed the formal CCSH educational course . 
 
Jennifer  (PI) will work with collaborators  and CCSH experts to identify the core components of 
chaplain -delivered CCSH and to develop an objective fidelity -coding manual that we will use to 
evaluate the fidelity of chaplain -delivered CCSH for patients during HSCT.  We will utilize FOI 
theoretical frameworks  to identify structural components (the content that is delivered) and 
process components (the manner in which chaplains implement content).47  
 1. Chaplains will deliver between four and eight 30 -minute sessions ( 2-4/week) of CCSH to up to 
[ADDRESS_1104519]. CCSH 
sessions will be delivered in the patient’s room. The number of sessions between four and eight 
will be determined based on patient availability, interest, and feasibility. Based on the interviews with staff, we will work within the cancer unit’s work flow to minimize any 
interference with medical care. Before  the chaplain completes each session, we will administer 
the (<1 min) NCNN Distress Thermometer, a single -item distress thermometer that compares 
favorably with longer measures used to screen for distress.  
 2. Chaplains will complete a post -visit fidelity checklist after each session to report which of the 
key intervention activities were completed.

receiving stem cell transplantation.  
 
 
Page 8 of 20   Version: VERSION 1 AND 10/21/[ADDRESS_1104520] audio recordings of all CCSH sessions. 
All sessions will be transcribed verbatim, and two CCSH experts will independently evaluate the 
extent to which chaplain residents deliver CCSH with fidelity in a random subset of 50% of the 
sessions.  The audio transcripts will be secured on a password -protected Emory server for one 
year after transcription and will then be destroyed.  
 
4. After the chaplain completes each session, we will administer the (<1 min) NCNN Distress 
Thermometer, a single -item distress thermometer that compares favorably with lo nger 
measures used to screen for distress. We will also administer the (4 min)  Scottish Patient 
Reported Outcome Measure (PROM)48. The PROM is an 18 -item Likert -scale that assesses how 
a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_800427] C are visit both during the consult and after it. 
Here, we will use the subscale that asks patients how they felt after the chaplain’s visit (5 items).
 
 
There will be no need for deception during the study.   CCSH: Chaplain -delivered CCSH (description summarized and abridged from 109 -page  
intervention manual):  
STAGE 1 Prepare the Care Responder (CR): Before engaging with the Care seeker (CS), if at all possible, the CR sets aside time to attune to their own motivation, attentional stability, and emotional state, using compassion training practice ( CCSH) to do the following:  
- Connect with a personally nurturing moment  
- Stabilize attention/ ground in the body/ witness the nature of mental experience  
- Connect with the changing nature of suffering  
- Connect with the determination to emerge from internal sources of suffering  
- See others as the same as myself, fundamen tally, in their desire to be free from distress or 
harm  
- Attune to the reality of interdependence and the affective response of gratitude  
- Generate warm- hearted attitude/altruistic love and the intent to share this inclusively  
- Deepen the intent to he lp all others be well and free from distress and discomfort  
-  Set the intention to stay mindful  
STAGE 2 Attune to Relationship with CS: Attune to self, attune to other, and discern sources of 
distress.  
- Communicate the role of the CR through the introduction, right away, so there is not 
confusion about the purpose of the consultation  
- Recall that caring for physical needs/immediate needs is sometimes primary  
- Identify, if any, faith tradition or belief system  
- Gauge trust, while also building trust  
- Sustain empathic balance  
- Sustain humility  
- Discern sources of distress: Examples: ( CCSH module VI) Feeling unheard, disrespected, 
disconnected, or disparaged; ( CCSH module F) Overwhelming anxiety or fear (open to 
connection); ( CCSH module I) Overwhelm ing anxiety or fear (resistant to connection); ( CCSH

III-a) Overly harsh self -judgment or self -criticism; toxic shame; ( CCSH module III- b) Exaggerated 
expectations of being free from difficult emotions; ( CCSH module III- c) Unrealistic expectations 
of predicting or controlling outcomes; ( CCSH module I II-d) Suffering is due to automatic or 
habitual mental interpretations of events; ( CCSH module IV) Harsh blame or objectification of 
others V -a Feelings of isolation or disconnection, abandonment; ( CCSH module V -b) Forgotten 
agency to hold another (or a gr oup of others) with tenderness; ( CCSH module VI) Disconnection 
from a sense of meaning or purpose in life  
STAGE 3 Access Compassion: Seeks to build on the CS’s own capacity to find and promote warm- heartedness, resilience, and wellbeing. The fundamental outcome of the Access 
Compassion stage is that the CS experiences heightened warmheartedness (tenderness, affection) – for self, or for others –  which allows them to generate and sustain compassion in 
the face of difficult situations, struggles, and suffering.  
There are several types of cultivation that are constructive, and they are related to the foundational practice and the 6 modules of CCSH as follows, and as illustrated in the simplified 
diagram above.   NURTURING MOMENT  
Foundational Practice: Resting in a Moment of Nurturance  GROUNDING I. Stabilizing Attention / Clarifying Attention

III. Cultivating Self -Compassion  
IV. De velopi[INVESTIGATOR_800428]  
V. Attuning to Interdependence; Cultivating Gratitude and Affection  
VI. Empathetic Concern and Engaged Compassion STAGE [ADDRESS_1104521] the Care Seeker: As we prepare to bring closure to the visit,  we are continuing 
to utilize the skills of attunement to the relationship in Stage 3. The CR is attuning to the desire to provide some relief from suffering for the CS while also  sustaining the insight that the CS has 
many internal resources which they may have touched on together during the visit. The CR can also attune to the aspi[INVESTIGATOR_800429]. We aspi[INVESTIGATOR_800430] “entrus t” the CS with the tools they have begun to access during the 
conversation. By [CONTACT_11384], we mean that we give over agency to the CS to enact their own process of accessing compassion and wellbeing.

The study participants who are patients  will be experienc ing a medical procedure that will be 
stressful in nature, but the research study is not inherently stressful.  On the contrary, the ultimate goal of this program of research is  to alleviate some of the stress the patients are 
experiencing.  
 
7. Study Timelines

IRB Form SOCIOB 03152021  10.  Local Number of Participants  
This is not a mul ti-site study.  
 
We will enroll a convenience sample of 6 -8 chaplains . The 2018 entering class of chaplain 
residents is 47% male, and 88% non -white.  We expect to enroll 50% women, and 50% non -
white chaplains.   
Chaplains will deliver eight 30 -minute sessions (4/week) of CCSH up to [ADDRESS_1104526] patients49, we anticipate that 37% of the 
patients will be men, and 44% will be non- white.  
 
11. Recruitment Methods  
 
Chaplains will be asked to volunteer to participate via an in -person presentation of the research 
aims and be consented according to standard IRB -approved protocols. We will enroll a 
convenience sample of [ADDRESS_1104527] will be recruited by [CONTACT_800445].  Potential participants will be identified via:  
1. Collaboration with clinic staff  – Our study team will receive an email from the clinic staff each 
time a new pa tient is identified. We will use the patients’ electronic medical record prior to 
their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_800431]. Identifiers will be recorded to track contact. Identifiers include: patient name, 
email, address, and phone number. The study team will email new patients prior to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18506] a description of the study, the consent form, and a link to provide 
indication of interest and consent via Qualtrics.   
2. In -person recruitment by [CONTACT_5051].  
Patient eligibility will be determined by [CONTACT_800446]. Cognitive capacity will be determined if the person is confused, disoriented, unable 
to make a decision, unable to answ er questions, or based on information obtained from family 
or other caregivers.  
 
12. Withdrawal of Participants  
 
Protocol Title:   A feasibility study of Chaplain -delivered compassion meditation for patients 
receiving stem cell transplantation.  
 
 
Page 12 of 20   Version: VERSION 1 AND 10/21/2021  
IRB Form SOCIOB 03152021  The researchers will stop participation without participant consent if:  
• They believe it is in the patient’s  best interest.  
• The patient  object s to any future changes that may be made in the study plan.  
• The patient is no longer able or willing to receive CCSH.  
 
Participants are free to withdraw from the research at any time. If a participant requests withdrawal, the study team will request permission to use the acquired data and ask the reason 
for withdrawal.    
13. Risk to Participants  
Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is among the most physically and mentally arduous 
cancer treatments  and patients experience a multitude of acute physical symptoms that 
negatively impact their QOL and psychosocial well- being.
17-[ADDRESS_1104528] any reason to 
believe that CCSH will increase patients’ physical, psychological, social, legal, or  economic risks. 
Patients may become upset during t he CCSH interventions due to the nature of their treatment, 
diagnosis, and any emotional discomfort associated with thinking about their disease. However, 
CCSH has been widely used in usual care in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34092] 12 months and the chaplains are 
trained i n delivering this type of ‘talking therapy’. CCSH is widely associated with low levels of 
distress.  
 
Risks to confidentiality: The questionnaires that subjects will fill out as part of this study will 
contain personal information, and participants will hav e private pi[INVESTIGATOR_800432]. We 
acknowledge that it could be embarrassing if this information were to become public or fall into the hands of someone not associated with the study. We will take the following steps to 
prevent this from happening : All information obtained from patients  will be kept strictly 
confidential and will be de -identified and stored by a randomly assigned study number, such 
that these data will be anonymous at all times during data entry and analysis. The key used to link the study number with subject identification will be stored in a password protected, secure 
database accessible only to study researchers. The key will only be used in the case of study 
personnel needing to identify a subject and not for data analysis. In additi on, all data, including 
personal identifiers ( i.e., name, address, email contact [CONTACT_8972]), will be maintained in secure 
password -protected electronic files stored on a secure computer system that can only be 
accessed by [CONTACT_419893]. Emory Spi[INVESTIGATOR_800433] (other than members of the research team) will not have access to the key 
nor will they receive any study data.  
 
 
14. Potential Benefits to Participants  
Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is  associated with an array of negative symptoms 
that affect long -term  QOL, and these symptoms occur during a  requisite period of 
Protocol Title:   A feasibility study of Chaplain -delivered compassion meditation for patients 
receiving stem cell transplantation.  
 
 
Page 13 of 20   Version: VERSION 1 AND 10/21/[ADDRESS_1104529] may reduce 
depression and improve QOL, which is so critical for well- being and survival.  
Previous research from our group found that a  single session of chaplain -delivered CCSH 
reduced depression and anxiety  among hospi[INVESTIGATOR_800434] (paper in progress).  Patients in 
this study may directly benefit from CCSH. Moreover, this feasibility study will establish the 
manualized protocol and intervention delivery process that can be further evaluated in future 
research.  
15. Compensation to Participants  
There is no financial compensation for participation.  
 
16. Data Analysis, Management  and Confidentiality  
 
Statistical analysis   
 Measuring and evaluating r etention:  Based on a large randomized trial of exercise and stress 
management programs for patients receiving blood and marrow transplant
50, we expect that:  
• Benchmark 1 : 29 (97%) patients enrolled in the study will complete at least one 
session of chaplain- delivered CCSH, based on the fact that 3% of patien ts 
enrolled in the larger trial did not receive an intervention).  
• Benchmark 2 : We will lose [ADDRESS_1104530] 
complete data from 23 patients (78.8%), based on the Day 100 completion percentage from the trial cited above (78.8%) . 
We believe this is a conservative estimate because the 78.8% Day [ADDRESS_1104531] our final time point for this aim.  
  
 
 
Measuring and evaluating adherence:  While chaplains will intend to deliver [ADDRESS_1104532], we may find that patients are too sick to receive all 8 sessions or that they drop 
out of the study prior to the completion of all 8. We may also find that chaplains do not deliver the intervention with fidelity during all 8 sessions. Adherence will be evaluated as the percent 
of sessions completed by [CONTACT_800447] “low” (< 70%), “moderate” (70 -80%) 
and “high” (> 80%) adherence.  
• Benchmark 1 : We expect that all chaplain r esidents will achieve high levels of 
adherence.  
• Benchmark 2 : We expect that [ADDRESS_1104533] (see 
retention benchmarks below), completing at least 75% (6 out of 8) C CSH 
sessions.

implemented by [CONTACT_800448] “low” (< 70%), “moderate” (70 -80%) and “high” 
(> 80%) accuracy.  
 
2) Dosage : quantified as the amount (percentage) of CBCT that patients receive. We will 
also characterize the modal number of sessions received as well as the range  of sessions 
completed by [CONTACT_16983]. From the range, we will create categories of “low”, “medium”, and “high” dosage that we will use as categorical groups in future studies . 
 
3) Quality : extent to which the chaplain delivered the content as intended. W e will 
generate average competency ratings for each chaplain as well as overall average quality ratings.  
 
4) Responsiveness: the extent to which patients were engaged in each session, 
operationalized as “maximally,” “moderately”, or “minimally” enthusiast ic and attentive during 
each. We will quantify the average patient engagement for all sessions, as well as the average responsiveness for each session ( i.e., 1
st – 8th).   
 
In addition, I will quantify Accuracy, Dosage, and Responsiveness from chaplain che cklists that 
chaplains complete after each session.  
• Benchmark 1 : We will be able to quantify FOI for all chaplain sessions and generate an 
average FOI for each chaplain  
• Benchmark 2 : We expect all chaplains will deliver C CSH with high levels of fidelity.  
 Audio files will be stored for one year after transcription is complete. All other data will be stored for at least [ADDRESS_1104534] access to the data. The PI (Mascaro) will be 
responsible for storage and maintenance and destruction of the data.  
  17. Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Participants  
We do not believe the research involves more than minimal risk to participants. We will closely monitor all subjects’ responses and record conventional serious adverse events (SAEs) and 
unexpected and expected adverse events (AEs). For the purposes of study reporting, an SAE is any of the following events: 1. Death within 30 days of CCSH, 2. Suicidal ideation at any time during the study. When any of these events occur, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_800435]:   A feasibility study of Chaplain -delivered compassion meditation for patients 
receiving stem cell transplantation.

requirements  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_800436] 3 independent scientists who are not related to the study who will serve on the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) for the conduct of this study. Prior to 
recruitment , the DSMC will review the protocol and monitoring plans. Following this, the DSMC 
will mainly monitor for adequate recruitment milestones and for the occurrence of adverse 
events related to participation in the study.  
 
Safety Review Plan Study progress an d safety will be reviewed monthly and more frequently if 
needed. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_800437], including patient recruitment, retention/attrition, 
and AEs to the DSMC semi -annually. On an annual basis the DSMC will review pertinent aspects 
of the st udy to assess subject safety, compliance with the protocol, data collection, and risk -
benefit ratio. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_800438] (1) a list and summary of 
AEs; (2) whether AE rates are consistent with pre -study assumptions; (3) reason for dropouts 
from the study; (4) whether all participants met entry criteria; (5) whether continuation of the 
study is justified on the basis of that additional data are needed to accomplish the aims of the study; and (6) conditions whereby [CONTACT_72771]. This report will be sent to the DSMC, Emory’s IRB, and to the funder (NIH NCCIH).  
 This study will be stopped prior to its completion if: (1) the intervention is associated with adverse effects that call into question th e safety of the intervention; (2) difficulty in study 
recruitment or retention that will significantly impact the ability to evaluate the study 
endpoints; (3) any new information becomes available during the trial that necessitates 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356]; or ( 4) other situations occur that might warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356].  
  18. Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interest of Participants  
Emory will keep any research records private to the extent that this is required by [CONTACT_2371].  
Whenever possible, a study number, rathe r than your name, will be used on study records.  
Your name [CONTACT_800453].  
Study records can be opened by [CONTACT_508366].  They also may be provided in response to a 
subpoena or a request for the production of documents.  
 
19. Economic Burden to Participants  
Study participants will not incur or be responsible for costs because of participation in this 
research.  
  20. Informed Consent

protocols. To avoid any sense of coercion, all chaplains will be contact[CONTACT_800449].  
 
For patients: To avoid any sense of coercion of the potential participant by [CONTACT_102]’s physician, an investigator/research assistant will be the recruiter for the study. The physician or 
nurses may refe r a patient who satisfies the inclusion criteria to the recruiter, but he or she will 
not be the recruiter for the study. All recruited patients engage in a detailed informed consent 
before the study, prior to becoming a  participant.  
 
To minimize burden on the patients and to reduce exposure to study staff, we will conduct 
informed consent online using a waiver of documented consent.   
 
  
 
Non -English -Speaking Participants   
 
N/A: all participants will be English -speaking because CCSH is  delivered in English.  
 
Participants who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers)   
 N/A: we are not recruiting non -adults  
 
Cognitively Impaired Adults   
Patient ability to consent will be determined by [CONTACT_800450]. Cognitive capacity will be determined if the person is confused, disoriented, unable to make a decision, unable to answer questions, or based on i nformation obtained from 
family or other caregivers.   Adults Unable to Consent   
N/A: we will not obtain assent.  
 
Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process (consent will not be obtained, required information 
will not be disclosed, or the research involves d eception)  
N/A: we will not use a waiver or alteration of the consent process.

Page 17 of 20   Version: VERSION 1 AND 10/21/[ADDRESS_1104536] from November  2021 through July 2022.  
To recruit patients for  this study , we will engage with referring physicians  in Emory’s Bone 
Marrow and Stem Cell Transplant Center. We will arrange to give a presentation at the Emory 
Huddle and/or the center’s grand rounds so that providers and staff are familiar with the study.  
Lost to follow -up: The funder (NCCIH) considers lost to follow -up as a research subject who was 
participating in the study at a certain point in time and subsequently missed two consecutive 
study visits and is unresponsive to study contact [CONTACT_800451].  
We base our calcula tions on a large randomized trial of exercise and stress management 
programs for patients receiving blood and marrow transplant50, in which the [ADDRESS_1104537] -to-
follow -up was 30.8%. Of 711 consented and randomized, the researchers received final surveys 
from 492 patients (69.2%): 5 (0.7%) did not undergo HCT, 21 (3.0%) did not receive the intervention, 37 (5.2%) died before Day 100, and 48 (6.8%) died between Day [ADDRESS_1104538] that 97% patients enrolled in the study will complete at least one session of CCSH (based on the fact that 3% of patients enrolled in the larger trial withdrew 
prior to receiving an intervention). Based on the Day 100 completion percentage from that trial (78.8%), we expect that we will have complete data from 78.8% of enrolled patients. However, this is a conservative estimate, given that the 78.8% Day [ADDRESS_1104539] our final time point for this aim.

1. Background 
 
Smoking causes 30%  of all cancers and 80% of mortality from head and neck and lung cancer.1,[ADDRESS_362190] 
of 25% of the 12 million cancer survivors in the US are smokers.3 Continued tobacco use among cancer 
survivors reduces the effectiveness of cancer treatments and is associated with increased overall and cancer -specific mortality , increased risk for recurrence and second primary cancers , and diminished quality 
of life after treatment .
4–10 The routine assessment of tobacco use and the provision of tobacco use 
treatment  (TUT)  are recommended by [CONTACT_296592].11,12 Due to 
the competing demands of complex cancer care, however, cancer centers are challenged with 
implementing strategies  that both assess tobacco use and link tobacco users with TUT services.  Whereas 
assessment of tobacco use may be common in oncology settings, improved cessation outcomes will not be realized if patients are not offered counseling and TUT support .
13 TUT for cancer patients may be improved 
substantially with solutions to accurately identify tobacco use, provide patient -centered  treatment support, 
and minimize the burden on  clinical staff.   
 
The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of implementing multi- level strateg ies to improve 
the access and utilization of TUT for cancer patients. Our strat egies  includes 1) offering provider and 
clinical staff training on current best practices, 2) developi[INVESTIGATOR_296587], and 3) offering 
patients the choice of a dedicated technology -based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program in 
addition to existing evidence- based TUT programs (i.e.,  the [LOCATION_012] Quitline; and Area Health Education 
Center [AHEC]14).  The ultimate goal of this research is to provide new knowledge to facilitate the 
widespread adoption, implementation, and dissemination and sustained utilization of evidence- based 
tobacco use treatments in cancer care settings.  
 
This protocol focuses on the patient -level trial only (Strateg y 3).   
 
A separate protocol was developed for  the provider -level implementation strategies ( Strategies 1 and 2 ; 
see IRB201800135 ).  
 
The full protocol was approved by [CONTACT_296593] (Protocol # OCR1729; 01/26 /2018).  
 
2. Study Description  
 
There is evidence that cancer patients benefit from dedicated services to help them quit smoking.15 Our 
evidence- based mobile phone CBT (mCBT) intervention will capi[INVESTIGATOR_296588].16  We will offer patients at two UF 
Health Cancer  Center (UFHCC) clinics 3 TUT options (i.e., AHEC, Quitline, or mCBT).  Assignment to TUT 
options will be based on patient preferences. Patients who choose AHEC/Quitline will be referred by a 
nurse using Epic. Those choosing mCBT will participate in a 12- week tobacco treatment program via their 
smartphone. Only p articipants with a smartphone or data plan will be eligible to participate in mCTB; the 
research assistant will confirm verbally at enrollment . Participants  in mCBT will use Vidyo , a HIPAA -
compliant video- conferencing platform, on their smartphone to complete the treatment program. 
Participants  will meet with a certified tobacco treatment specialist (CTTS) on Vidyo  for [ADDRESS_362191] breath carbon monoxide 
(CO) samples during weeks 1, [ADDRESS_362192] this 
sample, participants will blow  into a CO monitor (iCOTM  Smokelyzer®) that attaches to their smartphone. 
In addition, participants  in AHEC/Quitline/mCBTmay provide a saliva swab  at the end of the study (week 
12), using a saliva sample kit we provide by [CONTACT_2319], to test for cotinine level s. 
 
3. Research Plan  
Study Design:  This study uses a  mixed methods approach and will inform the design of a pragmatic clinical 
trial to improve the delivery of tobacco use treatment services to cancer patients . 
 
Study Setting:  The pi[INVESTIGATOR_296589] , Ear, Nose & Throat 
(ENT) , and Radiation Oncology  clinics . Smoking is the leading cause of head and neck cancers, and 
almost one- third of patients continue to smoke after their head and neck cancer diagnosis, making this a 
priority population for intervention.   
 
Population:  UF Health cancer patients ≥18 yrs old who are current smokers  and smartphone users ; for 
mCBT, we will also ensure CO breath sample >5 parts per million (ppm ). Patients with unstable medical or 
psychiatric illness or use disorder for illicit drugs will be excluded.   
 
Procedures : Patients who are current smokers will be introduced to a research assistant (RA) by [CONTACT_296594] a clinical relationship with the patient. Following screening and brief counseling by [CONTACT_13917], 
the RA will offer eligible patients the 3 TUT options (i.e., AHEC, Quitline, or mCBT ) and will use the 
“Choose to Quit” flyer to facilitate TUT choice. Three versions of the flyer exist to avoid order bias . Only 
smartphone users will be eligible to enroll in mCBT. If a patient is  interest ed in TUT and the research study, 
the RA will describe the study in detail (based on their TUT selection) and obtain written informed consent.  
If patients are interested  in the study  but do not want to part icipate  at the moment, the RA will use the back 
of the flyer to obtain the patient’s consent to re -contact. If patients  are interested in TUT but not int erested 
in the research study , the RA will complete a referral request form to enroll the patient in AHEC/Quitline  if 
desired. The RA will give this form to the patient’s clinician or nurse to initiate the referral in EPIC. The RA will complete a referral request form for all patients interested in AHEC/Quitline.   
 
Patients  who are interested in the study will have the option to choose  a paper -based or electronic 
informed consent (eIC) method.  Prior to consenting, the RA will ask for the patient’s  preferred method.  If 
the eIC method is selected, paper -based consent  forms will be available if partially throughout the eIC 
process a patient  changes his/her mind and prefers the paper -based method instead.  Patients will be 
given the opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and to ask questions prior to signing the  
paper -based or eIC form .  A copy of the  written informed consent  will be provided to patients; P atients who 
choose the eIC method can select to receive a copy via email.   
 
After  obtaining informed consent, the RA will administer the Patient Exit Interview (PEI)  in REDCap  and 
arrange a follow -up phone interview. Patients who choose AHEC/Quitline will be referred by a nurse using 
Epic. Those choosing mCBT will be trained on the use of Vidyo  and the iCOTM Smokelyzer®  by [CONTACT_296595] -up will be arranged with a CTTS counselor.  
 
Consent to Re-Contact  
[CONTACT_296596] -up with patients via telephone who gave consent to re -contact.  The RA will briefly 
describe the study  and the three TUT options, and ask patients if they  are interested  in participating .  The 
RA will email interested patients a link to the eIC  form (based on their TUT selection)  and thoroughly 
review  the form  with the patient. Patients  will give consent remotely by [CONTACT_296597] .  After receiving the signed eIC, the RA will administer the PEI  over the telephone and arrange a 
follow -up phone interview.  Participants  who choose mCBT will receive the iCOTM Smokel yzer®  via mail 
with instructions on how to use the CO Monitor and how to download and use the Vidyo  app. A 2- week 
supply of  nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)  will also be provided to  participants  interested in NRT (see 
next section for NRT details).  
 
mCBT  
Participants in mCBT will meet with a trained certified tobacco treatment counselor on Vidyo  for 30 
minutes, once a week, for 6  week s. The counselor will cover topi[INVESTIGATOR_296590], withdrawal, 
dealing with triggers, overcoming cravings, and relapse prevention. At enrollment, we will offer mCBT 
participants —if interested —a 2- week supply  of nicotine replacement therapy  (NRT). The 2 -week supply of 
NRT is consistent with what is offered to participants at AHEC and the Quitline. Participants who s moke 
less than 10 cigarettes per day will receive 14 mg of NRT, and those who smoke more than 10 cigarettes 
per day will receive 21 mg of NRT. Medical clearance from the provider will be obtained prior to NRT 
administration. At the end of the study (week 12), participants (all participants in mCBT and a random 
sample of patients referred to AHEC/Quitline) will complete the follow -up telephone interview .  At the end of 
the study, participants (AHEC/Quitline & mCBT)  may also provide a saliva sample  by [CONTACT_296598] ; this process will be remotely monitored via Vi dyo for participants in mCBT and 
participants in AHEC/Quitline will be encouraged to contact [CONTACT_296599].  
 
Evaluation Procedur es:  
 
i. Patient Exit Interviews (PEIs): To assess provider adherence to TUT guidelines, the RAs will conduct 
PEIs after recruitment with all smokers  at checkout (regardless of TUT choice). The RA will use an 
iPAD to administer the PEI in REDCap . The PEI is a  brief patient -reported assessment of provider 
delivery of counseling.17 A PEI index score (0 -10) is the sum of intervention steps each patient reports 
that the provider implemented. All socio- demographics (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity, rural/urban 
residence) will be obtained at intake using questions from the PhenX toolkit;[ADDRESS_362193] -7-day point prevalence of cigarette 
smoking, number of cigarettes/day, cigarette type, age of onset19 and cancer diagnosis experiences.  
 
ii. Telephone Survey:  Patients who participate in mCBT (n=50), and a random sample of patients 
referred to AHEC/Quitline (n=25/each), will complete a telephone survey at week  12 that includes: (1) 
Treatment Acceptability Questionnaire  (TAQ), 16 -items/7 -point Likert scales assessing treatment 
acceptability (i.e., helpfulness in reducing smoking, and thoughts and feelings related to the 
treatment).  Questions will relate to barriers/facilitators of TUT, and open -ended questions assessing 
suggestions for improvement. (2) Quality o f Life : 26-item cross- culturally valid WHO Quality of Life-
BREF,20 and (3) prolonged abstinence (i.e., sustained abstinence after an initial period in which 
smoking is not counted as a failure) and past -7-day point prevalence of cigarette smoking.19 A $20 
incentive will be offered at completion.   
 
iii. CO Monitor (mCBT only):  Abstinence point prevalence will be defined as CO sample ≤[ADDRESS_362194] 7 days.  Abstinence will be assessed at weeks 1, 6 & 12.  Missing 
data will be counted as positive for smoking.[ADDRESS_362195] for reduction in smoking 
over the 3 time points.  
 
iv. Cotinine level measurement (AHEC, Quitline, & mCBT participants):  At week 12, participants  may be 
asked to provide a saliva swab using a  saliva sample kit we provide . Participants will mail the swab 
in a prepaid envelope to the lab directly. The lab will send the test results to the study team at UF. We 
will use the test result to measure participants’ cotinine level s. 
 
Analysis Plan : All data collected will be entered in a REDCap  database. The primary analysis will be the 
estimation of rates/means, with 95% CIs. To demonstrate the feasibility of the 3 implementation strategies, 
we will mea sure reach as the number of smokers visiting the 2 clinics who are referred to any TUT (i.e., 
AHEC/Quitline/mCBT) divided by [CONTACT_296600]. For each TUT, we will 
calculate enrollment  as the total number of smokers who enr oll in a given treatment divided by [CONTACT_296601]; we will compare the rates of patients selecting into each of the 3 TUT programs. We will assess TUT completion as the number of enrolled smokers who complete the program. 
We will als o evaluate acceptability  using TAQ. As secondary outcomes, we will measure prolonged 
abstinence at week  12 and the change (baseline to week  12) in past -7-day point prevalence (all programs), 
as well as CO -verified abstinence at week s 6 &12 (mCBT only). CO levels will also be modeled across time 
(week s 1, 6, 12) to assess for reductions over time via linear mixed models.  
 
Sample Size Justification:  Sample sizes were chosen to obtain sufficiently precise estimates of outcomes 
to demonstrate f easibility and to provide estimates to power a future R01.[ADDRESS_362196] -trial initiation or sooner if 50 
smokers enroll in mCBT. We estimate 14 smokers /week  visit the 2 clinics (source:  i2b2); thus , we are 
confident that, using the opt -out approach to TUT referral,13 an average of 2 patients/ week  will choose 
mCBT  and ≥2 patients/ week  will choose AHEC/Quitline . For reach , 14 smokers/ week  x 25 week s=350 
leads to a 95%CI whose largest width=0.10 if the observed rate=0.50; any other rate would lead to more 
precision. If only ½ of 350 enroll in TUT, in obtaining rates of patient choices for the 3 TUT options, our 
maximum 95%CI width=0.15. Specific to the outcomes among the 50 in mCBT, our maximum 95%CI width 
for rates on completion/abstinence=0.28. We do not suspect abstinence rates to be as high as 0.50, in 
which case we will have more preci sion (95%CI =0.09, 0.31) when the rate=0.20. We expect 175 to enroll 
in any TUT by [CONTACT_5639] (when 50 enroll in mCBT).  We will thus have 125 in the other 2 groups 
(AHEC/Quitline). We will randomly sample 25 from each of these 2 groups for follow -up. The 
corresponding 95%CI for a 0.20 abstinence rate for n=25 would be (0.04, 0.36). In assessing acceptability using TAQ, a similar study observed a SD=13.4.
22 Based on this estimate, n=40 (20% dropout) in mCBT 
would lead to a 95%CI width=8.6, and n=20 in the other 2 groups would lead to a 95%CI width=12.6.  
 
4. Possible Discomforts and Risks  
 
The risks or discomforts to participating in this study are minimal. The loss of confidentiality is the greatest 
potential risk to participants.  We will take appropriate steps to protect participant confidentiality , and any  
information we collect  from participants , including any identifying information,  will be kept in REDCap, a 
secure, password- protected database. We will de -identify all data prior to moving it outside the REDCap  
environment.  The de-identified data will be kept on a secure, password- protected server. These  data will 
be associated with a unique identification number that we give participants at the beginning of  the study. All 
identifying information in REDCap, including the link that matches participants with their unique 
identification number , will be destroyed at the end of the study .  
 5. Possible Benefits  
 
Patients who participate in this program will have the benefits of improved access to tobacco treatment 
services. Some patients  may individually experience no benefit. The i nformation provided by [CONTACT_296602] a larger study aimed at increasing tobacco treatment services for cancer patients across the UF Health system.

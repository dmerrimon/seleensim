Brief Summary of Research (250 -400 words):  
Ambulatory surgery is occurring with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_510670] -care costs has 
increased.  Wh ile there are many benefits to recovering from surgery within the home, a 
significant disadvantage is the lack of rapid access to a healthcare provider when 
postoperative complications occur.  Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are 
common after surge ry and anesthesia, and recent studies have demonstrated a high 
incidence of post -discharge nausea and vomiting (PDNV) after ambulatory surgery, 
particularly in high -risk groups (female gender, age less than [ADDRESS_660395] -anesthesia care unit (PACU), and nausea in the PACU).  
Current practices known to reduce the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting in the 
PACU, such as the avoidance of volatile anesthetics and the use of intraoperative 
ondansetron and ster oids, have little effect on the risk of delayed PDNV.  Novel 
strategies to prevent PDNV are needed.  Orally administered olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], which has been 
shown to decrease the incidence of chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting, 
demonstrates promise as a novel  strategy for preventing PDNV.  It has a long half -life, 
allowing for a single dose to be administered preoperatively.  This study will evaluate 
whether there is a difference in the incidence and severity of PDNV between patients 
who receive oral olanzapin e versus placebo prior to general anesthesia for ambulatory 
surgery.

Revised  9/2/14  Research Question:  Does the addition of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_510671] 24 hours after ambulatory surgery 
relative to placebo?  Primary Objective: Compare the rate of post-discharge nausea or retching/vomiting in 
patients who receive olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_510672]. 
  Secondary Objectives:  
a) Measure the rate of post-discharge retching/vomiting in patients who receive 
olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_510672]. 
b) Measure the rate of post-discharge nausea in patients who receive olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_510673]. 
c) Measure the severity of post-discharge nausea in patients who receive olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_510674] 11-point Likert scale. 
 
2) Background 
Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are common complications that cause significant patient distress and dissatisfaction.  PONV can increase costs, delay  postanesthesia care unit discharge, and result in unanticipated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. In rare cases, serious medical complications can result, including postoperative bleeding, 
esophageal rupture, and pneumothoraces.
1 The incidence of postoperative nausea is 
approximately 50% and the incidence of vomiting is 30%.[ADDRESS_660396]-discharge nausea and vomiting (PDNV). A large prospective multi-center study found a 37% incidence of PDNV after general anesthesia.
1 Given the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_510675], this amounts to 4.3 million patients with PDNV each year in the [LOCATION_002]. Interestingly, only 20.7% of these patients suffered from PONV in the PACU prior to discharge. Most patients do not alert a healthcare provider when they suffer from nausea or vomiting after discharge, causing this frequent complication to remain under-

Independent predictors of PDNV include female gender, ag e less than 50 years, history of 
PONV, opi[INVESTIGATOR_510676], and nausea in the PACU.  A risk score for 
PDNV is based on these five factors.1  Zero, one, two, three, four, and five of these 
factors are a ssociated with a 7%, 20%, 28%, 53%, 60%, and 89% incidence of PDNV. 
Intraoperatively administered ondansetron, which has a half -life of approximately three 
hours, does not reduce the risk of PDNV. There is a trend toward decreased PDNV with 
intraoperative use of glucocorticoids, but the difference does not reach statistical 
significance.  Avoidance of volatile anesthetics in favor of a total intravenous anesthetic 
technique (TIVA), which reduces PONV, does not affect the incidence of PDNV.6  Given 
the high incidence of PDNV and paucity of effective prevention strategies, novel 
approaches for preventing this common complication are needed.  
 
Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], an atypi[INVESTIGATOR_510677], 
antagonizes several receptors implicated in the pathogeneses of nausea and vomiting  and 
has promising potential for the prevention of PDNV. Specifically, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_510678] (D 1, D2, D4), serotonin (5HT 2A, 5HT2C, 5HT3), alpha-1 adrenergic,  histamine 
(H1), and multiple muscarinic receptors.7 There is strong evidence for the antiemetic 
efficacy of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_510679] (CINV).8 A phase I  study showed a maximum tolerated dose of 
5mg during the two days prior to chemotherapy and 10mg for the next 7 days.  Two 
phase II studies demonstrated efficacy with  a similar protocol .9,10 
 
Three randomized controlled phase III trials including 488 patients in total showed 
significant improvements in CINV prevention with antiemetic regimens that included 
olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 10mg  daily during treatment. Additionally, three random ized trials including a 
total of 323 patients showed efficacy for breakthrough CINV treatment with 10mg of 
olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. Importantly, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_510680] -tolerated in all trials without 
significant differences in adverse effects (including dizziness , sedation, and 
extrapyramidal symptoms) between treatment and control groups , although the majority 
of the studies were not double -blind. Long-term use of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_510681], dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_303729] m ellitus but these 
complications were not seen with short -term use for CINV prevention or treatment.8  
 
To date, there is one small study examining the efficacy of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_510682]:  Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_510669]-Discharge Nausea

Revised  9/2/[ADDRESS_660398]-operative nause a and vomiting.  The results are promising in that 57% of patients 
in the placebo group required rescue antiemetic medications in the first 24 hours after 
surgery, whereas 37% of patients who received 10mg of oral olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_510683] n. This study included [ADDRESS_660399] on the incidence of 
PDNV. One mechanism of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -induced naus ea and vomiting is mediated through D 2 
receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the medulla oblongata.12 This makes anti -
dopaminergic agents, such as olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], ideal to target opi[INVESTIGATOR_510684].  The half -life elimination of orally administered olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_53553] 21 -54 hours.  
The time to peak plasma concentration is approximately 6 hours.  Therefore orally 
administered olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], taken with a small sip of water prior to anesthetic induction, 
demonstrates ideal pharmacokinetics for the prevention of delayed PDNV. Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]’s 
long half-life, low cost, excellent safety profile with short -term use, and targeting of 
multiple receptors implicated in nausea and vomiting (especially D 2) make it a hopefu l 
prospect for the prevention of PDNV.

needed to maintain muscle relax ation during the case. If a laryngeal mask 
airway is to be  used rather than  an endotracheal tube, anesthesia will be 
induced with propofol  1.5-2.5 mg/kg . Regardless of method of airway 
management, a nesthesia will be maintained with sevoflurane  at 
concentrations deem ed appropriate by [CONTACT_510714][INVESTIGATOR_42766]. A dditional doses 
fentanyl will be administered also as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_510715][INVESTIGATOR_510689] . All patien ts will receive dexame thasone 8 mg immediately 
following induction, and ondansetron 4 mg  and ketorolac 30mg

[CONTACT_510721] and [CONTACT_510722] are board certified anesthesiologists with 
expertise in the perioperative management of patients. All subjects will b e 
called on post -operative day one  by a study investigator. In addition to the 
routine post -operative day one phone call to the patient,  all participants 
will receive  instructions and a business card  in order to have a point of 
contact [CONTACT_510716] a potential adverse event at any time during or after the 
study period. They will also be s pecifically informed that they should 
receive emergency department care for any signs and symptoms of 
hypotension.  Patients who will not have anyone present at home after 
discharge will receive a same -day follow -up phone call from the study 
team to screen  for adverse events.  
The study remains blinded  during the second year of enrollment  and no 
interim analysis of efficacy has been performed. No adverse events have 
been reported by [CONTACT_510717].  
 
All adverse events will be recorded by [CONTACT_39292] h team in a non -
anonymized fashion and reported  directly to the Mount Sinai Institutional 
Review Board.

Specifically, a trial comparing olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_510694] a multi-symptom patient-reported 
outcome measure (MD Anderson Symptom Inventory  (MDASI) ), including  drowsiness 
and fatigue.13 A trial examining the effectiveness of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_510695] n o difference between groups in MDASI scores.14 
Another study comparing olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_139731] 5-hydroxytryptamine 3  (5-HT3) receptor 
antagonists for  prevention  of CINV found significant improvements in global health 
status, emotional functioning, social functioning, fatigue,  nausea and vomiting, insomnia 
and appetite  in the olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_179415]. There were no differences in weight, blood lipid or 
blood glucose levels between groups.15 These trials support the safety and tolerability of 
short-term use of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  
Unlike the cancer patients receiving olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_510696], 
patients in this study will be receiving general anesthesia and several other central 
nervous system depressing (CNS) medications, including intraoperative midazolam and 
fentanyl, and postoperative oxycodone. The combination of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_510697]. These risks include  sedation, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341] , extrapyramidal symptoms , 
orthostatic hypotension and cardiac rhythm abnormalities  
 
7) Provisions for Research Related Injury  
Subjects will be monitored during surgery and during recovery from anesthesia. 
Upon discharge, subjects will be provided with a phone number to call should 
they have any concerns related to surgery, anesthesia, or the study.  If necessary, 
subjects will be instructed to return to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_510698] a ttention occur.

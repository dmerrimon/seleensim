Page 13 of 81 Criteria for Evaluation: 
continued Urine concentrations of FD001 will be determined using a validated method and concentration of FD001 will be multiplied by [CONTACT_627827]001. 
 The following PK parameters will be calculated from the plasma and urine 
concentration/volume data using noncompartmental methods and actual sampling times: C
max, tmax, AUC 0-12 (FD001 only), AUC last, AUC inf, t½Ȝz, CL, CL r0-2 (FD001 only), 
CL r2-12 (FD001 only), CL r0 12 (FD001 only),V z, V ss, Ae 0-2, Ae 0-2, and Ae 0-12. 
 Pharmacodynamics: 
Plasma Volume (Cohorts 1 through 4): Plasma volume will be determined using FAST PV Technology. 
 
Additionally, PV will be estimated using Nadler’s formula.  Glomerular Filtration Rate (Cohort 1): Measured GFR will be determined using FAST 
mGFR Technology. 
 Glomerular Filtration Rate (Cohorts 2 through 4): Measured GFR will be determined using FAST mGFR Technology and Iohexol clearance methods. Correlation analysis and Bland-Altman plots will be used to compare the FAST mGFR with Iohexol clearance.  
Additionally, eGFR will be calculated primarily using the CKD-EPI [INVESTIGATOR_422089], with 
additional calculations being performed using the MDRD and Cockcroft-Gault 
equations (Cohorts 1 through 4). 
 
Planned Sample Size: Approximately 32 subjects/patients will be enrolled in 4 cohorts consisting of up to 
8 subjects/patients each. Only subjects in Cohorts 2 through 4 will contribute to the 
plasma concentration PK statistical analysis; plasma concentrations for subjects in 
Cohort [ADDRESS_836424] mGFR and PV

Pharmacodynamic Analysis: 
Plasma Volume (Cohorts 2 through 4): 
The FAST Technology for determining PV will be compared to PV estimated using 
Nadler's formula. Plasma volume data will be listed and summarized by [CONTACT_627828]. The correlation as well as the associated plot will be 
presented for comparing PV between methods.  Cosgriff et al. 1999 shows that a 
combination of the correlation and a histogram of the magnitude of difference is needed 
when no measured comparator is available. Subjects in Cohort 1 will not contribute to 
the overall PD statistical analysis.  Glomerular Filtration Rate (Cohorts 2 through 4): Measured GFR determined using the FAST VFI Technology will be compared to the mGFR determined using the Iohexol clearance test. The results will be listed by [CONTACT_627829]. Correlation analysis 
and Bland-Altman plots will be used to compare the FAST mGFR with Iohexol 
clearance. Subjects in Cohort [ADDRESS_836429] and summarized by [CONTACT_627830].  
Safety Analysis:  
12-lead ECG, vital signs, pulse oximetry, and clinical laboratory test data (observed and 
change from baseline) will be summarized by [CONTACT_9084], time point, and treatment using 
appropriate descriptive statistics. Physical examination findings will be listed only. 
 
The number and percentage of subjects reporting any treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) 
will be tabulated by [CONTACT_6657], cohort, and treatment (coded 
using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities). Treatment-emergent AEs will be 
further classified by [CONTACT_22056].

Page 37 of 81 3 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 
3.1 Introduction 
A rapid and accurate measurement of plasma volume (PV) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 
is important in acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) for assessment of impairment, diagnosis, and prompt treatment. 
Reductions in PV and/or GFR secondary to kidney injury, either acute or chronic, are 
accompanied by [CONTACT_627835] (BUN) and serum creatinine (S
cr) levels. 
Currently, either S cr, or an equation based on S cr, is used to determine a patient’s estimated GFR 
(eGFR). Unfortunately, these [ADDRESS_836457] PV and mGFR Technology™ is a direct measurement of PV and GFR that relies on 
reading the concentration of fluorescent markers attached to different size dextran molecules introduced into the bloodstream. The test is intended as an adjunct to current methods utilized to 
assess kidney function. 
The FAST PV and mGFR Technology includes intravenously (IV) administered fluorescent 
markers, timed blood draws, a validated fluorometric assay, and a computed algorithm to 
integrate the results and calculate the GFR. 
The FAST PV and mGFR Technology will aid in identifying and determining the extent of renal 
dysfunction, therefore promoting early treatment, including dialysis initiation, as well as 
enrollment and stratification for clinical studies. It could also be used to determine the effect of a 
clinical maneuver on GFR such as volume resuscitation. 
FAST BioMedical 
Protocol Number: [ADDRESS_836458] Background 
The IV administered visible fluorescent injectate (VFI)™ agent is comprised of a mixture of 
2 different molecular weight carboxymethyl dextran molecules (5 kD and 150 kD) with different 
fluorescent dye molecules attached. The 5 kD carboxymethyl dextran (FD001) is labeled with 
5-aminofluorescein and the 150 kD carboxymethyl dextran (FD003) is labeled with 2-sulfohexamine rhodamine. These fluorescent labels are covalently attached to the dextran 
through the carboxymethyl moiety. When combined in a 3:1 (mass) ratio of small to large 
molecules, these dextrans make up the VFI, termed FD004. 
The high molecular weight labeled carboxymethyl dextran, FD003, is not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_627817]; therefore, its 
concentration in the blood stream after injection provides a direct measurement of the total PV. The low molecular weight labeled carboxymethyl dextran, FD001, is also not subject to rapid 
metabolism but is freely filtered by [CONTACT_8212]. The decline in the concentration of FD001 
combined with the PV measured by [CONTACT_65791]003 provides a rapid and accurate assessment of GFR. 
The VFI is administered IV through a bolus injection. 
While the VFI is a substantially modified dextran-based compound, other dextran products have, 
on rare occasions, been associated with mild to severe, acute anaphylactic reactions including death. As a precaution, subjects w ill be closely monitored for signs of allergy and anaphylaxis, 
and an emergency resuscitation kit and team will be available within the clinical research unit (CRU) throughout the treatment period. 
Fluorescent dyes such as fluorescein, which is also used in the VFI, are known to cause transient 
ocular light sensitivity, although this effect was not reported at any dose studied in the previous 
first-in-human (FIH) or phase 2a clinical study. Should this effect be observed, subjects will be provided with disposable protective sunglasses to wear until the effect is reversed. 
3.[ADDRESS_836459]™ (Wang 2011) . The results of these studies 
provide evidence that the method, in combination with the VFI, provides an accurate GFR. 
The liquid VFI agent (FD004) was evaluated in a full range of nonclinical studies, including 
pharmacology, safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetic (PK), single-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and immunotoxicity in male and female rats and dogs at concentrations from 16 (FD003) to 
26 (FD001) fold greater than the planned maximum human dose based upon observed and 
predicted area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) values. For more information please refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure.

2]) included emesis in dogs, discolored urine, and a species specific 
effect (rats not dogs) on tissue macrophages of the lymph nodes and spleen resulting in cell death, which did not reverse during the recovery period. The clinical relevance of the macrophage finding in rats is unknown. 
Though the VFI has shown no pharmacological activity at the human dose in receptor screening, 
a cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibition study has been performed to assess potential for interaction with concomitant medications. The ability of FD001 and FD003 to inhibit CYP isoforms, 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5, was assessed to 
identify the potential of drug-drug interactions. FD001 and FD003 were each preincubated for 
0 or 30 minutes at 7 concentrations (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 μM) with human liver 
microsomes in the presence of probe substrates phenacetin, efavirenz, amodiaquine, diclofenac, mephenytoin, dextromethorphan, midazolam, and testosterone to determine if there was a direct effect on CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CY P2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5, 
respectively. Additionally, FD001 and FD003 were each incubated in the presence of dihydronicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) for up to 30 minutes at 37°C to assess the time-dependent inhibitory effects on CYP enzymes. 
Results from the CYP inhibition studies suggest that: 
x FD001 does not inhibit any CYP enzyme examined (ie, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5 [using 2 different substrates midazolam and 
testosterone]). 
x FD003 is a direct inhibitor of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4/5 (midazolam). 
x The R1 values associated with the direct inhibition of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4/5 (midazolam) by [CONTACT_65791]003 are all less than 1.1, signifying little likelihood that 
FD003 may cause clinically relevant drug interactions due to direct inhibition in vivo. 
x FD003 did not directly inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5 (as measured by 
[CONTACT_627836]ȕ -hydroxylation; testosterone). 
x FD003 was a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 (as measured by [CONTACT_97113] 
ȕ-hydroxylation) since the IC
50 value shifted from > 100 μ M with no preincubation to 
49 μM after FD003 was preincubated with NADPH-fortified human liver microsomes for 
30 minutes. However, this time-dependent inhibition was only apparent in the presence of concentrations of FD003 greater than 10 μM, or approximately 1500 times the total bound 
and unbound plasma maximum observed concentration (C
max) of 0.9 μ g/mL (0.0066 μ M).

FAST has completed pre-clinical work in dogs to assess the robustness and effectiveness of the PV measurement. Normal saline (350 mL) was infused over [ADDRESS_836460] to monitor the change in volume status in response to the volume challenge. The results 
(Figure 3.1)  showed an immediate increase in volume, followed by a slower return to 
equilibrium. 
Figure 3.[ADDRESS_836461] PV and mGFR Technology is safe and well tolerated. In this study, 32 subjects were enrolled with 8 subjects (6 VFI + 2 placebo) assigned to 1 of 4 dose 
groups. The VFI agent consisted of a mixture of 2 different molecular weight carboxymethyl 
dextran molecules (5 kD [FD001] and 150 kD [FD003]) with different fluorescent dye molecules attached. Four increasing doses were administered through a bolus injection: Group 1, 
5 mg/0.1 mL VFI; Group 2, 15 mg/0.3 mL VFI; Group 3, 75 mg/1.5 mL VFI; Group 4, 
150 mg/3 mL VFI. 
All 32 subjects completed the study as planned and were included in the safety analysis. Overall 
9 subjects (28.1%) experienced 15 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) which were 
considered by [CONTACT_627838]. Most related TEAEs were observed after administration of 15 mg VFI (9 TEAEs 
reported by 3 subjects). No related TEAEs were observed after the highest dose. Only 2 subjects 
(both 15 mg VFI) reported 6 TEAEs (pruritus and gastrointestinal disorders) which were considered related to VFI administration. All other related TEAEs were judged to be related to

TEAEs were of mild to moderate intensity. There were no serious adverse events (SAEs); no subject discontinued the study due to adverse events (AEs). Safety laboratory parameters, vital 
signs, and electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters showed no clinically relevant time- or 
treatment-related effects or differences between dose groups. 
All subjects who received VFI were included in the PK analysis. Geometric mean AUC and C
max 
of FD001 and FD003 increased dose-proportionally. FD001 had a median time at which the 
maximum concentration was observed (t max) of 0.25 hours for all doses; median t max of FD003 
was about 0.5 hours for the 2 lower doses and 2 hours for the 2 higher doses. FD001 was 
eliminated with a short elimination half-life (t ½) of about 1.5 to 4 hours; mean t ½ for FD003 was 
considerably longer ranging from 47 to 111 hours. Detailed PK data is available in the

Page 42 of 81 was the expi[INVESTIGATOR_627820] 2011, and the inability to extend the 
label dating due to purity issues with the reference materials used to calibrate the stability assay. 
Subsequently, upon review of the medical history of the single patient enrolled in Cohort 4, it 
was determined that while this patient had a declining kidney function and was being treated 
clinically as an AKI patient, the patient did not meet either the Acute Kidney Injury Network stage “2” or Rifle (risk [class R], injury [class I] and failure [class F] + 2 outcome classes [loss 
and end-stage kidney disease]) stage “I” enrollment criteria. This was noted as a protocol 
deviation. 
A secondary endpoint of the study was to compare the kidney function quantified by [CONTACT_627841] 
(Cohorts 1, 2, 3, and 5) and serum biomarkers including cystatin C and creatinine for eGFR (calculated by [CONTACT_627842]-EPI [INVESTIGATOR_422089]). Iohexol was omitted from Cohort 4, per 
protocol, because methodological differences between the 2-marker, 2-hour FAST BioMedical 
technology and the single-marker 6-hour Iohexol test would not provide comparable results in patients with a dynamically changing GFR, such as can be expected in AKI. 
Both Iohexol and the FAST mGFR technologies utilized timed blood draws and subsequent 
concentrations to calculate a predicted total AUC. The dose of marker given was divided by [CONTACT_627843], with scaling based on body surface area. The FAST mGFR utilized 
3 blood draws taken at early time points out to 2 hours. A fourth virtual point was calculated 
based on the PV at T0 (the starting concentration in the plasma just after the dose is given or time 0). The Iohexol GFR [ADDRESS_836464] mGFR measurements would be within 10% in the lower GFR groups. Prior studies conducted by 
[CONTACT_627844], have shown there were 
differences between the [ADDRESS_836465] 2 marker system, which quantifies the initial volume of marker 
distribution. This small error in AUC was only significant in mGFRs above 80 mL/min. 
In addition to studying a range of GFRs using different measurement techniques, FAST 
BioMedical intended to evaluate FAST’s measured PV method against a standard clinical 
estimate of PV, specifically Nadler’s Formula (Nadler et al 1962) .

was expected there may be a greater range seen with the CKD population in this study. 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis was performed on Cohorts 2, [ADDRESS_836467] 
administration sample collection in all study groups. Mean plasma FD001 t ½ estimates were 
5.64, 9.48, and 18.3 hours for Groups 5, 2, and 3, respectively, increasing with decreasing renal function. Mean FD001 CL decreased with decreasing renal function. No significant differences between groups were observed in FD001 C

or C max/Dose (p = 0.4781); and anticipated differences were observed in FD001

Page 44 of 81 computed tomographic head and body imaging, cerebral arteriography, peripheral venography 
(phlebography), and excretory urography. 
Following intravascular injection, Iohexol is distributed in the extracellular fluid compartment 
and is excreted unchanged by [CONTACT_575225]. It will opacify those vessels in the path of 
flow of the contrast medium permitting radiographic visualization of the internal structures until significant hemodilution occurs. 
Approximately 90% or more of the injected dose is excreted within the first [ADDRESS_836469] hour after administration. Plasma and urine Iohexol levels indicate that the Iohexol body clearance is due primarily to renal clearance (CL
r). 
An increase in the dose from 500 to 1500 mgI/kg does not significantly alter the clearance of the drug. The following PK values were observed following the IV administration of Iohexol (between 500 to 1500 mgI/kg) to 16 adult human subjects: CL
r, 120 (86 to 162) mL/min; total 
body clearance (CL), 131 (98 to 165) mL/min; and volume of distribution, 165 (108 to 219) mL/kg. 
Renal accumulation is sufficiently rapid that the period of maximal opacification of the renal 
passages may begin as early as [ADDRESS_836470] occurring between 5 to 15 minutes. In nephropathic conditions, particularly when excretory capacity has been altered, the rate of excretion may vary 
unpredictably, and opacification may be delayed after injection. Severe renal impairment may 
result in a lack of diagnostic opacification of the collecting system and, depending on the degree of renal impairment, prolonged plasma Iohexol levels may be anticipated. In these patients, the 
route of excretion through the gallbladder and into the small intestine may increase. 
Iohexol displays a low affinity for serum or plasma proteins and is poorly bound to serum 
albumin. 
No significant metabolism, deiodination, or biotransformation occurs. 
Iohexol enhances computed tomographic imaging through augmentation of radiographic 
efficiency. The degree of density enhancement is directly related to the iodine content in an 
administered dose; peak iodine blood levels occur immediately following rapid IV injection. 
Blood levels fall rapi[INVESTIGATOR_83826] 5 to 10 minutes and the vascular compartment half-life is approximately 20 minutes. This can be accounted for by [CONTACT_627845]. 
Equilibration with the extracellular compartments is reached in about 10 minutes; thereafter, the fall becomes exponential. 
Refer to the  OMNIPAQUE (Iohexol) injection prescribing information (2010) for additional 
details.

3.6.1 Rationale for Dose Selection 
Doses of VFI for this study were selected based on results of the Phase 1 FIH study in healthy 
subjects and in the Phase 2a study in subjects with normal and compromised renal function, as well as from data obtained in nonclinical studies (additional information is provided in the 
Investigator’s Brochure). 
Data from the FIH study evaluating the safety of the FAST PV and mGFR Technology in 
healthy adult subjects indicated the study dose of 75 mg/1.[ADDRESS_836471] indicated that, in the planned Phase 2b study, a single administration of VFI 47 mg/3 mL is expected to be well tolerated and easily measured in all subjects. Additionally, for 
Cohort 2, where subjects will receive 2 doses of VFI, each dose being 47 mg/3mL it is expected 
that it will be well tolerated. As the FD001 marker is cleared and the doses are separated by 
[ADDRESS_836472] has derived the mathematical equations for 
GFR to appropriately compensate for any residual FD001; however, these normal subjects are 
not anticipating a residual level of FD001 in subjects on Day [ADDRESS_836473] VFI with regards to dynamic changes in the plasma volume over time in a safe and 
controlled manner. 
3.6.2 Rationale for Study Design 
This is a Phase 2b prospective, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, 
and pharmacodynamics (PD) of the FAST PV and mGFR Technology in healthy adult subjects 
and patients with renal impairment.

Page 67 of 81 9.2.1 Serious Adverse Events 
The investigator is responsible for determining whether an AE meets the definition of a SAE. A 
SAE is any AE occurring from ICF signing through the EOS visit that results in any of the 
following outcomes: 
x Death 
x A life-threatening adverse drug experience 
x Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
x A persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
x A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse. 
Note: SAEs require immediate reporting to the medical monitor. Refer to “Reporting Serious 
Adverse Events” ( Section 9.4)  for details. 
9.2.2 Intensity 
The intensity of an AE will be graded according to the following definitions: 
x Mild: Any symptom of which the subject is aware, but which is easily tolerated; 
asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. 
x Moderate: Any symptom which is discomforting enough to cause interference with a subject's usual activity; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL). 
x Severe: Any symptom which causes a subject's inability to perform usual activity; severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self-care ADL.

The relationship of an AE to the study drug should be determined by [CONTACT_627852]: 
x Not related: The event is most likely produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical 
condition, intercurrent illness, or concomitant drugs, and does not follow a known response pattern to the study drug, or the temporal relationship of the event to study drug 
administration makes a causal relationship unlikely 
x Possibly related: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, and/or follows a known response pattern to the study drug, but could have 
been produced by [CONTACT_1605]'s clinical condition, intercurrent illness, or 
concomitant drugs 
x Probably related: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, and/or follows a known response pattern to the study drug, and cannot be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_1605]'s clinical condition, intercurrent illness, or concomitant drugs 
9.2.4 Significant Adverse Events 
Significant AEs are defined as marked hematological and other laboratory abnormalities (other 
than those meeting the definition of serious) and any events that led to an intervention, including 
withdrawal of study drug, dose reduction, or significant additional concomitant therapy, other than those reported as SAEs. 
9.[ADDRESS_836523] who experiences an AE may be withdrawn at any time from the study at the 
discretion of the investigator. Subjects withdrawn from the study due to an AE, whether serious 
or nonserious, may be followed by [CONTACT_627853]. The AE(s) should be noted on the appropriate eCRFs and the subject’s progress should be followed until the AE is resolved or stabilized as determined by [CONTACT_093]. The 
medical monitor must be notified. If the AE relates to overdose of study treatment, the 
Investigator’s Brochure should be consulted for details of any specific actions to be taken. 
9.4 Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
In the event of any SAE reported or observed during the study, whether or not attributable to the 
study drug, site personnel will report it immediately by [CONTACT_627854]/or SAE study-specific procedure. Site personnel will follow up with a faxed written report on the next working day as follows.

TitleA Phase II study of Sodium thiosulfate (STS) for prevention of ototoxicity in 
patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck 
(SCCHN) undergoing concurrent chemoradiation with cisplatin
Study DescriptionThis is a phase II study to establish feasibility of using sodium thiosulfate after 
intravenous cisplatin in head and neck cancer patients undergoing definitive 
concurrent chemoradiation for prevention of ototoxicity. Hypothesis is that 
use of intravenous STS would be feasible and safe in patients with locally 
advanced SCCHN undergoing concurrent chemoradiation with cisplatin. This 
is a prospective clinical trial for patients getting eitherweekly cisplatin 
(40mg/m2) or every-3-week cisplatin (100mg/m2). A total of [ADDRESS_1276447]-treatment (3 months 
after the completion of concurrent chemoradiation) audiogram to assess 
hearing loss as defined by [CONTACT_94979] 5.0. STS (10 g/m2 for weekly 
cisplatin group and 20g/m2 for high dose cisplatin group) will be infused 4 
hours after each cisplatin infusion is completed. Feasibility will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_909219], defined by [CONTACT_37142] 5 
weekly cisplatin or 2 high dose cisplatin without any extended treatment 
related delays more than > 7 days.

Phase II study - Sodium Thiosulfate (STS)  Page [ADDRESS_1276459] patients with SCCHN present with locally advanced disease which requires multimodality treatment 
including surgery, radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. The majority of patients are treated with concurrent 
chemoradiation with cisplatin and survive the intensive treatment [2]. Especially for HPV positive SCCHN 
which has excellent prognosis, treatment deintensification has been attempted to save these patients 
from long term toxicities. Disappointingly, a recent, large randomized clinical trial comparing concurrent 
cetuximab and cisplatin has suggested that cetuximab may lead to inferior clinical outcome compared to 
cisplatin [3] and cisplatin remains the standard of care for concurrent chemoradiation in these patients. 
Cisplatin is a widely used systemic anti-cancer agent, and its toxicities including nephrotoxicity, 
neuropathy and ototoxicity have been well described. Indeed, in a prospective cohort study, 63% of 
locally advanced SCCHN patients who were treated with concurrent chemoradiation with cisplatin 
developed moderate to severe (grade  2 change from baseline (common terminology criteria for adverse 
events, CTCAE v4.03) ototoxicity with average time to onset of 2.25 months [4]. Furthermore, cisplatin 
induced ototoxicity seems to be dose-dependent. In testicular cancer patients, every 100mg/m2 increase 
in cisplatin dose resulted in a 3.2 dB impairment in the age-adjusted overall hearing threshold[5]. 
1.[ADDRESS_1276460](s) and Associated Known 
Toxicities
Sodium Thiosulfate (STS) is an inorganic compound which is used widely for gold mining, water 
treatment, analytic chemistry, development of silver based photographic films and prints, as well as 
medicine. In medicine, it has been used as an antidote for cyanide poisoning, a topi[INVESTIGATOR_909209], and a systemic treatment for calciphylaxis in end stage renal disease patients. 
STS is approved by [CONTACT_909220]. Adverse events 
that have been reported in medical literature include hypotension, headache, disorientation, nausea and 
vomiting, prolonged bleeding time, salty taste in mouth and warm sensation over body. These adverse 
events were not reported in the context of controlled trials or with consistent monitoring and reporting 
methodologies for adverse events. 
In humans, rapid administration of concentrated solutions or solutions not freshly prepared, and 
administration of large doses of sodium thiosulfate have been associated with a higher incidence of 
nausea and vomiting. However, administration of 0.1 g sodium thiosulfate per pound up to a maximum of 
15 g in a 10-15% solution over 10-15 minutes was associated with nausea and vomiting in 7 of 26 
patients without concomitant cyanide intoxication. In a series of 11 human subjects, a single intravenous 
infusion of 50 mL of 50% sodium thiosulfate was associated with increases in clotting time 1-3 days after 
administration. However, no significant changes were observed in other hematological parameters[6]. 
It also has been extensively studied as a “cisplatin rescue” agent to maximize dose intensity. Cisplatin 
favors positively charged platinum species, which possess both antitumor and toxic activities in a low 
chloride environment such as the intracellular space. Following IV administration, sodium thiosulfate 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_909210] a covalently bound compound 
[7]. In a phase 1 study, in which cisplatin 100mg/m2 was infused with concurrent STS followed by 
[CONTACT_909221] 2-3 hours, the pharmacokinetic properties of cisplatin including elimination 
rate constant, volume of distribution, or total body clearance did not change significantly [8]. In this clinical 
trial, reported toxicities included elevated creatinine, myelosuppression, nausea, vomiting and 
hypomagnesemia, which are consistent with known effects of cisplatin.

Version date: 09-09-2022 Protocol CC#: [ZIP_CODE]
Phase II study - Sodium Thiosulfate (STS)  Page [ADDRESS_1276461] excellent clinical outcome [9], long-term 
treatment related toxicities such as hearing impairment can significantly impact patients’ quality of life. 
In head and neck cancers, sodium thiosulfate delivered after intra-arterial cisplatin has shown to be 
associated with decreased risks of hearing loss in previous research [10, 11]. Furthermore, recent 
clinical trials demonstrated IV sodium thiosulfate after [ADDRESS_1276462] pediatric 
cancer patients from cisplatin induced hearing impairment with an acceptable safety profile [1, 12]. One 
of the trials also demonstrated that there was no significant difference in oncologic outcome between 
the STS group and the control group in pediatric patients with hepatoblastoma when STS infusion was 
given 6 hours after cisplatin dose[1]. Although efficacy and safety of STS has been established in 
pediatric hepatoblastoma patients receiving 480mg/m2 (cumulative dose) of single agent cisplatin, no 
prospective studies exist for STS in locally advanced SCCHN patients undergoing definitive 
chemoradiation. Once the feasibility and safety of STS infusion are deemed promising in this population 
based on this phase IIt study, the concept could be easily expanded to a larger study for definitive 
testing which could be conducted in the head and neck cancer population or a broader population with 
various cancers which utilize cisplatin-based chemotherapy in NRG Oncology, either as a stand-alone 
supportive care focused trial or as an adjunctive study to existing or new therapeutic clinical trials.  
1.4 Rationale for the Dose Selection/Regimen 
Intravenous STS 10 g/m2 or 20 g/m2 will be administered over 1-2 hours, 4 hours after each cisplatin dose 
is completed, depending on weekly or high dose cisplatin regimen. In recent clinical trials in pediatric 
cancer patients, STS 20 g/m2 infused after 6 hours of cisplatin has been well tolerated with little 
compromise in oncologic outcome. STS can reduce toxicities from cisplatin by [CONTACT_909222], preserving the activity of antioxidant enzymes, and forming biologically inactive complexes with 
cisplatin to effectively reduce the systemic exposure to cisplatin. In pediatric hepatoblastoma study, STS 
20 g/m2 was given after cisplatin 80mg/m2. For lower dose, weekly cisplatin, 10g/m2 would be reasonable, 
as only half dose of cisplatin (40mg/m2) is given.  In animal studies, STS given [ADDRESS_1276463] rats from ototoxicity with minimal compromise in anti-tumor activity of cisplatin, whereas 
STS 8 and 12 hours after cisplatin had less and no protective effects at all [13].STS is a FDA approved 
agent for treatment of cyanide poisoning and it is approved to be given as a single dose of 12.5g after 
infusion of 300mg of sodium nitrite. In a phase 3 trial for calciphylaxis, STS is given 25 g per day for 3 
times a week[14]. Figure 1. (A) Hearing loss (Brock grade ≧ 1) occurred in 33% in cisplatin-
STS group and 63% in cisplatin-alone group (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.33-0.81) 
(B) There was no significant difference event-free survival between 
cisplatin-STS group and cisplatin-alone group[1]

4.1.1 Sodium Thiosulfate
Classification
Sodium thiosulfate has the chemical name [CONTACT_909232], disodium salt, pentahydrate. The chemical 
formula is Na 2S2O3· 5H2O and the molecular weight is 248.17. The structural formula is: 
Structure of Sodium Thiosulfate Pentahydrate
Sodium thiosulfate injection is a sterile aqueous solution and is intended for intravenous injection. Each 
vial contains 12.5 grams of sodium thiosulfate in 50 mL solution (250 mg/mL). Each mL also contains 2.8 
mg boric acid and 4.4 mg of potassium chloride. The pH of the solution is adjusted with boric acid and/or 
sodium hydroxide. Sodium thiosulfate injection is a clear solution with a pH between 7.5 and 9.5. 
Mechanism of Action
Sodium thiosulfate can reduce cisplatin-induced toxicity by [CONTACT_909224], 
preserving the activity of antioxidant enzymes (e.g., SOD), and forming biologically inactive complexes 
with cisplatin to effectively reduce the systemic exposure to cisplatin. Of the thiol-containing compounds 
that have been shown to protect against cisplatin-induced ototoxicity, sodium thiosulfate is by [CONTACT_909225]-containing otoprotectant. The 
structural basis for the formation of the Pt–STS complexes has been recently described and a Pt–STS 
complex has been characterized as a four-coordinate Pt(II) species, [Pt(S 2O3)4]6–, by [CONTACT_2224] X-ray 
absorption spectroscopy[Metallomics 2016, 8, 1170–[PHONE_18865]/C6MT00183A]. In vitro, STS decreases 
the amount of free cisplatin in human plasma, with 31% of free cisplatin remaining in plasma within 10 
min of STS incubation, as compared with 87% with no STS. Furthermore, the free cisplatin remains in 
human plasma for less than [ADDRESS_1276472] of the thiosulfate is oxidized to sulfate or is 
incorporated into endogenous sulphur compounds; a small proportion is excreted through the kidneys. 
Approximately 20-50% of exogenously administered thiosulfate is eliminated unchanged via the kidneys. 
After an intravenous injection of 1 g sodium thiosulfate in patients, the reported serum thiosulfate half-life 
was approximately 20 minutes. However, after an intravenous injection of a substantially higher dose of 

 UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 09-09-2022 Protocol CC#: [ZIP_CODE]
Phase II study - Sodium Thiosulfate (STS)  Page 17 of 44sodium thiosulfate (150 mg/kg, that is, 9 g for 60 kg body weight) in normal healthy men, the reported 
elimination half-life was 182 minutes. 
Contraindications
None (as per the drug label)
Formulation, Appearance, Packaging, and Labeling
Sodium thiosulfate is supplied as one 50 mL glass vial of 250 mg/mL (containing 12.5 grams of sodium 
thiosulfate) for intravenous administration. 
Availability
Sodium thiosulfate is being obtained as commercial supply. 
Storage and handling
Sodium thiosulfate is stored at the UCSF investigational pharmacy at controlled room temperature 
between 20°C and 25°C (68°F to 77°F); excursions permitted from 15 to 30°C (59 to 86°F). It needs to be 
protect from direct light. It should not be frozen. 
Side Effects
Complete and updated adverse event information is available in product package insert. 
4.1.2 Cisplatin 
Classification
Cisplatin injection infusion concentrate is a clear, colorless, sterile aqueous solution available in amber 
vials. The active ingredient, cisplatin, is an anti-neoplastic agent, which is yellow to orange crystalline 
powder with the molecular formula PtCl 2H6N2, and a molecular weight of 300.1. Cisplatin is a heavy 
metal complex containing a central atom of platinum surrounded by [CONTACT_310997]. It is soluble in water or saline at 1 mg/mL and in dimethylformamide at 24 
mg/mL. It has a melting point of 207° C. 
Mechanism of Action
Cisplatin crosslinks with the purine bases on the DNA and interferes with DNA repair mechanisms, 
causes DNA damage, and subsequently induces apoptosis in cancer cells. Although this drug seems to 
act as an alkylating agent, there are data to indicate that its mode and sites of action are different from 
those of nitrogen mustard and the standard alkylating agents.
Metabolism
Plasma concentrations of the parent compound, cisplatin, decay monoexponentially with a half- life of 
about 20 to 30 minutes following bolus administrations of 50 or 100 mg/m2 doses. Monoexponential 
decay and plasma half-lives of about 0.5 hour are also seen following 2-hour or 7-hour infusions of 100 
mg/m2. After the latter, the total-body clearances and volumes of distribution at steady-state for cisplatin 
are about 15 to 16 L/h/m2 and 11 to 12 L/m2. 
Due to its unique chemical structure, the chlorine atoms of cisplatin are more subject to chemical 
displacement reactions by [CONTACT_218663], such as water or sulfhydryl groups, than to enzyme- catalyzed 
metabolism. At physiological pH in the presence of 0.1M NaCl, the predominant molecular species are 
cisplatin and monohydroxymonochloro cis-diammine platinum (II) in nearly equal concentrations. The 
latter, combined with the possible direct displacement of the chlorine atoms by [CONTACT_909226], accounts for the instability of cisplatin in biological matrices. The ratios of cisplatin to 
total free (ultrafilterable) platinum in the plasma vary considerably between patients and range from 0.5 to 
 UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 09-09-2022 Protocol CC#: [ZIP_CODE]
Phase II study - Sodium Thiosulfate (STS)  Page 18 of 441.1 after a dose of 100 mg/m2. Cisplatin does not undergo the instantaneous and reversible binding to 
plasma proteins that is characteristic of normal drug-protein binding. However, the platinum from cisplatin, 
but not cisplatin itself, becomes bound to several plasma proteins, including albumin, transferrin, and 
gamma globulin. Three hours after a bolus injection and two hours after the end of a three-hour infusion, 
90% of the plasma platinum is protein bound. The complexes between albumin and the platinum from 
cisplatin do not dissociate to a significant extent and are slowly eliminated with a minimum half-life of five 
days or more. 
Following cisplatin doses of 20 to 120 mg/m2, the concentrations of platinum are highest in liver, prostate, 
and kidney; somewhat lower in bladder, muscle, testicle, pancreas, and spleen; and lowest in bowel, 
adrenal, heart, lung, cerebrum, and cerebellum. Platinum is present in tissues for as long as [ADDRESS_1276473] platinum concentrations, but these are similar to the platinum concentrations in normal liver. 
Maximum red blood cell concentrations of platinum are reached within 90 to 150 minutes after a 100 
mg/m2 dose of cisplatin and decline in a biphasic manner with a terminal half-life of 36 to 47 days. 
Over a dose range of 40 to 140 mg cisplatin/m2 given as a bolus injection or as infusions varying in length 
from 1 hour to 24 hours, from 10% to about 40% of the administered platinum is excreted in the urine in 
24 hours. Over five days following administration of 40 to 100 mg/m2 doses given as rapid, 2- to 3-hour, 
or 6- to 8-hour infusions, a mean of 35% to 51% of the dosed platinum is excreted in the urine. Similar 
mean urinary recoveries of platinum of about 14% to 30% of the dose are found following five daily 
administrations of 20, 30, or 40 mg/m2/day. Only a small percentage of the administered platinum is 
excreted beyond [ADDRESS_1276474] few hours. Platinum-containing species excreted in the urine are the same as 
those found following the incubation of cisplatin with urine from healthy subjects, except that the 
proportions are different. The parent compound, cisplatin, is excreted in the urine and accounts for 13% 
to 17% of the dose excreted within one hour after administration of 50 mg/m2. The mean renal clearance 
of cisplatin exceeds creatinine clearance and is 62 and 50 mL/min/m2 following administration of 100 
mg/m2 as 2-hour or 6- to 7-hour infusions, respectively. 
The renal clearance of free (ultrafilterable) platinum also exceeds the glomerular filtration rate indicating 
that cisplatin or other platinum-containing molecules are actively secreted by [CONTACT_8212]. The renal 
clearance of free platinum is nonlinear and variable and is dependent on dose, urine flow rate, and 
individual variability in the extent of active secretion and possible tubular reabsorption. 
There is a potential for accumulation of ultrafilterable platinum plasma concentrations whenever cisplatin 
is administered on a daily basis but not when dosed on an intermittent basis. 
No significant relationships exist between the renal clearance of either free platinum or cisplatin and 
creatinine clearance. 
Although small amounts of platinum are present in the bile and large intestine after administration of 
cisplatin, the fecal excretion of platinum appears to be insignificant. 
Contraindications
Cisplatin is contraindicated in patients with preexisting renal impairment. Cisplatin should not be 
employed in myelosuppressed patients, or in patients with hearing impairment.  Cisplatin is 
contraindicated in patients with a history of allergic reactions to cisplatin or other platinum-containing 
compounds.

made to constrain the maximum dose to 35 Gy when possible without compromising tumor 
volume coverage. The maximum point doses and average doses delivered to the right cochlea 
and left cochlea will be recorded.
5.2 Dose Modifications for Cisplatin
5.2.1 Neutropenia: 
If on the day of scheduled treatment with cisplatin the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is < 
1000/mm3, hold the second chemotherapy treatment but not the radiation until ANC ≥ 
1000/mm3, then treat at 100% dose.
5.2.2 Thrombocytopenia: 
If on the day of scheduled treatment with cisplatin the platelet count is < 75,000/mm3, hold the 
second chemotherapy treatment but not the radiation until platelets are ≥  75,000/mm3, then treat 
at 100% dose.
5.2.3 Renal Adverse Events:  
Cisplatin dose should be based on the serum creatinine or creatinine clearance immediately prior to the 
second cisplatin dose using the following guidelines:
Note: If creatinine is > 1.5 mg/dl, creatinine clearance must be calculated (Cockcroft-Gault) in order to 
make dose adjustment. The cisplatin dose will be determined as follows:
Serum Creatinine Clearance Cisplatin Dose
≤ 1.5 mg/dl or > 50 ml/min full dose
1.5 mg/dl and < 50 ml/min Hold drug*
             *Cisplatin should be held (but the RT continued) and the creatinine measured weekly, until it is
< 1.5 mg/dl or the creatinine clearance is > 50 ml/min, and then the second dose of cisplatin
             can be given at the reduced dose by 50%.

Phase II study - Sodium Thiosulfate (STS)  Page 23 of 445.2.4. Nausea and Vomiting: 
Maximum supportive therapy will be given, and cisplatin will be continued at full dose for ≤ 
grade 2 nausea and vomiting. 
For grade 3 nausea and vomiting refractory to supportive therapy, cisplatin will be held until 
recovery to < grade 2. No dose reductions will be made.
5.2.4 Mucositis: 
Significant mucositis (grade 3-4, NCI CTCAE, version 45.0) is expected from radiation and 
cisplatin and should not be a reason for a treatment break, unless it significantly interferes with 
fluid intake or nutrition.  Aggressive supportive care is encouraged.
If a participant experiences several adverse events and there are conflicting recommendations, 
the investigator should use the recommended dose adjustment that reduces the dose to the 
lowest level.

We assume that no more than 25% of patients would fail to receive cumulative cisplatin dose of 
200 mg/m2 in either cisplatin dose stratum. With the Beta prior distribution with parameters 2 
and 6, the prior expected rate is set at the targeted rate of 25%, and the prior probability of the 
risk greater than 25% is 45%. We apply this prior distribution to the observed number of patients 
experiencing high grade toxicity and compute the posterior (updated) probability of the risk of 
such toxicities greater than 25%. In each cisplatin dose stratum we will consider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_909213] .70(Table 1).

Phase II study – Sodium Thiosulfate (STS)  Page 34 of 447.2 Definitions of Adverse Events 
7.2.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event (also known as an adverse experience) is defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug 
related.  More specifically, an adverse event (can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., 
an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
drug, without any judgment about causality.  An adverse event can arise from any use of the 
drug (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
7.2.2 Adverse Reaction
An adverse reaction is defined as any adverse event caused by [CONTACT_2224] a drug.  Adverse 
reactions are a subset of all suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude 
that the drug caused the event.
7.2.3 Suspected Adverse Reaction
A suspected adverse reaction is defined as any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility” indicates that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the adverse event.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree 
of certainty about causality than an adverse reaction.
[IP_ADDRESS] Unexpected 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered unexpected if it is not listed 
in the investigator brochure or package insert(s), or is not listed at the specificity or severity 
that has been observed, or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not 
consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or 
elsewhere in the current application. 
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs 
or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.
Adverse events that would be anticipated to occur as part of the disease process are 
considered unexpected for the purposes of reporting because they would not be listed in the 
investigator brochure.  For example, a certain number of non-acute deaths in a cancer trial 
would be anticipated as an outcome of the underlying disease, but such deaths would 
generally not be listed as a suspected adverse reaction in the investigator brochure.
Some adverse events are listed in the Investigator Brochure as occurring with the same 
class of drugs, or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, even 
though they have not been observed with the drug under investigation.  Such events would 
be considered unexpected until they have been observed with the drug under investigation. 
For example, although angioedema is anticipated to occur in some participants exposed to 
drugs in the angiotensin-converting enzymeinhibitor class and angioedema would be 
described in the investigator brochure as a class effect, the first case of angioedema 
observed with the drug under investigation should be considered unexpected for reporting 
purposes.

Version date: 09-09-2022 Protocol CC#: [ZIP_CODE]
Phase II study – Sodium Thiosulfate (STS)  Page 35 of [IP_ADDRESS] Serious
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
Death
Life-threatening adverse event
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life function
Congenital anomaly/birth defect
Important medical events that may not result in death, are life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
[IP_ADDRESS] Life-threatening
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered life-threatening if, in the view 
of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk 
of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.

The Sponsor (or Sponsor-Investigator) must report in an IND safety report any suspected 
adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected. The Sponsor needs to ensure that the 
event meets all three definitions: 
Suspected adverse reaction 
Unexpected 
Serious 
If the adverse event does not meet all three of the definitions, it should not be submitted as an 
expedited IND safety report.
The timeline for submitting an IND safety report to FDA is no later than 15 calendar days after 
the Investigator determines that the suspected adverse reaction qualifies for reporting (21 CFR 
312.32(c)(1)). 
Any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction will be reported to FDA no 
later than 7 calendar days  after the Investigator’s initial receipt of the information (21 CFR 
312.32(c)(2)). 
Any relevant additional information that pertains to a previously submitted IND safety report will 
be submitted to FDA as a Follow-up IND Safety Report without delay, as soon as the 
information is available (21 CFR 312.32(d)(2)).

Phase II study – Sodium Thiosulfate (STS)  Page 42 of 44Appendix 2 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan for Phase II or III Institutional Study
1.         Oversight and Monitoring Plan  
The UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (HDFCCC) Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is responsible for auditing data quality and participant safety for 
all HDFCCC institutional clinical trials.  A summary of DSMC activities for this trial includes:  
Semiannual auditing (depending on trial accrual) 
Review of serious adverse events 
Minimum of biennial regulatory auditing 
2. Monitoring and Reporting Guidelines 
Investigators will conduct a continuous review of data and participant safety at monthly site 
committee meetings where the results of each participant’s treatment are discussed and 
documented in the site committee minutes.   
All institutional Phase II and III therapeutic trials are audited on a semiannual basis, with all data 
from twenty percent of the enrolled participants audited by [CONTACT_909230]/Auditor.  The assigned DSMC Monitor/Auditor will review no more than a total of 
10 participant charts during the course of auditing this trial. DSMC Monitor/Auditors will send a 
follow-up report to the study team within 20 business days after the auditing visit is complete for 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_80053] 20 business 
days.  An abbreviated regulatory review (i.e., reviewing protocol and consent versions, SAEs, 
PVs, DOA logs, 1572 forms, etc.) will occur at each participant monitoring review; however, a 
full regulatory review will occur on a biennially basis by [CONTACT_116799]. 
Auditing of all enrolled participants in these trials will be complete after 20% of enrolled 
participants have been audited through five cycles of treatment.  However, regulatory reviews of 
the trial, safety reviews (i.e., Serious Adverse Event (SAE) reviews and Protocol Violation (PV) 
reviews), and audit/inspection preparation (as applicable) will continue until the trial is closed by 
[CONTACT_1201].   
3. Review and Oversight Requirements 
3.1 Adverse Event Monitoring  
All Grade 3-5 adverse events (AEs), whether or not considered to be expected or unexpected 
and whether or not considered to be associated with the use of the investigational agent(s) 
or study procedure, will be entered into OnCore®, UCSF’s Clinical Trial Management System.   
Adverse events are graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) as developed and revised by [CONTACT_80105] (CTEP) of the 
National Cancer Institute.  Adverse events are further given an assignment of attribution or 
relationship to investigational agent or study procedure.  Attribution categories are: 
• Definite – The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational agent(s) 
or study procedure. 
• Probable – The adverse event is likely related to the investigational agent(s) 
or study procedure. 
 UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 09-09-2022 Protocol CC#: [ZIP_CODE]
Phase II study – Sodium Thiosulfate (STS)  Page 43 of 44• Possible – The adverse event may be related to the investigational agent(s) 
or study procedure. 
• Unrelated – the adverse event is clearly not related to the investigational agent(s) 
or study procedure. 
All Grade 3-5 adverse events entered into OnCore® will be reviewed on a monthly basis at the 
Site Committee meetings.  The Site Committee will review and discuss the selected toxicity, the 
toxicity grade, and attribution assignment. 
3.2 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
By [CONTACT_108], an adverse event is defined as a serious adverse event (SAE) according to the 
following criteria: 
• Death. 
• Life-threatening (i.e., results in an immediate risk of death). 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], 
• Permanent or significant disability/incapacity 
• Gives rise to a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or cancer, or any experience that suggests a 
significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution that may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
• Event occurring in a gene therapy study. 
• Event that changes the risk/benefit ratio of a study. 
• Any other event the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_80054] a 
significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution. 
Serious adverse event reporting will be in accordance with all IRB regulations. For trials 
conducted under an investigational new drug (IND) application, the SAE will be reported in 
accordance with Code of Federal Regulation Title 21 Part 312.32 and will be reported on a Med 
Watch form.   
UCSF IRB website for guidance in reporting serious adverse events: 
https://irb.ucsf.edu/adverse-event  
Med Watch forms and information: 
www.fda.gov/medwatch/getforms.htm 
All serious adverse events are entered into OnCore®, as well as submitted to the IRB (per IRB 
guidelines).  The SAEs are reviewed and monitored by [CONTACT_909231], which take place every six 
weeks.  The date the SAE is sent to all required reporting agencies will be documented in 
OnCore®.  
If the SAE involves a subject death, and is determined to be possibly, probably or definitely 
related to the investigational drug or any research related procedure, the event must be 
reported to the DSMC Chair (or Vice Chair) and DSMC Director within one business day.

Phase II study – Sodium Thiosulfate (STS)  Page 44 of 443.3 Review of Adverse Event Rates 
If an increase in the frequency of Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (above the rate reported in the 
Investigator Brochure or package insert) is noted in the study, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_909218].  The report will indicate if 
the incidence of adverse events observed in the study is above the range stated in the 
Investigator Brochure or package insert. 
If at any time the Investigator voluntarily holds enrollment or stops the study due to safety 
issues, the DSMC Chair (or Vice Chair) and the DSMC Director must be notified within 
one business day and the IRB must be notified as per IRB reporting regulations.

1. Objectives
1.1. Purpose,  specific aims, or objectives:
The purpose of  this study is to understand the perspectives of adolescents, parents, and 
clinicians on the decision to resume or cease sport participation following recovery from a sport-
related concussion. Specifically, this study will test the effectiveness of created decision aids to 
help with this understanding and discussion. The specific aims of this study are four-fold:
Aim 1 : Conduct surveys with clinicians (inclusive of pediatrician and family medicine 
providers) and families who have an adolescent recovering from a sport-related 
concussion (one parent and one adolescent) about their experiences discussing return to 
sport. Specifically, this aim will survey clinicians about their current knowledge and belief 
of concussion research, their experiences with discussing return to sport post-concussion 
with families, and their opi[INVESTIGATOR_893026]-making aid with families on this topic. This aim will also survey parent-
adolescent dyads about their experiences making the decision to return to sport. Findings 
from this aim will directly influence Aims 3 and 4.
Aim 2 : First, this aim will include semi-structured interviews (inclusive of cognitive 
interviewing, qualitative interviewing) with families (one parent and one adolescent) in 
order to learn more about their experiences making decisions to resume or stop sport 
participation after recovery from a sport-related concussion . Second, this aim will 
conduct usability testing with families (one parent and one adolescent) and their clinicians 
with created parent and adolescent decision aids for enabling return to sport discussions 
following a sport-related concussion. Specifically, this aim will involve usability tests (i.e., 
interview + tasks) to evaluate the effectiveness of current decision aids for parent and 
adolescent and provide feedback on ways to tailor the current decision aids better. 
Findings from this aim will be used directly in Aim 4.
Aim 3 : First, this aim will include semi-structured interviews (inclusive of cognitive 
interviewing, qualitative interviewing) in order to receive directed and specific clinician 
feedback on how to create a decision aid effectively for their use. 
Aim 3  (continued): Second, this aim will conduct usability testing with clinicians 
(including pediatricians and family medicine providers) for a clinician-specific decision 
aid. The findings from Aim 1 and Aim 2 will help inform the creation of a clinician-specific 
decision aid. Findings from this aim will be used directly in Aim 4.
Aim 4 : This aim has two cohorts:
Aim 4a:  Cohort [ADDRESS_1250745] of the intervention 
group in Aim 4b. 
Aim 4b:  Cohort 2  includes a pi[INVESTIGATOR_893027] (RCT) of all three decision aids 
(i.e., parent, adolescent, clinician) to assess intervention efficacy of all decision aids in 
aiding family shared decision making in returning to sport post-sport related concussion.

2. Background
2.1. Relevant  prior experience and gaps in current knowledge:
  
Sport-related concussion is  a prevalent injury among U.S. youth. More than [ADDRESS_1250746]/collision sport is a structural brain abnormality visible on 
neuroimaging, which is rare and usually unrelated to the diagnosis of concussion.21,[ADDRESS_1250747]/collision sport complies with current standards of care for nearly all children with 
resolution of acute concussive symptoms.
Medical clearance,  however, does not mean that return to sport is free from risk.  Even when 
athletes have recovered from their acute injury symptoms, they may be at risk of later-life neurologic 
dysfunction. Indeed, there is emerging evidence that the burden of concussion may be cumulative,23,[ADDRESS_1250748]/collision sport means risking sustaining an additional concussion, 
which is often accompanied by [CONTACT_69506]-term psychosocial consequences, including impaired academic and 
social functioning,[ADDRESS_1250749] that this decision is highly individualized. 
Influential factors in this decision include clinical variability (e.g., injury severity, recovery trajectory, type 
of functional impairment post-injury, the interval between prior injuries, the age at which injuries occurred, 
and premorbid health conditions),5,21 and different family tolerance for the uncertain risk of harm 
associated with sustaining an additional concussion relative to what they see as the benefits of returning 
to sport and the risks and benefits of substitute activities.7–[ADDRESS_1250750] to be equivalent in terms of their medical burden 
for shared decision making (SDM) to be appropriate, if all meet current standards of care.28 There are two 
main situations in which our formative interviews with clinicians indicate SDM would be appropriate: (1) 
the clinician believes that medical harms of returning to contact/collision sport outweigh benefits, but the 
burden does not reach the threshold of mandatory medical disqualification (“retirement recommended”), 
and (2) the clinician believes there is medical equipoise between the costs and benefits of returning to 
contact/collision sport but the family is concerned (“no recommendation”). In the “retirement 
recommended” condition, the clinician would share a recommended course of action (e.g., ceasing 
contact/collision sport) and attempt to help the family—adolescent and parents—embrace the values and 
preferences that align with this recommendation.28 In the “no recommendation” condition, SDM would

quality decisions are facilitated by a decisional process where: all parties involved recognize that a 
decision has to be made, feel informed about the risks and benefits of key options, and are clear on what 
matters most to them.12,[ADDRESS_1250752]/collision sport retirement tend to occur when the clinician believes cessation would be medically 
beneficial, often around [ADDRESS_1250753] parents of youth football players would prefer this conversation to be initiated earlier 
after 1 or 2 concussions (Kroshus et al., under review). We have also found that timing of this 
conversation is influenced by [CONTACT_15370]’s subjective assessment of the athlete’s on field and academic 
potential.[ADDRESS_1250754]-concussion communication about sport retirement, ensuring that all 
families are informed about relevant risks and benefits of different sport options.

5.1. Study design:8
  
This study  involves the following procedures:
Aim 1 : Survey
Aim 2 : Interviewing (i.e. qualitative) and Usability Testing
Aim 3 : Interviewing (i.e., cognitive, qualitative) and Usability Testing 
Aim 4a  and 4b: Consecutive cohort design (families). Healthcare providers will also complete a 
one-time survey.
  
5.2. Research  procedures:9
  
Aim 1 : Clinicians: This aim will survey clinicians about their current knowledge and belief of 
concussion research, their experiences with discussing return to sport post-concussion with 
families, and their opi[INVESTIGATOR_893028]-making 
aid with families on this topic. Participants will receive a link to an online survey, hosted on a 
survey-hosted site (e.g., REDCap). Before beginning the survey, participants will read an 
information sheet about the study and then proceed to the survey, which will ask them questions 
relating to the topi[INVESTIGATOR_893029]. After completing the survey, participants will be exited 
from the survey and data collection will end for this aim. Survey questions can be found in the 
attachment section on Click.

Parents and  adolescents: This aim will also survey families (one parent and one adolescent) 
about their experiences with discussing return to sport post-concussion and with deciding what 
sports and activities to participate in post-concussion. Parent participants will be contact[CONTACT_893040] a link to an online survey, hosted on a survey-hosted site (e.g., REDCap). 
Before beginning the survey, parents will read an information sheet about the study, indicate 
their agreement to participate and permission for their adolescent to participate, and then 
proceed to the survey, which will ask them questions relating to the topi[INVESTIGATOR_893029]. 
Adolescent participants will follow a similar process and indicate their assent to participate 
before continuing on to the survey. After completing the survey, participants will be exited from 
the survey and data collection will end for this aim. Survey questions can be found in the 
attachment section on Click. Surveys will be completed separately by [CONTACT_137112]. 
Aim 2 : This aim involves semi-structured interviews, and usability testing sessions(i.e., usability 
test interview + tasks) with families (parent and adolescent). as described below. Once a 
participant is enrolled in this aim, participants will participate in either a 60-minute interview (in-
person or online), and/or an in-person or online usability testing session. For semi-structured 
interviews, participants (i.e., parents and adolescents) will review an information sheet about the 
study prior to the interview. Then, they will be interviewed separately about their experiences 
making decisions to resume or stop sport participation after recovery from a sport-related 
concussion. All interview data will be audio recorded. All interviews conducted online will be 
done so through an online platform (i.e., Zoom) and their online session recorded. For in-person 
usability sessions, first, participants (i.e., parent-adolescent dyad) will be given a brief 
demographic questionnaire at the start of the usability testing session. Then, each parent-
adolescent dyad will take their respective decision-making tool. After taking the tool, they will be 
asked questions related to the tool usability. The entire usability testing session will be audio 
recorded. Participants will be given an information sheet about the study at the start (i.e., before 
demographic questionnaire) of the usability testing session. For online usability testing sessions, 
the same procedures will be followed as in person usability sessions, however, participants will 
be emailed the demographic questionnaire and information sheet and they will participate in the 
usability session via an online platform (i.e., Zoom). Their online session will be recorded. All 
documents used in this aim can be found in the attachment section on Click. 
Aim 3 : This aim involves semi-structured interviews, and usability testing with clinicians as 
described below.  Usability testing will be informed by [CONTACT_893041].  Participants (i.e., clinicians) will participate in a 60-
minute interview, either in person or online. Prior to the start of the interview, participants will 
review an information sheet about the study that will either be emailed to them (if session is 
conducted online) or printed and handed in person (if session is conducted in person). Then, 
they will be interviewed (inclusive of cognitive interviewing, qualitative interviewing,) about 
specific clinician feedback on how to create a decision aid effectively for their use. All interview 
data will be audio recorded. All documents used in this aim can be found in the attachment 
section of Click. All interviews conducted online will be done so through an online platform (i.e., 
Zoom) and their online session will be recorded. 
Aim 4a  and b: In the first data collection cohort (Aim 4a), there will be no change to the nature of 
provider communication with families seeking care for their child’s concussion. In the second 
cohort (Aim 4b), the study team will share the respective decision aids with the family and let 
them know to complete them before their appointment. After both the parent and adolescent 
complete their respective decision aids, a member of the study team will insert the clinician tool 
link in the patient’s chart and/or send a message with the link for the clinician to review, prior to 
the appointment.

Aim 1 : Data will be derived from participants (i.e., clinicians – inclusive of pediatricians and 
family medicine providers, parents, adolescents). Data will come from online surveys. All the 
data to be collected is outlined in the enclosed data collection forms and may contain identifiable 
information- such as employment title (clinicians) or number of concussions (adolescents). 
Aim 2 : Data will be derived from participants (i.e., parents, adolescents) who participate in either 
an in person or online interview and/or usability testing session. The source records that will be 
used to collect data from participants (e.g., interview guide, demographic questionnaire, usability 
testing guide, including post task semi-structured interviews) are attached to the Click 
Smartform. Data may contain identifiable information – such as number of concussions and/or 
zip code. The semi-structured interviews and/or usability testing sessions may change iteratively 
based on feedback from participants, but themes explored will remain the same, consistent with 
best practices qualitative data collection. 
Aim 3 : Data will be derived from participants (i.e., clinicians – inclusive of pediatricians and 
family medicine providers) who participate in either in person or online interviews. Data may 
contain identifiable information- such as employment title. The source records that will be used 
to collect data from participants (e.g., demographic questionnaire,, including post task semi-
structured interviews and one-on-one interviews) are attached to the Click Smartform. Data may 
contain identifiable information – such as number of concussions and/or zip code. 
Aims 4a  and 4b: Survey data will be collected from up to 40 families (parent + child) (20 per 
phase) at a minimum of 3 time points: their first visit, after each following visit up to and including 
their final visit, and 3-month follow-up (i.e., 3 months after their initial visit). Data will come from 
online surveys, completed online or in-person while at their visit (e.g., participants will be given a 
tablet to complete while waiting). If participants are not able to complete the relevant surveys in-
person at their visit, they will complete the follow up survey by [CONTACT_756] (call or text linking to a 
survey hosted on REDCap), or by [CONTACT_6968] (linking to a survey hosted on REDCap). Survey data 
will also be collected from up to 20 healthcare providers at one time point (towards the end of 
family data collection) about their experiences using the tool.

10.3. Number  of screened subjects versus the actual number enrolled in the research:31
  
Aim 1 : We estimate that we will need to screen 400 clinicians to enroll 200 eligible participants 
and 400 parent-adolescent dyads to enroll 200 eligible participant dyads.
Aim 2 : We estimate that we will need to screen 80 dyads and/or triads in order to enroll 40 
dyad and/or triad participants.
Aim 3 : We estimate that we will need to screen 40 clinicians to enroll 20 participants.
Aims 4a  and 4b: We estimate that we will need to screen 100 dyads or triads to enroll 40 
eligible participant dyads or triads (20 dyads or triads per phase). We estimate that we will need 
to screen 25 healthcare providers to enroll up to 20 (Aim 4b only). 
  
10.4. Power  analysis:
  
Aim 1 : This data is primarily being assessed for qualitative responses; therefore, no power 
analyses are being assessed.
Aims 2  & 3: This data is primarily qualitative, and thus a power calculation is not appropriate.
Aim 4a  and b:  We anticipate enrolling 20 families per study phase; allowing for 15% attrition 
an estimated [ADDRESS_1250758] ≥80% power to detect a difference in decisional regret (range: 0 to 
100 points) as small as 7.1, 3.0 and 1.2 points, for SD = 12, 5, and 2, respectively. These 
estimates assume an alpha of 0.05 and SD ranging from 1-12. The data from the healthcare 
provider survey is primarily qualitative, and thus a power calculation is not appropriate.

11.3. Procedures  that will be followed when subjects withdraw from the research, including partial 
withdrawal from procedures with continued data collection and withdrawal from 
data/biospecimen banking:
  
Participants may  withdraw from the study at any time by [CONTACT_893042]. Once a 
participant expresses their desire to withdraw, the researcher will terminate data collection. 
The study team will review, on a case-by-case basis, whether partial data collected will be 
used in the analysis. 
  
12. Risks to  Subjects
12.1. Reasonably  foreseeable risks to subjects (include each study population, each arm, and 
optional procedures): 
  
This study  involves no more than minimal risk to participants. Potential risks include the risk of 
loss of confidentiality and the following:
Aim 1:  Testing burden – participants may experience inconvenience associated with 
answering survey questions.
Aims 2  & 3: Loss of confidentiality – participants may provide identifiable information 
about themselves, and in the case of parents, their adolescent. 
Aims 4a  and 4b: Testing burden- participants may experience inconvenience associated 
with answering survey questions; Loss of confidentiality—participants may provide 
identifiable information about themselves, and in the case of parents, their adolescent 
  
12.2. Procedures  with unforeseeable risks:
  
N/A –  there are no procedures that pose unforeseeable risks.   
  
12.3. Procedures  with risks to an embryo or fetus should the subject be or become 
pregnant:

Page 14  of 35
There is  no anticipated benefit of participating in this study. 
  
14. Data  Analysis/Management
14.1. Data  analysis plan, including statistical procedures:
  
Aim 1 : Survey responses will be reviewed with a focus on the psychometric properties of 
items and scales (e.g., how are items distributed), as well as evaluate what answers are 
correlated. We will compare responses across key characteristics (e.g., clinician 
characteristics, beliefs) to determine what key beliefs and feedback are across all clinicians, 
parents, and adolescents. 
Aim 2  & 3: Thematic analysis will be used to systematically code transcripts and identify 
emergent themes. Qualitative data will be digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim and 
coded for relevant themes using a thematic analysis approach. Coded segments may be 
entered into a qualitative coding software (e.g., Dedoose) to facility analysis or will be 
analyzed by [CONTACT_893043]. Data will continue to be conducted until emergent results 
iteratively inform and clarify the final version of the decision aids. 
Aim 4a  and b:  We will compare socio-demographic (e.g. age, sex, health literacy) and clinical 
characteristics (e.g. concussion history and severity at baseline) between the control and 
intervention groups. Differences in primary decision process and quality outcomes will be 
compared between treatment and control conditions using Structural Equation Modeling, 
where parent and child measures will be examined in parallel. Family level non-independence 
will be modeled by [CONTACT_893044](s) and child measures. Outcomes will 
be pooled across the retirement recommended and equipoise conditions as decision process 
and quality measures are equally relevant in both conditions. Secondary analyses related to 
health behaviors (contact [CONTACT_893045]) and health status outcomes 
at Time 3 will be compared between treatment and control conditions using logistic regression. 
Dyadic and triadic analyses. Dyadic/triadic concordance will first be described using 
contingency tables. Next, actor-partner interdependence models will be used to assess the 
effects of each family member’s decision process measures on their own decision quality 
measures and the rest of the family’s decision quality measures (“partner” effects). Healthcare 
provider survey responses will be reviewed and compared to determine key beliefs and 
feedback across all healthcare providers. 
  
14.2. Quality  control procedures for collected data:[ADDRESS_1250759] will train any research assistant(s) and 
additional study team members on best practices for qualitative and quantitative data 
collection through workshops, practice interviews, and/or individual supervision. As an 
additional quality check, interviews will be audio-recorded and reviewed regularly to ensure 
high-quality data collection methods are used.
 
15. Confidentiality  and Privacy34
15.1. Procedures  to secure the data and/or biospecimens during storage, use, and transmission:
  
During data collection,  all research materials containing personally identifiable information will 
be kept in a locked container or on a secure password protected server while not in use. 
Any data  collected via survey will be collected by [CONTACT_893046] (e.g., 
REDCap). Survey data will only be accessible to members of the study team. All survey data 
will be password protected and the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_893030].

Page 15  of 35
Information collected  and/or presented via the decision aids (parent, adolescent, clinician) will 
be housed on it’s own website (valuedaction.com). ). All traffic to and from the Valued Action 
site is encrypted via SSL. All users of Valued Action have access only to their own or relevant 
data (as defined by [CONTACT_893047]). Healthcare professionals can only access 
summary data relating to their patients. Direct database access is restricted to a local subnet, 
accessible only with a private key. All data is stored encrypted at rest. Every effort has been 
made to minimize the data stored, to only include data points specifically required to achieve 
the project goals.
As noted,  any data that is collected via recording will be kept on password protected devices 
(i.e., the audio recordings will be on a password protected device). All interviews conducted in 
person will be recorded via a normal recording device not connected to the internet (either 
password protected or secured in a locked cabinet if not password protected) and all 
interviews conducted online will be recorded via the online platform (i.e. Zoom) and all data 
will be secured on Seattle Children’s servers. Transcribed audio-recorded interviews will be 
de-identified and stored on the secure Seattle Children’s servers, accessible only to the study 
team; a numeric code will be used to link audio interviews to participants.. Only coded 
segments (without identifiers) of recordings may be entered into a qualitative data software 
(e.g., Dedoose). The link between study code and participant information will be kept in a 
password-protected file, separate from the research data, and overseen by [CONTACT_9532] [INVESTIGATOR_893031]. Data will not be transported outside of Seattle 
Children’s, unless data is being transmitted to contracted transcriptionists to transcribe audio 
data. 
When conducting  study procedures online (i.e., interviews, usability testing), we will be using 
the latest version of Zoom, make the meetings private, require passwords for meeting entry, 
disabling private chat, and consent will be obtained prior to recording.  We will utilize the 
screen sharing function to share instruments (e.g., decision aids) with participants for 
feedback in interviews, usability testing sessions, etc. The original versions of the decision 
aids (that will be iteratively adapted throughout testing) to be shared have been uploaded to 
the Click platform.
After data  is collected, any information which would identify the participant(s) will be removed 
and code numbers used instead. All identifiers will be destroyed within 6 months of completion 
of data collection. 
All recorded data  will be recorded on one of the following: 1) virtually through Zoom (Aims 1-[ADDRESS_1250760] participation online); 2) normal recording device that is not 
connected to the internet (Aims 1-3 if conducted in person). 
  
15.2. Steps  that will be taken to protect the privacy interests of subjects:[ADDRESS_1250761] protected REDCap projects accessible only to members of 
the study team, secure Seattle Children’s servers and/or in locked containers at Seattle 
Children’s Research Institute. Participant identifiers will be kept in these secure storage 
options as well. Additionally, all interviews will take place either online, or at a location 
preferred by [CONTACT_893048] a private location at a Seattle Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_514744]/or affiliated clinic. If participating at a Seattle Children’s clinic, all participants will already

be affiliated  with that clinic, as they will be attending it for an appointment. Private locations 
that are preferred by [CONTACT_893049], as well as privacy. 
  
15.3. Location  where the data and/or biospecimens will be stored:  
Data will  be stored on secure password protected REDCap projects, Seattle Children’s 
servers and/or in locked containers at Seattle Children’s Research Institute.
  
15.4. Length  of time data and/or biospecimens will be stored:
  
Data will  be stored for 5 years.
  
15.5. Individuals  with access to data and/or biospecimens:
  
Data will  only be accessible to the study team members, as specified by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_893032]. 
  
15.6. Process  for the transmission of data and/or biospecimens outside Seattle Children’s:
15.6.1. List  of data and/or biospecimens that will be transmitted:
  
Electronic data may  be transmitted, and if so, it will only be transmitted if all data has 
been de-identified. 
  
15.6.2. Individual(s) who will transmit  data:
  
If any  identifiable data is to be transported, it will be stored in a locked container until it 
returns to Seattle Children’s Research Institute. Study team members will make every 
attempt to remove any identifiable information before transporting data. Study team 
members may transmit de-identified data electronically.

such as Facebook  and/or newsletters). We will also post widely on other websites, such as 
www.craigslist.org and community forums/Facebook groups such as the West Seattle Blog 
and others.
  
17.2. Measures  in place to protect the privacy or confidentiality of subjects:38
  
Social media  will only be used for advertising recruitment materials approved for the study. We 
will only communicate basic study information with potential participants (i.e. what’s in the 
relevant aim’s information sheet) and let them know they must contact [CONTACT_893050]. 
  
17.3. Types of  communications that will be submitted to the IRB for review:[ADDRESS_1250762] safety and study integrity:
  
 Comment  functions will be enabled. If any questions are asked, we will provide responses in 
line with what is included in the relevant aim’s information sheet and encourage the individual 
to reach out to the study team. After recruitment, we will update the post that recruitment is 
complete and disable the comment function. 
  
18. Research  Related Injury40  
18.1. Available  compensation in the event of research related injury:
  
N/A –  there are no expected events of research that would relate or result in injury.
  
19. Recruitment  Methods41
19.1. When,  where, and how potential subjects will be recruited:
  
Aim 1 : 
Clinicians:
When: We  plan to begin recruitment as soon as the study is approved
Where: We  plan to recruit clinicians who work in pediatric sports medicine and have 
experience treating youth with concussions 
How: We  hope to recruit clinicians (inclusive of pediatricians and family medicine providers) 
through convenience and/or snowball sampling, and chart screening. We will begin recruiting 
clinicians from our own colleague referrals. After, we may utilize emails or web posting to 
additionally reach out to clinicians. We may send up to two recruitment emails per subject.
Parents and  adolescents : 
When: We  plan to begin recruitment as soon as the study is approved
Where: We  plan to recruit participants from chart screening, self-referral, and/or clinician 
referral who have attended Seattle Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3491]/or an affiliated clinic during the last 
five years to be seen after sustaining at least one concussion.
How: We  plan on asking Seattle Children’s clinicians, an approved Seattle Children’s medical 
professional (with approval), or an approved Seattle Children’s entity (i.e. Clinical Data 
Analytics) to review patient charts on our behalf (note: we will not be reviewing patient charts 
ourselves, rather,  through a clinician or other staff) to suggest participants for our study. 
Potential parent participants will first be provided with a written (mailed) letter than contains a 
QR code or a link for a survey (attached to the Click Smartform), and then subsequently

contact[CONTACT_893051] (call or text message). Once parents agree to participate and give 
parental permission, adolescents will be sent the survey via text or email.  
Aim 2 : 
When: We  plan to begin recruitment as soon as the study begins, possibly collecting data 
concurrently with Aim 1. 
Where: We  plan to recruit participants from chart screening, self-referral, and/or clinician 
referral who have sustained a lease one concussion during the last three years. 
How: 
We hope to  recruit parents, adolescents, and possibly their clinicians (inclusive of pediatricians 
and family medicine providers) through self-referral, convenience and/or snowball sampling. 
We plan on asking Seattle Children’s clinicians, an approved Seattle Children’s medical 
professional (with approval), or an approved Seattle Children’s entity (i.e. Clinical Data 
Analytics) to review patient charts on our behalf (note: we will not be reviewing patient charts 
ourselves, rather,  through a clinician or other staff) to suggest participants for our study. When 
we contact [CONTACT_42148], we will ask the following questions to confirm they meet 
inclusion criteria: (1) child’s age, (2) number of concussions, and (3) if child made a decision 
about return to sport as a result of their most recent concussion. We also hope to recruit 
participants from eligible survey participants in Aim 1 or Aim 4 who indicate they would be 
interested in participating in a qualitative interview about their experiences and/or usability 
testing session (after they have completed their time in their respective aim). We also will 
utilize contacts with coaches and community organizations (e.g., King County Play Equity 
Coalition, Greater Seattle Soccer League) to advertise and/or distribute our recruitment flyer in 
order to recruit individuals who sustained concussions and sought care outside of Seattle 
Children’s. This flyer will include ways to get in contact [CONTACT_9881], including a link to 
a contact [CONTACT_893052] 
(please see “Aim 2 Recruitment Flyer” and “Aim [ADDRESS_1250763] Form” for details). We may also 
post a brief summary of the study and a link to the contact [CONTACT_893053] (see 
section 17 above). We may also utilize snowball sampling and ask participants if they would 
be willing to forward the recruitment email to anyone they know who they think would be 
interested (see “Aim 2 Usability Testing Guide” for how we will phrase the question). We will 
begin recruiting clinicians from our own colleague referrals. These clinicians can help identify 
clinicians for us to reach out to who work with our desired population. After, we may utilize 
emails or web posting to additionally reach out to participants, including flyers and parent 
recruitment emails. We may send up to two recruitment emails per subject. For parent 
participants without email addresses available, we will first provide them with a written (mailed) 
letter and subsequently contact [CONTACT_525739] (call or text message).
Aim 3 : 
When: We  plan to begin recruitment after the completion of Aim 1.
Where: We  plan to recruit clinicians who work in pediatric sports medicine and have 
experience treating youth with concussions
How: We  hope to recruit clinicians (inclusive of pediatricians and family medicine providers) 
through convenience and/or snowball sampling, and chart screening. We plan on asking 
clinicians or approved Seattle Children’s medical professionals (with approval) to review 
patient charts on our behalf (note: we will not be reviewing patient charts ourselves, rather, 
through a  clinician or their staff) to suggest clinicians who treat our desired patient participant 
population for our study. We will begin recruiting clinicians from our own colleague referrals.

Aim 4a:
When: We  plan to begin recruitment as soon as the study begins
Where: We  plan to recruit participants from Seattle Children’s Sport Medicine 
How: We  hope to recruit families through chart screening. The study team will review the 
providers’ schedules and identify patients who are being seen for sports-related concussions. 
Eligible families will be contact[CONTACT_893054], inviting them to participate. If interested, 
parents will be prompted to review a REDCap link with study documentation and fill out a 
contact [CONTACT_982]. Parents will have the option to speak with a member of the research team before 
agreeing to participate.. We may send up to three recruitment texts or emails per subject. 
Whenever possible, we will first contact [CONTACT_893055], which is important when upcoming appointments may be within 
the same week. However, our partners in sports medicine have told us that parent emails are 
not always in the patient’s chart. In the case email is not available, we will contact [CONTACT_893056].   
Aim 4b:  
When: We  plan to begin recruitment as soon as the study intervention (i.e. the decision aids) 
is developed based on feedback in Aims 2 and 3
Where: We  plan to recruit participants from Seattle Children’s Sport Medicine 
How: We  hope to recruit families through chart screening. We will follow the same process 
outlined above in Aim 4a. A purposive subset of healthcare providers who are exposed to the 
tool (i.e., their patient was enrolled in the study) will be invited via email to complete a brief 
survey.   
  
19.2. Steps that  will be taken to protect potential subjects’ privacy during the recruitment process:42
For all aims: Prior to accessing the survey, participants will receive information about the 
purpose of the study and eligibility criteria for the study. They will be informed that all 
participation is voluntary and confidential (depending on aim). Recruitment will always occur in 
a private location (i.e., participants will receive information online and can look at it when they 
prefer or will be spoken to in private locations when they prefer). 
19.3. Sources  of subjects:43  
Seattle Children’s  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Seattle Children’s Research Institute, Seattle Children’s affiliated 
clinic, Seattle community organizations (parents and adolescents only) and/or other nationally 
recognized sports medicine programs (clinicians only). See section 19.1 for additional details 
by [CONTACT_45061].
  
19.4. Methods that will  be used to identify potential subjects:
  
Snowball sampling,  Convenience Sampling, Self-referral, Clinician referral, and/or Chart 
Screening.

19.6. Recruitment  methods not controlled by [CONTACT_47255]’s:
  
N/A  
  
20. Consent/Assent  Process
Consent/assent process  overview:45
Aims 1-3: Consent materials (and the assent form when applicable) will be attached to recruitment emails 
and/or sent with recruitment letters.  Additionally, after initial contact [CONTACT_893057], a link to 
REDCap, which will include the consent and assent materials appropriate to the given populations and 
aims, is emailed to participants prior to when their interviews/usability testing sessions occur.   This 
strategy ensures that consent and assent forms will be presented to potential participants before they 
complete any study procedures. 
In-person participants  will be emailed consent materials (and the assent form when applicable) as an 
attachment to recruitment emails. Additionally, after initial contact [CONTACT_893057], a link to 
REDcap, which will include the consent and assent materials appropriate to the given populations and 
aims, is emailed to participants prior to when their usability testing sessions occur. When we meet in-
person with the participant before their usability testing session, they will additionally be given a hard copy 
of the consent (and assent when applicable) forms.
Aim 4:  Consent/assent materials will be included in the REDCap link that will be attached to recruitment 
emails/texts and/or sent to parents via mail or email prior to consent. Additionally, consent and assent 
materials appropriate to the given populations will be included at the beginning of the first REDCap 
survey sent to participants, which will ensure that consent and assent forms will be presented to potential 
participants before they complete any study procedures. Similar procedures will be followed for 
healthcare providers (i.e., the information sheet will be attached to recruitment emails and will be included 
at the beginning of the REDCap survey).  
 
20.1. Where  the consent/assent process will take place:
  
Aim 1 : Consent will take place online, prior to the start of participation.  See section above for 
details..
Aims 2  & 3: Consent will take place either in person or online prior to the start of the 
interviews and/or usability testing sessions by [CONTACT_893058]. 
See section above for details.  All interviews and usability testing consenting will take place 
online (if conducted online) or at a private location preferred by [CONTACT_2299] (if conducted in 
person).  Before any research procedures begin (online or in person), the team member 
conducting the interview and/or usability session will explain that the participant may choose to 
skip any questions they do not want to answer, and they may discontinue the research study 
at any time. Every study team member will take steps to make the interview and usability 
session feel like a conversation, based on supervision and training from the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_893034]. 
Aim 4a  and 4b: All participants will review an information sheet online and have the option to 
consent/assent online or verbally during a phone call with a study team member, prior to the

consenting/assenting will take place online.  
Aims 2  & 3: All interviews and usability testing consenting will take place either online or at a 
private location preferred by [CONTACT_2299]. 
Aim4a: All  consenting will take place over the phone or online. If the participant wishes to 
speak to a study team member, the participant will be informed of the call beforehand so they 
can speak in a private location of their choosing. 
  
20.3. Waiting  period available between approaching a prospective subject and obtaining 
consent/assent:

20.8.5. Procedures  for obtaining and documenting assent:
  
Aim 1,  2, & 4: Children 13 and older will review an information sheet online on the 
survey hosting platform (e.g., REDCap). An assent form will be reviewed by [CONTACT_893060] 13 years. An opportunity to ask questions with a study team 
member will be provided to the adolescent. Additionally, the information sheet 
provided to the adolescent will be the same one provided to their parent, so both are 
able to read in detail about the adolescent’s ability to assent to participate in this 
study and ask questions. All contact [CONTACT_893061] (and 
in the event a child fills out the contact [CONTACT_893062] 2, we will specifically ask for 
parent contact [CONTACT_893063]), and links to REDCap are sent directly to 
parents, so parents will ultimately have control over whether or not their kids are 
permitted to enroll. Furthermore, parents who enroll electronically in Aim 4a must 
provide consent and parental permission before adolescents are approached (see 
Instrument #[ADDRESS_1250766] Mock-up). Survey links will only be sent to 
adolescents once their parent submits this form confirming their own agreement to 
participate and permission for their child to participate. 
Aim 3:  N/A 
  
20.8.6. Plan  for re-approaching children who have reached the age of majority to obtain

Process of  documenting consent:67
 
N/A, Consent  will not be documented in writing.  We are requesting a waiver of documentation 
of consent.  
Clinicians: do  not typi[INVESTIGATOR_893035] a process like this (surveys,

or clinical context.
Parents & Children:  no information will be provided in the clinical context for this population, 
and they do not typi[INVESTIGATOR_893036] (answer questions in an interview or survey, offer opi[INVESTIGATOR_893037]).

22. HIPAA  Authorization and RCW Criteria
22.1. HIPAA Authorization  (check all boxes that apply):
☐ The study does  not involve the receipt, creation, use and/or disclosure of protected health 
information (PHI).71
☐ HIPAA authorization will  be obtained as part of a signed consent form. 
☒ The study will access  PHI without prior authorization from subjects (including for 
recruitment purposes – e.g., reviewing the medical record to determine eligibility).  See 
21.2 below for required HIPAA waiver/alteration criteria.
☒ Subjects  will review a written statement/information sheet with the appropriate HIPAA 
language but will not provide a written signature.  See 22.2 below for required HIPAA 
alteration criteria.72
☐ Other.  Explain:73
  
22.2. HIPAA Waiver/Alteration  Criteria: 74  
22.2.1. Reasons  for requesting a waiver or alteration of HIPAA Authorization: 
We may utilize chart screening as a way to identify and recruit participants. As such, 
we will need to review medical records to determine eligibility for this study. For aims 
1-3, we plan on asking Seattle Children’s clinicians, an approved Seattle Children’s 
medical professional, or approved Seattle Children’s entity (i.e. Clinical Data 
Analytics) to review patient charts on our behalf to suggest participants for our

study. For  Aim 4, the study team will be reviewing provider schedules and patient 
charts to determine eligibility for the study and to ensure participants are sent and/or 
respond to subsequent surveys at the appropriate time (e.g., after a follow-up visit). 
Additionally, we may obtain PHI that pertain to potential participants (i.e., their 
contact [CONTACT_893065]) prior to when they are enrolled. Some PHI may 
be also collected via our selected survey hosting platform (e.g., REDcap). 
We are  also requesting a written signature [CONTACT_893070] 1, [ADDRESS_1250770] to participate online for this aim, making collection 
of written signatures difficult – particularly in the current environment of government 
ordered shelter in place orders - therefore written signature [CONTACT_893071]. Some PHI may be collected during this Aim via our selected survey hosting 
platform (e.g., REDcap) such as zip codes and number of concussions incurred in 
the past.
22.2.2. The use or  disclosure of PHI involves no more than a minimal risk to privacy of 
individuals, based  on, at least the presence of the following elements:
[IP_ADDRESS]. An  adequate plan to protect the identifiers from improper use and 
disclosure: 
  
The following  information applies to both the waiver of HIPAA needed for 
screening medical records and the waiver of written consent: The study 
team affirms that there is an adequate plan in place to protect identifiers 
from improper use and disclosure. All study data will be stored on secure 
servers requiring password access on Seattle Children’s servers. 
Participant names, if collected, will be stored in a separate password 
protected file accessible only to study staff under the supervision of the 
Principle Investigator and study Research Scientist.
  
[IP_ADDRESS]. An  adequate plan to destroy identifiers at earliest opportunity consistent 
with conduct of research:
  
The following  information applies to both the waiver of HIPAA needed for 
screening medical records and the waiver of written consent: All PHI and 
identifiers will be destroyed at the earliest opportunity consistent with the 
research protocol. We anticipate that this will mean destroying PHI and 
identifiers within 9 months of completion of data collection. If a participant 
chooses not to participate, identifiers will be destroyed within one week.
  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Assurances  that PHI will not be reused or disclosed to any other party or 
entity, except as required by [CONTACT_733067]:
  
The following  information applies to both the waiver of HIPAA needed for 
screening medical records and the waiver of written consent: The PHI 
will not be reused or disclosed to any other person or entity, except as 
required by [CONTACT_2371], for authorized oversight of the research study, or for 
other research for which the use or disclosure of protected health 
information for which an authorization or opportunity to agree or object is 
not required.

22.2.3. The research could  not practicably be conducted without the waiver or alteration of 
authorization:
  
We are  requesting a waiver of HIPAA because we will not be able to obtain written 
signature [CONTACT_893072] a limited set of 
information about potential participants to be used to determine whether or not they 
meet study eligibility criteria. It is not practical to get HIPAA authorization prior to 
accessing records for screening because it would make recruitment extremely 
challenging if we are unable to target participants. Additionally, due to COVID-19 
concerns, we plan on recruiting and enrolling participants remotely to minimize the 
possibility of transmission of the virus, which makes obtaining written signatures on 
an authorization of HIPAA form extremely challenging..
  
22.2.4. The research could  not practicably be conducted without access to and use of the 
PHI:75
  
The PHI  collected during screening activities is necessary for the research. The 
research cannot be practicably conducted without the alteration because access to 
and use of PHI is necessary for screening purposes and given the number of 
potential participants and that they are spread across the Puget Sound region and 
potentially beyond, should gatekeeper and snowball recruitment result in self-
referral of participants.
Regarding the alteration  of the signature [CONTACT_39530], the clinical nature of the study 
requires that some minimal health information about subjects is included in the data 
that will be collected. 
  
23. Payments/Costs  to Subjects76
23.1. Amount,  method, and timing of payments to subjects:77
  
Aim 1 : For Seattle Children’s employees not paid through Seattle Children’s payroll, a gift card 
will be provided to each survey participant. The gift card will be $25 and will come through the 
form of a Seattle Children’s gift card. Participants will receive their gift card in the mail at the 
completion of their survey and after we receive a de-identified list of names and addresses of 
those who participated in the survey. Participant compensation for Seattle Children’s 
employees will be paid to their paycheck following receiving a de-identified list from the survey 
hosing site (i.e., survey responses will not be linked to names).For parent and adolescent 
participants, each population will be told that they will be entered for a chance to receive one 
of four $[ADDRESS_1250771] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_893039]. 
Aim 2 : A gift card will be provided to each interview and/or usability testing participant (i.e. if a 
participant completes both tasks, they will a gift card each time). The gift cards will be $50 and 
will come through the form of a Seattle Children’s gift card. Participants will receive their gift 
card in the mail or via email at the completion of their interview and/or usability testing 
session.. 
Aim 3 : For Seattle Children’s employees not paid through Seattle Children’s payroll and non-
Seattle Children’s employees, a gift card will be provided to each interview and/or usability 
testing participant. The gift cards will be $[ADDRESS_1250772] in the mail or via email at the completion of their

Washington is  18; however, sometimes younger children have ability to consent for certain types of care (e.g. sexual 
reproduction/health; mental health; drug/alcohol treatment).  For research conducted outside of the state, provide 
information that describes which persons have not attained the legal age for consent to treatments or procedures 
involved the research, under the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which research will be conducted. One method of 
obtaining this information is to have a legal counsel or authority review your protocol along the definition of “children” 
in “SOP: Legally Authorized Representatives, Children, and Guardians (HRP-013).”  If the sites in other states in the 
study are conducting their own IRB review, you do not need to worry about this--type N/A.  If you are conducting 
research and are actively recruiting participants outside of Washington who are NOT coming to SCH to give consent 
and who will be covered under SCH IRB approval, this section should be addressed in your protocol.
[ADDRESS_1250793] of benefit, the IRB generally 
requires one parent to provide permission for the child to participate.
53 If parental permission will not be obtained, please address this in the Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process 
below.
54 See HRP-013 for more information.
55 The IRB generally follows the following guidelines for written assent: children 7-12 should provide written assent on 
the “simple” assent form (HRP-502G); children 13-17 should provide written assent by [CONTACT_3252]-signing the parental 
permission form (HRP-502A).  The IRB will consider other assent scenarios (e.g. verbal assent for some or all 
children; not requiring assent for some or all children; or waiving assent): please provide details about the plan for 
your study.  See HRP-090 and HRP-416 for more information on waiving assent and when assent is not necessary.
56 See Appendix A-13 of the Investigator Manual HRP-103 for requirements for re-consent at age 18.  If you think you 
meet the conditions for a waiver at 18, please address this in the Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process below.
57 See “HRP-417 Cognitively Impaired Adults” for further information.  
58 For example: durable power of attorney for health care, court appointed guardian for health care decisions, spouse, 
and adult child.  If you are following HRP-013 in order to make this determination, simply state that in this section. For 
research conducted in the state, review “SOP: Legally Authorized Representatives, Children, and Guardians (HRP-
013)” to be aware of which individuals in the state meet the definition of “legally authorized representative.” For 
research conducted outside of the state, provide information that describes which individuals are authorized under 
applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective subject to their participation in the procedure(s) involved in this 
research. One method of obtaining this information is to have a legal counsel or authority review your protocol along 
the definition of “legally authorized representative” in “SOP: Legally Authorized Representatives, Children, and 
Guardians (HRP-013).”  If the sites in other states in the study are conducting their own IRB review, you do not need 
to worry about this--type N/A.  If you are conducting research and are actively recruiting participants outside of 
Washington who are NOT coming to Washington to give consent and who will be covered under SCH IRB approval, 
this section should be addressed in your protocol.
59 The IRB may allow the person obtaining assent to document assent on the consent document.
60 Provide justifications/explanations for each subject population for which a waiver/alteration is being requested.  
61 For example: consent/parental permission will not be obtained, required information will not be disclosed, the 
research involves deception, waiver for participants who turn 18, waiver for information collected about a non-present 
parent, or other waivers as necessary.
62 The IRB needs to make all the waiver findings and key to this determination is that the IRB understand why it is not 
practicable to do the research without a waiver of consent.  You need to provide a rationale in order for the IRB to 
consider whether the waiver criteria are met. See “HRP-410: Waiver or Alteration of the Consent Process” for further 
information.

63 Possible reasons might include: a) you are not collecting information that could put subjects or their families at 
harm, e.g., affect eligibility for insurance, employability, stigmatization; b) you are not collecting information that would 
alter or affect the subject’s care; c) any publication or presentation of research results would be done in a manner that 
would never reveal an individual’s identity either directly or indirectly.
64 Possible reasons could be: a) inability to locate families because of the lengthy time period over which the 
records/samples were created; b) many of the subjects whose records, data, or biospecimens will be used may have 
died and contact[CONTACT_47267]; c) all eligible patients 
must be included in the study for the results to be meaningful.
65 For example, identifiers are necessary, so that researchers can perform quality checks or identifiers are necessary 
to link data from multiple sources.
66 See “HRP 419: Waiver of Consent for Emergency Research” for further information.
67 This section describes the ways in which the procedures will not be following Seattle Children’s SOP.

[ADDRESS_1250794] demonstrate that the electronic consent 
signatures are compliant with applicable state/international law (in Washington, see RCW 19.34.300 ).  
73 For example: altering HIPAA elements for international research.
74 Provide justifications/explanations for each subject population for which a waiver/alteration is being requested.  
75 Possible reason could be: the nature of the research is specific to individuals’ health and requires access to 
individuals’ health records.
76 See “HRP-316: Payments” for further information.

81 Provide enough information to convince the IRB that  the principal and/or co-investigator(s) are appropriately 
qualified to conduct and supervise the proposed research. When applicable, describe their prior clinical experience 
with the test article or study-related procedures, or describe their knowledge of the local study sites, culture, and 
society. 
82 For example, as appropriate: (1) Justify the feasibility of recruiting the required number of suitable subjects within 
the agreed recruitment period. For example, how many potential subjects do you have access to? What percentage 
of those potential subjects do you need to recruit? (2) Describe the time that you will devote to conducting and 
completing the research. (3) Describe the facilities in which the research will be conducted. (4) Describe the 
availability of medical or psychological resources that subjects might need as a result of an anticipated consequences 
of the human research. (5) Describe your process to ensure that all persons assisting with the research are 
adequately informed about the protocol, the research procedures, and their duties and functions.

Study Design
This is an open -label, single -arm, multicenter, Phase 1b/[ADDRESS_1164389] cancer 
previously treated with 0 to 2 lines of systemic anticancer therapy (cytotoxic or targeted anticancer 
agents) in the metastatic setting.  Subjects may have receive d prior neo /adjuvant chemotherapy.  
The Phase 1b part includes [ADDRESS_1164390] 6 subjects will receive 
eribulin mesylate 1.4 mg/m2intravenously ( IV)on Days 1 and 8 of a 21- day cycle and 
pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on Day 1 o f a 21 -day cycle ( Dose Level 1).  Dose -limiting toxicity 
(DLT) will be assessed in the first cycle.  Dose level 1 can be selected as the recommended Phase 2 
dose (RP2D) if no more than [ADDRESS_1164391] has a DLT.  Otherwise, eribulin mesylate dose will be 
lower edfrom 1.4 mg/ m2to 1.1 mg/ m2on Days 1 and 8 of a 21 -day cycle ( Dose Level 0).  If no 
more tha n 1 out of 6 subjects at Dose Level 0 has a DLT, the Phase 2 part will proceed with Dose 
Level 0.  Approximately 12 subjects may be enrolled in the Phase 1b part of the study .  
As of Protocol Amendment 05, t he RP2D was determined to be eribulin 1.4 mg/m2IV 
administered on Day 1 and Day 8 of each 21 -day cycle with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV 
administered on Day 1 of each 21 -day cycle.
Under Protocol Amendment 1, 107 subjects (including subjects in Phase 1b who are on RP2D 
level) wereenrolled in 2strata and receive dthe same combination treatment at the RP2D level.  
The strata include no prior systemic anticancer therapy in the metastatic setting ( Stratum 1) and 
previously treated with 1 to 2 lines of systemic anticancer therapy in the metastatic setting 
(Stratum 2). Bayesian predictive probability (PP) of response rate wasused to monitor the 
response rate after postbaseline tumor assessments for at least 38 subjects were available.  The 
study could be stopped early for efficacy or futility if PP crosses the prespecified boundary.  
Hence, efficacy conclusion of the primary efficacy endpoint of ORR could be made on the basis of 
the predictive probability prior to the full enrollment of 100evaluable subjects in the study (see 
Statistical Methods for details). 
Ther e is clinical interest to have a more precise estimation of th e efficacy data for Stratum 2.  
Ther efore, per Protocol Amendment 3, additional subjects will be added to Stratum 2 in order to 
include
atotal of80evaluable subjects in Stratum 2 for final analysis.   As a result, approximately 
150subjects in total (145 evaluable with 80 in Stratum 2) will be enrolled. Per Protocol 
Amendment 4, 20 additional subjects will be added to Stratum 2 in order to include a total of at

Follow -Up asessments inthe Posttreatment Phase will no longer need to be performed.
Number of Subjects
A total of approximately 170adult female or male subjects previously treated with 0 to 2 lines of 
systemic anticancer therapy in the metastatic setting will be enrolled (including at least 6 subjects 
from the Phase 1b part) .  It is estimated that 165of the 170subjects will be evaluable for the

Dose Delays and Modifications: Dose delays and modifications for toxicities associated with 
eribulin mesylate and pembrolizumab are described in detail in Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Section [IP_ADDRESS] , 
respectively .  
Duration of Treatment
Subjects will be treated with eribulin mesylate and pembrolizumab and can remain on one or both 
study drugs in the presence of clinical benefit until intercurrent illness, unacceptable toxicity, or 
disease progression occurs, or until the subject withdraws consent.
For su bjects experiencing prolonged clinical benefit, temporary interruption (up to 3months) of 
study treatment may be permitted after discussion with the treating physician and the sponsor.   
After such interruption, investigators are strongly encouraged to res can the subject to rule out 
interim progression of disease.
Subjects can receive up to 35 treatments (approximately 2 years) with pembrolizumab. During that 
time, subjects may continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of 
consen t, physician's decision to stop therapy for the subject , or sponsor’s decision to terminate the 
study. 
Discontinuation of treatment may be considered for subjects who have attained a confirmed CR 
that have been treated for at least 8 cycles (24 weeks) wit h pembrolizumab and had at least 
2treatments with pembrolizumab beyond the date when the initial CR was declared.
After the last subject has completed 35 cycles of pembrolizumab or has discontinued 
pembrolizumab for other reasons , all ongoing subjects will be transitioned off study .  Subjects still 
receiving eribulin monotherapy at thistime may continue to receive eribulin treatment off study 
through their pharmacy (if commercially available for that individual subject) or through a patient 
assistance program administered by [CONTACT_456].   Subjects will continue to receive eribulin

study treatment (or sooner if there is evidence of progressive disease) using consistent imaging 
methodology (ie, computed tomography [ CT] scan/magnetic resonance imaging [ MRI ]or bone 
scan and consistent use or nonuse of c ontrast media).  In subjects who discontinue study therapy 
without documented disease progression, every effort should be made to continue monitoring their 
disease status by [CONTACT_70706] 9 weeks ± 1week during Year 1, and every 9to 12 
weeks ± [ADDRESS_1164402] of care ,until (1) the start of new anticancer 
treatment, (2) disease progression (3) death, or (4) the end of the study, whichever occurs first. In 
addition, overall survival (OS) status (disposition) will be asse ssed throughout the study.   
Treat ment After Initial Radiologic Progression
Pembr olizumab, like other immunotherapeutic agents, may produce antitumor effects by 
[CONTACT_134981] -specific immune responses.  The response patterns seen with such
an approach may extend beyond the typi[INVESTIGATOR_838334], and can manifest as a clinical response after an initial increase in tumor burden or even the 
appearance of new lesions .

Efficacy Analyses
Primary Efficacy
Approximately 165evaluable subjects on RP2D will be enrolled in the study , including phase 1b 
and 2 .
Bayesian Predictive Probability (PP) design was used in original study design .Under original 
design, i nthe combined Stratum [ADDRESS_1164410] 1.1 by I IRwas 
assumed to be 0.20 for the historical control based on the recent studies (Table 1). The ORR in this 
study is estimated to be 0.35. Under protocol amendment 1, approximately [ADDRESS_1164411] 1.1 by 
[CONTACT_838355]. The calculation of PP is based on the 
goal of claiming superiority of the comb i
nation at the end of the study if
                                  P(p>0. 2|data) ≥0.95     (1)
wher e p wasthe response rate of the comb ination , 0.2 wasthe response rate of historical control, 
based on single -agent pembrolizumab and eribulin mesylate in recent studies ; 0.95 wasthe 
prespecified target probability (θ T) and P(p>0.2|data) wasthe posterior probability.  On the basis of 
the accumulated data thus far in the study, the probabilities of all possible future outcomes that lead 
to equation (1) at the end of the study would be added in order to obtain the predictive probability. 
Ther efore, early decision of study termination prior to reaching approximately 100 evaluable 
subjects was possible for claiming the combination is promising when PP is ab ove a prespecified 
upper threshold (θ U) or for claiming futility when PP is below a prespecified lower threshold (θ L).  
The upper and lower cutoff probabilities for decision making, θ Uand θ L, wer eset as 0.99 and 
0.025. Under the predictive monitoring, the study proceed edas follows:
If PP> θ U(=0.99), stop the study and claim the comb ination promising
If PP< θ L(=0.025), stop the study and claim the comb ination not promising

Final Analysis
Inall evaluable subjects (i.e., Stratum 1 and 2 ), Bayesian Posterior probability in equation (1) will 
be evaluated to determine the efficacy after the tumor response status has been collected from the 
last evaluable subjects. That is, to claim efficacy if P (p>0.2|data) ≥0.95 . A 2-sided 95% c redible 
interval of objective response rate in the evaluable subjects will be constructed to aid the 
interpretation of the results Details of predictive and posterior probabilities calculation will be 
provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
In the evaluable Stratum 2subjects , a binomial exact test will be used to test the estimated ORR 
versus a historical response rate of 10% at1-sided alpha value of 0.025. 
Subjects in the Phase 1b part who were treated at the RP2D and were deemed evaluable will be 
combined with Phase 2 subjects in the efficacy analysis. 
Secondary Efficacy
PFS, OS ,and DOR
Progression -free survival (PFS), OS ,and DOR will be analyzed using Kaplan -Meier product -limit 
estimates.  Median PFS and OS and the cumulative probability of PFS, OS ,and DOR at 6 and 
12months will be presented with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals ( CIs) if estimable.  Censoring 
rules for PFS and DOR will be provided in the SAP.
The cumulative PFS, OS ,and DOR will be plott ed over time.  The median andfirst and third 
quartiles from Kaplan –

estimable. 
Clinical Benefit Rate
A 2-sided Clopper –Pearson 95% CI will be constructed for calculating exact binomial intervals. 
Exploratory Efficacy
In addition to RECIST1.1, tumor assessment data (ie, ORR, PFS, DOR, and CBR) will be assessed 
using irRECIST in the sensitivity analysis.  
The analysis of time to response (TTR) will follow the analysis of PFS.  The analysis will be 
performed in the subjects with confirmed PR/CR perRECIST1.1 by [CONTACT_3530] .  
All efficacy analyses will be performed in all subjects and separately for each stratum .
Efficacy outcomes will be further evaluated in the PD -L1 Positive Set after a cutoff point is 
deter mined with external data.  The clinical utility of PD -L1 as a predictive marker in mTNBC 
subjects who receive eribulin mesylate and pembrolizumab combination treatment will be assessed.

A total of approximately 170subjects (at least 165 evaluable with 100in Stratum 2) will be 
enrolled .
Under Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1164419] -line ( Stratum 1) versus
second -and third-line ( Stratum 2) subjects.  Bayesian predictive probability wasused to monitor 
the study after response data from the first 38 subjects were available.  Sample size calculation was 
carried out assuming the historical response rate of 0.2.  Using simulation, the model parameters 
(θL=0.025, θ U =0.99 ,and θ T=0.95) were calibrated such that the frequentist 1-sided Type I error 
was 0. 0326 when the tumor response rate in the comb ination regimen was 0.2 (under frequentist’s 
null hypothesis H 0), and the power was 0. 9278 when the response rate was 0.35 (under 
frequentist’s alternative hypothesis H a).  The expected numbers of subjects needed to reach the 
decisions were 56 and 61 when p=0.2 (under H 0) and 0.35 (under H a), respectively.  A vague beta 
prior distribution for response rate, p, was specified in PP calculation; that is, p~beta (0.2, 0.8).  PP 
was updated for every 3 new subjects in the simulations, which mimics the group sequential 
decision -making in a real study setting.  Without Bayesian interim monitoring, the Type I error was 
estimated as 0. 0358 , and power was es timated as 0. 9418 in demonstrating posterior probability 
P(p>0.2|data) ≥0.95.  Five thousand simulations were run to estimate these design characteristics.
Per Amendment 3, additional subjects will be enrolled to ensure [ADDRESS_1164420], the power is 0. 92with 80 evaluable subjects to demonstrate statistical 
significance at 1-sided alpha of 0.025 for the assumptions of H 0: ORR=0. 10vs. Ha: ORR=0. 25.
With 80 subjects, the 95% confidence interval for ORR from bin omia l distribution will be 
0.160 -0.359 if the observed ORR is 0.25. Per Amendment 4, additional subjects will be enrolled to 
ensur e 100 e valuable subjects in Stratum 2. With 100 subjects, power will be increased to 98% and 
the 95% confidence interval forORR from binomial distribution will be 0.169- 0.347 if the 
observed ORR is 0.25 .

7INTRODUCTION
7.1 Indication
This is an open -label, single -arm multicenter Phase 1b/[ADDRESS_1164444] cancer (mTNBC) previously treated with 0 to 2 lines of systemic 
anticancer therapy in the metastatic setting.
Eribulin mesylate (HALAV EN®) is a microtubule inhibitor indicated for the treatment of 
patients wi th metastati c breast cancer who have previously received at least 
2chemotherapeut ic regimens for the treatment of metastatic disease .  Prior therapy should 
have included an anthracycline and a taxane in eit her the adjuvant or metastatic setting
(HALAV EN package insert ). 
Pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®) is a potent, humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) 
monoclonal antibody  (mAb) wi th high specificit y of binding to the programmed cell death 1 
(PD-1) receptor, thus inhibit ing its interacti on wi th programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD -L1) 
and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD -L2).Based on preclinical in vitro data, 
pembrolizumab has high affinit y and potent receptor blocking act ivity for PD -1. 
Pembrolizumab has an acceptable preclinical safety profile and is in clinical development as 
an intravenous (IV) immunotherapy  for advanced malignancies. Keytruda®
(pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients across a number of indications. 
For m ore details on specific indicat ions refer to the Invest igator’s Brochure.
Refer to the Invest igator’s Brochure (IB)/approved labeling for detailed background 
inform ation on MK -3475.
Pembrolizumab is also being invest igated for treatment of mTNBC .  Results of “A Phase 1b 
Study  of Pembro lizumab in Pat ients with Advanced Tri ple-Negat ive Breast Cancer” 
indicated that it is effect ive and safe in this populatio n (Nanda, et al ., 2014 ).
This study  will evaluate whether this co mbinat ion results in better efficacy than eribulin 
mesylate or pembro lizumab monotherapy and provides an acceptable safety  profile in 
treating the mTNBC patient populat ion.

FINAL: [ADDRESS_1164445] cancer (TNBC) is a challenging disease with the poorest prognosis of 
all breast cancer subt ypes. Importantly , there are currently no known molecular targets for 
this subgroup. Cytotoxi c chem otherapy is the only sy stemic tre atment opti on for pati ents 
with mTNBC. To ident ify a targeted anticancer agent effect ive against mTNBC in 
combinat ion with chem otherapy  is a maj or unmet need in breast cancer treatment.
7.1.2 Eribulin Mesylate
[IP_ADDRESS] Mechanism of Action of Eribulin Mesylate
Direct Cytotoxicity
Halichondrin B is a large polyether macrolide iso lated from the rare m arine sponge 
Halichondrin okadai .  It exhibit s potent anti cancer effects both in vitro and in vivo ( Lin, et 
al., 2000; Wang ,et al., 1999; Chang, et al.,1999) wi th a tubulin -based mechanism that 
appears to be distinct from all other antitubulin agents ( Lin, et al., 2000; Morse, et al., 2005; 
Rein, et al., 2000 ). Eribulin mesylate (E7389) i s a structurally  simplified, synthet ic analog of 
this marine natural  product that exhib its similar anticancer properties in preclinical models 
(Roninson, et al., 2001
) through a tubulin- based antimitotic mechanism similar to that of 
halichondrin B.  It is a nontaxane microtubule dynamics inhibitor that suppresses 
microtubule growth and seque sters tubulin into nonfunct ional aggregates, prevent ing mitotic 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_838335] G2 -M arrest and apoptosis.  It exhibited potent anticancer 
effects in preclinical models of various malignancies, including breast cancer ( Lin, et al., 
2000; Morse, et al ., 2005; Roninson, et al., 2001; Ellis, et al., 1997; Stearns, et al., 2003; 
Arends, et al., 1990). This m echanism  of action is distinct fro m that of other anti tubulins, 
such that i t may be effect ive in pat ients with disease that is resistant to these agents.  In fact, 
eribulin mesylate demonstrated anti tumor activit y in preclinical studies with cell lines that 
are paclitaxel resistant as a result of beta tubulin mutations ( Gauthier, et al., 1996 ).  The in 
vivo animal model data also predicted that this agent would achieve greater efficacy than the 
taxanes and with fewer adverse effects. 
Effects on Tumor Vascular Remodeling and reversal of EMT in Pre -Clinical Models
It has been reported that the abnormal vasculature present in tumors impairs bl ood perf usion 
and oxygenat ion, leading to hy poxic condi tions, which prom otes invasi on, metastasi s, and 
overall aggressiveness o f tumor cells through epi[INVESTIGATOR_838336] 
(EMT) -related processes. Normalizat ion of vascular perfusio n is therefor e gaining interest as 
a therapeuti c approach to inhibit motilit y, invasiveness, and aggressiveness of tumor cells .  
Preclinical data suggest that eribulin mesylate improves tumor blood perfusio n through 
vascular remodeling, which may indirect ly contribute to reduced metastasis, invasio n, and 
reversal of EMT in the tumor microenvironment, leading to a normoxic tumor 
microenvironment ( Yoshida, et al., 2014; Funahashi , et al ., 2014).
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Experience with Eribulin Mesylate 
Eribulin mesylate was first appr oved on [ADDRESS_1164446] cancer ( MBC )who have previously received at least

FINAL: [ADDRESS_1164447] been enrolled in clinical studies since the 
Development International Birth Date; approximately [ADDRESS_1164448] received eribulin 
mesylate up to the data lock point of 14 May 2014 ( HALAVEN®Invest igator Brochure) .
Of the total  of 1349 serious adverse events ( SAEs )reported in subjects who received eribulin 
mesylate, [ADDRESS_1164449] frequent treatment -related SAEs were 
febrile neutropenia, neutropenia and py rexia ( HALAVEN®Invest igator’s Brochure ).
In summary, eribulin mesylate provides clinical benefit for the treatment of patients with 
locally recurring breast cancer and MBC previously  treated wi th chem otherapeutic regimens.  
Eribulin mesylate has an acceptable safet y profile.  The risk of toxicit y with eribulin 
mesylate is comparable or less than that for other agents currently used in this populat ion.  
Proposed precautions and dose adjust ments will allow the toxicit y of eribulin mesylate to be 
managed appropriately.  Eribulin mesylate is provided as a ready -to-use formulat ionthat is 
easily  administered wi thout the need for premedications to prevent hypersensit ivity.  It i s 
therefore concluded that the benefit -risk rati o of eribulin mesylate continues to be favorable.
7.1.3 Pembrolizumab
[IP_ADDRESS] Mechanism of Action of P embrolizumab
Immune Restoration
Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal ant ibody  
(mAb) wi th high specificit y of binding to the programmed cell death 1 (PD -1) receptor, thus 
inhibit ing its interacti on wi th programmed cell death ligand (PD -L1) and programmed cell 
death ligand 2 (PD -L2).  Based on preclinical in vitro data, pembro lizumab has high affinit y 
and potent receptor blocking act ivity for PD -1.  Pembrolizumab has an acceptable preclinical 
safet y profile and is in clinical development as an i ntravenous (IV) immunotherapy  for 
advanced malignancies.  Key truda®(Pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of 
patients across a number of indications.  For more details on specific indications refer to the 
Invest igator’s Brochure (IB).
Refer to the Invest igator’s Brochure/approved labeling for detailed background information

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Experience w ith Pembrolizumab
Pembrolizumab has demonstrated initial clinical efficacy in single arm mo notherapy  studi es
in subjects wi th non-small cell lun g cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcino ma, 
urothelial cancer, gastric cancer, triple negat ive breast cancer and Hodgkin’s Lympho ma as 
determined by [CONTACT_30530].  Ongoing clinical studi esare being conducted in these tumor 
types as well as a number of other advanced solid tumor indicat ions and hematologic

significant heterogeneit y within TNBC. In particular, theCancer Geno me At las RNA 
sequencing data was used (Mittendorf, et al., 2014 )to show significantly greater expressio n 
of the T -cell inhibitory  molecule programmed cell death receptor -1 (PD -1) ligand 1 (PD -L1)
gene in TNBC (n =120) compared wit h non -TNBC (n =716; P <0.001) .Breast tumor tissue 
microarrays were also evaluated for PD-L1 expression, which was present in 19% (20 of 
105) of TNBC specimens .  
Pembrolizumab, an ant i-PD-[ADDRESS_1164452] ive in this populatio n (Nanda , et al ., 2014 ).Preliminary 
resul t of a Phase 2 study of pembro lizumab monotherapy for p reviously treated mTNBC also 
showed potential efficacy  (Adams, et al., 2017 ).
Eisai clinical studi es (Study  305 and Study  301) show edthat eribulin mesylate has better 
efficacy than the Treatm ent of Physician’s Cho ice (TPC) and capecitabine , respectively, in 
mTNBC.

Dose modification and toxicity management for immune -related AEs associated with 
pembrolizumab
AEs associ ated wi th pembro lizumab exposure may represent an immunologic et iology. 
These immune -related AEs (i rAEs) m ay occur shortly  after the first dose or several m onths 
after the l ast dose of pembrolizumab treatment and may  affect m ore than on body  system  
simultaneously .Therefore, early recognit ion and init iation of treatment is crit ical to reduce 
complicat ions.  Based on exist ing clinical study data, m ost irAEs w ere reversible and could 
be managed with interruptions o f pembro lizumab, administration of corticosteroids and/or 
other supportive care. For suspected irAEs, ensure adequate evaluat ion to confirm etio logy 
or exclude other causes. Addit ional procedures or tests such as bronchoscopy , endoscopy , 
skin biopsy may  be included as part of the evaluat ion. Based on the severit y of irAEs, 
withhol d orpermanent lydiscont inue pembro lizumab and administer corticosteroids. Dose 
modificati on and toxici ty management gui delines for irAEs associated with pembr olizumab 
are provided in Table 4.
Subjects shoul d receive appropri ate supportive care measures as deemed necessary  by [CONTACT_78017]. Suggested supportive care measures for the management of AEs with 
potent ial immuno logic etiology are outlined alo ng with the dose modificat ion gui delines.
Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or IV treatment with 
corticosteroi ds, as well  as addi tional ant i-inflammatory  agents if symptoms do not improve 
with administrati on of  corti costeroi ds.Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be 
necessary  as symptoms m ay worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, 
attempts shoul d be m ade to rul e out other causes such as metastatic disea se or bacteri al or 
viral infect ion, which might require addit ional supporti ve care. The treatment guidelines are 
intended to be applied when the invest igator determines the events to be related to 
pembro lizumab. 
Note: If after the evaluat ion of the even t, it is determined not to be related to 
pembro lizumab, the invest igator does not need to follow the treatment guidance. Refer to 
Table 4for guidelines regarding dose m odificat ion and supportive care. 
It may be necessary  to perform  condi tional procedure s such as bronchoscopy , endoscopy , or

9.4.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
This is an open -label, single -armstudy .  All  subjects who provi de signed informed consent to 
participate in this study  and satisfy  all the eligibilit y requirements ( Secti on 9.3) will be 
assigned to receive eribulin mesylate in combinat ion with pembrolizumab.  There is no 
rando mizat ion in this study . Subjects will be enrolled fro m 2strata: no prior systemic 
anticancer therapy in the metastatic setting and previously treated with 1 to 2 lines o f 
systemic anticancer therapy in the metastatic setting.
9.4.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
The level 1 dose of eribulin mesylate (1.4 mg/m2IV on Days 1 and 8 of a 21- day cycle) was
selected based on the FDA approved label.
The pembro lizumab dose used in the study  of metastatic melano ma was 2 mg/kg every  
3weeks ( Q3W )and in advanced TNBC was 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks ( Q2W ).  This study  
will use a 200 m g Q3W fixed dose.  The rationale to use a 200 m g Q3W fixed dose is based 
on a populat ion PK analysis from  476 subjects with the fo llowing findings:
the relat ionship between clearance and body  weight, wi th an all ometric exponent of 
0.59, supports both body  weight normalized dosing and a fixed dose across all body  
weights
pembro lizumab has a wide therapeut ic range (exposure margins of 0.5 –5.0) based 
on the m elano ma indicat ion
exposure i s similar between melano ma and other solid tumor indicat ions.

All prior medicat ions (including over -the-counter medicat ions) administered [ADDRESS_1164487] during 
the course of t he study (starting at the date of informed consent) until 30days (90 day s if 
given for SAEs and/or events of clinical interest [ECI s])after the final dose of study drug 
will be recorded.  Addit ionally, all diagnostic, therapeutic, or surgical procedures relat ing to 
malignancy should be recorded.  Any  medicat ion that is considered necessary  for the 
subject’s health and that is not expected to interfere with the evalu ation of,or interact with ,
eribulin mesylate or pembro lizumab may be cont inued during the study .
Treatment of complicat ions or AEs, or therapy  to ameli orate symptoms (including blood 
products, blood transfusio ns, fluid transfusio ns, antibiotics, and ant idiarrheal drugs), may be 
given at the discret ion of the investigator, unless it is expected to interfere with the evaluation 
of (or to interact with) eribulin mesylate or pembrolizumab.
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], nonsteroi dal antiinflammatory  drugs (NSAIDs), and low- molecula r-weight heparin 
(LMWH) are permissible but should be used with caution.  Granulocyte colony -stimulat ing 
factor (g-CSF) or equivalent may be used in accordance with American Societ y of Clinical  
Onco logy (ASCO), institutional, or national guidelines.  Ery thropoi etin may be used 
according to ASCO, institutional, or national guidelines, but the subject should be carefully 
monitored for increases in red blood cell (RBC) counts.
Treatment with bisphosphonates and/or denosumab will be allo wed for subjects with bo ne 
metastases.

Assessing Relationship to Study Treatment
Items to be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the study  treatm ent are:
Temporal  relati onship of the onset of the event to the init iation of the study  treatm ent
The course of the event, especially the effect of discontinuat ion of study  treatm ent or 
reintroduction of study  treatment, as applicable
Whether the event is known to be associated with the study  treatm ent or wi th other 
similar treatments
The presence of risk factors in the study  subject known to increase the occurrence of the 
event
The presence of nonstudy , treatm ent-related factors that are known to be associated with 
the occurrence of the event
Classification of Causality
The rel ationship of each AE to the study  drug will  be recorded on the CRF in response to the 
following question:
Is there a reasonable possibilit y that the study  drug caused the AE?
Yes (rel ated) A causal relat ionship between the study  drug and the AE i s a reasonable 
possibilit y.
No (not related) A causal rel ationship between the study  drug and the AE i s not a 
reasonable possibilit y.

FINAL: 26 June 2020Confidential Page 99of 127Relative dose intensit y (RDI) for each study drug will  be calculated as D ea/Dep, where D eais 
the actual  total  dose received and D epis the total planned dose .  D epof eribulin mesylate is 
calculated based on a subject’s body  surface area (BSA). 
The durati on of  exposure for each study  drug in days is defined as the date of the last dose –
the date of the first dose +1.  Average cycle length is defined as the duration of exposure 
divided by [CONTACT_838388] .
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1164549] cy cle will be used to det ermine the RP2D. TheDLT rate 
will be summarized descript ively at each combinatio n dose level in the DLT evaluable set .  
Subsequent dose -limit ing toxicit y will be reported and summarized as well.
The AE verbat im descript ions (invest igator terms from the CR F) will be classified into 
standardized medical termino logy using Medical Di ctionary for Regulatory  Activities 
(MedDRA ).  Adverse events will be coded to the MedDRA (Versio n 17 or higher) lower 
level term (LLT) closest to the verbatim term.  The linked Med DRA preferred term (PT) and 
primary  system  organ class (SOC) are also captured in the database.
A TEAE i s defined as an AE that had an onset date ,or a worsening in severit y from baseline 
(pretreatment) ,on or after the first dose of study  drug administration up to 30 days (90 day s 
for SAEs and/or ECIs )following study  drug discont inuat ion.
Only those AEs that were treatment emergent will be included in summary tables.  All AEs, 
treatm ent-emergent or otherwise, will be presented in subject data listings.
The incidence of TEAEs will be reported as the number (percentage) of subjects with TEAEs 
by [CONTACT_3592].  A subject will be counted only once wit hin an SOC and PT, even if the 
subject experienced more than 1 TEAE within a specific SOC and PT.  The number 
(percentage) of subjects with TEAEs will also be sum marized by [CONTACT_3989] v4.03.
The number (percentage) of subjects with TEAEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_838389] .  Treatment -related TEAEs include those events considered by [CONTACT_3433] e

Under Protocol  Amendment [ADDRESS_1164552]-line ( Stratum 1) 
versus second -and third-line ( Stratum 2) subjects.  Bay esian predi ctive probabilit y wasused 
to monitor the study  after response data from the first 38 subjects were available.  Sample 
size calculat ion was carried out assuming the historical response rate of 0.2.  Using 
simulat ion, the m odel param eters (θ L=0.025, θ U =0.99 ,and θ T=0.95) were calibrated such that 
the frequent ist 1-sided Ty pe I error was 0. 0326 when the tum or response rate in the 
combinat ionregimen was 0.2 (under frequentist’s null hypothesis H 0), and the power was 
0.9278 when the response rate was 0.35 (under frequent ist’s alternat ive hypothesis H a).  The 
expected numbers of subjects needed to reach the decisio ns were 56 and 61 when p=0.2 
(under H 0) and 0.35 (under H a), respectively.  A vague beta prior distribut ion for response 
rate, p, was specified in PP calculat ion; that i s, p~beta (0.2, 0.8).  PP was updated for every 3 
new subjects in the simul ations, which mimics the group sequent ial decisi on making in a real 
study setting.  Wit hout Bayesian interim monitoring, the Ty pe I error was estimated as 
0.0358 , and power was estimated as 0. 9418 in demonstrating posterior probabilit y 
P(p>0.2|data) ≥0.95.   Five thousand simulations were run to estimate these design

Tumors (irRECIST)
Invest igators should fo llow the gui delines provi ded here , which are an adaptation of RECIST 
1.1 and immune -related response cri teria ( irRC).  The fo llowing gui de represents a summary  
of irRECIST and i s meant to hel p invest igators in providing more object ive and reproducible 
immune therapy -related t umor response assessments in so lid tumors.
The key  changes for i rRECIST are:
For thi s study , similar to that allowed for RECIST 1.1, irRECIST allows the site to 
select up to 5target l esions at baseline, 2per organ, if clinically relevant via CT/MRI 
scans or by  [CONTACT_229110] c calipers for skin lesio ns. The abilit y to continue treatm ent, if 
clinically stable, unt il repeat imaging scans ≥ 4 weeks l ater (in m ost cases at the next 
scanning time point) to confirm immune -related p rogressive disease (irPD)
irRECIST Lexicon
1.Baseline Assessments
Measurable 
(Target) LesionsMeasurable lesions must be accurately measured in at least 1dimension with a 
minimum size of:
[ADDRESS_1164575] diameter (LDi) by [CONTACT_28842] (or no less than double 
the slice thickness) for non -nodal lesions and ≥15 mm in s hort axis (SDi ) for nodal 
lesions
10 mm in LDi for clinical lesions (must be measured using electronic calipers)
Identify  up to 5lesions, not more than 2from 1organ s ystem. Lymph nodes are 
considered 1organ system
Likely  to be reproducible across all time point s
Representative of tumor burden
May include lesions in previously irradiated areas ONLY if there is demonstrated 
progression in that lesion after irradiation
Sum of diameters (SOD) of all target lesions including nodal and non -nodal are 
reported as baseline SOD which is used for assessing tumor response at follow -up 
time points
Bone Lesions Regardless of the imaging modality, blastic bone lesions will not be selected as target 
lesions. Lytic or mixed lytic -blastic lesions with a measurable soft tissue component 
≥[ADDRESS_1164576] diameter of such a lesion will be added to the SOD of all target lesions at 
baseline. If other lesions with a nonliquid/nonnecrotic component are present, those 
should be preferred.
Lesions with 
Prior Local 
TreatmentDuring target lesion selection the radiologist will consider information on the 
anatomical sites of previous intervention ( eg,previous irradiation, RF -ablation, TACE, 
surgery , etc).  Lesions undergoing prior intervention will not be selected as target 
lesions unless there has been a demonstration of progression in the lesion.
Nonmeasurable 
(Non target) 
LesionsNon-target lesions will include:
Measurable lesions not selected as target lesions .  There is no limit to the number 
of nontarget lesions that can be recorded at baseline
Other ty pes of lesions that are confidently felt to represent neoplastic tissue, but 
are difficult to measure in a reproducible manner .  These include bone metastases,

Amendment 05E7389 -M001 -218
Eisai
FINAL: [ADDRESS_1164577] disease, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, cystic lesions, 
ill-defined abdominal masses, etc.
Multiple non target lesions from the same organ may be captured as a single item 
on the CRF ( eg,multiple liver metastases )
Non-target lesions should be reported as present at baseline
SOD baseline Sum of diameters at baseline = LDi of all non -nodal + SDi of all nodal target lesions
2.Time point Assessments after Baseline
Target lesion 
measurementsLocate image that optimizes the LDi of the non -nodal target lesion or short axis of 
target node(s) .  There is no need to go to an identical slice from baseline.
Measure the respective LDi and SDi for all target lesions and calculate time point SOD 
(SOD timepoint ).
Special c onsideration for target lesions:
If a target lesion is too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be entered 
on CRF.
If a target lesion is between 5 -10mm, actual diameter should be entered on the 
CRF.
If a target lesion splits into [ADDRESS_1164578] of that lesion .
If 2target lesion smerged to form 1lesion ,then the LDi of 1should be entered as 
“0mm”while the other lesion should have the diameter of the merged lesion .
Nontarget Lesion 
AssessmentNontarget lesions are evaluated qualitatively as prese nt, absent, not evaluable (NE) o r 
unequivocal progression .  The response of nontarget lesions primarily contributes to 
the overall response assessments of irCR .  Nontarget lesions do not affect irPR and 
irSD assessments .  Only a massive and unequivocal worsening of nontarget lesions 
alone, even in the presence of stable disease or a PRin the target lesion is indicative of 
irPD .  IrCR is not possible unless all nontarget lesions are absent.
Definition of 
New lesionAny lesion which was not recorded at baseline .  There is no minimum size criteria to 
identify  a new lesion and clinical judgment must be used by [CONTACT_978]
May include a lesion in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline 
(ie,brain)
Should be unequivocal and not due to differences in scanning technique
If equivocal, should be assessed at next time point; if present, irPD is the date the 
lesion was first seen (not the date confirmed)
3.irRECIST Overall Tumor Assessment
irCR Complete disappearance of all measurable and nonmeasurable lesions (from 
baseline) and there are no unequivocal new lesions (unconfirmed irCR).
Lymph nodes must decrease to <10 mm in short axis.
Confirmation of response is required ≥ 4weeks later, preferably at next time point , 
to be considered a confirmed irCR.
irPR If the SOD timepoint of TLs decreases by ≥30 % compared to SOD baseline and there 
are no unequivocal new lesions, and no progression of nontarget disease, it is an 
irPR (unconfirmed). 
Confirmation is required ≥ 4weeks later, preferably at next time point, to be 
considered a confirmed irPR.
irSD Failure to meet criteria for irCR or irPR in the absence of irPD.
If the sum of the TLs and the status of the nontarget lesions do not reach the 
criteria to meet irPR or irPD (an increase of ≥20% and at least 5 mm absolute 
increase in SOD compared to nadir†) ,the response is irSD.

In determining whether or not the tumor burden has increased or decreased, local study site 
investigators should consider all target lesio ns as well as non -target l esions.  Subj ects that are 
deem ed clinically  unstable are not requi red to have repeat tumor imaging for confirmation.  
•For a clinically  stable subject wi th first radio logic evidence of progressive disease by

oNOTE: If a subje ct has confirmed radiographic progressio n (ie,[ADDRESS_1164581] 4 weeks 
apart demonstrating progressive disease) per irRECIST, but the subject is achieving a 
clinically meaningful benefit, and there is no further increase in the tumor burden at the

following consultation wit h the Sponsor. In this case, if treatment is cont inued, tumor 
imaging should continue to be performed fo llowing the intervals as outlined in sect ions 6.0 
Study Flowchart and be submitted to the central imaging vendor.   Note :  As of 
Protocol Amendment 05, tumor assessment scans will no longer be sent to the central
imaging laboratory .

The study will be conducted at a maximum of 12 investigational sites 
in the U nited States (U S) and Israel ,; Sites in the US will enroll 
approximately 33% of total subjects. Each site will enroll a maximum 
of 60 subjects.  
Randomization  Upon completion of the run -in period, eligible subjects will be 
randomly allocated (with a 1:1 ratio) to one of the following 2 
treatment groups based on a randomization scheme using the 
permuted block method stratified by [CONTACT_384]:  
• Group A - active stimulation  
• Group B - sham stimulation  
The randomization scheme will be prepared by [CONTACT_288353] (version 9.4.) random number procedure. The block size 
will be random, and all study personnel will be therefore blinded to the 
randomi zation block size.  
Sample Size  The planned sample size is up to 200 randomized subjects, to allow for 
90 evaluable subjects per treatment group, anticipating 10% drop -
out.

Sample Size Estimation:  
The sample size for this study was calculated to test the null 
hypothesis with a chi -squared test, even though the final analysis may 
employ a regression model and/or a Fisher’s exact test.  
Sample sizes are calculated to test the null hypothesis with 80% 
power at a 5% level of significance.

If we assume that 45% of the subjects in the active treatment arm will 
have successful pain relief versus 25% in the sham arm, 180 evaluable 
subjects are required, 90 per group. Allowing for a ~10% drop -out 
rate, a total of 200 (100 active vs. 100 sham) subjects should be 
enrolled in the study.    
Interim Analysis:   
One interim analysis is planned after 144 (80%) e valuable subjects 
have been accrued . The study will then either continue to the 
originally planned sample size if the result is “favorable”, stop for 
futility if the result is “unfavorable”, or an increase  will be made to  
the sample size if the result is “promising” these decisions will be 
made based on the cond itional power (CP), defined as the conditional 
probability that the final result will exceed a critical value at the 
interim given the observed effect size  𝛿1̂ = difference between pain 
reduction rates in the active versus control groups at the interim lo ok. 
Primary endpoint analysis:  
The primary endpoint is the p roportion  of subjects reporting  
reduction of migraine headache  pain  [ADDRESS_351412] treated migraine attack, when using active combined 
occipi[INVESTIGATOR_288321], in subjects suffering from acute 
migraine headache . Use of r escue medication will be considered  a 
failure for this end -point (i.e. patient will be assigned the status of no 
reduction) .  
A count and percentage of subjects reporting such headache pain 
reduction without rescue medications  will be calculated and 
presented for both study groups, each with a two -sided 95% exact 
confidence interval. The groups will be compared with a chi -squared 
test and a Fisher’s exact test.  
If the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative hyp othesis 
and the proportion (%) of subjects reporting  reduction of migraine in 
the treated group is greater than that of the sham group, the study 
will be deemed successful.

3. Introduction  
3.1. Background  
Migraine is a prevalent and debilitating primary headache disorder. In the U.S population the prevalence 
of migraine is approximately 18% in women and 6% in men  [1].  The World Health Organization (WHO) 
estimates that half to three quarters of adults aged [ADDRESS_351413] year and, among those individuals, 30% or more have reported migraine  [2]. Migraine prevalence is 
highest in those aged 30 to 39 years  [3]. Migraine patients suffer from disabling symptoms that usually 
consist of a moderate to severe headache  lasting 4 to 72 hours, nausea and/or vomiting, phonophobia 
(noise  sensitivity ) and photophobia (light  sensitivity ). Seventy five percent ( 75% ) have a reduced ability 
to function during the migraine epi[INVESTIGATOR_49591] 33% require bed rest during their attacks  [3]. Patients with 
migraine are often refractory to medical treatment and some of the most effective anti -migraine drugs , 
such as Triptans , have substantial side effects [ 4]. 
Triptans are the first -line therapy for patients whose attacks do not reliably respond to simple or 
combination analgesics  [4]. The Most common side effects of Triptans are dizziness, nausea, weakness, 
tiredness, drowsiness, p aresthesias, flushing, neck tightness and chest pressure which occur in about 
20% of patients. Triptans have also been associated with the development of headache caused by 
[CONTACT_160459]. Therefore, most experts recommend a conservative limit on its u se to about 2 days 
per week  [2]. Serious cardiovascular events, some resulting in death, have been reported in association 
with the use of Triptans. Thus, Triptans are contraindicated in an estimated 4.7 million Americans with 
migraine  [4]. These contraind ications and side effects have left millions of patients without a proper 
solution for their pain. Therefore, these patients may benefit from other, non -pharmaceutical strategies 
to modulate their pain. One of the tools to achieve pain reduction is Periphe ral Nerve Stimulation (PNS). 
PNS can be applied either invasively or non -invasively. Invasive PNS involves surgery that places a small 
electrical device next to one of the peripheral nerves. Invasive procedures of PNS for treatment of 
migraine include  occipi[INVESTIGATOR_288322] (ONS) which has been  shown to provide relief for chronic 
migraine in numerous clinical trials  [5-9]. Another more recent PNS procedure for treatment of migraine 
combines both occipi[INVESTIGATOR_288323]  [10,11] . Recent clinical studies support the 
expectation that applying peripheral nerve stimulation to a combination of the occipi[INVESTIGATOR_288324] a better outcome compared to stimulation of the occipi[INVESTIGATOR_288325]  [10,11] . 
Indeed, the respo nse rate for patients with intractable head -wide pain who were treated with implanted 
PNS to the occipi[INVESTIGATOR_288326] 90%  [10,11] .  This is an 
improvement from using stimulation to the occipi[INVESTIGATOR_288327] i s reported to bring about just a 
40% response rate  [10]. However, implanted peripheral nerve stimulation remains an invasive and costly 
procedure with high rate of complications including infection, bleeding or fluid collection under the skin, 
as well as h ardware -related malfunctions such as migration and breakage of the implanted leads and 
pulse generator failure  [5]. Thus, these procedures are currently offered only for intractable severe 
cases of chronic migraine.

Transcutaneous nerve stimulation is a n oninvasive technique that for decades was considered of 
potential benefit for patients with headache  [12]. Supraorbital transcutaneous stimulation has been 
applied and found to be safe and effective as a prophylactic therapy for migraine. In a sham -control led 
trial, therapeutic gain was found to be within the range of those reported for other preventive drug and 
non-drug antimigraine treatments  [13]. In a safety and patients’ satisfaction survey of 2,313 patients 
using transcutaneous supraorbital stimulatio n, no serious adverse events were reported  [14]. In a recent 
trial [15] of supraorbital stimulation for acute treatment of migraine, a significant difference was shown 
in pain reduction between the sham and active treatment, with no significant adverse eve nts.  
Due to the challenge of transferring current through the hair, stimulation of the occipi[INVESTIGATOR_132472] [ 5,6,8,16 ] and percutaneous [ 17] nerve stimulators. However , due to its 
superficial anatomic location at the level of  the external occipi[INVESTIGATOR_132473] [ 18, 19] once the 
electrodes are placed under the hair and close enough to the scalp, it can be stimulated 
transcutaneously .  It may  thereby [CONTACT_288355].  A combined occipi[INVESTIGATOR_288328] a safe, effective and fast acting treatment for r educing migraine related 
pain.  
According to this rationale, Neurolief is developi[INVESTIGATOR_288329]™ - a transcutaneous neuro -stimulator 
applying combined occipi[INVESTIGATOR_288330] . Following complet ion of early clinical studies showing favorable results, Neurolief designed 
the proposed clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the R elivion ™ in a two -arms controlled, 
double blinded randomized study.  
3.2. Purpose

5.1. General  
The Relivion™ is an external neurostimulator designed for transcutaneous electrical nerve  stimulation. 
The headset integrates three pairs of output electrodes which come in contact [CONTACT_288357] (two pairs) and  occiput (1 pair). The electrodes deliver the stimulation  pulses produced by 
[CONTACT_132553]’s scalp. The frontal electrodes stimulate the  trigeminal (supraorbital 
& supratrochlear) nerve branches and the posterior electrodes stimulate the  occipi[INVESTIGATOR_132480] 
(Figures 1 and 2 below). Stimulation intensity can be adjusted by [CONTACT_28024].  
The Relivion™ is a prescription device that will be self -used in a home environment.  
 
Figure 1: Relivion™ and its target nerves  
 
Figure 2: Relivion™ on a user  
 
 
The device is comprised of a headset with integrated electrodes, designed to enable stimulation of  the 
target nerves.  The on -board stimulation circuit is adapted to deliver stimulatio n patterns to  enhance 
proper nerve activation.  The headset adjusts to various head sizes and contours and can  be worn

comfortably.  Each time the headset is worn, the six electrodes are placed over the  underlying nerves.  
Four anterior forehead electrodes  are aligned with branches of the trigeminal  nerve (supraorbital & 
supratrochlear) and two posterior electrodes are aligned with the greater  occipi[INVESTIGATOR_132480].  The 
headset includes two flexible arms that penetrate under the hair  layers while the he adset is donned.  A 
size adjustment mechanism is located at both sides of the  headset.  It enables adjustment of the 
headset size to the head of the user before first use.  The Relivion™ includes six replaceable electrode 
pads that are positioned above the  headset electrodes.   The pads consist of a water absorbing foam and 
should be wetted by [CONTACT_288358].  Water releasing covers  are located on the outer side of each oc cipi[INVESTIGATOR_288333].  After positioning the headset on the head,  the user press once on the water release covers 
to release moisture from the electrode pads onto  the scalp, thereby [CONTACT_288359].   The Relivion™ incorporates an on -board interface that enables the user to 
activate/deactivate the  device and to adjust the stimulation intensity.  It also provides visual and 
auditory indications such as  whether the device is active/non -active and when there i s a low battery.    
The Relivion™ can communicate via a low energy Bluetooth link with a mobile application on the  user’s 
smartphone.  The mobile application displays the device status and provides  indications and alerts such 
as treatment intensity level, t reatment duration, low battery, charging  state, etc.  The mobile 
application is optional as the Relivion™ can be fully operated without it.   Furthermore, the device cannot 
be controlled (activate, adjust intensity, etc.) by [CONTACT_288360].  
Further details, images and specifications are provided in the User Manual.  
5.2. Mode of Action  
As explained, the Relivion™ is an external neurostimulator designed for transcutaneous electrical nerve 
stimulation. The headset integrates three pairs of output electrodes  which come in contact [CONTACT_288361].  The electrodes deliver the stimulation pulses produced by [CONTACT_288362]’s scalp.  The frontal electrodes stimulate the trigeminal (supraorbital and 
supratrochl ear) nerve branches and the posterior electrodes stimulate the greater occipi[INVESTIGATOR_288334].  
Overactive pain and symptom areas of the brain are believed to play a primary role in the onset of 
migraines  [20]. The Relivion™ device treats migraine by [CONTACT_288363][INVESTIGATOR_288334], thereby [CONTACT_288364] -and-symptom areas and altering the activity in pain -
associated central structures.

"pass"  session  on the device log timeline, will count as a completed treatment.  
‐ Subjects will be asked to refrain from consuming rescue medication /cannabis  for at least [ADDRESS_351449] treatment initiation.  Subjects using rescue medication /cannabis prior to [ADDRESS_351450] 
treatment initiation will be considered as failure (will be assigned the value of 0=no headache 
pain reduction) in the primary analysis.  
‐ Subjects will document on the Patient Reported Outcome diary:  
▪ Pain according to a 4 points scale  (0=no pain, 1=Mild pain, 2=Moderate pain, 3=Severe pain)  
at 1 and 2 hours ±30 minutes and at 24 hours ±[ADDRESS_351451] initiation of treatment.   
▪ Most Bothersome migraine -associated Symptom (MBS) other than a headache  (chosen at 
baseline) improvement (yes/no ) at 1 and 2 hours ±[ADDRESS_351452] -treatment initiation . 
▪ Rescue medication intake.  
8.1.7.  Visit 4 - Termination visit  (following 5 treated Migraine epi[INVESTIGATOR_288345] 70 +10, whichever comes first)  
Written below are the assessments to be completed at Visit 4:  
• After up to 5 migraine epi[INVESTIGATOR_288341] 70 +10, whichever comes first, subject will report to 
the clinic and return the device , Smartphone  and hard copy subject diary, if applicable .  
• Change in prophylactic anti -migraine & rescue headache medicatio n will be documented.   
• Subjects device Global Impression of Effect  will be documented.  
• Adverse events will be documented .  
• Device logs , for each Migraine treated epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], will be downloaded by [CONTACT_3476] (from study 
cloud database or from the device) t o ascertain eligible treatments .  An eligible treatment is defined 
as: 
‐ treatment  meeting the basic criteria ( i.e., no analgesics or other pain relief drugs or cannabis 
within 4 hours period before the treatment initiation; no more than 30 minutes passed fr om the 
start of the migraine epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]; more than [ADDRESS_351453]’s previous 
Migraine epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] ; and subject did not wake up with a Migraine headache); and   
‐ with total stimulation time of at least 30 minutes of a "pass"  session  on the device log timeline , 
where pass is defined as a minimal stimulation of 2mA delivered).    
The characteristics of each treatment will be indicated on the subject CRF.  
At this point  subject’s participation in this study will be over. The subjects will continue receiving 
medical care as per local standard of care, but not within the clinical study. Adverse Events that are still 
ongoing will be followed per local standard of care, but not within the clinical study.  
8.2. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
During the Run -In and Self -Practice Periods, the subject will use prophylactic medications as prescribed 
and rescue medications as needed and will document their use in the Migraine Diary.  
 THE RIME STUDY: ABRIDGED 
CLINICAL INVESTIGATION PLAN   Doc No.:  CL-CIP-001 Abridged  
Ref Rev: REV. 2 / 11JUN [ADDRESS_351454] will continue his/her prophylactic medications  and rescue 
medications as needed .  While using the Relivion™ the subject will be asked to refrain from taking 
rescue medications /cannabis  in the [ADDRESS_351455] Consent  
Informed consent will be obtained before any study -specific procedures are initiated or data collected. 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her authorized designee will conduct the informed consent process.  
8.4. Rando mization , Treatment Assignment  and Blinding  
Subjects  will be prospectively  randomized into  the clinical  study.   Randomization will  occur  only  after  
the subject  provides informed consent, completes  the Run -in Period and all required screening  and 
baseline procedures, and satisfies  the study  eligibility  criteria . Eligible subjects will be randomly 
allocated (with a 1:1 ratio) to one of the following 2 treatment groups based on a randomization scheme 
using the permuted block method stratified by [CONTACT_384]:  
• Group A - active stimulation.  
• Group B - sham stimulation.  
The randomization scheme will be prepared by [CONTACT_288374] (version 9.4.) random 
number procedure. The block size will be random, and all study personnel will therefore be blinded to 
the randomization block size.  Only  the unblinded  statistician  /sponsor unblinding party  and designates  
will be privy  to the masked  randomization  scheme.  
The Relivion™ Active and Sham devices will look the same and will be provided in the same packaging 
bearing the same labeling.  Hence, both subjects and study personnel will remain blinded to the 
assigned treatment group.    
8.5. Medication Compliance  
While using the Relivion™ the subject will be asked to refrain from taking rescue medications/cannabis 
in the [ADDRESS_351456] will ascertain he/she did not 
consume any rescue medications/cannabis in the 4 hours prior to study treatment initiation. During 
each study treatment and up to 24 hours afterwards subjects will document any rescue 
medication/cannabis intake. PRO data of s ubjects who consume d rescue medications/can nabis will not 
be considered  for the analysis of the related treatment time point .

8.6. Assessment of Efficacy  
Efficacy parameters including Pain level, use of rescue medications /cannabis , presence and r elief of 
most bothersome migraine -associated symptom  othe r than headache  will be documented during 
treatment at baseline, [ADDRESS_351457] using the diary  (electronic or hard copy) . 
Treatment duration and intensity will be documented automatically i n the device logs.  
8.7. Assessment of Safety  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_288375] (randomization) 
through study exit. Type, incidence, severity, duration, and procedure/device relationship of adverse 
events (AE s) will be collected throughout the study. Subjects with AEs at study exit  will be followed for 
[ADDRESS_351458]. Adverse event data will be collected and reported 
on eCRFs.  
9. Risks and Benefits  
Risk management is performed as per ISO [ZIP_CODE], complete documentation is maintained on file  
(Neurolief document #  QAD -022).  
9.1. Risk Control and Mitigation  
The following efforts will minimize risks to subjects in the study:  
• Conduct of the study following successful completion of extensive bench performance testing and 
careful risk analysis.  
• Selecti on of investigators who are experienced and skilled in management of patients with migraine.  
• Establishment of a training program for study staff members (investigators and coordinator) and use 
of tools that will ensure proper training to the subjects for h ome use of the device.  
• Clearly defining the inclusion and exclusion criteria such that only appropriate patients are enrolled 
in the study.  
9.2. Risk-Benefit Rationale  
Assessing the risks against the potential benefits of the use of the Relivion™  for alleviatin g migraine 
pain , Neurolief  and the principal investigator s have determined that there is a high likelihood that the 
expected benefit may outweigh the risk in patients fulfilling the study eligibility criteria.

10. Adverse Event s and Device Deficiencies  
Adverse  event definitions used in this study are based on ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011 (Clinical Investigation of 
Medical Devices for Human Subjects -- Good Clinical Practice ).  
Adverse Events will be collected for all enrolled subjects with the point  of enrolment  (Visit #2) and end 
at the study termination visit (visit #4) . Subjects with AEs at termination visit  will be followed for [ADDRESS_351459].  
During the course of the study, all AEs will be collected and reported on the  eCRF  including :  
• All AEs related to Relivion device and/or procedure   
• All AEs not related  to Relivion device and/or procedure  
• All device deficiencies that may lead to a SAE  
• All Deaths  
10.1.  Relivion Anticipated Adverse Events  
Possible risks and adverse events that may be associated with the Relivion™ device are based on  
adverse events reports of similarity devices include, but are not limited to the following:  
• Unpleasant sensation during treatment  
• Scalp Numbness sensation during and after treatment  
• Pers istent tingling sensation after the treatment ends  
• Pain  
• Skin reaction (for example, irritation, lesion, burn) beneath the stimulation electrodes  In this case, 
treatment should be temporarily discontinued.  
• Redness of the skin under or around the electrodes.  Skin redness usually disappears within several 
hours after treatment  
• Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], fatigue or sleep disorders  
• Sedative effect during or after treatment  
• Dizziness during or after treatment  
• Tension type headache after treatment

11. Statisti cal Considerations  
11.1.  Study Endpoint Variables  
11.1.1.  Primary endpoint variable  
The primary endpoint, the proportion of subjects reporting reduction of migraine headache pain [ADDRESS_351462] treated migraine attack, when using active combined occipi[INVESTIGATOR_288347], in subjects suffering from acute migraine headache, 
will be measured in the form of a binary variable which will be assigned the value of “1” if the subject 
reports such headache pain reduction without having used rescue medications, and “0” otherwise. 
Rescue medication use within the [ADDRESS_351463] will be 
coded as “0” automatically.   
11.1.2.  Secondary endpoint variables  
The three secondary endpoints will also be represented in the form of binary variables which will be 
assigned the value of “1” if the subject is a “responder” to each specific secondary endpoint, and “0” 
otherwise.  
11.1.3.  Exploratory endpoint variables  
The exploratory endpoints will be measured in the form of a binary variables which will be assigned the 
value of “1” if the subject responds to each specific exploratory endpoint, and “0” otherwise.  
Global Impression of Effect will also be measured via a 5 -level Likert scale.  
11.1.4.  Safety endpoint variables  
Incidence of all adverse events and complications by [CONTACT_132628].  
11.2.   Study Hypothesis  
Study Hypothesis:

HA: PT ≠ PS 
Where PT and PS represent the proportions (%) of subjects  reporting pain relief in the active treatment 
group and sham group respectively.  
11.3.  Sample Size Estimation  
The sample size for this study was calculated to test the null hypothesis with a chi -squared test, even 
though the final analysis may employ a regressi on model and/or a Fisher’s exact test.  
The sample size is calculated to test the null hypothesis with 80% power at a 5% level of significance  
using the POWER procedure in SAS v9.4 .  
If we assume that 45% of the subjects in the active treatment arm will ha ve successful pain relief versus 
25% in the sham arm then 180 evaluable subjects are required, 90 per group. Allowing for a ~10% drop -
out rate, a total of 200 (100 active vs. 100 sham) subjects should be enrolled in the study.      
11.4.  Interim Analysis  
Planning  one interim analysis that permits an increase in the sample size as described below does not 
additionally inflate the type I error [ 22-24]. In addition, the final analysis is performed using the 
conventional test as appropriate for the statistical hypothe sis. 
One interim analysis is planned once ~ 80% of the information is collected, i.e. the interim look will be 
performed after [ADDRESS_351464] been accrued. Based on the conditional power at the 
interim analysis, the study will either continue to the originally planned sample size if the result is 
“favorable”, stop for futility if the result is “unfavorable”, or we shall increase the sample size if the 
result is “promising”. These decisions will be made based on the conditional power (CP), defined as the 
conditional probability that the final result will exceed a critical value at the interim given the observed 
effect size 𝛿1 = difference between pain reductio n rates in the active versus control groups at the 
interim look. The following guidelines for sample size increase, depending on the zone into which CP 
falls at the interim, the calculated CPmin, the maximum sample size designated of 340 for the study and 
the % of the originally planned sample size at which the interim analysis will be performed. Following 
this principle does not inflate the Type I error.  
The sponsor and the clinics will remain blinded throughout the study to the interim analysis results as  
well, only the decision made will be shared.

nmax = the highest sample size the company is willing to use/ can afford, n max = [ADDRESS_351465] size of 15% in the same manner as above in Section 12.3 .  
CPmin=is the calculated minimum CP based on the ratios n max/n2, n1/n2 and the target study power 
(80%).  
11.4.1.  Procedure  
After all the relevant data will be entered into the database, and the database cleaned, a soft lock to the 
database will be performed. An independent un -blinded statistician (not the study statistician)  will 
perform the assessments described below. A designated data monitoring team  will recommend whether 
to stop the study once the interim results are available.  
At the interim analysis, the data of the evaluable subjects  per ITT and m ITT will be analyzed . 
11.4.2.  Blinding  
Only  the unblinded statistician and members of the interim decision team  will be exposed to the interim 
report. The members of the  data monitoring team  may also have access to the unmasked information of 
the interim analysis. Investigators and company directors will only be informed of a decision to continue 
or to discontinue the trial, or to implement modifications in trial procedure. The un -blinded sta tistician 
who is responsible for conducting the interim analyses should ensure that the unmasked data is not 
available to any unauthorized person within or outside the company . 
11.4.3.  Decision Rules  
The following are the decision rules for the interim analysis wh ich will be performed upon accrual of 
80% of the sample size, 144 evaluable subjects:  
• If the result is “Unfavorable”, i.e. CP < CPmin = 32.91 % (interim result is so disappointing that it is 
not worth increasing the sample size to retrieve conditional power ) or if the difference between 
percentage of subjects reporting pain relief at the interim (Pt -Pc) is less than 0%, then stop the trial 
for futility.  
• If the result is “Promising”, i.e. 32.91 % ≤ CP < 80% the sample size is increased recover the targeted 
pow er of 80%. The sample size used will be either the new calculated sample size based on the 
conditional power (as described in Sample size re calculation using conditional power Jonathan S. 
Denne Statist. Med. 2001; 20:2645 –2660) or the predetermined maximu m sample size of 340 
subjects.  
• If the result is “Favorable”, i.e. CP ≥ 80%  the interim results are sufficiently favorable and trial 
continues to the original sample size planned 180 without the need to adaptively increase the 
sample size.

Note that the in terim analysis will be conducted on all population ( ITT, mITT  and PP  analysis sets , see 
Section 12.6 ), and the study will be stopped due to futility only if the interim effects in both populations 
fall below the threshold . 
11.4.4.  Controlling the Alpha Level for t he Primary Endpoint  
The overall alpha level for this study is 5%. According to [ references 1-2-3], planning an interim analysis 
that permits an increase in the sample size as described above does not inflate the type I error.  
11.5.  Randomization   
Upon completion  of the run -in period, eligible subjects will be randomly allocated (with a 1:1 ratio) to 
one of the following 2 treatment groups based on a randomization scheme using the permuted block 
method stratified by [CONTACT_384]:  
• Group A – active  (Relivion ™) stimulation  
• Group B = sham stimulation  
The randomization scheme will be prepared by [CONTACT_132534] (version 9.4.) random 
number procedure. The block size will be random, and all study personnel will be therefore blinded to 
the random ization block size.  
11.6.  Analysis Populations  
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population : The ITT population will include all randomized subjects, according to 
the ITT principle all subjects will be kept in a group as randomized.  
Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population : The mITT population will include all randomized subjects 
who treat at least one eligible attack (excluding the " self-practice  test"), with group assignment as 
treated.  
Per-Protocol Population : The Per -Protocol population will include all subjec ts in the mITT population 
who completed the treatment period in compliance with the protocol and have no major protocol 
deviations, with group assignment as treated.  
The ITT analysis set will serve as the main analysis set for all safety evaluations.  
The e fficacy analyses will be performed on the mITT analysis set.  
The primary and secondary efficacy assessments will also be performed on the PP and the ITT analysis 
sets as a sensitivity analysis.

11.7.  Statistical Analysis  
11.7.1.  General  Considerations  
Statistical analy ses will be performed using SAS® v9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary NC, [LOCATION_003]). Statistical analyses 
and reporting will be performed in compliance with FDA Guidance E6 GCP, 21 CFR part 812, E9 and ISO 
[ZIP_CODE].  
All statistical tests will be two -sided. The required signi ficance level of findings will be equal to or lower 
than 5%, nominal p -values will be presented. Where confidence limits are appropriate, the confidence 
level will be 95%.  
Continuous variables will be summarized by a mean, standard deviation, minimum, medi an and 
maximum and categorical variables by a count and percentage. For comparison of means (continuous 
variables), the two -sample t -test or the Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used as appropriate. For 
comparison of proportions (categorical variables), the chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test will be used 
as appropriate.  
If multiple measurements are taken in a single patient, statistics described below will be appropriately 
modified to accommodate the within patient correlation.  
Deviations from the planne d analysis will be described, with proper justification, in the clinical study 
report.  
11.7.2.  Significance Level and Handling of Type I Error  
Type I Error  
The overall significance level for this study is 5% using two -tailed tests, except for treatment by [CONTACT_132631] a significance level of 10%.  
Hierarchy Approach for Secondary Endpoint Analysis   
The hierarchy approach will be adopted for the primary and secondary endpoints to control type I error 
due to multiple endpoint testing. Thus,  the primary endpoint will first be tested and only if p<0.05, will 
the secondary endpoints be tested. For the three secondary performance endpoints, the Benjamini –
Hochberg step -up method will be used to adjust the p -values.  
11.7.3.  Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline condition related characteristics will be tabulated and compared between 
the study groups by [CONTACT_89714], this data will also be compared between US and OUS sites for poolability 
confirmation. Continuous variables wil l be summarized by a mean, standard deviation, minimum, 
median and maximum and categorical variables by a count and percentage.  
These data will include:  
• Demographic data

• Medical history  
• Type of pain medications/treatments used for migraine as well as rescue  
• Other concomitant medication  
• Migraine attacks characteristics  
• Physical examination  
11.7.4.  Disposition of Subjects  
The number of subjects who entered the study and completed each stage of the study will be provided, 
as well as the reasons for all post randomization discontinuations, grouped by [CONTACT_57117], e.g., lost to 
follow -up, adverse event, poor compliance, did not administer any treatment (with reasons). A list of 
discontinued patients, protocol deviations and subjects excluded from the performan ce analysis will be 
provided as well.  
11.7.5.  Efficacy Analysis  
Primary Efficacy Analyses   
The primary endpoint is the proportion (%) of patients reporting reduction in their pain level [ADDRESS_351466] treated eligible (per Section 9.1.6 ) migraine attack (excluding the "self -practice" 
treatment).  A count and percentage of subjects reporting such headache pain reduction without rescue 
medications wi ll be calculated and presented for both study groups, each with a two -sided 95% exact 
confidence interval. The groups will be compared with a chi -squared test and a Fisher’s exact test.  
If the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative hypoth esis and the proportion (%) of subjects 
responding to this endpoint in the active group is greater than that of the sham group, the study will be 
deemed successful.  
The primary endpoint will also be evaluated stratified by [CONTACT_288376] a Mantel -Haenszel te st to assess 
the center by [CONTACT_102938].  
A sensitivity analysis of the primary end -point will be performed to assess the impact of missing data on 
the study outcome. This will be performed using several possible imputation methods.  
Subset Analyses of Primary Endpoint  
Adjustment for other covariates such as demographics or other baseline patient characteristics may be 
performed by [CONTACT_288377] a logistic regression model.  
Subgroup analysis will be performed and reported by [CONTACT_288378] a logistic 
regression model:

• US vs. OUS sites  
Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
The secondary efficacy variables will be summarized by a count and percentage and compared with a 
chi-square d test and a Fisher’s exact test.  
 
Exploratory Analyses  
The exploratory variables will be summarized by a count and percentage and compared with a chi -
squared test and a Fisher’s exact test.  
Global Impression of Effect will also be summarized by [CONTACT_288379] a t -test.  
Frequency of use of rescue medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_288380] a t -test.  
Safety Analysis  
The pri mary safety variable, the cumulative incidence (and 95% CI) of device related adverse events 
(AEs) throughout the study, will be presented in tabular format and will include incidence tables by 
[CONTACT_926].  
Adverse event rates will be compared between the stu dy groups with a Fisher’s exact test.  
Serious adverse events will be listed and discussed individually.  
Treatment tolerability will be compared between the study groups. The number and percent of subjects 
who fail to complete the study and the number and percent of subjects who fail to complete the study 
because of Adverse Events will be presented as well.  
Handling of Missing Data  
Multiple imputation for binary data will be used as the primary imputation method in the case of 
missing data for the prim ary efficacy end -point.  
Additional sensitivity analysis of the primary end -point will be performed to assess the impact of missing 
data on the study outcome using possible imputation methods for binary data:

Observed Data: Use only subjects with non -missin g pain data and who did not withdraw early from 
study  
Dropout/AE Imputation: A subject with no post baseline measurement of pain or a subject withdrawn 
due to an adverse event or treatment intolerability should be considered as a nonresponder for this 
analysis.  
Best Case Scenario: Assume all visits with missing pain data in active group are successes. Assume all 
subjects in the sham group with missing pain data are failures.  
Worst Case Scenario: Assume all visits with missing pain data in active group are failures. Assume all 
subjects in the sham group with missing data are successes.  
Imputation of missing data may be performed on secondary and exploratory endpoints as well.  
Pooling  
Subgroup analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint by [CONTACT_384], and US vs OU S, will be used to evaluate 
the poolability of the results. The significance of center -to-center variability in treatment effect will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_288381] a logistic regression model. 
In the case tha t poolability is questionable, the reasons for differential treatment effect, such as subject 
and clinical characteristics, will be investigated and reported.

[ADDRESS_1129699] a role in the reduction of ischemic recurrences in patients with atherosclerotic  disease 
manifestations  [1,2]. These observations indeed challenge a dogma in cardiovascular medicine 
which for decades  has empha sized that atherothrombotic complications are primarily platelet 
mediated and accordingly should be treated with platelet inhibiting therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. In particular, a 
single antiplatelet agent, most commonly aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], is the standard of care in stable settings, w hile 
the combination of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_512996] a P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor, also kno wn as dual antiplatelet 
therapy  (DAPT) , has been the cornerstone of treatment following an acute coronary syndrome or 
stent implantation  [3,4]. The benefits associated with P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors in these high-risk 
patients is likely attributed to the central role of P2Y 12 mediated signaling in platelet activation 
and aggregation processes  [5,6]. Moreover, potent P2Y [ADDRESS_1129700] non -purinergic signaling pathways as well as modulate thrombin generation  [5-9]. The 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_815766], as well as on inflammatory reactions, has also 
raised interest on strategies targeting thrombin -mediated effects. These include blockade  of the 
PAR -1 receptor on the platelet surface with vorapaxar and inhibition of circulating thrombin 
through blockade of an upstream target in the coagulation cascade with the anti -Xa inhibitor 
rivaroxaban  [3,4,10,11] .  
However, a lthough the introduction o f newer antithrombotic strategies ha s been 
associated with a reduction in ischemic recurrences  in high -risk patients , these have been 
consistently associated with an increase in bleeding complications  [3,4,10,11 ]. These have been 
observed particularly with the combination of an oral anticoagulant agent , including low -dose 
rivaroxaban, with standard DAPT , also known as “triple therapy ” [1,3,4,11,12 ]. Observation s

pathways triggering thrombotic complications aspi[INVESTIGATOR_815767]  [2,7,13-15]. This has also led to the challenge  of another 
dogma which is whether aspi[INVESTIGATOR_815768] . These observations have  set the basis for a large number of clinical outcomes 
studies evaluating whether droppi[INVESTIGATOR_815769] a better safety profile without a tradeoff in  
efficacy  [16]. Amongst these strategies, the  use of low-dose rivaroxaban in adjunct to a P2Y 12 
inhibitor, also known as dual thera py, has been proposed  [2]. Moreover, the interplay between 
thrombin and P2Y 12-mediated platelet signaling may support a synergistic effect on thrombus 
formation by [CONTACT_815783]  [5,6,10 ]. This approach may be of potential benefit to 
reduce atherothrombotic complications in high -risk patients following an acute coronary event . 
On the other hand , regimens with more modest antithrombotic effects  compared with a 
combination of low -dose rivaroxaban and a P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor such as low -dose 
rivaroxaban alone or in combination with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_815770].  
 
STUDY RATIONALE  
To date there is very little data, and not conducted in human subjects, on the interplay 
between anti -Xa blockade with low -dose rivaroxaban  and antiplatelet therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and in particular 
how this affects profiles of platelet reactivity and thrombin generation  [17]. Given the potential 
role for the use of low -dose rivaroxaban for the prevention of ischemic recurrences in patients 
with atherothr ombotic disease manifestations, including coronary artery disease (CAD) and

 peripheral arterial disease (PAD), we hereby [CONTACT_815784] a prospective pharmacodynamic (PD) 
investigation assessing the impact of low -dose rivaroxaban when used in combination with 
antiplatelet treatment regimens commonly used in clinical practice.  
 
REASERCH PLAN  
Study design  
The proposed investigation will be a prospective PD study conducted in cohorts of 
patients with CAD  or PAD on treatment per standard of care for at least 3 months  with either 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (81mg/qd), aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (81mg/qd) plus clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (75mg/qd), or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (81mg/qd) plus 
ticagrelor (90mg/bid) will be identified. The study will be performed at the University of  [LOCATION_012] 
Health Science Center at UF Health Jacksonville - Division of Cardiology. Patients will be 
recruited in the Cardiology Clinics of our institution and will be screened by [CONTACT_815785], who will verify that all candidates meet inclusion  and exclusion criteria. Results 
from blood tests performed within the last 90 days will be considered valid for screening 
purposes. If these are not available, a blood sample will be collected for the screening phase.  
After providing written informed cons ent, e ach cohort will be treated with adjunctive 
low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg/bid) for 7 -10 days , after which aspi[INVESTIGATOR_815771] 7 -10 days. PD assessments will be conducted at 3 time points: i) baseline (while on standard 
of care antipla telet therapy), ii) 7-10 days after adjunctive treatment with low dose rivaroxaban, 
and iii) 7-10 days after droppi[INVESTIGATOR_458133]. In addition, a control cohort of subjects with atrial 
fibrillation on full dose rivaroxaban (20  mg/qd) will be recruited  and will  undergo a single PD 
assessment . Figure [ADDRESS_1129702] of droppi[INVESTIGATOR_815772], 
this approach will allow for the assessment of PD profiles associate d with 10 different 
antithrombotic treatment regimens: 3 monotherapy, 5 dual therapy, and 2 triple therapy regimens 
(Figure 2).  PD measures will include a multitude of assays aimed to assess various measures of 
platelet reactivity, including purinergic and non -purinergic signaling pathways, and thrombin 
generation , as described below . PD assessm ent will be carried out at time points reflecting trough 
levels of effects of antithrombotic agents. Although the study will have an open -label design, 
laboratory personnel will be blinded to treatment assignments. Compliance with antithrombotic

Description of laboratory assays  
Confidential  
November 15, 2018  Protocol version 5 
 
10 
 1) VerifyNow (VN) PRU : The VN System i s a turbidimetric based optical detection system 
which measures platelet induced aggregation as an increase in light transmittance (Accumetrics, 
San Diego, CA) and will be utilized according to manufacturer’s instructions, as previously 
described [ 8]. The assay is based on microbead agglutination and uses specific reagents for the 
pathways of interest. The VN -PRU assay, by [CONTACT_8293]+PGE1, measures changes in 
platelet function specific to P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors. The assay is based upon the ability of 
activated platelets to bind fibrinogen. Fibrinogen -coated microparticles aggregate in proportion 
to the number of GP IIb/IIIa receptors expressed. Light transmittance increases as activated 
plate lets bind and aggregate fibrinogen -coated beads. The instrument measures this change in 
optical signal and reports results in P2Y 12 Reaction Units (PRU).  
2) Whole blood vasodilator -stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP):  VASP phosphorylation 
(VASP -P) is a marker  of P2Y 12 receptor signaling . VASP will be assessed utilizing the ELISA 
VASP -P kit (Biocytex Inc., Marseille, [LOCATION_009]) as previously described [ 8]. Blood samples will be  
collected in tubes anticoagulated with trisodium citrate  and processed and analyzed within [ADDRESS_1129707] step of parallel whole 
blood sample activation with PGE1 and PGE1+ADP, platelets from the sample are lysed, 
allowing released VASP to be captured b y an anti -human VASP antibody, which is coated in the 
microtiter plate.  Then, a peroxidase -coupled anti -human VASP -P antibody binds to 
phosphorylated serine 239 antigenic determinant of VASP. The bound enzyme peroxidase is 
then revealed by [CONTACT_181847] a predetermined time. After stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_433110], absorbance at 450 nm is directly related to the concentration of VASP -P contained in 
the sample.  PGE1 increases VASP -P levels by [CONTACT_8291]. Binding of ADP 
to P2Y 12 leads to Gi -coupled inhibition of adenylate cyclase. Therefore, the addition of ADP to 
Confidential  
November 15, 2018  Protocol version 5 
 
11 
 PGE1 -stimulated platelets reduces PGE1 -induced VASP -P levels. If P2Y 12 receptors are 
successfully inhibited, addition of ADP will not reduce the PGE1 -stimulated VASP -P levels. The 
platelet reactivity index (PRI) will be  calculated using optical density (OD 450 nm) of samples 
incubated with PGE 1 or PGE 1 and ADP according to the formula: VASP = [(OD450nm (PGE 1) – 
OD450nm (PGE 1+ADP)) / OD450nm (PGE 1)] × 100.  
3) Light transmittance aggregometry (LTA):  Platelet aggregation will be performed using LTA 
according to standard protocols. Blood will be collected in citrated (3. 2%) tubes. LTA will be 
assessed using platelet -rich plasma (PRP) by [CONTACT_8294]  a 2-channel 
aggregometer (Chrono -Log 490 Model, Chrono -Log Corp., Havertown) as previously described 
[8]. Platelet agonists will include arachidonic acid ( AA; 1 mM), collagen ( 3µg/ml) , ADP (5 and 
20 µM)  and thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP, 15 μ M). TF-CaCl 2 [17] reconstituted at 
a 2x concentration (Neoplastine Cl Plus, Diagnostica Stago reconstituted in 32.5 mM CaCl 2) and 
a combination of 2 µg/ml collagen -related peptide + 5 µM ADP + TF-CaCl 2 (CAT F) will also be 
used as agonists . The reagent cocktail CAT F will allow to assess the overall platelet response to 
a combination of agonists that leads to activation of multiple platelet pathways , including 
thrombin generation . PRP will be obtained as a supernatant after centrifugation of citrated bloo d 
at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes. The isolated PRP will be kept at 37° C before use. Platelet -poor 
plasma (PPP) will be obtained by a second centrifugation of the blood fraction at 2800 rpm for 
10 minutes. Light transmission will be adjusted to 0% with the PRP  and to 100% for the PPP for 
each measurement. Curves will be recorded for 6 minutes and platelet aggregation will be 
determined as the maximal percent change (MPA) in light transmittance from baseline using PPP 
as a reference.

 4) Serum thromboxane B2:  The concentration of serum thromboxane B2 (TXB2) will be 
measured by [CONTACT_2329] a Thromboxane B2 ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Inc, Minneapolis, MN) 
according to the instructions of the manufacturer [18]. Briefly, samples will be diluted with  
Calibrator Diluent RD5 -[ADDRESS_1129708] curve will be 
established by [CONTACT_8297]2 between 20ng/mL and 0.313 ng/mL using Calibrator 
Diluent R D5-[ADDRESS_1129709] concentrations versus percentage bound/maximum 
bound . 
5) TEG 6s Series system:  the TEG 6s system (Haemonetics  Corporation, Braintree, MA, [LOCATION_003]) 
will be used according to manufacture instructions [ 19]. In brief, the CORA® system is a new 
generation portable thrombelastography technology able to evaluate all phases of hemostasis, 
including time to clot formation, ra te of clot formation, strength of clot and residual clot strength 
due to antiplatelet drugs, rate of clot lysis. Disposable assay cartridges contain all of the 
components necessary to allow the analyzer to prepare samples and perform hemostasis tests. 
The analyzer automatically draws the blood into the active area of the cartridge, meters the exact 
amount required for the test, and mixes it with the reagents spotted in the cartridge. The analyzer 
then monitors the harmonic motion of a pendant drop of blood in response to external vibration. 
As the sample transitions from a liquid state to a gel -like state during clotting, the modulus of 
elasticity and resonant frequency increase. The instrument measures these variations in resonant 
frequency during clotting and lysis. The results are displayed in a table and on a graphical tracing 
that reflects a hemostasis profile of clot formation. The resulting hemostasis profile is a measure 
of the time it takes for the first measurable clot to be formed, the kinetics of clot formation, the 
Confidential  
November 15, [ADDRESS_1129710] received 
platelet inhibiting drugs. The PlateletMappi[INVESTIGATOR_124365] c onsists of a set of agonists, ADP and AA 
together with ActivatorF, which can measure the inhibition of platelet function. This assay 
specifically determines the MA (Maximum Amplitude, a measure of clot strength) and the 
reduction in MA due to antiplatelet therapy and reports it as a percentage of reduction in clot 
strength. The HKH reagent , a combination of kaolin and heparinase, generates test data for the 
uninhibited MA resulting from thrombin activation of the blood sample, while the heparinase 
neutraliz es the effects of heparin. The HKH test provides measures of R (Reaction time; the 
amount of time between the start of the test and the beginning of coagulation), K (the speed of 
formation of the clot from R time to a specific clot strength), Angle (the sp eed of clot 
strengthening), LY30 (Percent lysis 30 minutes after MA is finalized) and MA parameters. T he 
AA and ADP test provide measures of MA, percent inhibition and percent aggregation.  
6) Thrombin Generation Assay : TGA assays will be performed using PP P samples prepared 
from the various treatment groups  [20]. The TGA assay will be carried out  using 
Technothrombin® fluorogenic assay kit (Diapharma) following manufacturer’s reco mmended 
guidelines . Briefly, a reaction mix is prepared containing low or high amounts of TF and 
phospholipid micelles, plus the fluorogenic thrombin substrate (1 mM Z -G-G-R-AMC, 15 mM 
CaCl 2). Test samples will be analyzed in duplicate by [CONTACT_815786] a 3:2 ratio in a 96 -well plate . After addition of samples, plates will be incubated at 
37oC in a water bath, and kinetics of thrombin generation will be  recorded for 60 min at 1 min 
intervals using Synergy -2 fluorescence plate reader set at ~360 nm/~460 nm excitation/emission. 
Data will be recorded in BioTek’s Gen 5 software and analyzed using BioTek FLx800 Gen

analysis.  
 
Study endpoints and statistical analysis  
The primary end point of our study will be the comparison of markers of platelet 
aggregation (PRU, PRI,  MPA,  TXB2 ), thrombin generation, and thrombus formation  with or 
without low -dose rivaroxaban in addition to each regimen of antiplatelet therapy (intrag roup 
comparisons  – visit 1 vs visit 2 within each treatment arm ). Exploratory  end points will include : 
1) intragroup comparisons before and after droppi[INVESTIGATOR_458133]  (visit 2 vs visit 3 within each 
treatment arm) of all markers of platelet aggregation , thrombin generation, and thrombus 
formation;  2) comparisons of  markers of  platelet aggregation , thrombin generation, and 
thrombus formation  among each treatment arm at visit 2 and visit 3 . Since there are no 
preliminary data exploring the PD effects of low -dose rivaroxaban in addition to antiplatelet 
therapy, we arbitrarily chose a sample size of 20 patients per group (total 80 patients) . This 
approach is in line with guidelines for pi[INVESTIGATOR_8265] [ 21]. 
For baseline characteristics, c ategorical variables will be expressed a s frequencies and 
percentages; c ontinuous variables will be presented as mean ± SD  or median [IQR] . Continuous 
variables will be analyzed for normal distribution with the Kolmogorov -Smirnov test. 
Comparisons for the primary end  point as well as for other intragroup comparisons of continuous 
variables will be performed with a linear mixed -effect model with treatment as fixed effects, 
patient as a random effect  and baseline value of the corresponding platelet function test as a 
covariate. Intergroup comparisons will be performed with an analysis of variance, without 
adjustment for multiple comparisons. Results will be reported as mean and 95% CI, and 
Confidential  
November 15, 2018  Protocol version 5 
 
15 
 treatment differences as mean difference and 95% CI of the difference. A p -value <  0.05 will be 
considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis will be performed with SPSS version 24 
software (SPSS Inc.).  
 
Publication Strategy/Additional Information   
Study subjects will be identified first (months 1 -20): we expect to enroll approximately 4 
subjects monthly and complete enrollment in 20 months (total: 80 subjects enrolled). Months 21-
[ADDRESS_1129711]  prospective study and is based on well -established methods. However, since 
there is limited experience wi th the effects of low -dose rivaroxaban on platelet function, 
variability may be higher than expected and we cannot currently perform a detailed sample size 
calculation. We anticipate adding this to the protocol after inclusion of the study population has 
been completed. If the sample size after one year is estimated to be too small, additional patients 
will be included. This approach is in agreement with recommendations for pi[INVESTIGATOR_8265] 
[21]. 
 
Safety and Adverse Events  
In clinical trials, the most important adverse effect associated with the use of low -dose 
rivaroxaban was bleeding. The risk of major bleeding with rivaroxab an was 1 -1.8%; the risk of 
intracranial hemorrhage was 0.4% at 2 years  [1,2]. However, such bleeding prevalence occurred 
in the setting of long -term trial, while our study is limited to only [ADDRESS_1129712] also excluded from the study patients at increased risk of bleeding complications. Other 
rivaroxaban reported side effects include abnormal liver function tests ( 0.2%) [ 1].  
All adverse  events described above, if they were to occur, as well as death, myocardial 
infarction, stroke, procedures of  urgent revascularization with PCI or coronary artery by[CONTACT_87258]. Serious a dverse  events will be evaluated by a local data safety 
monitoring board (DSMB) committee, comprised of 2 faculty members (2 cardiologists), not 
directly involved in the research. In the event of a report of a serious adverse event (as defined 
below) the DSMB will meet and antip latelet treatment management will be managed, including 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_513013], according to physician recommendation.  
 
I. Management of Safety Data  
This Study has been designated as an interventional study.  Janssen requirements for IIS 
intervention al studies are all adverse events regardless of causality and special situations 
excluding those from subjects not exposed to a Janssen Medicinal Product  and product 
quality complaints with or without an adverse event will be reported, once the subject has  
signed and dated an Informed Consent Form is obtained until the subject has completed 
participation in the study and for [ADDRESS_1129713] dose of study drug.  
 
II. Definitions  
a. Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a 
medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) product. An adverse event does not necessarily 
have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event  can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated 
with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non - investigational) product, whether or not related 
to that medicinal (invest igational or non -investigational) product. (Definition per International 
Conference on Harmonisation [ICH]).  
Confidential  
November 15, [ADDRESS_1129714]  
Events that Janssen Scientific Affairs is actively monitoring as a result of a previously identified 
signal (even if non -serious).  These adverse events are:  
 
• Suspected severe toxic effect on the bone marrow, such as severe thrombocytopenia 
(platelet count less than 50,000/μL), severe neutropenia (white blood cell count less than 
500/μL), pancytopenia, aplastic anemia  
• Suspected severe hypersensitivity reaction (e g, anaphylaxis, angioedema, severe 
urticaria, bronchospasm, etc.)  
• Severe skin reactions such as Stevens -Johnson Syndrome  
• Suspected severe liver injury  
 
c. Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR)  
A valid ICSR must contain the four minimum criteria required to meet regulatory reporting 
requirements.  
• an identifiable subject (not disclosing the subject’s name [CONTACT_3816])  
• an identifiable reporter (investigational site)  
• a Janssen medicinal product  
• an adverse event, outcome, or certain special situation  
 
The minimum  information required is:  
• suspected Janssen product (doses, indication)  
• date of therapy (start and end date, if available)  
• batch or lot number, if available  
• subject details (subject ID and country)  
• gender

 • age at AE onset  
• reporter ID  
• adverse event detail (A E verbatim in English), onset date, relatedness, causality, action 
taken, outcome, (if available)  
• Janssen protocol ID  
 
 
 
d. Product Quality Complaint (PQC)  
A product quality compliant is related to a potential quality issue during manufacturing, 
packaging, release testing, stability monitoring, dose preparation, storage or distribution of the 
product, or delivery system.  Not all PQCs involve a subject.  Lot and batch numbers are of high 
significance and need to be collected whenever available.  
 
Examples of PQC include but not limited to:  
• Functional Problem: e.g., altered delivery rate in a controlled release product  
• Physical Defect:  e.g. abnormal odor, broken or crushed tablets/capsules  
• Potential Dosing Device Malfunction: e.g.,  autoinjector  button not working, needle 
detaching from syringe  
• Suspected Contamination  
• Suspected Counterfeit.  
 
e. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal 
Products for Human Use is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
(The subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.)

• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product  
• Is medically important*  
 
*Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is also appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56795] y jeopardize 
the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
definition above. These should usually be considered serious.

• Social reasons, e.g. overnight stay because of distance between home and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
• Surgery or pr ocedure planned and documented prior to entry into the Study.  
 
Any event requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462861] a serious adverse event, except hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23741]:  
• Hospi [INVESTIGATOR_23742] (e.g., social 
reasons such as pending placement in long -term care facility)  
• Surgery or procedure planned before entry into the study. [Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_815774] s tart of data collection and where the underlying

The cause of death of a subject in a study within [ADDRESS_1129715] dose of study drug, 
whether or not the event is expected or associated with the study drug, is considered a 
serious adverse event.  
 
f. Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information  
An adverse event is considered unlisted if the nature or severity is not consistent with the 
applicable product reference safety information. For a medicinal product(s) with a 
marketing autho rization, the expectedness of an adverse event will be determined by 
[CONTACT_83407].  
 
III. Special Situations   
Safety events of interest for a Janssen medicinal product that require expediting reporting 
and/or safety evaluation include, but are not limited to:  
• Drug exposure during pregnancy (maternal and paternal)  
• Overdose of a Janssen medicinal product  
• Exposure to a Janssen medicinal product from breastfeeding  
• Suspected abuse/misuse of a Janssen medicinal pro duct 
• Inadvertent or accidental exposure to a Janssen medicinal product  
• Any failure of expected pharmacological action (i.e., lack of effect) of a Janssen 
medicinal product  
• Medication error involving a Janssen medicinal product (with or without patient 
exposure to the Janssen medicinal product, e.g., name [CONTACT_2976])  
• Suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal  
• Unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefit from use of a Janssen medicinal product  
 
Confidential  
November 15, 2018  Protocol version 5 
 
21 
 These safety events may not meet the defini tion of an adverse event; however, they are treated 
in the same manner as adverse events. Special situations should be recorded on the Adverse 
Event page of the CRF.  
 
Any special situation that meets the criteria of a serious adverse event should be record ed on a 
Serious Adverse Event Report Form and be reported to Janssen Scientific Affairs within [ADDRESS_1129716] be reported to Janssen Scientific Affairs by [CONTACT_513019] 24 hours of their awareness of the event  using the Serious Adverse 
Event Form. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g. spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and 
congenital anomaly) are considered serious adverse events and must be reported using the 
Serious A dverse Event Form.  
 
Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study must be promptly withdrawn from the 
study and discontinue further study treatment.  
 
Because the effect of the Janssen medicinal product on sperm is unknown, pregnancies in 
partners of m ale subjects exposed to a Janssen medicinal product will be reported by [CONTACT_513020] 24 hours of their awareness of the event  using the Serious 
Adverse Event Form.  Depending on local legislation this may require prior consent of the 
partner. 
 
Follow -up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal sequelae 
in the infant will be required.  
 
V. Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events and Pregnancies [and/or Pregnancies in Partners]  
All adverse events, whether serious or non -serious, related or not related, special situations, 
pregnancy exposures and/or pregnancies in partners following exposure to a Janssen medicinal 
product are to be documented by [CONTACT_513021] e CRF and in the subject’s 
Confidential  
November 15, [ADDRESS_1129717].  
All (serious and non -serious) adverse events reported for a Janssen medicinal pr oduct should 
be followed -up in accordance with clinical practice.  
 
All serious adverse events that have not resolved by [CONTACT_2054], or that have not 
resolved upon discontinuation of the subject's participation in the study, must be followed until  
any of the following occurs:  
• The event resolves  
• The event stabilizes  
• The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available  
• The event can be attributed to agents other than the study drug or to factors unrelated to 
study conduct  
• It becomes  unlikely that any additional information can be obtained (subject or health care 
practitioner refusal to provide additional information, lost to follow -up after demonstration 
of due diligence with follow -up efforts)  
 
All serious adverse events, pregnancy exposures and/or pregnancies in partners for Janssen 
medicinal products under study should be reported directly by [CONTACT_513022], 
within [ADDRESS_1129718] be reported directly by [CONTACT_547907], within 24 hours becoming aware , to Janssen Scientific Affairs usi ng the 
Janssen Scientific Affair’s Serious Adverse Event Report Form.  
 
A listing of non -serious AEs will also be provided to Janssen Scientific Affairs at end of 
study to cover the requirements of TV -SOP-[ADDRESS_1129719]. Timely, accurate, and 
complete reporting and analysis of PQC information from studies are crucial for the protection of 
patients, investigators, and Janssen Scientific Affairs , and are mandated by [CONTACT_223912]. Janssen Scientific Affairs has established procedures in conformity with regulatory 
requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of PQC information.  Lot and/or Batch #s 
shall be collect ed or any reports of failure of expected pharmacological action (i.e., lack of effect).  
 
All initial PQCs involving a Janssen product under study must be reported to Janssen Scientific 
Affairs by [CONTACT_513024] [ADDRESS_1129720], and as such the data shall be made available within a reasonable 
timeframe at Janssen Scientific Affair’s request.  
 
VIII. Transmission Methods:  
The following methods are acceptable for transmission of safety information to Janssen Scientific 
Affairs:  
• Electronically via Janssen SECURE Email service (preferred)  
• For business continuity purposes, if SECURE Email is non -functional:  
o Facsimile (fax), receipt of which is evidenced in a successful fax transmission report  
Confidential  
November 15, 2018  Protocol version 5 
 
24 
 • Telephone (if fax is non -functional).  
 
Please use the contact [CONTACT_83412].  
 
IX. Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events (AE), Serious Adverse Events (SAE), Pregnancy, 
and Product Quality Complaints (PQC) to Janssen Scientific Affairs  
 
A. AEs, SAEs, Special Situations and Pregnancy Reporting.  
The Institution and the Sponsor Investigator  will transmit SAEs and Special Situations in a form 
provided by [CONTACT_513026], in 
English within 24 -hours of becoming aware of the event(s).  
 
All available clinical information relevant to the evaluation of a related SAE or Special Situation is 
required.  
 
• The Institution and/or Sponsor Investigator  are responsible for ensuring that these cases are 
complete and if not are promptly followed -up. A safety report is not considered complete until 
all clinical details needed to interpret the case are received. Reporting of follow -up information 
should follow the same timeline as initial reports.  
 
• Copie s of any and all relevant correspondences with regulatory authorities and ethics 
committees regarding any and all serious adverse events, irrespective of association with the 
Janssen Product under study, are to be provided to Janssen Scientific Affairs usi ng a 
transmission method in Section VIII within [ADDRESS_1129721] should be quarantined 
immediately and if possible, take a pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103].

X. Reconciliation of SAEs  
At a minimum, on a quarterly basis and at the end of the Study, Janssen Scientific Affairs will 
provide to the Institution and/or Sponsor Investigator, a listing of all SAEs reported to Janssen 
Scientific Affairs.  The Sponsor Investigator will review this listing and provide any discrepancies 
to Janssen Scientific Affairs.   
 
Upon request, Institution and/or Sp onsor Investigator shall provide Janssen Scientific Affairs with 
a summary list of all SAEs, and AEs of Special Interest and Special Reporting Situation reports to 
date, for reconciliation purposes.  
 
XI. Dissemination of Safety Information from Janssen Scienti fic Affairs to Institution/Sponsor 
Investigator  Sponsor Investigator will be responsible for submitting IND safety reports for the 
Study Product to Institution’s IRB in accordance with Federal regulations [ADDRESS_1129722] Study visit according to the Protocol (i.e. Last Subject  Last Visit has occurred).  
 
 
Possible benefits  
The present investigation is aimed to evaluate the PD effects of low -dose rivaroxaban as 
an add -on therapy to standard antiplatelet treatment in patients with CAD. This study is not 
designed to evaluate differences in clinical benefit. However, differences in antiplatelet profiles 
may potentially prompt further investigations of the clinical implication of this difference by 
[CONTACT_3553] a larger scale clinical study.

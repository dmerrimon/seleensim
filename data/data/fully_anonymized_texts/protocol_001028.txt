Study:  CLI [ZIP_CODE]: A Randomized, Multi -center, Open -label, Controlled, In Vivo 
Study to Assess the Recovery and Survival of Radiolabeled Autologous INTERCEPT Apheresis Platelet Components Suspended in 100% Plasma Stored for up to 7 Days  
Investigators / Study Sites:   Jose Cancelas -Perez, MD, PhD (Hoxworth Blood Center)

Institute)  
Studied period (years):  
  Date of first enrollment: TBD  
  Date of last completed: TBD  Phase of development:   2 
Objective s:  
The principle objective of this study is to evaluate the hypothesis that INTERCEPT Platelets in 100% plasma stored for 5 or more days ( up to 7 days ) after apheresis collection retain 
sufficient viability for therapeutic transfusion efficacy. T he post -infusion recovery and survival  
of autologous radiolabeled  7 day  INTERCEPT platelets  (Test) stored  in 100% plasma will be 
measured in comparison to “fresh” autologous radiolabeled platelets ( Control ) according to 
FDA guidance for platelet testing (FDA 1999)  in Stage [ADDRESS_7586] platelets 
prepared for radiolabeling using the procedures outlined by [CONTACT_8472] (BEST , Appendix B ) or a  variation of the BEST procedure 
(referred to as Variant  1, Appendix C ) in Stage [ADDRESS_7587] -infusion viability outcome s.

of Radiolabeled Autologous INTERCEPT Apheresis Platelet Components Suspended in 100% Plasma Stored for 
up to [ADDRESS_7588] to 
disclosure without express written consent from Cerus Corporation.  Methodology : 
Study Design  
The study will be performed in two  stages (Table S -1). Stage [ADDRESS_7589] 
or Variant  1 methods (depending on the period and randomization scheme for the Test 
platelets) for [ADDRESS_7590] the  fresh 
platelet Control. With agreement from the FDA (BQ200481, July 8, 2020), completion of 
Stage [ADDRESS_7591] of healthy subjects who meet the FDA, 
AABB, and site -specific research donor eligibility criteria for apheresis platelet donation.  
Apheresis platelets will be collecte d in 100% plasma  on the Trima Accel® Automated Blood 
Collection  system .  
Each study apheresis collection will be processed using the INTERCEPT Blood System for 
Platelets . Platelet c omponents  containing 3.0 to 7.9 x1011 platelets in 300 to 420 mL of plasma 
will be processed using the INTERCEPT Dual Storage (DS) set.  The INTERCEPT process 
will begin on either the day of collection  (Day 0) or the day following donation (Day 1); 
illumination must occur within [ADDRESS_7592]  platelet s components 
will be stored for up to 7 days, from day of collection, in 100% plasma.   
During each stage s amples  for in vitro  platelet testing will be collected prior to INTERCEPT 
treatment  (Day 0/1) , post INTERC EPT treatment and at the end of storage, Day 7 (see In vitro  
evaluation of platelets below).  
At the end of storage , an aliquot of Test platelets  will be aseptically removed from each 
subject’s INTERCEPT platelet storage container for preparation of samples for  radiolabelin g 
using either the BEST (Stage 1) or Variant  1 (Stages 1 and 2) methodology.  The in vitro  
quality of the Test platelet sample  used for radiolabeling will be assessed prior to and 
following the pre -radiolabeling platelet sample preparations. The i ndices to be measured  in 
Stage 1  are volume, pH 22°C, CD62P, platelet count , red blood cell (RBC) count and white 
blood cell (WBC) count .  Assessments of these indices will enab le the determination of platelet 
processing recovery for each  sample preparation method and evaluation of RBC and WBC 
contamination in samples prior to radiolabeling. In Stage 2 platelet processing recovery during 
sample preparation will be calculated from  volume and platelet count  and pH 22°C, will be 
measured in the sample prior to radiolabeling . 
On the day corresponding to the end of storage for the Test component, healthy subjects will 
return to the site , and 43 mL of whole blood (WB) will be  drawn into a syringe containing 
9 mL of Anticoagulant Citrate Dextrose Solution, Formula A ( ACD- A). The sample will be 
used to prepare Control platelets following the BEST methodology . Test and Control platelets

Platelets treated with the INTERCEPT 
Pathogen Reduction System Suspended in 100% Plasma  and stored for up to 7 days  
will be randomly radiolabeled with either 51Cr (approximately10 -30μCi) as sodium 
radiochromate (Na 251CrO 4) or 111In (approximately 10- 30 μCi) as indium oxine , depending 
upon the randomization assignment  and period as  applicable. Subjects will be randomized with 
equal probability to the radiolabeling sequences (111In/51Cr vs. 51Cr/111In) for Test/Control.  
The isotope labels will be assigned randomly with equal probability that Control and Test platelets will be labeled with each isotope, and the same randomization  assignment of isotope 
labels will b e utilized for both apheresis collections for the same subject  in Stage [ADDRESS_7594] (approximately 10- 30 mL). A negative pregnancy test for females of 
childbearing potential is required before infusion. 
Blood samples  will be  drawn immediately before infusion and for radioactivity measurements 
at 1 hour ± 15 min and 2 hours  ± [ADDRESS_7595] -infusion (Day 0) , and 6 more samples will be 
drawn at 1, 2, 3, 4 (or 5 or 6), 7 or 8, and 11±[ADDRESS_7596] -infusion (DPI) , at approximately the 
same time of day as the radiolabeled platelet infusion was administered (±4 hours). The exact 
time of each sample draw will be recorded.  
For subjects enrolled in S tage 1, there will be a minimum washout period of four  weeks 
between the two study periods (e.g., four  weeks after the last blood sample at 11±1 DPI, in 
Period 1). Subjects will be monitored for safety (adverse events) from the first apheresis 
procedure until  [ADDRESS_7597] Control

Efficacy:  
Primary endpoint s 
The primary efficacy endpoints for Stage 1 and Stage 2 : 
• Post-infusion recovery at end of storage   
• Post-infusion survival  at end of storage  
Using the FDA standard on platelet viability by [CONTACT_8476] (i.e., recovery and survival compared to a “fresh” autologous platelet sample as control, drawn and prepared on day of 
reinfusion of radiolabeled test samples), the acceptance criteria are:  
• Lower bound of a two- sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the mean treatment 
difference (Test -0.66×Control) in post -infusion recovery is greater than or equal to 
zero.  
• Lower bound of a two- sided 95% CI for the mean treatment difference 
(Test -0.58×Control) in survival is greater than or equal to zero.  
For Stage 1 , the above criteria for recovery and survival of INTERCEPT components will be 
evaluated separately for INTERCEPT platelets  (Test)  labeled with the BEST and Variant  1 
procedures.  
Secondary endpoints  (product  parameter evaluation of platelet components)  
For each stage, t he secondary efficacy endpoints will be summarized descriptively and are 
based on product parameters post -INTERCEPT treatment  and at end of storage.   
Product Parameters at the end of INTERCEPT Treatment  
• Platelet count, volume, and dose (≥3.0×1011)

Primary endpoints  
Stage 1’s recovery and survival data with 7- day platelet storage will be assessed separately by 
[CONTACT_7416] -radiolabeling platelet sample preparation (BEST or Variant 1) and compared with its 
paired control descriptively.   
For Stage 2, t he following acceptance criteria fo r recovery and survival will be used to 
demonstrate  non- inferiority of Test ( stored INTERCEPT treated) platelets against Control 
(fresh) platelets:  
(1) For post -infusion recovery:  
 H0: Test -  0.66×Control <0 vs. H 1: Test -  0.66×Control ≥0 
The null hypothesis will be rejected if the lower bound of a two- sided 95% CI for the mean 
treatment difference (Test -  0.66×Control) is greater than or equal to zero.  
(2) For survival : 
 H0: Test -  0.58×Control <0 vs. H 1: Test -  0.58×Control ≥0 
The null hypothesis will be rejected if the lower bound a two -sided 95% CI for the mean 
treatment difference (Test -  0.58×Control) is greater than or equal to zero.  
The primary analysis population for the primary efficacy endpoints will only include subjects 
who have both pai red (Test and Control) recovery and paired survival data for the relevant 
study stage  and/or radiolabeling method.  The two- sided CIs will be computed using the 
variance estimated from a paired t test.  
In the event that non- inferiority cannot be declared for the primary endpoints for Stage 2  with a 
minimum of 24 evaluable subjects, additional exploratory analyses may be conducted to 
quantify the proportions of subjects whose recovery and survival data me et the 0.66 and 0.58 
cutoff, respectively (e.g., platelet recovery from a Test platelet component greater than or equal 
to 66% of platelet recovery from the paired fresh control platelets). 
Secondary e ndpoints  
Data will be summarized descriptively for each stage.  T he proportions of Test platelet 
components with platelet dose  ≥3.0 ×1011 (end of INTERCEPT treatment) , physical platelet 
recovery ≥80%  (end of INTERCEPT treatment), and pH 22°C ≥6.2 (end of storage) will be  
summarized , with the corresponding lower bound of a one -sided 95% CI for the proportion

disclosure without express written consent from Cerus Corporation.  3.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
The INTERCEPT Blood System for P latelets is intended to be used for ex vivo preparation of 
pathogen- reduced apheresis platelet components  (PCs) in ord er to reduce the risk of 
transfusion- transmitted infection (TTI), including sepsis, and as an alternate to gamma 
irradiation for prevention  of transfusion- associated graft -versus -host disease (TA -GVHD).  
The INTERCEPT Blood System  for P latelets is a Class III medical device consisting of plastic 
disposable sets and an illumination device (INTERCEPT Illuminator), which provides a 
controlled dose of ultraviolet A (UVA) light to the PC. The final product is either transfused or stored accor ding to blood center standard operating procedures (SOP), US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA), and American Association of Blood Banks ( AABB ) Guidelines.  
The INTERCEPT Blood System  for P latelets was approved by [CONTACT_1622] i n December 2014  for 
treatment of platelets collected in a commercially available platelet additive solution.  In March 2016, the FDA approved the use of the INTERCEPT System  for treatment of platelets 
suspended in 100% plasma.  As part of the approval, Cerus committed to a post -approval study 
to evaluate the recovery and survival of apheresis platelets suspended in 100% plasma and treated with the INTERCEPT Blood System for Platelets . Cerus also received approval for 
INTERCEPT Processing Sets manufactured with alternate p lastics and design changes and the 
INT100G2 Illuminator in May 2018. 
The current maximal expi[INVESTIGATOR_8430] s in the U.S. is [ADDRESS_7636] been due to increased risk of bacteri al 
proliferation associated with initial contamination of the platelet components and subsequent 
increased risk of transfusion related sepsis ( Kleinman , et al. 2013). These limitations may be 
resolved by [CONTACT_8480] e the risk of transfusion 
related sepsis. Extension of apheresis platelet component expi[INVESTIGATOR_8431] 6 or 7 days  after 
collection would increase the availability and reduce the wastage of PCs. The feasibility for 
extension of storage of INTERCEPT platelets for up to 7 days  without increasing the risk of 
bacterial contamination and transfusion- related sepsis is supported by [CONTACT_8481] >4 log
10 with negative cultures at outdate  
(Schmidt  2015, W agner 2016) , in vitro  platelet function stud ies (CLI [ZIP_CODE] and CLI  [ZIP_CODE]) 
and an in vivo  recovery and survival pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] ( CLI [ZIP_CODE]) of apheresis -derived PCs 
suspended in either 100% plasma or platelet additive solution (35% plasma/ 65%  PAS -3). The 
therapeutic efficacy of INTERCEPT PC s stored for 7 days  is supported by a Phase 3 study 
(Lozano , et al. 2011) and post -marketing experience obtained in several European countries 
where the INTERCEPT Blood System  for Platelets  is licensed for [ADDRESS_7637] 
demonstrated no cases of definite transfusion related sepsis (Amsler and Jutzi, Swissmedic Haemovigilance Annual Report 2014). Routine experience in Innsbruck, Aus tria showed no

of Radiolabeled Autologous INTERCEPT Apheresis Platelet Components Suspended in 100% Plasma Stored for 
up to [ADDRESS_7638] in clinical outcomes in massively transfused patients  (Amato 2016, Nussbaumer 
2017) . Cumulatively, this body of evidence warrants the in vivo characterization of recovery 
and survival of INTERCEPT PCs stored for up to [ADDRESS_7639] -infusion radiolabeled recovery and survival of 
INTERCEPT platelets (Tes t) suspended in 100% plasma and stored for up to 7 days to fresh 
autologous platelets  (Control)  prepared from platelet rich plasma (PRP) isolated from whole 
blood. The results of this study are intended to support an extended shelf -life claim beyond 5 
days of storage for INTERCEPT platelets suspended in either 100% plasma  or 35% plasma/ 
65% PAS -3 using the currently approved INTERC EPT platelet processing sets (Small 
Volume, SV, Large Volume, LV or Dual Storage, DS).  
Although radiolabeling studies have been performed with stored apheresis platelets in additive 
solutions (Vassallo 2010 and Dumont 2013)  and apheresis platelets in 100% plasma 
(Dumont  2002 and Vassallo 2004), quality control of the platelet samples processed for 
radiolabeling has not been perform ed.  Cerus has evaluated variations  of the Biomedical 
Excellence for Safer Transfusion Collaboration ( BEST)  platelet handling methods prior to 
radiolabeling to optimize  platelet recovery and improve platelet quality (VAL [ZIP_CODE] and 
REL [ZIP_CODE]).  These studies have shown that the platelet preparation procedure described in 
the BEST version 4.2.1 protocol may not be optim al for preparing  stored apheresis platelets  
for radiol abeling  (Steps 4.[ADDRESS_7640] Platelet Radiolabeling Procedure 
Version  4.2.1, Appendix B ).  The first two step s in preparing stored platelet s amples for 
radiolabeling involve anticoagulation an d acidification of the sample , using ACD- A, and a soft 
spin to separate and remove contaminating RBCs and WBCs  (Table 1 ). The se steps are not 
necessary for stored apheresis platelets since the platelet components are collected in ACD- A 
and have low RBC and WBC contamination due to the apheresis collection proce dures.  
Furthermore, the first two steps of the platelet preparation steps  have been shown to decrease 
physical platelet recovery and negatively impact platelet quality ( described further in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) .  The Variant  [ADDRESS_7641] method (referred to as Variant  1, Appendix C ) does 
not include t he first two steps of the platelet preparation steps  (Table 1 ).

3.2 Summary of Nonclinical and Clinical Studies  
The nonclinical and clinical studies are s ummarized in the Package Insert 
(SPC  [ZIP_CODE]- AW v3.0 INTERCEPT Blood System for Platelets – Dual Storage (DS) 
Processing Set). The following paragraphs provide additional background for the proposed 
study. 
3.2.1 In Vivo  Assessments of Stored INTERCEPT Platelets   
Extension of platelet storage for up to 7 days  for INTERCEPT platelets has been explored in 
in vitro  studies ( CLI [ZIP_CODE], CLI  [ZIP_CODE], CLI  [ZIP_CODE] and CLI  [ZIP_CODE]) . The results from these 
studies show  that the in vitro  quality of INTERCEPT platelets stored in 65% PAS -3/35% 
plasma or 100% plasma is adequate when compared to untreated platelets and similar to the 
results published for conventional Amicus platelets stored in Inter Sol (Vassallo  2010) and 
Trima platelets in 100% plasma stored for 5 days (Dumont  2013).  
In addition, Cerus has conducted an in vivo  pi[INVESTIGATOR_8432] ( CLI [ZIP_CODE]) for 
INTERCEPT PCs suspended in platelet additive solution (35% plasma/65% PAS -3) and 100% 
plasma stored for 7 days  and a  study of recovery and survival of INTERCEPT platelets in 35% 
plasma/65% PAS -3 stored for either 6 or 7 days  (CLI [ZIP_CODE]).

Apheresis Platelet Components ( CLI [ZIP_CODE])  
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] ( CLI [ZIP_CODE]) assessed the post -infusion recovery and lifespan (also referred to as 
survi val) of 7-day I NTERCEPT PCs stored in either  35% plasma/65% PAS- 3 or 100% 
plasma , as compared to “fresh” radiolabeled platelets. Preliminary results provide d evidence of 
the feasibility for I NTERCEPT platelets to be stored for up to 7 days , while maintaining 
adequate transfusion viability, regardless of the suspension media.  
Mean radiolabel 24 -h recovery ratios (Test/Control [“fresh” autologous platelets]) of 
INTERCEPT apheresis -derived PCs suspended in 35% plasma and 65% PAS- 3 and stored for 
7 days  was 65.3%  and for INTERCEPT platelets in 100% plasma was 70.9 %. Mean lifespan 
ratio (T est/Control ) was 57.5% for I NTERCEPT PCs suspended in 35% plasma and 65% 
PAS-3 and for INTERCEPT PCs in 100% plasma was 61.0% (Table 3 ). Although, the small 
sample sizes and wide standard deviations limit the conclusions that can be deri ved from this 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the results suggest 7- day storage  of INTERCEPT platelets  is feasible.

[IP_ADDRESS] Recovery and Lifespan of Radiolabeled Autologous INTERCEPT 6 and 7- day 
Stored Apheresis Platelet Components ( CLI [ZIP_CODE])  
CLI [ZIP_CODE], a random ized, cross -over analysis of platelet recovery and survival after 
autologous transfusion of 6- day and 7- day stored INTERCEPT treated Amicus platelets in 
PAS-3 (Inter Sol), was conducted at both HBC and Dartmouth Hitchcock ( DH). While 
conducting CLI  [ADDRESS_7648] version 4.2.1 were 
implemented at HBC to improve platelet yield in response to low recovery after processing 
platelet samples for radiolabeling ; whereas, BEST version 4.2.[ADDRESS_7649] spi[INVESTIGATOR_8433]- A.

Title:  A Randomized, Multi -center, Multi- Stage, Controlled, In Vivo  Study to Assess the Recovery and Survival 
of Radiolabeled Autologous INTERCEPT Apheresis Platelet Components Suspended in 100% Plasma Stored for 
up to [ADDRESS_7650] to 
disclosure without express written consent from Cerus Corporation.  In study CLI  [ZIP_CODE], the DH Investigator noted that 4 of 15 recovery assessments for Control 
(fresh) WB platelets demonstrated recoveries of >100% (101.5; 106.8%; 113.1% and 193.5%); 
the results were highly variable and not aligned with historical data (Dumont 2013; Vassallo 2010) (communicatio n from [CONTACT_8554] dated 4/11/2017). In addition, initial data from HBC 
in CLI  [ADDRESS_7651] to 
the in vivo recovery/survival outcomes compared to CLI  [ZIP_CODE].  
At DH it was noted also that radioactivity of the standards was  not sufficiently high above 
background radioactivity to provide reliable measurement of  specific activity. This problem 
may have been responsible for the unusual results showing radioactivity recoveries of > 100% in [ADDRESS_7652] samples for gamma counting 
was instituted  in CLI  [ZIP_CODE] by [CONTACT_8484]. This resulted in a 50 
to 100- fold increase in the corrected radioactivity counts for the standards above background 
and provided good precision . These DH studies demonstrated the need to implement controls 
to ensure adequate signal -to-noise ratios when measuring the radioactivity associated with the 
standards  as described in this protocol .  
CLI [ZIP_CODE] was terminated for futility  caused by [CONTACT_8485].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Method optimization of preparation of stored platelets for radiolabeling 
A small investigational study was performed to assess the radiolabeling methodologi es used at 
HBC during CLI  [ZIP_CODE].  The results of this study indicated that the addition of acidic 
(pH 4.5 -  5.5), undiluted ACD- A to stored apheresis platelets before the first soft spin per the 
BEST protocol (designed to remove residual RBC and WBC from P RP derived from fresh 
blood) resulted in poor platelet recovery yield and inferior in vitro  platelet quality of the 
aliquots compared with platelets resuspended in diluted, pH adjusted (pH 6.5- 6.8) 
ACD- A/saline. Together with the recovery and survival results from CLI  [ZIP_CODE], these data 
indicated that injury may be induced by [CONTACT_1121] a high [H+] -containing solution 
(ACD- A) when added to stored apheresis PCs.  
Based on the investigational study results, a prospective in vitro  study (VAL [ZIP_CODE]) was  
designed and completed to assess two alternative platelet preparation methods based on the BEST version 4.2.1 protocol for preparation of stored platelet samples for radiolabeling using 
both untreated and INTERCEPT platelets in 100% plasma, collected on the Trima platform and stored for [ADDRESS_7653] protocol  for preparing platelet samples prior to radiolabeling [ Variant  1 
(hard spin only) or Variant 2 (addition of buffered ACD- A/saline instead of ACD- A and 
recombining slow and fast spin pellets )] led to improved in vitro  platelet pH levels, yield 
recovery and quality, when compared to the samples processed with the original

of Radiolabeled Autologous INTERCEPT Apheresis Platelet Components Suspended in 100% Plasma Stored for 
up to [ADDRESS_7654] to 
platelet yield recovery (proportion), platelet lysis, platelet activation and metabolism.  
Cumulatively , the study results supported the use of either variant method as an improved 
platelet sample prep aration method for stored apheresis platelets compared to the original 
BEST version 4.2.[ADDRESS_7655] or Variant  1 methods  (REL [ZIP_CODE]) . 
Data from REL [ZIP_CODE], provided i n Table [ADDRESS_7656] protocol is 
performed on INTERCEPT platelet s, stored for 7 days, the in vitro  recovery of platelets is 
reduced by ~29.4% (BEST 2391 ±381: Variant  1 3389 ±378), rais ing the possibility that 
radiolabeling would be biased by [CONTACT_8486] a selected subset of platelets when using the 
BEST protocol. Although t he manual and flow cytometry- based RBC counts showed that 
apheresis platelet samples prepared with the Variant  [ADDRESS_7657] and Variant  1 protocols 
result ed in < 1:10,000 contamination of the platelet preparations with either RBC or WBC by 
[CONTACT_8487] <1:1,000 by [CONTACT_8488] (assuming that the Mean Platelet Volume wa s 10% of 
the volume of an RBC or lymphocyte).

The labeling efficiency using Chromium -51 has been reported to be 10- fold lower for platelets 
compared to RBCs, 9% versus 90% (Baldini 1960), whereas Indium -111 will preferentially 
label platelets compared to RBCs or WBCs (Mountford 1985).  Even with the differences in 
labeling efficiency for Chromium -51 (which would represent half of the samples collected for 
INTERCEPT stored platelets, as the radiolabeling is randomized between Test and Control for Chromium -51 and Indium -111). Cerus data for RBC contamina tion levels suggest s that the 
contribution of the RBC levels between stored apheresis platelets processed with the BEST or Variant  1 protocols represents a scientifically insignificant difference  (<1% of Chromium -51 
labeling) . 
Furthermore , the BEST protocol includes one final sample on Day 10, 11, or 12. The last 
sample is called the “baseline” sample and is used to correct for inadvertent labeling of other 
blood components (BEST 2005). The rationale  for this sample  is that contaminating RBC s 
have a longer in vivo lifespan than platelets and that any radioactivity rema ining in the 
circulation after D ay [ADDRESS_7659] be from contaminating RBC s in the sample preparation or from 
in vivo elution for the radiolabel from platelets and labelling of other blood components .

CLI [ADDRESS_7661] benefits to the subjects in this study. 
3.3.2 Risks of Study Participation  
A summary  of the safety experience with INTERCEPT platelets is provided in the Package 
Insert  (SPC [ZIP_CODE]- AW v3.0 INTERCEPT Blood System for Platelets – Dual Storage (DS) 
Processing Set ). The cumulative experience suggests no excess treatment -related morbidity 
associated with the transfusion of INTERCEPT PCs  compared to conventional PCs . With the 
limited exposure to autologous platelets in the study proposed herein ( approximately 10 to 
30 mL  infusion), systemic risks are considered unlikely. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Risk of Receiving an Incorrectly Labeled Platelet Component  
PCs will be prepared, labeled, and tracked using site SOPs to ensure that appropriate 
identification of study components is maintained at all times. Verification of each subject’s 
platelet component will occur prior to infusion as an additional check on component identity.

of Radiolabeled Autologous INTERCEPT Apheresis Platelet Components Suspended in 100% Plasma Stored for 
up to [ADDRESS_7662] to 
disclosure without express written consent from Cerus Corporation.  [IP_ADDRESS] Risk of Transfusion -Transmitted Infectious Disease  
The risk of transfusion- transmitted infections (TTI) is considered minim al for study subjects 
who will receive approximately [ADDRESS_7663] PC s will be treated 
with the INTERCEPT system which  has demonstrated high levels of bacterial inactivation 
efficacy through 5 days  and 7 days  of storage ( Wagner , et al . 2015)  and four years safe 
experience with [ADDRESS_7664] platelets is  reduced compared with that of conventional platelet  
component s.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Risk of Transfusion Reaction  
Transfusion reactions known to occur following transfusion of conventional platelets may occur following infusion of st udy platelets (e.g., fever, chills, itching, rash, hives, 
bronchospasm, nausea/vomiting, hypertension/hypotension, TRALI, TACO, and anaphylaxis). 
The risk of experiencing a transfusion reaction is considered minimal from the small 
autologous infusions used in this study ( approximately 10- 30 mL ).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Risk of Apheresis Collection  
Risks associated with the apheresis collection  of platelets include: blood pressure changes, a 
temporary decrease in platelets, a small loss of white blood cells, problems with vein acc ess 
(including pain, bleeding, and infection at the catheter site), effects of the anticoagulant on the 
donor's calcium level (including paresthesias from citrate -induced hypocalcemia), and allergic 
reactions to the anticoagulant or other products used, which may be life -threatening .  On very 
rare occasions, risks associated with the apheresis collection include nerve damage, serious 
problems and death. Allergic reaction due to iodine allergy is possible if an iodine solution is 
used to cleanse the phleboto my site to meet standards in 21 CFR 640.4(f). Blood pressure 
changes can sometimes cause nausea, fatigue, and dizziness. Platelet loss may increase the risk of bleeding from cuts or wounds.  Venous access problems can cause bruising referred to as a 
hematoma. While donating, a supply of calcium antacid tablets is usually kept close by [CONTACT_8489]. Because the anticoagulant works by [CONTACT_8490], a donor 's levels of calcium -  and especially of active calcium ions -  decrease during the 
donation process. The lips may begin to tingle or there may be a metallic taste; since calcium

susceptible, at least during the donation process. Unusually low calcium can cause more 
serious problems such as fainting, nerve irritation and short -duration tetany. Such an acute 
hypocalcemia is usually due to low calcium levels prior to donation, aggravated by [CONTACT_8491]. Hypocalcemia can be curtailed by [CONTACT_8492]. Nerve damage which is more rarely observed may result in numbness, pain or paralysis.  Serious problems are extremely rare and may include heart attack and stroke. The apheresis procedure can also result in a need for extended medical treatment 
and can be fatal.  A pheresis donors are routinely monitored during the long donation process.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Risk Related to Whole Blood Collection  
Use of experienced phlebotomists will reduce the likelihood of these types of injuries. Blood 
collection may be associated with hematoma formation, local irritation , or infection. Local 
care can be given to prevent hematoma formation, accordi ng to standard medical practice.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Risk Related to Infusion Procedure  
The infusion procedure  may be associated with hematoma formation, local irritation , or 
infection. Local care can be given to prevent hematoma formation, according to standard medical pract ice. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Risk Related to Radiation Exposure  
111Indium  Oxine (111In) and Na 251CrO 4 (51Cr) are routinely used for radiolabeling and infusion 
of fresh or stored platelets in humans. The amount of radiation that the subjects will receive in 
each study infusion is estimated to be up to approximately [ADDRESS_7666] been reported in association with

The principle  objective of this study is to evaluate the hypothesis that INTERCEPT Platelets in 
100% plasma stored for 5 or more days (up to 7 days ) after apheresis collection retain 
sufficient viability for therapeutic transfusion efficacy. The post -infusion recovery and

up to [ADDRESS_7669] of healthy subjects who meet the FDA, AABB, and site -
specific research donor eligibility criteria for an apheresis platelet collection .   
In each stage, apheresis platelets (single or double) will be collected in 100% plasma on the 
Trima Accel® Automated Blood Collection  system .  Each study apheresis collection will be 
processed using the INTERCEPT Blood System for P latelets ; apheresis platelets containing a 
platelet dose of 3.0 to 7.9 x1011 platelets in 300 to 420 mL  of plasma will be processed using 
the INTERCEPT Dual Storage (DS) processing set. The INTERCEPT process will begin on either the day of collection (Day 0) or the day following collection (Day 1); illumination must occur within [ADDRESS_7670] platelet components will be stored for 
up to 7 days , after collection , in 100% plasma. In vitro  platelet function will be evaluated on 
Days 0/1 (pre -treatment) and at end of storage ( Day 7) for both stages  (Table 11).   
At the end of storage, duplicate  aliquot s of Test platelets will be aseptically removed from 
each subject’s INTERCEPT platelet storage container and prepared , in tandem, for 
radiolabeling using either BEST version 4.2.1 method (Stage 1) or Variant  1 modification  
(Stages 1 and 2) .  One of the Test  platelet sample aliquots will be used to assess the in vitro  
quality prior to and following the pre -radiolabeling platelet sample preparations. The i ndices to 
be measured in Stage 1 are volume, pH
22°C, CD62P, platelet count, RBC count , and WBC 
count  (Table 10).  Assessments of these indices will enable the determination of platelet 
processing recovery due to each sample preparation method and evaluation of residual  RBC 
and WBC contamination in samples prior to radiolabeling. In Stage 2 , only platelet processing

return to the site, and 43 (±2) mL  of whole blood (WB) will be drawn into a syringe containing 
9 mL  of Anticoagulant Citrate Dextrose Solution, Formula A ( ACD- A). The sample will be 
used to prepare fres h Control platelets from platelet rich plasma following the BEST 
methodology.  In addition, a blood sample in EDTA will be drawn for use in determination of radiolabel elution.  
Test and Control will be randomly radiolabeled with either 
51Cr as sodium radiochromate 
(Na 251CrO 4) or 111In as indium oxine, depending upon randomization period and assignment. 
Subjects will be randomized with equal probability to the radiolabeling sequences

5.2 Randomization and B linding  
Cerus will gener ate the randomization scheme separately for each study stage to be executed 
by [CONTACT_8493] s. In this study, eligible  subjects who are enrolled in S tage 1 will be 
randomized in 1:[ADDRESS_7685] 
platelets  (BEST/ Variant  1 or Variant  1 /BEST).  Subjects will also be randomized across 
radiolabeling sequences  (111In/51Cr or 51Cr/111In for Test /Control ) for both Stage 1 and Stage 2. 
In addition, an equal number of subjects will be targeted at each study site for both Stage 1 (6 
subjects per  site)  and Stage 2  (12 subjects with a minimum of 8 at a single site ). Subjects will 
receive both Test and Control platelets at the same time.   To reduce the potential confounding 
effect from radiolabel  for the BEST vs. Variant 1 comparison in Stage 1 , the same randomized 
radiolabeling sequence (either 51Cr or 111In for Test platelets) will be utilized throughout both 
donation periods for a given subject as applicable. Randomized subjects who do not have both paired (Test and Control) recovery and paired survival data for a given stage or who are unable to provide a second matched donation for a cross -over stage will be replaced, unless the 
enrollment goal is me t.

[IP_ADDRESS] Apheresis Platelet Collection  
Study subjects who qualify to participate in either  stage of the study will provide one single or 
double apheresis platelet collection ( Stage 2 ) or two single or double apheresis platelet 
collections ( Stage 1) as specified in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  All study apheresis donations will be 
collected in 100% plasma on the Trima Accel® automated blood collection system according 
to blood center SOPs and the manufacturer’s instructions, with leukocyte reduction by 
[CONTACT_8495], using FDA approved collection sets (Trima produc t code: [ZIP_CODE] or [ZIP_CODE]). A small sample may be 
acquired to obtain the subject’s platelet count.  
The subject’s platelet count and body mass prior to the first donation will determine if a single or double -dose collection will be performed. For S tage [ADDRESS_7688] is unable to provide a second evaluable donation (two attempts , at least two  week s apart,  to obtain a 
second donation can be made  if the  subject meets the eligibility requirements for donation ), the 
study subject will be replaced.  
After collection, the platelet components will be handled following the manufacturer’s instructions which include static rest followed by [CONTACT_8496] a t 20°C to 24°C. 
Platelets will have an RBC content <4x10
6/mL and should be free of visible  aggregates prior 
to INTERCEPT treatment . Platelet components with an RBC content >4x106/mL will be 
excluded from the study. 
At several different steps in the preparation  of the Test component , the component  volume will 
be measured by [CONTACT_8497]. The tare weight for each of the different platelet containers (empty dry 
container with standardized tube length) will be used to determine the net product weight. Tare weights will be reported.

(Na 251CrO 4), or 111In as indium oxine, following the labeling and washing procedures outlined 
in the BEST version 4.2.1 procedure  (Appendix B ) or the Variant 1 procedure ( Appendix C ), 
dependent upon Stage and where applicable, randomization. The isotope labels will be 
determined by a random number table such that equal numbers of fresh platelets  (Control)  and 
stored Test  platelets  will be labeled with each isotope.  
For both Control and Test platelets, a fter resuspension in a small volume  of ACD- A/saline , 
either 50 –100 μCi 51Cr or  50–60 μCi of 111In is added to the  platelets and incubated for 20 +2 
minutes  at room temperature to achieve radioactive labeling. The platelets are washed to 
remove excess radioactivity and then resuspended in autologous platelet -poor plasma.

Radiolabel spontaneously dissociate s (elut ion) from platelets both in vitro  and in vivo  
(Holme , et al. 1993, Snyder , et al.  2004). To correct for elution before  calculation of recovery 
and survival , the mean elution of radioisotope into the plasma after radiolabeling will be 
measured  in vitro  and modeled using an assay to estimate in vivo  elution  using the BEST 
elution assessment method  (BEST version 4.2.1 m ethod, Appendix B ). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Stored Test Platelet In Vitro Function Testing  
An aliquot (10- 20 mL ) of the stored Test  platelets will be aseptically removed from the  
subject ’s test container  on the scheduled day of infusion; pH and in vitro  platelet function 
assessments will be performed  (Table 11).   
For Test components stored in one container, remove the sample for radiolabeling before the 
unit is sampled for in vitro  platelet function testing. For platelets stored in two containers, t he 
samples  for pH assessment and for radiolabeling will be removed from “Test -A” container and

10.1 Analysis Sets  
The analysis sets will be defined as follows:  
Safety Analysis Set:  
All randomized subjects who successfully initiate an apheresis collection . 
Evaluable Analysis Set (EAS):  
All randomized and infused subjects who have both paired (Test and Control) recovery 
and paired survival data for the rel evant study stage and/or radiolabeling method, and 
otherwise complied with the protocol without any other major protocol deviation.   
Summaries for the efficacy endpoints will be presented using EAS. All other summaries will be presented using the safety a nalysis set unless stated otherwise.  
10.[ADDRESS_7779] platelet components stored for 7 days  compared  to their untreated 
“fresh” Control  platelet components.  
In addition, the study is designed to evaluate two different approaches (BEST and  Variant 1  
for Stage 1 , and Variant 1 for Stage 2 ) to radiolabeling stored INTERCEPT platelets for 
evaluation of recovery and survival. R ecovery and survival of INTERCEPT Test platelets will 
be evaluated separately  for each radiolabeling method. 
Data will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_8477], standard deviation, median, and range 
(minimum, maximum) for continuous parameters and by [CONTACT_8515]. Summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_8516]. 
Data will be compared between the two radiolabeling methods in Stage 1 .  Correlations 
between the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints may also be explored using graphs 
and/or regression analysis.

up to [ADDRESS_7780] to disclosure 
without express written consent from Cerus Corporation.  10.2.1 Efficacy An alyses  
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Endpoints  
Primary efficacy endpoints are the p ost infusion recovery and survival of Test platelets at end 
of storage  for both Stage [ADDRESS_7781] -infusion 
sampling time points at 1, 2, 3, 4 (or 5 or 6), 7 (or 8) , and 11 ± [ADDRESS_7782] fresh Control  platelets  at the end of Stage 2 :  
1. Post-infusion recovery:  
 H0: Test -  0.66×Control <0 vs. H 1: Test -  0.66×Control ≥0 
The null hypothesis of inferiority will be rejected in favor of the alternati ve hypothesis of non-
inferiority at the two -sided 0.05 significance level  if the lower bound of a two- sided 95% CI 
for the mean treatment difference (Test -  0.66×Control) is  greater than or equal to zero.   For 
any platelet recovery values  that are more tha n 100%, they will be capped at 100% for the data 
analysis.  
2. For survival : 
 H0: Test -  0.58×Control <0 vs. H 1: Test -  0.58×Control ≥0 
The null hypothesis  of inferiority will be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis of non-
inferiority at the two -sided 0.05 significance level  if the lower bound a two -sided 95% CI for 
the mean treatment difference (Test -  0.58×Control) i s greater than or equal to zero.  
The two -sided 95% CI will be constructed using the variance estimated from a paired t test . 
The above acceptance criteria will also be explored for Stage 1 separately  for each 
radiolabeling method that is evaluated  (BEST or Variant 1).   
The primary analysis population for the primary efficacy endpoints will only include subjects who have both paired  (Test and Control)  recovery and paired survival data  for the relevant  
radiolabeling method. Subjects who do not have both paired recovery and paired survival data 
may be replaced  to ensure sufficient number of subjects is reached for the primary analysis . 
Reasons for absence of primary endpoint measurement(s) for any subject will be listed in the 
study report.   
In the event that non- inferiority cannot be declared for the primary endpoints with a minimum 
of 24 evaluable subjects , additional exploratory analyses may be conducted to quantify the 
proportions of subjects whose recovery and survival  data meet the 0.66 and 0.58 cutoff,

recover from the paired fresh control).   
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Endpoints  
Data will be summarized descriptively for each stage.  The proportions of Test platelet components with platelet dose ≥ 3.0 ×10
11 (end of INTERCEPT treatment), physical platelet 
recovery ≥80% (end of INTERCEPT treatment), and pH 22°C ≥6.2 (end of storage) will be

In vitro  assessment of processed platelet samples will be summarized descriptively by 
[CONTACT_1570] (Test vs. Control), sample preparation method (BEST vs. Variant 1) , and 
radiolabeling (51Cr  vs. 111In) as applicable.  Additionally , the proportions of Test platelet 
samples prior to radiolabeling with pH 22°C ≥6.2 and physical platelet recovery ≥80%  will be 
summarized separately for the BEST and Variant  1 procedures as applicable.

10.2.3 Safety Analyses  
Treatment -emergent AEs  (defined as AEs with onset on or after the initiation of apheresis 
platelet collection ) will be su mmarized descriptively.  Other safety data (e.g., vital signs, lab 
data) will be provided in the data listings. 
10.3 Determination of Sample Size 
A sufficient number of subjects will be enrolled to provide 24 evaluable subjects with both 
paired (Test and Control) recovery and paired survival data  for Stage 2.  The sample size of 24  
for Stage 2  is chosen to provide reasonable estimate s of the primary efficacy endpoints.

new platelet preparation to fresh platelets from the same subject. The effort of adapting the 
procedure (kindly made available by [CONTACT_8530]) for this purpose and thoroughly discussing and debating its content were undertaken by [CONTACT_8531] (BEST) Collaborative through multiple meetings  over a two -
year period. The validation of the adaptation and its application can be found reviewed in other papers in this Supplement. Deviations from this procedure should be accompanied by [CONTACT_8532]. 
Many individuals contr ibuted substantial time and effort in developi[INVESTIGATOR_007], reviewing, and 
validating this procedure. In particular, the leadership of the authors of the other articles in this Supplement should be noted as well as the meticulous reviewing undertaken by [CONTACT_8533], Louise Herschel, Jill Roger, Sherrill Slichter, and Ralph Vassallo.

 Purpose: To describe a technique for radioisotopic labeling and infusion of f resh or 
stored platelets with 111 In Oxine (111Indium) and Na 251CrO 4 (51Chromium). 
 While the measurement of platelet recovery and survival can be used for a 
variety of purposes, this procedure is intended for assessment of the in vivo  
viability of platelets that have been stored and/or treated in comparison with fresh platelets from the same subject.  
 This procedure includes the basic calculations for determining platelet recovery and survival. The recommended manner of comparing the results between control and test infusions is through comparison of the paired differences and calculation of upper confidence intervals as detailed by [CONTACT_8534] (See 2.6.).

 Sampling Procedure and  Sample Preparation  
 One 5 -10 mL EDTA (lavender -top) tube sample is to be drawn by [CONTACT_8539] -infusion times:  
8.1.1 Pre-infusion (from Step 7.3). 
8.1.2 Optional: 2 hours after infusion. (Collect from the contralateral arm to that used for infusion.)  
8.1.3 One sample daily between days 1 through day 7 (except weekends for samples after  Day 1) and one final sample on day 10, 11 or 12. (The last 
sample is called the “baseline” sample and is used to correct for inadvertent labeling of other blood components.)  
NOTE: As the points at the beginning of the curve are most important in 
determining the parameters of the curve, daily sampling on Days 1, 2, 
and [ADDRESS_7823] 5 data points from samplings on Days 1- 7 should be obtained. 
Delaying the final sample from Day 10 to Day 12 results in lower counts and, potentially, counts that are inadequate to achieve desired accuracy. Obtaining the final sample on Day 10, if possible, is desirable.

 Sample Processing:  
NOTE:  Processing should be completed as soon as possible after 
sampling to prevent post -sampling elution from skewing the proportion 
of activity found in the cellular fraction. 
8.2.1 Prior to the infusion, label and weigh capped 12 x 75 mm polystyrene 
tubes:  one for each sampling tim e (including pre -sample) for whole 
blood, packed cells and plasma. Tubes for daily samples may be labeled and weighed on the day of use or beforehand.  
8.2.[ADDRESS_7825] the weight.  Take care that the sample does not touch the cap.  
8.2.5 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_8464] 2.0 mL of blood into the appropriate tube labeled for packed cells.  
8.2.6 Centrifuge this second set of tubes at 2000 x g for 15 minutes at room temperature.  
8.2.7 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_8465] e 
labeled for plasma.  
8.2.8 Count the "splits" (packed cell and plasma tubes, including the injectate). (When possible, count the “splits” on the day of sampling.)  
NOTE: The size of sample volumes may be increased if desired.  
 Elution of Radioactivity from Labele d Platelets in Whole Blood  
 Add [ADDRESS_7826] as soon as possible after the infusion of the labeled cells procedure. (See Section 4.1.2 or 5.1.2.) . 
Note: This timing is anticipating infusion of the radiolabeled platelets at the 
earliest  possible time. If delay in infusion is anticipated, the elution steps 
described in this section should be begun so that the separation of the supernatant after the next step occurs approxi mately coincidently with the 
infusion. 
 Mix and incubate the tube for two hours at 37ºC in a wet incubator (water bath) 
or a dry incubator in a cylinder of water.  
 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_8464] 2 mL into a 12 x 75 mm capped tube.

without express written consent from Cerus Corporation.  
 Spin at 2000g for 15 minutes. 
 Transfer the supernatant plasma to a capped 12 x 75 mm capped tube.  
 Count the splits.  
 The activity found in the cells and plasma will be used to evaluate the in vivo 
cell-bound activity of the labeled platelets for each of the two radiolabels. 
Elution = (CPM super nate)/[( CPM cells) + (CPM supernate )] 
 Counting  the Samples   
 Ensure required quality control and preventive maintenance procedures are performed according to the operating instructions. Load racks into counter and start counting. Count whole blood samples once all samples from the subject have been collected and processed (including Day 10, 11 or 12 sample). (One can also count standards and splits, daily.)  
 Load the gamma counter in a standard order, such as:  blank/background, standards, elutions, pre -infusi on, and post -infusion timed specimens in order 
collected.   
 Select appropriate counting program. Set count time to achieve a 2% accuracy, including background.  
 When the tubes have finished counting, label the instrument printout. Verify that the background has not drifted significantly.  Verify that all samples counted for expected times.  Place the gamma counter printouts in the appropriate file.  
 Transfer all data to appropriate spreadsheets for calculations. Verify accurate transcription. 
 Calculations  
 Determine corrected CPM /g for each sample.  
Most gamma counters correct automatically for background activity and decay 
during counting as well as for “cross -up” and “cross -down”, that is, counting of 
one isotope’s activity in the other’s channels. Samples and standards must all be corrected for these parameters as well as corrected to the same time for 
calculations to be valid. Using these corrected CPM values reported by [CONTACT_8540] (CPM
corrected ), determine CPM/g for standards and timed subject 
sample s as follows:  
11.1.1 Standards: STD = CPM corrected  * dilution factor/mass counted, where 
dilution factor = mass of standard/mass of injectate added

without express written consent from Cerus Corporation.  NOTE: Since the diluent for the standard is water, the specific gravity of 
the standard may be assumed to be 1.00, and the final volume of the standard in mL may be taken as its mass in g. 
11.1.2 Timed sample activity: SAMPLE = CPM
corrected  /mass counted  
 Determine cell -bound proportion for timed count adjustment  
Using timed split samples (Section 8.2.8), determine the proportion of the activity in each timed sample that can be associated with the cellular fraction:   
Cell Bound Fraction (CBF
Time t) = (Activity of cells)/(Activity of 
cells + Activity of plasma) = (CPM cell bound )/[( CPM cell bound ) + 
(CPM plasma )] 
 Standard a djustment for injectate elution:  
11.3.1 Determine the mean CPM of the three mixed standards  
(Steps 6.1 and 11.1.1).  
11.3.[ADDRESS_7829] samples by [CONTACT_8541] (Step 9.7).  
STD corrected  = STD * (1 -Elution)  
 Adjustment for cell -bound proportion and baseline  
The following two adjustments should be made to the timed sample 
CPM/g counts. These adjustments result in “fully adjusted counts” used 
for curve fitting.  
11.4.1 Adjustment of timed sample for cell- bound proportion (Steps 11.1.2, 
11.2):  
SAMPLE Time t  = SAMPLE (CPM/g) x (CBF Time t ) 
Adjust for non- platelet residual activity baseline, according to the day 
on which the “baseline” sample was taken. (This results in fully 
adjusted timed sample counts.) .

Fully adjusted count = SAMPLE Time t  –  [SAMPLE Day 12  x  (1.24- 0.24

Note: “Time t” is the elapsed time in hours from the time of infusion 
(Step 7.4) to the time of sampling. “Time of Day 10 sample” is the 
elapsed time in hours from time of infusion (Step 7.4) to the time the 
sample was obtained on Day 10 following infusion. 
These calculations are based on the published experience of reference 
2.3 and the expectation that 51Cr persistence is the primary source of 
persistent activity. Persistent activity attrib utable to 111In is less of a 
concern because of its shorter half -life, its higher elution from any 
contaminating red cells that were labeled and the lack of oxine to 
facilitate labeling after elution from platelets.  
 Determination of expected time 0 count following infusion

 Kinetic curve fitting  
The fully adjusted timed -sample counts (Step 11.4.2) for times greater than 20 
hours are used for kinetic curve fitting and estimation of recovery and survival. 
That is, the 2 hour time sample is not used for kinetic curve fitting. These 
parameters may be estimated using a validated non -linear curve fitting routine 
found in various statistical and pharmacokinetic computer program packages. 
The use of COS T software, one of these software packages, is described below. 
Optionally, the recovery of timed- samples calculated in Step 11.6 may be used. 
Recovery is determined as the extrapolated y -axis intercept (t=0) of the survival 
curve, expressed as the blood cell -bound activity in proportion to the expected 
activity as projected from the blood volume -based dilution.  
The fully adjusted count data (CP M/g) for each timed sample point are entered 
into the COST program as y values, the time after infusion (in hours) as x 
values, and the expected time 0 count. (Optionally, the recovery of each timed 
sample from 11.6 may be entered as y values.)

 Purpose : To describe a technique for radioisotopic labeling and infusion of fresh 
or stored platelets with 111 In Oxine (111Indium) and Na 251CrO 4 (51Chromium).  
 While the measurement of platelet recovery and survival can be used for a 
variety of purposes, this procedure is intended for assessment of the in vivo viability of platelets that have been stored and/or treated in comparison with fresh platelets from the same subject  
 This procedure includes the basic calculations for determining platelet recovery and survi val. The recommended manner of comparing the results between 
control and test infusions is through comparison of the paired differences and calculation of upper confidence intervals as detailed by [CONTACT_8534] (See 2.6.)

 Sampling Procedure and Sample Preparation  
 One 5 -10 mL EDTA (lavender -top) tube sample is to be drawn by [CONTACT_8539] -infusion times:  
8.1.1 Pre-infusion (from Step 7.3)  
8.1.2 Optional: 2 hours after infusion. (Collect from the contralateral arm to 
that used for infusion.)  
8.1.3 One sample daily between days 1 through day 7 (except weekends for samples after  Day 1) and one final sample on day 10, 11 or 12. (The last 
sample is called the “baseline” sample and is used to correct for inadvertent labeling of other blood components.)  
NOTE: As the points at the beginning of the curve are most important in 
determining the parameters of the curve, daily sampling on Days 1, 2, 
and [ADDRESS_7866] 5 data points from samplings on Days 1- 7 should be obtained 
Delaying the final sample from Day 10 to Day 12 results in lower 
counts and, potentially, counts that are inadequate to achieve d esired 
accuracy. Obtaining the final sample on Day 10, if possible, is desirable. 
 Sample Processing:  
NOTE:  Processing should be completed as soon as possible after sampling to prevent post -sampling elution from skewing the proportion 
of activity found in the cellular fraction.  
8.2.1 Prior to the infusion, label and weigh capped 12 x 75 mm polystyrene tubes:  one for each sampling time (including pre -sample) for whole

NOTE: The size of sample volumes may be increased if desired  
 Elution of Radioactivity from Labeled Platelets in Whole Blood  
 Add [ADDRESS_7868] as soon as poss ible after the infusion of the labeled 
cells procedure. (See Section 4.1.2 or 5.1.2.)  
Note: This timing is anticipating infusion of the radiolabeled platelets at the 
earliest possible time. If delay in infusion is anticipated, the elution steps described i n this section should be begun so that the separation of the 
supernatant after the next step occurs approximately coincidently with the 
infusion

 Counting the Samples  
 Ensure required quality control and preventive maintenance procedures are 
performed according to the operating instructions. Load racks into counter and start counting. Count whole blood samples once all samples from the subject have been collected and processed (including Day 10, 11 or 12 sample). (One can also count standards and splits, daily.)  
 Load the gamma counter in a standard order, such as:  blank/background, 
standards, elutions, pre -infusion, and post -infusion timed specimens in order 
collected  
 Select appropriate counting program. Set count time to achieve a 2% accuracy, including background.  
 When the tubes have finished counting, label the instrument printout. Verify that the background has not drifted significantly.  Verify that all samples counted for expected times.  Place the gamma counter printouts in the appropriate file  
 Transfer all d ata to appropriate spreadsheets for calculations. Verify accurate 
transcription  
 Calculations  
 Determine corrected CPM /g for each sample  
Most gamma counters correct automatically for background activity and decay 
during counting as well as for “cross -up” an d “cross -down”, that is, counting of 
one isotope’s activity in the other’s channels. Samples and standards must all be corrected for these parameters as well as corrected to the same time for 
calculations to be valid. Using these corrected CPM values repor ted by [CONTACT_8540] (CPM
corrected ), determine CPM/g for standards and timed subject 
samples as follows:  
11.1.1 Standards: STD = CPM corrected  * dilution factor/mass counted, where 
dilution factor = mass of standard/mass of injectate added  
NOTE: Since the diluent for the standard is water, the specific gravity of 
the standard may be assumed to be 1.00, and the final volume of the standard in mL may be taken as its mass in g. 
Dilution of standards must be calibrated to ensure that measurements at 
baseline are > 10 fold higher than background

 Determine cell -bound proportion for timed count adjustment  
Using timed split samples (Section 8.2.8), determine the proportion of the 
activity in each timed sample that can be associated with the cellular fraction: 
Cell Bound Fraction (CBF Time t) = (Activity of cells)/(Activity of cells + 
Activity of p lasma) = (CPM cell bound )/[(CPM cell bound ) + (CPM plasma )]

 Adjustment for cell- bound proportion and baseline  
The following two adjustments should be made to the timed sample CPM/g 
counts. These adjustments result in “fully adjusted counts” used for curve fitting

These calculations are based on the published experience of reference 
2.3 and the expectation that 51Cr persistence is the primary source of 
persisten t activity. Persistent activity attributable to 111In is less of a 
concern because of its shorter half -life, its higher elution from any 
contaminating red cells that were labeled and the lack of oxine to 
facilitate labeling after elution from platelets  
 Determination of expected time 0 count following infusion

11.5.2 Convert the blood volume calculated in 11.5.1 to blood mass by 
[CONTACT_8542]. The specific gravity may be taken as 1.05 g/mL, or, if the subject’s hematocrit is known, it may be estimated as (1541 + Hct)/1500 (Subject hematocrit is expressed as a percentage rather than a decimal; expected 
SG usually between 1.053 and 1.060 g/mL.).

 Determine recovery  for each timed sample (optional)  
Take each fully adjusted sample count (11.4.2) and divide by [CONTACT_8551] 0 count (11.5.3) to calculate the recovery at each sampling time:

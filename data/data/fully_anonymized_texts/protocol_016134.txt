NUMBER OF SITES  Approximately 40 
RATIONALE  Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) commonly acquire a chronic airway infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa  (Pa).  Both inhaled 
tobramycin and oral azithromycin have been proven beneficial in 
these patients and are currently used by [CONTACT_428842].  75% of US patients prescribed inhaled tobramycin are also 
prescribed chronic oral azithromycin. We believe that azithromycin 
may be  inhibiting the anti -Pa effects and clinical benefits of inhaled 
tobramycin in clinically infected patients .  This study is designed to 
compare monotherapy with inhaled tobramycin versus  combination 
therapy adding chronic oral azithromycin to inhaled tobramycin.  
STUDY DESIGN This is a prospe ctive, randomized, placebo -controlled , double -blinded  
study of azithromycin in subjects with chronic Pa airway infection 
using inhaled tobramycin.  Subjects who have received two ( 2) or 
more cycles of inhaled tobramycin within the 24 weeks prior to 
enrollm ent will be recruited into the study.   This study will 
investigate whether azithromycin is associated with poorer clinical and microbiologic outcomes as compared to placebo during 
concurrent administration of inhaled tobramycin.   
Eligible s ubjects will b e enrolled and randomized to either 
azithromycin or placebo at Visit 1 , approximately 14 days prior to the 
start day of  their next planned 28-day nebulized solution or dry 
powder tobramycin (TISP) cycle.   Both tobramycin inhalation 
solution (TIS) and tobr amycin inhalation powder (TIP) will be 
allowed, based on clinical prescription.  Tobramycin solution should 
be nebulized with a n approved nebulizer and air compressor . 
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to azithromycin (500 mg 
three times per week ) or matched placebo.  Randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_10266] 1 % predicted (25% -50%, >50% -75%, >75%), 
chronic oral azithromycin use for the past 30 days , inhaled tobramycin 
formulation (TIS, TIP), and site . Between Visit 1 (Day -14) and Visit

 2 (Day 0), a two -week run -in period will be used to begin 
administration of either azithromycin or placebo.  Among those 
randomized to azithromycin, the 2-week run-in period will be used to 
initiate azithromycin and standardize uptake prior to the start of the 
next T ISP cycle.  Among those randomized to placebo, the run-in 
period will be used as a standardized washout prior to the start of the next TISP cycle.  Subjects will begin TISP at Visit 2 in addition to 
their continued dosing of randomized study drug treatment  
(azithromycin or placebo). Subjects will continue both TISP and study 
drug dosing for 28 days (up until Visit 3 ), which corresponds with the 
end of a clinically prescribed [ADDRESS_542558] PARTICIPATION 
AND DURATION OF 
STUDY  Subjects will be enrolled in the randomized study for up to 42 days (6 
weeks ). 
• Treatment  V1-V2: azithromycin or placebo without TISP:  14 days 
(-2 days/+4 days)  followed by:  
• Treatment  V2-V3: azithromycin or placebo with TISP : 28 days ( -2 
days/+4 days)  
Subjects  participating in the optional open-label extension will be on 
study for up to 98 days (14 weeks ). 
• Treatment V3 -V4: azithromycin without  TISP:  28 days ( -/+4 
days)  followed by:  
• Treatment V4 -V5: azithromycin with TISP  28 days ( -/+4 days)  
The total duration of the study is expected to be approximately 33.5 
months: [ADDRESS_542559] enrolled to complete the study.

Protocol Template:  © CFFT TDN   Effective: [ADDRESS_542560] ives for the randomized period are to:  
• Compare changes in patient -reported quality of life between 
subjects randomized to azithromycin versus placebo  
The secondary exploratory objectives for the randomized period are 
to: 
• Compare the safety profile between  subjects randomized to 
azithromycin versus placebo  
• Compare changes in additional spi[INVESTIGATOR_258229], bacterial 
density, and weight between subjects randomized to azithromycin 
versus placebo  
• Compare rates of pulmonary exacerbations, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and acute antibiotic usage between subjects randomized to 
azithromycin versus placebo  
 
The objectives for those continuing in the open-label extension:  
• Among those randomized to azithromycin and remaining on 
azithromycin, obtain additional data to determine  the long term 
effect of azithromycin on clinical outcomes   
• Among those randomized to placebo and switching to 
azithromycin, compare differences in clinical outcomes observed 
during the randomized and open -label period s

TREATMENT: TISP  In this study, TISP is given as standard of care , will be based on 
clinical prescription for 28 days on,  followed by 28 days off , and will 
conform to manufacturer administration guidel ines.   
CONCOMMITANT MEDICATIONS  Allowed:  For both the randomized and open-label periods,  standard 
therapy for CF is allowed except for treatments noted in the 
conditionally allowed and prohibited medications section s below.  
Ongoing chronic treatment (>30 days prior to Visit 1) with inhaled 
dornase alpha, hypertonic saline, short and long acting 
bronchodilators, FDA -approved CFTR modulators, high dose 
ibuprofen, low -dose inhaled or systemic steroids  and airway clearance 
is allowed.   
Conditionally Allowed : Acute treatment with drugs categorized as 
known to prolong QT interval  is allowed  according to the following:  
• For drugs commonly used to treat CF patients (e.g.  
ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, fluconazole, propofol, 
sevoflurane, ondansetron),  study drug (azithromycin or placebo) 
or open-label azithromycin does not  need to be stopped.   
• For all other drugs categorized as known to prolong QT interval , 
acute use is allowed but study drug (azithromycin or placebo) or 
open-label azithromycin must be temporarily stopped during use 
of these medications .  After acute treatment is completed, 
subjects  should re start study drug or open-label azithromycin on 
the next scheduled treatment day.  
• Chronic  treatment (>30 days prior to Visit 1) with antidepressant 
medications citalopram and escitalopram is allowed without affecting study participation  if:  
o The subject has been using both chronic oral azithromycin 
AND citalopram (or escitalopram) consistently for greater 
than 30 days at Visit 1   
AND 
o The Visit 1  ECG  demonstrates QTc  within the normal limits 
as defined by [CONTACT_428848]:

 STATISTICS  
Primary Analysis Plan  All analyses will be performed using a  modified  intent -to-treat ( m-
ITT) population, which is defined as all randomized subje cts who 
received  at least one dose of study drug.  All tests will be two -sided 
and evaluated at a 0.05 level of significance.  
 
The primary endpoint will be the difference between the azithromycin 
and placebo treatment groups in the relative change from Visit 1 to 
Visit 3 in FEV 1 (liters).  The primary endpoint will be compared 
between treatment groups using linear regression adjusted for 
randomization strata . Least squares means and the treatment effect for 
the relative  change will be presented as well as corresponding 95% 
confidence interval and p-values. The p-values will be evaluated 
against a two -sided 0.05 level of significance.  
Rationale for Number 
of Subjects  The primary endpoint is the difference bet ween the azithromycin and 
placebo treatment groups in the relative change from Visit 1  to Visit 3 
in FEV 1 (liters).  Data from prior published studies of similar duration 
are available to estimate sample size and power for the study 
including a randomized,  placebo -controlled trial of azithromycin in 
individuals with CF chronically infected with Pa and a randomized, 
placebo controlled trial of aztreonam lysine similarly among those 
with chronic Pa.  These studies suggest a standard deviation of the 
relative change in FEV 1 ranging from 10 to  16.  Based on these prior 
studies, we anticipate the relative change in FEV 1 from Visit 1 to Visit 
3 to be -2% in the azithromycin arm and +6.85%  in the placebo arm 
for an overall treatment effect of 8.65%.    A sample size of 110 
provides 85% power to detect a treatment effect of 7.5% or greater 
assuming a standard deviation of 13.  110 subjects provide s 93% 
power to dete ct a treatment effect similar to what was observed in the 
preliminary data (8.65%)  assuming a standard deviation of 13.   It is 
noteworthy that the standard deviation from more recently completed 
studies CF studies have observed standard deviations in short  term 
relative change in FEV (liters) ranging from 8-11, confirming our 
conservatism in the standard deviation estimate used for our sample 
size calculations.   Assuming a standard deviation of 11, a sample size 
of 110 provides 85% power to detect a treatm ent effect of 6.3% or 
greater in favor of the placebo group.    
It is anticipated from prior CF trials conducted through the TDNCC 
that the attrition rate will be less than 10%, and thus a sample size of 
[ADDRESS_542567] 110 subjects will complete t he trial.

1 BACKGROUND 
Projected median survival of those with cystic fibrosis (CF) has dramatically improved in recent 
decades, largely as a result of new medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is 
the most common pathogen in the airways of people with CF. By [CONTACT_428849], half of all 
patients with CF are chronically infected with Pa1.  This prevalence increases to 70% or more  by 
[CONTACT_428850], and persistent P a airway inf ection is linked to more rapid loss of lung function 
and earlier mortality2,3.  Inhaled antibiotics achieve high airway concentrations while avoiding 
many safety concerns associated with prolonged systemic drug exposure4,5. Strategies to 
eradicate initial Pa airway infection or treat chronic infection have proven beneficial6-9.  
The aminoglycoside tobramycin was the first inhaled ant i-pseudomonal antibiotic commercially 
developed for CF and remains the most prescribed inhaled antibiotic used in the US1.  Roughly 
two thirds of all US patients with CF and chronic Pa are prescrib ed inhaled tobramycin—
typi[INVESTIGATOR_178106] [ADDRESS_542568] common chronic antibiotic used 
in CF patients with persistent Pa1.  In queries of recent clinical trials and the US CF Foundation 
National Patient Registry, we find that ~70% of all patients with P a and 75% of those prescribed 
inhaled tobramycin are now also prescribed oral  azithromycin on a chronic basis.  
Potential interactions between concomitant medications and mechanisms for antibiotic resistance 
in CF are poorly understood.  These issues have been cited in current CF consensus treatment 
guidelines as two key unanswered questions in need of further study16. Based on recent pre -
clinical research demonstrating antagonism between azithromycin and tobramycin, but not the 
fluoroquin olone, ciprofloxacin17, we  hypothesized that azithromycin may selectively inhibit 
tobramycin when targeting Pa airway infection in CF lung disease.  We have now observed a 
selective, antagonistic drug interaction between azithromycin and tobramycin in two in vitro 
models of biofilm  growth with Pa, two animal models of biofilm -based Pa infection, and two 
non-overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_428816].  
In-vitro  Data 
Initial s tudies were conducted with the laboratory strain of Pa PA0118. Using a flow cell biofilm 
culture method, we observe significant antibiotic effects, manifested as reduced biofilm biomass, 
with antibiot ics individually (Fig ure 1a). However, when azithromycin was added, we observed 
neutral to increased effect with ciprofloxacin (Fig ure 1b) but antagonist ic effects with 
tobramycin (Figure  1c).

Additional studies in the flow -cell biofilm model were conducted using 15 CF clinical isolates of 
Pa
19. Twelve of the isolates grew sufficient biofilms to be tested in the antibiotic comparison 
studies. Of those 12,  six showed antagonism when azithr omycin was added to tobramycin. We 
then tested aztreonam in those six isolates and observed neutral effects in three isolates  and 
additive effects in three  isolates (Fig ure 2). The flow -cell system is devoid of any mammalian 
tissue. These data suggest that  the suspected drug interaction occurs directly between the 
antibiotics in the context of bacterial infection rather than indirectly through altered host 
response.

In the biofilm aggregate model, we observe highly significant reduction in bacterial killing when 
azithromycin is added to tobramycin, with 2-3 log anta gonism (100-1000 fold; Fig ure 3a). To 
date, we do not observe antagonism with other antibiotics commonly used for inhalation therapy 
in CF (Fig ure 3b; effect of azithromycin when added to anti -Pa antibiotics ).

In-vivo  Animal M odel Data 
As part of a research project sponsored by [CONTACT_941] U .S. Department of Defense, we tested the ability 
of early azithromycin treatment, with or without subsequent additional antibiotics, to reduce Pa 
infection in cutaneous thermal injur y (i.e. , burn wound)17.   Pa grows as a biofilm in the presence 
of exuberant neutrophilic inflammation in both burn wound infections and CF lung disease21-23. 
Tobramycin alone effective ly reduced Pa infection at the wound site and systemic spread to the 
lung (Figure  4a). As predicted, azithromycin had additive antibacterial effects when combined 
with subsequent ciprofloxacin treatment.  However, counter to our hypothesis, we found that t he 
burden of P a infection both at the wound site and systemically (lung) greatly increased when 
azithromycin treatment was followed by [CONTACT_428851] (Figure  4b). Infection with combined 
azithromycin and tobramycin was no better than normal saline -treated cont rol.

 AIR-CF2 Clinical Tr ial 
During the 4-week run-in period with inhaled tobramycin, subjects with concomitant 
azithromycin use had lesser improvement in FEV 1 (Figures 6a and 6b). Immediately after 
inhaled tobramycin use, subjects received inhaled aztreonam lysine. Users of azit hromycin had 
significantly greater improvement in FEV 1 with the non-aminoglycoside, aztreonam, than during 
the run-in period with tobramycin. Subjects without azithromycin use had approximately 4% 
relative increase in FEV 1 (liters) during both the tobramyc in and subsequent aztreonam lysine 
periods of this study. Self -reported quality of life, again based on the change in CFQR -RSS, was 
also similarly impacted by [CONTACT_428852] (Figure  6c).

[ADDRESS_542571], then current practice 
recommendations for tens of thousands of patients with CF worldwide may be altered.  Based on 
the CF registry data, we estimate there are >10,000 patients in the US currently pre scribed 
azithromycin and inhaled tobramycin.  Over a lifetime, over 50% of patients will meet the 
clinical criteria to be prescribed these two medications as chronic therapy.  Additional concerns 
extend to the use of intravenous (IV) tobramycin, which is s elected twice as often as any other 
anti-pseudomonal drug for CF pulmonary exacerbations25. Impact of azithromycin on IV 
aminoglycosides is beyond the scope of this proj ect but demonstrate broader implications for our 
research.  There are sizable financial impacts related to the cost of these medications and outcomes related to decline in lung function (e.g. , pulmonary exacerbations, quality of life, and 
survival).  
Taken  together, the data summarized above provide strong evidence that a drug-drug interaction 
may be present in current CF care recommendations.  However, there is obvious risk for confounding by [CONTACT_428853].  
Reported baseline characteristics are similar between users and non -users of azithromycin in 
these data, but multiple recognized and unrecognized variables that may contribute to pulmonary 
decline are not accounted for.  Therefore, a prospe ctive study to both control for such 
confounders and intentionally monitor drug use is needed.  
Our primary and secondary outcomes focus on relative change in FEV
1 (liters ) and self -reported, 
disease related quality of life. Additional information, such as comparison with alternative 
inhaled antibiotics or the effect on pulmonary exacerbations, is viewed as important but would

an adverse drug interaction between a zithromycin and inhaled tobramycin. It may be that both 
agents, when used without the other, are beneficial but that the combination is disadvantageous. 
If our theory is proven through this study,  then these data can be used to justify and design 
additiona l research to address other important and related questions.  
2.1 Risk / Benefit Assessment  
No experimental or new medications are being introduced to subjects during this study.  
Removal of chronic azithromycin may decrease lung function or increase the rate of pulmonary 
exacerbation, based on prior studies of azithromycin in similar patients10,26.  Our preliminar y 
data does  not support this concern and suggest that removing azithromycin may be protective in 
the majority of subjects also using inhaled tobramycin.  This includes better clinical outcomes in 
lung function (FEV 1), patient reported quality of life, and time to need additional antibiotics19.  
However, a withdrawal study of either medication has never been reported and our preliminary 
data on lung function may not fully predict the risk of pulmonary exacerbation.  Subjects 
experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation will be treated  but will not  be removed from the study.  
Identifying an undesirable drug-drug interaction pertinent to over 50% of US patients with CF 
has clear and important safety and efficacy implications.  Given that both of these medications 
benefit from str ong support in US consensus guidelines, answering this question is a high 
priority.  
Recent reports raise concern about potential proarrhythmic cardiotoxicity with oral azithromycin 
treatment in non-CF populations27.  Patients with CF account for a significant portion of chronic 
azithromycin use in the US and cardiac arrhythmias have not been linked to this therapy.  
Similarly, the relative risk of cardiovascular death  attributable to azithromycin was reported as 
<1 per 100,000 antibiotic courses in low risk patients27.  There are approximately 30,000 CF 
patients in the entire US,  and a repeat study found no increased risk in younger, lower risk adult 
populations28. However, this study provides an opportunity to analyze electrocardiogram s 
(ECGs ), focusing on any effect on QT c interval, in a group of CF subjects both on and off of 
azithromycin.   
3 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
3.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to determine if azithromycin impairs the previously-
recognized clinical benefits of inhaled tobramycin by [CONTACT_428854] 1 between subjects randomized to azithromycin versus placebo.  
3.2 Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives for the randomized period are to:  
o Compare changes in patient -reported quality of life between subjec ts randomized to 
azithromycin versus placebo  
The secondary exploratory objectives for the randomized period are to:  
o Compare the safety profile between subjects randomized to azithromycin versus placebo.

 o Compare changes in additional spi[INVESTIGATOR_258229], bacterial density, and weight 
between subjects randomized to azithromycin versus placebo  
o Compare rates of pulmonary exacerbations, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and acute antibiotic usage 
between subjects randomized to azithromycin versus placebo  
The objectives for those continuing in the open-label extension:  
o Among those randomized to azithromycin and remaining on azithromycin, obtain 
additional data to determine the long term effect of azithromycin on clinical outcomes   
o Among those randomized to placebo and switching to azithromycin, compare differences in clinical outcomes observed during the randomized and open-label periods

two ( 2) or more cycles of inhaled tobramycin within the 24 weeks prior to enrollment will be 
recruited into the study.  This study will investigate whether azithromycin is assoc iated with 
poorer clinical and microbiologic outcomes as compared to placebo during concurrent 
administration of inhaled tobramycin.   
Approximately 120 eligible subjects will be enrolled and randomized to either azithromycin or 
placebo at Visit 1 , approxi mately 14 days prior to the start day of  their next planned 28-day 
nebulized solution or dry powder tobramycin (TISP) cycle.  Both tobramycin inhalation solution 
(TIS) and tobramycin inhalation powder (TIP) will be allowed, based on clinical prescription.  
Tobramycin solution should be nebulized with a n approved nebulizer and air compressor . 
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to azithromycin (500 mg three times per week ) or 
matched placebo.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_10266]
1 % predicted (25% -50%, >50% -75%, 
>75%) , chronic oral azithromycin use for the past 30 days , inhaled tobramycin formulation (TIS 
or TIP), and site.  Between Visit 1 (Day -14) and Visit 2 (Day 0), a two-week run-in period will 
be used to begin administration of either azithromycin or placebo.   Among those randomized to 
azithromycin, the 2-week run-in period will be used to initiate azithromycin and standardize 
uptake prior to the start of the next TISP  cycle.  Among those randomized to placebo, the run-in 
period will be use d as a standardized washout prior to the start of the next TISP cycle.  Subjects 
will begin TISP at Visit 2 in addition to their continued dosing of randomized study drug 
treatment ( azithromycin or placebo). Subjects will continue both TISP and study drug dosing for 
28 days (up until Visit 3 ), which corresponds with the end of a clinically prescribed [ADDRESS_542574]  4-week period, 
followed by a 4-week period of TISP .  
The total duration of the study is expected to be approximately 33.5 m onths: [ADDRESS_542575] enrolled to complete the study (Figure

ibuprofen, low -dose inhaled or systemic steroids  and airway clearance is allowed.   
7.2 Conditionally Allowed Medications and Treatments  
Acute treatment with drugs categorized as known to prolong QT interval  is allowed  according to 
the following:  
• For drugs commonly used to treat CF patients (e.g.  ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, 
moxifloxacin, fluconazole, propofol, sevoflurane, ondansetron), study drug (azithromycin 
or placebo) or open-label azithromycin does not  need to be stopped.   
• For all other drugs categorized as known to prolong QT interval , acute use is allowed but 
study drug (azithromycin or placebo) or open-label azithromycin must be temporarily 
stopped during use of these medications.  After acute treatment is completed, subjects 
should re -start study drug or open-label azithromycin on the next scheduled treatment day.  
• Ongoing chronic treatment (>30 days prior to Visit 1) with antidepressant medications 
citalopram and escitalopram is allowed without  affect ing study participation if: 
o The subject has been using both chronic oral azithromycin AND citalopram (or 
escitalopram) consistently for greater than 30 days at Visit 1   
AND 
o The Visit 1  ECG demonstrates QTc  within the normal limits as defined by [CONTACT_428848]: “ Substantial evidence supports the 
conclusion that these drugs prolong the QT interval AND are clearly associated with a risk of torsades de pointes (TdP), even when taken as  directed in offici al labeling”, and listed on the 
CredibleMeds
® Websit e (Composite List of All QT Drugs  under the category “Known Risk of 
TdP” ). 
Acute use of macrolide antibiotics may be req uired for certain infections and is allowed but also 
requires temporarily stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_428822]-label azithromycin . The study drug or 
open-label azithromycin should be restarted on the next scheduled day following completion of 
the prescribed macrolide antibiotic.  
Treatment for pulmonary exacerbations as required for acute care is allowed except for treatments noted in the prohibited medications section below.  Physicians are encouraged to 
prescribe acute antibiotic therapy and initiate or increas e the dose of acute systemic 
corticosteroids (defined as less than 10 days) only in the presence of increased symptoms  
suggesting a pulmonary exacerbation.

the investigative site will use the  Medidata® Rave and Balance™ systems to randomize each 
subject .  An adaptive randomization (dynamic allocation based on minimization31) will be 
employed. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to azithromycin (500 mg three times 
per week ) or matched placebo. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_10266] 1 % predicted (25% -50%, 
>50% -75%, >75%), chronic oral azithromycin use for the past 30 days , inhaled tobramycin 
formulation (TIS or TIP), and site . The dynamic allocation algorithm seeks to optimize 
randomization balance by [CONTACT_270140] a weighted average of the marginal imbalance32 of  
treatment allocation for each factor and for the study overall.  A random element is added to the 
otherwise determin istic minimizat ion algorithm  to reduce allocation predictability by [CONTACT_2329] a 
biased coin33 to include a chance of allocation to a treatment arm other than the arm that 
optimizes balance .  After data collection  at Visit [ADDRESS_542583]  will then be assigned to a treatment group.

 8.2 Blinding  
Study treatment (azithromy cin or placebo) will be  assigned in a doubl e-blinded fashion.  
Subjects and site research staff will not know the treatment assigned, with the exception of the 
dispensing site pharmacist  or designee  and designated TDNCC personnel.    
The following study procedures will be in place to ensure double -blind administration of study 
treatments:   
 Randomization assignments will be stored in a secure database and appropriately 
protected and backed up   
 Access to the randomization code will be strictly controlled and limited to designated 
TDNCC study personnel  
 Test and control treatments will be manufactured to be identical in appearance and  taste-matched  
 Packaging and labeling of test and control treatments will be identical  
The study blind will be broken upon com pletion of the clinical study and after the study database 
has been locked and study results released. The site investigators will be provided with each 
subject’s treatment assignment following completion of data analysis.

access. If the temperature of study drug storage in the clinic/pharmacy exceeds or falls below this 
range, this should be reported to the Sponsor or designee.  
Subjec ts will be instructed to store study drug ( azithromycin or placebo and open-label 
azithromycin) in original packaging at room temperature.   
8.[ADDRESS_542588] has moderate to severe toxicity (refer to Study Manual) , the following schedule 
for dosage adjustment can be made at the discretion of the site investigator:  
• If a study subject receiving study drug three times weekly  (TIW) experiences drug-
related toxicity, the dosing INTERVAL of the study drug will be extended to two times 
weekly ( BIW ; e.g., Monday and Thursday)  
• If a study subject does not tolerate  receiving study drug BIW, the subject should be 
permanently discontinued from study drug due to intolerance.  
Dose can return to TIW at the discretion of the  site investigator.  
8.6.2 Due to Treatment with Antibiotics  – Temporary Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Study drug should be temporarily discontinued for subjects prescribed macrolide antibiotics . 
Study drug may be temporarily discontinued at the discretion of the treating clinician during 
acute treatment with other medications (e.g. , additional antibiotics or drugs believed to increase 
QT prolongation).  
Regardless of study drug use, subjects should be encouraged to complete all study visits . 
8.6.3 Missed Doses  
Missed doses may be made up as long as they are not taken within 24 hours of the  next 
scheduled dose.  
8.7 Study Drug Accountability  
Study drug (azithromycin or placebo  and open-label azithromycin ) dispensed to subjects will be 
counted as noted in the Schedule of Events .  Study drug distribution will be recorded, including 
study drug identifier  (randomized period) , date, quantity, and subject ID.  
8.[ADDRESS_542589] daily diaries recording study drug and TISP  use will be reviewed and the number of 
doses taken will be recorded throughout the study.   Subjects will be asked to bring study drug 
bottles and the diary to each study visit and the number of study drug capsules  remaining will be 
compared with the number ideally taken.  Subjects will be questioned at each visit about missed 
or extra doses of study drug, open-label azithrom ycin, and/ or TISP.  Treatment compliance for

Subjects will not be allowed to change from inhaled tobramycin solution to inhaled tobramycin 
powder (i.e. , TOBI® Podhaler) or vice versa while enrolled in the study.  Either tobramycin 
delivery mechanism will be allowed but subjects must be stable on one delivery mechanism, 
either solution or dry powder, for one or more  on/off c ycles (i.e., 8 weeks) prior to Visit 1.   
8.9.[ADDRESS_542591] is using i nhaled tobramycin solution, inhaled tobramycin will be administered as 
per the manufacturer’s instructions (e.g., 300 mg in 4 or 5 mL solution, nebulized and inhaled 
twice daily using a device approved by [CONTACT_59919] ). Tobramycin solution should be 
nebulized with a n approved nebulizer and air compressor without mixing or diluting with other 
solutions, according to manufacturer instructions.    
If the subj ect is using inhaled tobramycin powder , the TOBI Podhaler will be  administered as per 
the manufacturer’s instructions (e.g., 4 dry powder capsules inhaled twice daily using the 
supplied device ).  
Ideally, tobramycin should be inhaled twice daily following  airway clearance.  Airway clearance 
includes any inhaled bronchodilators, mucolytics (e.g. , DNase, hypertonic saline), and 
mechanical clearance devices (e.g. , Vest, acapella, hand percussion).  If airway clearance is not 
clinically recommended at least twi ce daily , then tobramycin should be inhaled following the 
single airway clearance session and again each day without airway clearance.  
Tobramycin should be stored refrigerated per manufacturer ’s instructions.

[ADDRESS_542608] a causal relationship with the 
treatment.  An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally  associated with the administration of an 
investigational product, whether or not related to that investigational product.  An unexpected AE is one of a type not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the current Prescribing or 
Product Information or of greater severity or frequency than expected based on the information 
in the Prescribing or Product Information.  
The site investigator will probe, via discussion with the subject, for the occurrence of AEs during 
each subject visit and record the information in the site’s source documents.  Adverse events will 
be recorded in the subject CRF.   
AE Severity  
The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
Version 4.0, as modified for CF, should be used to assess and grade AE severity, including 
laboratory a bnormalities judged to be clinically significant. The modified criteria can be found in 
the Study Reference Binder .  If the experience is not covered in the modified criteria, the 
guidelines shown in Table 1  below should be used to grade severity.  It should be pointed out 
that the term “severe” is a measure of intensity and that a severe AE is not necessarily serious.  
Table 1.  AE Se ve rity Grading  
Severity (Toxicity Grade) Description  
Mild (1) Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated 
Moderate (2)   Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; 
limiting age -appropriate Instrumental activities of daily living (e .g., 
preparing meals, using the telephone, managing money)  
Severe (3)   Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living (e.g., bathing, 
dressing, feeding self, using toilet, taking medications)  
Life-threatening (4)  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated

AE Relationship to Study Drug  
The relationship of an AE to t he study drug (azithromycin or placebo for the randomized period, 
azithromycin for the open-label period)  should be assessed using the following the guidelines in 
Table 2 . 
Table 2.  AE Relat ionship to Study Drug  
Relationship 
to Drug  Comment  
Definitely  Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows a reasonable 
temporal sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or 
expected response pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_123807]; and that is not explained by [CONTACT_256057].  
Probably  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug; 
that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_11125]; and that is 
unlikely to be explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical 
state or by [CONTACT_82978].  
Possibly  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to that suspected drug; 
but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors.  
Unrelated  An event that can be d etermined with certainty to have no relationship to the 
study drug.  
11.2 Serious Adverse Experiences (SAE)  
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• death  
• a life-threatening adverse experience 
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• a persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other important medical events may also be considered an SAE when, based on appropriate medical judgment, they je opardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed.  
11.2.1  Serious Adverse Experience Reporting  
Study sites will document all SAEs that occur (whether or not related to study drug) on an SAE 
Report Form.  The collection period for  all SAEs will begin after informed consent is obtained 
and end after procedures for the final study visit have been completed.

continue.  The following is a list of possi ble reasons for early permanent discontinuation of study 
treatment:  
 Subject or subject’s legal representative decision  
 Adverse event, including pulmonary exacerbation  
 Protocol violation  
 Death  
If a subject is discontinued from treatment due to an AE, the subject will be followed and treated 
by [CONTACT_428868].   
All subjects who permanently discontinue study treatment early should come in for an early 
discontinuation of study treatme nt visit as soon as possible  (see Appendix 1)  and then should be 
encouraged to complete all remaining scheduled visits and procedures.  
Refer to Section 8.6.2 for temporary discontinuation of study drug.  
12.2 Early Withdrawal of Subjects from the Study

endpoint criteria.  Protocol violations for this study include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 Failure to meet eligibilit y  criteria  
 Use of a prohi bited concomitant medication. This includes the use of conditionally 
allowed medications without meeting the criteria to use these medications (e.g. 
Temporarily stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_428832]-label azithromycin).  
 Failure to obtain spi[INVESTIGATOR_23889] s 1-3 
Failure to comply with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines will also result in a protocol 
violation. The Sponsor -Investigator  will determine if a protocol violation should result in early 
discontinuation of study treatment for a subject.  
When a protocol violation occurs, it will be discussed with the investigator and a Protocol 
Violation Form detailing the violation will be generated. This form will be signed by a Sponsor representative and the site investigator. A copy of the form will be filed in the sit e’s regulatory 
binder and in the Sponsor’s files. The site will report the violation to their IRB in accordance 
with their IRB reporting requirements.  
[ADDRESS_542612] (DSMB) will review comprehensive interim enrollment , safety, 
and efficacy data reports when approximately 50% and 75% of patients have completed the 
randomized period of the study.  Regular reporting frequency to the DSMB is detailed in the 
DSMB charter.    A priori interim stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_428833]/harm with respect to the 
primary endpoint are outlined in the DSMB charter. SAEs  will be monitored by [CONTACT_428869].   Further details are included in the DSMB charter . 
15 STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS  
A detailed statistical analysis plan will be written that will describe all analyses that  will be 
generated f or this study. All analyses will be performed using SAS
® (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, 
NC, [LOCATION_003]) or R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

Version #:  4.0 Version Date: 11JUN2018  Page 43 of 56 
Protocol Template:  © CFFT TDN   Effective: 28 DEC 2012 
 15.1 Data Sets Analyzed  
All analyses will be performed using a  modif ied intent -to-treat ( m-ITT) population, which is 
defined as all randomized subjects  who received at least one dose of study drug. Subjects  who 
are discontinued from study drug tempor arily or permanently are encouraged to complete all 
remaining study visits and will remain in the analyses population according to ITT.  The primary 
efficacy analyses will be repeated in the per -protocol population, which is defined as subjects  
having completed ≥80% of doses (azithromycin and or placebo) and who did not require the use 
of acute antibiotics  or steroids . All tests will be two -sided and evaluated at a 0.05 level of 
significance.  
15.2 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Baseline demographic s and clinical characteristics recorded at Visit 1 will be summarized 
including (but not limited to) age, sex, CFTR genotype, race, height, weight, BMI, FEV 1% 
predicted, Pa bacterial density, delivery method of chronic tobramycin ( i.e., dry powdered or 
inhale d), and use of other chronic medications ( e.g., CFTR modulators,  inhaled dornase alfa and 
hypertonic saline).  
15.3 Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint will be the difference between the azithromycin and placebo treatment 
groups in the relative change from Visit 1  to Visit 3  in FEV 1 (liters).  The primary endpoint will 
be compared between treatment groups using linear regression adjusted for randomization strata. 
Least squares means and the treatment effect for the relative  change will be presented  as well as 
corresponding 95% confidence interval and p-values. The p-values will be evaluated against a 
two-sided 0.[ADDRESS_542613] change in the observed case analysis.  Further details regarding the handling of missing 
data will be provided in the statistical analysis plan.  
15.4 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
Randomized Period  
Descriptive analyses and graphical displays will be used to summarize all secondary endpoints.  Endpoints will be compared between the azithromycin and placebo treatment groups from Visit 
1 through Visit 3.  
All reported SAEs and AEs will be coded using MedDRA and grouped by [CONTACT_6764].  The 
incidence of AEs (including emergent abnormal QTc parameters) between the azithromycin and 
placebo treatment groups will  be tabulated by [CONTACT_12917], severity, and relationship to study 
drug.  Rates of (S)AEs by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC) will also be summarized.  Poisson 
regression modeling will be used to derive rate ratios and corresponding 95% confidence and to 
compare gr oups using a using a two-sided 0.[ADDRESS_542614].  Histogram s showing the frequency of 
the number of (S)AEs in each treatment group will be included.

Protocol Template:  © CFFT TDN   Effective: 28 DEC 2012 
 The proportion of subjects permanently or temporarily discontinuing study drug will also be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_12922].  Drug discontinuation events will be categorized as:  (1) 
Permanently discontinued study drug, (2) Permanently discontinued study drug and withdrew 
from study, and (3) Temporarily discontinued study drug.  Reason for permanent drug 
discontinua tion will be summarized.  C ompliance measures will be computed separately for the 
TISP and azithromycin /placebo therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   
Continuous secondary endpoints including changes in sputum bacterial density, weight, patient -
reported quality of life  (as measured by [CONTACT_428870] -R and CFRSD -CRISS),  
and pulmonary function (FEV 1 % predicted, FVC, and FEF 25%-75%) will be modeled similarly to 
the primary endpoint.  Predicted values for spi[INVESTIGATOR_428834].
[ADDRESS_542615] for the change for each secondary endpoint from Visit 1  to Visit 3 will be p resented as 
well as corresponding 95% confidence intervals and p-values.  The relative change in 
FEV 1(liters) during administration of TISP from Visit 2 to Visit 3 will b e analyzed in a similar 
manner . 
Event rates  for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , pulmonary exacerbations,  intravenous antibiotic usage, inhaled 
antibiotic usage, and oral antibiotic usage from Visit 1  through Visit 3 will be descriptively 
summarized  and differences in the proportions  of subjects with an event  between the treatment 
groups will be estimated with accompanying 95% confidence intervals . Event rates will be 
compared between treatment groups using Poisson regression.  
Open-Label Period  
Selected endpoints obtained during the randomized period will continue to be collected during 
the open-label  perio d of the study.  The change in lung function during the open-label  period will 
be modeled among placebo subjects , and compared to both the change observed in this group 
during administration of TISP  in the randomized trial and the change observed in the ac tive 
group during administration of TISP  in the randomized trial.  Moreover , among those 
randomized to azithromycin, difference s in the lung function between the randomized and open-
label periods of TISP administration will be compared. Similarly, other en dpoints measured in 
the open-label  period will be used to estimate longer term changes in response to azithromycin in 
the group randomized to azithromycin.  Data from the placebo subjec ts who entered into the 
open-label period  will be used to compare resul ts with those observed during the randomized 
period of the trial .  Further details will be provided in the SAP that will be finalized prior to the 
first interim data analysis.   
15.[ADDRESS_542616] (DSMB) will review comprehensive interim report s when 
approximately 50% and 75% of patients have completed the randomized period of the study.  
These interim report s will include an overview of enrollment , detailed summaries of SAEs, AEs, 
withdrawals, drug discontinuations, hospi [INVESTIGATOR_602], protocol violations and other clinical safety 
endpoints . The primary endpoint and select  secondary endpoints  will be summarized as outlined 
in the statistical analysis plan.  Shoul d the DSMB consider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_428835], they will be guided by a priori  interim stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_428836]/harm outlined in the DSMB charter. Regular reporting frequency to the DSMB is

 detailed in the DSMB charter.  SAEs will be monitored by [CONTACT_428871].  
15.6 Sample Size  
The primary endpoint is the difference between the azithromycin and placebo treatment groups 
in the relative change from  Visit 1 to Visit 3 in FEV 1 (liters).   Data from prior published studies  
of similar duration  are avai lable to estimate sample size and power for the study including a 
randomized, placebo-controlled trial of azithromycin in individuals with CF chronically infected 
with Pa and a randomized, placebo controlled trial of aztreonam lysine similarly among those 
with chronic Pa.  These studies suggest a standard deviation of the relative change in FEV 1 
ranging from 10 to 16.  Based on these prior studies, we ant icipate the relative change in FEV 1 
from Visit 1 to Visit 3  to be -2%  in the azithromycin arm and +6.85%  in the placebo arm for an 
overall treatment effect of 8.65%.    A sample size of 110 provides 85% power to detect a 
treatment effect of 7.5% or greater assuming a standard deviation of 13.  110 subjects provides 
93% power to detect a treatment effect similar to what wa s observed in the preliminary data 
(8.65%)  assuming a standard deviation of 13.   It is noteworthy that the standard deviation from 
more rec ently completed studies CF studies have observed standard deviations in short term 
relative change in FEV (liters) ranging from 8-11, confirming our conservatism in the standard 
deviation estimate used for our sample size calculations.    Assuming a standa rd deviation of 11, 
a sample size of 110 provides 85% power to detect a treatment effect of 6.3% or greater in favor 
of the placebo group.  Figure [ADDRESS_542617] a range of differences in relative change in FEV 1 (L).    
  
Figure [ADDRESS_542618] a range of differences in r elative change  in FEV 1 (L) for total 
sample size of 110 (55 per group)  assuming a two-sided 0.[ADDRESS_542619].  Curves (in ascending 
order) correspond to standard deviations of 15, 13, 11, 9, and 7.

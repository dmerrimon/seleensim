IRB-FY2022-373 V6: 2024.03.19 Protocol Synopsis Study Title Development of a multiple health behavior change intervention for cardiovascular risk reduction among people experiencing homelessness: The CV-HOMES study (Aim 2) Funder National Institute on Minority and Health Disparities (P50MD017342): C2Dream pi[INVESTIGATOR_592782] N/A Study Rationale People experiencing homelessness die on average 10 years earlier than their housed peers due to poorly controlled chronic physical and behavioral health conditions. Cardiovascular (CV) disease is a leading cause of death among people experiencing homelessness resulting from modifiable health behaviors. High risk behaviors are more common among people experiencing homelessness with high rates of smoking (e.g., 73-79%) and low rates of fruit/vegetable intake (e.g., 64% <5 servings/day) and inadequate physical activity (e.g., 46% do not meet recommended guidelines).  Access and insurance barriers compound individual challenges leading to even lower rates of medication adherence than general U.S. population. Study Objective(s)    Primary  • Assess the feasibility and acceptability of CV-HOMES, a behavioral activation based coaching program targeting multiple health behaviors, for people who have experienced homelessness in a single arm treatment development trial (n=8).  • Assess the feasibility of measuring cardiovascular risk in this population at [ADDRESS_781956] Article(s) One-on-one behavioral activation based coaching intervention to support behaviors to improve cardiovascular health Study Design Single arm treatment-development and feasibility trial Participant Population Key Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Patient inclusion criteria are:  (1) Moderate to high CV risk defined as self-reported diagnoses by a medical professional of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, or heart disease. (2) Experience of homelessness per the HEARTH Act which includes living in a supported housing facility (2011). (3) English-speaking, (4) and willingness to engage in coaching about changes to ≥1 health behavior related to cardiac risk that align with patients’ personal CV risk behaviors. Medical diagnoses and medications will be confirmed in medical records after enrollment. Patient exclusion criteria will include conditions raising risk for coercion or limitation of capacity to ethically consent to research: (1) active intoxication, (2) active psychosis or dementia, (3) active legal commitment (per search of publicly available civil court records) or (4) pregnancy or lactation. This is aligned with previous studies by [CONTACT_78168] (K23DK118117).  We will further confirm capacity to consent using a brief quiz (see attachments).

Study Phases Screening Intervention Follow-Up   (1) Screening: screening for eligibility and obtaining consent, baseline assessment  (2) Intervention: study intervention with counselor support approximately weekly in-person and/or by [CONTACT_648] x 12 weeks (3) Follow-up: final assessment Efficacy Evaluations • Cardiovascular health as measured by [CONTACT_14808]’s Life’s Essential 8 score.18 This includes: o Self-reported cardiovascular health behaviors (eating better, being more active, taking medications as prescribed, quitting tobacco, getting healthy sleep) o Blood pressure and body mass index (height, weight) o Cholesterol and Hemoglobin A1c measured by [CONTACT_2929]-of-care fingerstick or veinous blood draw o Skin carotenoid measurement by [CONTACT_592791] • Self-reported medication adherence • Self-reported psychological wellness • Self-reported drug and alcohol use • Self-reported health care use Safety Evaluations Not applicable in this single arm trial Statistical And Analytic Plan The primary endpoint of this study is the feasibility and acceptability of the program to participants in this treatment development phase. We will summarize themes in the end-of treatment interview, assess satisfaction via structured survey, and assess treatment dose received via frequency, length, and type of communications with study staff.  We will conduct exploratory analyses on our eventual primary behavioral endpoint of cardiovascular health. We will refine our use of patient-reported outcomes for use in a future randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]. Data And Safety Monitoring Plan [CONTACT_68954] (PI) will work closely with study staff to monitor the quality of data collected at assessment. This treatment development study (N=8), does not meet NIH criteria requiring a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), however Drs. Vickery and Busch will oversee a detailed safety monitoring plan.

IRB-FY2022-373 V6: 2024.03.[ADDRESS_781958] is to expand our team’s existing evidence-informed programs to specifically target multiple health behavior change to decrease the cardiovascular (CV) health risk of people experiencing homelessness in Minnesota and beyond. This is relevant to health disparities given the disproportionate number of Black, Indigenous, and other people of color (BIPOC) who are homeless. We plan a sequential exploratory mixed methods study design for treatment development familiar to our team from prior work (K23DK118117) with ongoing input from our community-engaged research team (Fig 2). Aim 2. Assess the feasibility and acceptability of CV-HOMES for people who have experienced homelessness in a single arm treatment development trial (n=8). We hypothesize feasibility (e.g., recruitment, treatment engagement, retention) and acceptability (of study procedures and CV-HOMES treatment). This will include examining changes in the American Heart Association’s Life’s Essential 8 score as our targeted clinical outcome. 1.2 Relevant Literature and Data People experiencing homelessness are disproportionately Black, Indigenous, and other people of color. For example, in Minnesota in 2018 an estimated 37% of adults experiencing homelessness identified as African American (compared to 6% of Minnesota adults) and 12% identified as American Indian (compared to 1% of Minnesota adults).[ADDRESS_781959] at multiple levels and throughout the life course of people experiencing homelessness.3 In previous work we demonstrated disproportionately high rates of CV health conditions among Minnesotans who were homeless (e.g., in 2018 27% reported hypertension, and 11% heart disease). We also found high rates of behavioral health conditions (e.g., in 2018 57% reported a mental health diagnosis and 42% substance use). There CV conditions and behavioral health comorbidities overlap significantly.4 CV disease is a leading cause of death among people experiencing homelessness resulting from modifiable health behaviors. High risk behaviors are more common among people experiencing homelessness with high rates of smoking (e.g., 73-79%)5 and low rates of fruit/vegetable intake (e.g., 64% <5 servings/day) and inadequate physical activity (e.g., 46% do not meet recommended guidelines).6  Access and insurance barriers compound individual challenges leading to even lower rates of medication adherence than general U.S. population.  Current permanent supportive housing (Housing First) models offer substantial opportunity to reduce homelessness but fail to achieve health improvements. Minnesota’s 2022-2023 Affordable Housing Plan commits more than $3 billion to affordable housing solutions aimed at ending homelessness.7 The National Academy of Medicine concluded “no substantial published evidence as yet to demonstrate that PSH improves health outcomes or reduces health care costs.”[ADDRESS_781960] models of general support did not lead to sustained CV risk reduction over usual care,9 suggesting that housing is necessary but not sufficient to change CV risk. This demonstrates a critical need to establish health behavior change models to reduce CV risk that are adjunctive to housing support.  
   
IRB-FY2022-373 V6: 2024.03.19 2 Wellness coaching tailored to the overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_592783], behavioral, and social needs of people experiencing homelessness offers promise to reduce health disparities.  1.3 Name [CONTACT_592803]. Behavioral activation (BA) is an empi[INVESTIGATOR_592784]. BA seeks to reconnect participants with sources of positive reinforcement via collaborative values-based goal-setting.[ADDRESS_781961] published an open trial of multiple health behavior change in cardiac patients with depression. CV-HOMES will build off of these three existing manuals.10 The CV-HOMES manual will target > 1 health behaviors to reduce CV risk (quitting or reducing tobacco use, medication adherence, physical activity, healthy eating, or sleep), psychological wellness, and referrals to meet social and behavioral needs.  Consistent with our prior work, CV-HOMES will be delivered via 8-10 sessions spanning 12 weeks. Sessions 1-2 (50 minutes each) will be completed in-person whenever possible and sessions 3-10 (30 minutes each) will be completed in-person or by [CONTACT_592792]. CV-HOMES will be delivered by a bachelor’s level providers (e.g., social worker, health educator) or higher providers. We will use 1-2 of such providers already employed in our research labs (Ella Strother, Jill Carter).  [CONTACT_68954] will participate in coaching the first few participants and train and supervise interventionists throughout the trial with support from [CONTACT_68956] as needed. Interventionists will be referred to as a “wellness coaches” per Quorum team feedback from our previous work. We will also notify the patient’s primary care provider and any other patient requested providers (e.g., cardiologist, psychiatrist) of their study involvement. CV-HOMES goal setting structure: Between session goal setting will focus on pleasant/valued activities to improve mood and goals directly aimed at improving relevant health behaviors. The patient and coach will collaboratively agree on goals that are individualized for the patient’s context. Goals are set in manageable increments (to increase self-efficacy through early success), and reviewed in detail to problem-solve any barriers encountered. All goals are explicitly written down (e.g., to-do list, daily planner) or otherwise scheduled (e.g., entered into cell phone calendar). As needed and with permission, study staff will send an automated email or text message between sessions to remind the patient to complete their goals.  Health behavior (i.e., quitting or reducing tobacco use, medication adherence, physical activity, healthy eating, or sleep) goals will be set alongside mood-focused goals using the process above, as has been successfully done in previous studies.13 If multiple health behaviors are relevant for a patient, they will be targeted sequentially. That is, coaching will initially focus on one behavior and if sufficient progress is made, the participant and coach will collaboratively decide if goals should be set targeting a second and/or third health behavior. We chose sequential targeting because simultaneous targeting of multiple health behaviors is cognitively demanding for the patient and

The content of goals will be integrated to maximize both mood improvement and health behavior change. For example, for a participant trying to quit smoking, goals will be set to avoid contact [CONTACT_173138].  Treatment Fidelity. Coaches will complete treatment fidelity checklists. All sessions will be audio recorded. [CONTACT_68954] will monitor fidelity via review of all recordings and provide feedback to coaches during weekly supervision meetings. Audio recordings will be stored securely.  Baseline only measures. At baseline we will collect demographics to describe the sample. We will also collect the Discrimination in Medical Settings scale16 given the high degree of discrimination found in previous data with this population and congruent with the larger C2DREAM grant. Primary outcomes of this proof-of-concept, single arm, treatment development pi[INVESTIGATOR_592785] (e.g., recruitment, treatment engagement, retention) and acceptability (of study procedures and CV-HOMES treatment via satisfaction survey and post-treatment interview). Secondary outcomes will include efficacy measures we plan to use in a future randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_592786] R01 randomized trial. Outcomes will be collected during screening and at a baseline and post-treatment assessment visits. We will examine feasibility by [CONTACT_592793]. We will track the ratio of invitations to screenings and screenings to enrollments. We will also examine treatment engagement and retention via the number of attended assessment visits and coaching sessions. We will use the 8-item Client Satisfaction Questionnaire and a [ADDRESS_781962].

This is also in line with the prior work of our team in diabetes with a similar population (D-HOMES, K23DK118117) which has been acceptable to participants. During this treatment development phase we will monitor and adjust the number and duration of planned sessions based on the data from participants if needed.  1.5 Relevant References See references at end of document. 1.6 Compliance Statement This study will be conducted in full accordance of all applicable Hennepin Healthcare Research Policies and Procedures and all applicable Federal and State laws and regulations.

The outcomes we will use to assess this treatment development phase of our work will be our ability to recruit and retain participants, the dose of treatment we can deliver (i.e., participant’s attendance and follow-up with scheduled sessions and treatment activities), and participants’ report of their satisfaction and overall experience during participation in a structured survey and qualitative interview.  2.2 Secondary Objectives (or Aim) The secondary objectives will be to edit protocols and treatment manual instructions to optimally support participants. We will: • Clarify recruitment and retention strategies for people with cardiovascular risk who have experienced homelessness • Assess the acceptability of patient-reported and biometric outcome measures including point of care laboratory protocols  • Refine protocols for incentives and tools to support intervention participation and behavior change  [ADDRESS_781964] of informed consent, self-reported survey items, and biometric data including cholesterol, A1c, and skin carotenoid measurement via VEGGIE METER. Blood samples for cholesterol and A1c will be collected by [CONTACT_592794], Cholestech, A1c Now Professional, or CardioChek Plus Analyzer (1-3 drops of blood). If the POC machines using small amounts of blood are malfunctioning, veinous blood draws (100 microliters) may be scheduled and collected for the study at the Healthcare for the Homeless or

This is a maximum of 16 weeks duration per participant.  3.3.2 Total Number of Study Sites/Total Number of Participants Projected Enrollment for the study will continue until [ADDRESS_781968] with other housing and community partners to identify community spaces if necessary.   3.4 Study Population 3.4.1 Use of Vulnerable Populations  This study focuses on adults experiencing moderate or high CVD risk and homelessness (CVH). This is justified given the premature morbidity and mortality of this population. While not formally considered a vulnerable population, CVH are a population requiring special attention regarding safety and respectful engagement in research.  A consent quiz will be used to ensure that no individuals unable to consent are recruited similar to protocols used in [CONTACT_68954]’s other studies.   Furthermore, we will continue working closely with staff at Catholic Charities, other community partners, and a multi-stakeholder team to ensure we achieve cultural congruence with the ways we approach and engage this population in research as well as with the planned study protocols.  
   
IRB-FY2022-373 V6: 2024.03.19 6  3.5 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 3.5.1 Inclusion Criteria Inclusion criteria: 1. Age [ADDRESS_781969] 2 years 4. Self-reported diagnosis of moderate or high CVD risk, defined as being told by a medical professional that the participant has hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, or heart disease 5. Plan to stay in local area or be reachable by [CONTACT_68925] 16 weeks 6. Willingness to work on one or more CVD risk reduction behavior change identified during the screener. The behavior change meet specified qualifying criteria for each CVD risk behavior (below; also see Assessment table for exact wording of screening questions). (i.e., If the patient uses combustible tobacco products, they qualify and must be willing to work on quitting tobacco. If the participant qualifies for the study because they get less than [ADDRESS_781970] be willing to work on getting more sleep as the focus of coaching.) a. Quitting tobacco: Any use of combustible tobacco in the last 30 days b. Taking prescription medications: Having daily prescriptions and reporting missed doses some, most, or every time they were due in the last 7 days; or wanting help getting prescription medications (e.g. medications advised in the past but not currently receiving). c. Getting healthy sleep: Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] <6 hours or >9 hours per night d. Moving your body: <3 days per week with 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity e. Eating healthy: <5 days per week following healthful eating plan, getting 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables, or >2 days per week eating high fat foods.  3.5.2   Exclusion Criteria 1. Active intoxication 2. Active psychosis  3. Presence of a legal guardian 4. Pregnant or lactating people Patients who do not meet all enrollment criteria will not be enrolled. Any violations of these criteria will be reported in accordance with IRB Policies and Procedures.  Rationale for excluding pregnant people: People who are pregnant may have less control over their health and typi[INVESTIGATOR_592787]. Though we do not think participation in this study poses a risk to pregnant people, we do not think we can accurately measure the effect of our program in this population.   Retain participants who become pregnant during the study:  
   
IRB-FY2022-373 V6: 2024.03.19 7 Risk of withdrawing care: We have opted to retain participants who become pregnant after enrollment because a) we do not think interaction with a wellness coach poses greater than minimal risk and b) prematurely withdrawing the care of the wellness coach from a vulnerable population (pregnant people who are experiencing homelessness) poses a greater risk than continued participation.  Mitigation of risk: Our coaching is designed to adapt to the unique goals of each participant, and we recognize that people who become pregnant during the study will likely be working on their cardiovascular health with their care team. In the case that a participant becomes pregnant, we will ask the participant to sign a release of information so we can communicate with their OB, midwife, or other provider overseeing their pregnancy to ensure coaching goals align with the diet and wellness goals established by [CONTACT_13917]. 4 STUDY PROCEDURES 4.1 Qualifying Visit  4.1.1 Eligibility, screening visit As outlined in Table 1, before consent, interested participants will complete a phone or in-person screening. This will cover inclusion and exclusion criteria and briefly describe the intervention to ensure the participant is aware and willing to commit to study.  4.1.2  Baseline Assessment  The baseline assessment will begin with the participant’s signed consent. As outlined in Table [ADDRESS_781971]: • Informed Consent, HIPPA authorization • Review Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria • Demographics/Medical History • Release of information for health systems used in last 12 mo.  • Primary care team • Biometric data including height, weight, blood pressure, skin carotenoids, hemoglobin A1c, and cholesterol levels.  o Fingerstick (1-3 drops; collected by [CONTACT_464]) will be collected, run on point-of-care machines (e.g. Cholestech, DCA Vantage, A1C Now, CardioChek Plus), and then disposed of appropriately following the biometrics protocol for CV-Homes. In case of machine malfunction, veinous blood samples (100 microliters) will be scheduled for study participants and collected at HCH or Hennepin Healthcare labs. o Skin carotenoids will be measured using reflection spectroscopy by a non-invasive machine called the VEGGIE METER. As confirmed via email, the VEGGIE METER is a patented and validated pi[INVESTIGATOR_592788]- funded research. There is a standard protocol for use which will be followed. • Patient-reported outcome survey items and physiological measures: See Table 2  After consent and HIPPA authorization are obtained, study staff will access participants’ medical records to confirm a diagnosis of one of the qualifying CVD risk conditions. If patients are found not to qualify at this point, they will be excluded from the study.

Informed consent and HIPAA authorization will always be collected at baseline assessment visit 1. However, we will adjust when other data are collected based on participant and assessment surveyor feedback.   
   
IRB-FY2022-373 V6: 2024.03.19 10 4.2 Intervention structure This will be a 10 session, 12-week in-person, video, and/or phone-based support program with assessment for 2 weeks before and 1 week after treatment visits. The treatment will center on providing CVD health education, with a focus on behaviors to address modifiable risk, goal-setting support, and resource and care coordination. Modality of treatment delivery (in-person, phone, or video platform) will be adapted based on logistics by [CONTACT_592795]-19 in our community.   In-person assessment and treatment visits will be conducted in private spaces at Catholic Charities’ facilities, at sites convenient to participants, or at HHRI/HHS. All in-person assessment and treatment visits will follow current guidance from HHRI and Hennepin Healthcare about social distancing and use of personal protective equipment. Video visits will be conducted via a secure Zoom or Teams link (using HHRI or Hennepin Healthcare HIPPA secure technology). Phone visits will be conducted via a study cellphone or office phone or using the secure TelemedIQ app of study team members.   Psychological approaches of behavioral activation and motivational interviewing will be used along with provision of educational materials and tools to support behavior change. Which educational materials are given to which participants will be decided by [CONTACT_592796], learning preferences, and the specific goals that are mutually set.   Participants will each receive a tool of approximately $[ADDRESS_781975] tools of nicotine lozenges or patches (see safety protocol, pregnancy in inclusion/ exclusion criteria). These tool choices are based on extensive qualitative development work with patients and providers (R03HL136540, Aim [ADDRESS_781976]).  To facilitate follow-up with this population, we will ask participants to provide multiple modalities by [CONTACT_136025], including phone, email, and secondary contacts.  While study visits may occur by [CONTACT_648], email communications will be limited to content only related to arranging details of when/where and how to connect with participants or sharing resources or educational materials with permission. Participants will provide their email addresses and provide signed consent to be contact[CONTACT_592797]. Privacy concerns and appropriate use of email to arrange for other communication with study team will be noted in the consent.  We will also ask participants to identify two people who know them well and would know how to reach them if we are not able to contact [CONTACT_592798]. Similarly, we will ask participants to identify medical and social service providers who would know their current contact [CONTACT_136029]. Participants will be asked to sign appropriate releases of information to allow medical and social service providers to share this information with the study team.  
   
IRB-FY2022-373 V6: 2024.03.19 11 4.2.1 Wellness coaching content Session 1 will acclimate the patient to the coaching program and inform future goal setting. Coaches will collaboratively identify an initial health behavior target (i.e., eating better, being more active, taking medications as prescribed, quitting tobacco, or getting healthy sleep; the patient must be currently below recommended guidelines and willing to work on improvement), and provide self-monitoring activities to track mood and health behaviors. Session 2 will include review of patient self-monitoring of mood, activities, and target health behavior, emphasizing mood/behavior relationships, a structured values assessment to identify life areas that the participant cares deeply about; this was adapted by [CONTACT_592799]. Values will be used to set 2-4 goals that can be completed before the next session Starting at session 2, participants will work with coaches to identify an affordable, commercially available behavior change tools related to their relevant health behavior and tailored to patient preferences and comorbidities as above. Session 3-10 will follow the same format to assess wellness (mood), activity, and relevant health behavior between sessions, review adherence to goals from the previous session, address barriers, and choose 2-[ADDRESS_781977] and preferred learning style.

These may include between-visit text messages, calls, e-mails, or private messages on secure social media platforms per the participant’s preference. These will be done with input and agreement by [CONTACT_2299]. The interventionist will also respond to participant-initiated between visit communications. Should communications become too frequent or surpass agreed upon treatment boundaries, the interventionist will be guided to set boundaries and limit contact [CONTACT_592800]. Vickery and/or Busch.  4.4 Concomitant Treatment All prior and concomitant primary care and cardiovascular care will be reviewed as needed to support study goals. Care for relevant co-morbidities (mental illness, substance use disorder, cardiac disease, etc.) will also be noted and encouraged as it aligns with participant psychological wellness or CV health (e.g., follow-up with psychiatry or cardiology).

IRB-FY2022-373 V6: 2024.03.19 13 6 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 6.1 Primary Endpoint Primary outcomes The primary endpoint of this study is the feasibility and acceptability of the program to participants in this treatment development phase. We will assess this by [CONTACT_68940], the dose of treatment we can deliver (i.e., participant’s attendance and follow-up with scheduled sessions and treatment activities), and participants’ report of their satisfaction and overall experience during participation in a structured survey (CSQ-8) and qualitative post-treatment interview. Secondary outcomes will include measures we plan to use in a future randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (see Assessment Table).   Clinical Outcomes will occur at baseline and post-treatment. Our primary target is a composite measure of cardiovascular health developed by [CONTACT_14808], Life’s Essential 8 (see Table 2).[ADDRESS_781981] descriptive summaries (e.g. means and standard deviations for continuous variables such as age and percentages for categorical variables such as gender). We will also collect data using the Discrimination in Medical Settings scale, which has been pi[INVESTIGATOR_592789] (D-HOMES; D-HOMES-Spanish).16   6.2.2 Efficacy Analysis The primary purpose of this study is feasibility and acceptability. This will be assessed using the following data: Qualitative data Analysis of audio recordings of post-treatment interviews will be completed by [CONTACT_136030], treatment experience, and suggested changes of intervention participants.  Survey data from the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Exploratory analyses by [CONTACT_592802].

If an emergency physical or behavioral health situation arises, study staff will arrange for immediate clinical support from PI ([CONTACT_68954]), Health Care for the Homeless clinical staff (who have a walk-in treatment model), the Hennepin County mental health crisis team (COPE Line, available by [CONTACT_14379]-person 24hrs./day, 7 days/week), or emergency medical services as appropriate. In the case of suicidal ideation, study staff will use the SI Questionnaire to guide their approach to working with the participant and reach out to [CONTACT_68954] for support. These events will be written up and reviewed by [CONTACT_978] ([CONTACT_68954]) and primary mentor ([CONTACT_68956]) within 48 hours of the event and reported to the IRB if needed.

As deemed necessary by [CONTACT_68942]/or HHRI IRB, issues related to patient safety will be reviewed with mental health or medical professionals at HCMC not affiliated with the study who will provide recommendations for withdrawal from the study, referrals for additional care, or other necessary action.   [ADDRESS_781988]-treatment interviews will be audio recorded. Notes about treatment plans and notes summarizing main themes about satisfaction, treatment experience, and suggested changes will be created. Notes will remove all 18 HIPPA personal identifiers if mentioned. Notes will use only Participant ID numbers and will contain no personal identifiers. Once audio recordings are uploaded to the HHRI-maintained computer network, they will be 
   
IRB-FY2022-373 V6: 2024.03.19 16 deleted from the audio recording equipment. Audio recordings will be destroyed on or before the end of the study, 10/31/2024.   Since assessment visits will be conducted at locations away from the research offices, research staff will store all documents in a locked folder while moving between community locations and the office. Immediately after visits, consent forms, point of care test results, audio equipment, and other study materials will be returned to the secure research offices of Hennepin Healthcare Research Institute. Each office has a locked door in a badge-access-only wing of the Institute. Signed consent documents will further be stored in a locked file drawer whose key will be stored in a separate locked key box.  Study data, including all audio recordings will be stored and analyzed on [CONTACT_68954] and her staff’s HHRI-maintained computer network. This network is robust, secure, and has state-of-the-art back-up and password protections.

However, we have a detailed data safety and monitoring plan. [CONTACT_68954] will have primary responsibility for monitoring all procedures for data collection, analysis, and storage. Any adverse events, breaches of confidentiality, or other data or safety issues that arise will be discussed during regular meetings with [CONTACT_68956]. If needed, [CONTACT_68956] will locate representatives independent of the study team for input.  
   
IRB-FY2022-373 V6: 2024.03.19 17 All issues related to patient safety (e.g., psychiatric distress) will be reviewed with medical and mental health professionals at Hennepin Healthcare not affiliated with the study who will provide recommendations for withdrawal from the study, referrals for additional care, or other necessary action.  If requested by [CONTACT_68944], a DSMB will be convened.  9.4.2  Risk Assessment Discomfort or distress when completing assessment and treatment procedures. Some participants may feel uncomfortable or distressed answering personal or private questions during assessment or treatment. Some participants may feel uncomfortable or experience minor bleeding or bruising as a result of the fingerstick or veinous blood draws. Some participants may also feel uncomfortable or distressed due to the collection of biometric data (e.g., weight). In previous studies by [CONTACT_6283]. Vickery and Busch, when individuals did report discomfort in these situations, it was mild.   We minimize discomfort or distress with three key approaches: (1) clearly explaining the study and emphasizing the optional nature of participation, (2) conducting all treatment sessions and assessment visits in private settings, (3) staff training about the sensitivity of chronic health conditions and the specific circumstances of homelessness including how to offer appropriate support.  Confidentiality or loss of privacy. We will collect potentially sensitive information about participants; if released inappropriately, participants may experience embarrassment or distress. The seriousness of the consequences would depend on the nature of the information revealed and to whom the information was revealed. See Section 9.[ADDRESS_781990] pain or become pregnant while using the patch.   9.4.3  Potential Benefits of Trial Participation Potential benefits for participants include free health coaching with a goal of improved cardiovascular health, which can reduce their morbidity and mortality if sustained. Free coaching related to psychological wellness may improve participants’ quality of life. Furthermore, there may be indirect benefits for participants in knowing they have helped promote research to develop an intervention that could help other people at later times.  
   
IRB-FY2022-373 V6: 2024.03.[ADDRESS_781991] information, and indicated willingness to participate in coaching. We will also use snowball sampling to identify and screen interested people. We may also set up tabling events with study flyers and snacks at Catholic Charities’ facilities or community spaces.   Potential Participants will be screened in person or by [CONTACT_648] (see Assessment Table).   9.6  Informed Consent/Assent and HIPAA Authorization We will collect signed consent and HIPAA authorization from all participants. The consent will also include HIPAA authorization to review their electronic health record at Hennepin Healthcare and any other systems where they have gotten care in the last year. Staff will review consent documents with participants and monitor their comprehension using teach back methods.  After presentation of key features of the document, research staff will administer a 4-question consent quiz to confirm comprehension from all patient participants. This will be a written quiz but administered orally to participants who request it. Participants must answer all questions on the consent quiz correctly to consent. Research staff may administer the quiz up to [ADDRESS_781992] answers prior to the second administration.  All questions will be answered by [CONTACT_68947]. Participants will be given up to thirty minutes to make the decision to participate and more time if requested. Those requesting more may be invited to reschedule their baseline enrollment visit. The consent form is written at the sixth-grade reading level or below.   If any participant appears to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol or unstable from a mental health perspective, or otherwise unable to consent, or if they fail the consent quiz, we will politely exclude them from participating.   If COVID-19 or other logistics necessitate, assessment and treatment visits will be conducted by [CONTACT_68948] (HHRI Zoom and/or HHRI or HCMC or Hennepin County Teams) and arrangements will be made for brief collection of biometrics in accordance with HHRI and/or Catholic Charities policy.   9.7  Payment to Participants/Families Participants will be paid for their participation in several ways: (1) For study visits that occur outside of participants’ housing facility, reimbursement for parking or bus tokens will be provided.  (2) Monthly reimbursement for cell phone minutes or the use of a study provided phone

Phone minutes/text messages for virtual or phone visits be reimbursed $20 per month.  Use your participant phone with monthly stipend Mo. 1 Mo. 2 Mo. 3 $20 $20 $20     9.7.2  Payments to Participant for time, effort, and inconvenience (i.e. compensation) Participants will be additionally reimbursed for study assessment visits at baseline and at the end of treatment for their effort and inconvenience. This includes a finger-stick blood draw at each visit. We will compensate participants $30 for their baseline visit and $[ADDRESS_781993] per their preference. Maximum total compensation will be $90. This is similar to other studies [CONTACT_68954] has completed with a similar population and congruent with recommendations from people with lived experience who advise this project. We have found this amount to be respectful while not being so high as to be coercive.    Assessment visits Baseline Final Assessment Payment $30 $60  The amount and form of these payments were set with input and approval by [CONTACT_29472]-stakeholder research team of people with lived experience and multi-disciplinary providers.  We will also provide a $10 stipend if participants need blood re-drawn for either the baseline or final visit.

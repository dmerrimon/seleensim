Introd uction: 
 
Hepatobiliary imagi ng (HIDA)  has an important role in the evaluation of the function and 
dynamics  of the hepatobiliary  system and the flow of bile to the gastrointestinal system. Contractility 
of the gallbladder is one of the functions that are uniquely evaluated using a HIDA scan. Poor 
contractility of the gallbladder can be the source of pain in many patients. Anatomic  imag ing studies 
like ultrasoun d, CT and/or MRI are usually normal  in these patients. 
 
Contractility of the gallbladder is evaluated during a HIDA scan by [CONTACT_431709] (CCK) a physiologic peptide enzyme  produced in the duodenum in response to the 
presence of fatly meal which causes  the gallbladder to contract and the sphincter of Oddi to relax, 
thus allowing the flow of bile from the gallbladder to the duodenum. CCK is usually administered 
during a HIDA scan intravenously after filling of the gallbladder with radioactive tracer  to simulate the 
action of the endogenous CCK in contracting the gallbladder and relaxation of sphincter of Oddi. 
Gallbladder ejection fraction (GBEF) in response to CCK injection is calculated using special  computer 
software program. A normal gallbladder ejection fraction is equal to or greater than 35%. Alternative 
to CCK injection, the patient may be administered milk  as a fatty drink that should stimulate a normal 
gallbladder to contract when it reaches the duodenum approximately 15-[ADDRESS_546111] used both 
intravenous CCK stimulation and oral milk a dministration together in the same patient. 
IRB NUMBER:  HSC -MS-16-0015  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  09/30/2016   This study aims  to combine the use of IV CCK administration followed by [CONTACT_431710] a 
HIDA scan to further stimulate gallbladder contractility and decre ase the number of false positive 
HIDA s cans and unnecessary cholecystectomies  in some  patients. 
 
 
 
 
Objectives: 
 
- To evaluate any change in gallbladder contractility as reflected by a change in GBEF in the 
same  patient when milk is administered orally  after intrave nous CCK administration during a 
HIDA s can. 
- To evaluate the number of patients that might change from an abnormal low GBEF to a normal 
value. 
- To estimate the aver age change in GBEF with the administration of milk after intraveno us CCK 
administration. 
- Follow up the outcome  of the patients up to 6 months interval  after the study. 
 
Methods: 
 
- A total of [ADDRESS_546112] dose of 4-6 mCi Tc-99m Choletec IV and dynam ic 
blood flow imag es in 1 seco nd/frame imag es for 1 minute followed by 60 min acquisition of 
sequential imag es of the abdomen at 1 min / frame rate.  
- If gallbladder is visualized during the first 60 min of imag es, CCK will be administered IV at 
0.02mg/Kg  slowly over [ADDRESS_546113] of care protocol. The GBEF will be calculated using the usual 
computer analysis program. 
- If the gallbladder ejection fraction is less than the normal value of 35%, the patient will have 
the study explained and will be consented to be a participant of this study.  The patient, who 
agre es to participate, will drink 8oz of half and half milk.  After 15-20 minutes waiting period, 
the patient will be imag ed again  with sequential static imag es of the abdomen  at 1min/ frame 
for an additional 30 minutes which will conclude the study. 
- The GBEF will be recalcu lated ag ain after the ingestion of milk  and compared to the GBEF after 
CCK administration. 
- The patients’ outcome in 6 month will be reviewed and data will be collected. In the event 
there are no medical records for the patient at 6 months, the patient may be contact[CONTACT_5365] a 
follow up call by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her designee. 
IRB NUMBER:  HSC -MS-16-0015  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  09/30/2016    
 
Inclusion Criteria: 
 
- All patients referred for a HIDA s can for eva luation of gallbladder function. 
 
-  Patients with gallbladder ejection fraction of less than 35% after administration of CCK. 
 
- Patients who are able to lie flat on the imag ing table for an additional [ADDRESS_546114] of care 1.5 hour HIDA s can. 
 
Exclusion Criteria: 
 
- Patient allergic to milk or dairy products. 
- Non visualized Gall bladder. 
- Patients below age of 18. 
 
Data Collection: 
 
A list  of enrolled subjects will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_431708]. Each subject will be given  a coded ID. 
The list of name, MR# and coded ID will be kept separate from the database, in a password-protected 
computer and/or locked room.  The list will be used to correlate the image interpre tation with the 
follow-up clinical information. 
 
The database will contain the coded ID,  as well as: 
 
- Patient demogra phics including gender, age and age at onset of abdominal pain. 
- Clinical  information regarding the nature and frequency of abdominal pain. 
- HIDA with CCK ima ge interpretation findings. 
- HIDA with milk i nterpre tation findings. 
- Summa ry of findings of other imagi ng modalities. 
- Clinical  follow-up parameters:   Patients’ outcome data regar ding relief of symptoms, 
any surgical  interventi on, medical interventi on or no interventi on. 
 
The  electronic  database  will  be  transferred  between  team  members  via  secu re  share  software 
approved by [CONTACT_46769]. 
 
 
 
 
Data Analysis: 
 
The study results will be analyzed using descriptive statistics. The change in abnormal GBEF 
between CCK alone versus CCK with milk  will be evaluated. Finally, the number of studies that were 
changed from abnormal to normal will be summarized. 
IRB NUMBER:  HSC -MS-16-0015  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  09/30/2016   Outcomes: 
 
There are two possible  groups of patients after ingestion of milk  and the addition of [ADDRESS_546115] group and 
resolution of pain and other symptoms  if they had cholecystectomies or medically treated.

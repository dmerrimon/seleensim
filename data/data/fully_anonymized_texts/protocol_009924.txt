 Page 3 of 12 Revis ed: January 31, 2023  1.0 Objectives  
1.1 Purpose, specific aims, and/or objectives.  
This proposed study aims to develop group -based trajectory models to 
identify patients with similar medication filling behavior amo ng patients 
with co -morbid hypertension (HTN) and diabetes (DM) using angiotensin 
converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) or angiotensin receptor blockers 
(ARB). A motivational interviewing (MI) pharmacy student telephone 
intervention will then be customized by  [CONTACT_62079]/ARB adherence.   
1.2 Hypothesis  
It is our central hypothesis that the customized MI based pharmacy student 
intervention will be beneficial in improving medication adherence to 
ACEI/ARBs.  
 
2.0 Background  
2.1 Diabetes (DM) and hypertension (HTN) are independent risk factors for 
cardiovascular (CV) disease and major public health issues in the United 
States (US). The two conditions frequently coexist, with 70 -80% of DM 
patient s also having HTN. The combination significantly increases the risk 
of macrovascular and microvascular DM complications. Controlling high 
blood pressure (BP) can greatly reduce these complications including the 
CV risk which accounts for 50 -80% of DM fatal ities. Angiotensin 
converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) and Angiotensin receptor blockers 
(ARB) are highly recommended for patients with DM and HTN, with a 
well-documented benefit in reducing DM complications.  
The project will have 2 phases: Phase [ADDRESS_66916] study is: [ZIP_CODE] -01-(7926)

 Page 4 of 12 Revis ed: January 31, 2023  3.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
3.1 Inclusion Criteria: Patients over the age of 18, with continuous 
enrollment in the Cigna Medicare Advantage health plan in [LOCATION_007] starting July, 
2016  until January 2018  with a diagnosis of comorbid DM and HTN an d having 
a prescription filled for an ACEI or ARB medication during  the month of 
January, 2017.  The patient identification period will be included in the study . 
Patients who disenroll or die before the study ends will be excluded from the 
study..  Exclusion criteria include having a diagnosis (identified by [CONTACT_48334] -10 
codes) for dementia, or an ACEI/ARBS contraindication like angioedema, 
hyperkalemia, renal arte ry stenosis.  
3.2 Describe how potential subjects will be screened for eligibility  based on 
these criteria : The retrospective analysis will apply these exclusion and 
inclusion criteria during the data analysis stage to give the final cohort of 
patients.  
3.3 This study will not include any vulnerable population, mentioned below:  
1. Adults unable to consent  
2. Individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers)  
3. Pregnant women  
4. Prisoners  
5. Students for whom you have direct access to/influence on grades  
6. Economically and/or educationally disadvantaged persons  
 
4.0 Vulnerable Populations  
4.1 N/A 
5.[ADDRESS_66917] approximately 
22,000 patients with DM and HTN.   
5.2 In the intervention phase, 250 -300 patients will be included in the 
intervention phase. If 1 control is used for each pati ent in the intervention 
group, the total sample of phase 2 is expected to be 500-600.  
6.0 Recruitment Methods  
 
LOCAL:  
6.[ADDRESS_66918] will be implemented in collaboration with Cigna -Health 
Spring, a Medicare Advantage Plan in [LOCATION_007]. The health plan has several 
electronic data files available for analysis incl uding membership file, member

 Page 5 of 12 Revis ed: January 31, [ADDRESS_66919] lab, Cigna -
Health Spring’s medical claims file (CCMS) and pharmacy file. Pharmacy files 
contain Part D pharmacy data provided by [CONTACT_62080] r 
including patient/ drug identifying information, fill dates, days of supply, 
quantity dispensed and dosing for each prescription filled. The refill data will be 
used to determine the non -adherent patients. ICD -[ADDRESS_66920] of actively enrolled members, taking the medication who were a part of 
phase 1 will be created by [CONTACT_62081] t o be used for intervention 
implementation at their premises. The phone call will be made by [CONTACT_62082] -HealthSpring. The 
form of informed consent which will be read to the patient is attached to  the IRB. 
If the patient consents to receive the intervention over the phone, and completes 
the phone call, the patient forms a part of the intervention group. Five follow -up 
phones will be attempted one month apart for the patient after the initial call.   
7.0 Study Timelines  
7.1 The duration of the total study will be 3 years. Retrospective analysis of 
phase  1 and intervention development will require  12 months. The  
retrospective analysis will use data from July2016-January 2018 . July – 
December 2016 will be used for baseline covariate measurement. January 
2017 - January 2018 will include adherence measurement. However this is 
de-identified patient data used for retrospective analysis and does not 
require patient participation . 
7.2 The phase 2 of the study will involve the intervention call provided in the 
day of consent followed by [CONTACT_62083] -up calls for six months. The 
patient however can refuse to participate in any of the calls, even if the 
patient has completed the primary phon e call  
7.3 The number, frequ ency and length of study visits : One intervention call 
lasting 12-15 minutes on average. Monthly follow up calls to the patients 
who received the initial call for six months lasting on an average for 5 -10 
minutes. (First call + 5 fol low-up calls)  
7.4 The duration anticipated to enroll all study subjects : The enrollment will 
continue for a period of 8 months (equivalent to an  2 active  semesters ) 
7.5 The estimated date for the inves tigators to complete this study:  3 years

8.0 Study Endpoints  
8.1 Develop group -based trajectory models to identify patients with similar 
medication filling behavior patterns among patients utilizing ACEI/ARBs with 
co-morbid HTN and DM enrolled in a MAP and examine predictors associated 
with having different trajectories.  
8.2 Customize a pharmacy student telephone intervention incorporating MI by 
[CONTACT_62084] 1.  
8.3 Demonstrate the benefit of the customized intervention on ACEI/ARB 
adherence among non-adherent patients with co -morbid HTN and DM enrolled 
in a MAP . 
9.0 Procedures Involved  
9.1 Phase 1: Retrospective data analysis  
Patients that used a study medication during January  [ADDRESS_66923] prescription date during this time will be considered the index data. A 
dummy variable will be created to indicate prevalent user vs incident user by 
[CONTACT_62085] 6 month data prior to index date  (July – December 2016) . Patient 
adherence will be assessed during the one year following the index  date. 
Adherence will be measured as proportion of days covered (PDC). PDC rates 
over the entire 360 -day assessment period will be determined. PDC will also be 
calculated separately for each month during the one year following the index date. 
During each o f the 12 consecutive 30 -day periods of adherence assessment, a 
binary indicator for “full adherence” each month, defined as PDC= 0.8 vs. non -
adherence will be created. The 12 binary indicators of full adherence will then be 
modeled during each 30 -day perio d as a longitudinal response in a logistic group - 
based trajectory model. Patients will be assigned to a trajectory on the basis of 
these models. Several logistic regression models will then be carried out to 
identify predictors associated with specific tr ajectories for adherence.  
9.2 Covariates: Demographics (age, gender, and language), physician 
specialty (primary care vs. specialist), health plan (low income subsidy vs.

Risk Score, Ch arlson comorbidity index (CCI) and number of distinct 
medications. Additionally, selected co morbidities will be identified by [CONTACT_48334] -10 
codes during the one year prior to index date including congestive heart failure, 
coronary artery disease, peripheral vasc ular disease, myocardial infarction, 
diabetes, stroke hypertension, end stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and depression. To ensure appropriate 
risk adjustment in the models, additional covariates which will be adde d to the 
model include, regimen  complexity, class of antihypertension medication used, 
baseline adherence measured as PDC, previous hospi[INVESTIGATOR_62076]’s 
trajectory prior to intervention.  
Customization of intervention: After completion of the retro spective analysis 
phase and identifying the major trajectories in this patient population, the team 
will meet to discuss the patterns identified, the potential barriers likely to be 
associated with each trajectory, and strategies that can help patients wit hin each 
trajectory based on their behavior pattern. The team will then develop customized 
education specific to each identified trajectory. For example: some patients can 
have  high medication use in the early part of the follow up period but poor after, 
others may have low initial use and improved subsequent. Some may have 
intermittent adherence throughout the follow up time, others may simply 
discontinue. The expected barrier and potential solutions that should be discussed 
with the patient using MI stra tegies will vary accordingly.  Patients past 
adherence patterns will guide the team in determining probable barriers and what 
can potentially help the patient. For example, patients who discontinue the 
medication may have side effects concerns or may view the medication as 
unnecessary. Patients who continue to take medication but have less than 0.[ADDRESS_66924] adaptation for the Elicit -Provide -Elicit  approach  of MI

 Page 8 of 12 Revis ed: January 31, 2023  Additionally, the students will ask the 2 questions from the Patient Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ) -2, a validated screening tool for depression (attached).If the 
patient responds positively to either question, the student will suggest that the 
patient  schedules an appointment with his/her healthcare provider to discuss these 
symptoms. The Supervising pharmacists will be available to assist the students in 
answering any medication related questions that may arise during the calls and 
arrange for a diabe tes educator to contact [CONTACT_62086] a later time if needed. 
Follow up p hone calls will be performed eac h month for a total of six calls. 
Students will be supervised by [CONTACT_62087] d intervention implementation. The 
students who will be implementing the calls will attend a three day MI training 
facilitated by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Abughosh, who is experienced in utilizing motivational 
interviewing to improve adherence. The students will practice calls  as a part of 
their training. They will also complete Human Subjects Research training before 
their rotation at Cigna Healthspring, and the certificates will be uploaded to the 
IRB application.  After each initial call, students will record the date and wr ite a 
summary of the interaction with the patient documenting the main barrier/s 
identified in the conversation and the plan made with the patient. During the 
follow up calls, students will emphasize the information, confirm problem solved, 
provide further  encouragement and reinforce adherence.  
Control group: For every patient that received a call, a control will be randomly 
selected from the list of patients randomly assigned to the control group.  
10.[ADDRESS_66926] completed human subjects’ research 
training as well as training for motivational interviewing. Additionally, the 
research team members closely supervise the pharmacy students to ensure 
the quality of the calls. Thus, it is not an ticipated that the intervention can 
harm any patient in any way

single excel sheet which will be available only at Cigna – HealthSpring. The students will 
have no access to the notes  otherwise. After the completion of the intervention phase, the 
excel sheet will be deidentified, and will contain a de -identified ID and corresponding 
barrier to adherence. This information will be provided to UH for understanding the 
success of the intervention process.

 Page 10 of 12 Revis ed: January 31, [ADDRESS_66930] intervention data will be 
de-identified and the analysis completed. Data will be stored on a secured 
server for a period of 3 years after  completion of the study. The attached 
script is an example of how MI has been used previously by [CONTACT_62088], in research led by [CONTACT_978].  
17.0 Informed Consent Process  
The intervention is conducted on the phone, and therefore the consent will be 
obtained orally on the phone. The pharmacy student will read the consent letter 
(attached) to the patient, and once the patient says that he or she agrees to 
participate in the study, does the student proceed with the intervention. The 
patient can refuse, or ask the pharmacy student to cal l another time.  
18.[ADDRESS_66931] identifiers will be removed before providing any information to 
University of Houston. All information will be analyzed and  results reported 
in aggregated form. Thus, the protected health information of patients will 
not be accessed by [CONTACT_62089], and therefore we will not  be obtaining, creating, 
using, and/or disclosing individually identifiable health information 
associated with a H IPAA -covered component or entity in the course of the 
research.  
20.[ADDRESS_66932] concern. Data 
will be stored  on the secure server for 3 years following the completion of 
the study . All analysis will be conducted on the desktop at UH College of 
Pharmacy. The data will not be accessible through any personal computers.  
SAS 9.4 is the statistical software, which will be used for the analysis.

 Page 11 of 12 Revis ed: January 31, 2023  Baseline characteristics : Comparisons in baseline characteristics  will be 
made  between the 2 study groups (intervention vs. control) using t -tests for 
continuous variables and chi -square tests for categorical variables. The 
characteristics evaluated will include predisposing factors: demographics, 
and number of other me dications used ; enabling factors: health plan (LIS vs. 
not), prescriber specialt y (specialist vs. primary care);  need factors: co -
morbidities (CHF, MI, CAD, stroke, ESRD, depression), previous 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_62077].   
Baseline PDC in the [ADDRESS_66933] 
adherence trajectory will also be compared between 2 groups. Because of 
the randomization, we do not anticipate any significant differences between 
the two study groups on these characteristics.  
Outcome analysis : Refill data during [ADDRESS_66934] during the 6 months 
when the follow up calls were ongoing as well as after these calls had 
stopped. The adherence rate will be defined as proportion of days covered 
(PDC ) for six and twelve month follow up period following the intervention. 
An intent to treat analysis will be utilized.  
To examine the effect of study group (intervention vs. control) on 
adherence, study group PDC means for each follow up time, [ADDRESS_66935] for the imbalance. 
The outcome variable will be PDC during each follow up period, 6 and 12 
months, following the interventi on initial call. The primary exposure 
variable will be study group, and other covariables will include any baseline 
characteristics not equally distributed.  
Dichotomization of the outcome: Patients in both groups will also be 
categorized as adherent vs. n ot during the two follow up periods based on 
PDC≥80% in each time period, [ADDRESS_66936] for imbalances

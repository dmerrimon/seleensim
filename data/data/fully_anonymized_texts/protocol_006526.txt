1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
This prospective  trial will examine  whether  indocyanine  green  (ICG) -guided  
intraoperative  transdermal  lymphography  is non-inferior  to pre-operative  technetium  
lymphoscintigraphy  (TcL)  for detecting  sentinel  lymph  nodes  (SLN)  in pediatric  patients  with 
solid tumors.   The primary  endpoint  is the detection  rate for TcL-labeled  and ICG-labeled  
SLNs.   Secondary  outcomes  will include  safety  of ICG, number  of positive  nodes  detected  
with each  modality  in each  patient,  and the sensitivity  rate with each  modality.   The study  
population  will include  any patient  under  the age of [ADDRESS_340666] biopsy  and 
intra-operative  ICG transdermal  lymphography,  thereby  [CONTACT_279128]/her  
own control.   However,  the surgeon  will be blinded  to the TcL results  until after the ICG 
transdermal  lymphography  results  have been  recorded,  in order  to directly  evaluate  the 
detection  rate of the ICG.  Given  the estimated  sample  size of [ADDRESS_340667] biopsies  on patient  under  30 years  of age of 10 per year at MSK and 17 patients   
from the two collaborating  institutions,  this study  will take approximately  4 years  to complete.

2.1 OBJECTIVES  AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
 
• Primary  Objective  
o Show  that the SLN detection  rate using  ICG-guided  transdermal  
lymphography  is not inferior  to that of TcL in pediatric  solid tumors  
• Secondary  Objectives  
o Safety  of ICG injection  
o Compare  the total number  of ICG+  and TcL+  SLNs  harvested  in each  patient  
o Compare  the percent  of patients  who have a pathologically  positive  SLN 
identified  with each  technique  (sensitivity  rate)

at the site, but its use has decreased  because  of frequent  hypersensitivity  reactions  (1,2).  
 
The standard  procedure  for SLN biopsy  includes  TcL the morning  of or day prior to surgery.  
Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_279107];  the scans  identify  which  lymph  node  basin  contains  the SLN and how many  SLNs  
there  are (average  1-2). In the unlikely  event  (<3%)  that mappi[INVESTIGATOR_279108], the patient  is brought  
back 2-[ADDRESS_340670]  point (point  with the highest  
gamma  count)  on the skin overlying  the lymph  node  basin  and an incision  is made.   The 
gamma  probe  and blunt dissection  are then used  to find the hot node  and it is then resected.  
Given  the lack of specificity  and resolution  using  the gamma  probe  this can result  in 
significant  time and dissection.  All the hot (gamma  probe  positive)  nodes  are removed  and 
the procedure  is considered  complete  when  the baseline  gamma  count  of the basin  is <10%  
of the gamma  count  of the hottest  node.  
 
While  technetium  mappi[INVESTIGATOR_279109],  it has several  disadvantages.  First,  it exposes  a child  
to a small  amount  of radiation.  Although  the radiation  dose  is within  the range  of natural  
background  radiation,  it adds to the patient’s  cumulative  radiation  exposure.  Second,  while  
the gamma  probes  used  to identify  the SLN intra-operatively  are sensitive,   they are not 
specific,  have poor resolution,  and do not allow  for direct  visualization  during  dissection.   The 
inherent  error in the probes  and the difficulty  discerning  lymph  tissue  from the surrounding  fat 
can make  it difficult  to identify  small  SLNs.   This disadvantage  led to the addition  of blue dye 
to the SLN procedure,  but its use has been  limited  by [CONTACT_279129]. Third,  the TcL procedure  requires  several  hours  to complete,  so most  patients  spend  an 
additional  day in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_279110].  Last,  four injections  of 
technetium  must  be given  around  the tumor  site without  sedation,  which  can be difficult  in the 
pediatric  population.

IRB Number: 16 -1003 A(2)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_340671] mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  (3-6).  One of the first 
groups  of investigators  to exploit  these  attributes  of ICG was Memorial  Sloan  Kettering’s  
Gynecologic  Oncology  Service.   Jewell  et al. published  an analysis  of a patient  series  in 
2014  showing  a 95% detection  rate for ICG in uterine  and cervical  cancer  SLN biopsy  (3).  In 
2015,  Imboden  et al. published  results  of their study  comparing  ICG to blue dye, which  
demonstrated  bilateral  SLN detection  rates  of 95.5 and 61%,  respectively  (4). Xiong  et al. 
performed  a meta -analysis  of ICG SLN data in 2014  and found  a pooled  detection  rate of 
96% (5). ICG also allows  for direct  transcutaneous  visualization  and transdermal  
lymphography  using  near-infrared  cameras.  Wishart  et al. showed  a 100%  detection  rate for 
ICG transdermal  lymphography  in early breast  cancer  SLN biopsy  (6).  If ICG is shown  to be 
non-inferior  to TCL for the mappi[INVESTIGATOR_279111],  then 
the pain, radiation  exposure,  and time expenditure  required  for TcL could  be eliminated.

been  recorded,  the surgeon  will be unblinded  to the TcL mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007].   All ICG-positive  and TcL- 
positive  nodes  will be removed  and complete  excision  will be confirmed  by [CONTACT_90169]-operative  
near-infrared  imaging  and gamma  probe  evaluation.  Thus,  in this trial each  patient  will serve  
as his/her  own control.  If TcL fails, no repeat  TcL will be perfomed,  the SLN biopsy  will be 
done  with ICG alone,  and the patient  will be recorded  as a failure  of TcL (i.e. decreasing  the 
detection  rate for TcL).   If ICG mappi[INVESTIGATOR_279108], the TcL results  will be used  to perform  SLN 
biopsy  and the patient  will be considered  a failure  of ICG (i.e. decreasing  the detection  rate 
for ICG).  In the <1% of patients  that fail both TcL and ICG, no SLN biopsy  will be performed  
and the patient  will be recorded  as a failure  of both TcL and ICG . These  patients  will still 
contribute  data to the primary  endpoint  (i.e. decreasing  the detection  rate for both modalities)  
and safety  data,  but will not contribute  to the other  secondary  aims.  Approximately  [ADDRESS_340673] detection  rate, will be compared  between  ICG-guided  
transdermal  lymphography  and TcL to determine  non-inferiority  of ICG in this clinical  
application.  Secondary  outcomes  include  the safety  of ICG in this clinical  scenario,  
comparisons  of the total number  of excised  nodes  identified  with each  detection  method  in 
each  patients,  and the sensitivity  rate (percent  of patients  with a pathologically  positive  SLN)  
for each  technique.

4.3 Intervention  
 
On the day of or the day before  the scheduled  OR procedure,  the patient  will undergo  TcL, 
but the surgeon  will be blinded  to the results  preoperatively.    On the day of surgery,  4 cc of 
1.25 mg/mL  ICG will be injected  at 4 points  directly  surrounding  the tumor  site (1cc per point,  
depth  will vary with position  of the tumor)  after the patient  is under  anesthesia.   Transdermal  
lymphography  and analysis  of all possible  draining  nodal  basins  will then be performed  using  
a near-infrared  camera  in real time.  ICG mappi[INVESTIGATOR_279112]  5min.   If  
the SLN cannot  be identified  20min  after ICG injection,  it will be considered  a failure  of ICG, 
and the TcL results will  be used  to perform  the SLN biopsy.  If the ICG does map and a SLN  
is identified,  the transdermal  lymphography  results  will be recorded  and the surgeon  will be 
unblinded  to the TCL results.  All fluorescent  lymph  nodes  will then be resected  using  the 
near-infrared  camera.   After all ICG-positive  nodes  have been  resected,  but before  closure,  
gamma  probes  will be used  intraoperatively  to ensure  all TcL-positive  SLNs  have been  
removed.   As is standard  with TcL SLN biopsy  any activity  in the nodal  bed <10%  of the 
“hottest”  node  removed  will be considered  background.   This will act as the threshold  for all 
TcL positive  nodes  being  removed.   The detection  rates  for each  tracer,  ICG and TcL 
positivity  for every  node  removed,  and number  of ICG and TcL positive  nodes  per patient  will 
be recorded.   If TcL fails, no repeat  TcL will be perfomed,  the SLN biopsy  will be done  with 
ICG alone,  and the patient  will be recorded  as a failure  of TcL (i.e. decreasing  the detection  
rate for TcL).  If ICG mappi[INVESTIGATOR_279108], the TcL results will  be used  to perform  SLN biopsy  and  
the patient  will be considered  a failure  of ICG (i.e. decreasing  the detection  rate for ICG).  In 
the <1% of patients  that fail both TcL and ICG, no SLN biopsy  will be performed  and the 
patient  will be recorded  as a failure  of both TcL and ICG with respect  to detection  rate. These  
patients  will still contribute  data to the primary  endpoint  (i.e. decreasing  the detection  rate for 
both modalities)  and safety  data,  but will not contribute  to the other  secondary  aims.  
 
5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC  AGENTS  
 
ICG is an FDA-approved  drug for IV, subcutaneous,  and topi[INVESTIGATOR_175647]. Safety  and  
effectiveness  of this agent  in pediatric  patients  have been  established  (8-10). ICG is currently  
used  at MSK for viability  and perfusion  analysis  in colorectal  and plastic  surgery  as well as 
SLN identification  in gynecologic  cancer.  It is supplied  in a kit with sterile  covers  for the near- 
infrared  camera  and the agent  is easily  diluted  to the goal concentration  of 1.25mg/mL  prior 
to injection.

14.0 BIOSTATISTICS 
Primary  objective  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 16 -1003 A(2)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_340684]  of care by a particular  margin  decided  upon  using  prior knowledge  of the 
external  (to the trial) advantages  of the new method.   They  are extremely  useful  in rare 
conditions  and when  comparing  a new test to a standard  of care with a very high success  
rate.  Both TcL and ICG have a success  rate of 95% and pediatric  solid tumors  requiring  SLN 
biopsy  are rare.  In order  to perform  a standard  superiority  study  comparing  ICG to TcL, 
thousands  of patients  would  be necessary,  which  is not clinically  feasible.   As described  
above,  from the clinical  standpoint,  ICG is superior  to TcL for patient  care because  it 
provides  much  more  accurate  visualization  of SLNs  during  biopsy,  does not expose  the 
patient  to radiation,  does not require  painful  injections  without  sedation,  and does not require  
additional  time commitments  from the patient  and family.   The non-inferiority  margin  was, 
therefore,  set at 10% using  this clinical  knowledge.  Using  an alpha  level of 0.[ADDRESS_340685] in 95% of cases,  the calculated  N per 
group  for paired  values  is 59. Because  each  patient  serves  as his/her  own control,  these  
tests  are considered  “paired”  values.   Adjustment  to the non-inferiority  study  statistics  has 
been  described  by [CONTACT_279131] (7). Given  that each  of our patients  will be evaluated  with both 
TcL and ICG, each  case  counts  towards  both groups  and our total N = 59. Given  the rate of 
15-[ADDRESS_340686] biopsies  per year at our institution,  patient  accrual  should  be completed  
within  approximately  4 years.  
 
The primary  outcome  of this study  is the detection  rate (% of patients  in whom  a SLN 
is identified)  for ICG and TcL. These  percentages  will be compared  using  a non-inferiority  
comparison  for matched  pair data as described  above.   In the unlikely  event  that SLNs  are 
not found  with either  modality,  these  patients  will still contribute  data to the primary  endpoint  
(i.e. decreasing  the detection  rate for both modalities)  and safety  data,  but will not contribute  
to the other  secondary  aims.  
Secondary  objectives  
 
Safety  will be analyzed  with descriptive  statistics  of the number  and type of adverse  
reactions  encountered  (per CTCAE  guidelines).  
The number  of nodes  identified  by [CONTACT_279132]  a paired  Wilcoxon  
signed -rank test. 
 
To evaluate  sensitivity,  the percent  of patients  in whom  a SLN is found  to contain  tumor  on 
pathology  using  each  technique  will be compared  with McNemar’s  test for matched  pair data. 
 
Finally,  to determine  whether  the intensity  of each  node  is associated  with pathologic  
positivity,  a logistic  regression  model  will be fit with pathologic  positivity  as the outcome  and 
intensity  as the predictor,  and robust  standard  errors  will account  for correlation  among  
multiple  nodes  per patient.  This will be done  separately  for ICG and TcL intensity.

Data will be managed  through  REDCap  (Research  Electronic  Data Capture),  a data 
management  software  system  supported  by [CONTACT_279136].  
Members  of the Clinical  Research  Administration  supporting  the REDCap  software  will have 
access to the data for the purpose  of ensuring  the proper  functioning  of the database  and the 
overall  software  system.  REDCap  is a tool for the creation  of customized,  secure  data 
management  systems  including  web-based  data entry  forms,  reporting  tools,  and a full array  
of security  features  including  user and group  based  privileges  with a full audit trail of data 
manipulation  and export  procedures.  REDCap  is maintained  on MSK -owned  servers  that are 
kept in a locked  server  room  with appropriate  environmental  modifications  (e.g.,  special  air 
conditioning),  supported  by [CONTACT_279137],  and backed  up nightly  with some  
backup  tapes  stored  off-site. All connections  to REDCap  utilize  encrypted  (SSL -based)  
connections.  Nationally,   the REDCap  software  is developed,  enhanced,  and supported  
through  a multi-institutional  consortium  led by [CONTACT_279138].  REDCap  will 
only be used  for the housing  of survey  data.  Use of REDCap  has been  approved  by [CONTACT_279139]’s  manager  of IT Systems  and by [CONTACT_279140].

16.2 Quality Assurance 
 
Completeness  of registration  data will be monitored  by [CONTACT_279142] a 
regular  basis.  Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  missing  data and 
inconsistencies.  Accrual  rates,  and the extent  and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow -up, will 
be monitored  periodically  throughout  the study.  Potential  problems  will be brought  to the 
attention  of the study  team  for discussion  and action.  Random -sample  data quality  and 
protocol  compliance  audits  will be conducted  by [CONTACT_279143] a minimum  of twice  per 
year,  or more  frequently  if indicated.  
16.2.1  Quality Assurance for Participating Sites 
 
Each  site accruing  participants  to this protocol  will be audited  by [CONTACT_279144],  data verification  and source  documentation.

IRB Number: 16 -1003 A(2)  
Approval date: 27 -Aug-2019  
Page  14 of 21  
  
 
Audits  will be conducted  annually  during  the study  (or more  frequently  if indicated)  and at the 
end or closeout  of the trial. Ideally  the first audit will occur  shortly  after the first patients  are 
enrolled.  The number  of participants  audited  will be determined  by [CONTACT_279145].  Each  audit will be summarized  and a final report  will be sent to the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_279119]  30 days of the audit.  
16.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center  
were  approved  by [CONTACT_40137]  2001.   The plans  address  the 
new policies  set forth by [CONTACT_28643]  “Policy  of the National  Cancer  
Institute  for Data and Safety  Monitoring  of Clinical Trials”  which  can be found  
at:  http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/condu cting/dsm -guidelines  /page 1.   The DSM Plans at 
MSKCC  were  established  and are monitored  by [CONTACT_40138].   The 
MSKCC  Data and Safety  Monitoring  Plans  can be found  on the MSKCC  Intranet  at:  
http://inside2/clinresearch/Documents/MSKCC%20Data%20and%20Safety%20Monitoring%   
20Plans.pdf  
 
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by [CONTACT_46463],  safety  
and quality.  There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  
monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff 
education  on clinical  research  QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus 
there  are two institutional  committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our 
clinical  trials programs.  The committees:  Data and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for 
Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the Data and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB) for Phase  III 
clinical  trials,  report  to the Center’s  Research  Counci l and Institutional  Review  Board.  
 
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each  protocol  will be assessed  for its 
level of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  
in-house  sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) will be addressed  
and the monitoring  procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  activation.  
 
16.[ADDRESS_340690]/Privacy  Board  (IRB/PB).  There  will be one protocol  
document  and each  participating  site will utilize  that document.  
 
The following  documents  must  be provided  to MSK before  the participating  site can be 
initiated  and begin  enrolling  participants:  
• Participating  Site IRB approval(s)  for the protocol,  appendices,  informed  consent  form 
and HIPAA  authorization  
• Participating  Site IRB approved  informed  consent  form 
• Participating  Site IRB’s  Federal  Wide  Assurance  (FWA)  number  and OHRP  Registration

with Federal  Regulations  as detailed  in 21CFR50.  The investigator  is responsible  for 
obtaining  written  informed  consent  from potential  patients  or legal guardian  before   
performing  any trial tests  or assessments required  by [CONTACT_760].  A copy of the signed  
document  will be given  to the patient  or legal guardian  , and the original  will be retained  by 
[CONTACT_279148]/her  copy of the record  forms.  
 
Given  the nature  of these  tumors,  most  patients  will be children,  adolescents,  and young  
adults.   Patients  of both sexes  and all racial/ethnic  backgrounds  are eligible  for this study.  
Alternative  treatments  are available  and will be discussed  with the patient  or legal guardian.  
 
Benefits:  This study  is not expected  to help treat the cancer,  but it may lead to removal  of 
extra  lymph  nodes  for analysis.  What  we learn  from this study  may help patients  in the future.  
 
Risks:  The potential  risks of this therapy  as described  in section  11 of this protocol  may 
outweigh  the potential  benefits  in an individual  patient.  The potential  risks are related  to the 
adverse  effects  which  could  be induced  by [CONTACT_279149]. 
 
Patients  or their legal guardians  will be charged  for the costs  for all routine  visits,  treatment,  
and non-research  testing  related  to the cancer.  Patients  will not be charged  for the ICG dye, 
the preparation,  or for use of the specialized  camera  used  as part of the study.

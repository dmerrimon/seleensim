3 Background /Rationale  & Purpose  
 
3.1 Background Information  
 
Vitamin D deficien cy has been a worldwide health problem for over a century, now affecting over 1 
billion people on this planet1. Although technology is drastically advancing, we still are unable to put an 
end to this he alth emergency.  
 
Vitamin D can be introduced in the body in two ways, 1) via diet and 2) through the sun. Few foods 
naturally contain vitamin D (either D 2 or D 3)2 such as oily fish. For instance  fresh, wild salmon (3.5oz or 
100g) has between 600 -1000 IU of vitamin D 3. Canned tuna (3.6oz or 102 g) has about [ADDRESS_645769] about 20 IU of vitamin D 2 or 
vitamin D 3 2. There are some fortified foods that also contain vitamin D; fortified milk and fortifi ed 
orange juice each has about 100 IU/8 oz of vitamin D 3. Some cereals, such as Quaker Oatmeal has as 
much as 40 IU vitamin D/cup.3 Margarine has about 60 IU of vitamin D/tablespoon.3 In a study that 
looked at the plasma levels of 25(OH)D [ADDRESS_645770] fish eaters and non -fish eaters ( vegans and 
vegetarians), those who did not consume fish had lower levels of 25(OH)D 3 in both the summer months 
(20%) and winter months (38%) .4 Thus the consumption of fish in the diet is critical in maintaining 
vitamin D status throughout the year, especially during the winter months.  
 
When assessing the optimal dietary intake of vitamin D, there might be some controversy as to which 
guideline to follow. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) issued guidelines to maintain adequate serum 
25(OH)D levels above 20 ng/mL.5 The Endocrine Society’s guidelines reflect the needs to treat and 
prevent vitamin D deficiency and maintain a 25(OH)D status above  30 ng/mL.[ADDRESS_645771] to 
consume a significant amount of fish and fortified food products to meet  the above recommendations. 
Thus it is critical that we incorporate sun exposure into our everyday lives, and/or take vitamin D 
supplements.  
 
When ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation (wavelength of 290 -320 nm) from the sun is absorbed into the skin, it 
converts  7-DHC, which is predominantly located in the stratum spi[INVESTIGATOR_96216]7, to 
previtamin D 3, which is thermodynamically unstable. Over several hours it isomerizes into vitamin D 3.[ADDRESS_645772] oxylase to become 25 -hydroxyvitaminD (25(OH)D), which is the 
major circulating form of vitamin D.8-9 25(OH)D is hydroxylated again in the kidneys by 1alpha -
hydroxylase to become 1,25 -dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH) 2D), which i s the active form of vitamin D . 
When calcium levels are too high, 24 -hydroxylase activity increases, hydroxylating C24 and making, 
24,25 -Dihydroxyvitamin D (24,25(OH) 2D) and 1,24,25 -trihydroxyvitamin D (1,24,25 -(OH) 3D). This step 
begins the process of the degradation of both metabolites into inactive water soluble metabolites that 
 
Page 5 of 22 
\\DC - 760509/000001 - 15602675 v1   can be excreted in the bile. The ability to maintain 25(OH)D levels via sun exposure is influenced by [CONTACT_96232].10 The zenith angle is defined as the oblique angle between the sun’s rays and 
the earth’s surface. The time of day,  season, and latitude on the earth’s surface all affect the zenith 
angle. Above 37  latitude during the months of November through February, there is a significant 
decrease in the amount of UVB photons hitting the earth’s surface, as much as 80% -100% depen ding on 
latitude 11. Thus, for those living in areas at a zenith angle incompatible for producing vitamin D in the 
winter, they need to obtain their vitamin D via supplements and/or food containing or fortified with 
vitamin D.  
 
Those living a bove 37 latitude during the months of November through February could also rely on 
artificial UVB light sources such as the Sperti lamp or  UVB emitting LEDs . These lights permit the skin to 
convert 7-dehydro cholesterol into vitamin D allowing the body to maintain adequate vitamin D levels 
while avoiding exposure to the sun. In particular,  these lights are resourceful to those having fat 
malabsorption disorders such as Crohn’s  disease, cystic fibrosis, and/or gastric by[CONTACT_6476]. For these 
individuals who are unable to absorb vitamin D from the diet, exposure to UVB is the primary way of 
maintaining an adequate vitamin D status.  
 
UVB phototherapy is a potential solution to the problem. Importantly, narrowband UVB ( NB-UVB) 
phototherapy can be safely used.  Long -term studies to date do not indicate a significantly increased risk 
of skin cancer in an age - and sex -matched control population who have not received UVB phototherapy. 
20-24 In a 2005 literature review, a sea rch from 1966 to June 2002 was conducted.  Eleven studies 
involving about 3400 subjects  (including those with >300 lifetime treatments) were included. Except for 
1 Finnish study, all studies showed no increased skin cancer risk with UVB phototherapy.25 In a 2012 
systematic literature review examining NB -UVB and risk of skin cancer, four stud ies followed a total of 
6,385 subjects . None of the four studies found an increased risk of skin cancer in psoriasis subjects  
treated with NBUVB. 26 The above studies were mostly in Caucasians  with skin types I -III. In a 2011 study 
of 445 Koreans (skin typ e III-V) treated with NB -UVB, no melanoma cases were reported within the 
mean follow -up period of 34.[ADDRESS_645773] study on the safety of vitiligo treatment ever conducted, a 2020 retrospective 
cohort enrolled 60,321 subjects  with vitiligo. 28 Subjects  were classified into 5 groups: 0 sessions of NB -
UVB; 1 -49 sessions; 50 -99 sessions; 100 -199 sessions; and ≥[ADDRESS_645774] 500 sessions of NB -UVB phototherapy h ad no 
greater risk of skin cancer than the subjects  who did not undergo NB -UVB phototherapy at all.  
 
Solius has created The Solius Photobiologic System (SPS) , which  is an experiential device that allows a 
user to receive a calibrated and calculated dose of vitamin D using wavelengths of UV light that facilitate 
the body’s endogenous production of vitamin D and a variety of biologically controlled feedback 
mechanisms.  The output of SPS is very similar to a NB -UVB device, but without the wavelength s that are 
less effective in endogenous vitamin D production.  Exposure of individuals with varying skin types to 
these lights will enable us to observe the effect of artifici al UVR   exposure in creating vitamin D in 
individuals with varying shades of skin color. The benefit of this lamp will allow individuals who live in 
northern locations or individuals with malabsorption problems to create vitamin D.

\\DC - 760509/[ADDRESS_645775] study was a pi[INVESTIGATOR_96217] D 
process. The second study was a randomized non-inferiority study  comparing the SOLIUS device to oral 
vitamin D supplements.  
In a prospective cohort study (QR-TRP-002) , six healthy adults with Fitzpatrick skin types I, II , and III were 
exposed to a 0.75 minimal erythemal dose (MED) of UVB radiation  to approximately 75% of their body 
surface area once per week for 4 weeks. The i ndividual dose was determined with Fitzpatrick skin 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], followed by [CONTACT_96233] 10 successively increasing durations 
of exposure to UVB . The subjects had a significant increase in mean 25(OH)D from 22.8 ± 13.9 ng/ml to 
27.2 ± 12.0 ng/ml (P<0.05), representing a 19% increase over baseline after 4 weekly UVB exposures. No 
adverse events occurred.  
Another study was performed on military personn el. Military personnel are at high risk for low vitamin D 
status which is common in individuals who regularly perform extreme physical exertion, particularly in 
combination with periods of psychological stress, inadequate nutrition, and sleep disruption. A total of 
98 participants enrolled in the study; 10 (10.2%) either dropped out or were removed after enrollment. 
The final sample included 45 participants in the supplement  and 43 in the phototherapy group. There 
were no between group differences noted bas ed on age or gender distribution (P=0.06). There were also 
no between group differences observed with respect to race / ethnicity, Fitzpatrick skin type, birth 
location with respect to 37th parallel, prior diagnoses of vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D 
suppl ementation history, stress fractures, or family history of bone disorders, and total number of hours 
per week of sun exposure, with P > 0.05 for these groups.  
The median serum 25(OH)D levels at baseline for the supplement and phototherapy  were 25.0 ng/mL 
(IQR 21.0 –32.0) and 28.0 ng/mL (IQR 22.0 –35.0), respectively. By [CONTACT_43397], the phototherapy group  
showed significantly higher levels of serum 25(OH)D than the supplement group  (P=0.01, ŋ2=0.08) with 
a median level of 25.5 ng/mL (IQR 21.0 –29.8) compared to a median level of 30.0 ng/mL (IQR 25.8 -37.0) 
for the phototherapy group . By [CONTACT_96234] -month follow up the two groups again showed a slight 
difference in serum 25(OH)D levels wi th higher levels in the phototherapy group  (P=0.04, ŋ2=0.05).  At 
this timepoint the supplement group had decreased from baseline to median levels of 21.0 ng/mL (IQR 
17.0 -30.0) and phototherapy returned to baseline (m edian 27.0 ng/mL, IQR 22.0 -32.5)  (suppl ementary 
documents) . 
With suboptimal intake of key nutrients like calcium and vitamin D, historically low compliance with 
taking pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], and low sun exposure, limited potential to optimize serum 25(OH)D continues to pose a 
threat to physical and mental heal th, disease prevention, and resilience so critical to individual wellness 
and readiness. At a time when self -care measures are highly valued for health promotion, programmed 
UVB photobiologic therapy, available as a kiosk in the community, appears to be a safe, efficacious 
alternative to oral vitamin D supplementation.  
 
As discussed above, there is an ever growing need to improve the vitamin D status of the global 
population. Many individuals who live above 37  latitude and/or have malabsorption problems wi ll 
greatly benefit from an artificial light source to combat their increased risk for vitamin D deficiency. The 
purpose of this study is to observe the effects of exposure of individuals of varying shades of skin color

used to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Solius Photobiologic system for improvement of vitamin 
D status.  
 
4 Objectives  
 
4.1 Study endpoint  
 
The end point s are to gain experience in using this device to determine if exposure to UVB generated by 
[CONTACT_501372] D status.  
 
Study Outcome Measures  
 
Improvement of serum levels of 25(OH)D will be measured by 25(OH)D analysis at baseline,  
prior to the intervention (week 6)  and the end of the study.   Serum 25(OH)D levels 
measurement will be performed by [CONTACT_393914] . 
 
4.1.1 Endpoint Measure s 
 
1. At each visit, the subjects will be asked to report any adverse events and any skin changes.  
These adverse events will be tabulated and reported at the study completion.  
2. Blood samples will be obtained from all subjects at baseline ( prior to the first titration, week 2 ),  
prior to the intervention (week 6)  and end of the study . Blood sample s will be sent  to the Quest 
Diagnostics  or to the [LOCATION_011] Medical Center’s clinical laboratory  for determining the serum 
25(OH)D  levels.

\\DC - 760509/000001 - 15602675 v1   5 Study Design  
 
This is a  pi[INVESTIGATOR_501366] 25(OH)D  in a vitamin D deficient/insufficient  adult 
population . We will make our best effort to recruit  individuals with different  Fitzpatrick skin types.  The 
study will be conducted at [LOCATION_011] University after it is approved by [CONTACT_96235]’s Institutional 
Review Board.  The use of a single location will keep uniform natural UVB exposure of the s tudy as opposed 
to multiple geographic locations what would create a wide variety of natural exposures to UVB and result 
in a less uniform impact of this natural exposure in both study arm.  
 
Table 1.  The below guidelines will be used to make this distinction:  
 
Table 1: Fitzpatrick Skin Types  
Skin 
type Typi[INVESTIGATOR_96218]  
I Pale white skin, blue/green eyes, blond/red  hair Always burns, does not tan  
II Fair skin, blue eyes  Burns easily, tans poorly  
III Darker white skin  Tans after initial burn  
IV Light brown skin  Burns minimally, tans easily  
V Brown skin  Rarely burns, tans darkly easily  
VI Dark brown or black skin  Never burns, always tans darkly  
 
 
Each subject will be categorized into one of [ADDRESS_645778] skin tone  for subgroup 
analysis.   
 
A total of 14 adult subjects with 5 skin types groups (I, II, III, IV and V/ VI) will be enrolled for vitamin D 
deficiency/ insufficiency screening.  The screening  test for 25(OH)D will be performed by [CONTACT_501373] 9 of 22 
\\DC - 760509/000001 - 15602675 v1   Medical Center’s clinical laboratory which is able to perform the test within [ADDRESS_645779] 
80% of the population in the [LOCATION_011] area has a level of 25(OH)D below 30 ng/ml. Thus, we expect to  enroll 
approximately [ADDRESS_645780] titration (week 2) , prior to the intervention (week 6) 
and end of the study . The b lood sample s will be sent  to Quest  Diagnostics  or the [LOCATION_011] Medical 
Center’s clinical laboratory  for determining  the serum 25(OH)D  levels. The study design is summarized in  
Table 2 .

6 Potential Risks and Benefits  
 
6.1 Risks  
 
The main acute adverse effects of  narrowband UVB  (NB-UVB ) are erythema and induction of 
photosensitivity diseases, such as polymorphic light eruption (PLE). Although the risk of erythemal 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_96220]14,15, this can be minimized by [CONTACT_96239] a 
baseline minimal eryth ema dose (MED) and establishing treatment protocols based on an individual's 
MED16. This also allows any unsuspected abnormal photosensitivity diseases to be detected, in particular 
solar urticaria or chronic actinic dermatitis (CAD). Induction of PLE may occur during a treatment course 
but generally can be accommodated via dose adjustments and judicious use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_11977], 
without the need to stop NB -UVB17. Other uncommon side -effects, such as psoriatic lesional blistering, 
occasionally occur bu t generally treatment is very well -tolerated18,19.  
 
Overexposure to our artificial UVB source may incur similar symptoms to a mild sunburn (slight reddish 
coloration to the skin). The Solius Photobiological System was designed to minimize total UV B exposure 
to minimize the potential for sunburn.  To make sure subjects do not develop redness  (erythema)  or 
psoriatic lesional blistering , the exposure will set for the lamp to 60% or 0.60 of the minimal erythemal 
dose (MED) for each individuals’ skin type . 
 
Over exposure to the UVB to the eyes may cause photokeratitis.  
 
To prevent the overexposure, the subject’s dosage will be determined during titration period. Eye 
protection will be provided to the subjects before each treatment. The device software wil l require 
subject confirmation that is in place before treatment can be delivered.  
As the appropriate doses are individualized to the subject, to establish the correct dose, each subject 
will complete a titration period of up to 5 weeks.  The titration per iod will start with an erythemally 
weighted dose of 10.53 mJ/cm2 to 43.07 mJ/cm2 (depending on skin type) and increase by 26 – 36% Activity  Baseline

on skin type) or the subject s hows a skin reaction.  This dose will be the subject’s dosage.   
 
The subject’s dosage will be administered under conditions of full -body exposure  (males in swimming 
trunk s or briefs and females in bikini or bra and panties)  of 0.6 minimal erythemal dose (MED) once per 
week  for [ADDRESS_645781] their health, welfare, or decision to stay in this 
study. Any and all side effects reported will be recorded in the sub jects' file in the study binder. Subjects 
will be instructed to call the study staff or PI [INVESTIGATOR_501367]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_501368]. After the determination , all samples will be 
de-identif ied. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_501369]. We have a plan to protect subject  privacy and confidentiality, which is explained in the 
plan to protect subject  privacy and confidentiality in the data section.  
 
Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency is common in adults due to  an inadequate dietary intake of 
vitamin D  and or inadequate sun exposure .  Chronic vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency can lead to  
bone  loss resulting in increased risk of fracture later in life.  Chronic vitamin D deficiency can also cause 
a mineralization defect of the skeleton resulting in osteomalacia.   Shor t term  (10 weeks ) vitamin D 
deficiency and insufficiency is not associated with  significant bone loss or osteomalacia. Therefore , the 
participants are at no increased risk  for fracture or osteomalacia.  At the termination of this study those 
participants will be encouraged to take a vitamin D supplement along the guidelines recommended by 
[CONTACT_96240] D deficiency and insufficiency.    
 
Chronic excessive exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet radiation for prolonged periods of time, in years or 
decades, can increase risk for nonmelanoma skin cancer.  To minimize the risk the subjects will be 22 
years and older and will be exposed to suberyth emal doses of UVB radiation for the duration of the 
study  
 
6.2 Potential Benefits  
 
The study participants may receive no benefit. However, possible benefits include an increase in vitamin 
D status or resolution of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency. However, subjects may not receive any 
benefit.  The subjects’ being in the study may help the investigators evaluate whether the SoliusONE 
device is safe and effective in increasing blood levels of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D and treating vitamin D 
deficiency/insufficiency.  Subjects will not be responsible for any research related costs. They will receive 
compensation in each of their visit, which is shown below. Parking vouchers  or transportation cost  are 
available for each visit.

6.3 Analysis of Ris ks in R elation to Benefits  
 
Highly trained professionals will be performing the blood draws which is likely to be  a chance of risk. The 
adverse skin reaction from the Solius Photobiological System such as skin erythema and pruritus is a 
possible risk  in this study . However,  this study will expose the participants to a relatively low intensity of 
UVB  (0.6 MED), so the risk of adverse reaction is minimal . All the  participants will be asked for their 
willingness to receive the intervention at every exposure and  will be question ed and examined for any 
potential adverse reaction due to the intervention . If any significant adverse reaction is detected, the 
intervention will immediately stop and the affected participant will receive immediate medical 
attention. Significant adverse r eactions include photokeratitis, moderate to severe skin tenderness, 
itchness and tightening, skin blistering, or bruising or tearing of skin. The risks of breach of 
confidentiality are highly unlikely, and therefore benefits will greatly outweigh the risk s.

8 Study Intervention  
 
Subjects (n=10)  will be exposed to the Solius Photobiological System  which includes exposure to visible 
purple LEDs and invisible UVB radiation.  The study intervention will involve an investigational  UVB 
emitting  device , The Solius Photobiologic System created by [CONTACT_96244] . The Solius Photobiological System 
emits  UVB .  To make sure subjects do not develop redness, the exposure will set for the lamp to 60% or 
0.60 of the minimal erythemal dose (MED) for each individual’s  skin type.  
 
As the appropriate doses are individualized to the subject, to establish the correct dose, each subject 
will complete a titration period of up to 5 weeks.  The titration period will start with an erythemal 
weighted dose of 10.53 mJ/cm2 to 43.07 mJ /cm2 (depending on skin type) and increase by 26 – 36% 
each step until a maximum erythemal weighted dose of 34.88 mJ/cm2 – 109.33 mJ/cm2 (depending on 
skin type) or the subject shows a skin reaction.  This dose will be the subject’s dosage.   
 
The device w ill have a strip of purple  LEDs installed  inside  the light towers. Both UV lamps and purple  
LEDs will turn on during the treatment. According to a previous study by [CONTACT_96245]  43 subjects  were 
exposed to a 0.6 MED , the stimulation of cutaneous vitamin D and subsequent  increase in serum 
concentrations of  25(OH)D  from phototherapy was compared to the effect of a Recommended Daily 
Allowance (RDA) based dose of [ADDRESS_645787] on  25(OH)D s erum 
concentration .  
 
[ADDRESS_645788] will be asked about their medical history and inclusion/exclusion 
criteria. For the subjects who are determined to be eligible, they will be assigned with a study ID and 
their answers to the questions will be documented in the study binder. Eligible subject’s contact 
[CONTACT_501374]. For individuals with screening failure, 
no answer or identifiable information will be retained.  
 
Eligible subjects be scheduled for  their first visit to [LOCATION_011] University Medical Center’s General Clinical 
Research Unit at [ADDRESS_645789] 
during the process.  We will ask t he subjects to read and ask any questions in regards to the screening 
 
Page 14 of 22 
\\DC - 760509/[ADDRESS_645790] on women of child bearing potential, perform a 25(OH) D blood screen, and 
conduct our study experiment . Researchers will document that consent was given in our consent form 
log sheet where (s)he will need to sign and date that informed consent was given and that the subject 
received a copy of the ICF.   
 
Approximately  14 adult subjects with 5 skin types groups (I, II, III, IV and V/ VI) will be enrolled for 
vitamin D deficiency/ insufficiency screening. We expect at least 80% of the population in the [LOCATION_011] 
area has a level of 25(OH)D below 30 ng/ml. Thus, we will enroll approximately [ADDRESS_645791] titration (week 2) , prior to the intervention (week 6) and 
end of the study . The blood samples  for the screening will be performed by [CONTACT_501375] p rovide the test result within [ADDRESS_645792] Diagnostics for determining the 
serum 25(OH)D levels. The study design is summarized in Table 2.  
 
Each subject will be advised to come in for  five titration visits.  The purpose of these visits to establish 
the correct UVB dose in the SoliusONE device .  At these visits, each subject will be asked  questions 
about consumption of vitamin D, sun exposure, a nd whether he/she has had any adverse changes in 
his/her health .  After the titration visit, each subject will  complete a 4-week course of SoliusONE 
treatment.  During each titration/ treatment  session,  the study personnel will record subject’s 
information in the application that is installed in the study personnel’s smartphone. The information to 
be recorded include subject ID, age and sex. This allows the software to link to database and create user 
profiles for dosing. None of the identifiable information  will be recorded in the application. Then, each 
subject will stand in the SoliusONE device  while exposed to UVB light. Each subject wil l be asked to wear 
a swimsuit, swimming trunk s (for male s) or bikini (for female s) while being exposed to UVB in the 
device.  The device is large enough so that the participant is able to remove their clothing and to hang it 
up on a hook that is provided in the device.  If they are wearing their bathing suit , they will then be 
exposed to the UVB  light .  If they have brought their bathing suit with them , they will be able to put it on 
in the device and then be exposed to the UVB  light .  They then have the option of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_501370] .  For those who either do not want to wear a bathing suit under their clothing 
or have forgot to bring their bathing suit th en they will have the option of being exposed to the UVB  in 
their underwear  (males in their underwear shorts and females in their panties and bra ). Each session will 
take approximately 2-[ADDRESS_645793]’s  skin type group (lighter skin type groups 
 
Page 15 of 22 
\\DC - 760509/000001 - 15602675 v1   require less treatment time). Before and after each treatment, the device  will be cleaned using 
disinfectant to ensure proper  hygiene.  
 
Blood samples will be obtained from all subjects at baseline  (prior to the first titration, week 2) , prior to 
the intervention (week 6) and end of the study . Blood sample s will be sent  to Quest  Diagnostics  for 
determining  the serum 25(OH)D levels. The study design summarized in Table [ADDRESS_645794] needs  to end his/her regimen early they will be able to do so, with no change to the study 
procedure. We will require a final blood sample  collection  from the study subject prior to his/her 
removal.  
 
We anticipate the entire study will take [ADDRESS_645795]’s 
involvement will last 10 weeks from screening  to completion  include one week for screening, 5 weeks 
for titration , 4 weeks for treatment .  
 
10 Assessment of Safety  and Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)  
 
10.1 Definitions  
 
The following definitions will be used in the assessment of safety:  
 
Adverse Event (AE)  is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, including any 
abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, 
temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not considered 
related to the subject’s participation in the research.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is any adverse event that  
(1) results in death;  
(2) is life -threatening;  
(3) results in subject  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
(4) results in  a persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
(5) results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
(6) based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject's health and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other out comes listed in this definition 
(examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in the 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of dr ug dependency or drug abuse).  
 
Life-threatening  means that the event places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred.  
 
Unanticipated Problem  is defined as an event, experience or outcome that meets all three  of the 
following c riteria:  
• is unexpected ; AND  
• is related or possibly related  to participation in the research; AND  
• suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk  of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previous ly known or recognized.  
 
Page 16 of 22 
\\DC - 760509/[ADDRESS_645796] been caused by [CONTACT_51408], severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with either:  
• the known or foreseeable risk of adverse events associated with the procedures involved in the 
research that are described in (a) the protocol –related documents, such as the IRB-approved 
research protocol, any applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB -approved informed 
consent document, and (b) other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and 
package inserts; or  
• the expected natural progression o f any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the 
subject(s) experiencing the adverse event and the subject’s predisposing risk factor profile for the 
adverse event.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_645797]. Alan Farwell will serve as an Independent Scientific Reviewer (ISR). He will 
provide an assurance that the findings and conclusions reached are supported by [CONTACT_96248], and 
also, to assure that the content is consistent with applicable scientific standards and  will be re sponsible 
for a review of the data analysis, data interpretation and/or presentations and manuscripts.  
 
The following known side effects of UVB will be monitored:  
Side effect  Signs/symptoms  Instruction for subjects on 
monitoring  
Sunburn  Pain, tenderness o f the 
skin, redness, tightness, 
itching, and rarely 
blistering  
 Check for pain and redness 4 -6 
hours after treatment. If there 
is severe pain, should seek 
medical attention.  
 
If there are blisters, should seek 
medical attention  
Photoaging  Atrophic skin, coarseness, 
fibrotic areas, increased 
fragility, laxity, mottled  
pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], 
telangiectasias, wrinkling  If there is increased fragility (i.e. 
easy bruising or tearing of skin), 
then should seek medical 
attention.  The other 
photoaging side effects are 
benign and more of a cosmetic 
nature.  
 
Tanning  Skin darkening  As a benign side effect, no 
subject monitoring is needed

\\DC - 760509/000001 - 15602675 v1    
 
 
In addition, Prior to each treatment, Solius software will prompt the user with the following questions to 
assess erythema:  
 
1. Did you observe any pi[INVESTIGATOR_96225] (similar to  sunburn) after your last treatment? (yes / no)  
2. Did the pi[INVESTIGATOR_96226] 3 days? (yes / no)  
3. Did you experience any pain or discomfort (excluding itch) with the pi[INVESTIGATOR_96225]? (none / mild / 
moderate/severe)  
 
Based on the user’s response, the software could maintain current dose, reduce dose, or block account 
for further investigation. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_48107]. Shirvani or [CONTACT_96254] will be notified to perform further 
assessment if an account was blocked by [CONTACT_501376].  
 
10.3 Reporting Plans  
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_51398]/BU Medical Campus will report Unanticipated Problems, safety 
monitors’ reports, and Adverse Events to the BMC/BU Medical Center IRB in accordance with IRB 
policies:  
• Unanticipated Problems occurring at BMC/BU Medical Campus involving a fatal or life -threatening 
event will be reported to the IRB within 2 days of the investigator learning of the event.  
• Unanticipated Problems occurring at BMC/BU Medical Campus not involving a fatal or life -
thre atening event will be reported to the IRB within 7 days of the investigator learning of the 
event.  
• Reports from safety monitors with recommended changes will be reported to the IRB within 7 
days of the investigator receiving the report.  
• Adverse Events (in cluding Serious Adverse Events) will be reported in summary at the time of 
continuing review, along with a statement that the pattern of adverse events, in total, does not 
suggest that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm than w as previously 
known.  
• Reports from safety monitors with no recommended changes will be reported to the IRB at the 
time of continuing review.

12 Statistical Plan 
12.1 Statistical analysis  
Data will be analyzed using the statistical software package SPSS (SPSS Institute, Chicago, [LOCATION_003]). Serum 
levels of 25(OH)D will inspect for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov -Smirnov test, homogeneity 
of the variance (Levene -test), and outliers. The results will present as mean±standard deviation, or 
median.  
Serum levels of 25(OH)D will be compared before and after the study using the paired Student’s t -test 
(for normal distribution) or Wilcoxon test for repeated measu res. Also, controlling for putative 
confounders such as skin type and sex, we will employ univariate general linear models (GLM) for the 
25(OH)D levels. Significant  P-value will consider <0.05.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_645802] that with the incorporation of a 4-week phototherapy regiment, subjects  will increase their 
serum 25(OH)D levels. In particular , we expect individuals with Fitzpatrick Type I and II skin to show the 
greatest response to phototherapy.  
 
12.3 Sample Size Determination  
 
A previous study by [CONTACT_96251]. demonstrated the increase in the mean serum 25(OH)D in subjects 
with malabsorption syndrome receiving UV therapy from 21± 3 ng/mL to 27±4 ng/mL.  According to this 
previous study, we postulate the mean and standard deviat ion of serum 25(OH)D before and after the 
intervention.  
To achieve a power of 90% and a level of significance (α) of 0.05 (two sided), for detecting a mean of the 
differences of [ADDRESS_645803] that 80% of the population in the [LOCATION_011] area has a level of 25(OH)D below 30 ng/ml. Thus, 
we have to enroll approximately 14 subjects with different group skin types to enroll 10 vitamin D 
deficient or insufficient subjects in this study.  In our experience, the rate of screen failure and patient 
dropout is 10 -15%. Then, we expect to have at least 8 subje cts at the end of the study to achieve the 
desired power.  
 
  
13 Ethics/Protection of Human Subjects  
 
This study is to be conducted according to applicable US federal regulations and institutional policies 
(which are based in federal regulation s, guidance, and ICH Good Clinical Practice guidelines).

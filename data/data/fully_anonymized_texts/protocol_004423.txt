4 Background 
 
In the [LOCATION_002] there are approximately 468, 000 patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) who 
require routine hemodialysis (HD) as their renal replacement therapy .  Among prevalent patients as of 
December 2018, more than four out of every five patients receiving hemodialysis were using an AV fistula or 
graft (82.4%; 65.7% fistula and 16.7% graft1).    
The natural history of a hemodialysis access is the persistent development of neointimal hyperplastic 
stenoses.   In fistulas, the most common location of stenoses depends upon the type of fistula. Radial artery-
cephalic vein fistulas often develop juxta-anastomotic stenoses, brachial artery to cephalic vein fistulas 
develop cephalic arch stenoses, often at the site of a hypertrophied valve ring and brachial artery to 
transposed basilic vein have a predilection to develop stenosis at the swing point of the vein.2  
These stenoses cause a reduction in blood flow through the access and thereby [CONTACT_92989]. If left untreated, these aggressive lesions will eventually cause the 
access to thrombose. 
Percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA) is the primary technique for treatment of neointimal 
stenoses associated with prosthetic hemodialysis grafts and native fistulas. It remains the standard 
treatment to which other percutaneous techniques are compared.  
Limitations of PTA include:  
 Post angioplasty elastic recoil.  After being dilated, elastic elements in the vessel wall cause 
immediate decrease in lumen diameter. 
 Inability to fully dilate a lesion: Dense intimal hyperplasia can be resistant to expansion. Ultra-High-
pressure balloons are needed which increase patient discomfort and the risk of vessel rupture. 
 Recurrent stenosis.[ADDRESS_102773] reported six-month 
patency rates of 25 – 78%.5 Angioplasty failures may be due to acute elastic recoil, vascular rupture during 
balloon inflation or rapid re-growth of the neointimal stenosis. Subsequent dysfunction of the dialysis circuit 
is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing HD which results in repeated 
interventions and can eventually lead to loss of vascular access.  
The FLEX Vessel Prep™ system is currently marketed in the [LOCATION_002] and cleared via 510K by [CONTACT_86959] (FDA).  It is a vessel preparation device indicated for use with percutaneous 
transluminal angioplasty (PTA) catheters to facilitate dilation of stenoses in the femoral and popliteal arteries 
and treatment of obstructive lesions of native or synthetic arteriovenous dialysis fistulae. The device is also 
indicated for treatment of in-stent restenosis  of balloon expandable and self-expanding stents in the 
peripheral vasculature. It is an over-the-wire sheathed system, utilizing a flexible vessel prep treatment 
element equipped with three flexible struts near the distal tip. The proximal portion of each flexible strut 
includes a 0.25mm micro-surgical blade. The FLEX Vessel Prep device is placed over an .014” or .018” 
guidewire distal to the lesion to be treated.   The sheath is retracted, and the treatment element is expanded 
 
 
Protocol Number:  VMG-2021-[ADDRESS_102774] the lesion. A retrograde pull-back is applied to cross the lesion.  The microsurgical blades on the 
proximal end of each treatment element strut independently engage in the lesion to create three parallel, 
circumferential continuous micro-incisions, with a depth of approximately 250 microns, along the entire 
length of the stenosis. The FLEX Vessel Prep treatment element is re-sheathed and advanced again through 
the lesion to allow a subsequent pullback.  
Unlike static PTA balloons, the FLEX Vessel Prep™ System provides continuous engagement of the dynamic 
treatment element to create micro-incisions along the entire length of the stenosis. Creating longitudinal 
micro-incisions in the stenosis releases the circumferential tension to enable luminal gain with improved 
vessel compliance, may reduce the need for high pressure balloons and reduce vessel trauma and 
complications, including dissection and the need for bail-out stent placement.  
Controlled vessel preparation with the FLEX Vessel Prep System may help minimize barotrauma of high-
pressure balloon inflation and extend primary patency of the target lesion.  Every step that can be taken to 
improve the outcomes in a patient population that has such limited options, fills a significant unmet clinical 
need.

Confidential  6 Study Design 
 
This is a prospective, multi- center, randomized (1:1) clinical study evaluating the FLEX Vessel Prep System 
followed with PTA (TEST arm) vs PTA alone (CONTROL arm) for the treatment of de novo or non-stented 
restenotic obstructive lesions up to [ADDRESS_102785] Description 
 
7.1 FLEX Vessel Prep™ 
The FLEX Vessel Prep System™ is an over-the-wire sheathed catheter with a three-strut treatment 
element near the distal tip. The Treatment Element consists of three independent flexible struts, 
each with a precision blade, mounted on the proximal end. As the device is pulled back in a 
retrograde fashion through the target lesion, the Treatment Element “flexes” providing continuous 
engagement along the lesion to create controlled depth microincisions.   
 
7.2 PTA Balloon 
The brand and type of PTA balloon(s) used will be at the discretion of the treating physician and 
used according to its IFU. PTA balloons consist of an over-the-wire catheter with a balloon fixed at 
the distal tip. Within the lesion the balloon is inflated to a pressure that allows full effacement. 
Standard pressure balloons (<20atm), high pressure (>20atm), and ultra-high pressure (>30atm) 
have been used for resistant AV stenosis.6 Balloon sizing matches reference vessel diameter (RVD) 
1:1 and usually extends beyond the lesion length.

been determined that he/she meets all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria, and the guidewire has successfully crossed the lesion selected for treatment. If the 
lesion cannot be crossed, it will be classed as a screen failure. All information collected up 
until the point of screen failure, including the informed consent form, demographics, and 
procedure information, will be stored in a Screening Binder.  
Once the patient is enrolled, they will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_102792] Arm or

9.6 Index Percutaneous Intervention Procedure – After Randomization  
 
9.6.[ADDRESS_102794] Arm: FLEX Vessel Prep™ System and PTA 
 
 FLEX Vessel Prep is placed over an 0.14” or 0.18” guidewire and advanced distal 
to the lesion to be treated. Following procedural guidelines in the Instructions 
for Use, the FLEX Vessel Prep System is used to create circumferential, 
continuous micro-incisions along the length of the stenosis by [CONTACT_746] a 
retrograde pullback through the lesion.  
 Post use of the FLEX Vessel Prep, a fistulogram of the AV access circuit is 
obtained. 
 Standard Balloon angioplasty is performed with an uncoated PTA balloon sized 
to meet the reference vessel diameter, according to its corresponding 
instructions for use.  Once advanced to the lesion, the balloon should be 
inflated according to the site’s standard of care.   
 Note 1: During balloon inflation, opening/effacement pressure  
(defined as minimum inflation pressure required to efface target 
lesion noting parallel balloon walls) and maximum pressure  (defined 
as highest pressure required during index procedure to treat target 
lesion) will be assessed. 
 Note 2: Administer the NRS to the subject to identify the highest 
level of pain experienced during the procedure. 
 A fistulogram is obtained of the final PTA result.  
 Record procedural data on the CRFs. 
 
9.6.2 CONTROL Arm: PTA 
 Optional: A standard uncoated PTA balloon is sized to meet the reference 
vessel diameter, according to its corresponding instructions for use.  The 
balloon is placed over an appropriate guidewire and advanced to the lesion.  
The balloon is inflated to pre-dilate the lesion according to its instructions for 
use and the site’s standard of care.

9.9 Data Collection 
9.9.1 Source Documents 
Data recorded onto paper case report forms (CRF) must be traceable to source 
documents. Source documentation is defined as the first-time data appears and may 
include original documents, data, and medical records (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical 
and office charts, laboratory notes, etc.). 
 
9.9.2 Deviation Handling 
A deviation is any event in which the study is not conducted according to the 
protocol, applicable laws or regulations or the Investigator Agreement. Deviations 
may include, but are not limited to the following: 
 Failure to obtain informed consent prior to participation 
 Incorrect version of the informed consent form used 
 Failure to obtain IRB approval before enrolling subjects in the study 
 Included subject did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria 
 Required testing and/or measurements not done or incorrectly done 
 Subject missing a required follow-up  
 Follow-up was completed outside window 
 Source data permanently lost 
 Enrollment of subjects during lapse of IRB approval 
Reporting of all deviations should comply with IRB policies and must be reported to 
VentureMed as soon as possible upon the site becoming aware of the deviation. All 
deviations will be documented. 
 
   
 
Protocol Number:  VMG-2021-[ADDRESS_102798]’s consent for any reason.  
If a subject expi[INVESTIGATOR_6054], has the access site abandoned, withdraws early, or is withdrawn 
from the study early by [CONTACT_737], the reason for withdrawal must be 
recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the Exit Form.  
 
9.9.[ADDRESS_102799] (phone, email, text, or mail).  Once deemed lost-to-
follow- up, the communication efforts must be recorded in the subject’s medical 
record and on the Exit Form. 
 
[ADDRESS_102800] their willingness to continue participation. The Investigator will 
oversee all safety aspects of the study and report all adverse events to the IRB. 
 
10.2 Potential Benefits 
There are no guaranteed benefits from participation in the study. It is possible that treatment 
with the FLEX Vessel Prep System prior to use of PTA may improve and maintain blood flow 
through the treated AVF, resulting in the need for fewer treatments.  This may allow for 
continued/resumption of AV access for the purpose of hemodialysis. Additionally, it is 
possible that lower balloon inflation pressures following FLEX Vessel Prep use will result in 
fewer complications and potentially less pain experienced during the procedure.  Information 
gained from the conduct of this study may be of benefit to other persons with the same 
medical condition. 
 
   
 
Protocol Number:  VMG-2021-[ADDRESS_102801] all Serious Adverse Events 
(SAEs) observed in subjects from the time of enrollment until the event resolves or the subject exits 
the study.  In cases in which SAEs are unresolved at the time of study exit, this will be documented on 
the CRF. 
The Investigator is responsible for reporting SAEs to VentureMed as soon as possible, but no later than 
[ADDRESS_102802] aware of the event, by [CONTACT_92993]. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_92980]. 
 
12 Statistical Design and Methods 
This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized (1:1) study of FLEX Vessel Prep prior to PTA vs PTA 
alone for the treatment of de novo and non-stented restenotic lesions in the AVF. The study will enroll 
at up to seven centers in the US. 
Comparison of binomial proportions will be performed using Fisher’s exact test. Time-to-event 
analyses using the Kaplan-Meier method may be conducted to supplement the primary analysis of 
proportions. Comparisons of continuous variables will be performed using a two-sample t-test or 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test. 
For the primary efficacy endpoint and other 6-month endpoints that compare the proportion of 
subjects between arms, the numerator is the number of subjects with an event within [ADDRESS_102803] 23 days. 
The primary analysis will be based on intent-to-treat, including all subjects with available follow-up 
data analyzed by [CONTACT_92994]. Two-sided p-values less than 5% and one-
sided p-values less than 2.5% will be considered statistically significant. For this post-market study, 
statistically significant differences are not anticipated. The study is intended to provide estimates of 
the differences between groups. Estimated differences and their 95% confidence intervals will be 
reported for all endpoints. For the primary efficacy endpoint, if primary patency rates are 60% and 
80% in the control and treatment arms respectively, the 95% confidence interval width will be 
approximately ±25%. For the primary safety endpoint, if SAE rates are 5% in both arms, the 95% 
confidence interval width will be approximately ± 17%. 
Further details on the statistical methods, including justification, timing of interim analysis can be 
found in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

 1.0 Rationale  
Though integration of alcohol pharmacotherapy into pr imary care settings is receiving increasing emphasis 
and support, rigorous data to inform clinicians’ treatment choice is lacking.  The most recently  FDA-
approved alcohol treatment medication, an extended -release depot form of naltrexone (XR -NTX, Vivitrol® ), 
could  greatly simplify the medical  home -centered alcohol treatment emphasized in the NIAAA Clinician’s 
Guide.1 Injected once a month, XR-NTX offers a long -acting and thus potentially more effective form of 
pharmacotherapy than oral naltrexone (O -NTX) ,2 which , despi[INVESTIGATOR_848193] (COMBINE) trial and systematic reviews supporting some 
efficacy,3,4 has been characterized by [CONTACT_848245], poor adherence,  suboptimal monthly 
refill and inadequate treatment retention .5,6,7,8 Yet while promising as an alternative to O -NTX, XR-NTX is 
substantia lly more expensive (~$ 1100 vs. ~$100 per month),[ADDRESS_1179233] compared 
the two forms of naltrexone .  A comparati ve effectiveness approach is required to systematically evaluate 
the following key questions:  In primary care settings, what is the relative clinical effectiveness of XR -NTX 
vs. O -NTX?  W hat are the benefits and costs of XR -NTX relative  to O-NTX? And can patient and system 
characteristics  be identified to inform treatment choice to maximize the probability of success ful outcome ?   
 
Primary Aim: Treatment Effectiveness .  To evaluate the effectiveness of XR -NTX vs. O -NTX in producing a 
primary  good clinical outcome, defined as abstinence or moderate drinking ( <2 drinks/day, men; 
<1drink/day, women ; and <2 heavy drinking occasions/month), during the final 20 of 24 weeks of primary 
care-based  Medical Management for alcohol dependence .   
Hypothesis : The rate of this good clinical outcome will be approximately twice as great among participants 
receiving XR-NTX compared with those receiving O -NTX.   
 
Secondary Aim 1 :  Cost Effectivenes s.  To estimate the incremental  cost effectiveness of XR -NTX vs. O -
NTX, both in c onjunction with primary care -based  Medical Management .  
Hypothesis : XR-NTX treatment will be more cost effective than O -NTX.   
 
Secondary Aim 2 :  Patient -Level Predictors of Effectiveness .  To identify patient -level characteristics  
associated with effectiv eness in both arms .   
 
 
This proposed study  is a pragmatic, randomized, open -label clinical trial of 24 weeks of XR -NTX vs. O -NTX 
using a COMBINE -adapted  Medical Management  primary care  treatment model .  234 adults >18yo with 
alcohol dependence will be rec ruited from the community into treatment at a major  [LOCATION_001] City primary 
care site (Bellevue Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54246]’s Adult Primary Care Clinic ).  The primary outcome which powers this 
study is  a dichotomous  good clinical outcome defined by [CONTACT_848246] e drinking, and as 
measured by [CONTACT_848247] -to-treat approach  among all 
randomized participants.  Secondary outcomes include the incremental cost effectiveness  of the two arms , 
differences between arms by [CONTACT_848248] (drinks/day, % days abstinent, time to 
first heavy drinking  day, biomarkers ), and  the exploratory analysis of  factors possibly associated with 
effectiveness, including gender, pre -treatment abstinence, and mu opi[INVESTIGATOR_9736] (OPRM1)  genotypes .

 2.0 Study Timeline: This NIAAA notice of grant award was issued on July 18, [ADDRESS_1179234] number:  
1R01AA02083 6-01A1 .  We expect a [ADDRESS_1179235] of this proposal has not changed since the original proposal: despi[INVESTIGATOR_848194] , the comparative effectiveness of XR -NTX compared to older alcohol medications 
remains uncertain, particularly in a mainstream, primary care treatmen t model that is generalizable and 
broadly accessible.  Newer, novel, expensive medications for addiction disorders are historically greatly 
underutilized by [CONTACT_200791].  This study is innovative both as a ‘head -to-head’ evaluation of 
XR- vs. O -NTX in primary care, and because expected participants will be primarily Medicaid -covered or 
uninsured persons who will not be excluded based on medical and psychiatric co -morbidities that often 
preclude participation in efficacy studies.  If  health insur ance expansion, parity reforms, medical homes and 
accountable care organizations are to define primary care as a core alcohol treatment setting in the coming 
decade, exactly this type of study is required to guide treatment protocols and resource allocatio n. 
Ultimately, more widespread adoption of cost -effective alcohol pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_848195], 
healthier lives and lower costs.  
 
3.2 Optimizing Primary Care Alcohol Treatment  
  This study addresses the comparative effectiveness of alcohol pharm acotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_848196], a high priority area at NIH/NIAAA as evidenced by [CONTACT_276754] -10-273, ‘Clinically Relevant 
Comparative Effectiveness of Alcoholism Treatments .’  This proposal is in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_848197]’s FY09 -[ADDRESS_1179236] workforce to screen  and treat alcohol dependence.  
  Alcohol diso rders are common, costly, and undertreated: Unhealthy  alcohol use exacts a 
tremendous toll in morbidity, mortality, suffering and cost.11 An estimated 23% of U.S. persons aged 12 or 
older reported binge drinking (5 or more drinks on any once occasion) at le ast once in the last 30 days, and 
an additional 7% reported “heavy use” (binge drinking on [ADDRESS_1179237] 30 days ) in the 2008  National

 Survey on Drug Use and Health.12 An estimated 4% of U.S. adults aged [ADDRESS_1179238] recent published NESARC data ; 5% met criteria for abuse.[ADDRESS_1179239] of evidence -based alcohol 
treatment.16 
 
3.3 Oral naltrexone pharmacotherapy is under -prescribed and plagued by [CONTACT_848249] ‘real -world’ adherence, yet 
O-NTX plus Medical Management was superior in the rece nt COMBINE trial  
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_848198], pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_848199].17  Daily oral medications including disulfiram, oral naltrexone, and 
acamprosate remain in limited us e, reflecting a paucity of specialty treatment centers or generalists 
prescribing these medications.5 The 2001 publication of the large Veterans Administration (VA) RCT of O -
NTX showed daily naltrexone adherenc e of 44% and 43%, respectively, in participants randomized to 12 
and 3 months of O -NTX.18 Commercial HMO prescription data has shown <15% rates of persistent O -NTX 
refills through 6 months, 6,19 while one analysis of New England  VA pharmacy data reported <25% of O -NTX 
prescriptions persisting through this same timeframe.[ADDRESS_1179240] in combining naltrexone prescribing with Medical 
Management (MM), a physician -, nurse -, or other ancillary staff -led counseling approach that focuses  on 
support for drinking abstinence and medication adherence, and that does not explicitly incorporate ancillary 
treatment or formal therapeutic approaches (i.e., 12 -step faci litation, motivational interviewing, or cognitive 
behavioral therapy).[ADDRESS_1179241] , reduce s alcohol  related  euphoria , and 
craving and relapse among abstinent drink ers, in particular reducing heavy drinking epi[INVESTIGATOR_848200].21,22,23  In COMBINE, oral naltrexone -treated alcohol dependent participants  demonstrated a greater 
percent of days abstinent , fewer heavy drinking days , and a higher proportion of patients achieving a 
composite good clinical outcome  (abstine nce/moderate drinking)  vs. placebo or acamprosate arms, and oral 
naltrexone with MM was more effective than other combinations of pharmacotherapy and behavioral 
treatment.   This data echoed earlier, smaller trials which also supported an O -NTX plus primary  care MM 
approach.24,25 
Mean adherence to oral naltrexone in COMBINE was  initially reported as  high (85% of prescribed 
drug was not returned and assumed to have been take n), though these results are  somewhat  difficult to 
interpret as a large  proportion of pa rticipants assigned to 16 weeks of naltrexone at some point dis continued 
the medication ( 96 of 154 participants assigned to naltrexone + MM discontinued the medication).   A 
subsequent secondary analysis of COMBINE medication adherence data reported 72% tot al daily 
adherence among MM patients receiving active naltrexone and placebo acamprosate, with better 
adherence to both naltrexone and placebo associated with favorable drinking outcomes.26  This highlights 
an important tension in the oral naltrexone litera ture: randomized trials of select alcohol dependent patients 
(typi[INVESTIGATOR_848201] -morbid substance use and psychiatric disorders, as was the case in 
COMBINE) report relatively high levels of medication adherence and moderate effect sizes, whi le 
commercial pharmacy data and naturalistic observational studies demonstrate quite low levels of oral 
naltrexone adherence and little real -world effectiveness.   
 Importantly, the COMBINE trial’s Medical Management protocols standardized (and certified) the 
MM physicians, nurses, and pharmacists providers in a recovery support and medication adherence 
enhancement counseling approach delivered in an initial 45 min. session, and then in 20 min. follow -up 
visits, totaling 8 visits in 16 weeks (Weeks 1, 2, 4,  6, 8, 10, 12, and 16).   This basic approach to  counseling 
strategies and  follow -up visit frequency is summarized by [CONTACT_848250]’s Guide , which forms the 
basis of the physician -led Medical Management platform used as this study’s active psychosoci al treatment.  
 
3.4 Extended -Release Naltrexone : Effective  and Cost -Effective ? 
  Efforts to expand alcohol treatment options and improve adherence to naltrexone treatment 
contributed to the development of a long -acting, polylactideco -glycolide -based (PLG) naltrexone formulation

 (XR-NTX, Vivitrol®, Alkermes, Inc) .  Shown to be efficacious vs. placebo at reducing heavy drinking days in 
a dose -dependent fashion over 6 months (with 64% of all participants receiving 6 of 6 monthly injections),27 
XR-NTX gained FDA approval for alcohol dependence in 2006 (a separate opi[INVESTIGATOR_848202] 2010 ).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_848203], only one additional 
study has further estimated the efficacy of XR -NTX in general adult po pulations,[ADDRESS_1179242] compared 
its effectiveness advantages vs. oral naltrexone.29  Our own pi[INVESTIGATOR_848204] -NTX in primary care is discussed 
below (Approach, 3.2 Preliminary Studies and Investigative Team) and demonstrated high rates of retention 
and signif icant decreases in daily and heavy drinking.[ADDRESS_1179243] effective of the active intervention arms, including other pharmacotherapy 
combinations, at achieving two of the study’s prim ary endpoints (no heavy drinking and a ‘good clinical 
outcome’).36,37,[ADDRESS_1179244] 
emergency services and alcohol 
detoxification ( Fig. 1) .[ADDRESS_1179245] savings is 
warranted.   
 
3.6 What predicts good clinical outcomes in XR -NTX vs. O -NTX treatment?  
  Baseline and longitudinal predictors of interest in naltrexone alcohol treatment efficacy and 
effectiveness trials include gender, ethnicity and mu opi[INVESTIGATOR_848205], pre -treatment abstinence, 
and ancillary alcohol behavioral treatment involvement.  Female gender has been shown to be associated 
with increased nausea and diminished oral naltrexone adherence40 and less overall treatment effect, 
including sub -group results from th e pi[INVESTIGATOR_848206] -NTX efficacy  trial, and gender remains a 
stratification variable at randomization.27 
  Naltrexone’s  relative in effective ness  in African American clinical trial sub -populations, including in  
the COMBINE trial,41 is possibly mediated by [CONTACT_848251]40 OPRM1 functional allele in persons of 
African descent, who are primarily Asn40 homozygous.42  This Asp40 ( A118G , ‘G’ allele)  OPRM1  functional 
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been  shown  to be associated with successful treatment with 
naltrexone .43,[ADDRESS_1179246] of Asp40 on XR -NTX treatment outcomes , which we feel adds to this proposals significance and

 innovative potential .  This  will be in partnership with Charles O’Brien (consultant) and [CONTACT_848271]’s 
lab at the University of Pennsylva nia, which will perform the genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_848207] . 
  Lead -in drinking abstinence ( 3 days prior to initiating medications) will be analyzed  a priori a s a 
predictor of effectiveness in both medication arms .  A participant’s  ability to abstain from drin king prior to an 
initial XR -NTX injection may predict treatment response and is highly relevant to the initiation of naltrexone 
treatment in monitored detox settings,45 though we did not observe this same association in our  smaller  XR-
NTX primary care pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] , which is described below and included few patients with pre -treatment abstinence or 
recently discharged from a detox unit.2 Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_848208] a strong association between persons involved at 
baseline or who became involved during primary care XR -NTX treatment with specialty alcohol treatment 
and/or Alcoholics Anonymous.  We will be able to carefully track prior detox admissions, pre -treatment 
abstinence, and concurrent [ADDRESS_1179247] in primary care alcohol treatment?  
We clearly  feel a dichotomous  ‘good  clinical  outcome’  best defines  a patient’s  progress  to ‘goal’  in a 
primary  care comparative  effectiveness  trial, and represents  innovation .  Our choice  of a moderate -drinking -
only good  clinical  outcome  reflects : a) the use of this same  outcome  in the COMBINE  trial,3 b) its ability  to 
capture  both abstinence  and reduced  heavy  drinking,  and, c) a preference  for a dichotomous  
success/failure  primary  outcome,  which  neatly  deals  with drop-outs and missing  data as ‘failure s.’  A 
dichotomous , success/failure  primary  outcome  is in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_848209] .46,47,48,49,50  Further,  this study  will track  and report  all drinking  rates  over time based  on 
TLFB,  facilitating  easy  comparisons  to other  alcohol  trials,  and also analyze  XR-NTX’s  impact  on 
biomarkers,  including  carbohydrate -deficient  transferrin  (CDT) .  CDT is highly  specific  to heavy  drinking  and 
compliments  well the primary  good  clinical  outcome .  CDT has not been  tracked  in an XR-NTX clinical  trial, 
a secondary  outcome  we feel adds  substantially  to this proposal’s  innovative  potential.  
Few studies  have  exam ined smoking  cessation  among  heavy  drinking  smokers,  or during  naltrexone  
therapy  for alcohol  use disorders . Smoking  continues  to be an enormous  health  crisis  within  the United  
States.  Those  with alcohol  use disorder  are more  likely  to smoke  than the gener al population  and account  
for more  than [ADDRESS_1179248]  rarely  investigated  combination  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] .59 Given  the prevalence,  the burden  of disease,  and the 
limited  success  in treating  heavy  drinking  smokers,  further  research  is needed  to discover  effective  
therapeutic  options.  Our study  will explore  rates  of quitting  and reduced  smoking  in all active  and new 
patients  during  NTX + MM alcohol  treatment.  
A history  of trauma  and current  post-traumatic  stress  symptoms  and disorders  are believed  to be 
overly  prevalent  among  addiction  disorder  patients  and alcohol  use disorder  patient  samples . A survey  
conducted  on a nationally  representative  sample  of the [LOCATION_002]  population  showed  that approximately  
46.4%  of individuals  in the United  States  with PTSD  have  a comorbid  alcohol  or drug use disorder .60 PTSD  
and substance  use disorder  comorbidity  is associated  with a poor prognosis  in both disorders  (increased  
psychiatric  comorbidity,  exacerbated  PTSD  symptoms,  and greater  risk of relapse  during  or after substance

the current  literature  provides  inconclusive  and contradictary  results  of various  phamacologic  
treatments.64,65 The interaction  of PTSD  symptoms  with active  naltrexone  alcohol  treatment  is one that is not 
well known  or studied.66 We will pi[INVESTIGATOR_848210].  
 
3.8 Preliminary Studies and the Investigative Team : Alcohol and XR -NTX Research at NYUMC  
The foundation for our proposal was a single -arm evaluation of XR -NTX in monthly primary care 
medical management of alcohol dependence, led by [CONTACT_6283]. Lee, Gourevitch, and Rotrosen (Co -Is). 
XR-NTX plus Medical Management in Primary Care : This recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_848211], acceptability and likely effectiveness of a [ADDRESS_1179249] within  the 
same two clinical settings we now propose and among a study population which was 15% African 
American, 22% Latino, and 60% Medicaid/Medicar e or uninsured .  Baseline drinking in this cohort (57%, % 
heavy drinking days) was similar to that of the COMBINE (63%) and Garbutt  (64%) trials.   Most eligible, 
consented patients initiated (90%) and completed (62% of those initiating injections, 56% of N =72 patients ) 
three months of treatment not involving monetary or other incentives , except ing a single $[ADDRESS_1179250] (Table 1 ).  The 3 -month adherence  rate we observed 
was only slightly lower tha n in the  relatively intensive Garbutt efficacy trial of XR -NTX (74%).26 These rates 
of adherence and treatment retention  were also similar to  uptake and adherence rates expected in primary 
care patients initiating pharmacotherapy for common chronic conditi ons, such as hypertension or high 
cholesterol.67,68,69  Finally, reductions in self-reported drinking reductions , including significantly fewer heavy 
drinking days,  were significant and sustained among persons  retained in treatment  (Table 1 ). Thus, in this 
single-arm observational pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], treating alcohol dependence in primary care settings with XR -NTX and 
monthly physician medical management appeared a feasible and possibly effective model of alcohol 
treatment .

4.0 Study Aims  
 
4.1 Primary  Aim:  Treatment Effectiveness .  To evaluate the effectivene ss of XR -NTX vs. O -NTX in 
producing a primary good clinical outcome, defined as abstinence or moderate drinking ( <2 drinks/day, 
men; <1drink/day, women; and <2 heavy drinking occasions/month), during the final 20 of 24 weeks of 
primary care -based  Medical Management for alcohol dependence .   
Hypothesis : The rate of this good clinical outcome will be approximately twice as great among participants 
receiving XR-NTX compared with those receiving O -NTX.   
 
4.2 Secondary  Aim 1:  Cost Effectivenes s.  To estimate t he incremental  cost effectiveness of XR -NTX vs. 
O-NTX both in conjunction with primary care -based  Medical Management .  
Hypothesis : XR-NTX treatment will be more cost effective than O -NTX.   
 
Secondary Aim 2:  Patient -Level Predictors of Effectiveness .  To identify patient -level characteristics  
associated with effective ness in both arms .   
 
5.0 Study Design: A Randomized Comparative Effectiveness Trial to Evaluate XR -NTX vs. O -NTX for 
Alcohol Dependence in Primary Care  
We propose a pragmatic randomized cont rolled trial to compare the effectiveness and incremental cost -
effectiveness of XR -NTX vs. O -NTX as a component of primary care -based Medical Management of alcohol 
dependence among 234 adults.  The 24 week treatment trial will assess monthly treatment rete ntion, self -
reported drinking outcomes, biomarkers, and costs.  The primary effectiveness outcome is a  moderate 
drinking  good clinical outcome, defined as abstinence or moderate drinking ( <2 drinks/day, men; <1 
drink/day, women, and <2 heavy drinking occas ions/month), during weeks 5-24.  A long -term follow -up 
assessment at week [ADDRESS_1179256] data.   The MM visit schedule and research 
assessment visits will occur as follows over 48 weeks (Table 2):

7.[ADDRESS_1179258] of both in -clinic referrals of existing primary care patients, as well as community 
recruitment of patients new to primary care.  Recruitment will rely on the successful blend of ‘in -reach’ 
(meetings with clinicians, detailing, systematic communication)  and local area outreach (ads, external 
detailing) that we employed during our pi[INVESTIGATOR_848216] 116 persons, consent 76, and enroll 72 
eligible persons over a 13 -month period (a rate of 5.5 persons enrolled per month, similar to that of the 
current  study).  Routine screening for alcohol use is not presently standard practice at the study site.  
However, if routine alcohol screening launches during the course of the study (SBIRT implementation 
efforts are on -going within the HHC system), eligible per sons identified through SBIRT efforts could be 
referred to the study.  Persons interested in study enrollment will call a n intake number, or consult with a 
research coordinator in -person.  A brief eligibility pre-screen will determine probable  eligibility,  after which 
patients will be scheduled for a baseline screening visit.   Recruitment will be patient - or provider -initiated 
rather than initiated by [CONTACT_5051]. Potential subjects will not be approached at random by [CONTACT_848254] -initiated.  Most referrals will come from in -clinic 
referrals by [CONTACT_848255]. Potential participants  will call the research team 
phone number advertised or received from referring physician. Research coordinators will complete a pre -
screening on the phone with potential subjects to do an initial assessment of eligibility. If potential 
participants  are deemed initially eligible (based on phone -screen) by [CONTACT_186573], resea rch 
coordinators will schedule the initial Screening Visit with subject at Bellevue Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. All documents 
containing PHI on pre -screen interviews of potential subjects pre -screened on telephone and found to be 
ineligible or not interested in study will b e destroyed. The only information that will be retained from 
ineligible pre -screens will be gender and age.  Participants will also be recruited through word of mouth 
referrals.  Participants can earn a $50 referral bonus for each eligible person referred an d successfully

 randomized into this study.  All participants will be provided travel reimbursements in the form of MetroCards 
at the end of every study visit.  
 
7.2 Screening and Randomization  
At the baseline visit , informed consent will be obtained and eligibility confirmed  by [CONTACT_848256].  A subsequent randomization/treatment visit will then be scheduled within a 2 week 
time period.  Several factors may be associated with naltrexone treatment success/failure.  We will strati fy 
urn randomization by [CONTACT_848257] (in -clinic vs. community referrals).  Stratifying further, 
however, yields increasingly smaller cells, given 117 per arm; AA ethnicity, medication preference (monthly 
injectable vs. daily oral), and lea d-in (3 -day) abstinence will be analyzed as a priori predictors of 
effectiveness.   Randomization is the starting point of the study (day 1, week 1).   
 
7.3 Study Interventions: M edical Management  plus XR -NTX vs. O -NTX 
Existing primary care physicians, all board -certified in internal medicine, physician assistants, and 
registered nurses at an adult  primary care clinic, Bellevue Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], will be recruited to participate in this trial 
as MM clinicians.  As in our previous studies with XR -NTX and buprenorphine  in these sites, study 
participants may see different individual providers over the course of 24 weeks, thus optimizing visit 
flexibility as well as enhancing generalizability to multi -provider practice settings.  The same study clinicians 
will provide bot h XR - and O -NTX treatmen t.  The study site relies primarily on physician visits as the core 
modality for primary care encounters, and it is expected study visits will be primarily with physicians.  Study 
clinicians will provide all XR -NTX injections in clin ic (Ambulatory Care, 2nd floor, Rm. #2111) each month for 
each participant randomized to the XR -NTX arm. O -NTX, which is a daily oral  pi[INVESTIGATOR_848217], 
will be self -administered on a daily basis by O -NTX participants.  
 The content of the Medi cal Management component will be the same in both arms, and will be 
based on the initial and follow -up MM visits outlined in the COMBINE MM manual  and adapted by [CONTACT_848258]’s Guide .20  MM emphasizes: a ) education surrounding the alcohol dependence diagnosis, 
b) a recommendation  and emphasis on drinking abstinence, c) support for 12-step involvement  (referrals to 
specialty outpatient treatment will not be part of the MM strategy – patients interested in such will not be 
prohibited from self -referral , and specialty referrals will be made in cases of relapse/treatment failure ), d) 
self-efficacy counseling surrounding medication adherence, e) education and trouble -shooting of medication 
side effects, f) feed back on the success of drinking reductions, g) and non -specific support and motivational 
enhancement to make further changes toward abstinence .   
MM clinician’s will be trained at start -up and through quarterly calls and booster session in an 
adaptive approach  consistent with the NIAAA COMBINE trial (see  NIAAA COMBINE manual ) and in 
consultation  with [CONTACT_133822] .  Strict standardization and certification of MM clinicians, as was done in 
COMBINE, will not be pursued, as this would diverge from a pragmatic clin ical trial attempting to reflect the 
adoption of, but not absolute fidelity to COMBINE MM.    
 
7.4 Study Care vs. Usual Care:  Participants in both arms may schedule additional MM visits as needed to 
address medication side effects or unanticipated study -related events.  Any such additional visits required 
will be tracked carefully as service utilization.  Telephone support with research coordinators and study 
clinicians will be available at all times during the study and also tracked as utilization.  However , clinicians 
cannot  provide or bill for other routine primary care services, such as blood pressure management or 
cancer screening, during MM visits.  This is a conundrum in any NIH-funded, patient -level clinical trial in 
primary care , which cannot budget for comprehensive care .  Patients  can initiate or continue access to all 
primary care services through the same clinician and in the same clinics , it will simply occur as a non -study 
visit at either clinical site, both of which are public clinics providing  access to all patients regardless of 
insurance status or ability to pay .   
 
7.5 XR-NTX P lus Medical Management  
Protocol v7.0                              X:ON, XR-NTX vs. Oral NTX for Alcohol Dependence  
Page 12 of 27 
 XR-NTX will be delivered at the point of care  as a single, 380mg IM injection (4cc) to alternating 
upper, outer, gluteal (buttock) quadrants .  Injections occur every four weeks .  Between -injection MM visits 
will assess and manage adverse events , treatment effects , and support the goal of alcohol abstinence .   
 
7.6 Oral NT X Plus Medical Management  
O-NTX will be provided by [CONTACT_68811]’s pharmacy f ollowing each monthly medication 
dispensing/injection MM visit , and in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_848218] a 
recommended 50mg daily dose .80  Participants with means or adequate insurance coverage may instead 
present their written presc ription to an outside commercial pharmacy if they prefer.   
 
7.7 Research -only Assessment Visits  
 As in any large clinical trial of usual care, some participants  in both arms will not be present for all 
scheduled treatment visit s.  In an attempt to ‘de -link’ complete cost, utilization, and longitudinal drinking data 
collection from a naturalistic observation of these same usual care patterns, we will conduct 3 Research -
only Assessment visits at week 13, 25 and 48.  These visits will not hinge on a participa nt’s treatment 
retention status, will be heavily incentivized to encourage participation ($1 00 for time and travel), and will be 
conducted preferably in -person but alternatively by [CONTACT_262197] a participant is otherwise unwilling or unable 
to appear in cl inic. These visits will be carefully scheduled apart from MM treatment visits, which are 
otherwise not incentivized beyond the provision of no -cost care and medication, so as to minimize the 
influence of extra assessments, attention, and the monetary resea rch participation incentive on a 
participant’s willingness to continue with MM. Participants will be paid $ 20 for the initial screening visit after 
completion of all research assessments  and $20 after completing the randomization visit .  
 
7.8 Rescue Strate gies among Treatment Non -Responders  
Clearly many outcomes will occur among the 234 planned participants, beyond drinking reductions , 
and include: remaining in treatment and tolerating either medication but without beneficial changes to 
baseline alcohol int ake levels; droppi[INVESTIGATOR_848219]; or wishing to 
remain in primary care treatment but unable to tolerate either  form of naltrexone.  Regarding continued 
heavy alcohol use, MM already informs and encourages interest ed patients to access AA, and this 
recommendation would be particularly relevant to those not responding to pharmacotherapy and amenable 
to an external referral to more intensive treatment.  At any point in the trial, patients who appear to be 
unable to st op drinking due to severe withdrawal symptoms or who are experiencing severely detrimental 
consequences of heavy drinking (i.e., job loss, homelessness) will be encouraged to seek admission to 
inpatient detox  and specialty treatment  through Bellevue Hospit al.  Detox and intensive outpatient alcohol 
specialty services are immediately available to all participants through the Bellevue Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_848220] , including same -day admissions to our detox uni t, regardless of insurance status or 
ability to pay .  All enrolled participants, however, will be encouraged to remain in their assigned treatment 
protocols and continue follow -up in primary care for the entire 24 week treatment period, independent of 
medication side effects, on -going drinking, o r intermittent detox or other alcohol -related inpatient treatment 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  There is little risk, in other words, at keepi[INVESTIGATOR_848221] -going, frequent heavy drinking, in which case they would qualify as a pri mary good clinical outcome 
failure, or the need for further, more intensive specialty treatment, access to which the MM clinician and 
study staff may be crucial in facilitating.  At the conclusion of the 24 week treatment trial, all patients will be 
offere d further primary care follow -up within the same clinics  and referrals to specialty alcohol treatmen t, if 
indicated,  through these  universally accessible  addiction specialty services at Bellevue  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] .

A comprehensive panel of measures is planned including standard measures of drug and alcohol use, 
medical status, and on -going treatme nt services utilization. The Timeline Follow Back (TLFB), Alcohol Use 
Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), and  Obses sive-Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS) are all validated 
measures used to identify alcohol and drug use along with regular ur ine toxicology and breathalyzer tests. 
The ASSIST  will be used to assess for substance abuse or dependence and PHQ -[ADDRESS_1179259], Treat and Retain (STTR) assessment will collect various demographic 
information for each partic ipant . The Economic Form  90, Cost Survey, and World Health Organization 
Quality of Life Survey (WHOQOL)  will be used to assess treatment and criminal history as well as to 
ascertain economic data for cost -effectiveness outcome measures. The Morisky Medicat ion Adherence 
Scale (MMAS -8) will be administered to the O -NTX arm only, providing information on adherence to self -
administered medications. Fagerström’s test for nicotine dependence and recall of cigarettes per day will be 
used to assess smoking cessatio n measures. Adaptations of the Stages of Change Questionnaire  (SOC)  
and Responses to Stress Questionnaire  (RTS)  will look towards patient motivation, self -efficacy, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_25146].  The DSM -V criteria for PTSD, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 -Item Scale ( GAD -7), and Perceived 
Stress Scale (PSS) will be used to assess PTSD. Throughout the treatment phase, all adverse events (AEs) 
will be recorded on an AE form at all treatment visits.

Banked Genetic  and Biomarker Testing: At randomization, participants will provide two separate blood 
draws (3 teaspoons blood for each) for genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_848222].  Each of these blood samples will 
be labeled with the subject ID num ber and the date of blood draw only. No identifiable or private health 
information will be included on the labs prior to and when sent out for testing. Blood samples for a single 
biomarker (CDT) for heavy alcohol use will be drawn at randomization , weeks 13, and 25,  and kept frozen 
at secure NYUMC facility freezer. At the conclusion of enrollment for study, samples will be sent  in large 
batches  to the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) and [CONTACT_848274] ’s, a consultant on this 
protocol , laborat ory.  Results filed under the study ID only will be communicated and entered into the study 
database.  Whole blood samples for a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at  the mu opi[INVESTIGATOR_9736], the 
A118G OPRM1 SNP, will likewise be frozen, banked, and shipp ed in batch fashion for analysis at MUSC by

Page [ADDRESS_1179261]. Anton.  All samples will be destroyed following analysis and not preserved for future use.  Results from 
either CDT or OPRM1 will be for research purposes only, will not be considered in real -time or used for  
participant counseling, and will be analyzed at conclusion of the study as secondary biomarkers and genetic 
baseline predictors of treatment outcomes.   
 
8.1 Primary Outcome:  The primary outcome measure of this study is a binary measure of success /failure  
consisting  of a composite good clinical outcome (yes/no) through the final 20 weeks: abstinence or 
moderate drinking ( <2 drinks/day, men; <1 drink/day, women; <2 heavy drinking epi[INVESTIGATOR_848223] 4 weeks 
[heavy drinking is >5 drinks/occasion, men; >4 drinks/o ccasion, women).  Abstinence, drinks/day, and 
heavy drinking days will be assessed by [CONTACT_848259]81 administered at each MM and Research -only 
visit.  As the final MM visit (week 25) does not involve medication prescribing or constitute active treatmen t, 
the week 26 research -only assessment visit TLFB will be used to capture complete heavy drinking data 
among participants missing the final week 25 MM visit.   
Rationale: Why a binary good clinical outcome of abstinence or moderate drinking only as the 
primary outcome, vs. % days abstinent or time to first heavy drinking day?  As stated earlier and in the 
original proposal, we are interested in all of these important alcohol treatment outcomes, and which we will 
track and report.  Our strong preference is to anchor the design of this comparative effectiveness trial on a 
pragmatic good clinical outcome that would have genuine face validity for both pat ients and treatment 
providers.  This analytic approach is consistent with pragmatic comparative effectivenes s trial designs 
focusing on simple and important behavioral outcomes, such as post -intervention cancer screening, 
appropriate post -stroke smoking cessation treatment, or self -reported pain control over time.46,47,48,49,50 
 
8.2 Secondary Drinking, Adverse Events, and Measures : drink ing measures will be evaluated at each 
monthly visit (TLFB), along with  self-reported O -NTX adherence (MMAS -8) and adverse events .  Liver 
function tests (aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), gamma -glutamyl transferase 
(GGT) and carbohy drate -deficient transferrin (CDT) will be measured every three months (week 0/1, 13, 
and 25), with AST, ALT, and GGT results available in real -time to study physicians.  CDT, a validated 
biomarker for heavy drinking,82,83,84 is not in use or available at eith er facility, and will not be reported to 
participants or study physicians, but rather used as a secondary marker of baseline and in -treatment heavy 
drinking.   CDT represents a ‘cutting edge’ alcohol biomarker, and one not previously studied in the context 
of an XR -NTX treatment trial.  Analysis and interpretation of CDT results will be coordinated with [CONTACT_133822]  
and his laboratory .  Likewise, baseline assessments of drinking severity and psychiatric function (OCDS,85 
MINI -SCID,86 Form 9087) and naltrexone mu r eceptor susceptibility (Asp40 OPRM1 genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) will be 
captured for research purposes only, and not integrated into the clinician’s MM strategies.   
 
8.[ADDRESS_1179262] Effectiveness Outcomes:  Economic data will be derived primarily from the Economic Form 90,88 
Non-Study Medical Service and HHC electronic medical records assessments, EQ -5D (functional status),[ADDRESS_1179263] survey or standardized question querying patient reports of specific non -medical related costs 
(including lost/gained work, lost/gained dependent c are, transportation costs, arrests, motor vehicle 
accidents)  collected at baseline and at week  13, 25, and [ADDRESS_1179264] to the o verall 
study budget.  Whenever possible, v erification of productivity  (paystubs) and medical costs (medical 
records) will be sought to corroborate self -report.   
 
 
 
9.0 Power and Sample Size  
As in the original proposal and b ased on our recent feasibility s tudy of XR -NTX in primary care2 and 
the O -NTX treatment retention and adherence literature,6,7,19 including the single  review by [CONTACT_848260], 28 we are powering this study on the assumption that XR -NTX is 
approximately twice as effective as O -NTX at achieving drinking reductions, including  a good clinical 
outcome of abstinence or moderate -drinking -only during weeks 5 -24, and also  increased days abstinent 
and reduced rates of heavy drinking, drinks per drinking day, and drinks per day overall.  This is 
Protocol v7.0                              X:ON, XR-NTX vs. Oral NTX for Alcohol Dependence  
Page [ADDRESS_1179265] based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_848224] 40-50% of patients will complete 24 weeks of treatment on XR -NTX, compared to <20% on O -
NTX, based on O -NTX clinical trial and commercial refill data .  We then estimate  rates of the primary good 
clinical outcome  of approximately  20% in O-NTX participants and 40% in the XR -NTX arm , roughly the 
same as adherence rates.  This is based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], in which 36 of 40 persons completing 12 weeks 
of XR -NTX qualified for the moderate -drinking -only good clinical outcome, and COMBINE, in  which 
adherent oral naltrexone/MM patients reported high rates of the same moderate -drinking -only good clinical 
outcome during the final [ADDRESS_1179266] a 20% absolute  differe nce in the primary outcome based on the Fisher's exact test.  These 
projected rates , however, are not well established , nor based on large datasets of heterogenous alcohol 
populations, and  therefore we have increased the target screening n to 468, with a very conservative  
assumption of 2 subjects screened for every 1 enrolled, for a target sample of N= 234 and n=[ADDRESS_1179267] Effectiveness Analysis  
Preliminary analyses of balance : balance  across the study on potentially prognostic baseline  
variables  will be appraised  using analyses of variance for continuous variables and log -linear models for 
discrete and ordinal responses.  Variables  for which significant differences  were observed will  be included 
as covariates in later analyses.   Sometimes variables  with strong clinical associations with the primary 
outcome  are identified post hoc, and usually included in the analysis to reduce bias and improve  efficiency  
(yielding smaller p -values and n arrower CIs). Further, in mixed models there is always a possibility that an 
analysis will not converge. This danger is minimized by [CONTACT_848261]. 
Hence, before analyzing the primary outcome measure, the plan is to deter mine which predictive variables 
rise to a sufficient level of importance . 
 
10.1 Hypothesis  1: The rate of  the primary good clinical outcome will be approximately twice as high among 
participants receiving XR -NTX compared with those receiving O -NTX.  (Primar y Aim, Treatment 
Effectiveness :  To evaluate the effectiveness of XR -NTX vs. O -NTX in producing a primary good clinical 
outcome  defined as abstinence or moderate drinking ( <2 drinks/day, men; <1drink/day, women ; and <2 
heavy drinking occasions/month), duri ng the final 20 of 24 weeks of primary care -based  Medical 
Management for alcohol dependence)    
 The primary outcome measure of this study is a binary measure of success defined by [CONTACT_848262] , as measured by [CONTACT_75236] , with drop -outs from MM and research -only assessments 
assumed to have resumed baselin e rates of heavy drinking, and therefore defined as good clinical outcome 
failures .  Our analytic approach will be an intention -to-treat comparison of all randomized participants 
(N=234). The analysis will utilize a logistic regression with an indicator variable for treatment and covariate 
terms for baseline potential prognostic indicators that are not stratified for at randomization, including AA 
ethnicity, lead -in abstinence, medicati on preferences, baseline  drinking severity, in-trial specialty treatment 
involvement, clinical site, and OPRM1 genotype.  If the coefficient of treatment is significant the null 
hypothesis of equal treatment effect is rejected. Odds ratios will be calculate d to quantify the risk to 
treatment failure of significant predictors ( Secondary  Aim 2: Patient -Level Predictors of Effectiveness:  To 
identify patient -level characteristics  associated with effective ness in both arms ). To differentiate time to a 
good clinic al outcome failure , we will use a "cure model ." The form o f a cure model is H(t) = 1 - p + pS(t); 
where H(t) is the probability of failure at a time greater than t, p represents the probability of  failure , and S(t) 
the distribution of time to failure , condi tional on failure occurring . The parameters will be estimated based  
both on Kaplan Meier methods and parametrically. The equality of the values of p for the two treatment 
arms  will be tested  using a nonparametric likelihood ratio test. For the parametric t est, a logistic will be used 
to model p and a Weibull  survival distribution  will be used to model time to failure , S(t). Both allow the use of 
covariates, which will complement the above logistic regression approach.  
 As originally proposed, n altrexone app ears most effective at reducing heavy drinking, as opposed to 
producing complete abstinence , and all traditional alcohol treatment trial clinical endpoints, including 
continuous drinking and heavy drinking  variables , as well as  the CDT biomarker , which is specific for heavy 
drinking , are of great interest, and will be reported in the primary publication from this trial.  In addition, rates 
Protocol v7.0                              X:ON, XR-NTX vs. Oral NTX for Alcohol Dependence  
Page 16 of 27 
 of medication treatment adherence, and an alternative good clinical outcome, treatment retention AND no 
heavy drinking,  will be reported.  Treatment differences in  % days  abstinent, overall % heavy drinking days, 
time to first drink, and time to first heavy drinking day,  will be compared using mixed model repeated 
measures (MMRM) analysis including terms for subject, treat ment, and time by [CONTACT_9866], and 
covariate terms for baseline variables.  To examine differential treatment effects at each week, we will 
perform tests of simple main effects.  The MMRM will assume a means model, an unstructured covariance 
matri x and estimation will be based on restricted maximum likelihood. The baseline values will be adjusted 
by [CONTACT_848263].  The assumptions relating to the mixed -effects model will be reviewed by [CONTACT_848264] n ormality and to assess lack -of-fit. In case of violation of 
assumptions , a randomization test will be performed based on the same MMRM.  
 
10.2 Hypothesis 2: XR -NTX treatment will be more cost effective than O -NTX.   (Secondary  Aim 1:  Cost 
Effectiveness.   To estimate the incremental  cost effectiveness of XR -NTX vs. O -NTX both in conjunction 
with primary care -based  medical management  of alcohol dependence ). 
We will estimate the incremental cost -effectiveness  of XR -NTX compared to O -NTX. In technical 
terms the incremental cost -effectiveness is the ratio of incremental costs to incremental benefits; in lay 
terms, the incremental co st-effectiveness indicates the ‘bang for the buck’  of XR -NTX compared to O -NTX.  
The incremental cost -effectiveness of XR -NTX treatmen t compared to O -NTX treatment is equal to (Cost of 
XR-NTX minus Cost of O -NTX) divided by (Effectiveness of XR -NTX minus Effectiveness of O -NTX).  
Cost-effectiveness analysis requires estimates of costs and estimates of effectiveness. 
Consequently, we will use primary data analyses from this study (Specific Aim 1 in the proposal) to inform 
costs and effectiveness estimates in the short -term, and we will synthesize these short -term estimates with 
published reports that allow us to estimate the longer -term, do wnstream costs and effects of the changes in 
alcohol consumption observed in Specific Aim 1. We will alternatively use societal and payer perspectives 
for assessing costs, and we will use the standard discount rate of 3% for costs and benefits.[ADDRESS_1179268] to costs and benefits (i.e., a dollar today is worth more to most 
people than an inflation -adjusted dollar at some time in the future). All costs will be inflated to 2011  US $ 
using alternatively the consume r price index (CPI) for all goods and services and the CPI [INVESTIGATOR_848225] (reflecting the ongoing debate over whether the Medical services CPI [INVESTIGATOR_848226] ). 
 Short -term estimates of costs and effectiveness of XR -NTX compared with O -NTX.   Short -term 
estimates of costs and effectiveness will be obtained from primary analysis of data from the trial proposed in 
Aim 1, using a combination of pre -specified medical record and survey endpoints. Cost assessment will be 
conceptually similar to recently published analyses of the COMBINE interventions , 36,37,[ADDRESS_1179269] -effectiveness analyses because it has minimal respondent burden, is well 
validated, and it yields utilities (pre ference -based measures on a scale of 0 to 1), the desired input for cost -
effectiveness models .  Because  costs are skewed, incremental costs will be assessed using ordinary least 
squares (OLS) and median regression models with covariates for treatment inter vention and other relevant 
factors, and conditional models may be used because of cost data that may include “zeros.”  
 Longer -term estimates of costs and effectiveness .  To estimate the comparative effectiveness of XR -
NTX relative to O -NTX over longer tim e horizons than are reflected by [CONTACT_848265], we will incorporate these 
short -term results within a state -transition (Markov) computer simulation of outcomes that enables a cohort 
of hypothetical alcohol -dependent patients to be followed over time until death , and to be exposed to 
alternative alcohol interventions for specified time durations  beyond the week [ADDRESS_1179270] of alcohol interventions on long -term costs and 
benefits.91,92,93,94,95 The simulation will be able to aggregate the lifetime benefit of remitting alcohol 
dependence for designated periods of time using trial endpoints (e.g. frequen cy of heavy drinking days), 
and also can quantify benefits of the levels of improvement short of full remission (e.g. if alcohol

 dependence remits but the patient still is an at -risk drinker). The simulation will estimate lifetime costs and 
benefits over a  lifetime horizon, measured in both life -years and quality -adjusted life -years. (Quality -
adjusted life years is a preference -based, quality of life metric that considers quality of life simultaneously 
with quantity of life, and instantiates the notion that  a typi[INVESTIGATOR_848227] a greater quality of life.) In sensitivity analyses we will consider time horizons shorter than lifetime (10 
year and 20 year) because these horizons are sometimes preferred by [CONTACT_848266] , even though the 
longer, lifetime horizon is advocated by [CONTACT_68845] -Effectiveness in Health and Medicine.[ADDRESS_1179271] -effectiveness approach : The above  simulation will assume that 
the costs and benefits observed in the tr ial have varying levels of persistence. In the most pessimistic 
scenario, any treatment effect observed in the trial would wane rapi[INVESTIGATOR_848228] -up period, and 
therefore any benefits that accrue in the long -term would be attributable to the s hort-term effect , or, i n the 
more optimistic scenario, any treatment effect observed would persist indefinitely, as long as the treatment 
is continued .  Therefore, the simulation would aggregate incremental benefits of magnitude observed in the 
trial that are assumed to persist as long as the treatment is continued. The most optimistic, albeit unrealistic, 
scenario is that the treatment effect will persist indefinitely after the trial concludes, and no additional 
treatment would be necessary. Because this s cenario is unrealistic, we will only perform analyses along 
these lines as sensitivity analyses; however, we will analyze scenarios in which persistence of treatment 
effect requires select treatment “boosters” of variable duration and frequency.  
 To aggreg ate the impact of remission of partial and/or complete alcohol dependence, the simulation 
will require estimates of the impact of alcohol dependence and other alcohol use disorders (e.g. at -risk 
consumption and harmful consumption) on quantity and quality of life, and on costs. These estimates will be 
based on published reports that have aggregated the impact of alcohol on the morbidity and mortality and 
costs of specific diseases with substantial risk attributable to alcohol (e.g., hypertensive heart disea se, 
cirrhosis of liver, oral cancers, etc).[ADDRESS_1179272] of alcohol on morbidity, mortality, and costs of non -medical sequelae of alcohol 
consumption (e.g., motor vehicle  collision, arrests)[ADDRESS_1179273], stepwise procedure of 
specification (defining the structure and mathematical relationships of the var iables in the model), 
verification (otherwise known as “debugging”; making sure the model performs consistently with 
expectations across a wide range of inputs, including “stress tests” when inputs may be deliberately set to 
extreme, clinically unrealistic  values in an attempt to unmask flaws in the model), parameterization  
(inputting variable estimates based on relevant data or expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]), calibration  (making sure model 
output is similar to observed clinical output in relevant circumstances), and validation  (testing model 
performance in circumstances or clinical populations distinct from those used for model development).    
 Uncertainty:  we will estimate 95% confidence intervals around point estimates of incremental cost -
effectiveness using standard ap proaches in which vectors on the cost -effectiveness plane are identified 
corresponding to the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of incremental cost -effectiveness.  We will also create 
corresponding acceptability curves, which denote the probability that a parti cular program or programmatic 
decision is favorable given a particular willingness to pay for health benefits.  
 If the trial is negative, what’s the purpose of Aim 2?   It might be observed that, if an intervention is 
not effective, it is meaningless to es timate its cost -effectiveness. Therefore, it might appear that the 
scientific validity of Aims [ADDRESS_1179274] -effectiveness of XR -NTX versus O -NTX, we will instead use 
the simulation to ask “what is the minimum level of incremental effectiveness required for an intervention to 
deliver suffi cient value?” so that Aim [ADDRESS_1179275] $100/month more than O -NTX, how many fewer heavy -drinking days would it need to reduce 
compare d to O -NTX in order to deliver sufficient value (incremental cost -effectiveness ratio < 
$100,000/QALY) ? That way, simulation results can inform future trial design. This approach is detailed in 
our recent publication ,98 and is concordant with principles of value -of-information analysis.99

 10.3 Secondary  Aim 2:  Patient -Level Predictors of Effectiveness.   The multivariate models described for 
Aim 1, while testing the main and subsidiary hypotheses, will also be used to identify patient characteristics 
associa ted with treatment success.  We hypothesize a priori that there will be less robust effectiveness in 
both arms among women and African Americans, while pre -treatment abstinence, voluntary specialty 
alcohol treatment and Alcoholics Anonymous involvement (pa tients are not directly referred to ancillary 
treatment), and presence of the Asp40 OPRM1 SNP will be associated with treatment effectiveness.  We 
also hypothesize that these positive associations will be more pronounced within the XR -NTX arm due to 
the su stained medication adherence following each injection.  We note, however, that these analyses will be 
exploratory, as the study is not powered to carefully test these secondary hypotheses.  
 
 
11.0 Data Collection and Management  
Data recording and instrument s will be collected by [CONTACT_848267] -time using web -based CRFs and 
the NYUMC data management platform.  The NYU/HHC  CTSI and NYULMC Clinical Research Informatics 
and Data Management Unit (CRIDM) , led by [CONTACT_74572],  M.Ed., will provide clinical resear ch 
informatics and data management support  for the study.  Building on the a proprietary platform, CRIDM 
personnel will develop the additional required electronic case report forms (CRFs) to complete the data 
management system for this proposal, and work w ith study personnel to insure the completeness and 
integrity of all study data.   All data will be checked in real -time and stored in a centralized database ; all data 
will be reviewed and monitored for completeness and accuracy , and a f inal data clean will be completed 
following  the last subject  visit, following which the study database will be locked.  
 
12.0 Protection of Human Subjects  
This trial will be conducted in compliance with the current version of the protocol, current Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP), the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and all other applicable regulatory 
requirements.  We will obtain written approval of the study protocol, consent form, other supporting 
documents, and any advertising for participant recruitment from the NYUM C IRB.  Any amendments to the 
protocol or consent materials must be approved before they are implemented. Annual progress reports and 
local Serious Adverse Event (SAE) reports will be submitted to each IRB, according to its usual procedures.  
 
12.1 Potentia l Risks  
This study offers patient randomization to two forms of FDA -approved naltrexone treatment for 
alcohol dependence.  As such, the potential risks of study participation are chiefly that of data collection 
(time and effort, confidentiality), and other wise consistent with the usual care and use of these medications 
in everyday primary care practice.   
All participants will receive 24 weeks of office -based naltrexone  treatment. As with any patient 
starting naltrexone , participants in either arm may exper ience nausea, headache, and fatigue (‘naltrexone 
flu’), particularly during the initial first few days of dosing.  Nausea may be more likely with oral vs. injectable 
naltrexone . In most published naltrexone clinical trials, these side effects are well -tolerated by [CONTACT_1962], 
though it is certainly possible some patients will discontinue the medications based on these common and 
expected naltrexone side effects, as a small percentage of patients did in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], the COMBINE study, 
and the Garbutt XR -NTX effi cacy studies.2,3,[ADDRESS_1179276] been recorded, with a very low 
percentage progressing to necrosis and requiring surgical debridement, according to a 2008 FDA Alert, 
Naltrexone Injection Site Reactions  (www.fda.gov).  Our own pi[INVESTIGATOR_848229] (1 of 154 injections), in this case an older female with substantial hip adipose tissue.2  It is thought 
that mis -injection of the XR -NTX bolus into subcutaneous adipose tissue is the cause of injection site 
reactions, as opposed to proper intramuscular placement.  Study staff will be carefully trained on this issue 
Protocol v7.0                              X:ON, XR-NTX vs. Oral NTX for Alcohol Dependence  
Page [ADDRESS_1179277] identifying them as an XR -NTX patient and containing the PI’s and study phone 
numbers.  XR -NTX blockade can be ‘overridden’ due to competitive mu receptor pharmacodynamics with 
increasing doses of full mu agonists, which should provided only in a monitored medical setting such as an 
Emergency or Recovery Room.  There were no such unanticipated painful events  in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], and 
persons with chronic pain conditions requiring opi[INVESTIGATOR_848230].  
All participants will be given information concerning all of these potential risks prior to giving 
informed consent.  The informed cons ent document and informed consent quiz will in simple and plain 
language detail all of the above medication -related risks.  The Medical Management visit schedule may be 
altered to accommodate unexpected visits related to side effects and adverse events, an d study staff will be 
available by [CONTACT_74581] (all patients will be given the PI’s direct mobile 
number).   
 Otherwise this is a study of treatment for alcohol dependence, and there is no guarantee patients 
will benefit fr om either intervention, and thus remain chronic, heavy drinkers, with all of the daily and long -
term risks and hazards alcohol dependence entails.  Both arms of the study represent evidence -based, 
FDA-approved interventions designed to treat alcohol depend ence and minimize these risks, and we expect 
most patients to derive some minimal benefit from treatment.  However, at any point in the trial, patients 
who appear to be unable to stop drinking due to severe withdrawal symptoms or who are experiencing 
sever ely detrimental consequences of heavy drinking (i.e., job loss, homelessness) will be encouraged to 
seek admission to inpatient detox and specialty treatment through Bellevue Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Detox and intensive 
outpatient alcohol specialty services are immediat ely available to all participants through the Bellevue 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_848231], including same -day admissions to our detox unit, regardless of 
insurance status or ability to pay.   
These ‘risks,’ inherent to identifying and initiating treatme nt in previously out -of-treatment alcohol 
dependent patients, are common to all alcohol intervention trials and usual care, and do not seem to 
complicate Medical Management protocols.  Our recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_848204] -NTX did not, for example, refer any of 
the [ADDRESS_1179278] risk for 
withdrawal seizures, phenomena which occur in a sm all minority of alcohol dependent patients and are not 
thought to be opi[INVESTIGATOR_848232], do not experience great benefit from naltrexone treatment and 
continue to drink heavily.   
 
12.2 Confidentiality  
Participants will be asked to provide informatio n regarding a number of sensitive behaviors (e.g., alcohol 
and drug use, sexual history , and illicit activities). We will obtain a Federal Certificate of Confidentiality from 
DHS/NIH to encompass protocol activity and participant data and ensure against th e release of confidential 
information. We will provide all staff with training in their responsibilities for maintaining subject 
confidentiality; we will use unique identifiers to identify subjects in the database; all data will be kept in 
locked filing ca binets or on our secure server to which only the investigators and project manager will have 
access. Study findings will utilize only aggregate data and no publication or presentation will involve any use 
of individual information.   Data sharing of de -identified data is discussed below.

12.4 Risk/Benefit Ratio  
Most of the risks described are well defined side effects naltrexone and XR -NTX or  of on -going alcohol 
dependence . The additional risk s of naltrexone  treatment are small compared to the expected benefit of 
discontinuing alcohol use . 
 
12.[ADDRESS_1179280] will adhere to NIH’s Data Sharing Policy 
and Implementation Guidance of March 5, 2003 and NIH Grants Policy on Sharing of Unique Research 
Resources including the “Sharing of Biomedical Research Resources: Principles and Guidelines for 
Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_412163]” issued in December, 1999.  The final research data will be 
available in acceptable formats commonly accepted for documenting and supporting research findings (i.e., 
.csv, .xls).  The final research data will not contain any patient identifiers. Research data that documents, 
supports, and validates research findings will be available  after the main findings from the final research 
data set are accepted for publication and/or presented at national meetings.  Individual researchers, 
government, or other not -for-profit organizations petitioning [CONTACT_6321] for access to the data who document 
both a commitment to use the data for legitimate r esearch purposes and not to identify an individual study 
participant, and a commitment to secure use of the de -identified data including not making unauthorized 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_848233], will be provided the study dataset at no charge.   
 
12.6 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)  
12.6.1 Data Safety & Monitoring Board (DSMB)  
A safety monitoring board will be established for ongoing protocol review, including data, protocol 
compliance, safety and efficacy data, in compliance with NIH and NY U guidelines. Constition of the DSMB 
is pending  and will be presented to the IRB when complete .  All board members will meet NIH requirements 
regarding background and experience, and none will have ethical conflicts, including financial interest 
related to  study outcome. Individuals invited to serve on the board will disclose any potential conflicts in 
writing. The board will meet every six months (unless more frequent meetings are deemed necessary). [CONTACT_460772] and other research personnel report on the trial status, followed by a closed session under the direction 
of the DSMB chairperson, during which time the investigators and research team may be present. This will 
be followed by [CONTACT_74591]. Issues discussed may include t hose 
related to subject safety and benefit, whether the primary study question is being answered, conflict of 
interest, confidentiality, and ongoing study review (including AEs, SAEs, and regulatory issues). Following 
each DSMB meeting, recommendations wil l be made by [CONTACT_74592]. Lee and a final report 
(edited by [CONTACT_312348]) will be prepared and submitted to NI AAA, the NYUMC IRB, and (if required) 
the FDA.   Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_848234]; both medications are FDA -approved, their use in this trial is consistent with their FDA labeling, 
and no significant safety issues have arisen in national post -marketing use; as a comparative and cost -
effectiveness trial comparing two  efficacious treatments, full recruitment and maximal follow -up is warranted 
to ensure complete outcome data, nor would an emerging effectiveness advantage in favor of one of the 
medications present an ethical issue in terms of continuation.   
  
12.6.[ADDRESS_1179281] Manager  and Data Management staff will ensure the quality of the clinicians’  and the 
research assistants’ administration of study assessments and instruments and of integrity  of the data 
recorded through regular  reviews  and on -going data monitoring .  Integrit y of collected data : The 
identification key linking the separate charts containing the Informed Consent document and patient 
identifiers (name, signature, DOB, address, phone numbers) and the assessment instruments and study 
dataset will be stored in a locked cabinet (paper copy) as well as on a password -protected file stored on a 
secure NYUMC server, accessible only to the study staff. The study dataset will be otherwise de -identified 
Protocol v7.0                              X:ON, XR-NTX vs. Oral NTX for Alcohol Dependence  
Page [ADDRESS_1179282] access to the dataset. All 
reasonable requests for data -sharing will be accommodated after study close (see Resource and Data 
Sharing Plan).  
 
12.6.3 Procedures to Guarantee the Accuracy and Completeness of the Data during Data Collection,  Entry, 
Transmission, and Analysis  
Accuracy and completeness of the data will  be ensured by [CONTACT_74585]/HHC  CTSI and NYULMC 
Clinical Research Informatics and Data Management Unit (CRIDM) , led by [CONTACT_74572],  M.Ed., and as 
described in the Research Strategy . Study data will be managed by [CONTACT_848268] a proprietary  
web-base d e-research platform . Data will be entered using  laptops with wireless broadband internet cards 
connected to the NYUMC secure intranet , encrypted, and transmitted to CRIDM servers at NYU MC. All 
data analyses for the study will be performed by [CONTACT_848269], Eugene Laska PhD , of the Dept. of 
Psychiatry  of NYU School of Medicine. Quality control is performed as the data are being entered, and then 
at further stages of the storage and management process.  
 
12.6.4 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Death , disability, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongation hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]), congenital defects, and life 
threatening events including drug overdose will be deemed serious adverse events (SAEs) and immediately 
reported (orally and by [CONTACT_6791]) to the NYU School of Medicine  Institutional Review Board (IRB), at the time they 
are identified by [CONTACT_74587].  In addition, a written report will be filed within 72  hours 
to the IRB and to the NIAAA  program office (and FDA as indicated by [CONTACT_383890]). When 
additional clinical information becomes available, a follow -up and/or final SAE report will be filed with the 
IRB, NIAAA , and the FDA (if indicated).  
 
12.6.[ADDRESS_1179283] officer, and the original amendment approvals will be maintained in the  
regulatory file.  
 
12.6.6 Report of Changes or Amendments to the Protocol  
All proposed changes/amendments to the protocol will be filed with the IRB. IRB approval of such 
amendments will be forwarded to the NIDA project officer, and the original amendment approvals will be 
filed in the primary document manual.  
 
12.6.7 Trial Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_848235], there are no plans for interim analysis of safety or effectiveness data (see 
above). However, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_848236]. Adverse 
experience and safety contrasts will be performed as indicated, in response to recommendations by [CONTACT_978]. 
If interim analysis of safety data is deemed advisable by [CONTACT_848270], we will enact such a plan.

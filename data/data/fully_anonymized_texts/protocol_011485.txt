Number of Clinical Centers : Multicenter, approximately 35 study  center s in North America  
Objective:  
The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of IDP-126 Gel in 
subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris . The safety and efficacy of once daily application of 
IDP-126 Gel will be compared to IDP-126 Component A , IDP -126 Component B , IDP -126 Component C 
and IDP-126 Vehicle  Gel. 
Methodology:  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled, 12- week study designed to assess the 
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of IDP-[ADDRESS_929790] a clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe 
acne (defined as an Evaluator’s Global Severity Score [ EGSS] of 3 or 4), presenting with 30-100 
inflammatory facial lesions  (papules, pus tules, and nodules),  35-150 non-inflammatory facial lesions 
(open and closed comedones), and ≤ [ADDRESS_929791] visits 
include Screening, Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12, at which safety and efficacy assessments will be conducted  (Screening and Baseline may occur on the same day if no washout is 
required) . One pump of study drug will be dispensed to the s ubjects at the Baseline, Week [ADDRESS_929792]  baseline study visit (Weeks 
2, 4, 8, and 12). Subjects will apply their treatments at home, once daily  (in the evening) , as instructed by 
[CONTACT_85183] .  
The investigator will assess the subject’s face at each study visit. Information on report ed and observed 
AEs will be obtained at each visit. An abbreviated physical examination and vital sign  measurement s will 
be performed at Baseline and Week 12 (end of study ) for all subjects. Blood samples wil l be collected  
from subjects at Baseline  and Week 12, for CBC/Diff and serum  chemistry. For all female subjects of 
childbearing potential (FOCBP), urine pregnancy testing will be performed at Screening, Baseline (prior 
to randomization ), and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. Additionally , serum pregnanc y testing will be performed 
at Baseline and Week 12.  
In addition, at selected study center s, standardized photography of the face will be performed at Baseline, 
and Weeks  4, 8 and 12.  
Number of subjects planned:  
Approximately 750 subjects will be randomized in a1:1:1: 1:1 ratio to the following treatment groups:

weeks.  
• IDP-126 Vehicle  Gel applied once daily for 12 weeks.  
Criteria for evaluation:  
Primary efficacy:  
The co-primary efficacy endpoints are intended to compare the numerical superiority of once daily 
application of IDP-126 Gel with IDP-126 Vehicle  Gel and each of  the gel components (Components A , B 
and C). Specifically, the endpoints to be  summarized using descriptive and inferential statistics are:  
(1) Absolute change from Baseline to Week 12 in mean inflammatory lesion counts . 
(2) Absolute change from Baseline to Week 12 in mean non-inflammatory  lesion counts.  
(3) Percent of subjects who achieve at least a 2-grade reduction from baseline and are “c lear” or 
“almost c lear” at Week 12 based on  the Evaluator’s Global Severity Score (EGSS). 
Secondary efficacy:  
The secondary efficacy endpoints are intended to compare the numerical superiority of once daily 
application of IDP-126 Gel with IDP-126 Vehicle  Gel and each of the gel components (Components A , B 
and C). Specifically, the secondary endpoints to be summarized using descriptive statistics are:  
(1) Absolute change in i nflammatory and non-inflammatory  lesion counts from baseline at Weeks 2, 
4, and 8.  
(2) Percent of subjects who achieve at least a 2-grade reduction from baseline and are “c lear” or 
“almost c lear” at Week 2, 4, and 8 based on  the EGSS. 
(3) Mean percent  change in inflammatory and non-inflammatory  lesion counts fr om baseline at 
Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.  
Efficacy Measurements : 
Lesion Counts  
At each visit , the e valuator will count the total number of inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and 
nodules) on the subject’s face. Nodules will be counted separately , but will be included in the total 
inflammatory lesion count. At bas eline, eligible subjects may have no more than 2 nodules. Nodules will 
be included in the statistical analysis of inflammatory lesion counts. All inflammatory lesions will be counted at the same time rather than counting papules and pustules separately. The evaluator will als o 
count the total number of non-inflammatory  lesion s (open and closed comedones). The same blinded 
evaluator should perform the lesion counts and EGSS evaluations at all visits from baseline to week [ADDRESS_929803].   
Inflammatory lesions  are defined as follows:  
Papule – a small, solid elevation less than [ADDRESS_929804] of the lesion is above the surface of the 
skin.  
Pustule – a small, circumscribed elevation less than 5 mm in diameter that contains yellow -white exudate.  
Nodule – a subcutaneous lesion greater than or equal to 5 mm in diameter.  
Non-inflammatory  lesions  are defined as follows:  
Open comedones (black head)  – a lesion in which the follicle opening is widely dilated with the contents 
protruding out onto the surface of the skin.  
Closed comedones (white head)  – a lesion in which  the follicle opening is closed, but the sebaceous gland 
is enlarged by [CONTACT_685970] o f the sebum build up, which in turn causes the skin around the follicle to thin 
and become elevated with a white appearance.

 Evaluator’s Global Severity Score (EGSS)  
At each visit , the severity will be determined based on evaluator -blinded evaluations of the signs and 
symptoms of acne vulgaris. Every effort should be made to have the same evaluator assess the same 
subject at each visit. If this is not possible, the same evaluator should assess the subject at both the Baseline and Week [ADDRESS_929806] clear  Rare non-inflammatory  lesions present, with rare non -inflamed papules (papules must 
be resolving and may be hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_49194], though not pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745] -red) 
2 Mild  Some non-inflammatory  lesions are present, with few inflammatory lesions 
(papules/pustules only; no nodulo cystic lesions)  
3 Moderate  Non-inflammatory  lesions predominate, with multiple inflammatory lesions evident: 
several to many comedones and papules/pustules, and there may or may not be 
1 nodulocystic lesion  
4 Severe  Inflammatory lesions are more apparent, many comedones and papules/pustules, there  
may or may not be up to 2 nodulo cystic lesions  
 
Safety Measurements:  
Safety evaluations will include the following:  
- The percent of subjects who experience a cutaneous reaction (erythema, scaling,  
hypo/hyper -pi[INVESTIGATOR_371],  itching, burning, or stinging) graded at a level of [ADDRESS_929807] application of study drug.  
- The percent of subjects who experience a cutaneous adverse event ( AE) irrespective of severity 
grade at any point in the study f ollowing the first application of study drug . 
- Changes from b aseline in all safety laboratory values and vital sign measurements as summarized 
using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_67486].  
- Subjects will be assessed for the occurrence of n ew and ongoing AEs.  
Cutaneous safety and tolerability will be evaluated by [CONTACT_85169] (scaling, erythema, hypo/hyper -pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], itching, burning, and 
stinging) to be assessed at each study  visit.  Itching, burning and stinging (c utaneous tolerability) will be 
reviewed with the subject at each study visit as an average over the period since the previous visit. 
Scaling , erythema , and hypo/hyper -pi[INVESTIGATOR_371]  (cutaneous s afety) will be assessed  by [CONTACT_85170]. Cutaneous tolerability signs and symptoms that result in the subject requiring a concomitant 
therapy, interruption of treatment, or discontinuation from the study will be reported as an AE.  
Statistical Methods  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® version 9.[ADDRESS_929808] the reviewer in evaluating the outcome of 
the study. Failure to achieve a statistically significant result at an alpha level of 0.05 does not imply a failed study.  
The absolute change in mean inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesion counts f rom b aseline to Week 12 
will be analyzed with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with factors of treatment group  and analysis 
center  and a covariate of their respective baseline lesion count. A non- parametric analysis may be used. 
Additionally, [ADDRESS_929809] a 2-grade improvement f rom b aseline in 
the EGSS and an EGSS equating to “clear” or “almost clear” , will be analyzed with a logistic regression 
test with factors of treatment group and analysis center and a covariate of baseline severity at Week  12. 
Four  pairwise tests will be conducted comparing the IDP-126 Gel to IDP-126 Vehicle  Gel and IDP-126

 Gel to each of the dual component gels.  
The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be MCMC multiple imputation . Other 
methods, as well as the MCMC  imputation, will be specified in the statistical analysis pla n which will be 
finalized prior to data base lock.  
Populations Analyzed and Treatment Groups:  
Inflammatory and non-inflammatory  lesion co unts will be recorded for each s ubjec t at baseline and at 
Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. The ab solute and percent change from baseline in inflammatory and non-
inflammatory  lesions will be derived for each subject at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.  
The EGSS will be recorded for each s ubject. The EGSS will be dichotomized into “success” and “failure” 
with a s ubject considered a success if the EGSS at Week s 2, 4, 8, and [ADDRESS_929811] 2 grades less than 
baseline and achieving “clear” or “almost c lear.”  
An intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis will be conducted on all study subjects. The ITT population will consist 
of all randomized subjects who received study drug. 
The safety population will consist  of all randomized subjects who are presumed to have used the study 
drug at least once and who provide at least [ADDRESS_929812] -baseline evaluation. A per -protocol (PP) analysis will 
also be conducted. Subjects will be eligible for the PP analysis if they complete the 12 -week evaluation 
without notewort hy study protocol violations ( i.e., any s ubject or investigator activity that could have 
possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration of the treatment or the precise evaluation of treatment efficacy). The PP population will include subjects in the ITT population who do not meet any of 
the following criteria:  
• Failed any of t he inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
• Have taken any inte rfering concomitant medications.  
• Did not attend the Week [ADDRESS_929813].  
• Missed more than [ADDRESS_929814] baseline study visit prior t o Week 12  
• Have  not been compl iant with the dosing regimen ( i.e., subjects may not miss more than [ADDRESS_929815] take 80%- 120% of expected doses ). The number of expected 
doses will be determined for each subject based on the length of  their participation in the study.  
• Out of visit window at the Week [ADDRESS_929816] demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_685971], PP, and safety analysis sets.  
Efficacy Evaluation:  
Primary:  
Co-primary efficacy analyses of the absolute change in inflammatory and in non-inflammatory  lesions, 
from baseline, will be conducted on the ITT population. The pre -specified time point will be Week 12. 
Descriptive statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_685972]-inflammatory  
lesions as well as the absolute change in inflammatory and in non-inflammatory  lesions. All of the testing 
relating to the analysis of inflammatory and non-inflammatory  lesions will use the methods introduced in 
Section 12 of the protocol . 
The co -primary analysis of the dichotomized EGSS (success being at least a 2 -grade improvement and 
achieving “clear” or “almost c lear”) for the ITT population will be based on the logistic regression  test 
with factors of treatment group and analysis center and a covariate of baseline severity . 
Secondary:  
Mean percent change in inflammatory and non-inflammatory  lesion counts from baseline, as well as 
proportion of subjects with at least a 2 -grade improvement in the EGSS from baseline, will be evaluated at

 Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.  
Safety Evaluation:  
All subjects who receive medication and provide at least [ADDRESS_929818] -baseline evaluation will constitute the 
safety population. Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_85172], Cutaneous Safety and Tolerability Evaluations, vital signs/abbreviated physical examinations, and safety laboratory results.  
Cutaneous Safety and Tolerability  Evaluation scores (erythema, scaling, hypo/hyper -pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], 
itching, burning, and stinging) will be presented with descriptive statistics at baseline and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and [ADDRESS_929819] 
results will be provided.  
All previous concomitant medications will be classified based on terminology from the World Health 
Organization Drug Dictionary. Previous therapi[INVESTIGATOR_685963].  
All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. Descriptions of AEs will incl ude the date of onset, the date 
the AE ended, the severity of the AE, the relationship to study drug, the action taken regarding study drug  
usage, the action taken to treat the AE, and the outcome. Adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_22975] s everity. Each subject will be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term 
by [CONTACT_85174].  
Adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_85175]. Each subject will 
be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term by [CONTACT_264724].  
All information pertaining to AEs noted during the study will be listed by [CONTACT_1130], detailing the verbatim 
descriptions given by [CONTACT_093], preferred term, system organ class, start date, stop date, severity, 
actions taken, and drug relatedness. The AE onset will also be shown relative (in number of days) to the day of initial dose of the randomized study drug . 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_85177]. In addition, a list of 
subjects who discontinued from the study and a list of subjects who experienced SAEs will also be 
provided.

Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_929831] prevalent among 
teenagers, usually triggered by [CONTACT_85179] (Krakowski 2008). Although acne generally resolves by [CONTACT_14898] 25, approximately 3% to 
8% of adults 25 to 44 years of age present with acne ( Goodman 2006, White 1998). The 
pathogenesis is complex and appears to involve 4 primary features: stimulation of sebum gland activity, bacterial proliferation (especially Propi[INVESTIGATOR_76494]), abnormal follicular hyperkeratinization an d resultant obstruction of the sebaceous follicles, and the 
release of inflammatory mediators (Thiboutot 2009) . These changes in acne patients result in 
the formation of clinical inflammatory lesions including superficial pustules such as comedones (popularly know n as “blackheads” or “whiteheads”) and more deeply located 
papules, nodules, and cysts ( Krakowski 2008) . The areas most affected by [CONTACT_85180][INVESTIGATOR_85134], where the sebaceous glands are particularly active (Webster 2002). 
Given the complexity of the pathogenic mechanisms that lead to acne, for maximum efficacy,  consensus guidelines recommend the use of combination therapy consisting of 
medications with different, but complementary, mechanisms of action ( Thiboutot 2009) . In 
particular, the guidelines advocate the use of a retinoid and an antibiotic (eg, clindamycin phosphate) or antibacterial (eg,  benzoyl peroxide [ BPO ]) as first -line and maintenance 
therapy in patients with both inflammatory and non-inflammatory  lesions ( Ghali 2009, 
Thiboutot 2009).  
Although antibiotics like clindamycin were among the first effective treatments for acne, 
recent acne management guidelines discourage the use of antibiotics as monotherapy due to the development of bacterial resistance (Nast 2012 , Thiboutot 2009). The guidelines also 
recom mend limiting both the frequency and duration of antibiotic use for acne, and to use 
antibiotics in conjunction with BPO to minimize the development of resistance at sites of application ( Thiboutot 2009). Topi[INVESTIGATOR_85135], comedolytic, and 
anti-inflammatory, and  has bactericidal activity against Propi[INVESTIGATOR_76494]  (Gollnick 
2003, Harper 2010, Tanghetti 2009). To date, there is no evidence of P acnes  resistance to 
BPO (Harper 2010 ). Further, the combination of BPO with chemical structures that contain a 
tertiary amine within their structure, such as clindamycin, increases the generation of BPO radicals and thereby [CONTACT_85181] a r eal biologic synergism (Burkhart 2008) that contributes to 
their complementary effects on acne pathogenesis.  
Retinoids (eg, adapalene, tretinoin, tazarotene) are anticomedogenic, anti -inflammatory, and 
inhibit microcomedone formation ( Ghali 2009, Zaenglein 2008). Topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], daily retinoid 
monotherapy is used to inhibit the formation of comedones and usually clear even severe comedonal acne within a few months ( Shalita 2001). Adapalene, a synthetic retinoid, is a

19 
 naphthoic acid derivative with retinoid -like properties. In the cell, adapalene can bind 
specifically to retinoic acid nuclear (and not cytosolic) receptors to exert its effects 
(Zaenglein 2008) . Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that 
adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization, and inflammatory processes (Pi[CONTACT_49230] 2007). Topi[INVESTIGATOR_85136] (US) for more than [ADDRESS_929833] also been paired with antibiotic/BPO fixed-dose combination products 
(Bowman 2005, Del Rosso 2007, Kircik 2007, Tanghetti 2006) and, consistently across 
studies of these products, regimens that included a topi[INVESTIGATOR_685964] ( Thiboutot 2009). Adapalene (0.1% gel and cream formulations) has a 
lower  irritation potential relative to other retinoids  (Dosik 2005a , Dosik 2005b) and is 
theref ore well suited for use in combination topi[INVESTIGATOR_85138], particularly those containing 
BPO, which is also potentially irritating (Del Rosso 2007).  
Thus, treatment with a combination of topi[INVESTIGATOR_85139], BPO, and adapalene can be expected to provide optimal overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_85140]: each of these agents has some degree of anti -inflammatory activity; both the antibiotic an d BPO decrease 
P acnes  proliferation ( Weiss 2004) ; BPO is also keratolytic (Harper 2010) ; and adapalene 
additionally regulates keratinization (Zaenglein 2008 ).  
A fixed -dose combination treatment is optimal to enhance patient adherence due to 
simplified application re gimens (eg, once daily versus sequential morning/evening 
administration  of each active agent ) and also to preclude substance incompatibilities due to 
application errors (eg, oxidation by [CONTACT_85182]) ( Thielitz 2013) . Of 
note, when an adapalene 0.1% gel and a clindamycin 1.2%/BPO 5% fixed-dose combination gel were combined in equal amounts by [CONTACT_8497], there was no resultant instability of any of the active components for up to 24 hours ( Bikowski 2006).  
The current study is intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IDP-126 Gel , a novel 
fixed -dose combination of clindamycin phosphate, BPO, and adapalene (1.2 %/3.1%/0.15%), 
relative to its vehicle and dual component combinations ( BPO /Adapalene, clindamycin/BPO  
and clindamycin/adapalene) for the treatment of acne vulgaris in subjects 9 years of age and 
older.

 6 Study Objectives and Purpose   
The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of once daily  
application of IDP-126 Gel  compared with each of its dual components ( IDP-126 Component 
A Gel , IDP -126 Component B Gel and IDP-126 Component C Gel) and vehicle ( IDP-126 
Vehicle Gel) in subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris.  
7 Investigational Plan 
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel -group study 
designed to assess the safety , efficacy and tolerability of IDP-[ADDRESS_929835] a clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe acne vulgaris (a score of  
3 or 4 [moderate to severe] on the Evaluator’s Global Severity Scale [ EGSS ]), presenting 
with 30-100 inflammatory  facial lesions (papules, pustules, and nodules), 35 -150 non-
inflammatory  facial lesions (open and closed comedones), and ≤ 2 facial nodules.  
Approximately 750 subjects will be enrolled into this study and randomized into 1 of 
5 treatment groups  in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio:  
• 150 subjects to receive IDP-126 Gel , once daily  application  
• 150 subjects to receive IDP-126 Component A Gel, once daily  application  
• 150 subjects to receive IDP-126 Component B Gel, once daily  application  
• 150 subjects to receive IDP -126 Component C Gel, once daily application 
• 150 subjects  to receive IDP-126 Vehicle Gel , once daily application  
Subjects will be enrolled at approximately  35 independent study centers. The duration of 
treatment will be 12 weeks. Subjects will be evaluated at Screening, Baseline , and at 
subsequent follow-up visits (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12). 
An interactive web based response system (IWRS) will be employed to facilitate 
randomization of study subjects . Treatment assignments and study drug kit numbers will be 
generated centrally by [CONTACT_220137] S. At each study center , subject numbers will be assigned 
consecutively at the S creening visit, starting with 001. 
The assigned study drug will be applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_85141], in the 
evening,  for 12 weeks  (up to the evening prior to the Week 12 visit), with the exception of 
study visit days (Baseline, Week 2, 4 and 8) where study drug will be appl ied (also by [CONTACT_1560]) after the study visit is completed, at the investigational center . The initial application 
will be done at the investigational center  as per instruction from the study coordinator or

Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_929836] a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 and 
protective clothing ( eg, a hat) is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Subjects 
will apply their daily treatments at home as explained by [CONTACT_85183]. During post baseline study visits (Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12), the subjects will 
be asked to return the ir used pumps of study drug and will be dispensed new pumps of study 
drug ( new pumps dispensed on Weeks 4 and 8 only ; Week [ADDRESS_929837] no new study drug 
dispensed; and Week 12 will be final visit) . During the study, each subject will only be 
permitted to use approved, non- medicated  cleans ers, moisturizers , and sunscreens . 
During the study, s ubjects will be asked to complete the  Acne -Specific Quality of Life 
questionna ire (Acne-QoL, Appendix 17.3). The Investigator assessments (EGSS, lesion 
counts) will be conducted independently of this  subject self -assessment . The EGSS should be 
completed prior to the lesion counts.  The Acne -QoL questionnaire will be completed at 
Baseline and Week 12 . Inferential statistical analyse s will not be performed on the 
questionnaire; the subjective responses will be compared between treatment groups for trends. Information on reported and observed adverse events (AEs) will be obtained at each visit. An abbreviated physical examination, along with vital sign measurements , will be 
performed at Baseline and Week 12 (end of study , final visit) for all subjects.  
Blood samples will be collected from subjects at Baseline and Week 12 for CBC/Diff and 
serum chemistry.  For all female subjects of childbearing potential (FOCBP) , urine 
pregnancy testing will be performed at Screening, confirmed at prior to randomization at 
Baseline, and then repeated at Weeks 2, 4, [ADDRESS_929838] will also be 
conducted at Baseline and Week 12. 
Subjects who terminate their study participation early will be asked to complete all Week 12 
assessments, as appropriate. Subjects who discontinue from the study during the treatm ent 
period will not be replaced.

the 3 -digit chronological screening number, starting with 001 (eg, 101001, 101002). The IWRS 
will assign the study drug kit to  subjects based on a randomization code ; the kit will be dispen sed 
to the subjects at Baseline  and Weeks 4 and 8 by [CONTACT_85192] . A study drug log will 
document the inventory, dispensing , and collecting  of study drug at each study center.  
9.2 Randomization and Blinding  
The study drugs will be packaged and labeled identically, and the study drug kits will be numbered sequentially and dispensed randomly to the subjects entering the study within each study center . Study drug supplies will be distr ibuted to the study center s to maintain the 
randomization ratio within each study center .  
As a double-blind study, the investigators /evaluators , the study center  staff, the Sponsor, and the 
clinical monitors will not be aware of the treatment assigned to the individual study subjects. 
Delegated staff members at each study center  will dispense the study drugs and will collect all 
used and unused study drug pumps as scheduled.  
9.3 Unblinding  
The treatment assignments for all enrolled subjects will be unblinded only after the conclusion of the study. Specifically, the blind will be broken only after all data are verified, entered into the 
database, and validated; subject evaluability assessments are performed and entered into the 
database; and the database is locked.

minutes before bedtime , for a period of 12 weeks, with the exception of study visit days 
(Baseline, Week  2, 4, and 8) where study drug will be applied by [CONTACT_85199] . The study drug will be applied as a thin coating that is 
gently rubbed into the skin. Study drug use will be limited to the face.  
The investigator and/or trained study center  staff member will instruct the subject on the proper 
study drug application procedure during  the Baseline visit (see Appendix 17.1). All subjects will 
be instructed to apply the study drug at approximately the same time every day for 12 weeks , 
after cleansing  with an investigator -approved cleanser. On study visit days (Baseline, Weeks 2,

33 4, and 8) subjects should be instructed to wait until the end of their study visit to apply study 
medication at the investigational site (note, this will affect evening application times on study visit days, which is acceptable. Subjects should not apply another dose of study drug in the evening on the study visit days). No time interval between dosing and meals or any other activity is specified. Study center  personnel oversight of a subject’s  on-site application of study drug is 
required at Baseline, Week 4 and Week 8, to ensure training /reinforcement  of proper application 
technique.  
During daily application, s ubjects will be instructed to gently wash their face s with a n 
investigator-approved, non- medicated  cleanser and warm (not hot) water. After washing, the 
subjects will be asked to thoroughly rinse and gently pat their faces dry. The subjects should use 
the pump to dispense one pea size amount of the study drug onto the fingertip.  The study drug 
gel should be dotted onto 6 areas  of the face: the chin, left cheek, right cheek, nose, left forehead, 
and right forehead. After distributing the gel in this manner, the subject should gently rub the gel 
into the skin. This amount of drug should be sufficient to cover the entire face excluding the mouth, eyes, inside the nose, and lips. It is important for the subject to treat their entire face (excluding the mouth, eyes and lips) and they should be instructed NOT to treat only specific lesions. The subjects  should gently smooth the study drug over the face evenly. The study drug 
should become invisible almost immediately following application with gentle rubbing. If this does not happen, the investigator should instruct the subject on the use of a smaller dosage. The subject should wash his/her hands after applying the study drug to the face.  Subjects should also 
be instructed to place the cap back onto the pump after every use. 
At each study visit, study staff will review the subject instructions for application of study drug 
to ensure proper use and compliance with application. The subjects will be instructed to continue 
using the same investigator -approved, non- medicated  facial cleanser , moisturizer , and sunscreen, 
and not to change products during the study. At each visit, subjects are to be asked if they have changed their cleansing routine. Facial makeup may be applied according to the subject’s normal daily routine; however, subjects should be instructed not to wear makeup during study visits as it 
may interfere with the evaluator’s assessments. Subjects must also agree to use non -
comedogenic makeup during the study if they use makeup. No other products should be used on 
the face.  Subjects should be instructed to minimize sun exposure and to use investigator-
approved, non- medicated  sunscreens of at least SPF 15 and to wear protective clothing during 
the day ( eg, a hat)  if exposure cannot be avoided.  
Subjects should be instructed to store the study drug at room temperature.  If a subject loses or 
misplaces the pump cap at any point during the study, the subject should contact [CONTACT_85200] a replace ment  pump.

The EGSS assessments and lesion counts will be performed at each study visit. The EGSS 
assessments will be collected before  the lesion counts. All s ubject assessments will be performed 
by a trained and validated evaluator. Every effort should be made to have the same evaluator 
assess the same s ubject at each visit. If this is not possible, the same evaluator should assess the 
subject at both the Baseline and Week 12 visits.

The EGSS will be a static assessment that is independent of the baseline score. The investigator 
will make the asses sment without referring to the baseline value. Every eff ort should be made for 
the same evaluator to perform each study assessment for the same study subject, for consistency 
in evaluations.

Tolerability will be evaluated through an assessment, at the time of the study visit, of selected 
local symptoms ( i.e., symptoms present at the study drug application site) that include itching , 
burning, and stinging . The subject will self -assess all tolerability symptoms; the assessment will 
be based on an average over the period since the previous study visit. 
Tolerability symptoms that result in the subject’s requiring a concomitant therapy, interruption of 
treatment, or discontinuation from the study, will be reported as an AE. 
Itching:

11.3.3 Medical History and Abbreviated Physical Examination 
A med ical history will be taken at Screening , and confirmed and revised if needed, at Baseline. 
Medical histories having resolved 2 or more years before Baseline need not be collected unless 
considered relevant by [CONTACT_093].  
An abbreviated physical examination including measurements of weight and vital signs (blood 
pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and oral temperature) wil l be performed at Screening , 
Baseline and Week 12 ( end of treatment/study ); height will also be measured , but only at the 
Screening visit. Any abnormal physical exam ination  findings will be recorded. 
11.3.4 Laboratory Tests 
Clinical laboratory analyses ( CBC/Diff and serum chemistry ) will be conducted on blood 
samples collected from subjects at Baseline and Week 12. All results will be reported, including results that are abnormal. Clinically significant results, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], should be reported as AEs. If an AE should require laboratory testing, the results of the test must be obtained by [CONTACT_85207]’s documentation.  
For pre- menses females and FOCBP , a serum pregnancy test will be conducted at Baseline and 
Week 12.  
11.3.5 Pregnancy Tests  
All females who are pre- menses and FOCBP  will undergo serum pregnancy testing at the 
Baseline and W eek 12  study visits, and urine pregnancy testing at Screening, prior to 
randomization at Baseline, and at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12. The urine pregnancy tests will be 
supplied by [CONTACT_2024]/designee.

of causal relationship to the study drug(s) under study. AEs  include any illness, sign, symptom, 
or out-of-range and clinically significant laboratory finding that has appeared or worsened during the course of the clinical trial, regardless of causal relationship to the study. The collection of nonserious AEs and SAEs  will begin following the subject's completion of the consent process to 
participate in the study.

Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_929900] 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  
44 11.4.2 Documenting Adverse Experiences  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs that occur during the course of the 
study. The AEs should be documented as a single medical diagnosis. When this is not possible, the AE should be documented in terms of signs and/or symptoms observed by [CONTACT_85208]. Each AE which appears to be independent of any prior event will be reported separately.  
All AEs occurring after the subject signs the informed consent through the last study visit must be reported, regardless of whether or not the AEs are considered study drug-related. All AEs, 
whether in response to a query, observed by [CONTACT_85209], or reported 
spontaneously by [CONTACT_423], will be recorded. Any AEs deemed related to treatment reported or observed at the final study/treatment visit will be followed until stabilization or resolution (or up to 30 days after final study visit). 
At each visit during the study, the subject will be assessed for the occurrence of new and ongoing 
AEs. Cutaneous safety and tolerability signs and symptoms that result in the subject’s requiring a 
concomitant therapy , interruption of treatment, or discontinuation from the study will be reported 
as an AE. The following data will be collected on all AEs and recorded on the appropriate e CRF:  
• Event description (diagnosis preferred, if unknown, record the signs/symptoms) 
• Onset date and end date 
• Maximum intensity (severity)  
• Seriousness 
• Action taken regarding study drug 
• Corrective treatment, if give n 
• Outcome 
In addition, the investigator’s assessment of causality will be recorded. 
Vital sign abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if they are clinically significant (for 
example: are symptomatic, requiring corrective treatment, leading to discontinuation or fulfilling a seriousness criterion).

were more severe) . 
• requires i n patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22215] a baseline condition is not considered an AE). 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (permanent or substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions). 
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
• is a medically important event that may not be immediately life threatening or result 
in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the above listed outcomes ; examples of such 
events include, but are not limited to, allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
Note: A spontaneous abortion will be considered an SAE and must be reported per Reporting of SAEs under Section 11.4.6. 
11.4.4 Assessment of Severity  
The severity assigned to an AE should be determined by [CONTACT_85210]. The 
categories described below should be used to estimate the severity of AEs:  
• Mild: Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no  medical 
intervention/therapy required. 
• Moderate: Mild to moderate limitation in activity; some assistance may be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required . 
• Severe: Marked limitation in activity; some assistance usually required; medical 
intervention/therapy required; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85153]; may be incapacitating or life threatening . 
11.4.5 Assessment of Causality  
The investigator should assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the study drug as e ither 
“Related” or “Not Related .” The following should be taken into account when assessing AE/SAE 
causality:  
• Related: There is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE/SAE is related to the 
study drug. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship  between the drug and the AE. 
• Not Related: There is little or no reasonable possibility that the AE/SAE is related to 
the study drug. This assessment implies that the AE/SAE has little or no temporal

46 relationship to  the study drug and/or a more likely or certai n alternative etiology 
exists.  
11.4.6 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse events classified as “serious” require expeditious handling and reporting to sponsor or 
designee within [ADDRESS_929904] within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the event. 
All SAEs must be reported via confirmed facsimile  or email  transmission and must be submitted 
on a written SAE report form signed by [CONTACT_19452] 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the event.  
The contact(s)  for reporting an SAE are: 
 
 
 
Inves
tigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully docum ent the event 
before notifying medical monitor and Sponsor of an SAE. If only limited information is initiall y 
available, follow-up reports are required. Additional relevant information such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_500797]. 
Should the investigator become aware of an SAE (regardless of its relationship to study drug ) 
that occurs within [ADDRESS_929905] be reported in accordance 
with procedures specified in this protocol. 
All deaths of subjects, regardless of cause, and which are known to the Investigator will be 
reported on the appropriate eCRF for up to 30 days after the administration of study drug, regardless of the Investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_85155]. Documentation of the subject’s cause of death and a copy of the autopsy or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85156]. The Medical Monitor and CRO contact  [INVESTIGATOR_9960] 24 hours of knowledge of the event 
by [CONTACT_756] (and/or facsimile/email) of all subject deaths. Written follow -up must be received 
by [CONTACT_85211]/IEC  within five ( 5) calendar days of initial notification.

Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_929906] 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  
47 The investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the subjects, notably 
he/she should follow a subject with an SAE until the event has resolved or the condition has stabilized. This may imply that follow -up will continue after the subject has left the study, and 
that additional investigations may be requested by [CONTACT_1034]. When a SAE persist s at the end 
of the study, the investigator will conduct follow-up conta cts with the subject until the 
investigator/Sponsor agree the event is satisfactorily resolved and/or stabilized. If at any time 
after 30 days after administration of study drug, the investigator becomes aware of an SAE which he/she feels is related to study drug or procedure, this must also be reported immediately (within 24 hours of knowledge of occurrence) by [CONTACT_85212]/email to the medical monitor and Sponsor and/or Sponsor designee. 
11.4.7 Expedited Serious Adverse Event Reports  
An AE, whether serious or nonserious, is designated unexpected (unlabeled) if it is not reported 
in the clinical safety section of the Investigator Brochure or if it is of greater frequency, specificity , or severity  than what is reported in the clinical safety  section of the Investigator 
Brochure . 
Expedited SAE reports are those that are both unexpected based on the reference document (Investigator Brochure) and are related (i.e.,  the relationship cannot be ruled out) to the study 
drug. These expedited reports are subject to reporting timelines of 7 and/or 15 calendar days to the regulatory reporting agency(ies). The Sponsor will notify regulatory authorities of these AEs 
and all p articipating study center s in writing for submission by [CONTACT_85213]/IEC. 
This notification will be in the form of a safety u pdate to the Investigator Brochure ( i.e., a “15 -
day letter”).  
Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice with the Investigator Brochure and immediately submit a copy of this information to the responsible IRB/IEC according to local regulations. The investigator and IRB/IEC will determine if the informed consent requires revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB/IEC procedures for reporting any other safety information.

If a subject or investigator suspects that the subject may be pregnant prior to study enrollment, 
the study drug must be withheld until the results of laboratory pregnancy testing are available. If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive study drug and must not be enrolled in the study. If pregnancy is suspected while the subject is receivin g study drug, the study drug must 
immediately be withheld until the result of pregnancy testing is known. If pregnancy is confirmed, the study drug will be permanently discontinued and the subject will be followed until the pregnancy comes to term. A Pregnancy Report F orm will be submitted to the sponsor, 
initially and at the end of the pregnancy, which includes the outcome of the pregnancy and any complications occurring during the pregnancy or the delivery. If any SAEs are associated with 
the pregnancy, including spontaneous abortion/miscarriage, an SAE form must be filled out in addition to the Pregnancy Report Form and submitted as per section  11.4.6.  
All confirmed pregnancies must be immediately reported to the medical monitor and CRO 
contact [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the pregnancy. All confirmed 
pregnancies are to be reported on a pregnancy form using the same reporting procedure for an 
SAE under Section 11.4.6.

All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® version 9.3 or later unless otherwise 
stated. Statistical significance will be based on 2-tailed tests of the null hypothesis resulting in 
p-values of 0.05 or less . 
A statistical analysis plan, describing all statistical analyses will be provided as a separate document. The SAP will be finalized prior to unblinding of the study treatments. 
All efficacy assessments will be conducted using both the intent- to-treat (ITT) (primary) and

1. Calculate the number of missing values to be estimated by [CONTACT_85222] (nmiss) for 12 -week 
value.  
2. Create a data set, one for each treatment group, of subjects with observed values and those needing estimation by [CONTACT_85222].  The missing EGSS values in each data set will be filled in using the MCMC method ‘5 x nmiss’ times to genera te ‘5 x nmiss’ data sets. The

Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_929925]  9 years of age and older with moderate or severe acne ( a 
score of 3 or 4 [mode rate to severe] using the EGSS ) will be enrolled and randomized in the 
study. With a1:1:1:1:1  randomization ratio, it is anticipated that: 
• 150 subjects to receive IDP-126 Gel , once daily  application  
• 150 subjects to receive IDP-126 Component A Gel, once daily  application  
• 150 subjects to receive IDP-126 Component B Gel, once daily  application  
• 150 subjects to receive IDP -126 Component C Gel, once daily application  
• [ADDRESS_929926] baseline evaluation. 
An ITT analysis will be conducted on all study subjects. A PP analysis will also be conducted. 
Subjects will be eligible for the PP analysis if they complete the 12 -week evaluation without 
noteworthy study protocol violations (i.e., any subject or investigator activity that could have 
possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration of the study drug or the precise evaluation of study drug efficacy). The PP analysis set  will include subjects in the safety analysis set  who 
do not meet any of the following c riteria:  
• Failed any of the inclusion/exclusion criteria . 
• Have taken any interfering concomitant medications . 
• Did not attend the Week [ADDRESS_929927] . 
• Missed more than [ADDRESS_929928] baseline study visit prior to Week 12. 
• Have not been compliant with the dosing regimen (i.e., s ubjects may not miss more 
than [ADDRESS_929929] take 80%-120% of expected doses; t he 
number of expected doses will be determined for each subject based on the length of 
their participation in the study) . 
• Out of visit window at the 12-week visit. 
Prior to breaking the blind, other additional criteria may be added to the list to accommodate for unforeseen events that occurred during the conduct of the study that result in noteworthy study protocol violations.  
The safety population will be comprised of all randomized subjects who are presumed to have 
used the study medication at least once and who provide at least one post- baseline safety 
evaluation.

The sample size for this study is based on clinical considerations only. No formal sample size 
calculation was performed. A total of approximately 750 randomized subjects are planned for 
this study, including 150 subjects each in the IDP-126 Gel , IDP-126 Component A Gel, IDP-126 
Component B Gel, IDP-126 Component C Gel, and in the IDP-126 Vehicle  Gel groups. The 
numbers of subjects in each study drug group are considered adequate to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IDP-126 Gel  in the treatment of acne vulgaris. 
12.8.3 Handling of Missing Data 
Missing 12 week data will be estimated by [CONTACT_685979]. The details of this method as well as other methods will be specified in the statistical analysis plan, which will be finalized prior to database lock. (see Section 12.1.6).  
12.8.4 Multicenter Issues  
The study will be conducted at multiple study center s in North America with the intention of 
pooling the results for analysis. Every effort will be made to promote consistency in study execution at each investigational site. The study is intended to be conducted in a manner such that a minimum of 5 subjects will be enrolled in each treatment arm for any investigator. In the event  that there are too few subjects in a treatment arm for an investigator, then this investigator's 
data will be combined to achieve the desired sample size minimum per arm. The combining of investigator's data will be accomplished by [CONTACT_685981]. If there is a further need to combine data, then the data of the investigator with the second smallest enrollment will be combined with the investigator's data which had the second largest enrollment, and so on. This process will continue for all investigators who did not have a minimum of [ADDRESS_929931] insufficient subjects per treatment arm will result in redefining the groups of investigators for the purposes of statistical analyses. These combined groups will be referred to as "analysis centers" in the statistical analyses based on ANCOVA and stratified logistic testing.  
Prior to investigating the treatment effect within the analysis centers, the magnitude of the 
investigational site effect will be investigated to determine if the site -to-site variability is such 
that it could mask the analysis center effects. Change from baseline in inflammator y lesions and 
non-inflammatory lesions will be analyzed with an ANCOVA (unranked or ranked) with factors of treatment, investigational site, and treatment by [CONTACT_685982] a covariate.  For the purpose of testing consistency of 
treatment response, the dichotomized EGSS will be analyzed with a logistic regression procedure with factors of treatment, investigational site, and treatment by [CONTACT_264717]. Investigational sites with low enrollment that interfere with the logistic regression will be removed.

Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_929932] at an alpha level of 0.10. Change 
from baseline in inflammatory lesions and non- inflammatory lesions will be analyzed with an 
ANCOVA (unranked or ranked) with factors of treatment, analysis center, and treatment by [CONTACT_85218] a covariate. For the purpose of testing consistency of treatment response, the dichotomized EGSS will be analyzed with a logistic regression procedure. Further examination will follow f or any variables 
that have a significant ANCOVA or logistic regression interaction term. In the event that the ANCOVA or logistic regression interaction (referred to henceforth as the "appropriate test") p-value is less than or equal to 0.10, a sensitivity analysis that excludes analysis centers with the 
extreme efficacy result will be performed to determine the robustness of the treatment effect. On the other hand, if the outcome of the appropriate test has a p-value greater than 0.10, then the conclusions from the pooled data will be considered to be free of the impact of extreme analysis centers.  
The first step in conducting a sensitivity analysis is to identify the extreme analysis center or centers that contribute to the statistical significance of the appropriate test. The process involves 
submitting subsets of analysis centers to the appropriate test and observing the appropriate test p-value for the subset. Subsets with p-values greater than 0.[ADDRESS_929933] been identified, then the treatment p -values of the remaining analysis centers will be computed. Inferences will be drawn 
from the treatment p -value, as well as any pertinent observations regarding the extreme analysis 
center or centers.

Précis 
 
Specific Aims.  Diabetes affects 1 in 10 persons in the [LOCATION_002] and is projected to increase to 1 in 4 
persons by 2050 (1), resulting in a 72% increase in health care costs (2, 3).  Women with type [ADDRESS_449044] worse glycemic control and diabetes self-care behaviors than men with type 2 diabetes (4-6).  One reason for these poor outcomes is the influence of depression which affects over 25% of women with diabetes (7).  
 
Depression interferes with self-care behaviors and signi ficantly impacts glycemic control in women with type 2 
diabetes (8-12).  Although there is significant research to indicate that depression can negatively affect diabetes self-management (8-10), there is limited evi dence on whether treating depression can improve self-
management (13-15).  Antidepressants can effectively re lieve depression and its related symptoms in persons 
with type 2 diabetes (16, 17). However, these medications can also disrupt glycemic control (18-20) and cause weight gain (21, 22) making diabetes self-management more challenging.  
 
Vitamin D is being studied for its effects on depression (23-26). Cross sectional studies report that low vitamin D levels are associated with depressive symptoms (depression) (27-30).  Several intervention studies have reported that vitamin D supplementation can reduce depression (31-33); however consistent limitations were the lack of significant depressive symptomology or depression as inclusion criteria.  One such study, a large, randomized clinical trial (RCT) trial of healthy, overweight and obese adults, found that weekly vitamin D 
supplementation (40,000 IUs) improved depressive sympt oms; suggesting its use for amelioration of these 
symptoms (23).  Vitamin D supplementation is associated with few side effects and is inexpensive (34-36). To 
our knowledge, there are no published studies on vitamin D supplementation for persons with diabetes who have depression.  
 
We recently completed a six month proof of concept study using a one group, pre-post test design to examine 
the effects of weekly vitamin D supplementation (50, 000 IUs weekly) in women (n=50) with type 2 diabetes 
who had significant depressive symptoms (a score > 16 on the Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_360124] (CES-D) (NIH 5P60DK020595, pi[INVESTIGATOR_16080]).  We found a significant decrease in depression and improvements in diabetes self-management.  We also f ound a decrease in systolic blood pressure. Depression 
is associated with hypertension and an increased risk of stroke (37-39). Evidence suggests that vitamin D supplementation may lower blood pressure (BP) by [CONTACT_360162] (40-44).  
 
We now propose a randomized trial to determine the efficacy of vitamin D 3 supplementation on depressive 
symptoms, self-management, and blood pressure in women (n =180) with type [ADDRESS_449045] significant 
depressive symptoms (CES-D > 16).  Using a stratified block randomization (strata based on depression 
2 
 symptom severity) women will be assigned to either weekly vitamin D [ADDRESS_449046] ed at baseline, three, and six months.  The following 
outcomes will be measured: depressive symptoms, diabetes self-management (self-efficacy, diabetes distress, 
diabetes self-care behaviors), and systolic blood pressure.  We will also explore a possible mechanistic effect of vitamin D
3 supplementation on depression.  Evidence indicates that in depression, pro-inflammatory 
biomarkers, notably cytokines and C-reactive protein (CRP), are elevated (45-48). Several studies (not depression studies) have reported that Vitamin D can decrease levels of inflammatory biomarkers (49-51). 
Thus we will explore whether vitamin D
3 supplementation decreases inflammatory biomarkers (CRP,   
interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor- α) providing evidence for a possible mechanism of antidepressant 
activity.  
 
Aim 1:   To determine the effect of 50,000 IUs of vitamin D 3 supplementation on depressive symptoms (primary 
outcome), self-management (secondary outcome), and systolic BP (exploratory outcome) compared to 5000 IUs.  
   
 
Hypothesis:   Women receiving 50,[ADDRESS_449047] a lower 
systolic BP compared to those taking 5000 IUs at three and six months follow-up. 
 
Aim 2:   To explore the mechanistic effect of vitamin D supplementation on inflammatory biomarkers and their 
association with depression.   Hypothesis:   Women receiving 50,[ADDRESS_449048] a decrease in inflammatory 
biomarkers which will be associated with fewer depressive symptoms compared to those taking 5000 IUs at three and six months follow-up.  
 
UPDATED AIMS  A sub-study was added to investigate family functioning in women with Diabetes and Depression titled Family Matters in Diabetes and Depression (FAMDD) . This study is also funded under LU#   208808          
This sub-study of the Sunshine 2 Study has the following specific aims and hypotheses:  
 
Aim 1: Describe the impact of family functioning on self-management, barriers to self-management, and FQOL 
in women with depression and T2DM. (qualitative)  Aim 2:   Determine the relationship of depressive symptoms, family functioning and FQOL.  
 
Hypothesis 1a: Depressive symptoms will be associated with poor family functioning.  
Hypothesis 1b: Higher depressive symptoms will be associated with poor FQOL.  
Hypothesis 3c: Depressive symptoms mediate the relationship of family functioning and FQOL.  
 
Aim 3: Determine the relationship of family functioning, self-management and FQOL.  
 Hypothesis 2a: Better family functioning will be associated with more self-management behaviors.  
Hypothesis 2b: Better family functioning will be associated with better FQOL. 
 
 
A sub-study was added to investigator the urinary microbiome and lower urinary tract symptoms in 
women with type 2 diabetes titled “The Urinary Microbiome and Vitamin D in Women with Type 2 
Diabetes” study has recently been submitted for review for potential funding to Novo Nordisk under LU# 208880.   This substudy of the Sunshine 2 Study has the following specific aims:

 Primary Objectives: (1) To determine the FUM composition in women with T2DM, using high throughput 16S 
rRNA gene sequencing & enhanced quantitative urine culture (EQUC), and determine the FUM’s association 
with LUTS in women with T2DM. (2) To determine the impact of glycemic control on LUTS and the FUM 
composition in women with T2DM.  
 Secondary Objective: To determine whether there is an association between vitamin D status (sufficient, insufficient, and deficient), the FUM and LUTS in women with T2DM.

 I. Significance.   
 
Diabetes and Depression.  Depression occurs more often in women with diabetes than men with diabetes (7, 
52) and over 25% of women with diabetes have depression (7).  For women having both depression and 
diabetes, the risk of mortality is significantly higher (RR=3.11) than for having either diabetes (RR=1.71) or 
depression (RR=1.76) (53). Of significance is that the cost of treating diabetes and co-morbid depression is almost four times higher ($247 million) than treating diabetes alone ($55 million) (54, 55).     
 
Depression Treatment and Diabetes. Drug therapy for treat ment of depression can disrupt glycemic control (18-
20) and cause weight gain (21, 22). In the Diabetes Prevention Program for persons who were at risk for 
diabetes, continuous antidepressant use was associated with an increased risk of diabetes in both the placebo 
(RR=2.60) and the intensive lifestyle (RR=3.39) study arms (56). Although cognitive behavioral therapy is an effective treatment for depression and depressive symptoms in persons with diabetes (57-59); lack of available trained personnel, poor access to mental health services for many individuals, and cost can be challenges for its greater use (60, 61).  Thus, exploration of other strategies to treat depression are needed. 
 
Vitamin D and Depression.    Evidence from observational studies suggests a relationship between low levels of 
vitamin D and depression (25-30), but no randomized clinical trials in persons with depression are available to confirm this evidence.  However, reports indicate that Vitamin D receptors in the brain may have an important role in neuroendocrine functioning (62-64).  For example, low levels of serotonin are present in depression, and vitamin D has been linked with the production of serotonin (65).  Research also indicates that lack of vitamin D negatively affects growth, cellular signaling, and neural activity in the brain (62, 66).  Thus, other 
mechanisms may be involved in the role of vitamin D and depression.     
 
There have been several studies examining the impact of vitamin D supplementation on mood.  In earlier 
studies, improvements in mood were not observed (67- 69); however, variation in the amount of vitamin D 
given, frequency of dosing (daily, weekly, monthly), duration of dose and lack of achieving therapeutic vitamin D levels could have been reasons (25).  More recent studies report improved feelings of depression and well being for persons who are not depressed (31-33). One la rge trial of healthy, overweight and obese individuals 
(n=400) randomized to vitamin D
3 supplementation (40,000 D 3 IU weekly) or placebo for a year reported that 
symptoms of depression significantly decreased (23). However, a study limitation was that significant 
depression symptoms (depression) were not criteria for enrollment. Recently, a substudy of the VITAL trial (randomized trial of vitamin D and Omega A-3 examining cardiovascular health outcomes in healthy adults aged 55+) began assessing for depressive symptoms, but the dose of vitamin D (2000 IUs daily) may be 
insufficient for obese individuals (70, 71).   
 
Vitamin D supplementation for the treatment of pers ons who have significant depressive symptoms has not 
been studied.  Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_360125] 2 diabetes who had significant depressive symptoms 
(depression), but was a one-arm study (treatment only)   Following supplementation, we found a significant 
improvement in depressive symptoms and as well as other outcomes (See pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]). We now are proposing a 
randomized trial targeting treatment of  depressive symptoms with vitamin D 3 supplementation (Figure).  
 
Depression and Self-Management.  We also observed an improvement in diabetes self-management 
(specifically, self-care behaviors and diabetes distress) in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  We believe that this effect was due to an improvement in depression. Evidence indicates that depression negatively impacts diabetes self-management (72-76), especially for women (6).  Self-managem ent includes beliefs (i.e., self-efficacy), emotional 
responses (i.e., diabetes distress), as well as the ability to  engage in self-care behaviors (diet, activity, medication 
adherence) (77). For women, depression is associated with lower self-efficacy (78, 79) and increased diabetes distress (80, 81), both of which can contribute to poor self-care behaviors (82).  Although there is significant research to indicate that depression impacts diabetes  self-management, there is limited evidence as to whether 
treatment of depression improves diabetes self-management (13-15). This study will add to that body of knowledge.  For this study, we propose that if vi tamin D supplementation reduces depression, self-management 
will improve as individuals begin to feel better and more actively participate in their care.  If depression subsides, we believe that self-efficacy, diabetes distress, and self-care behaviors will improve (Figure).   
 
Vitamin D and High Blood Pressure.  We also observed an improvement in blood pressure in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].    
Definitive mechanistic studies of vitamin D and blood pressure are currently in progress. Both in vitro and in 
[ADDRESS_449049] 
blood pressure by [CONTACT_360163]-angiotensin system through suppression of renin biosynthesis 
(40, 44).  Vitamin D may also be effective in reducing deleterious effects of glycation end products on the 
endothelium (41), thus allowing for endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation (42, 43).    The Nurses’ Health Study reported that women were twice as likely to develop hypertension if vitamin D levels were less than 15 ng/ml (83). Women have vitamin D levels as low as 15-20 ng/ml (84, 85), especially those with type 2 diabetes (86).  There have been few vitamin D trials in women to examine blood pressure effects, 
and results have been inconsistent (87-89).  The Women’s Health Initiative did not find a change in blood 
pressure with vitamin D supplementation; however, the dose (400 IU) daily may not have been sufficient (90).  Yet Pfeifer and colleagues (91) did report a 7% decrease in systolic blood pressure in vitamin D deficient women following 800 IUs of vitamin D
3 after 6 weeks.  
 
High blood pressure is a major risk factor for persons with diabetes which contributes significantly to their renal  
complications. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_360126] D are associated with a higher 
systolic blood pressure (92).  Because persons with diabetes are at high risk for hypertension, this outcome is important in assessing as an additional benefit of vi tamin D supplementation. In addition, because depression 
increases the risk for hypertension and stroke, this is another important reason for its study (37-39). Thus, we propose that vitamin D supplementation will decrease systolic blood pressure (Figure).  
 
Vitamin D and Diabetes .  Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_360127] D supplementation; although women had type 2 diabetes for an average of 8 years and were under good metabolic control (see pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299]).  Some epi[INVESTIGATOR_360128] D may prevent diabetes (93, 94), however, few RCTs are published (95, 96). The Women’s Health Initiative reported that that vitamin D did not prevent the development of type 2 diabetes (97).  Other studies have been inconclusive regarding the effects vitamin D supplementation on glycemia, with most showing no significant benefit (98, 99). 
 
Summary.  Depression is higher in women with type 2 diabetes and is costly to treat (7, 54-55).  Evidence from 
observational studies suggests a relationship between low levels of vitamin D and depression (27-30), but no randomized clinical trials in persons with depression are av ailable to confirm this evidence.  Studying vitamin D 
supplementation as a treatment option can have significant implications.  The cost for vitamin D supplementation is low (as low as cost $3 per month) and it has few side effects (34, 36).  Given that 1 in 10 
Americans now take antidepressants (100) which can have negative effects on weight and metabolic control 
(18-22), this study could provide evidence as a treatment option for depression. Since women with diabetes have low vitamin D and high levels of depression, this group is being studied as efficacy is more likely to be demonstrated.  
II. Innovation. 
 
Vitamin D for Depression. The proposed study is innovative in that a randomized trial to examine the impact of 
vitamin D supplementation for treatment of depressive symptoms has not been conducted.  To target women 
with type [ADDRESS_449050] that depression impacts self-management, there are few studies to examine whether this is actually true. Finally, to study whether vitamin D supplementation can improve systolic blood pressure is also innovative.  
 
Dosing of  Vitamin D. Although the Institute of Medicine recommends 600 IUs day for women up to age 70 
(101), information regarding doses for persons who have chronic  diseases like depression or diabetes are almost nonexistent.  It has been reported that higher doses are needed to reach sufficient levels in persons who are overweight and obese (23, 35).  Evidence recommends that in obese patients, doses of at least [ADDRESS_449051] eight weeks followed by [CONTACT_360164] 
30 ng/ml (34, 35).  A recent study reported that taking high doses (10,000 IUs daily) for almost one year did not 
have adverse effects (49, 96) . Most persons with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese.  The proposed 
study will be administering a dose of vitamin D that is adequate for replacement for overweight and obese persons (23, 35, 102) and is another novel aspect of this study.     
 
7 
 Depression and Vitamin D Mechanism of Action.  The Cytokine Theory of Depression evolved when studies 
identified that inflammation played a significant role in the pathophysiology of depression (103-105). Research 
indicates that pro-inflammatory cytokines alter the metabolic pathway of tryptophan by [CONTACT_360165] 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) (106). This cytokine-serotonin interaction also explains the neurodegeneration observed in depression (106). Several studies (not depression studies) have reported that Vitamin D can decrease levels of pro-inflammatory biomarkers (49-50). Since individuals with depression have elevated inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6, and TNF- α) (45-48), to 
explore whether vitamin D supplementation will decrease inflammation and subsequently ameliorate 
depressive symptoms is innovative and may provide information regarding a potential mechanism of action.    
 Urinary microbiome and vitamin D supplementation.  Because Vitamin D
3 supplementation has been 
associated with decreased inflammation (Burton et al., 2010; Hopkins et al., 2011; Wobke et al., 2014), it  is 
plausible that this decreased inflammatory response reduces ower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) . Indeed, two 
studies (one animal, one human) showed that Elocalcitol, a biologically active vitamin D 3 analogue given for 
treatment of overactive bladder, reduces nonvoiding ur inary contractions (Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_70040], 2013) and improved 
perceptions of bladder condition and reduced epi[INVESTIGATOR_360129] (Digesu et al., 2012). Since 
detrusor overactivity is associated with overactive bladder, vitamin D 3 supplementation may alleviate symptoms 
by [CONTACT_360166], which is  a significant problem for women with diabetes (James 
et al., 2014). 
 
Another potential mechanism for improved urinary symptoms following vitamin D [ADDRESS_449052] (Hertting et al., 
2010 ). Nseir et al. (2013) reported  an association between serum levels of vitamin D and recurrent UTIs in 
premenopausal women; women with <15 ng/ml vitamin D, as measured by [CONTACT_11084] 25 (OH) D, were 4X more 
likely to have recurrent UTIs. The data collected in this study will provide insight regarding the relationship of 
vitamin D supplementation to UTI occurrence .  
  
 
III. Conceptualization.   
 For this study, we  hypothesize that the vitamin D supplementation will reduce depressive symptoms.  Diabetes 
self-management will improve as a result of the decrease in depression.  We also hypothesize that vitamin D 
supplementation will improve blood pressure.

Contributory factors such as diabetes, obesity, and lifestyle may impact depressive symptoms and will be 
assessed and included in the data analysis.  Diabetes is associated with more depression, especially for women (7).  Most women with type 2 diabetes are obese (107).  Evidence indicates that obesity may increase the risk of depression, particularly for women (108-110).  Obesity is also associated with low vitamin D levels 
for women (111) and inflammation (94), which may contri bute to depression.  Physical activity can influence 
depression (112) and is also important to diabetes self -management. Other lifestyle factors such as dietary Depressive

functioning is defined as the attributes of a family system that characterize how they operate or behave 
(McCubbin & McCubbin, 1987). Family functioning is an important variable in the study of adaptation to chronic conditions.  Thus, these measures will also be studied.  
   
 
IV. Preliminary Studies.   
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_360130] [ADDRESS_449054] of living with diabetes, we conducted focus groups.  This study was funded by [CONTACT_360167] (Gloria Smith Health Disparities Award) and findings were published (4).  Results indicated that women with type [ADDRESS_449055] their well 
being, relationships with others, and diabetes self-management.  Based on these findings, a nurse-delivered group cognitive behavioral intervention (CBT) intervention for the education and treatment of dysphoric symptoms (SWEEP) in depressed women with type 2 diabetes was developed and tested. This was funded by 
[CONTACT_4289]-NINR (K23 009240) with presentations and publications (113, 114).  The final study results were just reported in the Annals of Behavioral Medicine, a multidisci plinary journal (Impact factor 4.3, E-Pub Head, July 
2012) (59). Findings indicated that a nurse delivered CBT intervention was more effective than usual care for 
the treatment of depressed women with type [ADDRESS_449056] depression and other health outcomes.   Our literature reviews on this topic were 
published in the Issues in Mental Health  Nursing, Circulation, and Diabetes Educator (25, 44, 94).  With funds 
from our School of Nursing and  IRB approval, we were able to assess the vitamin D levels in our SWEEP 
participants.  Findings indicated that 72% of our wo men from SWEEP had vitamin D levels less than 30 ng/ml 
(> 30 is normal), and there was a significant relationship between vitamin D deficiency and depression (CES-
D) (r=-.39, p<.05).  Relationships also existed for HBA1c (r=-.20) and fasting glucose (r=-.28), but were not statistically significant.   
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_360131].  Using this preliminary data from SWEEP, we applied and were funded for 
a “proof of concept study” to examine whether vitamin D supplementation in women with 2 diabetes  with low 
Vitamin D levels could improve depression and metabolic outcomes (NIH 5P60DK020595 pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], University of Chicago Diabetes Research and Training Center).  It was branded as the “Sunshine Study”.  A one-group pre-post test design study was used to test for feasibility, compliance, and the impact of vitamin D
2 
supplementation. Weekly ergocalciferol (D 2) of 50,000 IUs was administered for six months.  This formulation 
of vitamin D is approved for the treatment of low vitamin D, and was being used at our clinical practice site at the time of the study. Women were enrolled if they had: type 2 diabetes greater than 6 months, significant depressive symptoms (CESD > 16),  were not taking vitamin D supplements or had stopped them for at least 1 
month prior to enrollment, had a vitamin D level < 30 ng/ml, and were not hypercalcemic.   These same inclusion and exclusion criteria are being proposed in this study.  Over 300 women were phone screened for 
participation.  Fifty women were enrolled at baseline.  They were a mean age of 55 years, had diabetes an 
average of 8 years with a mean HBA1c of 6.8%, and 60% were white. At three months, 49 or 98% continued and at six months, 46 or 92% were retained.  Procedures for dispensing the vitamin D and follow-ups are the same being proposed for this study (see procedures).  Women came within 10 days following baseline screening to obtain their prescription of vitamin D, were then sent a weekly message (their preferred method as phone, text, or e-mail) to take their vitamin D, and called at 4 to 6 weeks.  This was done to determine if any 
9 
 concerns with the supplementation and to ensure that their depression did not worsen (and it did not).  Women 
were then seen at three months for follow-up measures and for prescription refill.  For all 3 time points, patients 
completed questionnaires that included: depression (CES-D) and diabetes self-management which included 
diabetes self-care inventory (SCI) and diabetes distress using the Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale (PAIDS).  For the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], labs and physical measurements were also assessed and included vitamin D, calcium, PTH, HbA1c, blood pressure, and weight.  Depression was verified at baseline using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS).  Following completion of the study, all patients were given their labs and referred to their healthcare provider for future follow-up.      
 
Repeated measures ANOVA results indicated that depressi on symptoms decreased significantly over time.  In 
addition, there was a significant improvement in self-care behaviors and less diabetes distress.  Vitamin D levels increased to a therapeutic level, and there were no significant changes in labs (calcium and parathyroid hormone).  Although there was no improvement in HBA1c, the average baseline value indicated very good control (<7%).  Other investigators have reported no change in HBA1c with vitamin D supplementation (97-98).  
A clinically and statistically significant decrease in systolic blood pressure was observed.  There was also a 
small decrease in weight.    
 
 
    
 
  Given our preliminary data, we hypothesize a significant decrease in depression symptoms, improved diabetes self-management, and a lowering of systolic blood pressure in the treatment group (vitamin D) compared to the 
control group using a RCT.  In our proposed study, we will measure weight since it can impact on both blood pressure and vitamin D levels (102).  Since vitamin D levels could be affected by [CONTACT_360168] (27, 115, 116), we measured these as well. Women reported an average of 10% body exposure to the sun (largely their head and upper forearm) with no change over time in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  Dietary intake of vitamin D was low (153 IUs/ day), but given the limited natural food sources for vitamin D, this 
finding was not surprising.  Since other research has addressed these factors, we will continue to measure 
these factors and address them in the data analysis.     
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_360132].  [CONTACT_360229], co-investigator and psychiatrist, has studied 
depression and inflammation but not vitamin D. His study of 48 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD assessed by [CONTACT_360169]) and 23 healthy controls (HC) were compared for pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-
6, TNFα ) and hs CRP using a compact biochip array system (Randox Technologies; Evidence Investigator 
TM).  Depressed patients demonstrated significantly higher levels of inflammation than healthy controls as 
reflected in plasma levels of TNF-α  (MDD 2.15+/- 0.04 pg/ml   and HC 1.59+/-1.59 pg/ml, p=0.05) as well as 
plasma IL-6 (MDD 0.810 +/- 0.012 and HC 0.665+/- 0.023 pg/ml, p=0.05).  Similarly, hs-CRP in depressed individuals was significantly higher than in healthy control subjects (MDD 3.53 +/-0.4 mg/l; HC 1.79 +/- 0.7 mg/l, p<0.05).  Given [CONTACT_360229]’ success in measuring inflammatory biomarkers in depressed patients, we 
have proposed exploration of these measures following treatment with vitamin D supplementation where we 
hypothesize women will have a significant improvement in depressive symptoms.  
 
Team Composition.  In summary, we have a strong interdisciplinary team of nursing ([CONTACT_360230]), mental 
health  (Drs. Halaris and Mumby), endocrinology (Drs. Emanuele and Camacho), nutrition (Drs. Kouba and

of the outcomes proposed for this RCT.   We also have outstanding consultants who have had success with 
vitamin D implementation in research studies ([CONTACT_9688][INVESTIGATOR_244388]) as well as clinical practice ([CONTACT_360232]).  We believe that the uniqueness and strength of this team makes this application strong for its success if awarded.  Variables  Baseline

V. Approach.   
1. Design.  This is a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of six months duration.  Women will be randomly 
assigned to either  50,000 IU of vitamin D 3 (n=75) or 5000 IUs of vitamin D 3 (n=75) (both dispensed by [CONTACT_360170]).    
 
a. Treatment Schedule and Dose.   The supplements will be administered once a week for six months. The 
dose of vitamin D 3 (50,000 IUs) is recommended for overweight and obese individuals to achieve adequate 
blood levels (34, 35, 102).  In addition, doses such as these have been safely used (23, 49, 96).   
 
The weekly dosing is being used to increase compliance to therapy (i.e., not having to remember to take it 
daily).  A once a week administration schedule has been very successful in treating women for other disorders 
(117).  To further increase compliance, women will receive a weekly reminder (preferred method of telephone, e-mail or text) to take their supplement.  This was very successful in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].     
 
Patients will be seen at baseline, 3 and 6 months with physical assessment and lab data as with our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  Published guidelines recommend monitoring calc ium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and vitamin D at 
baseline and 3 months when initiating vitamin D at this dose (50,000 IU) to assess for a therapeutic level (35, 
44).  In addition, since treatment of depression is usually a minimum of 12 weeks, we will capture the time 
when typi[INVESTIGATOR_360134] (57, 59).  Women will also be contact[CONTACT_360171] 2, 4, for assessment of depressive symptoms as well as any potential side effects of the supplement. 
 
Vitamin D 3  also known as cholecalciferol, has been selected as the treatment since it is the natural form of 
vitamin D, the more widely used supplement, and now recommended for clinical practice (34).  The Institute of Medicine recommends 600 IUs of Vitamin D per day for individuals up to age 70 (101).  Thus, the 5000 IUs dose will approximate follow that recommendation (600 IUs x 7 days= 4200 IUs) and be given once per  week as well.  The use of a dose with the minimum recommended amount for comparison is consistent with other studies examining the benefit of vitamin D supplementation on health outcomes (35, 95).  Bio Tech 
Pharmacal, Inc. will prepare the vitamin D
[ADDRESS_449057] quality standards.   
 
b. Treatment Randomization.  A stratified block randomization will be used with blocks of random size 2, 4 
and 6.  There will be two strata based upon depression symptom severity using the CES-D guidelines (118).  These strata will be (1) moderate severity for CES-D scores of 16 to 26 and (2) high severity for CES-D scores 
greater than 26. In our previous work, about half of the women were in each stratum at baseline.  With 
stratified randomization, factors associated with depression should be more evenly distributed as randomization with stratification induces more balanced groups (119). A randomization list will be developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Durazo, statistician and co-investigator. The list will be retained by [CONTACT_360172], who is independent from those involved with the conduct of the study.  The research pharmacist will use the list to 
assign subjects to the treatments..   
 
c. Blinding.  The study supplements will be administered by [CONTACT_360173] a blinded fashion during the study 
so that the patient and clinical site personnel (except for the pharmacist) will not be aware of the patient’s 
assigned treatment.  
 
d. Treatment side effects.  Published reports suggest that 50,000 IU per day of vitamin D (note that the 
proposed study dose is 50,000 IU per week) can increase vitamin D levels to more than 150 ng/dl and cause hypercalcemia (35).   The current dose for this study is one capsule of 50,000 IU per week which equates to 
about 7000 IU per day. The dose at which the Vitamin D is being administered has minimal side effects, which may include gastrointestinal symptoms of constipation, stomach upset, and loss of appetite.  Symptoms associated with vitamin D toxicity include bone pain, nausea, and vomiting (35, 120).   We will be monitoring patient labs and for these symptoms at all study visits ( baseline, 3, 6 months).  Telephone interview (months 2, 
4) will be used when patients are not seen for these assessments as with our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (see procedures).       
 
[ADDRESS_449058] has either:  (1) 
hypercalcemia or (2) vitamin D level of greater than 100 ng/ml with normal serum calcium or symptoms of 
vitamin D previously listed that may be indicative of possible toxicity (35).   Patients  will be requested to return for a serum level of vitamin D within one month (since the half life is approximately two weeks) of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_7374] (120) and then again at the end of the study.   The depression assessment will be reviewed with the psychiatrist prior to enrollment and subjects will be monitored for depression over the course of the study when they are seen (baseline, 3, 6 months) as well as when they are not seen (months 2, 4) by [CONTACT_756].  Subjects 
will be withdrawn if there is significant worsening of depression (see Human Subjects).  These protocols were 
followed for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_360135].     
 
2.   Sample.  a. Criteria for Participation.  Inclusion criteria are:   1) women aged 21 and older, 2) having significantly 
elevated depressive symptoms as measured by a score >  to 16 using the Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_360136] (CES-D) (118,121) and/or taking antidepressant medication and having a score >12 using the 
CES-D and/or CES-D score average of >16 of phone screen and face to face screen, 3) type 2 diabetes and 
under the care of a health care provider, (4) level of vitamin D also known as 25 hydroxyvitamin D, 25 (OH) D less than 32 ng/dl.  Exclusion criteria are: 1) current alcohol or substance abuse disorders, 2) a history of 
bipolar depression or any other psychotic disorder, 3) debilitating chronic illness (e.g., cancer, multiple 
sclerosis), 4)  severe complications of diabetes (e.g., blindness or amputation) since these will impact 
depression, 5)  malabsorption disorders (e.g., crohn’s disease, celiac sprue, gastric by[CONTACT_6476]) since this impacts vitamin D absorption (122), 6)  elevated serum calcium since vitamin D may increase serum calcium (123). 7) taking St. John’s Wort unless they stop for [ADDRESS_449059] mood (124).  8) use 
of vitamin D supplements (1000 IUS or greater) in past [ADDRESS_449060] 1 month prior to study  9) Pregnant or planning a pregnancy. 10) Baseline systolic blood pressure greater than 
160 mmHG or diastolic greater than 100 mmHG. Having active treatment for depression (e.g., antidepressant 
therapy) will not be exclusion criteria if the patient has been under treatment for six weeks or more. Similar criteria were used for our pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268].     
 
b. Recruitment.  We contact[CONTACT_360174] a 20 mile radius of LUMC (most are within a 5 to 10 mile 
radius) with the closest facilities.  The diabetes educators provided estimates of potential patients with type [ADDRESS_449061] been provided by [CONTACT_360175].  To facilitate recruitment, a 
meeting will be held at each site (with educators and endocrinologists) to discuss the study, review study brochure, procedures for participating, and follow-up information.  We used these sites and this recruitment strategy for our pi[INVESTIGATOR_360137]. We will also work with our marketing department for recruitment of study participants.   
 
 
 
    
 
    
 
In order to allow patients from Loyola to know about the study, we will have the endocrinologists (Camacho, Emanuele, Charnogusky, Mazhari, Michelfelder, Bading) send letters about the study to their patients.  A waiver of HIPPA authorization will be used to identify patients from these physicians who meet the study criteria using CPT codes.   We have contact[CONTACT_360176] a copy of the approved patient letter that is being used for our mailing.  However, we would also 
like to provide flyers at the Diabetes Centers and Primary Care Centers for patients to contact [CONTACT_3019].  This is the Diabetes Center Sites  # Patients/Mo  Diabetes Center Sites # Patients/Mo

3. Procedures  a. Phone Screening of Participants. We will use the protocol established in our previous studies. Interested 
participants will be given a phone interview to describe the study.  If interested, age, health information, and questions regarding diabetes and mental health will be asked to screen for potential eligibility.  The CES-D is administered on all participants. Candidates who are not eligible to participate in the trial because of enrollment 
criteria but have elevated CESD scores will be asked to speak with their primary healthcare provider about their 
symptoms.  We may also send these excluded candidates our  resource list of local mental healthcare providers 
developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Mumby.   If participants meet eligibility criteria, they will be scheduled for a baseline visit.  
 
b. Baseline Screening and Enrollment.  As with our previous work, the baseline screening will occur within a 
week to reduce the potential for change in depression over time.  Subjects will be able to come to the Loyola School of Nursing (SON) Research Room in Maywood, IL on weekday or Saturdays. Women will fast for 10 
hours prior to their appointment (they will be allowed to drink water) and to bring their supplements with them.  They will be informed that first baseline testing will last between [ADDRESS_449063] between 1 to 2 hours.  Upon arrival at the site, informed consent will be obtained and their blood will be drawn by a study nurse.  The physical measures (i.e. weight and height) will then be done.  Study subjects will then 
be provided breakfast, reminded to take their prescribed supplements, and instructed to complete the 
questionnaires.  The researcher will review the questionnaires for missing data and assess if the items were skipped or not answered due to personal choice.   
  
The diagnostic interview schedule (based on the DSM-IV) to assess current and past mental health will be administered by a trained study nurse (25 to 30 minutes).  Exclusionary criteria such as bipolar and psychotic disorders and alcohol/substance abuse will be verified.  Active suicidal ideation will also be assessed using a 
form developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Mumby (attached). If a participant has active suicidal ideation, [CONTACT_360229], psychiatrist 
and co-investigator and/or [CONTACT_360233], psychologist and co-investigator, will be contact[CONTACT_360177] (See Human Subjects).  These subjects will not be enrolled. The same procedures will be implemented at all follow-up visits .  In addition, if  the patient answers question #9 on the PhQ-9 depression 
tool with a response other than “Not at all”, the suicide assessment form will also be completed on these 
patients as well and similar procedures followed if active suicidal ideation.  
 At the baseline visit, both groups will receive a list of resources for mental health services developed by [CONTACT_360178] (as with our previous study) as they will not be prevented from getting help if needed as a safety measure.  In our previous depression study, this occurred infrequently (<3%), as [ADDRESS_449064] visit, the lab tests (vitamin D, calcium, PTH, Cardiometabolic profile as 
recommended by [CONTACT_1622]) will be reviewed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Emanuele,endocrinologist and co-investigator to ensure 
that blood enrollment criteria are met.  If so, the patient will be scheduled for a second visit within [ADDRESS_449065] a body composition scan to assess for body composition (which includes bone, lean and fat mass) which should take [ADDRESS_449066] is not pr egnant (see human subjects).  Upon completion, a small 
conference room at that site will be used for the research nurse to provide the study supplement, review the 
weekly schedule, and discuss all subsequent contacts (phone and scheduled visits).  The study nurse will also 
review potential side effects and reiterate the reproductive risks associated with the treatment at baseline visit 2  and  3 month visit when the supplement is provided. The patient will be told that an automated message (preferred as phone, e-mail or text) will remind them to take their weekly supplement.  They will be informed that at three and six months, they will return for dat a collection of physical measurements and questionnaires.  
They will be told that in the months (2, 4,) when they don’t have a scheduled visit, the study nurse will conduct 
a formal phone call follow-up where they will be asked about their compliance, side effects, and be screened 
for their depressive symptoms (CES-D).  These procedures  will be followed for all phone call visits (Appendix).   
[ADDRESS_449067] visit (three months following initiation of treatment) will occur at the SON. The protocol established at 
baseline will be followed by [CONTACT_46566] (blood will be dr awn, physical measures, questionnaires, and interview).  
Questionnaires that do not address mental health will be sent to participants prior to their visit with a reminder appointment letter.  This is to limit the time spent onsite for data collection.  It will not be mandatory that they bring them completed as they can complete them onsite if they so choose.  The nurse will also request the study 
bottle and count the remaining pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (if any).  If supplement is remaining, the nurse will record the reasons and 
the bottle will not be returned to the patient.  All study questionnaires will be reviewed.  Upon completion of these procedures, study supplement will be dispensed and the protocol for taking the supplement will be reviewed. To protect subjects, their depression level will be assessed and safety protocol implemented (if needed) using the same procedures described at baseline. The labs drawn at this time will be reviewed by [CONTACT_360179] [INVESTIGATOR_360138] t herapy (Study Design: Safety-1e).   The fourth and final 
visit (six months following initiation of treatment) will occur at the SON.  The patient will have the following 
assessed at end of study: vital signs, weight, walk test, neurosensory exam of feet, and assessment for any complaints.   Questionnaires will be administered and reviewed as delineated in the protocol as well. The participant will be informed of optional interview at the six month visit.  An optional informed consent will be 
signed at the time of the interview and participants will also complete the family questionnaires. The procedures 
previously described will be followed, although no s upplement will be dispensed and patients will be informed to 
follow-up with the primary care provider regarding future supplementation. The patient will be sent their study lab tests (performed by [CONTACT_277880]) and DEXA scan in the mail, informed that the dose of the medication will not be 
known until the end of the study, thus following up with their healthcare provider for future dosing of vitamin D is recommended.  Letter to study participant is attached.  
 
Patients will be called 3 months after completion of the Sunshine Study treatment intervention (which is 9 months from baseline) to see if they have followed up with their healthcare provider about the final test results mailed to them.  They will be asked general questions about their physical well-being and the CES-D for depression symptom assessment will be conducted. (See attached, 9 month revised phone interview).  Protocol for this 
phone screen will be congruent with procedures for baseline phone screen (see Protocol 3a)    Patients may be asked to provide clean urine sample using a clean catch midstream voided urine samples with 60 ml urine cups at study visits as well as complete several questionnaires on bladder and pelvic symptoms (see measurements). 
 
    
d. Optional Biobanking.   Participants may optionally  agree to reposit up to six tablespoons of blood (i.e., 
approximately two tablespoons) and 8 tablespoons of urine at each at Baseline, Month 3, and Month 6) into CRO-BIOREP (LU# 204853) for future research purposes.  Participants will sign a second informed consent document should they agree to reposit their blood and/or  urine.  The research team members and Biorepository 
staff will each retain a copy of the signed repository info rmed consent document.  It is important to point out that 
participants do not need to agree to reposit blood and/or urine in order to participate in the trial.    All patients who agree to reposit blood specimens into CRO-BIOREP (LU# 204853) will be assigned a unique code using our SMART-ID system. This number will be used to connect coded specimens and coded data to other studies conducted by [CONTACT_277886].  To receive this number, 
we will ask participants for sex at birth, month of birth, day of birth, year of birth, and social security number.  
This information is entered into a secure website where it is hashed into a unique ID using a java script.  The participant and research team will receive the unique ID number.  Once the number is created, the information that was entered is immediately deleted.  This means the website will not retain any of the information that is entered to create the SMART-ID.  However, should anyone  need to retrieve a SMART-ID number, you will be 
able to get it again at a later date by [CONTACT_360180] (i.e., sex, date of birth, and social security number) that was entered before.   
[ADDRESS_449068] that 
links these codes with patients’ identifying information will  be kept separate from all research specimens and 
clinical data. 
 
Information that may readily identify patients will never  be shared with anyone. 
 
 
d. Retention, Adherence, and Drop Outs.   To enhance retention, participants will be scheduled for visits on a 
day that is convenient for them (oftentimes Saturdays).  Free parking will be provided for visits.  Honorarium for 
data collection points will be given in a stepped manner ($25-baseline 1, $25 baseline 2,  $30-three months, 
$35-six months, $40 optional qualitative interview after 6 m onth visit) with a personalized thank you note.  We 
have published on these strategies (114). To enhance adherence to treatment we will have automated weekly 
reminders to take supplements (preferred method: phone, e-mail, or text). Retention in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_23366] 92% 
using these techniques.  To assess for treatment adherence, we are obtaining blood vitamin D levels and requesting that patients bring their bottle (to count for the number of unused pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], if any) at both 3 and 6 months. For persons who drop out, we will assess the reason for drop out and the extent to which they require further treatment with referral to their provider as  stated in informed consent document (Human Subjects).

a. Depression Outcomes.  The CES-D and the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) will be used.  
(1) The CES-D  (20 items) is well accepted for depression screening.  The Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_360140] 20 items and measures symptoms of depression and their severity (0=none to 3=most of 
the time).  A cutoff score of > 16 has been used to indicate depression.  The tool has excellent internal 
reliability (Cronbach alpha from .85 to .90).  It has also been reported that the CES-D and the Beck Depression Inventory performed comparably as depression screening to ols (118, 121). In our SWEEP trial, the CES-D was 
reliable (Cronbach alpha from.87 to .92) and was validated by [CONTACT_360181].  We were able to detect changes in level of depression symptoms and whether patients changed from the depressed to the non-depressed category using the CES-D guidelines (59).  The Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) is used in clinical 
practice to assess for depression and will be used to compare to CES-D and DIS (Kroenke et al., 2001).  
(2) The DIS  will be used to screen and verify mental information. It is a structured mental health interview that 
uses the criteria specified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) to generate 
diagnoses that can be used for research purposes (125, 126).  It has been reported that results of the DIS correlate significantly with clinical diagnoses (127-128). It will be used to obtain a history of mental illness, depression characteristics (e.g., suicidality, # of previous depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], age of onset, and duration of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]) and to verify the CES-D measure. (3) Suicidal Assessment form was developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Mumby [CONTACT_360182]/or positive score on the PhQ-9  with item #9.  
 
b. Self-Management Outcomes include Self-Efficacy, Diabetes Distress, and Self Care Behaviors.  (1) Diabetes Self-Efficacy Scale was developed by [CONTACT_360183]-disease self-efficacy 
scales (130).  It consists of 8 items that assess an individual’s confidence in caring for their diabetes on a likert scale from “1=not confident” to “10=totally confident”.  It has established reliability of .83 (131) and has been reported to be effective in capturing self-efficacy for persons in diabetes clinical trials (132, 133).
   
(2) Diabetes-Related Distress ( PAIDS) is a 20-item tool that measures the current burden of diabetes and its 
treatment.  A sample question includes the following: Feeling discouraged with your diabetes treatment plan? which is scored on a 5-point scale (0=not a problem to 4=serious problem).  Higher scores indicate greater 
emotional distress.  The PAIDS has high internal reliability (alpha= .95).  Predictive as well as concurrent validity have been established by [CONTACT_360184] (e.g., psychosocial factors, regimen adherence, and glycemic control) (134, 135).The responsiveness of the tool to detect changes in distress has also been established using data from seven prospective diabetes intervention studies (136).  (3) Self-Care Behaviors:  (a) Self-Care Inventory was developed to assess patient’s perceptions of the degree 
to which they adhere to treatment recommendations for diabetes self-care (1= never do it to 5= always do it).  
The tool has 16 items that addresses the areas of medication adherence, dietary regulation, exercise, and management of blood sugar (137, 138).  The Self-Care In ventory unlike measures that only assess the 
frequency of self-care behaviors doesn’t presume that a ll individuals have the same treatment prescription and 
thus is able to assess adherence to different treatment regimens (e.g., insulin or not taking insulin).  Studies have used the tool which has demonstrated psychometrics of reliability (Cronbach alpha .87) and validity 
(correlations with diabetes distress, depression, and HBA1c ) (137-139).  (b) Summary of Diabetes Self-Care 
16 
 Activities has 11 questions about self-care activities  and 14 questions about recommended activities (Toobert 
et al. 2000) (c) Appraisal of Diabetes Scale (ADS) which is items to assess patient perceptions of diabetes 
(Carey et al., 1991).  c. Blood Pressure Outcome.  Blood pressure will be measured in a standardized fashion 
using calibrated equipment in accordance with JNC guidelines (140).  The protocol and training developed for 
the ongoing international studies assessing blood pressure by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Durazo, co-investigator will be used.  Blood pressure will be measured using the Omron Automa tic Digital Blood Pressure Monitor (model HEM-7471c, 
Omron Healthcare, Bannockburn, IL, [LOCATION_003]). After at least [ADDRESS_449069] 2 used for 
analysis (141).   
 
d. Inflammatory and Vascular Biomarkers.   (1) C-Reactive Protein  (high sensitivity) will be measured by 
[CONTACT_40420]. Halaris team or Quest Lab depending upon price agreement.    (2) Cytokines (e.g., TNF- α, IL-6 IL-1)  
will be measured by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Halaris and his team in their lab (see Resources) using the  radioimmunoassay or 
with the technique of Randox Technologies, “Evidence InvestigatorTM”. This compact Biochip array system is 
comprised of a super-cooled Charge Coupled Device (CCD) camera and unique image processing software. 
We have already validated this Biochip technology for blood samples in preliminary studies. The results of the Biochips are comparable to results obtained by [CONTACT_360185].  Several cytokines, chemokines and growth factors can be analyzed simultaneously. (3) Vascular Factors (e.g., VEG-F) will be measured by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Halaris using similar methodologies described above.  
 
e. Treatment (1) Labs: Serum vitamin D, calcium and PTH will be measured for each time by  [CONTACT_360186] (CAP) and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) and has performed these assays for our pi[INVESTIGATOR_360141].  Quest will send the results either electronically or by [CONTACT_360187], initials, and date of birth. There will be no other identifiers on the labs.  Serum vitamin D will be measured by [CONTACT_60628]/tandem 
mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) which is the standard for the measurement of vitamin D and its components.  
This method provides a total 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25 OH- D) which includes 25 (OH) D
2 and the 25 (OH) D 3.  
Thus, we will be able to determine the effectiveness of vitamin D [ADDRESS_449070] includes the assessment of:  Albumin, Albumin/Globulin 
Ratio (calculated), Alkaline Phosphatase, ALT, AST, BUN/Creatinine Ratio (calculated), Calcium, Carbon Dioxide, Chloride, Creatinine with GFR Estimated, Gl obulin (calculated), Glucose, Potassium, Sodium, Total 
Bilirubin, Total Protein, Urea Nitrogen.  (2) Vitamin D Pi[INVESTIGATOR_10685] :  At 3 and 6 month visits, supplement bottle 
will be checked for number of unused pi[INVESTIGATOR_360142].  
 
f. Contributory Factors include obesity, diabetes, and lifestyle factors.    
(1) Obesity (a) Body composition  (which includes bone, lean and fat mass) will be measured using dual-
emission x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) with a whole body scanner (Discovery W by [CONTACT_38481]) provided by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Durazo (co-investigator) who has an international study on vitamin D.  The protocol for that study will be used: (a) an intrinsic CV will be determined by [CONTACT_360188] a phantom and (b) all DXA 
operators will be required to complete an intra-observer CV.  The method for assessing body composition 
using DXA has been reported to be precise, accessible, and requires short scanning (142-144).  The percent body fat measured by [CONTACT_360189] D and its relationship to weight in postmenopausal women (145-146).  (b) Body Mass Index will be calculated from weight using an electronic 
calibrated scale and height using a stadiometer.  
(2) Diabetes:  (a) Glycemic Control  will be measured by [CONTACT_33308] A1C using the DCA 2000 (Miles 
Diagnostic Division). The within CV is 2.1 to 4.5% and the between CV is 0.8 to 4.4%.  Fasting blood sugar will 
also be measured by [CONTACT_360190]. (b) Diabetes 
History and Care will be measured using the Diabetes Care Profile from the Michigan Diabetes Research and 
Training Center. This has information on demographics and medical information such as current treatment, 
comorbidities, all medications (e.g., diabetes, depression), and previous diabetes education. Development, 
validity, and reliability of the Diabetes Care Profile have been reported (147). Demographics related to family 
composition (e.g., children) will be measured as well.  
17 
  
(3) Lifestyle: (a) Physical Activity:  Short physical activity scale call ed the Godin Leisure-Time exercise 
Questionnaire which is 2 questions and assesses level of activity and if it is regular enough to work up a sweat 
(http://www.godin.fsi.ulaval.ca/Fichiers/Quest/Godin%20leisure-time.pdf ).  In addition, 4 items from the Nurses 
Health Study that asks the number of minutes per week  for recreational outdoor activities, indoor activities 
(e.g., standing, sitting), usual walking pace, and number of flights of stairs per day.   (b) Food Dietary Intake (which includes vitamin D and calcium will be assessed by [CONTACT_360191](s).  These have been developed using a data-based approach from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N-HANES) to create the selection of the foods, appropriate portion sizes and nutrient composition selected. The questionnaire for this study has about [ADDRESS_449071] was developed 
from (NHANES) 1998 to 2002 dietary recall data and the nutrient database was developed from the USDA 
Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies. Food is quantified in terms of portion size and pi[INVESTIGATOR_360143] (151, 152). The 110 item will be administered at second baseline visit and 6 months and the shorter version which assesses vitamin D and calcium only will be measured at baseline to capture this information for all enrolled subjects.   
 
 (c) Sun Exposure: Participants will be enrolled in the fall or early spring as these are the times that we have 
identified depresses subjects in our previous studies. To assess for sun exposure two methods will be used: amount of sun exposure and seasonality.   (1)  Amount of sun exposure has been developed using a method develop by [CONTACT_360192]-Lux and Heaney  (153) where sun exposure is assessed by [CONTACT_360193].  A quantifiable sun exposure is generated. (2) Season of study enrollment will also be 
recorded as a measure of sun exposure as done by [CONTACT_360194] (116).  (3) Cancer Sun Exposure Tool which 
is 14 items to screen for sun exposure (Glanz et al., 2008). 
 (d) Other Factors:   Factors that contribute to the overall health of persons with diabetes will also be assessed 
and include sleep using the validated Pi[INVESTIGATOR_360144] (Buyssee et al., 1998), perceived quality of life 
using Ferrans Quality of Life Index (Ferrans, 2013), and diabetes symptoms developed by [CONTACT_360195] (1994), 
and state-trait anxiety developed by [CONTACT_360196] (1983), the Perceived Stressor Scale developed by [CONTACT_30822]  (1983) and the MOS Social Support tool developed by [CONTACT_360197] (1991).  Addition of assessment for sarcopenia, muscle function, and falls has been added as Appendix 2 with scientific justification.    
(e). Family Quality of Life Outcomes : (1) Family Inventory of Resources for Management (FIRM). Used to 
assess internal family and social support services.  Reliability ( α= 0.87-0.92) has been strong in families with 
chronic illness (Ridosh, Sawin & Brei, 2013; Sawin, Brei, Buran, & Fastenau 2003). (2) FQOL is the “overall 
appraisal of the domains of life important to the family” measured with a 3-item scale, The G-FQOL Scale 
(parent perception of their off-spring QOL, their own QOL and their FQOL) reported on a scale from 0 (poor) to 
100 (excellent). The G-FQOL Scale has strong preliminary reliability ( α = 0.86 – 0.90) in a study of women of 
children with chronic condition (Ridosh, Sawin, Brei & Schiffman, 2015). (3) Qualitative Interview Questions developed by [CONTACT_360198] (i.e., diabetes and/or mood) will be conducted after the [ADDRESS_449072] into a written document (transcript). The audiotape and transcription will be 
destroyed when the study is complete.  
   (f) Urinary Microbiome and Self-Report Measures . (1) Assessment of the urinary microbiome will occur in 
the laboratory of [CONTACT_360234] at LUMC.  Three tests will be conducted on the urine: the (i) general screen of 
bacteria, (ii) 16S rDNA sequencing, and (iii) both EQUC and standard urine cultures. Each sample will be 
labeled with the participant’s identification number from the parent grant and refrigerated. Samples not used will be biobanked  (repository consent approved).  (2) Asse ssment of urinary symptoms will include the use of 
the use of the (a) Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (QAB-q)  which has been used in women with diabetes 
18 
 (Palleschi et al., 2014) and .(b) Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (Barber et al., 2001; 2011) which asks about 
urinary symptoms and is able to classify individuals  into categories of urinary continence. (c) Urinary 
Incontinence Questionaire to determine impact of this variable on health and quality of life (International 
Consultation on Incontinence Modular  Questionnaire; ICIQ-  http://www.iciq.net/structure.html ) . (d) Urinary 
tract history completed by [CONTACT_360199].  (2) Assessment 
of the urine for inflammatory markers in the laboratory of [CONTACT_360235] at LUMC. This will be done by 
[CONTACT_360200].  Putonti Lab protocol (e-mail 4-12-19_Specimens transported using FEDEx through Wolfe Lab protocal.  Urines stored -80.C and padlocked.  Working protocal to isoloate and congreate phages from urines in Appendix 2 of 
protocol. 
 
5. Data Management and Analysis 
a. Data Management:  The goals of data management are to: (a) ensure that data collected during the study 
are properly and accurately entered and documented; (b) ensure that data will be stored in an electronic format 
that will allow the primary investigators of the project to retrieve data easily and to export data to statistical packages; and (c) ensure the confidentiality of subjects. After the data are entered and checked, several data 
quality checks will also be conducted, including descriptive statistics and graphic plots to detect outliers and 
influential observations. All computer data will be stored in a password-protected network server with back-up. The original raw data will be stored in a locked cabinet accessed only by [CONTACT_360201]. We will run 
univariate and bivariate analyses for all variables prior to our main analyses. We will evaluate continuous 
variables using t-tests or F-tests and categorical variables using 
2. We will examine data distributions and test 
all variables for linear relationships or non-linear relationships. Descriptive statistics (means, standard 
deviation, frequency) and correlations (both Pearson and Spearman) between variables will be conducted to 
preliminarily assess the data. Necessary transformat ions and imputations will be conducted on based the raw 
data.   
 
b. Data Analysis:  The conceptual relations in the model for the study (Figure) are being used to guide the 
testing of the primary, secondary, and exploratory outcomes.   SUNSHINE PRIMARY STUDY: 
Hypothesis 1: Women receiving 50,000 IUs vitamin D supplementation will report fewer depressive symptoms 
(primary outcome), increased diabetes self-management mediated by [CONTACT_360202] (secondary outcome), and have a lower systolic BP (exploratory) compared to those 5000 IUs at three and six months follow-up.   
 
For analysis of the primary outcome (depressive sym ptoms) generalized, linear, mixed models (GLMM) for 
repeated measures will be used (154).  The proposed model will have one between-subjects variable GROUP 
(vitamin D supplementation; control) with two levels and one within-subjects variable TIME with three levels 
(baseline, 3 and 6 months ). The test of the hypotheses will hinge on the GROUP by [CONTACT_360203]. A given hypothesis will be supported with the finding of a statistically significant GROUP by [CONTACT_360204], and the finding that the means are in the 
hypothesized direction. GLMM will be implemented usi ng SPSS which will provide estimates of the means for 
each outcome variable by [CONTACT_360205].  The results will be summarized with adjusted means 
and 95% confidence intervals. A compound symmetric covariance structure will be assumed. If necessary, other covariance structures, such as Huynh-Feldt, will be investigated. An intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) 
which includes an analysis of completers and noncompleters will also be done using GLMM.  Stratification by 
[CONTACT_360206]; however, differences will be assessed.   All analyses will control for baseline values of body composit ion (body fat), race (white compared with nonwhite), 
and time at entry into the study (as season of the year, winter, summer, spring, fall) as previously done by [CONTACT_21123], [CONTACT_9688][INVESTIGATOR_244388], in his vitamin D trials.  Other covariates, related to diabetes (length of time with diabetes, HBA1c), lifestyle factors, (physical activity, diet), and previous depression will be added to generate a multivariate model which is parsimonious and based on the clinical relevance and statistical significance of 
these factors.   
 
For analysis of the secondary outcome (self-management), regression analysis will be used to test whether an 
improvement in self-management is mediated by [CONTACT_360207] (Figure). The 
Preacher and Hayes macro add-on for SPSS will be used. This technique estimates the path coefficients and 
[ADDRESS_449073] effects of the independent variable 
(vitamin D supplementation) on the dependent variable (diabetes self-management) through one or more 
mediator variables (depressive symptoms). This method allows for testing indirect effects through a mediating 
variable without the estimation of a direct link between and independent variable on an outcome, and also adjusts for the potential influence of covariates (155, 156).    
 
For the exploratory outcome (blood pressure), GLMM will be used to examine for the direct effect of vitamin D on blood pressure since there is physiologic evidence to support this. The GLMM statistical procedures described above will be used.  
 
 
Hypothesis 2:  Women receiving 50,[ADDRESS_449074] a decrease in inflammatory 
biomarkers which will be associated with fewer depressive symptoms compared to 5000 IUs  at three and six 
months follow-up.  
 
For this exploratory hypothesis, to determine if there is a decrease in the inflammatory markers, the same procedures (GLLM) will be used. If significant, then correlational methods (parametric and non-parametric) will be used to explore the association between vitamin D supplementation, depression, and the inflammatory bio 
markers.  
 1.For the sub-study FAMDD , the qualitative component (Aim 1)  interview data is being transcribed.  
Following transcription, there will be verification of the transcription by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ridosh.  Once these data have been verified, a narrative analysis will be conducted. Narrative inquiry was chosen to focus on the relationship between individuals’ life stories and it guides synthesis of data to represent the participants’ stories as a whole. 
Particular modifiable factors that mitigate health risks for family members and factors that facilitate self-management will be identified. Study team involved in this component of qualitative analysis includes [CONTACT_360236], [CONTACT_360237], [CONTACT_360238] and [CONTACT_360239]. For the analysis of the quantitative measures, descriptive statistics will be used to generate information that will allow for exploring the relationship of these measures to the other study variables being collected (e.g., 
severity of depression and diabetes) (Aim 2) .  The descriptive data will also allow comparison of these data to 
other studies that have used these tools. Reliability will be established for each tool at each time point using 
Cronbach alpha. The current analysis will test The Global Family Quality of Life Scale-Adult Women Version  
and detail its psychometric properties, specifically construct validity and reliability. Descriptive statistics will include mean age, gender, level of education, race and ethnicity. Data from total sample will be analyzed. 
Regression analysis will be used to address  Aims 2 and 3 . Mediational analyses will be used as appropriate 
 
2. For the sub-study on the Urinary Microbiome , the following analysis was proposed. 
  Primary Objectives  
(1) To determine the FUM composition in women with T2DM using high throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing 
& enhanced quantitative urine culture (EQUC), and to determine the FUM’s association with LUTS in women with T2DM.    Hypothesis:  Among women with T2DM, their FUM composition is a salient predictor of LUTS. 
Planned Analyses:  To test this hypothesis, LUTS is the response variable and FUM is the primary explanatory 
variable.  FUM will be measured in at least two ways:  First as a microbial diversity index (e.g., Shannon, Chao 1) and as an individual microbial taxa count.  When diversity indices are used, a log transformation may be applied to adjust for heterogeneity or lack of linearity.  
In this repeated measures study (baseline, 3, and 6 months ), a linear mixed effects model will be used to estimate 
the effect of FUM on patients’ LUTS severity score while allowing random intercepts for each participant to 
account for the within subject correlation engendered by [CONTACT_360208]. Since we are documenting UTIs over the trial, we will also explore the odds of experiencing at least one UTI, to be estimated as a function of the FUM using a generalized linear mixed effects model that also allows random intercepts for each participant; a binomial distribution with logit link will be specified to determine the odds ratio for the FUM diversity index and 
microbial taxa count. In these models, extreme error variances will be monitored using the ratio of the Pearson 
chi-square fit statistic over its degrees of freedom. When necessary, UTI may be treated as a count variable 
20 
 (particularly if there are enough participants experiencing multiple UTI events) and a Poisson distribution with 
negative binomial link may be used to adjust for observed overdispersion. 
 
 (2) To determine the impact of glycemic control on the LUTS and FUM composition in women with T2DM.  
  
Hypothesis:  In women with T2DM, the effect of FUM on LUTS depends on glycemic control (HBA1C), which 
may be measured as a continuous or binary (i.e., >7% versus <= 7%) variable.  
Planned Analyses: Testing this hypothesis is  largely a continuation of the investigation specified in prior 
objective, except that each model will evaluate if any effect of the FUM on LUTS severity depends on women’s 
level of glycemic control. Consequently, for this aim,  an interaction term between FUM and glycemic control will 
be estimated for each model specified above. If the interaction is not significant, adjusted estimates will be 
provided for the effect of FUM on LUTS after controlling for the effect of glycemic control, as well as other salient covariates (e.g., race, age, depression level, body mass index, and concomitant medications). 
For both hypotheses, all comparisons, including all possible pairwise interaction terms, will be evaluated using 
an alpha level of 0.[ADDRESS_449075] in either direction will be interpreted. 
 
Secondary Objective:  
To determine whether there is an association between vitamin D status (sufficient, insufficient, and deficient), 
LUTS, and the FUM.   
Hypothesis (a): Women with T2DM who have less vitamin D will have will have a different FUM composition 
than those with sufficient vitamin D. 
Hypothesis (b): Women with T2DM who have less vitamin D will have will have more LUTS than those with 
sufficient vitamin D. 
Planned Analyses: For this secondary objective, a generalized linear mixed effects model will be used to 
determine the odds of at least one UTI as a function of ordinal vitamin D status (deficient, insufficient, and 
sufficient), again allowing random intercepts for each participant to account for within subject correlation due to repeated measurements; these models will specify a binomial distribution with logit link to determine the odds ratio for each pairwise comparison of vitamin D status. As before, extreme error variances will be monitored 
using the ratio of each model’s Pearson chi-square fit statistic over its degrees of freedom. When necessary, a negative binomial link may be used to account for observed over-dispersion. Finally, a linear mixed effects model 
will be used to estimate the effect of ordinal vitamin D status on patients’ FUM indices and microbial taxa count 
as well as their LUTS symptom severity score, again allowing random intercepts for each participant. For this objective, all model terms will be evaluated using an alpha le vel of 0.[ADDRESS_449076] of treatment dose at 6 months (endpoint of trial). We will model the outcome using a GLMM, which takes into account the correlation between 2 observations on the same woman. We will determine if there is a change in a women’s FUM baseline to end of study by [CONTACT_3148]. We will use similar procedures to determine treatment group differences. Similar data 
analyses will be conducted on the urinary symptoms report ed by [CONTACT_360209].      
Exploratory Aim: To examine the relationship of the phage activity with glycemic control, other labs including  
Urine PH in biobanked urine samples in the laboratory of Catherine Putonti.  
Other Exploratory Analysis:  We will be able to make comparisons of  the FUM with persons who do not have 
diabetes. Drs. Wolfe and Brubaker have sequence and culture data from healthy and incontinent (UUI) women from their prior cohort studies (see Fig. 2) (Hilt et al., 2014; Pearce et al., 2014). In addition, 180 well-
characterized UITN subjects are adult women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) that have had clean catch midstream voided urine sequenced (see Fig. 1 ) (Thomas-White et al., 2016b). Thus, comparisons with these 
[ADDRESS_449077] diabetes.   
 
c. Missing Data. Item missing data (e.g., a subject fails to answer a particular questionnaire item), will be 
imputed using procedures such as EM algorithm. For unit missing data (where a subject is missing at a data 
collection time point), we will determine whether missing data are MCAR (data are missing completely at 
random), MAR (data are missing at random), or NMAR (not missing at random). If missing data are MCAR or 
MAR, it is likely that the standard multivariate computations will not result in biased standard error estimates.  
However, if missing data are NMAR, we will use the "pattern mixture" approach to compute a "weighted 
average" of the parameters that are associated with the missing data to estimate what the data would have 
been (157).   
 
d. Sample Size Estimation.   Based on our power estimates, a sample of [ADDRESS_449078] planned for a conservative attrition (15%) which is higher than our Sunshine pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (8%) but consistent with our SWEEP trial (59).  Therefore, 180 (90 per group) will be enrolled into the treatment arms.  Thus far, out of 169 patients enrolled, only 83 (49%) have been randomized to 
treatment arms.  Thus, we will enroll [ADDRESS_449079] 50% to allow for a 
sufficient number of persons to be randomized.  For the power analysis, we used a repeated measures 
approach formulae developed by [CONTACT_208975]. (158) which allows comparisons of the group means across 
time while adjusting for baseline values and accounting for the correlation between baseline and follow-up 
observations.  We have assumed a [ADDRESS_449080] with a type I error rate of 0.05 for each outcome.  Depression:  
There was a 14 point decrease in depression from baseline to 6 months following vitamin D supplementation 
using the CES-D (see pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299]).  Using the control group in the SWEEP study (which had the same enrollment criteria for depression and did not receive treatment), there was a 7 point decrease in depression 
(28.8 to 21.4) as depression symptoms can improve without treatment.  Given these group difference, the 
effect size is .46. A sample size of 30 per group would provide 95% power . We also powered for depression 
remission (CED-D < 16) as other depression trials (159). In our vitamin D study, 55% of women had remission of their depression at 3 months and 63% at 6 months . Using the control group data from the SWEEP study, 
30% had remission of depression at 3 months and 20% at 6 months.  Having this information, a sample size of 75 per group (n=150) would be needed to detect differences in depression remission at 3 months and a sample of 25 per group (n=50) to see the difference at 6 months. Diabetes Self-Management:   There were 
significant differences from baseline to six months (see pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299]) to calculate the effect sizes. We calculated an effect size of .[ADDRESS_449081] size of .30 based on our previous research (SWEEP) will be used.  A sample of 75 per group (n=150) will achieve 85% power on these study outcomes. Blood Pressure:  We observed a decrease of 8 mmHg in the vitamin D study 
but no change in a control group from the SWEEP study (136.2 mmHg to 135.9 mmHg).  Pfeifer et al. (96) reported a 7% decrease in blood pressure in women after [ADDRESS_449082] size of about 0.3. A final 
sample of 150 (75 per group) would provide 80% power to assess this outcome.  Inflammation (Exploratory):  
Using pi[INVESTIGATOR_360145]. Halaris (see pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299]) a sample size of 75 per group provides 85% power to detect differences between groups on depression and inflammation. For the meditational analyses , power was 
estimated using effect sizes from our previous research and current pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Although the depression effect sizes discussed above are large (160), a more conservative approach anticipating medium effect sizes was employed for the mediation analysis.  With medium effects for self-care outcomes, a total sample of 135 would achieve 95% power. 
 Sample size estimation: 
For the sub-study (FAMDD), the qualitative component of the study, the sample size proposed was [ADDRESS_449083] size, p = .05, power of .[ADDRESS_449084] established relationships with key clinical sites (see 
diabetes educators, physicians support letters) which have reported a high volume of accessible patients (see 
22 
 2b, recruitment table). Although attrition is another potential issue, it has been low in our previous studies (6% 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_360146] D, 15% SWEEP).  And, we have provided steps for addressing adherence, retention, and drop-
outs (see 3d).  To prevent measurement issues, protocols for training of staff to ensure consistency with the 
collection of data have been established in our prior work.  It is possible that factors like diet and sunshine may 
impact on vitamin D levels.  Although the impact of these variables in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_360147], they will be measured. Because body fat may affect vitamin D levels, body composition has been added as measurement.  Treatments will be assessed at all time points and evaluated for their contribution to the study outcomes.  In our prior work, we did not seen significant changes in medications as women were on 
established medications prior to enrollment.  The placebo effect may have been a factor for the positive 
findings in our one-arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]; hence a randomized trial is the next logical step.  Study staff will be blinded to the treatment and we have protocols if the blind needs to be broken (see 1c-e).  Staff will not provide additional support to the patient for treatment; however, protocols for increased depression have been delineated (3b).   Finally, it is possible that if depression improves, self-management may not.  Therefore, the 
next planned study would be a randomized trial to see if treating depression with vitamin D prior to diabetes 
self-management education could enhance learning and self-management outcomes.        
 
7. Timeline.  We have proposed a timeline of four years with the enrollment of [ADDRESS_449085] month of year 4 
with follow-ups complete by [CONTACT_360210]. Final data analysis and reports will be completed by [CONTACT_14859] 4.   
 
VI.  PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS.  
 A.  Risks to the Subjects   
(1) Human Subjects Involvement and Characteristics.   We will enroll a total of 360women to allow for 
attrition and screen failure over the course of the study (our pi[INVESTIGATOR_360148] 8%).  Women 21 and 
older with a depression score of  CES-D > 16 and/or taking antidepressant medication with a CES-D 
depression score of >12 and/or CES-D score average of >[ADDRESS_449086] a 
vitamin D level of less than 32 ng/ml verified by [CONTACT_225687].    
 
Participants will be excluded  if they have: 1) current alcohol or substance abuse disorders, 2) a history of bipolar depression or any other psychotic disorder, 3) debilitating chronic illness (e.g., cancer, multiple sclerosis), 4)  severe complications of diabetes (e.g., blindness or amputation) since these will impact depression, 5)  malabsorption disorders (e.g., crohn’s disease, celiac sprue, gastric by[CONTACT_6476]) since this impacts 
vitamin D absorption (122),  6)  Elevated serum calcium since vitamin D may increase serum calcium (123). 7) 
Taking St. John’s Wort and not willing to stop for 3 weeks prior to enrollment) (124),  8) Use of vitamin D supplements in past 2 months and unwillingness to discontinue for 1 month prior to study 9) Pregnant or planning a pregnancy. 10) Baseline systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mmHG or diastolic greater than 100 mmHG. Having active treatment for depression (e.g., antidepressant therapy) will not be exclusion criteria if the patient has been under treatment for six weeks or more.  Similar criteria were used for our pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268].    
 
These exclusion criteria will be assessed over the phone verified at the baseline enrollment visit.  In addition at baseline enrollment, the participant’s depression will be verified using the diagnostic interview schedule.  If during that interview the patient screens positive for self-harm, they will be excluded from participation (see Protection Against Risks, B2).   
 
All eligible subjects will be randomized into either the treatment group (vitamin D 50,000 IUs) or the comparison group (5000 IUs).  They will be requested to make 4 study visits for data collection over a period of 6 months (baseline data, prescription pi[INVESTIGATOR_7049] 10 days later, 3 month data collection and 6 month data collection). Women will also be called at months 2, 4  and 9 months (as noted under 3.c) to assess for any issues related to the study supplement as well as to assess for depressive symptoms.  
 
23 
 (2) Sources of Data.   We will obtain questionnaire and interview data from all study subjects at baseline, 2, [ADDRESS_449087] of the following: a) a phlebotomy draw for blood specimens 
(one tube of [ADDRESS_449088] labs and one tube of 5 ml for immune markers) will be drawn from the participant at 
baseline, 3 and 6 months; and b) body measurements from the participant's physical exam (BP, height, weight) at baseline, 3 and 6 months; c) Body composition scan using dual-x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans at 
baseline, d) Urinary specimens (8 tablespoons) at study visits.  All medical data will be obtained from the subject.  Access to medical records is not being requested.    
(3) Potential Risks.  The potential risk to the research participant s includes hemotoma at the site of the 
venipuncture when the blood is drawn at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Blood will be drawn by [CONTACT_360211], so risk of bleeding and hematoma will be minimized.    DXA will be used to measure body composition (which includes bone, lean, and fat mass). Prior to DXA, 
female participants will undergo a pregnancy test.  Pregnant women will be excluded from the study due to the 
radiation. The radiation exposure with a DXA scan is about 12microSieverts, which is significantly less than the radiation absorbed by a passenger on a roundtrip transcontinental flight (about 60 microSieverts).  The scan will take approximately 10 minutes to perform.   
There is the potential that patients may become depressed over the course of the study.  If patients 
demonstrate significant increases in the depression scores (i.e., an increase of 30% or more), either Drs. 
Halaris or Mumby [CONTACT_360212], and a determination will be made regarding contact [CONTACT_360213] a referral to a mental health care provider (HIPPA signed, see protecti on again risks).  This will be 
done for those in treatment and control group at all points of contact (phone or face to face).  If during the course of the study patients begin any medication for mood (e.g., depression or anxiety), this information will 
be recorded.  If the patient begins therapy during the course of the study, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_360149]’s current treatment protocol.  Hypercalcemia is a potential side effect of persons taking higher doses of vitamin D and this lab will be monitored to ensure that it is not present at time of enrollment and does not increase over the course of the 
study by [CONTACT_360214]. Most recent evidence demons trates that hypercalcemia may not be a significant 
side effect associated with vitamin D (49).   Vitamin D levels will be measured at baseline to ensure that the 
level is less than 32 ng/ml.  It will also be monitored over the course of the study to ensure that the levels do not increase or that there are symptoms of toxicity.  Safety procedures are listed (see protection against risks).   To decrease the possibility of hypoglycemia from fasting, patients will be asked to make sure that they eat a 
protein before bedtime and bring their morning diabetes medications to take with the breakfast that is provided.  
For persons taking insulin, they will be informed that if they take insulin in the evening, to contact [CONTACT_360215].  They will also be informed to bring their morning medications to their data collection visits to take with their breakfast.       
B. Adequacy of Protection Against Risks.  
 (1) Recruitment.  We will actively recruit women from the LUMC endocrinology and general medicine clinics as well as diabetes centers in the surrounding communities as delineated in the recruitment section of the grant.  We have received support letters for access to these sites (see letters of support). We have been very successful in our previous work.  Institutional Review Board approved flyers will be available at these sites so that nurses 
may distribute the information to prospective study participants.  Local newspapers to inform prospective 
participants about the research study will also be utilized.  We will recruit racial/ethnic groups consistent with 
previous work and participating institutions (white-60%, nonwhite-40%).     (2) Protection Against Risks.    
As state previously, for protection against the risk of bleeding and hemotoma, all phlebotomy staff will have been trained.  For the DXA scan, the personnel will have been trained (per the NIH study of [CONTACT_360231], co-investigator) on the use of the machine and procedures regarding radiation. The consent states that in the event that the 
[ADDRESS_449089] the health care provider (HIPPA 
form) will be obtained at time of enrollment.   
 At baseline enrollment, the computerized diagnostic interview schedule will be administered to verify depression.  During that interview, the patient is asked about self-harm.  If active suicidal ideation is reported, the suicidal assessment form is completed.  In addition,  if  the patient answers question #9 on the PhQ-9 
depression tool with a response other than “Not at all”, the suicidal assessment form will also be completed 
and similar procedures followed if active suicidal ideation.  
 
 If during this time the nurse identifies any patient as ha ving suicidal ideation and being at moderate to high risk 
for self-harm that requires urgent evaluation and intervention, s/he will page Drs. Halaris or Mumby.  The women 
will be evaluated by [CONTACT_101486]. Halaris, Mumby [CONTACT_360216], who will confirm the treatment plan with 
the psychiatry attending on service that day.  If the pati ent has active suicidal ideation and is deemed to be in 
need of immediate psychiatric care, a member of the res earch team will escort the patient to the emergency 
room.  She will be seen by [CONTACT_360217] a treatment plan.  Drs. Halaris or Mumby [INVESTIGATOR_48105]-up with the delineated treatment plan as this will be important 
for communication with the patient’s health care provider as well as for the integrity of the study.  These 
individuals will not be eligible for participation.   At baseline enrollment, both the treatment and control will receive a list of resources for mental health services developed by [CONTACT_360218] (as with our previous study), and will not be prevented from getting help if needed.  In our previous depression study this occurred infrequently (<3%) over the duration of the study (i.e., [ADDRESS_449090]).  
 
During the course of the study, [CONTACT_360229], psychiatrist and co-investigator or [CONTACT_360240], psychologist and co-investigator, will work with the research staff and consult as necessary.  During any time where the nurse identifies any patient as being at moderate to high risk for self harm or with significant worsening of depression (a 30% increase in the CES-D ), Drs. Halaris or Mumby [CONTACT_360219]. Subjects will be withdrawn if there is significant worsening of depression per Drs. Halaris or Mumby [CONTACT_360220].  Similarly, for persons who drop out, we will assess the reason for drop out and the extent to which they require further treatment in consultation with [CONTACT_360229] or Mumby [CONTACT_360221].  These protocols were followed for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_360150].       
In terms of the treatment intervention, those as signed the comparison group of [ADDRESS_449091] that 50,000 IU per day of vitamin D (note that the proposed study dose is 50,000 IU per week) can increase vitamin D levels to more than 150 ng/dl and cause hypercalcemia (35).   The current dose for this study is one 
capsule of 50,000 IU per week which equates to about 7000 IU per day.  The dose at which the Vitamin D is being administered has minimal side effects, which may include gastrointestinal symptoms of constipation, stomach upse t, and loss of appetite.  Symptoms associated with 
vitamin D toxicity include bone pain, nausea, and vomiting (35, 120).   We will be monitoring patient labs and for these symptoms at all study visits (baseline, 3, 6 months).  Telephone interview (months 2, 4) will be used 
when patients are not seen for these assessments as with our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (see procedures).      
 The vitamin D levels will be sent to the endocrinologist who will monitor the labs for the study, and inform the PI [INVESTIGATOR_360151].   This will be done when a study subject has either:  (1) hypercalcemia or (2) vitamin D level of greater than 100 ng/ml with normal serum calcium or symptoms of 
vitamin D previously listed that may be indicative of possible toxicity (35).   Patients  will be requested to return 
for a serum level of vitamin D within one month (since the half life is approximately two weeks) of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_7374] (120) and then again at the end of the study.  
25 
  
Patients will be allowed to continue their preferred calcium intake but will be discouraged from taking more 
than 1200 mg total per day (to be consistent with the IOM guidelines, 97) as per the recommendation of our 
consultant, [CONTACT_9688][INVESTIGATOR_244388] (see biosketch) who is an expert in vitamin D and calcium intake   This is consistent with our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  Protection against potential for hypoglycemia at data collection will be taken as previously described.  It is also possible that as women become less depressed, they may engage in better self-care behaviors and improve 
their glycemic control, with potential for hypoglycemia.   
 Because the urine is being examined for bacteria in a research laboratory, we will not be able to provide the test results to the patient.  However, if they have symptoms of urinary tract infection, they will be advised to speak to their healthcare provider.  
 
 C. Data Safety Monitoring Plan. 
A monitoring plan has been established to ensure that the data remain confidential and that the participants 
are not experiencing any harm from the intervention, or  experiencing significant increases in depression.  A 
committee to ensure that the plan is followed will be formed. The committee will meet twice a year to assess the activities of the study and any concerns or problems that may have occurred.  Members of the data safety 
monitoring board will include individuals who have demonstrated expertise in areas related to the project and 
have agreed to serve in this capacity.  Patrick Lustman, PhD, is a Professor and psychologist in the School of Medicine at Washington University in St. Louis, MO.  He has extensive experience in the assessment of 
depression in obese individuals as well as those with type [ADDRESS_449092]. Patsy Marie Brannon Professor 
of Nutritional Sciences, Cornell University & Director of the Cornell Dietetic Internship Research who has 
expertise on nutrition and development including vitamin D, maternal and child nutrition, diet-gene regulation of the placenta and pancreas is willing to serve.  [CONTACT_360241] is a  Member of the Steering Committee on the International Vitamin D Standardization Project (2010 to present), Member of the IOM Committee on the DRI’s for Calcium and Vitamin D (2009-2010), member of Technical Expert Panel for the Systematic Evidence Based Review on “The Relationships of Vitamin D and Calcium Intakes to Nutrient Status Indicators and Health 
Outcomes.”, Tufts Evidence Based Practice Center, 2008-2009, Co-chair of the Federal Interagency Working 
Group on Vitamin D (2006-2008). At the data and safety meetings, they will review the research protocol, plans for data collection and safety monitoring and be responsible for noting adherence to the following:   
(1) The Progress of Study and Safety of Participants:  The Data Safety Monitoring Plan (attached) has been 
modified to be congruent with the study protocol.  Since there is no upper limit for HBA1c, an increase in 
HBA1c of   3% or more will be monitored. The following data will be examined to evaluate safety issues: adverse events, attrition rates, reasons for attrition, and rates of adherence to treatment intervention at all 
contact [CONTACT_360222].  In order to provide a level of protection to all study subjects, the following will be specifically 
included for monitoring and follow-up:  (1) number (if any) of patients who had suicidal ideation during the course of the study, and adherence to safety protocol (2) number (if any) of patients who have experienced a 30% increase in the CES-D score and  recommendations by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Halaris for follow-up and referral (3) number (if any) of patients who began medication for mental health or sought additional therapy. 
 (4) number (if any) patients who had hypercalcemia or vi tamin D levels greater than 100 ng/dl or symptoms of 
vitamin D toxicity and recommendations by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Emanuele. 
 
26 
 (2) Compliance with the reporting of adverse events:  Determining whether all adverse events and/or 
unanticipated problems were reported in writing to Loyola University Medical Center within 48 hours of 
discovery of the incident.   
 (3) Data Accuracy and Protocol Compliance:   Evaluating records for the training of personnel and other 
protocol documents as needed.  All staff personnel will be required to have human subjects training, HIPPA training, and training on all study protocols (Appendix).   Dr . Penckofer will have weekly meetings with the project 
staff and co-investigators. She will also train the staff personnel regarding all procedures (phone as well as in-
person protocol), and meet with them as they facilitate the recruitment of study participants and schedule them 
for data collection. Training will also be provided for the research nurse on the use of the C-DIS. [CONTACT_360230] will observe phone as well as on-site screening to ensure that the protocol is being followed, and provide feedback. At baseline, three and six month data collectio n points, the following will be done by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Penckofer 
and the staff to ensure protocol compliance: 1) reviewing the informed consent and HIPPA documents; 2) 
checking questionnaire booklets for missing data prior to study subjects leaving the data collection site; 3) 
running standards for the hemoglobin A1c prior to subject testing in order to ensure the accuracy of the lab test. [CONTACT_360230] will obtain reproducibility data from off-site labs during the times that study specimens are processed.   
D. Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Subjects and Others.   
At this time, preliminary data from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_360152] D may be beneficial for improvement of 
depressive symptoms.  However, given the need for a randomized clinical trial to determine whether the pi[INVESTIGATOR_360153], at this time it is unknown if women will benefit from participating in the study.   To our knowledge, there are no studies that have examined whether treating persons with diabetes for depressive symptoms using vitamin D supplementation.  Therefore, our study will serve as a new and 
important contribution to our understanding of whether im provement of their nutritional state by [CONTACT_1996] D 
supplementation can be effective in improving both mental and physical outcomes.  Practice initiated 
interventions to improve the quality of care for depression management in patients with diabetes may also   substantially increase the welfare of these patients, particularly as it relates to their own self-management, however, this has not been well studied either. 
  
E. Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained. Given the high cost of treating depression, its prevalence in 
persons with diabetes, particularly women, studying the benefit of vitamin D supplementation for this group has significant impact.  With an improvement in depression,  there may be an improvement in self-care behaviors 
which is also being examined and has not been well studied relative to depression. Finally, studying vitamin D supplementation for the effects on blood pressure also has important clinical implications as research 
examining this outcome is limited.    In clinical studies that have explored vitamin D and mood outcomes (other than Jorde et al.) the amount of vitamin D has been low, the duration of supplementation short, and blood levels were not measured (23).  The proposed study is unique in that the amount of vitamin D to be administered is currently what is recommended for obese individuals (34), thus the translation of study findings to practice is significant.   The most important benefit of vitamin D supplementation if effective, is its low cost 
(as low as $3 per month) and affordability to the general public. Given its low cost, association with minimal 
side effects (36), that [ADDRESS_449093] negative effects on weight and metabolic control (100), that depression is higher in women than men (7) especially in diabetes, this study can benefit the general public.     Inclusion of Women and Minorities   Depression occurs more often in women with diabetes than men with 
diabetes, and over 25% of women with diabetes have depression (7). It has been reported that depression is associated with poorer diet, physical activity and medication adherence for women with diabetes (6, 72-76).   Having both diabetes and depression is associated with a significantly increased risk for complications, including cardiac mortality which occurs more often in women with type 2 diabetes (53).  The Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) reported that low vitamin D intake was associated with significant depressive symptoms (27).  
Preliminary data has suggested it has s potential benefit for depression treatment for women (33).  The 
Nurses’ Health Study reported that women were twice as likely to develop hypertension if vitamin D levels were less than 15 ng/ml   (83).  Pfeifer and colleagues (91) reported a 7% decrease in systolic blood pressure in 
[ADDRESS_449094] low vitamin D and high levels of depression, this group is being studied as efficacy is more likely to be demonstrated.  If results are significant, men could also be examined (although they don’t have as high risk for depression or the same body fat content as women which contributes to their low vitamin D)  to assess for gender differences on dosing and impact on health outcomes.  The investigator will recruit almost half minority (40%), which is consistent with the proportion that currently seeks care at the 
primary sites of data collection.    
 Inclusion of Children  
It would not be reasonable to include children (less than 21) since the dose proposed for this study has only been tested in several adult populations.  Given the recent increase in childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes, it 
may be possible to develop a study for vitamin D supplementation in the future for this age group.

 Appendix  2 Protocal for Putonti  Lab at Lakeshore  Campus: 
 
Nanosep Tube Preparation  
 Materials Required: Nanosep Tube, molecular grade Wa ter, 70% Ethanol, 1% BSA in PBS, microcentrifuge
 
 
1. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_360158] 500 μL of 70% Ethanol and centrifuge  the Column at 14,000g for [ADDRESS_449100] the flow-through - May need to  use a pi[INVESTIGATOR_360159]  
b. When centrifuging during any of these steps be sure  not to over-centrifuge as this will cause the 
membrane to dry out 
2. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_360160] 500 μL of PCR Water and centri fuge at 14,000g for 7 minutes 
a. Remove the flow-through - May need to  use a pi[INVESTIGATOR_360159] 
3. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_360160] 500 μL of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and leave for at least an hour at room temperature 
a. The BSA serves as the passivation step so that the membrane is not overl y sticky and prevent the 
capture of non-phage materials 
b. Do not centrifuge the BSA 
c. This is a potential pause point if one cannot do the whole preparat ion in one day - Can be left 
overnight at room temperature  
4. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_360161] 
a. Be sure not to scratch the membrane when pi[INVESTIGATOR_42115] ( can tilt to limit contact) 
5. Wash the membrane with PCR Water 
a. When washing use approximately 50 μL of PCR water 
b. Hold the column at an angle and dispense the wa ter at the top of the me mbrane and remove at 
the bottom - Repeat until the wa ter begins to appear cloudy 
c. Be careful not to scratch the membrane  
6. Add another 500 μL of PCR Water to the Column a nd centrifuge at 14,000g for 5 minutes 
a. Remove the flow-through - May need to  use a pi[INVESTIGATOR_360159] 
7. If not using the column w ithin 20 minutes, add 100 μL of PCR Water to the Column and store at 4° C. 
Try to use refrigerated columns within 1 week.  
a. This layer of water will prevent th e membrane from drying out before use 
 
Concentration Protocol 
 
Materials Required: Prepared Nanosep Spin Column, urine sample, PBS, microcentrifuge  
 
1. Add [ADDRESS_449101] the flow-through 
Optional Steps 8-10: 8. Add the [ADDRESS_449102] the supernatant and add the 50 μL from Step 10 to the pellet  
13. Use 20 μL of PBS to wash the Nanosep membrane 
a. Use the same washing technique shown in Step 5 of the Nanosep Preparation  
14. After washing the membrane, add the 20 μL to the pellet

Background Information  
Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is characterized by [CONTACT_638710][INVESTIGATOR_638694]. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) accounts 
for 80 -90% of SDB cases.1 OSA is a chronic condition characterized by [CONTACT_638711] (hypopnea) or total 
obstruction (apnea) of the airway.  The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) defines 
OSA as the occurrence of daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], loud snoring, witnessed breathing interruptions, 
or awakenings due to gaspi[INVESTIGATOR_638695] 5 obstructive respi[INVESTIGATOR_481204] (apneas, hypopneas or respi[INVESTIGATOR_638696]) per hou r of sleep .2 Data on 
the prevalence of OSA may vary depending on population and measurement criteria (e.g., 
diagnosis test used, scoring criteria, AHI threshold, etc.). A review of 24 epi[INVESTIGATOR_638697] 1987 and 2016 found that the prevalence of OSA (apnea -hypopnea index 
[AHI] ≥5) in the general population ranged from 9% to 38%.3 Obstructive Sleep Apnea has been 
associated with cardiovascular diseases,4–[ADDRESS_854251] treatment for OSA17, and has been used since the early 
1980’s18. A large systematic review and meta -analysis involving [ADDRESS_854252] effective in reducing AHI and excessive daytime 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_638698] .19 PAP therapy includes  continuous (CPAP) and bi -level 
(BiPAP) therapy.  Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is the most common form of 
PAP administration for OSA, in which the pressure of the air breathed is continuous and 
constant20. Bi-Level Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) is an alternative to CPAP and provides a 
higher pressure during inhalation and a lower pressure during exhalation21. By [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_638699], adequate breathing is maintained and the individual does not experience oxygen 
desaturation and arousal from sleep, leading to overall improved sleep quality and quality of life. 
Bi-Level PAP for OSA is provided in two modes of therapy, BiPAP -S where a fixed IPAP and 
EPAP setting is prescribed, and autoBiPAP, where the device auto titrates IPAP and EPAP 
levels based on the patient’s airway state throughout the night. PAP therapy has been shown to 
decrease daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], an d improve overall quality of life.22,23  
 
In addition to the type of therapy administered, the patient interface system is an important 
component of PAP therapy delivery and is critical to adherence and compliance to treatment.24 
Patient interface systems ( i.e., nasal masks, full -face masks, and nasal prongs or “pi[INVESTIGATOR_50151]”) 
connect the patient to the therapy device. Although  there are many mask designs that use a 
wide variety of materials, these systems have typi[INVESTIGATOR_638700], 
limiting patients’ acceptance with PAP. Common critiques of the masks include a lack of 
comfort, difficulty applying and adju sting the mask, mask movement requiring readjustments, 
noise, aesthetics of the mask and the tubing, skin irri tation or trauma, obstruction of vision, and 
eye irritation from leaks.[ADDRESS_854253] full -

Description of the Intervention Studied  
Investigational Products  
There are no investigational products in this benchmark clinical study.  
 Produc ts Cleared for Marketing by [CONTACT_55257]  
• Amar a View  Minimal Contact  [CONTACT_638713]  (MCFFM)  
The Amara View Full -Face Mask is a minimal contact [CONTACT_638714][INVESTIGATOR_5770] (Murrysville, PA)  that covers the mouth and seals under the nose  compared to 
traditional full -face masks which seal over the nose.  The Amara View mask is intended to 
reduce discomfort on the bridge of the nose. There is no forehead arm, offering patients an 
enhanced design to keep the field of vision clear. The mask consists of a cushion assembly  with 
three  cushion sizes , and a modular frame assembly connected to an entrainment elbow and 
headgear  with two  size options . The silicone cushion seals under the nose and around the outer  
perimeter of the patient’s  mouth  and contains a cutout that allows the nostrils to inhale and 
exhale through  when the mask is under pressure.  The cushion assembly can be removed from 
the frame assembly for cleaning or for replacement of the cushion assembly. This allows for one 
frame size to attach to all three  cushion sizes. A quick release tube with a built -in swivel 
provides a means for connecting the mask to the breathing circ uit. The mask can be secured to 
the patient via headgear, which attaches to the frame with either magnetic clips or non -magnetic 
talon clips. Amara View uses a traditional tube in front of the mask with a pig tail tube.  
The Amara View MCFFM is for single -patient use in the home  or multi -patient use in the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/institutional environment. The mask is intended to be used on patients (>66lbs/30kg) for 
whom CPAP or bi -level therapy has been prescribed.  
• AirFit F40  Minimal Contact [CONTACT_638715] F40 is a minimal contact [CONTACT_638716]  (San Diego, CA)  that rests 
softly and securely under the patients nose and is desi gned to let patients sleep in any position 
and move freely throughout the night. The mask consists of three cushion sizes and three  
headgear sizes.  Headgear adjustments  can be made with magnetic clips that easily snap on 
and off.  
The AirFit F40 MCFFM is for single -patient reuse in the hom e environment . The mask is 
intended to be used on patients w eighing more than 66lbs (30kg), who have been prescribed 
non-invasive C PAP o r Bi-level positive airway pressure  therapy.

Study Design  
This is an open -label , randomized cross over trial, comparing patient feedback between the 
Amara View MCFFM and the AirFit F40 MCFFM. This study will recruit approximately  40 adult 
patients who are established on PAP or Bi -Level therapy at the time of enrollment.  
Adults who are currently adherent to PAP or Bi -Level therapy will be recruited through sleep 
clinics. Willing and eligible participants will undertake baseline  data collection before using 
either the Amara View or AirFit F40 masks.  Therapy will be delivered using their clinically 
prescribed PAP or Bi -Level device  with no modification to settings . 
The study will be completed according to applicable Good Clinical Practices and the Declaration 
of Helsinki. The study will be monitored onsite and/or remotely, as described below.  
Randomization  
The order in which participants will use the two ma sks will be randomized.  A fixed allocation 
permuted -block  randomization strategy will be used. Randomization will be administered  
through the electronic data capture system.  
Blinding  
There will be no blinding in this trial.   
Study Procedures  
Recruitment  
Participants will be recruited via sleep clinics contracted to recruit participants within the United 
States. Recruitment may involve a combination of in -person recruitment during clinical 
appointments, phone calls, and emails.  Study staff will be responsible for assessment of 
inclusion and exclusion criteria (listed below).  
Scheduling will be conducted by [CONTACT_779]. Participants who are willing to enroll will be scheduled 
for an in -person visit to provide informed consent and complete study procedures.  
Baseline Visit  (Visit 1)  
Consent, Eligibility and Baseline Information  
During the baseline  visit, the study site coordinator  will review the Informed Consent Form (ICF) 
with the participant explaining the details of the study and answering any questions the participant 
may have about the study. If the participant is willing to take part in the study, the ICF will be 
signed and dated by [CONTACT_638720]. A copy 
of each participant’s signed ICF will be given to them for their records.  
Those who provide consent will then complete the Demographics Questionnaire (see Appendix 
I), which collects information about age, gender, sex, race, and ethnicity. Next, they will complete 
the Baseline Survey (see Appendix II) to collect information abou t the make and model of their 
prescribed mask and PAP device. The participants will then complete the Eligibility Questionnaire 
(see Appendix III) to confirm entry criteria.

eligibility requirements.  
Mask Fitting  and Use  
At the initi al visit, p articipants will undergo a fitting of  the mask they are randomized to start the 
study with ; either  the Amara View or the AirFit F4 [ADDRESS_854256] pressure applied for up to 15 minutes using his or her own PAP 
machine at therapeutic pressure, and an assessment of mask fit will be performed. If the 
participant’s PAP device is not available, they will be fitted  with the mask and will have a 
pressure of up to 10 cm H 2O applied (if participants do not know their therapy pressure)  for up 
to 15 minutes using a PAP device provided by [CONTACT_779] . A new bacteria filter  and tubing  will be 
used and a disinfection log will be maintained when/if study equipment is used by [CONTACT_638721]. Participants may be fitted  with up to three mask sizes  for the mask . A Mask Fitting 
Survey (Appendix IV) will be used to capture the participant’s prescribed pressure, mask 
(cushion/frame) sizes and fitting observations  for the first study mask . 
After the mask fitting, participants will be given the first study mask to take home  and provided 
with the Instructions for Use . They will be encouraged to use the mask for the full [ADDRESS_854257] issues with the 
recommended cushion  and/or headgear sizes .  Participants may be provided with additional 
mask components/sizes as needed.  Any change to cushion or headgear sizing during the trial 
will be documented in EDC.  
It is anticipated that the consent, eligibility, baseline/demographic data collection, and mask fitting 
will take approximately [ADDRESS_854258] issues with the recommended cushion and/or headgear size as 
needed.  
If participants did not return the first study  mask at the second study visit, they will be asked to 
bring it to the third study visit.

• Non-compliance, as defined by [CONTACT_638725]/or email contact [CONTACT_638726] a study representative or failure to attend study appointment(s) (lost to 
follow -up), or being unwilling/unable to consistently use PAP (at least 4 days per week) 
along with the provided mask  
• If the study  mask/s provided is/are found to be inadequate for use (e.g., seal, stability, 
comfort, air flow, etc.)  
• If eligibility status changes during the study and the participant no longer meets inclusion 
or exclusion criteria  
The study team will document whether or not each participant completed the study.  If, for any 
participant, study treatment or assessments were discontinued, the reason will be recorded.  No 
further data will be collected following study withdrawal . Each patient’s health care provider will 
be responsible for follow -up care following study withdrawal with communication from research 
staff.  
Participants may withdraw from the study at any time.  Withdrawal from the study will not affect 
their medical treatment or future participation in a research study.   
Treatment of Subjects  
PAP therapy will be managed and continue throughout the entire trial duration, using participants’ 
clinically prescribed devices and settings.  All participants will remain under the care of their sleep 
health care provider.  
Assessment of Efficacy and/or Performance  
This study will assess the effectiveness and performance of the Amara View mask as measured 
by [CONTACT_638727], leak , air pressure values, and adherence. Performance of the Amara View 
mask will be compared to the A irFit F40 mask for participants using a Philips PAP device.  
Assessment of Safety  
Overall, Philips has determined the risks in this study are  minimal . Both mas ks being used in the 
trial are cleared for marketing by [CONTACT_55257] ; therefore , it was determined  participation in this 
study will not expose the participant to anything greater than normal risks associated with  these 
and similar  marketed patient  interface systems. This study presents no more than minimal risk of 
harm to participants and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required 
outside of the research context with a Class II medical device.  
Trial surveys will include an assessment of breathing comfort. Data will be reviewed after each 
interval. A ‘critical to quality’ (CTQ) meeting will be prompted if an incidence of at least 20% of 
any breathing issue is reported and/or at least 10% incidenc e of one or more of the following 
breathing issues is reported: difficulty inhaling, difficulty exhaling, feeling a lack of pressure, 
feeling too much pressure, feeling of air restriction, feeling of shortness of breath (see Appendix 
V and Appendix VI ). A “critical to quality” meeting will involve a review of safety data with the 
clinical and project teams and may prompt further discussion on the course of the trial overall.

Safety Monitoring  
Adverse event (AE) means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an 
intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention related . An AE or suspected 
adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it 
results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -threatening adverse event, inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10909], a persistent or significant incapacity or 
substantial disruption of the ability t o conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth 
defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
An Unanticipated Adverse Device Event (UADE) is any serious adverse effect on health or 
safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that 
effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, seve rity, or degree of incidence 
in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any 
other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or 
welfare of subjects. Other i mportant medical events which may not result in any of the outcomes 
above, but which may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes above, may in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], be considered a UADE.  
Adverse Event Classification and Reporting  
The severity of all AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_638703], moderate, or severe 
using the following guidelines:  
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the subject’s 
daily activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating. Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “seriou s”.) 
All AEs must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_638704]/her clinical 
judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be classified using the categories below. 
In a clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect.  
• Not Related: The event is not known to be an effect of the study product/study activity. 
There is no temporal relationship between the study product/study activity and the event 
onset. An alternate etiology has been established. The subject never received the study 
product/study activity.

• Possibly Related: The event is a lesser known or possible effect of the study 
product/study activity. There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship and a 
reasonable temporal relationship between the study product/study activity and the event 
onset. However, other factors may have contributed to the event.  
• Causally Related: The event is a known effect of the study product/study activity (e.g., 
listed in the protocol).  There is a temporal relationship between the study product/study 
activity and the event onset.  The event stops with discontinuation of the study 
product/study activity (and reoccurs on restarting).  
The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to the 
attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study subject presenting for 
medical care, or upon review by a study monitor.  
All AEs will be captured on the appropriate (e)CRF. Information to be collected includes event 
description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product 
(assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a d iagnosis), and time of 
resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented 
appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of 
the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
PI [INVESTIGATOR_638705]. At each study visit, the investigator 
will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit.  
If an SAE or UADE occurs, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_638706] a Serious Adverse Event or 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect Report and submit to the study sponsor for review as soon 
as possible (e.g., within 24 hours of awareness) and no later than 3 calend ar days after site’s 
awareness of event. As the site gains more information (i.e., admission records, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49333]) a new report with the new information should be submitted to the 
Sponsor. The study sponsor is responsible for conducting an  evaluation of the SAE or UADE 
and shall report the results of such evaluation to the reviewing IRB and other agencies as 
applicable.  
Device Deficiencies  
A device deficiency refers to the inadequacy in the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, or 
performance of an investigational device, including malfunction, use errors or inadequacy in 
information supplied by [CONTACT_3455]. All device def iciencies will be documented on the 
device deficiency tracking form. If the device deficiency led to a UADE, the SAE or UADE Report 
should be completed as noted above.  
If a device deficiency had the potential to lead to a UADE but did not result in one, it should be 
documented on the device deficiency tracking form and submitted to the study sponsor for review

Statistical Methods  
Determination of Sample Size  
This study is not statistically power ed. The  sample size  of approximately [ADDRESS_854264] deviation, minimum, maximum, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) for the mean, and number of observations.  For categorical variables, frequencies and 
percentages will be presented. All formal analyses will be conducted using SAS®, and statistical 
comparisons will be considered significant at an alpha of 0.05, with adjustments for multiple 
comparisons, as applic able.  There are no statistical criteria for terminating the study, and any 
deviations from the original statistical plan will be noted in the analysis report.  
Participant Disposition  
Participant disposition, including the total number of participants enrolled, randomized, completed 
and early terminations, will be presented.  In addition, a listing will be provided with the reasons 
for early termination.  
Statistical Analyses  
Mask attribute ratings, scaled [ADDRESS_854265] 
sizes  and confidence intervals of the paired differences  between the masks  [Amara View  – 
AirFit F40 ]. The paired t -test and nonparametric Wilcoxon Signed -Ranks test  will further 
evaluate the trends . In cases where one test calculates a p -value below 0.05 and the other 
indicates a p -value ≥0.05, the distributions of the paired differences will be inspected to 
determine which method better models the data. Participants will be excluded from the analysis 
of a given endpoint if they do not contribute a rating for both study  masks.  
Residual AHI, leak, air pressure, and average adherence will be extracted from the patients ’ 
PAP device data , and t he paired differences [Amara View – AirFit F40] will be evaluated as 
described a bove.  
Percentages and exact binomial confidence interval s will be calculated for categorical 
questions . The McNemar test will compare binary responses where the same questions  are 
answered  after the participants  try both masks.  
Net Promoter Scores (NPS) will be calculated for the question “Would you recommend this 
(Amara View FFM  or AirFit F40 ) mask to others?” where the percentage of detractors (ratings 0 -
6) is subtracted from the percentage promoters (ratings of 9 or 10) . Ratings of 7 -8 will be 
considered neutral. Relative NPS will be calculated as [ Amara View  NPS] – [AirFit F40  NPS].

Overall, the risks in this study are minimal and not expected to be different from those encountered 
by [CONTACT_638732]; however, potential risks are listed below, 
and they will be described in the ICF and will be repeat ed verbally to the participants during the 
consenting process.  
Possible risks or effects from use of the product s in this research study include, but are not limited 
to: 
• The presence of redness, marks, indentations and/or pressure wherever the mask or 
headgear touches the face.  
• Skin irritation, skin breakdown, bruising or blisters where the mask or headgear comes in 
contact [CONTACT_347801].  
• Discomfort or irritation (itchiness, excessive tearing, burning, dryness, puffiness, infection, 
blurred vision) of the eyes.  
• Eye pain . 
• Dry mouth or upper airway.  
• Nasal irritation, a feeling of a dry nose, nose bleeds or excessive running of the nose.  
• Stomach distension, belching.  
• Claustrophobia.  
• The study  mask may deliver airflow differently from what the participant is accustomed to, 
and as such, breathing may feel more difficult than what they would experience with a 
different mask.  
• Unusual chest discomfort , breathing discomfort,  or shortness of breath.  
• Headaches or increased drowsiness.  
• In rare cases, the mask may cause tooth, gum , or jaw soreness or aggravate an existing 
dental condition.  
• Pressure or pain in the ears.

• The participant’s condition may not improve or may worsen while participating in this 
study.  
Careful mask application, sizing, and adjustment should address or correct mask -related issues.  
Participant s should  be instructed to  avoid overtightening the headgear  and to only use the mask 
when the device is on and blowing air to avoid rebreathing exhaled air  and potential suffocation . 
Note that some rebreathing may occur at low pressures. Breathing discomfort should be 
transient or can be addressed with counseling. However, all of these complications are normally 
encountered while using PAP therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], a nd there should be no additional risk from 
participating in this study given that participants will be recruited on the basis of being 
established on therapy.  
If a participant reports they have experienced an adverse event, they will be directed to contact 
[CONTACT_638733].  
Participation Risk:  
• The loss of confidentiality is a potential risk of being in the study, but the site and sponsor  
will do everything to make sure that participant information is protected.  
• Participants may experience frustration, fatigue, and anxiety while completing the study 
activities.  
 
There may be a possibility of unanticipated or unknown risks; however, for this activity Philips 
has determined that this risk is low.  
Publication and Registration  
This study will be registered on ClinicalTrials. gov. There may be  plans to publish the results of 
this trial, beyond the use of the data in marketing materials.

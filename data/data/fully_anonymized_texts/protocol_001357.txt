General Statistical Met hods and Types of Analyses  
Sample Size  
At least  300 subjects (100 each  for the two active arms, and 50 each for the two saline 
solution  arms) will be randomly assigned to study treatment such that approximately 
90 evaluable participants per active arm and 45 per saline solution  arm complete the 
study , assuming a 10% dropout rate . 
Primary Efficacy Analyses:  
The primary evaluation of efficacy of the active arms will be against a combined 
control arm (with BID and QID saline solution ). Sensitivity analysis ma y be 
undertaken for dosing -regimen matching control (that is, QID active vs. QID saline 
solution ). 
The primary analysis will be performed to compare the week 8 difference in the 
change from baseline in CFS between the active NOV03 groups and the saline 
solution  groups . The comparison will be conducted using a repeated measures model 
with treatment, site , visit, and treatment by [CONTACT_733098], 
baseline as a continuous covariate, and using an unstructured covariance matrix. To 
establish evidence of efficacy in this proof of concept study, the hypothesis tests will 
be one-sided and performed at the 0.05 significance level.

 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Dry Eye Disease  (DED)  
Dry Eye Disease (DED) is defined by [CONTACT_72068] (DEWS) as a  
multifactorial disease of the ocular su rface characterized by a loss of homeostasis of the 
tear film, and accompanied by [CONTACT_72069], in which tear film instability and 
hyperosmolarity, ocular surface inflammation and damage, and neurosensory 
abnor malities play etiological roles .2 Estimates of the prevalence of dry eye vary 
considerably, depending on the crite ria used to define the disease , but i n the [LOCATION_002] 
(US), it has been estimated that as many as 3.[ADDRESS_1001552] DED , with a projected 40% increase in  the number of patients affected 
by [ADDRESS_1001553] Rational e 
NOV03 is a sterile ophthalmic eye drop  formulation , developed for the treatment of the 
signs and symptoms of DED associated with  meibomian gland dysfunction  (MGD ). 
It is a one component product consisting of  perfluorohexyloctane develope d to 
supplement  the lipid layer leading to reduced evaporation of the tear film and thereby 
[CONTACT_733099]. As a single component product,  it is free of excipi[INVESTIGATOR_733091], surfactants and preservatives. NOV03  is developed with the goal to  provide patients 
with DED due to MGD a n effective treatment option with a new mode of action addressing 
directly the lipid layer. Further a dvantages compared to existing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_733092], improved tolerability, and a decrease in the  visual disturbance 
associated with oily eye drops, emulsions or ointments.  
The sole ingredient of NOV03 is the anhydrous semifluorinated alkane, 
perfluorohexyloctane  
. Liquid 
semifluorinated alkanes are physically, physiologically and chemically inert, colorless, 
laser stable compounds with the same refractory index as water. They do not undergo 
metabolism i n the human body.3 Perfluorohexyloctane sh ows a low surface tension of 19. 65 
mNm, which leads  to excellent spreading activities on the ocular surface and to the 
formation of small droplet. On the ocular surface , NOV03 forms a thin film together with 
tear lipi[INVESTIGATOR_733093] , which in its natural function to reduce the 
evaporation of the tear film  and reducing sharing forces.  
1.3 Trial Rational e 
NOV03 might be valuable for patients with DED due t o MGD, as the loss of the lipid layer 
in these patients leads to increased evaporation of the tears. Initial clinical data from 
observational studies NT -0017 and NT -0028 consistently  indicate that NOV03 is efficacious 
in treating signs and symptoms of mild to moderate evaporative DED and mild to moderate 

NOV03 (  Perfluorohexyloctane)  Sponsor:  NOVALIQ GmbH  
Clinical  Trial Protocol # NVU -002 07 December 2017 FINAL V2.0

 DED and MGD. A mechanistic clinical study NT -004 demonstrated that NOV03 increase 
tear film thickness (TFT) and lipi d layer thickness (LLT) over saline solution, and therefore 
provides further clinical evidence supportive for this indication.  
This first US study is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety in a larger population  
versus a control in a double masked  fashion. It is powered to demonstrate efficacy for a 
sign endpoint total CSF (NEI grad ing). Other sign and symptom endpoints will be explored 
as well as the dosing regimen.  
Data from this study will serve to plan the phase [ADDRESS_1001554] been treated with NovaTears® (NOVALIQ GmbH, Heidelberg, 
[LOCATION_013]) in four post -marketing studies, with a treatment duration between 4 and 12 
weeks.  
Safety and local tolerability of NovaTears® during these four post marketing studies was 
found to be excellent when used at the recommended dose of one drop per eye, 4 times a 
day. In all four studies, no changes in intraocular pressure ( IOP) or best-corrected visual 
acuity ( BCVA ) was observed, nor were clinically significant findings with slit lamp 
examinations. Out of a total of [ADDRESS_1001555] market studies, 27 AEs were 
reported from 17 subjects treated with NovaTears®, 12 of which were considered possibly, 
probably or definitely related to the use of NovaTears®. All cases reported to be related 
described symptoms of mild to moderate ocular irritation , which disa ppeared shortly after 
discontinuation of the product. No serious adverse events ( SAEs ), incidents or deaths 
occurred.  
Furthermore, market vigilance data collected to date from >[ADDRESS_1001556] majority of these medical complaints were  mild cases  of ocular irritations.  
The observational studies consistently indicate that NOV03 is efficacious in treating signs 
and symptoms of mild to modera te evaporative DED and mild to moderate DED caused by 
[CONTACT_290422].  A statistically significant increase in tear film fluid was observed in study NT -001, 
while tear film stability, as assessed by [CONTACT_733100] , was shown to significantly improve in both 
the NT -001 and NT -002 studies. Comparable to these results, a significant decrease in the 
average OSDI© score was also observed in studies NT -001 and NT -002 together with 
decreases in the intensity of corneal staining (and conjunctival staining in NT -002). No

 change was obse rved for any of these parameters  in NT -003 in patients with DED due to 
GvHD. Study NT -004 demonstrated that NovaTears® increase TFT and LLT over saline 
solution, and therefore provides further clinical evidence supportive of the mode of action 
of NovaTears®.  
In summary, b ased on the preclinical and clinical data obtained to date , risks to subj ects in 
the planned NVU -[ADDRESS_1001557] ophthalmo logical safety 
assessments will be performed during the entire treatment  period in the study at 2, 4 and 8 
weeks. The efficacy demonstrated to date is supportive of increased benefits in addressing 
the evaporative aspects of DED by [CONTACT_733101], and suggests relief of DED 
symptoms and signs, that is possibly more sustainable than comparator saline treatments. 
NOV03 therefore provides a favorable risk -benefit treatment profile to patients with m ild 
to moderate DED and the NVU -002 study is designed to further assess this positive profile .

2.2 Overall Study Design and Investigational Plan  
This study is a  phase 2, m ulti-center, randomized, double -masked, saline -controlled study 
to evaluate  the effec t of NOV03 ( perfluorohexyloctane ) at two different dosing 
regimens on signs and symptoms of Dry Eye Disease.  Approximately [ADDRESS_1001558] -reported history of DED  in both eyes and 
who meet  all ot her study eligibility criteria will be randomized , stratified by [CONTACT_3725],  2:2:1:1  to 
receive 1 of 4 treatment s: 
Treatment 1: NOV03 (  Perfluorohexyloctane), 4 times daily (QID)  
Treatment 2: NOV03 ( Perfluorohexyloctane), 2 times daily (BID)  
Treatment 3 : Saline  (0.9% sodium chloride solution), QID  
Treatment 4: Saline  (0.9% sodium chloride solution), BID  
Each active treatment group will be comprised of [ADDRESS_1001559] of two periods: a 14-day screening period and a 57-day treatment 
period  (See Appendix 1).  
2.3 End of Study Definition  
The end of the study for an individual patient is defined as that patient’s last clinic visit.  
The end of the study for the overall trial is defined as the finalization of the Clinical Study 
Report.  
2.4 Visit Descriptio n  
Refer to Appendix 1 for the Schedule of Visits and Measurements and Table 1 for the 
Study Flow Chart.  
Screening  (Visit 0)  
Subjects will be required to sign an Informed C onsent before comp leting any study rel ated 
procedure. At the screening visit, vital signs will be assessed and the subject will give blood 
for safety laboratory test s. They will also submit to a battery of tests to confirm the extent 
and severity of their symptoms and objective signs of dry eye . At least one eye must qualify 
with the following objective measures: Tear film break up time , Schirmer’s Test  
, and Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) defined as  MGD score .

Confidential  Page 21 of 88 
 Subjects who fail  to qualify for the study at screening may be rescreened  as described in 
section  3.5 
Baseline Visit Day 1 (Visit 1)  
On Day 1 (Visit 1), eligible subjects will be evaluated for baseline signs and symptoms  of 
dry eye d isease. After randomization subjects at selected sites will give a blood sample to 
be used for PK. Subjects  will be given a 14-day supply and  will self-administer a single  
drop of the study medication into each eye  at the clinic . Each subject will be given  a diary 
to record that their doses were taken. Study staff will help the subject to understand how to 
use the diary and when the remaining doses should be taken.  
Visits 2 -4 
Subjects will return to the clinic on Day 15±1 (Visit 2), 29±2 (Visit 3), and 57±2 (Visit 4) 
to be evaluated for signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. During this period , subjects  will 
dose NOV03 or the saline solution QID and BID , depending on their assigned group . The 
unused portion of the study medication should be returned to the c linic and a new study 
medication kit will be dispensed. The diary will be checked. At Visit 4, vital signs will be 
evaluated and a second blood draw will be performed for PK  at selected sites . The diary 
will be collected at the clinic during each visit . Subjects will be dismissed from the study 
after all Visit [ADDRESS_1001560] been completed.  
Early Termination  
Subjects who terminate early during the treatment period will be asked to complete  all 
safety assessments  as indicated on Visit 4 on the Schedule o f Visits and Measurements  prior 
to commencement of any alternative dry eye therapy (if at all possible). Subjects who are 
terminated early from the study will not be replaced.  
2.5 Study Flow  
All subjects will be expected to progress from screening thr ough study exit.   
 
There are no other side studies and all subjects will be 
evaluated  according to Table 1:

 7 ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the 
use of a drug in humans, whether or not the event is considered drug -related. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign ( eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease occurring after the subject  signed Informed Consent Form (ICF)   
without any judgment about causal ity.   
If there is a worsening of a medical condition that was present prior to the administration 
of the study drug , this should also be considered a new AE and reported. Any medical 
condition present prior to the administration of the study drug  that remains unchanged or 
improved should not be recorded as an AE at subsequent visits.  
Worsening of Dry Eye Disease  will be considered an AE only if the dry eye status of the 
subject exceeds their previous experiences with the condition. This will be determined by 
[CONTACT_733105].  
A clinically significant visual acuity decrease (defined as an increase of 0.22 or greater in 
logMAR score) from baseline (Visit 0) will be considered an Adverse Event.  
Study drug includes the investigational drug unde r evaluation and any comparator drug , 
placebo , or any other medications required by [CONTACT_733106].  
Documentation regarding the AE should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end date, 
severity, relation ship to study d rug, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign 
or symptom observed by [CONTACT_72078].  
7.1.1 Severity  
Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an AE 
as determined by [CONTACT_72079]/her by  [CONTACT_102]/ subject. The 
assessment of severity is made irrespective of relationship to study drug  or seriousness of 
the event and s hould be evaluated according to the following scale:  
• Mild : Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and does not 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate : Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Severe : Event is int olerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of 
therapy , and interferes with the subject’s daily activities.  
7.1.[ADDRESS_1001588] should be determined by [CONTACT_733107]:  

NOV03 (  Perfluorohexyloctane)  Sponsor:  NOVALIQ GmbH  
Clinical  Trial Protocol # NVU -002 07 December 2017 FINAL V2.0  
 
Confidential  Page 44 of 88 
  
• Suspected : A reasonable possibility exists that the investigational product 
caused the AE.  
• Not Suspected : A reasonable possibility does not exist that the investigational 
product caused the AE.  
Suspected adverse reaction means any AE fo r which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the investigational product caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the investigational product and the AE. 
Types of evidence that would suggest  a causal relationship between the investigational 
product and the AE include: a single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known 
to be strongly associated with IP exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -
Johnson Syndrome); one or more o ccurrences of an event that is not commonly associated 
with IP exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the IP (e.g., 
tendon rupture); an aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such 
as known consequences  of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other 
events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that 
indicates those events occur more frequently in the IP -treatment group than in a concurrent 
or histori cal control group . 
7.1.3 Expectedness  
The expectedness of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety information 
about the study drug s. Therefore,  the following definition s will be used : 
• Unexpected : An AE that is not listed in the investigator ’s broch ure in the Adverse 
Reaction  Section  at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  
• Expected : An AE that is listed in the investigator’s brochure in the Adverse 
Reaction Section at the specificity and severity that has been observed.  
• Not Applicable : Any AE that is unrelated to the study drug.  
The investigator should initially c lassif y the expectedness of  an AE, but the final 
classification  is subject to the Medical Monitor’s determination . 
7.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An AE is considered serious if, in the  view of either the investigator , medical monitor  or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death ; 
• A life-threatening AE; 
Note:  An AE is considered “li fe-threatening” if, in the view  of either the 
investigator , medical monitor  or sponsor, i ts occurrence places the subject at 
immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_158979] ;

Clinical  Trial Protocol # NVU -002 07 December 2017 FINAL V2.0  
 
Confidential  Page 45 of 88 
 Note:  T he term “inpatient h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any inpatient admission 
(even if less than 24 hours). For chronic or long -term inpatients, inpatient 
admission includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care 
inpatient unit. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_733096]: emergency room visits; 
outpatient/same -day/ambulatory procedures; observation/short stay units; 
rehabilitation facilities; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593]; nursing homes; or clinical 
research/phase 1 units.  
Note:  The term “prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n” refers to any 
extension of an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_459725].  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disru ption of the ability t o 
conduct normal life functions ; 
Note:  A serious adverse event (SAE) specifically related to visual threat would 
be interpreted as any potential impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes ( e.g. 
hemorrhage, retinal detachment, central  corneal ulcer or damage to the optic 
nerve).  
• A congenital anomal y/birth defect . 
• Important Medical Events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment,  they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergen cy room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

All information relevant to the SAE  must be r ecorded on the appropriate case report forms. 
The investigator is obligated to pursue and obtain information requested by  
[CONTACT_733109],  and/or the sponsor  in addition to that information reported on the 
case report form. All subjects experienci ng a SAE  must be followed up and the outcome 
reported.  
The investigator must  obtain and maintain in his/her files all pertinent medical records, 
information , and medical judgments from colleagues who assisted in the treatment and 
follo w-up of the subject; provide  Product Safety  and the study sponsor with a 
complete case history , which includes a statement as to whether the event was or was not 
suspected to be related to the use of the study drug; and inform the IRB of the AE within 
their guidelines for  reporting SAEs . 
All SAEs will be reported from the start of the study product . All SAEs will be followed

the study treatment assignment from the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). If 
possible, the medical emergency should be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to 
obtaining the treatment assignment, or as soon after as possible. The Sponsor may unmask 
for regulatory submission determination of an SAE when necessary (see Section  7.3.1 ). 
In a non -emergency situation, when a code break is required, it must be discussed with the  
Medical monitor  and/or  Product Safety  and the study sponsor . The code break 
must be  approved in writing  by [CONTACT_1034].  
If the randomization code for a subject is  broken, the Investigator will record the date and 
reason for lifting the mask  for that subject in the source documents. Upon unmasking, t he 
subject will be withdrawn from the study and should complete both the Early Termination 
and Follow -up procedures.  
Study staff will examine and reconcile s tudy medication orders, records of receipts, 
dispensing records, and inventory forms throughout the study  (see Section 9.5.2 ).

 8 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES AND METHODS OF ANALYSES  
8.1 Analysis Populations  
The following analysis populations will be considered:  
• All Subjects – All subjects who sign the ICF  
• Modified Intention -to-Treat  – Modified Intention -to-Treat ( mITT) includes all 
subjects random ly assigned to study treatment and who take  at least 1 dose of 
study treatment.  Subjects  will be analyzed according to the treatment they are 
randomized to . 
• Per Protocol Population  – The Per Protocol (PP) population includes subjects in 
the safety population who do not have significant protocol dev iations and who 
complete the study. Protocol deviations will be assessed prior to database lock 
and unmasking. The PP population will be analyzed using observed data only 
for efficacy variables. Subjects in the PP population will be analyzed as treated . 
• Safety Population  – The safety population includes all subjects who have 
received at least one dose of the investigational product . The safety population 
will be analyzed for all safety assessments. Subjects in the Safety population 
will be analyzed as treat ed.  
• PK Population  – The PK population includes all subjects with an evaluable PK 
sample. The PK population will be used to summarize all perfluorohexyloctane 
blood concentrations.  
The statistical analysis of safety data will be performed for the safety po pulation. The 
analysis of efficacy data will primarily be performed for the mITT population . The 
efficacy analysis based  on the PP population will serve  as the sensitivity analyses.  
8.2 Statistical Hypotheses  
The following two sets of hypotheses will be tested  as the primary hypotheses of the study:  
H01: The difference in the mean change from baseline to Week 8 total Corneal Fluorescein 
Staining (CFS) score between NOV03 QID and combined saline solution  groups (NOV03 
QID – combined saline solution ) = [ADDRESS_1001595]  
H11: The difference in the mean change from baseline to Week 8 total CFS score between 
NOV03 QID and combined saline solution  groups (NOV03 QID – combined saline 
solution ) ≠ 0 
and

Confidential  Page 49 of 88 
 H02: The difference in the mean change from baseline to Week 8 total CFS sco re between 
NOV03 BID and combined saline solution  groups (NOV03 BID – combined saline 
solution ) = [ADDRESS_1001596]  
H12: The difference in the mean change from baseline to Week 8 total CFS score between 
NOV03 BID and combined saline solution  groups (NOV03 BID – combined saline 
solution ) ≠ 0.  
8.3  Sample Size  
This study is expected to enroll 100 subjects in each of the four treatment arms, for a total 
of 300 randomized subjects.  
 
 this study has 8 8% power to detect a difference of 
0.[ADDRESS_1001597] at 5% level of significance. This assumes a 
standard deviation of 1.9 units for each arm.  
8.4 Statistical Analysis  
8.4.1 General Considerations  
Quantitative variables will be summarized using number of subjects (n), mean, median, 
standard deviation, minimum and maximum. The qualitative variables will be summarize d 
using counts and percentages.  
All summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_1570] , with placebo presented both pooled 
as well as separately for QID and BID dosing . Summaries will be provided for 
demographics, baseline medical history, concurrent therapie s, and subject disposition.  
For the purpose of summarization, medical history, concurrent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and AEs will be 
coded to MedDRA and WHO Drug dictionaries, as appropriate.  
Baseline measures are defined as the last non-missing measure prior to the initi ation of 
randomized study treatment . 
All primary  will be one-sided at a significance level of 0.05.  
8.4.2 Unit of Analysis  
For efficacy endpoints, the unit of analysis will be the study  eye as defined by [CONTACT_716]:  
Study Eye: Eyes are eligible for analysis if they meet all of the inclusion criteria. In the case 
that both eyes are eligible for analysis, the worst eye shall be chosen and this will be defined 
as the eye with worse (higher)  total corneal staining  at Visit 1 . If the total co rneal staining 
is the same in both eyes then the right e ye will be selected as the study eye.

 8.4.3 Missing Data  
The primary efficacy analyses will be performed using the mITT population, and using a 
repeated measures model without any imputation for missing obs ervations. Sensitivity 
analyses using different analysis populations and methods for handling missing data may 
be further detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
 
 
8.4.4 Multiplicity Consideration  
To control for inflation of type 1 error rate due to multiple  hypotheses , the analysis will be 
conducted in a hierarchical manner.  
The hypothesis testing to compare the  BID arm and control will only proceed if the QID 
vs. control comparisons are statistically significant.  
8.4.5 Primary Efficacy Analyses  
All efficacy analyses will be primarily based on the mITT . Population.  Analyses based on 
Per-Protocol (PP) population will be  supportive in nature. The primary evaluation of 
efficacy of the active arms will be against a combined control  arm (with BID and QID saline 
solution ). Analyses will also be provided comparing BID to QID saline solution  to 
determine appropriateness of comb ining for the primary analysis. Sensitivity analysis may 
be undertaken for dosing -regimen matching control  (that is, QID active vs. QID saline 
solution ). 
The primary analysis will be performed to compare the Week [ADDRESS_1001598]-squared ( LS) means will be presented from the model 
together wi th two -sided 95% confidence intervals.  
The primary analysis will use  the mITT population at the Visit 4, Week 8  visit; the PP  
population will also be used to further understand the primary results .

Analysis of Laboratory Parameters  
Clinical laboratory parameters including hematology  and serum chemistry will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_35080]. Baseline values, the values at each s ubsequent 
visit, and changes from baseline will be summarized for each of the quantitative laboratory 
assessments by [CONTACT_3148]. Shift tables of chemistry and hematology, results will be used to 
summarize changes from baseline to study termination (or early  termination). The number 
and percentage of chemistry  and hematology values outside of normal ranges and/or with 
potential clinical importance will be summarized by [CONTACT_29631].  
Other safety endpoints  including visual acuity, slit -lamp biomicroscop y, dilated 
fundoscopy, safety laboratory, and intraocular pressure  will be summarized by [CONTACT_514544]. Changes or shifts from baseline will also be 
summarized where appropriate.  For assessments performed by [CONTACT_72067], st udy eye and fellow 
eye will be summarized separately. In addition, shifts from baseline to worst on -treatment 
value for ocular safety assessments will be summarized.  
8.4.8 Pharmacokinetic Variables  
Whole b lood for perfluorohexyloctane blood  concentration measure ments will be drawn 
from a minimum of 66  subjects at one or more investigational site s with the goal of having 
samples from 20  subjects per each of the active treatment arm s. Blood concentrations of 
perfluorohexyloctane  will be summarized descriptively.  The following PK parameters will 
be estimated: AUC 0-, Cmax, tmax.  
The relationship between safety endpoints and pharmacokinetic endpoints may be explored 
to understand the impact of PK parameters on safety.  
Interim Analyses  
No interim analyses are planned for this study.

9.5.2 Accountability of Study Drug  
The study drug s are only to be prescribed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her name d sub 
investigator(s), and are only to be used in  accordance with this protocol. The study drug s 
must only be distributed to subjects properly qualified under this protocol to receive study 
drug. The investigator must keep an accurate accounting of the stu dy drug s by [CONTACT_733113] 
a detailed inventory. This includes the amount of study drug s received by [CONTACT_779], amount 
dispensed to subjects, amount returned to the site by [CONTACT_748],  and the amount returned 
to the s ponsor upon the completion of the study  
9.5.3 Return or Disposal of Study Drug  
All study drug s will be returned to the sponsor or their designee  for destruction . 
9.6 Recording of Data on Source Documents and Electronic Case 
Reports Forms ( eCRFs)  
All subjec t data will be captured in the subject  source docum ents which will be transcribed 
to the eCRFs. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that study data is completely and 
accurately recorded on each subject ’s eCRF, source documents, and all study -related 
materials. All study data should also be attribu table, legible, contemporaneous, and original. 
Recorded dat a should only be corrected in a manner that does not obliterate, destroy, or 
render illegible the previous entry ( eg, by [CONTACT_740] a single line through the incorrect entry 
and writing the revision n ext to the corrected data). An individual who has corrected a data 
entry should make clear who made the correction and when, by [CONTACT_241534]/her initials as well as the date of the correction.  
Data entry of all enrol led and randomized subje cts will use software that conforms to [ADDRESS_1001608] discs (CDs) containing c opi[INVESTIGATOR_72059] ’ eCRFs will be provided 
to each investigator site to be ma intained on file by [CONTACT_093].

 9.8 Handling of Biological Specimens  
Blood sample s will be collected for hematology  (2 mL  per draw ), serum chemistry  (5 mL  
per draw ), pharmacokinetics  (2 mL per draw ), and pregnancy test s (if applicable , taken 
from 5 mL of serum ). The approximate collection amounts per visit are described in Table 
4: 
Table 4. Blood Volumes for Safety Laboratory Tests  and Pharmacokinetics  
Approximate Blood Collection Amounts per Visit  
 Visit 0  Visit 1  Visit 4  
Hematology  2mL  N/A 2mL  
Serum Chemistry  5mL  N/A 5mL  
PK N/A 10mL  2mL  
Total  7mL  10mL 9mL 
• If blood samples are collected via an indwelling cannula, an appropriate amount 
(ie, 1 mL) of fluid slightly g reater than the dead space volume of the lock will 
be removed from the cannula and discarded before each blood sample is taken. 
After blood sample collection, the cannula will be flushed with saline or sodium 
heparin of 10 U/mL and charged with a volume eq ual to the dead space volume 
of the lock.  
• If subject  is a female of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy test will be 
taken.  
• Pharmacokinetics testing for perfluorohexyloctane  at selected sites only .  
 
Clinical laboratory tests are listed in Table 5.

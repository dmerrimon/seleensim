4 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
To evaluate the efficacy of ADX-102 ophthalmic drops  (0.5% and 0.1%) compared to 
vehicle of AD X-[ADDRESS_308613] one concentration of ADX-102 ophthalmic drops will be 
more effective than vehicle  of ADX-102 in the treatment of the  signs and symptoms of 
acute allergic conjunctivitis.  
6 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN  
This is a multi- center,  double- masked,  randomized, vehicle-controlled, phase 2b study 
evaluat ing the efficacy of ADX-102 ophthalmic drops (0.5% and 0.1%) compared to 
vehicle of ADX -[ADDRESS_308614] population that responds reproducibly to two CACs 
administered approximately 7 days apart.  Subjects who meet the entry criteria for itching 
and redness response to CAC at Visits 1 and 2 will be randomized (1:1:1) at Vi sit 3 (Day 
1, Enrollment/Randomization) to receive either  ADX-102 ophthalmic drops (0.5%), 
ADX-102 ophthalmic drops (0.1%), or v ehicle of ADX-102 ophthalmic drops bilaterally.  
Subjects will undergo the 1-hour (+5  minutes ) duration of action CAC from the time of 
their instillation. Subjects will return  approximately  14 days later for Visit 4 (Day 15± 3, 
10-Minutes Onset of Action CAC), at which time they will be treated with the same 
treatment they received at Visit 3 and challenged approximately 10 minutes after dosing .  
At Visit 4, final exit procedures will also be conducted and subjects will exit the study.   
7 STUDY POPULATION  
 NUMBER OF SUBJECTS (APPROXIMATE) 7.1
Approximately 375 subjects will be screened in order to enroll approximately 150 subjects at up to 5 sites.

and/or study related procedures), the study will be discussed with each subject, and subjects wishing to participate must give written informed  consent using an informed 
consent form (ICF) .  The ICF must be the most recent version that has received 
approval/favorable review by a properly constituted Institutional Review Board. Failure 
to obtain a signed ICF renders the subject ineligible for the study.   
Informed consent may be obtained within 30 days prior to Visit 1; however, informed 
consent must be obtained prior to Visit 1 if any of the following criteria are determined during the telephone screening process: 
• Washout of certain medications is necessary  
• Sufficient time of discontinuation of contact [CONTACT_253678]

Regulatory authorities of domestic and foreign agencies, Ora  quality assurance and/ or its 
designees , as well as the Sponsor, may carry out on -site inspections and/or audits which 
may include source data checks.  Therefore, direct access to the original source data will 
be required for inspections and/or audits.  All inspections and audits will be carried out giving consideration to data protection as well as subject confidentiality to the extent that local, state, and federal laws apply.  
[ADDRESS_308627] (IP) in humans, whether or not considered IP-related. An AE  can 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IP, without any judgment about 
causality. An AE can arise from any use of the IP (e.g., off-label use, use in combination 
with another drug or medical device) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. An AE can arise from any delivery, implantation, or use of a medical device, including medical device failure, subject  characteristics that may

Clinical Trial Protocol ADX -102-AC-[ADDRESS_308628] medical device performance ( e.g., anatomical limitations), and therapeutic 
parameters ( e.g., energy applied, sizing, dose release) associated with medical device.  
All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open question 
from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination or other diagnostic procedures will be recorded in the source document and on the appropriate pages of the e CRF. Any clinically rel evant deterioration in clinical finding is considered 
an AE and must be recorded. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as [ADDRESS_308629] age of the study.  
Ocular complaints should not be addressed as AEs unless the complaint is outside the normal limits for allergic conjunctivitis symptoms after allergen exposure or is associated with clinical sequelae (i.e., adverse slit lamp examination f inding). 
Documentation regarding the AE  should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end date, 
severity, relationship to IP, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign or 
symptom observed by [CONTACT_72078].  
 
Severity  11.1.1
Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an 
AE as determined by [CONTACT_72079]/her by [CONTACT_423].  The 
assessment of severity is made irrespective of relationshi p to IP or seriousness of the 
event and should be evaluated according to the following scale: 
•  
 
  
 
  
 
 Relationship to Investigational Product 11.1.[ADDRESS_308630] should be 
determined by [CONTACT_32981]: 
• Suspected :  A reasonable possibility exists that the investigational product caused the 
adverse event.  
• Not Suspected: A reasonable possibility does not exist that the investigational product 
caused the adverse event.  

ADX -102 Ophthalmic Drops (0.5% and 0.1%)   Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol ADX -102-AC-[ADDRESS_308631] caused the adverse event.  “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the investigational product and the adverse event.  Types of evidence that would suggest a causal relationship between the investigational product and the adverse event include:  a single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with investigational product exposure ( eg, angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson 
Syndrome); one or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with investigational product exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the investigational product ( eg, tendon rupture); an aggregate analysis of specific 
events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the investigational product-treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group. 
 
Expectedness  11.1.3
The expectedness of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety information 
about the IP using these explanations: 
• Unexpected :  an AE that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or Report of 
Prior Investigations (ROPI) or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. 
• Expected :  an AE that is listed in the IB or ROPI [INVESTIGATOR_253675]. 
• Not applicable:  an AE unrelated to the IP. 
AEs that are mentioned in the IB or ROPI [INVESTIGATOR_88081] a class of products or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological/ mechanical (or other) properties of the product, but are not specifical ly mentioned as occurring with the particular product under 
investigation are to be considered unexpected. 
The investigator should initially classify the expectedness of an AE , but the final 
classification is subject to the Medical Monitor  and the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor ’s 
determination.  
 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 11.2
An AE  is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor /designee, 
it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death;  
• A life -threatening AE; 
ADX -102 Ophthalmic Drops (0.5% and 0.1%)   Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc.

Confidential  Page 33 of 56 Note:  An AE  is considered “lif e-threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or Sponsor /designee , its occurrence places the subject at immediate 
risk of death.  It does not include an AE  that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death. 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
Note:  The term “inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any inpatient admission (even 
if less than 24 hours).  For chronic or long- term inpatients, inpatient admission 
includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care inpatient unit.  Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80676]:  emergency room visits; outpatient/same -day/ambulatory procedures; observation/short stay units; 
rehabilitation facilities; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593]; nursing homes; or clinical research/phase 1 units. 
Note:  The term “prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any extension 
of an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_253676] r or treating 
physician.  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions; 
Note:  A serious adverse event (SAE) specifically related to visual threat would 
be interpreted as any potential impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes (e.g.,

 PROCEDURES FOR UNMASKING (IF APPLICABLE) 11.[ADDRESS_308634]’s emergency situation and the need to unmask a study subject prior to unmasking IP.   
If the investigator determines that emergency unmasking is necessary, the investigator 
should identify the given subject’s study drug kit which contains a scratch off laminate under which the treatment is identified along with the associated lot number. In order to unmask, the investigator should scratch off the laminate, using a flat object and applying pressure, to reveal the treatment assigned for that subject . The emergency unmasking 
should be performed by [CONTACT_253681].  The investigator must also 
indicate in so urce documents and in the eCRF that the mask was broken and provide the 
date, time, and reason for breaking the mask.  Any AE or SAE associated with breaking the mask must be recorded and reported as specified in this protocol.

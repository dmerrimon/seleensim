 1. INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1. Background  
Head and neck cancer comprises approximately 2 -3% of all malignancies and account for about 
2-3% of all cancer -related deaths  (1). Ninety -five percent of all head and neck cancers are 
squamous cell carcinomas.  Head and neck cancers (except for nasopharyngeal carcinoma) have 
traditionally been grouped together, based on common etiology, predisposing factors, histology, 
approaches to treatment  (2).  Only 10% of patients present with distant metastases ( 3).  However, 
in the course of their illness, about half of head and neck patients present with or develop 
recurrent or metastatic disease ( 5). Prognosis in such patients is poor (7). The role of 
chemotherapy in this setting is palliative.  Survival in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck cancer (R/M SCCHN) is 6 -9 months, even with 
aggressive therapy  (8). Cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil have traditionally been the combination of 
choice in the treatment of incurable disease (2).  Si ngle agents, such as methotrexate, can be used 
as well. Response rates to chemotherapy are low, between 10 -30% for single -agent regimens and 
20-40% for multi- drug regimens  (9, 10) . However, the more efficacious regimens and 
combinations are fraught with toxicities and side effects that impair quality of life of the patients  
(9).  Currently, targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_325229] a variety of cancers, with good clinical 
activity. They have been administered in patients with R/M SCCHN with promising results ( 4, 9, 
11). Since vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis and 
metastasis of R/M SCCHN, this protocol aims to investigate clinical activity of Axitinib in this cancer type.  
  
1.1.1. Molecular Formula and Molecular Activity  
 
Axitinib is a substituted indazole derivative that was discovered using structure -based drug  
design. The molecular formula is C22H18N4OS with molecular weight of 386.47. The chemical name [CONTACT_832] N -Methyl -2-[3-((E)-2- pyridin -2-yl-vinyl) -1H-indazol-6- ylsulfanyl] -benzamide:

Wilmes et al. ( 12) showed by [CONTACT_325251]-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) 
that tumors formed in immune -deficient mice from breast cancer cells had decreased blood 
flow/permeability in Axitinib -treated animals. Animal x enogaft models also demonstrated  that 
Axitinib inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth of colon cancer culture cells in host animals 
(13).  
 
1.1.2. Clinical activity of Axitinib 
 
Axitinib is a substituted indazole derivative that acts as a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. It is a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGF receptors 1, 2, and 3, platelet -derived growth factor 
(PDGF ) receptor beta and c- kit (13, 14). It has been evaluated in metastatic settings in a variety 
of cancers.  
 Axitinib is FDA approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma after failure of one prior systemic therapy.  
 Axitinib has been most extensively studied in renal cell carcinoma. Rixe et al. reported on efficacy of axitinib in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who failed prior cytokine treatment ( 15). In this study, single- agent axitinib yielded objective response rate (ORR) of 
44.2%, with median duration of response of 23 months. Axitinib was also active in patients with RCC who previously progressed on sorafenib (16). In this population, Axitinib gave ORR of 22.6%, with median duration of response of 17.5 months. Median PFS was 7.4 months. A recently reported phase III trial compared Axitinib with sorafenib in patients with metastatic RCC is second -line setting ( 17). Median PFS was significantly longer with the former (6.7 
months vs. 4.7 months, HR of 0.665, P<0.0001). ORR was 19.4% for axitinib and 9.4% for 
sorafenib (P=0.0001).

Axitinib has shown clinical activity in various histologic subtypes of advanced thyroid cancer, with objective response rate of 30% and stable disease in an additional 38% (18), with resultant disease control rate of 68%. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 18.1 months.    Schiller et al. ( 19) reported on efficacy of axitinib in patients with advanced non- small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC), mostly  adenocarcinoma (75%), most were pretreated (72%). Partial response 
(PR) was observed in 9% of patients, disease control rate was 41%. Median PFS was 4.9 months.  Axitinib was also studied in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer in combination with gemcitabine ( 20, 21). An initial, phase II trial offered a promising result of improved overall 
survival (OS) with axitinib plus gemcitabine vs. gemcitabine alone (6.9 months vs. 5.6 months, which was not statistically significant, however). However, a subsequent phase III trial did not show any survival advantage to the combination ( 21).  
 In all of these studies, the starting dose of Axitinib was 5 mg twice a day ( BID). In most studies, 
Axitinib  dose was titrated up from a starting dose of 5 mg BID in 1 – 3 mg increments in patients 
tolerating A xitinib . Those subjects who could tolerate A xitinib  with no adverse events related to 
Axitinib  above Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  Grade 2 for 
consecutive 2 week periods were permitted to incr ease their dose step -wise to 7 mg BID and then 
to 10 mg BID, unless their BP was >150/[ADDRESS_401613] previously 
tolerated 5 mg  BID starting dose. 
 Growth factors such as VEGF and epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169] (EGF) have been implicated in the growth of cancer cells in head and neck cancer (reviewed in ref 22, 23, 24). Therefore, a phase [ADDRESS_401614] predictive markers of response to targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_325230].  
 
1.1.3. Overall clinical safety. 
 
Overall, the adverse events reported in Axitinib clinical studies are considered manageable, 
generally reversible and expected for this class of agents . A [COMPANY_007], Inc.  summary of observed 
Axitinib toxicity gathered on 515 subjects treated with single -agent Axitinib  is listed below

1.2. Rationale for Trial  
 
Based off the known translational data and targeted mechanism of Axitinib, UMCC 2011.53 ‘A Phase II Trial Evaluating Axitinib in Patients with Unresectable, Recurrent, or Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer’ accrued patients  between 2012-2014. This study included patients with 
unresectable recurrent or distant metastatic (R/M HNSCC) at any line of therapy as long as their ECOG performance status was 0-2.  It was powered with the primary objective of detecting an improvement in 6-month progression free survival.  Of particular note, tumor response was judged by [CONTACT_393] v1.0 with planned treatment cessation if radiologic progression was noted.  Forty -two patients were enrolled and available for safety analysis of which only 30 were 
available for efficacy.  We noted that many patients  in this cohort had significant clinical 
improvement as witnessed by [CONTACT_325252], improved energy, and increased performance status.  However, interval imaging of patients demonstrated  evidence of 
mild/moderate tumor swelling with cystic attenuation and edema suggestive of drug effect. In some of the patients, this likely treatment response was interpreted as progression per RECIST v1.0.  Planned interim analyses were conducted as to investigate efficacy as based on 6 month progression free survival (PFS).  The first a priori interim analysis was performed after enrollment of 20 patients and marginal benefit was seen hence a second interim analysis was performed after enrollment of 30 patients evaluable for efficacy.  Using the endpoint of 6 month PFS, the study was stopped due to futility as the observed rate for patients on axitinib was 27%.

Final results of this trial were recently published ( 55).  Although the trial was considered 
negativ e on grounds of lack in improvement of PFS compared to historical controls (3.7 months 
(95% CI 3.5-5.7), observed responses and survival data suggested significant efficacy in a heavily pre-treated population (disease control rate (DCR) of 76.7%, median OS of 10.9 months (95% CI 6.4-17.8)) (Table 8, Figure 3, Figure 4) . In addition, Axitinib was extremely well 
tolerated with no bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_325231].  Table 4: UMCC 2011.[ADDRESS_401618] v1.0  Choi Criteria

We strongly believe that Axitinib is a promising therapeutic, merits further consideration as a novel therapeutic in R/M HNSCC, and that the results of the UMCC 2011.[ADDRESS_401619], we note the impressive overall survival (median 10.9 months) observed in the heavily pretreated UMCC 2011.[ADDRESS_401620] line therapy in newly diagnosed R/M HNSCC is a triplet therapy (the ‘EXTREME’ regimen) consisting of Cetuximab, Cisplatin, and 5-flurouracil which has been shown to be associated with a median OS of 10.1 months with relatively high rate of grade 3 or 4 toxicities(82%) (9).  In studies of patients failing first line therapy, median overall survival (OS) is typi[INVESTIGATOR_325232] 4-8 months.  Ninety percent of the patients in our study had previous lines of therapy in the R/M setting suggestive of significant survival benefit with Axitinib therapy.  
 We believe that the reason UMCC 2011.53 demonstrated impressive OS but did not demonstrate improvement in PFS (and hence was stopped for futility) is that tumor response to therapy (swelling, cystic attenuation) was registered as progression by [CONTACT_393] v1.0.  Similar results regarding responses have been described with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, most notably in advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs).  To account for these alternate radiologic changes, an alternate set of response criteria have been proposed for patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors known as the Choi Criteria (Table 9). In one study, it was demonstrated that radiologic changes defined by [CONTACT_325253] (PFS, DSS, OS) whereas RECIST did not capture these correlations.  Table 5: Definition of Choi Criteria  
Axitinib  In Head And Neck Cancer  --  Protocol For A Phase II Study  
 
[ADDRESS_401621] reviewed all the radiographic images for all of the patients on UMCC 2011.53 by [CONTACT_325254] a hyp othesis generating exploratory analysis.  Of note, only 29/30 patients evaluable 
for response had imaging for which the Choi Criteria could be applied.  In addition, imaging was not optimized for interpreting images with alternate radiologic criteria .  Pre liminary exploratory 
analyses demonstrate that (23/29) 65% of patients enrolled on UMCC 2011.53 had a response (PR) by [CONTACT_325255] 2 patients achieving stable disease (6.9%) (Table 4).  
 Furthermore, overall survival was found to be significantly improved in patients with a response by [CONTACT_325256]-responders (KM estimate of OS (95% CI): 13.2(10.3,18.7) months versus 5.1 (2.5, 8.8) months) (Figure 5 ).  Further analyses was limited as treatment decisions 
were made off of RECI ST but predicted survival at 12 months was 63% (95% CI: 38- 80%) in 
patients with a response versus 20% (95% CI: 3-47%) in non-responders.  Figure 4: Kaplan -Meier Analysis of Overall Survival by [CONTACT_325257] 2011.53 

Axitinib  In Head And Neck Cancer  --  Protocol For A Phase II Study

Given the existing literature in other malignancies treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 
mechanism of action of Axitinib, and our exploratory analysis in evaluating response with alternate criteria we feel that use of Choi Criteria for assessment for tumor response and treatment decisions is more appropriate for ongoing R/M HNSCC trials.  We believe that improvements in survival endpoints (ie PFS) may be underestimated in the existing UMCC 2011.[ADDRESS_401622] progression despi[INVESTIGATOR_325233]. 
 Therefore, we propose a trial examining the use of Axitinib in R/M HNSCC  using the Choi 
Criteria for response assessment .  We would power this cohort to detect a 20% improvement in 6 
month overall survival compared to historical data (from 50% to 70% at 6 months).  This cohort would consist of 37 patients and treatment plan would be identical to the previous UMCC 2011.53 protocol with the exception that Choi criteria would be used to evaluate response.  In addition, treatment with Axitinib would be continued if patients were felt to be deriving clinical benefit.  
 
2. HYPOTHESIS:

3. OBJECTIVES:  
 
3.1 Primary objective 
 
To determine the 6 month overall survival in patients with unresectable recurrent and 
metastatic head and neck cancer treated with Axitinib  
 
3.2 Secondary objectives  
 
1. To determine the overall survival of patients treated with Axitinib  
2. To determine the progression free survival of patients treated with Axitinib  
3. To determine the disease control rate at 16 weeks  and response rate as defined by 
[CONTACT_325258]  
4. To determine the duration of response (as defined by [CONTACT_325258]) of patients treated 
with Axitinib  
5. To assess the toxicities associated  with the treatment of Axitinib of patients treated 
with Axitinib  
 
4. STUD Y DESIGN:  
 
This study will be  a prospective, single- institution, single -arm phase II study of Axitinib in 
patients with unresectable recurrent and metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with ECOG performance status 0-2, for recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer. The subjects will be started on treatment with 5 mg of Axitinib twice a day continuously, with subsequent dose escalation to 7 mg and then 10 mg twice a day in the absence of grade 2 or worse toxicities. This will be followed by [CONTACT_284747]/or radiologic response assessment after 8 weeks and subsequently every 2 months until disease progression (defined per Choi criteria, or obvious progression on clinical or laryngoscopic/endoscopic exam) or intolerable toxicity (defined as below).  Patients with confirmed progressive disease who, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continue to receive benefit from Axitinib treatment and who meet the criteria for treatment may continue to receive treatment as described in Section 8.3.  Axitinib should be discontinued if there is further evidence of progression defined as an additional 10% or greater increase in tumor burden volume from time of initial progression (including all target lesions and new measurable lesions).  During treatment on this protocol , all patients will be evaluated for safety as detailed below.

  7.  STUDY PLAN  
 7.1. Study overview 
 
The patients will receive 5 mg Axitinib twice a day. Dose escalation is planned at 2 weeks (to 7 mg BID) and at 3 weeks (to 10 mg BID), in the absence of toxicities grade [ADDRESS_401632] diminished to grade 1 or less (see 
Axitinib  In Head And Neck Cancer  --  Protocol For A Phase II Study  
 
20 
 below) since last follow -up. Each patient will be seen in clinic at 2, 4, [ADDRESS_401633] be ma de by a study staff member (licensed RN or MD) at [ADDRESS_401634] diminished to grade 1 or less (see below), and measures have been taken to reasonably prevent recurrence of these toxicities with the higher dose since last follow -up.  
 The response to treatment will be assessed clinically at each visit, as well as by [CONTACT_325264], starting at 8 weeks  +/- 2 weeks  and then at 8 -week intervals, +/ - 2 weeks.  
Tumor response to therapy will be interpreted by [CONTACT_325265]. Patients will be taken off trial for significant side effects, per patient pref erence, or for noncompliance with treatment plan.  Beyond progression, 
survival will be assessed every 12 weeks. Patients will also be followed for 28 days after cessation of study participation for safety monitoring. Patients with confirmed progressive disease who, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continue to receive benefit from Axitinib treatment and who meet the criteria for treatment may continue to receive treatment as described in Section 8.3.  Axitinib should be discontinued if there is further evidence of progression defined as an additional 10% or greater increase in tumor burden volume from time of initial progression (including all target lesions and new measurable lesions).

 8. TREATMENT PLAN:  
 
 8.1. Allocation to Treatment  
 
This trial is open label. All subjects will receive Axitinib. The starting dose of Axitinib will be 5 
mg orally twice daily. The dose will be escalated to 10 mg orally BID (see below) or modified as needed for toxicities (see below).  
 
8.2. D rug Supplies  
 
This trial will utilize the commercially available, marketed Axitinib. [COMPANY_007], Inc. will provide the 
medication free of charge.  
 
8.2.1. Formulation and Packaging 
 
Axitinib will be supplied as 1 -mg and 5- mg film coated tablets for oral administration (Table 7). 
The appropriate dose may be achieved by [CONTACT_325266], and pi[INVESTIGATOR_325234]. Every effort will be made to simplify dosage (decrease the number of tablets, and limit to a single kind of tablets, 
either 1 -mg or 5 -mg) once stable dose is achieved. The tablets may not be split in order to 
achieve the desired dose. At each visit, patient will be asked how many doses were missed and when. This information will be recorded in the patient study record. Please see “ Patient Follow -
up Form”.  
 
 
8.2.2. Administration 
 
Axitinib will be administered orally at 5 mg twice a day (morning and evening), starting on Day [ADDRESS_401636] not “make it up” with an extra dose, but instead resume su bsequent doses as prescribed. On day of visit patient may hold their morning 
dose until assessed by [CONTACT_6903].  Missed doses may be taken late, up to 3 hours before the next 
scheduled dose, otherwise should be skipped.   The patients will be asked to bring medication bottles to each follow -up visit, and remaining pi[INVESTIGATOR_325235]. This information will be recorded in each patient’s data file.

Patients experiencing d rug reaction greater than CTCAE Grade 2 should undergo dose 
modification as recommended in section 8.2.4.   
8.2.3. Dose escalations 
 
Dose escalation is planned at 2 weeks (to 7 mg BID) and at 3 weeks (to 10 mg BID), in the 
absence of toxicities grade [ADDRESS_401637] be made by a study staff member (a doctor or a nurse) at 1 and 3 weeks, +/ - [ADDRESS_401638] diminished to grade 1 or less (see below), 
and measures have been taken to reasonably prevent recurrence of these toxicities with the higher dose. The contents of each planned and patient- initiated phone called will be recorde d in 
patient’s study record.   If a patient has a dose reduction for study drug related toxicity, the dose may be considered for re-escalation in patients who tolerate the lower dose without toxicities above Grade [ADDRESS_401639] been taken to reasonably prevent recurrence of these toxicities with the higher dose.   
8.2.4. Dose Interruption and Reductions 
Adverse events and other symptoms will be graded according to the current Common 
Terminology for Adverse Events version 4.03 (CTCAE v4.03). This section contains management of adverse events except hypertension, hemoptysis and proteinuria which are discussed in subsequent sections.  Patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a treatment -related CTCAE Grade [ADDRESS_401640] dose reductions as described below.  
 
Axitinib  In Head And Neck Cancer  --  Protocol For A Phase II Study  
 
24 
 Treatment delays due to drug- related toxicity > 2 weeks will result in discontinuation of 
treatment.  Pat ients removed from treatment for intolerable toxicity will still be followed for 
survival. 
The criteria for dose modification for study drug related adverse events is summarized Table 8 below.  Table 8. Criteria for Dose Modification for Axitinib Related A dverse Events other than

[IP_ADDRESS]. Axitinib Dose Reduction for Hypertension  
 
Patients treated with Axitinib will monitored for hypertension closely in the office. Blood 
pressure will be monitored closely at routine visits.   If hypertension is noted at the time of the 
initial encounter, it will be checked  5 minutes after sitting quietly.  
  Guidance on dose interruption and reduction for hypertension is summarized in Table 9 below. If 
“white coat hypertension” is suspected by [CONTACT_325267] -hypertensive regimen and dose 
of Axitinib can be continued.
Table 9. Hypertension Management Plan for Axitinib

Hypertensive urgency or emergency while on study drug, 
with any blood pressure level above 140/90      
Management
If not on maximal antihypertensive treatment, institute new or 
additional antihypertensive medication and maintain dose of study drug. If on maximal antihypertensive treatment (3 
agents including a diuretic, and no further safe and efficacious escalation of antihypertensive therapy is deemed possible by [CONTACT_473]) , reduce study drug to one lower dose level.
Interrupt dosing; adjust antihypertensive medication; as soon as BP is 140/90  mm Hg or less, restart study drug at one lower dose level.
Repeat study drug dose reduction by [CONTACT_325268]. If a 
patient requires dose reduction below 2 mg BID, take off study.
Take patient off study immediately. Manage as medically 
appropriate, in the appropriate hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885].
 
If study drug is held, patients receiving antihypertensive medications should monitor closely for 
hypotension.  Plasma half- life of Axitinib is 2 – 4 hours and BP usually decreases within 1-2 
days fol lowing dose interruption. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Axitinib Dose Reduction for Hemoptysis 
 
Bleeding from the lungs as evidenced by [CONTACT_325269] v4.03.  Treatment with Axitinib will be discontinued f or hemoptysis of >½ tsp of bright red blood 
per day. In addition, a radiologic assessment (e.g., chest x-ray) should be considered for patients who have hemoptysis >½ tsp of bright red blood per day. If the hemoptysis resolves to baseline within 1 week and there is no evidence of disease cavitation, treatment with Axitinib may  
continue at the current dose level. Patients who experience hemoptysis without resolution to 
Axitinib  In Head And Neck Cancer  --  Protocol For A Phase II Study  
 
26 
 baseline within 1 week, or with evidence of disease cavitation should discontinue from tre atment  
with Axitinib.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Axitinib Dose Reduction for Proteinuria 
 
At documentation of >1+ proteinuria by [CONTACT_5230], patients should have a 24-hour urine collection 
for total protein. Axitinib dosing may continue while waiting for test results.  
 If ≤2  g proteinuria/24 hours is reported, treatment with Axitinib may continue without dose 
reduction.  If >2 g proteinuria/24 hours is reported, treatment with Axitinib should be interrupted. A twenty -four hour urine collection for total protein and creatinine clearance should be performed  
weekly until results show ≤2 g proteinuria/[ADDRESS_401643] every -2-weeks monitoring for proteinuria by [CONTACT_325270] (e.g.,  dipstick) as long as 
the proteinuria reading is  higher than 1+. The 24-hour urine collection to monitor the degree of proteinuria should be repeated every 4 weeks until it has decreased to <500 mg/24 hours. If recurrent >2 g proteinuria/24 hours is reported, treatment with Axitinib should be interrupted again. Twenty-four hour urine collection for total protein and creatinine clearance should be performed eve ry 2 weeks until results show ≤2 g proteinuria/24 hours, at which time  
treatment with Axitinib may be restarted at one lower dose level. If a patient requires dose  
reduction below 2 mg BID, stop trial participation.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Axitinib Dose Interruption for Surgery or Surgical Procedures  
 
If surgery  is required, treatment with Axitinib must be interrupted at least 24 hours before the 
procedure and the patient’s blood pressure should be monitored closely for hypotension. Patients 
may resume Axitinib seven days after minor surgery and 2- 3 weeks after major surgery, 
assuming wound has completely healed and no wound healing complications, at the discretion of the prescribing physician.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Thyroid Function Tests 
 
Patients receiving Axitinib should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, such 
as fatigue, deepening of voice, cold intolerance, constipation, anorexia, periorbital edema, myxedema, or changes in skin or hair. Hypothyroidism should be treated per standard medical practice to maintai n euthyroid state. Dose reduction or interruption should not be made for 
thyroid abnormalities alone.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_401644] been proposed for evaluating response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, these response criteria 
Axitinib  In Head And Neck Cancer  --  Protocol For A Phase II Study  
 
27 
 likely still do not fully capture patients who may derive clinical benefit despi[INVESTIGATOR_325236]. 
 Subjects will be permitted to continue on Axitinib treatment beyond initial Choi defined PD as long as they meet the following criteria:  
 
- Investigator-assessed clinical benefit and do not have rapid disease progression 
- Tolerance of study drug 
- Stable performance status  
- Treatment beyond progression will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent serious complications of disease progression (i.e. CNS metastases)  
- Subject provides written informed consent prior to receiving any additional Axitinib treatment, using an informed consent describing any reasonably foreseeable risk or discomforts, or other alternative treatment options. 
 The assessment of clinical benefit should take into account whether the subject is clinically deteriorating and unlikely to receive further benefit from continued treatment.  All decisions to continue treatment beyond initial progression must be documented in the study records. Subjects will be re-consented with an informed consent describing any r easonably 
foreseeable risks or discomforts.  
 Subjects should discontinue study therapy upon further evidence of further progression, defined as an additional 10% or greater increase in tumor burden volume from time of initial progression (including all tar get lesions and new measurable lesions).  
 New lesions are considered measurable at the time of initial progression if the longest diameter is at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes, which must have a short axis of at least 15 mm). Any new lesion considered non- measurable at the time of initial progression may become 
measurable and therefore included in the tumor burden measurement if the longest diameter increases to at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes, which must have an increa se 
in short axis to at least 15 mm).  
 For statistical analysis that include the investigator -assessed progression date, subjects who 
continue treatment beyond investigator-assessed, Choi Response defined progression w ill be 
considered to have investigator- assessed progressive disease at the time of the initial progression 
event.  
 
8.4. Drug Storage and Drug Accountability 
 
A co -investigator or an approved representative (e.g., research pharmacists ) will ensure that all 
trial drugs are stored in a secure area, under recommended storage conditions and in accordance 
with applicable regulatory requirements.   The research pharmacy will assist with management of drug storage and accountability. Drug accountability forms will be used to maintain accurate records of  receipt, dispensing and return 
Axitinib  In Head And Neck Cancer  --  Protocol For A Phase II Study  
 
28 
 of trial medication. Any drug that is not dispensed at the end of the trial or any returned drug 
supplies should be returned to [COMPANY_007] Inc., or disposed of in accordance with instructions received in writing from [COMPANY_007], Inc . 
 
8.5. Concomitant Medication(s) 
 
In vitro studies with human liver microenzymes and recombinant CYP450 enzymes indicated 
that Axitinib metabolism was primarily mediated by [CONTACT_33641] -metabolizing enzyme CYP3A, 
and to a lesser extent by [CONTACT_097]1A2. Additionally, the drug also undergoes N-glucuronidation in liver microsomes of some species. Clinically, there is likelihood that Axitinib plasma  
concentrations may be increased in the presence of co -administered potent inhibitors of the 
CYP3A and glucuronosyl transfe rase enzymes. The potential exists for drug -drug interactions 
with strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors and inducers.   Axitinib metabolism may be induced in patients taking strong CYP3A4 /5 inducers and inhibitors 
as these may alter  Axitinib plasma concentrations. 
 The following potent CYP3A4/5  strong inhibitors and CYP3A4/5 strong inducers are prohibited: 
 
CYP3A4 /5 INHIBITORS ( Strong) CYP3A4/ 5 INDUCERS  (Strong) 
Atazanavir  
Boceprevir  
Coniveptan Clarithromycin  
Grapefruit and grapefruit juice Indinavir Itraconazole Ketoconazole 
Nefazodone Nelfinavir  
Posaconazole   Carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_325237]. John’s Wort  
Ritonavir  
Saquinavir Telaprevir  
Telithromycin  
Voriconazole    
  Other CYP3A4 /5 inhibitors and inducers are allowed per investigator’s discretion.  
 Since CYP1A2 is also known to be induced in chronic smokers, there is likelihood that Axitinib plasma concentrations may be reduced in these individuals.  Based on preclinical and extensive clinical experi ence, clinically significant drug interactions are unlikely.  
Axitinib  In Head And Neck Cancer  --  Protocol For A Phase II Study  
 
[ADDRESS_401645] supportive measures should be used in the case of excessive pharmacological effects or advers e reaction.  
 
9.  RESPONSE CRITERIA 
  
The Choi Criteria will be used to assess tumor response to therapy.  Interpretation will be performed by [CONTACT_325262] (TRAC). If density measurements are not available and cannot b e accurately measured by [CONTACT_325271], 
response can be dictated by [CONTACT_325272] (i.e.f or cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas that 
are not visualized on CT scan but are measurable on physical exam only). Non-target lesions are 
also permissi ble in which  case o verall assessment would be limited  to complete response, stable 
disease, and progressive disease.  Complete Response: 
- Disappearance of all lesions

10. CRITERIA FOR DISCONTINUATION OF TREATMENT  
 
1. Unacceptable toxicity.  
2. Intercurrent illness, which prevents further administration of treatment. 3. Patient preference.  
4. Confirmed PD and Investigator determination that the patient is no longer benefiting from treatment with Axitinib  (per section 8.3) 
5. Treatment delays due to drug- related toxicity  > 2 weeks.  
6. Non- compliance with treatment.  
Axitinib  In Head And Neck Cancer  --  Protocol For A Phase II Study  
 
30 
 7. If the disease becomes amenable to resection or (chemo)  radiation with curative intent as  a 
result of Axitinib treatment, Axitinib will be stopped, and the alternative treatment instituted that 
would offer the best chance of cure for the patient. Such patients will be included in safety and efficacy analysis.  
  
11. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
 
The safety of Axitinib should be evaluated using the standard clinical practice, with special 
attention paid to hypertension, proteinuria, thrombosis, hemoptysis, bleeding risk, and concomitant medications. Patients receiving Axitinib should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue, deepening of voice, cold intolerance, constipation, anorexia, periorbital edema, myxedema, or changes in skin or hair. Hypothyroidism should be treated per standard medical practice to maintain euthyroid state.  
  12. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 12.1. Adverse Events  
All observed or volunteered adverse events regardless of suspected causal relationship to 
Axitinib will be reported as described in the following  sections. 
 For all adverse events the investigator m ust pursue and obtain information adequate both to 
determine the outcome of the adverse event and to assess whether it meets the criteria for  
classification as a serious adverse event requiring immediate notification to [COMPANY_007], Inc.  or its 
designated representative. For all adverse events sufficient information should be obtained by [CONTACT_325274]. The investigator is required to assess causality. For adverse events with a causal relationship to Axitinib, follow -up by [CONTACT_325275] a level acceptable to the investigator, and [COMPANY_007], Inc.  concurs with that assessment.  
 
12.2. Reporting Period 
 
Adverse events reporting, including suspected, unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be  
carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations. For serious adverse events, the 
reporting period to [COMPANY_007], Inc.  or its designated representative begins from the time that the 
subject  has taken at l east one dose of trial treatment through the last subject visit. Any serious 
adverse event occurring any time after the reporting period must be promptly reported if a causal relationship to Axitinib is suspected.  
 Adverse events should be recorded on the CRF from the time the subject has taken at least one  
dose of trial treatment through last subject visit.  
 If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the adverse event reporting period for non-serious adverse events ends at the time the new treatment is started. Death must be reported if it occurs 
Axitinib  In Head And Neck Cancer  --  Protocol For A Phase II Study  
 
[ADDRESS_401646] or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal  
relationship with the treatment or usage. Examples of adverse events include but are not limited to:  - Abnormal test findings; - Clinically significant symptoms and signs; - Changes in physical examination findings; - Hypersensitivity.  
Additionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from exposure in Utero.  Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under trial should be reported as adverse events in the appropriate section of the CRF . Disease progression assessed by [CONTACT_28131].  
12.4. Abnormal Test Findings  
 
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an 
adverse event are as follows:  
- Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or  
- Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; and/or  
- Test result leads to a change in trial dosing outside of protocol- stipulated dose  
adjustments or discontinuation from the trial, significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy; and/or - Test resu lt is considered to be an adverse event by [CONTACT_325276], in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an adverse event. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an adverse event.  
 
12.5. Serious Adverse Events 
 
A serious adverse event or serious adverse drug reaction is any untoward medical occurrence at  
any dose that:  
- Results in death; 
- Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);  
- Requires inpa tient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
- Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
- Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 Progression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of progression) should not be reported as serious adverse events unless the outcome is fatal during the trial or within the safety reporting period. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_325238]  --  Protocol For A Phase II Study  
 
[ADDRESS_401647] be recorded as an adverse event and as a serious adverse event with CTC grade 5 (See  
Severity  Assessment). Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in determining 
whether an event is an important medical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life -threatening and/or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. However, if it is 
determined that the event may  jeopardize the subject and may require intervention to prevent one 
of the other outcomes, the important medical event should be reported as serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic  
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
12.6. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_325239] n are considered serious. Any initial admission (even if less than 24 hours) to a 
healthcare facility meets these criteria. Admission also includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_325240]/intensive care unit (e.g., from the psychiatric wing to a medical f loor, medical floor to a 
coronary care unit, neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]: - Rehabilitation facilities; - Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593]; - Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] (e.g., caregiver relief);  
- Skilled nursing facilitie s; 
- Nursing homes; - Routine emergency room admissions; - Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures).  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4595] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], clinical  
adverse event is not in itself a s erious adverse event. Examples include: 
- Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the development of a new adverse event or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (e.g., for work-up of persistent pre- treatment lab abnormality);  
- Social admission (e.g., subject has no place to sleep); - Administrative admission (e.g., for yearly physical exam); - Protocol-specified admission during a clinical trial (e.g., for a procedure required by [CONTACT_47519]); - Optional admis sion not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_10244] (e.g., for 
elective cosmetic surgery);  
- Pre -planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject; - Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products.  Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not be reported as adverse events. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported and it meets the definition of an adverse event. For example, an 
Axitinib  In Head And Neck Cancer  --  Protocol For A Phase II Study  
 
33 
 acute appendicitis that begins during the adverse event reporting period should be reported as the 
adverse event, and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as t reatment of the adverse  
event.  
  
12.7. Severity Assessment 
 
If required on the adverse event case report forms, the investigator will use the following 
definitions of severity in accordance with National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adv erse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.[ADDRESS_401648] be consistent with the description of CTCAE grade included in the narrative section of the serious adverse event report.  
  
GRADE  Clinical Description of Severity  
   0   no change from normal or reference range  
   1   mild adverse event  
   2     moderate adverse event  
   3   severe adverse event  
   4   life-threatening or disabling adverse event  
   5   death related to adverse event  
 
Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an adverse event. A severe event is not necessarily a serious event. For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly with subject' s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met 
one of the criteria for serious adverse events, listed above.   
12.8. Causality Assessment 
 
The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all adverse events (serious and non-serious), the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements if  
applicable. An investigator’s causality assessment is the deter mination of whether there exists a  
reasonable possibility that Axitinib caused or contributed to an adverse event. If the investigator does not know whether or not Axitinib caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational pro duct” for reporting purposes, as defined by [CONTACT_4618], Inc.  (See Section 
on Reporting Requirements). If the investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related to investigational product,” this should be clearly documented on trial records.  In ad dition, if the investigator determines a serious adverse event is associated with trial 
procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse event  
reporting requirements, if applicable.  
12.9. Exposure In Utero 
Axitinib  In Head And Neck Cancer  --  Protocol For A Phase II Study  
 
34 
  
An Exposure In Utero (EIU) occurs if: 
 1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been directly exposed to (e.g., environmental exposure) Axitinib, or the female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant after discontinuing and/or being directly exposed to Axitinib (maternal exposure);  
 2. A male has been exposed, either due to treatment or environmental, to Axitinib prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during the partner pregnancy (paternal exposure).  If any study subject or study subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the study subject’s treatment with Axitinib, the investigator must submit this information to [COMPANY_007], Inc. on an Exposure in Utero Form. In addition, the investigator must submit information 
regarding environmental exposure to [COMPANY_007], Inc.  product in a pregnant woman (e.g., a nurse 
reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by [CONTACT_4691][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using the Exposure in Utero Form. This must be done irrespective of whether an adverse event has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to induced termination of pregnancy).  Follow-Up is conducted to obtain pregnancy outcome information on all Exposure in Utero reports with an unknown outcome. The investigator will follow the pr egnancy until completion  
or until pregnancy termination (ie, induced abortion) and then notify [COMPANY_007], Inc.  of the outcome. 
The investigator will provide this information as a follow up to the initial Exposure in Utero 
Form.  The reason(s) for an induced abortion should be specified. An EIU report is not created 
when an  ectopic pregnancy report is received since this pregnancy is not usually viable. Rather, a 
serious adverse event case is created with the event of ectopic pregnancy.  
 If the outcome of the pr egnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a serious  
adverse event (ie, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [including that in an aborted fetus, stillbirth or neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting serious adverse events.  In the case of a live birth, the “normality” of the newborn can be assessed at the time of birth (ie, no minimum follow -up period of a presumably normal infant is required before an Exposure 
in Uter o Form can be completed). The “normality” of an aborted fetus can be assessed by [CONTACT_325277], unless pre-abortion test findings are suggestive of a congenital anomaly.  Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are classified as serious adverse events follows: - “Spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage and missed abortion. - All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_401649] to causality, as serious adverse events. In addition, any infant death after 1 month that the investigator assesses as possibly related to the in utero exposure to Axitinib should be reported. 
Axitinib  In Head And Neck Cancer  --  Protocol For A Phase II Study  
 
35 
  
Additional information regarding the Exposure in Utero may be requested by [CONTACT_093]. Further follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (e.g., follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator must obtain permission from the subject’s partner in order to conduct any follow-up or collect any information.  
 
12.10. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events  
 
Withdrawal due to adverse event should be distinguished from withdrawal due to insufficient response, according to the definition of adverse event noted earlier, and recorded on the appropriate adverse event CRF page.  
 When a subject withdraws due to a serious adverse event, the serious adverse event must be reported in accordance with the reporting requirements defined below.  
12.11. Eliciting Adverse Event Information 
 
The investigator is to repor t all directly observed adverse events and all adverse events  
spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_167334]. In addition, each trial subject will be questioned 
about adverse events.  
Axitinib  In Head And Neck Cancer  --  Protocol For A Phase II Study  
 
36 
 12.12. Reporting Requirements 
 
Each adverse event is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for serious adverse event. If a serious adverse event occurs, it will be reported via submission of [COMPANY_007], Inc. Investigator-Initiated Research Serious Adverse Event (IIR SAE) form, according to guidelines provided in  Pfiz er, Inc. IIR Safety Reporting Reference Manual Version 3, and IIR SAE Form 
Completion Guide, or Form FDA 3500 A (Med Watch Form) . This will be faxed to [COMPANY_007], Inc. U.S. Clinical Trial Department at [PHONE_065] using the [COMPANY_007], Inc. Investigator Initi ated 
Research Reportable Event Fax Cover Sheet . The Investigator- Initiated Research Serious 
Adverse Event (IIR SAE) form must be submitted to [COMPANY_007], Inc. immediately for a death or life-threatening event, and within 24 hours for all other types of SAEs. Any SAEs reported to [COMPANY_007], Inc. should also be faxed to NCCN at [PHONE_6815] or emailed via [EMAIL_2528].  All Serious adverse Events (SAE’s) will have written report sent to:  
 1. Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_7966]: Fax 647-8792  2. Data Manager  
 3. The Oncology Clinical Trials Support Unit ( O-CTSU ) staff will coordinate the reporting 
process between the Investigator and the IRBMED as well as other applicable reporting agencies (FDA, CTEP, NCCN, [COMPANY_007], Inc.). Copi[INVESTIGATOR_325241].  
 Deaths or life -threatening adverse events will be reported to the University of Michigan Medical 
Institutional Review Board (IRBMED) in accordance with the reporting policy of the IRB.   
12.12.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
 
If a serious adverse event occurs, NCCN and [COMPANY_007], Inc.  are to be notified within [ADDRESS_401650] be made immediately, irrespective of the extent 
of available adverse event information. This timeframe also applies to additional new information (follow- up) on previously forwarded serious adverse event reports as well as to the 
initial and follow -up reporting of Exposure in Utero cases.  [COMPANY_007], Inc.  and NCCN should be 
notified via the reporting requirements stipulated in Section 12.12 (Reporting Requirements). Such events will be reported via submission of Pfi zer, Inc. Investigator -Initiated Research 
Serious Adverse Event (IIR SAE) form, according to guidelines provided in  [COMPANY_007], Inc. IIR Safety Reporting Reference Manual Version 3, and IIR SAE Form Completion Guide, or Form FDA 3500 A (Med Watch Form) . This will be faxed to [COMPANY_007], Inc. U.S. Clinical Trial Department  at [PHONE_065] using the [COMPANY_007], Inc. Investigator Initiated Research Reportable 
Event Fax Cover Sheet . The Investigator -Initiated Research Serious Adverse Event (IIR SAE) 
form must be submit ted to [COMPANY_007], Inc. immediately for a death or life -threatening event, and 
within 24 hours for all other types of SAEs. Any SAEs reported to [COMPANY_007], Inc. should also be faxed to NCCN at [PHONE_6815] or emailed via [EMAIL_2528]. 
Axitinib  In Head And Neck Cancer  --  Protocol For A Phase II Study  
 
37 
  
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of a serious  
adverse event immediately (e.g., if an outpatient study subject initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the adverse event.  
 For all serious adverse events, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to NCCN and [COMPANY_007], Inc.  in accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above. In  
addition, an investigator may be requested by [CONTACT_4618], Inc.  to obtain specific additional follow-up 
information in an expedited fashion. This information may be more detailed than that captured on the adverse event case report form. In general, this will include a description of the adverse event in  sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent  
determination of possible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant medications an d illnesses must be provided. In the case of a subject death, a 
summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to [COMPANY_007], Inc.  or its  
designated representative.  
 
12.12.2. Non- Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
 
Non-serious adverse events are to be reported on the adverse event CRFs, which are to be 
submitted to [COMPANY_007], Inc. . 
 
12.13. Data and Safety Monitoring 
 12.13.1 
This study will be monitored in accordance with the NCI approved University of 
Michigan Rogel Cancer Center D ata and Safety Monitoring Plan. 
 12.13.2. The study team will meet quarterly or more frequently depending on the activity of the protocol. During these regular meetings, the study team  will discuss matters related to:  
1. safety of study participants (SAE/UaP reporting) 2. validity and integrity of the data  
3. enrollment rate relative to expectations, characteristics of participants  
4. retention of participants, adherence to protocol (potential or real protocol deviations) 5. data completeness  
 12.13.3. Study team  meetings will be documented by [CONTACT_325278] (DSMR).  The data manager or designee assigned to the trial will be responsible for completing the report.  DSMRs will be signed by [CONTACT_325279]-investigators and will be kept on file in the Oncology Clinical Trials Support Unit (O-CTSU ). 
 12.13.4. The University of Michigan Rogel  Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee  (DSM C) will provide independent oversight of the safety and data integrity for this 
trial.  DSMRs and any other pertinent documents will be submitted to the DSM C for review on a 
quarterly  basis unless specified more frequently by a DSM C ruling.

13. STATISTICAL METHODS  
 
13.1. Primary Objectives: 
The primary aim of this study is to compare 6- month  overall survival after treatment with 
Axitinib in  patients with unresectable, recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer to historical 
rates. Based on results in the literature, we assume a 6-month mortality rate of 50%  under 
current standard care in this patient population (11, 52). We will test whether survival after 
treatment with Axitinib is improved to 70% at 6-months compared to 50%.   
Overall survival will be determined from the date of treatment initiation to date of death from 
any cause. For the primary endpoint, patients that are alive at 6 mo nths following the initiation of 
study treatment will be considered successful.  All other patients will be considered unsuccessful. Patients will be considered evaluable for the primary endpoint if they receive any dose of Axitinib.  
13.2. Sample size jus tification: 
 
We will enroll 37 additional patients for comparison of overall survival. Based on historical data, 
6 month OS in heavily pretreated patients such as those included in this study is 50%. Thirty-seven patients will provide 80% power to detect a meaningful difference in proportion alive at 6-months (70% vs 50% historically) with a type I error rate of 5%. For the primary endpoint of overall survival we anticipate no missing data and will test whether the proportion alive at 6 months is greater th an the historical rate of 50% with an upper tailed test of binomial proportion. 
Based on our prior experience at the University of Michigan, we anticipate accrual of approximately 4 patients every 5 months. With this rate of accrual, we can enroll 40 eligible patients in 50 months. With a minimum follow -up of 6 month for each patient, the study will 
complete in about 56 months.   
13.3. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_13052]: 
As we observed considerable evidence of activity in UMCC 2011.053, we plan no interim 
analysis  for futility with data collected in the expansion cohort B. Formal analysis of efficacy 
will be performed at trial completion.  
 
13.4. Analysis plan: 
- To estimate survival rates .  
Overall and progression -free survival rates at 2, 4 and 6 months will be reported along with 95% 
confidence intervals based on the binomial distribution.  Kaplan- Meier methods will also be 
conducted to estimate these rates and the medians of PFS and overall survival (OS) of the [ADDRESS_401652] error estimate based on Greenwood’s formula (53).  
Axitinib  In Head And Neck Cancer  --  Protocol For A Phase II Study  
 
[ADDRESS_401653] an objective 
response (complete or partial) and stable disease will be calculated, and a 95% exact binomial confidence interval will be determined. 
- To determine the toxicity profile of this treatment regimen .  
The proportion of treated patients experiencing any clinically significant (Grade 3 or worse) 
toxicity will be determined, with a 95% exact binomial confidence interval; specific toxicities of all grades will be tabulated.  
  
14. DATA ANALYSIS  
 
14.1. Analysis of Overall Survival  
Overall survival will be determined from the date of treatment initiation to date of death from 
any cause. For the primary endpoint, patients that are alive at [ADDRESS_401654] whether 
the proportion alive at 6 months is greater than the historical rate of 50% with an upper tailed test of binomial proportion. 
 
 
14.2. Safety Analysis 
 
All patients receiving at least 1 dose of Axitinib under this protocol will be included in the 
safety analyses. Adverse events will be coded and grouped by [CONTACT_6764]. The incidence of each adverse event will be tabulated and displayed by [CONTACT_325280]. Tabulations by  
[CONTACT_325281].  Summary patient listings 
will be provided for SAEs, adverse events resulting in discontinuation of Axitinib, and deaths within 28 days of drug discontinuation and possibly or probably related to Axitinib.  
14.3. Efficacy Analysis 
 
Efficacy a nalysis will include Progression -free survival (PFS), Overall response rate (ORR), 
including complete (CR) and partial response (PR), stable disease, disease control rate (CR+PR+stable disease) at 16 weeks, along with overall survival (OS).  
 
 
15. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
 
Axitinib  In Head And Neck Cancer  --  Protocol For A Phase II Study  
 
[ADDRESS_401655] (IRB)/Independent 
Ethics Committee (IEC), and/or to quality assurance audits performed by [CONTACT_4618], Inc. , and/or to 
inspection by [CONTACT_4708].  It is important that the investigators and their relevant personnel are av ailable during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.  
 
16. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
 
16.1. Case Report Forms / Electronic Data Record  
 
As used in this protocol, the term Case Report Form (CRF) should be understood to refer to 
either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this trial.  
 A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject. The completed original  
CRFs are the sole property of [COMPANY_007], Inc.  and should not be made available in any form to third 
parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007], Inc.  or appropriate regulatory authorities, 
without written permission from [COMPANY_007], Inc. . 
 It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure completion and to review and approve all CRFs. CRFs must be signed by [CONTACT_198429]. These signatures serve to attest that the information contained on the CRFs is true. At all times, the investigator  
has final personal responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of all clinical and laboratory data entered on the CRFs. Subject source documents are the physician’s subject records  
maintained at the trial site. In most cases, the source documents will be the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s or the physician’s chart. In cases where the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54602]’s chart,  
the information collected on the CRFs must match those charts.  
 In some cases, the CRF may also serve as the source document. In these cases, [COMPANY_007], Inc.  and 
the investigator must prospectively document which items will be recorded in the source documents and for which items the CRF will stand as the source document.  
16.2. Record Retention  
 
To enable evaluatio ns and/or audits from regulatory authorities , NCCN  or [COMPANY_007], Inc. , the 
investigator agrees  to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient 
information to link  records, e.g., CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed 
consent forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], serious adverse event forms, source documents, and detailed 
Axitinib  In Head And Neck Cancer  --  Protocol For A Phase II Study  
 
[ADDRESS_401656] obtain NCCN’s  written 
permission before disposing of any records, even if retention requirements have been met. 
 
17. ETHICS  
 
17.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) 
 
It is th e responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the trial protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent forms, and other relevant documents, e.g., advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/IEC. All correspondence with the IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator File. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/IEC approvals should be forwarded to NCCN . 
The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/IEC approval is where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate haz ards to the subjects. In that 
event, the investigator must notify the IRB/IEC and NCCN in writing within [ADDRESS_401657] be prospectively approved by [CONTACT_28150]/IEC and NCCN before use.  The investigator must ensure that each study subject, or his/her legally acceptable representative,  
is fully informed about the nature and objectives of the study and possible risks associated with participation. The investigator, or a pers on designated by [CONTACT_093], will obtain written  
informed consent from each subject or the subject’s legally acceptable representative before any  
study- specific activity is performed. The investigator will retain the original of each subject’s  
Axitinib  In Head And Neck Cancer  --  Protocol For A Phase II Study  
 
42 
 signed  consent form. 
 
17.4. Reporting of safety issues and serious breaches of the protocol or ICH GCP 
 
In the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) by [CONTACT_325282], or if the investigat or is aware of any new  
information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of Axitinib, [COMPANY_007], 
Inc. should be informed immediately. 
 In addition, the investigator will inform [COMPANY_007], Inc.  immediately of any urgent safety measures 
taken by [CONTACT_1205], and of any 
serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of.  
18. COMPLETION OF TREATMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
 
After completion of treatment on study patients will be followed for survival.  Survival assessment can be done by [CONTACT_325263] (+/- 1 month)   
19. NCCN DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA 
 
Premature termination of this clinical trial may occur because of a  regulatory authority decision, 
change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100]/IEC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of NCCN . In 
addition, [COMPANY_007], Inc.  retains the right to discontinue development of A xitinib  at any time.  
NCCN reserves the right to discontinue the trial prior to inclusion of the intended number of 
patients, but intends only to exercise this right for valid scientific or administrative reasons. If a trial is prematurely terminated or discontinued, NCCN will promptly notify the investigator.  
After no tification, the investigator must contact [CONTACT_112077] a [ADDRESS_401658] extent possible.  
 
20. PUBLICATION OF TRIAL RESULTS

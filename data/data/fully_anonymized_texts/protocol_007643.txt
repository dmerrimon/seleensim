B Study Background and Objectives  
 
*required  
Provide the background and rationale of  the study including appropriate 
references if not included in a study protocol.  
 
The goal of this study is to develop and evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of a 
patient -centered, mobile -first website Aid For Fertility -Related Medical Decisions (AFFRMED). 
The AFFRMED is targeted for transgender youth facing fertility preservation (FP) decisions 
due to gender -affirming treatments that impair long -term fertility. The AFFRMED will positively 
impact care for transgender youth by: (1) foster ing patient -centered communication about 
sensitive issues related to future fertility, (2) aiding transgender youth in making difficult 
decisions about medical care that may impact future fertility, and (3) facilitating informed 
decision -making about FP.  
A.1. Fertility is an understudied issue in transgender care. Gender -affirming hormones (GAH;  
i.e., estrogen for transgender women; testosterone for transgender men) are medically 
indicated to treat gender dysphoria (i.e., distress due to a mismatch between birth-assigned 
sex and gender identity). However, long -term GAH use leads to impairments in gonadal 
histology that cause infertility or biological sterility. However, clinical thresholds have not been 
established for amount and duration of exogenous GAH ex posure leading to permanent 
negative effects on fertility. Thus, the Endocrine Society clinical practice guidelines, the World 
Professional Association of Transgender Health standards of care, and the ethics committee 
of the American Society of Reproductiv e Medicine all recommend counseling regarding fertility 
and reproductive options for transgender individuals before initiating GAH treatment.  
A.2. FP options have expanded significantly in recent years, offering transgender youth 
theopportunity to preserve thei r reproductive autonomy. Until recently, many transgender 
people regarded the loss of fertility as the “price to pay” for gender transition. However, there 
are now non -experimental FP options available to post -pubertal transgender individuals. 
Options incl ude cryopreserving mature gametes (i.e., eggs and sperm) that would otherwise 
be adversely affected by [CONTACT_875245]. Transgender adults are increasingly referred 
for FP as there is growing recognition that they desire biological children at simil ar rates as 
their cisgender counterparts. One study found that over a third of transgender adults surveyed 
would have cryopreserved gametes had FP technology been available. However, two recent 
studies show that less than 5% of transgender youth pursue FP,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_875233]. Reasons youth cited for not pursuing FP included cost, 
invasiveness of procedures, desire not to delay medical transition, and intent to adopt children 
or no intent to parent in the future. Yet , our community survey of [ADDRESS_1222387] (36%) were interested in having biological children and a quarter (26%) were 
unsure about their parenting intentions. Almost half the transgender adolescents sampled in 
another study recogn ized that their desires for biological parenthood might change over time. 
Moreover, our preliminary data suggest that transgender youth lack specific knowledge of 
GAH effects on fertility and FP options. Thus, transgender youth may be making decisions 
that have long -term implications on their reproductive health and autonomy based on 
incomplete knowledge and understanding of reproductive biology and FP options. Taken 
together, findings suggest that current protocols for fertility counseling may not be meeti ng 
youths’ needs for informed decision -making.  
A.3. Evolving standards of transgender healthcare emphasize the need to address 
fertilityearlier in the care continuum. As public awareness of gender diversity has increased 
over the last decade, transgender youth are seeking transition -related medical care at younger 
ages. Providing medical care to transgender youth in early puberty complicates fertility -related 
counseling. Clinical practice guidelines recommend pubertal suppression with gonadotropin -
releasing horm one analogues (GnRHa) for youth in early puberty (i.e., Tanner stages 2 -3). 
GnRHa represent a reversible intervention that suppresses sex hormone production, which 
prevents pubertal changes that may be emotionally distressing to transgender youth. 
However,  GnRHa not only prevents the development of unwanted secondary sex 
characteristics, but also suspends germ cell maturation. Puberty appears to progress normally 
after discontinuing GnRHa treatment. But transgender youth typi[INVESTIGATOR_875234]. Thus, germ cells never fully mature, 
limiting non -experimental FP options. This emphasizes the need for fertility -related counseling 
before initiating GnRHa treatment, when youth may be as young as 8 -9 years old. A s such, 
parents of peripubertal transgender youth are often tasked with making medical decisions that 
can impair their child’s reproductive functioning and interfere with reproductive autonomy.  
A.4. Experimental protocols are currently in place for storing prep ubertal gonadal tissue for 
pediatric patients who are receiving gonadotoxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Current American Society of 
Clinical Oncology Guidelines recommend a discussion of investigational FP options with 
parents of prepubertal oncology patients. The updated Endocrine Society guidelines also 
specifically recommend fertility discussions with early pubertal transgender youth and their 
families prior to starting GnRHa. Fertility experts expect that methods for maturing precursor 
egg and sperm cells will be possib le with advanced assisted reproductive technologies (ART) 
in the future. Therefore, clinicians must educate youth and families on the potential for ovarian 
or testicular tissue cryopreservation to protect the reproductive autonomy of transgender 
youth.  
A.5. Discussions and decisions about FP are complicated because: (1) clinical thresholds 
have not been established for how much GAH exposure will lead to permanent negative 
effects on fertility, (2) pediatric FP options and ART are complex and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_92311], (3 ) 
transgender youth must consider parenting intentions although youth may not be 
developmentally ready to engage in family planning decisions, and (4) impaired fertility affects 
future quality of life, rather than current functioning or survival. Additiona lly, fertility -related 
decision -making is highly subjective, relying on patient values and preferences, which 
emphasizes the importance of implementing a shared decision -making model. The proposed 
decision aid will provide education on gender -affirming int erventions affecting fertility and 
logistical considerations in weighing whether or not to pursue FP. The decision aid will include 
values clarification exercises and support shared decision -making. Novel decision aid formats 
using web -based, interactive t echnologies have been shown to improve patient knowledge, 
timely access to care, and decision satisfaction.  
Use of a Delphi expert panel will contribute to information included within the decision aid. 
International experts will be asked to provide their thoughts on necessary content to include in 
the decision aid to incorporate multiple perspectives on relevant  content.  
A.6. Contribution of the Proposed Work. Our long -term goal is to improve quality of care for 
transgender youth. Developi[INVESTIGATOR_007], evaluating, and disseminating a patient -centered Aid For 
Fertility -Related Medical Decisions (AFFRMED) targeted for transgender  youth represents a

If a visit schedule/table is not provided in D.2, ensure that this narrative includes 
the expected location and length of each visit.  
Aim 1: Develop a patient -centered Aid For Fertility -Related Medical Decisions (AFFRMED) 
targeted for transg ender youth.  
Aim 1a. Apply user -centered design principles to develop a web -based AFFRMED prototype 
with input from a multidisciplinary transgender health and fertility medicine expert advisory 
panel. The  
AFFRMED prototype will be developed using the Ottawa Decision Aid Toolkit, informed by [CONTACT_875252], and the International Patient Decision Aids Standards. Our  
decisional needs assessment identified the following fertility topic domains and information 
needs: (1) general education  about reproductive biology, (2) current information about how 
gender -affirming medical and surgical treatments affect fertility potential, (3) FP options, and 
(4) short -term and long -term considerations about pursuing FP or not. Content will be 
transforme d into text, images, graphics, and videos that utilize gender inclusive language, 
are accessible (i.e., literacy levels <5th grade), visually attractive and user friendly, and 
convey the decisions that need to be considered. An interactive, web -based AFFRM ED 
prototype will be created, organized by [CONTACT_875253], current, and desired future gender -affirming 
medical and surgical interventions that affect fertility potential.  
A 5-person multidisciplinary panel will be assembled to serve as the AFFRMED Expert 
Advisory B oard. Experts will be provided with the AFFRMED prototype and given [ADDRESS_1222399]’s comments and suggestions in 
revising the AFFRMED prototype.  
Additionally, we will use a Delphi metho d expert panel to gather feedback from a panel of up 
to [ADDRESS_1222400] 3 in -person participatory design focus 
groups in an iterative fashion. The purpose of these user -centered design sessions is to 
identify optimal content and technical features, as well as solicit feedback on the user interface 
so that the AFFRM ED prototype can be refined. Each 90 -minute focus group will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238] a trained research coordinator using a moderator’s guide to lead 
focus group discussions. Each group will include 6 -9 participants (18 -27 participants total). 
Separate focus groups will be held for transgender AYA ages 13 -24 ("GAH cohort") and 
parents of transgender AYA ages 13 -24 ("GAH parent cohort"). A third focus group will 
comprise transgender youth ages 8 -14 ("GnRHa youth cohort") and parents of transgender 
youth a ges 8 -14 (GnRHa parent cohort"). We will provide participants with mock -ups of the 
AFFRMED prototype and ask for structured feedback on design, layout, and content, including 
length and clarity. The mock -ups will be a mixture of paper mock -ups as well as w eb-based 
mock -ups. Focus groups will be audiorecorded and reviewed by [CONTACT_3476], who will 
carefully consider and incorporate comments, suggestions and proposed changes in the 
revised AFFRMED prototype.  Focus groups will occur in a private room at Lur ie Children's. 
Youth in the GnRHa cohort (ages 8 -14) will participate in the same focus group as their 
parents, thus they will be in the same room with their parents.  
Usability Testing. Usability testing allows for the optimization of a tool prior to its i ntegration 
into a clinical workflow environment. Each study visit is expected to last 45 -60 minutes and will 
be conducted by a trained research coordinator. We will ask participants to use the AFFRMED 
prototype in the laboratory setting and “think aloud” a s they navigate through the decision aid.  
Usability testing will involve the use of a desktop or laptop computer using the AFFRMED 
prototype hosted by [CONTACT_875254], the company  we are developi[INVESTIGATOR_875237]. For example, specifying why they a re clicking on a specific part of the tool and explaining 
why it is (or is not) helpful. We also will give participants target goals (e.g., go find X content) 
and observe whether they can find the most efficient pathway to identify target content. This 
type of usability testing identifies barriers to adoption and surface level usability issues. These 
research visits will be audio -recorded and reviewed by [CONTACT_3476], who will carefully 
consider and incorporate comments, suggestions, and proposed changes in revising the 
AFFRMED prototype.  
D.1 
Usability testing will follow an iterative process in rounds of 4, with 1 participant from each 
target subgroup (1 parent and 1 youth/AYA from each cohort) completing usability tests before 
revising the AFFRMED for th e next set of usability testing. We will recruit up to 5 transgender 
youth/AYA and 5 parents of transgender youth/AYA from each cohort (GnRHa and GAH 
cohorts; up to 20 total participants) to complete usability testing. Participants who participated 
in the focus groups may participate in this phase if they are interested.  Study visits will occur 
in a private room at Lurie Children's. Youth under the age of [ADDRESS_1222401] of the  
AFFRMED.  
 Measure Development. We will follow the recommended steps for scale development 
proposed by [CONTACT_875255]: (1) determine clearly what is to be measured; (2) generate an 
item pool; (3) de termine the format for measurement; (4) have the initial item pool reviewed by 
[CONTACT_106971]; (5) administer items to a development sample; (6) evaluate the items; and (7) 
optimize the scale length.  
 Cognitive Interviews. We will recruit up to 10 transgender yo uth/AYA and up to 10 parents of 
transgender youth/AYA to complete cognitive interviews of the knowledge test instrument to 
refine wording and item order. The purpose of cognitive interviews is to understand whether 
subjects understand the question, both co nsistently across subjects and in the way intended 
by [CONTACT_3021]. Participants will be asked to “think aloud” and provide their interpretation of 
each scale item’s meaning and provide suggestions for revisions. These interviews will last 
30-45 minutes and will be audio -recorded and reviewed by [CONTACT_875256]. Cognitive interviews will be conducted in an iterative manner until no additional 
measurement concerns arise.  Study visits will occur in a private room at Lurie  
Children's. Y outh under the age of [ADDRESS_1222402] validity will be 
established using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract factors. Reliability will be 
assessed with Cronbach’s alpha. The study visit will last [ADDRESS_1222403] will ask questions related to knowledge of fertility and 
fertility preservation. Study visits will occ ur in a private room at Lurie Children's. Youth under 
the age of 12 will complete the study visit in a room separate from their parents.  
 Aim 2: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_332100], acceptability, and efficacy of the AFFRMED on knowledge in a 
pre-/post -test design.  
We will evaluate the AFFRMED in a single -arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_242028], acceptability, and efficacy trial 
among transgender patients who are considering GnRHa and GAH and their parents. We will 
recruit 10 youth/AYA and 10 parents as described in Section C.4. Subj ects will participate in a 
2-hour, in -person visit. During this visit they will complete the pre -AFFRMED 15 -20 minute 
demographics survey (e.g., age, fertility history), the validated Transgender Youth Fertility 
Attitudes Questionnaire (TYFAQ), and the fer tility knowledge test instrument developed in Aim 
1c. Each participant will receive the corresponding version of the demographics survey. Then, 
they will freely navigate the web -based AFFRMED prototype for [ADDRESS_1222404]. Participants will also be asked to rate the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of 
the AFFRMED using validated implementation outcome measures: Acceptability of 
Intervention Me asure (AIM), Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM), and Feasibility of 
Intervention Measure (FIM). The AIM (4 -items; Cronbach’s α=.85) measures the perception 
among participants that the AFFRMED is agreeable, palatable, or satisfactory. The IAM (4 -
items; Cronbach’s α=.91) measures the perceived fit, relevance, or compatibility of the 
AFFRMED to address fertility -related decision -making. The FIM (4 -items; Cronbach’s α=.89) 
measures the extent to which participants feel the AFFRMED can be successfully us ed in the 
clinical setting. Items are rated on a 5 -point Likert scale from completely disagree (1) to 
completely agree (5), with higher scores indicating greater acceptability, appropriateness, and 
feasibility. Study visits will occur in a private room at Lurie Children's. Youth under the age of 
[ADDRESS_1222405]. The development of the AFFRMED will involve three sequential steps:  
AFFRMED Development  
(1) expert panel (Aim 1A)  
(2) participatory design focus groups (Aim 1B)  
(3) usability testing (Aim 1B)  
Development of the knowledge test will occur simultaneously, and will also involve three 
sequential steps:  
(1) measure development (Aim 1C)  
(2) cognitive interviews (Aim 1C)  
(3) measure validation (Aim 1C)

8 Risks and Benefits  
A Study Risks  
 
*required  
Are there risks associated with study participation aside from those related to 
A.1 
confidentiality/privacy as outlined in Section 6?  
 
✔ Yes 
*required  
Summarize and provide an overall assessment of the 
physical/psychological/emotional risks and discomforts of the study 
interventions and procedures.  
 
The risks of participation in this study are minimal. Potential risks consist of  
A.1a discomfort with interview questions and potential breaches of confidentiality. It is 
possible that certain questions may make participants  feel uncomfortable.  
Procedures for youth who do experience discomfort are detailed below. 
Additionally, a number of p recautions and safeguards have been developed in 
order to protect the confidentiality of study participants. No personal identifying 
information will be used on study measures. Consent forms will be filed and 
stored separate from the raw data in a secured location under double -lock when 
not in use with restricted access during work hours and/or when unattended.  
*required  
Describe steps that will be taken to minimize the risks listed above.  
 
Protection against Risk  
Discomfort or distress during the researc h. Because there is potential for 
psychological discomfort due to the research topic, we will make every effort to 
create a secure and trustworthy environment. Participants will be informed that 
they do not have to answer any question they do not wish, and  they can take 
breaks while completing the survey. Moreover, the participant can ask study staff 
to provide referrals to counselors or other means of support if they become 
emotionally upset.  
A.1b Participants will have access to a licensed clinician ([CONTACT_186672]) who can help 
address any feelings and/or questions which arise in the course of their 
participation.  
Confidentiality of study data. We have developed systematic protocols for data 
handling and storage over multiple studies. Computer files consist of de-
identified survey responses. Tracking files are maintained in password -protected 
electronic systems on a secure, password -protected institutional server. The 
database contains all contact [CONTACT_3031], and is used to recruit eligible patients. 
Contact [CONTACT_875271] a participant completes the survey. 
Contact [CONTACT_875272]’s data collection.  
*required  
Describe the patient safety monitoring plan for the study.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
Procedures for Monitoring Data Management and Integrity  
To protect the integrity of participants’ data, the Project Coordinator will assign an 
ID number to all pa rticipants. The participant ID number will be used to identify 
data collected. Since the study has repeated follow -up visits, we will maintain a 
list of participants which link identifying information to study ID numbers. Only a 
limited number of staff mem bers will have access to this list, which will be kept in 
locked files and in a password protected computer file. Other study personnel will 
have access on an as needed basis to perform their duties.  
All research personnel will complete extensive training before they are granted 
access to this identifying information. Study personnel will complete Human 
Subjects Training which complies with federal guidelines delineated in 45 CFR 
Part 46.  
Personnel will also sign confidentiality statements that specify that  if the 
participants’ confidentiality is breached unintentionally that personnel will follow 
the procedures for reporting this breach to the PI. The confidentiality statement 
also states that unintentional or deliberate violations of participants’ 
confiden tiality may result in demotion or termination depending upon the severity 
of the event.  
Personnel will also participate in training with the Investigators and/or Project 
Coordinator regarding data safety, confidentiality of participants, limits of 
confiden tiality, and proper administration of the study protocol.  
We will store all personally identifying data in locked cabinets. All forms 
containing personally identifying information, including participant locator forms  
(i.e., containing contact [CONTACT_3031]) will be maintained in a password -protected 
A.1c computer file.  
Data that are entered into computer files will be de -identified and maintained on a 
subdirectory of an institutional server with access password protected. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_875240], curr ent and future, to use the data and any data files that are 
provided to other individuals will be de -identified.  
Procedures for Monitoring Adverse Events  
Possible adverse events that are anticipated include the need to violate 
participant confidentiality. Study personnel will be trained regarding the limits of 
confidentiality. This training will include reviewing possible scenarios and 
knowledge of key questions to assess risk. We will train staff to err on the side 
of caution and to contact a supervisor as  needed. Supervisors will be available 
by [CONTACT_648] [ADDRESS_1222420]. Under the guidance of supervisors, staff will be trained either to ensure 
the safety of participants (i.e. call the police, or if appropriate, to escort 
participants to the Emergency room).  
Possible adverse events that are unantic ipated will be brought to the attention of 
the Principal Investigators and reported immediately to all relevant IRBs. The IRB 
will determine whether it is appropriate to stop the study protocol temporarily or 
will provide suggestions/modifications to the s tudy procedures. Possible 
modifications include adding these possible adverse events to the consent form 
and re -consenting all study participants. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_875241] a monthly basis at regularly scheduled resear ch meetings. 
She will keep a written log of all adverse events and ensure that the IRB is 
contact[CONTACT_15608]. She will also keep a log of the outcome of IRB decisions 
regarding adverse events and apprise the research team of any changes that 
need to be made as a result of IRB decisions.

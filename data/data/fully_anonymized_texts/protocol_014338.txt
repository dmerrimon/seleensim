2PRÉCIS
Background:  
This is a study to investigate in a preliminary fashion the feasibility of short course 
chemotherapy to participants with HIV-associated non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HIV-NHL).  
This study will investigate if the paradigm for treatment can be successfully changed from a 
standard of 6 cycles to one cycle beyond complete remission with 6 total allowable cycles.  
Objective:
To assess with 90% probability that at least 50% of participants treated with short-course 
EPOCH-R will be progression free at one year.
Eligibility:
Aggressive CD20 positive DLBCL.
HIV+ serology.
All stages (I-IV) of disease.
ECOG Performance status 0-4
NHL previously untreated with cytotoxic chemotherapy.  
Age  18 years 
May not be pregnant or nursing
May not have received previous rituximab
Design:
Participants will be treated every three weeks with a combination of EPOCH and rituximab 
for one cycle beyond CR/CRu by [CONTACT_670462] a minimum of three 
and maximum of six cycles. Following cycle 2, CT, positron emission tomography scans 
(PET), and bone marrow biopsies (if initially positive) will be performed.  
At the conclusion of the study, we will estimate whether the number of cycles can be reduced 
using the paradigm.  If the cumulative number of participants to relapse exceeds 25% by 6 
months, the study will be closed.  
Following the completion of chemotherapy, restaging will be performed 2 months following 
the end of treatment, then every 3 months for one year, every 6 months for one year, then 
every 12 months until relapse, death, or loss to follow up.
Antiretroviral therapy (ART) will be given concurrently with treatment regimen.   
To study the effects of treatment approach on parameters of HIV disease, measurements of 
CD4 cells and viral loads will be made at baseline and at the completion of therapy, and then 
2 months following the end of treatment, and then every 3-6 months for a total of 24 months 
following chemotherapy.

1.[ADDRESS_905732] suggested that chemotherapy dose-intensity (the amount of chemotherapy administered 
over time) is associated with curative potential 8.  Indeed, large studies of low- versus standard 
dose chemotherapy in HIV-NHL suggest that more patients in the low-dose groups die with 
active lymphoma than in the standard dose groups 1.  Also, attempts at preservation of CD4 cell

8counts by [CONTACT_670463]-HIV therapy may not be very useful when lymphocytotoxic 
chemotherapy is administered to treat the lymphoma.  In HIV-negative patients undergoing such 
therapy, CD4 cell depletion in excess of 80% of baseline can often occur9, and recovery to 
baseline may not occur for greater than [ADDRESS_905733] of balancing these 
effects.  The administration of short-course (2-3 cycles) chemotherapy as we propose would 
represent a significant change in the standard treatment paradigm, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_670446] 6 to 8 
cycles.  Such a strategy may result in significantly less chemotherapy related immune damage 
with better preservation of lymphocytes and potentially reduce the risk for AIDS-related 
mortality.  
The concept of shorter course chemotherapy extends from our initial clinical research in HIV-
associated lymphoma utilizing dose-adjusted EPOCH.   This regimen appears to be effective and 
relatively well-tolerated when administered over 6 cycles11.  Among 30 evaluable patients, 23 
(77%) achieved a complete response, 100% of whom remain disease free with a median follow-
up over 2 years.  Of note, patients who achieved a complete response with EPOCH did so by 
[CONTACT_5265] 4, and many had rapid resolution of all palpable tumor masses within 1 to 2 cycles.   
Indeed, the 100% disease free survival rate following [ADDRESS_905734] interests of the participants on study at this time. ART 
has been shown to be safe when administered concurrently with EPOCH and is no longer 
routinely stopped during the treatment of HIV-associated malignancies similar to those under 
study 40, 41.
Rituximab is a chimeric antibody, containing the human IgG1 and  constant and murine 
variable regions, which targets the CD20 B cell antigen 14.  CD20 is expressed on the surface of 
normal and neoplastic B cells and is present from the pre-B cell stage through terminal 
differentiation to plasma cells 15, 16. To date, the biological functions of CD20 remain uncertain, 
although incubation of B-cells with anti-CD20 antibody has variable effects on cell cycle 
progression, depending on the monoclonal antibody (MoAb) type.  Ligation of CD20 by B1 
Abbreviated Title: Short-Course Therapy AIDS-NHL
Version Date:  07/01/2022
9MoAb inhibits B-cell progression from G 1 to the S/G 2+M phases of the cell cycle following 
mitogen stimulation, whereas IF5 MoAb, which binds to a different CD20 epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230], can deliver 
an activation signal and drive resting Go B cells into G1, but not into S phase 17-19.  
Mechanistically, binding of MoAb to CD20 generates transmembrane signals that produce a 
number of events including autophosphorylation and activation of serine/tyrosine protein 
kinases, and induction of c-myc oncogene expression and major histocompatibility complex 
(MHC) class II molecules 18, 20.  Studies have shown that CD20 is also associated with 
transmembrane Ca2+ conductance, through its possible function as a Ca2+ channel, and may 
explain some of the differential effects of IF5 and B1 MoAb’s on B-cells.  The IF5 MoAb may 
activate resting B cells by [CONTACT_670464]2+ entry, while B1 MoAb does not have acute 
effects on Ca2+ currents.  Both MoAb’s, however, may lead to sustained intracellular Ca2+ levels 
over time with subsequent inhibition of cell cycle progression from G 1 into S phase 18, 20.  These 
studies demonstrate the importance of CD20 in B-cell regulation, but do not in themselves 
indicate how ligation of the receptor by [CONTACT_670465].  
The clinically important mechanisms of rituximab cytotoxicity remain unclear.  Although ADCC 
and complement mediated cytotoxicity can be demonstrated in vitro, accumulating evidence 
suggests that disruption of normal signal transduction by [CONTACT_398]20 MoAb can directly induce 
apoptosis 21, 22.  Shan et al showed that proliferation of a B-cell line could be directly inhibited by 
[CONTACT_670466]5 MoAb in heat-inactivated serum (i.e. inactivated complement) and that complement-
replete serum further contributed to inhibition of proliferation 21.  Of note, in the absence of 
complement, the antiproliferative effect of IF5 MoAb was more dependent on CD20 saturation 
and cell density.  The investigators further determined whether anti-CD20 MoAb’s induced B-
cell apoptosis following inhibition of cell growth through the use of three complementary assays.  
When used alone, neither IF5 nor B1 MoAb’s induced significant apoptosis, but when cross-
linked with a goat anti-mouse antibody (GAM), apoptosis occurred in 22% and 28% of cells at 
24 hours, compared to 5% in the controls; similar results were also produced in tonsil B cells.  
These results suggest that similar cross-linking must occur in vivo for anti-CD20 MoAb to 
directly induce apoptosis.  The investigators postulated that functional cross-linking may occur 
in patients through the binding of the MoAb’s Fc domain to the Fc R of adjacent cells and 
showed, using a mouse fibroblast transfected with the human Fc receptor, a similar degree of 
apoptosis as observed with GAM cross-linking.  
Accumulating evidence suggests there is an interplay of both pro and anti-apoptotic events in 
response to a cellular stress such as ligation of the CD20 receptor, which would result in either 
cell survival or death 23.   Although studies in other experimental have identified a number of 
cellular events associated with apoptosis, these pathways are poorly understood with anti-CD20 
MoAb’s.  In a preliminary study, Mathas et al investigated the regulation of apoptosis in a human 
Burkitt-lymphoma cell line following exposure to the IDEC-C2B8 anti-CD20 MoAb 22.   Growth 
inhibition of cells occurred 4 hours after exposure to immobilized MoAb, followed by a 
significant rise in apoptotic cells as early as 6 hours later with 70% apoptotic cells after 20 hours.  
Study of major regulators of apoptosis failed to show a change in bcl-2, bax, bcl-x and bad 
protein levels after 20 hours of incubation.  Of note, caspase-3 activation occurred following 
CD20 ligation, and the caspase-3 target proteins D4-GDI and PARP were shown to be cleaved; 
events that are similar to those observed with surface IgM-mediated (sIgM) apoptosis in human 
Burkitt lymphoma cell lines.  Furthermore, these events could be abrogated by z-DEVD-fmk, an 
inhibitor of caspase-3.  These observations suggest that both sIgM and ligation of CD20 by

rituximab-induced cell death.  
It is well established that combinations of biologic and/or cytotoxic agents can potentiate tumor 
cell sensitivity through synergistic interactions or possibly reversal of drug resistance 24, 25.  In 
this regard, it is of great interest to explore such interactions with rituximab because of its unique 
mechanisms of action and targeted approach.  Demidem et al undertook such a study to examine 
the sensitizing effect of C2B8 (rituximab MoAb) to cytotoxic agents on a human B-cell line 26.  
For these studies, the DHL-4 tumor cell line was used because of its relative resistance to 
multiple agents under study including cisplatin, etoposide, doxorubicin, ricin and tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF-), compared to a control T-cell line (CEM).  Incubation of the DHL-4 cells with 4 
g/ml C2B8 for 72 hours sensitized the cells to all agents tested except etoposide.  Using a MTT 
cell kill end-point, pre-treatment with C2B8 produce an approximate 1-log increase in cell kill 
with ricin, TNF-, and cisplatin compared to each agent alone.  There was only a modest 
doubling of doxorubicin cytotoxicity.  Of note, the kinetics of C2B8 preincubation revealed that 
the maximum sensitization was achieved between [ADDRESS_905736] of C2B8 on expression of the multidrug resistance (MDR-1) protein (gp-170) or bcl-2.  In 
contrast, C2B8 did significantly inhibit TNF- secretion whose expression has been associated 
with resistance to cisplatin and doxorubicin.
The clinical study of rituximab and chemotherapy is at the phenomenological stage with results 
available from a few single armed phase II trials.  Nevertheless, these early trials in indolent and 
aggressive lymphomas suggest the presence of potentially important positive interactions 27-29.  
The interpretation of the results, however, is confounded by [CONTACT_670467] a control group.  As a single agent in relapsed lymphomas, rituximab has an 
overall response rate of 48% with a median time to progression of 13 months in indolent 
histologies and a response rate of 31% with a median time to progression of over 8 months in 
aggressive histologies 30, 31.  In both studies, fewer than 10% of patients achieved complete 
responses.  
When rituximab was combined with CHOP (bolus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine 
and prednisone) chemotherapy, there appeared to be a significant increase in overall response 
rate and duration, compared to CHOP alone.  In one study of 35 patients with either relapsed or 
untreated indolent lymphomas, 100% of patients responded with 63% complete and 37% partial 
responses 27.  Of significance, a recent update reported that the median for duration of response 
and time to progression had not been reached with a median follow-up of 46 months32.  By 
[CONTACT_2163], the median response duration for doxorubicin-containing regimens alone in indolent 
lymphomas is approximately 18 months (39).   There was also no difference in either response 
rate or duration of response among naïve and previously treated patients.  Furthermore, among 8 
patients who were bcl-2 positive at baseline, 7 converted to negative in both bone marrow and 
peripheral blood, and 5 remain negative at between 36 and 51 months.    
The combination of CHOP and rituximab has also been tested in previously untreated patients 
with aggressive B-cell lymphomas (36).  In a preliminary report of 33 patients, 97% responded 
with 61% complete and 36% partial responses.  Because of the frequent difficulty in interpreting 
the significance of residual masses, the progression-free survival provides an indication of the 
Abbreviated Title: Short-Course Therapy AIDS-NHL
Version Date:  07/01/2022
11potential rate of cure for a regimen.  In the present study, 82% of participants have remained 
progression-free at a median follow-up of 24 months. By [CONTACT_2163], approximately 48% of 
patients treated with CHOP alone remain progression-free at [ADDRESS_905737] that rituximab may significantly improve the treatment of aggressive lymphomas, they 
should be tempered by [CONTACT_670468] 72% of patients had low (0-2) risk International 
Prognostic Indices (IPI).  
In a third phase II trial, rituximab has been combined with dose-adjusted EPOCH (infusional 
etoposide, vincristine and doxorubicin with bolus cyclophosphamide and prednisone) (EPOCH-
R) chemotherapy in patients with previous untreated aggressive lymphomas 29.  Although the 
results of the trial are early, among the 10 patients enrolled, none had progressed.  Furthermore, 
of 8 evaluable patients, 6 achieved complete responses within 2 cycles, suggesting the 
combination has a high fractional cell kill.  The majority of these patients (70%) also had high 
IPI [INVESTIGATOR_103835].  These investigators also treated [ADDRESS_905738] sensitized the patients to the effects of chemotherapy34.  
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death has been 
reported in some patients with hematologic malignancies treated with rituximab.  The majority of 
patients received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy.  The median time to the 
diagnosis of hepatitis was approximately [ADDRESS_905739] dose. 
Positron emission Tomography (PET) using F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has been studied as 
a predictive tool for treatment outcome in NHL35.  Pre-chemotherapy FDG-PET standardized 
uptake values (SUV) were compared with those determined [ADDRESS_905740] initiation of 
chemotherapy in a study of 11 patients.  FDG uptake parameters at day 7 and day 42 were 
correlated with long-term treatment outcome.  The group of patients with long-term remission 
had significantly lower mean values at these time points as compared to those with disease 
relapse.  Thus, early in the chemotherapy of lymphoma, FDG-PET uptake decreases but does not 
necessarily resolve.  
Beginning with Amendment O, there will be no further enrollments for children younger than 18 
years old.

beyond complete remission (CR/Cru) - with a minimum of [ADDRESS_905745] and 
FDG-PET are repeated after cycles 2 and 3– bone marrow biopsy is repeated after cycle 2 if 
initially positive (and further repeated on subsequent cycles until negative). 
Systemic therapy is stopped once there has been a decrease of < 25% in CT dimensions and/or a 
total PET SUV decrease of > 50% in areas involved by [CONTACT_56927].  These CT and PET 
parameters determine when a participant stops systemic treatment. NOTE:  Prior to Amendment 
S, ART therapy was started 3 weeks after systemic chemotherapy had completed; ART therapy

Intrathecal prophylaxis will begin on cycle 3 day 1 (refer to Section 3.2.2).  Restaging is repeated 
after every further cycle. If disease dimensions increase by > 25% or new disease sites appear on 
therapy (excluding CNS disease), the participant is taken off study. Note that FDG-PET findings 
require clinical and radiological correlation before treatment decisions are made.

183.3 TREATMENT MODIFICATIONS
3.3.1 Rituximab 
For infusion related events or hypersensitivity reactions, the infusion rate should be slowed (e.g. 
for moderate flu-like symptoms of fever, chills, rigors; other infusion related reactions such as 
nausea, urticaria, pruritus, rash, fatigue, headache) or infusion of the drug should be interrupted 
or discontinued as clinically indicated (e.g. for reactions such as angioedema, hypotension, 
bronchospasm); following appropriate treatment and/or resolution of the reaction(s), 
administration of rituximab may be reinitiated at a slower infusion rate (one-half the previous 
infusion rate), and the rate of infusion may be incrementally increased as tolerated.
3.3.2 EPOCH
[IP_ADDRESS] Hematological Toxicity
Nadir Counts:
If ANC<500/mm3 for 2 to 4 days or platelets < 25,000/mm3 for 2 to 4 days reduce 
cyclophosphamide by 187 mg/m2 (i.e. 25% of full dose).  If ANC < 500/mm3  5 days or 
platelets < 25,000/mm3 5 days, reduce cyclophosphamide by 375 mg/m2 (i.e. 50% of full 
dose). In the event that the cyclophosphamide dose had been reduced on the previous cycle, 
it may be increased on the next cycle if the following criteria are met:  if ANC >500/mm3 and 
platelets > 25,000/mm3, then increase cyclophosphamide by 187 mg/m2 each cycle, up to full 
dose (i.e. 750 mg/m2). 
Day One Counts (takes precedent over nadir counts):
If ANC < 1000/mm3 delay up to 2 weeks until ANC has increased (may use filgrastim 300 - 
480 mcg SQ daily). If by [CONTACT_4475] 14, ANC 750 – 999/mm3, reduce cyclophosphamide by 187 
mg/m2. If ANC remains < 750/mm3 on day 14, PI [INVESTIGATOR_670449].  
Bone Marrow Lymphoma and ITP:
These dose reductions do not necessarily apply to participants with bone marrow lymphoma.  
Reductions in these participants must be individually discussed with the PI. Platelet based 
dose reductions do not apply to participants with ITP: for participants with ITP, it is difficult 
to differentiate thrombocytopenia due to ITP from that caused by [CONTACT_11553]. 
Cyclophosphamide dose adjustments for thrombocytopenia in participants with ITP should 
be individually determined by [CONTACT_978].

4 SUPPORTIVE CARE 
4.1 CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (CMV)
Ganciclovir is usually the initial treatment choice, but due to its hematological toxicity, it should 
not be used without consulting the PI.  Both cidofovir and foscarnet are effective in CMV, but 
are nephrotoxic, and will not be used if there is evidence of renal dysfunction.  Urinalysis for 
proteinuria and creatinine clearance estimates or measurements made if these agents are to be 
used.  All cases of CMV infection must be discussed with the PI.

234.2 FUNGAL INFECTIONS
4.2.1 Oral Candidiasis – if asymptomatic, recommend clotrimazole troches.  If symptomatic, 
recommend oral fluconazole.  Fluconazole interacts with many drugs, and can alter 
EPOCH pharmacokinetics and therefore must be held during chemotherapy infusions.
4.2.2 Esophageal Candidiasis – recommend oral fluconazole, but if no response, consider 
amphotericin B. Fluconazole interacts with many drugs, and can alter EPOCH 
pharmacokinetics and therefore must be held during chemotherapy infusions.
4.2.3 Cryptococcus neoformans infection may present as meningitis, pneumonia, or fungemia.  
Recommend amphotericin B and fluconazole. 
4.3 MYCOBACTERIUM DISEASE
4.3.1 Mycobacterium tuberculosis – Inactive versus active infection must be distinguished.  In 
participants with low CD4 counts, 2/3’s present with extrapulmonary disease.  Diagnosis 
may require biopsies in addition to culture.  There is a high incidence of drug resistant 
strains.  Consultation with the infectious disease service is mandatory for these 
participants.  Combination therapy with isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol 
and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is usually initiated.  These drugs may have a marked impact 
on EPOCH pharmacokinetics, and may cause hepatitis, bone marrow suppression, optic 
neuritis and peripheral neuropathy. Due to potential interactions with EPOCH 
pharmacokinetics, these drugs should be stopped during chemotherapy infusions, if 
possible.  
4.3.2 Mycobacterium avium complex usually occurs in participants with CD4+ count 
<100/mm3.  Disseminated infection presents with fever, weight loss, night sweats, 
diarrhea, anemia, neutropenia, and thus may be difficult to differentiate from “B” 
symptoms.  Sputum and blood cultures should be obtained. Clarithromycin or 
azithromycin in combination with clofazimine or rifampin are recommended.  Due to 
potential interactions with EPOCH pharmacokinetics, these drugs should be stopped 
during chemotherapy infusions, if possible.

in infected individuals. Combination antiretroviral therapy suppresses but does not eradicate 
HIV. The mechanism of HIV persistence is unknown, but better understanding of HIV 
persistence will lead to new strategies of HIV eradication. In order to investigate HIV 
persistence, we have been characterizing the genetics of HIV populations in infected individuals 
over time before and after introduction of antiretroviral therapy. It is of great interest to 
investigate the effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy on HIV populations.  In this study, Wilson and 
colleagues39 have demonstrated substantial frequencies of complete and partial responses with 
EPOCH and EPOCH-R chemotherapy delivered in the absence of antiretroviral therapy.  In these 

Abbreviated Title: Short-Course Therapy AIDS-NHL

26studies, participant viral RNA levels increased during chemotherapy, but were all suppressed to 
<50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml after chemotherapy was completed and antiretroviral therapy was introduced. 
It will be of great interest to characterize HIV populations by [CONTACT_670473][INVESTIGATOR_5685], during, and/or following chemotherapeutic regimen.  In these studies, we 
will obtain single genome sequences of HIV present in plasma. We will use phylogenetic and 
other population genetics analytic tools to compare the virus populations present during the 
course of the study period. We will determine whether chemotherapy results in change in overall 
genetic diversity of HIV, whether a shift in HIV populations occurs, and whether specific 
subpopulations of virus are affected more than others.

5.1.3 Lymphomagenesis in HIV positive vs HIV negative individuals [Beginning with Amend 
P (version date: 04/16/2014)] Optional
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for lymphomagenesis correlative studies 
The incidence of certain types of lymphomas in HIV positive participants is significantly higher 
than in HIV negative individuals. Unlike other HIV-associated malignancies such as Kaposi’s 
Sarcoma, the establishment of ART has not improved these statistics. The mechanism for 
lymphomagenesis in HIV positive vs HIV negative individuals and whether there is a difference 
in tumor response of T cells derived from these populations is largely unknown. 
Cytotoxic T cells (CTL) play a major role in fighting viral infections, including HIV and EBV. 
They also play a role in anti-tumor immunity. The infusion of CD8, single-epi[INVESTIGATOR_353335] T 
cells have been shown to be safe in HIV participants but currently has not shown long-term 
efficacy. In the cancer setting, the infusion of EBV-specific CTLs has been largely safe and 
successful. Over 90% of HIV-associated Hodgkin’s Lymphoma is EBV+ and 30-40% of HIV-
associated Burkitt Lymphoma is EBV+. 
Therefore, we hypothesize that we can generate polyclonal CTL products that are specific for 
both HIV (gag, pol, and nef) and EBV latency antigens expressed in HL (LMP1, LMP2, and 
EBNA1). We hypothesize that these CTLs can effectively target both HIV infection as well as 
tumor cells which will (1) allow for immune reconstitution following HIV clearance and (2) 
provide direct anti-tumor activity.
Abbreviated Title: Short-Course Therapy AIDS-NHL
Version Date:  07/01/2022
[IP_ADDRESS] Methods
We plan to ex vivo expand T cell lines targeting both HIV and EBV antigens from HIV positive 
and HIV negative participants with Burkitt Lymphoma or Hodgkin Lymphoma (either currently 
receiving treatment or completed treatment). We can achieve this by [CONTACT_670474] T cells from 50-
100mL of whole blood and stimulating them with antigen presenting cells pulsed with peptides 
from HIV gag, pol, nef and EBV LMP1, LMP2, and EBNA1. We will then use a variety of 
immunoassays to determine these T cells’ specificity and function. Our goal is to determine 
whether there are differences in the anti-lymphoma response between HIV positive and HIV 
negative participants and ultimately, to determine whether these T cells could have clinical 
efficacy in the setting of adoptive T cell therapy.

5.1.4 Detecting Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for MRD assessment
Detecting Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) can be a powerful tool to monitor participants’ 
response to treatment and early detection of relapse.  It is of research interest to determine if 
circulating tumor DNA before, during or after therapy is predictive of long-term disease-free 
survival. Adaptive Biotechnologies Corp will assess whether immune repertoire data (B-cell 
immunoglobulin receptor sequences or T-cell receptor sequences) from the Human Material

5.1.5 Comparison of methods of monitoring circulating tumor DNA
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for comparing ctDNA methods 
The detection of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) in aggressive lymphomas can be a 
powerful tool to monitor participants’ response to treatment and early detection of relapse.  
The field of molecular monitoring of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is an emerging field, 
however, and the most effective technique is unknown.  Multiple methods that interrogate the 
peripheral blood for tumor-specific molecules are under development.  Some technologies 
that assay for the VDJ region of the immunoglobulin receptor (i.e. Adaptive Biotechnologies) 
have been clinically validated, but newer technologies are capable of detecting multiple 
somatic mutations in the ctDNA in addition to detecting the VDJ gene sequence.  The ctDNA 
genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_670453] a broader range of 
participants and may identify novel patterns of clonal evolution.  One such technology is the 
Cancer Personalized Profiling by [CONTACT_115125] (CAPP-Seq) method developed by [CONTACT_670478].  The CAPP-Seq method is an ultrasensitive capture-
based targeted sequencing method that can be used on lymphoid tissue and cell-free DNA in 
order to define key biological features from the tumor.  It is of research interest to determine 
how the CAPP-Seq method compares with the Adaptive Biotechnologies method (i.e. 
clonoSEQ) for monitoring ctDNA before, during or after therapy.  
The CAPP-Seq sequencing panel (i.e. ‘selector’) was designed to maximize the number of 
participants (and mutations per participant) detected, while simultaneously minimizing the 
panel size and sequencing cost. Genomic regions with recurrent somatic alterations in 
DLBCL were therefore prioritized for selector design. As an initial step, single nucleotide 
variants (SNVs) and indels were collected from multiple whole exome and whole genome 
sequencing studies, spanning a total of 102 DLBCL tumors. A bioinformatics approach was 
then applied to identify recurrently mutated regions of the genome harboring single nucleotide 
variants (SNVs) and/or indels that maximally cover both participants and mutations per 
participant. As a second step, the CAPP-Seq includes reported translocation breakpoints 
involving IGH, BCL2, BCL6 or MYC in order to identify hyper-localized and recurrent 
breakpoint regions. In order to capture MYC translocations, CAPP-Seq incorporates two IGH 
regions covering ~50% of MYC/IGH translocations and a single MYC hotspot encompassing 
15% of MYC/non-IGH translocations as well as 2 more MYC breakpoint hotspots spanning 
~5kb, yielding a final predicted coverage of 90% of all MYC translocations. As a third step, 
CAPP-Seq includes genomic regions encompassing Ig VDJ recombination sites and 
mutations arising from activation-induced cytidine deaminase activity (AID/AICDA). 
Specifically, it includes the [ADDRESS_905762] exon of BCL6 as well as the transcription start sites of BCL2, MYC, PIM1 and CD83. 
The final selector design covers 1,053 genomic regions from 268 genes, totaling 242 kb (247 
kb when including additional MYC regions. 
The Alizadeh lab will use the CAPP-Seq method to determine whether the tumor-specific 
genetic aberrations from the human material can be used as biomarkers that correlate with 
disease-free survival. Alizadeh lab will use a proprietary method, CAPP-Seq, for analyzing

Disappearance of all signs and symptoms of lymphoma for a period of at least one month. All 
lymph nodes and nodal masses must have regressed to normal size (  1.[ADDRESS_905769] 
transverse diameter for nodes > 1.5 cm before therapy).  Previously involved nodes that were 1.[ADDRESS_905770] decreased to  [ADDRESS_905771] transverse after treatment or by [CONTACT_726] 75% in the sum of the products of the 
greatest diameters.  The spleen, if considered to be enlarged before therapy on the basis of a CT 
scan must have regressed in size and must not be palpable on physical examination. Any 
macroscopic nodules in any organs detectable on imaging techniques should no longer be 
present.
6.3.2 Complete response unconfirmed (CRu)
A residual lymph node mass > 1.[ADDRESS_905772] transverse diameter that has regressed by > 
75% in sum of the products of the greatest diameters, does not change over the last two 
treatments, and any biopsies obtained are negative will be considered to be in CR.  In organs 
involved by [CONTACT_4623], any residual lesions that have decreased by > 75% in sum of the products of 
the greatest diameters or are < [ADDRESS_905773] two 
treatments will be considered to fulfill criteria for CR.  
6.3.3 Partial response (PR)

8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
8.1.1 Racial/gender make-up
Subjects from both genders and all racial/ethnic groups are eligible for this study if they meet the 
eligibility criteria.  To date, there is no information that suggests differences in drug metabolism 
or disease response would be expected in any one participant group.  Efforts will be made to 
extend accrual to a representative population, but in this preliminary study, a balance must be 
struck between participant safety considerations and limitations on the number of participants 
exposed to potentially toxic treatments on the one hand and the need to explore gender and 
ethnic aspects of clinical research on the other.  If differences in outcome that correlate with 
gender or ethnic identity are noted, accrual may be expanded or a follow-up study may be 
written to investigate these differences.  
8.1.2 Determination of sample size
[IP_ADDRESS] Summary and Original Design
The main parameter of interest is the proportion of participants who are progression free at one 
year.  It would be desirable if 70% of participants were without progression after one year from 
starting treatment, and inadequate if this were only 50%. Because of the relatively long time 
required to evaluate this endpoint (potentially a full year after the last participant has been 
accrued), the study will be conducted as a one-stage trial.  Twenty-eight participants will be 
entered into this study; if at least [ADDRESS_905775] that the treatment is associated with 91% confidence of having at least 50% progression 
free survival at one year.  (This sample size is determined by [CONTACT_2329] a one stage design with 
alpha=0.1, beta=0.2, p0=0.5 and p1=0.7 36).  Confidence intervals about the 12-month DFS point 
will be made, and a Kaplan-Meier curve of disease free survival will also be constructed.
According to the literature and our experience, [ADDRESS_905776] 8 
participants enrolled on the trial, the mean number of cycles has been reduced to 4. We would 
like to provide evidence that the treatment in this protocol is resulting in a marked decline in the 
amount of chemotherapy administered.
We plan to enroll an additional 20 participants onto the study, consistent with the overall ceiling 
of 28. If we hypothesize that the mean number of cycles of chemotherapy will be 4, then with 20 
participants, there is 80% power using a 0.[ADDRESS_905777] deviation is 
1.5. We will determine the overall mean number of cycles given until CR/CRu, and will form an 
appropriate confidence interval about this number, to demonstrate whether this represents a 
marked decrease from the norm.

Abbreviated Title: Short-Course Therapy AIDS-NHL
Version Date:  07/01/[ADDRESS_905778] progressed 
after achieving a CR/CRu by 6 months exceeds 25%, then consideration will be given to 
modifying the therapy or terminating further accrual to the trial.
No formal comparison with any other group of participants is planned for this particular study. 
This study is being conducted as a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_670456] a multi-center AIDS malignancy trials consortium or 
other cooperative group.  It is recognized that the results from this trial are limited by [CONTACT_96101] 
a concurrent control group, but this is being done deliberately as a precursor to such a study, 
which would require considerably more participants and more institutions in order to be 
completed expeditiously.
Since beginning this study, there has emerged controversy regarding the role of rituximab in the 
treatment of ARL. A recently published randomized study of R-CHOP versus CHOP in ARL 
(Kaplan et al.) concludes that while rituximab is associated with a better tumor response, it is 
associated with an inferior clinical outcome because of toxicity. In our present study, we have 
achieved our initial goal of PFS in favor of at least 70%; current data shows a PFS of 77% at one 
year. This has been achieved with no treatment related deaths and with a median of 3 treatment 
cycles, which is 50% fewer than standard treatment. Given these very favorable results, and the 
need to provide further precision regarding the efficacy and safety of rituximab in ARL, we are 
increasing our accrual ceiling by 15 participants, for a total accrual ceiling of 43 participants. 
This will also allow us to gain further information on the efficacy of SC-EPOCH-R in subgroups 
of participants with low CD4 < 100/mm3 and in whom rituximab was associated with increased 
infectious deaths in the Kaplan et al study.  Hence, this study is important to evaluate the role of 
rituximab, especially in a heavily immunosuppressed population. 
The most recent analysis performed indicated an 81.5% PFS probability at 30 months, and 
77.9% survival at that point. Since these results are favorable, it would be desirable to increase 
the precision of the estimates and to allow further participants to enroll into a study with 
promising results. As such, the accrual ceiling will be set at 50 participants, to permit the 
maximum confidence interval width for PFS to be approximately 22% (from 69% to 91%) if the 
results are maintained. 
The projected accrual rate for the study is at minimum [ADDRESS_905779] 
conservative estimate thus is that it would take at maximum 28 months to meet the accrual 
ceiling.
[IP_ADDRESS] Revised Design
As of December, 2011:  this study enrolled 56 participants. A replacement protocol has recently 
opened for accrual of participants with Burkitt’s lymphoma.  The present study has demonstrated 
successful outcomes for a population of participants with DLBCL, with 84% 5 year PFS and 
68% 5-year OS39. Thus far, we have enrolled 45 participants with HIV+ DLBCL.  To provide 
further information on the efficacy of limited treatment among participants with germinal center 
B-cell like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (GCB) and non-GCB DLBCL (which has an inferior 
outcome), we wish to increase the accrual by [CONTACT_33018] 20 participants to increase the 
Abbreviated Title: Short-Course Therapy AIDS-NHL
Version Date:  07/01/2022
39precision of the estimates of clinical outcomes for participants with DLBCL and to maintain a 
referral pattern until a replacement protocol is made available to subsequent participants. 
Thus, the total accrual ceiling as of the amendment dated 12/28/[ADDRESS_905780] treatment values differ from baseline.  Although these evaluations will be 
considered exploratory, and no formal correction for multiple comparisons will be employed, the 
results will be interpreted cautiously in view of the number of potential comparisons being 
performed.
9 COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS
This study involves a number of Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs). The listing and numbers 
for these will be maintained outside of the protocol. 
[ADDRESS_905781] SELECTION
Persons with HIV infection are at increased risk of aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.  For 
the age group under 19 years, there is nearly a 300-fold excess in cases above that expected in 
the HIV-negative age-matched population, and a 60-fold excess overall for all age groups 37.  
There are no established guidelines for treatment of the pediatric patient population with HIV-
NHL.  Maternal transmission of HIV has been substantially decreased as a result of antiretroviral 
therapy.  Therefore, this protocol will include participants  age [ADDRESS_905782] benefit from research participation (Section 10.5), all subjects ≥ age 18 will be offered the 
opportunity to fill in their wishes for research and care, and assign a substitute decision maker on 
the “NIH Advance Directive for Health Care and Medical Research Participation” form so that 
another person can make decisions about their medical care in the event that they become 
incapacitated or cognitively impaired during the course of the study.

injection site reactions and kidney damage may occur. 
10.5.3 Risk related to blood sampling
Side effects of blood draws include pain and bruising, lightheadedness, and rarely, fainting. 
10.5.4 Risks related to Bone Marrow Biopsy 
The risks associated with bone marrow biopsies are pain and bleeding at the biopsy site. Rarely, 
there is a risk of infection at the sampling site.
10.5.5 Risks related to Lumbar Puncture
The risks associated with lumbar puncture may include pain or bleeding at the site of needle 
insertion (the low back), infection, and headache. Most people tolerate this treatment without 
serious side effects.
10.6 CONSENT P ROCESSES AND D OCUMENTATION
The informed consent document will be provided as a physical or electronic document to the 
participant or consent designee(s) as applicable for review prior to consenting. A designated 
study investigator will carefully explain the procedures and tests involved in this study, and the 
associated risks, discomforts and benefits. In order to minimize potential coercion, as much time 
as is needed to review the document will be given, including an opportunity to discuss it with 
friends, family members and/or other advisors, and to ask questions of any designated study 
investigator. A signed informed consent document will be obtained prior to entry onto the study.
The initial consent process as well as re-consent, when required, may take place in person or 
remotely (e.g., via telephone or other NIH approved remote platforms used in compliance with 
policy, including HRPP Policy 303) per discretion of the designated study investigator and with 
the agreement of the participant/consent designee(s). Whether in person or remote, the privacy of 
the subject will be maintained. Consenting investigators (and participant/consent designee, when 
in person) will be located in a private area (e.g., clinic consult room). When consent is conducted 
remotely, the participant/consent designee will be informed of the private nature of the 
discussion and will be encouraged to relocate to a more private setting if needed.  
Consent will be documented with required signatures on the physical document (which includes 
the printout of an electronic document sent to participant) or as described below, with a manual 
(non-electronic) signature [CONTACT_62579].  When required, witness signature [CONTACT_62580].

12.1.1 Supply
Commercially available: 
CTEP held IND until amendment dated 03-15-10
CTEP supplied until amendment dated 03-15-10
Rituximab is provided in pharmaceutical grade glass vials containing 10 mL (100mg) or 50 mL 
(500) mg at a concentration of [ADDRESS_905790] of adverse events.
Abbreviated Title: Short-Course Therapy AIDS-NHL
Version Date:  07/01/2022
4512.1.2 Storage
Rituximab for clinical use should be stored in a secure refrigerator at 2º to 8°C. 
12.1.3 Preparation
Rituximab will be diluted to a final volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride or 5% Dextrose Injection 
to prepare a standard product with concentration of 2 mg/ml.  Caution should be taken during the 
preparation of the drug, as shaking can cause aggregation and precipi[INVESTIGATOR_151176]
12.1.4 Stability
After dilution, rituximab is stable at 2-8 degrees C (36-46 degrees F) for 24 hours and at room 
temperature for an additional 24 hours.
12.1.5 Administration
A peripheral or central intravenous line will be established. During rituximab infusion, a 
participant's vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], temperature) should be monitored 
according to the standard of care. Medications readily available for the emergency management 
of anaphylactoid reactions should include: epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (1:1000, 1 mg/mL) for subcutaneous 
injection, diphenhydramine hydrochloride for intravenous injection, and resuscitation equipment.
Prophylaxis against hypersensitivity and infusion-related reactions associated with rituximab will 
include acetaminophen [ADDRESS_905791] dose of 
prednisone 60 mg/m2 (or a glucocorticoid equivalent dose of an alternative steroid) at least 60 
minutes before rituximab treatment commences.
Rituximab will be administered as an intravenous infusion at 375 mg/m2 on day 1 of each cycle 
of EPOCH, immediately prior to starting etoposide + doxorubicin + vincristine administration. 
For Low Risk Participants receiving EPOCH-RR, Rituximab will also be administered on day 5 
of each cycle, following etoposide + doxorubicin + vincristine but prior to cyclophosphamide 
administration. Rituximab infusions will be administered to participants primarily in an 
outpatient clinic setting.  
First dose:
The initial dose rate at the time of the first rituximab infusion should be 50mg/hour (25 mL/hr) 
for the first 30 minutes. If no toxicity is seen, the dose rate may be escalated gradually in 50 
mg/hour (25 mL/h) increments at 30-minute intervals) to a maximum of 400 mg/hour (maximum 
rate = 200 mL/h). 
Second and Subsequent Doses (select the appropriate administration timing):
90-minute Administration
If the first dose of rituximab was well tolerated, subsequent doses may be administered over 90 
minutes with 20% of the total dose given in the first 30 minutes, and remaining 80% of the total 
dose administered over the subsequent 60 minutes; e.g.:

46Two-Step Rate Escalation Volume to administer (X mL)
1st portion (0 – 30 minutes)
2nd portion (30 – 90 minutes)
Special Note: The 90-minute infusion scheme is not recommended for participants with 
clinically significant cardiovascular disease or high circulating lymphocyte counts (≥5000/mcL).
Standard Administration for Second & Subsequent Infusions
Participants who tolerate initial treatment without experiencing infusion-related adverse effects 
but for whom the 90-minute infusion scheme during subsequent treatments is considered 
inappropriate, may receive subsequent rituximab doses at the Standard Rate for Subsequent 
Infusions, which is as follows:
Begin at an initial rate of 100 mg/hour (50 mL/h) for 30 minutes. If administration is well 
tolerated, the administration rate may be escalated gradually in 100-mg/hour (50-mL/h) at 30-
minute intervals to a maximum rate of 400 mg/hour (maximum rate = 200 mL/h).
CAUTION:  DO NOT ADMINISTER AS AN INTRAVENOUS PUSH OR BOLUS.  
12.1.6 Safety Profile
No dose-limiting effects were observed in the Phase I/II studies.  Reported adverse events 
including fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, rhinitis, asthenia, and hypotension, occurred 
primarily during rituximab infusions and typi[INVESTIGATOR_670459] a slower rate.  
Fatal Infusion Reactions:  Severe and fatal cardiopulmonary events, including angioedema, 
hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], myocardial infarction, and 
cardiogenic shock, have been reported.  These severe reactions typi[INVESTIGATOR_26654] 30-120 minutes.
Cardiac Events:  Patients with preexisting cardiac conditions, including arrhythmia and angina, 
have had recurrences of these cardiac events during rituximab infusions.
Tumor Lysis Syndrome:  Tumor lysis syndrome, some with fatal outcome, has been reported and 
is characterized in patients with a high number of circulating malignant cells (≥25,000 ul) by 
[CONTACT_334230], renal insufficiency, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, 
hyperuricemia, and hyperphosphatemia.
Renal Events:  Rituximab has been associated with severe renal toxicity including acute renal 
failure requiring dialysis and in some cases, has led to death.  Renal toxicity has occurred in 
patients with high numbers of circulating malignant cells (≥25,000/mm2 ) or high tumor burden 
who experience tumor lysis syndrome and in patients administered concomitant cisplatin.
Mucocutaneous Reactions:  Severe bullous skin reactions, including fatal cases of toxic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_223865], have been reported in patients treated with 
rituximab.  The onset of reaction has varied from 1 to 13 weeks following rituximab exposure.TotalDose(mg)

47Hematologic Events:  In clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 cytopenias were reported in 48% of 
patients treated with rituximab; these include: lymphopenia (40%), neutropenia (6%), leukopenia 
(4%), anemia (3%), and thrombocytopenia (2%).  The median duration of lymphopenia was 14 
days (range, 1 to 588 days) and of neutropenia was 13 days (range, 2 to 116 days).  A single 
occurrence of transient aplastic anemia (pure red cell aplasia) and two occurrences of hemolytic 
anemia following Rituximab therapy were reported. 
In addition, there have been a limited number of post-marketing reports of prolonged 
pancytopenia, marrow hypoplasia, and late onset neutropenia. 
Infectious Events:  Rituxan induced B-cell depletion in 70% to 80% of patients with NHL and 
was associated with decreased serum immunoglobulins in a minority of patients; the 
lymphopenia lasted a median of 14 days (range, 1-588 days).  Infectious events occurred in 31% 
of patients: 19% of patients had bacterial infections, 10% had viral infections, 1% had fungal 
infections, and 6% were unknown infections.  Serious infectious events (Grade 3 or 4), including 
sepsis, occurred in 2% of patients.
Hepatitis B Reactivation:  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, hepatic 
failure, and death has been reported in some patients with hematologic malignancies treated with 
rituximab.  The majority of patients received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy.  The 
median time to the diagnosis of hepatitis was approximately four months after the initiation of 
rituximab and approximately one month after the last dose.
Other Serious Viral Infections:  The following additional serious viral infections, either new, 
reactivated or exacerbated, have been identified in clinical studies or post-marketing reports. The 
majority of patients received Rituxan in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a 
hematopoietic stem cell transplant. These viral infections included JC virus (progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy [PML]), cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus 
B19, varicella zoster virus, West Nile virus, and hepatitis C. In some cases, the viral infections 
occurred up to one year following discontinuation of Rituxan and have resulted in death.
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)
PML is a rare disease caused by [CONTACT_670484].  Immunosuppression allows reactivation of the JC virus which causes demyelination and 
destruction of oligodendrocytes resulting in death or severe disability.  Rare cases of PML, some 
resulting in death, have been reported in patients with hematologic malignancies who have 
received rituximab.  The majority of these patients had received rituximab in combination with 
chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant.  Cases of PML resulting in 
death have also been reported following the use of rituximab for the treatment of autoimmune 
diseases. The reported cases had multiple risk factors for PML, including the underlying disease 
and long-term immunosuppressive therapy or chemotherapy.  Most cases of PML were 
diagnosed within [ADDRESS_905792], brain MRI, and lumbar puncture should be 
considered as clinically indicated.  In patients who develop PML, rituximab should be 
discontinued and reductions or discontinuation of any concomitant chemotherapy or 
immunosuppressive therapy should be considered.
Abbreviated Title: Short-Course Therapy AIDS-NHL
Version Date:  07/01/2022
48Bowel Obstruction and Perforation:  Abdominal pain, bowel obstruction and perforation, in some 
cases leading to death, were observed in patients receiving Rituxan in combination with 
chemotherapy for DLBCL. In post-marketing reports, which include both patients with low-
grade or follicular NHL and DLBCL, the mean time to onset of symptoms was 6 days (range 
1−77) in patients with documented gastro-intestinal perforation. Complaints of abdominal pain, 
especially early in the course of treatment, should prompt a thorough diagnostic evaluation and 
appropriate treatment.
Immunogenicity:  Patients may develop a human anti-chimeric antibody (HACA) response with 
rituximab treatment.  The clinical significance of this is unclear.
Pregnancy:  B-cell lymphocytopenia generally lasting less than 6 months can occur in infants 
exposed to rituximab in utero.
Immunization:  Response rates may be reduced with non live vaccines.
Additional Safety Signals:  The following serious adverse events have been reported to occur in 
patients following completion of rituximab infusions: arthritis, disorders of blood vessels 
(vasculitis, serum sickness and lupus-like syndrome), eye disorders (uveitis and optic neuritis), 
lung disorders including pleuritis and scarring of the lung (bronchiolitis obliterans), that may 
result in fatal outcomes, and fatal cardiac failure.
See the rituximab Investigator Brochure for additional details regarding safety experience with 
rituximab.

14.2 APPENDIX  B:  EPOCH  ADMIXTURES: PREPARATION AND ADMINISTRATION 
Preparation
All 3-in-1 admixtures dispensed from the Pharmacy will contain a 24-hour supply of etoposide, doxorubicin, and 
vincristine, PLUS 40 mL overfill (excess) fluid and a proportional amount of drug to compensate for volume lost in 
parenteral product containers and administration set tubing.
Etoposide DoseVolume of Fluid 
Containing a Daily DoseVolume of Overfill
(fluid + drug)Total Volume in the Product
(including overfill)
< 130 mg 528 mL 40 mL 568 mL
> 130 mg 1056 mL 40 mL 1096 mL
Before dispensing 3-in-1 admixtures, Pharmacy staff will:
[1] Purge all air from the drug product container,
[2] Attach an administration set appropriate for use with a portable pump,
[3] The set will be primed close to its distal tip, and
[4] The set will be capped with a Luer-locking cap.
Pre-printed product labeling will identify the ‘Total Volume To Infuse’ and the ‘Volume of Overfill (fluid + drug)’.
Bags will be exchanged daily for four consecutive days to complete a 96-hour drug infusion (unless treatment is 
interrupted or discontinued due to un-anticipated events).
Administration
Portable pumps used to administer etoposide + doxorubicin + vincristine admixtures will be programmed to deliver 
one of two fixed volumes at one of two corresponding fixed rates based on the amount of etoposide and fluid that is 
ordered (see the table, below).
Etoposide DoseTotal Volume to 
Infuse per 24 hoursVolume of Overfill
(drug-containing fluid)*Administration Rate
< 130 mg 528 mL 40 mL 22 mL/hour
> 130 mg 1056 mL 40 mL 44 mL/hour
* DO NOT attempt to infuse the overfill.
At the end of an infusion, some residual fluid is expected because overfill 
(excess fluid and drug) was added; however, nurses are asked to return to the 
Pharmacy for measurement any drug containers that appear to contain a 
greater amount of residual drug than expected.
Example at right: The amount of fluid remaining in a bag after 
completing a 24-hour infusion (1056 mL delivered).

 Purpose  
The purpose of this study is to explore the wear experience of current  Comfilcon A ( Biofinity ® toric ) 
contact [CONTACT_20927] A ( PRECISION1® ) Contact [CONTACT_20928] .   
 Study Overview  
This open -label  study is of current Biofinity ® toric (Cooper Vision, San Ramon, CA, [LOCATION_003]) contact [CONTACT_20929]. Subjects will be refit into PRECISION1® for Astigmatism 
contact [CONTACT_20930] [ADDRESS_19707] lenses are associated with less lens deposits, which decreases 
associated comfort issues in lens wearers, including decreasing the risk of triggering Giant papi[INVESTIGATOR_20926] (GPC) and/or ocular allergic responses in patients.[ADDRESS_19708] lens wear with plann ed 
replacement lenses.3 The subjects in this study are current satisfied wearers of 1 month  planned 
replacement lenses ( Biofinity ®) and will be fit into PRECISION1 for Astigmatism daily disposable contact 
[CONTACT_13276], which are less likely to be associated with the already minimal risks of daily contact [CONTACT_13279].  
 
   
  Version 1 
  08Jul2021  Key Endpoints:  
• Visual Analog Scale survey of lens wear symptoms (comfort, dryness, vision)  
• Subjective assessment of P1 with CLDEQ -8  
• Assessment via q uestionnaire about quality of life , preference, and lens modality experience  
 
Study Time Points:  
Visit [ADDRESS_19709] arrives on site if possible.   The participant 
will verify their current prescription for Biofinity ® lenses in which one or both eyes utilizes a toric lens for 
astigmatism.  The participant will answer questions about ocular health to further determine eligibility. Participants will also verify that they are happy with their current lenses. Upon reporting to the in -person 
portion of the visit, v isual acuity and an evaluation of the subject’s ocular health will occur . Biofinity ® 
lenses will be evaluated and optimized before dispensing a new pair of lenses for approximately 1 week 
of wear.  
Visit 2: Biofi nity® contact [CONTACT_20931] 1 fitting visit .  Patients will verify that  they are still 
satisfied with their current Biofinity ® toric contact [CONTACT_20932], lens fit and ocular 
health will be assessed.  Subjects will t hen be fit with PRECISION 1® Contact [CONTACT_20933], initial comfort , and initial vision.  Lenses will be dispensed and a contact 
[CONTACT_20934] -up visit will be scheduled.  
Visit 3: The contact [CONTACT_20935] 2  week s (±3 days) following the initial 
fitting.  Subje cts will have visual acuity, an assessment of ocular health , and lens fit completed.  Subjects 
will then complete surveys about their lens wear experience.  
  
Surveys will  include:

of the OSU College of Optometry may be sent for local doctors to notify eligible potential su bjects about 
the study.  
 
Inclusion criteria :  
• Subjects must be current Biofinity ® toric lens wearer in one or both eyes .    
• Subjects must have 20/25 or better distance visual acuity  with current lenses . 
• Good general health (defined by [CONTACT_20937])  
• Ability to give informed consent  
• Willing to spend time for the study .  Subjects will be require d to attend two study visits 
and wear contact [CONTACT_20938].   
• Either gender  
• Any racial or ethnic origin  
Exclusion criteria :  
• No current ocular inflammation or infection as assessed by [CONTACT_20939]  
A team member trained in the consent process will provide the consent document for the potential 
subject to read and will review the procedures with reference to the consent form. The individual is then 
provided with time to read the consen t form and offered the opportunity to ask questions. The participant 
is explicitly told that they may stop participation at any time. All subjects will have the capacity to give 
informed consent. If there is any doubt as to the subject’s ability to consent  to the study, the subject will 
be excluded from the study. If the subject agrees to take part in the screening or measurement, he or she will sign and date the most recent IRB -stamped consent as will the team member. The subject will be 
provided with a co py of the consent form.  
The investigator team is trained in privacy issues and will be reminded of the importance of patient privacy 
prior to study initiation. Potential study participants will contact [CONTACT_20940], emails or 
hearing abou t the study by [CONTACT_6063], giving them the choice of whether or not they wish to 
participate in a study for people with dry eyes.  Privacy is protected by [CONTACT_20941], and no other personal or medical informati on that should be private to the 
patients. The PHI needed is only for the purposes of this study. It is highly unlikely, indeed extremely 
remote that the dry eye symptoms or signs are related to private or personal information that should or 
would be prefe rred to be kept confidential to the patients. Risk factors for dry eye rarely relate to matters 
  Version 1 
  08Jul2021  or conditions that would be personal to the patient such as personal relationships, behaviors or diseases 
that one prefers to keep private and confidential.  
 
Statistical Analysis and Power Calculation  
This small sample size of 30 was chosen for convenience,  as this study is not intending to prove superiority, 
but to study the acceptability of the study lens in previous successful Biofinity ® wearers.   
 
Data Manage ment and Security  
During the active stages of the study (recruitment to last measurement visit), all paperwork (consents, 
questionnaires and data forms) for each subject will reside in a subject folder for easy access throughout 
the study. The folders will  reside in the limited -access research area, in a locked file drawer or cupboard. 
At the completion of the study or disenrollment of a subject the paperwork in the subject’s folders will be reorganized into a regulatory binder (consents, W -9s) and a data b inder (questionnaire and data forms) 
and will reside in an office in the limited -access research area. When the data analysis is completed and 
the study is considered complete, the binders will be stored in the secure Department or Office Clinical 
Research  Area. Paperwork (questionnaire and data forms) for individuals who participate in the baseline 
visit but are not eligible to continue the study will be stored in the study regulatory binder in an office in the limited -access research area. An electronic file of potential subjects and a file of enrolled subjects with 
their contact [CONTACT_3031], as well as electronic files of collected data with the subject number, will reside on a limited -access shared drive with firewall and password protection and is restricted to individuals in 
the research team. Any electronic data files that contain PHI will be destroyed at the conclusion of the 
study.  
 
Risks to Subjects and Mitigation Although rare, a subject could experience eye pain, changes in vision, continued redne ss or irritation of 
the eye when inserting or learning to insert a contact [CONTACT_13293]. More likely transient blurring of vision (less 
than one minute) or mild, transient (less than a minute) stinging may occur.  
 
Adverse Events  
All adverse events will be document ed and reported under the guidelines of The Ohio State University 
Event Reporting guidelines, with any serious, unanticipated and related events being reported to the IRB, 
by [CONTACT_978], within [ADDRESS_19711] Dismissal  
Subjects who, after study team member coaching, are not able to provide analyzable data may be 
dismissed from the study . Data may not be analyzable if a participant is unable able to utilize the 
  Version 1 
  08Jul2021  examination room equipment, for example. These issues are usually revealed at the screening assessment 
visit. Subjects who cannot provide analyzable data will be dismissed for the study. Subjects who do not 
keep scheduled visits within the required time frame will be dismissed from the study. Study team 
members will make reasonable efforts to accommodate subjects’ schedules.  
 
Protocol Violations, Discontinuation  
In the event that a member of the study team or a representative of sponsor becomes aware of a major 
protocol violation, the IRB shall be notified within [ADDRESS_19712] Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2015;56(8):4403- 4412.

Investigational Product Dosage and Mode of Administration:  
SAGE -[ADDRESS_1250946] gelatin capsules for oral administration. Available 
dose strengths of SAGE -217 are:  
• 50-mg with the option to reduce to 40- mg for intolerable AEs  
Duration of Treatment:  
SAGE -217 or placebo will be administered once daily for 14 days.  
Statistical Methods:  
Detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study will be provided in the statistical 
analysis plan (SAP). The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.  
General Considerations  
For the purpose of all primary and secondary a nalyses where applicable, baseline is defined as the last 
measurement prior to receipt of IP.  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with number (n), mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum. In addition, change from baseline values will be  calculated at each time 
point and summarized descriptively. For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries will include 
counts and percentages.  
Analysis Sets 
The Safety Set will include all participants administered IP.  
The Full Analysis Set will include all randomized participants who received any amount of IP and 
have a valid baseline and at least one valid postbaseline HAM -D total score.  
The Per Protocol Set is defined as all participants in the Full Analysis Set without any major protocol 
deviatio ns that could affect efficacy.  The review of major protocol deviations will be completed, and 
the decision on whether the deviation affects efficacy will be documented before database unblinding.  
Determination of Sample Size 
Using a [ADDRESS_1250947] at an alpha level of 0.05, a sample size of approximately 86 evaluable 
participants per treatment group would provide 90% power to detect a placebo -adjusted treatment

23 5. INTRODUCTION  
Postpartum depression ([COMPANY_003]) is defined as the occurrence of major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_5319] 
4 weeks of delivery ( DSM -IV 1994)  or up to a year after giving birth ( Okun 2013) . In Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM -5), the onset specifier includes the entire 
pregnancy as well as 4 weeks following delivery ( DSM -5 2013).  There are 2 entry criteria for the 
diagnosis of depression (depressed mood and/or loss of interest) and 7 associated symptoms of 
depression (appetite problems, sleep problems, motor problems, lack of concentration, loss of energy, poor self-esteem, and suicidality). To be diagnosed with severe [COMPANY_003], women must 
present at least 5 symptoms of depression ( DSM -5 2013) . The  estimated prevalence of [COMPANY_003] in 
the US is 11.5% ( Ko 2017) . Based on data from several studies, approximately 25% of [COMPANY_003] 
cases are considered severe ( McCabe 2016; PACT Consortium 2015) . If untreated, [COMPANY_003] can 
have devastating consequences for the woman and her family ( Fihrer 2009; Verbeek 2012).  
[COMPANY_003] is characterized by [CONTACT_893261], loss of interest in daily activities, changes in eating and sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_285816], fatigue and decreased energy, inability to concentrate, and feelings of worthlessness, shame, or guilt. 
Postpartum depression  also carries an increased risk for suicide ( Savitz 2011; American 
Psychiatric Association 2013),  which is the leading cause of maternal death following childbirth 
(Oates 2003 ) in developed countries. 
Current standard of care for severe [COMPANY_003] comprises cautious use of pharmacological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_893249] a number of counseling, behavioral, and nonpharmacological therapy approaches 
(Altshuler 2001) . Use of tricyclic antidepressants and/or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
(SSRIs ) is based on use in the general depressed population rather than any extensive studies in 
[COMPANY_003] ( Austin 2013)  Data to support the efficacy of MDD antidepressants in [COMPANY_003] are mixed (refer 
to Investigator’s Brochure for more information). SSRIs tend to be preferred due to better data 
on safety while breastfeeding (Altshuler 2001) . Based on the level of evidence for 
antidepressants in MDD ( Kirsch 2008; Fournier 2010), there is a considerable need for improved 
pharmacological therapy for [COMPANY_003].  
In 2019, brexanolone , a positive allosteric modulator of γ -aminobutyric acid ( GABA)
A receptors, 
the major class of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain, was approved by [CONTACT_4760] 
a treatment for [COMPANY_003]. In clinical studies, intravenous infusion of brexanolone over 60 hours was 
more effective than placebo in improving depressive symptom scores in women with moderate to severe [COMPANY_003] ( Kanes 2017; Meltzer -Brody 2018).  These data suggest that augmenting 
extrasynaptic GABA
A receptor function provides a therapeutic benefit in [COMPANY_003].  
5.1. SAGE -217 
SAGE -217 is a synthetic positive allosteric modulator of GABA A receptors. In pharmacokinetic 
(PK) studies in mice and rats, SAGE -[ADDRESS_1250955] good extravascular exposure. In exploratory in vitro receptor and ion channel assays and in vivo safety pharm acology studies, 
SAGE -217 was highly selective for GABA
A receptors, and, consistent with the actions of other 
GABA A receptor potentiators ( Rudolph 2011), exhibits potent anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and 
sedative activity when administered in vivo. 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-[COMPANY_003]-301, Version 2 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
24 Unlike ot her neurotropic medications that target GABA A receptors, SAGE -217 is an allosteric 
modulator of both synaptic as well as extrasynaptic GABA A receptors ( Martinez Botella 2017 ). 
As such, SAGE -217 may represent a therapeutic advantage in the treatment of depressive 
disorders, including [COMPANY_003], by [CONTACT_893262]. 
In a Phase 3 study of adults  with severe [COMPANY_003], rapid and significant improvements of depressive 
symptoms were observed over 14 days of treatment. The SAGE-217 treatment group began to 
show statistically significant improvement over the placebo group as early as Day  3. The odds 
ratios associated with response and remission were 2.6 and 2.5, respectively, favoring SAGE -217. This im provement over the placebo group was overall consistent across assessments 
(ie, HAM -D, MADRS, HAM -A, CGI -I) and was sustained after the treatment period was 
completed. 
5.2. Potential Risks and Benefits 
The apparent risks of SAGE -[ADDRESS_1250956] not been studied in participants with [COMPANY_003], but the benefit- risk profile is expected to be acceptable (see Section  5.3). Refer to the Investigator’s 
Brochure for a detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of 
SAGE -217. SAGE -217 may present a treatment option for [COMPANY_003] that has mor e rapid onset of 
action (days instead of weeks) when compared to current standard of care.  
Based on nonclinical findings, embryo- fetal toxicity and withdrawal effects are considered 
important potential risk s for SAGE -217. Risk mitigation measures in this s tudy include 
monitoring for adverse effects, monitoring for potential withdrawal effects, requiring highly 
effective contraceptive measures for study participants, and inclusion of dose adjustment criteria . 
Finally, due to the sedation/somnolence observed, SAGE -217 is administered in the evening in 
this study. 
Given the outcome of the completed studies of SAGE -217 in adults with MDD and P PD, the 
current significant unmet need in the treatment of depression, and a favorable benefit- risk 
profile, further investigation of SAGE -217 in adults with [COMPANY_003]  is justified.  
5.3. Dose Justification  
To date, the current capsule utilized in clinical studies is not associated with a maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD). Initial MTD assessments were performed using SAGE -217 in an oral 
solution (OS) at steady -state in healthy participants, which provided an MTD with a C max of 
125 ng/mL at 30 mg OS. While reidentification of the MTD using the capsule formulations was not conducted, steady- state 30 -mg capsules provide a model -derived C
max approximately 50% 
lower (64  ng/mL) than the concentration associated with  the MTD of 30 mg OS (125 ng/mL).  
Studies 217- MDD-201 and 217- [COMPANY_003]-201, employ ing 30-mg c apsules administered  each evening 
for 14 days, demonstrated significant reduction in symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia. The safety profile in these studies is consistent with the GABA
A neurosteroid 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-[COMPANY_003]-301, Version 2 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
25 mechanism, including adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of somnolence, sedation, and dizziness at 
rates of 4%  to 15%; the majority with mild intensity. Phase 3 studies in a broader patient 
population demonstrate activit y of SAGE -217 associated with improvement in depressive 
symptoms, however, both the efficacy and safety findings support investigation of a higher dose, 
with predictable ADRs expected to be within an acceptable range.  
Study 217- MDD-301A, a randomized, multi center , 3-arm study examining SAGE -217 20-and 
30-mg capsules compared to placebo, found significant anti depressant  effects compared to 
placebo at Day s 3, 8, and 12 but not Day 15 (primary endpoint) for the 30- mg dose . The 20-mg 
dose did not separate from placebo at any time point. T he rates of expected ADRs of 
somnolence, sedation and dizziness in the 30- mg arm were each less than 10% ; rates of 
discontinuation for adverse events were lower with SAGE-217 30 mg (2.1%) than with placebo 
(3.2%). No clinically relevant changes in vital signs, laborator y results , electrocardiogram 
measures, or suicidal thinking were observed in either 217-MDD-301A or across th e full 
SAGE -217 program, now with over 2000 participants exposed to treatment. Relevant results 
from 217- MDD -301A are available in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
Direct and modeled  data from completed studies to date (including efficacy studies 
217-MDD-201 and 217- [COMPANY_003]-201) in addition to 217- MDD-301A (through Day 42 of the 
double-blind period) , have been used  to assess and predict the efficacy and safety outcomes at 
SAGE -217 concentrations expected with higher doses of SAGE-217 c apsules (eg,  40 and 
50 mg).  
Direct safety data come from more than 140 participants  exposed to concentrations of 
SAGE -217 that are higher than those achieved with a 30-mg capsule daily dose, primarily in the 
clinical pharmacology program. No serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in association 
with any of these higher exposures. Consistent with the pharmacological action of SAGE -217 at 
the GABA A receptor, reports of somnolence, dizziness and sedation were increased at increased 
plasma concentrations. Results from a clinically complete  study that evaluated the effects of 
SAGE -217 on driving performance (217- CLP-113), in which participants (n  = 59) were exposed 
to [ADDRESS_1250957], are illustrative. During treatment with 30 -mg capsules 
daily (Day s 1 to 4), the rates of somnolence and dizziness were 8.5% and 13.6%, respectively. 
After a single dose of 60 mg on Day 5, the rates of somnolence and dizziness increased to 13.8% 
and 22.4%, respectively. For these ADRs, the events were mild or moderate in intensity, and no 
discontinuations due to the adverse events occurred. No events of sedation were reported but 
could be reflected as events of fatigue, which were reported at a rate of 3. 4% with 30  mg (Day 1 
to 4) and 13.8% after a dose of 60 mg on Day 5. In addition, in this study, while there was an 
increase in incidence of somnolence, dizziness and fatigue at 60 mg, there was not an increase in 
the severity of events. Additional data from Study 217- CLP-113 are provided in the 
Investigator’s Brochure. 
Direct evidence related  to efficacy and safety outcomes following administration of SAGE -217 
capsules at doses above 30  mg is further provided by [CONTACT_685679] a Phase 1, placebo -controlled 
study in healthy participants  using a 5-hour phase advance model of insomnia (Study 
217-EXM -101). Administration of single doses of SAGE-217 up to 45 mg improved sleep 
efficiency, duration, maintenance, and sleep quality compared with placebo. Evening 
administration of SAGE -217 was generally well tolerated, with an acceptable safety and 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-[COMPANY_003]-301, Version 2 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
26 tolerability profile. All reported TEAEs were mild and all resolved.  Additional data from Study 
217-EXM -101 are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
Using exposure-response models developed for both efficacy and safety outcomes, the benefit-
risk profile of SAGE -217 at doses of 40- or 50- mg c apsules is expected to be acceptable. In  
Figure 1,  the predicted  concentrations of SAGE -217 following doses of 30-, 40- or 50 -mg 
capsules once daily are shown relative to  2 important concentration markers: C avg as a marker for 
efficacy, identified based on pharmacodynamic biomarker modeling and clinical effectiveness 
(40 ng/mL) and C max as a marker for  safety, associated with the maximally tolerated dose of the 
oral solution (125 ng/mL).

participants  to achieve a steady -state C avg over 40 ng/mL. Figure  1 shows a dose of 50 mg will 
allow  >90% participants  to maintain the target Cavg yet remain within the range of acceptable 
tolerability. With respect to C max, less than 1 in 5 (19%) participants  at the 50- mg dose level are 
expected to exceed a C max over 125 ng/mL, a level observed in Phase 1 studies which utilized 
oral solution and which was associated with a greater rate of sedation events.   
Increased granularity of the exposure- efficacy  relationship is provided in Figure 2. Across 
Studies 217- MDD-201B, 217- MDD-301, and 217- [COMPANY_003]-201, i ncreased concentrations of 
SAGE -217 w ere associated with a larger reduction in depressive symptoms ( Figure  2). Based on 
linear regression modeling, effect sizes for HAM -D were dose dependent, with a 50-mg dose 
administered  once daily for 14 days predicted  to provide grea ter therapeutic benefit compared to 
daily doses of 40 and 30 mg. B ased on the 217-MDD-301 results, a dose of 30 mg may be 
considered the minimally effective dose.

Exposure-response modeling for safety quantified the relationship between maximum plasma 
concentration (C max) and safety from studies  217- MDD-301, 217- MDD-201, and 217- [COMPANY_003]-201. 
The safety endpoint for modeling was selected as the incidence of sedation or somnolence during 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_1250959] 
commonly occurring adverse events with SAGE -217 when considering all doses and 
formulations. Logistic regression modeling indicated higher C max values were associated with an 
increased incidence of sedation or somnolence across mild, moderate and severe intensities. 
Based on this observed relationship, the predicted incidence rates of sedation or somnolence 
were simulated at SAGE -217 doses of 30, 40 or 50 mg administered once daily ( Figure 3).

bar = absolute percentage of patients with sedation or somnolence during treatment with SAGE -217; 
percentage in parenthes es = difference in percentage from placebo.  
While Figure 3 in dicate s an increasing incidence of sedation or somnolence with a higher dose 
the rates of such events across all levels of severity are expected to be approximately 20 % to 
25%, consistent with safety outcomes associated with some  currently available antide pressants.  
As with usual clinical practice, participants will have the option to dose reduce to 40 mg at any 
time should a lack of tolerability develop. As a reflection of the model accuracy, the cohort in 
Study 217- CLP-113 exposed to 30 mg daily for 4 days, followed by a single dose of 60 mg 
achieved a mean plasma concentration of 97  ng/mL at 8.5 hours after dosing, suggesting the C max 
experienced by [CONTACT_893264] 125 ng/mL and was higher than the 
predicted C max of 106 ng/mL for a 50 -mg dose (data on file). 
Safety margins have been calculated using the NOAELs from the 6 -month rat and 9-month dog 
general toxicology studies (most conservative approach) and predicted steady- state exposures in 
humans following daily administration of 30- , 40-, or 50- mg SAGE -217 c apsules. At present, 
mean steady -state exposures in humans following daily administration of 30 mg SAGE -217 
capsules following a high- fat meal (most conservative; C max = 64 ng/mL; area under the curve 
[AUC] = 936 ng⸱h/mL) maintain safety margins of approximately 5x to 8x in rat (C max or AUC) 
and 6x in dog (C max or AUC) relative to the NOAEL in the respective species. While these 
margins are expectedly reduced with higher SAGE -217 concentrations, they remain 
approximately 3x to 5x in rat and 4x in dog (C max or AUC) to predicted pla sma exposures for a 
50-mg capsule administered once daily. 
Sedation, an extension of the pharmacologic mechanism of SAGE-217, was the primary 
dose- limiting effect in toxicity studies in rats and dogs. In dogs,  the toxicologic ‘ effect dose’ 
levels of 2.5 mg/kg/day (9-month study, epi[INVESTIGATOR_893250]) or 2 mg/kg/day (3 -month study) 
associated with a low incidence of convulsion and/or early mortality during or following the 

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-[COMPANY_003]-301, Version [ADDRESS_1250960] levels 
in dogs to potential higher SAGE-217 dose levels (40 or 50 mg/day) remain at or above 4.5x for 
both C max and AUC. All nonclinical  findings are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure. The 
totality of the nonclinical safety data supports the use of SAGE -217 for the treatment of patients 
at the higher clinical dose regimen, particularly in the context of the current safety database of over 2000 participants exposed to SAGE-217 treatment. 
In summary, preliminary results through Day 42 of the double-blind period in Part A of Study 
217-MDD-301 in adults with MDD support the need for higher steady -state concentration s of 
SAGE -217 to allow  participants  to experi ence maximum anti -depressant, anti anxiety , and 
anti-insomnia benefits. Doses of SAGE -217 40 and 50 mg will be utilized in this trial, as well as 
all other ongoing trials with SAGE -217, under the 14-day regimen of a n initial  evening dose of 
50 mg with reduc tion to 40 mg as needed based on tolerability. These higher doses of SAGE-217 
are expected to exhibit a favorable benefit-risk profile in the context of 30 mg now being identified as a minimally effective dose. While higher rates of ADRs may be anticipated, 
SAGE -217 is expected to maintain an acceptable tolerability profile, based on a current safety 
database of greater than 2000 participants exposed to SAGE- 217 treatment across differe nt 
doses/concentrations. In addition, higher doses offer the potential for improved therapeutic benefit over the short 14-day treatment course.

• Change from baseline in HAM- D subscale at Day [ADDRESS_1250961] of a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a 14- day double -blind Treatment 
Period and a Follow- up Period through Day 45.  
The Screening Period begins with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF); the ICF must 
be signed prior to beginning any screening activities. The diagnosis of depression will be 
determined using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -5 (DSM -5) Axis I Disorders (SCID -5-CT). Participants will undergo 
preliminary screening procedures to determine eligibility. A full personal medical history will be 
taken including documentation of all major depression epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], other Axis I disorders, and any prior [COMPANY_003] epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. In addition, [COMPANY_003] epi[INVESTIGATOR_893251] , including siblings, parents, and grandparents will be documented. 
During the study, a qualified lactation consultant will be made available upon request to participants who are breastfeeding.  
Psychotropic medications are permitted provided participants are on a stable dose for at least 
[ADDRESS_1250962] on 
efficacy and/or safety endpoints will not be allowed within 30 days prior to Day 1 through 
completion of the Day 45 assessments. On Day  1, eligible participants will be stratified based on 
use of antidepressant treatment (current/stable or not treated/withdrawn ≥ 30 days or 
>5 half- lives ) and randomized within each stratum to one of 2 treatment groups (SAGE -217 
50 mg or matching placebo) in a 1:[ADDRESS_1250963] (IP) once daily at approximately 8 PM with fat-containing food (eg, within 1  hour of an 
evening meal which contains fat, or with a fat-containing snack), on an outpatient basis, for 14 days. See S ection  10.5 fo r examples of fat-containing snacks. As local regulations permit, IP 
administration will be monitored via a medication adherence monitoring platform  used on 
smartphones to visually confirm IP  ingestion. Participants will return to the study center during 
the treatment and follow -up periods as outlined in Table 2.  
During the treatment period, participants  will be able to receive IP as long as there are no dose 
limiting safety/tolerability concerns. Participants  who cannot tolerate 50 mg will receive 40 mg 
for the remainder of the treatment period. At the discretion of the investigator, participants  who 
cannot tolerate the 40-mg dose will be discontinued from IP.  
Participants  who discontinue IP  early should complete the remaining study visits as schedul ed 
through Day 45 (ie, relative to Day 1) unless the participant withdraws consent or loses the capacity to grant consent. If a participant withdraws from the study/stops study participation 
early, an early termination visit should be conducted.

participants  per treatment group . Additional participants  may be randomized if the dropout rate is 
higher than anticipated (see Section  13.8) . 
7.3. Treatment Assignment 
Participants  will be randomly assigned to a treatment group on Day 1 and will be stratified based 
on use of antidepressant treatment (current/stab le or not treated/withdrawn ≥30 days or 
>5 half- lives ) at baseline. Randomization will be performed within each stratum in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive SAGE -217 50 mg or matching placebo. Additional details on randomization and blinding 
are provided in Section 9.5 .  
7.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria  
During the treatment period, participants  will be able to receive IP as long as there are no dose 
limiting safety/tolerability concerns.  Participants who cannot tolerate 50 mg will receive 40 mg 
for the remainder of the treatment period.   
If dose adjustmen t is deemed necessary by [CONTACT_893265], the participant will return to the site to return any remaining IP and for the adjusted dose 
to be dispensed.  
At the discretion of the investigator , participants who cannot tolerate the 40 -mg dose will be 
discontinued from IP (refer to Section  8.4.1 f or procedures for early IP discontinuation).

9.3. Intervention after the End of the Study  
No intervention following the end of the study is planned.  
9.4. Treatment Adherence  
SAGE -217 or placebo will be self -administered by [CONTACT_893266]. Sites will dispense a weekly supply of IP  to the participants to take at home with 
instructions for use (see Section  10.5  and Table 2 ).  
As local regulations permit , administration of IP  will be monitored by a medication adherence 
monitoring platform used on smartphones to visually confirm medication ingestion. Participants  
will receive a reminder within a predefined time window to take IP  while using the application. 
Participants  will follow a series of prescribed steps in front of the front -facing webcam to 
visually confirm their ingestion of the medication. The application will record the date and time 
of IP  administration by [CONTACT_15994] , as well as missed doses.  
In addition, the participant will be instructed to bring their dosing kit to the site  as outlined in 
Table 2, a t which time the investigator or designee will be responsible for ensuring the kit 
contains sufficient doses for the duration of the treatment period .  
All participants  should be reinstructed  about the dosing requirement during study contacts. The 
authorized study personnel conducting the re-education must document the process in the participant  source records.  
The investigator(s) will record any reasons for noncompliance in the source documen ts.

41 9.5. Randomization and Blinding 
This is a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Participants  who meet the entrance 
criteria will be randomized in a stratified manner based on use of antidepressant treatment  
(current/stable or not treated/withdrawn ≥ 30 days ) at baseline.  
Randomization will be done within each stratum in a 1:1 ratio to receive SAGE -217 50 mg or 
matched placebo.  
Participants, clinicians, and the study team will be blinded to treatment allocation. 
Randomization will be performed c entrally via an interactive response technology (IRT) system. 
Randomization schedules will be generated by [CONTACT_55467]. The allocation to treatment group will be based on the randomization schedule. The randomization schedules will be kept strictly confidential, accessible only to authorized personnel until the time of unblinding. 
The blinding of the study will be broken after the database has been locked. 
9.5.1. Emergency Unblinding  
During the study, the blind is to be broken by [CONTACT_135487] a participant is at risk and the treatment plan is dependent on the study treatment 
received. Unless a participant is at immediate risk, the investigator should make attempts to 
contact [CONTACT_135488] a participant. The responsibility to break the treatment code in emergency situations resides solely with the 
investigator. If the unblinding occurs without Sage’s knowledge, the investigator must notify 
Sage within [ADDRESS_1250978] be clearly documented in the source records.   
In all cases where the IP allocation for a participant is unblinded, pertinent information 
(including the reason for unblinding) must be documented in the participant’s records and on the 
eCRF. At the time of withdrawal from the study/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_127330], if possible, an EOT 
and/or ET visit should be conducted.

participant -specific kits  containing sealed unit doses. Each unit dose consists of 2 capsules (see 
Section  9.1). Additional information regarding the packaging and labeling is provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual.   
Investigational product labels with all required information and conforming to all applicable  
FDA Code of Federal Regulations and Good Manufacturing Practices/Good Clinical Practices guidelines will be prepared by [CONTACT_456]. 
10.3. Investigational Product Storage  
SAGE -217 and matching placebo capsules are to be  stored at room temperature  (59°F to 86°F ; 
15°C to 30°C) , safely and separately from other drugs.  
10.4. Investigational Product Preparation  
Not applicable. 
10.5. Investigational Product Administration 
SAGE -217 is to be administered orally once daily at approximately 8 PM with fat-containing 
food (eg, within 1 hour of an evening meal which contains fat, or with a fat- containing snack).  
Examples of fat -containing snacks include nuts, peanut butter, avocado, eggs, and cheese.  
If a participant misse s a dose , the participant should skip that dose (ie,  they should not take the 
dose in the morning) and take the next scheduled dose in the evening the next day. 
10.6. Investigational Product Accountability , Handling, and Disposal  
Upon receipt of IP, the investigator (s), or the responsible pharmacist or designee, will inspect the 
IP and complete and follow the instructions regarding receipt and storage in the Investigator’s

43 The designated site staff will dispense the supplied participant -specific kits to participants at the 
planned dispensation visit intervals outlined in Table 2.  
Site staff will access the IRT at the Screening Visit to obtain a participant identification (ID) 
number for each participant that has signed an ICF . On Day 1, site staff will access the IRT and 
provide the necessary participant -identifying information, including the participant ID number 
assigned at screening, to randomize the eligible participant into the study and obtain the medication ID number for the IP to be dispensed to that participant. The medication ID number and the number of capsules dispensed must be recorded.  
At the subsequent IP-dispensing visit, the investigator or designee will access the IRT, providing the same participant ID number assigned a t Screening, to obtain the medication ID number for 
the IP to be dispensed at that visit. The medication ID number, the number of capsules 
dispensed, and the number of capsules returned by [CONTACT_893267].  
If dispensing erro rs or discrepancies are discovered by [CONTACT_135477]’s designee, the 
sponsor must be notified immediately.  
The IP provided is for use only as directed in this protocol. The investigator or designee must 
keep a record of all IP received, used and ret urned/discarded. It must be clear from the records 
which participant received which dose of active or placebo treatment. 
Sage Therapeutics will be permitted access to the study supplies at any time with appropriate 
notice during or after completion of the study to perform drug accountability reconciliation.  
The investigator, pharmacist, or qualified designee is responsible for drug accountability, 
reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie,  receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). 
At the en d of the study, any unused IP will be returned to Sage Therapeutics for destruction or 
destroyed locally per the site’s procedures; disposition of IP will be documented.  
10.7. Product Complaints  
A product complaint is any written, electronic, or verbal expression of dissatisfaction regarding 
the identity, quality, reliability, safety, purity, potency, effectiveness or performance (applicable 
for approved marketed products) of a drug product after it is released for distribution.  
In the course of conduct of the study, study personnel may become aware of a product complaint 
associated with the use of a Sage product. Personnel shall notify Sage within [ADDRESS_1250980] complaint until further instruction is provide d by [CONTACT_135489](s).

44 11. EFFICACY AND CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ASSESSMENTS  
11.1. Efficacy Assessments  
All assessments will be conducted according to the Sc hedule of Assessments ( Table 2) . Study 
assessments that involve participant  interviews, including the HAM- D and SCID-5- CT, may be 
audiotaped for independent quality control purposes. All assessments must be conducted by 
[CONTACT_871024].  
11.1.1. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM -D) 
The primary outcome measure is the change from baseline in 17 -item HAM -D total score at the 
end of the Treatment Period (Day 15). Eve ry effort should be made for the same rater to perform 
all HAM -D assessments for an individual participant. An assessment timeframe of past 7 days 
(1 week) will be used at Screening and ‘S ince L ast V isit’ will be used for all other visits . 
The 17- item HAM -D will be used to rate the severity of depression in participants  who are 
already diagnosed as depressed ( Williams 2013a; Williams 2013b ). The 17- item HAM -D 
comprises individual ratings related to the following symptoms: depressed mood (sadness, 
hopeless, helpless, worthless), feelings of guilt, suicide, insomnia (early, middle, late), work and 
activities, retardation (slowness of thought and speech; impaired ability to concentrate; decreased 
motor activity), agitation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and general), genital symptoms, hypochondriasis, loss of weight, and insight.  
The HAM -D total score will be calculated as the sum of the 17 individual item scores.  
In addition to the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in HAM -D total score, 
several secondary efficacy endpoints will be derived for the HAM -D. Hamilton Rating Scale for 
Depression subscale scores will be calculated as the sum of the items comprising each subscale. 
Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression response will be defined as having a 50% or greater 
reduction from baseline in HAM- D total score . Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression remission 
will be defined as having a HAM- D total score  ≤7.  
11.1.2. Montgomery-Å sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)  
The MADRS is a [ADDRESS_1250981] to the HAM- D that 
would be more sensitive to the changes brought on by [CONTACT_871038].  
Higher MADRS scores indicate more severe depression, and each item yields a score of 0 to 6. 
The overall score ranges from 0 to 60 ( Williams 2008).  
The MADRS total score will b e calculated as the sum of the 10 individual item scores.   
11.1.3. Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM -A) 
The 14- item HAM -A will be used to rate the severity of symptoms of anxiety (Williams  2013c; 
Williams  2013d) . Each of the 14 items is defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both 
psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical 
complaints related to anxiety). Scoring for HAM -A is calculated by [CONTACT_135480] 0 (not

48 12. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
12.1. Safety Parameters  
All assessments will be conducted according to the S chedule of Assessments ( Table 2).  
12.1.1. Demograph y and Medical History  
Demographic characteristics (age, race, gender, ethnicity , employment status , highest education 
level , marital/civil status ) and a full personal medical history , including:  generalized anxiety 
disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, post- traumatic stress disorder; bipolar 
disorder, persistent depressive disorder, postpartum depression, substance use disorder, alcohol 
use disorder, major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern, major depressive disorder with 
psychotic features, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, major depressive disorder with atypi[INVESTIGATOR_231395], schizophrenia, or schizoaffective disorder  will be documented. The delivery date of the 
index pregnancy and any other prior pregnancies with associated postpartum depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_893255].  In addition, postpartum depression epi[INVESTIGATOR_893256], including  siblings, parents, and grandparents will be documented.  
The diagnosis of [COMPANY_003]  will be determined using the SCID -5-CT. If available, the disease code 
associated with the diagnosis of [COMPANY_003]  based on the 10th revision of the International Statistical 
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD -10) should be recorded.  
12.1.2. Weight and Height  
Height (screening only) and weight will be measured and documented. BMI will be calculated and documented.  
12.1.3. Physical Examination  
Whenever possible, the same individual should perform all physical examinations. Physical 
examinations will include assessment of body systems (eg,  head, eye, ear, nose and throat; heart; 
lungs; abdomen; and extremities) as well as cognitive and neurological examination and mental status examination. An abbreviated physical exam ination  includes a brief medical history 
followed by a targeted physical exam ination . Unscheduled physical examinations may also be 
conducted per the i nvestigator’s discretion.  
Any abnormality in physical examinations will be interpreted by [CONTACT_127202], not clinically significant (NCS); or abnormal, clinically significant (CS) in source documents.  
12.1.4. COVID- 19 Questions  
Information regarding diagnosis, isolation, and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129687]-19 will be 
documented as part of medical history, AE collection, and prior/concomitant 
medication/procedure collection at screening and throughout the study. Questions to be asked are as follows:  
• Were you diagnosed with COVID- 19 by a healthcare professional?  
− If the answer is “no”, no further questions.  
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-[COMPANY_003]-301, Version [ADDRESS_1250983] medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death  
• Places the participant  at immediate risk of death (a life -threatening event); however, 
this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death   
• Requires in patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
An SAE may also be any other medically important eve nt that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_390514] 1 of the outcomes listed above (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency ro om or convulsions occurring at home that do not require an 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]). 
All SAEs that occur after any participant has signed the ICF and throughout the duration of the 
study, whether or not they are related to the study, must be recorded on the SAE report form 
provided by [CONTACT_135482]. Any SAE that is ongoing when the participant completes their 
final study visit, will be followed by [CONTACT_135483], stabilized, 
returned to baseline status, or until the participant dies or is lost to follow up . 
A prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely schedul ed treatment will not be considered an 
SAE, even if the participant is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. The site must document all of the following: 
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was 
scheduled (or on a waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the participant’s consent to participate in the study.  
• The condition requiring the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_85292] , between the participant’s consent to participate in the study and at the 
time of the procedure or treatment.  
12.2.3. Relationship to Investigational Product 
The investigator must make the determination of relationship to the IP for each adverse event 
(not related, related). The following definitions should be considered when evaluating the 
relationship of AEs and SAEs to the IP.  
Not Related  An AE will be considered “not related” to the use of the IP if there is not a reasonable 
possibility that the event has been caused by [CONTACT_33249]. Factors pointing towards this 
assessment include but are not limited to: the lack of temporal relationship between administration of the IP and the event, the presence of biologically implausible 
relationship between the product and the AE , or the presence of a more likely 
alternative explanation for the AE 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-[COMPANY_003]-301, Version 2 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
53 Related  An AE will be considered “related” to the use of the IP if there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_95107]. 
Factors that point towards this assessment include but are not limited to: a positive 
rechallenge, a reasonable temporal sequence between administration of the drug and 
the event, a known response pattern of the suspected drug, improvement following 
discontinuation or  dose reduction, a biologically plausible relationship between the 
drug and the AE, or a lack of alternative explanation for the AE  
12.2.4. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_4538]/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_7235]. The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when 
possible. For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), 
resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, outcome, and seriousness (if 
applicable), and whether or not it caused the participant to discontinue the IP or withdraw early 
from the study . 
Intensity will be assessed accor ding to the following scale: 
• Mild: symptom(s) barely noticeable to participant or does not make participant uncomfortable; does not influence performance or functioning; prescription drug not ordinarily needed for relief of symptom(s)  
• Moderate: symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to make participant uncomfortable; 
performance of daily activity is influenced; participant is able to continue in study; treatment for symptom(s) may be needed  
• Severe: symptom(s) cause severe discomfort; symptoms cause incapacitation or significant impact on participant’s daily life; severity may cause cessation of treatment with IP; treatment for symptom(s) may be given and/or participant 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_656615] . Severity is a m easure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_31468]  12.2.2. An AE of severe intensity 
may not necessarily be considered serious.  
12.2.5. Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
In order to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations for reporting an SAE(s), the study site 
must notify Sage or designee within 24 hours of the study site staff becoming aware of the 
SAE(s). The investigator must complete, sign and date the SAE report form, verify the accuracy 
of the information recorded on the SAE report form with the corresponding source documents, and send a copy to Sage or designee.  
Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should all be sent  to Sage or designee 
within 24 hours of receipt on a follow -up SAE report form and placed with the original SAE 
information and kept with the appropriate section of the e CRF and/ or study file.  
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-[COMPANY_003]-301, Version 2 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
54 Serious adverse events occurring after the designated follow -up time for the study, should be 
reported to Sage or designee according to the timelines noted above only if the investigator 
considers the SAE related to IP.   
Sage , or designee, is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain 
events. It is the principal investigator’s responsibility to notify the IRB/IEC of all SAEs that occur at his or her site . Investigators will also be notified of all suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions ( S[LOCATION_003]Rs ) that occur during the clinical study. IRBs/IECs  will be notified of 
SAEs and/or S[LOCATION_003]Rs as required by [CONTACT_1769].  
In addition, appropriate personnel in Sage  Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance or designee will 
unblind S[LOCATION_003]Rs for the purpose of regulatory reporting. Sage  or designee will submit S[LOCATION_003]Rs 
(in blinded or unblinded fashion) to regulatory agencies according to local law. Sage , or 
designee, will submit S[LOCATION_003]RS to investigator s in a blinded fashion. 
12.3. Pregnancy 
If a participant becomes pregnant after the first administration of IP, pregnancy information must be collected and recorded on the Pregnancy form and submitted to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_1250984] administration of IP or until the completion of the study whichever is longer. Any 
pregnancy occurring in that tim e frame will be followed until delivery or termination of the 
pregnancy.  
The participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The outcome of all 
pregnancies (eg, spontaneous abortion, elective abortion, normal birth) must be followed and documented even if the participant was discontinued from the study. The investigator will collect 
follow -up information on the participant and the neonate, and the information will be forwarded 
to Sage or designee. Generally, follow up will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks 
beyond the estimated delivery date. Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of 
fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or in dication for the procedure. 
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_656626] a contraceptive medication. Any complication during pregnancy (eg, anemia, infections, pre eclampsi a) should be reported as an AE/SAE. If the 
outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE 
(ie, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death), the investigator should follow the 
procedures for reporting an SAE.  
12.4. Overd ose 
Overdoses, regardless of presence of associated clinical manifestation(s) (eg,  headache, 
abnormal laboratory value) will be considered an AE and recorded as such on the eCRF. Any clinical manifestation(s) of overdose must also be recorded as an AE on the eCRF. In addition, all overdoses must be recorded on an Overdose form and sent to Sage or designee within 
24 hours of the site becoming aware of the overdose.

55 13. STATISTICS  
Detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study will be provided  in the 
statistical analysis plan (SAP). The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock. 
Any changes/additions to the SAP following database lock will be described in detail in the clinical study report.  
13.1. Data Analysis Sets  
The Randomized Set is defined as all participant s who are randomized. 
The Safety Set will include all participants administered IP.  
The Full Analysis Set will include all randomized participants who received any amount of IP 
and have a valid baseline and at least one valid  post baseline HAM -D total score.   
The Per Protocol Set is defined as all participants in the Full Analysis Set without any major 
protocol deviations that could affect efficacy. The review of major protocol deviations will be completed, and the decision on whether the deviation affects efficacy will be documented before 
database unblinding. 
13.2. Handling of Missing Data 
Every attempt will be made to avoid missing data. All participants will be used in the analyses, as per the analysis populations, usi ng all non missing  data available. No imputation process will 
be used to estimate missing data. A sensitivity analysis will be used to investigate the impact of 
missing data if ≥5% of participants  in any treatment group have missing data. 
13.3. General Considerations  
For the purpose of all primary and secondary analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as 
the last measurement prior to receipt of IP.  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with number (n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximu m. In addition, change from baseline values will be calculated at each 
time point and summarized descriptively. For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries will 
include counts and percentages.  
13.4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic data, such as age, race, and ethnicity, and baseline characteristics, such as height, weight, and BMI, will be summarized using the Safety Population.  
Pregnancy test results and drug screen results will be listed but not summarized.  Medical h istory will be listed by [CONTACT_3445].  
13.5. Efficacy Analysis  
The estimand for the primary efficacy analysis is defined as follows:  
1. The treatment regimen for participants is: placebo or SAGE -217 for 14 days. 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-[COMPANY_003]-301, Version 2 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
56 2. The target population is adult participant s with a d iagnosis with  severe [COMPANY_003]  (baseline 
HAM -D total score ≥26 ). 
3. The variable of interest is the change from baseline in HAM-D total score at Day 15. 
4. The population summary level deals with the difference between SAGE -217 and placebo 
treatments in mean change fr om baseline in HAM -D total score at Day 15.  
5. The intercurrent events could be: 
a. The premature discontinuation of treatment for any reaso n, thus not having a Day 15 
HAM -D total score available. This will be handled by a sensitivity analysis using 
multiple imp utation technique (details will be provided in the SAP ).  
b. Certain medications including, but not limited to, new antidepressants or 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_893257] 45 follow-up; however, the treatment policy strategy dictates that the results following these prohibited medication use  will not be manipulated,  but will ra ther be used ‘as is’ in 
analysis. Please note that th is protocol does not specify any rescue medicati on, hence 
there is no rescue medication  to be considered.  
Data  will be analyzed using a mixed -effects model for repeated measures (MMRM); the model 
will include treatment, baseline HAM -D total score, stratification factor, assessment time point, 
and time point-by- treatment as explanatory variables. All explanatory variables will be treated as 
fixed effects. All postbaseline time points will be included in the model. Model-based point 
estimates (ie, least squares means, 95%  confidence intervals, and p value s) will be reported 
where applicable. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within-
participant  errors. If there is a convergence issue with the unstructured covariance model, 
Toeplitz compound symmetry or Autoregressive (1) [AR(1)] covariance structure will be used, 
following this sequence until convergence is achieved. If the model still does not converge with 
AR(1) structure, no results will be reported. When the covariance structure is not UN, the 
sandwich estimator for the varia nce covariance matrix will be derived, using the EMPI[INVESTIGATOR_893258].   
Similar to those methods described above for the primary endpoint, an MMRM will be used for the analysis of the change from baseline in other time  points in HAM -D total score, MADRS 
total score, HAM -A total score, EPDS total score, PHQ -9 score, and selected individual items 
and/or subscale scores in HAM -D.  
Generalized estimating equation (GEE) methods will be used for the analysis of HAM -D 
response (defined as ≥50% reduction from baseline in HAM -D total score) and HAM- D 
remission (defined as HAM- D total score of ≤7.0). GEE models will include terms for treatment, 
baseline score, stratification factor, assessment time point, and time point-by- treatment as 
explanatory variables. The comparison of interest will be the difference between SAGE -217 and 
matching placebo at Day 15. Model- based point estimates (ie, odds ratios), 95% confidence 
intervals, and p value s will be reported.  
A GEE method will also be used for the analysis of CGI-I response (defined as “much 
improved” or “very much improved”) including terms for treatment, baseline CGI- S score, 
stratification factor, assessment time  point , and time  point-by- treatment as explanatory variables.  
Descriptive summary statistics will be provided for other endpoints .

217-[COMPANY_003]-301, Version [ADDRESS_1250985] ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/D OCUMENTS  
14.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a participant into the study, a representative of Sage 
Therapeutics will visit the investigational study site per Sage standard operating procedures to:  
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of Sage T herapeutics or its representatives. 
This will be documented in a Clinical Trial Agreement between Sage Therapeutics and 
the investigator.  
During the study, a monitor from Sage Therapeutics or representative will have regular contacts 
with the investigational site, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s)  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the case report forms, and that IP accountability checks are being 
performed  
• Perform source data verification . This includes a comparison of the data in the case report 
forms with the participant’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other records 
relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original records for each 
participant  (eg, clinic charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Sage Therapeutics. 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs and confirm any SAEs have been forwarded to Sage Therapeutics and those SAEs that met criteria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB or IEC . 
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice.  
14.2. Audits and Inspections  
Sage Therapeutics or authorized representatives of Sage Therapeutics, a regulatory authority, or an IEC  or an IRB may visit the site to perform an audit(s) or inspection(s), including source data 
verification . The purpose of a Sage Therapeutics audit or a regulatory authority inspection is to 
systematically and independently examine all study- related activities and documents to 
determine whether these activities were cond ucted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and 
accurately reported according to the protocol, GCP/ICH GCP guidelines , and any applicable 
regulatory requirements . The investigator should contact [CONTACT_221935] a regulatory agency or IRB/ IEC about an inspection.

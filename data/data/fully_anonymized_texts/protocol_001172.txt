10/10/[ADDRESS_201840]  
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health problem.  African Americans have a 
higher prevalence of late stage CKD than Whites and progress from early stage to late stage at 
a much more rapid rate.  Biomedical explanations for African Americans’  faster CKD 
progression prevail, with virtually no research attention paid to the role of social factors.  Stress related to discrimination is a particularly compelling area of study in light of strong evidence demonstrating its linkages to CKD risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. The 
proposed proof of concept study will recruit 100 African American patients (both with and without diagnosed CKD) to determine whether discriminatory stressors are an important risk 
factor for CKD -related physiological processes and kidney functioning.  
The long- term goal  of this research program is to understand the impact of and pathways 
through which discriminatory stress contributes to CKD progression. The overall objective of this 
R21 application, which is the first step towards attainment of this long- term goal, is to obtain 
effect sizes for a larger prospective R01 and explore two hypothesized pathways (i.e., blood pressure reactivity and pathophysiological mechanisms) using a multi -method research desi gn.  
This study will carry out the following specific aims :   
 
1. To examine associations between chronic stressors (i.e., discriminatory versus 
general), pathophysiological mechanisms (i.e., elevated inflammation and nocturnal 
blood pressure), and poor kidney functioning  among [ADDRESS_201841] of acute stressors (i.e., discriminatory versus general) on short-term changes in CKD-related physiological processes (i.e., increases in 
inflammatory markers and blood pressure reactivity) in patients from aim 1.  
a. Based on an experimental research design, we hypothesize that discriminatory stressors will be more physiologically impactful than general stressors.  Outcomes include several 
critical CKD- related inflammatory biomarkers and blood pressure reactivity assessed at 
three time points during the experimental manipulation.  
Collectively, these outcomes are expected to support the advancement of science- based 
information about CKD that can be disseminated in order to improve health and quality  of life.  
 
 
  
 
  
 
10/10/[ADDRESS_201842] commonly caused by [CONTACT_37110], 
hypertension, and glomerulonephritis.3  The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative of the 
National Kidney Foundation established a classification system for determining CKD severity by 
[CONTACT_172089]4 (see Appendix 1).  
Based on this staging system, national prevalence data indicate dramatic increases in end 
stage renal disease ( ESRD ) from [ADDRESS_201843]:  African Americans have an ESRD prevalence that is almost four times that of Whites (5,671 vs. 1,432 per million population) and progress from early 
stage to late stage at a much more rapid rate.
5-[ADDRESS_201844] Will Improve Scientific Knowledge of the Role of Social Stress in CKD  
Scientific research to date has focused on genetic and biological explanations for African 
Americans’ greater prevalence of ESRD than Whites.  For example, African Americans have higher rates of diagnoses for the two leading causes of CKD (type II diabetes
8 and 
hypertension9) as well as other dietary and lifestyle factors that contribute to the progression of 
CKD.[ADDRESS_201845] and socio- economic factors (including income and access 
to care) also explain part of the racial disparities in CKD progression.11-[ADDRESS_201846] remain.12,14,15 Indeed, the growing 
literature on socioeconomic status ( SES) is a platform to launch a conversation of the role of the 
social determinants of CKD progression,[ADDRESS_201847], and neighborhood conditions to understand CKD outcomes.  A recent heuristic 
model developed by [CONTACT_172090].19 seeks to integrate the socio- cultural factors hypothesized by 
[CONTACT_172091]10 and Norris and Nissenson14 (e.g., stress, the social environment) with 
genetic, behavioral, and psychological factors and pathophysiological mechanisms to explain 
kidney outcomes.  The Bruce et al.19 model focuses on stress.  It argues for strong influences of 
social environment and psychological factors on stress, which in turn relates to behavioral factors and pathophysiological mechanisms (such as inflammatory cytokines
20), which then 
contribute to CKD risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, and obesity), and ultimately kidney 
outcomes. (Note that whereas the original Bruce et al. model includes blood pressure as a CKD 
risk factor, because blood pressure is reactive to stress we study it as a pathophysiological 
mechanism and leave diabetes and obesity as the key risk factors.)  A strength of this model is 
that there is a large body of knowledge using rigorous research designs establishing certain critical pathways in other populations (e.g., research linking discriminatory stress to 
hypertension and obesity in healthy cohorts). 
21-24  However, a major weakness is that the field 
has yet to embark upon empi[INVESTIGATOR_172069] (e.g., research linking stress to kidney outcomes via the pathophysiological mechanisms proposed in this project) with few exceptions.
25 
10/10/[ADDRESS_201848] on CKD outcomes and/or physiological processes and design psychological interventions with these stressors in mind.  In this respect, experiences of racism and other 
social stressors are  comparable to other forms of chronic (job strain, caregiving) or 
uncontrollable (breast cancer, loss, trauma) stress for which psychosocial treatments have been 
established.  Current interventions to delay progression of CKD focus primarily on nutrition, 
lifestyle, and medical management of blood pressure and glucose and albuminuria.  The 
proposed project establishes the need to determine whether stress reduction might also be an important target for future intervention.  
 
II. Goals/Aims:  
This proof of concept study will recruit a sample of 100 African American patients, 80 with 
diagnosed CKD with equal numbers across stages 2, 3A, 3B, and 4  and 20 with no CKD 
diagnosis, to determine whether discriminatory stressors are an important risk factor  for CKD -
related physiological processes and kidney functioning in this understudied population (see 
Table 1) .  
Drawing from a recent heuristic model by 
[CONTACT_172090].,
19 it is 
theorized that the 
relationship between 
stress related to 
discrimination and 
kidney outcomes is mediated by 
[CONTACT_172092].  
Further, because discriminatory 
stressors often co- occur with other chronic stressors (e.g., financial stress, occupational stress, 
relationship stress, and parental stress) in African Americans, we will also determine whether 
discriminatory stressors are independent of these other types of stress.  The long-term goal  of 
this research program is to understand the impact of and pathways through which discriminatory stress contributes to CKD progression. The overall objective of this R21 research project , which 
is the first step towards attainment of this long -term goal, is to obtain effect sizes for a larger 
prospective R01 and explore two of the pathways hypothesized by [CONTACT_172090]. (i.e., blood pressure reactivity and pathophysiological mechanisms) using a multi- method research design 
(i.e., both observational and experimental research methods).  The central hypothesis  of this 
study is that discriminatory stress is associated with poor kidney functioning and two potential 
mechanisms leading to poor kidney functioning -- increased inflammation and blood pres sure 
dysregulation--  among African Americans with CKD. Using a multi- method design, we plan to 
objectively test our central hypothesis by [CONTACT_172093] :   
Objective 1. To examine associations between chronic stressors (i.e., discriminatory versus 
general), pathophysiological mechanisms (i.e., elevated inflammation and nocturnal blood Table 1. Stages of CKD

A. Organizational Structure  
This study is funded by [CONTACT_7681] (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and 
Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), and was developed by [CONTACT_172094].  An internal medicine clinic within Emory University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_79452] ( at which 
Co-Investigator [CONTACT_172118] currently serves as a practicing nephrologist ) and the Georgia 
Clinical and Translational Science Alliance (GCTSA)  (for which [CONTACT_132381] R. Ziegler serves as 
Co-Director) will serve as study sites . Additionally, study participants’ bio- specimens will be 
analyzed at the Molecular Neuroimmunology Laboratory in the Department of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_172070]. Bradley Pearce, PhD, who also serves as a Co- Investigator on this project, will oversee 
analyses of select blood samples.  Outside laboratory resources  will be used for processing and 
analyses of the remaini ng biospecimens.   
B. Setting and location 
This study will take place in Atlanta, GA, within a region characterized by [CONTACT_172095].[ADDRESS_201849]. Janice Lea (C o-investigator) practices. This clinic serves patients along the CKD 
continuum as well as those with no CKD diagnosis. The five physicians in this clinic see approximately 150 African American patients per week demonstrating the feasibility of recruiting 
100 patients in eight months. Our prior experience conducting clinical studies suggests t he 
importance of educating clinic staff about the study so that they can assuage patient concerns 
about participation.  However, their involvement in the recruitment process is minimal, is not 
coercive, and does not undermine the voluntary nature of study participation.   
C. 
Population to be studied  
Inclusion criteria are as follows:  
• Patient at Emory University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_79452]  
• Self-identify as African American or Black  
• Age 25 to 65  
• eGFR ≥ 15, or <90 
Exclusion criteria are as follows:  
• Mental disorder that prevents the completion of the Computer Assisted Personal 
Interview (CAPI) and the stressful recall manipulation 
• Currently on maintenance dialysis  
• Unable or unwilling to undergo intravenous catheterization 
 
 
D. Recruitment  
Study participants will be [ADDRESS_201850] coordinator , who will 
mail potential  participants  a letter inviting them to participat e (see attached  for sample letter ). 
The letter  will outline information about the study (including purpose and participant 
requirements) , and interested participants will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_172096] 
10/10/2018 , 8 
 learn more about the study. If he/she is interested in participating, he/she will have the 
opportunity to review specific participation requirements at their next appointment,  or upon next 
visit to the clinic. Participants will provide consent and be enrolled in person.  The second tier of 
participant recruitment will consist of the project coordinator using the potential participant list to 
call individuals who are patients in the clinic and potentially eligible for the study, and inform 
them about the opportunity to participate in the study . Those individuals who are interested in 
participating will have an opportunity to review specific participation requirements at their next 
appointment,  or upon visiting the clinic,  and will provide consent and be enrolled in person.  
Next, the project coordinator  will provide clinic staff with a re cruitment postcard (see attached 
example) which will be included in potential participant ’s exit material after their doctor’s  visit. 
The postcard provides study information, and instructs patients to contact [CONTACT_172097].  Finally, study recruitment flyers will be 
placed throughout the clinic  (see attached for flyer example)  and remain in the clinic until the 
conclusion of the study . The flyer provides preliminary information about the study, and instructs 
patients who may be interested in participating to call or email the project coordinator for more information. The project coordinator will provide further information about the study; those 
individuals who are interested in participating will  have an opportunity to provide consent and be 
enrolled in person at their next appointment time.  We will continue this quota sampling and 
recruitment process until we have enrolled 20 participants in each of the five categories:  no CKD diagnosis and CKD diagnosis stage 2, 3A, 3B, and 4.   
Study enrollment will occur in person within the clinic. T he previously mailed letter, phone call  
and posted flyers will serve as an initial introduction to the study. Upon study enrollment, we will 
work with clinic staff to verify stage of CKD diagnosis (where applicable) to ensure that we are achieving the desired quotas.  We will continue recruitment until the desired sample is achieved.  
 
E. 
Field Methods  
 
Data Collection Overview  
Study participation entails completion of a computer administered personal interview (CAPI) that 
assesses experiences of general and discriminatory stress, behavioral and socio- economic 
variables, and other psychological characteristics.  Upon completion of the CAPI, participants 
would be scheduled to attend a second session.  During this session the experimental 
manipulation entails them being asked to recall a general or discriminatory stressor  (the 
participant  is randomized to one of the two groups ), while changes in blood pressure and 
inflammatory processes are monitored. Finally, participants provide blood pressure assessments over a 24 -hour period using an ambulatory blood pressure monitor (ABPM). 
These methods are described below.
 
Data Collection P rocedures 
Day 1:  Consent, CAPI [INVESTIGATOR_1238] 24-hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor  (ABPM) 
Day [ADDRESS_201851] and manage CAPI -questionnaire data. The key advantages of this 
method include allowing the interviewer to answer respondent questions, probe for adequate  
10/10/2018 , 9 
 answers, and accurately follow complex instructions or skip patterns.31 The survey will assess 
participants’  experiences of general and discriminatory stress, behavioral and socio- economic 
variables, and other psychological characteristics. Participants will be paid a portion of the 
monetary incentive ($50) at the conclusion of the survey interview . The proposed CAPI -
questionnaire is attached.   
Prior to leaving the study site, the project coordinator will fit each participant with an A BPM , and 
provide detailed instructions on how to use and care for the device, (including removing the 
device for showering). Participants will also receive a handout of these instructions for  reference 
at home ( see attached). Participa nts will be asked to wear the A BPM for 24- hours, beginning 
the time they leave the clinic . Participants will return  the ABPM  the following morning between 
9:00AM and 12:[ADDRESS_201852]. Lewis (Co -
Investigator) has used this approach in a recently completed pi[INVESTIGATOR_172071]. Her prior experience demonstrates good compliance with adequate data readings and 
the return of the equipment . Blood pressure readings will be taken at 30 minute intervals, except 
between the hours of 10:00PM and 8:00AM when they are taken at 60 minute intervals. All 
blood pressure readings between 10:00PM and 8:00AM will be considered nocturnal blood 
pressure. In addition, participants will be asked to record an anticipated time they fell asleep, 
and the time they  were awake the following morning using a diary  (see attached) . These data 
will be used for further analyses of daytime and nocturnal blood pressure readings. Participants 
will be expected to return the ABPM on Day [ADDRESS_201853] appointment program.  
Blood pressure readings  captured during participants’ 24- hour ABPM wear period will be 
reviewed once participants return the device. We anticipate these blood pressure readings  to be 
beneficial knowledge to participants and their overall health plan, and as a result will 
retrospectively provide these readings to participants and their physician, as appropriate. The 
project coordinator will review all blood pressure readings upon return of the device, and relay all readings to [CONTACT_172119] (Co- Investigator and nephrologist)  for review. Potentially concerning 
readings (>170/110 mm Hg) will be flagged for immediate review, and [CONTACT_172119] will contact 
[CONTACT_172098], as determined by [CONTACT_172099].  Participants with 
healthy / normal blood pressure readings  may also benefit from this information, and as a result, 
will be notified of these numbers via mail from [CONTACT_172119] along with information about what the readings mean for their health. All participants will have the 24-hour blood pressure readings 
incorporated into their personal health records; nephrology clinic staff will be responsible for integrating these numbers into participants’ electronic health records within the nephrology 
clinic. Practices for reporting blood pressure readings will be outlined in the participant consent 
form (see attached).  
Day 2:  Experimental manipulation & ABPM return  
Day [ADDRESS_201854] at the Georgia Clinical and Translational Science 
Alliance (Georgia CTSA) , Emory University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172072] a room with a door  (see attached). All Day 2 data collection 
appointments will be scheduled between the hour s of 9:00 AM and 11:[ADDRESS_201855] coordinator.  
Prior to initiating data collection on Day 2, study staff will retrieve a History & P hysical (H&P)  
form from the participant’s Emory physician. The H&P form is an official record of a physical from a physician, and must have been obtained within the past 30 days  to confirm that patients 
are fit to participate in the study . Study staff will  upload the H&P form into the CR-assist 
appointment system for easy retrieval at the participant’s next visit. Participants will be 
10/10/[ADDRESS_201856] of current medications and to indicate any medical conditions on a 
patient history form (see attached). W e will document these medications  and any reported 
medical conditions (in addition to any reported conditions on participants’ medical charts) , and 
control for them in analyses.  
Participants will first provide height and weight measurements, a urine sample, and baseline 
blood pressure testing.  A research nurse will  insert an intravenous catheter, and take an initial 
blood draw (up to 4 mL to measure A1C and up to 4 mL to measure creatinine) and allow f or a 
30-minute habituation period so that the participant adapts to the indwelling catheter. Once the 
participant has adapted, participants will be asked to rate their level of distress using the 
Subjective Units of Distress Scale32 (SUDS). Participants will be asked to rate their level of 
distress on a linear scale of [ADDRESS_201857]. The nurse will take a blood 
draw  (up to 6mL to measure inflammatory biomarkers and up to 4mL to measure eGFR ).  
 
 
 
 
Next, participants will undergo a moderate psychological stress adapted from the commonly 
used Trier Social Stress Test (TSST)33. The TSST protocol has been adapted for use in 
recalling race- related experiences34 underscoring its appropriateness for our protocol. [CONTACT_172120] (Co-Investigator) and colleagues , have  also used a similar experimental protocol and 
will provide related expertise for this project .35,36 Participants will be asked to recount one real -
life stressful situations ; one event will be a stressful race-related event and one event will be a 
stressful event that is not race -related. We will randomize participants such that half will recall 
the racial experience and half will recall the non -racialized stressful event. Each participant will 
have an equal chance of being placed in the racialized or non -racialized experience group. The 
Project Coordinator will provide instructions using a script. Participants will be given two minutes 
to prepare their statement , and three minutes to deliver the statement. There will be an 
‘audience’ present at each participant’s speaking task. Aligning with previously conducted 
involving audiences33,35 -38, each audience will include two observers  who are of  same race as 
the participant (African American) , to heighten stress responses . Observers will wear white 
coats, and will be trained on the study protocol such that their behaviors are identical for each 
Figure 2.  Day 2 Data Collection, Experimental 
Manipulation  
10/10/[ADDRESS_201858] coordinator will also remain in the room while participants recall  each 
designated stressful experience. Blood pressure readings will be taken every 1 minute during the participant’s preparation time and the actual recall task. The participant will be expected to 
use the entire three minutes for recall in each exercise; the project coordinator will cue the 
participant to continue until the 3 -minute mark via standardized prompts from a script . 
Participants will be asked to rate their level of distress caused by [CONTACT_172100]’s racism recall scale.
34 and again rate their level of distress on a 
linear scale (0 to 100) using the SUDS32. Participants will undergo a 45-minute recovery period 
after the first recall task; blood pressure readings will be taken every [ADDRESS_201859] 
blood draw (6 mL) . Participants will undergo another 45 -minutes of recovery, and provide and 
one final blood draw (6 mL) at the conclusion of the recovery period.  
Over the course of the study, participants will provide [ADDRESS_201860] 
coordinator will debrief participants on the purpose of the experimental manipulation and common reactions to it. Participants will also be debriefed on the entire experimental manipulation experience, including the audience’s  purpose . Particip ants will be paid $150 at the 
conclusion of Day 2 ($50 for return of ABPM and $100 for completion of experimental 
manipulation). The experimental protocol along with data time points are outlined in Figure 2.   
 Data Sources  
Participants will be asked to provide data from the following  sources:  
• Cross-sectional survey  data that are provided by [CONTACT_172101]  (see attached)  
• Medical chart data , used only to verify their last eGFR in order to achieve equal 
numbers of participants by [CONTACT_172102]/CKD diagnosis   
• Biological data  in the form of blood and urine in order to assess kidney functioning and 
inflammation  
• Biological data  in the form of height, weight, and blood pressure to assess standard 
control variables (i.e., Body Mass  Index) and blood pressure reactivity

Research Instruments  and Assessment  
 
i. Chronic General Stress .  The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)  assesses different areas 
of life stress (e.g., overall stress, financial stress, occupational stress, significant other 
stress, parental stress, and stress within friendships). Moreover, the PSS has 
documented validity and reliability, and is short (14 items) and easy to administer.43 A 
total score  is derived by [CONTACT_172103], with higher scores indicating 
greater perceived stress. The Financial Adjustments  and Can’t Make Ends Meet  scales 
by [CONTACT_172104] 44-46 will be used to measure financial strain and stressful financial 
events. 45-47 The Can’t Make Ends Meet scale assesses the overall feeling that financial 
resources are insufficient (e.g. “During the last [ADDRESS_201861] you 
had paying your bills?”); while the other scale captures adjustments made due to 
inadequate finances (e.g. “postponed medical or dental care to save money”) . Ongoing 
stressful life events were measured using the Chronic Burden scale by [CONTACT_172105]48.  
 
ii. Chronic Discriminatory Stress .  Based on recent recommendations,49 we plan to 
assess discrimination comprehensively, via multiple measures.  Exposure to “everyday” 
forms of discrimination  will be assessed with the Detroit Area Study (DAS) Everyday 
Discrimination Scale  50, adapted by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Lewis and colleagues.  This scale asks 
participants to indicate the frequency with which they experienced various forms of interpersonal mistreatment in their day -to-day lives over the previous 12 months .  A 
single attribution item assesses the main reason for these experiences.
51 The Major 
Experiences of Discrimination scale and Vicarious Exposure to Discrimination using 
modifications made in prior studies 52,53 measures experiences of unfair treatment over 
the lifespan in domains such as employment, police interactions, housing, and healthcare. Additional attribution items assess the reasons for these experiences (e.g., 
race/ethnicity, gender, education).
51  
 
iii. Inflammatory Markers. The inflammatory markers were selected based on our own 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602], their sensitivity to acute stress induction 54,55 and strong associations with 
CKD. 26,56 The initial measure of inflammation will be based on the baseline blood draw. 
Plasma samples will be stored in -80oC until used for analysis in duplicate. To quantitate 
levels of IL- 6 and MCP -1, we will employ the MesoScale system (M SD Rockville, 
Maryland) according to the protocols supplied by [CONTACT_3455], which includes 
generation of a 6- [ADDRESS_201862] curve with standards validated by [CONTACT_7904]. The 
MSD system uses electrochemiluminescence for high sensitivity with a dynamic range of 
0.06– 488 pg/mL for IL- 6, and 0.09–375 pg/mL for MCP -1. For suPAR we will use the 
Virogates (CEDARLANE Laboratories, Burlington, NC) suPARnostic® ELISA according 
10/10/2018 , 13 
 to the protocols supplied by [CONTACT_3455]. This assay has a high sensitivity (0.1 
ng/mL) giving consistently quantitative results in plasma samples. 
 
iv. Autonomic Arousal. Ambulatory Blood Pressure (ABP) will be assessed over 24 hours, 
using the SpaceLabs model [ZIP_CODE] (Issaquah, WA), a small, noninvasive device.[ADDRESS_201863] systolic (SBP) and diastolic 
blood pressure (DBP) every [ADDRESS_201864] actual sleep and wake times, and any medications taken.  Following the ABP assessments, BP readings will be 
screened, and values that are ±[ADDRESS_201865] deviations from the participant’s individual mean will be deleted.  Remaining valid values will be used to compute average daytime 
and nighttime SBP and DBP for each patient.  Note:   Because nocturnal BP is believed 
to be the most deleterious for later outcomes,
58 our aims do not include BP dippi[INVESTIGATOR_25415] a 
primary outcome; however, BP dippi[INVESTIGATOR_172073], as detailed in Gallo et al.59   
 
v. Kidney Functioning .  We will use eGFR to measure kidney function using the 
abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study equation as is 
recommended.41,42  Thus, we will measure serum creatinine from a baseline blood draw .  
Along with age, gender, and race, this information will be used in an online GFR 
calculator that is made available by [CONTACT_172106].  At 
baseline, participants will provide a urine specimen so that we can determine the 
protein/creatinine ratio.42 
 
vi. Covariates . Covariates to be assessed include behavioral factors (e.g., smoki ng, 
alcohol use, unhealthy diet, physical activity), socio- economic factors (e.g., health 
insurance status, income, and education), psychosocial factors (e.g., depression, quality of life), comorbidities (e.g., health conditions, medications, blood glucose  control 
measured via HbA1C, and ApoL1 status), and demographics such as age, sex, and body mass index.  Depressive symptoms will be assessed with the Beck Depression 
Inventory (BDI),[ADDRESS_201866] 
period, patients will asked to recall a personally relevant stressor, involving a general or 
racism- related stressful experience. Participants will be randomized into one of the two 
recall groups.. In the general stress protocol, participants will be asked to give a detailed account of a stressful experience (non -racial in nature) in which they felt so upset, angry, 
or annoyed at the time that talking about it during the clinic visit might still be upsetting to 
them.  In the racism recall protocol, patients will be asked to provide a detailed account 
of a stressful experience involving racism -- one where they were so 
upset/angry/annoyed at the time that talking about it during their visit might still be upsetting to them.  In both scenarios, patients will be asked to visualize the  situation and 
recall the details of what happened, including: 1) where they were; 2) who else was 
there; 3) what was said and done (by [CONTACT_172107] 
10/10/2018 , 14 
 at that time; 4) how they felt at the time and 5) the most stressful/upsetting aspect of the 
experience.  Patients will be given [ADDRESS_201867]. Participants will also be asked 
to assess their level of stress directly related to reliving the stressful experience using an 
adapted version of Cooper’s Racism Recall scale34.Patients will rate their level of 
distress at the time of the event, and currently while thinking about the event on a linear scale of [ADDRESS_201868].  
 
viii. Inflammatory and Blood Pressure Reactivity. Levels of inflammation will be 
measured at three time points during the experimental m anipulation (immediately before 
the experimental manipulation, 45 minutes after the manipulation and 90 minutes after 
the manipulation) as shown in Figure 2.  A description of the inflammatory markers is 
provided above under “Aim 1 Assessments”.  Systolic and Diastolic blood pressure will 
be assessed every [ADDRESS_201869], recall task, and recovery will be calculated by [CONTACT_172108].  Blood pressure reactivity will be a change (or delta) 
score, calculated as the mean of the scores during the recall task minus the mean of the 
scores during rest, designed to represent the change in blood pressure induced by [CONTACT_172109].  
Overall Time Burden  
Study participation occurs over the course of 2 days (Day 1=consent , CAPI  [INVESTIGATOR_1238] 24- hour 
Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor (ABPM) ; Day 2= experimental manipulation and ABPM 
return) . Those who agree to participate in the study will be consented at the clinic and asked to 
complete the self-administered survey with responses entered into an iPad (approximately 1 
hour). At the conclusion of Day 1, participants will be fitted to wear ABPM assessing their blood 
pressure  over 24 -hours and asked to return the device to the study site upon return for Day 2 of 
data collection. In the second session, participants will provide a urine sample and undergo 
baseline blood pressure testing.  A research nurse will insert an intravenous catheter (allowing 
for a 30 -minute habituation period so that the participant adapts to the indwelling catheter) and 
take a baseline blood draw. Participants will also be asked to recall a racial or non-racialized 
upsetting experience  (approximately 3 hours ). In total, participant time burden is approximately 
4.[ADDRESS_201870] been centrifuged, the plasma, serum and buffy coat will be aliquoted and stored at -80
oC. 
The sample ID will be barcoded and this barcode and sample ID will be used to label stored 
10/10/2018 , 15 
 aliquots.   If any samples remain after analysis, they may be stored under the control of the 
Kimberly Arriola, PhD (PI) and Brad Pearce, PhD (Co- Investigator).  
 The samples will be stored for as long as they are useful, unless the participant asks us to 
destroy their sample sooner. If a participant chooses to have his/her  sample material destroyed, 
he/she can do so by [CONTACT_55175]. Kimberly Jacob Arriola, who will provide [CONTACT_172121] with the 
required study and subject numbers. Any remaining blood samples will be located and 
destroyed. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_172074].  The samples will not be distributed to anyone outside the immediate study team 
without express approval from IRB.   
 
F. Informed Consent Process  
The consent process will be conduct ed in -person by [CONTACT_5984], in a private location near 
the waiting room in order to maximize convenience and privacy for the participant. An IRB -
approved written informed consent will be obtained from each participant at entry into the study; 
elements  of informed consent will include: (a) participant reviews the study consent form; (b) 
investigator(s) or study staff review the consent with participants to confirm understanding and answer any pending questions; and (c) participant signs the consent form  once the 
investigator(s) or study staff are convinced that the protocol is understood. Key elements of the consent form describe the voluntary nature of study participation, clarification that the decision to join or not join the research study will not affect the participant’s status as a patient, and that 
participants are free to withdraw at any point in time.  The consent form includes a standard 
HIPAA Authorization document as well.  After signing the consent form, participants will be 
given a hard copy of the form for their own records. Please see the attached consent form for 
details.  
 
 
IV. Potential Risks/Discomforts to Study Participants and measures to prevent 
occurrence  
 
Possible risks are related to : 
1. CAPI:  [INVESTIGATOR_172075]’ lives may cause them to have unpleasant and/or upsetting feelings.  
2. Intravenous catheter:  This can result in infection, bruising of the skin, or a blood clot in the vein. Participants may have some discomfort from the blood drawing.  The risk from blood 
drawing is minimal, but may include bruising and infection.  
3. Experimental manipulation:  Recalling an upsetting experience may be unpleasant.  
4. Blood pressure monitoring:  Wearing the ABPM throughout the day and night may be 
inconvenient for participants, and some people may experience sleep disturbance while 
wearing the device at night.  Some individuals might also experience some bruising where the cuff is located.  
 
V. Benefits  
Participants may not derive personal benefit from their involvement in this study. However, 
participants may find some of the information they receive from this study helpful. For example, 
participants will receive a detailed report of their nocturnal blood pressure after wearing the 
ABPM device. Participants with healthy reports may use this information to continue healthy 
practices, and participants with concerning reports may use this information to seek professional 
10/10/2018 , 16 
 counsel on how to improve blood pressure readings. Additionally, w hat we (the research team) 
learn from this study will inform the development of a program of research that generates new 
understanding of the role of social stress on chronic kidney disease progression.   
 
VI. Compensation for time and effort : 
Participants will be offered a $200  monetary incentive for completing the study  all steps of the 
study . Study participation occurs over the course of 2 days. Participants will receive $50 for 
completing the CAPI; $50 for return of the ABPM and $100 for completing the experimental 
manipulation.  If participants return on Day 2 without the ABPM, the $50 incentive for its return 
will be withheld until the equipment  is returned. This methodology addresses concerns about 
participant fatigue by [CONTACT_172110].  
 
 
VII. Data Analysis: Data Management and Monitoring:  
We will minimize the risk of loss of confidentiality by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_172076] a 
locked file cabinet; soft copy files will be on a password- protected secure network drive.  The file 
that contains the crosswalk between participant identification codes and their names (allowing 
us to ensure that samples are properly matched with each other and with the questionnaire 
data) will be password protected, also on a password protected secure network drive, in order to 
prevent theft or loss of data. All survey data will be retrieved and stored using REDcap software, 
which is HIPAA -compliant.  
VIII. Plans for analysis, statistical and/or otherwise: 
 
The study team will conduct data analyses within offices of the Department of Behavioral 
Sciences and Health education at Emory University. All data will remain de -identified during 
data analyses to protect participants’ identities.  
  
A. Exploratory Analyses  
We will start by [CONTACT_40397] a data set that merges the survey data will all biometric data. 
Traditional data entry for the survey data will be unnecessary as data will be imported directly into SPSS from the REDCap software that houses the CAPI -questionnaire . Data will be 
cleaned, coded, and examined for any missing data or unlikely values. We will examine frequency distributions for all variables, with particular attention to variable ranges, missing 
values, and transforming variables as needed, depending on evidence of internal consistency 
within scales. Next, we will conduct exploratory analyses to determine whether participants with 
the different sequences (i.e. race- related recall first or second)  differ on demographic, clinical, or 
behavioral variables. Specifically, we will use logistic models to regress recall sequence on all 
relevant variables. If significant differences are identified, we will conduct further analyses by [CONTACT_172111].  
 
B. Main Outcome Analyses  
These analyses are driven by [CONTACT_172112]: (1) Chronic discriminatory stressors will be associated with poor kidney functioning independent of other chronic stressors 
10/10/2018 , 17 
 as mediated by [CONTACT_9289] -related inflammatory biomarkers and autonomic arousal; (2) 
Discriminatory stressors will be more physiologically impactful than general stressors on critical 
CKD- related inflammatory biomarkers and blood pressure reactivity.  
 The first hypothesis is a meditational hypothesis.  We recognize that Baron and Kenny

the indirect effect of chronic discriminatory stress (controlling for general stress) on each of the two kidney outcomes (eGFR and proteinuria) through the inflammatory pathway as measured 
by [CONTACT_172113] ( MCP -1, IL-6, suPAR).  Bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_172077].
68  These analyses will control for relevant covariates.  Next we will classify the 
type of mediation using the Zhao et al typology (complementary, competitive, indirect only, direct only, or non -mediation), and proceed with interpreting the findings in light of our 
hypotheses.  We will consider using structural equation modeling as another technique recommended to test mediation.

of stress recall (race- related or not)  (discriminatory stress vs. general stress) and data collection

biomarker and blood pressure), also controlling for the relevant covariates.  This test provides a 
form of economy by [CONTACT_172114] a time, while also allowing us to study the interaction between study condition and time.

 at N=100. For aim 2, collecting data at 
multiple time points is one way to maximize power.  If we just consider the two study groups 
(intervention and control) we would achieve power of .[ADDRESS_201874] (.25) at

IX. Training of study team 
 
All research staff maintains a current CITI, (Group 3 Social/Behavioral) certification. Proof of 
certifications has been uploaded for further review.  Corresponding study team members 
(including members of the Georgia CTSA team and nurses within the E mory University 
Healthcare Nephrology clinic) will undergo study -specific training.  
 
X. Plans for monitoring the study for safety  
 
10/10/2018 , 18 
 The Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) outlined below will adhere to the protocol 
approved by [CONTACT_172115]. An IRB- approved written informed consent will be obtained from 
each participant at entry into the study; elements of informed consent will include: (a) having the participant review the study consent form; (b) having the investigator(s) or study staff meet with 
the participant to review the consent, confirm understanding, and answer any questions; and (c) 
once the investigator(s) or study staff are convinced that the protocol is understood and that there is agreement to participate, having the consent signed. The principal investigator (PI) will 
review all data collection documents weekly for completeness and accuracy of the data as well 
as protocol compliance. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_172078] a continuing basis for participant 
safety and include the results of the review in annual progress reports submitted to the IRB and 
the NIH.  
Patient Monitoring will be performed by [CONTACT_941] P.I., Co-Investi gators, the Project Coordinator and 
medical staff present during the experimental manipulation. Also, H&P is required per the GCTSA protocol.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_172079]- Inducing Experimental Manipulation  
Absolute Indications for Termination  
• Drop in systolic blood pressure >10 mm Hg (persistently below baseline).  
• Technical difficulties monitoring blood pressure.   
Relative Indications for Termination    
• Increasing chest pain.   
• Participant becomes excessively anxious, uncomfortable, or requests to stop.  
• Fatigue, shortness of breath, wheezing, leg cramps, or claudication.   
• Hypertensive response (systolic blood pressure >200 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure 
>92 mm  Hg).  
Patient reporting rules for blood pressure  
[CONTACT_172119] (Co -Investigator and nephrologist) will review all participants’ blood pressure readings  
from the 24 -hour ABPM task. Participants with healthy / normal blood pressure readings 
(readings ≤ 170/110 mm Hg) will be notified of these numbers via mail from [CONTACT_172119] along with information about what the readings mean for their health. The project coordinator will immediately alert [CONTACT_172119] of participants with blood pressure readings that may be concerning 
(>170/110 mm Hg). [CONTACT_172119] will review associated readings, and notify the participant s via 
phone at her discretion. All participants will have the nocturnal blood pressure readings 
incorporated into their personal health records; nephrology clinic staff will be responsible for integrating these numbers into participants’ electronic health records within the nephrology 
clinic.  
 
Patient safety data examination, monitoring procedures/oversight. All adverse events 
(AEs) will be graded as to their attribution (unrelated to protocol, or possibly, probably, or definitely related to protocol). Any AE that is reported to either the PI [INVESTIGATOR_172080] a study part icipant or by [CONTACT_172116].  Potential (“expected”) AEs are described above under 
“Potential Risks”. Serious adverse events (SAEs) are predefined as: any experience that suggests a significant hazard, such as events which: a) are fatal, b) are life threatening, c) result 
in permanent disability, d) require inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or e) involve cancer, a congenital 
anomaly, or drug overdose. The standard Emory IRB reporting guidelines for AEs and SAEs will 
10/10/[ADDRESS_201876] copy file.  
 Plans to minimize potential AEs are described above under “Adequacy of Protection Against 
Risks.”  
 
Plans for transmission of temporary or permanent suspension actions. Any actions that 
mandate temporary or permanent suspension of the study will be transmitted to the Emory IRB and, if appropriate, to the FDA and the National Institutes of Health.  
 
Plans for protecting participant confidentiality. Participants will undergo CAPI [INVESTIGATOR_172081] a 
private room adjacent to the clinic waiting room.  They will undergo the experimental manipulation in one of six private research bays within the outpatient research suite of the 
Georgia CTSA .  All data will be collected by [CONTACT_1744] -approv ed personnel.   All information and 
materials obtained will be used for research purposes only, and the data will be kept in strict confidence. Confidentiality will be assured by [CONTACT_172117], datasets, and reports. The study database will be secured, and information will be entered using participant identifier codes rather than personal identifiers. 
Only group data will be presented and published.   
 Plans for assuring data accuracy and protocol human safety compliance. The above 
detailed plans should assure data accuracy and protocol human safety compliance for this study. These also include computerized database management and IRB oversight and 
communication. This plan, together  with the monitoring by [CONTACT_1201], should be sufficient without 
the addition of more faculty members to constitute a Data Safety and Monitoring Board.   
 
  
XI. Confidentiality  
 
Privacy will be maintained while individuals are participating in the study. Participants will be 
provided with a private room to provide consent and complete the CAPI [INVESTIGATOR_172082] 1, 
and will be provided with a private room to provide specimens and p articipate in the 
experimental manipulation on Day 2. Study participants' names will remain confidential.  Names 
will not appear in the data collection documentation. Informed consent documentation will be stored in a separate location from participant data. Thus, the data will not be linked to participant 
identifiers. When reporting study findings, identifiable information will not be used.   
 
The samples will be stored for as long as they are useful, unless the participant asks us to 
destroy their sample sooner. If a participant chooses to have their sample material destroyed, 
he/she can do so by [CONTACT_115864] ([CONTACT_172122]) or the project coordinator 
(Nakeva Redmond). Participants will be informed that their data will be used for the current 
study, but removed for any potential use on future studies.

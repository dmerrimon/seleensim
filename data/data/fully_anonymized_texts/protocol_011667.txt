BIOZEK Version: Final 1.0 – March 5, [ADDRESS_538788] is unaware of 
infection (asymptomatic). Epi[INVESTIGATOR_426476] -symptomatic and 
asymptomatic transmission of virus has driven the current epi[INVESTIGATOR_901]1. Antigen tests have a great 
potential for screening asymptomatic people2. To limit outbreaks, testing is needed to identify as 
many indiv iduals who are transmitting infection as quickly as possible. Antigen Tests have the 
potential to readily identify an individual who is at or near peak infection. Rapid Tests, while less 
sensitive, perform best during the early stages of COVID -19 infection ; when viral load and 
potential for spread is high.  
 
There is an unmet need to provide broad testing that can serve high risk and low resource 
communities. The FDA’s authorization for antigen tests for home use is helpi[INVESTIGATOR_426477]’ access to testing, reducing the burden on laboratories and test supplies3. The Biozek 
Antigen Rapid Test can be easily performed by [CONTACT_426486] 15 
minutes. The increased potential for repeated testing, remote or at home testing, cou ld help 
contain the COVID -19 pandemic.  
 
3. Background  
_____________________________________________________________________________  
 
In December 2019, an outbreak emerged identifying a novel coronavirus, severe acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SA RS-CoV -2). The World Health Organization (WHO) 
declared it a global pandemic in March 2020.   Testing in the U.S. appeared to be insufficient for 
optimal early containment of the virus. With the resurgence of the disease  (COVID -19), the U.S. 
has recently seen the highest number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_426478]4. Given the continued community transmission of 
SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_538789] polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test is used to diagnose 
COVID -[ADDRESS_538790] could potentially end the spread of COVID -19.

The primary objective of the study is to assess sensitivity and specific ity of BIOZEK COVID -[ADDRESS_538791] Cassette (Nasopharyngeal Swab) is a qualitative 
membrane -based immunoassay for the detection of SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_538792] line region, indicating a negative result. To serve as a procedural control, a 
colored line will always appear in the control line region, indicating that the proper volume of 
specimen has been a dded and membrane wicking has occurred.

Specimen Collection  
1. Insert a provided sterile swab into the nostril of the patient carefully, reaching the surface of 
the posterior nasopharynx.  
2. Swab over the surface  of the posterior nasopharynx gently.  
3. Withdraw the sterile swab from the nasal cavity.

4. 
Swab specimens should be extracted and tested as soon as possible after swab specimen 
collection.  
 
Specimen Extraction  
Only the extraction buffer and/or t ubes provided in this kit is to be used for specimen extraction.  
 
Swab specimen extraction with pre -filled integrated buffer tube (Option 1)  
1. Unscrew the cap of the extraction tube with the extraction  buffer inside.  
2. Place the swab specimen into the  extraction buffer, for better mixture and extraction to release 
antigen, rotate the swab for approximately [ADDRESS_538797] 
waste.  
4. Tighten the cap onto the sample extraction tube. Use the extracted  sample solution as a fina l 
sample for testing as soon as possible.  
 
Swab specimen extraction with extraction buffer and tube separately (Option 2&3)  
(Extraction buffer in 10mL buffer bottle or disposable buffer vial)  
1. Place the extraction tube in the workstation and add approx. 350μL Extraction Buffer into the 
extraction tube as following:  
Extraction buffer in 10mL bottle: Add 10 drops of extractio n buffer into the tube.  
Extraction buffer in disposable buffer vial: Tear to open the small disposable vial and add the 
Entire Extraction Buffer into the tube.  
2. Place the swab specimen into the extraction buffer. Rotate the swab for approximately [ADDRESS_538798] the inner wall of the tube 5 times to release the antigen.  

 
9 
BIOZEK Version: Final 1.0 – March 5, [ADDRESS_538799] 
waste.  
4. Fit the tip onto the top of the extraction tube. Use the extracted  sample solution as a final  
sample for testing as soon as possible.  
 
NOTE: For extraction buffer in 10mL bottle, it is suggested not to use the extracti on buffer 
beyond 3 months after opening the extraction buffer bottle.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Viral Transport Media (VTM) specimen extraction  
1. VTM should not contain guanidinium.  
2. When using Viral Transport Media (VTM) specimen, it is important to ensure that the V TM 
containing the swab specimen has been balanced to room temperature (15 - 30°C).  
3. Using a pi[INVESTIGATOR_426479] 350μL VTM specimen into the specimen extraction tube with 
approx.350μL extraction buffer inside, shake to mix it well for extraction. Use the extracted  
sample solution as a final  sample for testing as soon as possible.  
 
NOTE : The storage of the extracted specimen is stable for 2 hours at room temperature or 24 
hours at 2 -8°C. 
 
Standard Testing Procedure  
Allow the test, extracted specimen and/o r controls to equilibrate to room temperature (15 -30°C) 
prior to testing.  
 
Remove the test cassette from the sealed foil pouch and use it within one hour. Best results will 
be obtained if the test is performed immediately after opening the foil pouch.  
 
Invert the specimen collection tube and add 3 drops of the extracted specimen  (approx.75μl) to 
the specimen well(S) and then start the timer. |  
 
Wait for the colored line(s) to appear. Read the result in 15  minutes. Do not interpret the result 
after 20 minutes.

Figure 1: Interpretation of Results for Test Cassette  
 
After the te st is performed, remaining material should be disposed of in biohazard disposal.  
 
Control Material:  
Internal Quality Control  
An internal procedural control is included in the test. A colored line appearing in the control 
region (C) is an internal positive procedural control. It confirms sufficient specimen volume and 
correct procedural technique. A clear background is an internal negative procedural control. If 
the test is working properly, the background in the result area should be white to light pi[INVESTIGATOR_426480].  
 
External Quality Control  
Positive and negative controls are not included in this kit.  
 
 
Interpretation of results  
POSITIVE: *  Two distinct colored lines appear. One colored line should be in the control region 
(C) and another colored line should be in the Test region (T). A positive result in the Test region 
indicates detection of COVID -19 antigens in the sample.  
*NOTE: The int ensity of the color in the test line region (T) will vary based on the amount of 
COVID -[ADDRESS_538800] region (T) should be 
considered positive.  
 
NEGATIVE: One colored line appears in the control region (C) . No apparent colored line 
appears in the test line region (T). INVALID: Control line fails to appear in the control region 
(C). Insufficient specimen volume or incorrect procedural techniques are the most likely reasons 
for control line failure. Review th e procedure and repeat the test with a new cassette. If the 
problem persists, discontinue.

BIOZEK Version: Final 1.0 – March 5, [ADDRESS_538801] line region, indicating a negative result. To serve as a procedural control, 
a colored line will always appear in the control  line region, indicating that the proper volume of 
specimen has been added and membrane wicking has occurred.  
 
As shown in illustration above, the specimen (A) migrates via capi[INVESTIGATOR_426481] (B). COVID -[ADDRESS_538802] region (C). The formation of a 
visible colored line in the test region  indicates a positive result (C). The absence of a colored 
line in the test zones suggests a negative result. In the control zone of the membrane, 
immobilized reagents capture colored conjugate regardless of test specimen composition. The 
resulting visible  colored band (D) confirms the control  line. 
 
How to Store Biozek COVID -[ADDRESS_538803] Cassette (Nasopharyngeal Swab) packaged in 
the sealed pouch and extraction buffer at room temperature or refrigerate d (2-30°C). The test and 
extraction buffer are stable through the expi[INVESTIGATOR_426482]. The test must remain in the sealed pouch until use. DO NOT FREEZE. Do not use the kit 
beyond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_320]. Do not use the  kit if the package of the test cassette or buffer is 
damaged.

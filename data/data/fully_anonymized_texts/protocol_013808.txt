6.3. Administration of Test Articles  
Test articles will be given to subject s meeting all eligibility requirements .  Subjects will only 
be attempting to insert and remove  test articles during the non- dispensing visit.  Multiple test 
articles may be dispensed during the insertion and removal process if the lens needs to be 
replaced at the discretion of the Investigator due to excessive handling.   Lost or damaged test 
articles may be replaced at the discretion of the Investigator and/or the Sponsor.  
6.4. Packaging and Labeling 
The test articles will remain  in their marketed packaging and labeling.   
6.5. Storage Conditions 
Test articles will be maintained  at ambient temperatures at the clinical site.  Test articles must 
be kept under secure conditions. 
6.6. Collection and Storage of Samples 
Used lenses  will not be collected or stored. 
 
When possible, any lens or test article associated with an Adverse Events an d/or a Product 
Quality Complaint must be retained and stored in a glass vial with moderate solution pending directions from the sponsor for potential return back to JJVC. 
6.7. Accountability of Test Articles  
JJVC will provide the Investigator with sufficient quantities of study articles and supplies to 
complete the investigation.  The Investigator is asked to retain all lens shipment documentation for the test article accountability records.   Test article must be kept in a locked storage cabinet, accessible onl y to those assigned by [CONTACT_35500].  The Investigator may delegate this activity to authorized study 
site personnel listed on the Site Delegation Log.  All test articles must be accounted.  This includes: 
1. What was dispensed for the subj ect for trial fitting, to wear out of the office, or issued 
for the subject to replace appropriately between visits  
2. What was returned to the Investigator unused 
3. The number and reason for unplanned replacements

 • Subject develops significant or serious adverse events causing discontinuation of 
study lens wear  
• Subjects who have experienced a Corneal Infiltrative  Event (CIE)  
• Investigator’s clinical judgment regarding the subject safety reasons (that it is in the best interest of the subject to stop treatment)  
• Subject misses any  study visits   
• Subject not compliant with study lens wear schedule  
• Subject not successfully dispensed due to lack of efficacy and safety including poor vision, poor comfort or unacceptable fit  
For discontinued subjects, the Investigator will: 
• Complete the  current visit (scheduled or unscheduled) 
• Complete the Final Evaluation, indicating the reason that the subject was discontinued from the study 
• Record the spherocylindrical refraction with best corrected distance visual acuity  
• Collect used test article(s)  (worn or brought to the visit) from the subject and discard 
them, unless otherwise stated in Section 7.2 
• Collect all unused test article(s) from the subject  
 
An additional subject will be enrolled if a subject discontinues from the study prematurely.   In cases where a subject is lost to follow -up, every possible effort must be made to contact 
[CONTACT_23814]/withdrawal.  The measures taken to follow up must be documented including two written attempts and a certified letter (or 
equivalent) as the final attempt.  
9. PRE-STUDY AND CONCOMITANT INTERVENTION/MEDICATION 
Concomitant medications will be documented during screening and updated during the study.  Disallowed medication s for this study include: See Section 3.3   
Concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_35443]:  See Section 3.[ADDRESS_77424] be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours after discovery of the protocol deviation.  The Investigator will report deviations per IRB/IEC requirements.  All deviations will be tracked and corrective actions implemented as appropriate.   If it becomes ne cessary for the Investigator to implement a deviation in order to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to the trial subject, the Investigator may implement the deviation immediately without notification to the sponsor. Within [ADDRESS_77425] notify and provide the rationale to the Sponsor and, as 
required, the IEC/IRB.   
CR-6289, v3.[ADDRESS_77426] ([LOCATION_003]DE), or any SAE where the relationship to study agent cannot be ruled out, may result in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_71151].  In the event of a [LOCATION_003]DE or SAE, the Sponsor may unmask the treatment regimen for the subject(s) and will discuss this with the Investigator before any further subjects are enrolled. 
 The Sponsor will determine when a study will be stopped.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_71152]’s results are compromised.  
 JJVC reserves  the right to terminate the study at any time for any reason.  Additionally, the 
IEC/IRB reserves the right to terminate the study if an unreasonable risk is determined.  The study can be terminated by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_71153], if in their opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], after a discussion with JJVC, it is determined that it would be unwise to continue at the clinical site.    
 JJVC (and the IEC/IRB and data monitoring committee [ DMC], if applicable) will eva luate 
all adverse events.  If it is determined that an adverse event presents an unreasonable risk, the investigation, or that part of the investigation presenting the risk, will be terminated, as soon as possible.  Should the study be terminated (either p rematurely or as scheduled), the Investigator will 
notify the IEC/IRB and Regulatory Authority as required by [CONTACT_35512]. 
12. PROCEDURE FOR HANDLI NG PRODUCT QUALITY COMPLAINTS  
A Product Quality Complaint (PQC) refers to any written, electron ic, or oral communication 
that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, 
effectiveness or performance of test articles after they have been released for clinical trial use.    Potential complaints may come from a variety of sources including but not limited to 
subjects, clinical research associates (CRA), clinical operations managers (COM), medical monitors, and site personnel, etc. The following are not considered product quality complaints: 
• Subject satisfactio n inquiries reported via “Subjective Questionnaires” and “Patient 
Reported Outcomes (PRO)” 
• Clinical test articles that are stored improperly or damaged after receipt at the investigational site  
• Lens replacements that occur due to drops/fall -outs 
• Damage deemed by [CONTACT_35513], and not indicative of a quality deficiency (i.e. tears, rips, etc.), only in situations where there is no deficiency alleged by [CONTACT_71175]-6289, v3.[ADDRESS_77427] be 
recorded in the electronic data capture (EDC) system, which will trigger an automatic email 
notification to the appropriate COM/CRA and Clinical QA representative. In cases where the EDC system in use is not  configured to send automatic notifications or when an EDC system 
is not used, the COM/CRA is responsible for notifying Clinical QA upon discovery that a PQC has occurred.    Upon receipt of the EDC notification, the COM/CRA will contact [CONTACT_19568]:  
• Date the complaint was received/recorded in the EDC System (Date of Sponsor Awareness)  
• Who received the complaint 
• Study number 
• Clinical site information (contact [CONTACT_2300], site ID, telephone number) 
• Lot numbe r(s) 
• Unique Subject Identifier(s) 
• Indication of who first observed complaint (site personnel or subject) 
• OD/OS indication, along with whether  the lens was inserted  
• Any related AE number if applicable  
• Detailed complaint description (scheduled/unscheduled vi sit, wear time, symptoms, 
resolution of symptoms, etc.) 
• Eye Care Provider objective (slit lamp) findings if applicable  
• Confirmation of product availability for return (and tracking information, if available), or rationale if product is not available for return (Refer to Form Control No.  for test article return instructions)  
 
Once a complaint is received, it will be assessed by [CONTACT_19569], CRA, or trained site personnel to determine if it is an Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event (AE/SAE).  If the complaint results in an AE/SAE, the COM/CRA, or trained site personnel will follow Section 13 of this 
protocol. If the AE/SAE was potentially the result of a product quality related deficiency, these procedures also  applies and will be executed in parallel.   
 In some cases, a PQC form may be generated in EDC by [CONTACT_35514].  In this event, the PQC forms will be marked “Intentionally Left Blank” or “ILB”.  Justification for ILB must be documented. 
13. ADVERSE EVENT S 
13.1. Definitions and Classifications

• Localized Allergic Reactions  
• Any corneal event not explicitly defined as serious or significa nt adverse event, 
which necessitates temporary lens discontinuation <[ADDRESS_77428] (ADE) – An ADE is an “adverse event related to the use of an 
investigational medical device.  
Note 1 to entry: This definition includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or 
inadequate instructions for use, deployment, implantation, installation, or operation, or any 
malfunction of the investigational medical device.  
Note 2 to entry: This definition includes any event resulting from use error or from 
intentional misuse of the investigational medical device.”[ADDRESS_77429] (UADE) – Any serious adverse effect on health or 
safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associate d with, the test article, 
if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan, Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or protocol, or any other 
CR-6289, v3 [ADDRESS_77430] article that relates to the rights, safety 
and welfare of subjects.  
13.2. Assessing Adverse Events  
In conjunction with the medical monitor, the Investigator will evaluate adverse events to 
ensure the events are categorized correctly.  Elements o f categorization will include: 
• Seriousness/Classifications (see definition in Section 13.1) 
• Causality or Relatedness – i.e. the relationship between the test article, study 
treatment or study procedures and the adverse event (not related; unlikely related; 
possibly related; related - see definition in Section 13.2.1) 
• Adverse Event Severity – Adverse event severity is used to assess the degree of 
intensity of the advers e event (mild; moderate; severe for all events - see definition in 
Section 0)   
• Outcome – not recovered or not resolved; recovering or resolving ; recovered or 
resolved with sequelae; recovered or resolved ; death related to adverse event ; 
unknown 
• Actions Taken – none; temporarily discontinued; permanently discontinued; other 
13.2.1. Causality Assessment  
Causality Assessment – A determination of the relationship between an adverse event and 
the test article. The test artic le relationship for each adverse event should be determined by 
[CONTACT_32981]: 
• Not Related - An adverse event that is not related to the use of the test article, study 
treatment or study procedures 
• Unlikely Related – An adverse ev ent for which an alternative explanation is more 
likely, e.g. concomitant treatment, concomitant disease(s), or the relationship of time suggests that a causal relationship is not likely 
• Possibly Related – An adverse event that might be due to the use of t he test article, or 
to the study treatment or study procedures. An alternative explanation, e.g. concomitant treatment, concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive.  The relationship in time is reasonable.  Therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded  
• Related – An adverse event that is listed as a possible adverse effect (device) or 
adverse reaction (drug) and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_4867], e.g. concomitant treatment of concomitant disease(s).  The relationship in time is very suggestive, e.g. it is confirmed by [INVESTIGATOR_5328]- challenge and re- challenge  
13.2.2. Severity Assessment  
Severity Assessment – A qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an adverse 
event as determined by [CONTACT_19577]/her by [CONTACT_423].  The assessment of severity is made irrespective of test article, study treatment or study procedure relationship or seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale: 
• Mild – Event is noticeable to the subject, but is eas ily tolerated and does not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities  
CR-6289, v3 0
                Page 30 of 95
JJVC CONFIDENTIAL

   
  
 • Moderate – Event is bothersome, possible requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities  
• Severe – Event is intolerable, necessitates additional the rapy or alteration of therapy 
and interferes with the subject’s daily activities  
13.3. Documentation and Follow- Up of Adverse Events  
The recording and documenting of adverse events (ocular and non- ocular) begins when the 
subjects are exposed to the test article,  study treatment or study procedure.  Adverse events 
reported before the use of test article, start of study treatment, or study procedures will be 
recorded as medical history. However, if the condition deteriorates at any time during the study it will be recorded and reported as an AE. Untoward medical events reported after the 
subject’s exit from the study will be recorded as adverse events at the discretion of the Investigator.  Upon finding an adverse event, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_71156]. He/she will complete the Adverse Event /eCRF.   
 Complete descriptions of all adverse events must be available in the subject record. All Adverse Events including local and systemic reactions not meeting th e criteria for “serious 
adverse events” shall be captured on the appropriate CRF or electronic data system.  All 
adverse events occurring while the subject is enrolled in the study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship.    It is the I nvestigator’s responsibility to maintain documentation of each reported adverse 
event. All adverse events will be followed in accordance with applicable licensing requirements.  Such documentation will include the following: 
• Adverse event (diagnosis not sy mptom) 
• Drawings or photographs (where appropriate) that detail the finding (e.g., size, location, and depth, etc.)  
• Date the clinical site was notified  
• Date and time of onset  
• Date and time of resolution  
• Adverse event classification, severity, and relation ship to test articles, as applicable  
• Treatment regimen instituted, including concomitant medications prescribed, in accordance with applicable licensing requirements  
• Any referral to another health care provider if needed  
• Outcome, ocular damage (if any)  
• Likely etiology  
• Best corrected visual acuity at the discovery of the event and upon conclusion of the event 
 
In addition, if an infiltrate(s) is present, he/she will complete the Corneal Infiltrate Assessment eCRF.  Where necessary, a culture of the corneal l esion will be collected to 
determine if the infection is microbial in nature.  If cultures are collected, the date of culture collection and laboratory utilized will be recorded.  
CR-6289, v3 [ADDRESS_77431] returned to pre -treatment status, stabilized, or 
been satisfactorily resolved.  If further treat ment beyond licensure is required, the patient will 
be referred to the appropriate health care provider.  The Investigator will use his/her clinical judgment as to whether a subject reporting with an adverse event will continue in the study.  
If a subject is discontinued from the study, it will be the responsibility of the Investigator to 
record the reason for discontinuation.  The Investigator will also document the adverse event appropriately and complete the Adverse Event eCRF. Any subjects with ongoing adverse 
events related to the test article, study treatment or study procedures, as of the final study visit date, should be followed to resolution of the adverse event or until referral to an appropriate health care provider, as recommended by [CONTACT_11856]. Non- ocular adverse 
events that are not related to the test article, study treatment, or study procedures may be recorded as “ongoing” without further follow-up. 
13.4. Reporting Adverse Events  
The Investigator will notify the Sponsor of an adverse event b y e-mail, facsimile, or 
telephone as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours from discovery for any serious 
/significant adverse events, and 2 days from discovery for any non-significant adverse event.  In addition, a written report will be submitted by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_35451]/IRB according to their requirements (Section 13.4.2).  The report will comment whether the 
adverse event was considered to be related to the test article, study treatment or study 
procedures. 
13.4.1. Reporting Adverse Events to Sponsor 
Serious/Significant Adverse Events  
The Investigator will inform the sponsor of all serious/significant adverse events occurring 
during the study period as soon as possible by e -mail, fax, or telephone, but no later than 24 
hours following discovery of the event.  The Investigator is obligated to pursue and obtain 
information requested by [CONTACT_35519]. 
All subjects experiencing a serious/significant a dverse event must be followed up and all 
outcomes must be reported.  When medically necessary, the Investigator may break the randomization code to determine the identity of the treatment that the subject received.  The Sponsor and study monitor should be notified prior to unmasking the test articles.  
 In the event of a serious/significant adverse event, the Investigator must: 
• Notify the Sponsor immediately  
CR-6289, v3 0
                Page 32 of 95
JJVC CONFIDENTIAL

   
  
 • Obtain and maintain in the subject’s records all pertinent medical information and 
medical judgment for colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow -up of the 
subject 
• Provide the Sponsor with a complete case history which includes a statement as to whether the event was or was not related to the use of the test article  
• Notify the IEC/IRB as required by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB reporting procedure according to national regulations 
 
Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE)  
In the event of an Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE), the Investigator will submit a report of the UADE to the S ponsor and IEC/IRB as soon as possible, but no 
later than [ADDRESS_77432] report the results of the evaluation to FDA, the IEC/IRB and participating Investigators within [ADDRESS_77433].  Non-Serious Adverse Events  
All non-serious adverse events, including non- serious adverse device effects, will be reported 
to the sponsor by [CONTACT_35521] 2 days from discovery. 
13.4.2. Reporting Adverse Events to the Responsible IEC/IRB and Health Authorities  
Adverse events that meet the IEC/IRB requirements for reporting must be  reported within the 
IEC/IRB’s written guidelines. Each clinical site will refer to and follow any guidelines set 
forth by [CONTACT_19581]/IRB. Each clinical site will refer to and follow any guidelines set forth by [CONTACT_71177]. 
 The Sponsor will report applicable Adverse Events to the local health authorities according the written guidelines, including reporting timelines.  
13.4.3. Event of Special Interest  
None 
13.5. Reporting of Pregnancy 
Subjects reporting pregnancy (by [CONTACT_6270] -report) during the study will be discontinued after the 
event is recorded as an Adverse Event.  Once discontinued, pregnant participants and their 
fetuses will not be monitored for study related purposes.  At the Investigator’s discretion, the study participant may  be followed by [CONTACT_71178]. However, this data 
will not be collected as part of the clinical study database.  Pregnant participants are not discontinued from contact [CONTACT_71179], but due to general concerns relating to pregnancy and contact [CONTACT_19584].  Specifically, pregnant women 
are discontinued due to fluctuations in refractive error and/or visual acuity that occur secondary to systemic hormonal changes, and not due to unforeseen health risks  to the 
mother or fetus.

 14. STATISTICAL METHODS  
14.1. General Considerations  
Statistical Analysis will be undertaken by [CONTACT_35522].  
A general description of the statistical methods to be implemented in this clinical trial is outlined below.   All data summaries and statistical analyses will be performed using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).  Throughout the analysis of 
data, the results for each subject/eye will be used when available for summarization and 
statistical analysis.  Unscheduled visits will not be summarized separately and will be excluded from the statistical analysis.  
 Summary tables (descriptive statistics and/or frequency tables) will be provided for all baseline variables, efficacy variables and safety variables  by [CONTACT_71180] 
(i.e. neophyte or previous wearers).  Continuous variables will be summarized with 
descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum and maximum).  
Frequency count and percentage of subjects or eyes within each category will be provided for categorical data.  
14.2. Sample Size Justification  
Up to 16 subjects will be enrolled and a minimum of  12 subjects are targeted to complete the 
study.  This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], descriptive summary study and no statistical sample size estimation 
was conducted. 
14.3. Analysis Populations 
 
Safety Population: All subjects who were administered any test article excluding subjects who drop out prior to administering any test article.  At least one observation should be recorded. 
 Per-Protocol Population:  
All subjects who have successfully completed all visits and did not substantially deviate from the protocol as determined by [CONTACT_35524] (Per-Protocol Population).  Justification of excluding subjects with protocol deviations in the 
Per-Protocol Population set will be documented in a memo to file. 
 
14.4. Level of Statistical Significance  
All planned analysis for this study will be conducted with an overall type I error rate of 5%.

15.1. Electronic Case Report Form/Data Collection  
The data for this study will be captured on electronic case report forms (eCRFs) using an EDC system , Bioclinica . An authorized data originator will enter study data into the eCRFs 
using the EDC system. Data collected on equipment that is not captured in EDC will be formatted to the specification of the JJVC database manager and sent to JJVC for analysis.  
 The clinical data will be recorded on dedicated eCRFs specifically designed to match the study procedures for each visit.  Once completed, the eCRFs will be reviewed for accuracy and completeness and signed by [CONTACT_737].  The sponsor or sponsor’s representatives will be authorized to gain access to the subject recordation for the purposes of monitoring and auditing the study.   Edit checks, electronic queries, and audit trails are built into the system to e nsure accurate 
and complete data collection. Data will be transmitted from the clinical site to a secure

• Corneal hypoesthesia (reduced corneal sensitivity).
• Any systemic disease that may affect the eye or be exaggerated by 
[CONTACT_35543].
• Allergic reactions of ocular surfaces or adnexa that may be induced 
or exaggerated by [CONTACT_71186].
• Ocular irritation due to allergic reactions which may be caused by 
[CONTACT_35545] (i.e., rewetting drops) that contain chemicals or preservatives (such as mercury, Thimerosal, etc.) to which some people may develop an allergic response.
• Any active corneal infection (bacterial, fungal, protozoal, or viral).
• If eyes become red or irritated.
WARNINGS
Patients should be advised of the following warnings pertaining to 
contact [CONTACT_13279]:
EYE PROBLEMS, INCLUDING CORNEAL ULCERS, CAN DEVELOP 
RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_35458]; IF THE PATIENT EXPE-RIENCES:
• Eye Discomfort,
• Excessive Tearing,• Vision Changes,• Loss of Vision,• Eye Redness,• Or Other Eye Problems, 
THE PATIENT SHOULD BE INSTRUCTED TO IMMEDIATELY RE-
MOVE THE LENSES AND PROMPTLY CONTACT [CONTACT_35546].
• When prescribed for daily wear, patients should be instructed not 
to wear lenses while sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Clinical studies have shown that 
the risk of serious adverse reactions is increased when lenses are worn overnight, and that the risk of ulcerative keratitis is greater for 
CR-6289, v3 0
                Page 52 of 95
JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
• The potential impact of these factors on the patient’s ocular health 
should be carefully weighed against the patient’s need for refractive 
correction; therefore, the continuing ocular health of the patient and lens performance on the eye should be carefully monitored by [CONTACT_71187].
• Patients who wear these lenses to correct presby[CONTACT_35553]-
vision may not achieve the best corrected visual acuity for either far or near vision. Visual requirements vary with the individual and should be considered when selecting the most appropriate type of lens for each patient.
• Fluorescein, a yellow dye, should not be used while the lenses are 
on the eyes. The lenses absorb this dye and become discolored. Whenever ﬂ  uorescein is used in eyes, the eyes should be ﬂ  ushed with a sterile saline solution that is recommended for in-eye use.
• Eye Care Professionals should instruct the patient to remove the 
lenses immediately if the eyes become red or irritated. 
Eye Care Professionals should carefully instruct patients about the following care regimen and safety precautions.
Handling Precautions:
• Before leaving the Eye Care Professional’s ofﬁ  ce, the patient should 
be able to promptly remove the lenses or should have someone 
else available who can remove the lenses for him or her. 
• DO NOT use if the sterile blister package is opened or damaged. 
• Always wash and rinse hands before handling lenses. Do not get 
cosmetics, lotions, soaps, creams, deodorants, or sprays in the 
eyes or on the lenses. It is best to put on lenses before putting on makeup. Water-based cosmetics are less likely to damage lenses than oil-based products. 
• DO NOT touch contact [CONTACT_35554] ﬁ  ngers or hands if the 
hands are not free of foreign materials, as microscopic scratches of the lenses may occur, causing distorted vision and/or injury to the eye.
• Carefully follow the handling, insertion, removal, and wearing 
instructions in the “Patient Instruction Guide” for the prescribed 
CR-6289, v3 0
                Page 54 of 95
JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
wearing schedule and those prescribed by [CONTACT_35555].
• Always handle lenses carefully and avoid droppi[INVESTIGATOR_35459].
• Never use tweezers or other tools to remove lenses from the lens 
container unless speciﬁ  cally indicated for that use. Slide the lens up 
the side of the bowl until it is free of the container. 
• Do not touch the lens with ﬁ  ngernails. 
Lens Wearing Precautions:
• If the lens sticks (stops moving) on the eye, follow the recom-
mended directions in “Care for a Sticking (Non-Moving) Lens." The lens should move freely on the eye for the continued health of the eye. If non-movement of the lens continues, the patient should be instructed to immediately consult his or her Eye Care Professional.
• Never wear lenses beyond the period recommended by [CONTACT_71188].
• The patient should be advised to never allow anyone else to wear 
their lenses. They have been prescribed to ﬁ  t their eyes and to correct their vision to the degree necessary. Sharing lenses greatly increases the chance of eye infections.
• If aerosol products, such as hair spray, are used while wearing 
lenses, exercise caution and keep eyes closed until the spray has settled.
• Avoid all harmful or irritating vapors and fumes while wearing 
lenses. 
• Always discard lenses worn as prescribed by [CONTACT_35555]. 
Lens Care Precautions:  
• The patient should be informed that no cleaning or disinfection is 
needed when lenses are worn for daily disposable wear.  Patients should always dispose of lenses when removed and have spare lenses or spectacles available.

Other Topi[INVESTIGATOR_35460]:
• Always contact [CONTACT_35558]-
cine in the eyes. 
• Certain medications, such as antihistamines, decongestants, 
diuretics, muscle relaxants, tranquilizers, and those for motion 
sickness may cause dryness of the eye, increased lens awareness, or blurred vision. Should such conditions exist, proper remedial measures should be prescribed. Depending on the severity, this could include the use of lubricating drops that are indicated for use with soft contact [CONTACT_71189]. 
• Oral contraceptive users could develop visual changes or changes 
in lens tolerance when using contact [CONTACT_13276]. Patients should be cautioned accordingly. 
• As with any contact [CONTACT_13293], follow-up visits are necessary to assure 
the continuing health of the patient’s eyes. The patient should be instructed as to a recommended follow-up schedule. 
Who Should Know That the Patient is Wearing Contact [CONTACT_32993]?
• Patients should inform all doctors (Health Care Professionals) about 
being a contact [CONTACT_35560]. 
• Patients should always inform their employer of being a contact 
[CONTACT_35560]. Some jobs may require use of eye protection equip-ment or may require that the patient not wear contact [CONTACT_13276]. 
ADVERSE REACTIONS
The patient should be informed that the following problems may occur when wearing contact [CONTACT_13276]:
• The eye may burn, sting, and/or itch.
• There may be less comfort than when the lens was ﬁ  rst placed on 
the eye.
• There may be a feeling of something in the eye (foreign body, 
scratched area).
• There may be the potential for some temporary impairment due to 
CR-6289, v3 0
                Page 56 of 95
JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
peripheral inﬁ  ltrates, peripheral corneal ulcers, or corneal erosion. 
There may be the potential for other physiological observations, such as local or generalized edema, corneal neovascularization, corneal staining, injection, tarsal abnormalities, iritis, and conjuncti-vitis; some of which are clinically acceptable in low amounts.
• There may be excessive watering, unusual eye secretions, or 
redness of the eye.
• Poor visual acuity, blurred vision, rainbows, or halos around 
objects, photophobia, or dry eyes may also occur if the lenses are worn continuously or for too long a time.
The patient should be instructed to conduct a simple 3-part self-examina-tion at least once a day. They should ask themselves:
• How do the lenses feel on my eyes?
• How do my eyes look?• Have I noticed a change in my vision? 
If the patient reports any problems, he or she should be instructed to 
IMMEDIATELY REMOVE THE LENS. If the problem or discomfort stops, the patient should discard the lens and place a new fresh lens on the eye.
If after inserting the new lens, the problem continues, the patient should be 
directed to IMMEDIATELY REMOVE THE LENS AND CONTACT [CONTACT_35561].
The patient should be instructed NOT to use a new lens as self-treatment 
for the problem.
The patient should be advised that when any of the above symptoms oc-
cur, a serious condition such as infection, corneal ulcer, neovascularization, or iritis may be present. He or she should be instructed to seek immediate professional identiﬁ  cation of the problem and prompt treatment to avoid serious eye damage.

GENERAL FITTING GUIDELINES
A. Patient Selection
Patients selected to wear these lenses should be chosen based on: 
• Motivation to wear lenses 
• Ability to follow instructions regarding lens wear care
• General health 
• Ability to adequately handle and care for the lenses 
• Ability to understand the risk and beneﬁ  ts of lens wear
Patients who do not meet the above criteria should not be provided with contact [CONTACT_13276]. 
B. Pre-ﬁ  tting Examination
Initial evaluation of the patient should begin with a thorough case history 
to determine if there are any contraindications to contact [CONTACT_13279]. During the case history, the patient’s visual needs and expectations should be determined as well as an assessment of their overall ocular, physical, and mental health. Preceding the initial selection of trial contact [CONTACT_13276], a comprehensive ocular evaluation should be performed that includes, but is not limited to, the measurement of distance and near visual acuity, distance and near refractive prescription (including determining the preferred reading distance for presby[CONTACT_35562]), keratometry, and biomicroscopic evaluation. 
Based on this evaluation, if it is determined that the patient is eligible to 
wear these lenses, the Eye Care Professional should proceed to the lens ﬁ  tting instructions as outlined below. 
C. Initial Power DeterminationA spectacle refraction should be performed to establish the patient’s 
baseline refractive status and to guide in the selection of the appropriate lens power. Remember to compensate for vertex distance if the refraction is greater than ±4.00D.
D. Base Curve Selection (Trial Lens Fitting)
The following trial lenses should be selected for patients regardless of kera-tometry readings. However, corneal curvature measurements should be performed to establish the patient’s baseline ocular status.

• ACUVUE OASYS® 1-Day: 8.5 mm/14.3 mm
• ACUVUE OASYS® 1-Day for ASTIGMATISM: 8.5 mm/14.3 mm
The trial lens should be placed on each of the patient's eyes and evaluated 
after the patient has adjusted to the lenses.  
1. Criteria of a Properly Fit Lens 
A properly ﬁ  t lens will center and completely cover the cornea (i.e., no limbal exposure), have sufﬁ  cient movement to provide tear exchange under the contact [CONTACT_35563], and be comfortable. The lens should move freely when manipulated digitally with the lower lid, and then return to its properly centered position when released.
2. Criteria of a Flat Fitting Lens 
A ﬂ  at ﬁ  tting lens may exhibit one or more of the following characteris-tics: decentration, incomplete corneal coverage (i.e., limbal exposure), excessive movement with the blink, and/or edge standoff. If the lens is judged to be ﬂ  at ﬁ  tting, it should not be dispensed to the patient.
3. Criteria of a Steep Fitting Lens 
A steep ﬁ  tting lens may exhibit one or more of the following charac-teristics: insufﬁ  cient movement with the blink, conjunctival indentation, and resistance when pushing the lens up digitally with the lower lid. If the lens is judged to be steep ﬁ  tting, it should not be dispensed to the patient.
If the initial trial base curve is judged to be ﬂ  at or steep ﬁ  tting, the alternate base curve, if available, should be trial ﬁ  t and evaluated after the patient has adjusted to the lens. The lens should move freely when manipulated digitally with the lower lid, and then return to a properly centered position when released. If resistance is encountered when pushing the lens up, the lens is ﬁ  tting tightly and should not be dispensed to the patient.
E. Final Lens Power (Spherical)
A spherical over-refraction should be performed to determine the ﬁ  nal lens power after the lens ﬁ  t is judged acceptable. The spherical over-refraction should be combined with the trial lens power to determine the ﬁ  nal lens prescription. The patient should experience good visual acuity with the correct lens power unless there is excessive residual astigmatism.

Figure 1
You’ll need a slit lamp biomicroscope with a 1 to 2 mm 
parallelepi[INVESTIGATOR_35462] ﬁ  tted to the eye. There are a number of techniques you can use to improve the visibility of the 6 o’clock mark. Using a parallelepi[INVESTIGATOR_35463]ﬁ  cation (10x or 15x), slowly pan down the lens, looking just below the direct illumination at the retroilluminated area. Backlighting the mark this way should make it more visible. Sometimes manipulating the lower lid may be necessary to uncover the mark.
2. Observe Lens Rotation and Stability
Observe the position and stability of the “bottom” mark. It usually stabilizes at the 6 o’clock position. If it does, calculation of the lens power will be straightforward. The 6 o’clock position is not a “must”; however, the absolute requirement is that the axis position be stable and repeatable.
The mark may stabilize somewhat left or right (drift) of the vertical 
meridian and still enable you to ﬁ  t a toric lens for that eye, as long as the lens always returns to the same “drift axis” position after settling. The deviation can be compensated for in the ﬁ  nal prescription. Your objective is to ensure that whatever position the initial lens assumes near 6 o’clock, this position must be stable and repeatable. With full eye movement or heavy blink, you may see the marks swing away, but they must return quickly to the original stable position. If the lens does not return quickly, you may need to select a different lens.
3. Assessing Rotation
Imagine the eye as a clock dial and every hour represents a 30° interval. If the orientation mark of the initial lens stabilizes somewhat left or right of the vertical position, the ﬁ  nal lens will orient on the eye with the same deviation. You can use an axis reticule in the slit lamp or use a line-scribed lens in a spectacle trial frame to measure or estimate the “drift angle” of the cylinder axis.
To compensate for this “drift”, measure or estimate the “drift”, then 
add or subtract it from the refractive axis to determine the correct cylinder axis. Use the LARS (Left Add, Right Subtract) method to determine which direction to compensate.

B. Final Lens Power 
When the diagnostic lens has its axis aligned in the same meridian 
as the patient’s refractive axis, a spherocylindrical over-refraction may be performed and visual acuity determined. However, in the case of crossed axes, such as when the diagnostic lens axis is different from the spectacle cylinder axis, it is not advisable to perform a full spherocylindrical over-refraction because of the difﬁ  culty in computing the resultant power. A spherical over-refraction without cylinder refraction may be performed. 
If the required cylinder correction falls between two available cylinder 
powers, it is recommended to prescribe the lower cylinder power lens. See below for instructions on how to determine the ﬁ  nal lens power.
1. For the Sphere
If sphere alone or combined sphere and cylinder Rx > ±4.00D, 
compensate for vertex distance. If sphere alone or combined sphere and cylinder Rx ≤ ±4.00D, vertex compensation is not necessary.
2. For the Cylinder
Adjust the axis by [CONTACT_35564]. Choose a cylinder that is ≤ 0.50D from the refractive cylinder.
3. Case Examples
Example [ADDRESS_77445] (spectacle) refraction:
O.D. -2.50D / -1.25D x 180° 20/20O.S. -2.00D / -1.00D x 180° 20/20
Choose a diagnostic lens for each eye with axis 180°. Place 
the lens on each eye and allow a minimum of 3 minutes for it to equilibrate, based on the patient’s initial response to the lens. If the lens has not yet stabilized, recheck until stable.
Check the orientation of the axis mark. If the bottom axis mark 
is in the 6 o’clock position on both eyes, choose the appropriate cylinder as listed previously. If the lens has not yet stabilized, recheck until stable.
Here is the Rx Prescribed:
O.D. -2.50D / -1.25D x 180°O.S. -2.00D / -0.75D x 180°
CR-6289, v3 [ADDRESS_77446] (spectacle) refraction:O.D. -3.00D / -1.00D x 90° 20/20O.S. -4.75D / -2.00D x 90° 20/20
Choose diagnostic lenses of -3.00D / -0.75D x 90° for the right 
eye and -4.50D / -1.75D x 90° for the left eye, the nearest lenses available to the spherical power, cylinder power, and axis needed. For the left eye, since the manifest refraction called for -4.75D, compensating for vertex distance the sphere is reduced by 0.25D to -4.50D. The cylinder power will be -1.75D. Place the lens on each eye and allow a minimum of 3 minutes for it to equilibrate, based on the patient's initial response to the lens. If the lens has not yet stabilized, recheck until stable. 
Right Eye
The orientation mark on the right lens rotates left from the 6 
o’clock position by 10° and remains stable in this position. Compensation for this rotation should be done as follows: 
Compensate the 10° axis drift by [CONTACT_35565].
Here is the Rx Prescribed:
O.D. -3.00D / -0.75D x 100°
Left Eye
The orientation mark on the left lens rotates right from the 6 
o’clock position by 10° and remains stable in this position. 
Compensate for the 10° axis drift by [CONTACT_35566]. 
Here is the Rx Prescribed: 
O.S. -4.50D / -1.75D x 80°
If vision is acceptable, perform a slit lamp examination to assess 
adequate ﬁ  t (centration and movement). If ﬁ  t is acceptable, dispense the lenses instructing the patient to return in one week for reassessment (see dispensing and follow-up information in PATIENT MANAGEMENT).
All patients should be supplied with a copy of the PATIENT INSTRUCTION GUIDE for these lenses. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_35461].acuvue.com.
CR-6289, v3 [ADDRESS_77447] adequately 
corrected distance and near visual acuity in each eye. The amblyopic patient or the patient with signiﬁ  cant astigmatism (greater than 1.00D) in one eye may not be a good candidate for monovision correction with these lenses.
Occupational and environmental visual demands should be 
considered. If the patient requires critical vision (visual acuity and stereopsis), it should be determined by [CONTACT_71190]. Monovision contact [CONTACT_35568]:
• visually demanding situations such as operating potentially 
dangerous machinery or performing other potentially hazardous 
activities; and
• driving automobiles (e.g., driving at night). Patients who cannot 
meet state driver's licensing requirements with monovision correction should be advised to not drive with this correction, OR may require that additional over-correction be prescribed.
2. Patient Education
All patients do not function equally well with monovision correc-tion. Patients may not perform as well for certain tasks with this correction as they have with spectacles (multifocal, bifocal, trifocal, readers, progressives). Each patient should understand that monovision, as well as other presby[CONTACT_35569], can create a vision compromise that may reduce visual acuity and depth perception for distance and near tasks. Therefore, caution should be exercised when the patient is wearing the correction for the ﬁ  rst time until they are familiar with the vision provided in visually chal-lenging environments (e.g., reading a menu in a dim restaurant, driving at night in rainy/foggy conditions, etc.). During the ﬁ  tting process, it is necessary for the patient to realize the disadvantages as well as the advantages of clear near vision and straight ahead and upward gaze that monovision contact [CONTACT_35570].

B. Eye Selection
1. Ocular Preference Determination Methods
Generally, the non-dominant eye is corrected for near vision. The 
following two methods for eye dominance can be used.
Method 1:  Determine which eye is the “sighting eye.” Have the 
patient point to an object at the far end of the room. 
Cover one eye. If the patient is still pointing directly at the object, the eye being used is the dominant (sighting) eye.
Method 2:  Determine which eye will accept the added power with 
the least reduction in vision. Place a hand-held trial lens equal to the spectacle near ADD in front of one eye and then the other while the distance refractive error correction is in place for both eyes. Determine whether the patient functions best with the near ADD lens over the right or left eye.
2. Other Eye Selection Methods
Other methods include the "Refractive Error Method" and the "Visual Demands Method."
Refractive Error MethodFor anisometropic correction, it is generally best to ﬁ  t the more 
hyperopic (less myopic) eye for distance and the more myopic (less hyperopic) eye for near.
Visual Demands Method
Consider the patient’s occupation during the eye selection process 
to determine the critical vision requirements. If a patient’s gaze for near tasks is usually in one direction, correct the eye on that side for near.
Example: A secretary who places copy to the left side of the desk 
will function best with the near lens on the left eye.
C. Special Fitting Characteristics
1. Unilateral Vision Correction
There are circumstances where only one contact [CONTACT_35571]. As an example, an emmetropic patient would only require a near lens, whereas a bilateral myope would require corrective lenses on

both eyes.
Examples: A presby[CONTACT_35572] a +1.75D ADD 
would have a +1.75D lens on the near eye and the other eye left without correction. 
A presby[CONTACT_35573] a +1.50D ADD who is -2.50D 
myopic in the right eye and -1.50D myopic in the left eye may have the right eye corrected for distance and the left uncorrected for near.
2. Near ADD Determination
Always prescribe the lens power for the near eye that provides optimal near acuity at the midpoint of the patient’s habitual reading distance. However, when more than one power provides optimal reading performance, prescribe the least plus (most minus) of the powers.
3. Trial Lens Fitting
A trial ﬁ  tting is performed in the ofﬁ  ce to allow the patient to experience monovision correction. Lenses are ﬁ  t according to the GENERAL FITTING GUIDELINES for base curve selection described in this Package Insert.
Case history and standard clinical evaluation procedure should 
be used to determine the prognosis. Determine the distance correction and the near correction. Next determine the near ADD. With trial lenses of the proper power in place, observe the reaction to this mode of correction.
Allow the lenses to settle for about [ADDRESS_77448] the patient look at you. Assess the patient’s reaction to distance vision under these circumstances. Then have the patient look at familiar near objects such as a watch face or ﬁ  ngernails. Again assess the reaction. As the patient continues to look around the room at both near and distance objects, observe the reactions. Only after these vision tests are completed should the patient be asked to read print. Evaluate the patient’s reaction to large print (e.g., typewritten copy) at ﬁ  rst and then graduate to newsprint and ﬁ  nally smaller type sizes.
After the patient’s performance under the above conditions 
is completed, tests of visual acuity and reading ability under 
CR-6289, v3 [ADDRESS_77449] several weeks of wear (when adaptation is occurring), it may be advisable for the patient to only drive during optimal driving conditions. After adaptation and success with these activities, the patient should be able to drive under other conditions with caution.
D. Other Suggestions
The success of the monovision technique may be further improved by [CONTACT_35574]:
• Have a third contact [CONTACT_13293] (distance power) to use when critical 
distance viewing is needed.
• Have a third contact [CONTACT_13293] (near power) to use when critical near 
viewing is needed.
• Having supplemental spectacles to wear over the monovision 
contact [CONTACT_35575]ﬁ  c visual tasks may improve the success of monovision correction. This is particularly applicable for those patients who cannot meet state driver's licensing requirements with monovision correction.
• Make use of proper illumination when carrying out visual tasks.

Monovision ﬁ  tting success can be improved by [CONTACT_35576]:
• Reverse the distance and near eyes if a patient is having trouble 
adapting.
• Reﬁ  ne the lens powers if there is trouble with adaptation. 
Accurate lens power is critical for presby[CONTACT_35577].
• Emphasize the beneﬁ  ts of clear near vision and straight ahead 
and upward gaze with monovision.
The decision to ﬁ  t a patient with monovision correction is most appropriately left to the Eye Care Professional in conjunction with the patient after carefully considering the patient’s needs.

PATIENT MANAGEMENT
Dispensing Visit
Each sterile lens is supplied in a foil-sealed plastic package containing 
buffered saline solution with methyl ether cellulose. To remove the lens from the container, peel back the foil seal, place a ﬁ  nger on the lens, and slide the lens up the side of the bowl of the lens package until it is free of the container.
• Evaluate the physical ﬁ  t and visual acuity of the lens on each eye.
• Teach the patient how to apply and remove his or her lenses.
• Explain daily disposable lens wear and schedule a follow-up examination.
• Provide the patient with a copy of the PATIENT 
INSTRUCTION GUIDE for these lenses. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_35461].acuvue.com.
REVIEW THESE INSTRUCTIONS WITH THE PATIENT SO THAT HE 
OR SHE CLEARLY UNDERSTANDS THE PRESCRIBED WEARING AND REPLACEMENT SCHEDULES.
Follow-Up Examinations
Follow-up care (necessary to ensure continued successful contact [CONTACT_13279]) should include routine periodic progress examinations, management of speciﬁ  c problems, if any, and a review with the patient of the wear schedule, daily disposable modality, and proper lens handling procedures.

Recommended Follow-up Examination Schedule (complications 
and speciﬁ  c problems should be managed on an individual patient basis):
1. One week from the initial lens dispensing to patient
2. One month post-dispensing
3. Every three to six months thereafter 
NOTE: Preferably, at the follow-up visits, lenses should be worn for at least 
six hours.
Recommended Procedures for Follow-up Visits:
1. Solicit and record patient’s symptoms, if any.
2. Measure visual acuity monocularly and binocularly at distance and 
near with the contact [CONTACT_13276].
3. Perform an over-refraction at distance and near to check for residual 
refractive error.
4. With the biomicroscope, judge the lens ﬁ  tting characteristics (as 
described in the GENERAL FITTING GUIDELINES) and evaluate 
the lens surface for deposits and damage.
5. Following lens removal, examine the cornea and conjunctiva with 
the biomicroscope and ﬂ  uorescein (unless contraindicated).
• The presence of vertical corneal striae in the posterior central 
cornea and/or corneal neovascularization is indicative of 
excessive corneal edema.
• The presence of corneal staining and/or limbal-conjunctival 
hyperemia can be indicative of an unclean lens, a reaction to solution preservatives, excessive lens wear and/or a poorly ﬁ  tting lens.
• Papi[INVESTIGATOR_35465]/or damaged lens.
6. Periodically perform keratometry and spectacle refractions. The 
values should be recorded and compared to the baseline meas-
urements.
If any observations are abnormal, use professional judgment to alleviate the problem and restore the eye to optimal conditions. If

the criteria for successful ﬁ  t are not satisﬁ  ed during any follow-up 
examinations, repeat the patient’s trial ﬁ  tting procedure and reﬁ  t 
the patient.
WEARING SCHEDULE
The wearing schedule should be determined by [CONTACT_35578].   Regular checkups, as determined by [CONTACT_35578], are also extremely important.
Patients tend to overwear the lenses initially. The Eye Care Professional 
should emphasize the importance of adhering to the initial maximum wear-ing schedule.  Maximum wearing time should be determined by [CONTACT_35579]’s physiological eye condition, because individual response to contact [CONTACT_35580].
The maximum suggested wearing time for these lenses is:
Day Hours
[ADDRESS_77450] spare lenses or spectacles available.
Basic Instructions
• Always wash, rinse, and dry hands before handling contact [CONTACT_13276].
• Do not use saliva or anything other than the recommended solutions 
for lubricating or rewetting lenses. Do not put lenses in the mouth.
• Eye Care Professionals may recommend a lubricating/rewetting solution which can be used to wet (lubricate) lenses while they are being worn to make them more comfortable. 
Care for a Sticking (Non-Moving) Lens
If the lens sticks (stops moving), the patient should be instructed to apply 
a few drops of the recommended lubricating or rewetting solution directly to the eye and wait until the lens begins to move freely on the eye before removing it. If non-movement of the lens continues after a few minutes, the patient should immediately consult the Eye Care Professional.
EMERGENCIES
The patient should be informed that if chemicals of any kind (household products, gardening solutions, laboratory chemicals, etc.) are splashed into the eyes, the patient should: FLUSH EYES IMMEDIATELY WITH TAP WATER AND IMMEDIATELY CONTACT [CONTACT_35581] A HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_35466].

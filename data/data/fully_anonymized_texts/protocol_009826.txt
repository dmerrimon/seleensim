for Smoking Cessation (CoQuit)  
 
DP006495 -01 
 
Study Protocol and Analysis : 4/4/ 2019  
Informed Consent: 5/5/[ADDRESS_335950] generally used some combination of cognitive behavioral interventions in varying 
combinations, but there remains a need for novel, theory -driven approaches to enhance quit rates and 
increase reach and engagement, such as those offered via computer or mobile app.  
One approach that has demonstrated preliminary success in improving smoking cessation rates is 
cognitive dissonance induction,4-6 which is based on the premise that behavior change can be elicited through 
exposure to high levels of cognitive inconsistencies between their beliefs and behaviors.7 For example, having 
an individual who smokes present a verbal argument to a young person, outlining specific reasons why he/she 
should avoid smoking initiation is a cognitive dissonance induction strategy that has been examined in prior 
studies.[ADDRESS_335951] been successfully utilized for behavior change 
and for a number of physical and mental health problems,18,19 as well as smoking and smokeless tobacco 
cessation.20-22 Computer - and internet -based interventions offer increased accessibility and flexibility, as well 
as increased confidentiality and anonymity, all of which increase the number of individuals that can be treated.
23-25 
Given the preliminary success of cognitive dissonance approaches at treating tobacco and substance use, 
and other health -related problems, coupled with positive outcomes and increased accessibility of mobile- based 
app interventions, the current proposal is  aimed at adapting and testing the feasibility of a cognitive dissonance 
intervention (CDI) delivered via a mobile app for current daily smokers that is based on a previously pi[INVESTIGATOR_275147]. Our  group has a long history of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_275148] -risk, substance- using adults and youth, and 
testing successful tobacco cessation interventions.26-[ADDRESS_335952] of the 
proposed intervention is very high – especially given the use of a mobile app format that can reach high risk, 
underserved populations of smokers and can be broadly implemented at minimal  expense.  
Specific aims are as follows:  
1. Design and create a prototype mobile app that uses a cognitive dissonance induction approach (CDI) 
that targets daily adult smokers who are interested in quitting. An iterative approach using focus groups 
of adult smokers will be used to inform the design and functi onality of the first [ADDRESS_335953] 3 modules. Usability data, system log data on program use, and participant satisfaction data will also be analyzed. Input from participants wil l be gathered to incorporate additional features to be 
developed during Phase II. Significant changes in quit attempts, number of days without smoking (smokefree days) and changes in smoking attitudes and behavior will be used to determine the efficacy of the Phase I program and evidence for proceeding to Phase II development and evaluation.

B. SIGNIFICANCE  
 
B.1. Importance of smoking  cessation  
Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S.,1,2 accounting for approximately 443,000 
deaths, which is 20% of all deaths annually.1,[ADDRESS_335954] their beliefs or behaviors in order to reduce the discomfort of the dissonance that is elicited by [CONTACT_275165]. Reducing cognitive dissonance can be achieved in one of 
three ways: 1) adjusting one or more attitudes or behaviors to make the relati onship between the two 
consistent, 2) acquiring new information that offsets the dissonant belief, or 3) reducing the importance of the attitudes or beliefs so that the inconsistent behavior can  continue.  
Interventions that use cognitive dissonance to elicit behavior change do so through situations that create 
high levels of cognitive dissonance. Regardless of the behavior being targeted, there are several common 
concepts that are central to effective cogni tive dissonance induction. First, participation in the induction activity 
must be voluntary. Voluntary participation requires the individual to attribute the inconsistency between beliefs 
and behaviors as existing within themselves, rather than being due t o demands of a given situation.
7 Effortful 
involvement (i.e., actively engaging in treatment exercises) is also required, and is believed to result in greater dissonance and greater motivation for change.
30 And finally, public statements of beliefs (i.e., counter - 
attitudinal advocacy) are thought to elicit heightened dissonance responses.[ADDRESS_335955] 
shown counter -attitudinal advocacy to be successful in isolation of the other dissonance -inducing components 
(voluntariness, effortful inv olvement). Counter -attitudinal advocacy activities that are often used to induce 
dissonance include preparing and delivering speeches or statements about personal beliefs, role- plays where 
individuals act out a particular behavior, or making public commitm ents. Given the central role that counter - 
attitudinal activities appear to play in eliciting cognitive dissonance, these activities are a core component of 
the proposed cognitive dissonance mobile app intervention (CDI).  
Cognitive dissonance has been widely researched and applied in the physical and mental health arenas. In 
particular, increasing cognitive dissonance has been shown to be successful at treating obesity,8 improving 
healthy eating,9 reducing fears,11,12 treating chronic illness,13 improving safe sex practices,14  and has been 
used as a preventive measure in the development of eating disorders.10 In their study of eating disorders, Stice 
and colleagues33 showed that participants in a cognitive dissonance induction intervention who voluntarily 
critique the thin beauty ideal in verbal, written, and behavioral exercises (voluntariness, counter -attitudinal 
advocacy) resulted in significant reductions in the thin -ideal internalization, which putatively decreased body 
dissatisfaction, unhealthy dietary behaviors, negative affect, and eating disorder  symptoms.  
Of particular relevance, cognitive dissonance approaches have also shown success in treating substance 
use,15,[ADDRESS_335956] been found, which suggests that increased 
exposure to dissonance induction activities (dosage) and reach of cognitive dissonance induction approaches 
might yield improved smoking abstinence outcomes. Guided by [CONTACT_275166], the proposed CDI intervention 
specifically provides increased opportunity for exposure to cognitive dissonance by [CONTACT_275167]. In particular, we propose to offer the participant 
multiple opportunities for counter -attitudinal activities and public statements. Additionally, the mobile app 
format allows for increased access and reach of the intervention. The CDI app will be based on prior cognitive  
 
Research Strategy   
  
dissonance intervention activities that have demonstrated effectiveness and will specifically build on Consultant 
Simmons’ prior work with cognitive dissonance induction via video -recorded tasks for smoking cessation.4-[ADDRESS_335957], ease of use, and increased availability via smartphones.  
Smartphone use has grown considerably in recent years, with more than 90% of adults in the U.S. currently 
estimated to be relying on smartphones daily,[ADDRESS_335958] on mobile phones, with an estimated 75% of people using their smartphones to record and 
access video.36 
One of the primary benefits of mobile app interventions is the ability to provide support for introducing new 
skills and for mobile content to be more readily delivered (pushed) to participants when and where they need it. Mobile interventions proactively push content to participants without requiring them to visit a computer.
37 The 
proactive outreach of mobile interventions is especially critical given the limited use (engagement) of websites 
found in tobacco cessation interventions.38-40 
The term mHealth has even been coined to refer to programs that are delivered via mobile communication 
devices.41,42 While the term “mobile” has come to describe portable technology devices, Beale has asserted 
that the user is mobile, not just the technology: “…it is about computing for users who are not in a single 
location, but are moving around…computing whilst on the go as well as when at their destinations.”[ADDRESS_335959] been promising.44 Although NCI public health 
initiatives (e.g., QuitGuide, QuitSTART) are currently available, they have not been evaluated for efficacy. 
Given the increased reach of mobile- based interventions, coupled with evidence that internet -based delivery 
systems migh t be an effective method for delivering cognitive dissonance interventions, suggests that a 
cognitive dissonance mobile app for smoking cessation might be a feasible and novel treatment approach. It is 
important to note that even modest absolute abstinence rates can translate into very significant public health 
impact (reach X effic acy) given the large number of tobacco users who could be reached through mobile 
interventions.45,[ADDRESS_335960] been developed and tested. For example, in their study of female college s tudents with 
body dissatisfaction, Stice, Durant, Rohde & Shaw53 evaluated the use of an internet -based program for the 
prevention of eating disorders. This study found that the internet -based participants showed significant 
reductions in eating disorder risk factors and symptoms compared to the control conditions at 1 - and 2- year 
follow- ups. More recently, Chithambo and Huey54 developed and tested an eating disorder prevention 
intervention delivered in a web- based format. Results indicated that both of the internet -based interventions 
produced significantly greater reductions in body dissatisfaction, thin- ideal internalization, and depression 
compared to the no intervention control condition.  
Although it is difficult to draw strong conclusions from the emerging research on electronically delivered 
interventions because of the limited number of studies and differences in methodologies –  including the extent 
to which online programs were supplemented by [CONTACT_275168] (in- person or phone calls) or pharmaceutical 
supplements – overall conclusions of these meta- analyses support the superiority of web- based interventions 
compared to non- web-based interventions across a broad range of health behaviors.52,[ADDRESS_335961], a recent Cochrane meta -analysis of web- based cessation studies concluded that “…more 
rigorous studies comparing the long- term effects of Internet interventions with non- Internet interventions or no 
intervention at all are needed in order to determine the true long- term effectiveness of the internet as a tool for 
smoking cessation.”[ADDRESS_335962] dissonance induction- based mobile app for smoking cessation. Second, the proposed study focuses on 
both the initiation of quit attempts, as well as overall quit rates. The dual focus on increasing quit attempts and 
smoking cessation rates will help to inform the scientific knowledge of proximal outcomes that might inform 
intervention efforts aimed at more distal outcomes. And finally, the mobile app -based format – if shown to be 
successful at improving smoking quit rates –  lends itself to improved accessibility across all classes of 
smokers. One significant limitation of existing face- to-face cognitive dissonance- based programs is cost and 
limited a ccess to treatment for individuals without transportation. We believe that our program will be very 
attractive, as the mobile app- based format can greatly expand reach –  both as a standalone program and as 
an adjunct to existing interventions. The mobile a pp intervention is also likely to appeal to underserved 
smokers and younger smokers who use their mobile phones for internet access and who frequently download apps for various personal interests and supports. Given the need for innovative smoking cessation programs 
that are low -cost and easy to access, the social impact of the proposed CDI intervention is high.  
D. APPROACH 
D.1. Overview  
The primary goal of the proposed Phase I project is to develop and evaluate a cognitive dissonance mobile 
app intervention for smoking cessation (CDI). The CDI app will build upon previous tobacco cessation 
treatment conducted by [CONTACT_15957]- I Severson and Consultant Simmons, on the substance abuse cessation and 
mobile -app treatment research conducted by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_275149]- I Severson, and on the cognitive dissonance 
intervention research conducted by [CONTACT_15957]- I Yokum. Given our extensive experience developi[INVESTIGATOR_275150], as well as developi[INVESTIGATOR_275151], we will focus our energy on effectively integrating these areas of study into an easy -to- 
administer mobile app intervention progr am that is attractive and  engaging.

Richard Brown, PhD, Consultant for this project, is an expert in tobacco cessation and has conducted 
extensive work in innovative smoking cessation studies. He has collaborated with [CONTACT_275176] on several previous grants, including both web and mobile app programs for tobacco cessation.  
D.3. Contractors  
Twenty Ideas.  Mike Biglan  and the Twenty Ideas team have a successful history of developi[INVESTIGATOR_185152] - 
and mobile- app based interventions. Team members at Twenty Ideas have designed and built hundreds of 
web-based and mobile apps, including those funded by [CONTACT_4289], the Department of Education and the National 
Science Foundation. They have been involved in developi[INVESTIGATOR_275154]- related mobile apps, and have 
extensive experience utilizing the SBIR funding mechanism.  
D.4. Phase I SBIR Project Timeline, Benchmarks, and Procedures  
This Phase I SBIR will be conducted in two stages: 1) Product development and usability testing, and 2) 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124]. Stage 1 and Stage 2 are outlined below and are expected to take approximately 6 months each.  
D.4.a. Stage 1: Product Development  
Our approach to developi[INVESTIGATOR_275155]: (1) the 
work of Drs. Smith and Severson in developi[INVESTIGATOR_275156] - and mobile- app based 
approaches for tobacco and substance cessation programs, (2) the prior research of [CONTACT_275177] in designing and examining cognitive dissonance interventions, and (3) the considerable prior work of [CONTACT_156760] in 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_275157].  
The proposed CDI intervention will consist of 9 modules that will be delivered via mobile app. During Stage 
1, we plan to develop the initial 3 modules of the CDI app in order to examine the feasibility and usability of the app; the remaining 6 modules are proposed to be developed during a Phase II SBIR application. As outlined 
previously, three concepts are central to eliciting cognitive dissonance: voluntariness, effortful involvement, and counter -attitudinal advocacy. Building on the cognitive dissonance work by [CONTACT_15957] -I Yokum and Consultant 
Simmons, we have carefully integrated these concepts into the proposed session modules. We have included each of the three components into each module. Based on the strong relationship between counter -attitudinal 
advocacy  and cognitive dissonance found in previous studies,
6,7 we included the need to make a public 
statement – either in letter format or verbal statements to family and friends –  in each module as well. Given 
that Consultant Simmons found reduced smoking rates  after one two- hour intervention with unmotivated 
smokers who made one public video statement of their negative beliefs of smoking, we believe that the proposed format of implementing all three components into each of nine modules will sufficiently increas e the 
opportunity for dissonance induction. An overview of the core components and their relationship to dissonance 
induction is outlined in the Curriculum Table in Human Subjects.  
Investigators will work with the technical team at Twenty Ideas, a trusted and experienced technology 
vendor who has a team that has developed previously -tested substance use cessation programs. Twenty 
Ideas will build a complete program with new infrastructure, logic, and information architecture using and 
JavaScript scripting combined with HTML and CSS. Animation and interactive content will use DHTML 
(Dynamic HTML). During development and deployment, the project database will be housed at a secure web 
facility on Amazon Web Services in a PostgreSQL database on a server running a Linux -based operating 
system. Data from the mobile app will interface with the project database through TLS (Transport Layer Security) encrypted by [CONTACT_275169]. Researchers will have secure access to project data—including participant 
reports and management utilities —through an administrative interface built on Node.js technologies. These 
fully automated, stand -alone, technology -based interventions will work appropriately on popular , modern Web 
browsers on both Macintosh and Windows computers.  
In order to maximize reach with our intervention, we have structured the primary experience for the users 
to be on their mobile smartphone. A core pi[INVESTIGATOR_275158] a participant to watch a video, post it in a small public support group forum  that we assign them to that includes approximately 8 participants, and then 
easily respond to their small group with encouraging and supportive comments. In addition, this model works 
well even if the group lives in various parts of the country and doesn' t require geographically proximate groups. 
Groups of participants will be designated on a rolling basis, where a “group” will be assigned for every 8 participants enrolled. Twenty Ideas has extensive experience creating “work groups” and chat rooms for web-  
and mobile- app programs.  
 
Research Strategy   
  
To implement the platform, Twenty Ideas has provided an architectural schematic that fits the necessary 
participant experience for the study, the data needs, as well as the budget submitted. With over fifteen years of 
experience designing and developi[INVESTIGATOR_275159], including numerous behavioral 
interventions, the Twenty Ideas team is confident with this approach. In addition, the team has experience in 
the development of video playback and recording solutions such as the Marco Polo video chat that works with 
millions of users. For this project, we plan to use the framework Ionic that works on both iOS (i.e. iPhones) as 
well as Android devices. To support easy video recording embedded into the App, our plan is to use the Ziggeo 
video recording Software Development Kit (SDK). Lastly, as participants use the App, their information will be 
stored off of the devices so we will use the Node.js framework and PostgreSQL database to collect, store, and 
make accessible key study data.  
D.4.1.a.  Focus groups  (N=20)  
We will incorporate an iterative formative process involving two focus groups of [ADDRESS_335963] well -developed 
ideas for the “look and feel” of the program, which will aid in our initial mockups of the concepts, and graphics 
for the intervention modules. We will present these ideas and graphics to the i nitial focus group and use their 
feedback to refine the materials for a second focus group of participants that are representative of the target audience for the program.  
Based on feedback from the first focus group, we will develop prototype versions of the program using 
Marvel, a design and rapid prototype development tool that yields functional mockups for users to interact with 
before any programming takes place. During an iterative process we will refine the mockups, present them to 
five test users, solicit their feedback, and continue to modify and refine the mockups until we arrive at an 
acceptable design and feature set. Session transcripts will be assessed both manually and using Atlast.ti,
57,[ADDRESS_335964]. Participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_335965] for their participation in focus groups or usability testing.  
D.4.1.b.  Usability Testing  (N=5)  
We will present the initial prototype to five test users for preliminary usability testing in which the participant 
will be observed using the program and then asked to talk aloud about their experience to help us better 
understand ease of navigation and p rogram use. Observations and interviews with usability participants is a 
great help in discovering potential problems with program navigation comprehension of key concepts and interactive activities. Mobile app- based components will embody established usability standards and will 
adhere to their recently emerging usability guidelines. Individual test sessions will be held, with hands -on use 
of functioning program components. Based on our observations and interviews we will move on to conduct a more complete programming of the proposed intervention and prepare for pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124]. One unique feature of 
the CDI program will be the use of video for making public statements about attitudes, beliefs and intentions.  
The usability testing will allow us to fully test the use of the video feature with adult participants who currently 
smoke. The program will be used by [CONTACT_275170]. The key features that need testing will be the video components 
that are recorded and posted by [CONTACT_4317]. We will test the ability of participants to upload video to the app 
and our ability to view and upload the video to their support g roup. The platform will allow us to view and 
monitor the video before it is shared with the support group of peers.  
D.4.2.  Stage 2: Product Evaluation  (N=60)  
We will conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_275160] 30 male and 30 female adult smokers (N=60).  
Feasibility, usability, participant satisfaction, and pre- /post - intervention outcomes of smoking will be evaluated 
in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Data on: 1) frequency and duration of app use, 2) number of modules completed, 3) cognitive 
dissonance and motivation to  quit, and 4) smoking attitudes and behavior, including motivation to quit, quit 
attempts, and number of days without smoking (smokefree days), will be examined pre-  and post -intervention. 
Participants will be compensated using gift cards to Amazon in the following increments: $30 for the baseline 
assessment, $35 for the 1- month assessment, and $[ADDRESS_335966] 
 
 
 extensive experience utilizing recruitment efforts to enroll smokers and tobacco users in mobile app -
based intervention programs. Inclusion criteria will be as follows: 1) age 18 or older, 2) self -reported daily 
smoking, 3) having a valid home mailing addr ess, 4) English- speaking, 5) access to a smartphone with 
video capability for the duration of the project, 6) not currently enrolled in or participating in any tobacco 
cessation programs, and  
7) expressed desire to quit smoking.  
D.5. Data Collection  Procedures 
D.5.1.  Overview and timeline for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. In the proposed evaluation study, a total of 60 
participants will be recruited and baseline assessed during Year 1. We anticipate that approximately 10-
25% of these will fail to complete the study; however, we will employ an intent -to-treat analysis strategy, 
which will include all participants. We w ill conduct baseline assessments immediately after enrollment 
and consent; all measures completed at [ADDRESS_335967] of questionnaires administered using Qualtrics; none of the assessments will be done via the 
mobile app.  
The 1- month assessment will focus on usability, cognitive dissonance, motivation to quit, and short 
term outcomes such as making a quit attempt, use of the app (dosage), number of cigarettes smoked, 
and days abstinent from smoking. For the 3- month assessment, the focus will be on cessation outcomes, 
including both point prevalence (i.e., no smoking in the past 7 days; no smoking in the past 30 days) and 
sustained abstinence, which is defined as sustained abstinence between the [ADDRESS_335968] for the one 
month assessment and there will be a 30 day window for completion of the 3- month assessment.  
D.5.2.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_275161]. Program navigation and usability will be assessed during usability 
testing and for the evaluation participants over the one month of use, and will include reports of: 1) ease 
of use, 2) perceived benefits of using the app, and 3) suggestions for product development 
modifications. Participants will also provide ratings on product satisfaction and usability on a 7- point 
Likert Scale. Qualitative data gathered from the focus groups will be recorded and evaluated with the 
goal of identifyi ng challenges to using the app, product satisfaction, and suggested modifications. This 
information will then be used to guide adaptations in a Phase II SBIR application. In addition to 
qualitative data, login tracking information from the app will be used to assess each participant’s: 1) frequency and duration of app use, 2) number of modules completed, and 3) type and frequency of 
substance use. These data will be used to evaluate treatment engagement and adherence, as well as 
pre- and post - changes in tobacco  use. 
A full description of measures is included in the Human Subjects. Briefly, the following will be used to 
examine pre-  and post - changes in smoking behavior, cognitive dissonance, and motivation to quit: 1) 
Nicotine Dependence, 2) Past and Current Tobacco U se, 3) Motivation to Quit, 4) Quit Attempts, and 5) 
Cognitive Dissonance. Nicotine dependence will be measured at baseline and at each follow -up 
assessment using the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence
[ADDRESS_335969] for non -normally 
distributed outcomes. We also propose ancillary analysis (e.g., dose -response) to bolster our confidence 
in the non -experimental design. Details of our analytic approach, approach to missing data, power 
analysis (power >.[ADDRESS_335970] medium effects (d=.39) for pre- post change), and feasibility benchmarks 
are provided in Statistical Design and Power  in the Human Subjects.

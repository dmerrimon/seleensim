Introduction / Rationale of the Study  
 
Hepatitis C and Adherence  
  
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a very important  health problem worldwide. Majority of the 
estimated 160 million people infected globally  are unaware of their affliction [1]. It is a leading 
cause of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In the [LOCATION_002] 
alone, HCV infection is the most common chronic blood-borne infection, affecting about 3.2 
million individuals [2]. It is most prevalent among persons born from 1945-1965, most of whom 
acquired it in the 1970’s and 1980’s, since identification of HCV only occurred in 1989 as 
specific pathogen and blood products screening for the virus was non-existent [4]. Because at 
least 80% of those who acquire HCV will become chronically infected, it is the number one 
cause of chronic liver disease and liver cancer in the U.S. [3], and has surpassed HIV in terms of 
number of deaths [5] and the approximate U.S. economic burden is about $6.5 billion, inclusive 
of patients needing liver transplantation [2].  
 
Steps have been taken to decrease this present and future healthcare and economic burden. 
Shortly after discovery of the virus, blood and blood-derived products started to be screened 
which led to a dramatic decrease in new incident cases. By 2001, the Needlestick Safety and 
Prevention Act was passed in the U.S., further deceasing new cases [7]. The CDC has also 
recommended a one-time screening for persons born between 1945 and 1965, as this segment of 
the population is at increased risk for HCV infection due to non-screening of blood products 
before 1989. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_37104], the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) 
estimates there are still about 17,000 new cases occurring yearly [3].  
 
Treatment of HCV has been the main focus of clinical research since vaccine research has 
proved to be difficult, as well as the necessity of treating undiagnosed individuals. Among the [ADDRESS_1272584] 
treatment for HCV was a combination of once-weekly injectable Pegylated Interferon with daily 
Ϯ 
 
Protocol Version Ϭϵ-Mar-ϮϬϭϲ  oral Ribavirin to be taken for 48 weeks. The cure rate, measured as sustained virologic response 
(SVR) for this regimen is a dismal 40-50% [6]. Adherence to the treatment was difficult for 
many patients due to the length of therapy and the associated side effects of both interferon and 
ribavirin. The addition of new directly acting agents (DAA), Boceprevir and Telaprevir in 2011, 
revolutionized HCV treatment, increasing cure rates up to 75%. However, adherence continued 
to plague therapy because of side effects and thrice-daily dosing.  
 
In 2013, 2 new DAA’s were FDA -approved, ushering in the interferon-free era of HCV therapy. 
Sofosbuvir and Simprevir are once daily oral agents with much fewer side effects than any 
previous anti-HCV medication. Ledipasvir, another oral DAA, has been approved by [CONTACT_906304] 2014, to be given as a single tablet regimen together with Sofosbuvir. The length of 
treatment has also decreased, from 48 weeks to 12-24 weeks, and clinical trials of the 
combination of these drugs showed cure rates above 90%, with increased tolerability and safety 
[8]. Other DAA’s since then have been approved by [CONTACT_906305]/paritaprevir/ritonavir (Viekira Pak) and Grazopravir/Elbasvir ( Zepatier).  
 
are in clinical trials or under FDA review, increasing the chances that more patients can be cured 
from HCV infection.  
 
Adherence, however, has been a major challenge in the treatment of Hepatitis C infection, 
especially before Sofosbuvir and Simprevir were introduced. Aside from side effects, Ribavirin 
has to be taken twice daily, while Interferon is injectable. Boceprevir and Telaprevir also had 
their fair share of side effects, drug interactions and multiple daily dosing which impaired 
treatment adherence. Studies on these medications have shown that the proportion of missed 
doses increases over time, and are associated with failure of treatment [11-14]. In one analysis of 
2 clinical trials, patients who took their medications  80-85% of the time achieved SVR 86-90% 
of the time, while those < 80% adherent attained SVR only 8-32% of the time [28]. Aside from 
HCV medication-related issues, these patients may have other co-morbidities such as psychiatric 
disorders which can negatively influence patient compliance [18]. The matter of polypharmacy 
in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV can also be a major concern in terms of adherence 
[19].  
 
Treatment adherence studies for Hepatitis C were mostly small studies of patients taking 
Pegylated-Interferon and Ribavirin [11-14]. These reports showed higher treatment success for 
patients who were at least 80-90% compliant, with most failures reported in patients with 
compliance rate around 70-80%. However, most of these also relied on patient self-reporting, pi[INVESTIGATOR_906288], which are inherently imprecise.  
 
With the enhanced tolerability, lower drug-drug interactions, side effect profile and once daily 
dosing of the new DAA’s, adherence has improved but is still an area of  concern. In registration 
clinical trials, those who relapsed on Sofosbuvir were patients who did not comply to thei r 
treatment regimen [15]. The same holds true for Simeprevir, and these patients also developed 
resistant HCV [16]. With the standard 12-weeks  course of these medications costing in the range 
ϯ 
 
Protocol Version Ϭϵ-Mar-ϮϬϭϲ  of $100,000 - $140,000, patients needing repeat treatment after relapsing can be very expensive 
[10], making treatment compliance even more important. It would also be very costly for 
treatment-experienced patients to be re-treated because of failure due to compliance.  
 
We are conducting this study in the hope that we can ensure medication adherence to effectively 
and cost-effectively treat patients afflicted with chronic Hepatitis C infection. We have chosen 
HCV since the treatment is finite course (i.e. 12 weeks)  which will enable us to measure the 
efficacy of using Medication Electronic Monitoring System (MEMS) with real-time feedback in 
terms of increasing adherence within a specific time limit.  For this study, we are going to use 
Grazopravir/ Elbasvir  (Zepatier), which has an inherent advantage of being a combination pi[INVESTIGATOR_906289] a day.  
 
 
 
Medication Electronic Monitoring System (MEMS)  
 
Medication Electronic Monitoring System (MEMS) has been used to measure patient 
compliance to treatment more accurately, especially in clinical trials. It has been determined to 
be a valid and objective tool to measure medication adherence [24]. Its use to improve 
compliance has been studied in patients with HIV [20-24], heart failure [26], smoking cessation 
therapy [27], and in the treatment of alcohol dependence [28]. A few studies have used MEMS in 
syringes and pi[INVESTIGATOR_906290]-HCV medication intake [14, 17], but data 
review and feedback to the patient were only done at each study visit. Real- time health care 
provider- to-patient feedback may be able to decrease non-adherence but  robust studies in this 
area are still lacking.  
 
There are several different types and manufacturers of commercially available MEMS. 
For this study, we are proposing to use the Portal724-MEMS Service. The Portal724-MEMS is a 
TURNKEY SERVICE.  It integrates medication bottle, Smart Cap, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_906291], Embedded 
Computer, Embedded Cellular Modem and Tamper Proof apparatus.  This device is capable of 
transmitting pi[INVESTIGATOR_906292]’s home to the Cloud over Cellular and IP 
networks.  The transmission is done in real time if cellular coverage is above 1-bar, but if cell is 
not available or if the signal is below threshold, then the device Store-and-Forward feature is 
automatically activated.  
The bottle cap records the number of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_906293], with date and time and Device ID. The 
purpose of this electronic monitoring is to estimate compliance with medication regimen.  
Electronic assisted compliance is not the sole indicator of MEMS, it is also used in conjunction 
with answers about demographics, clinical state and symptoms to learn more about the patient 
characteristics that influence whether a medication regimen is adhered to.  
Portal724-MEMS is HIPAA Complaint and ISO27001 Certified.  The Electronic Data Capture, 
the Data Transfer and Data Access are all confidential and Secure in every stage of the Data 
ϰ 
 
Protocol Version Ϭϵ-Mar-ϮϬϭϲ  Flow Model. The device to be used in this study is a Smart Cap with Pi[INVESTIGATOR_906294].  
 
 
Objective  
Primary: To determine the effect of the use of Portal724-MEMS Service on medication 
adherence in the treatment of Hepatitis C patients with grazopravir/elbasvir with or without 
Ribavirin, defined as compliance to regimen  95% of the time.

Enrollment  
 
Upon signing the informed consent, the following data will be gathered prior to start of 
treatment: demographic data such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, highest educational attainment,  
employment status, co-morbid conditions as documented in the patient’s records, current 
medications, vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], temperature), CBC with 
differential count, complete metabolic panel, 12-Lead Electrocardiogram (EKG), Cardiac stress 
test results if applicable, echocardiogram results if applicable, , BMI, baseline HCV RNA PCR

Protocol Version Ϭϵ-Mar-ϮϬϭϲ  viral load, HCV genotype, baseline HCV resistance testing (if indicated), results of the 
Fibroscan ® test or liver biopsy.  
 
Once the informed consent is signed and the patient is deemed eligible for treatment, the 
patient will be randomized to either ARM 1 or ARM 2 in a 1:1 ratio.  ARM 1 will be prescribed 
elbasvir ir/grazoprevir with/or without ribavirin for 12 or 16 weeks 1 tablet daily with MEMS 
Smart Cap with real-time monitoring.  Arm 2: elbasvir/grazoprevir with/or without ribavirin for 
[ADDRESS_1272589] each pi[INVESTIGATOR_831890], it also will transmit an alert to the 
aforementioned website when the bottle is not opened within 2 hours of the agreed upon time. 
This alert is then seen by [CONTACT_906308] a computer or their 
smartphone. The Investigator or Research Assistant in turn calls the cellular phone provided to 
the patient to remind the participant to take their medication, thus providing real-time feedback. 
Group 2 (the control group) will be provided MEMS Smart Cap to record study drug bottle 
opening, but without real-time feedback and will be managed as per the standard of care at the 
Liver Center SMMC.  
 
Patients from both groups will be seen in the Liver Center at Day 1, weeks 2, 4, [ADDRESS_1272590]-treatment. At that time, an HCV RNA PCR 
viral load will be obtained to determine if patient has an undetectable viral load, or Sustained 
Virologic Response (SVR). SVR is the marker for a functional cure of HCV , or treatment 
success. Non-SVR would mean treatment failure.

Toxicity management  
 
 
Grazoprevir/elbasvir  
The following side effects have been reported when MK-5172 in doses ranging from 25 mg to 800 
mg or placebo (a tablet that looks the same as the MK-5172 but has no active ingredient) was given 
for up to 12 continuous weeks to 389 HCV-infected men and women at the same time as other 
drugs commonly given to HCV patients (pegylated interferon and ribavirin).   These side effects 
were considered to be related to the treatment. 
  
• Decrease in the blood cells that carry 
oxygen 
• Decrease in blood cells that fight 
infection  
• Stomach pain  
• Diarrhea 
• Upset stomach 
• Dry mouth  
• Nausea  
• Vomiting  
• Weakness  
• Chills  
• Fatigue  
• Flu-like illness  
• General pain  • Fever  
• Decreased appetite  
• Back pain 
• Muscle pain 
• Dizziness  
• Metallic taste 
• Headache 
• Trouble falling asleep or staying 
asleep 
• Feeling Irritable 
• Cough 
• Shortness of breath 
• Hair loss 
• Dry skin 
• Itchiness 
• Rash  
• Pain in the joints 
 
Most of these side effects were mild to moderate in intensity and short lived. While receiving MK-
5172 with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, about half the patients had increases in serum total 
bilirubin (a substance in your blood that is made in the body that is removed by [CONTACT_4852]) and these 
values decreased in these patients over time while continuing MK-5172.  In some patients, blood 
tests of the liver called 'transaminases' which may be related to liver injury were increa sed at or 
after [ADDRESS_1272591] MK-5172 doses (400 and 800 mg) given 
to patients in the study. In most patients the transaminase levels decreased after the dosing was 
stopped including in the patient who was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].   
 
In two treatment studies of MK-5172 given with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, three patients 
who received MK-5172 reported drug-related, serious side effects (a side effect that caused 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) while on MK-[ADDRESS_1272592] patient who received the 200 mg dose of MK-5172 reported severe anemia (a decreased 
number of red blood cells).  In all three cases the patients were treated for the serious side effec t 
which resolved.   
 
Fourteen patients have discontinued the MK-[ADDRESS_1272593].  In some cases 
the patients discontinued only MK-5172 and in other cases the patients discontinued all therapy.  
The side effects that led to the study drug being stopped included decrease in the blood cells that 
carry oxygen, increased bilirubin, low blood pressure, weakness, headache, flu-like illness,  
irritability, shortness of breath, dehydration, fear/nightmares, anxiety/depression, increased levels 
of transaminases, nausea, reactivation of chronic pancreatitis (inflammation of an abdominal 
gland) and myositis (inflammation of the muscles).  Not all of these side effects were considered 
to be related to MK-5172. 
 
Ribavirin  
COMMON ADVERSE EVENTS 
 
The most common side effects when taking ribavirin combined with pegylated interferon are flu-
like symptoms consisting of:  
• Body aches and pains  
• Fever  
• Chills  
• Headache  
• Overall feeling of sickness  
• Rash  
 
Other common side effects are: anxiety, mood changes, depression and irritability.  
The most serious side effect seen with RBV is anemia (a decrease in the number of red blood 
cells in your body that carry oxygen).   Which may cause tiredness and lack of energy.  Other side 
effects may occur which are not listed here or were not seen before.    
Ribavirin can cause severe damage and even death of an unborn child or fetus.   Extreme care 
should be taken to prevent pregnancy while you are taking RBV and afterwards.  Patients 
will be required to abstain from sexual course while taking ribavirin and for [ADDRESS_1272594] dose of ribavirin  
 
DILI 
In the event of a discontinuation of  grazoprevir/elbasvir for suspected DILI , other clinically 
significant liver chemistry elevations (defined under “Liver Chemistry Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_895620]", below), severe skin reaction or hypersensitivity reaction, subjects should not restart 
grazoprevir/elbasvir  due to the risk of a recurrent reaction; such subjects should be withdrawn 
from study and seek/be reviewed for alternative HCV  therapy.

Allergic Reaction  
Subjects may continue study medication for Grade I or [ADDRESS_1272595] the Investigator immediately if there 
is any worsening of symptoms or if further systemic signs or symptoms develop. 
Antihistamines, topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930],  or antipruritic agents may be  prescribed.  
 
Subjects with Grade 2/[ADDRESS_1272596] should be 
withdrawn from the study. Subjects should be treated as clinically appropriate and followed 
until resolution of the AE.  
 
Adverse events  
 
Adverse Experience (Event)  
An adverse experience means any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or 
chemistry of the body temporally associated with any use of the [COMPANY_006] product whether or not considered 
related to the use of the product.  Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse cha nge in 
frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with t he use of the 
product, is also an adverse experience.  
 
Serious Adverse Experience  
 
A serious adverse experience (SAE) is any adverse experience occurring at any dose that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening (places the subject/patient, in the view of the investigator, a t immediate risk of 
death from the experience as it occurred)  
• Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Other important medical events that may not result in death, not be life threatening, or not requi re 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse experience when, based upon appropriat e 
medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject/patient and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  Examples of such medical 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that did not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  
• Is an overdose (whether accidental or intentional)  
• Cancer (that is not the condition under the study)*

Ethics  
Institutional review board  
Before initiation  of the study, the Investigator(s)  will  submit the st udy protocol,  sample Informed 
Consent  Form, and  any other documents to the IRB  for approval.   The study will  not  commence until  
there  is full !RB approval.   All IRB regulatory  material  will  be properly  filed and available for review 
by [CONTACT_906309].  
  
 
Confidentiality  
 
         Patients will be assigned research participant numbers which will be used by [CONTACT_906310]. This number plus other data that will be collected from the 
participants will be kept in password-protected file, only accessible to the Investigator and 
Research Assistant. Data transmitted by [CONTACT_906311]724- MEMS Smart Cap will only be identified 
through the research participant number.  
 
  
Statistical  Analysis  
ϭϰ 
 
Protocol Version Ϭϵ-Mar-ϮϬϭϲ   
 This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_906301]. Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be used to compare Groups 1 and 2 in terms of 
achieving adherence  95%. SVR between the groups will also be analyzed in the same manner. 
A descriptive analysis will be done outlining patients’ profiles. Fischer’s exact test will be used 
to compare baseline characteristics between Groups 1 and 2.  
 
 
Scientific Data Dissemination  
 
It is the intention of the study investigators to submit abstracts & present results of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_906302] (American Association for Study of Liver 
Diseases)  or DDW (Digestive Disease Week). The final results of study will be submitted for 
publication in a major peer reviewed medical  journal in Infectious Diseases or Gastroenterology 
as deemed appropriate at the end of study.  
 
 
Significance  of  Research Outcomes  
 
 
The findings of this research study will have significant implications on our understanding of 
patient adherence to treatment and health care outcomes. If the use of MEMS technology proves 
feasible &  useful in this inner city environment  based on this pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], the investigators 
envision embarking on a larger research initiative to fully use the technology in patients with 
HCV , HIV and other chronic infectious and non-infectious disease conditions.

1.[ADDRESS_193991] -market  clinical follow -up study is to evaluate safety endpoints in  
patients receiving PhotoFix® Decellularized Bovine Pericardium (PhotoFix) as a patch within a 
vascular repair  or reconstruction procedure.  PhotoFix is prepared from bovine pericardium, 
which is stabilized using a dye -mediated photo -oxidation process and sterilized using aseptic 
processing techniques.  The primary endpoint for patients with carotid artery stenosi s (CAS) 
undergoing carotid endarterectomies (CEA) will be rate of ipsilateral central neurologic events; 
the primary endpoint for all other vascular procedures will be primary patency.  The secondary 
endpoints include all -cause reoperation rate, device -related reoperation rate, explant rate, 
restenosis rate, secondary patency (hemodialysis access repair (HAR) only) and survival.  A goal 
of [ADDRESS_193992] (IRB) approval and site activation.  
Candidates for this study are adults who require vascular repair or reconstruction surgery that 
necessitates the use of a patch.  Patients will be consented pre -operatively and enrolled patients  
will be followed for approximately 6 months after PhotoFix surgery.  Data will be collected at 5 
time points: baseline (pre -operatively), intra -operatively, [ADDRESS_193993]-market, prospective evaluation of photo -oxidized decellularized   PHF1801.000 -M(04/18)

1.[ADDRESS_193995]-market clinical follow -up study is to evaluate  the clinical outcomes of 
patients receiving PhotoFix  as a patch  within a vascular r epair  or reconstruction  procedure.  
 
1.5 Clinical Background   
Vascular  disease is a p revalent medical issue , which can require affected patients to undergo 
surgery .  The need for surgery is dependent on the indication, but can be required  to reestablish 
blood flow , repair weakened artery walls, or create hemodialysis access.  These surgeri es can  
require the use of a vascular  patch to close or repair  defects; primary suture closure is not always 
an option.   
 
Incidence Rates : 
Vascular surgery is r equired for a variety of  indications.  A large percentage of vascular surgeries 
are performed du e to CAS , peripheral  artery disease (PAD), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) 
and HAR  in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD).  These combined conditions  represent 
a large population of individuals.  Not all patients require surgical intervention; how ever, many 
patients, including those who are asymptomatic , will undergo surgery  to prevent p otential long 
term complications .   
 
The prevalence of CAS has been reported to affect  3.4% and 4.2% of females and males, 
respectively.1 The prevalence of CAS vari es by [CONTACT_545], with increased risk in Caucasians and 
Native Americans.1 The worldwide prevale nce of PAD has been estimated  at greater than 200 
million people.2 A recent meta -analysis estimated a pooled prevalence for AAA to be 4.8%, with 
obvious global varian ce, with higher prevalence in Australia compared to America and Europe.3   
 
Lastly, the worldwide number of patients who received renal replacement therapy (RRT)  was 
recently estimated as 2.6 million.  A conservative estimate determined that the number who  
received RRT  vastly underestimates the total who need it; an estimated 4.[ADDRESS_193996]-market, prospective evaluation of photo -oxidized decellularized   PHF1801.000 -M(04/18)  
bovine pericardium used as a patch in vascular repair  and reconstruction  surgery  
CryoLife, Inc.    Page 3 of 61 Confidentia l Alternative Treatments for Vascular  Surgery Requiring Patch Material:   
Currently available patch materials include vein patches (saphenous or neck veins) and synthetic 
patches (polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), Dacron, or bovine pericardium).  Select ion of the ideal 
patch material is a debated topic; anatomical characteristics, availability, comorbidities, and 
patch indication are considered within th e selection process .  The theoretical benefit of 
autologous patches include an increase in luminal siz e, provision of endothelialized tissue to the 
patch site,  less thrombogenicity, and increased resistance to infection.[ADDRESS_193997] been used as an 
alternative; early criticisms of these patches included prolonged hemostasis time and increased 
thrombosis.5   
 
Clinical Results in Alternative Treatments : 
There are numerous studies  reporting resu lts of vascular patches  for cases of  CAS requiring 
CEA .  These studies have compared  outcomes between patches and direct suture, as well as 
outcomes  between different  patch  materials.  
 
A recent systematic review and meta -analysis compared CEA outcomes over multiple studies.[ADDRESS_193998] the 10 studies, patches included saphenous vein patches (n=3), 
synthetic patches (n=3), and combined v ein and synthetic (PTFE or Dacron) (n=4).6   Procedures 
using patches significantly reduced the risk of perioperative stroke and long -term stroke (OR = 
0.49, p = 0.02) .6  The use of patches also reduced the risks of perioperative arterial occlusion (OR 
= 0.18, p < 0.0011) and long -term recurrent stenosis (OR = 0.24, p < 0.01).6  Aggregate r esult s 
from 9 studies were also compared in a meta -analysis; studies reported the comparison of vein 
and PTFE patches.  Perioperative and long term rates of stroke, ipsil ateral stroke, combined 
stroke and death and mortality were not different between groups.6    Aggregate r esults from 4 
studies compared Dacron to other synthetic patches.6    At 30 days, Dacron was associated with 
higher risk of perioperative stroke and tr ansient ischemic attack (TIA) (p=0.03) and restenosis 
(p=0.004).6  There was also significantly more strokes (p=0.03), combined stroke and death 
(p=0.02), and arterial restenosis (p<0.001) with Dacron during longer term follow -up. 
 
Marien et al. compared p eri and post -operative outcomes between CEA patients who received 
bovine pericardium (n=51) and Dacron (n=44).7 Suture  line bleeding at 3 minutes and 4 minutes 
was significantly higher in the Dacron group (55% vs. 14%, p<0.001, 30% vs. 4%, p=0.001 
respecti vely).7 The surgeons also reported that bovine pericardium had superior handling 
characteristics compared to Dacron.7   
 
There is limited published data comparing vascular patch outcomes in surgeries for AAA, PAD 
or HAR .  One small retrospective study comp ared patency outcomes in HAR with stenting  
(n=34)  vs. patch angioplasty  (n=15) .[ADDRESS_193999] -interventional patency and patency after 
secondary reintervention were  not statistically different between patients who received a patch 
and those who were stente d; however, patch angioplasty trended towards reduced patency after 
second reintervention.[ADDRESS_194000]-market, prospective evaluation of photo -oxidized decellularized   PHF1801.000 -M(04/18)  
bovine pericardium used as a patch in vascular repair  and reconstruction  surgery  
CryoLife, Inc.    Page 4 of 61 Confidentia l PhotoFix Decellularized Bovine Pericardium : 
There is still a need for vascular patches with mechanical properties that mimic natural tissue, 
resist deterioration and do not increase the risk for restenosis and other device -related 
complications.  PhotoFix offers another option to vein patches and other synthetic patches, 
specifically, glutaraldehyde t reated xenografts.  PhotoFix tissue is treated through dye -mediat ed 
photo -oxidation ; the processing  stabilizes the internal collagen structure while eliminating toxic 
by-products which allow calcium to bind to the tissue.  Dye-mediated photo -oxidation was first 
described i n the medical literature in the 1990’s.9 The treated tissue was described as “stable 
toward chemical, enzymatic, and in vivo degradation while maintaining physical properties of 
natural tissue”.9 Moore  expanded on the PhotoFix process in 2001 by [CONTACT_166921] “biostable, biocompatib le, relatively nonclacific, and flexible”.10  
 
Biomechanical  Testing Results:  
PhotoFix mechanical testing  has demonstrated that the patch  is either superior or comparable to 
currently marketed patches  in terms of  tear resistance strength, ultimate tensile strength, suture 
retention, and ball burst strength.   Testing was completed on CryoLife -manufactured product and 
evaluated the device’s average force of failure.  The average maximum load for suture retention, 
ultimate tensile strength, ball burst strength , and tear resistance were 8.39  N, 15.6  N, 309.85  N, 
and 7.3  N, respectively.  
 
Biocompatibility Results : 
Biocompatibility testing was performed under the guidance from ISO [ADDRESS_194001] and its intended use (i.e. permanent exposure of product in contact [CONTACT_166922]).  The full 
battery of tests supports the biocompatibility of the device . 
 
Preclinical Results:  
PhotoFix  (formerly CardioFix) was imp lanted in a rat subcutaneous study which concluded that 
the test article had excellent biostability (greater than 71%) and low to minimal calcification.

2.6 Identification of Critical Components  
The PhotoFix primary packaging system consists of the container (Nalgene bottle), which stores 
the tissue in 22% buffered ethanol solution, and the closure (screw on cap us ing a torque limited 
closure device) which prevents leakage of the solution.  A tamper evident shrink band is then 
applied around the bottle and the cap.

PhotoFix safety  outcomes in vascular repair  and reconstruction  surgery .  This is an observational 
study on a cu rrently marketed device; no study activities are experimental.  
 
3.2 Study Size  & Duration  
Patients will be enrolled at approximately  10 sites .  The enrollment period will s pan the time 
needed to consent approximately 166  patients .  The target sample size is 10 0; projected 
enrollment considers a screen failure rate of 3 3% an d an early termination rate of 1 0%.  
Enrollment is estimated to take a minimum of [ADDRESS_194006] (IRB) 
approval and site activation .  Enrollment will begin at the pr incipal investigator’s site  and in 
agreement with all central and local IRB requirements.  The enrollment period will continue until 
the Sponsor decides to stop enrollment.  The Sponsor will activate additional sites at their 
discretion.  
 
A singular anatom ical region will be selected for patch use.  More than one patch can be used 
within the repair or reconstruction of this target region.  However, patients requiring patches at 
distinct anatomical regions will be excluded.  Additionally, p atients undergoing  concomitant 
procedures requiring additional prosthetics  (e.g. stents)  will be excluded.   For complex cases, 
where clarification on the se criteria is required, the Sponsor should be contact[CONTACT_166923].

window  is allow ed for schedule fluctuations, but visits should ideally remain at the intended  
intervals.   Data will also be collecte d on any unscheduled events (i.e. re operation , explants, etc.) 
which may occur during the study period.  
 
Patient  demographics and  medical history , including medications,  comorbidities, pertinent 
surgical history,  and fundamental vascular  diagnosis, will be  collected at time of consent.  
Medications will only include drugs of interest and will not require a complete listing.  Adverse 
events will be collected after surgery on all patients consented and  enrolled into the study .  The 
investigation will be conduc ted for a period  necessary to collect a ll follow -up, as needed on each 
patient , but will not exceed 7 months  after surgery .  The total time a patient will be followed will 
be determined by [CONTACT_166924]; dates of surgery should occur within 60 days  of consent.

4.1 Anticipated Complications  
For this study, a complication is defined as the following:  morbid event or consequences of a 
morbid event.  While all complications will be summariz ed in the fi nal report, the primary focus 
of the analysis will  be complications  involving the vascular system,  such as transient ischemic 
attack  (TIA) , amaurosis fugax, stroke, symptomatic carotid occlusion , thrombosis, bleeding, and 
death .  The terms “adv erse event” and “complication” will be used interchangeably.  
 
An Adverse Event (AE), Unanticipated Adverse Effect (UAE) and Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
are defined in Appendix E.  All AEs, UAEs and SAEs that occur during the course of the study 
(until the completion of the final follow -up visit ), whether observed by [CONTACT_166930], and whether or not thought to be PhotoFix related, will be reported in detail on the 
Adverse Event  eCRF and followed to a satisfactory resolution.  The invest igator will follow the 
patient until the event resolves.  In the unusual circumstance that the event has not resolved by 
[CONTACT_166931] ’s completion of the study, an explanation will be entered on the Adverse 
Event  eCRF; the circumstance may be de termined to be a permanent condition, and will be 
documented as such.   
 
Secondary morbid events will not be included in the calculation of device -related complication 
rates.  A morbid event should be documented only once unless there are multiple occurren ces of 
that event.  
 
Consequences of morbid events, such as explant, mortality, and reoperation will be captured on 
the Adverse Event eCRF , which details the associated event.   In the case of an explant, 
additional information will be captured on the Expla nt eCRF  (Appendix D) . 
 
Potential complications that may occur with any vascular surgery include, but are not limited to:  
 Allergic reaction to medication  
 Bleeding  
 Breathing difficulty  
 Chest pain  
 Heart attack  
 Infection  (ex. pneumonia, urinary tract infectio n, wound infection)  
 Irregular heartbeat  
 Lung or kidney failure  
 Memory loss  
 Pain 
 Sickness/ nausea   
 Stroke  
 Thrombosis  
 
Complications specific to the use of the PhotoFix may include, but are not limited to the 
following:   
 Abscess  
 Adhesion

 Calcification/mineralization  
 Complete heart block (arrhythmia)  
 Death  
 Inflammatory immune response  
 Infection  
 Intimal hyperplasia  
 Rejection  
 Tissue damage/degradation  
 Tissue failure or rupture  
 Toxic response/reaction  
 TSE trans mission/ variant Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease  
 
The likelihood of any complication is specific to the indication of surgery.  
 
4.2 Consequences of Morbid Events:  
Morbid events can result in m ortality  or the p ermanent cessation of all vital bodily functions.    
Morbi d events can also require r eoperation .  Reoperation  includes a ny operation that repairs, 
alters, or replaces a PhotoFix patch .  Morbid events can also require explant.  Explant includes 
any removal of the patch for any reason.   Details on the con sequences of any morbid event will 
be captured in the Adverse Event eCRF and Explant eCRF, as applicable (Appendix D).  
 
4.3 Reporting Expectations  
Adverse events will be reported per the following guidelines for all enrolled  patients:   
 
1. Any (potential) AE must be re ported to CryoLife as soon as possible, but no later  than [ADDRESS_194015] (i.e. vascular complications) must be reported 
to CryoLife within 24 hours after g aining knowledge of the event , by [CONTACT_166932] , 
in addition to entry into the EDC . 
3. De-identified source documentation (i.e., physicians/nurse notes or summaries) regarding 
an AE, UAE or SAE should be provided in addition to the eCRF.   The source d ocuments 
can be uploaded into the eCRF (as a single file) or sent by e -mail to CryoLife.  
4. Any patient  death will also be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF (requested death 
certificate and autopsy report, if performed, should also be provided).  
5. Additi onally, all events shall be reported to the reviewing IRB per their reporting 
 requirements (definitions and timelines).

CryoLife, Inc.    Page 14 of 61 Confidentia l 5 RISK/BENEFIT ANALYSI S 
 
5.1 Benefits  
A decellularized, photo -oxidized bovine pericardium potentially offers benefits similar to 
autologous pericardium ( i.e., similar  texture, nonimm unogenic, and biocompatible) without the 
disadvantages of glutaraldehyde treated tissue ; the additional (not naturally -occurring) aldehyde 
residue from glutaraldehy de can interact with surrounding tissue , which  leads to membrane 
damage and trappi[INVESTIGATOR_166906] (Ca2+) on residues .11  Design features of PhotoFix may increase 
the durability and functionality  of the device : 
 
 Photo -oxidation:  Processing c reates crosslink s and stabilize s the internal collagen 
structure, while eliminating toxic by -products that cre ate sites where calcium can bind to 
the tissue . 
 
The calcification potential of g lutaraldehyde -fixed bovine pericardium  is well known .[ADDRESS_194016] enormous potential 
for clinical use.  The long -term benefits of the unique features of PhotoFix are currently 
hypothetical.  
 
5.2 Risks  
Risks and complications related to vascular  surgery are extensively docum ented in the medical 
literature.  C omplications specific to the use of PhotoFix may include, but are not limited to, the 
following:  abscess, adhesion, blood leakag e through suture line/holes/ tears,  calcification  
/mineralization, complete heart block (arrhythmia), death, inflammatory immune response, 
infection, intimal hyperplasia, rejection, tissue damage  /degradation, tiss ue failure  /rupture, toxic 
response/reactio n, and TSE transmission/ variant Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease.   The likelihood of 
each event is dependent on the specific  surgical  indication . 
 
5.[ADDRESS_194017] consider all the risks and benefits to the patient on an indi vidual basis , 
when choosing a vascular  patch .  Efforts will be made to minimize these risks by [CONTACT_166933] i n vascular  surgery.  In addition, efforts will be made to 
ensure that the treatment and follow -up of all patients wi ll be consistent with current medical 
practice.  
 
All procedures will be performed on patient s who are candidates for vascular  surgery , requiring 
the use of a patch .  Patient s will be carefully monitored throughout the follow -up period   and any 
complication s related to the study  will be document ed and evaluated.

6.7 Statistical Analysis Plan  
Enrolle d patient s will be described in aggregate  and by [CONTACT_35151] (as deemed appropriate); 
baseline characteristics will include, but not limited to, age, sex, r ace, ethnicity, body mass index 
(BMI) , comorbidities, fundamental diagnosis/etiology, and pertinent s urgical history.  Operative 
details will be described in aggregate  and include a summary of the types of procedures 
performed , by [CONTACT_166938] .  Parameters with continuous data types will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics, i.e., mean, standar d deviation, and range.  Categorical clinical 
parameters will be summarized based on percentages.   
 
Ipsilatera l central neurologic event rate , overall survival,  re-operation rate, explant rate, and 
restenosis rate  (≥ 50% stenosis) will be summarized based on percentages of affected patients  
and included in a table, which will summarize the endpoints  in aggregate and  by [CONTACT_166939] (ex. CAS, ESRD, PAD , AAA, etc.) .  The summary of ipsilateral central neurologi c 
event rates will include all events  (transient ischemic attack, amaurosis fugax, stroke, and 
symptomatic carotid occlusion ), as well as the incidence of each event individually.  
 
Additional a nalysis of follow -up data will also be performed with the Kapla n-Meier method, as 
deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_166940].  Kaplan -Meier plots may be generated for 
endpoints including overall survival , primary patency, secondary patency, as well as freedom 
from ipsilateral central neurologic event rate, re -opera tion, explant, and restenosis  (≥ 50% 
stenosis) .  Kaplan -Meier plots for survival will include the following mortality classifications:  
all causes of mortality, vascular -related mortality and device -related mortality  (as applicable).  
The remaining plots w ill be specific to indication, if the sample sizes allow for the creation of 
meaningful plots.  
 
The incidence of adverse events will be categorized and summarized with percentages  for the 
aggregate sample.  A dverse  events will be divided into early and lat e post -operative events to 
represent the distri bution of occurrences.  E vents will be considered as early events if the event 
occurs < [ADDRESS_194022]-market, prospective evaluation of photo -oxidized decellularized   PHF1801.000 -M(04/18)

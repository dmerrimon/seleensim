 2 Background , Rationale  and Context  
In the US, 47% of adults have hypertension (HTN), and HTN accounts for more cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) deaths than any other CVD risk factor.1,[ADDRESS_1103340] a greater prevalence of HTN, worse blood pressure control, and are at 
higher risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_799841].3-6 Food insecurity (FI), the lack of consistent access to 
nutritionally adequate foods, is an important social need that affects [ADDRESS_1103341], low intensity (e.g. providing 
information about community resources) and higher -cost, high intensity (e.g. using community health 
workers (CHWs), delivery of medical tailored meals (MTM)) interventions.9-[ADDRESS_1103342] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_291855] 
(SMART ) addressing food insecurity in patients with uncontrolled HTN to determine the feasibility of 
recruitment/retention and the potential impact on blood pressure in anticipation of a larger more definitive 
trial. 
 
Methods and Measures  
 
Design  
We will conduct a longitudinal two -stage, single -site pi[INVESTIGATOR_799842] (SBP) among 
food insecure patients with uncontrolled HTN (see Figur e below ).13,14 Patients from 1 clinic  within 
AHWFB with uncontrolled HTN (BP >130/80) who screen positive FI will be eligible for inclusion. We 
will follow participants for a total of [ADDRESS_1103343] -stage interventions: 1) information about local community resources or 2) assistance from a 
community health worker ( CHW ). We will assess all participants at [ADDRESS_1103344] 10mmHg in SBP (suboptimal respondents) will be re -randomized, with equal 
probability, to receive one of two second -stage interventions: 1) initial or continued assistance with a 
CHW or 2) weekly  medically tailored meals  (MTM. ) We will assess the feasibility of recruitment 
(percent of patients who were eligible and who consented) and  retention (percent of patients who were 
enrolled who completed follow up data collection).  
 
Setting  
The study will take place in the General Medicine Clinic at Janeway Tower (OPD)  
 
 
Subjects selection criteria  
 
Inclusion Criteria  
Adult patients (≥18 years of age) will be included  if (1) have a diagnosis of HTN (defined by [CONTACT_48334] -10 
code) or have been prescribed at least one blood pressure medication (including thiazide diuretic, calcium 
channel blocker, beta -blocker, angiotensin -converting enzyme inhibitors,  or angiotensin receptor 
blocker); (2) blood pressures a t their primary care office was  >130/80; (3) experience FI based on the 2 -
item Hunger Vital Sign; and (5) live in Winston -Salem or Forsyth County .  
Protocol version:  1 
 3  
Exclusion Criteria  
Participants will be excluded if they are (1) unable to speak English or Spanish; (2) have severe cognitive 
impairment or major psychiatric illness that prevents consent and participation; (3) lack of safe, stable 
residence and ability to store meals; (4) pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant in the 
next year; (5) advance kidney disease (estimated creatine clearance < 30 mL/min); (6) serious medical 
condition which either limits life expectancy or requires active management (e.g. certain cancers); (7) 
those planning on moving out of the geographic area within 12 months; (8) lack of a telephone (>80% of 
patients list a  cell phone number in the EHR).  
 
Sample Size  
The goal of this study  is to determine the feasibility of testing the SMART design, recruitment and 
retention, data collection, and to provide information to refine the study protocol for a larger study 
powered to determine differences in the future. Our goal is to recruit 60 participants. A sample size of 60 
partic ipants will provide a >90% chanc e of having at 4 participants in each subgroup assuming 20% 
attrition ([ADDRESS_1103345] to follow up).  
 
Intervention s and Interactions  
First-stage treatment options : 
1. Resource information : Participants randomized to the resource referral arm will receive a tailored list of 
information about community resources. The list will include information about local emergency food 
resources (e.g. local food pantries) and government programs to address FI (e.g. SNAP).  
 
2. CHW assistance : The CHW will assist participants in addressing FI and supporting them in their blood 
pressure management. Participants randomized to the CHW intervention will have an initial baseline visit 
scheduled at a mutually convenient location. The purpose of the baseline visit is to build rapport and trust 
with the patient and being able to identify and address social and structural factors that affect the 
participant’s health and healthcare . Follow -up visits will occur at home, over the telephone, and in -person 
at participant’s regularly scheduled patient visits based on the needs of the participant. During the follow -
up visits, the CHW will monitor the participants’  progress with care plans, elicit and address additional 
barriers, reinforce health education, and facilitate patient and family empowerment.  
 
Tailoring variable : We will assess all participants at [ADDRESS_1103346] a 
10mmHg decrease in SBP at 3 months (suboptimal respondents) will be re -randomized to one of two 
second -stage interventions.  
   
Second -stage treatment options : 
1. CHW assistance : The CHWs will provide the same assistance as described above. Participants 
randomized to resource information in the first -stage and will be new to receiving CHW assistance, will 
have an initial baseline visit scheduled to build rapport and trust with the patient. Participants who had 
been randomized to the CHWs in the first -stage intervention will continue to work with the same CHW 
for an additional 3 months. We are including an additional 3 months of working with a CHW as a 
treatment option for participants because the optimal time individuals need to work with a CHW  is 
unclear.  
 
2. MTM :  The MTM will consist of weekly home meal delivery and will be provided by  [CONTACT_799846], which is a program of  Second Harvest Food Bank of Northwest NC. During the 3 
months of meal provisions, participants will receive 10 medically tailored refrigerated or frozen meals (5 
lunches and 5 dinners) delivered to the participant’s home weekly. Meals are refrigerated or frozen, have 
minimal preparation time, and can be heated by [CONTACT_799847], oven, or microwave.

 4 Outcome Measure(s)  
The goal of this aim is to determine the feasibility of testing the SMART design, recruitment and 
retention of participants, data collection, and to provide information to refine the future study protocol. 
We will assess blood pressure (using ambulatory blood pressure cuffs) and surveys at baseline, [ADDRESS_1103347] including 
age, sex, race/ethnicity, health insurance, medications, neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics, and 
Charlson Comoribidity Index. We are collecting insurance to see if response varies by [CONTACT_799848]. We will also collected data on which services were provided from the CHW through 
data extraction from the EHR.  
 
Analytical Plan  
Results will be analyzed  initially  using descriptive statistics.  Comparison between groups will be done 
using chi square tests for proportions, and t -tests or ANOVA procedures for continuous variables.  
Regression analysis will be performed to identify independent outcome predictors.  Other inferential 
statistical analysis will be conducted as appropriate . We will use descriptive statistics to summarize the 
feasibility of recruitment and retention. We will used repeated measure ANOVA to evaluate change in 
blood pressure over time to estimate measures of variance to assist in sample size calculations for a future 
large randomized trial.  
 
Human Subjects Protection  
 
Subject Recruitment Methods  
We will identify patients living with HTN whose  blood pressure at their last primary care visit  was 
>130/[ADDRESS_1103348]’s name, telephone 
number, age (in years), problem list (to see if they have a diagnosis of hypertension), and most recent 
blood pressure to determine if they meet eligibility requirements. Confidentiality and privacy will be 
protected by [CONTACT_799849], stored on a secure password 
protected data file, and data access will be limited to study staff only. For potential participants that 
decline, name, telephone number, and problem list will be immediately destroyed. Age and reason for 
declining (if provided) will be destroyed [ADDRESS_1103349] who is recruited in person. A study team 
member (e.g. PI, co -investigators, study coordinator, or other study team member) will obtained informed 
consent. A study team member will obtain consent in a quiet area within the primary care clinic.    
 
Confidentiality and Privacy  
Confidentiality will be protected by [CONTACT_117689], 
minimizing to the fullest extent possible the collection of any information that could directly identify

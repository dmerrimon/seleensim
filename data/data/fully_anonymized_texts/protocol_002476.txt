2. INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE 
 
2.1 Background Information 
 
2.1.1  Subjective Cognitive Decline and Mild Cognitive Impairment  
Advancing age is accompanied by [CONTACT_793588]. Some crystalized functions 
such as vocabulary and well-practiced knowledge and skills remain stable or even improve into late-life in norma l, 
non-diseased brain aging. However, fluid functions such as new learning and memory, problem-solving and other 
executive functioning, attention and concentration, and psychomotor processing speed all show declines. In 
normally functioning older adults, “ Subjective Cognitive Decline ” (SCD*) is the most widely accepted term for 
this decline in fluid cognitive functions with age. It is a state in which patients experience declines from their 
usual levels of cognitive functioning but score in the normal range on standard cognitive tests relative to peers1. 
Their everyday independent functioning is also "normal", but they are often distressed by [CONTACT_793589]. SCD may be a very early, prodromal symptom of an Alzheimer's disease (AD) or AD-related de mentias 
(ADRD) for some, or, in the absence of a disease process, it is often attributed to age-related changes in brain 
metabolism, synaptic plasticity and neurochemistry1. The natural history of SCD with or without evidence of an 
AD/ADRD process is still under investigation, but risk for subsequent decline into dementia is significantly 
increased and the presence of AD/ADRD biomarkers is higher in this group.2 
 
Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a term used when there is clinical concern about cognitive decline and 
evidence of impairment(s) in cognitive testing, more than expected for the patient's age and educational 
background, but not so severe that the person cannot manage their daily functioning without more than minimal 
assistance. MCI is frequently, though not always, a transitional, prodromal phase of dementia due to ADRD. 
"Dementia" is present when independent daily functioning is affected.3 
 
AD/ADRDs are associated with synaptic dysfunction and loss, neuronal cell death and gliosis that particularly 
affect the cerebral association cortices. Abnormal aggregates of amyloid plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles 
are the signature [CONTACT_793622], while other mis-folded protein aggregates such as -synuclein 
Lewy bodies and TDP-[ADDRESS_1094213] of pathophysiological processes contribute to neurodegeneration in aging and 
AD/AD RDs, including bioenergetic/metabolic dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, inflammation, 
oxidative damage, neurovascular injury, apoptosis and more. These processes may interact with AD/ADRD 
 
 
 
*Also referred to as age-associated memory impairment, subjective cognitive concern s, impairments or complaints, subjective memory 
concerns, impairments or complaints, “senior moments” and cognitive aging.

potential disease modification and neuroprotection across pathologies3. 
 
2.1.2  Nicotinamide Riboside Rationale 
Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a form of vitamin B3, naturally found in low levels in milk, that is a precursor to 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD+ ). NAD+ is a central metabolic cofactor that functions as the primary 
electron donor in the mitochondrial respi[INVESTIGATOR_35226], regulates the activity of various metabolic pathway enzymes 
in glycolysis, Kreb’s cycle, and fatty acid oxidation and enables signal ing for major cellular metabolism processes 
involving sirtuins. These processes are critical for maintenance of synaptic plasticity and protection against 
neurodegeneration. Neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction occurs with advancing age, but this is especially 
pronounced in pathological brain aging, such as with AD  or vascular cognitive impairment. NR is a safe, well-
tolerated, potent NAD+ precursor available as a “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS) dietary supplement. It 
has promising pharmacokinetic and systemic pharmacodynamics properties and has been shown to ameliorate 
bioenergetic, behavioral and pathological abnormalities in AD mouse models. 
 
2.1.3  Preclinical Use of Nicotinamide Riboside  
Mice expressing mutant forms of Alzheimer’s Precursor Protei n, presenilin-1, and tau with a polymerase β null 
allele were used to model age-dependent neuronal death and DNA damage. Exposure to 12mM NR for 6 
months led to significant reversals in cognitive behavioral deficits, enhanced long-term potentiation and 
neurogenesis, and decreased oxidative and inflammatory damage. NAD+/NADH ratio was elevated in mice 
treated with NR compared to vehicle groups. NR-treated mice also exhibited improved cognitive performance, 
such as improved observation times in the novel-object tests and improved spatial learning in water maze tests. 
NR treatment in this model was also implicated in upregulation of neurogenesis-related genes, leading to a 9.6% 
change in hippocampal gene expression, and downregulation of pro-apoptotic p53 expression.  NR treatment 
was further linked to decreased astrocytosis and microgliosis (equivalent to wild-type controls), and 
significantly reduced levels of phospho-tau-231. NR treatment applied to human AD fibroblasts demonstrated 
reduced expression of the oxidative 8-oxo-dG DNA and reduced levels of acetylated substrate, suggestive of the 
effect of NR on upregulating NAD+-dependent sirtuin deacetylases.4  
 
Figure 1. NAD+/NADH ratio following 6 months of NR treatment (12 mM) among wild type, transgen ic AD model 
mice, mice with polymerase β mutation, and AD/polymerase β hybrids simulating age -dependent neuroinflammation and 
oxidative damage. NAD+/NADH is a measure of the available pool of NAD+ and shows significant elevation in NR-
treated mice compared to vehicle controls among all models.4

Page 12 of 50 NR has also been implicated in modifying the toxicity of amyloid plaques associated with AD. Administration 
of mg/kg/day of NR to Tg2576 AD mice led to marked changes in hippocampal long-term potentiation and 
increased expression of PGC- 1α, which in turn upregulated degradation of β -secretase, a key enzyme implicated 
in amyloid plaque formation. [ADDRESS_1094214] of NR on NAD+ levels in humans and its tolerability. Eight subjects underwent 
dose escalation from 250 mg of NR twice daily to 1000 mg of NR twice daily over the course of nine days, with 
NR and NAD+ levels determined at baseline Day [ADDRESS_1094215] showed an increase in blood NR levels from baseline to Day 9, ranging 
from 10% to 127% increases. Blood NR showed exponential decline from [ADDRESS_1094216] clearance of NR, blood NAD+ levels were significantly increased to steady state (see 
Figure 3 ) by 35 to 168% from baseline. NR treatment did not produce side effects commonly seen in niacin 
treatment, such as flushing, pruritus, hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia, or elevation of liver or muscle enzymes. 
However, a variability in NR bioavailability was observed, suggesting that NR relies on active transport across  
intestinal mucosa, which can vary highly from person to person. 6 
 
 
Figure 2. Nicotinamide riboside (NR) enters the NAD+ salvage pathway through conversion to nicotinamide 
mononucleotide (NMN) via nicotinamide riboside kinase (NRK) or conversion to nicotinamide (N aM) via purine 
nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP). From there, NMN (or NaM after modification by [CONTACT_793590]) is converted into acti ve 
NAD+ and shunted into a variety of metabolic processes. NAD+ consuming enzymes, such as sirtuins, drain the NAD+ 
pool, which must be replenished. Declining activity of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NA MPT) with age is 
implicated in declining levels of NAD+ with age. NR supplementation by[CONTACT_793591]-limiting step by [CONTACT_793592]+ precursors directly into the salvage pathway.6

2.1.5  Prior Clinical Use of Nicotinamide Riboside   
While there are no reports yet of NR being used in patients with SCD, MCI or ADRDs, NR has been 
characterized to be both tolerable and effective in healthy midd le-aged and older adults in improving markers of 
cardiovascular health in healthy middle-aged and older adults. A 12-week randomized, double-blind, single-
crossover trial provided 30 healthy subjects with twice daily 600 mg doses of NR for 6 weeks and 6 weeks of 
PBO. Over the course of the study, 14 treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were reported in 7 subjects, all 
of mild severity. During the NR treatment period, AEs included nausea, flushing, leg cramps, and increased 
bruising. During the PBO period, AEs included headache, skin rash, flushing, fainting, and drowsiness. Only 2 
subjects (less than 10%) dropped out of the study because of these AEs, both of whom were in the PBO period. 
Two out of the three instances of flushing reported also occurred during the PBO period, suggesting the AE is 
likely unrelated to treatment. No significant changes in clinical labs were observed, including renal function 
markers and blood lipid profiles. Blood NAD+ levels increased by 60% from baseline following NR treatment. 
A five-fold change in nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD) and a 1.5-fold change in a nicotinamide 
mononucleotide (NMN) were also detected. Adenosine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels also increased 
following NR treatment, demonstrating its robust impact on metabolism. When all subjects were grouped, mean 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure was significantly lowered following NR treatment, and carotid-femoral 
pulse wave velocity, a gold-standard marker of aortic stiffness, was also reduced, although not significantly. NR 
treatment did not correspond to any significant change in total energy expenditure, oxidative fuel source, 
physical activity patterns, body mass index, glucose and insulin regulation, and exercise capacity in any 
subject.7  
 
3. SPECIFIC AIMS 
 
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a single- site single crossover, double-blind placebo (PBO)-controlled randomized sequence block trial of 
nicotinamide riboside (NR, TruNiagen , Chromadex) vs. PBO in 40 volunteers with SCD or MCI. All 
volunteers will receive a four-week PBO-lead in and acclimatization followed by [CONTACT_1192] 8-week "blocks ”. Each 
block consists of either NR or PBO for an 8-week period in random assignment order. Outcomes will consist of 
standardized cognitive, neuropsychiatric, functional and biomarker assessments as well as daily cognitive, 
mood, sleep, and activity monitoring with computer-based brain games and wearable actigraphy. Due to the 
COVID-[ADDRESS_1094217] between study staff and research subjects.

Version:4 .4 
Version date : May 26, 2022  
Page 14 of 50 The primary objective of the study will be: 
 
1. To measure the effect of NR vs PBO on RBANS.  
 
The secondary clinical objectives of the study will be: 
 
1. To measure the effect of NR vs PBO on other, standard  assessments of cognition, functional activities, 
and neuropsychiatric symptoms. 
2. To measure the effect of NR vs PBO on daily  assessments of cognition, functional activities, and 
neuropsychiatric symptoms. 
3. To monitor the safety and tolerability of NR in volunteers with SCD or MCI. 
 
The exploratory biomarker objectives of the study will be: 
1. To measure the effect of NR on plasma biomarkers of metabolic target engagement and central nervous 
system (CNS) neural and glial integrity measurable in blood. 
2. To measure the effects of NR on cerebral neurophysiology (in an optional sub-study) using resting state 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Connectivity will be measured with rsBOLD and 
regional cerebral blood flow will be measured with pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL). 
3. To measure the effect of NR on cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) biomarkers (in an optional sub-study) of 
metabolic target engagement and emerging biomarkers of relevance to AD/ADRD.  
 
3.2.1    Standardized Cognitive, Functional, and Neuropsychiatric Outcome Measures 
The primary outcome of this study will be objective measures of cognitive performance measured with the 
Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status15 (RBANS) at  Baseline (Day 28), Crossover 
(Day 84), and End of Study (Day 140). Other secondary outcome measures of cognition include the Trail Ma king 
Test (TMT)16, Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS)[ADDRESS_1094218] (CPT),  and the Brief Visual Memory Task-Revised (BVMT- R)18. Subjective 
ratings of everyday cognitive functioning and independent/instrumental/basic activities of daily living will be 
measured using items from the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF- A)19 and the Memory 
Functioning Questionnaire20 (MFQ). Ratings of mood and anxiety will be measured using the Beck Anxiety 
Inventory21 (BAI) and Beck Depression Inventory22 (BDI). These standard measures will be administered at 
Baseline (Day 28), Crossover Visit (Day 84), and End of Study (Day 140).  
 
The secondary clinical and exploratory biomarker outcomes of this study will be: 
• Performance on daily measures of cognition, functional activity, and neuropsychiatric symptoms as 
assessed by:  
o A “daily ” battery of approximately 15 minutes of Lumosity brain games (Lumos Labs, Inc.). 
Subjects will be asked to complete Lumosity games at least [ADDRESS_1094219] actigraphy (Fitbit 
Charge 3).  
o Subjective mood and sleep ratings will be collected using questionnaires 6 days per week.  
• Safety and tolerability will be assessed with adverse event (AE) reporting conducted at every visit.   
• Plasma for biomarkers will be collected at baseline, crossover and end-of-study. Plasma biomarkers 
assays will consist of ultra-sensitive immunochemical measures of proteins reflecting 
neurodegeneration/neural injury (NfL, amyloid 42/40, and GFAP) as well as NAD+/NADH.

Page 15 of 50 • Cerebral neurophysiology will be measured with functional MRI (optional sub-study).   
o Optional MRI will be conducted at three time points: Baseline (Day 28), Crossover (Day 84), 
and End of Study (Day 140. Each MRI scan session will include functional MRI with resting 
state BOLD (rs-fMRI) and pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) sequences. rs-
fMRI measures spontaneous yet synchronized fluctuations in the BOLD signal to determine the 
strength of functional connectivity within various intrinsic brain networks (i.e., default mode 
network). pCASL quantifies regional cerebral blood flow using magnetically labeled blood 
water content and will serve as a marker of resting state cerebral perfusion that has also been 
shown to correlate with regional brain metabolism and levels of neuronal activity.  
• Cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_116252] (optional sub-study) : All subjects will have the opportunity to 
participate in a lumbar puncture (LP) sub-study in which they can receive 1-3 optional LPs at Baseline 
(Day 28), Crossover (Day 84 ), and End of Study (Day 140). A panel of CSF biomarkers will be 
measured to determine the effects of NR on pathophysiological targets relevant to aging and 
neurodegeneration, including 1) neuronal degeneration markers neurofilament light chain (NfL) and 
neurogranin, 2) classic AD biomarkers including amyloid- β42/40, total tau and phospho-tau, 3) markers 
of mitochondrial function and redox dysregulation such as 8-hydroxy- 2’-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) 
and pyruvate/lactate, and 4) selected other biomarkers of inflammation and immune response and 
vascular injury of relevance to the aging brain and cognition.

Lead-In in person visit. 
 
While some subjects will have MCI, they must be deemed capable of providing informed consent by [CONTACT_21422]. Subjects who are not capable of providing informed consent will be excluded from this study.  
 
5.2  Remuneration 
Subjects will receive $25 for their participation in each Visit. Subjects will receive $[ADDRESS_1094233] optional LP 
they undergo, and $[ADDRESS_1094234] to undergo all three 
LPs, they will receive a $[ADDRESS_1094235] to participate in MRIs, they will 
receive $[ADDRESS_1094236] MRI, $100 for the second MRI, and $[ADDRESS_1094237] MRI. Subjects will also receive 
$[ADDRESS_1094238] 80% compliant with all at-home study 
activities, including medication dosing, brain games, and Fitbit activity tracking. Therefore, if a subject elects to 
undergo all additional procedures and are at least 80% compliant with at-home study tasks, the maximum 
amount a subject would be eligible to receive is $[ADDRESS_1094239] to 
participate in any optional procedures but is compliant with study tasks, they would be eligible to receive $300.  
We anticipate some subjects may come from outside the region and if so, appropriate travel expenses may be 
reimbursed including transportation up to $150. To minimize the inconvenience of frequent visits, meal and 
parking vouchers for use at the MGH Charlestown Navy Yard (CNY) facilities will also be offered at each visit.

[IP_ADDRESS].1  Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)   
The Beck Anxiety Inventory21 (BAI) is a 21-item, self-administered questionnaire that measures the presence 
and severity of anxiety in psychiatric populations. It was constructed to avoid confounds due to comorbidity of 
depression, and it has been found to be highly valid, reliable, and consistent23. The BAI lists [ADDRESS_1094255] to rate the severity with which they experience each symptom (not at 
all, mildly, moderately, or severely). Scores of 0-21, 21-35, or 36-63 indicate low, moderate, or severe anxiety, 
respectively.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)   
The Beck Depression Inventory22 (BDI) is a widely used assessment of depression severity used in clinical and 
research settings. It is a 21-item, self-administered rating inventory with a mean internal consistency of 0.8624.The 
BDI ranks responses to several domains of depression, including mood changes, guilt, self-image, suicidality, 
affect, and apathy on a scale from 0 to 3 and provides an assessment of the level of depression, spanning mi nimal 
to mild to moderate to severe depression. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Memory Function Questionnaire (MFQ)  
The Memory Function Questionnaire20 (MFQ) is an 8 question, self-administered functional assessment which 
measures the frequency and severity of self-perceived memory-related capabilities. The questionnaire involves a 
general rating of frequency of memory problems, a retrospective intraindividual comparison of memory decline, 
an assessment of forgetting frequency, an assessment of forgetting severity, and an assessment of self-derived 
mnemonic device usage. The MFQ was determined to show high internal consisteny20 and moderate concurrent 
validity with subsequent performance on clinical measures of memory25.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF- A) 
The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning19 (BRIEF-A) is a standardized rating scale to assess 
self-regulation and executive function in everyday behaviors. It is a 75-item scale including a Behavioral 
Regulation Index consisting of inhibition, shifting, emotional control, and self-monitoring scales and a 
Metacognition Index consisting of initiation, working memory, planning/organization, task monitoring, and 
organization of material scales. This study will only use the BRIEF-A self and not the informant report.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].5  Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) Scale  
The Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (IADL) Scale26 covers 8 domains of functioning and 
was designed to assess independent living skills in older adults27.  IADLs are more complex than basic Activities 
of Daily Living (ADLs) and are therefore more sensitive to disruption due to cognitive impairment. This scale 
takes about 10 minutes to complete and is administered by a trained rater who will determine whether participants 
are functionally impaired and therefore not eligible to participate in the study per inclusion criteria 2.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Neurocognitive Assessments

Page 30 of 50 [IP_ADDRESS].1  Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) 
The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)28 is a commonly used screening tool in clinical trials and research settings to 
measure potential presence of cognitive impairment. The MoCA measures five areas of cognit ive function: orientation, 
visuospatial, attention and calculation, recall, and language. This measure will be c ompleted as part of screening procedures 
carried out by [CONTACT_793601] 10 minutes.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment (T-MoCA; also referred to as MoCA-Blind )  
The Telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment28 (T-MoCA) is a commonly utilized abbreviated cognitive 
screener adapted from the full Montreal Cognitive Assessment for the purposes of measuring levels of cognitive 
impairment over the telephone. The telephone MoCA measures five areas of cognitive function: orientation, 
abstraction, attention and calculation, memory, and language. The telephone MoCA will take approximately [ADDRESS_1094256] eligibility, and will require participants to achieve a telephone MoCA score 
of 16-22 inclusive.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) 
The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status15 (RBANS) is a commonly used 25-
minute, standardized neurocognitive battery assessing functioning across multiple cognitive domains. It is 
designed to be administered repeatably, with several equivalent alternate forms available. The RBANS 
measures a total of five neurocognitive domains using twelve subtests: immediate memory (List Learning and 
Story Memory), visuospatial/constructional (Figure Copy and Line Orientation), language (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_793573]), attention (Digit Span and Coding), and delayed memory (List Recall, List Recognition, 
Story Memory, and Figure Recall).  The RBANS has been shown to be effective at both detecting and 
characterizing forms of dementia. The Delayed Memory domain has been shown to be particularly sensitive to 
discriminating MCI due to Alzheimer's disease from controls, and also is predictive of cerebral amyloid 
burden15. The RBANS will be administered at Baseline, Crossover, and End of Study using alternate forms. The 
RBANS will be administered virtually via Zoom videoconference. The coding subtest response form will be 
mailed or given to subjects before their scheduled visits along with a prepaid envelope for the form to be 
returned. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1094257] (CPT)  
The Continuous Performance Test is a test of sustained attention and alertness in which subjects are presented 
with a string of letters29. The subject is instructed to press a button every time they see an X and not to press it 
for any other letter. Letters are presented for five minutes. The subject is then given a brief break before 
continuing to the next part of the study, the AX task. In this section, the subject is told to press the button when 
they see an X that follow right after an A but not when there is an X that is not preceded by [CONTACT_1629] A. The subject is 
then presented with another five-minute block of letters. This section of the task is also a test of inhibition and 
executive control. Task administration will utilize Millisecond Inquisit software, a computerized stimulus 
presentation platform optimized for temporally precise stimuli presentation and reaction time recording of 
psychological assessments. The CPT will be administered at Baseline (Day 28), Crossover (Day 84), and at End

[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1094258] of Premorbid Functioning30 (TOPF) provides an estimate of premorbid intellectual functioning that 
allows for comparisons with an individual’s current cognitive status. The test consists of a list of [ADDRESS_1094259] atypi[INVESTIGATOR_793574]. A premorbid estimate of intelligence is calculated based on 
the raw TOPF score (number of words correctly read) and up to 13 demographic variables. The tests 
demonstrates excellent reliability across the age groups included in this study (Ages 60-90 = 0.98-0.99), in MCI 
(0.98), and in AD (0.99)31.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1094260]  
The Trail-Making Test16 (TMT) is a graphomotor letter and number-letter sequencing task that will be 
administered to test processing speed, mental flexibility, and set-switching. The test takes approximately [ADDRESS_1094261] (45) will be used at all study visits.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1094262]-Revised (BVMT- R)  
The Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised18 (BVMT-R) is a test of visuospatial learning and memory with 
six equivalent alternate forms.[ADDRESS_1094263]. The BVMT-R will be administered at Baseline, 
Crossover visit, and at End of Study.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Phlebotomy for AD Biomarkers 
Subjects will provide additional blood samples for AD biomarker analysis at Lead- In and each block visit (Day 
28 up to and including Day 140). Biomarker analysis will include NfL, A β42, Aβ40, tau, GFAP, neurogranin, and 
other analytes. At each block visit (Days 0-140), 30 ml (2.0 tablespoons ) of blood will be collected for research 
analyses, for a total of approximately  120 ml (8 tablespoons) over the course of the study.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 
Subjects will be given the opportunity to participate in an optional MRI sub-study at Baseline (Day 28), 
Crossover (Day 84), and/or End of Study (Day 140). Subjects electing to participate will be asked to complete 
all 3 MRIs to be part of the sub-study. Data will be collected on a 3-Tesla Siemens scanner with the following 
scan sequences: a high resolution T1-weighted scan, T2 FLAIR, resting state BOLD MRI, and pCASL at rest. 
Resting state BOLD measures low-frequency spontaneous fluctuations in BOLD signal across time, 
where correlations of this spontaneous activity between brain regions are thought to reflect functional

series with a voxel size of 2x2x2 mm isotropic, TR/TE = 4000/30 ms, acquisition matrix = 64x64, and [ADDRESS_1094264] of the brain.  
 
ASL-MRI is another indicator of brain function, quantifying regional cerebral blood flow, which in turn is 
linearly coupled to regional brain metabolism and neuronal activity36,37. It is especially well suited to drug trials 
in which change from baseline is of prime interest38–40. Pseudo-Continuous ASL (pCASL)40, which provides 
excellent sensitivity and temporal stability41 and accurately differentiates AD from other causes of dementia42, 
will be used in the protocol. The single shot pCASL scan will be acquired with the following parameters: 24 cm 
field of view, 2x2x2 mm isotropic, TR/TE = 4300/3.2 ms, acquisition matrix = 64x64, slice thickness = 6mm, 
temporal bolus = [ADDRESS_1094265] for blurring and signal dropout during image processing. All data processing and analysis 
will utilize tools available through FSL’s Bayesian Inference for Arterial Spin Labeling MRI (BASIL) toolbox.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Lumbar Puncture 
Subjects will have the option of participating in three lumbar punctures over the course of the study (at Days 28, 
84 and 140).  Lumbar punctures will be performed after a minimum of an [ADDRESS_1094266] will be 
positioned seated or lying on his/her side on the examination table. Standard protocols will be used employing 
palpation to identify the L3-4, L4-5 or L5-S1 vertebral interspaces, sterile conditions, local lidocaine anesthesia, 
and use of the Sprotte 24-gauge needles. Lumbar punctures will be performed by [CONTACT_3784], experienced 
practitioners. Approximately 20 cc of CSF will be collected for analysis of various AD/ADRD, redox, and 
metabolism and other biomarkers, including NfL, 8-OHdG, pyruvate/lactate, tau, phospho-tau, amyloid- β42/40, 
and neurogranin. Subjects will also complete a brief REDCap survey after the LP in which they will answer 
questions about the tolerability of the procedure. After the LP is complete, subjects will be given time to eat 
breakfast or have a snack before continuing with the visit.  
 
If a subject has difficult back anatomy or is particularly overweight, and the physician or nurse practitioner does 
not feel comfortable performing the LP because they are not able to locate the proper lumbar landmarks, the 
subject will be scheduled to undergo the LP under fluoroscopy at MGH Interventional Radiology. Fluoroscopy 
time will vary person to person. The average radiation dose is 0.06 mSv, or the equivalent of 1 week of natural 
background radiation, per LP for a total of 0.2 mSv (3 weeks of natural background radiation) over the duration 
of the study.

Before beginning each Lumosity session, the subject will be asked to rate their mood and sleep. The survey will 
consist of two brief questions and require no more than two minutes of the subject’s time.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cognitive Exercises  
Each subject will be provided with a Lumosity (Lumos, Labs, Inc.) account. The subjects will be required to 
complete 6 different cognitive exercises (about 10-15  minutes) at least  6 days per week for the duration of the 
study (from Days 0 to 140).  The assigned cognitive exercises will sample the domains of attention, processing 
speed, memory, cognitive flexibility, and problem solving. Compliance can be assessed by [CONTACT_793602]’s Lumosity acco unt. If the subject is not adhering to the cognitive 
exercise requirements, the study coordinator will contact [CONTACT_793603]. If a subject requires more than three such reminders, they will be considered non-compliant, and PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_793575]. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Daily activity and sleep tracking 
Each subject will be provided with a Fitbit Charge 4 that they will wear throughout the study. The device will 
track the participant’s heart rate, activity, and sleep. The subject will be instructed to wear their device at all 
times, except for when it is being charged and when they are bathing.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1094267] will be instructed to 
charge their device when their battery is low (roughly  once every 4 days) during a period of inactivity, such as 
when watching TV. The subject will be explicitly instructed not to charge their device during times of sleep. 
The subject will be instructed to sync their device at least [ADDRESS_1094268]’s charging and syncing compliance by [CONTACT_793604]’s Fitbit dashboard. If the device has not 
been appropriately charged or synced, the study coordinator will contact [CONTACT_793605]. If a subject requires more than three such reminders, they will be considered non-

log information into the reconciliation form to determine compliance. Non-compliance will be defined as taking 
less than 80% or more than 120% of study agent as determined by [CONTACT_793607]. If a study subject is 
non-compliant with study dietary supplement, research staff should re-educate and train the subject in 
administration of study agent . If the subject’s non -compliance persists, it will be left up to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_793580].  
9. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
 
9.1  Biostatistical analysis  
This is a crossover randomized controlled trial with the goal of determining the effects of a potential cognition-
enhancing dietary supplement for older adults with SCD and MCI. The primary analysis will be based on an 
intention to treat approach and will include all subjects randomized at the onset of the trial to either NR then 
placebo or placebo then NR as described below. 
 
In this study, the participants will pass through intervention blocks with administration of  both NR and PBO for 
eight weeks administered in random order. The primary cognitive outcome measure will be the Total Scale 
score of the RBANS which will be administered at Baseline (Day 28), Crossover (Day 84), and End of Study 
(Day 140). The RBANS is a robust 25-minute, standardized neurocognitive battery with multiple alternate 
versions whose 12 subtests yield five Index scores, one for each cognitive domain, and the Total Scale score. 
 
A Crossover, Randomized Block Sequence, Double-Blind,  Placebo-Controlled Trial for Nicotinamide Riboside in  Subjective Cognitive Decline and Mild Cognitive 
Impairment in Aging   
Version:4 .4 
Version date : May 26, [ADDRESS_1094275] reliability, a minimal detectable change in community-dwelling 
older adults (including normal, MCI and mild dementia) for the Total Score is 543. A “minimum clinically 
important difference” in MCI was reported to be 8 points44. 
 
The basic data of a crossover trial are the measurements obtained in 2 or more different intervention conditions 
occurring over time. The principal goal is to compare outcomes for each condition within a randomized block 
structure while accommodating repetition within  subjects and possible effects of carryover or disease 
progression. 
 
Assessment of normality of data distribution will be completed prior to inclusion in any analysis. If the 
distribution of the outcome variables (e.g., RBANS Total Score, etc) are not normal, appropriate 
transformations (e.g., logarithm, square-root, Box-Cox transformation, etc) will be applied. Data analysis at the 
individual and group levels for the primary outcome will begin with visual inspection of RBANS Total Scores 
at each assessment for differences from baseline for each measurement and differences between intervention 
conditions. Ignoring potential for carryover, a simple matched pair t-test will be performed using data from each 
condition.  Should carryover effects or other time trends be suspected, we can use a regression model adjusting 
for sequence. 
 
Mixed-effects models will be used to compare the scores at the end of each study period (Days 28, 84, and 140) 
between NR and PBO incorporating variance within and between participants . This within-patient level will 
accommodate variation resulting from the intervention crossovers as well as time effects modeled in various 
forms (e.g., linear and non-linear trends, carryover effects). Each within-subject regression coefficient will be 
treated as a random effect that can vary based on these between participant factors. The primary analysis will 
calculate the average intervention effect (i.e., will model the mean of the individual intervention effects as a 
constant). Secondary analyses will model the mean as a function of factors that vary among patients such as age 
and sex. These terms describe the main effects of these factors, their interactions with the intervention, and their 
interaction with time. The analysis will be completed using SAS PROC MIXED through a restricted maximum 
likelihood analysis with a mixed model with fixed effects for sequence and treatment. Appropriate covariance 
structure will be investigated using Akaike’s information criterion (AIC).  
 
The full multilevel model will estimate both average effects across the population of participants, as well as 
effects for individuals informed by [CONTACT_793608]. The predicted effects for an individual 
participant are weighted averages of his or her data and the averages from others. This model incorporates 
correlations among the measurements within an individual and enables comparison of the individual’s predicted 
intervention effect using the multilevel model with that from using only that individual’s data.  
 
When conducting study analyses we can also calculate 95% confidence intervals for the difference in response 
for active treatment versus placebo treatment for descriptive purposes. Similar analyses will be applied to all

Page 37 of 50 outcomes. All outcomes in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_793581], thus 
multiple comparison correction is not applied. Therefore P value <0.05 will be considered significant.  
 
Carryover is always a potential confound in crossover studies. While the pharmacokinetic half-life of NR is 
short (2.7 hours), its pharmacodynamic effects may be long-lived and we cannot exclude carryover and practice 
effects affecting measures in successive assessments if NR precedes PBO. We do not expect carryover 
pharmacological effects from PBO, but assessment practice effects might differentially affect measurements 
made in an NR intervention period that follows PBO.  This may be difficult to gauge with our primary RBANS 
outcome measure taken only once at the beginning/end of each intervention period.  However, we will have 
other resources with which to evaluate this using our exploratory outcomes, especially the daily cognition 
measures.  We will investigate various adjustments for carryover, such as discarding the first measurements in 
an intervention period on outcomes measured daily, to determine whether results are sensitive to carryover. 
These adjustments can allow for potential differential carryover by [CONTACT_793609].  
 
10. SAFETY AND ADVERSE EVENTS 
 
10.[ADDRESS_1094276] standardized historical, symptomatic, physical exam, and laboratory parameters to 
identify health conditions that represent risks for participation in the study's procedures. Chief among these 
would be unstable coagulopathies or anti-coagulant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_793582].  
 
10.1.1  Potential Risks 
Nicotinamide Riboside : Nicotinamide riboside is well-tolerated in patients, with few adverse events reported in 
a minority (3.3%) of patients6: 
• Mild nausea 
• Mild skin rash  
• Mild flushing/hot flashes 
• Mild leg cramps 
• Increased bruising  
 
None of the reported adverse events led to discontinuation of NR during its intervention period. 
 
Phlebotomy : The risks associated with having blood drawn include bruising and local discomfort. Rarely an 
infection may occur at this site, and if an infection does occur it will be treated by [CONTACT_5989].  
 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging : MRI is a safe procedure for subjects who do not have metal implants or other 
contraindications. Individuals who have electrically, magnetically, or mechanically-activated implants (such as 
heart pacemakers) or those who have clips on blood vessels in their brain will not be allowed to participate in 
the study due to risks associated with MRI scanning. The MRI will be operated in a manner accepted by [CONTACT_1556]. The protocol requires subjects to remain still within a relatively confined space during the scanning

Impairment in Aging   
Version:4 .4 
Version date : May 26, [ADDRESS_1094277] ’s comfort level, and subjects will be given 
earplugs to reduce discomfort due to noise. If a subject notices any discomfort while in the MRI scanner, (s)he 
should notify the administrator immediately. If the discomfort cannot be stopped, the scanning session will be 
stopped. The MRI has the potential, during normal routine use, to cause localized warming of the skin and 
underlying tissues. Subjects should immediately inform the study staff if they experience discomfort due to 
warming of the skin and the procedure will be stopped. 
 
Neurocognitive testing : The neurocognitive tests that will be administered to assess mental performance may be 
stressful and potentially cause anxiety, fatigue, and frustration. In our prior experience with similar protocols, 
risks have occurred infrequently and very few subjects have terminated testing. However, testing will be 
discontinued immediately upon any request by [CONTACT_793610]. With the evaluation of individuals with 
cognitive complaints, there is always the potential for a subject to enter the study with SCD and subsequently 
demonstrate a decline in cognitive performance throughout the course of the study to a level consistent with a 
diagnosis of MCI. If this occurs, a licensed clinician will meet with the subject and suggest that they see their 
primary care provider for further evaluation. 
 
Daily Cognitive Exercises : The daily Lumosity (Lumos Labs, Inc.) brain exercises may be stressful, tedious, 
and potentially cause fatigue, and frustration. However, the program was designed to resemble games and the 
duration is short, so the likelihood of these potential risks is low.  
Questionnaires : Questionnaires administered during the protocol may cause subjects to feel sad or upset about 
how their neurocognitive functioning affects their quality of life. Study staff is experienced with such 
evaluations and sensitive to these issues. Any question can be omitted per the s ubject’s request.  
 
Wrist Actigraphy : The wrist actigraph, the Fitbit Charge 3, may cause some minor discomfort due to prolonged 
wearing, but the risk of such discomfort will be minimized by [CONTACT_793611] 
(e.g. is not too tight or does not cause irritation). If the subject does experience discomfort, another wristband 
will be ordered to try to eliminate the discomfort.  
 
Lumbar puncture (LP) : Pain may occur during the procedure. This is usually temporary, confined to the lower 
back, and minimized with the cutaneous and soft tissue administration of 1% lidocaine as a local anesthetic. 
Short-lived LP associated headaches occur in <1%-36% of subjects with an incidence that decreases with age45–
47. Less commonly, a persistent low-pressure headache may develop as a result of a post-LP CSF leakage. 
Lower rates of post-LP headache have been noted with the atraumatic (Sprotte) 24-gauge needle that will be 
used in this study47. Potentially more serious, but very rare risks, include infection, damage to radicular nerves 
and bleeding into the lumbar CSF space. The risk of these procedure related complications is much less than 
1%.  
 
Videoconferencing : Visits that take place via videoconferencing may allow research staff to learn more about 
the subject’s home and cohabitants than an office visit. The study team will use a secure Zoom

11.3  Definitions of AEs & SAEs 
 
11.3.1  Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with a study, use of a drug product 
or device, whether or not considered related to the drug product or device. 
 
Examples of adverse events include: new conditions, worsening of pre-existing conditions, clinically significant 
abnormal physical examination signs (i.e. skin rash, peripheral edema, etc.), or clinically significant abnormal 
test results (i.e. lab values or vital signs), with the exception of outcome measure results, which are not being 
recorded as adverse events in this trial (they are being collected, but analyzed separately). Stable c hronic 
conditions (e.g. arthritis) that are present prior to the start of the study and do not worsen during the trial are NOT 
considered adverse events. Chronic conditions that occur more frequently (for intermittent conditions) or with 
greater severity are considered as worsened and therefore would be recorded as adverse eve nts. Adverse events 
are generally detected in two ways: 
• Clinical → symptoms reported by [CONTACT_243075]. 
• Ancillary Tests → abnormalities of vital signs, laboratory tests, and other diagnostic procedures 
(other than the outcome measures, the results of which are not being captured as AEs). 
 
If discernible at the time of completing the AE log, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated 
signs and symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_444158]. However, if an observed or 
reported sign, symptom, or clinically significant laboratory anomaly is not considered by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_79796] a component

Impairment in Aging

Version date : May 26, 2022  
Page 42 of 50 of a specific disease or syndrome, then it should be recorded as a separate AE on the AE log. Clinically signi ficant 
laboratory abnormalities, such as those that require intervention, are those that are identified as such by [CONTACT_978]. 
 
Subjects will be monitored for AEs from the time they sign consent until completion of their participation in the 
study (defined as death, consent withdrawal, loss to follow up, early study termination for other reasons, or 
following completion of the entire study). An unexpected adverse event is any adverse event, the specificity or 
severity of which is not consistent with the current Investigator’s Brochure.  
 
The study procedures and the well-being of all participants will be monitored closely by [CONTACT_793616], Steven Arnold MD, and the Co-Investigators, Nadine Schwab, PhD and Alison McManus DNP, 
FNP- BC. Throughout the course of the study, constant feedback with the subject is maintained in order to assess 
comfort and safety and to minimize risks throughout the procedure. The above investigators will be responsible 
for determining if a subject should be removed from the study. Criteria for removal include the following: 1) if a 
subject is unwilling or unable to participate in study procedures 2) if the subject refuses to participate and consent, 
3) if the subject acquires a medical condition that prohibits further participation, 4) if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_793585], [CONTACT_243086], it is decided that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue 
participation.  
 
Unanticipated problems including adverse events will be reported to the Partners Human Research Committee 
(PHRC) as described in the PHRC policy on Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others 
including adverse events. 
 
The Data Management team will be responsible for the development, execution, and supervision of plans, 
policies, programs, and practices that control, protect, deliver, and enhance the value of data and information 
assets. All data will be managed in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. The study coordinator, 
under the supervision of the PI, will collect, transcribe, correct, and transmit the data onto source documents, 
Case Report Forms (CRFs), and/or other forms used to report, track, and record clinical research data. The study 
coordinator will be instructed to enter this information into the StudyTrax Electronic Data Capture (EDC) System. 
The StudyTrax platform provides password protection. An edit checking and data clarification process will be 
put in place to ensure accuracy of the data. Logic and range checks as well as more sophisticated rules may be  
built into the eCRFs to provide immediate error checking of the data entered. The system has the capability to 
automatically create electronic queries for forms that contain data that are out of range, out of window, mi ssing, 
or not calculated correctly. The platform will have the ability to lock specific visits to prevent any modification 
of data once the visit is closed. Once this option is activated, every user will have Read-Only access to the data.  
The PI, [CONTACT_757477], will be responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the 
data reported.

to Partners IRB and to the Human Research Committee (HRC) in accordance with HRC Guidelines. A serious 
adverse event (SAE) is defined as an adverse event that meets any of the following criteria:

Page 43 of 50 1. Results in death. 
2. Is life threatening: that is, poses an immediate risk of death as the event occurs. 
o This serious criterion applies if the study subject, in the view of the PI, is at immediate risk of 
death from the AE as it occurs. It does not apply if an AE hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe. 
3. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_243046] a routinely scheduled treatment is not an SAE by [CONTACT_243076] “procedure” or a “treatment” is not an untoward 
medical occurrence. 
4. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. 
o This serious criterion applies if the “disability” caused by [CONTACT_243077] a substantial 
disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life functions.  
5. Results in congenital anomaly or birth defect in the offspring of the subject. 
6. Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function 
or permanent damage to a body structure. 
7. Important medical events that may not result in death, are not life-threatening, or do not require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_243047], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
 
An inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_243048] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], treatment-emergent, clinical adverse event 
may meet criteria for "seriousness" but is not an adverse experience and will therefore not be considered an 
SAE. An example of this would include a social admission (subject admitted for reasons other than medical, 
e.g., lives far from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], has no place to sleep).

on CRFs designed specifically for this purpose. All AEs will be collected and reported in the EDC system. 
 
11.4.1 Assessment of Adverse Events 
At each visit (including telephone visits), the subject will be asked if they had any problems or symptoms since 
their last visit in order to determine the occurrence of adverse events. If the subject reports an adverse event, the 
Investigator will probe further to determine: 
• Type of event 
• Date of onset and resolution (duration) 
• Severity (mild, moderate, severe) 
• Seriousness (does the event meet the above definition for an SAE) 
• Causality, relation to investigational protocol

11.4.2  Relatedness of Adverse Event to Investigational Protocol 
 
 
1. Not Related: Concomitant illness, accident, or event with no reasonable association with protocol. 
2. Unlikely: The reaction has little or no temporal sequence from administration of the investi gational 
protocol, and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists. 
3. Possibly Related: The reaction follows a reasonably temporal sequence from administration of the 
investigational protocol and follows a known response pattern to the suspected 
investigational protocol; the reaction could have been produced by [CONTACT_118448] l 
protocol or could have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_793617] o f 
therapy administered to the subject. 
4. Probably Related: The reaction follows a reasonably temporal sequence from administration of inv estigational 
protocol; is confirmed by [CONTACT_793618]-challenge; 
and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s  clinical 
state. 
5. Definitely Related: The reaction follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of investi gational 
protocol; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the investigational pr otocol; 
and that is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_793586], and 
reappearance of the reaction on repeated exposure. 
 
 
 
11.4.3  Recording of Adverse Events 
All clinical adverse events are recorded in the Adverse Event (AE) Log in the subject’s study binder. Study staff 
should fill out the AE Log and enter the AE information into the EDC system within 48 hours of learning of a 
new AE or receiving an update on an existing AE. 
 
Entries on the AE Log (and into the EDC) will include the following: name [CONTACT_243085], the date of 
onset, the date of resolution, relationship to investigational product, action taken, and primary outcome of event. 
 
11.[ADDRESS_1094285] be reported via the EDC system within 24 hours of 
study staff being notified of the event.

Study Design:  This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized (2:1), unblinded pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
Indication of Device:  All medical devices used during this study are cleared for commercial distribution and 
are to be used in accordance with approved product labeling.  
 
The AtriClip LAA Exclusion System is indicated for the occlusion of  the left atrial 
appendage, under direct visualization, in conjunction  with other open cardiac surgical 
procedures.  Direct visualization, in this context, requires that the surgeon is able to 
see the heart directly, without assistance from a camera, endoscope, etc., or an y other 
viewing technology. This includes procedures performed by [CONTACT_335937] (full or 
partial) as well as  thoracotomy (single or multiple).  
Objective(s):  The objective(s) of this trial are to:  
1. Compare impact of POAF among two randomized treatment arms; 
patients with POAF and surgical LAA closure (using AtriClip Gillinov -
Cosgrove LAA Exclusion Systems) versus patients with POAF and no 
surgical LAA closure . 
2. Evaluate Healthcare  resource utilization [ i.e. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] 
(LOS), emergency room and/or h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_134577] -admissions, and costs 
associated with specific adverse events  that may be related to atrial 
fibrillation ]. 
3. Evaluate long -term outcomes of LAA closure with AtriClip in patients at 
risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_335911].

1.[ADDRESS_414869] of care for patients with POAF is oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy as 
prophylaxis of thromboembolic events.   Recent clinical literature from Gallego et al (Gallego, Relation of 
the HAS -BLED bleeding risk score to major bleeding, ca rdiovascular events, and mortatlity in 
anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation., 2012)  suggests that the risk of major bleeding exceeds the 
risk of thromboembolic events in AF patients at a HAS -BLED score of > 3.  Gallego et al. also reported 
that patients with low CHADS score (e.g., 0 – 1) have lower major bleeding risk than those patients with 
CHADS >=2. Although Gallego et al. focused on HAS -BLED > 3, the study recrui ted 800 (83%) and 740 
(77%) patients with HASB LED>=2 and CHADS>=2, respectively. In fact, 472 (49%) of the patients 
recruited in the study had a HASBLED score of 2. Other peer -reviewed research from Tung et al (Tung, 
2015)   identifies that the highest risk for major bleedi ng occurs within the first 30 days of initiating OACs.  
Therefore, this study focuses entirely on a subset of patients that are vulnerable to both initiation of OACs 
as well overalls risks of OAC therapy.   
Literature and current practice reinforce the fac t that this subset of high risk AF patients are not routinely 
being started on OACs.  In a recent meta -analysis from Lip et al (Lip, Underuse of Oral Anticoagulation in 
AF, A systematic review, 2010) , looking at high risk  patients (defined as those with a CHADS > 2) only 
39% of AF patients in the U.S. were on OAC therapy.  
This study intends to monitor a subset of patients with specific risk factors where both the risk of 
thromboembolic events and major bleeding intersect r esulting in significant clinical equipoise both in 
literature and in current “real life” clinical practice.  
Use of the AtriClip device  may eliminate the nidus for AF -related thrombi originating in the Left Atrial 
Appendage.   While not the focus of this st udy it is believed that this may contribute favorably to the primary 
composite endpoint of major bleeding, stroke and  TIA.  T his research may begin to better inform clinical 
practice for those treating these high risk patients  and continue to ascertain the risk of major bleeding vis-

Need for Treatment in ATLAS  
Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) and related stroke/TIAs impact mortality, morbidity and QOL for 
patients under going structural heart disease procedures.    Oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy is typi[INVESTIGATOR_335915].   Risk factors identified by [CONTACT_335946] -BLED scoring of 
>2 present an increased risk for bleeding creating clinical equipoise between the risk/benefit of stroke/TIA 
risk and clinically significant bleeding.  Initiation of anticoagulation therapy for POAF patients is reported 
to increase hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] b y 2-5 days.  Exclusion of the Left Atrial Appendage in patients with 
Atrial Fibrillation is believed to reduce the potential for thrombus formation within the Left Atrial 
Appendage which is the site of a majority (90%) of all thrombi identified in patients  examined with an AF 
related stroke  (Blackshear, 1996) .   
 
The 2006 ACC/AHA Guidelines recommended removal of the Left Atrial Appendage to reduce the 
potential for stroke during cardiac (structural heart) procedures for any patien t with risk factors for stroke 
or postoperative atrial fibrillation when it can be done without  adding risk to the primary operation.  Due 
to a lack of randomized controlled trials showing a reduction in stroke in patients with their LAA removed, 
prophylac tic LAA exclusion is not routinely performed.    
 
Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation (POAF) incidence is reported to be between 30 -50% depending upon 
patient demographics, procedural variables and intensity of rhythm monitoring.  Historically, POAF was 
considered to be self -terminating and confined to the postoperative hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  A recent paper from 
Joung et al (Joung, 2014) , published  in the American Heart Journal suggests that new -onset POAF is 
associated with a five times higher risk of future long term AF than matched patients as well as a three 
times higher mortality.  
 
In addition, POAF has been shown to have a strong association with perioperative stroke/TIA, increased 
length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], decreased QOL and increased  mortality.    A 2014 Annals paper from LaPar  et al. 
(LaPar, 2014)  evaluated  ~50,000 patients undergoing structural heart procedures.   For patients with POAF, 
stroke incidence was 2.6% vs. 1.1% vs. in non -POAF patients at 30-day follow -up, increased ICU time of 
48 hours longer, increased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_148801] 3 days,  and a 25% higher 30-day readmission rate.  The total 
incremental hospi[INVESTIGATOR_335916] ~$9000.   Yusuf et al (Yus uf, 2014) , 
reviewed data on over 100,[ADDRESS_414871] predictors of early 
stroke with an Odd Ratio of 1 .5.  Age, history of TIA/stroke, PAD, CHF, and valve surgery were also 
predictors.  The data also showed that increasing CHADS2 scores predicted increased risk of stroke or 
death among patients with AF vs. those without AF .  
 
An October 2013 JTCVS paper by  [CONTACT_335947]. (Chua, 2013)  validated  the CHADS2 scoring system as 
highly predictive for risk of POAF in CABG patients without a history of preoperative AF.  Specifically, 
patients with CHADS2 scores of >2 had a 36% risk of POAF (ra nge of 27 -100%).   
 
A more refined scoring system, the CHA2DS2 -VASc score, has been validated to define the risk of stroke 
in AF patients in numerous papers.  A CHA2DS2 -VASc of >2 estimates an annual risk of stroke of between 
4.5-18.2% in patients with AF.

Typi[INVESTIGATOR_335917] (AC) within 24 hours of diagnosis.   A 2009 Annals paper from (Kasirajan, 2009)  et al. identified 
isolated POAF as adding 2.2 days to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_335918].   The HASBLED scoring system has been va lidated in 
multiple studies to identify the risk of clinically significant bleeding.    HASBLED scores of >[ADDRESS_414873] an 
associated risk of bleeding of between 4.1 -19.6% annually.     
A recent Circulation paper from Roldan  (Rolden, 2013)  et.al defined a strong correlation between bleeding 
and adverse cardiovascular events using the HASBLED scoring system.  They concluded that crude 
bleeding rates exceeded thrombotic events at HAS -BLED scores of >3.    
Azoulay  (Azou lay, 2014)  et al. reported that the initiation of Warfarin was associated with a 1.[ADDRESS_414874] 30 days suggesting a significant   transient hypercoagulable state 
at the start of treatment.   In a report from R uiz-Nodar  at al.  (Ruiz -Nodar, 2012) , they reported a major 
bleeding rate of 11.8% at one year in patients with a HAS -BLED score of > 3 in their series of patients 
undergoing coronary artery stenting procedures.    
Clinical equipoise exists regarding the initiation of anticoagulation therapy in patients with a significant 
risk of AF -related stroke as well as significant risk of bleeding related to OAC therapy.  
Evidence suggests that the risk of major bleeding exceeds the risk  of thromboembolic events in AF patients 
with a HAS -BLED > 3 (Gallego, Relation of the HAS -BLED bleeding risk score to major bleeding, 
cardiovascular events, and mortatlity in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation., 2012) .  Other peer -
reviewed research identifies that the highest risk for major bleeding and ischemic stroke occurs within the 
first 30 days of initiating OACs (Tung, 2015)  (Gomes, 2013) .  This study focuses on patients that are 
vulnerable to both risks identified by [CONTACT_335948] (CHADS and HASBLED) as well 
as significantly increased risks for patients initiating OAC therapy for a complication that will largely self -
terminate wit hin [ADDRESS_414875]. Cox (Cox, 1993)  describes  a large series of patients where a Maze procedure was performed including 
LAA surgical exclusion.   At 90 day follow up only 2/306 (.6%) patients experienced a stroke/TIA although 
37% had POAF in spi[INVESTIGATOR_232221] a majority not receiving postoperative anticoagula tion therapy.    
In a 2013 paper from Kim et al.  (Kim, 2013) ; describes  a series of 631 matched patients with/without LAA 
exclusion concomitant to cardiac (structural heart) procedures.  Using propensity analysis, 260 subjects 
with postoperative AF were analyzed evaluating  incidence of stroke/TIA.   In the LAA exclusion group 
there were zero (0%) stroke/TIAs in spi[INVESTIGATOR_232221] a majority of these patients not receiving anticoagulation 
therapy.  Conversely there were 6% stroke/TIAs in the no LA A exclusion group (p = 0.003).  A second 
article (Viles -Gonzalez, 2012)  et al.; showed a ~77% reduction in expected stroke rate in AF patients with 
a >2 CHADS2 score undergoing a percutaneous LAA closure device and contraindications to Warfarin.    
 
These papers provide preliminary evidence that LAA exclusion may potentially reduce stroke/TIA 
complications associated with POAF and that its application to patients  with a significant risk of bleeding 
on OACs may have a secondary benefit in reducing bleeding complications.  
 
  
Study Number: CP2015 -[ADDRESS_414876] : Clinical Study Protocol    
Version date:  15Feb2017/ Rev: H  
 
Published data suggests a risk of POAF in valve and CABG patients of between 32 -66% (Creswell, 1993) .  
The ris k of a perioperative CVA event in  the POAF patient population of up to 6% (Lee, 2014)  and a 2-
year rate of stroke or death of 21.2 % for those with a CHADS2 score of greater than 3 (Whitlock, 2014) .    
The decision to forgo placing an AtriClip in  the treatment arm will  be at the surgeon’s perioperative 
discretion due to overall risk of the procedure  or risk associated with accessing the LAA and  documented 
with a rationale on the Case Report Form (for exampl e, excessive adhesions  in the vicinity of the LAA.).  
 
The Role of ATLAS in Critically Ill Patients  
Anticoagulation therapy is considered the standard of care for stroke prophylaxis in patients with Atrial 
Fibrillation but in patients with risk factors for bleeding the risk/benefit of medical management is 
elucidated.   This study will evaluate a medical management arm vs. mechanical exclusion of the left 
appendage via an implantable device.  It is believed that the left appendage is the source for a predominant 
number of stroke causing emboli in AF patients .  It is postulated that patients receiving antic oagulation will 
incur a longer length of stay due to the initiation and normalization and maintenance of therapeutic lev els 
associated with therapy.  This will also be evaluated in the study.   
 
2.0 STUDY  OBJECTIVE S 
 
The objective(s) of this trial are to:  
1. Compare impact of POAF among two randomized treatment arms; patients with POAF and 
surgical LAA closure (using AtriClip Gillinov -Cosgrove LAA Exclusion Systems) versus 
patients with POAF and no surgical LAA closure . 
2. Evaluate Healthcare resource utilization  [i.e. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] (LOS), emergency room 
and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_134577] -admissions, and costs associated with specific adverse events  that may be 
related to atrial fibrillation ]. 
3. Evaluate long -term outcomes of LAA closure with AtriClip in patients at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_335919].

Overall Study and Design – Description  
All patients who undergo a valve or CABG (structural heart) procedure with direct visual access to the 
LAA will be eligible to participate based upon consent and evaluation of the inclusion and exclusion criteria 
defined in this protocol.    
 
The target p atient population includes patients at risk of POAF based on the CHA2DS2 -VASc and 
HASBLED scoring.  
 
Patient must meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria (including intra -operative exclusion criteria ) before 
enrollment or randomization.     
 
During the planned structural heart procedure, the intra -operative exclusion criteria will be assessed.  If any 
intra-operative exclusion criteri a are met, the subject will be a screen  fail and will not be enrolled  or 
randomized.     
 
To execute randomizati on, at the time of enrollment, s ubjects will be assigned a sequential identi fication 
number at each site and a corresponding sealed envelope which will be opened in the operating room to 
reveal the treatment group.  Subjects will be randomized 2:1 (2 with AtriC lip® to 1 with  no AtriC lip®).  
Randomization sequences will be generated by  [CONTACT_335950] b e stratified by s ite.  The 
subject population will be randomized using a blocking scheme for each surgeon to ensure equal and 
balanced treatment group allocations and to avo id bias with respect to known or unknown subject  variables 
that could affect the outcome of this study.  
 
Post-index procedure, all subjects will be monitored per the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_335920].   
 
Four (4) treatment arms result : 
 Surgery with AtriC lip (POAF diagnosed  / Institution SoC anticoagulation therapy ) 
 Surgery with AtriC lip (No POAF ) 
 Surger y with no AtriC lip (POAF diagnosed  / Institution SoC anticoagulation therapy ) 
 Surgery with no AtriC lip (No POAF)  
 
Subjects will be assessed for AEs related to the placement of the AtriClip and will be instructed to notify 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_335921] d uring the study .  All s ubjects  that develop POAF during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_335922] 1 year (365 days) post index procedure.  In addition, all the subjects  in the 
AtriClip group that do not develop POAF will also be followed for [ADDRESS_414881] will be given a 
copy of the signed IC F to keep.

5.0 PROCEDURE  
5.1 General Description  
Individual centers and investigators will be  selected based upon their expertise in the targeted structural 
heart disease procedures (non -mechanical Mitral Valve Repair/Replacement, Aortic Valve 
Repair/Replacement, and Corona ry Artery By -Pass procedures) as well as proficiency in AtriClip 
placement.  
The term index procedure refers only to the placement /non-placement of the AtriC lip (dependent on 
randomization) . All proce dures leading up to and after the placement of the AtriC lip are considered part 
of the structural heart procedure and are to be cond ucted under the discretion of the surgeon in accordance 
to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s standard of care.  
Transesophageal Echocardiography  (TEE) with Doppler  
Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) with Doppler must be performed prior to any epi[INVESTIGATOR_335924]. The purpose of the TEE with Doppler is to assess for presence of thrombus .  If a thrombus is 
present in the left atrium o r LAA, the subject will not be enrolled or randomized into the study  and no 
AtriC lip will be placed .   
 
The AtriClip LAA Exclusion  System must be used only by [CONTACT_335955] (IFU).  Failure to properly follow instructions may result in 
improper functioning of the device.  
  
Study Number: CP2015 -[ADDRESS_414892] : Clinical Study Protocol    
Version date:  15Feb2017/ Rev: H  
 
 
If the subject continues to meet  all study eligibility criteria  (including intra -operative exclusion criteria) , 
they will be enrolled and randomized.  If the subject is randomized to the group to receive the AtriClip 
LAA Exclusion System placement, the following steps are performed:  
 
Note: A recommended surgical technique is presented below. It is recognized that individual patient 
anatomic variation, surgical conditions, or surgeon preference may necessitate modifications to the 
outlined procedures.   Regardless, surgeons must adhere t o the AtriClip LAA Exclusion System  sizing 
criteria, device selection, and device use instructions as outlined in the IFU.  
5.2 Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Exclusion  (Index Procedure)  
5.2.[ADDRESS_414893] early terminate before or 
after the index procedure; the  subject will be followed for 30 days for safety purposes .   
General Placement of the AtriClip : 
Refer to the IFU for proper AtriClip size selection  as well as AtriC lip positioning and d eployment 
instructions.  Using a Kitner or forceps, the open AtriClip ® device is passed over the tip of the left atrial 
appendage.  The tip of the appendage is gently teased into the AtriClip.  The device is then lowered into the 
base of the appendage.  Awareness of the proximity of the circumflex artery  and its relationship  to the 
targeted location at the base of the left atrial appendage  is critical . The AtriClip is applied on the left atrial 
appendage ensuring the alignment and complete closure of the LAA .   
 
 
   
 
   
Post Index  Procedure  - Subject Assessment  
To assess the subject status with regard to potential bleeding, assessments of hemoglobin and hematocrit 
shall be performed po st index  procedure per the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s standard of care.

5.[ADDRESS_414895]-Surgical  Follow -up Anticoagulation Therapy  
Subjects who are diagnosed with POAF during their postoperative course  should be treated per the 
institution’s standard of care and may in clude  anticoagulation therapy .  
The decision to administer anticoagulation therapy in the post -operative/follow -up setting is at the 
discretion of the Investigator/Institution taking into consideration, the subject’s ability to safely initiate and 
sustain anticoagulation therapy.    
The anticoagulants that may be used in medical management may include:  
 Acenocoumarol  
 Acetylsalicylic acid  
 Api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]  
 Dabigatran  
 Edoxaban  
 Heparin  
 Nadroparin  
 Rivaroxiban  
 Warfarin  
 Other (to be specified)  
These are the anticoagulants that may be utilized in medical management.  The decision of which 
anticoagulant to use (if any) is left to the discretion of the Investigator.  
6.0 IDENTITY OF STUDY DEVICES  
The devices utilized for the study include:  
AtriClip Gill inov-Cosgrove LAA Exclusion Systems which are indicated for the occlusion of the left atrial 
appendage, under direct visualization, in conjunction with other open cardiac surgical procedures.  Direct 
visualization, in this context, requires that the surgeo n is able to see the heart directly, without assistance 
from a camera, endoscope, etc., or any other viewing technology. This includes procedures performed by 
[CONTACT_335937] (full or partial) as well as thoracotomy (single or multiple).  
 
All medical devices used during this study are cleared for commercial distribution and are to be used in 
accordance with approved product labeling.  
 
Device Description  
When closed, the AtriClip applies uniform pressure over the length of the AtriClip to ensure consistent, 
reproducible, and secure exclusion of the LAA.   The AtriClip is available in the following lengths to 
accommodate different sizes of LAA: 35 mm, 40 mm, 45 mm, and 50 mm.  
The AtriClip was cleared under K093679.  The frame assembly of the implantable AtriClip c onsists of two 
Nitinol (nickel titanium) springs connecting two opposing titanium tubes (core), which are covered with a 
Polyurethane elastomer.  This assembly is covered with a knit braided polyester fabric, composed entirely 
of Polyethylene terephthalate  (PET).  The Nitinol springs are biased toward the closed position allowing 
the device to close in the absence of opposing forces (Figure 1).  When closed, the AtriClip applies uniform 
pressure over the length of the AtriClip to ensure consistent, reproduc ible, a nd secure exclusion of the LAA.

8.1.2 Data Collection  
An EDC system will be utilized by [CONTACT_335956] (medical 
records and/or source document worksheets) onto common eCRFs. This system is a web -based, secure 
electronic software application This system is designed , developed, and maintained in a manner that is 
compliant with national an d international GCP data protection/data privacy and electronic record/electronic 
signature (e.g., 21 CFR Part 11) regulatory requirements.  The platform software has been validated in 
accordance with 21 CFR Part 11, European Commission’s Directive on Data  Protection and US Safe Harbor 
Certification.   Prior to being released for data entry, validation of the study level components (i.e. data entry 
screens, associated edit checks and work flow) will be conducted in accordance with approved user 
acceptance te sting procedures. Access to this system will be controlled so that only authorized users will 
have the ability to enter into the system.  The system is considered a closed system according to 21 CFR 
Part 11 Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures.  
The EDC system will be used to facilitate the collection of all study  data at the site. Designated site 
personnel will be responsible for entering subject data into the EDC system. All external and Sponsor 
internal users will be trained on the EDC applicat ion at a level dependent on their planned function.  
An EDC digital User Manual will be available under the help menu within the EDC we bsite to assist in the 
collection and entry of source data into the electronic casebook.  
Investigative study sites will b e asked to enter subject data into the eCRFs no later than [ADDRESS_414902]’s medical records.  
Data will be entered into the electronic data capture system by [CONTACT_335957].  The system will generate data queries at the point of data 
entry based on validation checks defined by [CONTACT_137862]. Such validation checks will primarily be focused on 
validation of key variables including selected subject demographics, appropriate value ranges and date 
checks. Resolution of the queries  will be the responsibility of the Clinical Investigator and investigation 
team members.  Following completion of all data queries on each eCRF, the Clinical Investigator will be 
responsible for reviewing and confirming agreement to the data within the sys tem. 
The Investigator must record the subject’s participation in this clinical investigation in the subject’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_335927].  In addition, the Investigator must keep a separate list of all subjects entered into this clinical 
investigation showing each sub ject’s name, date of birth and assigned subject number (fo r identification 
purposes).  A s ubject Identification Log  will be provided in the Investigator’s File for this purpose.

ultimately the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure all  clinical site personnel participating in this study 
are trained.  
The index procedure may only be performed by [CONTACT_324361], familiar with the study procedures 
and techniques.   
8.1.11  Monitoring  
This study  will be monitored by [CONTACT_179224]:  
 The rights , safety and well -being of the subjects are protected;  
 The reported study  data is accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents; and  
 The conduct of the study  is in compliance with the currently approved 
protocol/amendment(s), applicabl e GCPs, and with applicable local/regional regulatory 
requirements.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
In ord er to perform the monitoring r ole effectively, the CRA  must verify eCRF entries with source 
documents.  The CRA  must be given access to primary subject data which supports the information 
recorded on the eCRF, i.e. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11533], appointment books, original laboratory records, etc.  Access to 

  
Study Number: CP2015 -[ADDRESS_414908] : Clinical Study Protocol    
Version date:  15Feb2017/ Rev: H  
 
these documents must also be given shou ld the regulatory authority in the instance of  an external inspection .  
Since a subject has the right to refuse access to these  documents on the grounds of confidentiality, consent 
to access is included in the informed consent doc ument, which the subject signs.  
The Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_335929].  At each visit, the Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_335930] -operate 
with the CRA  for the review and verification of eCRFs and any additional records that may have been 
previously arranged between the Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_335931] . 
8.2 Changes to Protocol, Protocol Deviations and Protocol Amendments  
8.2.1 Changes to Protocol  
The I nvestigator should not implement any deviation from, or changes to the protocol without agreement 
by [CONTACT_335958]/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_335932], except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study  subjects, or when the 
change(s) involves only logisti cal or administrative aspects of the study  (e.g., change in CRA (s), change of 
telephone number(s)). In the event of an emergency situation, th e Investigator must notify the CRA or 
AtriCure immediately.  A full written report of the situation must be forwar ded to the IRB who approved 
the original protocol and AtriCure within [ADDRESS_414909] the study in accordance with this protocol;  however, protocol deviations 
may occur during the course of the study .  Protocol deviations are events occurring during the conduct of 
the study  which are not in compliance with the protocol and for which an amendment has not been granted. 
Protocol deviations can be committed by [CONTACT_1034], the PI, or study  subject. A deviation can be identified 
from a number of sources. Potential sources include, but are not limited to: a member of the PI’s staff, the 
CRA  during monitoring visits, or a member of the data management or statistical groups when entering or 
analyzi ng data.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_335933]’s representative are encouraged to contact [CONTACT_335959] a protocol deviation.  Regardless of the source, it is crucial to document the 
deviation and record all corrective actions. Protocol de viations will be reported in the final report.  
The process for capturing deviations will be detailed in the monitoring plan.  The process will require that 
documentation describe the deviation, appropriate actions taken, and will be included in the study  file for 
the respective PI [INVESTIGATOR_335934].  The study  site representative will be advised to record the deviation and 
relevant discussion with the Sponsor about the deviation in subject source documents.  
Protocol deviations affecting the scientific soundness o f the study  or the rights, safety, or welfare of the 
subjects, will be reported by [CONTACT_978], as required by [CONTACT_1201].  
Protocol deviations will be summarized and grouped into relevant categories for analysis and may include, 
but not be limited to, subjects who : 
 Entered the study  although they did not satisfy the eligibility criteria; or  
 Developed withdrawal criteria during the study , but not removed.

8.2.3 Protocol Amendments  
If it becomes necessary to amend the protocol,  then the nature of the amendment will be agreed between 
the Sponsor and the Principal Investigator(s) and this will be recorded with a justification for the 
amendment. The appropriate IRBs will be informed of amendments prior to implementation of the chan ge. 
9.0 STATISTICAL METHODS  
9.1 Clinical Study Objective  
The objectives of this study are to:  
1. Compare impact of POAF among two randomized treatment arms; patients with POAF and 
surgical LAA closure (using AtriClip Gillinov -Cosgrove LAA Exclusion Systems) versus 
patients with POAF and no surgical LAA closure . 
2. Evaluate Healthcare resource utilization [i.e. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] (LOS), emergency room 
and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_134577] -admissions, and costs associated with specific adverse events  that may be 
related to atrial fibrillation ]. 
3. Evaluate long -term outcomes of LAA closure with AtriClip in patients at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_335919].  
These patients will be enrolled prior to a scheduled existing cardiac procedure and randomized prior to the  
study  index procedure  (AtriC lip placement) . Perioperative event rates and postoperative outcomes 
including reoperation for bleeding, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], neurologic consults for stroke/TIAs, ED visits, 
and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_335935].    
9.2 Study Endpoints  
The following endpoints will be collected for this hypothesis generating pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]:  
1. Perioperative complications associated with AtriClip placement.  [Defined as: stroke, major 
bleeding  that requir es re-operation and/or transfusion of > 2 U packed red blood cells (PRBC) 
within any 24-hour period during the first 2  days’  post-index procedure,  myocardial infarction 
(MI), or death .] 
2. Intraoperative successful exclusion of LAA . [Defined as no (0 mm) flow be tween LAA and 
LA and < 5 mm LAA remnant by [CONTACT_335960]. ] 
3. Composite event rates between the group of subjects diagnosed with POAF (AtriClip vs no 
AtriClip) through 365 days’  post index procedure and between the group of subjects not 
diagnosed with POAF (AtriClip vs no AtriClip) through 30 days’  post index procedure.  Events 
to be evaluated include: Thromboembolic & Hemorrhagic Events such as cerebrovascular 
accident (CVA), transient ischemic attack (TIA), peripheral ischemia, hemorrhagic stroke, 
neurologic bleed, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, or other major bleeding event.   
4. Composite event (listed above) rates through [ADDRESS_414911] index procedure for all AtriClip 
patients, regardless of whether the patient develops  POAF . 
5. Healthcare resou rce utilization variance between groups as related to the composite events 
above.  [Specifically hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77076] -of-stay (LOS), reoperation for bleeding, neurologic 
consults for stroke or TIA, emergency department (ED) visits, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5394].]

Version date:  15Feb2017/ Rev: H  
 
9.3 Healthcare resource utilization  
Healthcare resource utilization will be compared between groups.   Major resource use collected at various 
study visits/follow -up calls will include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256944] (OR time, LOS , etc.), cardiac related medication 
use, readmissions, including [ADDRESS_414913] sources (DRGs, CPT  code s, RedBook, published studies for SAE and Rehab, etc.) may be assigned 
to assess economic impact and summed over the 365-day treatment period to obtain total treatment costs.    
9.4 Sample Size and Power  
This is a prospective, multicen ter, randomized (2:1), unblinded study conducted in up to 2000 patients at 
risk of POAF based on the CHA2DS2 -VASc and HASBLED scoring  at up to 20 [LOCATION_003] sites.  All patients 
who undergo a valve or CABG (structural heart) procedure with direct visual access to the LAA will be 
eligible to participate based upon the inclusion and exclusion criteria defined in this protocol.   
 
 
    
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
    
 
    
  
A total of up to 2 000 patients (approx. 1333  in AtriClip group, approx. 667 in SOC group) at risk of POAF 
will be enrolled in this study. It is  assume d that 40% of the patients will be diagnosed with POAF. A two 
treatment group one -sided Z -test with continuity correction and an  = 0.05 will hav e 80% power to detect 
the difference between a medical management (SOC) safety rate of PS = 12.5% and a mechanical exclusion 

  
Study Number: CP2015 -[ADDRESS_414914] : Clinical Study Protocol    
Version date:  15Feb2017/ Rev: H  
 
(AtriC lip) safety rate of PC = 6.25% at [ADDRESS_414915] -op when the sample size (for completers) for patients 
diagnosed with POAF is 485 in the AtriClip group and 243 in the SOC group (a total sample size of 728). 
Adjusting for loss to follow -up, 533 patients in the AtriClip group and 267 in the SOC group (a total sample 
size of 800) are expected to be diagnosed  with POAF.  
9.5 Randomization  
Upon enrollment, subjects will be assigned a sequential identification number at each site and a 
corresponding sealed envelope which will be opened prior to the index procedure t o reveal the treatment 
group. Subjects will be randomized 2:1 (2 with AtriClip  to 1 anticoagulation therapy and without AtriClip).  
Randomization sequences will be generated by [CONTACT_335961] 9.4 (SAS Institute 
Inc., Cary, North Carolina)  and will be stratified by [CONTACT_3725].   
9.6 Analysis Populations  
Intent -To-Treat  (ITT) Population:  The effectiveness, safety, health economic and Qualify of life analyses 
will be base d on the ITT p opulation. The ITT Population is defined as all subjects randomized to either the 
AtriClip LAA Closure or anticoagulation therapy and witho ut AtriClip  LAA  Closure group and  on whom 
the surgical  index procedure is attempted (even if the index procedure is aborted).  
POAF Diagnosis (POAF) Population:  This population will include all ITT subjects diagnosed with POAF. 
This will be the primary analysis population for effectiveness and health economic endpoints.  
Per-Protocol (PP) Population:  A PP population may be defined for effectiveness, health economi c and 
Quality of Life analyses. This population is defined by [CONTACT_335962], that is, those that could potentially bias the results.  
9.[ADDRESS_414916] deviation, median, minimum, 
maximum by [CONTACT_212638] (AtriClip LAA Closure or anticoagulation therapy and without AtriClip  LAA  
Closure ). Tabulation of categorical variables by [CONTACT_335963]. 95% confidence 
intervals will be provided as appropriate.  
Since this is an exploratory study, additional analyses, additional analysis populations, covariates and 
summary tables and/or graphs will be generated as needed.  
In all analyses described below, the null hypothesis will be a two -sided test of no treatment group difference. 
All statistical tests will use a two -sided significance level of =0.05.  
9.7.1 Effectivenes s and Health Economic Analysis  
A Pearson’s Chi -Squared test will be used to compare the incidence of successful LAA exclusion between 
the two procedure groups. Alternatively, a Fisher’s Exact test will be used if justified by [CONTACT_335964] 
(less than 5 ) and Clopper -Pearson (Exact) 95% CI will also be reported.  
In addition, LAA exclusion might also be analyzed using multiple logistic regression model with the 
proportion of the event of successful LAA exclusion as the dependent variable and the following  
independent variables: sites (or clusters of sites), surgical approach (sternotomy, right mini -thoracotomy or 
other), age, gender, CHA2DS2 - VASc score, HASBLED score and relevant interaction terms.  
  
Study Number: CP2015 -[ADDRESS_414917] : Clinical Study Protocol    
Version date:  15Feb2017/ Rev: H  
 
Healthcare resource use will be assessed by [CONTACT_335965], treatment costs or formal 
cost effectiveness/cost utility analysis.   Resource use such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], OR time, and total 
treatment costs will be compared between the treatment groups using a two -way analysis of variance  
(ANOVA) model with procedure group (AtriClip LAA Closure or anticoagulation therapy and without 
AtriClip LAA Closure) and site as fixed effects in the model.   
These endpoints will also be compared using the two -sided t -test. A Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] -Wilk test of normality will be 
performed and if the normality assumption is not met, an approximate non -parametric model (e.g. Wilcoxon 
rank-sum test) may be performed.  
A Pearson’ s Chi -Squared test will be used to compare difference in 30 day readmits, number of neurological 
consults, additional procedures, and patient medication use between the two procedure groups.    
Formal economic models utilizing treatment effectiveness (Quali ty adjusted life years, costs to reduce 
stroke, etc.) may be built with collected data and other secondary sources accounting for specific country 
perspective and discounted appropriately.    
9.7.2 Safety Analysis  
A Pearson’s Chi -Squared test will be used to compare the incidence of complications associates with LAA 
exclusion between the two procedure groups. Alternatively, a Fisher’s Exact test will be used if justified by 
[CONTACT_335964] (less than 5) and Cloppe r-Pearson (Exact) 95% CI will also be reported. Thromboembolic 
and hemorrhagic events will be similarly analyzed.  
In add ition, complications associated with LAA exclusion and thromboembolic/hemorrhagic might also be 
analyzed using multiple logistic regres sion model similar to the effectiveness endpoint (successful LAA 
exclusion) described above.  
9.[ADDRESS_414918] caused or contributed to a death or 
serious injury or th at indicates the AtriClip device has malfunctioned and would be likely to cause or 
contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur will be reporte d in compliance with 
21 CRF Part 803.  
In addition to general surgical risks, addition al risks specifically associated with the AtriClip implant are 
as follows:  
 Incomplete exclusion of left atrial appendage (LAA)  
 Additional surgery if the device is not placed in the correct position.  
 Allergic reaction to the implant materials  
  
Study Number: CP2015 -[ADDRESS_414919] : Clinical Study Protocol    
Version date:  15Feb2017/ Rev: H  
 
 Device misplac ement or embolization  
 Device breakage  
 Inability to move or retrieve device  
There may also be other risks that are unforeseen at this time.  
10.1 Adverse Events  
10.1.1  Definition of an Adverse Event  
Adverse Event (AE): any undesirable clinical occurrence or change from  a patient’s baseline (pre -index 
procedure) condi tion, whether it is device related or not.  
 Adverse Event Identification: a condition that is one of the following:  
a. A unique symptom or event that is a change from the subject’s baseline status  
b. A series of s ymptoms or events that can be categorized as a single entity based on definitions 
found herein  
c. A specific diagnosis responsible for a clinical change  
d. A worsening or exacerbation of a pre -existing condition  
10.2 Serious Adverse Event s 
10.2.1  Definition of a S erious Adverse Event  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE): any adverse event is considered serious if it results in death, is life 
threatening, requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (initial or prolonged), results in disability or permanent damage, causes 
congenital anomaly/birth defe ct, requires intervention to prevent impairment or damage, or other serious 
(important medical events) which may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes.  
Note : “Death” should not be repor ted as an adverse event.  The cause of death should be reported as an 
adverse event.  The only exception is “Sudden De ath” when the cause is unknown.  
10.2.[ADDRESS_414920] be reported by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) by [CONTACT_335966] .  The electronic Adverse Event Form is 
necessary if the event was related to the AtriC lip device or placement of the device.   In addition, subject 
death must be reported to the IRB in accordance with IRB requirements.   
10.2.3  Adverse Event Classification  
The investigator is required to provide:  
 Time interval of the event – The time interval of the  occurrence  of the adverse event should be 
assessed in relationship to timing of the index procedure (AtriClip  placement)  
 Date of event onset and outcome of the event, or date of death  
 Severity of the event – (Mild, Moderate, Severe)  
 Action taken for medical management of the event  
 Relationship of the event – it is the PIs responsibility to assess the relationship of an AE and provide 
primary cause.  Events will be categorized by [CONTACT_335967], the applier,  ancillary 
device, and t he index procedure or other .   
  
Study Number: CP2015 -[ADDRESS_414921] : Clinical Study Protocol    
Version date:  15Feb2017/ Rev: H  
 
 Adverse events will be assessed to determine if the event  meets the definition of a serious  adverse 
event .   
10.2.4  Reporting  Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator (or designee) will record all AEs (both serious and no n-serious and regardless of 
relationship) in the source documents .  The Investigator at each site participating site is responsib le for 
reporting AEs and SAEs to AtriCure only when they are related to the LAA exclusion index procedure or 
device .  AEs related to the LAA exclusion procedure or device will be reported on the eCRF.  The CRFs 
allow the investigator to indicate whether or not the adverse events are related to the AtriClip device or 
AtriClip placement (index procedure).  
 Use a separate Adverse  Event Form to document each event  
 The Adverse Event Form must be electronically signed by [CONTACT_335968]: It is the responsibility of the Investigator to inform their IRB of SAEs as required by [CONTACT_335969].  
All Serious Adverse Events that are related to the LAA exclus ion index procedure or device m ust be 
reported by [CONTACT_335970] [ADDRESS_414922] led to death should be reported within 24 hours.  
The Investigator shall send a written report including a narrative description of the SAE to Atr iCure within 
three (3) working days of the initial report.  The Investigator should follow all unresolved SAEs until the 
events are resolved, or the subject has exited the study or  the AE is otherwise explained.  
11.[ADDRESS_414923] to reporting under that Medical Device 
Reporting (MDR) regulation, AtriCure shall submit to the FDA the appropriate reports required by [CONTACT_335971] [ADDRESS_414924] 
of a malfunction to  a device’s essential functionality.  AtriCure will follow - reference documents  
 medical device in compliance 
with reporting, 21 CFR Part 803 and 21 CFR Part 820: Code of Federal R egulations, Quality system 
Regulations.

Health  Questionnaire / English  version  for the [LOCATION_003]  SCRIPT  FOR  TELEPHONE  INTERVIEW  
 
 
GENERAL INTRODUCTION  
It is suggested  that the telephone  interviewer follows the script  of the EQ -5D. Although  allowance  should  
be made  for the interviewer’s  particular style  of speaking,  the wording of  the questionnaire  instructions 
should  be followed  as closely  as possible. In the case of the EQ -5D descriptive system  on pages [ADDRESS_414931]  be followed.  
 
It is recommended  that the interviewer  has a copy  of the EQ -5D in front of  him or  her as it  is administered 
over the telephone.  This enables  the respondent’s  answers  to be entered  directly  on the EQ -5D by [CONTACT_335973]  (i.e. the appropriate  boxes  on pages  2 and 3 are marked  and the scale  
on page 4 is marked  at the point  indicating  the respondent’s  ‘health today’).  If the respondent  asks for 
clarification,  the interviewer  can help by  [INVESTIGATOR_1312]-reading  the question verbatim.  The interviewer should  not try 
to offer his  or her  own explanation but  suggest  that the  respondent  uses his or  her own  interpretation.  
 
If the respondent  has difficulty  regarding  which  box to mark,  the interviewer  should  repeat  the 
question  verbatim  and ask the respondent  to answer  in a way that most  closely  resembles  his or her 
thoughts  about  his or her health  today.  
 
INTRODUCTION TO  EQ-5D 
(Note  to interviewer:  please read the following)  
We are  trying  to find  out what you think  about your health.  I will first ask you some  simple  questions about 
your health TODAY. I will then ask  you to rate your health on  a measuring  scale.  I will explain  what  to do 
as I go along  but please interrupt  me if you do not understand  something  or if things are  not clear  to you. 
Please  also remember  that there  are no right  or wrong  answers.  We are interested  here only in your personal  
view.

PAIN  / DISCOMFORT  
Next  I'd like to ask you about  pain or discomfort.  Would  you say that:  
1. You have  no pain or discomfort?  
2. You have  slight  pain or discomfort?  
3. You have  moderate  pain or discomfort?  
4. You have  severe  pain or discomfort?  
5. You have  extreme  pain or discomfort?  
(Note  to interviewer:  mark  the appropriate box  on the EQ-5D questionnaire)  
 
ANXIETY  / DEPRESSION  
Finally,  I'd like to ask you about  anxiety  or depression.  Would  you say that: 
1. You are not anxious  or depressed?  
2. You are slightly  anxious  or depressed?  
3. You are moderately  anxious  or depressed?  
4. You are severely  anxious  or depressed?  
5. You are extremely  anxious  or depressed?

EQ VAS:  INTRODUCTION  
(Note  for administrator: If  possible, it  might  be useful to  send a visual  aid (i.e. the EQ  VAS) before the  
telephone  call so that the respondent  can have this in front of him or her when completing  the task)  
Now,  I would  like to ask you to say how good  or bad your  health  is TODAY.  
I'd like you to try to pi[INVESTIGATOR_335936]  a scale  that looks  a bit like a thermometer.  Can you do 
that?  The best health  you can imagine  is marked  100 (one hundred) at  the top of the scale  and the 
worst  health  you can imagine  is marked  0 (zero)  at the bottom.  
 
EQ VAS:  TASK  
I would  now like you to tell me the point  on this scale  where  you would  put your  health  today.  
(Note  to interviewer:  mark  the point  on the  scale  at the  point  indicating  the respondent’s ‘health  today’)  
Thank you for taking the time  to answer  these  questions.

APPENDIX 2 - Risk/Benefit Assessment  
 
Risk Category:  Minimal . 
Summary :  The AtriClip device is commonly used for the exclusion of the left atrial appendage (LAA). 
The risks to subjects undergoing surgery to place the AtriClip device are listed below.  
 
1.0 POSSIBLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS:  
Risks associated with having the AtriClip placed (does not address the risks and discomforts associated 
with cardiac surgery).  
 
Possible risks and discomforts that may be associated with the use of the AtriClip during procedure are 
identified below.  
 Incomplete exclusion of left atrial appendage (LAA)  
 Additional surgery i f the device is not placed in the correct position.  
 Allergic reaction to the implant materials  
 Device misplacement or embolization  
 Device breakage  
 Inability to move or retrieve device  
 Injury, perforation or tear of the LAA which may lead to blood loss  
 
POTENTIAL RISKS  
Complications may occur at any time during the procedure, post procedure or follow -up period that could 
specifically occur with the AtriC lip® or the placement of the AtriC lip® include the following:  
 Myocardial infarction  
 Blood loss requirin g transfusion  
 Cerebrovascular accident (CVA)  
 Circumflex artery impi[INVESTIGATOR_20804]  
 Death  
 Stroke  
 Pericarditis  
 Peripheral ischemia  
 Transient ischemic attack (TIA)  
 
2.0 POSSIBLE BENEFITS  
Benefits may include but are not limited to, the following:  
 Prevention of thromboem bolic events (blood clots).  
 Prevention of ischemic stroke and systemic (non -CNS) embolism.  
  
Study Number: CP2015 -[ADDRESS_414935] : Clinical Study Protocol    
Version date:  15Feb2017/ Rev: H  
 
 Elimination of oral blood thinners resulting in a reduction of bleeding complications associated 
with long -term anticoagulation.  
 Eliminating the need for life -long compliance to oral anticoagulant therapy and the frequent blood 
tests (depending on oral anticoagulant agent), and lifestyle changes associated with blood thinning 
medications.  
 Advancing the medical and scientific knowledge that may benefit future patients  with similar 
conditions may be gained through this clinical study.  
 There may also be other benefits that are unforeseen at this time.  
 
3.0 ALTERNATIVE PROCEDURES/TREATMENTS  
There are some alternative ways for closing your left atrial appendage that does not i nvolve using the 
AtriClip:  
 Sewing or closing appendage with sutures or ligatures  
 Stapling the appendage closed with a medical stapling device  
 
MINIMIZATION OF RISKS  
Measures which will be taken to minimize risks related to the study include:  
 The investigators in this study will be selected based on their experience in treating  patients with 
atrial fibrillation and performing surgical  procedures  
 Investigators will be chosen that are qualified to complete study index procedures and are 
experienced in the placement of the AtriCure AtriClip device.  
 Well defined clinical study protocol, including specific inclusion/ exclusion criteria to  enroll 
appropriate subjects in the trial.  
 Close patient monitoring during the surgica l procedure and follow -up period.  
 
Alternative to Participation:   Patients may decline and would be treated with the same standard of care.   
CONCLUSION :  This clinical study is justified because the study sponsor and clinical  investigators 
believe the pot ential benefits outweigh the potential risks.

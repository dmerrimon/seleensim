Samidorphan, a Component of ALKS 3831, in Adults with Schizophrenia Treated with Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896117]. of Study Centers: This is a multi -center study  
Studied Period:  
Estimated date first patient consented: June [ADDRESS_1256228] patient completed: June 2015 Phase of development: 2 
Objectives:  
The objecti ves of this study are to evaluate 3 doses of samidorphan co -administered with olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 
(ALKS 3831) in subjects with schizophrenia to (1) evaluate ALKS 3831 as a treatment for 
schizophrenia, (2) assess the safety and tolerability of ALKS 3831 , and (3) cha racterize the impact of the 
samidorphan component of ALKS 3831 on weight and other metabolic factors. 
Methodology: 
This is a Phase 2, randomized, placebo -controlled multicenter study, which will be conducted in 2 parts: 
Part A and Part B. Part A will begin with screening and will include a 1 -week olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_582421] -in period 
followed by a 12-week double-blind, placebo- controlled treatment period where subjects will receive 
samidorphan or placebo (in addition to the olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896118] 1). Part B will include an 
additional 12- week treatment period where all subjects will receive active olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] + samidorphan (ie, 
ALKS 3831). At the end of Part B, samidorphan dosing will stop, but olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896119] 4- week follow-up period, which includes [ADDRESS_1256229] (DSMB) to monitor for tolerability of 
study drug. After at least [ADDRESS_1256230] will be available in the 
DSMB Charter.  
During clinic visits, assessments of psychotic symptoms using measures such as the Positive and 
Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Clinical Global Impressions- Severity (CGI -S) will occur. Body 
weight will be measured using consistent methods at every visit. Alcohol and drug use will be monitored 
throughout the study. Concentrations of samidorphan, RDC-9986 (primary metabolite of samidorphan), 
and olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896120] 2 -23. 
Part A (Screening, Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896121] -in, and Double -blind Treatment Period)  
Screening assessments will occur in the 30 -day period before subjects report to the clinic for verification 
of eligibility and initiation of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_99646] (Study Day 1). On Study Day 1 (Visit 2), all eligible 
subjects will be initiated on olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896122] ( PI) based upon individual subject needs and consistent with current clinical prac tice. 
Subjects will return one week later (ie, Study Day 8, Visit 3) for a 2 -night inpatient stay and the start of 
the 12-week double-blind placebo- controlled treatment period. At this visit, subjects will be randomized 
in a 1:1:1:1 ra tio to receive samido rphan (5, 10, or 20 mg) or placebo. Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896123]. Thus, the Part A treatment groups will be as follows:

• Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] + Samidorphan (10 mg) • Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] + Placebo  
All study drug will be taken once daily by [CONTACT_1966]. Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_249674]/placebo tablets should 
be taken together (ie, at the same time). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_896180][INVESTIGATOR_582421]-in period (ie, from Day 1 to Day 8), with subjects grouped into the 
following 3 strata: 
• Weight change ≤0 kg • Weight increase >0 to <1 kg • Weight increase ≥1 kg 
Subjects will be discharged from the inpatient unit on Study Day 10 (Visit 5) and will return on Study Day 15 (Visit 6 ). 
Subjects are not required to be taking any antipsychotic medication at the time of screening or Visit 2. However, those who are will be tapered off of their prior antipsychotic medication within two weeks after initiation (ie, by [CONTACT_995] 15, Visit 6). This cross-taper from prior antipsychotic treatment to 
olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896124].  
After Study Day [ADDRESS_1256231] month of double-blind treatment (ie, Study Day 36) and then every [ADDRESS_1256232] who prematurely discontinues during Part A will be asked to return to the clinic for an early termination  
(ET) visit and will be asked to return for follow -up visits 2  and 4 weeks later.

Shaded cells represent inpatient stays.  
Assessments prior to study drug administration at Visit 13 (the transition visit) will serve as end of Part A assessments; dosing and post- dose assessments will be considered Part B assessments.  
Part B (Active ALKS 3831 Treatment and Safety Follow- up Periods)  
After completion of Part A (ie, at Visit 13), subjects will transition into Part B and will continue onto a 
12-week active treatment period during which all subjects will receive ALKS 3831 (ie, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896126]). Subjects who had been receiving ALKS 3831 during the double-blind period will 
continue on the same dose for the 12 -week active treatment period. Subjects who had been receiving 
olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] + placebo in the double -blind period will continue on the same dose of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896127] (at the highest dose). 
At Visit 13 (Study  Day 92), subjects will be admitted for a 2 -night inpatient stay (Visits 13 -15, Study 
Days 92 -94) to allow for monitoring following initiation of samidorphan dose in subjects originally 
assigned to the olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] + placebo group. The inpatient stay is required for all subjects. After 
discharge (Study Day 94), subjects will return 5 days later for Visit 16 (Study Day 99). After Visit 16, 
subjects will be seen weekly for the next 3 weeks (Visits 17 -19) and then at 2- week intervals for the 
remainder of the stu dy (Visits 20 -25). 
The subject will take the final samidorphan dose the night before Visit 23 (Study Day 176). No samidorphan dose will be administered onsite during Visit 23. Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896128] a 4 -week follow -up period:  A safety follow -up visit will occur 2 weeks after and

Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion:  
Adul ts (18 -50 years of age) with stable schizophrenia who may benefit from olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_99646], who 
have a body mass index (BMI) of 17-30 kg/m2, who have maintained a stable body weight for at least 
3 months prior to screening (change ≤5%) and from screening to Visit 2 (change ≤1 kg), and who have 
not been exposed to olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], mesoridazine, chlorpromazine, or thioridazine for more than 
[ADDRESS_1256234] dosage and mode of administration: 
ALKS  3831 refers to the combination of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_249674]. In this study, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896129]- administered. Commercially available olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896130]. 
Samidorphan will be provided by [CONTACT_456]. Each tablet contains samidorphan (2.5, 5 or 10 mg). 
Subjects will take 2 tablets per day by [CONTACT_1966] (ie, doses of samidorphan will be 5, 10, or 20 mg). 
Samidorphan is a Schedule II controlled substance according to the [LOCATION_002] Drug Enforcement 
Agency and will require proper handling. 
Reference product dosage and mode of administration:  
Placebo consists of tablets identical in size and appearance to the samidorphan tablets, but without active 
samidorphan. Subjects will take 2 tablets per day by [CONTACT_1966].  
Duration of study: The study duration for each subject will be approximately 33 weeks and will include 
25 study visits. This includes up to one month for screening, a 1- week lead -in period of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896131], two 12- week treatment per iods (a 12 -week double-blind placebo-controlled period and a 
12-week period where all subjects get active ALKS  3831), and safety follow-up visits which occur 2 and 
4 weeks after Visit 23 . 
Criteria for evaluation:  
Safety Assessments  
Safety will be evaluated based on the following measures:

• Laboratory parameters including HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose 
and insulin, ratio of fasting glucose to fasting insulin, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), C -reactive 
protein, leptin, bicarbonate, and carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT)  
Reported AE terms will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®) 
preferred terms and system organ classes. Concomitant medications will be categorized using the World 
Health Organization (WHO) Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system.  
Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
For all subjects, plasma samples will be collected according to the schedule in Table  1 and Table  2 for 
quantifying olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], samidorphan, and RDC-9986 (primary metabolite of samidorphan) concentrations. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data may be used to assess compliance with study drug 
administration and/or in a subsequent population PK evaluation conducted outside of this study. 
Efficacy Assessments  
Efficacy will be evaluated based on following measures:  
• Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)  
• Body weight 
• Waist circumference  
• Clinical Global Impressions -Severity (CGI -S) 
• Impact of Weight on Quality of Life – Lite Question naire (IWQOL -Lite)  
• Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP)  
• Timeline Follow -Back (TLFB) assessment of alcohol drinking  
• Food Craving Inventory (FCI)  
Other Assessments:  
Pharmacogenetic assessments to explore the relationship between olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-induced weight gain and 
genotype and identify people susceptible to weight gain  
Endpoints:  
Primary Endpoint:  Absolute change in PANSS total score from randomization to the end of Part A 
Secondary Endpoints:  
• Percent change in body weight  
• Number and percentage of subj ects with adverse events from randomization to the end of 
Part A  
• Absolute change in body weight 
• Proportion of subjects exhibiting significant weight gain (definition of weight gain will include body weight gain greater than 7%) 
• Absolute change in CGI-S  
 
Protocol Amendment #3- CZ CONFIDENTIAL  Alkermes, Inc  
13 June 2014 ALK3831-302 
Page 7 Additional Endpoints:  
• Change in waist circumference  
• Change in blood lipid concentrations including LDL, HDL, total cholesterol and 
triglycerides  
• Change in assessments related to glucose regulation including fasting glucose and insulin, fasting glucose to fasting insulin ratio, HbA1c, C- reactive protein, leptin and bicarbonate  
• Change in vital signs including blood pressure 
• Change in IWQOL- Lite scales (physical function, self -esteem, sexual life, public distress 
and work) and total score 
• Change in PSP 
• Change in FCI  
• Change in alcohol and drug use  
Statistical methods:  
Once all subjects have completed Part A of the study, an unblinded analysis of the 12- week placebo -
controlled data will be performed. This analysis may be conducted prior to the completion of Part B of the study. 
Safety 
All subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug (olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], samidorphan, or placebo) will be 
included in the safety analysis. The secondary endpoint, number and percentage of subjects with adverse 
events from randomization to the end of Part A, will be analyzed descriptively by [CONTACT_1570]. Adverse events will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_61132]® preferred terms and system organ class 
as well as by [CONTACT_110204]. Additional analysis of safety assessments will 
include summary statistics including mean, median, interquartile range, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables and number and percent for categorical variables. These statistics will be provided 
for the following: AEs, ECG parameters, laboratory test results, vital signs, and C -SSRS results during 
the entire study. 
Efficacy  
The efficacy analysis will be conducted on 2 full analysis set (FAS) populations: 
• The FAS [ADDRESS_1256235]- baseline PANSS assessment.  
• The FAS [ADDRESS_1256236]- baseline 
weight assessment.
 
The primary endpoint is the absolute change in PANSS total score from randomization to the end of Part 
A (ie, the end of the 12- week, placebo -controlled double- blind treatment period) and will be evaluated 
by [CONTACT_1570] (ALKS 3831 vs. the placebo group [olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_582419]]) using a 2-sided mixed-model 
for repeated measures ( MMRM ) to test for equivalence at an alpha level of 0.05. The primary analysis 
will be conducted in the FAS 1 population. More details about this analysis will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
The secondary endpoint, percent change in weight from randomization to the end of Part A, will be evaluated by [CONTACT_896181]. However, this wi ll be a superiority analysis. Each treatment group will be compared to the placebo 
Protocol Amendment #3- CZ CONFIDENTIAL  Alkermes, Inc  
[ADDRESS_1256237] for superiority at an alpha level of 0.05. The secondary 
efficacy analysis will also be conducted in the FAS 1 population. More details about this analysis will be 
provided in the SAP.  
Analysis of  other secondary endpoints and additional endpoints will include inferential analyses and 
descriptive analyses by [CONTACT_765] (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous 
variables and number and percent for categorical variables), as appropriate.  
Analyses for the primary and secondary endpoints will be repeated in the FAS [ADDRESS_1256238] deviation of 20 points, and a 
true difference of 0 points. With these assumptions, 280 randomized subjects provide 95% power to detect  equivalence on the primary endpoint (absolute PANSS total score change from randomization to 
the end of Part A) with a 2- sided test at an alpha level  of 0.05. These 280 subjects represent 70 subjects 
for each treatment arm (ALKS 3831 5 mg, ALKS  3831 10 mg, ALKS 3831 20 mg, and placebo) in a 
1:1:1:1 ratio. For the primary analysis, subjects in the 3 ALKS  3831 treatment groups will be pooled for 
comparis on with placebo. If this analysis shows equivalence, follow-up analyses on individual dose 
levels will be performed . Assuming a 20% discontinuation rate prior to randomization, an estimated 350 
subjects will be enrolled in this study.

[ADDRESS_1256251] compliance and 
retention of patients on olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_127245] [ Lieberman, 2005]. In particular, results of the 
CATIE (Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness) study identify olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896133] (4.2 kg over up 
to 18 months of treatment and an overall >7% body weight in 30% of subjects) and a 
comparatively higher discontinuation rate due to increases in body weight and metabolic effects than other antipsychotic agents [Lieberman, 2005] . Further, it is estimated that between 40 -60% 
of people with schizophrenia abuse alcohol and/or illicit drugs [ Lubman, 2010], and these “dual 
diagnosis” patients have worse outcomes on a variety of measures [Batki, 2009;Dixon 1999 ]. 
ALKS  [ADDRESS_1256252] seen in a proof -of- concept study conducted in 
healthy adults (Study ALK33-301). This eff ect appears to be specific to antipsychotic weight 
gain because samidorphan did not cause meaningful changes in weight when administered as a single agent in adults with  binge eating disorder (Study ALK33-101). 
As stated previously, despi[INVESTIGATOR_896134], safety and tolerability limitations have affected compliance and retention of patients on olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_127245]. As a result, many patients are switched from 
olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896135] a ntipsychotics to address tolerability issues even if the alternative 
antipsychotic is regarded as less effective. The presence of samidorphan in ALKS 3831 is to 
enhance the benefit and decrease the risk of the principal ingredient, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. 
In addition to enhancing the safety of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], samidorphan may help with substance abuse in 
schizophrenia. Comorbid substance abuse is regarded as a considerable obstacle in the treatment and management of many patients with schizophrenia. Samidorphan (also referr ed to as ALKS 
33 or RDC-0313) is structurally derived from naltrexone and like naltrexone, acts as an antagonist at μ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_896136]/antagonist activity at both κ and δ receptors. In laboratory animals and in humans, samidorphan is a potent µ-antagonist. Clinical data have 
shown that samidorphan blocked both the subjective and physiological effects of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_896137] (Study ALK33 -004). In adults with alcohol dependence, samidorphan was 
associated with a reduction in drinking behavior (Study ALK33-005). 
Thus, the combination of samidorphan and olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (ie, ALKS 3831) as a fixed-dose 
combination may result in an enhanced therapeutic agent for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. ALKS 3831 could thereby [CONTACT_896182]/risk profiles for schizophrenia patients for whom olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896138].

In this study, samidorphan and olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896139]- administered oral tablets. The following 
sections provide an overview of samidorphan and olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. Detailed information about the 
study drugs can be found in the ALKS 3831 Investigator ’s Brochure  (IB) and Zyprexa® 
(olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) [LOCATION_002] (US) Package Insert [2011] respectively . 
5.2.1. Samidorphan 
Samidorphan is a new chemical entity in clinical development by [CONTACT_43421]. It is an opi[INVESTIGATOR_249679] µ opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328], with mixed 
agonist/antagonist activity at δ and κ receptors. It is currently being investigated as a single agent for the treatment of reward disorders, in combination with buprenorphine for the treatment of 
major depressive disorder and for the treatment of cocaine dependence, and in combination with 
olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_249680]. Based on its chemical structure, samidorphan is a Schedule II  controlled substance according to the US Drug Enforcement Agency and will require 
proper handling (see Section  10). 
Ten clinical studies of samidorphan have been conducted to date, 8 of which included subjects that received samidorphan alone (not in combination with another product). Overall, 
approximately [ADDRESS_1256253] been exposed to samidorphan. Commonly reported adverse 
events (AEs) observed across all studies included nausea, fatigue, and somnolence. Overall, no trends or clinically meaningful changes have been observed in clinical laboratory analytes, vital 
sign parameters, or electrocardiogram (ECG) data.  
5.2.2. Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896140] 1996 and was originally approved for the 
treatment of schizophrenia, but has since been approved for other indications including the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents and bipolar disorder. The safety and tolerability profile 
of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_249682], and adverse event labeling is supported by [CONTACT_530771] 8,500 adult patients [ 2011]. Commonly reported AEs consistent 
across all or most dosage forms in short-term, placebo controlled trials include somnolence, constipation, dry mouth, accidental injury, weight gain, postural hypotension, dizziness, asthenia, fever and abnormal gait. 
5.3. Study Ra tionale  
Schizophrenia is a lifelong illness and changes in medication are often made to better manage 
evolving symptoms and to control side effects and/or tolerability issues. Similar to what was 
done in the landmark CATIE study [ Lieberman, 2005] , this study is seeking to enroll patients 
that are psychiatrically stable, where stability is largely defined by [CONTACT_896183]. In these patients, stability may still reflect a 
sub-optimal condition that could be improved by [CONTACT_896184] a different medication. Other 
patients may be well-controlled on their current antipsychotic, but may be experiencing 
unpleasant or intolerable side effects such as hyper prolactinemia or extrapyramidal symptoms. 
These patients may also benefit from switching to a different medication.  
Protocol Amendment #3- CZ CONFIDENTIAL  Alkermes, Inc  
[ADDRESS_1256254] the potential to increase patient retention on therapy and improve long term outcomes.  
One Phase 1 study, ALK33-301, has been conducted in healthy adults (N = 106) to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of samidorphan taken with olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530676]-induced weight gain. The co-administration of samidorphan (5 mg) and olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896141] [ADDRESS_1256255] the pharmacokinetics (PK) of either individual drug. 
Alkermes refers to the combination of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896142] 3831. The current 
Phase 2 study in adults with schizophrenia will assess the efficacy of ALKS 3831 on psychiatric 
symptoms , the safety and tolerability of  ALKS 3831, and whether subjects receiving ALKS 3831 
gain less weight than subjects receiving placebo . 
Future studies will explore other anticipated benefits conferred by [CONTACT_203844] 3831 opi[INVESTIGATOR_710102]. 
5.4. Dose Rationale  
Commercially available olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896143]  (PI) based on the individual subject’s clinical condition. 
Clinical studies investigating the safety, tolerability, PK , and exploratory efficacy with 
samidorphan have found this compound to be safe and generally well tolerated following single 
oral doses of 1-55.7 mg and up to 12- weeks of once daily oral or sublingual (1-10 mg) 
administration (see ALKS 3831 IB). The samidorphan dose levels (oral administration) in the 
current trial (5, 10, and 20 mg) were selected based on PK, pharmacologic, and safety 
considerations. It is expected that these doses will be sufficient to establish a therapeutic dose 
range and inform dose selection for future studies.  
Based on the divergent metabolic pathways of samidorphan and olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and supported by 
[CONTACT_109972] a prior clinical trial and an in vitro investigation, no PK drug -drug interactions are 
anticipated in the patient population.

7.4. Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects who withdraw from the study after randomization will not be replaced. 
8. STUDY DESIGN 
8.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
It is not unusual for prescribing physicians to consider a change in a patient’s antipsychotic 
medication  (see Section  5.3). Reasons for considering a change often include insufficient control 
of symptoms and/or tolerability issues. In some cases, patients who are apparently adequately 
controlled may wish to change therapi[INVESTIGATOR_896147]. 
This study will include subjects who have a diagnosis of schizophrenia who have not been 
exposed to olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], mesoridazine, chlorpromazine, or thioridazine for more than one week  within the past year or at any time in the 3 months prior to screening.  
This is a Phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter study, which will be conducted in two parts: Part A and Part B. Part A will begin with screening and will include a 1 -week 
olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_582421] -in period followed by a 12-week double-blind, placebo- controlled treatment 
period where subjects will receive samidorphan or placebo (in addition to the olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896118] 1). Part B will include an additional 12- week treatment period where all 
subjects will receive active olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] + samidorphan (ie, ALKS 3831). At the end of Part B, 
samidorphan dosing will stop, but olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896119] 4-
week follow-up period, which includes [ADDRESS_1256275] (DSMB) to monitor for 
tolerability of study drug. After at least one week of safety data has been collected for [ADDRESS_1256276] will be availabl e in the DSMB Charter.

Page 24 This is Alkermes’ first study of the co -administration of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896148] a 
population of adults with schizophrenia. In addition, this study includes higher doses of 
samidorphan than the 5-mg dose that was used in a prior study (ALK33 -301). Samidorphan has 
been associated with somnolence, and olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896149] w ith orthostatic 
hypotension. In ALK33-301, there was no apparent additive effect of the co-administration on either of these adverse effects. However , because the current study involves higher doses of 
samidorphan than studied previously, it was desired to take a conservative approach by 
[CONTACT_896188] 2 nights following randomization (Visit 3) and 
transition (Visit 13) . 
During clinic visits, assessments of psychotic symptoms using measures such as the PANSS and 
CGI-S will occur. Body weight will be measured using consistent methods at every visit. 
Alcohol and drug use will be monitored throughout the study. Concentrations of samidorphan, RDC -9986 (primary metabolite of samidorphan), and olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896150] 2 -23. 
8.1.1. Part A (Screening, Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896121] -In, and Double -Blind Placebo -Controlled 
Treatment Period)  
Screening assessment s will occur in the 30-day period before subjects report to the clinic for 
verification of eligibility and initiation of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_99646] (Study Day 1). On Study Day 1 (Visit 2), all eligible subjects will be initiated on olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896151]. Subjects will return one week later (ie, Study Day 8, Visit 3) for a 2- night inpatient stay 
and the start of the 12-week double-blind placebo -controlled treatment period. At this visit, 
subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive samidorphan (5 mg, 10 mg, or 20 mg) or 
placebo. Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896152]. Thus, the Part A treatment groups will be as follows: 
• Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] + Samidorphan (5 mg) • Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] + Samidorphan (20 mg) 
• Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] + Samidorphan (10 mg)  • Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] + Placebo  
All study drug will be taken once daily, by [CONTACT_1966], at the same time. Subjects will be encouraged 
to take study drug in the evening or at bedtime. Study drug administration may be adjusted to 
accommodate study procedures. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_896180][INVESTIGATOR_582421] -in period (ie, from Day 1 to Day 8), with subjects grouped 
into the following 3 strata:  
• Weight change ≤0 kg • Weight increase >0 to <1 kg • Weight increase ≥1 kg 
This stratification will be used for analyses of secondary endpoints as specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) . 
Subjects will be discharged from the clinic on Study Day 10 (Visit 5), and will return on Study Day 15 (Visit 6). 
Subjects are not required to be taking any antipsychotic medication at the time of screening or 
Visit 2. However, those who are will be tapered off of their prior antipsychotic medication within 
2 weeks af ter initiation (ie, by [CONTACT_995] 15, Visit 6). This cross -taper from prior antipsychotic

[ADDRESS_1256277] month of double-
blind treatment (ie, Study Day 36) and then every [ADDRESS_1256278] who prematurely discontinues during Part A will be asked to return to the clinic 
immediately for an ET visit and after 2 and 4 weeks for follow-up visits. 
Assessments prior to study -drug administration at Visit 13 (the transition visit) will serve as end 
of Part A assessments; dosing and post- dose assessments will be considered Part B assessme nts. 
8.1.2. Part B (Active ALKS  3831 Treatment and Safety Follow- up Periods)  
After completion of Part A (ie, at Visit 13), subjects will transition into Part B and will continue 
onto a 12- week active treatment period during which all subjects will receive ALKS 38 31 (ie, 
olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] + samidorphan). Subjects who had been receiving ALKS 3831 during the double-
blind period will continue on the same dose for the 12- week active treatment period. Subjects 
who had been receiving olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] + placebo in the double-blind period will continue on the 
same dose of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896153] (at the highest 
dose). 
At Visit 13 (Study Day 92), subjects will be admitted for a 2 -night inpatient stay to allow for 
monitoring following initiation of samidorphan dose in subjects originally assigned to the 
olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] + placebo group. Because treatment assignments in the double-blind period must 
remain blind until all subjects have completed Part A or been discontinued from the study, the inpatient stay is required for all subjects. After discharge (Study Day 94), subjects will return 
5 days later for Visit 16 (Study Day 99). After Visit 16, subjects will be seen weekly for the next 3 weeks (Visits 17-19) and then at 2-week intervals for the remainder of the study (Visits 20 -25). 
The subject will take the final samidorphan dose the night before Visit 23 (Study Day 176) . No 
samidorphan dose will be administered onsite during Visit 23. Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896152]. Two safety follow-up visits will occur [ADDRESS_1256279] who prematurely discontinues from the study during Part B will be asked to return to the clinic 
for an ET visit and follow-up visits 2 and 4 weeks after the ET visit. 
8.2. Schedule of Visits and Assessments  
The schedule of visits and assessments for Part A is shown in Table 1. The schedule of visits and 
assessments for Part B is shown in Table 2. 
Because fasting glucose and ins ulin levels will be measured at some visits, subjects will be 
instructed not to eat or drink for 8 hours before these visits: Visit 2, Visit 3, Visit 13, and Visit 23/ET (see Table 1 and Table 2). Random glucose and insulin levels will be measured at visits 
where glucose and insulin measurements are indicated, but fasting is not required. 
For a missed visit, the site should attempt to contact [CONTACT_281692].  
Prematu re discontinuation procedures are provided in Section 7.3.

9.1. Study Drug Dose and Administration  
Study drugs include samidorphan and matching placebo tablets, and olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530727], all for 
oral administration. Samidorphan is a Schedule II substance, and should be stored, dispensed, and otherwise handled in accordance with the associated regulations . 
Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896167]. 
During the inpatient stays, study drug will be dispensed once daily, and the time of 
administration will be at the discretion of the clinic staff. Time of administration at any visit (inpatient or outpatient) may be adjusted as needed to accommodate post- dose measurements. 
Before being discharged from each inpatient s tay, and at each outpatient post-randomization 
study visit until Visit 23/ET, all subjects will receive blister cards containing samidorphan or placebo for self administration. Subjects will be instructed to take [ADDRESS_1256311] and  their olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530733](s) once daily in the evening or at bedtime until Visit 23. 
The subject will take the final samidorphan dose the night before Visit 23. No samidorphan dose will be administered onsite during Visit 23/ET. Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896152]. Two safety follow-up visits will occur [ADDRESS_1256312] who 
prematurely discontinues from the study during Part B will be asked to return to the clinic for an 
ET visit and follow-up visits 2 and 4 weeks after the ET visit.  
Subjects should take all study drug tablets (olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_249674]/placebo) orally and at 
the same time. Subjects should be advised that somnolence may occur with dosing and thus they 
should avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until they have determined how the study 
drug affects them.  
Subjects will be instructed to keep all unused tablets in their blister card and not to mix tablets between blister cards and bottles.  Subjects will also be instructed to return unused tablets to the 
site when they return for their next visit. If dosing occurs at this visit, the dose should be taken 
from subjects’ next blister card. The dose should not be taken from the blister card the subjects are returning. 
If a dose is missed or forgotten, subjects will be instructed to resume the regular dosing schedule 
the following evening. Subjects will be instructed not to take a double dose to try to “make up” 
for a missed dose. 
9.2. Treatment Compliance  
As described in Section 8.3.22, study personnel will assess treatment compliance at every visit 
from first dose of study drug at Visit 2 through Visit 23/ET accounting for the dispensed tablets 
(samidorphan, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and placebo accounting for dosed, lost/missing, or rema ining tablets). 
Additional measures of compliance may be used; these will be described in the Operational Plan 
as necessary. Study drug accountability will be performed using an EDC system. Subjects who 
have demonstrated compliance during the first week of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_896168]-blind treatment (samidorphan or placebo).

9.3. Randomization and Blinding  
Part A of this study will be conducted in a double-blind fashion. On Day 8 (Visi t 3), subjects will 
be randomized to receive one of the following regimens in a 1:1:1:1 ratio: 
• Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] + Samidorphan (5 mg) 
• Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] + Samidorphan (10 mg)  
• Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] + Samidorphan (20 mg)   
• Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] + Placebo  
Randomization will be performed centrally  through an IWRS system and will be stratified by [CONTACT_896192][INVESTIGATOR_582421]-in period (ie, from Day 1 to Day 8), with 
subjects grouped into the following 3 strata: 
• Weight change ≤0 kg 
• Weight increase >0 to <1 kg 
• Weight increase ≥1 kg 
Alkermes staff, clinical staff, and subjects will remain blinded to treatment assignment until Part A of the study is complete. All  staff will remain blinded except when their 
study function requires unblinding (eg, drug supply management, IWRS operation, DSMB 
operation, etc). These unblinded staff will follow procedures designed to ensure that study 
integrity is maintained.  
9.4. Breaking Study Blind  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_530724]- related medical decisions. Emergency unblinding may b e done 
without contact[CONTACT_30697] a medical monitor. Any premature unblinding should be promptly 
documented and explained to the medical monitor within [ADDRESS_1256314] the blind for the 
remaining subjects.  
Once Part A of the study is complete (ie, the final subject has completed the final Part A 
assessment), the Part A data will be locked, unblinded, and the Part A data analyses will be 
conducted. This may occur prior to the completion of Part B of the study; however individual 
treatment assignments will remain blinded to the sites.

Page 48 13. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
Safety will be assessed from randomization to the end of Part A. Part B data will be used to 
examine longer- term safe ty. The number and percentage of subjects with AEs from 
randomization to the end of Part A is included as a secondary endpoint. In addition to this secondary  endpoint, safety will be evaluated based on AEs, vital signs, clinical laboratory 
assessments (hem atology, blood clinical biochemistry, and urinalysis), 12-lead ECG findings, 
and data from C- SSRS surveys.  
13.1. Safety Endpoints  
• Number and percentage of subjects with adverse events from randomization to the 
end of Part A 
• Change in blood lipid concentrations including LDL, HDL, total cholesterol and triglycerides  
• Change in assessments related to glucose regulation including fasting glucose and insulin, fasting glucose to fasting  insulin ratio, HbA1c, c-reactive protein, leptin and 
bicarbonate 
• Change in vital signs including blood pressure 
13.2. Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product. The occurrence, which may or may not have a causal 
relationship with the  investigational treatment, may include any clinical or laboratory change that 
does not commonly occur in that subject and is considered clinically significant. 
Illnesses present prior to the subject signing the main ICF are considered to be pre- existing 
conditions and are documented on the medical history eCRF. Pre-existing conditions that worsen 
during the study are entered on the AE eCRF. 
All out-of- range laboratory values will be deemed as clinically significant or not clinically 
significant by [CONTACT_978] (or designated investigator). Clinically significant values will be considered 
AEs and recorded as such on the eCRFs. 
13.3. Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE, occurring at any dose and regardless of causality that 
meets o ne or more of the following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening. The subject is at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurs. This does not include reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death.

• Is a congenital anomaly/ birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. 
At Visits [ADDRESS_1256318]’s schizophrenia without a worsening of the subject’s baseline clinical status or the 
development of new signs or symptoms , and is confirmed as such by [CONTACT_7195], the 
event should be categorized as an AE, not an SAE. 
Admission to an inpatient unit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34092] a non- medical reason (ie, social -stay admission) 
during the trial is considered an AE, not an SAE. 
13.4. Relationship to Study Drug  
The assessment of study drug relationship to each AE will be reported on the appropriate source 
document (and SAE form, in the event of an SAE) by [CONTACT_978]  (or designated investigator ) 
according to his/her best clinical judgment. The criteria listed in Table [ADDRESS_1256319] be present to be indicative of a particular drug relationship. All study drugs are considered “test drugs” for the purposes of the definitions 
listed in the table.  However, relationship and action taken will be separated out in the EDC to 
assess for olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_249674]/placebo separately. The PI  (or designated investigator ) 
can attribute relationship to olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], samidorphan/placebo or both.

completion of the safety follow-up visit. Any AE or SAE having an onset a fter the safety 
follow- up visit will not be collected or reported unless the PI (or designated investigator ) feels 
that the event may be related to the study drug.  
Subjects will be instructed by [CONTACT_978] (or designee ) to report the occurrence of any AE. All 
volunteered, elicited, and observed AEs are to be recorded on the AE eCRFs. 
The PI (or designated investigator) will assess all AEs regarding any causal relationship to the 
study drug (see Section  13.4), the intensity (severity) of the event, action taken, and subject

• Mild:  Causes awareness of sign or symptom, but is easily tolerated; does not interfere 
with usual activities  
• Moderate:  Causes discomfort enough to interfere with usual activities  
• Severe:  Is incapacitating; results in inability to work or perform usual activities  
All AEs will be followed until resolution, until deemed stable by [CONTACT_978], or until the subject i s 
deemed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_44091] -up.

14.4. Efficacy Analyses  
The primary endpoint is the absolute change in PANSS total score from randomization to the end of Part A (ie,  the end of the 12-week, placebo-controlled double-blind treatment period) and will 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_1570] (ALKS 3831 vs. the placebo group [olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_582419]]) using a 2-sided mixed -model for repeated measures (MMRM) to test for equivalence at an alpha level of 
0.05. The primary analysis will be conducted in the FAS [ADDRESS_1256325] for superiority at an alpha le vel of 0.05. 
The secondary efficacy analysis will also be conducted in the FAS 1 population. More details 
about this analysis will be provided in the SAP. 
Analysis of other secondary endpoints and additional endpoints will include inferential analyses 
and descriptive analyses by [CONTACT_765] (mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous 
variables and number and percent  for categorical variables), as appropriate.  
Analyses for the primary and secondary endpoints will be repeated in the FAS 2 population as sensitivity analyses when applicable. Additional details regarding these analyses will be provided 
in the SAP.

SEVERITY (CGI -S) SCALE  
Rating Clinician-rated
Administration time Varies with familiarity with
patient
Main purpose T o provide a global rating of illness
severity, improvement and response to treatmentPopulation Adults
Commentary
Amongst the most widely used of extant brief assessment
tools in psychiatry, the CGI is a 3-item observer-ratedscale that measures illness severity (CGIS), globalimprovement or change (CGIC) and therapeutic response.The illness severity and improvement sections of theinstrument are used more frequently than the therapeuticresponse section in both clinical and research settings. TheEarly Clinical Drug Evaluation Program (ECDEU) ver-sion of the CGI (reproduced here) is the most widely usedformat, and asks that the clinician rate the patient relativeto their past experience with other patients with the samediagnosis, with or without collateral information. Severalalternative versions of the CGI have been developed, how-ever, such as the FDA Clinicians’ Interview-BasedImpression of Change (CIBIC), which uses only informa-tion collected during the interview, not collateral. TheCGI has proved to be a robust measure of efficacy inmany clinical drug trials, and is easy and quick to admin-ister, provided that the clinician knows the patient well. 
Scoring
The CGI is rated on a 7-point scale, with the severity ofillness scale using a range of responses from 1 (normal)through to 7 (amongst the most severely ill patients).CGI-C scores range from 1 (very much improved)through to 7 (very much worse). Treatment responseratings should take account of both therapeutic efficacyand treatment-related adverse events and range from 0(marked improvement and no side-effects) and 4(unchanged or worse and side-effects outweigh the thera-peutic effects). Each component of the CGI is rated sepa-rately; the instrument does not yield a global score.

Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the patient at this time?
0 = Not assessed 4 = Moderately ill1 = Normal, not at all ill 5 = Markedly ill2 = Borderline mentally ill 6 = Severely ill3 = Mildly ill 7 = Among the most extremely ill patients
2. Global improvement: Rate total improvement whether or not, in your judgement, it is due entirely to drug treatment.
Compared to his condition at admission to the project, how much has he changed?0 = Not assessed 4 = No change1 = Very much improved 5 = Minimally worse2 = Much improved 6 = Much worse3 = Minimally improved 7 = Very much worse
3. Efficacy index: Rate this item on the basis of drug effect only .
Select the terms which best describe the degrees of therapeutic effect and side effects and record the number in the box where the twoitems intersect.EXAMPLE: Therapeutic effect is rated as ‘Moderate’ and side effects are judged ‘Do not significantly interfere with patient’s f unctioning’.

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR 
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must ask about all types)  
Lifetime  
Actual Attempt:   
A potentially self-injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of a ct. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent 
does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not 
have to be any in
jury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, 
this is consider
ed an attempt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal 
act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g. gunshot to head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] a high floor/story). Also, if 
someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt? 
Have you done anyt
hing to harm yourself? 
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died? 
What did you do? 
Did you______ as a way to end your life?  
Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  
Were you trying to end your life when you _____? 
Or did you think it was possible you could have died from_____? 
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better, get sympathy, 
or get something else to happen)?  (Self-Injurious Behavior without suicidal intent)

occurred).  
Overdose: Person has pi[INVESTIGATOR_24609].  Once they ingest any pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], this becomes an attempt rather than an interrupted attempt. 
Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by [CONTACT_24663], or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, 
even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around neck

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR 
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must ask about all types) Since Last 
Visit  
Actual Attempt:   
A potentially self-injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of a ct. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent 
does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not 
have to be any in
jury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, 
this is consider
ed an attempt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly 
lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g. gunshot to head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] a high floor/story). 
Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt? 
Have you done anyt
hing to harm yourself?  
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died? 
What did you do? 
Did you______ as a way to end your life?  
Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  
Were you trying to end your life when you _____? 
Or did you think it was possible you could have died from_____? 
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better, get 
sympathy, or get something else to happen)?  (Self-Injurious Behavior without suicidal intent)

Interrupted Attempt:    
When the person is interrupted (by [CONTACT_24662]) from starting the potentially self-injurious act  (if not for th at, actual attempt would have 
occurred).  
Overdose: Person has pi[INVESTIGATOR_24609].  Once they ingest any pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], this becomes an attempt rather than an interrupted attempt. 
Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by [CONTACT_24663], or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, 
even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around 
neck but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so.

than 20% of body; extensive blood loss but can recover; major fractures). 
4.  Severe physical damage; medical  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24611] (e.g. comatose without reflexes; third-degree burns over 20% of body; 
extensive blood loss with unstable vital signs; major damage to a vital area).

Potential Lethality: Only Answer if Actual Lethality=0 
Likely lethality of actual attempt if no medical damage (the following examples, while having no actual medical damage, had potential for very serious 
lethality: pu
t gun in mouth and pulled the trigger but gun fails to fire so no medical damage; laying on train tracks with oncoming train but pulled away 
before run over). 
 
0 = Behavior not likely to result in injury 
1 = Behavior likely to result in injury but not likely to cause death

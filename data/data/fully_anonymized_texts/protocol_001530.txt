CYSTIC FIBROSIS RELATED BONE DISEASE: THE ROLE OF CFTR  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_601168]  
8/28/2015, Version [ADDRESS_796066] reported  that BMD measured by [CONTACT_601179].2-5 For example, in a recent meta -analysis, the prevalence of T -scores between -1 
and -2.5 in patients aged 18 -32 years old with CF was 38%, and the prevalence of T -
scores less than -2.5 wa s 23.5%, whereas the expected prevalence would be 
approximately 18% and 2.5% for people of this age.6  In addition, bone turnover may be 
uncoupled in patients with CF with elevated bone resorption and low bone formation.7,8 
 
Fracture rates in patients with  CF are higher than in the healthy population.9-12  In the 
previously mentioned meta -analysis, the prevalence of vertebral and non -vertebral 
fractures in adults with CF was 14% and 19.7%, respectively.[ADDRESS_796067]  also suggested that  the CF genetic mutation in  itself may play a causative 
role in low bone density and fracture seen in this population .   
 
1.2 Potential Role of CFTR in CF Related Bone Disease  
Cystic fibrosis is caused by a  mutation in the cftr gene, which encodes the CF 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR).  CFTR traditionally serves as a chloride 
channel in epi[INVESTIGATOR_601169]. Interestingly, recent evidence 
in mouse models suggests that CFTR is also present in bone cells and may play a role in 
bone formation and resorption. Knockout mice for cftr (cftr -/cftr-) have significantly 
decreased bone density  and decreased bone formation rates compared to normal mice, 
even in t he setting of normal lung and gastrointestinal  function.18-20  In addition, h uman

8/28/2015, Version [ADDRESS_796068]  
Several modalities are currently available for the clinical measurement of bone density, 
including dual -energy x -ray absorptiometry (DXA) and peripheral quantitative computed 
tomography (pQCT). Each of these modalities possess inheren t limitations in the 
evaluation of CF -related bone disease due to unique factors complicating their 
interpretation.  
 
At the present time, DXA is the primary method for measuring BMD and assessing 
fracture risk in both children and adults.  DXA expresses bo ne mineral content (in grams) 
per unit area (cm2) so that results are expressed as g/cm2. Because DXA values are 
expressed per unit area rather than per unit volume, DXA does not truly give a measure 
of bone mineral density (which would be expressed as g/c m3); rather, it gives values for 
“areal” or two -dimensional bone density. As such, DXA values are influenced by [CONTACT_601180], overestimating BMD for large bones and underestimating BMD for small bones, as 
are seen in many patients with CF. This artifact does not occur with techniques that 
provide volumetric (i.e., three -dimensional) measurements of BMD. Moreover, DXA 
cannot distinguish between trabecular and cortical bone.26,[ADDRESS_796069] increased risk of fracture even with normal DXA BMD measurements.10

is not ideal for assessing small differences in c ortical thickness and does not allow for 
assessment of other bone micro -architecture features including cortical porosity.  
 
1.5  High Resolution Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HR -pQCT)  
HR-pQCT is  a new imaging modality that has a resolution (voxel size) of 82 um, which 
allows for the assessment of the microstructure of bone (e.g., cortical thickness, 
trabecular number and thickness, trabecular spacing, and cortical porosity) in three 
dimensions and has the potential to provide a more accurate  estimation of bone strength 
using microfinite element analyses. In addition, it measures true volumetric bone density, 
rather than areal bone density, of the total bone segment as well as the individual cortical 
and trabecular compartments. 29-[ADDRESS_796071] of smaller voxel size 
(82um vs. 0.4mm), lower radiation dose, and faster scanning time. HR-pQCT is currently 
being studied as an alternative method of me asuring bone density, predicting fracture, 
and assessing response to medications used to treat osteoporosis. Presently, studies using 
HR-pQCT in various disease populations, including type [ADDRESS_796072] at baseline 
and 12 and 24 months after initiating this medication and then compared to CF patients 
not receiving this medication as well as healthy subjects matched for age and gender.  
This study is highly innovative. U sing cutting edge ima ging techniques, we will assess 
the use of bone micro -architectural changes as a novel outcome in the assessment of 
medical interventions in CF patients. In addition, this study will provide important 
information regarding the pathogenesis of cystic fibros is related bone disease and the 
underlying role of CFTR, and will help guide future management and prevention of this 
disease.  These data can also serve as supportive evidence for future studies assessing the 
effects of VX -770, as well as to validate anoth er outcome measure studying future CFTR 
modulators.

8/28/2015, Version 8  1.7 Preliminary Studies  
To learn more about the underlying alterations in bone micro -architecture in CF patients , 
we are currently recruiting  subjects with CF for a cross sectional study at MGH (protocol  
2011P000893, SPID 978). The goal of this study is to use HR -pQCT to describe the 
micro -architectural basis for the differences in BMD in patients with cystic fibrosis, 
which will expand our understanding of the pathogenesis of the reduced bone mass seen 
in patients with this disease.  Fifty subjects (25 male and 25 female) with CF between the 
ages of 18 -30 years are being recruited through the Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7724] (CHB) 
and the [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (MGH) Cystic Fibrosis Centers to enroll in  this 
cross -sectional study. Subjects undergo a laboratory evaluation and complete health, 
medication, and nutrition surveys at the MGH Clinical Research Center (CRC), followed 
by [CONTACT_11323] x -ray absorptiometry (DXA) and HRp -QCT scans at the MGH Bone 
Density Center . Five  patients have currently completed this study. Once completed, data 
will be compared to healthy controls matched for age and gender.  
 
 
2. SPECIFIC AIM  AND HYPOTHESES  
 
Specific Aim  1: To assess the change in bone micro -architecture, bone st rength, and 
bone turnover markers over time in CF subjects treated with VX -770 (ivacaftor) 
compared to CF subjec ts not receiving this medication . 
Primary Hypothesis:  Total, cortical, and trabecular volumetric densities, as well as 
overall bone strength (es timated failure load) will  be higher  in subjects in subjects treated 
with VX -770 than in  those who are not receiving this medication.    
Secondary Hypothesis:  Markers of bone formation will increase and markers of bone 
resorption will decrease in subjects t reated with VX -770 medication compared to those 
who are not receiving this medication . 
 
Specific Aim  2: To assess the change in bone micro -architecture, bone strength, and 
bone turnover markers over time in CF subjects not treated with VX -770 compared to 
healthy  subjects . 
Primary Hypothesis:  Total, cortical, and trabecular volumetric densities, as well as 
overall bone strength (estimated failure load) will  be lower  in CF subjects  and will 
decline  over time  compared to healthy subjects . 
Secondary Hypothesis:  Markers of bone formation will be lower  and markers of bone 
resorption will be higher  in CF subjects compared  to healthy subjects .

5.1.1 Additional information on high resolu tion peripheral computed tomography 
(Xtreme CT)  
XtremeCT (Scanco Medical AG, Basserdorf, Switzerland) is a new technology capable 
of assessing volumetric bone density as well as trabecular and cortical micro -architecture 
at the distal radius and distal ti bia, with a nominal isotropic voxel size of [ADDRESS_796084] system (Figure 1) employs a two -dimensional detector array in combination 
with a small -angle cone beam X -ray source (0.07 mm spot focal size), enabling the 
simultaneous acquisition of a stack of parallel CT slices with a nominal resolution (voxel 
size) of 82 µm (100 µm at 10% MTF). The X -ray tube employs an effective energy of 60 
kVp, with a current of 95 mAs.  The field of view is 130 mm and maximum scan length 
is 150 mm. T he short -term reprod ucibility of measurements with this device is excellent, 
with precision errors of 0.7 to 1.5% for total, trabecular and cortical bone densities and 
2.5 to 4.4% for trabecular architecture measures.  
 
Scan acquisition:  During scan acquisition, the arm or l eg of the patient is immobilized in an 
anatomically formed carbon fibre shell. An antero -posterior scout view is used to define the 
measurement region. At each skeletal site, [ADDRESS_796085] analyses, a 
reference line is manually placed at the endplate of the radius and tibia, as shown in Figure 
2 (middle and right). The first CT slice is acquired 9.5 mm and 22.5 mm proximal to the 
reference line for th e distal radius and distal tibia, respectively (Figure 2). In subjects under 
17 years of age, the reference line will be set at the 8% site at the radius and 7% site at the 
tibia in order to avoid radiation to the growth plate, based on previously publishe d data 
using Xtreme CT in children and adolescents.42-43

The following data will be obtained at both sites: total bone area, cortical area, trabecular 
area, total volumetric bone density, cortical volumetric bone density, cortical thickness,  
trabecular vo lumetric bone density, trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular 
number, trabecular separation, trabecular thickness, cortical porosity, and estimated bone 
strength (calculated microfinite element).  
 
 
6. BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
6.1 Study  Outcomes /Endpoints  
The primary outcome of specific aim [ADDRESS_796086] 
parameters (trabecular number, trabecular spacing, cortical porosity, and microfinite 
element of the radius and tibia), DXA values (BMD of spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], hip, radius, and total body), 
and bone turnover markers.  
 
6.2 Statistical Methods  
Statistical analysis wi ll include descriptive statistics, with determination of means and SD 
of change in each primary and secondary outcome variable from baseline to 12 and 24  
months for all three cohorts . For specific aim 1, mean change in primary outcome in 
cohorts 1 and 2  will be compared with independent -sample t -tests (or Wilcoxon rank sum 
if non -normality is detected) . For specific aim 2, mean change in primary outcome in 
cohorts 1 and 2  will be compared with independent -sample t -tests (or Wilcoxon rank sum 
if non -normalit y is detected) . Longitudinal linear mixed models will be applied to 
evaluate longitudinal changes in BMD, bone microarchitectural parameters, and bone 
turnover markers over the 2 -year period in each group . Length of time between follow up 
visits will be ac counted for in statistical analyses. Statistical analysis will be performed in 
consultation with a study statistician.   
 
6.3 Sample Size Considerations:  
Sample -size calculations were performed after consultation with our biostatistician using 
data from [ADDRESS_796087] at the MGH 
Bone Density Center as well as previously published reproducibility data.31 A sample 
size of Cohort 1 n=30 and Cohort 2 n=30 would provide 80% power (Type II err or = 0.2) 
to detect an eff ect on the  primary outcome  variable (mean change in cortical volumetric 
density of the radius and tibia over 24 months) of 2.3 -3.1% using a pre -post correlation of 
0.7. Based on numbers of CF patients both with and without G551D mutations treated at 
the MG H and CHB CF Centers, we will have adequate access to subjects to meet this 
sample size requirement.

7.  Potential pi[INVESTIGATOR_601174] a randomized control trial would be the ideal study design to evaluate the 
effects of VX -770 on bone, we believe it would be unethical to withhold this medication 
from subjects who qualify for it given its previously established efficacy and the nature of 
this ultimately fatal disease. Therefore, we propose a prospective multiple cohort  study, 
using subjects with CF who are not eligible for this medication (i.e. have CF mutations 
other than G551D ) and healthy subjects without CF .  Although this will necessitate 
inherent genetic differences between CF cohorts , there are no animal studies that confir m 
phenotypic bone differences between G551D  in particular and other genotypes. One 
study by [CONTACT_601185] D F508 mutations have lower  
bone density th an those wi thout this mutation, though this was  limited by [CONTACT_601186] G551D  mutations . 
Further studies on genotype -phenotype bone differences are required.  
 
Because of this study design , confounders may  exist between cohorts. In addition, i f lung 
and other organ fun ction improve  with VX -770, this may independently affe ct bone 
density apart from the direct  effects of the drug on bone. Therefore, we will plan to 
collect data regarding physical activity,  sun exposure,  medication use (including 
glucocorticoids), gonadal function  (menstr ual history in women,  morning  testosterone 
levels in men), inflammatory markers, PTH/vitamin D, BMI , and fat/lean body mass by 
[CONTACT_11324] . We will adjust for  potential confounders  that are significantly difference between 
cohorts in our  multivaria te analysis.  
 

CYSTIC FIBROSIS RELATED BONE DISEASE: THE ROLE OF CFTR  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_601168]  
8/28/2015, Version [ADDRESS_796088] proposed a separate study to  add bone turnover makers  
to saved sera from the previous  VX-770 phase 3 clinical trial25 to determine if changes in 
bone resorption and formation occurred over the course of the year -long study . If 
significant changes in bone turnover are found, this will  add furt her support to the present 
proposal .

in patient s with CLL/SLL 
• To investigate predictive biomarkers and mechanism of resistance  
Study Design:  This is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, Phase 3 study designed to 
compare the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib versus ofatumumab in 
patient s with relapsed/refractory CLL or SLL with active disease 
requiring treatment (as defined by [CONTACT_36104] 2008 criteria  for initiation of 
therapy) who have failed at least 1 prior line of therapy and are not 
appropriate candidates for treatment  or retreatment  with purine analog 
based therapy . 
Eligible patient s will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into 2 arms  to receiv e 
either IV ofatumumab (Treatment Arm A) per package insert or ibrutinib  
(Treatment Arm B)  [ADDRESS_982502] .  
Two randomization schemes will be generated: one for each geographic 
region (North America versus Rest of World).  Under each scheme, 
patients will be randomized based on the following two stratification 
factors:  disease refractory  to purine analog and anti -CD20 containing 
chemoimmunotherapy regimen, and the del etion  17p13.1 (17p  del).  The 
stratified analysis will be performed based on  these two randomization 
stratification factors . 
Assessment for tumor response and progression will be conducted in 
accordance with the IWCLL 2008 criteria for patient s with CLL and SLL 
until progressive disease with the modification that isolated treatment-related lymphocytosis will not  be considered as disease progression  as 
recommended by [CONTACT_66866] 2008 guideline clarification ( Hallek 2012 ) 
and the  National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN), [ADDRESS_982503] patien t is enrolled, 
at which time a  long-term  extension study will be made available for 
patient s who choose to continue ibrutinib on a clinical protocol  when 
access to commercial ibrutinib is not feasible.
 
An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will monitor the 
safety of the study.  
Population:  Patients with CLL or SLL who have failed at least 1 prior line of therapy 
and are not considered appropriate for treatment or retreatment  with 
purine analog based therapy .

Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 20 of 114 1. INTRODUCTION  
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)/ Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL) are a malignancy 
of B-cells that predominantly affects the older population.  Chemoimmunotherapy, in particular 
the combination of purine analogs (eg, fludarabine) with cyclophosphamide and rituximab, has 
become a standard for the treatment of young and/or fit individuals with CLL who require 
treatment.  However, elderly patients and those with comorbidities are often unable t o tolerate 
combination chemoimmunotherapy regimens, or experience inferior clinical outcomes when treated with these regimens.  In addition, those patients who have a deletion in the short arm of 
chromosome 17p13.1 (17p del) and/ or those who fail to achieve a response or experience short 
remissions to purine analog based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_720028]/or experience short remission durations and rapid progression of 
disease when treated with standard and curren tly available treatment regimens.  
The generation and maintenance of normal and malignant B- cells is controlled by [CONTACT_720061] B- cell receptor (BCR).  Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) is an enzyme 
required for BCR signaling.  Selective BTK inhibition is a novel approach to target diseases driven by [CONTACT_720062], such as B-cell lymphoma and leukemia. 
Ibrutinib (I
MBRUVICA®) is a first- in-class, potent, orally administered, covalently binding 
inhibitor of BTK co -developed by [CONTACT_147456] & Development 
LLC for the treatment of B -cell malignancies.   
Ibrutinib has been approved in many regions, including the US and EU, for indications covering 
up to the following: treatment of patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received 
at least 1  prior therapy, patients with CLL/SLL, including CLL /SLL with a deletion of the short 
arm of chromosome 17 (del17p), and patients with Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia.  Ibrutinib 
is currently under investigation in various indications as a single agent and in combinations. 
For the most comprehensive nonclinical and clinical information regarding ibrutinib background, 
safety, efficacy, and in vitro and in vivo preclinical activity and toxicology of ibrutinib, refer to 
the latest version of the ibrutinib  Investigator's Brochure  (IB). 
1.1. Ibrutinib  
“Ibrutinib” and "PCI- [ZIP_CODE]” refer to the same molecule; hereafter, “ibrutinib” will be used.  
Ibrutinib is 1-[(3R) -3-[4-amino -3-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazolo [3, 4 d] pyrimidin -1-yl]-1-
pi[INVESTIGATOR_33214]]-2-propen-1-one and has a molecular weight of 440.50 g/mole (anhydrous basis).  Ibrutinib  is a white to off -white crystalline solid.  It has a single chiral center and is the 
R-enantiomer.  The investigational drug product, ibrutinib , is an oral formulation containing 
micronized ibrutinib .

IND # 102,688   Version: Amendment 7 
Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 21 of 114 1.1.1. Mechanism of Action of Ibrutinib  
Ibrutinib binds covalently to a cysteine residue (Cys-481) near the BTK active site and inhibi ts 
the enzymatic activity of purified BTK with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of 
0.5 nM ( Honigberg 2010; Pan 2007).  Covalent binding to Cys- [ADDRESS_982540] the 
potential to be irreversibly modified  by [CONTACT_9059] .  The other Cys-481 containing kinases include 
EGFR (IC
50 = 12 nM), HER2 (IC 50 = 22 nM), HER4 (IC 50 = 0.6 nM), ITK (IC 50 = 12 nM), 
BMX (IC 50 = 1 nM), JAK3 (IC 50 = 22 nM), and BLK (IC 50 = 1 nM). 
A fluorescently -tagged derivative of ibrutinib  was shown to bind predominantly to BTK in 
B-cell lysates suggesting a high degree of specificity within B- cells ( Honigberg 2010).  
Ibrutinib also has reversible inhibitory activity against other kinases that do not contain Cys -481 
(Honigberg 2010).  However, assuming a rapid off- rate, any reversible kinase inhibition in vivo  
is likely to be short -lived, since, in humans, the effective half -life of ibrutinib following oral 
dosing is only 1.5 to 3.3 hours (as measured from time of  maximum drug concentration [T max] 
to 6 hours postdose). 
Thus, by [CONTACT_720063], ibrutinib  
provides a unique approach to improve selectivity for BTK in vivo  relative to reversibly inhibited 
off-target kinases.  
1.1.2. Cellular Selectivity of Ibrutinib  
BTK expression is limited to cells of hematopoietic origin.  The cellular selectivity of ibrutinib  
was demonstrated by [CONTACT_720064] -receptor signaling in B- cells, 
but not in T- cells.  In ex vivo  stimulation assays, ibrutinib  inhibits human BCR activation 
(IC 50 <10 nM) in B- cells, but does not affect T- cell receptor activation ( Honigberg 2010).  
It has also been confirmed that ibrutinib  inhibits key phosphorylation events downstream of the 
BCR at similar concentrations.  Ibrutinib  has been studied in other cell types where the function 
of BTK is understood, including mast cells, basophils, monocytes, macrophages, and platelets.  
Consiste nt with the functional role of BTK in mast cells and basophils, Pharmacyclics 
determined that ibrutinib  fully inhibits degranulation following stimulation at the high -affinity 
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor ( MacGlashan 201 1; Chang 2011a ).  In monocytes and 
macrophages, ibrutinib  inhibits the secretion of pro- inflammatory cytokines following 
stimulation at the Fc-gamma receptors ( FcγR) by [CONTACT_720065] ( Chang 2011a ).  Consistent 
with the proposed function of BTK in platelets, unpublished data from Pharmacyclics also shows 
that ibrutinib inhibits shear -force and collagen -induced platelet aggregation in vitro  
(IC50 = 10-100nM).

Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 22 of 114 1.2. Summary of Nonclinical Data  
For more detailed and comprehensive information of ibrutinib , please refer to the Investigator's 
Brochure ( IB). 
1.2.1. Nonclinical Pharmacology Studies  
Ibrutinib  was designed as a selective and covalent  inhibitor of the BTK protein ( Pan 2007).  
In vitro , ibrutinib  is a potent inhibitor of BTK activity (IC 50 = 0.39 nM).  The irreversible 
binding of ibrutinib  to Cys-481 in the active site of BTK results in sustained inhibition of BTK 
catalytic activity and enhanced selectivity over other kinases that do not contain a c ysteine at this 
position.  When added directly to human whole blood, ibrutinib  inhibits signal transduction from 
the BCR and blocks activation of B- cells (IC 50 = 80 nM) as assayed by [CONTACT_14181] -IgM s timulation 
followed by [CONTACT_398]69 expression ( Herman  2011). 
Ibrutinib  arrested cell growth and induced apoptosis in human B- cell lymphoma cell lines 
in vitro  and inhibited tumor growth in vivo  in xenograft models ( Herman  2011).   Ibrutinib also 
inhibited adhesion and migration of MCL cells in co-culture and reduced tumor burden in lymph 
node and bone marrow in a murine model of MCL dissemination and progression ( Chang 2013a ; 
Chang 2013b). 
1.2.2. Safety Pharmacology and Toxicology 
No treatment -related effects were observed in the central nervous system or respi[INVESTIGATOR_183900]. Further, no treatment- related corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation 
effect was observed at a ny tested dose in a cardiovascular study using telemetry-monitored dogs. 
Based on data from rat and dog including general toxicity studies up to [ADDRESS_982541] potential for human toxicity with ibrutinib is predicted to be in lymphoid tiss ues 
(lymphoid depletion) and the gastrointestinal tract (soft feces/diarrhea with or without 
inflammation). Additional toxicity findings seen in only one species with no observed human 
correlate in clinical studies to date include pancreatic acinar cell atrophy (rat), minimally 
decreased trabecular and cortical bone (rat) and corneal dystrophy (dog). In studies in pregnant 
rats and rabbits, ibrutinib administration was associated with malformations (teratogenicity) at 
ibrutinib doses that result in approximately 14 and 2 times the exposure (area under the 
concentration -time curve [AUC]) in patients administered the dose of [ADDRESS_982542]: IBRUTINIB (PCI -[ZIP_CODE])  Protocol PCYC -1112- CA 28 September 2016  
IND # 102,688   Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_982543] Metabolism  
Following oral administration of ibrutinib at doses ranging from 420 to 840 mg/day, exposure to 
ibrutinib increased proportionally with substantial intersubject variability.   The mean terminal 
plasma elimination half li fe (t 1/2) of ibrutinib ranged from 4 to 13 hours, with a median time to 
maximum plasma concentration (T max) of 2 hours.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_720029], the favorable safety profile of  ibrutinib allows dosing with or 
without food.  Ibrutinib is extensively metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_9058] P450 (CYP)  3A4.  
The on- target effects of the main metabolite PCI -[ADDRESS_982544] dose exposure 
implying non- clinically relevant accumulation.  Less than 1% of ibrutinib is excreted  in the 
urine. Ibrutinib exposure is not altered in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) >30  mL/min.  
Patients with severe renal im pairment or patients on dialysis have not been studied.  Following 
single dose administration, the AUC of ibrutinib increased 2.7-, 8.2- and 9.8-fold in subjects with 
mild (Child -Pugh class A), moderate (Child- Pugh class B), and severe (Child -Pugh class  C) 
hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal liver function.   A higher proportion of 
Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions were reported in patients with B -cell malignancies (CLL, 
MCL and WM) with mild hepatic impairment based on NCI organ dysfunction working group (NCI -ODWG) criteria for hepatic dysfunction compared to patients with normal hepatic 
function.

metabolism, please refer to the current version of the IB. 
1.3.2. Clinical Studies  
As of [ADDRESS_982545] received single-agent ibr utinib  across two clinical studies:  PCYC -[ZIP_CODE] in patient s with 
recurrent B-cell lymphoma (including 16 CLL/SLL patients) and a Phase 1b/2 study 
(PCYC-1102- CA) in patients with CLL/SLL (n=117).  Two Phase 1b/2 studies are ongoing to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of ibrutinib  in combination with chemoimmunotherapy or CD20 
monoclonal antibody therapy in relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL patient s, specifically with 
bendamustine/rituximab (BR) and fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) in Study PCYC-1108-CA, and with ofatumumab in Study PCYC-1109- CA. 
Additional clinical studies of ibrutinib in other B- cell malignancies, specifically mantle cell 
lymphoma ( MCL ), diffused large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL and multiple myeloma) have been 
opened and are enrolling patients.

Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 24 of 114 [IP_ADDRESS]. Summary of Efficacy of Ibrutinib in CLL/SLL  
In the Study PCYC-[ZIP_CODE], 14/16 (87.5%) patient s with CLL or SLL treated  with ibrutinib met 
the protocol definition of evaluable for assessment of response.  Twelve (12) of the 14 (86%) 
evaluable patients with CLL or SLL achieved a response by [CONTACT_720066] (I WCLL , Hallek 2008 ) criteria  (hereafter referred to as IWCLL 2008 
criteria)  or National Cancer Institute (NCI ) Working Group Criteria ( for SLL).  In patient s with 
CLL (n = 11), the time to response was dependent on the time to resolution (< 50% of baseline 
circulating l ymphocyte counts) of a treatment- related lymphocytosis that frequently occurs with  
the initiation of ibrutinib  therapy.  All responding patient s with SLL (n = 5) met the standard 
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)  response criteria by [CONTACT_720067] 2 response assessment.  
As of 25 October 2011, the PCYC-1102-CA study had enrolled 61 relapsed or refractory 
CLL/SLL patients who  had previously received purine analog  based therapy.  These patients 
were given single-agent ibrutinib , which showed high activity as mani fested by a high overall 
response rate (ORR) and an estimated 12 -month progression- free survival ( PFS) rate of 86%.  
Responses per IWCLL  2008 criteria improved with continued treatment ; the ORR was 67% in 
patient s treated with ibrutinib  420 mg/day at 12.6 months median follow- up.  Responses were 
independent of high risk factors including disease resistant to purine analog based therapy, 
17p del, age > 70 years, and/or pretreatment cytopenias.  The activity of ibrutinib was durable 
with an  estimated 12 -month PFS rate  of 88% ( Figure 1) in the 420 mg cohort.  There were no  
differences in clinical activity (ORR or PFS) noted between the two dose levels (420 mg  and 
840 mg) ( O’Brien 2011).

Pharmacodynamic effect leading to characteristic pattern of response:   Preclinical studies 
have revealed a vital and multifaceted role for BTK and the BCR signaling pathway in B- cell 
leukemogenesis and lymphomagenesis.  These data suggest that the blockade of the BCR 
signaling pathway by [CONTACT_720068] r effects: 1) direct induction of 
apoptosis and 2) inhibition of cell homing and migration to chemokines and with subsequent adhesion to cellular substrates, and 3) inhibition of proliferation ( Herman 2011; Ponander 2012).  
Owing to the described mechanism of action of BTK inhibition, administration of ibrutinib  to 
patients with lymphoproliferative diseases has been associated with mobilization of tumor cells 
from tissue to peripheral blood ( Chang 2011b; Burger 2010; Pollyea 2009 ). 
This effect begins in some cases within hours of the first administration and typi[INVESTIGATOR_720030] 3 months of treatment.  Coincident with the ibrutinib  
treatment- related lymphocytosis is a rapid and substantial decrease in lymph node and/or spleen 
size often observed with or without an improvement in hematologic parameters and/or 
symptomatic improvement of disease- related symptoms.  This effect was  noted in CLL/SLL 
patients treated on both PCYC-[ZIP_CODE] and PCYC-1102- CA ( Figure 2).

Lymphadenopathy in Patients with CLL/SLL, Study PCYC -1102- CA 
 
ALC:  Absolute lymphocyte count; SPD: Sum of products of lymph node dimension  
 
This phenomenon is a pharmacodynamic effect of ibrutinib , in which the inhibition of 
BTK- mediated cellular homing and adhesion results in a mobilization of CLL cells from the 
lymph node to the peripheral blood compartment.  This pattern of response had previously been 
noted with other agents known to inhibit BCR signaling ( Friedberg  2008; Furman 2010).  This 
treatment- related lymphocytosis resolves over a variab le period of time (median 6 months) with 
the majority of patients meeting IWCLL 2008 criteria for response with continued ibrutinib  
treatment (O’Brien 2011 ).  As such, an increase in the number of circulating lymphocytes in the 
peripheral blood in the absence of symptoms or other indicators of progressive disease has not been considered an indicator of progressive disease by [CONTACT_720069] .  This is consistent with the recommendation of current National Comprehensive 
Cancer Network (NCCN)  NHL 2012 guideline ( Cheson 2012, Hallek 2012).

anticoagulants or medications that inhibit platelet function may increase the risk of bleeding.   
Subjects with congenital bleeding diathesis have not been studied.  See Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for 
guidance on concomitant use of anticoagulants, antiplatelet therapy and/or supplements.  See 
Section 6.6.3 for guidance on ibrutinib management with surgeries or procedures. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Leukostasis 
There were isolated cases of leukostasis reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib.  A high 
number of circulating lymphocytes (> 400,000/µL) may confer increased risk.  For subject and 
ibrutinib management guidance, refer to Section 6.2.5.

Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 28 of 114 [IP_ADDRESS]. Atrial Fibrillation  
Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have been reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib, 
particularly in subjects with cardiac risk factors, hypertension, acute infections, and a previous 
history of atrial fibrillation.  Subjects who develop arrhythmic symptoms (eg, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], 
lightheadedness) or new onset of dyspnea should be evaluated clinically, and if indicated, have 
an ECG performed.  For atrial fibrillation which persists, consider the risks and benefits of ibrutinib treatment and follow the protocol dose modification guidelines (see Section  6.2.4).    
[IP_ADDRESS]. Cytopenias 
Treatment -emergent Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia) were 
reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib.  Subjects should be monitored for fever, weakness, or 
easy bruising and/or bleeding. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)  
Cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD) have been reported in patients treated with ibrutinib.  
Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD.  Should symptoms develop follow 
the protocol dose modification guidelines (see Section  6.2.4 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
There have been reports of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) events in subjec ts treated with 
single-agent ibrutinib or in combination with chemotherapy.  Subjects at risk of TLS are those 
with comorbidities and /or risk factors such as high tumor burden prior to treatment, increased 
uric acid (hyperuricemia), elevated lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ), bulky disease at baseline, and 
pre‐existing kidney abnormalities . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Lymphocytosis 
Upon initiation of treatment, a reversible increase in lymphocyte counts (ie, ≥ 50% increase from 
baseline and an absolute count > 5000/µL), often associated with reduction of lymphadenopathy, 
has been observed in most subjects with CLL/SLL treated with ibrutinib.  This effect has also 
been observed in some subjects with MCL treated with ibrutinib.  This observed lymphocytosis 
(increase in the number of circula ting lymphocytes eg, > 400,000/µL) is a pharmacodynamic 
effect and should not be considered progressive disease in the absence of other clinical findings.  In both disease types, lymphocytosis typi[INVESTIGATOR_720032] y and typi[INVESTIGATOR_36065] a median of 8 weeks in subjects with MCL and 14 weeks in 
subjects with CLL/SLL.  Lymphocytosis was not observed in subjects with Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia treated with ibrutinib.  For subject and ibrutinib management guidance, refer 
to Section  6.2.5.

Diarrhea is the most frequently reported non-hematologic AE with ibrutinib monotherapy and 
combination therapy.  Other fr equently reported gastrointestinal events include nausea, vomiting, 
and constipation.  These events are rarely severe.  Should symptoms be severe or prolonged, follow the protocol dose modification guidelines (see Section  6.2.4).   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Infections  
Infections (including sepsis, bacterial, viral, or fungal infections) were observed in subjects treated with ibrutinib therapy.  Some of these reported infections have been asso ciated with 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9017].  Although causality has not been established, cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have occurred in subjects treated with ibrutinib.  
Subjects should be monitored for symptoms (fever, chills, weakness, confusion) and appropriate 
therapy should be instituted as indicated.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Rash  
Rashes have been commonly reported in subjects treated with either single agent ibrutinib or in combination with other chemotherapy.  In a randomized Phase 3 study (PCYC-1112- CA), rash 
occurred at a higher rate in the ibrutinib arm than in the control arm.  Most rashes were mild to moderate in severity.  Isolated cases of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) have been reported in s ubjects treated with ibrutinib.  Subject s 
should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms suggestive of SCAR including SJS.  Subjects receiving ibrutinib should be observed closely for rashes and treated symptomatically, 
including interruption of the suspected agent as appropriate.  In addition, hypersensitivity- related 
events including erythema, urticaria, and angioedema have been reported. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Non-melanoma Skin Cancer 
Non-melanoma skin cancers have occurred in patients treated with ibrutinib.  Monitor pati ents 
for the appearance of non- melanoma skin cancer.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hypertension  
Hypertension has been commonly reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib.  Monitor subjects 
for new onset of hypertension or hypertension that is not adequately controlled after starting 
ibrutinib.  Adjust existing anti- hypertensive medications and/or initiate anti -hypertensive 
treatment as appropriate.  
2. STUDY RATIONALE  
This randomized, multicenter, open- label , Phase [ADDRESS_982547]: IBRUTINIB (PCI -[ZIP_CODE])  Protocol PCYC -1112- CA 28 September 2016  
IND # 102,688   Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_982548] one prior line of therapy and are not considered appropriate for treatment 
with purine analog based therapy. 
The study design aims to confirm the efficacy findings of the ongoing Phase 1b/2 Study 
PCYC-1102- CA for treatment with ibrutinib  administered orally once dai ly in the cohorts of 
patient s with CLL/SLL who had failed previous treatment(s) .  This study will assess the efficacy 
outcomes between the two arms in relapsed/refractory  patients, including those with a 17p del or 
who are refractory to purine analog based therapy.  In addition, this  study aims to confirm the 
safety and tolerability of ibrutinib  in these patient s as compared to an acceptable comparator, 
ofatumumab , in terms of hematologic and infectious toxicities. 
2.1. Dose Selection Rationale for Ibrutinib 
A once daily 420 mg dose of ibrutinib  has been selected for this Phase 3 study.  This dose and 
regimen were selected in consideration of PK, pharmacodynamics , efficacy, and safety data 
obtained from Studies PCYC-[ZIP_CODE] and PCYC-1102- CA as detailed in Section  1.3.  Ibrutinib  
has been administered safely at higher doses in CLL;  however [ADDRESS_982549], with no evidence of improved 
responses or improvement in PFS at doses above 420 mg/day (s ee Figure 1 ). 
2.2. Selection of Ofatumumab as Comparator 
Ofatumumab is a fully humanized type I anti -CD20 monoclonal antibody.  In vitro , it mediates 
complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) against rituximab- resistant Raji cells a nd CLL cells 
with low expression of CD20.  It appears to have greater potency in CDC than rituximab, as well 
as a slower off -rate and more stable CD20 binding ( Teeling 2004).  Additionally, it appears to 
bind a different epi[INVESTIGATOR_265166]20 than rituximab ( Teeling 2006) and has demonstrated clinical 
activity that is independent of prior treatment with rituximab (Wierda 2011).  A Phase 1/2 study of ofatumumab in re lapsed/refractory CLL patients demonstrated that it is generally 
well-tolerated, even at high doses, and is active, with an ORR of approximately 50%.  
Infusion- related AEs are similar to those reported with rituximab and decrease following the first 
infusion ( Coiffier 2008) of ofatumumab .  Ofatumumab was evaluated in patients with 
fludarabine- and alemtuzumab -refractory (double refractory [D R]) and bulky fludarabine- 
refractory (BFR) CLL in a seminal study of [ADDRESS_982550] received treatment for 
CLL/SLL.  Patients received [ADDRESS_982551] dose and 2000 mg for all doses thereafter 
(Wierda 2010).  The ORR was 58% in the DR CLL group and 47% in the BFR CLL group with 
median PFS of 5.7 months and 5.9 months, and overall survival (OS) of 13.7 months and 15.4 months, for the two groups respectively.  This data led to FDA  (Food and Drug Administration) 
and EMA (European Medicines Agency) approval of ofatu mumab in CLL in patient s refractory 
to fludarabine and alemtuzumab.  Currently NCCN NHL [ADDRESS_982552]: IBRUTINIB (PCI -[ZIP_CODE])  Protocol PCYC -1112- CA 28 September 2016  
IND # 102,688   Version: Amendment 7 
Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 31 of 114 for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines support the use of ofatumumab in patients  who have 
received treatment for CLL/SLL ( NCCN 2012 ; Eichhorst 2011).  The most common A Es for 
ofatumumab  are infusion reactions, neutropenia, pneumonia, fevers, cough, and diarrhea.  For 
more information on ofatumumab, ple ase refer to the package insert . 
3. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
3.1. Primary Objective  
To evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib compared to ofatumumab based on independent review 
committee (IRC) assessment of progression-free survival (PFS) per International Workshop on 
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Criteria (IWCLL, Hallek 2008) with incorporation of the 
clarificatio n for treatment related lymphocytosis ( Hallek 2012 ), hereafter referred to as IWCLL 
2008 criteria in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL.  
3.2. Secondary Objectives  
To compare between the two treatment groups in terms of: 
Efficacy  
• To evaluate overall survival (OS)  
• To evaluate IRC -assessed overall response rate (ORR) per IWCLL 2008 criteria  
• To evaluate patient -reported outcome (PRO) by [CONTACT_720070] -Fatigue (FACiT -Fatigue)  
• To evaluate hematological improvement 
Safety  
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ibrutinib  compared to ofatumumab 
3.3. Exploratory Objectives 
To evaluate and compare between the two treatment arms in terms of: 
• To evaluate Investigator -assessed PFS  and ORR per IWCLL 2008 criteria 
• To evaluate improvement and/or resolution of disease- related symptoms  
• To evaluate PRO by [CONTACT_720071] e 30 ( EORTC QLQ- C30) and EuroQoL 
Five-Dimension ( EQ-5D-5L) 
• To evaluate medical resource utilization (MRU)  
• To determine the PK characteristics of ibrutinib  in patients with CLL/SLL and to 
determine which, if any, covariates (eg, age, gender, body size, race) influence exposure 
to ibrutinib

4. STUDY DESIGN  
This is a randomized, multicenter, open -label, Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of ibrutinib as compared to ofatumumab in patients with relapsed or refractory 
CLL /SLL who have failed at least one prior line of therapy and are not considered appropriate 
candidates for treatment or retreatment with purine analog based therapy. 
Eligible patients will have been diagnosed with CLL/SLL and have relapsed or refractory disease 
following at least 1 line of prior systemic therapy  for CLL/SLL. 
A minimum of 350 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either ofatumumab 
(Treatment Arm A) or ibrutinib (Treatment Arm B).  
The site will enter  eligibility  data into an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS)  prior to 
randomization. 
Randomization will be used to minimize bias in the assignment of patients to treatment groups, 
to increase the likelihood that known and unknown patient attributes (eg, demographic and 
baseline characteristics) are evenly balanced, and to enhance the validity of statistical 
comparisons across treatment groups.   Two randomization schemes will be generated: one for 
each geographic region (North America versus Rest of World).  Under each scheme, patients will 
be randomized based on the following two  stratification factors : 
• Presence versus absence of disease refractory to purine analog  and anti-CD20 containing 
chemoimmunotherapy regimen  
• Presence versus absence of 17p del, as defined by [CONTACT_720072] (FISH) or cytogenetics evaluation 
Patient  participation will include a Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase, and a Follow -up Phase. 
The Screening Phase will be up to [ADDRESS_982553] dose of study drug, during which the 
patient’s eligibility and baseline char acteristics will be determined.  
The Treatment Phase will extend from randomization until study drug discontinuation.  Patients 
randomized to ofatumumab will receive treatment for up to 6 months per the package insert .  
Patients randomized to ibrutinib will  receive study drug daily until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity.  Further information on dosing is provided in Section  6.  Regularly 
scheduled disease assessments are required throughout the Treatment Phase.  
The Follow-up P hase will be comprised of 2 phases; the Post -treatment Phase and a Post -disease 
Progressi on Phase.  The Post -treatment Phase will extend from the discontinuation of treatment 
up until the patient  has progressive disease or other criteria listed in Section 10.1.  R esponse

IND # 102,688   Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_982554] .  It is important that survival status be assessed and that 
the date of death is documented for each patient randomized to treatment , regardless of whether 
or not the patient received treatment. 
Assessment of response and progression will be conducted in accordance with the IWCLL 2008 
criteria with the modification that treatment-related lymphocytosis in the absence of other signs 
or symptoms of disease progression will not be considered progressive disease ( Section 8.1.5).  
The Investigator will evaluate sites of disease by [CONTACT_38226] (primary), physical 
exam ination  or other procedures as necessary , review of hematology and serum chemistry 
results, and disease -related symptoms .  The same method s of assessment used to assess disease 
at baseline should be used throughout the study.  A central laboratory will perform all 
hematology and serum chemistry  testing  for the primary endpoint analysis.  The primary efficacy 
analysis will be based on assessment from an IRC.  As part of the IRC review, radiographic 
evaluations assessed by [CONTACT_720073] a central 
laboratory will be provided .  Detailed procedures will be described in a separate charter.  
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be formed and constituted according to 
regulatory agency guidelines.  Detailed information regarding the composition of the DMC and 
detailed DMC procedures will be provided in a separate charter.  The DMC will review the 
safety data periodically and the interim analysis results and provide recommendations according 
to the ch arter.  
One interim analysis using Lan -DeMets alpha spending function based on O'Brien-Fleming 
boundary for both superiority  and futility (non-binding) is planned for the study.  The interim 
analysis will be conducted after approximately 117 PFS events (progressive disease confirmed 
by [CONTACT_720074], whichever occurs first) have occurred.  The DMC will make 
recommendations based on efficacy boundary guidelines.  If pre-specified boundaries are not 
met at the interim analysis, the final analysis of the stu dy will occur after [ADDRESS_982555]: IBRUTINIB (PCI -[ZIP_CODE])  Protocol PCYC -1112- CA 28 September 2016

6.1.1. Dosage and Administration 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Premedication  
Patients should be premedicated 30 minutes to 2 hours prior to each dose of ofatumumab  with 
975-1000 mg acetaminophen/paracetamol ; 10 mg Cetirizine orally or equivalent antihistamine, 
either IV or oral; and 100 mg IV prednisolone or equivalent corticosteroid . 
Corticosteroid dose reduction:  
• Do not reduce corticosteroid dose for ofatumumab infusions 1, 2, or 9. 
• Corticosteroid doses may be reduced as follows:  
 For Doses 3 through 8: 
• If infusion- related reaction ≥ Grade 3 experienced, do not reduce corticosteroid dose for 
subsequent doses.  
• If infusion-related reaction < Grade 3 experienced, may consider gradually reducing 
corticosteroid dose with subsequent doses.  
 For Doses 10 through 12: 
• If infusion- related reaction ≥ Grade 3 experienced with Dose 9, do not reduce 
corticosteroid dose for subsequent doses. 
• If infusion- related reaction < Grade 3 experienced with Dose 9, may consider 
administer ing prednisolone 50 – 100 mg (or its equivalent) for subsequent doses. 
Ofatumumab infusion premedication should be administered as outlined above and consistent 
with the package insert.  It is recognize d that some institutional variation to these procedure s 
may exist , however for the purposes of this study; the package insert instructions must be 
followed.  Routine infusion premedication with corticosteroid doses of > 100 mg IV

6.2.1. Dosage and Administration 
Ibrutinib 420 mg (3 x 140- mg capsules) is to be admini stered orally once daily with 8 ounces 
(approximately 240 mL) of water.  The capsules should be swallowed intact and patients should 
not attempt to open capsules or dissolve them in water.  
Each dose of ibrutinib should be taken at approximately the same time each day.  Patients should avoid consuming food and beverages containing grapefruit juice or Seville oranges for the 
duration of the study due to CYP 3A4/5 inhibition.   If a dose is missed, it can be taken as soon as 
possible on the same day  with  a return to  the normal schedule the following day.   
Ibrutinib will be dispensed to patients in bottles.  Unused ibrutinib dispensed during previous 
visits mus t be returned to the site and drug accountability records ( Section 13.8) updated at each 
visit.  Returned capsules must not be redispensed to anyone.   Ibrutinib should not be dispensed to 
anyone other than a patient enrolled in the study and can only be dispensed in its original bottle. 
6.2.2. Dose Delay  
Treatment with ibrutinib should be held for any unmanageable, potentially study drug- related 
toxicity th at is Grade 3 or higher in severity.  Please see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for guidelines for 
management of ibrutinib in patients who requi re anticoagulant treatment . 
Any other clinically important events where dose delays may be considered appropriate by [CONTACT_720077] M edical Monitor.

6.2.5. Treatment -related Lymphocytosis 
Treatment -related lymphocytosis, for the purposes of this protocol, is defined as an elevation in 
blood lymphocyte count of ≥50% compared to baseline that occurs in the setting of improvement 
in at least one other disease- related parameter and is associated wi th agents known to inhibit 
BCR (see Section 8.1.5 for additional details)  (Hallek 2012, NCCN 2012 , Cheson 2012) .  Given 
the known mechanism of action of BCR-inhibiting agents including ibrutinib, treatment- related 
lymphocytosis is an expected and frequent pharmacodynamic phenomenon observed with initiation (or re -initiation) of ibrutinib.  Ibrutinib associated treatment-related lymphocytosis 
generally occurs within the first weeks of therapy, peaks within the first few months, and resolves slowly.  Asymptomatic treatment- related l ymphocytosis should not be considered an AE 
and patients should remain on study treatment.

Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 43 of 114 Specifically, u pon initiation of treatment, a transient phase of increase in lymphocyte counts 
(ie, ≥50% increase from baseline and above absolute count of 5,000/µL) , often associated with 
reduction of lymphadenopathy, has been observed in most patien ts (75%) with relapsed/ 
refractory CLL/SLL and some patients (33%) with relapsed/refractory MCL treated with 
ibrutinib monotherapy.  This observed transient lymphocytosis is usually not associated with an 
adverse event and should not be considered progressive disease in the absence of other clinical 
findings. In both disease types, lymphocytosis typi[INVESTIGATOR_720033] (median time 1.1 weeks) and resolves within a median of 7.[ADDRESS_982579] been isolated cases of leukostasis reported in patients treated with ibrutinib.  
A high number of circulating malignant cells (≥400,000/ µL) may c onfer increased risk; these 
patients should be closely monitored.  Administer supportive care such as hydration and/or 
leukophoresis as indicated.  Ibrutinib may be temporarily held, and M edical Monitor should be 
contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. 
6.2.6. Dose Modification for Hepatic Impaired Subjects  
Ibrutinib is metabolized in the liver and therefore subjects with clinically significant hepatic 
impairment at the time of screening (Child - Pugh class B or C) are excluded from study 
participation.  For subjects who develop mild liver impairment while on study (Child- Pugh class 
A), the recommended dose reduction for ibrutinib/placebo is to a level of 280 mg daily (two 
capsules).  For subjects who develop moderate liver impairment while on study (Child-Pugh 
class B), the recommended dose reduction is to a level of 140 mg daily (one capsule).  Subjects 
who develop severe hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh class C) must hold study drug until 
resolved to moderate impairment (Child -Pugh class B) or better.  Monitor subjects for signs of 
toxicity and follow dose modification guidance as needed ( Refer to  Appendix L ). 
6.2.7. Precautions  and Adverse Events  
The most common treatment -emergent adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, cough and 
anemia. Additional common AEs such as peripheral edema, pyrexia, vomiting, constipation, 
upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], arthralgia, dyspnea, thrombocytopenia, decreased appetite, 
headache, muscle spasm, neutropenia, contusion, abdominal pain, dizziness, pneumonia,

[IP_ADDRESS]. Guideline for Use of CYP Inhibiting/Inducing  Drugs  
Ibrutinib is metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A 4. Avoid co- administration with strong or moderate 
CYP3A inhibitors and consider alternative agents with less CYP3A inhibition. Co- administration 
of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, in [ADDRESS_982581], of ibrutinib by 29- and 24-fold, respectively.  The maximal 
observed ibrutinib exposure ( AUC) was ≤2 -fold in 37 patients treated with mild and/or moderate 
CYP3A inhibitors when compared with the ibrutinib exposure in 76 patients not treated 
concomitantly with CYP3A inhibitors.  Clinical safety data in 66 patients treated with moderate 
(n=47) or strong CYP3A inhibitors (n=19) did not reveal meaningful increases in toxicities. 
Strong inhibitors of CYP3A (eg, ketoconazole, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
clarithromycin, telithromycin, itraconazole, and nefazadone) should be avoided. If a strong CYP3A inhibitor must be used, consider reducing the ibrutinib to [ADDRESS_982582]: IBRUTINIB (PCI -[ZIP_CODE])  Protocol PCYC -1112- CA 28 September 2016  
IND # 102,688   Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_982583] for toxicity and follow dose modification 
guidance as needed.  For subjects who are already on a moderate CYP3A inhibitor 
concomitantly with ibrutinib without significant toxicity the investigator may consider the 
overall risk -benefit to determine if a dose reduction of ibrutinib is appropriate.   Avoid grapefruit 
and Seville oranges during ibrutinib treatment, as these contain moderate inhibitors of CYP3A (see Section 6.2.1).   No dose adjustment is required in combination with weak CYP3A 
inhibitors. 
Co-administration of ibrutinib with strong CYP3A inducer, rifampin, in healthy subjects 
decrease ibrutinib plasma concentration by [CONTACT_3450]  10-fold.  Avoid concomitant use of 
strong CYP3A inducers (eg, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, phenytoin, and St. John’s Wort).  
Consider alternative agents with less CYP3A induction. 
A list of common CYP3A inhibitors and inducers is provided in Appendix C ; a comprehensive 
list of inhibitors, inducers, and substrates may be found at 
http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main -table/ .  This website is continually revised and 
should be checked frequently for updates. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Drugs That May Have Their Plasma Concentrations Altered by [CONTACT_231258] a substrate of P -glycoprotein (P -gp), but is a mild 
inhibitor (with an IC
50 of 2.15 μg/mL).  Ibrutinib is not expected to have systemic drug-drug 
interactions with P -gp substrates.   However, it cannot be excluded that ibrutinib could inhibit 
intestinal P -gp after a therapeutic d ose.  Currently, no clinical data is available; therefore, co -
administration of narrow therapeutic index P-gp substrates (eg, digoxin) with ibrutinib may 
increase the substrate’s blood concentration and should be used with caution and subjects should 
be mo nitored closely for toxicity.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Concomitant Use of QT Prolonging Agents 
Any m edications known to cause QT prolongation should be used with caution; periodic 
monitoring with electrocardiograms and electrolytes should be considered. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Concomitant Use of Antiplatelet Agents and Anticoagulants  
Warfarin or vitamin K antagonists should not be administered concomitantly with ibrutinib.  
Ibrutinib should be used with caution in patients requiring other anticoagulants or medications 
that inhibit platelet function.  Supplements such as fish oil and vitamin E preparations should be 
avoided.  Subjects with congenital bleeding diathesis have not been studied.  For guidance on ibrutinib and the use of anticoagulants during procedures/surgeries see Section 6.6.3.  
Patients requiring the initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation therapy (eg, atrial fibrillation), consider the risks and benefits of continuing ibrutinib treatment.  If therapeutic anticoagulation is 
clinically indicated, treatment with ibrutinib should be held and not be restarted until the patient

and symptoms of bleeding.  No dose reduction is required when study drug is restarted. 
6.6.2. Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Any chemotherapy, anticancer immunotherapy, corticosteroids (at dosages equivalent to 
prednisone >20 mg/day), experimental therapy, or radiotherapy are prohibited.  Localized , 
hormonal, or bone sparing treatment for non- B cell malignancies may be considered with 
approval of the medical monitor.  Steroids used to premedicate or manage ofatumumab infusion-
related reactions or contrast allergies  are permitted .  In addition, short courses (<14 days) of 
treatment for non -cancer related medical reasons (treatment for autoimmune cytopenias are 
permitted) at doses not to exceed 100 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent are permitted .  Routine 
infusion premedication with corticosteroid dose s of > 100 mg IV prednisolone (or equivalent) is  
not permitted.   Red blood cell growth factors (eg, erythropoietin) , platelet grow th factors (eg, 
thrombopoietin) and sargramostim are also prohibited  for the first six months of study treatment.  
However, ini tiation of red blood cell growth factors (eg, erythropoietin), platelet growth factors 
(eg, thrombopoietin) and/or sargram ostim can be considered after 6  months on study based on 
the indication outlined in the respective package inserts. 
6.6.3. Guidelines for Ibrutinib Management with Surgeries or Procedures  
Ibrutinib may increase risk of bleeding with invasive procedures or surgery.  The following 
guidance should be applied during the perioperative period for subjects who require surgical 
intervention or an invasive procedure while receiving ibrutinib:   
• For any surgery or invasive procedure requiring sutures or staples for closure, ibrutinib 
should be held at least [ADDRESS_982584] 7 days 
after the procedure and restarted at the discretion of the investigator when the surgical site is reasonably healed without serosanguineous drainage o r the need for drainage

The FACi T-Fatigue questionnaire is an instrument for use as a measure of fatigue-related quality 
of life in patients with cancer and other chronic diseases ( http://www.facit.org ).  The 13- item 
FACiT -Fatigue Scale measures each item on a 5‐point Likert scale.  The FACiT -Fatigue Scale 
has been validated in the general population ( Cella 2002) as well as in patients with cancer or 
rheumatoid arthritis.  
7.1.14. Pregnancy Test  
Pregnancy tests (urine or serum) are required at Screening only for women of childbearing 
potential.  If positive, pregnancy must be ruled out by [CONTACT_375842].  This test may be 
performed more frequently if required by [CONTACT_31665].

suspected, a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_720041]- related cytopenias.  
7.1.23. Cytogenetic CLL FISH Panel  
Cytoge netic profiles will use the stan dard CLL FISH probes to detect abnormalities in 
chromosomes 13q, 12, 11q, and 17p.  Within 90 days prior to randomization, a peripheral blood 
sample or bone marrow sample (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_5179]) must be tested for FISH analysis for 
stratification purpose .  For pat ients without lymphocytos is FISH should be performed on the 
bone marrow sample.  A previous FISH and/or cytogenetic result demonstrating the presence of 17p del as per the assay specification  will be considered adequate for stratification provided 
appropriate documentation is avai lable .  Results must be documented in the patient chart prior to 
randomization for the purposes of stratification.  At Screening, peripheral blood will be collected 
for confirmation of FISH result.  Screening peripheral blood (required) and marrow samples 
(where available) will be sent to a central vendor to be tested for 17p del, 13q-, +12, 11q-, to assist with the validation of the Abbott probe kit for use as prognostic marker . 
7.1.24. Determination of T/B/NK Counts

be performed at the central lab on the same blood sample collected for standard hematology. 
7.1.25. Flow Cytometry -based Immunophenotype Assays 
To determine the temporal effect of study drugs on the phenotype of malignant cells in patients, 
blood samples will be collected  and analyzed centrally .  Samples taken in the first [ADDRESS_982596] of lymphocytosis.  Samples will also be 
collected at a suspected CR and at disease progression or discontinuation of treatment.  From 
these samples , peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be separated, collected and 
frozen as viable cells.  The cell pellets will be  analyzed at a future date by [CONTACT_4133], for 
expression of cell surface markers including  CD3, CD19, CD45, CD5, Igλ/κ+, CXCR4 and 
CD38 .  These samples will also be stained intracellularly for Ki67, pBtk, pSyk, pPLC γ, pErk and 
pAkt to monitor changes taking place within the tumor cells . 
7.1.26. Genetic and Molecular Prognostic Markers  
A blood sample will be collected and analyzed centrally to study the pretreatment prognostic 
factors.  These prognostic factors have previously been associa ted with disease outcome in CLL 
patients.

Treatment Resistance  
Additional blood samples will be collected and assessed or maintained centrally to evaluate 
potential biomarkers related to response to therapy and/or to investigate potential mechanisms of 
treatment resistance.  These samples may be later characterized by [CONTACT_720084], mutational analysis by [CONTACT_36086], secreted protein analysis, and 
intracellular signaling pathway analysis.   Inhibition of BTK and other related kinases may also 
be explored in these cells.  It is expected that these efforts may identify genes and pathways associated with primary or later development of resistance to ibrutinib by [CONTACT_720085] e biomarkers that could assist  with future 
development of this compound.

Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 55 of 114 7.1.28. Computed Tomography (CT) Scans  
Radiological imaging by [CONTACT_720086], abdomen, 
chest, and neck.  Patients who are intolerant to IV CT contrast agents will have CT scans 
performed with oral contrast.  When possible, all patients should have radiographic tumor 
measurements performed at the participating study center or an acceptable alternate imaging 
facility using an identical imaging protocol and similar equipment.  The sa me imaging 
equipment should be utilized for all scans whenever possible.  The same radiologist should be assigned to read all the scans for a given patient throughout the study as much as possible. 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to evaluate n ontarget lesions that cannot be 
adequately imaged using CT (in cases where MRI is desirable, the MRI must be obtained at 
baseline and at all subsequent response evaluations).  If MRI is required for any other reason, 
this must be discussed with the study M edical Monitor first.  
CT scans will be performed until disease progression regardless of whether or not the patient remains on treatment.  In the event disease progression is suspected due to physical examination 
or laboratory test, a CT scan must be performed to confirm disease progression.  
There must be radiographically measurable disease at Screening (at least one lymph node > 1.[ADDRESS_982598] diameter) as outlined in Section 8.1.4.  If the sole lesion lies within the 
field of prior radiotherapy, there must be evidence of disease progression in that lesion. 
Up to 6 measurable lymph nodes (target lesions > 1.[ADDRESS_982599] diameter ), clearly 
measurable in 2 perpendicular dimensions, will be followed as target lesions for each patient.  
Measurable sites of disease should be chosen such that they are representative of the patient’s 
disease.  In addition, selection of target lesions should be from as disparate regions of the body 
as possible when these areas are significantly involved.  If additional lesions are present but are 
not included in the target lesion assessment, they can be added as non- target lesions followed  
throughout the study.  
The cranial -caudal measurement of the spleen and longest diameter of the liver will be assessed 
at Screening and all subsequent response evaluations.  
A central imaging service will be utilized to provide independent radiological asse ssments for 
the purposes of the primary endpoint.  These measurements will not be reported back to the site. 
7.1.29. Medical Resources U tilization  (MRU)

progression is confirmed.  The Investigator should report any suspected disease progression to 
the Sponsor or designee via the electronic data capturing (ED C) system within 24 hours of 
discovery.  Patients should continue to be followed and adhere to study- related  procedures until 
progression has been confirmed regardless of the administration of subsequent anticancer therapy.  New anticancer therapy may be withheld if clinically appropriate in the absence of 
confirmed progressive disease.  In addition, lab assessments for disease progression will need to 
be confirmed by [CONTACT_6626].  
7.1.31. Overall Response Evaluations 
Overall response assessments will includ e evaluation of physical exams, recording of symptoms, 
hematological evaluations, and radiographic evaluations per the schedule of assessments (see 
Appendix A  and Appendix M ).  Patients who have signs and symptoms of progression outside of 
the scheduled assessment, should be evaluated by [CONTACT_294856] a physical exam and a 
CBC with differential to determine if disease progression is present.  Patients may continue study 
treatment until progression is confirmed by a serial exam at least [ADDRESS_982600] :

7.2. Drug Concentration Measurements 
7.2.1. Sample Collection and Analysis  
Sparse PK samples will be collected from  at least 100  patients  on the ibrutinib arm .  Refer to the 
laboratory binder for instructions on collecting and processing these samples. 
Plasma samples will be analyzed by a validated and specific LC -MS/MS method for the 
determinatio n of ibrutinib  and PCI-[ZIP_CODE], a metabolite of ibrutinib,  in human plasma. 
Exploratory analyses may be performed for other potential metabolites of ibrutinib in plasma. 
7.2.2. Pharmacokinetic Assessment  
Plasma concentrations, dosing history, demographic data, and other covariates will be assembled 
into a dataset suitable for a population PK analysis.  The analysi s will be performed using 
mixed -effects methods.  
Based on previous PK studies for ibrutinib, it is likely that the structural model will include two 
systemic compartments and first -order absorption and will be linear with respect to dose and 
stationary with respect to time.  Parameters of the PK model will be apparent clearance, apparent 
distribution clearance, apparent distribution volumes (central and peri pheral), absorption rate, 
and absorption lag.  Absorption, distribution, and elimination half- lives and steady -state AUC 
will be calculated from these parameters.  
If the assumptions of linearity and stationarity are flawed, other m odels will be evaluated.  After 
determination of the structural model, covariates will be evaluated for inclusion into the model 
using forward addition.  The final model will be evaluated using one or more of the following 
methods: visual predictive check, likelihood profiles, or bootstrap analysis. 
Similar analyses will be performed for PCI-[ZIP_CODE].

IND # 102,688   Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_982612] been stable, then these lesions are not considered me asurable.  
If tumor lesions in previously irradiated areas progress during the study, then disease progression 
will be considered as having occurred provided progression is confirmed by [CONTACT_55543]. 
All other sites of disease will be considered assessable.  Assessable disease includes objective 
evidence of disease that is identified by [CONTACT_38226], physical examination, or other 
procedures, as necessary , including peripheral blood counts. 
8.1.5. Treatment -related Lymphocytosis 
Treatment -related lymphocytosis, for the purposes of this protocol, is defined as an elevation in 
blood lymphocyte count of ≥50% compared to baseline and ≥5000/µL that occurs in the setting 
of unequivocal improvement in at least one other disease-related parameter including lymph 
node size, spleen size, hematologic parameters (Hgb or platelet count), or disease- related 
symptoms.  Given the known mechanism of action of BCR-inhibiting agents including ibrutinib, treatment- related lymphocytosis is an expected and frequent pharmacodynamic phenome non 
observed with initiation (or re -initiation) of ibrutinib.  
Response assessment in CLL patients treated with novel agents has b een clarified by [CONTACT_521144] [ADDRESS_982613] progressive disease or treatment failure ( Cheson 2012).  
8.1.6. Richter’s  Transformation 
Richter's syndrome (RS) is lymphomatous transformation to a more aggressive histology in a 
patient with CLL or SLL.  RS is most often characterized by [CONTACT_521145]-grade 
NHL or Hodgkin’s disease.  Symptoms of Richter ’s transformation  can include new or 
progressive lymphadenopathy or organomegaly, fever, loss of weight and muscle mass, and other health problems.  Richter 's transformation can be suggested by a CT/PET scan, but should 
be confirmed with a biopsy (eg, lymph node) demonstrating the histologic transformation  
whenever possible. 
8.1.7. Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)  
Patients who have achieved a CR should be evaluated for eradic ation of disease cells as 
determined by [CONTACT_720090][INVESTIGATOR_720042].

8.4. Response Categories 
Assessment of response should include physical examination, radiographic imaging, and 
evaluation of blood and marrow per the schedule of assessments (see Appendix A  and  
Appendix M ) and to confirm CR.  Definition of response for CR, CRi, nPR, PR, PR with 
lymphocytosis, and disease progression will b e evaluated by [CONTACT_720091] [ADDRESS_982615] to be considered a confirmed 
response.  
8.4.1. Complete Response (CR)  
All of the following are required for a CR: 
• No significant lymphadenopathy (>1.5cm) palpable on examination or by [CONTACT_4654]

IND # 102,688   Version: Amendment 7 
Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 69 of 114 8.4.2. Complete Response with an Incomplete Marrow Recovery (CRi)  
CRi is defined as a CR with an incomplete recovery of the patient’s bone marrow.  Patients who 
have a CRi fulfill all criteria for a CR, but continue to have persistent anemia, thrombocytopenia, 
or neutropenia.  These cytopenias are due to drug toxicity in the bone marrow and are not due to 
any evidence of CLL.  If the marrow is hypocel lular, a repeat determination should be performed 
after [ADDRESS_982618] recovered.  However, this time interval should not exceed 6 months. 
8.4.3. Nodular Partial Response (nPR)  
nPR is a response where patients meet criteria for a CR, but the bone marrow biopsy shows that 
there are still B -lymphoid nodules, which may represent a clonal infiltrate.  These nodules are 
residual disease and therefore the patient is termed an nPR.  
8.4.4. Partial Response (PR)  
A ≥50% drop in lymphocyte count from baseline or ≤4.0 x 10
9/L is required for a PR and all of 
the following are observed: 
• ≥50% decrease in the sum products of up to 6 lymph nodes, a ≥50% decrease in the 
longest diameter of the single lymph node, or normalization of lymphadenopathy when 
compared to baseline. 
• No new enlarged lymph nodes by [CONTACT_720094].  Note:  In a small lymph node <2  cm, an increase of less than 25% is 
not considered to be significant.  
• When abnormal, a ≥50% decrease in the enlargement of the spleen and/or liver from 
baseline or normalization by [CONTACT_720095] a response in at least one of the following evaluable criteria independent of growth factor 
support or transfusion. 
• Neutrophils >1.5 x109/L, or ≥50% improvement over baseline 
• Platelets >100,000/ μL or ≥50% improvement over baseline 
• Hgb >11 g/dL or ≥50% improvement over baseline 
* Note: If all criteria are normal, defined as neutrophils >1.5 x109/L, platelets 
>100,000/μL, and Hgb >11g/dL at baseline, they mus t remain normal to be considered 
consistent with a PR .

8.4.7. Progressive Disease  
A CT scan is required to evaluate all cases of suspected progressive disease for this protocol 
regardless of the modality of disease progression (eg . lymph node, lymphocytosis, 
or transformation).  Progressive disease requires at  least ONE of following: 
• New enlarged nodes >1.5 cm, new hepatomegaly or splenomegaly; or other organ 
infiltrates  
• ≥50% increase from nadir in existing lymph node (must reach >1.[ADDRESS_982619] diameter) or ≥50% increase from nadir in sum of product of diameters of multiple nodes 
• ≥50% increase from nadir in enlargement of liver or spleen 
• ≥50% increase from baseline in lymphocyte count (and to ≥5 x10
9/L) unless considered 
treatment- related lymphocytosis ( Section 8.1.5 ) 
• New cytopenia (Hgb or platelets) attributable to CLL.  The progression of any cytopenia (unrelated to autoimmune cytopenia , drugs, or bleeding), as documented by a decrease of 
Hgb levels from baseline by [CONTACT_726] 20 g/L (2g/dL) or to less than 100 g/L (10g/dL) and lower than baseline, or by a decrease of platelet counts from baseline by ≥50% or to 
less than 100 × 10
9/L (100,000/μL) and lower than baseline in the presence of active 
CLL, defines disease progression  ; a marrow biopsy must demonstrate an infiltrate of 
clonal CLL cells if no other evidence of disease progression is present on CT scan . 
• Transformation to a more aggressive histology (eg, Richter’s Transformation ).  
Whenever possible, this diagnosis should be established by [CONTACT_9256]. 
Suspected progressive disease must be confirmed by a serial exam at least 2 weeks later.   Please 
see Section 7.1.31 on details regarding suspected PD and IRC confirmation. 
8.5. Sustained Hematological Improvement  
In the subset of patients with cytopenia(s) at baseline (Hgb ≤11g/dL, platelets ≤100,000/μL, or 
ANC ≤1500/μL), time to improvement in blood counts and percentage of patients with sustained 
improvement in blood counts, (sustained improvement, defined as improvement in cytopenia by 
≥50%, or Hgb >11g/dL, ANC >1500 cells/μL, platelets >100,000/μL with the duration of 
improvement lasting for at least 2 months without blood transfusion or growth factors), will be 
recorded . 
8.6. Resolution of Pretreatment Disease- related Symptoms  
Resolution of pretreatment symptoms includ ing fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, fevers, night 
sweats, or symptoms of splenomegaly will be evaluated .

safety evaluation of the study drug(s). 
9.2. Definitions  
9.2.1. Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient  administered a pharmaceutical product 
and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug ( ICH-E2A, 1995). 
For the purposes of this clinical study, AE s include events which are either new or represent 
detectable exacerb ations of pre-existing conditions. 
Disease progression is not an adverse event; rather it may be the cause of an adverse event.  The 
clinical diagnosis that is associated with disease progression must be reported as all other adverse 
events.  “Disease progression” should never be used as an adverse event term.  
Adverse events may include, but are not limited to: 
• Subjective or objective symptoms spontaneously offered by [CONTACT_5363]/or observed 
by [CONTACT_720096].  
• Any AE s experienced by [CONTACT_14205]. 
• AEs not previously observed in the patient  that emerge during the protocol- specified AE 
reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with CLL/SLL that were not 
present before the AE reporting period (see Section 9.3.1) 
• Complications that occur as a result of protocol-mandated interventions (eg, invasive 
procedures such as biopsies). 
The following are NOT considered AEs: 
• Pre-existing condition:  A pre -existing condition (documented on the medical history 
CRF) is not considered an AE unless the severity, frequency, or character of the event 
worsens during the study period. 
Product: IBRUTINIB (PCI -[ZIP_CODE])  Protocol PCYC -1112- CA 28 September 2016  
IND # 102,688   Version: Amendment 7 
Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 72 of 114 • Pre-planned or elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:  A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14147], but rather a therapeutic intervention.  
However, if during the pre -planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14148], which prolongs the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14149], the event will be considered an SAE.  
Surgeries or interventions that were under consideration, but not performed before enrollment in the study, will not be considered serious if they are performed after 
enrollment in the study for a condition that has not changed from its baseline level.  Elective h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_14150], solely for the administration of 
chemotherapy, or due to long travel distances are also not SAEs.  
• Diagnostic Testing and Procedures:   Testing and procedures should not to be reported 
as AEs or SAEs , but rather the cause for the test or procedure should be reported. 
• Asymptomatic Treatment Related Lymphocytosis:  This event should also not be 
considered an AE.  Patients with treatment-related lymphocytosis should remain on study 
treatment and continue with all study -related procedures.  
9.2.2. Serious Adverse Event  
Note: The terms “ severe ” and “serious” are not synonymous .  Severity (or intensity) refers to the 
grade of an AE (see below).  “Serious” is a regulatory definition.  
A SAE  (experience) or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death ( ie, the AE actually causes or leads to death) . 
• Is life -threatening.  L ife-threatening is defined as an AE in which the patient  was at risk 
of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might 
have caused death if it were more severe.   If either the Investigator or the Sponsor 
believes that an AE meets the definition of life- threaten ing, it will be considered 
life-threatening.  
• Requires in -patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] >24 hours or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity ( ie, the AE results in substantial 
disruption of the patient ’s ability to conduct normal life functions). 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
• Is an important medical event that may not resul t in death, be immediately 
life-threatening or requir e hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be considered a n SAE  when, based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the patient or patient may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency department or at home 
for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsion that does  not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Given that the I nvestigator’s perspective may be informed by [CONTACT_36091], 
and the Sponsor is likely to have broader knowledge of the drug and its effects to inform its 
evaluation of the significance of the event, if either the Sponsor or the Investigator believes that 
the event is serious, the event will be considered serious.

IND # 102,688   Version: Amendment 7 
Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 73 of 114 9.2.3. Severity  
Definitions found in the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 
(CTCAE  v4.0) will be used for grading the severity (intensity) of nonhematologic AEs.  Refer to 
Appendix D  for the grading of hematologic AEs.  The CTCAE v4.0 displays Grades 1 through 5 
with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each refere nced AE.  Should a patient experience 
any AE not listed in the CTCAE v4.0, the following grading system should be used to assess severity:  
• Grade 1 (Mild AE) – experiences which are usually transient, requiring no special 
treatment, and not interfering with  the patient ’s daily activities  
• Grade 2 (Moderate AE) – experiences which introduce some level of inconvenience or 
concern to the patient, and which may interfere with daily activities, but are usually 
ameliorated by [CONTACT_14212]  
• Grade 3 (Se vere AE) – experiences which are unacceptable or intolerable, significantly 
interrupt the patient ’s usual daily activity, and require systemic drug therapy or other 
treatment 
• Grade 4 (Life -threatening or disabling AE) – experiences which cause the patient  to be in 
imminent danger of death 
• Grade 5 (Death related to AE) – experiences which result in patient  death  
9.2.4. Causality  
The Investigator is to assess the causal relation ( ie, whether there is a reasonable possibility that 
the study drug caused the event) using the following definitions: 
Not Related:  Another cause of the AE is more plausible; a temporal sequence 
cannot be established with the onset of the AE and administration of the investigational product; or, a causal relationship is considered biologically implausible.  
Unlikely:  The current knowledge or information about the AE indicates that a relationship to the investigational product is unlikely.  
Possibly Related:  There is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and administration  of the investigational product, but the AE 
could also be attributed to concurrent or underlying disease, or the use of other drugs or procedures.  Possibly related should be used 
when the investigational product is one of several biologically 
plausible AE  causes.  
Related:  The AE is clearly related to use of the investigational product.

Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 74 of 114 9.2.5. Unexpected  Adverse Events  
An “unexpected” AE is an AE that is not listed in the Investigator's Brochure/package insert or is 
not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  For example, hepatic necrosis 
would be “unexpected” (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the Investigator's Brochure referred only 
to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral 
vasculitis wou ld be “unexpected” (by [CONTACT_14214]) if the Investigator's Brochure/ 
package insert listed only cerebral vascular accidents.  "Unexpected" also refers to AEs that are 
mentioned in the Investigator's Brochure as occurring with a class of dr ugs or as anticipated from 
the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with 
the study drug under investigation. 
9.3. Documenting and Reporting of Adverse and Serious Adverse Events by 
[CONTACT_720097] r is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs that are observed or reported 
during the study, as outlined in the prior sections, are recorded on the CRF.  All SAEs also must

9.3.1. Adverse Event Reporting Period  
All adverse events will be reported from the time the patient signs the Informed Consent Form 
until [ADDRESS_982621] to follow -up or 
withdraws consent.  Resolution/stable means the patient  has returned to baseline state of health 
or the Investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the event. 
If a death occurs within [ADDRESS_982622], or other means will be recorded in the patient ’s medical record and on the AE 
CRF and, when applicable, on the SAE Worksheet.

9.3.3. Expedited Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs (initial and follow -up information) will be reported on the SAE Worksheet and faxed 
to Pharmacyclics Drug Safety, or designee, within [ADDRESS_982623] foll ow-up and other additional information from the 
Investigator ( eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]/discharge notes and laboratory results).  The contact 
[CONTACT_3031] (phone, fax and email) for the drug safety can be found on the SAE Worksheet form  
and instructions. 
All d eaths should be reported with the primary cause of death as the AE term, as death is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_36069], not the event itself.  The primary cause of death on the 
autopsy report or the adverse event/SAE most proximal to death should be the term reported.  
Autopsy and postmortem reports must be forwarded to Pharmacyclics Drug Safety, or designee, as outlined above. 
If study drug is discontinued because of an SAE, this information must be included in the SAE 
report.  
9.3.4. Events of Special Interest  
Specific adverse events, or groups of adverse events, will be followed as part of standard safety 
monitoring activities by [CONTACT_1034].  These events will be reported to the Sponsor within 
24 hours of awareness following the procedure described above for SA Es (Section  9.3.3) 
and will require enhanced data collection.  All Events of Special Interest will be submitted 
without a serious criterion selected if no other serious criterion is met.

12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This section outlines statistical analysis approaches and methods f or the study.  Specific details 
for efficacy and safety analyses will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
12.1. General Considerations 
12.1.1. Independent Review Committee  (IRC) 
The IRC will be chaired by a physician with expertise in CLL and SLL and wi ll conduct 
response evaluations in accordance with the IRC charter . 
12.1.2. Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) 
The safety of this study will be monitored by [CONTACT_3153]. 
An early safety analysis will be performed after approximately [ADDRESS_982630] been treated for 
approximately 8 weeks.  This analysis will focus on deaths, treatment discontinuations, SAEs, 
and grade 3/[ADDRESS_982631] further safety analyses.   Results from a pre- specified interim analysis will also be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_1363] . 
The independent DMC will be chaired by a physician with expertise in CLL and SLL.  The 
DMC will review data and provide recommendations regarding stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_720044].  The Sponsor may attend only the blinded portion of the 
DMC meetings to answer questions as necessary.  The DMC charter will provide provisions for restricted communications between the DMC and the Sponsor in the event the DMC 
recommends stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_720045].  Follo wing the DMC review of the 
prespecified interim analysis and the unanimous recommendation that the study be stopped early 
and patients on ofatumumab be provided access to ibrutinib – the DMC reviews have concluded.

IND # 102,688   Version: Amendment 7 
Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 80 of 114 12.2. Randomization 
Two randomization schemes will be generated : one for each geographic region (North America 
versus Rest of World).  Under each scheme, randomization will be stratified using the following 
two stratification factors  and patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 
ofatumumab or ibrutinib within each randomization stratum : 
a) The presence or absence of disease that is refractory to purine analog and anti- CD20 
containing chemoimmunotherapy regimen (at least 2 cycles).  Refractory is defined 
as treatment failure (best overall response of SD or progressive disease on treatment) 
or disease progression within [ADDRESS_982632] dose of purine analog. 
b) The presence or absence of 17p del as determined by [CONTACT_720105] . 
12.3. Sample Size  considerations  
This study is designed to evalua te PFS and is powered based on this endpoint.  Therefore, the 
desired operating characteristics for the PFS endpoint are used to determine the study’s total 
sample size and overall duration.  
With the agreement from the  European (Rapporteur and Co-Rapporte urs) and US Health 
Authorities , the overall two-sided significance level for this study is revised from 0.01 to 0.05. 
Given this revision in overall significance level , 176 PFS events provides approximately 90% 
power to detect the target hazard ratio of 0.[ADDRESS_982633] 5.4 (Cytel 
Software Corp., Cambridge, MA). 
12.4. Interim Analysis  
A pre -specified interim analysis for both superiority  and futility (non-binding) will be performed 
after approximately [ADDRESS_982634]. One -hundred and seventeen (117) PFS events correspond to 66.5% of the revised 
planned number of PFS events (176 ) for the final analysis.  Lan-DeMets spending function with 
O’Brien -Fleming boundary w ill be  used as an early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_188133] ( O'Brien 1979) .  At the 
interim analysis , the alpha spending for PFS will be determined based on the actual information 
fraction using O’Brien -Fleming boundary.  Significance level for all secondary endpoints except 
OS will be adjusted with the same significance level as for PFS at the interim analysis.  The two 
sided significance level for OS will be 0.[ADDRESS_982635]: IBRUTINIB (PCI -[ZIP_CODE])  Protocol PCYC -1112- CA 28 September 2016  
IND # 102,688   Version: Amendment 7 
Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 81 of 114 12.5. Final Analysis  
The final analysis for the PFS  will be conducted after approximately 176 PF S events are 
confirmed by [CONTACT_26732]. T he two -sided significance level for the final analysis for primary and all 
secondary endpoints will be adjusted to  account for interim alpha spending so the overall two -
sided significance level for the study will be preserved at 0.05.   
12.6. Analysis Populations  
12.6.1. Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
The ITT population is  defined as all patients who were randomized.  All efficacy analysis will be 
performed using the ITT population and patients in the ITT population will be analyzed as 
randomized. In addition, ITT population will be used to summarize demographics, and baseline 
and disease characteristics.  
12.6.2. Safety Population 
The safety population includes all patients who received at least one dose of  study drug.  The 
safety analysis wi ll be performed using the safety population and patients in the safety 
population will be analyzed as treated. 
12.6.3. Pharmacokinetic (PK) Evaluable Population 
Pharmacokinetic (PK)  evaluable population includes patient s who received at least [ADDRESS_982636] consented 
to participate in the study’s biomarker evaluation. 12.7. Control for Bias  
The following study design components will facilitate the control for bias:  
• Large (approximately 350 patients)  
• Multicenter  
• Randomized  
The randomization code will be controlled through a centralized procedure and will not be 
known to sponsor personnel directly involved with study conduct or data analysis until after the 
interim analysis (if early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_540107]) or final analysis.  The unblinding procedure 
will be described in detail in the study unblinding plan.

Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 82 of 114 12.8. Efficacy Analyses 
All the stratified analyses will be based on the two randomization stratification factors: 
1) refractory disease (presence versus absence) to purine analog and anti-CD20 containing 
chemoimmunotherapy regimen, and 2) status of 17p del (presence versus absen ce). 
12.8.1. Primary Endpoint  and Methods  
The primary efficacy endpoint is PFS , which is defined as the  time from  the date of 
randomization until disease progression ( assessed by [CONTACT_720052] 2008 criteria) or death 
from any cause, whichever occurs first .  Patients who withdraw from the study or are considered 
lost to follow -up without prior documentation of disease progression will be censored on the date 
of the last adequate disease assessment.  For patients without an adequate post- baseline disease 
assessment, PFS will be censored on the date of randomization. 
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed in the ITT population to compare PFS as 
assessed by [CONTACT_720106] a stratified log rank test.  Distribution of 
PFS will be summarized for each treatment arm using median and its corresponding 95% 
confidence interval based on Kaplan- Meier estimates.  The estimate of the hazard ratio and its 
corresponding 95 percent confidence interval will be computed using a Cox Propor tional 
Hazards model stratified by [CONTACT_720107].  
12.8.2. Secondary Endpoints and Methods  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Overall Survival (OS) and Survival Rate at Landmark Points  
Patients will be followed for survival status until end of study. 
OS is defined as t he time from date of randomization until date of death due to any cause.  
Patients who are known to be alive or whose survival status is unknown will be censored at the date last known to be alive.  Patients who are completely lost to follow-up for surviva l will be 
censored at randomization date.  
The analysis methods for overall survival will be similar to those described for PFS.  
In addition, survival rate at landmark points will be summarized for each treatment arm using 
Kaplan -Meier point estimates and compared using the standard normal Z test. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Overall Response Rate 
Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a CR, CRi, nPR, or PR over the course of the study as evaluated by [CONTACT_720108] [ADDRESS_982637]: IBRUTINIB (PCI -[ZIP_CODE])  Protocol PCYC -1112- CA 28 September 2016

PRO as measured by [CONTACT_720050] -Fatigue will be summarized as the change in scores from baseline 
to each assessment.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematological Improvements  
In the subset of patient s with cytopenia(s)  at baseline (Hgb ≤11 g/dL, platelets ≤100,000/μL, or 
ANC ≤1500 /μL), time to sustained improvement and percentage of patients with sustained 
hematological improvement will be measured .  Sustained hematological improvement is defined 
as improvement in cytopenia by ≥50%, or Hgb >11 g/dL, ANC >1500/μL, platelets >100,000/μL 
with the duration of improvement lasting for at least 2 months without blood transfusion or 
growth factors.  
• Time to sustained improvement in blood count will be compared using unstratified log 
rank test.  The distribution of the time to sustained improvement will be summarized 
using Kaplan -Meier estimates. 
• Percentage of patients with sustained improvement will be compared using χ2 test. 
12.8.3. Exploratory Endpoints and Methods  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Investigator- Assessed PFS  
Investigator- assessed PFS is defined as time from randomization until disease progression 
(assessed by [CONTACT_720109] 2008 criteria) or death from any cause, whichever 
occurs first.  
Analysis methods for Investigator- assessed PFS will be similar to those described for PFS as 
assessed by [CONTACT_26732]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Investigator- Assessed ORR  
Investigator- assessed ORR will be summarized and analyzed similarly to IRC -assessed ORR.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Improvement of Disease- related Symptoms  
Disease-related symptoms including weight loss, fatigue, fever, night sweats, abdominal pain  
due to splenomegaly, or anorexia ) will be assessed by [CONTACT_720110].  
Percentage of patients with improvement will be compared using χ2 test. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Patient -Reported Outcome  (PRO) Measures  
Patient Reported Outcome  (PRO) measures i nclude EORTC QLQ- C30 and EQ -5D-5L. 
For EORTC  QLQ- C30, change in scores from baseline to each assessment will be summarized.

IND # 102,688   Version: Amendment 7 
Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 84 of 114 For EQ -5D-5L, change in weighted utility score from baseline to each assessment will be 
summarized.  The scores for the five categorical dimensions will be used to compute a single 
utility score ranging from zero (0.0) to one (1.0) representing the general health status of the 
patient.  The [LOCATION_008] weights will be used to generate patient util ities from the 
5 dimensions. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Biomarker Analysis  
Analyses are to identify biomarkers that are predictive of response (or resistance) to ibrutinib . 
Analyses will be performed within each treatment group in total and stratified by [CONTACT_720111].  The associations of biomarkers with clinical response or 
time-to-event endpoints will be assessed using the appropriate statistical methods (analysis of 
variance [ANOVA], categorical, or survival model), depending on the endpoint.  Correlation of 
baseline expression levels or changes in expression levels with response or time- to-event 
endpoints will identify responsive (or resistant) subgroups. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Medical Resource Utilization (MRU) Associated with the Therapy  
Parameters collected for MRU associated with the therapy include number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], 
number of emergency department visits, number of blood product transfusions, and number of 
use of hematopoietic growth factors.  Those parameters will be summarized with descriptive 
statistics by [CONTACT_2939].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analysis 
The plasma concentration data for ibrutinib  will be summarized using descriptive statistics at 
each timepoint.  Population PK analysis of plasma concentration -time data of ibrutinib  will be 
performed using nonlinear mixed- effects modeling.  Data may be combined with data from other 
studies to support a relevant population PK model.  Available patient  characteristics 
(eg, demographics, laboratory variables, genotypes, etc.) will be tested as potential covaria tes 
affecting PK parameters. Details will be given in a population PK analysis plan and the results of 
the population PK analysis will be presented in a separate report.  
12.9. Safety Analyses  
Safety summaries will inclu de tabul ations in the form of tables and listings.  The safety analysis 
will be conducted using the safety population.  Patients will be analyzed according to the actual 
treatment received.  
Study drug exposure including duration and dosage as well as dose modificatio ns of study drug 
including dose reduction, dose delay, missed doses, and dose interruption will be summarized.

Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 100 of 114 Appendix D: Hematologic Adverse Event Grading Scheme ( Hallek 2008) 
An evaluation of the hematologic toxicity in patient s with advanced CLL/SLL must consider the 
high frequency of marrow involvement and previous exposure to chemotherapy with consequent 
medullary compromise at the initiation of therapy.  The standard hematologic grading system for 
solid tumors cannot, therefore, be directly applied.  A substantial proportion of patient s would be 
considered to have Grade 2 to 4 hematologic toxicity before any therapy is given.  There fore, the 
following modified schema will be used to quantitate  hematologic deterioration in patient s with 
CLL/SLL.  
Hematologic Grading Scheme  
Decrease in Platelets or Hgb 
(Nadir) from Pre- treatment Value, 
% ANC/μL (nadir)c Toxicity Grade  
0 - 10%a ≥ 2000 0 
11 - 24%a,b ≥ 1500 and < 2000 1 
25 - 49%a,b ≥ 1000 and < 1500 2 
50 - 74%a,b ≥ 500 and < 1000 3 
> 75%a,b < 500 4 
a. If at any level of decrease, the platelet count falls below 20 × 109/L, toxicity will be considered Grade 4. 
If the baseline platelet count is <20 × 109/L, platelet toxicity cannot be evaluated.  
b. Baseline and subsequent Hgb values must be determined the day of any given transfusion.  
c. If the ANC was < 1000/µL  before therapy, the patient is not evaluable for toxicity referable to the ANC.

CIRS is an indicator of illness severity and comorbidity in older patients ( Extermann, 1998)1. 
CIRS scoring is to be performed in the setting of a pretreatment comprehensive history an d 
physical by a licensed provider (nurse, PA, MD, or DO) for all patients 65 years and older. 
Instructions:  
The following pages include the CIRS scoring worksheet displaying 14 organ- system categories. 
Write brief descriptions of the medical problem(s) that justified the endorsed score on the line 
following each item. Circle the appropriate score from 0 – 4 based on the rating strategy.  Space 
is provided in each system organ class to provide written descriptions. 
1. Complete each category score as identified by [CONTACT_720117] 
2. Each category has room for written comments. If ad ditional room is needed, please 
document on the back of the form 
3. Add the number of Total Categories Endorsed  (measured)  
4. Provide the Total Score  
5. Provide the Severity Index  (total score divided by [CONTACT_720118]) 
6. Provide the number of categories at level 3 severity  
7. Provide the number of categories at level 4 severity  
CLL Rating:  
Please take into account that CLL/SLL diagnosis itself or induced illness or organ damage 
(including cytopenias) are not included in this rating scale.  The goal of this rating scale is to 
assess comorbidity other than CLL/SLL in the patient.

Class  Functional Capacity: How a patient with  cardiac disease feels during physical 
activity  
I Patients with  cardiac disease but  resulting in no limitation of physical activity. 
Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea or 
anginal pain. 
II Patients with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical activity.  They are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea or anginal pain. 
III Patients with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea or anginal pain. 
IV Patients with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure or the anginal syndrome may be present even at rest.   If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort increases.  
Class  Objective Assessment  
A No objective evidence of cardiovascular disease. No symptoms and no limitation in ordinary physical activity. 
B Objective evidence of minimal cardiovascular disease. Mild symptoms and slight limitation during ordinary activity. Comfortable at rest.  
C Objective evidence of moderately severe cardiovascular disease. Marked limitation in activity due to symptoms, even during less- than-ordinary activity. Comfortable 
only at rest.  
D Objective evidence of severe cardiovascular disease. Severe limitations. Experiences symptoms eve n while at rest.

Chemoimmuno-
therapy For the purpose of this protocol, a combination treatment regimen that contains both a cytotoxic, specifically a purine analog or alkylating agent, chemotherapy agent and an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (eg, rituximab) administered together.  
Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA)  Defined by [CONTACT_720119] (indirect bilirubin above the upper limit of normal (ULN) not due to liver disease, increased lactate dehydrogenase (above ULN) without alternative etiology, or increased absolute reticulocytosis (above ULN) or bone marrow erythropoiesis in 
the absence of bleeding) AND at least one marker of direct or indirect 
autoimmune mechanism (positive direct antiglobulin for IgG or C3d, cold agglutinins) ( Ding 2007).  
Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)  Immune thrombocytopenia is defined by [CONTACT_685628] ≤100,000/µL and increased megakaryocytes o n the bone marrow exam. 
Autoimmune cytopenia poorly responsive to therapy Autoimmune anemia or thrombocytopenia poorly responsive to treatment includes those patients with recurrent autoimmune cytopenias, those receiving low dose steroids ( ≤ 20 mg of prednisone or equivalent) and 
those on intravenous immune globulin ( IVIG ).  Patients receiving higher 
doses of steroids or experiencing declining platelets or hemoglobin due to autoimmune destruction during the [ADDRESS_982657] uncontrolled autoimmune cytopenias (as defined below) and are not eligible for enrollment. 
Autoimmune cytopenia, uncontrolled Uncontrolled autoimmune anemia or thrombocytopenia is defined as those patients receiving > 20 mg prednisone (or equivalent) daily or have 
declining platelets or hemoglobin due to autoimmune destruction during the [ADDRESS_982658]: IBRUTINIB (PCI -[ZIP_CODE])  Protocol PCYC -1112- CA 28 September 2016

Title of Study:
A Phase 2, Multicenter, Randomized, Parallel -Arm, Placebo -Controlled Study of LY3074828 in Subjects with 
Active Crohn’s Disease
Rationale: 
Study I6T -MC-AMAG (AMAG) is a Phase 2 study designed to dete rmine whether LY3074828, a humanized 
immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) –variant monoclonal antibody that binds to the p19 subunit of interleukin 23 (IL -23), is 
safe and efficacious in subjects with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease.  This study will help evaluate s afety and 
determine the clinical activity defined by [CONTACT_129199]’s disease activity measures and key 
patient-reported outcomes (PRO) measures.

Summary of Study Design:   
Study AMAG is a multicenter, randomized, parallel -arm, placebo -controlled trial in which approximately 
180subjects will be randomized.  All subjects in the study will have had loss of response or intolerance to 
conventional medication used to treat Crohn’s disease.  
Study Periods:
Screening (Approximately 4 Weeks) : Subjects will be evaluated for study eligibility ≤28 days before the baseline 
visit.
Period 1 (Weeks 0 to 12) :  A 12-week dosing period is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LY3074828 
administered intravenously (IV) at Weeks 0, 4, 8.  At base line, subjects will be randomized with a 2:1:1:2 allocation 
across the 4 treatment arms (1000, 600, 200 mg LY3074828, and placebo) and stratified on the basis of previous 
exposure to biologic therapy for treatment of Crohn’s disease.
Period 2 (Weeks 12 to 52):Patients will receive both intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) dosing to maintain 
blinding from Weeks 12 through 48.  All patients who received LY3074828 treatment in Period 1 and who achieved 
an improvement in their Simple Endoscopic Score for Cr ohn’s Disease (SES -CD) score from baseline at Week 12 
(determined by [CONTACT_9251]) will be randomized evenly to either (i) continue Period 1 treatment assignment 
(IV LY3074828 1000 mg, 600mg, or 200mg every 4weeks [Q4W]) with placebo administered subcutaneously 
Q4W OR (ii) IV placebo Q4W with SC LY3074828 300 mg Q4W.
All patients who received LY3074828 treatment in Period 1 and who did not achieve an improvement from baseline 
SES-CD score at Week 12 will receive IV LY3074828 1000 mg and SC placebo Q4W.
All patients who received placebo in Period 1 will receive IV LY3074828 1000 mg and SC placebo Q4W. 
Randomization will be stratified based on endoscopic response (i.e. achieving a 50% reduction in SES -CD score 
from baseline).
Period 3 (Weeks 52 to 10 4):  All subjects having clinical benefit per investigator and continuing on study 
treatment may proceed to Period 3 and receive 300 mg SC LY3074828 Q4W open -labelstarting at Week 52 
through Week 104. Patients not receiving clinical benefit at Week 52 will discontinue treatment and will enter 
the Follow -Up period.
Follow-Up (Weeks 104 to 120) :  At Week 104, subjects will stop treatment and be followed for safety for an 
additional 16 weeks.
Number of Subjects:
Approximately 180 subjects will be randomized.
I6T-MC-AMAG(b) Clinical Protocol Page 10
LY3074828Statistical Analysis:
The primary endpoint is Week 12 endoscopic response rate (defined as a 50% reduction in SES -CD).  For 
endoscopic response, the assumed LY3074828 and placebo rates are 35% and 15%, respectively. 
Treatment comparisons of the primary endpoint and other categorical efficacy variables will be conducted using a 
logistic regression analysis with treatment, geographic region, and prior biologic Crohn’s disease therapy use 
(yes/no) in the model.  Unless otherwise specified, efficacy and heal th outcomes analyses will be conducted on the 
intent-to-treat population (ITT).

LY30748283.Introduction
3.1.Study Rationale
Study I6T-MC-AMAG (AMAG) is a Phase 2 study designed to determine whether LY3074828, 
a humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) –variant monoclonal antibody  that binds to the p19 
subunit of interleukin (IL) -23,is safe and efficacio us in subjects with m oderate to severe Crohn’s 
disease.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_129186], m any subjects with Crohn’s disease 
experience primary or secondary  treatment failure;thus,a significant unm et need rem ains 
(Gordon et al .2015).  IL-23 is a validated target for evaluation o f treatment of vari ous 
autoimmune/inflammatory  diseases, including Crohn’s disease (see Section 3.2).  This Phase2 
study will help evaluate safet y and determine the clinical act ivity defined by [CONTACT_129202]’s disease act ivity measures and key  patient-reported outcomes (PRO) measures.
3.2.Background
LY3074828 is being developed for the treatment of autoimmune diseases where the IL -[ADDRESS_145739] a significant pathogenic role.   LY3074828 neutralizes IL -23 activit y 
by [CONTACT_129203] p19 subunit.
Treatment of autoimmune/inflammatory  diseases wi th IL-[ADDRESS_145740] such bio logic to dem onstrate clinical benefit in autoimmune 
disease was ustekinumab, which is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved 
monoclonal antibody  for the treatm ent of psoriasis and psori atic arthritis (Stelara ®prescribing 
information2014)as well as Crohn’s disease ( Feagan et al . 2016;Stelara®prescribing 
information2016). Ustekinumab binds the common p40 subunit of IL -12 and IL -23; therefore, it 
targets both cy tokines, rather than IL -[ADDRESS_145741]  may 
prevent Th1 cell –induced interferon blockade o f Th17 cell development, thus potentially  limiting 
the clinical activit y of p40 targeting antibodies.  Experimental studies suggest that blocking the 
IL-23/Th17/IL-17 immune axis alo ne is sufficient to treat autoimmune inflammat ion 
(Monteleone et al . 2009).  Agents specifically  targeting the IL -[ADDRESS_145742] ivity in psoriasis (including LY3074828 in Study AMAA) and Crohn’s 
disease(Sofen et al. 2014; Kopp et al. 2015; Krueger et al. 2015 ).  IL-[ADDRESS_145743] also demonstrated clinical activit y inCrohn’s disease (Sands et al. 2015 ; Feagan 
et al. 2016).  The IL-23/Th17 pathway is believed to have a significant role in this disease 
(Gheita et al. 2014; Globig et al. 2014; El -Bassat et al. 2015).

LY30748285.4.Scientific Rationale for Study Design
IL-23 is a validated target for evaluat ion of treatment of various autoimmune/inflammatory  
diseases, including Crohn’s disease (see Section3.2).  Period 1 is designed to establish the 
efficacy (endoscopi c changes and key  PRO) and safet y of LY3074828 versus placebo in subjects 
with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease .  Subjects may  continue background pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_129188]’s disease as permitted per protocol; therefore, the select ion of placebo as a comparator 
in this subject populat ion is justified to effect ively evaluate the safet y and efficacy of 
LY3074828.  Period 2 (Week s 12 to 52) will allow for continued evaluat ion of efficacy  and 
safety with baseline treatment regimens and exploration of SCdosing—except for all subjects in 
the placebo group and subjects in the LY3074828 trea tment groups whohave not had any 
improvement in SES -CD score from baseline at Week 12.  Period [ADDRESS_145750] ion period (Period 1) are projected to produce mean trough 
concentrations of 2.7 to 13 g/ml.  The projected exposures for the planned doses are similar to 
those that have been evaluated and found to be effective induct ion regimens in Crohn’s disease
for the IL-12/IL-23 antibody ustekinumab (Sandborn et al. 2012; Adedokun et al. 2016; and the 
IL-23 antibody  BI-655066 (Feagan et al. 2016).
InPeriod 2, patients will be randomized to continue their induct ion regimen or be reduced to a 
300mg SC LY3074828 Q4W regimen.  In Period 3, all subjects will be administered 300 mg 
subcutaneously Q4W.  Based on the SC bioavailabilit y of LY3074828, a 300 mg SC dose will 
produce an exposure area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC)
approximately  40% lower and a trough concentration (3.2 g/ml) that is slight ly higher than the 
lowest induct ion dose (IV 200 mg).  Therefore, data fro m Period 2will allow evaluat ion of 
response with cont inued treatment at the induct ion dose levels versus reduction to a lower 
exposure level.  Experience wit h anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti -TNF) antibodies in 
inflammatory  bowel disease (IBD) suggests that the exp osure requi red to maintain response in 
subjects wi th IBD may  be lower than the exposure required to induce response (Rutgeerts et al. 
2004).
The margin of safety for the high dose of IV [ADDRESS_145751] 
level(NOAEL) observed in the 6- month nonclinical toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys is 
8 based on dose and 1.9 based on AUC(TableAMAG.2).  No adverse effects were observed in 
the 6-month nonclinical toxico logy study in cynomolgus monkeys at the highest tested dose 
(100mg/kg subcutaneously  Q4W).

timeline:
anti-TNF therapy  at least 8 weeks before baseline
vedolizumab treatment at least 12 weeks before baseline
experimental bio logic Crohn’s disease therapy at least 8 weeks before 
baseline.
[5]may be receiving a therapeutic dosage of the f ollowing drugs:
I6T-MC-AMAG(b) Clinical Protocol Page 36
LY3074828Oral 5-aminosalicylic (ASA) compounds :  if the prescribed dose has been stable 
for at least 3weeks before screening co lonoscopy or stopped treatm ent at least 
3weeks prior to screening colonoscopy .
Oral corticosteroids must be at a prednisone-equivalent dose of ≤20 mg/day, or 
≤9mg/day of budesonide, and have been at a stable dose for at least [ADDRESS_145753] 3 weeks prior to screening co lonoscopy.

each barrier method must include use of a spermicide (that is, condom with 
spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, female condo m with spermicide ).It 
should be noted that the use of male and female condo ms as a double barrier 
method is not considered acceptable due to the high failure rate when these 
methods are combined.

the sponsor and sites have agreed all unused medication is to be destroy ed by [CONTACT_779], as
allowed by  [CONTACT_1769].
7.1.1.Packaging and Labeling
LY3074828 will be supplied to the invest igator by [CONTACT_11007] .  Clinical trial materials are 
manufactured in accordance wit h good m anufacturing practices .  All investigational products 
will be stored, inventoried, re conciled, and destroyed according to applicable regulat ions.
LY3074828 is supplied for clinical trial use as lyo philized powder in a glass vial and should be 
stored in refrigerated condit ions (2ºC to 8ºC).  The vial is manufactured to deliver [ADDRESS_145766] ion and further diluted with 
normal saline (0.9% sodi um chloride) before administration.  Placebo will be sterile normal 
saline (0.9% sodium chloride for inject ion).
When reconst ituted and in a s yringe, LY3074828 cannot be distinguished visually  from placebo.
Detailed instructions regarding supplies and preparation and handling of LY3074828 will be 
provided by [CONTACT_456].
Clinical trial materials will be labeled according to the country ’s regulatory requirements.
7.2.Method of Treatment Assignment
Subjects who meet all criteria for enrollment will be randomized to treatment at Visit 2.  
Assignment to treatment groups will be determined by a co mputer-generated random sequence 
using an interactive web -response system (IWRS).  To achieve between -group com parability, 
subjects will be stratified to these arms based upon their prior therapy  (below); this stratificat ion 
will be controlled by [CONTACT_10966]. 
A minimum of approximately 30% of subjects will be naive to b iologic Crohn’s disease
therapy (including experimental bio logicCrohn’s di seasetherapy).
At least 50% of the subjects will be prior bio logic Crohn’s disease therapy-experienced 
(including experience with experimental bio logic Crohn’s disease therapy).
For Period 2,subjects assigned to LY3074828 at bas eline will be rando mized to either 
baseline treatment assignment or 300 mg SC LY3074828 Q4W —except for all subjects 
in the placebo group, and subjects in the LY3074828 treatment groups who have not had 
any improvement in SES -CD score from baseline at Week 12 (determined by [CONTACT_129211]), who will receive 1000 mg IV LY3074828 Q4W.   All subjects will receive IV 
and SC administration of eit her LY3074828 or placebo during Period 2 in a 
double-dummy desi gn.The randomization will be stratified based on endoscopic 
response (as defined for the primary  endpoint).
I6T-MC-AMAG(b) Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_145767]’s case report form 
(CRF). All study procedures (including blood tests) are to be performed predose unless 
otherwise specified in the Schedule of Act ivities.
7.3.Blinding
This is a double -blind study; to preserve the blinding of the study , a minimum number of Lilly  
personnel will see the rando mization table and treatment assignments before the study  is 
complete.  Only  a study site pharmacist or other trained person will be unblinded at the site for 
investigat ional product preparation.
Emergency  unblinding for AEs m ay be perform ed through the IWRS, which may supplement or 
take the place of emergency  codes generated by  a computer drug -labeling system.  This option 
should be used ONLY if the subject’s well -being requires knowledge of the subject’s treatment 
assignment.  All notifications result ing in an unbl inding event are recorded and reported by  [CONTACT_129212].
If an invest igator, site personnel performing assessments, or subject is unblinded, the subject 
must be discont inued from the study.  In cases where there are ethical reasons to have the subject 
remain inthe study, the investigator must obtain specific approval fro m a Lilly clinical research 
physician (CRP) for the subject to continue in the study .
In case of an emergency , the invest igator has the sole responsibilit y for determining if unblinding
of a subject’s treatment assignment is warranted.  Subject safet y must always be the first 
consideration in making such a determinat ion.  If the invest igator decides that unblinding is 
warranted, the invest igator should make every effo rt to contact [CONTACT_129213] 
a subject’s treatment assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment of the subject.  If a 
subject’s treatment assignment is unblinded, Lilly must be notified immediately.
7.4.Dosage Modification
Dose adjust ments are not per mitted in this study , except as noted in Sect ion 7.8.2.
7.5.Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability
Detailed instructions regarding supplies and pre paration and handling of LY3074828 will be 
provided by [CONTACT_456].
7.6.Treatment Compliance
Every attempt will be m ade to sel ect subjects who have the abilit y to understand and co mply 
with study instructions.  The invest igator is responsible for discussing me thods to ensure high 
treatment compliance wi th the subject before randomizat ion.  
All doses o f study medication will be administered at the study  site.  Deviat ion(s) from the 
prescribed dosage regimen should be recorded in the CRF.
I6T-MC-AMAG(b) Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_145768] is noncomp liant with study procedures and/or invest igational product administration, 
the investigator should assess the subject to determine the reason for noncompliance and educate 
and/or manage the subject as appropriate to improve co mpliance.  If, in consultat ionwith Lilly or 
its designee, the noncompliance is deemed to be significant or if further nonco mpliance occurs, 
the subject should be discontinued from the study .  A subject will be considered nonco mpliant if 
he or she fails to attend for administration of study medicat ion within the required treatment 
window as defined in the Schedule of Activities (Section2).
7.7.Concomitant Medications
All concomitantmedication taken during the study must be recorded on the concomitant 
medication CRF.  All subjects should maintain their usual medicat ion regimens for concomitant 
conditions or diseases throughout the study  unless those m edications are specifically exclu ded in 
the protocol.  Subjects taking concomitant medicatio ns should be on stable dosages at the time of 
baseline and should remain at stable dosages throughout the study  unless changes need to be 
made because of AEs.  Addit ional systemic drugs are to be a voided during the study, unless 
required to treat AEs.  Other medicat ions may be allowed if they  are approved by [CONTACT_3160].
Use of nonlive (inact ivated) vaccinations are allowed for all subjects.  Use of live, attenuated 
vaccines is prohi bited.  Occasi onal use of acetaminophen in over -the-counter dose ranges for 
headache, menstrual pain, or other transient conditio ns is acceptable but should be held on study  
visit days unt il after assessments have been co mpleted, as much as possible; use o f prophylactic 
daily aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (up to 162.5 m g) is permitted.  
Concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_129190]’s disease during the study  are permi tted only as

8.1.2.Discontinuation of Inadvertently Enrolled Subjects
If the sponsor or invest igator ident ify a subject who did not meet enrollment criteria and was 
inadvertent ly enrolled, a discussio n must occur betwe en the sponsor CRP and the invest igator to 
determine if the subject may cont inue in the study .  If both agree i t is medically appropriate to 
continue, the invest igator must obtain documented approval fro m the sponsor CRP to allow the 
inadvertent ly enrolledsubject to continue in the study  with or without treatm ent with 
investigat ional product.
8.2.Discontinuation from the Study
Some possible reasons that may  lead to perm anent discontinuat ion include:

9.1.Efficacy Assessments
9.1.1.Primary Efficacy Assessments
The primary  efficacy outcome m easure is endoscopi c response o f LY3074828 v ersus placebo at 
Week 12.  Endoscopic response is defined as having 50% reduction from baseline in SES -CD 
Score (Vuitton et al .2015).  
The SES-CD (Daperno et al. 2004 ) tool will be utilized by  [CONTACT_129216] (colonoscopy ) examinat ion
9.1.2.Secondary Efficacy Assessments
Secondary  efficacy assessments will include an assessment of the SES -CD score using centrally 
read endoscopy  at Weeks 12 and 52, and an assessment of SF and AP at Weeks 12 and 52, using 
patient-reported data recorded in the patient diary, as detailed below.  Changes in hea lth outcome 
measures/qualit y-of-life measures from baseline to Weeks 12 and 52, and the PK properties of 
LY3074828 will also be assessed.  Effects on safety parameters will also be assessed (see 
Section 9.5).
Endoscopic remissio n is defined as an SES -CD score of <4 for ileal-colonicdiseaseor<2 
for isolated ileal disease, and no subscore >1.
PRO scores will be determined as an average of [ADDRESS_145779] itute a missing data score.  Data will be 
excluded fro m score calculation when collected on day(s) ofcolonoscopy  prep, day  of 
colonoscopy  procedure, and 2daysafter colonoscopy  procedure.   PRO remissio n is 
defined as having an average daily  APscore≤1 and an average daily SF ≤2.5 (abso lute 
number of liquid or very  soft stools defined using the Bristol Stool Scale Category  6 or 7 
[Lewis and Heaton 1997], that is, liquid or watery  stools).
9.1.3.Subject Diary
Subjects will be provided with a diary tool during screening in order to record informat ion 
pertaining to subjects’signs and symptoms on a daily  basis:

c.general well -being (5-point scale)
3.
4.Bowel movement count ( BMC; that is , absolute number of stools irrespect ive of quantit y 
and consistency) .
Diary data will be assessed at the clinic, at each visit defined in the Scheduleof Activities.  
Information regarding ;number of 
liquid or very  soft stools;and general well -beingscore (5-point scale :  0=generally well, 
1=slightly under par, 2=poor, 3=very  poor, 4=terrible) will be collected daily to calculate the 
subjects’ PRO2 and CDAI scores (s ee Section 9.1.5).
Data will include informat ion collected over 7 days during a 12 -day period prior to each study  
visit(<4 days of data within a 12 -day period prior to a specified visit will consti tute a mis sing 
data score). During visits when colonoscopy  is required, subject diary  data from colonoscopy 
preparation day(s), day of the colonoscopy  procedure, and two daysafter the col onoscopy  
procedure will be excluded from score calculat ions.  
In order to en courage consistent diary recording, subject should enter daily diary data 
continuously throughout the study .  
The study  data com pletion guidelines and study  data management plan will provide detailed 
information on use of PRO measures and the subject diar y.
9.1.4.Endoscopy 
To ensure qualit y data and standardi zation, endoscopy  will be performed locally at clinical sites 
per the study  schedules and using the same endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_129192]. 
During the study , the SES-CD will be evaluated by [CONTACT_33494]/endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_129193] a 
central reader blinded to study  treatment. However, only the SES-CD score from the central 
reader will be used to determine study  eligibilityand endoscopi c efficacy  evaluation.  A detailed 
imagingreview char ter from the central  reading l aboratory  will outline the endoscopi c 
procedures, video recordings, and equipment to be used for video capture and transmissio n of 
endoscopi c recordings.  For each subject, video recording of the ent ire endoscopi c procedure wi ll 
be perform ed using a storage medium provided by [CONTACT_36613].  The endoscopic 
recordings will be read centrally in a blinded manner by  a qualified gastroenterologist according 
to the image review charter.  
Biopsies will be collected during t he endoscopy  procedure.  Thedetails of  biopsy sample 
collection will be provided in the laboratory  manual.  Biopsies will be used for  
and histopathological assessment (Appendix 5 ).  To ensure qualit y data and 
standardization, bowel  tissue histopathol ogic scoring will be performed by [CONTACT_129217]
I6T-MC-AMAG(b) Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_145780] according to the image review charter.
9.1.5.Other Assessments
Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI):  CDAI is an [ADDRESS_145781] ivity measure 
comprisedof 3patient-reported and 5physician -reported/l aboratory  items.  Subject responses are 
summed over a 7 -day period and subsequent ly weighted, yielding a total sc ore range of 0 to 
600points with a score of <150 points defined as remissio n.  A score of 220 to 450 points 
indicates moderate to severe disease activit y, and a score of >450 points indicates severe disease 
activity.
Patient Reported Outcome 2 ( PRO2)is a 2-item index com prised of the SFand APi[INVESTIGATOR_129194].  The total PRO2 co mprises the average daily  scores over 7 days and isweighted using 
the CDAI mult iplication factors for SFand APi[INVESTIGATOR_129195].
For both of these items ( CDAI and PRO2 ), [ADDRESS_145782] -reported data withi n a 12-day 
period prior to a visit will be utilized to cal culate scores.  Data will be excluded fro m score 
calculation when co llected on day(s) of colonoscopy prep, day  of colonoscopy  procedure, and 
2daysafter colonoscopy  procedure.
9.1.6.Appropriateness of As sessments
The clinical safet y parameters in this study  are routine elements of clinical healt h assessment and 
Phase [ADDRESS_145783] ice and Crohn’s disease clinical t rials.
9.2.Health Outcomes/Quality of Life
Patient’s Global Rating of Severity (PGRS)(daily):  The PGRS is a 1-item patient-rated 
questionnaire designed to assess the subjects’ rating of their disease symptom severit y over the 
past 24 hours.  Responses are graded on a 6 -point scale in which a score of 1 indicates the 
subjecthas no symptoms (that is, “none”)and a score of [ADDRESS_145784]’s
symptom(s) are “very  severe.”
Patient’s Global Rating of Change (PGRC):  The PGRC scale is a patient -rated instrument 
designed to assess the subjects’ rating of change in their symptom(s) .  Responses are graded on a 
7-point Likert scale in which a score of [ADDRESS_145785]’s symptom(s) is “very much 
better,” a score of [ADDRESS_145786]’s symptom has experi enced “no change,” and a 
score of [ADDRESS_145787]’s symptom(s) is “very  much worse .”
Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ):  The IBDQ is a 32 -item 
patient-completed questi onnaire that m easures 4 aspects of subjects’ lives:  symptoms directly 
related to the primary  bowel disturbance, systemic symptoms, emotional funct ion, and social 
function.  Responses are graded on a 7- point Likert scale in which 7 denotes “not a problem at 
I6T-MC-AMAG(b) Clinical Protocol Page 53
LY3074828all” and 1 denotes “a very  severe probl em.” Scores range from 32 to 224; a higher score indicates 
a better qualit y of life.
Medical Outcomes 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36):  The SF-[ADDRESS_145788] ioning, role –physical, rol e–emotional, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, 
mental health, and general healt h.  The 2overarching domains of mental well- being and physical 
well-being are captured by  [CONTACT_129218] .  Responses are 
graded on Likert scales of varying lengths/po ints.  The summary scores range fro m 0 to 100; 
higher scores indicate better levels of funct ion and/or better healt h.
Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy –Fatigue(FACIT-Fatigue):  
FACIT-Fatigueis a 13-item instrument developed to m easure fat igue in chronic illness pat ients.  
It has been validated for use in IBD patients .  Total score ranges fro m0 to 52 based on a rating 
of 4-point Likert scale.
Bowel Movement Count (BMC) :  Due to the significant impact of SFon subjects’ lives, Lilly 
plans to measure and validate “stool frequency  in the past 24 hours” using an electronic daily 
diary approach .  Seven days of subject diary  data during a [ADDRESS_145789] 
be completed and assessed, excluding colonoscopy preparation day (s), day of the colonoscopy  
procedure, and 2daysafter colonoscopy  procedure .  In order to encourage consistent diary 
recording, subjectsshould enter daily diary data cont inuously throughout the study.
Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology– Self Report (16 Items) (QIDS -SR16):  The 
QIDS-SR16 is a self -administered, 16 -item instrument intended to assess the existence and 
severity of symptom s of depressio n as listed in the American Psychiatric Associat ion’s 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 4th Edition (DSM -IV) (APA 1994).  A 
subject is asked to consi der each statem ent as it relates to the way  they have felt for the past 7 
days.  There is a 4 -point scale for each item ranging fro m 0 to 3.  The 16 items corresponding to 
9 depression do mains are summed to give a single score ranging from 0 to 27, with hi gher scores 
denoting greater symptom severit y.  The dom ains assessed by  [CONTACT_57988]:  (1) sad 
mood, (2) concentration, (3) self -criticism, (4) suicidal ideat ion, (5) interest, (6) energy /fatigue, 
(7) sleep disturbance (init ial, middle, and late insomnia or hy persomnia), (8) decrease/increase in 
appetite/weight, and (9) psy chomotor agitation/retardati on.  Additional informat ion and the

the occurrence and nature of each subject’s preexisting condit ions, including clinically  
significant si gns and symptom s of the disease under treatment in the study .  In addition, site 
personnel will record any change in the condit ion(s) and any new condit ions as AEs. 
Investigators should record their assessment of the potential relatedness of each AE to protocol 
procedure, invest igational product, via eCRF. 
CCI
I6T-MC-AMAG(b) Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_145791] igator will interpret and document whe ther or not an AE has a reasonable possibilit y 
of being related to study  treatment, study  device, or a study  procedure, taki ng into account the 
disease, concomitant treatment or pathologies.
A “reasonable possibilit y” means that there is a cause and effect relationship between the 
investigat ional product, study  device and/or study  procedure and the AE.
The invest igator answers yes/no when making this assessment.
Planned surgeries and nonsurgical intervent ions should not be reported as AEs unless the 
underlying medical condit ion has worsened during the course of the study .
If a subject’s invest igational product is discont inued as a result of an AE, study  site personnel  
must report this to Lilly or its designee via eCRF, clarifying if possible, the circu mstances 
leading to any  dosage m odifications, or di scontinuati ons of treatment. 
9.3.1.Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any  AE from this study  that resul ts in one of the fo llowing outcom es:
death
initial or prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094]
a life-threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying)
persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacity
congenital ano maly/birth defect
important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129197].  Examples of such medical 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at hom e, blood dyscrasias or conv ulsions that do not resul t in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
Although all AEs occurring after signing the ICF are recorded in the eCRF, SAE reporting 
begins after the subject has signed the ICF and has recei ved invest igational product.  However, if 
an SAE occurs after signing the ICF, but prior to receiving invest igational product, it needs to be 
reported ONLY if it is considered reasonably possibly related to study  procedure.
Study site personnel  must alert Lilly or its designee of any SAE within [ADDRESS_145792] igator 
awareness o f the event via a sponsor -approved method.  If alerts are issued via telephone, they 
are to be immediately fo llowed with official notification on study-specific SAE forms.  This 
24-hour notificat ion requirement refers to the init ial SAE information and all fo llow-up SAE 
information.
Pregnancy (during maternal or paternal exposure to invest igational product) does not meet the 
definition of an AE.  However, to fulfill regulatory requ irements any pregnancy  should be 
reported fo llowing the SAE process to collect data on the outcome for both mother and fetus.
I6T-MC-AMAG(b) Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_145793] 
discontinued and/or completed the study  (the subject summary CRF has been completed).  
However, if the invest igator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has 
been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event reasonably  possibly related to the 
study treatment or study  participation, the invest igator must promptly notify Lilly .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions
Suspected unexpected serious adverse react ions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are serious events that are not listed 
in the IB and that the investigator ident ifies as related to investigational product or procedure.  
[LOCATION_002] 21 CFR 312.32 and European Unio n Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC and the 
associated detailed guidances or national regulatory  requirements in parti cipating countries 
require the rep orting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs.  Lilly  has procedures that will be followed for the recording 
and expedited reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs that are consistent with glo bal regulat ions and the associated 
detailed guidances.
9.3.2.Complaint Handling
Lilly collects product complaints on inv estigational products and drug delivery systems used in 
clinical studies in order to ensure the safet y of study participants, m onitor quality, and to 
facilitate process and product improvements.
Subject will be instructed to con tact the invest igator as soo n as possible if he or she has a 
complaint or probl em with the invest igational product so that the situation can be assessed.
9.4.Treatment of Overdose
In case of suspected overdose, hematology , chemistry , vital signs, and oxy gen saturati on should 
be monitoredand supportive care provided as necessary .  There is no known ant idote for 
LY3074828.  
9.5.Safety
9.5.1.Electrocardiograms
For each subject, ECGs should be collected according to the Schedule of Activit ies (Section2).  
Electrocardiograms should be recorded according to the study- specific reco mmendations 
included in the Schedule of Act ivities. 
Any clinically  significant findings from ECGs that result in a diagnosis and that occur after the 
subject receives the first dose of the invest igational treatment should be reported to Lilly or its 
designee as an AE via eCRF.
9.5.2.Vital Signs
For each subject, vital signs measurements should be conducted according to the Schedule o f 
Activities (Section 2).
I6T-MC-AMAG(b) Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_145794] ivities (Section 2). 
Any clinically  significant findings from laboratory tests that result in a diagnosis and that occur 
after the subject receives the first dose of invest igational product should be reported to Lilly or 
its designee as an AE via eCRF.
9.5.4.Other Tests
[IP_ADDRESS]. Chest Radiography and Tuberculosis Testing
Posterior-anterior view chest radiography (CXR) will be obtained at screening (Visit 1) (unless 
local standards dictate posterior–anterior and lateral views), unless the radiographs or medical 
report from chest radiography performed within 3 mo nths before init ial screening (per local 
standard of care for TB evaluat ion) are available to the investigator for review.  
In addition, subjects will be tested as indi cated in the Schedule of Activitiesfor evidence of 
active or latent TB.  A posit ive TB test result is indicated by a purified protein derivat ive ([COMPANY_003]) 
skin test response ≥[ADDRESS_145795] applicat ion (regardl ess 
of Bacillus Calmette -Guerin vaccinat ion history).  In countri es where the Quant iFERON-TB 
Gold test (or equivalent , for example, T-SPOT) is available and is preferred (in the judgment of 
the investigator) as an alternative to the [COMPANY_003] skin test for the evaluat ion of TB infection in a 
subject, that test may be used instead of the [COMPANY_003] test.  Retesting fo llowing a posi tive test is 
allowed in pat ients, who in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the investigator, are unlikely to be infected with 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis .  In this circumstance, [ADDRESS_145796] results within 3 months before init ial screening 
may not need to repeat TB testing at screen ing (Visit 1) based on judgment of the invest igator.  
Documentation of this previous test result must include a record of the size (in millimeters) of 
the induration response.  A [COMPANY_003] test recorded as “negat ive” without documenting the size of 
induration (i n millimeters) will not be acceptable and will require a retest.
However, subjects with a [COMPANY_003] skin test response ≥[ADDRESS_145797] ive TB may be

LY3074828after receiving at least [ADDRESS_145798] of care
no evidence of treatment hepatotoxicit y (ALT and AST levels must remain ≤2xULN) 
upon retes ting of serum ALT and AST levels before randomization)
Such subjects must continue and complete appropriate latent TB therapy during the course of the 
study to remain eligible and must con tinue to m eet all other inclusi on and exclusio n criteria for 
participation.  
Subjects who have a documented history  of completing an appropri ate TB prophylaxis regimen 
with no history  of re-exposure since their treatments were completed and no evidence of act ive 
TB are eligible to participate in the study; these subjects should not undergo [COMPANY_003] testing.  
Subjects who have had househo ld contact [CONTACT_4490] a person with active TB must be excluded unless 
appropriate and documented prophylaxis for TB has been given, as described above.
Subjects with any history  of activeTB are excl uded from  the study ,regardless of previous or 
current TB treatments.
9.5.5.Safety Monitoring 
Lilly will periodically  review evolving aggregate safet y data within the study  by [CONTACT_81132].
If a study  patient/subject experiences elevated ALT ≥3xULN, ALP ≥2xULN, or el evated TBL 
≥2xULN, clinical and laboratory  monitoring should be init iated by [CONTACT_3170].  Details for 
hepatic monitoring depend upon the severit y and persistence of observed laboratory  test 
abnormalities.  To ensure patient/subject safet y and comply with regulatory  guidance, the 
investigator is to consult with the Lilly CRP regarding collect ion of specific reco mmended 
clinical informat ion and follow-up laboratory  tests (seeAppendix 4 ).
Any enrolled subject who is HBcAb+ will undergo periodic mo nitoring of HBV 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) per the Schedule of Act ivities.
In addition to the above, any enrolled subject who is HBcAb+ or tests positive for hepatitis B 
surface ant ibody and who experiences an elevated ALT or AST level >3xULN must undergo 
HBV DNA testing.  If the HBV PCR test is negat ive, the invest igator should consult with the 
Lilly-designated m edical monitor regarding furt her management of the subject.  
If the result of any HBV PCR test is posit ive at any t ime, the subject must be discont inued from 
the study and shoul d receive appropri ate follow -up medical care, including considerat ion for 
antiviral therapy.  A specialist physician in the care of patients with hepatit is (for example, 
infectious disease or hepatologist subspecialists) should be consulted and potentially  start 
antiviral therapy.
In the event that safet y monitoring uncovers an issue that needs to be addressed by [CONTACT_129219], only members of the data monitoring board (an advisory  group for thi s study 
I6T-MC-AMAG(b) Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_145799] the integrity  of data; refer Section 10.3.7, Interim Analyses) can conduct 
additional analyses of the safet y data.
9.6.Pharmacokinetics
At the visits and times specified in the Schedule of Act ivities(Section 2), venous blood samples 
will be co llected to determine the serum concentratio ns of LY3074828.
A maximum of [ADDRESS_145800] visit for the s tudy.

LY307482810.Statistical Considerations
10.1.Sample Size Determination
Approximately  180 parti cipants will be randomized with a 2:1:1:2 allocat ionacross 4 treatment 
arms (1000, 600, 200 mg LY3074828, and placebo).
The primary  endpoint is Week 12 endoscopic response rate (as defined as a 50% reduction in 
SES-CD).  Based on 60 patients per comparison treatment arm and the assumed LY3074828 and 
placebo endoscopi c response rates of 35% and 15%, respectively, the test of the superiorit y 
versus placebo will have 81% power when performed via a chi- squared test at a 2-sided 0.1 
significance l evel.
Subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_129220]’s di seasetherapy use (yes/no).  The exact 
number enro lled in eit her group will be dependent upon the enro llment rate of the patient 
populations described below :
A minimum of approximately 30% of subjects will be naive to bio logic Crohn’s disease
therapy (including experimental bio logicCrohn’s di seasetherapy).
At least 50% of the subjects will be prior bio logic Crohn’s disease therapy-experienced 
(including experience with experimental bio logicCrohn’s disease therapy).
10.2.Populations for Analyses
For purposes of a nalysis, the following populat ions are defined:
Population Description
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) The ITT population is defined as all randomized patients, even if the subject 
does not take the assigned treatment, does not receive the correct treatment, or 
otherwise does not follow the protocol .  Subjects will be analyzed according to 
the treatment to which they were randomized.
Safety All randomized participants who take at least 1 dose of double -blind study  
treatment.  Participants will be included in the treatment group to which they 
were randomized.  
Additional subpopulations may be identified.  Full details would be provided in the study  
statistical analysis plan (SAP) .
10.3.Statistical Analyses
10.3.1.General Statistical Considerations
Statistical analysis o f this study  will be the responsibilit y of Lilly or i ts designee.  A detailed 
SAP describing the statist ical methodol ogies will be developed by  [CONTACT_3210] i ts designee.  
SAS (Version 9.[ADDRESS_145801] itute, Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]) wi ll be used for the statist ical 
analysis.
I6T-MC-AMAG(b) Clinical Protocol Page 63
LY3074828Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment 
ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the protocol.  Any other change to the data analysis 
methods described in the pro tocol, and the j ustification for making the change, will be described 
in the clinical study  report(CSR).  Additional exploratory analyses of the data will be conducted 
as deemed appropriate.
Continuous data will be summarized in terms of the mean, standard deviat ion, minimum, 
maximum, median, and number of observat ions.  Categorical data will be summarized as 
frequency  counts and percentages .  Unless otherwise specified, statist ical tests of treatm ent 
effects will be conducted using [ADDRESS_145802] ic 
regression analysis with treatment, geographic region and p rior biologic Crohn’s disease therapy 
use (yes/no) in the model .  The proportions and 90% confidence intervals (CI) will be reported.
Treatment comparisons of continuous efficacy and health outcome variables will be made using 
mixed effects for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis .  When the MMRM model is used, the 
model includes treatm ent, geographi c region, prior biologic Crohn’s disease therapy use, 
baseline value, visit, and the interactions of treatment -by-visit and baseline -by-visit as fixed 
factors.  The covariance structure to model the within -patient errors will be unstructured.  If the 
unstructured covariance matrix results in a lack of convergence, the heterogeneous Toeplitz 
covariance structure, followed by [CONTACT_129221] e structure will be 
used.  The Kenward -Roger method will be used to estimate the denominator degrees of freedom .  
Type III sum s of squares for the least- squares (LS) means will be used for the statist ical 
comparison; the 90% CIwill also be reported. 
Whennecessary , additional analyses of categorical efficacy variables may  be conducted to 
address sparse data or small sample sizes.  Additional sensit ivity analyses of cont inuous efficacy 
and health outcomes variables will be conducted using an analysis o f covariance (ANCOVA).
Full details o f these analyses including missing imputation methods and covariates will be 
provided in the SAP.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Analysis of Populations
Unless otherwise specified, efficacy and healt h outcomes analyses will be conducted on the 
intent-to-treat populat ion (ITT), as defined in S ection 10.2.
Unless otherwise specified, safet y analyses will be conducted on the safet y population, as 
defined in Section 10.2.
Additional subpopulations may be identified.  Full details would be provided in the SAP.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Missing Data Imputation 
Analysis of categorical efficacy and healt h outcome variables will be assessed using a 
non-responder imputation (NRI) method.  Subjects will be considered a non -responder for the 
analysis if they  do not m eet the response criteria or have missing response d ata at the analysis 
I6T-MC-AMAG(b) Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_145803] 1 postbaseline observation will also be defined 
as non-responders for the NRI analysis.
Full details o f the NRI methodology will be provi ded in the SAP .  Additional missing data 
imputation methodologies may be considered and will be fully detailed in the SAP.

10.3.4.Safety Analyses
The evaluation o f safety and tolerability of treatment with LY3074828 is a secondary endpoint of 
this trial. 
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_129229], ECGs, 
and vital signs (including body  weight). 
Duration of exposure to therapy  during the treatment periods will be calculated for each subject 
and summarized by [CONTACT_1570] .  AEs will be coded according to the Medical Dict ionary for 
Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA ) and summarized by  [CONTACT_9313] (SOC), preferred term
(PT), severity, and relationship to invest igational product. 
A TEAE i s defined as an event that first occurred or worsened in severit y after baseline.  The 
MedDRA Lowest Level Term (LLT) will be used in the treatm ent-emergent com putation.  
Treatment -related TEAEs are defined as events that are indicated by [CONTACT_129230].  If a subject reports the occurrence of a particular event more than 
once, the most se vere of those events will be included in the summary tables of TEAEs, and the 
most severe of the most related of those events will be included in the summary  tables of 
treatment-related events .  
TEAEs of interest may be presented. 
An overall summary o f AEs will be provided for the study .  This includes the number and 
percentage of subjects who experienced TEAE, TEAE by [CONTACT_41424] y, death, SAE, TEAE 
related to study  drug, discont inuations from the treatment due to an AE .  Treatment -emergent 
adverse eve nts (all, by [CONTACT_41424] y, and TEAEs possibly related to study  drug by [CONTACT_1275]), SAEs including deaths, AEs that lead to treatment discontinuation will be

I6T-MC-AMAG(b) Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_145804] resul ts, ECGs (when reported, see 
Section9.5.1), and vital sign measurements .  The parameters will be listed and summarized with 
standard descript ive statist ics.  Change fro m baseline will also be summarized by [CONTACT_129231].
Assessment of immunogenicit y with respect to safety will include co mparison of subjects who 
experience TEAEs of systemic allergy/hypersensit ivity and of inject ion-site reactions and who 
also develop treatment -emergent ant i-LY3074828 ant ibody positivity with subjects who 
experience the same t ypes of TEAEs b ut who remain treatment -emergent anti -LY3074828 
antibody negative.  Anti-LY3074828 ant ibody titers will also be evaluated in anti -LY3074828 
antibody positive subjects who experience these events.
Other safet y parameters, incl uding body  weight, will be descriptively summarized by [CONTACT_98540].  Further analyses may be performed comparing the treatment groups.
All safety analyses will be fully detailed in the SAP. 
10.3.5.Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses
Analyses of data will be performed using a nonline ar mixed-effect modeling (NONMEM) 
approach as implemented in NONMEM so ftware on a computer that meets or exceeds the 
minimum system requirements for this program .  It is possible that other validated equivalent 
software programs may be used if appropriate.   The versio n of any software used for the analysis 
will be documented.
Population PK analyses will be performed to characterize the PK of LY3074828.  These analyses 
will include model- based and graphical evaluat ions of the data.  Estimates of PK model 
parameters and covariate effects and corresponding 90% CIwill be reported.
Analyses of exposure -response relat ionships will be conducted using both exploratory  graphical  
approaches and mo del based approaches.  Exploratory  graphical analysis approaches for 
SES-CDmay consist of graphs showing the percentage of subjects whoachieve a 50% reduction 
at different percentiles ( for example, quartiles) of exposure of LY3074828 at Weeks 12 and 52. 
Measures of exposure may include populat ion PK estimated average concentrations (C ss,avg) or 
observed trough concentrations.  Model based analyses of SES- CD will ut ilize populat ion 
exposure-response models, where maximum effect ( Emax)or other model struc tures may be used 
to relate exposure to either the change in SES -CD score and/or the probabilit y of achieving a 
50% reduction in SES -CD score.  These models may  be used to evaluate subject factors that may 
impact the relat ionship between exposure and respo nse.  Longitudinal exposure -response models 
for CDAI scores or subco mponents of the CDAI score (PRO2, SF, AP) may be devel oped, which 
relate the time course and magnitude of LY3074828 exposure to the time course and magnitude 
of response.
I6T-MC-AMAG(b) Clinical Protocol Page 68
LY3074828Additional analyses may be conducted if they are deemed appropriate.  Further details on PK and 
PK/PD analyses will be provided in the PK/PD analysis plan.
10.3.6.Other Analyses
10.3.7.Interim Analyses
Planned interim analyses that may  occur before the primary  efficacy data l ock include: 
when efficacy  data from approximately 50% of subjects through Week 12 areavailable
when efficacy  data from approximately 50% of subjects through Week 52 areavailable.
The purpose of all interim analyses will be to support further development planning .  The study 
will not be stopped for fut ility or efficacy  and, as such, will not require an alpha penalt y. 
Changes to the timing and number of interim analyses may  occur.  Any changes to the planned 
analyses which occur prior to the primary endpoint analysis ( 100% of subjects through Week 12) 
will be fully captured in the SAP.  Addit ional analyses and snapshots of study  data occurri ng 
after the primary  endpoint data l ock may be performed after an adequate number of subjects 
have completed 52 weeks of treatment.   To minimize any bias being introduced into the analysis 
of the study , the SAP and PK/PD analysis plan will be approved before the efficacy interim 
analysis is init iated.  
A limited number of pre -identified individuals may gain access to the limited unbl inded data, as 
specified in the unblinding plan, prior to the interim or final database lock, in order to init iate the 
final populat ion PK/PD model development processes for interim or final analyses.  Informat ion 
that may unblind the study  during the analyses will not be reported to study  sites or blinded study  
team until the study  has been unblinded.
Unblinding details are specified in the unblinding plan sect ion of the SAP.
Interim assessments will be conducted by  a sponsor Assessment Committee comprised of a 
limited number of preident ified team members who do not have direct site contact [CONTACT_129232]/validation responsibilit ies.
Ongoing monitoring of safet y data (including AEs, SAEs, and selected laboratory  
measurements) will be continued throughout th e study using blinded data .  Details of the trial 
level safet y review (TLSR) are specified in the TLSR plan or a separate document.

best assessed by [CONTACT_129234] t reat a subject (that is, the 
planned treatment regimen) rather than the actual treatment given.  It has the consequence 
that subjects allocated to a treatment group should be followed up, assessed, and analyzed 
as members of that group irrespective of thei r compliance to the planned course of 
treatment.

Summary : A Phase 2, Multicenter, Randomized, 
Parallel-Arm, Placebo -Controlled Study  of LY3074828 in 
Subjects with A ctive Crohn’s Disease (SERENITY)
Overview
Protocol I6T-MC-AMAG(A Phase 2, Mult icenter, Rando mized, Parallel-Arm, 
Placebo-Controlled Study  of LY3074828 in Subjects with Active Crohn’s Disease
[SERENITY]) has been amended.  The new protocol is indicated by [CONTACT_61504] (b)and will be 
used to conduct the study  in place of any preceding versio n of the protoco l.
The overall changes and rationale for the changes made to this protocol are as follows:
Increased duration of all IV study  drug administratio n to 2 hours. The 2-hour duration 
provides a rate (at the highest dose in Study AMAG) that approximates the rate being 
used across other mirikizumab studies.
Addition of a 1-hour post infusio n observation period to allow adequate evaluat ion of 
potential hypersensit ivityor infusio n related reactions.
Added text on how to manage hypers ensitivity events, including guidance on the 
collection of addit ional immunogenicit y, PK, and hypersensit ivity markers samples
following a possible infusio n related hypersensit ivity event.  Sam ples will be used to 
evaluate for possible etio logies of hypersensitivity reactions.
Clarification added that patients who experience serious adverse react ions (anaphylaxis, 
systemic hypersensit ivity event) related to an infusio nare to have their invest igational 
product discont inued.
Clarification comments added to S chedule of Activitiesthat additional immunogenicit y, 
PK, and hypersensit ivity markers samples may  be collected in order to understand 
etiology of infusion related events
Correction in Schedule of ActivitiesthatV8 is to include Days 86-92, instead of Days 
85-92
Clarification comment added to Schedule of Activitiesthat colonoscopy /SES-CD is 
performed only at the early terminat ion visit if the visit occurs [ADDRESS_145809] dose of study  drug. The 
colonoscopy /SES-CD is not to be performed at Period 1, Period 3 or Visit 804.  
Replaced eligibility criteria of patients to proceed to Period [ADDRESS_145810] populat ion felt to be receiving benefit .
Clarification added that t he intent of the treatment regimens is to keep the dosing within 
the visit windows and as close to every  4 weeks as possible.
I6T-MC-AMAG(b) Clinical Protocol Page 86
LY3074828Appendix 6 added that provides addit ional information on systemic drug administration 
reactions.
Appendix 2 removed Treg/TH17 from list of tests because it is not being performed in 
the study and added hypersensit ivity markers.

[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Hypersensitivity Events ,Fever Associated Reactions, and
Infusion/Injection Site Reactions
During and after study  drug administrati on, patients shoul d be closely monitored for signs or 
symptoms of AEs, including hypersensit ivity events, other fever associated reactions and 
infusion or injection site reactions.
Systemic Hypersensitivity Events
If a patient experiences a systemic hypersensit ivity event invo lving the skin or mucous 
membranes, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] , cardiovascular, gastroi ntestinal, or urinary  systems, during or up to 
I6T-MC-AMAG(b) Clinical Protocol Page 91
LY30748286hours after an infusio n of study  drug, the fo llowing guidance shoul d be followed (see 
Appendix 6 foradditional information): 
Study drug infusio n should be stopped immediately  and appropri ate supportive care 
provided according to local standard practice (for example, administration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], 
anti-histamine, systemic steroids, and/or bronchodilators).
After the patient’s stabilizat ion, additional immunogeni city, PK, and hypersensit ivity 
markers samples should be co llected as fo llows:
oAs soon as possible a fter the event occurs
o4 weeks after the event
o12 weeks after the event 
The patient should cont inue to be monitored until reso lution or stabilization of the 
symptoms, as clinically  appropriate. 
Permanently discontinue the study drug after a systemic drug administration reaction.  
If the patient discont inues study  drug but remains in the study , management shoul d 
follow as outlined in Sect ion8.1.1, and immunogenicit y, PK, and hypersensit ivity 
markers should be collected at 4 and 12 weeks after the event.
If the patient di scontinues participat ion in the study, the pat ient should proceed to early 
termination procedures.  The patient will need to return after early terminat ion procedures 
for 4 and 12 week immunogenicit y, PK, and hypersensit ivity markers co llections.  
The medical monitor should be notified as soon as feasible.
Fever-Associated Reactions
If a patient experiences a fever -associated reaction consisting of headache, rigors and/or 
temperature >38°C (in the absence of signs or symptoms of a systemic hypersensit ivity event) 
during or up to 6 hours after an infusio n of study  drug, the fo llowing guidance shoul d be 
followed:
Study drug infusio n should be interrupted and appropriate medical care should be 
administered (for example, nonsteroidal ant i-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDS], anti -
pyretics or antihistamines).
Additional immunogenicit y, PK, and hypersensit ivity markers samples should be 
collected as fo llows:
oAs soon as possible after the event occurs
o4 weeks after the event
o12 weeks after the event 
Resumption of study drug infusio n after interruption, possibly  at a slower rate of 
administration, can be considered if symptoms resolve and it is deemed to be medically 
appropriate based on the invest igator’s discretion, and considering the risk/benefit of 
readminstration.
Patient should remain in observat ion, as is clinically appropriate for the patient’s 
symptoms.
Premedication prior to subsequent study  drug administrati on may be considered, if 
judged by  [CONTACT_129244].

collections.
If the patient develops systemic hypersensit ivity symptoms or signs, they should be 
managed as described above for a sy stemic hypersensit ivity event.
Infusion Site Reactions
If a patient experiences an infusio n site reaction, including urticaria, pruritus, or angioedema 
localized to the IV infusion site (in the absence of systemic hypersensit ivity signs or symptoms), 
during or up to 6 hours after an infusio n of study  drug, the fo llowing guidance shoul d be 
followed:
Study drug infusio n should be interrupted and appropriate medical care should be 
administered (for example, NSAIDS, ant i-pyretics or antihistamines).  
Additional immunogenicit y, PK, and hypersensit ivity markers samples should be 
collected as fo llows:
oAs soon as possible after the event occurs
o4 weeks after the event
o12 weeks after the event 
Resumption of study  drug infusio n after interru ption, possibly at a slower rate of 
administration, can be considered if symptoms resolve and it is deemed to be medically 
appropriate based on the invest igator’s discretion, and considering the risk/benefit of 
readminstration.
Patient should remain in obs ervation, as is clinically appropriate for the patient’s 
symptoms.
Premedication prior to subsequent study  drug administrati on may be considered, if 
judged by  [CONTACT_129214].
If the patient discont inues from the study early for any reason, they should return to 
complete 4 and 12 week follow -up immunogenicit y, PK, and hypersensit ivity markers 
collections.
If the patient develops systemic hypersensit ivity symptoms or signs, they should be 
managed as described abo ve for a systemic hypersensit ivity event.
Injection Site Reactions
If a patient experiences an inject ion site reaction, including pain, ery thema, urticaria, pruri tus, or 
angioedema localized to the SC injection site (in the absence of systemic hypersensit ivity signs 
or symptoms), the following guidance should be followed:
Patient should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_129215] s experienced 
following a SC inject ion. 
I6T-MC-AMAG(b) Clinical Protocol Page 93
LY3074828Premedication prior to subsequent study  drug administrati on may be cons idered as 
appropriate for the individual pat ient.
If the patient develops systemic hypersensit ivity symptoms, they should be managed as 
described above for a sy stemic hypersensit ivity event.
Because of the risk of an infusio n reaction wit h any biological agent, all subjects should be 
monitored according to local standard of care.  Symptoms and signs that may occur as part of an 
infusion reaction include but are not limited to fever, chill, nau sea, headache, bronchospasm, 
hypotension, angioedema, throat irritation, rash, pruritus, myalgia, and/or dizziness.  In the event 
that a significant infusion reaction occurs, the fo llowing guidance should be fo llowed:  
the investigational product infusion should be slowed or stopped, depending on the 
symptoms or signs present:
osupportive care should be emplo yed in accordance with the symptoms or signs
oif slowed or stopped, the infusio n may be continued in accordance with signs and 
symptoms at the invest igator’s discretion.
All biological agents carry  the risk of an inject ion site and/or hy persensitivity general react ion.  
Therefore, all subjects should be closely mo nitored for si gns or symptom s that coul d result from 
such reactions.  Sites should have appro priately trained medical  staff and appropri ate medical  
equipment available when subjects are receiving study  drug.  If a subject experiences an acute 
hypersensit ivity reaction after an inject ion of study drug, he or she should receive appropriate 
supportiv e care and consideration for any  premedicati on; future injecti ons will be agreed upon 
between the invest igator and sponsor.
8.1.1 Permanent Discontinuation from Study Treatment
Subjects m ay discontinue treatm ent for any of the reasons noted above, or for other reasons such 
as the development of a serious adverse event. To better communicate patient flow throughout 
the study, different study  period situations are provided below:
Subjects who discont inue the investigational product in Period 1 or Period 2 ma y
continue in the study  according to the visit schedule (Section 2).
At Week 52/Visit 18, s ubjects who have previously discontinuedthe investigatio nal 
product will continue to Visit 801 of the Follow -up Period.
Subjects who discont inue the investigational product in Period 3 may continue in Period 
3 and then proceed to Week 104/Vi sit [ADDRESS_145815] is to be disco ntinued for patients who experience clinically significant 
systemic hypersensit ivity events (such as anaphylaxis) following administratio n of 
investigat ional product .

Study Objectives:  
Primary Objective s: 
 To compare the e fficacy and duration of analgesia achieved following periarticular  infiltration of HTX -011 with 
that of saline placebo in subjects undergoing unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA).  
Secondary Objectives:  
 To compare the efficacy and duration of analgesia for HTX -011 with that of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39850].  
 To evaluate additional efficacy parameters , including opi[INVESTIGATOR_39851],  in this study population.  
 To evaluate the efficacy and duration of analgesia for HTX -011 administered using different techniques in this 
study population.  
 To characterize the bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39852] (PK) profile s following administration of  
HTX -011 in this study population.  
 To assess the safety and tolerability of HTX -011 in this study p opulation.  
Methodology : This is a Phase  2b, randomized, double -blind, saline placebo - and active -controlled, multicenter 
study in subjects undergoing primary unilateral TKA.  Cohort 1 will evaluate HTX -011 administered into the 
surgical site via different techniques compared with saline placebo and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39853] 2 . If a decision is made to proceed to Cohort 2, HTX -011 will be evaluated compared with saline 
placebo and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39854] R eview 
Committee  (IRC) . 
All s ubjects will be screened within 21 days prior to surgery . Subjects who meet the Screening eligibility criteria 
will be randomiz ed. Randomization may be done up to 1 business day prior to the day of surgery . On the day of 
surgery (Day  0), subjects who continue to meet the eligibility criteria will undergo primary unilateral TKA under 
general anesthesia .  
Just b efore being taken to the operating room prior to the start of surgery, each subject in Cohort 2 will be 
administered pregabalin orally (PO; 150 mg) and acetaminophen intravenously (IV ; no more than 1  g [1000  mg] in a 
6-hour window , as per the approved prescribing information ) to reduce initial  postoperative pain.  
In the study, a single dose of study drug (HTX -011 with or without  ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39855], or saline placebo) will be administered intraoperatively by [CONTACT_39954] ( eg, 
periarticular  instillation , periarticular  injection, or a combination of periarticular  injection and instillation ). 
Specifically i n Cohort 2, HTX -011 will be administered via periarticular instillation with or without ropi[INVESTIGATOR_39856] . 
During surgery, the use of fentanyl up to 4 μg/kg will be permitted for intraoperative pain control. Just prior to the 
end of the surgery, all subjects will receive an additional [ADDRESS_41616] of fentanyl o n postoperative care (for example , the maximu m total amount of fentanyl used during surgery 
for a [ADDRESS_41617] should not exceed 355 µg [4 μg/kg × 70 kg = 280 μg for intraoperative pain control + 75  μg at 
the end of the case = 355 μg total] ).  
Following s urgery and immediate postoperative recovery, subjects will be transferred to the postanesthesia care unit 
(PACU) . Subjects will remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] /research facility  for a minimum of 72  hours after study drug

1 postoperative pain score assessed, then a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score at rest (NRS -R) followed by a 
Numeric Rating Scale score with activity (NRS -A) pain score must be obtained.  
Postoperative rescue medication will consist of IV morphine and/or PO immediate -release oxycodone. For the first 
[ADDRESS_41620] may also receive up to 10 mg of PO 
immediate -release oxycodone  within any 4 -hour period , as needed , from after study drug administration thr ough 
72 hours . No other analgesic agents  are permitted during the 72 -hour postoperative observation period (except as 
specified by [CONTACT_760] ; see below).  
After [ADDRESS_41621] if they take an opi[INVESTIGATOR_39857] 72 hours and Day 28.  
Required Antifibrinolysis  and Deep Vein Thrombosis ( DVT ) Prophylaxis  
All subjects are required to receive tranexamic acid ( TXA ) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) during the study. TXA 1g 
IV will be administered prior to the start of surgery and a second dose will be administered  up to approximately 
8 hours later. For the time period after study drug administration until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], subjects should receive 
ASA 325 mg PO twice a day ; surgeons may also use additional DVT prophylaxis as per their standard of care.  
Use of Other Analgesics  
With the exception of preoperative administration of PO pregabalin  and IV acetaminophen  (in Cohort 2 only) , 
intraoperative adm inistration of study drug  (including ropi[INVESTIGATOR_39858] 1 arm in Cohort 2)  and fentanyl, 
protocol -specified postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_39859], and ASA for DVT prophylaxis , no other analgesic 
agents, including ketamine and nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are permitted from the time the 
subject signs  the informed consent form ( ICF) through 72  hours  after study drug administration , except under the 
following circumstances: to treat an adverse event (AE), for pretreatment prior to  needle placement, or to decrease 
venous irritation caused by [CONTACT_39955] (in which case, no more than a single administration of lidocaine 1% 20  mg IV 
may be administered). Nerve block may also not be used as a form of analgesia on Day [ADDRESS_41622] 80% of the planned 
number of subjects in Cohort [ADDRESS_41623] all of their pain intensity and opi[INVESTIGATOR_39860] 72 -hour postoperative 
assessments entered into electronic clinical database.  The IRC will operate under a written, detailed IRC Charter . 
There will be no interim analyses on data collected during Cohort 2.  
Treatment Cohorts  
The study will include 2 cohorts.

Efficacy Analyses:  
Cohorts [ADDRESS_41637] each control arm. In Cohort 2, the following treatment comparisons will be performed in a 
hierarchical order for the primary and key secondary endpoint s: 
1. Mean AUC 0-48 of the NRS -R pain intensity scores for HTX -011 400 mg /12 mg  (13.7 mL) via periarticular 
instillation and ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 50 mg via periarticular injection vs. saline placebo . 
2. Mean AUC 0-48 of the NRS -R pain intensity scores for HTX -011 400 mg /12 mg  (13.7 mL) via periarticular 
instillation vs. saline placebo . 
3. Mean AUC 0-72 of the NRS -R pain intensity scores for HTX -011 400 mg /12 mg  (13.7 mL) via periarticular 
instillation and ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 50 mg via periarticular injection vs. saline placebo . 
4. Mean AUC 0-72 of the NRS -R pain intensity scores for HTX -011 400 mg /12 mg  (13.7 mL) via periarticular 
instillation vs.  saline  placebo . 
In order to account for multiple treatment comparisons on the primary and key secondary endpoint s in Cohort 2, a 
strict testing hierarchy will be applied to control study -wise alpha level at 0.05. If the first treatment comparison is 
statisticall y significant (p≤0.05), then the second  treatment comparison will be tested. If the second  treatment 
comparison is statistically significant, then the third  treatment comparison will be tested. Sequential testing will 
continue in this manner down the hiera rchical order until a treatment comparison fails to meet statistical 
significance, after which all subsequent treatment comparisons will be considered exploratory.   
The primary endpoint of mean AUC 0-48 of the NRS -R pain intensity scores will be analyzed using an analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) model with treatment as th e main effect. Results will be expressed as mean AUCs and standard 
deviations  (SDs), least -squares mean differences and standard errors (SEs) with assoc iated 95% co nfidence intervals 
(CIs), and p -values. Other continuous efficacy endpoints will be analyzed similarly to the primary endpoint.  
Categorical endpoints will be analyzed using Fisher’s exact test. Results will be expressed as the number and 
percen tage of subjects meeting the relevant endpoint, differences in proportions with 95% CIs, and p -values.

Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Background Information  and Study Rationale  
It is estimated that up to 80% of patients suffer from moderate to severe  pain during the first 
24 to 48  hours after surgery  (Gan, 2014 ). Conseque ntly, many are given narcotic analgesics for 
pain management . Administering a local anesthetic is a relatively simple and safe means of 
providing postoperative pain relief and promoting a quicker recovery; however, a major 
limitation of local anesthetics i s their short duration of effect (6  to 12  hours following surgery) 
(Kehlet, 2011 ). The development of an extended -releas e local anesthetic that would provide pain 
relief during this critical postoperative  timeframe and reduce the need for narcotics would be of 
clinical significance .  
Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) have long been used in the treatment of 
posto perative pain (Moote, 1992 ), and there is evidence that there may be a synergistic 
interaction between local anesthetics and NSAIDs when locally administered together (Ortiz, 
2011 ). 
Heron is developi[INVESTIGATOR_39880] -[ADDRESS_41659] that contains bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] ( a local anesthetic as 
the free base) and low -dose meloxicam (an NSAID ) incorporate d in a bioerodible polymer 
(termed Biochronomer) . When HTX -011 is administered, the polymer undergoes controlled 
hydrolysis  in the tissue  resulting in the extended release of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39881] . The 
extended release is achieved using a proprietary v ehicle formulation consisting of the novel 
tri[ethylene glycol] -based poly[orthoester] polymer (AP135) in combination with different 
excipi[INVESTIGATOR_39882] (dimethyl sulfoxide, glycerol triacetate [ triacetin], and maleic 
acid) . 
This is a Phase  2b, randomized, double -blind, saline placebo - and active -controlled, multicenter 
study in subjects undergoing primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to evaluate the 
analgesic efficacy, safety, a nd pharmacokinetics (PK) of HTX -011 administered via infiltration  
to the surgical site . Cohort 1 will evaluate HTX -011 administered into the surgical site via 
different techniques compared with saline placebo and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39853] 2 . If a decision is made to proceed  to Cohort 2 , HTX -011 will be evaluated 
compared with saline placebo and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39883] R eview Committee  (IRC) . 
1.2. Rationale for Study Design, Doses, and Control Groups  
TKA is an accept ed model of postoperative pain . TKA produces generally reliable and persistent 
pain symptoms for a p eriod typi[INVESTIGATOR_39884] [ADDRESS_41660] s on bone healing , supporting the appropriateness  
of TKA as a model  for clinical evaluation . The compatibility of HTX -011 with polymethyl 
methacrylate (PMMA) bone cement was also studied (Simplex® HV with Genta micin from 
Stryker  and Palacos® R from Zimmer). A range of tests were performed on cylinders of both 
types of cement exposed to HTX -[ADDRESS_41661] that HTX -011 had on cured

by [CONTACT_39961] , and  identification and quantification of leachable  
component s. Based on the results of this study, the mechanical properties of PMMA bone 
cement are not affected by [CONTACT_39962] -011. Th e compressive strength, surface hardness, and molecular 
weight of PMMA bone cement were not changed by [CONTACT_39963] -011. The only 
leachables observed were components from the bone cement known to leach into interstitial fluid 
in vivo.  Consistent wit h published studies, these compounds were observed at 
microgram/ milliliter  concentrations; concentrations that are well below levels that would present 
a toxicity concern. Therefore, HTX -[ADDRESS_41662] the mechanical properties of bone 
cement provid ed it is administered as described in Section 5.5, avoiding placement of the drug 
between the bone, the implant, and the cement where it could pote ntially interfere with the 
space -filling properties of the cement.  
Wound infiltration is an effective method of pain management in TKA, and the technique for 
administration is described and reviewed in multiple articles  (Busch, 2006 ; Essving, 2010 ; Affas, 
2011 ; Surdam, 2015 ). In this study, HTX -011 will be administered via infiltration  to the surgical 
site (eg, periarticular  instillation , periarticular  injection, or a combination of periarticular  
injection and instillation ) to compare different administration techniques . In Cohort 2, HTX -011 
will be administered  with or without ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] . Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39885] , respectively, for efficacy and 
safety evaluations .  
Single dose s of HTX -011 up to  400 mg/12 mg , inclusive  (based on bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39886]) , will be 
evaluated in the study . Doses up to 600  mg/[ADDRESS_41663]  been evaluated in previous HTX -011 
clinical studies . A Phase  1, saline placebo -controlled study evaluated si ngle doses of 
100 mg/3  mg, 200 mg/6 mg , and 400  mg/12 mg  of HTX -011 administered to healthy volunteers 
via subcutaneous (SC) injection . All doses w ere well tolerated, and t herapeutically relevant 
plasma bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39887] 2  to 3 days in the absence of the large initial peak 
observed with commercially  available formulations of the drug  (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974]) . The analgesic 
effects of HTX -011 persi sted through 96  hours, which closely correlated with plasma 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39888] . HTX -011 d oses up to 600  mg/[ADDRESS_41664] also been administered  in 
concluded and ongoing Phase  2 studies ; current data show that they  have been  generally well

The 28-day duration of postoperative assessments is considered appropriate for determining the 
acute analgesic effect -time curve, safety, and PK profiles for HTX -011. 
One interim analys is is planned for Cohort [ADDRESS_41665] 80% of the planned number of subjects in Cohort [ADDRESS_41666] all of 
their pain intensity and opi[INVESTIGATOR_39860] 72 -hour postoperative  assessments entered

postanesthesia care unit (PACU), the Inv estigator and all staff involved in efficacy and safety 
assessments will be blinded to treatment assignments until after database lock . 
As a postoperative pain study, the primary efficacy endpoint is the area under the curve (AUC) 
of Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain intensity scores with activity  (NRS -A) from the sta rt of 
study drug administration  through 72 hours . Secondary efficacy endpoints  will be assessed 
through 72  hours  and beyond  and include assessments of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], including the time to firs t 
use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_39890], as recommended by [CONTACT_39964] ( FDA ) 
guidelines  (FDA Draft Guidance for Indust ry, Analgesic Indications: Developi[INVESTIGATOR_39891] [February 2014 ]). 
1.3. Potential Risks and Benefits  
As of the [ADDRESS_41669] been treated in 9  completed, concluded, 
or ongoing studies in the HTX -011 clinical development program. This includes two Phase 1 
studies in healthy volunteers and six  Phase 2 and one Phase 3 studie s in subjects undergoing 
elective surgery (bunionectomy, herniorrhaphy, abdominoplasty, TKA, and augmentation 
mammoplasty). Three studies are ongoing and remain blinded (Studies 209, 211, and 302). An 
estimated [ADDRESS_41670] received a single dose of H TX-011 at doses ranging from 
30 mg/0.9  mg to 600  mg/18  mg. HTX -011 was administered via SC injection (10  subjects), local 
administration into the surgical site (an estimated 541  subjects), or nerve block (an estimated 
61 subjects). An additional 265  subjec ts received an earlier formulation: HTX -011-19 
(158 subjects ) or HTX -011-49 (107 subjects).  
Study 102  was a Phase 1 study that evaluated a single dose of HTX -011 400  mg/[ADDRESS_41671] common treatment -emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) were administration site reactions including bruising, pain, warmth, 
erythema, nodule, and swelling. Study 02 was a Phase 1 study that evaluated 2 earlier 
formulations, HTX -011-19 and HTX -011-49, in healthy volunteers. Subj ects received a single 
SC dose of 1 of these formulations at doses ranging from 100  mg/3  mg to 400 mg/[ADDRESS_41672] common TEAEs were contusion and erythema at the site of 
administration. All TEAEs in both Phase 1 studies were mild in  severity and all resolved. No 
serious adverse events (SAEs)  were reported in either study.  
HTX -011 has been evaluated in Phase 2a clinical studies in nonvisceral and visceral surgical 
models.  In Phase 2a bunionectomy, herniorrhaphy, and abdominoplasty stu dies, subjects 
undergoing surgery received a single dose of HTX -011 ranging from 30 mg/0.9  mg to 
600 mg/18  mg. HTX -011 was administered via local administration into the surgical site 
(injection [with or without a Mayo block], instillation [with or without  a Luer -lock applicator], or 
Protocol No: HTX -011-209 Page 25 of 87 
Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  a combination of injection and instillation). HTX -[ADDRESS_41673] common TEAEs in the HTX -011-treatment groups were nausea, vomiting, and headache 
for bunionectomy; constipation, nausea, and headache for herniorrhaphy; and nausea, 
constipation, and headache for abdominoplasty. Two serious adverse reactions ( SARs ; SAEs 
considered related to study d rug by [CONTACT_11219]/or the Sponsor)  were reported in subjects 
who received HTX -011. In the bunionectomy study, [ADDRESS_41674] who received HTX -011 200 mg/[ADDRESS_41675] who received HTX -011 300 mg/[ADDRESS_41676] events were self -limiting, mild or moderate in severity, and resolved 
without intervention or sequelae . 
Potential risks for bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39892] -related cardiovascular (CV) and central nervous 
system  toxicity  (MARCAINE USPI, 2011 ; MARCAIN SmPC, 201 6). Close attention should be 
given to conditions that may represent reported toxicities associated with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39893], 
but not limited to, perioral tingling, metallic  taste, visual and auditory disturbances, muscle 
twitching, seizure, acidosis,  shortness of brea th, bradycardia (heart rate <50  beats per minute 
with symptoms), hypotension ( systolic blood pressure <90  mmHg or symptomatic decrease from 
baseline), low oxygen saturation (≤90% for ≥1  minute), and cardiac arrest.  
Potential risks for mel oxicam include CV adverse reactions , gastrointestinal bleeding , and liver 
tests elevations  (MOBIC SmPC, 2015 ; MOBIC Tablets USPI, 2016 ). NSAIDs may cause an 
increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be 
fatal, and this risk may increase with duration of use. Patients with CV disease or risk factors for 
CV disease may be at greater risk . NSAI Ds may also cause an increased risk of serious 
gastrointestinal AEs including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, 
which can be fatal . Elderly patients are at greater risk for serious gastrointestinal events . 
Borderline eleva tions of 1  or more liver tests may occur in patients taking NSAIDs, including 
meloxicam, which may worsen. A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver 
dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver function test has occurred, should be evaluated for 
evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction . It is unclear how applicable these 
potential risks are for meloxicam when giv en as a single dose via local administration (a novel 
administration method for meloxicam) for postoperative pain as part of a f ixed-ratio combination 
(eg, HTX -011). 
Potential risks for ropi[INVESTIGATOR_39894] y 
(Naropin USPI, 2012 ; Naropin SmPC, 2017 ). Close attention should be given to conditions that 
may represent reported toxicities associated with ropi[INVESTIGATOR_39893], but not limited to, 
perioral tingling, metallic taste, visual and auditory disturbances, muscle twitching, s eizure, 
acidosis, shortness of breath, bradycardia (heart rate <50 beats per minute with symptoms), 
hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90  mmHg or symptomatic decrease from baseline), low

administration may result in cardiac arrhythmia and cardiac arrest.  
Use of HTX -[ADDRESS_41677] with HTX -011 extended longer than 24  hours: over 72 hours in 
bunionectomy, over 48  hours in herniorrhaphy, and over 96 hours in complete abdominoplasty.  
The reduction in pain translated into an increase in the number  of subjects who did not require 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. In bunionectomy, 3 times the number of HTX -011 60 mg/1.8 mg -treated subjects were 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_39895] 24  hours following surgery compared with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] (26.9% vs. 8.0%) and by 
72 hours, 17.3% of HTX -011 60 mg/1.8 mg  -treated subjects remained opi[INVESTIGATOR_39895]. In 
herniorrhaphy, half (50%) of HTX -011 300 mg/9 mg -treated subjects were opi[INVESTIGATOR_39895] 72 hours 
following surgery compared with 11.8% for bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974]. In both studies, all subjects who 
were opi[INVESTIGATOR_39896] 48  hours remained opi[INVESTIGATOR_39897] 96 hours. In addition to 
increasing the proportion of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -free subjects, HTX -011 reduced total opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]. In 
bunionectomy, HTX -011 60 mg/1.8 mg significantly reduced total opi[INVESTIGATOR_39898] 
72 hours compared with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] (approximately 30% lower). Similar findings were 
noted in abdominoplasty. In herniorrhaphy, the median values for total opi[INVESTIGATOR_39899] 72 hours for HTX -011 compared with b upi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] (2.5  mg vs. 1 5.0 mg).

Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN AND ENDPOINTS  
3.1. Description of the Study Design  
3.1.1.  Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase  2b, randomized, double -blind, saline placebo - and active -controlled, multicenter 
study to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, safety, and PK of HTX -011 administered via infiltration  
to the surgical site in subjects undergoing primary unilateral TKA . 
All s ubjects will be screened within 21 days prior to surgery . Subjects who meet the S creening 
eligibility criteria will be randomized . Randomization may be done up to 1 business day prior to 
the day of surgery . On the day of surgery (Day  0), subjects who continue to meet the eligibility 
criteria will continue on study and will undergo primary unilateral TKA under general 
anesthesia .  
Just b efore being taken to  the operating room prior to the start of the surgery, subject s in Cohort 
2 will be administered pregabalin orally (PO; 150 mg) and acetaminophen  intravenously (IV ; no 
more than 1 g [1000  mg] in a 6 -hour window , as per the approved prescribing information ) to 
reduce initial  postoperative pain.  Although not indicated for postoperative pain (Lyrica USPI, 
2009 ), pregabalin is used in clinical studies as multimodal perioperative analgesia (Buvanendran, 
2010 ; Li, 2017 ). Pregabalin was included in a Phase 4 study PI[INVESTIGATOR_39902] (Mont, 2017 ). For this use, pregabalin is administered PO before surgery at 
dose l evels up to 300 mg.  
A single dose of study drug (HTX -011 with or without  ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39903] , or saline placebo) will be administered intraoperatively by [CONTACT_39965] ( eg, periarticular  instillation , periarticular  injection, or a combination of periarticular  
injection and instillation ) as described in Section  5.5. Specifically in Cohort 2, HTX -011 will be 
administered via periarticular instillation with or without ropi[INVESTIGATOR_39904].  
During surgery, the use of fentanyl up to 4 μg/kg will be permitted for intraoperative pain 
control. Just prior to the end of the surgery , all subjects  will receive an additional [ADDRESS_41678] of fentanyl on postoperative care (for 
example , the maximum amount of fenta nyl used during surgery for a [ADDRESS_41679] should not 
exceed 355 µg [4 μg/kg × 70 kg = 280 μg for intraoperative pain control + 75 μg at the end of the 
case = 355 μg total] ). Following surgery and immediate postoperative recovery, subjects will be 
transferred to the PACU . Subjects will remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] /research facility  for a minimum of 
[ADDRESS_41680] 80% of the planned number of subjects in Cohort  [ADDRESS_41681] all of their pain 
intensity and opi[INVESTIGATOR_39860] 72 -hour postoperative assessments entered into

will be no interim analyses on data collected during Cohort 2.  
3.1.2.  Treatment Groups  
The study will include 2 cohorts.  
Cohort 1  
Approximately  60 subjects will be randomized to 1 of the following 4 treatment groups  in a 
2:2:1:1 ratio:  
 HTX -011 200  mg/6 mg  (6.8 mL) via periarticular  instillation into the surgical site 
(20 subjects)  
 HTX -011 200  mg/6 mg  (6.8 mL) via a combi nation of periarticular  inject ion and instillation 
into the surgical site ( 20 subjects)  
 Saline placebo ( 6.8 mL) via periarticular  injec tion into the surgical site (10  subjects)  
 Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39861] 0.25% ( 125 mg, 50 mL) via periarticular  injection into 
the surgical site (10 subjects)  
Cohort  2 
Cohort 2 was planned as an optional cohort. Following a review of the results from Cohort 1, the 
IRC recommended initiating enrollment in Cohort 2 with a  single dose level of HTX -011 
400 mg/12 mg (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]/meloxicam doses; 13.7 mL) in each H TX-011 treatment group.  
Approximately  200 subjects will be randomized to 1  of the following 4 treatment groups  in a 
1:1:1:1 ratio :  
 HTX -011 400 mg/12 mg (13.7 mL)  via periarticular  instillation into the surgical site 
(50 subjects)  
 HTX -011 400 mg/12 mg (13.7 mL)  via periarticular  instillation into the surgical site  and 
ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.5% (50 mg, 10 mL) via periarticular injection into the surgical site  (posterior 
capsule)  (50 subjects)  
 Saline placebo ( 13.7 mL) via periarticular  injection into the surgical site ( 50 subjects)  
 Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39861] 0.25% ( 125 mg, 50 mL) via periarticular  injection into 
the surgical site ( 50 subjects)  
3.1.3.  Postoperative Opi[INVESTIGATOR_39905], as needed , during 
the [ADDRESS_41682] ( NRS -R) followed by a Numeric Rating Scale score with 
activity ( NRS -A) pain score must be obtained.  
Protocol No: HTX -011-[ADDRESS_41683] of IV mor phine and/or PO immediate -release  
oxycodone . For the first [ADDRESS_41684] may also rec eive up to 10 mg of PO immediate -release oxycodone  within 
any 4-hour period as needed , from after study drug administration through 72  hours . No other 
analgesic agents are permit ted during the 72 -hour postoperative observation period  (except as 
specified by [CONTACT_760] ; see Section 3.1.5 ).  
After [ADDRESS_41685] if 
they take an opi[INVESTIGATOR_39857] 72 hours and Day 28.  
3.1.4.  Required Antifibrinolysis and Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Prophylaxis  
All subjects are required to tranexamic acid (TXA) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) during the 
study.  TXA 1 g IV will be administered prior to the start of surgery and a second dose will be 
administered up to approximately 8 hours later. For the time period after study drug 
administration until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], subjects should receive ASA 325  mg PO twi ce a day ; 
surgeons may also use additional DVT prophylaxis as per their standard of care.  
3.1.5.  Use of Other Analgesics  
With the exception of preoperative administration of pregabalin  and acetaminophen  (in Cohort 2 
only) , intraoperative administration of study drug (including ropi[INVESTIGATOR_39858] 1 arm in Cohort 2 ) 
and fentanyl, protocol -specified opi[INVESTIGATOR_39859], and ASA for DVT prophylaxis , no 
other analgesic agents, including ketamine and NSAIDs, are permitted from the time the subject 
signs the informed consent form (ICF) through 72  hours after study drug administration, except 
under the following circumstances: to treat an adverse event ( AE), for pretreatment prior to 
needle placement, or to decrease venous irritation caused by [CONTACT_39955] (in which case, n o more 
than a single administration of lidocaine 1% 20  mg IV may be administered). Nerve block may 
also not be used as a form of analgesia on Day [ADDRESS_41686] 72  hours after study drug 
administration.  
3.1.6.  Postoperative Assessments  
Efficacy assessments wi ll include pain intensity scores using the NRS -R (either seated 
comfortably or lying down) and the NRS -A (straight leg raise of the surgical leg  while the 
subject is lying down  or seated in a recliner [ recumbent ]); use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_39906] ; 
Patient Global Assessment  (PGA ) of pain control; assessments of  rehabilitation, ambulation,  and 
discharge readiness ; the subject’s satisfaction with postoperative pain control ; and the subject’s 
assessment of overall benefit of analgesia . 
Safety assessments will i nclude AE recording , physical examinations, vital signs, 
electrocardiograms ( ECGs ), motor function assessment s (timed 20-meter walk test) , hematology 
and serum chemistry, and wound healing assessment s. Holter monitoring will also be assessed.

Investigator and all site staff involved in safety and efficacy assessments will be blinded to the 
treatment assignment until after database lock . The Sponsor’s study team will also be blinded to 
the treatment assignments with the exception of the clinical trial material (CTM) staff, Clinical 
Research Specialists (observers in surgery), the bioanalytical staff,  Population PK modeling 
staff, and the u nblinded statistician who will perform the randomization and interim analysis data 
review, but will otherwise be uninvolved in the conduct of the study.  
An internal IRC will be unblinded during the interim review of the summary -level efficacy, 
safety, and PK data  from  Cohort [ADDRESS_41697] requires knowledge of the study drug he/she received . An attempt 
should be made to contact [CONTACT_39967]. If the Sponsor cannot be 
reached and the blind is broken by [CONTACT_737],  the reason for unblinding must be 
documented and the Sponsor must be contact[CONTACT_11252] [ADDRESS_41698] ( IP) and that potentially require 
expedited reporting to regulatory authorities . 
All circumstances leading to the premature unblinding must be clearly documented.

Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential   Combination (both periarticular injection and instillation)  
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39913]. 
However,  note the following  difference in volume : 
 The volume of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] (0.25% w ithout epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) is 50 mL  
 The volume of saline placebo will vary depending on the cohor t 
[IP_ADDRESS].  HTX -011 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Periarticular Instillation  
The total volume of HTX -[ADDRESS_41700] topi[INVESTIGATOR_39914] -011. This 
will be done using syringes with a Luer-lock applicator (without a needle).  To avoid study drug 
interference with the properties of polymethylmethacrylate bone cement, care should be taken to 
avoid contact [CONTACT_39970].  
HTX -011 will be instilled as follows: half (½) the volume onto the posterior capsule, a qu arter 
(¼) to the anteromedial tissues and periosteum, and a quarter (¼) to the anterolateral tissues and 
periosteum. Study drug should be prepared in 4 syringes, each containing equal volumes of study 
drug. The goal of this method of application is even di stribution of the drug throughout the entire 
joint lining containing sensory nerve fibers including capsule, synovium, and periosteum.  
1. Posterior Capsular Administration  
a. Drug instillation to the posterior capsule is performed after cementation of the 
components and placement of the tibial tray/spacer. It is expected that irrigation and 
suction will be complete before study drug administration. The surgeon may utilize 
pulsatile lavage and irrigate as desired after cementation and placement of all 
compon ents, but not after instillation of the study drug.  
b. The posterior capsular instillation will take place in 3 areas: the posterior medial 
capsule, the posterior lateral capsule and the central posterior capsule. For ideal 
posterior capsular placement, it is  recommended the knee be placed at approximately 
[ADDRESS_41701] a few 
millimeters if needed  to better access the central posterior capsule  and/or retract the 
relevant capsular tissues as need ed.  
c. The first syringe with the Luer -lock applicator is inserted full -length behind the 
medial condyle, between the condyle and the medial capsule to reach the posterior 
capsule as far proximal and as deep as possible (flexion, slight forward translation , 
and retraction all help to attain this goal). Instill the first half of the syringe with the 
Luer -lock applicator in this area.  
Protocol No: HTX -011-[ADDRESS_41702] syringe with the Luer -lock applicator is 
inserted full -length behind the lateral cond yle between the condyle and the lateral 
capsule to reach the posterior capsule as far proximal and as deep as possible (again 
flexion, slight forward translation , and retraction all help attain this goal). The 
Luer -lock applicator may be placed either abov e or below the popliteus tendon to 
reach the posterior capsule.  
e. The second syringe  is placed into the intracondylar notch, and study drug 
administered directly on to the central posterior capsule. Again, having the knee in 
flexion in slight forward transla tion and with appropriate retraction may help to 
visualize the area.   
i. If a cruciate retaining system is utilized, the syringe with Luer -lock applicator 
is placed full -length into the medial aspect of the femoral component notch (as 
far proximal and as dee p as possible) and half the drug instilled at a 
posteromedial angle. The syringe is then moved to the lateral aspect of the 
femoral component notch (maintaining its deep position) and the remainder of 
study drug is instilled at a posterolateral angle. Thes e maneuvers allow drug to 
be instilled directly to coat the entirety of the central posterior capsular region. 
Gravity will draw study drug distally toward the tibia as the drug is instilled.  
ii. If a posterior -stabilized design is utilized, best visualization  will likely be over 
the top of the tibial post, so the entire contents of the syringe should be 
instilled from that point (with the syringe and Luer -lock applicator inserted 
full-length at the proximal and deepest aspect of the central region of the 
capsu le, directly coating the entirety of the central region by [CONTACT_39971]). Gravity will draw study drug distally toward the tibia as the 
drug is instilled.  
f. The knee is then brought out into full extension and kept in that position for the 
remainder of the case. The surgeon may choose to massage the back of the knee 
briefly to help distribute the drug.  
2. Anteromedial tissues and periosteum : The third syringe and Luer -lock applicator is used to 
instill the medial gutter, periosteum, and capsule.  Be sure to evenly distribute the study drug 
onto all these surfaces. Retraction and elevation of the medial capsule by [CONTACT_39972].  
3. Anterolateral tissues, periosteum, and closure : The final syringe and Luer -lock applicator 
is similarly used to instill study drug onto the lateral capsule, periosteum, lateral gutter, fat 
pad, and quadriceps tendon, which should all be coated evenly . Again, elevation of the lateral 
capsule and quadriceps wi ll help with visualization. Wound closure of the arthrotomy, fascia , 
and dermis may then take place per surgeon preference.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Combination of Periarticular Injection and Instillation  
The total volume of HTX -011 is to be administered intraoperatively.  
Protocol No: HTX -011-209 Page 41 of 87

may cause life -threatening central nervous system and cardiac seque lae. 
Medial and Lateral Capsule  
One half of the remaining volume is divided equally into the medial and lateral capsule.  
 In similar fashion to posterior capsule injection, inject an equal volume medially and laterally 
with multiple injection points to even ly distribute HTX -[ADDRESS_41705] occurred.  
 Peripatellar Area  
 The peripatellar area includes all anterior joint capsular tissues and patellofemoral

Posterior Capsule  
 The bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39919]. At this point , it is expected that the menisci have been resected 
and the posterior aspect of the joint debrided as needed, taking care to avoid injury to 
posterior  neurovascular structures. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], mixing of cement may begin during the 
Protocol No: HTX -011-[ADDRESS_41707] the joint. This will facilitate visualization of the 
posterior capsule.  
 Approximately [ADDRESS_41708] 10 to 15 injection points.  
 
 The appropriate technique should include:  
 Insertion of the needle by a few millimeters  
 Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_39915] (this is mandatory due to the potential 
of unintended intr avascular administration), then  
 Injection of a small amount of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] . NOTE: unintended intravascular 
injection may cause life -threatening central nervous system and cardiac sequelae.  
Medial and Lateral Capsule  
 In similar fashion to posterior caps ule injection, inject 7 mL medially and 7 mL laterally with 
multiple injection points to evenly distribute bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39920], and periosteum of the femur and tibia .

(Total Volume  = 50 mL)  
Injection should occur prior to cementation and placement of components to al low adequate 
visualization.  
Posterior Capsule  
 The bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39931]. At this point, it is expected that the menisci have been resected 
and the posterior aspect of the join t debrided as needed, taking care to avoid injury to 
posterior neurovascular structures. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], mixing of cement may begin during the 
injection process once experienced in the technique. Initially, the knee is placed at [ADDRESS_41714] the joint. This will facilitate visualization of the 
posterior capsule.  
 Approximately [ADDRESS_41715] 10 to 15 injection points.  
 
 The appropriate technique shoul d include:  
 Insertion of the needle by a few millimeters  
 Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_39915] (this is mandatory due to the potential 
of unintended intravascular administration), then  
 Injection of a small amount of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974]. NOTE: uni ntended intravascular 
injection may cause life -threatening central nervous system and cardiac sequelae.  
Medial and Lateral Capsule  
 In similar fashion to posterior capsule injection, inject 7 mL medially and 7 mL laterally with 
multiple injection points to evenly distribute bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39920], and periosteum of the femur and tibia.  
Peripatellar Area  
 The peripatellar area includes all anterior joint capsular tissues and patellofemoral capsule.

Saline placebo injection will be performed as above described for bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39923]. In Cohort 2, the total volume is 13.[ADDRESS_41716] be administered in accordance with the treatment assignment . Because study 
drug is being administered as a component of the surgical procedure, a lack of treatment 
compliance is not expected .  
5.7. Study Drug Accountability  
The IP provided for this study wil l be used only as directed in the study protocol . In accordance 
with Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ), Investigators are required to maintain accurate and 
up-to-date records of all IP to permit reconciliation of study drug . The Investigator or designee 
must ma intain adequate records of distribution, including  the date received, number and units 
received, lot numbers , dispensing, and return or destruction of all IP (ie, accountability or 
dispen sing logs).  
All study drug records must be readily available for inspection by [CONTACT_779] ’s unblinded clinical 
monitor and/or auditor . No IP can be returned to the Sponsor or designee or disposed of at the 
study site until the unblinded clinical monitor has verified the accuracy of the study drug records 
at the study site . All returns, disposal , or destruction must be approved by [CONTACT_39974].  
Protocol No: HTX -011-[ADDRESS_41717]’s 
medical records from their primary care physician is recommended . Data collected will include 
medical and surgical history.  
6.1.2.  Demographics  
Demographic information collected will include age, sex, race, and ethn icity. 
6.2. Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
All medications taken by [CONTACT_39975] [ADDRESS_41718]’s eCRF . The name, dose, and route, as well as the start date and time, of concomitant 
medications must be recorded during the 72 -hour postoperative period. Medications include 
prescription or over -the-counter medications (including herbal products and vitamins). For 
subjects entering on a stable dose of permitted medication, any change in dose should also be 
recorded . 
Note: All medications must have a start date recorded; “prn” should not be recorded on the 
eCRF. IV fluids and oxygen during surgery do not need to be recorded unless being used to treat 
an AE.  
6.3. Efficacy Assessments  
6.3.1.  Pain Intensity  Assessment  
Subjects will b e asked to evaluate their current pain level at scheduled timepoints after surgery . 
Subjects will receive training by [CONTACT_39976].  
Pain intensity scores will be assessed using a n 11-point NRS (0–10) wher e 0 represe nts “no 
pain” and 10  repres ents “worst pain imaginable”  (see Appendix D). NRS scores will be recorded 
first at rest (NRS -R; in a dependent position  [either seated comfortably or lying down] ) and then 
with activity (N RS-A) where the prescribed activity is a straight leg raise  of the surgical leg  
while the subject is lying down  or recumbent . Continuous passive motion ( CPM ) machines are 
not required in this study; however, if they are to be used, they are not allowed within the first 
12 hours after study drug administration (see Section 9.3). 
Protocol No: HTX -011-[ADDRESS_41719]’s eCRF  from Time 0 through 72 hours . For more 
information on opi[INVESTIGATOR_39933], see Section  3.1.3 . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Subject Daily Diary  
Subjects will be provided a diary to record if they took any opi[INVESTIGATOR_39934]. Subjects will be required to record their use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_39935] 72 hours through Day 28.  
6.3.3.  Patient Global Assessment of Pain Control  
Subjects will be asked to evaluate the performance of study drug as a pain treatment at different 
intervals using  a 4-point rating scale where 0  represents “poor” and 3 represents “excellent”  
(Rothman, 2009 ). See Appendix E for the PGA  scale.  
6.3.4.  Rehabilitation  and Ambulation  
Sites will assess  the subject’s ability to participate in rehabilitation sessions  according  to the 
site’s standard rehabilitation protocol.  
Sites will also assess the subject’s ability to ambulat e. Ambulation is defined as the ability to 
walk more than 3  steps with an assisted device.  
6.3.5.  Discharge Readiness  
Discharge readiness will be assessed using the MPADSS criteria  (Chung, 1995 ). Discharge 
readiness assessments will be repeat ed for subjects who re main hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39869] 96 and 120  hours.  
Refer to  Appendix B. 
Note: This study instrument assesses a subject’s potenti al readiness to be discharged  and should 
be repeated at all scheduled timepoints . It is not meant to be used to decide on whether or n ot to 
discharge a subject from the study. Subjects are required to remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] /research 
facility  for [ADDRESS_41720]’s  response to the following statement “I am satisfied with postoperative pain control ” 
will be recorded using  a 5-point Likert scale where 1  represents “strongly disagree” and 
5 represents “strongly agree.”  
Protocol No: HTX -011-[ADDRESS_41721] will be questioned about their overall benefit of analgesia using a 7 -item, 
multidimensional , quality assessment questionnaire  (Lehmann, 2010 ). The [ADDRESS_41722] signs 
the ICF through Day  28. See Section  8 for details.  
6.4.2.  Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity Assessment  
Subjects should be assessed on a regular basis to identify early neurologic and cardia c signs and 
symptoms that may be attributed to local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST; eg, 
metallic/strange taste, perioral tingling, ringing in ears, visual disturbance, tremors, muscle 
twitching, dizziness/lightheadedness, convulsion/seizure, bradycard ia, arrhythmia, hypotension) 
(Vasques, 2015 ). Additional monitoring of subjects for safety should be performed a s needed 
(eg, vital signs , unscheduled PK blood draw ). 
Signs and symptoms that are clinically significant and may be attributed to LAST should be 
recorded as AEs.  
6.4.3.  Physical Examination s 
Scheduled physical examinations will include a n evaluation of the following: head, eyes, ears, 
nose, and throat as well as CV, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, neurological, dermatological, and 
musculoskeletal systems . 
Baseline h eight and weight measurements, and calculation of BMI  (BMI  = weight [kg]/height 
[m2]) will be conducted . 
Unsc heduled physical examinations may also be performed (the extent of which is to be 
determined by [CONTACT_737]) at any time during the study if indicated by a change in the 
subject’s medical history or condition.  
6.4.4.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include syst olic and diastolic blood pressure , resting heart rate , and respi[INVESTIGATOR_11943]. Subjects should be in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547] (includes sitting in a recliner chair) for at least 
[ADDRESS_41723] -treatment vital sign r esults should 
be recorded as AEs.  
Protocol No: HTX -011-[ADDRESS_41724] digital 12 -lead ECG  result s will be 
recorded in triplicate . Subjects should be in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547] (includes sitting in a recliner 
chair) for at least [ADDRESS_41725].  
6.4.6.  Wound Healing Assessment  
Surgical wound healing will be evaluated by [CONTACT_39977] ; every attempt should be made by [CONTACT_39978] . The findings will be graded according to the South ampton Wound Scoring 
System (Bailey, 1992 ); see Appendix C. 
6.4.7.  Motor Function Assessment  
Subjects will be assessed on their ability to perform a timed 20-meter  walk  unassisted, but with 
the optional use of a [ADDRESS_41726] s 
Blood and urine samples will be collected for diagnostic screening tests and for safety laboratory 
tests (hematology and serum chemistry) . See Table  [ADDRESS_41727] of clinical laboratory tests and 
parameters . Urine samples will be tested by [CONTACT_28130]. Blood samples will be tested by a 
central laboratory . 
Laboratory results will be reviewed by [CONTACT_737] . Any laboratory values outside of the 
normal reference range will be evaluated for clinical significance . Clinically significant findings 
after study drug administration will be recorded as AEs.  
Refer to the Laboratory Manual for detailed instructions on sample collection , processing , and 
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_39936].  
Protocol No: HTX -011-[ADDRESS_41728] . If there is no response, the assessments at these timepoints may be recorded as “Not 
Applicable .” Assessments that can be done without waking the subject (eg, blood collection for 
PK sample) should  be completed. Additional visits and/or assessments are permitted if clinically 
indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689] . 
When the following assessments are scheduled at the same timepoint,  it is recommended that 
they be performed in this  order:  
 NRS -R pain intensity  assessment  (assessed in a dependent position, either seated comfortably 
or lying down)  
 PGA of pain control  
 OBAS assessment  
 Vital signs  
 12-lead ECG  
 NRS -A pain intensity assessment  (assessed while the subject is lying down or recumbent; t he 
prescribed activity is a straight leg raise of the surgical leg)  
 Blood sample collection  
 Physical examination  
 Wound healing assessment  
 Timed 20-meter  walk test  
 Rehabilitation assessment  
 Ambulation assessment  
 Subject’s satisfaction with postoperative pain co ntrol  
7.1. Screening Period  
After providing written informed consent, potential study subjects will undergo Screening 
procedures to confirm eligibility to participate in the study . Screening procedures must be 
performed within [ADDRESS_41729]’s medical history and the results of all Screening  
assessments  to determine study elig ibility before the subject is randomized . Screening laboratory 
test results that do not meet the eligibility criteria should not be repeated without the approval of 
the Sponsor’ s Medical Monitor . 
Screening procedures and assessments will include the follo wing:  
 Medical  history  
 Demographic recording  
 Physical examination (including weight, height, and BMI calculation ) 
Protocol No: HTX -011-209 Page 56 of 87 
Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential   Vital sign s measurements  
 12-lead ECG (triplicate)  
 Urine collection for pregnancy test ( female subjects of child -bearing potential only)  
 Urine collection for drug screen  
 Blood sample collection for the hematology and serum chemistry  
 Timed 20-meter walk test  
 Subject training  for pain intensity  assessments  
 AE recording (from the time the subject signs the ICF ) 
 Prior and concomitant medication recording  
Subjects will be given  a Holter monitor and provided training on how to activate it. Subjects will 
be instructed to tu rn on the monitor at least 24 hours  before surgery ( Day 0). 
All s ubjects who meet the Screening eligibility criteria will be randomized.  Randomization may 
be done up to 1 business day prior to the day of surgery . Subjects do not need to be present for 
randomization to occur.  
7.2. Treatment and Postoperative O bservation  Period  
7.2.1.  Day of Surgery (Day  0) 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Prior to Surgery  
Subjects will be admitted to the surgical unit  on Day  0. Subjects will be reassessed for study 
eligibility . Subject s who continue to meet the eligibility criteria can continue on study and t he 
following study procedures and assessments wi ll be performed before surgery:  
 Vital sign s measurements  
 Subject training for pain intensity assessments (refresher training)  
 NRS -R pain intensity assessment  
 Urine collection for pregnancy test ( female subjects of child -bearing potential only)  
 Urine collection for drug screen  
 NRS -A pain intensity assessment  
 Blood collection for PK  
 Ambulation assessment  
 AE recording  
 Prior and concomitant medication assessment  
TXA 1 g IV  will be administered prior to the start of surgery. In Cohort 2, subjects will also be 
administered  pregabalin PO (150 mg ) and acetaminophen IV (no more than 1 g [1000  mg] in a 
6-hour window , as per the approved prescribing information ) just before being taken to the 
operating room prior to the start of  surgery.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Surgery  and Study Drug Administration  
Subjects will undergo a primary unilateral TKA  under general anesthesia . Sites should follow 
intraoperative safety monitoring in accordance with American Society of Anesthesiologists 
Protocol No: HTX -011-209 Page 57 of 87 
Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Standards for Basic Anesthetic Monitoring  (American Society of Anesthesiologists, 2015 ). The 
start and stop time of surge ry and additional surgical details should be recorded in the eCRF.   
Subjects will be administered study drug unless they experience a clinically significant event 
during surgery (eg, excessive bleeding, hemodynamic instability) that would render the subject 
medically unstable or complicate their postoperative course . Study drug will be administered via 
infiltration to the su rgical site (eg, periarticular  instillation , periarticular  injection, or a 
combination of periarticular  injection and instillation ). See Section  5.5 for complete details on  
the study drug administration  technique . 
The start and stop times of study drug dosing will be recorded in the eCRF . Details of 
administration will be recorded on a worksheet , which will be used in the dictation of the 
surgical not es and will become part of the source document.  Note:  The start of study drug 
administration will be considered as Time [ADDRESS_41730] suture will be considered the end of 
surgery.  
During surgery, the use of fentanyl up to 4 μg/kg is permitted. All subjects  will receive [ADDRESS_41731] prior to the end of the surgery.  As the prescribing  information for fentanyl citrate  
(Fentanyl Citrate USPI, 2012 ) specifies that for in traoperative use a “moderate dose” of 2 to 
20 μg/kg IV is necessary in order to allow the anesthesiologist to respond to any signal that the 
surgical stress is increasing or anesthesia lightening, this dose was chosen to be in the lowermost 
portion of that  range and therefore not interfere with assessment of postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_39851]. As 
clinically appropriate, the minimum possible fentanyl dose should be used.  
Concomitant medications used  during surgery will be recorded  (note that IV fluids and oxygen 
are not required to be recorded unless being used to treat an AE) . AEs will also be recorded.  
A PK blood sample should be co llected 30  minutes (±5  min) after the start of study drug 
administration even if the subject is still in the operating room.  
Subjects will receive a second dose of TXA 1 g IV up to approximately 8 hours after the initial 
dose (Dang, 2013 ; ICJR, 2014 ; Danninger, 2015 ). 
After immediate postoperative recovery, subjects will be transferred to the PACU.  
7.2.2.  Postoperative  Assessment Period (Up to 72 Hours)  
Subjects will remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] /research facility  for 72  hours after study drug administration . 
For the time period after study drug administration until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], subjects should 
receive ASA 325 mg PO twice a day; surgeons may also use additional DVT prophylaxis as per 
their stan dard of care.  
Study  procedures and assessments that will be  performed  during the postoperative assessment 
period are listed below . All timepoints are referenced to the start of study drug administration . 
Actual times will be recorded for all events, and any deviation outside the specified ranges must 
be clearly documented in the subject’s study records.

Unscheduled visits and assessments should be performed if clinically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15960]. Except whe n urgent clinical evaluation is necessary, it is expected that the 
Investigator will have the subject return for an unscheduled visit rather than direct ing the subject 
to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9487].  The following procedures and assessments are exa mples of what 
may be performed at an unscheduled visit, depend ing on the clinical situation : 
 Vital signs  
 Physical examination  
 ECG  
 Wound healing assessment  
 X-ray 
 AE recording

humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
An AE may be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or dis ease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not 
considered causally associated with the use of the study drug . Any abnormal laboratory value , 
vital sign result, or ECG finding  deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_737], regar dless of 
causal relationship, must be reported as an AE . A clinical diagnosis, rather than the changes in 
laboratory analyte or other assessment, should be recorded (eg, anemia rather than low 
hemoglobin value) . 
Examples of AEs include the following:  
 Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition or indication under 
study . 
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition, including either an increase 
in frequency or intensity of the conditio n (eg , abnormal physical  examination finding) . 
 Signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction . 
 Signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of the study drug or a 
concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE or SAE, unl ess 
nonserious or serious sequelae occur) . 
 The following abnormal laboratory results:  
 Any laboratory abnormality suggestive of a new disease/organ toxicity or a worsening of 
a pre -existing condition  
 Any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to have IP interrupted or 
discontinued.  
 Any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to receive specific treatment for the 
abnormality.  
 Any laboratory abnormality that required additional monitoring and follow -up visits  
 Any laboratory abnormality requ iring further diagnostic investigation

Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  The following examples are not considered AEs:  
 Medical or surgical procedure (eg , endoscopy, appendectomy), although the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE . 
 Anticipated day to day fluctuations of preexisti ng disease(s) or condition(s) (including 
laboratory values) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen . 
 The disease or disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease or disorder being studied, unles s they become more severe or occur with a greater 
frequency than expected for the subject’s condition . 
 Transient paresthesia that is considered to be clinically normal (would be expected to occur 
as a long -acting local anesthetic wears off) . 
8.1.2.  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in  any of the following outcomes:  
 Death . 
 A life -threatening AE (ie, presented an immediate risk of death f rom the event as it occurred . 
This criterion is not intended to include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death.)  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] . 
 A persistent or significant incapaci ty or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions . 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition . Examples of such medical events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring  intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of  drug dependency or drug abuse.  
The following events do not meet the definition of an SAE: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39939] a pre -existing condition that does not worsen from baseline , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315] a standard 
procedure for study drug administration and routine monitoring of the studied indication not 
associated with any deteriora tion in condition,  social or convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , 
prolongation of a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39940] , or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39941] 24  hours . 
According to 21  Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 812.3(s), an unanticipated adverse device 
effect means  any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or 
death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, proble m, or death was not previously 
identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application 
(including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem 
associated with a device that relat es to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.

A suspected adverse reaction is defined as any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the AE was caused by [CONTACT_5257] .  
8.1.4.  Definition of a Serious Su spected Adverse Reaction  
A serious suspected adverse reaction is any suspected adverse reaction that is determined to be 
serious, based on the outcomes of a SAE described in Section  8.1.2 . 
8.1.5.  Definition of Unanticipated Problems  
Unanticipated problems are incidents, experiences, or outcomes that meet all of the following 
criteria:  
 Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures tha t 
are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the research protocol and informed 
consent document approved by [CONTACT_39979] s Committee (EC; includes Institutional Review 
Boards [IRBs], Independent Ethics Committees [IECs], a nd Research Ethics Boards [REBs]) 
and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being studied.  
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is 
a reasonable possibility that the incident, experienc e, or outcome may have been caused by 
[CONTACT_3459]).  
 Suggest that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recogni zed. 
An unanticipated adverse device effect is defined in Section 8.1.2 . 
8.2. Classification of Adverse Event s 
8.2.1.  Severity of Adverse Event s 
The Investigat or will assess the s everity of each AE based on his/her clinical judgment using one 
of the following categorie s: 
 Mild:  Event is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causes minimal discomfort, and does not 
interfere with everyday activities . 
 Moderate:  Event results in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some  interference with functioning.  
 Severe:  Event interrupts a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other tre atment . Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating . 
8.2.2.  Relationship to Study Drug  
The Investigator will assess the relationship of each AE to study drug based on his/her clinical 
judgment . The Investigator’s assessment of an AE’s  relationship to study drug is part of the 
documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. 
Protocol No: HTX -011-[ADDRESS_41734] . The Sponsor’s assessment of relationship may differ from the 
Investigator’s assessment.  
Relationship to study drug will be assessed according to t he following guidelines : 
 Possibly r elated:  The AE is known to occur with the study drug, there is a reasonable 
possibility that the study drug caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the 
study drug and event . Reasonable possibility means  that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study drug and the AE.  
 Unlikely Related:  There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
drug caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the st udy drug and event 
onset, or an alternate etiology has been established . 
Even in situations in which minimal information is available for initially reporting an SAE, it is 
important that the Investigator always make an assessment of causality for every eve nt before 
entering the information into the eCRF or completing the SAE reporting form, in the event 
electronic data capture (EDC) is not available. The causality assessment is one of the criteria 
used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. The  Investigator may change his or 
her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up information and amend the SAE information 
accordingly  in the eCRF or the SAE reporting form, as applicable.  
8.3. Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow Up  
8.3.1.  Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Monitoring  
All AEs regardless of causality or seriousness will be recorded from the time the subject signs 
the ICF through Day  28. 
If an Investigator becomes aware of an SAE that occurs in a subject more than [ADDRESS_41735]’s condition . All AEs and SAEs 
documented at a previous visit or contact [CONTACT_39980] . 
Nonserious AEs will be followed after the last scheduled study visit until the event resolves, the 
condition stabilizes, or until the event is otherwise explained or judged by [CONTACT_39981] (unless the subject is lost to follow -up or withdraws consent) . 
Protocol No: HTX -011-209 Page 65 of 87 
Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  The Investigator will assess the outcome of each AE using the following categories:  
 Resolved:  The event resolved or the subject recovered without sequelae . An event (either 
serious or nonserious) occurred and had an endpoint, and the subject experienced no 
restrictions . Examples include stent placement for coronary artery disease (a device 
implanted is  not a sequela), an appendectomy (a scar is not a sequela), a postoperative wound 
infection, or an upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092].  
 Resolved with sequelae:  The event has at least one secondary outcome that may result in 
permanent disability, functional l imitation, or both . Such sequelae are usually limited to 
SAEs . Examples include hip replacement resulting in foot drop (foot drop is not the intended 
outcome but is a risk of surgery), stroke resulting in paralysis, or emboli formation after a 
bacterial in fection resulting in a renal infarct and loss of renal function.  
 Not resolved:  At the end of the study, a nonserious event either has not changed in intensity 
or may not have recovered to baseline values, and the outcome is unknown . Examples 
include headac he, low -grade fever, or nausea.  
 Unknown:  The subject has withdrawn from the study prematurely or is lost to follow -up, 
and the status of the event is unknown.  
 Death  
SAEs will be followed until the event resolves  (ie, when the event no longer meets any of t he 
seriousness criteria) , the condition stabilizes, or until the event is otherwise explained or judged 
by [CONTACT_39982] (unles s the subject is lost to follow -up or 
withdraws consent) . The I nvestigator will ensure that follow -up information provided to the 
Sponsor includes results of any additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathologic 
examinations, or consultations with other healthcare professionals that serve to clarify the nature 
of the event, the cause of the event, or both . New or updated information will be recorded as 
outlined in Section  8.4.1 . 
8.4. Reporting Procedures  
8.4.1.  Reporting  Serious Adverse Event s to the Sponsor  
If the Investigator determines that an event meets the protocol definition of an SAE  due to any 
cause that occurs during the course of this study, regardless of relationship to study drug , he/she 
must notify the Sponsor by [CONTACT_39983] [ADDRESS_41736] 
also enter the SAE information into the eCRF as soon as possible thereafter.  
Email Address:  Heron_PV@ubc .com  
In the initial email, the Investigator must provide to the Sponsor the following eCRF pages, 
completed to the greatest extent possible:  
 AE record  
 Medical history  
Protocol No: HTX -011-209 Page 66 of 87 
Version 6  
 
Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential   Prior and concomitant medications  
Also, the following  documents are to be forwarded:  any laboratory results, diagnostic test results, 
or medical reports relevant to the SAE.  
EDC  is the preferred metho d for notification of SAE information. In rare circum stances and in 
the absence of e mail capacity, notification by [CONTACT_39984], with a copy of the 
SAE reporting form sent by [CONTACT_9338] . Initial notification via telephone does not rep lace the 
need for the Investigator to complete the SAE information in the eCRF within the time frames 
outlined.  
If the Investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, he/she must not wait to 
receive additional information before notifying the Sponsor of the event . The SAE must be 
updated when additional information is received . Follow -up information received on all SAEs 
must be forwarded to the Sponsor using the same timelines as for an initial report.  The 
Investigator must notify the Sponsor b y reporting any unanticipated adverse device effect within 
[ADDRESS_41737].  
8.4.2.  Reporting Unanticipated Problems to the Sponsor  
If the Investigator determines that an event meets the protocol definition of an unanticipated 
problem , he/she must notify the Sponsor  by [CONTACT_39985] 
[ADDRESS_41738] also enter the information into the eCRF as soon as possible thereafter.  
Email Address:  Heron_PV@ubc .com  
The following information  will be included with unanticipated problem  reporting : 
 Protocol identifying information: protocol title , protocol  number, and Investigator’s name . 
 A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome . 
 An explanation of the basis for deter mining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an unanticipated problem .  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to report unanticipated problems  to the Sponsor and their 
EC, as required by [CONTACT_427].  
8.4.3.  Regulatory Reporting Requ irements  
The Investigator must promptly report all SAEs and unanticipated adverse device effect s to the 
Sponsor in accordance with the procedures detailed in Section  8.4.[ADDRESS_41739] for SAE receipt is essential so that serious 
suspected adverse reactions that are either unexpected or observed with increasing occurrence be

9.1. Prohibited Medications  
Antiemetic medications may be given to treat nausea and/or vomiting, but should not be 
administered prophylactically (ie, as a routine preventative in the absence of signs or symptoms 
of nausea  or vomiting ). 
With the exception of preoperative administration of pregabalin  and acetaminophen  (in Cohort 2 
only) , intraoperative administration of study drug  (including ropi[INVESTIGATOR_39858] 1 arm in Cohort 2)  
and f entanyl, opi[INVESTIGATOR_39942]  3.1.3 , and ASA for DVT 
prophylaxis , no other analgesic agents, including  ketamine and  NSAI Ds, are permitted from 
signing the ICF through 72  hours after study drug administration, except under the f ollowing 
circumstances:  
 To treat an AE . 
 For pretreatment prior to needle placement . 
 To decrease  venous irritation caused by [CONTACT_39955] (in which case, no more than a single 
administration of lidocaine 1% 20  mg IV may be administered).  
After [ADDRESS_41741] use an 
acceptab le form of contraception in the event of sexual activity during the study and for 30  days 
after study drug administration . Acceptable forms of contraception include double -barrier 
contraception or an insertable, injectable, transdermal, or combination oral  contraceptive.  
9.3. Prohibited Treatment  
CPM  machines are not required in this study; however, if they are to be used, they are not 
allowed within the first 12 hours after study drug administration.  
Protocol No: HTX -011-[ADDRESS_41742] observed 
measurement, whether scheduled or unscheduled, prior to study drug administration . All safety 
and efficacy endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_22975]/ or cohort, as appropriate. 
Continuous variables will be summarized using the number of subjects with data (n), mean, 
standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. Selected continuous variable 
summaries will also in clude the standard error (SE). Categorical variables will be summarized 
using fre quency counts and percentages.  
Unless otherwise specified, all statistical hypothesis te sting will be two -sided using α  = 0.05.  
10.2. Determination of Sample Size  
Cohort 1: The sample size of up to approximately 60 subjects was selected empi[INVESTIGATOR_39943] s. 
Cohort 2: The mean (SD) AUC 0-48 in the saline placebo and HTX -011 400 mg groups after 
adjusting for opi[INVESTIGATOR_39874] 425 (90) and 
365 (90), respectively. Using a [ADDRESS_41743], 50 subjects per treatment group results in 
approximately 90% power to detect a statistically sign ificant treatment effect with α  = 0.05, 
2-sided.  
10.3. Analysis Populations  
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population : All su bjects who are randomized and receive study drug  will be 
included in the ITT Population . This population will be used as the primary analysis population 
for all efficacy endpoints. The randomized treatment assignment will be used for analysis in this 
popul ation.   
Safety Population : All subjects who receive study drug will be included in the Safety Population . 
This population will be used for all summaries of safety data . The actual treatment received will 
be used for analysis in this population.  
10.4. Statistical  Analysis Methods  
10.4.1.  Disposition  and Demographics  
The number and percentage of subjects in each analysis population will be summarized. Subject  
disposition, including the number of subjects  screened, rando mized, dosed, completing the 
72-hour postoperative observation period , completing Day 28, and not completing Day [ADDRESS_41744]  demographics and 
baseline characteristics will be summarized for the ITT Population and will include age, age 
categ ory, sex, race, ethnicity, height, weight, and BMI.  
Protocol No: HTX -011-[ADDRESS_41745] each control arm.   
In Cohort 2, the following tre atment comparisons will be performed in a hierarchical order for 
the primary and key secondary endpoint s: 
1. Mean AUC 0-48 of the NRS -R pain intensity scores for HTX -011 400 mg /12 mg (13.7 mL) via 
periarticular instillation and ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 50 mg via periarticular injection vs. saline placebo . 
2. Mean AUC 0-48 of the NRS -R pain intensity scores for HTX -011 400 mg /12 mg (13.7 mL) via 
periarticular instillation vs. saline placebo . 
3. Mean AUC 0-72 of the NRS -R pain intensity scores for HTX -011 400 mg /12 mg (13.7 mL) via 
periarticular instillation and ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 50 mg via periarticular injection vs. saline placebo . 
4. Mean AUC 0-72 of the NRS -R pain intensity scores for HTX -011 400 mg /12 mg (13.7 mL) via 
periarticular instillation vs.  saline  placebo . 
In order to account for multiple treatment comparisons on the primary and key secondary 
endpoint s in Cohort 2, a strict testing hierarchy will be applied to control study -wise alpha level 
at 0.05. If the first treatment comparison is statisticall y significant (p≤0.05), then the second  
treatment comparison will be tested. If the second  treatment comparison is statistically 
significant, then the third  treatment comparison will be tested. Sequential testing will continue in 
this manner down the hiera rchical order until a treatment comparison fails to meet statistical 
significance, after which all subsequent treatment comparisons will be considered exploratory.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary analysis of mean AUC 0-48 of the NRS -R pain intensity scores will be carried out on 
the ITT Population using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with treatment as th e main 
effect. Results will be expres sed as mean AUCs and SDs, least -squares mean differences and 
SEs with ass ociated 95%  confidence intervals (CIs), and p -values.  To account for the duration 
effect of opi[INVESTIGATOR_39890], the windowed worst observation carried forward (wWOCF) 
method will be implemented as the primary analysis method for endpoints involving NRS pain 
intensity  scores. In this method, pain intensity scores observed during the analgesic window 
(duration of effect) of any opi[INVESTIGATOR_39944] (highest) 
postdose nonmissing NRS pain intensity score observed prior to the rescue med ication window, 
with the following exception: if the NRS pain intensity score for a windowed observation is 
higher than the worst pre -window score, then it will not be replaced. Sensitivity analyses for 
endpoints involving NRS pain intensity scores will an alyze the data without adjustment for the 
effect of opi[INVESTIGATOR_39859].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
Continuous secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed similarly to that specified for the 
primary endpoint.

methods.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Handling of Missing Data  
Due to the required [ADDRESS_41746] (LOCF) , in which the most recent  post-dose 
non-missing value is used for a subsequent missing value. For subjects who do not have a 
postdose value prior to their first missing value, the median of the postdose values at the relevant 
timepoint from subjects with observed data in the same randomized treatment group will be 
used. Predose values will not be carried forwar d to postdose timepoints. Analyses that adjust for 
the effect of opi[INVESTIGATOR_39946] (ie, perform 
LOCF first, then apply wWOCF ). 
Other continuous efficacy endpoints with missing data will be handled using LOCF. In gen eral, 
subjects with missing categorical data at a timepoint will be assumed to have not met the 
endpoint at that timepoint. For the analysis of time to first opi[INVESTIGATOR_39890], subjects

Heron T herapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Appendix F: Overall Benefit of Analgesia Assessment  
 
Sites will ask each subject the statements listed below , and the rating scale below will be used to 
calculate the overall OBAS score.  
  Rating  
[ADDRESS_41760] on a scale between 0=minimal 
pain and 4=maximum imaginable pain  |__| 
[ADDRESS_41761] 24 h r  
(0=not at all to 4=very much)  |__| 
[ADDRESS_41762] 24 h r  
(0=not at all to 4=very much)  |__|

[ADDRESS_41765] 24 h r  
(0=not at all to 4=very much)  |__| 
[ADDRESS_41766] 24 h r  
(0=not at all to 4= very much)?  4 - |__| = |__|  
 Overall Benefit of Analgesia Score:  |__|__|  
To calculate the OBAS  score, compute the sum of the scores in items 1 through 6 and add  
‘4-score in item 7’  
Example OBAS calculation: A subject patient with minimal pain (NRS=0), severe 
vomiting (NRS=4), and no itching, sweating, and freezing who is slightly dizzy (NRS=1), 
and is not very satisfied with his postoperative pain treatment (NRS=1) has an OBAS of 8.  
Note that a low score indicates high benefit.

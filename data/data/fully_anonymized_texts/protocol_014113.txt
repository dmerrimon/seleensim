Protocol #04429022  10 May 2023  
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.[ADDRESS_961515] common major gynecologic surgery performed in the US and is performed for 
a variety of indications including malignancy, pelvic mass, endometriosis, leiomyoma, and pelvic organ 
prolapse (5). The standard of care for pain management afte r laparoscopic hysterectomy is non -specific. 
This includes general anesthesia and a focus on non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_2454]. Unfortunately, there is no 
standardized medication regimen as standard of care and pain management after hysterectomy varies 
widely fr om surgeon to surgeon. The traditional regimen for post -operative pain control is opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -based, 
however there is limited research regarding the necessary amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_707585]. Some studies suggest that patient s only take 28% of prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (4). A 
recent case -control cohort study by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Mark from Roswell Park regarding ultra -restrictive opi[INVESTIGATOR_707586], complications or 
medication re fill requests; suggesting that far fewer opi[INVESTIGATOR_707587] (7). New 
persistent opi[INVESTIGATOR_188793] a common and under -recognized surgical complication which occurs in 6.5% of 
patients undergoing major surgery (3). In light of the ongoing op ioid epi[INVESTIGATOR_901], a transition to non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_707588].  
 
A recent quality improvement study by [CONTACT_707640] a reduction in post -operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_482747] a 
pain medication regimen using gabapent in, celecoxib, acetaminophen and local ropi[INVESTIGATOR_707589] (1). Multiple small randomized control trials have shown a reduction in post -
operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_707590] a paracervical block is used in the setting of a vaginal hysterectomy (2). The 
goal of our study is to assess the effect of a multimodal non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_707591] - including 
gabapentin, celecoxib, acetaminophen, ketorolac, ropi[INVESTIGATOR_707592] a paracervical 
block - on postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_707593]. We chose this 
regimen after considering success in prior studies, cost minimization and resource availability. While 
NSAIDs such as celecoxib and ketorolac are associated with risks of renal insufficiency and gastric ulcers, 
these risks are dose dependent and these medications are well -tolerated in the majority of our patient 
population. NSAIDs have become a staple in pain medication regimens due to their capacity to 
effectively treat pain after hysterectomy wh ile minimizing opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (5). Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_707594] - life than lidocaine as well as its cost and resource availability as compared to liposomal 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. An emphasis was placed on pain medications taken by [CONTACT_707641] (PO) t o facilitate 
post -operative milestones and decreased length of stay. The pain medications chosen in the above 
multimodal regimen are largely well -tolerated by [CONTACT_1962], effectively treat pain and show promise in 
reducing opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] -postoperatively.  
 
Our pr imary outcomes are total opi[INVESTIGATOR_707595] [ADDRESS_961516] -
operatively in morphine milligram equivalents (MME). Opi[INVESTIGATOR_707596], 
as it is most often reported in literature, to increase generaliz ability and applicability.   
 
Our study design is a prospective cohort study with historical controls. While a randomized control trial 
would be ideal, the expected variation in outcomes precludes this possibility at this institution. Because

NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017   5 of the wide va riation in opi[INVESTIGATOR_707597], an adequately powered randomized control trial 
would require significantly higher case numbers than available at this institution.  
 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT    
2.3.[ADDRESS_961517] allergic reactions are minimal and 
treated quickly with a resolution of allergic symptoms in less than 4 hours. There is a risk of toxicity from 
local anesthetic, ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. All medications are considered safe in study outlined dosages and 
regimen.  
 
The paracervical block carries small, preventable risks to the patient. The dosage of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_707598]. Toxicity is 
always possible however all steps to minimize toxicity (e.g. ensuring injection into cervical stroma not 
blood vessel) will be undertaken.  
 
During any surgery, there is an inherent risk of needle stick. There is a risk to surgeons and staff of 
needle -stick during paracervi cal block. As a whole, the paracervical block does not significantly increase 
the risk profile of the procedure.  
 
Breach of confidentiality is always a risk however collected information in this study is generally benign. 
Assigning a number to each record i n the spreadsheet and coding the record will minimize it risk for 
breach of confidentiality.

2.3.3  ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
Potential risks and benefits were discussed with all patients in an informed consent discussion with their 
surgeon. Overall, risk of harm during participation in this study was deemed minimal. Subjects were 
monitored in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707599]. No new medications were 
prescribed for the patient to take at home; all medications had been trialed by [CONTACT_707642][INVESTIGATOR_307].

7 STUDY INTERVENTION  DISCONTINUATION  AND PARTICIPANT  
DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  
7.1 DISCONTINUATION  OF STUDY INTERVENTION  
Discontinuation from the intervention arm does not mean discontinuation from the study, an d 
remaining study procedures should be completed as indicated by [CONTACT_4690].  If a clinically 
significant finding is identified (including, but not limited to changes from baseline) after enrollment, the 
investigator or qualified designee will dete rmine if any change in participant management is needed. 
Any new clinically relevant finding will be reported as an adverse event (AE).  
 
The data to be collected at the time of study intervention discontinuation will include the following:  
• medications adm inistered  
• reason for study discontinuation  
Multimodal Pain Management After Robotic -Assisted Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy  Version 1.0 
Protocol #04429022  10 May 2023  
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017   12 • time and date of discontinuation  
 
Data will be reviewed on a weekly basis by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_707618]. All subjects 
will have their study data reviewed within a week of their surgery. The surgeon will report any adverse 
events throughout the study duration to the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_347160] a patient call or present to their office with an 
adverse event. All adverse events including medication reactions will be reviewed. Safety endpoints 
include allergic reaction to medications. Safety information will be collected in a case report fo rm, on a 
weekly basis. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_46006]. Cumulative safety data will be reviewed every 6 months. 
The safety data will be analyzed with rate of adverse events to determine if harm is occurring.  
 
A serious adverse event in response to a paracer vical block will trigger an immediate suspension of 
research.  
 
7.2 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  FROM THE STUDY  
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
An investigator may discontinue or withdraw a participant from the study for the following reasons:  
• Significant study intervention non -compliance  
• If any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or 
situation occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the 
participant  
• If the participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation  
• Participant unable to receive study intervention  
 
The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal f rom the study will be recorded on the Case 
Report Form (CRF). Subjects who sign the informed consent form but do not receive the study 
intervention may be replaced.  Subjects who sign the informed consent form and receive the study 
intervention, and subseq uently withdraw, or are withdrawn or discontinued from the study, will be 
replaced.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_961530] be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:  
• The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_707647] 1 week 
and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if 
the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or des ignee will make every 
effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a 
certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These 
contact [CONTACT_707648]’s medical record or study file.  
• Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow -up.

gastric by[CONTACT_6476], gastric ulcers, chronic kidney disease). Patients with current opi[INVESTIGATOR_707619]. 
Cognitively impaired and non -English speaking patient s were excluded. If eligible, patients were given 
verbal and written information regarding the study protocol. Subjects were given the consent form at 
their pre -operative visit, then asked to sign and return the consent form prior to their surgery. Timing 
between pre -operative visit and surgery ranged from 14 to 60 days.  
 
Historical controls were identified through EMR chart search for RA -TLH procedure performed by [CONTACT_37040]. A review of the electronic chart via Surginet was used to screen for historical control eligibility. 
Reports were run to identify potential participants with the following criteria: date, physician and 
procedure. Further screening by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_707608]. 
Patients with contraindication to  any study medications (ex: allergy, h/o gastric by[CONTACT_6476], gastric ulcers, 
chronic kidney disease) were excluded. Patients with current opi[INVESTIGATOR_707609]. Cog nitively impaired 
and non -English speaking patients were excluded.  
 
For both the intervention and control groups, all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707620] a 
registered nurse (RN). Once discharged, patients self -administered oral medications.  
 
For the intervention group, subjects were given oral acetaminophen and gabapentin in the pre -
operative holding area, prior to surgery. After general anesthesia was administered, the paracervical 
block with local anesthetic (0.5% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]) was administered b y a physician; 10 mL of 0.5% 
ropi[INVESTIGATOR_707621] (2 injection sites) for total of 20mL. Local anesthetic (0.5% 
ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]) injected at all laparoscopic port sites by a physician; 10mL spread equally between 
laparoscopic port incisions. Th e surgeon operated at <15mmHg intra -abdominal pressure with a goal of 
<12mmHg. At end of procedure during closure of fascia, 30mg ketorolac IV was given once, by [CONTACT_707649] (physician or certified nurse anesthetist).  
 
Postoperatively for the i ntervention group, the following medications were given in a scheduled fashion: 
gabapentin 300mg PO BID for 7 days, acetaminophen 1000mg PO q6h x 2 days, and celecoxib 200mg PO 
q 12h x 7d. As needed medications for break through pain included: hydromorphon e 1mg IV PRN q3h 
and oxycodone 5mg PO PRN q4h while inpatient.  
 
For the intervention group, oxycodone 5mg PO x 12 tabs was prescribed upon discharge (90MME), if 
patient needed opi[INVESTIGATOR_707622]. If no opi[INVESTIGATOR_707623], th e patient 
was discharged home with only non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_2454]. After 2 days of scheduled acetaminophen, 
patients were instructed to take acetaminophen 1000mg q6h PRN.  
 
For the control group, patients received a non -standardized pain medication regime n including opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], 
acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory medications (NSAIDs). They did not receive a 
paracervical block, nor did they receive local anesthetic at port site incisions.

with the surgeon, information regarding the trial will be given to potential subjects. All potential 
subjects will be reminded that participation is voluntary and regardless of enrollment, their 
postoperative pain  will be treated. Data will be de -identified and no identifiable data will be published. 
Recruitment and follow up will occur in private exam rooms where subjects’ confidentiality will be 
ensured. The interventions will occur in an operating room equipped with Da Vinci robotic system at 
Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], a fully accredited tertiary care institution within [LOCATION_001] State, 
equipped with badge access security system.  
 
For the control arm, retrospective data pulls will occur in a private, non -public setting. All data will be 
collected from Cerner electronic medical record (Powerchart and Surginet). All electronic medical 
resources are password protected with two -factor authentication sign in. Study consent forms will be 
scanned into the two -factor password security authentication protected UB domain. The electronic copy 
of consent forms will be retained however the paper copy will be destroyed following the creation of 
the scanned electronic form.  
 
An in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707628] & Gynecology physician was present at all times during this study. Data analysis 
for the project as a whole will occur in a private, non -public setting.  
 
Data will be reviewed on a weekly basis by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_707618]. All subjects 
will have their stud y data reviewed within a week of their surgery. The surgeon will report any adverse 
events throughout the study duration to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_347160] a patient call or present to their office with an 
adverse event.  
 
Collected study data will be stored in a password -encrypted datasheet, on a UB domain that is also 
password security protected with two -factor authentication sign -in. Only the research team will have 
access to the password protected spreadsheet. Once all data collection has been completed, all data 
identifie rs will be deleted from the data collection sheet to create a de -identified data set. Individual 
results will not be shared with subjects. The results of this study will be presented and potentially 
published in aggregated format.  
   
8.3 ADVERSE EVEN TS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
8.3.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  (AE)  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in 
huma ns, whether or not considered intervention -related.  
 
8.3.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  (SAE)   
An adverse event (AE) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -threatening ad verse 
event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant 
incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect. Important medical ev ents that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

Protocol #04429022  10 May 2023  
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017   16 8.3.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE E VENT  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
For adverse events (AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines 
will be used to describe severity.  
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere wit h the participant’s daily 
activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual dail y activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  Of 
note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
All adverse events (AEs) must have their re lationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_21217]/her clinical judgment. 
The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clin ical trial, the 
study product must always be suspect.  
• Related – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention, there is a reasonable 
possibility that the study intervention caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the 
study inte rvention and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study intervention and the AE.  
• Not Re lated – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
intervention caus ed the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention and 
event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
Both the PI [INVESTIGATOR_707629] (AE) is 
expected or unex pected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of 
the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention.  
8.3.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE ) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or 
upon review by a study monitor.  
 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will b e captured on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_21218] a  diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs 
occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be 
followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time  that the participant is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any 
time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.

Protocol #04429022  10 May 2023  
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.[ADDRESS_961536] all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is 
obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation.  At 
each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurr ence of AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events 
will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_961537] include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable poss ibility that the study intervention 
caused the event. Study endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g., all -cause mortality) must be 
reported in accordance with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship 
between the study i ntervention and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In that case, the 
investigator must immediately report the event to the sponsor.  
 
All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the site 
investigator deems  the event to be chronic or the participant is stable. Other supporting documentation 
of the event may be requested by [CONTACT_36909] (DCC)/study sponsor and should be 
provided as soon as possible.  
 
The study sponsor will be responsible for no tifying the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of any 
unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible, but in no case later 
than 7 calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information.  In addition, the s ponsor must 
notify FDA and all participating investigators in an Investigational New Drug (IND) safety report of 
potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, but in no case later 
than [ADDRESS_961538]

8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
8.4.1  DEFINITION OF U NANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP)  
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to 
participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that 
are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board (IRB) -approved 
research protoco l and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant 
population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experien ce, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]); and  
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously know n or recognized.  
 
8.4.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING  
The investigator will report unanticipated problems (UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) and to the Data Coordinating Center (DCC)/lead principal investigator (PI). The UP report will 
include the following information:  
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
number;  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experienc e, or outcome 
represents an UP;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken 
or are proposed in response to the UP.  
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the followin g timeline:   
• UPs that are serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the IRB and to the DCC/study 
sponsor within 7 days of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
• Any other UP will be reported to the IRB and to the DCC/study sponsor with in 30 days of the 
investigator becoming aware of the problem.  
• All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_17347]’s 
written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), and the Office for Human 
Research Protections (OHRP) within 30 days of the IRB’s receipt of the report of the problem from the 
investigator.  
 
8.4.3  REPORTING UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  TO PARTICIPANTS  
Individual results will not be shared with subjects however AEs and SAEs related to the study will be 
shared with participants.

9.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
We plann ed a study of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] (measured in morphine milligram equivalents) use postoperatively from 
independent control and experimental subjects with [ADDRESS_961539] the null hypothesis that the 
population  means of the experimental and control groups are equal with probability (power) 0.8.   The 
Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05.  
 
We expect ed to screen [ADDRESS_961540] deviations, medians, and ranges. Categorical variables will be summarized with frequencies 
and percentages. Analysis of outcome measures will primarily be based on general linear models such as 
t-tests and multiple regression. For markedl y non -normally distributed data, nonparametric methods 
will be used.  An overall alpha -level of 0.05 will be used as a cut -point for statistical significance and all 
statistical tests will be two -sided. All data will be analyzed using SPSS.

Review Board (IRB) -approved and the participant was asked to read and review the document. The 
investigator will explain the research study to the participant and answer any questions that may arise. 
A verbal explanat ion will be provided in terms suited to the participant’s comprehension of the 
purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research participants.  
Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the written cons ent form and ask questions 
prior to signing. The participants should have the opportunity to discuss the study with their family or 
surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The participant will sign the informed 
consent document prior  to any procedures being done specifically for the study. Participants must be 
informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, without 
prejudice. A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the p articipants for their records. 
The informed consent process will be conducted and documented in the source document (including the 
date), and the form signed, before the participant undergoes any study -specific procedures. The rights 
and welfare of the par ticipants will be protected by [CONTACT_21223].  
10.1.2  STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE  
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient r easonable 
cause.  Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be 
provided by [CONTACT_707652].  If the 
study is prematurely terminated or suspend ed, the Principal Investigator (PI) will promptly inform study 
participants, the Institutional Review Board (IRB), and sponsor and will provide the reason(s) for the 
termination or suspension.  Study participants will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], as applicable, and be in formed of 
changes to study visit schedule.  
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants  
• Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]    
• Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements  
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable  
• Dete rmination that the primary endpoint has been met  
• Determination of futility

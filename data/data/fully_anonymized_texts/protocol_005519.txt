Noninvasive Cervical Electrical Stimulation for ALS: Mechanistic and Safety Study  
 
May 5, 2019  
PART II  
GUIDE TO RESEARCH PROPOSAL  
 
1. SPECIFIC AIMS  
Aim 1: Map the cellular and synaptic targets of cervical electrical stimulation (CES).  
CES circuit interactions at both the spi[INVESTIGATOR_216933] a common 
structure comprising an electrical or magnetic conditioning stimulus followed by a test stimulus delivered 
at a range of intensities, sites, and interstimulus intervals (ISI). This will shed insight into which circuits CES activates, and how CES circuits interact with circuits activated by [CONTACT_217011].  
Hypothesis 1.1: Conditioning subthreshold CES will potentiate spi[INVESTIGATOR_911603] (TMS) pulses. Depending on the timing of the effect, this would support 
either the mechanism of heterosynaptic summation between segmental Ia input and descending corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_216935]
1, or sensory cortical facilitation of motor cortex excitability2–4. 
Hypothesis 1.2: Conditioning CES will increase persistence (number of responses per 20 stimuli) of spi[INVESTIGATOR_911604] F- responses to retrograde stimulation over the median and/or ulnar nerve. This would 
indicate CES’s potential to modulate motor neuron excitability at the spi[INVESTIGATOR_139730].  
Hypothesis 1.3: Conditioning CES will reduce amplitude of median (flexor carpi [INVESTIGATOR_4778]) H -responses, 
indicating that CES traveling via sensory afferents homosynaptically depresses ensuing H -reflexes5,6. This 
would demonstrate the potential for CES to reduce hyperactive muscle stretch responses (spasticity)5 via 
segmental afferent interactions.  
Aim 2: Determine optimal CES and volitional movement combination parameters for acutely 
facili tating concurrent arm and hand movements.  
Volitional limb movements depend on the same corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_911605] F- waves. Since preliminary data shows that subthreshold CES facilitates TMS 
responses, CES may also be able to facilitate volitional limb movements. The experiments in Aim 2 will 
shed light on this clinically applicable question.  
Hypothesis 2.1: Subthreshold CES will facilitate  concurrent arm and hand muscle activation, further 
indicating CES’s ability to positively modulate corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_216938]/or motor neuron excitability. This would establish an opportunity to directly translate this paradigm for clinical benefit by [CONTACT_911643] -oriented physical exercise training in a subsequent study.  
Hypothesis 2.2: High -intensity suprathreshold CES will transiently inhibit  concurrent arm and hand 
muscle activation. If observed, this ‘spi[INVESTIGATOR_216939]’ would shed insight into mechanisms underlying the ‘cortical silent period’ noted when cortical TMS is delivered during volitional contraction

2. BRIEF REVIEW OF RESULTS AND CURRENT STATE OF KNOWLEDGE  
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a spi[INVESTIGATOR_854951].  Many of the most striking features of ALS – 
muscular atrophy, fasciculations, and findings of denervation on electromyography – demonstrate the 
consequences of damage to lower motor neurons within the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. The almost pathognomonic spasticity and hyperreflexia seen in atrophied limbs reflects degenerating corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_911606] (“lateral sclerosis”). Remaining motor circuits are weak, uncoordinated, and spastic
9. 
Therefore, ALS shares many key features with incomplete spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] (SCI). Thus, some of the 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_911607] .  
A large body of evidence in brain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_911608]10–14. Impressive gains have been made in the SCI field by 
[CONTACT_911644], including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), direct current stimulation (DCS), and invasive epi[INVESTIGATOR_911609]
10,15– 21. However, drawbacks exist, such as 
the unfeasibility of combining TMS with active exercises, the inability to directly map the timing or circuitry of DCS effects, and the risks of invasive surgery for epi[INVESTIGATOR_429473], especially in the ALS population.  
Noninvasive electrical spi[INVESTIGATOR_911610]. We have developed a novel method of 
noninvasive cervical electrical stimulation (CES). Our technique draws on lessons learned from other 
forms of noninvasive spi[INVESTIGATOR_503439], mostly focused on the lumbar cord5,22– 26. However, these studies 
need to be supplemented with experiments that further investigate CES circuit interactions, not only within the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], but also between the cord and other parts of the nervous system. This proposal 
will address gaps in mechanistic and therapeutic understanding in the field of noninvasive spi[INVESTIGATOR_54185], and will establish the rationale for applying our novel technique in individuals with ALS.  
ALS has been neglected by [CONTACT_911645]. To our knowledge, the small body of work 
using neural stimulation in ALS has centered on the brain [[or phrenic nerve]], not the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and most 
studies have performed diagnostic rather than therapeutic stimulation27–32. A literature search revealed 
only seven primary studies of therapeutic repetitive TMS or transcranial DCS for ALS, the majori ty 
performed by [CONTACT_911646], which have not shown a clear benefit in ALS progression33–39. 
A search of “amyotrophic stimulation” on the clinicaltrials.gov database showed one study with unknown active status recruiting ALS patients for therapeutic DCS in Italy, two studies recruiting ALS patients for 
diagnostic TMS in [LOCATION_009], and our own unfunded pi[INVESTIGATOR_911611] J. Peters VA Medical Center (see Preliminary Data). Both of these searches were last 
conducted on 21 February 2017. Thus, except for our own ongoing unfunded pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], there are no 
active clinical studies anywhere in the world of spi[INVESTIGATOR_911612]. Given the limited therapeutic 
options available for ALS,  this technology warrants testing even though electromagnetic stimulation may 
not halt or reverse underlying processes that contribute to ALS pathology such as inflammation, axonal 
transport defects, and protein aggregation40.  
Significance  
ALS incidence is up to twice as high in Veterans from all eras of active duty41. Therefore, ALS is a 100% 
VA Service -Connected condition, and the experiments proposed here strongly align with RR&D’s mission. 
Treatments are extremely limited, and there remains no cure. Individuals with ALS and their loved ones are generally eager to seek out new options – unfortunately, this is often exploited by [CONTACT_911647]- defined mixtures of stem cells or herbal remedies
42–44. Therefore, rational, ethical, IRB -approved 
research studies are desperately needed. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], focused on mechanisms, safety,  and short -term 
biomarkers of efficacy, represents an essential – and original – first step toward subsequent evidence-
based studies of combined CES -exercise programs that will aim to improve clinical function in individuals 
with ALS. 
This proposal focuses  on non- invasive electrical stimulation over the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. Below, we will detail the 
state of this field, highlighting the gaps in mechanistic understanding and therapeutic application toward ALS and other conditions. We will thereby [CONTACT_911648] -invasive cervi cal electrical stimulation . 
Non-invasive brain stimulation  
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)  uses a transient focal magnetic field to induce action potentials 
in the underlying brain. TMS over the motor cortex transduces action potentials to descending corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_216941]45,46. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) at 1 Hz is generally inhibitory, whereas at 5 Hz or greater, rTMS is 
generally excitatory47. Higher -frequency (usually 50 Hz) ‘theta burst’  TMS may induce longer -lasting effects 
that are either inhibitory or excitatory based on burst patterns46,48. Seminal TMS mechanistic studies will 
serve as guides for some of the experiments in this proposal45,46,48 –50. 
Direct current stimulation (DCS)  delivers a low -power electric current that modulates neuronal excitability51. 
In distinction from TMS, DCS delivers exclusively tonic,  subthreshold stimulation52. Various cranial and 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_216942], as well 
as enhancement of normal function15,20,5 3–62. However, there is no technique to directly map how the low -
energy current distributes within the body, or to determine how individual variations in injury characteristics affect that distribution
63. Furthermore, the continuous nature of DCS makes it difficult if not impossible to 
elucidate timing- dependent synaptic changes. Therefore, although DC S has therapeutic potential, its 
underlying mechanisms are quite likely to remain a black box.  
Invasive spi[INVESTIGATOR_911613], motor -subthreshold 
stimulation, usually targeted toward the locomotor central pattern generator. In rodent SCI models, epi[INVESTIGATOR_911614]19,64,65. This work has been translated into humans with 
chronic motor -complete spi[INVESTIGATOR_216945] C7 level, resulting in regaining some volitional leg 
movement while stimulation is turned on10,17. These incredibly encouraging results support the utility of 
subthreshold spi[INVESTIGATOR_216946]. However, stimulator implantation carries 
the risks of invasive surgery – these risks are significantly higher in the cervical than lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  
Non-invasive  spi[INVESTIGATOR_911615], largely targeted at thoracolumbar locomotor circuits. Tonic stimulation over the T11 level at [ADDRESS_1280496] likely mediated by [CONTACT_217014][INVESTIGATOR_216948]. We plan to exploit subthreshold cervical  transcutaneous stimulation targeted at similar 
afferent pathways.  
Temporally linked ( paired ) neuronal firing can lead to lasting effects on synaptic and neuronal excitability 
through Hebbian- like mechanisms such as long term potentiation and synaptic summation66–69. These 
paired stimulation techniques include paired associative stimulation (PAS), transspi[INVESTIGATOR_1304] -transcortical 
stimulation, spi[INVESTIGATOR_216949], spi[INVESTIGATOR_216950] -dependent plasticity, and others2,70– 77. In a 
demonstration of spi[INVESTIGATOR_216950]- dependent plasticity in the cervical cord, TMS over the hand motor cortex 
was paired with high -intensity electrical stimulation over the ulnar nerve at the wrist70. When repetitive (0.1 
Hz, 100 repetitions) paired pulses were timed so the anterograde TMS signal arrived at cervical motor 
neurons 1- [ADDRESS_1280497] found more evidence for 
the highly timing -dependent nature of synaptic effects, both at cervical and lumbar levels74,76,77.  
The advantages of non -invasive cervical electrical s timulation (CES)  
Our group recently developed a novel configuration of transcutaneous CES. Our technique draws on lessons learned from other forms of non- invasive spi[INVESTIGATOR_216951]. We have already 
applied for and received FDA designation as non- significant risk, and we are conducting two other  IRB-
approved human pi[INVESTIGATOR_911616]. As presented in the 
preliminary data, CES ( Figure 1 ) comfortably elicits action potentials over multiple spi[INVESTIGATOR_911617]. CES activates spi[INVESTIGATOR_216954], targeting either  
afferent or efferent fibers depending on stimulus intensity. This afferent or efferent root -stimulation 
approach provides a flexible portal to access synapses between upper and lower motor neurons, even in contexts of damaged motor circuitry
78.  
While we are excited to test CES paired with either peripheral nerve stimulation or TMS, TMS requires bulky, expensive equipment that makes it highly impractical to use in conjunction with concurrent physical exercise. In this proposal, we will take a more  in-depth mechanistic approach to the CES technique itself, 
with the goal of establishing a single -modality  stimulation paradigm that mediates beneficial synaptic 
plasticity in conjunction with physical exercise.   
We emphasize that CES is inherently different 
from popularly used types of non- invasive 
electrical stimulation such as direct current 
stimulation (DCS, described above) and functional 
electrical stimulation (FES) . FES targets 
peripheral nerves with suprathreshold pulses 
designed to directly stimulate motor units within 
one or more large muscles at a time. Separate 
FES electrodes are required for each targeted 
nerve/muscle. Critically, FES engages motor units 
in non- phys iological order, from largest to smallest 
– this causes excessive muscle fatigue79. In 
contrast, CES targets multiple root levels and both sides simultaneously, with the goal of using 
subthreshold intensity to amplify endogenous  
volitional neural circuit signaling.  
Gaps in mechanistic understanding of spi[INVESTIGATOR_911618], the effect of timing  between 
successive spi[INVESTIGATOR_911619]. Extensive studies have defined rTMS effects over a range of pulse frequencies and patterns, in a 
broad variety of injury and disease contexts. A similarly rigorous definition of spi[INVESTIGATOR_911620]. One reproducible finding has shown that at low suprathreshold 
intensities, a conditioning spi[INVESTIGATOR_216958] a second spi[INVESTIGATOR_216959] 20- [ADDRESS_1280498] revealed important brain circuit interactions termed short -interval 
cortical inhibition (SICI), long- interval cortical inhibition (LICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF), 
respectively46,50. Using conditioning and test stimuli over a broad range of time intervals, site, and modality 
combinations, we now expect to define similar types of circuit interact ions mediating the response to CES.  
Our team is optimally positioned to address these gaps – we already conduct studies involving electrical 
and magnetic stimulation in a well -run clinical research center; and we have already obtained FDA and 
IRB clearance  to conduct human studies using our novel CES technique.  
PRELIMINARY DATA  
This preliminary data derives from an ongoing study investigating basic parameters of CES and its interaction with TMS. That study does not 
involve volitional movement, and lacks many of the basic mechanistic experiments proposed in 
the current application.  
Noninvasive, non- noxious cervical electrical 
stimulation (CES)  
We have designed a surface electrode 
configuration that effectively stimulates motor 
responses from multiple cervical levels 
simultaneously at non- noxious current outputs. 
One 5x10 cm cathode is placed longitudinally over   
Figure 1. CES schematic.  Biphasic e lectrical pulses are 
delivered noninvasively over the cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. The 
cathode is placed posteriorly over T1- T3 levels, and the 
anode is placed anteriorly over C4- C5 levels. Ground 
electrodes are placed over the distal clavicles. Depi[INVESTIGATOR_911621], photographically on right.

Another 5x10 cm anode is placed horizontally centered over the thyroid cartilage, corresponding to 
the C4- C5 levels anteriorly ( Fig 1). Two 5x10 cm 
ground electrodes are placed over the distal clavicles. 
Pulses are delivered via biphasic waveforms of 2 -ms 
duration. In our ongoing pi[INVESTIGATOR_911622], 19 subjects (5 with SCI, 3 with ALS) 
have undergone over [ADDRESS_1280499] had easily obtainable CES responses. Of 7 ALS subjects screened to date, 
5 had hand motor responses to TMS, a requirement 
for inclusion in the ongoing study ( Table 1). One 
subject did not wish to pursue further testing, and another subject presented with visual hallucinations before his first scheduled study visit, so we aborted 
his participation. Thus, [ADDRESS_1280500] undergone CES, without any significant adverse events.

(ECR, C6 -C7), triceps (C7- C8), and abductor pollicis brevis (APB, C8- T1). At intensity levels sufficient to 
stimulate both proximal and distal arm muscles, relative latencies corresponded to the distance of each recording electrode from the cathode ( Fig 2A ). The hand myotomes more directly underlying the cathode A     B             C

responded at lower thresholds than the arm myotomes ( Fig 2B ). Additionally, muscles in both arms 
simultaneously and symmetrically respond to CES in non- disabled subjects ( Fig 2C).  
CES targets different circuits at different intensities  
When single CES pulses are delivered at peri -threshold intensity, latencies to the APB muscle are up to 
3-5 ms longer than when delivered at higher stimulation intensity (not shown). When two CES pulses are 
given 40 ms apart at low intensity, the second pulse amplitude is strongly reduced, whereas at higher 
intensity, there is little to no decrement ( Fig 3 ). These findings indicate that the CES circuit pathway can 
be selected by [CONTACT_911649]: at low intensity, CES travels a longer route from afferent to efferent neurons via synapses susceptible to post -activation depression
1,6. At higher intensity, CES directly (non-
synaptically) activates efferent fibers ( Fig 3D ).  
Subthreshold CES acutely facilitates muscle 
responses to cortical stimulation 
To test whether subthreshold CES (80- 90% of motor 
threshold) could facilitate response to suprathreshold 
TMS (120% of motor t hreshold), CES was delivered 
either alone or paired such that the CES pulse arrived at cervical motor neurons [ADDRESS_1280501] (Fig 4), with similar trends among non-disabled, SCI, and ALS subjects. Since TMS travels 
via the same corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_911623], the fact that subthreshold CES 
facilitates TMS suggests that it may also facilitate 
volitional movement. This is a finding with potential for 
direct clinical translation. Note, only three different 
interstimulus intervals (ISI) were tested in this experiment. A much wider range of intervals needs to be tested to better understand and optimize this 
phenomenon.  
 
Rationale:   
This proposal includes experiments designed to achieve both mechanistic insight and demonstration of 
therapeutic principle. CES is innovative:  the delivery patterns, configurations , and subject population 
proposed here are novel. CES is practical : non-invasive stimulation carries significantly lower cost, lower 
risk, and greater ability to widely implement than surgically implanted stimulation, especially at the cervical level. Unlike TMS, surfac e electrical stimulation may be easily combined with simultaneous physical 
exercise. This approach is broadly applicable:  it could be used for individuals with other neurological 
injuries such as stroke, spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828], multiple sclerosis, or traumatic  brain injury. Finally, CES is 
compatible: it could be combined with drug or cell -based treatments to hopefully produce synergistic 
functional benefits in the future.  
 
Please note that this IRB application involves similar neural stimulation procedures as already 
reviewed and approved in study HAR -15-001, HAR -16-042, and HAR -17-017. This application directly 
parallels the protocol of HAR -17-017, but in a different subject population and funded by a different 
agency, requiring separate IRB applications .

Veterans with ALS will be recruited from the multidisciplinary ALS clinic at the James J. Peters VA Medical 
Center, Bronx, NY. After our ALS veteran population has been given first option to participate, eligible non-
veterans with ALS will be permitted to participate. This will allow for a larger pool of subjects, and will help to ensure balanced allocation among treatment groups. Individuals who indicate desire to participate in 
clinical research will be referred from colleagues at ALS clinics at [LOCATION_001] -Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_911624]. We will not contact [CONTACT_911652]. Individuals who contact 
[CONTACT_911653].gov, which are distributed by [CONTACT_911654], will also have the opportunity to participate. Participants will be recruited without regard to gender, racial, 
or ethnic status.  We will not contact [CONTACT_911655].  
Eligibility Screening:  
Persons  interested in participating will be assigned a number beginning at 1 . To determine eligibility, 
interested participants will be asked the “yes” or “no” questions listed below. Persons who answer “no” to any of the following questions will not be eligible for the study:  
 
 Do you have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or are you an able- bodied volunteer ? 
 Are you between the ages of 21 to 75  years?

investigational, observational study. As such, no direct permanent benefits will be expected.  
Potential participants will be encouraged to ask questions th roughout the process. Potential participant s 
will be informed of their right to withdraw at any time and that choosing to not participate will not infringe on any of their regular VA benefits or medical care.  Once he/she has no further questions  and the st udy 
team is confident that the potential participant fully understands the protocol  and its risks,  then the 
participant  will be asked whether he or she is willing to sign the ICF.   
 Procedures:  
General : All procedures are performed in a seated position with elbows at roughly 90 degrees and hands 
resting on a pi[INVESTIGATOR_216964]. Electrophysiological measurements are made using the dominant or stronger affected arm. Safety (blood pressure, heart rate, pulse oxygenation, peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_216965], 
and structured symptom questionnaire) and tolerability are closely monitored throughout all experiments 
(see Human Subjects section).  
Electromyography (EMG): EMG is recorded using surface sensors with 300x preamplification, 15- 2,000 
Hz bandwidth, and internal grounding (Motion Lab Systems). EMG input is collected at a sample rate of 
5,[ADDRESS_1280502] and customized LabVIEW software (National Instruments). Muscles 
recorded may include abductor pollicis brevis (APB),  abductor digiti minimi (ADM),  first dorsal interosseous 
(FDI), flexor carpi [INVESTIGATOR_4778] (FCR), extensor carpi [INVESTIGATOR_4778] (ECR), and /or biceps brachii.  
TMS : TMS is performed using a MagPro X100 stimulator (MagVenture). The hand motor cortex ‘hotspot’ 
is found w hile monitoring EMG motor response. Location of the hotspot and all subsequent TMS stimuli 
are tracked using a neural navigation system (Brainsight). Resting motor threshold is determined by 
[CONTACT_911656] ≥ 50µV are observed in the APB or FDI 
muscle in at least 5 out of 10 stimuli.  
CES: CES is performed using two DS7A nerve stimulators or a dual DS8R stimulator ( Digitimer) linked to 
deliver biphasic pulses (1 ms each phase; cathodal first). The cathode  is a 5x10 cm surface electrode 
(Natus) placed longitudinally with the top edge ~2.5 cm caudal to the C7 spi[INVESTIGATOR_18239] (~T1- T3 vertebral 
levels posteriorly). The 5 x 10 cm anode is placed horizontally over the thyroid cartilage, corresponding to 
the C4-C 5 levels anteriorly. Two 5x10 cm common ground electrodes are placed over the distal clavicles. 
Stimulus intensity ranges from 0 -80 mA. Motor threshold is determined analogously to the method used in 
TMS. Blood pressure, heart rate, pulse oximetry, and peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_911625].  
Peripheral nerve stimulation: Stimulation is delivered using a DS7A or DS8R nerve stimulator  and dual 
surface electrodes (20 mm apart). M -wave and F- reflex responses are triggered over the median and ulnar 
nerves at the wrist, recording over the APB and FDI muscles, respectively. F- wave pulse intensity is ~110-
120% of the intensity that results in maximal compound motor action potential (CMAP). H -reflex responses 
are triggered over the median nerve at the elbow, recording over the FCR muscle. H -reflex pulse intensity 
will be calibrated to result in H- reflex amplitude ~20- 25% of maximal CMAP81. Pulse width is 0.2 ms for 
M/F wave stimulation and 1.0 ms for H -reflex stimulation.  
Autonomic monitoring : In addition to standard vital sign monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, pulse 
oxygenation, and forced vital capacity, real -time changes in cardiovascular and respi[INVESTIGATOR_216967]: A three lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (UFI; Morro Bay, CA. #Resp1EKG) will be used to 
determine HR and heart rate variability (HRV); recording electrode will be in the V6 position. These data 
will be intermittently monitored during study visits. The ECG data will be viewed in real -time and stored on 
a secured desktop computer for future analysis using LabVIEW graphical software for instrumentation 
(National Instruments, Austin, TX, [LOCATION_003]). Beat -to-beat finger BP will be monitored using photo-
plethysmography for assessment of BP variability and baroreceptor ref lex activity (CNSystems 
Medizintechnik; Graz,  Austria; # CNAP Monitor 500). Impedance plethysmography will be used to monitor 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487] (Biopac Systems, Inc.; Goleta, CA.; # RSP100C). These data will be viewed in real time and stored on a secured desktop computer for future analysis using LabVIEW.  
Timing : Peripheral motor conduction time is calculated using F- wave and M -wave latencies using the 
formula (Latency M+Latency F – 1) ÷ 282. Central motor conduction time is calculated as the TMS -evoked 
potential latency minus the peripheral conduction time. These values are used to precisely synchronize 
arriving TMS, CES, and peripheral pulses at cervical motor neurons in the relevant experiments.  
Replication : For Aim 1, testing will occur over three sessions. For Aim 2, testing will occur ov er two 
sessions. This will allow confirmation of key intensity and timing parameters defined for each subject over different sessions, improving reliability of the findings.  
Aim 1:  Map the circuit and synaptic targets of cervical electrical stimulation (CES).  
This Aim investigates fundamental CES mechanisms using a classic conditioning -test stimulus paradigm . 
An electrical conditioning stimulus will be paired within 0- [ADDRESS_1280503] 
with inhibitory and facilitatory endogenous neural feedback pathways.  
CES-TMS interactions :  
• Hypothesis 1.1: Conditioning subthreshold CES will potentiate spi[INVESTIGATOR_911626].  
• Methods : Test TMS pulse intensity will be set at 120% of motor threshold (or 80- 90% of maximal 
stimulator output if threshold not detectable). Conditioning CES pulse intensity will be set between 30 -
95% of  CES motor threshold. For conditioning CES, either single or “theta bursts” (3 pulses at 50 Hz)[ADDRESS_1280504] been recorded.  
• Interpretation: Depending on the timing of the observed effect, this would support either the mechanism 
of heterosynaptic summation between segmental Ia input and descending corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_216935] (facilitation 
expected to occur at ISI between 2- 15 ms)1, or sensory cortical facilitation of motor cortex excitability 
(facilitation expected to occur at ISI between 20- 60 ms2–4). This would also set the basis for using 
subthreshold CES to facilitate spi[INVESTIGATOR_911627] (see Aim 2).  
CES-peripheral nerve interactions :  
• Hypothesis 1.2 : Conditioning CES will increase persistence of F -responses (per 20 stimuli) to retrograde 
stimulation over the median or ulnar nerve.  
• Hypothesis 1.3: Conditioning CES will reduce amplitude of median (flexor carpi [INVESTIGATOR_4778]) H-responses.  
• Speculative hypothesis 1.2: Conditioning suprathres hold CES will block spi[INVESTIGATOR_216936] F-
responses delivered up to 10 ms later.  
• Methods : If obtainable, F-wave pulse intensity will be ~110% of the intensity that results in maximal 
compound motor action potential (CMAP). H -reflex pulse intensity will be calibrated for amplitude ~20 -
25% of maximal CMAP81. Conditioning CES pulse intensity will be set between 30- 175% of motor 
threshold. For subthreshold conditioning CES, either single or “theta bursts” (3 pulses at 50 Hz)48 will 
be delivered. All pulse combinations will be delivered at a rate of 0.1 Hz, in pseudorandom parameter 
order, until 8 (CES- H combinations) or 20 (CES -F combinations) responses per parameter have been 
recorded.  
• Interpretation: Hypothesis 1.2 would indicate that CES positively modulates motor neuron excitability at 
the spi[INVESTIGATOR_139730]; Hypothesis 1.3 would indicate that CES traveling via sensory afferents homosynaptically depresses ensuing H -reflexes
6. This would demonstrate the potential for CES to 
reduce hyperactive muscle stretch responses ( spasticity ) via segmental interactions5,6; ; and speculative 
hypothesis 1.2 would demonstrate that high -intensity CES pulses traveling anterogradely via efferent 
nerve roots collide with retrogradely traveling F- waves.  
 
Aim 1 data analys is: Peak -to-peak amplitude (or F- wave persistence) of conditioned pulses will be 
normalized to that of unconditioned pulses. For each interaction paradigm, repeated- measure analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) with factors of subject group, conditioning stimulus intensity, interstimulus interval, and 
muscle will be performed. Post hoc pairwise comparisons will be made using Tukey’s method.  
Aim 1 Timeline : 
Each subject will undergo two testing sessions on separate days, with a minimum of [ADDRESS_1280505], Aim 1 participation would therefore take 2 to 15 days. 
27 subjects will be enrolled, resulting in 54 total testing sessions. A very conservative projection of 
completing 1.5 testing sessions per week would result in a timeline of 36 weeks or 9 months for completing 
Aim 1 , not including recruitment.  
Aim 2: Determine optimal CES parameters for acutely facilitating  concurrent arm and hand 
movements.  
Volitional limb movements depend on the same corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_911628] F- waves. Therefore, since preliminary data shows that subthreshold CES facilitates TMS 
responses,  CES may  also be able to facilitate volitional limb movements. The experiments in Aim 2 will 
shed light on this clinically applicable question.  
Volitional motor tasks : Maximal voluntary effort will be defined as the largest response from 3 attempts 
prior to testing. Effort will be measured using a customized dynamometer or the root mean square (RMS) of electromyographic activity in the target muscles. The tasks are: thumb- third finger opposition (C8- T1 
levels), or wrist extension by [CONTACT_911657] a mounted load cell (C6 level). A combined finger opposition/wrist extension task will also be tested. Subjects will be instructed to perform 
tasks at target effort levels based on real -time display of ongoing EMG or force output.  
CES-motor tas k interaction: While performing volitional motor tasks at 100%, 50%, or 15- 20% of maximal 
effort, conditioning CES (or sham) pulses will be delivered at a range of intensities between 30% -175% of 
resting motor threshold. For subthreshold CES, either single  or “theta bursts” (3 pulses at 50 Hz)[ADDRESS_1280506] 10 seconds will elapse between each CES/motor task combination. Effort level 
and CES pulse parameters will be varied in pseudorandom order, until [ADDRESS_1280507] 
been recorded.  
Aim 2 Outcomes : 
• Facilitation : At each muscle, the effect of CES pulses on RMS electromyographic activity over the 
subsequent 200 ms (in 25 ms bins) will be measured and normalized to the baseline RMS from the preceding 100 ms.  
• Silent period: At each muscle, the duration of electromyographic silence is measured from the end of 
the CES -evoked potential until the resumption of volitional muscle activity (defined as mean rectified 
EMG amplitude less than or greater than mean baseline activity + [ADDRESS_1280508] deviations83, 
respectively).  
Hypothesis 2.1: Subthreshold CES will facilitate  concurrent wrist and hand muscle activation.  
Hypothesis 2.2: High -intensity CES will transiently inhibit  concurrent wrist and hand muscle activation. 
Interpretation: Confirmation of Hypothesis 2.1 would substantiate the findings of Hypotheses 1.1 and 1.2 
and our updated preliminary data that indicate CES’s ability to positively modulate corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_216938]/or 
motor neuron excitability. We expect optimal facilitation when subthreshold CES is delivered at closer to 
motor threshold intensity. We do not know whether the effects will differ depending on intensity of volitional 
effort, but if so, further experiments could investigate the roles played by [CONTACT_217022], spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], and supraspi[INVESTIGATOR_216972]84. Most importantly, confirmation of Hypothesis 2.[ADDRESS_1280509] this paradigm for lasting  clinical benefit by [CONTACT_911643] -oriented physical exercise training in a subsequent study.  
If high -intensity CES inhibits concurrent volitional activity as predicted by [CONTACT_217024] 2.2, this would be 
analogous to the ‘cortical silent period’ (CSP) noted when cortical TMS is delivered during volitional 
contraction7,8. The early phase of CSP (the first 50- 75 ms after onset of  the cortical motor -evoked potential) 
is mediated by [CONTACT_217025][INVESTIGATOR_216974]7. Our observations of the onset and duration of a 
‘spi[INVESTIGATOR_216939]’ (SSP) in response to CES would shed mechanistic light on this phenomenon.  
Aim 2 Data analysis : Rather than peak -to-peak amplitude, the effects of CES on concurrent volitional 
muscle contraction will be measured using RMS. RMS in 25 ms bins over the 200 ms following each CES pulse will be normalized to the baseline RMS during the 100 ms prior to each pulse. Repeated -measure 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with factors of subject group, volitional effort intensity, CES intensity, post -
stimulus timebin, and muscle will be performed. Post hoc pairwise comparisons will be made using Tukey’s method.  
Aim 2 Timeline : 
Each subject will undergo two testing sessions on separate days, with a minimum of [ADDRESS_1280510], Aim 2 participation would therefore take 2 to 15 days. 
24 subjects will be enrolled, resulting in 48 total testing sessions. A  very conservative projection of 
completing 1.5 testing sessions per week would result in a timeline of 32 weeks or 8 months for completing 
Aim 2 , not including results processing/dissemination. 
 
 
 
4. Possible RISK S and protective actions 
For subjects with ALS, t here is a risk of falling during transfers between different testing positions. T o 
minimize  this risk , a clinician  will be at the participant’s side at all times to assess comfort and provide 
manual assistance/stabilization as neces sary.  
The surface electromyography recording  and stimulating  electrodes  and tape have adhesive backing. 
Therefore, minimal  risks such as transient skin irritation at the sites of surface electrode application  may 
occur . Areas with excessive hair will be shaved prior to adhesive application. 
Electrical stimulation involves currents u p to [ADDRESS_1280511] significant coronary artery disease or  cardiac conduction disease, i mplanted 
pacemaker/defibrillators will be excluded from participation.  To provide further caution against any adverse 
cardiac or autonomic event, the procedure will be closely monitored for cardiac or dysautonomic side 
effects with continuous  pulse oximetry, blood pressure, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_139343]. Additionally, to 
better understand potential autonomic effects of stimulation, subjects may be monitored in real time for 
changes in cardiovascular and respi[INVESTIGATOR_911629] -lead electrocardiography, photo-
plethysmography, and impedance- plethysmography.  Any change in mean arterial pressure or pulse 
oxime try of greater than 15% from baseline, accompanied by [CONTACT_911658], chest pain, significant headache, or diaphoresis, will lead to immediate cessation of the protocol and further medical evaluation. Furthermore, if cardiac or dysautonomic side effects occur during the 
screening visit, the subject will be ineligible for further participation in the study.  A me dical doctor will be 
on the premises  at all times during stimulation protocols.  This technique has received formal designation 
by [CONTACT_217028]- significant Risk (Q150053) . 
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) carries several potential risks. Most of these risks are much 
greater during application of repetitive  TMS  (defined as pulses given at a frequency of 1 per second or 
more frequently) , which will not be conducted in this study. We will be using a MagPro X100 device 
(MagVenture) . This device has FDA 510 (k) clearance (approval #K0 [ZIP_CODE]) for peripheral nerve 
stimulation, and has been cleared as a non -significant risk device by [CONTACT_217029]. The most serious risk of TMS is induction of seizures. TMS -induced seizures 
are usually focal, but in some cases can become generalized. To minimize this risk, participants with 
underlying brain injury that increases the risk of TMS -induced seizures will be excluded from participation  
– this includes moderate or severe tr aumatic brain injury, stroke, tumor, multiple sclerosis, or abscess (see 
full list under Exclusion Criteria) . Additionally, participants taking medications that significantly lower 
seizure thresholds, such as anti -psychotics, amphetamines, tricyclic antidepressants, bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], and 
dalfampridine will be excluded. Furthermore, the applied stimulus intensity will be kept below 200% of the 
motor threshold for each muscle. This intensity and single- pulse frequency fall far below the recommended 
safe guidelines delineated by [CONTACT_217030] (Rossi et al. 2009). Furthermore, 
participants with implanted devices with electromagnetic properties, such as spi[INVESTIGATOR_911630], deep brain 
stimulators, vagal nerve stimulators, cardiac pacemakers, cochlear implants, or aneurysm  clips, will be 
excluded. The investigator who will be performing the TMS protocol (Noam Harel) is a neurologist experienced in treating seizures. There is no risk of seizure from  electrical  stimulation  below the brain, as 
perform ed in this protocol . 
There is a theoretical risk of repetitive TMS causing acute psychotic or manic symptoms in patients with 
depression. This risk is not clearly above the risk for sham -TMS, and it is not clearly above the natural rate 
of psychotic or manic symptoms that may arise in subjects with depression. Regardless, this protocol does not meet the definition of repetitive TMS, and any subject with history of bipolar disease, active psychotic 
symptoms, or history of suicide attempt will be excluded 
TMS pulses generate loud auditory clicks. Hence, all participants  will wear earplugs during the procedure. 
TMS may also cause scalp tingling sensations or pain that is almost always mild and transient. This occurs 
approximately half as frequently in participants exposed to sham -stimulation. This is much less common 
using single -pulse TMS than repetitive TMS. Our protocol will use only single- pulse TMS.  
The research team has delivered TMS pulses at 5 to 10 -second intervals extensively in prior and ongoing 
IRB-approved clinical studies.  A standardized form to assess TMS side effects is used at the end of each 
TMS session.  To repeat, the use of only single pulse TMS, as well as all the other precautions and 
exclusion criteria we will follow in our TMS protocol, far exceed the recommended guidelines established 
by [CONTACT_911659]
85. 
The Brainsight optical TMS tracking system (Rogue Research) uses passive reflectors placed on the 
subject’s head and the TMS magnet to track the magnet’s position and orientation relative to the subject’s brain in real time. This is a passive detection device,  with no penetrating electromagnetic stimulation. The 
infrared optical tracking portion of the system meets all applicable conformity standards (ANSI/AAMI ES60601- 1:2005 +C1:2009 +A2:2010; see appendices), The infrared optical tracking portion of this syst em 
has been incorporated into numerous surgical tracking systems that have obtained FDA 510(k) approval in the setting of invasive brain and organ surgery. However, when used in combination with non- invasive 
TMS  for research, it is not considered a medical  device that requires FDA approval. There is no risk to the 
subject from using this tracking system.  
Study coordinators and research assistants will be trained to conduct all procedures in a safe and effective 
manner that produces reproducible results. Study personnel with experience working with SCI and ALS 
participants will supervise all sessions. All staff will have undergone the appropriate training to use the 
equipment properly and safely.  All subjects will be thoroughly questioned after each procedure to ensure 
that all possible adverse events, expected and unexpected, are ascertained. Study personnel will refer 
participants to the proper medical or psychological resources for any identified conditions or problems as 
a consequence of the research.  
In the event of a serious adverse event, it will be reported to the IRB within 24 hours and study interventions 
will be discontinued until the study physician states that it is safe to resume the study. Adverse events will 
be recorded in a data sheet and reported annually to the IRB. When appropriate, necessary medical or 
professional intervention will be provided for any serious or regular adverse event warranting treatment.  
Any unexpected complications that may occur will be discussed with the study physician and/or the 
participant’s personal  physician. [CONTACT_217040], a board -certified internist, will serve as the study 
physician.  
 
Protection against Risk  
Most of the information that participants provide will not be identifiable. Participant data results will be stored on the VA network in a password- protected file. No identifiable information will be linked to this file. 
The study team members will have a separate file of participant contact [CONTACT_3031], also stored on the VA 
network. Participants will be assured that any “hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]” of their contact [CONTACT_217032] a securely locked cabinet in a locked private office. This data will n ot be destroyed. There is minimal risk 
of a breach of confidentiality or data security.

5. SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS RESEARCH.  
The experiments proposed here address important questions in an entirely unexplored context that strongly align with RR&D’s mission. ALS is a 100% VA Service -Connected condition due to its higher 
incidence and prevalence in Veterans
41. There is no cure. There is no treatment that reliably reverses or 
halts progression. The rationally -based approach described in this Small Project In REhabilitation study 
will generate the data needed to advance this program to the next phase – the delivery of multiple sessions 
of facilitatory CES in conjunction with physical exercises to attempt to achieve lasting clinical benefit.  The 
information obtained in this study may be useful scientifically to the subjects taking part in the study and 
to other re searchers and patient s. Th is could provide new information that leads to improved non- invasive 
techniques for strengthening nerve transmission after central nervous system injury  and disease.

Lay Summary  
 
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus ) is a chronic disease that 
predominantly strikes young African American women. Because SLE can potentially 
affect all organs and system, it has a substantial impact  on the  physical and 
psychological functioning  of patients. Consequently, p eople living with lupu s must 
engage in challenging self -management tasks to promote their wellbeing. For instance, 
patients are burdened with managing an array of medical symptoms and often 
expensive medications . Patients are also challenged with the emotional sequelae of a 
debilitating and painful condition,  and are forced to make undesirable lifestyle changes.  
Successful self -management of SLE requires having the skills to engage in effective daily 
activities, which often comes from having access to up to date health educatio n and self -
management support.   
 Although self -management support is crucial to help patients to take control of their 
disease, no SLE -specific self -management program is widely available. The Chronic 
Disease Self -Management Program (CDSMP)  or Living Well with a chronic condition 
Program  is a nationwide accessible community -based self -management education 
program that contributes to improved health in people with a variety of chronic conditions.   Because the CDSMP is widely disseminated and available to the  adult U.S. 
population through community centers, it may be a suitable and accessible option for 
African Americans with SLE, even though it is not specifically tailored to SLE or to 
African Americans. As the CDSMP has been primarily evaluated in predominantly white middle -class  seniors with more common diseases (e.g. osteoarthritis, diabetes), the 
effectiveness of the CDSMP in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_549601] -manage SLE is 
unknown. This study will examine the effectiveness of the CDSMP to improve outcomes 
and reduce health care utilization in African American  women with lupus.

BACKGROUND  
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE ) is a chronic autoimmune disease 
characterized by [CONTACT_7163] -system symptoms and an unpredictable course. SLE 
disproportionately strikes African American (AA) women of childbearing age. AA 
women with SLE at any age have significantly greater morbidly and morta lity compared 
to Whites. Notably, AA women with SLE have been underrepresented in intervention 
research, which may be contributing to the existing health disparities and racial gaps in 
effective disease management . 
 
 Because SLE  impacts physical and psychological functioning, patients are 
burdened with managing an array of medical symptoms and often expensive 
medications, are challenged with the emotional sequelae of a debilitating and painful 
condition, and are forced to make un desirable lifestyle changes.  Successful self -
management of SLE requires having the skills to engage in effective daily activities, which often comes from having access to up to date health education and self -
management support.   
Self-management support is  the provision of interventions to increase patients’ skills 
and confidence in managing their diseases, including assessment of problems, goal -
setting, action -planning , and problem -solving strategies. Although self -management 
support is crucial to help pat ients to take control of their disease, no SLE- specific self -
management program is widely available.  
 
The Chronic Disease Self -Management Program (CDSMP), also known as the 
Living Well Program, is an evidence- based nationwide accessible community -based se lf-
management education program that contributes to improved health in people with a variety of chronic conditions.  Because the CDSMP is widely disseminated and available 
to the adult U.S. population through community centers, it may be a suitable and accessible option for African Americans with SLE, even though it is not specifically 
tailored to SLE or to African Americans. As the CDSMP has been primarily evaluated in 
predominantly white middle -class  seniors with more common diseases (e.g. 
osteoarthritis, diabetes), the effectiveness of the CDSMP in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_549602] -manage SLE is unknown. This study will examine the effectiveness of the 
CDSMP to improve outcomes and reduce health care utilization in Afric an American 
women with lupus.  
 
Design Overview  
A random sample selected from our GOAL cohort will be used to recruit AA 
women with SLE into the WELL ( Women Empowered to L ive with L upus) cohort. 
WELL participants will attend the CDSMP classes in the commun ity, along with people 
with other chronic illnesses. Measures will be completed  at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 
months. AA women from the GOAL cohort non- selected to be assigned to the 
intervention will comprise the usual care group. They will continue their ro utine annual 
assessments as part of the GOAL cohort efforts.   
 
GOAL Sub -Study Protocol (IRB#3656)  
Version date:  4/04/[ADDRESS_719379] a longitudinal qualitative substudy to learn about African 
American women’s perspectives on (a) the processes through which the CDSMP affects 
self-management behaviors, hea lth-related quality of life ( HQRL) , and healthcare 
service use; and (b) identify remaining challenges to successful SLE self -management 
after CDSMP participation.  
  
Recruitment and Informed Consent  
A random sample of SLE patients already recruited into the population -based 
GOAL study will be offered the opportunity to participate in t he WELL  Sub-study . 
Target enrollment will be 150 African American women who are resident  of one of the 
metropolitan Atlanta counties where community -based CDSMP classes are provided. 
[Enrollment number increased to [ADDRESS_719380] due 
to workshop cancellations and participants’ rescheduling needs (e.g., illness, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and family emergencies) ]. Each woman will have the same probability 
of being chosen at any stage of the sampling process. Thus, we will ensure 
representation of the AA female 
population in the CDSMP. The only exclusion criteria will be participation in 
the CDSMP in the past [ADDRESS_719381] Coordinator (PC) within the following 
week. During the phone call, the PC will 
assess the entry and exclusion criteria and will explain the study an d level of 
participants’ commitment needed to ensure study integrity. Interested 
participants will receive a packet with the 
consent, information of the CDSMP workshops schedule and location, a list of 
measures and study staff contact 
[CONTACT_3031] . The PC will follow up with a 
phone call within 1 week to answer any 
questions and finalize the recruitment and 
CDSMP registration. Since this study 
entails minimal risk, interested GOAL 
participants will be consented via mail, e -
mail, in person or teleph one.  
The PC will coordinate CDSMP 
schedules and locations with CDSMP 
leaders, in order to facilitate the registration of WELL  participants in CDSMP 
workshops at convenient locations and schedules. Participants of the WELL Substudy will receive monetary co mpensation for the research tasks (gift cards of $35 $40, $45 
and $[ADDRESS_719382] ,  $10.[ADDRESS_719383], or shuttle/taxi services  for transportation costs.

without computer access or those who do not complete the online survey within 2 weeks 
will be phone- interview ed.  
All self -reported measures collected for WELL participants are included in the 
GOAL survey and summarized in Table 1. The time needed to complete the self -reported 
data survey will be between 20 and 40 minutes.    
Data on Health Service Utilization (HS U). These data will be obtained by a well -
established linkage procedure that links the GOAL cohort data with the GA Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_549605] (IRB# [ZIP_CODE] ). This database contains claims data on emergency 
department (ED) visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614], including causes of admissions and ED 
visits.  
 
CDSMP Implementation   
The CDSMP consists of six weekly sessions, each lasting 2.5 hours, led by [CONTACT_549619] a small group workshop format with 10 - 16 participants. 
CDSMP clients are community adult men and women of all races and ages with a variety 
of chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, arthritis) who all are interested in learning self -management skills.  WELL participants will be referred to CDSMP at 
community centers in Atlanta. Participants will have the flexibility  to register for 
workshops based on the convenience of the location and CDSMP schedule. The 
importance of attending al l CDSMP classes will be emphasized during recruitment. 
Attendance at 4 or more classes will be considered “program completion” for purposes 
of analyses. The PC will check in with each participant about the last week’s class 
attendance at the reminder phone  call for the next class. Reasons for missing classes will 
be collected.  
CDSMP Certified Leaders : CDSMP l ay leaders are  trained and certified according to the 
Stanford Patient Education Center Protocol, updated in 2012. Leaders will be selected 
and overse en by [CONTACT_549620].  
 
Analytic Methods  
Data will be organized and cleaned following quality control procedures after each 
wave, involving identifying outliers and inappropriate patterns of missing data. 
Psychometric properties of known measures will be compared with reported properties. 
For multi -item scales and indices, we will use methods such as reliability and factor 
analyses for data re duction and formation of composite summary variables. 
Confirmatory factor analyses will be conducted to evaluate the consistency and fit of 
individual items to a combined construct. We will make every attempt to avoid missing data by [CONTACT_549621] , e.g., by [CONTACT_549622] -Study Protocol (IRB#3656)  
Version date:  4/04/2019   6 study description and encouraging participants to respond to each question.   
For patient -reported  and health services utilization outcomes, analysis of repeated 
measures data is  needed that properly a ccounts for the correlation between multiple 
observations from the same participant. Two commonly used models to analyze such 
data will be employed: the mixed -effects model and the generalized estimating 
equations (GEE) approach.60 Both approaches allow fo r covariate adjustment. The 
results will be summarized with adjusted means and 95% confidence intervals for continuous outcomes. GEE can also be used to analyze count data (e.g., ED visits), ordinal data, and to perform  a logistic  regression of repeated binary responses within 
participants . Low classes attendance may attenuate outcome change and have a negative 
impact on study integrity.  Longitudinal analyses will allow us to estimate the effect of 
CDSMP attendance (# of classes attended) on outcome  change.   
 
Qualitative component  
A longitudinal qualitative substudy will be conducted to learn about WELL 
participants’ perspectives on (a) the processes through which the CDSMP affects self -
management behaviors, HQRL, and healthcare service use; and (b) identify  remaining 
challenges to successful SLE self -management after CDSMP participat ion. 
       a) Recruitment.   We will use a form of purposive sampling to generate a subsample 
of [ADDRESS_719385] to 4 characteristics that are relevant to the research question: depression, disease activity, age and educational attainment. Participants will be randomly drawn from the WELL Substudy 
prior to beginning the CDSMP. Responses from the most recent GOAL survey will be 
used to st ratify the WELL Substudy at enrollment by [CONTACT_094] -intervention measures of 
depression, disease activity, age, and education. Eligible women from each of these 
strata will be called and recruited for the interview.   
      b) Interviews . Wave [ADDRESS_719386] 2 interview will be conducted one month after 
completion of the CDSMP.  Each in -person interview will be conducted by a graduate 
research assistant (GRA) student, and will take 60 -90 minutes. With participant’s 
permission, interviews will be audiotaped and transcribed verbatim, which strengthen the validity of  the qualitative  analysis. Participants will be able to choose among several 
interview locations at the Rollins School of Pu blic Health or Emory School of Medicine 
Grady campus, located in downtown Atlanta.  Each participant will receive a round -trip 
MARTA card (or $[ADDRESS_719387]) for transportation, and $35 and $40 for taking part in 
the two interviews, respectively. Providing slightly increasing amounts for data 
collection has been used in other studies as a successful retention strategy.  
       c) O utcomes.  We will develop a semi- structured  interview guide to explore women’s 
definitions of “successful SLE self -management,” “HRQL,” and “successful health 
services utilization,” and their efforts and challenges in managing SLE and improving 
their HRQL a nd health services utilization. After the intervention, domains will include 
their current definitions of “successful SLE self -management,” “HRQL,” and “successful 
health services utilization.” As is common in qualitative research, we will analyze data as 
we gather it. Ongoing analyses allow altering the guide in response to emerging findings.  
 
d) Analytic Methods . We will use a longitudinal qualitative design to learn about 
GOAL Sub -Study Protocol (IRB#3656)  
Version date:  4/04/2019   7 women’ perspectives of the challenges to successful SLE self -management; women’s 
efforts and remaining challenges after participating in the CDSMP; and women’s views 
of the processes through which participating in CDSMP affected women’s self -
management behaviors, HRQL and healthcare service use. We will use thematic 
methods to analyze i nterviews’ transcripts.  
We plan to work with an independent transcription service, Transcript Divas, to 
transcribe qualitative interviews.  The transcribers who work for this company will sign a 
confidentiality agreement to assure the privacy of interview respondents and any identifying information. Each participant's audiofile  will be uploaded to a secure 
encrypted website owned by [CONTACT_549623].   Audiofiles will be transcribed, transcripts 
will be returned to the researchers via this same encrypted website, and audiofiles (both 
at transcript divas and at Emory) will be destroyed after transcription.  
 
Qualitative findings will generate a deeper understanding of ho w AA women with 
SLE define suc cessful “SLE self -management”, “health -related quality of li fe” and 
“health service utilization” before taking part in CDSMP; and of how these definitions 
change after participating in CDSMP.  It will also help identify challenges that AA 
women perceived to successful self -management of SLE before and after particip ating in 
CDSMP. This aim will also explore variations of women’s definitions and experiences 
across participants’ characteristics.    
 
 R
ISKS TO PARTICIPATION  
Potential risks to participants are considered minimal. This study involves 
primarily attending an evidence- based community -based education program to learn 
about chronic disease self -management,  and answering questions.  Some people find 
answering questio ns frustrating.  We will choose questions carefully to be sure that we 
will collect only necessary information.  Demands on participants will be minimized; time required to fill out surveys will not exceed [ADDRESS_719388] the option 
to complete the surveys by [CONTACT_756], mail, face- to-face, or web according to their needs 
and/or preferences.   
 
SOURCES OF MATERIALS  
  Involvement of human subjects for this study includes the completion of surveys, 
participation in the Chronic Disease Self -Management Program (CDSMP) and optional 
semi- structured interviews among those participants enrolled into the WELL cohort. 
Surveys will be done at four intervals (baseline,  6-month, [ADDRESS_719389] 
baseline) by [CONTACT_549624]. WELL participants will attend the CDSMP 
workshop at a convenient location. Through quota -sampling, a purposive sample of 25 
CDSMP participants will be enrolled in a qualitative su bstudy to participate in semi-
structured interviews. Interviews will be conducted in -person at two intervals (pre - and 
post - CDSMP workshop completion).  
As previously discussed, the types of data that will be obtained from WELL 
(CDSMP) participants are se lf-reported data from questionnaires and semi -structured 
interviews. Validated instruments will be used to examine self -management behaviors 
and health -related quality of life. NIH -PROMIS measures will be used to assess  the 
specific  health -related quality of life domains. Self -administered data will be collected 
GOAL Sub -Study Protocol (IRB#3656)  
Version date:  4/04/2019   8 through online surveys using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), which is 
a mature, HIPPA compliant secure web application for building and managing online 
surveys and databases. Particip ants may also request to have the questionnaire 
interviewer -administered via telephone.  
Qualitative semi- structured interviews will be designed to explore personal 
definitions of successful self -management, health -related quality of life, health service 
utilization and challenges to  the successful  management of SLE. Interviews will be audio 
recorded and transcribed verbatim. Audio recordings and transcripts will be stored on an encrypted password -protected computer. Any printed transcripts will be stored in 
locked cabinets.  
De-identified data routinely collected from those GOAL participants receiving 
usual care, who meet the same inclusion and exclusion criteria than WELL participants 
(CDSMP group), will be used to enable the comparison of study outcomes be tween the 
CDSMP group and the usual care group.  
Health services utilization data will be obtained under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_549606] a well -established procedure that links the GOAL cohort 
data with the GA Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_549607]. Thus, for both the CDSMP and usual 
care groups, administrative claims data regarding emergency department visits and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_549608]. This 
includes the number and characteristics of visits t o the emergency department and the 
number and characteristics of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614]. These data will be stored on an encrypted password -protected computer.  Emory University and GA Department of 
Public Health have provided the IRB approval needed to condu ct the databases linkage 
necessary to obtain health services utilization data for the GOAL population -based 
cohort.  
 
P
OTENTIAL BENEFITS  
Participants may benefit from having direct access to an education program that 
may help them self -manage their SLE. They may gain an increased knowledge of their 
behaviors and their health, and enhance the skills they use to manage their disease. 
Results from this study may provide another option for SLE patients to improve health 
education and the skills needed to better self -manage the symptoms of their disease.  
Results from this study may also be relevant to efforts to improve health outcomes and 
health care utilization among African American women with SLE, by [CONTACT_549625], 
including patients, providers, payers  and policymakers. Findings may also inform 
broader public health policies by [CONTACT_549626], for which there is a paucity of existing resea rch; and may also highlight 
self-management activities in this population. Accordingly, findings from this study 
have the potential to benefit the broader population of African American women with SLE, and may generate results that can be used to design st rategies to manage SLE.  
Participants will be kept informed about the study progress through annual newsletters

ECRUITMENT AND INFORMED CONSENT  
The randomized sample will be mailed a packet including detailed instructions 
regarding the requirements for this study and a copy of the consent form. This provides potential participants with an opportunity to closely review documents and ask 
questions before determining their interest and availabil ity. If interested, a research 
coordinator will discuss the study further and start the telephone consent process. Potential study participants will be enrolled after a full understanding of the purpose, rationale  and procedures of the study is reached. In formed consent will be obtained 
during this telephone discussion. In some circumstances , informed consents may be 
also obtained by [CONTACT_167627], or online- based methods (RedCap).  Written consent will occur 
during face -to-face visits of selected participants to  their clinic appointments. During 
telephone recruitment process, participants will also be given the opportunity to finalize the consent process through the RedCap online system, once  all questions are answered 
and concerns addressed by [CONTACT_122440]. All inform ed consent conversations will be 
documented and stored with consent.  
The information in the consent form will be reviewed in detail and a verbal 
agreement to participate in this study will be obtained. Similarly, the graduate research assistant (GRA) will call participants randomly selected for the qualitative substudy. During a face -to-face interview with the GRA, potential qualitative substudy 
participants will be enrolled after a full understanding of the purpose, rationale , and

I. Specific Aims  
1. Through a mixed -methods process evaluation, assess the feasibility and acceptability of the ¡VMV!  
intervention and associated study procedures, as administered in a community -based health service system.  
2. Preliminarily examine the efficacy  of the ¡VMV!  intervention to improve  patient -relevant outcomes 
pertaining to diabetes and CVD  risk and general health promotion.  
3. Based on data collected from Aims [ADDRESS_991157] -intervention focus group , and 
one day if the person participates in the 12 -month follow -up testing session . 
 
B. Participants, Recruit ment, and Consent  
Version 05 -02-2017  
 
A convenience sample of 40 late middle -aged (50 -65 years old) Latino adults will be recruited from direct 
personal contacts at recruitment tables, provider referrals, and postings at the Antelope Valley Community Clinic  
and local communit y centers. If a potential participant responds to a flyer and calls a study team member, the 
screening form will be utilized to describe the study and ensure his/her eligibility.  For those individuals who 
participated in the study as a supervisor, interven er, or tester, research staff will directly approach them to solicit 
participation in a follow -up interview.  
 
Potential participants for the intervention and follow -up focus group will be included if they : 
1. Are m ale or female adults aged at least 50 years at the outset of the four -month intervention and will be 
no older than 65 years upon completion of the intervention  
Justification : This age group is at high risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_726027]  
2. Self-identify as Latino/Hispanic  
Justification : The intervention was culturally tailored to and designed for Latino adults. Latino 
adults are at high risk for certain chronic d iseases which could potentially be prevented or 
delayed through lifestyle intervention  
3. Are fluent in Spanish  
Justification : Group sessions will be held in Spanish. Individual sessions may take place in either 
English or Spanish, depending on the participant’s preference  
4. Live in Antelope Valley and do not plan on moving within six months from the beginning of the study  
5. Are enrolled as a patient in the Antelope Valley Community Clinic  
6. Have visited his/her primary care healthcare facility within the past year  
Justification : This criterion ensures that patients are “active” in the health care system  
7. Will be available by [CONTACT_726045] : A portion of the intervention is delivered via telephone  
8. Are oriented to person, place, and time as tested by [CONTACT_726046]’s name, date, age, and place of 
residence  
9. Self-report  their ability to participate for the duration of the intervention  
 
Individuals who participated as supervisors, interveners, or teste rs will be included for a follow -up interview if 
they: 
1. Held the role of supervising occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_726028] , intervening promotor , or tester during 
study implementation.  
 
After screening, informed consent materials will be sent or handed to prospective participants for pre -review. 
Only key personnel who are HIPAA and CITI certified , trained in consenting procedures, and do not have a 
conflict of interest will conduct the co nsent process. The consenter will explain the study procedures and describe 
in detail what will be expected of participants. Participants will have ample time to ask questions about the study 
and their role in it. If the individual  is interested in partici pating, s/he will sign the consent form. If participants 
are not comfortable with the study, they may choose not to participate.  
 
For the [ADDRESS_991158] manager will mail the Consent Addendum with a cover 
letter, which will (a) invite existing participants to participate in this additional assessment session; (b) encourage 
them to read the enclosed consent document; and (c) inform them that the assessor (who is HIPAA and CITI 
certified ) will contact [CONTACT_726047] a time to go over the informed consent, enroll them in the study if 
they are willing , and complete the assessments if they are willing . The assessor and primary Spanish study con tact 
will call each of the existing participants to schedule a time to go over the informed consent, enroll them in the 
study if they agree to participate , and complete the assessment  battery . 
 
C. Assessment Procedures  
Following the informed consent process, participants will complete a battery of self -report questionnaires  and 
clinical tests . The following data, with the exception of fixed background variables, will be assessed during each 
measurement point (baseline , four months , and 12 months ). Participants  may undertake assessment in Spanish or 
English, as preferred.  
 
Version 05 -02-2017  
 
—Background . Information regarding participants’ background and demographics (e.g., sex, race, smoking status , 
insurance coverage ) will be collected using a study -specific questionnaire. Addit ionally,  ongoing health problems 
will be documented (i.e., a checklist will include  selected health conditions such as cancer, heart attack, heart 
failure , hypertension, high cholesterol, arthritis, asthma, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, mental/psychiatric problem, 
other).   
 
—Measure Your Medical Outcome Profile 2  (MYMOP2). The MYMOP2 is a simple patient -centered 
questionnaire that asks the participant to identify one or two symptoms that are bothersome. Patients rate the 
severity of the symptoms as well as how much they interfere with their daily activities. Upon retest, participants 
are asked about the symptoms that were initially identified, but are not told what their initial ratings were. The 
questionnaire has been shown to be sensitive to change,90-[ADDRESS_991159] over the measur ement interval. 
Therefore, the mean degree of change across the set of self -reported symptoms on the MYMOP2 will be used as 
the study’s secondary outcome.  
 
—Block 2005 Food Frequency Questionnaire Spanish Version  (Block FFQ).  The Block FFQ was designed to  
estimate usual and customary intake of a wide array of nutrients and food groups. It takes 30 -40 minutes to 
complete and is intended for either self - or interviewer -administration (we intend to use interviewer -
administration). The bilingual format, with t ext in both Spanish and English will be used. This version of the FFQ 
has additional food items typi[INVESTIGATOR_726029]. The food list for this questionnaire was developed 
from NHANE S 1999 -2002 dietary recall data ;121 the nutrient database was developed from the USDA Food and 
Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS), version 1.0.122 A series of "adjustment" questions provide 
greater accuracy in assessing fat and carbohydrate intake. Individual portion size is aske d for each food, and 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_726030].  
 
—International Physical Activity Questionnaire  (IPAQ). Exercise will be measured using the  long version of the 
IPAQ.96 This assessment includes 12 to 27 items, depending on the number of non -applicable questions that the 
respondent is allowed to skip. The questionnaire contains job -, transportation -, household -, and recreational -
related physical activity, and time spent sitting. This questionnaire has been used extensively in  varying cultures 
and has been validated with accelerometer data.97-99  
 
—Satisfaction with Participation in Discretionary Social Activities and Satisfaction with Participation in Social 
Roles  short forms. These two scales, contained on the Patient Reporte d Outcomes Measurement Information 
System (PROMIS), will be used to measure satisfaction with participation. Each covers the past seven days and 
contains [ADDRESS_991160] been extensively tested and validated.100 
 
— PROMIS: Emotional Distress – Depression  - Short Form 8a . This instrument uses [ADDRESS_991161] as much precision as the full 
item bank (r=.977),103 while substantially reducing the testing burden on the participant.  
 
—Pi[INVESTIGATOR_288077] (PSQI ). Sleep quality within a one -month period will be measured  using the l 9-
item PSQI. This assessment produces a global sleep quality score and seven subscores: sleep quality, sleep 
latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_133527], and daytime 
dysfunction. This measure has been validated in adult and older adult populations .123, 126 
  
—Clinical Measures . Non -fasting blood sample s will be drawn using finger pricks and the Afinion (HBA1C) and 
Cholestech (Lipid Test) meters will be used to assess HbAlc and  lipid profiles (total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol, 
and triglycerides) . We have chosen to not require participants to fast at the time of blood draw. This will increase 
patient participation and decrease patient inconvenience. Recent studies have shown minim al difference between 
fasting and non -fasting values for total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol.111 Blood pressure will be measured using an 
average of two readings taken from a digital blood pressure monitor.  BMI (weight in kilograms divided by [CONTACT_726048]) will be obtained using a standard weight scale  and stadiometer. Waist circumference will be 
measured via tape at the midpoint between the iliac crest and the lower rib. Hip circumference will be measured 
Version [ADDRESS_991162] to hip ratio. Elo et al.’s Single Item 
Stress Index will be used to assess level of stress using a 5 -point Likert scale that captures general level of stress 
“these days.”104 It correlates well (r=0.20 -0.75) with other val idated measures of mental well -being.104 Self-
reported healthcare utilization will be collected including ER visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and clinic visits . 
 
—Disease Risk Scores . In response to strong interest in the study population for overall risk scores for CHD and 
diabetes, we will use the Framingham Risk Score LDL Points Total115 to measure CHD risk and the EPIC 
Diabetes Risk Score116 to measure diabetes risk. Both risk scores are modifiable by [CONTACT_726049] , and thus will 
not add to the participants' testing burden.  
 
—Healthcare Service Utilization . We will extract  data from each participant’s electronic medical record  for 
routine and preventive healthcare utilization ( e.g., number of clinic, lab, and other preventive, diagnostic, or 
screening visits) and non -routine healthcare utilization ( e.g., number of emergency department visits and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]) during the six months prior to baseline and at the end of the intervention . This extraction process 
will be conducted by [CONTACT_726050] .  
 
—Patient Activation Measure (PAM)  13. The PAM 13 is a 13-item short form tool that assesses a patient’s 
knowledge  of, skills  in, and confidence in health self -management.127 Following assessment, a patient is classified 
in one of four progressively higher activation categories. This 13-item short form has been validated as a measure 
of a patient’s level of engagement  in his/her own healthcare.127  
 
—Brief  Pain Inventory  (BPI; short form ) subscales:  Pain Severity and Pain Interference. The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_726031] a person experiences at its “worst,” “least,” and “average” severity as well 
as the pain he/she is in “now.” The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_726032] a person’s pain interferes with 
everyday life including general activity, walking, work, mood, life enjoyment, relationships, and sleep. The BPI 
[CONTACT_69506] -form and its subscales are c onsidered valid and reliable.128-130 The Spanish -translated tool has been validated 
in a Spanish -speaking population.129 
 
—Dietary Habits Questionnaire . The My Habits questionnaire measures participants’ heart -healthy behaviors, 
consisting of 3 subscales: salt intake, cholesterol and fat consumption, and weight control behaviors. The 
questionnair e has been shown to be reliable131-132 in previous studies with Hispanic adults.  
 
D. Intervention Procedures  
—Background . The intervention is informed by [CONTACT_726051] (LR), a health promotion program which has 
produced beneficial effects in underserved, ethnically diverse, older minority populations.60,[ADDRESS_991163] a personalized, sustainable health -promoting daily routine that is tailored 
to address CD risk factors as well as promote health and well -being more generally. Promotores  – health workers 
in the Latino community who have completed specialized training to provide basic health education programs – 
will serve as the front line ¡VMV!  interveners. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_356983] -respected in their communities, they are perceived 
as sharing comm only held values and predisposed to deliver interventions in a culturally sensitive manner.75  
The American Occupational Therapy Association published the original LR manual in 1999.76 A second 
edition was released in April  2015.124 An investigative team f rom the [LOCATION_008] has been studying the 
effectiveness of a LR spi[INVESTIGATOR_726033].77 ¡VMV!  is the first version of the LR program that has been tailored for late midd le-aged Latinos 
with or at risk for CDs.  
 
—Structural Overview . The ¡VMV!  intervention is divided into five units representing different content areas and 
follows the general activity -based, culturally sensitive treatment strategies of other LR interventions.60,61,68 The 
treatment protocol includes eight  1-hour individual sessions, three  1-hour group sessions, and two 15-minute 
telephone calls — all delivered over four consecutive months in a tapered design, as outlined in Table 1. 
Individual sessions, which will occur in patients’ homes or in a public location of the patient’s choosing, will 
allow patients to pu rsue their self -identified goals and to receive personalized health information. Group sessions, 
which will take place at the Antelope Valley Community Clinic , will be devoted to synthesizing individual 
session instruction, sharing experiences related to e mbracing a healthy lifestyle, and problem -solving as a means 
Version [ADDRESS_991164] with 
patients and to monitor their experience with lifestyle change.

—Content . The five educational units contained in the ¡VMV!  manual will be used to organize the presentation of 
principles and strategies to achieve a healthy and active lifestyle. These units are summarized in Table 2  and 
include: Healthy Eating and Physical Activity; Healthcare Navigation; Chronic Disease Management; Mental 
Well -being; and Wrap -up. To promote patient -centeredness, flexibility, and customization, the treatment plan 
includes standard content for all patients and discretionary content which will be presen ted to a given patient only 
when relevant. For example, as a part of the Healthy Eating and Physical Activity unit, all patients will be taught 
how to incorporate a balance of protein, fruits, vegetables, grains, and oils into meals. However, this unit wil l also 
contain discretionary content that pertains to specific diseases (e.g., self -care for diabetes) which will only be 
presented if appropriate.

Although at the outset of the intervention patients will be assigned to groups of ten, the first session will be 
individualized and, in most cases, home -based. In this session, led by [CONTACT_726052]’s 
group and an occupational th erapi[INVESTIGATOR_726035] , the patient will be able to review a personalized Health Status Report, which contains a summary of the 
most recent information extracted from his or her health records , including health markers such as weight and 
blood pressure levels. After discussing this report, the patient, occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], and promotor  will develop a 
Health Action Plan (HAP). The HAP will include three health -related goals that the patient wishe s to achieve 
through the intervention and a list of four to five strategies or activities that can be implemented to achieve these 
goals. Additionally , each participant will be given a wrist -worn activity monitor to keep permanently even after 
the interven tion concludes. Participants will be instructed in the features of the monitor and guided in how they 
Version [ADDRESS_991165] will use the information from the HAP to guide the 
promotor  in tailoring the intervention to meet individual patient’s needs.  
During the course of individual, group, and phone sessions, the HAP will be updated with topic -specific unit 
content. At the beginning of month three , the promotor  will take note of  the progress that the patient has made 
toward his or her goals and reassess various health indicators such as weight or blood pressure. These results will 
be forwarded to the pa tient’s  physici an. Concurrently, patients will be encouraged to review these results to self -
monitor any change in their health status. By [CONTACT_726053], each patient will be helped to 
adopt his or her HAP to maximize the likelihood of lifelong imple mentation of health -enhancing activity and 
habits.  
 
E. Feasibility and Acceptability Data Collection Pr ocedures  
Feasibility and acceptability data will be collected throughout the study. We will track (a) rates of recruitment, 
protocol adherence and engagement, and retention; (b) ad verse events; (c) participants’, interventionists’, and 
testers’ perceptions of the intervention and /or study procedures (e.g., perceived benefits, burden, satisfaction); and 
(d) facilitators and barriers to successful comp letion of study procedures.  
A number of methods will be employed to collect these data. Detailed records will be kept throughout the 
duration of the study. Planned documentation ranges from specifics of the screening and intake process to 
promotor  notes s ummarizing each intervention session. We will hold fidelity checks periodically which will 
require the promotor  audio/video record selected patient sessions with permission of the participant or for the 
supervisory OT or promotor  to sit in on patient sessi ons. Additionally, a brief exit interview at the end of the four -
month  and [ADDRESS_991166] two  1.5 to 2-hour participant focus groups (approximately eight people  per 
group)  that will be video recorded  to allow for verbatim transcription and analysis . Participants who join a focu s 
group will have completed the intervention, as well as all other study requirements, within the past month, and 
will be selected so as to achieve variation in sex, ethnicity, education level, and number of chronic diseases. 
Furthermore, one -hour exit int erviews will be conducted with the treating promotores , supervising occupational 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_726036] , and assessment battery deliverers.  Interviews will be audio recorded  to allow for verbatim 
transcription and analysis  by [CONTACT_726054] . 
Due to the semi -structured nature of the focus groups and interviews, the focus group facilitator  or interviewer 
may depart from facilitation guides in order to probe for pertinent details and follow up on information  disclosed  
by [CONTACT_3038].  
 
F. Data Management and Storage  and Communication  
Data collection during assessment sessions will primarily occur within REDCap —a secure, web -based app lication 
designed to support data collection for research —using a study -specific laptop. In rare circumstances (e.g., upon 
loss of internet access, participant request), assessment data will be captured through use of hardcopy 
questionnaires. REDCap will a lso serve as a secure, password protected storage database for data collected during 
assessment sessions (not including interview/focus group data) . Data that are captured in hard copy form, will be 
transferred to REDCap by [CONTACT_113640], trained study person nel. Any hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_726037]. Documents containing participants’ names ( e.g., informed 
consent documents) will be stored and locked separately from documents with participant codes. All  hardcopy  
files will be permanently transferred to the USC study office (CHP -101) upon completion of the post-intervention 
assessments and focu s groups . Data that are neither captured within REDCap nor in hardcopy format (i.e., 
audio/video recordings), will be stored on a secure, p assword protected data server of USC . 
 
Research investigators and staff located at USC and Antelope Valley will remain in regular communication 
throughout the study. At the outset of the study and at subsequent one -month intervals, a project staff meeting will 
be held. We will discuss items such as the safety and proper treatment of the research participants. These meetings 
will be mandatory for all project personnel who have contact [CONTACT_726055]. Additionally, an internal committee comprised of the principal investigator, Antelope Valley collaborator 
[CONTACT_726061], the co -investigator responsible for training and supervising the occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], and 
the project coordinator will meet monthly to assess participant recruitment; accrual and retention; data quality and 
timeliness; participant risk versus benefit; a nd the development of external conditions that could potentially affect 
Version [ADDRESS_991167] 80% power to detect a 
statistically significant change score effect size of 0.454 in any of our continuous outcome variable s (two -sided 
alpha=0.05, paired sample t -test).  This is considered a medium effect size.  In the Well Elderly [ADDRESS_991168] minimal statistical power.  Nevertheless, 
this sample size is adequate for assessing the feasibility and acceptability of this intervention and to identify  any 
obstacles that need to be addressed before a large -scale version of this study can be undertaken.  
 
B. Data Analysis  
Specific Aim 1 : Through a mixed -methods process evaluation, assess the feasibility and acceptability of the 
¡VMV! intervention and associated study procedures, as administered in a community -based health service 
system.  
 
Feasibility and acceptability will be determined by (a) analyzing rates of recruitment, protocol adherence and 
engagement, and retention; (b) monitoring adverse events; (c) examining participants’ and interventionists’ 
perceptions of the intervention and study procedures (e.g., perceived benefits, burden , satisfaction)  as collected 
during focus groups and interviews ; and (d) identifying facilitators and barriers to successful completion of study 
procedures. Focus group and interview transcripts will be analyzed using a qualitative descriptive approach.[ADDRESS_991169] excerpts 
that support each theme. Data from the focus groups and interviews will be compared and contrasted to other data 
tracked throughout the study  by [CONTACT_726056]  (e.g., adherence, participant engagement) . 
 
Specific Aim 2:  Preliminarily examine the efficacy  of the ¡VMV! intervention to improve  patient -relevant 
outcomes pertaining to diabetes and CVD risk and general health promotion.   
 
Efficacy of the intervention will be preliminarily evaluated based on comparison of baseline and post -intervention 
data collected on the following outcomes: perceived clinical outcomes related to sympto ms, activity, and well -
being (MYMOP2), pain ( BPI [INVESTIGATOR_726038] ), dietary intake ( Block Food 
Frequency Questionnaire ), dietary habits (My Habits Scale ), self-reported exercise (IPAQ), sleep quality (PSQI), 
satisfaction with participation ( PROMIS Satisfaction with Participation in Discretionary Social Activities and 
Satisfaction with Participation in Social Roles short forms), depression (PROMIS Emotional Distress - 
Depression – Short Form 8a ), stress (Elo et al.’s Single Item  Stress Index), patient activation (PAM -13), clinical 
outcomes (HbAlc, lipid profiles, waist and hip circumference, waist to hip ratio), CHD risk (Framingham Risk 
Score LDL Points Total), diabetes risk (EPIC Diabetes Risk Score), and healthcare service uti lization.  
 
Data will be directly entered into the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system.  Data will be checked 
for completeness and reasonableness.  Descriptive  statistics will be presented and analyses will inform the 
appropriateness of our intended  statistical plan.  Changes in outcome variables will be assessed using paired -
sample t -tests.  Baseline covariates (e.g., age, gender), will be assessed for effect modification.  Results will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_726057], and repeated measu res ANOVA will be used to adjust for confounders.  These 
preliminary estimations will inform refinement of the outcomes assessment battery and sample size calculations 
for a subsequent large -scale trial.  
 
Specific Aim 3: Based on data collected from Aims 1  and 2, refine and optimize the lifestyle intervention to 
prepare for a large -scale randomized controlled trial.  
 
Version 05 -02-2017  
 
Our multidisciplinary team will use the triangulated quantitative and qualitative data resultant from specific aims  
1 and 2 to make important refinements necessary to improve the overall feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of 
the intervention. We will fine tune data collection procedures as needed to ensure that participants can complete 
the assessment battery tho roughly and comfortably. Questions with excessive missing data will be re -evaluated.  
Questionnaires will be checked for internal consistency and ceiling an d floor effects and will be revised 
accordingly. Aim 3 will be complete when: (a) there are no remai ning questions/concerns from the investigative 
team about the ¡VMV!  intervention or study procedures; (b) modifications to the intervention and study 
procedures deemed necessary have been successfully integrated; and (c) a finalized research protocol has b een 
produced.

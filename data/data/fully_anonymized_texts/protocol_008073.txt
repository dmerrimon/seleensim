 CLINICAL  STUDY PROTOCOL  SYNOPSIS 
Regulatory 
Classification:  HARMONIC  1100 Shears:  Class  II in the United  States  and Canada, 
Class IIb in the European Union and [LOCATION_008] 
GEN11: Class  II in the United  States  and Class  III in Canada,  Class  IIb in 
the European Union and [LOCATION_008] 
Indication:  HARMONIC® [ADDRESS_726464] to or substitute for electrosurgery, lasers and 
steel scalpels in general, pediatric, gynecologic, urologic, thoracic 
procedures, and sealing and transection of lymphatic vessels. The 
instruments  allow for the coagulation of vessels up to and including 7 mm 
in diameter, using the Energy button with Advanced Hemostasis. 
The instruments  are not indicated for incising  bone and are not intended 
for contraceptive tubal occlusion.  
Generator  G11  (GEN11)  
The GEN11 provides radiofrequency power to drive ENSEAL 
electrosurgical instruments that are used during open or laparoscopic 
general and gynecological surgery to cut and seal vessels and to cut, 
grasp, and dissect tissues. In addition, the generator provi des power to 
drive HARMONIC ultrasonic surgical instruments that are indicated for soft tissue incisions  when  bleeding control  and minimal  thermal  injury  are 
desired.  
ENSEAL  and HARMONIC instruments,  when used  with the GEN11,  have 
not been shown to be effective for sterilization procedures or tubal coagulation.  
Objective(s):  The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the acceptable performance and safety of the HARMONIC 1100 Shears and GEN11 
devices  when used  per the instructions  for use (IFU) in  pediatric  surgical 
procedures (general) or adult surgical procedures (general, 
gynecological, urological, and thoracic) where at least one single vessel 
is planned to be transected by [CONTACT_552649] 1100 Shears.  
The secondary  objective  of this study  is to demonstrate the acceptable 
performance and safety of the HARMONIC 1100 Shears in the transection of > 5 to 7 mm diameter size vessels.  
Overview of 
Study Design:  This prospective,  single -arm, multi- center  study  will collect  clinical data in 
a post -market setting for the pediatric population (general surgical 
procedures)  and adult  population (general,  gynecological,  urological,  and 
thoracic surgical procedures). Investigators will perform each procedure using the device  in compliance with their standard  surgical  approach  and 
the HARMONIC 1100 Shears and GEN11 IFUs.  
Subjects will be consented and screened anytime during a period of 8 
weeks  prior to the date of surgery. Subjects  will be considered  enrolled  
CONFIDENTIAL  Trial Number:  ENG_2020_06 
Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_726465] one single vessel transection during pediatric surgical procedures 
(general) and adult surgical procedures (general, gynecological, 
urological, and thoracic). All enrolled subjects will be followed post - 
operatively through discharge and again at 28 days (± 14 days) post - 
surgery;  therefore,  from the surgery  date to study  exit, the duration  will be 
approximately 6 weeks.  
Number  of 
Subjects:  A minimum  of 165 subjects  enrolled (maximum of 328 subjects  enrolled) 
will be included in the study from up to 15 surgery centers globally with 
the following procedure targets: 
  
Procedure  Procedures  Estimated Initial 
Group  Enrollment  Range  
 (minimum  is 33 per 
procedure group)  
 1 Pediatric  33 – 40 
 2 Adult  General  (contain  the following  subgroups)  33 – 119 
 2a Adult  hepato- pancreato-biliary  (HPB) (e.g. liver 11 – 15 
resection)  
 2b Adult  lower  gastrointestinal (GI) (e.g.,  large 11 – 15 
intestine  resection)  
 2c Adult  gastric  (gastrectomy  [e.g., subtotal,  total],  11 – 89 
esophagectomy, Roux -en-Y gastric by[CONTACT_6476] 
[RYGB], sleeve  gastrectomy,  or biliopancreatic 
diversion with duodenal switch [BPD/DS])  
 3 Adult  gynecological  (e.g. hysterectomy,  33 – 40 
oophorectomy,  myomectomy  or endometriosis 
resection)  
 4 Adult urological (e.g., nephrectomy, cystectomy  33 – 40 
or prostatectomy)  
 5 Adult  thoracic  (lung resection  [branches,  33 – 89 
excluding main pulmonary artery {PA}/pulmonary  
vein {PV}])  
  
Every subject enrolled in the study would count toward the primary enrollment goal of 165 subjects. In addition, a secondary enrollment goal for the study is to enroll a sufficient number of subjects to achieve a 
minimum of 165 vessels transected with a diameter size of > [ADDRESS_726466] enrolled in the study that 
also had a > [ADDRESS_726467] the 
secondary  enrollment  goal in addition to the primary  enrollment  goal. The 
initial assumption is that PA branches  (thoracic  procedure group)  and left 
gastric  veins  (gastric  procedure  group)  will have the greatest  likelihood  of 
having a vessel with a diameter size of > 5 to 7 mm. The number of 
vessels transected with a diameter of > 5 to 7 mm will be continuously 
monitored by [CONTACT_552650].

 The table  above  provides  the minimum  number  of subjects  to be enrolled 
per procedure group and the Sponsor will determine the maximum 
number of subjects to be enrolled per procedure group based on 
fulfillment of secondary endpoint. Once the minimum number has been 
met for a procedure group, enrollment for that group could be closed to 
further enrollment.  
Criteria  for 
Inclusion:  Subjects  satisfying the following  criteria  will be considered eligible  for 
enrollment in this study:

• Achievement  of Grade  3 or lower  hemostasis  for each  vessel 
transection (per the grading scale below):  
o Grade  1: no bleeding at transection site; 
o Grade 2: minor  bleeding at transection site, no 
intervention needed; 
o Grade 3: minor bleeding at transection site, mild 
intervention needed, use of compression, basic energy devices  (monopolar  and/or  bipolar)  and/or  touch -ups with 
HARMONIC 1100 Shears; or  
o Grade 4: significant bleeding (e.g., pulsatile blood flow, 
venous  pooling)  requiring intervention such as extensive 
coagulation or ligation with use of additional hemostatic 
measures (e.g., hemoclips, staples, sutures, fibrin 
sealants, other advanced energy products); 
The secondary  performance endpoints  will be: 
• Distribution  of 5-point  scale  (very  dissatisfied , dissatisfied,  neither 
satisfied or dissatisfied, satisfied, or very satisfied) scores for 
sealing and transection of lymphatic vessels completed by [CONTACT_552649] 1100 Shears;  
• Distribution  of hemostasis  grading scale (1-4) for each vessel 
transected; and  
• Type, name, and number of additional hemostasis measures 
required to achieve hemostasis  for Grade 4 vessel  transections.  
The primary  safety  endpoint  will be: 
• Occurrence of device -related (possible,  probable or causal) 
adverse events (AEs).

Statistical 
Analysis:  Analysis  Set s 
The summary  of all performance and safety  endpoints  will be performed 
on the set of subjects in whom the HARMONIC 1100 Shears is utilized during the surgical procedure. The summary of all performance and 
safety endpoints will be performed by [CONTACT_552651] (pediatric and 
adult),  surgical  procedure group, procedure subgroup, and  on the entire 
pooled set of subjects.  
Sample  Size D
 etermination 
Primary performance analysis:  A sample size of at least [ADDRESS_726470] a minimum of 80% power for rejecting the null hypothesis that the rate of Grade 3 or lower transections is less than or equal to 87.5% when the expected rate of Grade [ADDRESS_726471] 94.0% using exact binomial test and a one -sided 
significance level of 0.025. The sample size estimation makes the assumption of one transection per subject which is likely very 
conservative as most subjects may have [ADDRESS_726472]. A  minimum 
of 33 subjects will be enrolled into each of the five individual procedure 
groups.  
Secondary  perfor
 mance analysis : A sample size of at least  [ADDRESS_726473] a minimum of 80% power for rejecting the null hypothesis  that the  rate of Grade  3 or lower transections is less  than or 
equal to 87.5% when the expected rate of Grade [ADDRESS_726474] 94.0% for vessels with diameter size of > [ADDRESS_726475] and a one-s
ided level of significance of 0.025. The number of vessels 
transected with a diameter size of > 5 to7 mm will be continuously 
monitored  by [CONTACT_552652].  
Performance Anal yses 
The number and percentage of vessels where hemostasis is achieved (≤ 
Grade 3) will be summarized and an exact 95% confidence interval based on Clopper -Pearson’s method will be estimated for each 
procedure group (pediatrics [general surgical procedures] and adult 
[general, gynecological, urological, and thoracic surgical procedures]), 
the three individual procedure subgroups, the > 5 to 7 mm diameter 
vessel population, and in total. The performance goal hypothesis will be evaluated on the total population and the > [ADDRESS_726476] two- sided 95% confidence 
interval based on Clopper -Pearson’s method and a p- value from exact 
binomial  test. Counts  and percentages  will be provided  for type,  size, and 
number of vessels transected, grading scale distribution for all vessels 
transected, number of times HARMONIC 1100 Shears touch- ups were 
required, and incidence of requirement for additional measures to obtain hemostasis on vessels (other advanced energy devices or hemostatic 
measures).

1.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
The HARMONIC 1100 Shears is a sterile, single- patient -use instrument used for dissection, 
graspi[INVESTIGATOR_007], coagulation, and cutting between the blade and clamp arm. It can be used in general, 
pediatric, gynecologic, urologic, thoracic, and sealing and transection  of lymphatic vessels. The 
instruments allow for the coagulation of vessels up to and including 7 mm in diameter.  
The HARMONIC 1100 Shears  differs  primarily  in two ways  from the earlier  version of the device, 
the HARMONIC HD 1000i Shears:  
1. An electrically  erasable programmable  read-only memory  (EEPROM)  with an improved 
algorithm that actively controls blade heat for lower maximum blade temperature compared to previous HARMONIC devices; and  
2. Branding updates  to the device handle and distal  shaft.  
The HARMONIC [ADDRESS_726481] undergone extensive preclinical testing to ensure that they 
are capable of producing strong and durable seals for vessels up to 7mm in diameter. Figure 1 shows  a pi[INVESTIGATOR_552644]  1100  Shears.  The device will be availabl e in shaft  lengths  of

The GEN11  supplies  energy  to the HARMONIC and ENSEAL  surgical  instruments.  It also  has a 
touchscreen for easy setup and operation, and a high- resolution display with wider viewing 
angles.  Software  updates  to ensure that the system is operating optimally  are available via USB 
memory stick. The generator uses a touchscreen display interface and has a unique receptable 
port that accepts either a HARMONIC or an ENSEAL instrument. Connectors (HGA11 for HARMONIC and EGA11 for ENSEAL) are used to enable the generator to power legacy 
instruments.  
This study  is being conducted to evaluate the devices  when used  per their instructions  for use 
(IFU) in the following types of procedures: pediatric surgical procedures (general) and adult 
surgical procedures (general, gynecological, urological, and thoracic).  
 
2.0 STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
 
The primary  objective of  this study is  to demonstrate  the acceptable performance and  safety  of 
the HARMONIC 1100 Shears  and GEN11  devices  when used per the IFUs  in pediatric  surgical  
CONFIDENTIAL  Study  Number:  ENG_2020_06

 procedures (general) or adult surgical procedures (general, gynecological, urological, and 
thoracic)  where  at least  one single  vessel is planned to be transected by [CONTACT_552649]  1100 
Shears.  
The secondary  objective of this study  is to demonstrate  the acceptable performance  and safety 
of the HARMONIC 1100 Shears in the transection of > 5 to 7 mm diameter size vessels. 
2.1 PRIMARY  PERFORMANCE  ENDPOINT  
A hemostasis  grading  scale  was adapted from Siegel  et al.1 The primary  performance 
endpoint will be: 
• Achievement  of Grade  3 or lower  hemostasis  for each vessel transection (per the 
grading scale below):  
o Grade  1: no bleeding at transection site; 
o Grade  2: minor  bleeding at transection site, no intervention  needed;  
o Grade 3: minor bleeding at transection site, mild intervention needed, use of 
compression,  basic  energy  devices  (monopolar  and/or  bipolar)  and/or  touch- 
ups with HARMONIC 1100 Shears; or  
o Grade 4: significant bleeding (e.g., pulsatile blood flow, venous pooling) 
requiring intervention such  as extensive coagulation or ligation  with use of 
additional hemostatic measures (e.g., hemoclips, staples, sutures, fibrin sealants, other advanced energy products). 
2.2 SECONDARY  PERFORMANCE  ENDPOINTS  
The secondary  performance endpoints  will be: 
• Distribution  of 5-point  scale  scores  for sealing and transection of lymphatic  vessels 
completed  by [CONTACT_552656] 1100  Shears.  The scale will be a 5- point scale (very 
dissatisfied,  dissatisfied, neither  satisfied  or dissatisfied,  satisfied, or very satisfied) 
asking how satisfied the surgeon was with the use of the device for the task;  
• Distribution  of hemostasis  grading  scale (1-4) for each vessel transected;  and 
• Type,  name,  and number  of additional hemostasis measures  required to achieve 
hemostasis for Grade 4 vessel transections.  
2.3 SAFETY  E
 NDPOINT  
The primary  safety  endpoint  will be occurrence of device- related (possible,  probable  or 
causal) adverse events (AEs).  
2.4 ADDITIONAL  KEY DATA  COLLECTED  
Additional key data collected for evaluation in this study  are: 
• Procedure  duration;

setting for the pediatric population (general surgical procedures) and adult population 
(general,  gynecological, urological, and thoracic surgical procedures). Investigators will 
perform  each  procedure using the device  in compliance  with their standard  surgical  approach 
and the HARMONIC [ADDRESS_726483] one single vessel transection during pediatric surgical 
procedures (general) and adult surgical procedures (general, gynecological, urological, and thoracic). All subjects enrolled will be followed post -operatively through discharge and again 
at 28 days (± 14 days) post -surgery; therefore, from the surgery date to study exit, the 
duration will be approximately 6 weeks.  
3.2 STUDY  POPULATION 
3.2.1  Enrollment  
Subjects will be recruited from the investigators’ existing patient population who plan to have a procedure from the proposed procedure groups utilizing consecutive screening and 
enrollment  in an effort  to generate  a random  and representative  patient population sample. 
All eligible subjects  (Sections 3.2.3  and 3.2.4) will be considered enrolled at the  time when 
the HARMONIC [ADDRESS_726484]  one single vessel 
transection during one of the proposed procedure groups. Up to 15 surgery centers globally will be selected as study sites. Each participating investigator is expected to 
perform a minimum of two procedures using the HARMONIC 1100 Shears . A minimum of 
165 subjects  enrolled (maximum of 328 subjects  enrolled) will be included in the study  with 
the following procedure targets:

subjects. In addition, a secondary enrollment goal for the study is to enroll a sufficient 
number of subjects to achieve a minimum of 165 vessels transected with a diameter size of > 5 to 7 mm based on surgeon determination. Each discreet vessel transected 
measuring > 5 to 7 mm in diameter (per surgeon assessment) would count toward the 
secondary enrollment goal in addition to the primary enrollment. The initial assumption is 
that PA branches (thoracic procedure group) and left gastric veins (gastric pr ocedure 
group) will have the greatest likelihood of having a vessel with a diameter size of > 5 to 7  
mm. The  number  of vessels  transected with a diameter  of > 5 to 7 mm will be continuously 
checked throughout the course of the study by [CONTACT_552657] (see Section 3.4.2).  
The table above provides the minimum number of subjects to be enrolled per procedure group and the Sponsor  will determine the maximum  number  of subjects  to be enrolled per 
procedure group. Once the minimum number has been met for a procedure group, enrollment for that group could be closed to further enrollment.

3.6 STUDY  PROCEDURES  
3.6.1  Visit  1 – Screening (may  occur  over visits within  8 weeks of Visit  2 including 
up to the day of the procedure)  
Prospective  subjects  will be provided with the study  information including the ICD. The 
subject must be given ample time to review and sign the ICD. The screening activities 
noted in Section 3.5 will occur prior to the study procedure.  
3.6.2  Visit  2 – Procedure  Through Discharge 
Pre-procedure  
The following  must  be obtained prior to the surgical  procedure:  
• Pregnancy  test as per standard of care;  
• Height  and weight  (both  with no shoes);  
• Updates  to concomitant  medication and medical/surgical/smoking history;  and 
• Confirm  inclusion  and exclusion criteria.  
Intra -operative  and Post -operative  
Data  collected during and after the procedure  as defined in Section 3.4. 
3.6.3  Visit  3 – Post -procedure Follow -up 
After  the date of surgery,  subjects  will have a follow- up visit approximately  28 days  (± 14 
days) later. This visit can be either an office visit or a telephone follow- up. Data to be 
collected is defined in Section 3.5.  
3.6.4  Unscheduled Visit(s)  
Any unscheduled visit between Visit 2  and Visit 3 will be documented including  the reason 
for the visit. This visit can be either an office visit or a telephone follow -up. Data to be 
collected is listed in Section 3.5.  
3.6.5  Vessel  Image Capture  
The preferred image  should be captured during the primary procedure  at Visit 2 where  the 
vessel (or the tissue bundle containing the vessel) is below the open jaw of the 
HARMONIC  [ADDRESS_726497] the entire length of the jaw of the HARMONIC 1100 Shears in view. The image will be uploaded to the electronic database capture (EDC) system as 
either a jpeg or pdf file. The Sponsor will determine if the image is analyzable and then 
each image will be reviewed and have a vessel size determined (if measurement is 
feasible) to the nearest quarter decimal (e.g., 5.0 mm, 5.25 mm, 5.50 mm, etc.) by [CONTACT_552663]. No 
reconciliation will be performed between the surgeon determination of vessel size (see

radiographs; device accountability records; photographic negatives; and records kept at 
the investigation site, at the laboratories and at other departments involved in the clinical 
investigation. Source document worksheets may also be used to facilitate data collection 
and entry into eCRFs.  
Source documents must be retained by [CONTACT_340530]’s study 
record. The information in the source documents is used to complete the eCRFs. All 
information captured on the eCRFs should be completely and accurately supported in 
sourc e documentation.  Any additional information relevant  to the study  should be included 
in the source documents. Any deviations from the study protocol or procedures should be recorded in the source documents. The Investigator will retain originals of all source 
documents, subject consent forms, and study data per site policy.  
4.1.2  Electronic Data  Capture 
An EDC system will be utilized by [CONTACT_212644]  (medical  records  and/or  source document  worksheets)  onto common  eCRFs.  This 
system is a web -based, secure electronic software application (Medidata® Rave, [ADDRESS_726499]. 9
th Floor, NY, NY [ZIP_CODE]). This system was designed and is developed and 
maintained by  [CONTACT_212645] a manner that is  compliant with national and international GCP 
data protection/data privacy and electronic record/electronic signature (e.g., 21 Code of 
Federal Regulations Part 11) regulatory requirements. The EDC system will be used to 
facilitate the collection of all study data at the site. Designated site personnel will be 
responsible for entering subject data into the EDC system. All external and Sponsor 
internal users will be  trained on  the EDC application at a level dependent on their planned 
function. An EDC digital User Manual will be available under the help menu within the 
Medidata® Rave website to assist in the collection and entry of source data into the 
electronic casebook.

 4.1.4  Data  Correction 
Required data corrections  to eCRFs  will be prompted  via automated  electronic  edit checks 
and/or queries manually created by [CONTACT_340533]. The change(s), individual making 
the change(s), and time the change(s) was made to the eCRFs will be automatically 
captured in the audit trail within Medidata® Rave.  
4.1.[ADDRESS_726500]’s office 
and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_497047]. These inspections 
are to verify  adherence to the protocol,  integrity  of the data being captured  on the eCRFs, 
and compliance with applicable regulations. 
Subject  study  records  will be maintained  in a confidential manner. Study  reports  will not 
identify subjects by [CONTACT_2300]. These reports may be submitted to regulatory authorities.  
If custody  of the records  is transferred, notice  of such a transfer  should be given to the 
Sponsor no later than 10 working days before the transfer occurs. 
4.2 MEDICAL  DICTIONARY  CODING 
Medical dictionary coding of medical history and verbatim AEs captured on eCRFs will be performed using a coding thesaurus algorithm. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA) will be used  after data entry  and query  resolution,  via auto- encoding  and 
interactive coding processes.  
4.3 DATA  QUALITY  ASSURANCE  
Steps to be taken to assure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of qualified investigators and appropriate sites, review of protocol procedures with the Investigator  and associated personnel prior  to the study,  and periodic  monitoring visits  by [CONTACT_429].  The Sponsor  will review  eCRFs  for accuracy and completeness  during either  onsite 
or offsite monitoring visits; any discrepancies will be resolved with the Investigator or 
designees, as appropriate.  
4.3.1  Site Personnel  Training 
Prior  to screening subjects  for this study, any  relevant  study  staff will be trained on study 
execution,  data collection,  and procedures  specific  to this clinical protocol,  as applicable.  
4.3.2  Monitoring  
This study  will be monitored by [CONTACT_212657]:  
• The r
ights  and well-being  of the subjects  are protected;  
• The reported study  data is accurate,  complete,  and verifiable  from source 
documents; and

and the audit plan for this study.  
4.4 PROTOCOL  DEVIATIONS  
A deviation (any activity conducted outside the parameters established by [CONTACT_760]) can 
be identified from a number of sources. Potential sources for identification of deviations  
include,  but are not limited  to: a member  of the Investigator’s  staff, a Sponsor representative 
during monitoring visits, or a member of the data management or statistical groups when 
entering or analyzing data. Regardless of the source, it is crucial to document the deviation 
within source documentation. Protocol deviations will be captured in the eCRFs. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_497048]/EC as required by [CONTACT_1201]/EC procedures.  
 
5.0 STATISTICAL  METHODS  PLANNED IN THE PROTOCOL  AND 
DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE  
 
The Sponsor  will be responsible for the analysis  of data  from this protocol.  A detailed Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP) will be written and approved prior to final database lock. The SAP will 
describe all planned analyses based on the statistical design of this study and the subsequent 
data collected. A brief overview of key statistical analyses is provided below.  
5.[ADDRESS_726502] one single vessel.  
5.3 INTERVAL  WINDOWS  
Interval  windows  for the purpose of analysis  in this study will not be defined outside of those 
already specified in the protocol for visit scheduling as the collection of data for the primary 
and secondary performance endpoints occurs intra- operatively. The final visit occurs 
approximately 4 weeks after surgery,  thus no interval  windows need to be defined given the 
absence of long- term follow -up in this study. The Schedule of Events specifies a window of 
14 days around the scheduling of the 4 -week follow -up visit, and any information entered in 
the eCRFs at this visit will correspond to the 4- week visit. There will be no assigning of 
observations to time points outside of the visit to which they are recorded in the eCRFs.

 5.4 PRIMARY  AND SECONDARY  ENDPOINTS  AND ASSOCIATED  HYPOTHESES  
All study  endpoints  are described in Section 2.1 through Section 2.4. The following 
hypothesis will be evaluated for the primary endpoint: 
H0: p ≤ 87.5% 
H1: p > 87.5%  
Where p is the percentage of transections achieving a Grade 3 or lower hemostasis rating 
and 87.5% is set as a performance goal for the lower bound of acceptable hemostasis. A 
two-sided 95% confidence interval  will be calculated for p based  on the sample  proportion of 
transections where Grade [ADDRESS_726503] Binomial methods proposed by [CONTACT_94532] -Pearson and the lower limit of this confidence interval will be 
compared to 87.5% to evaluate the above hypotheses. A p- value will be determined based 
on an exact binomial test. The null hypothesis will be rejected if the lower limit of the 
confidence interval is greater than 87.5%.  
Given that multiple transections per subject may occur, a sensitivity analysis will be 
performed using an appropriate method to account for the potential correlation among the outcomes  of multiple  transections  within  the same  subject.  Complete  details  of this approach 
will be provided in the SAP.  
The hypothesis  and evaluation of hypothesis  for the secondary  endpoint  for the proportion of 
vessels transected of diameter size > 5 to 7 mm with hemostasis grade 3 or lower will be 
similar to the primary endpoint as described above.  
5.5 LEVELS OF SIGNIFICANCE  
The hypotheses above will be evaluated using a one- sided significance level of 0.025. 
Estimation  of all additional  endpoints  will be performed  using two-sided 95% confidence 
intervals.  
5.[ADDRESS_726504] one vessel. The summary of all primary and secondary performance and 
safety endpoints will be performed by [CONTACT_552651] (pediatric and adult), surgical 
procedure group, procedure subgroup, and on the entire pooled set of subjects. The 
hypotheses  described in Section 5.4 will be evaluated on the pooled set of  subjects and the > 
5 to 7 mm diameter vessel population. The > 5 to 7 mm diameter vessel population will be 
based off the surgeon determination of the vessel size.  
5.7 SAMPLE SIZE  JUSTIFICATION  
Primary performance analysis:  A s ample size of at least [ADDRESS_726505] a 
minimum of 80% power for rejecting the null hypothesis that the rate of Grade 3 or lower 
transections is less than or equal to 87.5% when the expected rate of Grade [ADDRESS_726506] 94.0% using an exact binomial test and an one -sided significance 
level of 0.025. This sample size estimation makes the assumption of one transection per subject which is likely  very conservative as most  subjects  may have [ADDRESS_726507].  
CONFIDENTIAL  Study  Number:  ENG_2020_06 
Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_726508] enrollment is planned to account for 
dropout. A  minimum of 33 subjects  will be enrolled into each of  the five individual procedure 
subgroups.  
The performance goal of 87.5% was selected to represent a minimum acceptable level of 
clinical performance across all procedure groups. A recent energy study2 with t he same 
hemostasis endpoint in similar procedure groups showed point estimates of the primary endpoint ranging from 94.2% to 100.0%. The 95% confidence interval for the lowest 
performing group had a lower bound of 89.3%, thus selection of 87.5% represents a less 
than 2% region of indifference for maintaining average acceptable  performance.  In the recent 
study, average performance across all groups was 96.2% and selection of 87.5% as the 
performance goal corresponds to a noninferiority margin of 8.7% which is less than the 
commonly chosen value of 10%. Finally, consideration of the performance goal of 87.5% in 
the context of the relative reduction from the overall average performance  of 96.2%, this can 
be interpreted as preserving at least 91.0% of the original average treatment effect (87.5/96.2*100% = 91.0%). Maintaining at least 91.0% of the expected effect of similar 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_281056] a clinically meaningful metric for maintaining minimum acceptable performance and is actually considerably larger than the standard limits used for 
bioequivalence where the lower bound for relative therapeutic efficacy is set at 80%, 
considerably lower than the 91.0% of therapeutic efficacy that is represented by a 
performance goal of 87.5% chosen for this trial.  
Secondary  perf
 ormance analysis:  A sample  size of at least  [ADDRESS_726509] a 
minimum of 80% power for rejecting the null hypothesis that the rate of Grade 3 or lower 
transections is less than or equal to 87.5% when the expected rate of Grade [ADDRESS_726510] 94.0% for vessels with diameter size of > [ADDRESS_726511] and a one- sided level of significance of 0.025. 
The number of vessels transected with a diameter size of > 5 to 7 mm will be continuously checked throughout the course of the study to achieve the r equired number of vessels.  
Safety analysis:  From
  a safety perspective on the pooled analysis of 165 subjects and in 
consideration  of rare AEs that  may occur (e.g.,  bleeding requiring  blood  product  transfusion), 
for an event  that has an incidence rate of, for example, 1%,  then in a sample  of [ADDRESS_726512] 1 event is 81.0% under a binomial probability model.  
Thus, this sample size provides a high probability of observing rare events if they do occur, and pr ov 
ides reasonable assurance to conclude that the likelihood of such AEs is less than 
2.3%  if they do not occur  based on the upper limit of an exact  95% confidence interval  when

intervals will also be provided for procedure- related variables.  
CONFIDENTIAL  Study  Number:  ENG_2020_06 
Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_726514]  disposition will be summarized  in total,  by [CONTACT_552667] (pediatric  and adult), 
surgical procedure group, and procedure subgroups using counts and percentages. The 
number and percentage of subjects completed and discontinued will be tabulated along 
with the specific reasons for discontinuation.  
5.9.[ADDRESS_726515]  demographics  (age,  gender, and  race)  will be presented  in 
total, and by [CONTACT_552651] (pediatric and adult), surgical procedure group, and 
procedure subgroups. Surgical characteristics including, at minimum, estimated blood 
loss, requirement for blood transfusion, and procedure duration will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_552651] (pediatric and adult), surgical procedure group, and procedure 
subgroups and in total.  
5.9.4  Prim ary and Secondary  Endpoint  Analyses 
The number and percentage of vessels where hemostasis is achieved (≤ Grade 3) will be summarized  and an exact  two-sided 95% confidence interval  based  on Clopper -Pearson’s 
method will be estimated for each surgical population (pediatric and adult), surgical 
procedure group, procedure subgroup,  the > 5 to 7 mm diameter  vessel population, and in 
total. The performance goal hypothesis will be tested as described in Section 5.4 on the 
total population and the > 5 to 7 mm diameter vessel population.  
Summary  statistics appropriated for categorical  or continuous  variable  will be provided for 
type, size, and number of vessels transected, as  well as for the grading scale distribution 
for all vessels transected, number of times HARMONIC 1100 Shears touch- ups were 
required, incidence of requirement for additional measures to obtain hemostasis on 
vessels (other advanced energy devices or hemostatic measures), and 5 -point  scale 
scores for sealing and transection of lymphatic vessels completed by [CONTACT_552649] 1100 Shears. In addition, these  analyses  will also be completed  for the  vessels in the > 5 
to 7 mm diameter size vessel range.  
All device -related and procedure- related AEs reported during the study will be coded to 
MedDRA.  All AEs will be summarized  by [CONTACT_552668] (pediatric and adult), surgical procedure group, procedure subgroup, and in total. Separate summaries will be provided for device- related and 
procedure -related AEs. Serious AEs will be summarized in a similar manner. In addition, 
these analyses will also be completed for the vessels in the > [ADDRESS_726516] a 
medical history of treatment for cancer (e.g. chemotherapy or radiation) and may be performed for additional groups pending the distributions of baseline demographic or

undesirable medical experience or worsening of a pre -existing condition, which occurs 
throughout the duration of the clinical study.  
6.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
It is the Investigator’s  responsibility  to determine  the “seriousness”  of a reportable AE. 
A SAE is defined as an AE (as defined in Section 6.1.1)  that results  in any of the following:  
• Death;  
• A life-threatening illness  or injury;  
• A permanent  impairment  of a body  structure  or a body  function;  
• Required in-patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10909];  
• Resulted in medical  or surgical  intervention to prevent  life-threatening illness  or 
injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function;  
• Led to a fetal distress,  fetal death,  or a congenital  abnormality  or birth defect.  
Note:  “Death”  should not be reported as an AE. The cause of death should be reported as 
the AE. The only exception is “Sudden Death” when the cause is unknown. 
Note:  Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre-existing  condition,  or a procedure required by [CONTACT_12695], without serious deterioration in health, is not considered a SAE.  
6.1.[ADDRESS_726518]’s medical history with a listed start 
date.  Any pre-existing  condition that has worsened in intensity, frequency,  or the character 
of the condition, if related to the devices or the procedure, should be recorded as a new 
AE on the AE eCRF, as an exacerbation of the pre- existing condition and the start date 
will be recorded as the time when the exacerbation occurred.  
6.2 SEVERITY OF ADVERSE EVENTS 
It is the Investigator’s  responsibility  to assess  the severity  of an AE. A change in severity  may 
constitute a new reportable AE.  
The following  guideline should be used  to determine the severity  of each AE: 
• MILD: A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal 
treatment  or therapeutic  intervention.  The event  does  not generally  interfere with 
usual activities of daily living.  
• MODERATE: A type of AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific 
therapeutic  intervention.  The event  interferes  with usual  activities  of daily living, 
causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the 
CONFIDENTIAL  Study  Number:  ENG_2020_06 
Version: Amendment 3  Page  34 of 36 
17 MAY 2023   
 research  participant.  
• SEVERE: A type of AE that interrupts  usual  activities  of daily living,  or significantly 
affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
6.3 RELATIONSHIP  OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
It is the  Investigator’s  responsibility to assess  the relationship of a  reportable AE (as  defined 
in Section 6.1.1).  Only AEs that have  a relationship considered possible,  probable,  or causal 
to the study procedures or either of the HARMONIC 1100 Shears or GEN11 devices are to 
be recorded in the eCRF and reported to the Sponsor.  
The following  guidelines  should be used in determining the relationship of an AE in the study:  
• Not related – Relationship  to the procedures  or device can be excluded when:  
o The event  is not a known  side effect  of the product  category  the device 
belongs to or of similar devices and procedures;  
o The event  has no temporal  relationship with the use of the device  or the 
procedures;  
o The event  does  not follow a known response pattern to the device (if the 
response pattern is previously known) and is biologically implausible;  
o The discontinuation  of the device application or the reduction of the level 
activation/exposure (when clinically  feasible)  and reintroduction  of its use 
(or increase of the level of  activation/exposure), does not impact on the 
event;  
o The event  involves  a body -site or an organ  not expected to be affected  by 
[CONTACT_340538];  
o The event can be attributed to another cause (e.g. an underlying or 
concurrent  illness/clinical  condition,  an effect  of another  device,  drug, 
treatment, or other risk factors);  
o Harms  to the subject  are not clearly  due to use error; or 
o To establish the non-relatedness,  not all  the criteria  listed  above might be 
met at the same  time,  depending on the type of device/procedure  and the 
event.  
• Possible –  The relationship with the use of the device is weak but cannot be ruled 
out completely. Alternative causes are also possible (e.g. an underlying or 
concurrent illness/condition and/or an effect of another device, drug, or treatment). 
Cases  where relatedness  cannot  be assessed or no information has been  obtained 
should also be classified as possible. 
• Probable – The relationship with the use of the device seems relevant and/or the 
event  cannot  reasonably  be explained by [CONTACT_239062],  but additional  information 
may be obtained.  
• Causal  relationship – The event  is associated with the device  or with procedures 
beyond reasonable doubt when:  
o The event  is a known side effect  of the product  category  the device belongs 
to or of similar devices and procedures;  
o The event  has a temporal  relationship with the device uses/application or 
CONFIDENTIAL  Study  Number:  ENG_2020_06 
Version: Amendment 3  Page  35 of 36 
17 MAY 2023   
 procedures;  
o The event  involves  a body -site or organ that: 
 The device  or procedures  are applied to; 
 The device or procedures  have an effect on; 
o The event  follows  a known  response pattern  to the medical  device (if the 
response pattern is previously known);  
o The discontinuation of medical device application (or reduction of the level 
of activation/exposure)  and reintroduction of its use (or increase  of the level 
of activation/exposure), impact on the event (when clinically feasible);  
o Other possible causes (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/clinical 
condition and/or  an effect of another  device,  drug,  or treatment)  have been 
adequately ruled out;  
o Harm  to the subject  is due to error  in use; or 
o To establish the relatedness,  not all the criteria  listed  above  might  be met at 
the same time, depending on the type of device/procedure and the event.  
6.[ADDRESS_726519] all AEs (both AEs and SAEs) considered attributable 
(relationship of possible,  probable, causal  relationship)  to the study  procedure or either  of 
the HARMONIC [ADDRESS_726520]  medical  terminology  should be used  when recording AEs.  In addition,  the 
following information should be recorded: 
• Onset  date;  
• Resolution date or date of death;  
• Severity  of the event;  
• Indication of whether  the event  is serious;  
• Relationship of AE to the study  devices;  
• Relationship of AE to the study  procedure;  
• Action  taken;  
• Event s tatus; and 
• Was AE anticipated or not (only  for SAEs).  
Data related to AEs will be collected until the event resolution, or until the event is 
considered stable, or until all attempts to determine the resolution of the event are 
exhausted.  All AEs that are unresolved at study  completion (or at the last visit completed 
for early withdrawal subjects) will be recorded as ongoing at study end.

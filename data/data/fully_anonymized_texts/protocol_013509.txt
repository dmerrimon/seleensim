Study objectives The primary objective of this study is to:
Dem onstrate whether, in addition to standard of care (SoC), 
finerenone issuperior to placebo in delaying the time to first occurrence 
of cardiovascular (CV) mortality and morbidity in subjects with type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and the clinical diagnosi s of diabetic kidney 
disease (DKD). 
The secondary objectives of this study are to determine whether, in addition

eGFR level at the Screening Visit: a lower dose of 10 mg OD i feGFR was 
betw een 25 to < 60 mL /min/1.73m², or the higher (target) dose of 20 mg OD if 
eGFR was ≥60 mL /min/1.73m².  Study drug may be up -titrated from Visit 2 
(Month 1) onwards provided potassium is ≤4.8mmo l/L and eGFR decrease is 
less than 30% below  the value last measured.  Down -titration or interruption of 
study drug is permitted at any time during the study for safety reasons.

Protocol amendment summary of changes
Amendment 4 ( 12 MAR 2019)
This amendment is considered to be nonsubstantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 
10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European 
Union because it neither significantl y impacts the safet y or ph ysical/mental integrit y of 
participants nor the scientific value of the stud y.
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:
This amendment summarizes minor changes in the conduct of the stud y and planned anal yses. 
The main change is that the PT V isit will be performed as a telephone contact [CONTACT_643029]- study . The PT V isit is to be performed 
within 4 weeks + 5days after last study  drug intake for those patie nts still on treatment at the 
EOS V isit (Sections 9.1, 9.2.10, and 9.2.11). The rationale f or the change is that a telephone 
call 
is considered adequate to inquire about possible AEs and concomitant medication usage. 
This change neither compromises patient safet y nor scientific value. The performance as a 
telephone contact [CONTACT_643030], sites, and the sponsor. Procedures that 
would require the presence of the patient at the study  site have been adapted accordingly . The 
following activities will no longer be performed: phy sical examination, ECG, recording of 
body  weight and vital signs, and laboratory  sampling.
All other minor changes with their brief rationale are summarized in the table below.

subjects who did not immediately start 
with study drug treatment at

follow the intent- to-treat principle.

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse 
eventsNew definition of treatment -
emergent AEs.The definition of TEAEs was specified to 
account for permitted study drug 
interruptions (i.e. temporary 
discontinuations) which may occur over 
extended periods.
[IP_ADDRESS] Laborator y 
dataSpecification regarding 
interru ption of study treatment.This was updated to consider treatment 
interruptions in a similar manner as done 
for the AE presentation.

Decrease in 
eGFR
[IP_ADDRESS] Laborator y 
dataDeletion of the following 
analyses:
Absolute value of serum 
potassium >5.0 mmol/L
Relative decrease from 
baseline in eGFR of ≥25%
Increase from baseline in 
serum creatinine >0.3 mg/dL 
and >0.5 mg/dLPatients remain on study drug treatment
with potassium values up to 5.5 mmol/L. 
Safety specific information will be 
obtained by [CONTACT_643031] >5.5 mmol/L (moderate 
hyperkalemia) and >6.0 mmol/L (severe 
hyperkalemia) for serum potassium.
In this long -term trial relative eGFR 
decrease from baseline ≥ 25% does not 
provide clinically relevant information. The 
same applies to analyses of change in 
serum creatinine, which is already 
incorporated in the currently planned 
analyses of change in eGFR.
Throughout Section 
10 Statistical 
methods and 
determination of 
sample sizeMore precise wording. Specifications chang ed for correctness.
Where applicable Minor editorial and typographical 
errors, updated information on 
responsible persons.Unsubstantial changes for correctness.

3. Introduction
3.1 Background
Diabetic kidney  disease (DKD) is the most frequent cause of end -stage renal disease (ESRD) 
in western countries (1). In addition, the risk of cardiovascular (C V) disease and death 
increases in patients with DKD with decreasing glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and 
increasing albuminuria levels (2, 3).
As the ty pe 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) population rapi[INVESTIGATOR_642994] d within 
the next y ears (4),and with it the DKD population, there is an increasing need for new 
therapeutic agents that effectivel y target underl ying disease mechanisms and slow or halt the 
progression of kidney  disease, whilst also addressing the high CV morbidity  and mortality  in 
this populat ion.
DKD is a clinical sy ndrome affecting individuals with diabetes that is characterized by  
[CONTACT_643033] 2 occasions separated by  3 to 6 months (5). DKD is usuall y 
accompanied by  [CONTACT_144376], progressive rise in proteinuria, and decline in renal function (3). 
DKD is categorized based on the level of urinary
 albumin excretion (UAE), either 
high albuminuria (formerl y micro -albuminuria, urinary  albumin -to-creatinine ratio [UACR] 
30to<300 mg/g) or very high albuminuria (formerly  macro -albuminuria, UACR ≥ 300 mg/g).
As indicated in Figure 3–1, increased UAE and decreased GFR are both associated with a 
worse prognosis , with an increase in all -cause and CV mortality . Additionally , increased UAE 
and decreased GFR are also risk factors for ESRD, acute kidney  injury  and progressive CKD, 
independent of each other and of other cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in gen eral as 
well as in high- risk populations ( 2, 6, 7) .

Interventions to improve outcomes related to DKD focus on reducing risk ( Figure 3–2), 
including counseling on lifesty le modifications (i.e. smoking cessation and dietary  
modifications to reduce proteinuria and aid in weight loss) and interventions aimed at 
glycemic control , dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and hy pertension (8).
Figure 3–2 Approaches to improving outcomes related to DKD (8)
Treatment with renin -angiotensin sy stem (RAS) inhibitors has been of particular interest 
given the ability  of these drugs to reduce the rate of progression of renal disease, 
independentl y and in addition to their antihypertensive effects, as evidenced in the Heart 
Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial (9), the Reduction of Endpoints in NI DDM 
with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) trial (10), and the Irbesartan DN 
Trial (IDNT) (11). 
Therefore, angiotensin -converting -enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin -receptor 
blockers (ARBs) can be considered as standard of care (SoC) therapy in patients with DKD 
and are often prescribed to patients with DKD at early  stages (8). However, they  slow but 
neither halt nor reverse kidney  disease progression (12). 
In addition, in placebo controlled studies in patients with earl y DKD (i.e. patients with high 
albuminuria at baseline), only  ACEIs were found to significantl y reduce the risk of all -cause 
and CV mortality  and morbidity (9). In patients with advanced DKD (i.e. patients with 
decreased kidney  function and very  high albuminuria at baseline) an impact on overall 
survival has not y et been demonstrated with ARBs (10, 11). ACEIs have not been 
investigated in outcome studies in the advanced DKD population y et. 
Animal studies have shown that aldosterone has an independent role in the development of 
hypertensive kidney  disease and vascular injury  resulting in my ocardial and renal fibrosis 
(Figure 3–3) and its blockade reduces proteinuria ( 13-16 ). Long -term RAS blockade with 
ACEI s and ARBs results in incomplete suppression of serum aldo sterone levels and is known 
as the ‘ aldosterone escape ’ phenomenon (17). Exploratory  clinica l studies in adults have 
shown that in adults with CKD exhibiting the ‘ aldosterone escape ’ phenomenon, treatment 
CVD =cardiovascular disease; ESRD =end-stage renal disease;
RAA S = renin -angiotensin -aldosterone system.

with mineralocorticoid -receptor antagonists (MRAs) improves kidney  outcomes such as 
proteinuria (18). However, there is also evidence for possible therapeutic utility  of 
mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) blockade in conditions of tissue and organ damage with 
normal aldosterone levels (19).
Figure 3–3 Mechanisms of cardiac and renal damage induced by [CONTACT_643032] (20)
The results of several short
-term studies support the proposal of Shavit et al. that aldosterone 
should be considered a novel therapeutic renal target in CKD patients with the added potential 
‘off-
target’ effects on heart and vasculature ( 21). Nevertheless, large- scale, long -term 
outcome trials examining whether MRAs can slow progression of kidney  disease or prevent 
CV events in this population are missing.
Moreover, the use of currently  available steroidal MRAs is known to increase the risk of 
hyperkalemia, particularly  in patients with T2DM and decreased kidney function (20, 22).
Finerenone (BAY 94 -8862) is a next -generation, oral, selective, non -steroidal MRA. In 
animal models, finerenone reduced cardiac and renal hy pertrophy , plasma prohormone of 
brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and proteinuria more efficientl y than in those treated with the 
steroidal MRA eplerenone, when comparing equi -natriuretic doses.  Finer enone’s tissue 
distribution pattern in rats was found to differ from the steroidal MRAs, i.e. spi[INVESTIGATOR_642995], which showed a higher accumulation of the drug equivalent concentration in 
kidney  than in heart tissue, in contrast to finerenone w hich was found to be equall y distributed 
in both the kidney and heart tissue (23).  Steroidal MRAs are known to interfere with the 
steroid hormone receptor, which can cause sexual side effects su ch as gy necomastia in men.  
However, finerenone is a non- steroidal and selective MRA in vitro , without any  detectable 
affinity  for the related androgen receptor; sexual side effects are therefore not expected to 
occur with finerenone at therapeutic dose le vels.  These characteristics may translate to a drug 
with a positive benefit -risk ratio in patients with DKD.

In a Phase IIa stud y, finerenone was studied in individuals with stable HFrEF and mild (eGFR 
60 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) -to-moderate (30 –60 mL /min/ 1.73 m2) CKD. In this 
minerAlocorticoid Receptor Antagonist Tolerability  Study  (ARTS ; IMPACT No. [ZIP_CODE], 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), finerenone doses of 2.5 to 10 mg/day  safel y reduced albuminuria and doses 
of 5.0 –10.0 mg/day  reduced plasma natriuretic peptides levels to the same magnitude as 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407] 25 –50 mg/day . All doses of finerenone were associated with a statistically  
significantl y smaller mean increase in serum potassium concentration and clinically  
significantl y smaller decreases in eGFR compared to spi[INVESTIGATOR_107169] (24). 
The MinerAlocorticoid Receptor Antagonist Tolerability  Study -Diabetic Nephropathy  
(ARTS -DN; IMPACT No. [ZIP_CODE]; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) was a multicentre, randomized, 
double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, Phase IIb s tudy investigating the safet y and 
efficacy  of several oral doses of finerenone in patients with T2DM and a clinical diagnosis of 
DKD, based on either high albuminuria (UACR 30 to 299 mg/g) or very  high albuminuria 
(UACR 300 to 3000 mg/g), and with an estim ated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 
30mL/min/1.73 m2or more. Finerenone doses of 1.25 mg up to 20 mg once dail y (OD) were 
investigated in 823 randomized patients over 90 day s of treatment compared to placebo in 
addition to SoC, including a RAS -inhibitor. Finerenone statisticall y significantly  reduced 
albuminuria by  21 to 38%, compared to placebo, at doses of 7.5 mg to 20 mg OD when added 
to RAS blockade. All doses of finerenone were safe and well -tolerated. Incidences of 
treatment -emergent adverse e vents (TEAEs) were similar between placebo and all finerenone 
dose groups .
Based on the aforementioned properties and initial results of finerenone in Phase II clinical 
trials, finerenone has the potential to address the unmet medical needs in patients wit h the 
clinical diagnosis of DKD. When added to SoC therap y including a RAS blocker, [ADDRESS_860709] available version of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB),

In this stud y ([ZIP_CODE]), finerenone will be investigated in patients at a high -risk of dev elopi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a 
first or recurrent CV event. A second study  of the Phase III program of finerenone in DKD, 
Study  [ZIP_CODE], will investigate finerenone in patients at high risk of progressing to kidney  
failure and at high risk of CV events. Accordingly , in Study  [ZIP_CODE], the primary  endpoint will 
focus on CV outcomes whereas in Stud y [ZIP_CODE], the primary endpoint will focus on renal 
outcomes.

12 MAR 2019    Version 3.0 Page:  24of [ADDRESS_860711] s including atherosclerosis, my ocardial hy pertrophy, cardiac fibro sis 
and medial artery  calcification (25). The exceptionally  high CVD burden in patients with 
T2DM and advanced CKD emphasizes the need for dedicated CV outcome trials in this 
population (26).
Together with Study  [ZIP_CODE], which will be the first large -scale, long -term outcome trial 
examining whether finerenone can slow the progression of kidney  disease in patients with the 
clinical diagnosis of DKD, Study  [ADDRESS_860712] the 
DKD population.
An inappropriate release of aldosterone contributes to target organ damage found in heart 
failure, m yocardial infarction, chronic renal failure and hypertension. The extensive 
expression of the MR in the CV sy stem including the heart, endothelial cells, vascular smooth 
muscle cells and kidney  mesangial cells gives further evidence for the role of aldosterone in 
CV and renal injury .
Blockade of the action of aldosterone and potentially  other MR li gands such as cortisol has 
been demonstrated to be of benefit in different forms of CVD (27-29 ).  Results from several 
short -term studies show that treatment with MRAs in addition to R AS blockade with an ACEI 
or ARB improves albuminuria; however, long- term outcome trials examining whether MRAs 
can prevent CV events or slow progression of kidney  disease in a diabetic or non -diabetic 
CKD population are still lacking. The Phase III program with finerenone in DKD will be the 
first program addressing both questions: Study  [ADDRESS_860713] not yet 
been full y elucidated; however, aldosterone seems to be a key player in the progression of 
kidney  disease, and also contributes to the accompany ing high CV morbidity  and mortalit y of 
these pat ients. Potent and selective MR blockade with finerenone may  therefore provide 
protection against the burden of CVD and also slow or halt the progression of kidney disease 
in the targeted DKD population.

substantiall y elevated mortalit y rates. Much of this mortalit y is due to CVD, although non -CV 
CONFIDENTIALIntegrated Clinical Study Protocol

12 MAR 2019    Version 3.0 Page:  25of 136
mortality  is also increased. Albuminuria and eGFR are independently  and additively  
associated with increased risks of CV events, CV mortality , and all -cause mortality  (25). 
There is a high unmet medical need for treatments that can reduce the extensive burden of 
CVmortality and morbidity  and the progression of kidney  disease in patients with DKD .
The population for Study [ADDRESS_860715] individuals with T2DM, increased levels of 
albuminuria and decreased eGFR are both independently  and s ynergistically  associ ated with 
increased risk of CV death as well as CV events, compared to those without CKD 
manifestations (2, 30 ). Towards the upper end of the high albuminuria category  
(30to< 300 mg/g), the adjusted risk of CV mortality  is more than twice that of the risk in 
individuals with normal albuminuria (31).  Patients with very  high albu minuria and still 
preserved eGFR ( ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) have also a high risk of CV events ( 32) and will also 
be included in this study .
The presence of albuminuria i n an individual is highl y predictive of CV events and 
progression of kidney  disease.  In ARTS -DN (study  [ZIP_CODE]) in patients with T2DM and DKD 
treated with finerenone in combination with SoC therap y using a RAS inhibitor, a 
dose-dependent reduction in UACR f rom baseline to Day 90 was demonstrated.  Statistically  
significant reductions in UACR of 21%, 25%, 33% and 38% at Day  [ADDRESS_860716] doses of finerenone (7.5, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg od, 
respectivel y) compared to p lacebo.  In a post hoc anal ysis, UACR decreases of ≥ 30% from 
baseline to Day  90 in the placebo, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg groups were seen for 
23.9%, 40.2%, 46.0%, 51.3% and 62.5% of subjects, respectivel y, and UACR decreases of 
≥50% in the same gr oups were seen for 13.6%, 17.2%, 17.2%, 33.6% and 40.2% of subjects, 
respectivel y.  Post -hoc analy ses of randomized clinical trials (33, 34)suggest that a meaningful 
reduction in albumin uria may  translate to protection from CV events and declining renal 
function in patients with diabetic and non -diabetic renal disease with albuminuria.  For every  
30% reduction in albuminuria, the risk of ESRD decreased by 23.7% (95% confidence interval, 
11.4% to 34.2%; p=0.001) (33); there was an 18% reduction in CV risk and 27% reduction in 
HF risk for every  50% reduction in albuminuria (34).
The main risks identified from previous studies with steroidal MRAs are the development of 
hyperkalemia and worsening of renal function.  The risk for such adverse events (AEs) with 
finerenone is not ruled out.  However, in ARTS -DN, the incidence of h yperkalemia was low, 
and the incidence of eGFR decline ≥30% relative to baseline was similar between placebo and 
finerenone groups, with no imbalance in reported AEs related to the MedDRA primary  
system organ class ‘ Renal and urinary disorders ’. In ARTS (s tudy [ZIP_CODE]), all doses of 
finerenone resulted in significantly  lower potassium increase and less eGFR reduction 
compared to spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407].
Thus, potassium levels and renal function will be closely  monitored in this study . 
Tominimize safet y risks to the p atient, starting doses of study  medication will be chosen 
according to baseline renal function, and subsequent dose up -titration will be performed on 
the basis of measured potassium and eGFR values.  A 2- step up -titration is consistent with 
current clinica l practice to initiate treatment with a RAS blocker at a low dose, and

study  drug based on potassium values will minimize the risk of hy perkalemia. At any  time 
during the stud y, the investigator has the option to also down -titrate the study  drug, depending 
on serum potassium and the progression of the underly ing disease.   
All protocol -related procedures, including vital signs measurements, 12 -lead electrocardiograms 
(ECGs), echocardiography  and blood and urine sampling, are non -invasive or established 
routine assessments in the management of patients with DKD with or wit hout CVD. 
The high risk for CVD and progression of kidney  disease in the study  population of 
Study [ZIP_CODE], taken together with the beneficial results of MRAs on CVD in previous clinical 
trials and the results of finerenone in the Phase II studies all point towards a positive risk -
benefit assessment that is in favor of the participation of subjects in this study .
4. Study objectives
The primary objective of this study  is to:
Demonstrate whether, in addition to standard of care (SoC), finerenone issuperior to 
placebo in delay ing the time to first occurrence of cardiovascular (CV) mortality  and 
morbidity  in subjects with T2DM and the clinical diagnosis of DKD. 
The secondary objectives of this study  are to determine whether, in addition to SoC, 
finerenone compared to placebo:
Delay s the time to first occurrence of the following composite endpoint:
onset of kidney  failure, a sustained decrease in eGFR of ≥40% from baseline over at 
least 4 weeks ,or renal death
Delay s the time to all -cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18543] 
Delay s the time to all -cause mortality
Reduces UACR from baseline to Month 4 
Delay s the time to first occurrence of the following composite endpoint:
onset of kidney  failure, a sustained decrease in eGFR of ≥57% from baseline over 
atleast 4 weeks or renal death.

This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
Design overview
Study  [ZIP_CODE] is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, multicenter, 
event -driven Phase III study . Figure 5–1display s the overall study  design.
Patients f rom approximatel y 900 study  centers worldwide will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
either finerenone or placebo in addition to SoC therapy . Assuming a screening failure rate of

approximatel y 50%, [ADDRESS_860717] to be screened to randomize approxi mately  
6400 patients. 
The anticipated duration of the s tudy is approximately  4 up to 4 .5years: this includes an 
anticipated recruitment period of approximately  2.[ADDRESS_860718] patient into the trial anda maximum of 4.5 months for the run-in and screening period 
and 1 month for the follow -up. However, as an event-driven trial, the actual length of the trial 
will depend on th e observed event rates, the patient recruitment rate, and length of the 
recruitment period. 
Since all randomized subjects belong to the Full Anal ysis Set (FAS) on which the efficacy  
analyses are based, it is important to avoid randomization of non -eligibl e subjects into the study .
Run- in Period (4 up to 16 weeks)
Subjects with written informed consent who complete the Run -in Visit and meet all
eligibility3criteria will be enrolled into a mandatory Run -in Period, the purpose of which is to 
ensure that the subject’s SoC therapy  including treatment with ACEIs or ARBs is optimized 
and that all inclusion and exclusion criteria a re met at the Screening Visit. The Run -in Period 
will last for a minimum of 4 weeks and a maximum of 16 weeks.
In the absence of docume ntation of diagnosis of high or very  high albuminuria (see Section 3.1
for definition), the subject may  still be enrolled into the study  as albuminuria will be 
measured at the Run -in Visit; in this case, the Run -in Period must last for a minimum of 
12weeks and a maximum of 16 weeks.
Screening Period (up to 2 weeks)
At the end of the Run -in Period, a Screening Visit to confirm the subject’s el igibility  will take 
place within ≤ 2weeks prior to the planned randomization. At this visit, it will be assessed 
whether the subject still meets all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria .[ADDRESS_860719] on SoC treatment, and fulfills all other eligibility  criteria, she/he can be randomized 
into the study .

Treatment Period
Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive once dail y (OD) oral doses of finerenone 
(10mg or 20 mg) or placebo in addition to their SoC therapy .
There will be up to 4 planned visits (including randomization at Visit 1) in the first 4 months; 
thereaft er visits will take place every  4months until the end of the study . Study  drug dose can 
be up -titrated from Visit 2 (Month 1) onwards or down -titrated at an y point (even between 
scheduled visits); guidance on dose adjustment is provided in Section 7.4.  Subjects may  be 
seen at an y time throughout the study , in addition to scheduled visits, at the discretion of the 
investigator. 
It is planned that al l randomized subjects will remain in the trial until either: 
a.the projected number of primary  endpoints (see Sections 9.4.1 and 10.4) is reached, or 
b.the trial is terminated prematurely
 at the recommendation of the independent Data 
Monitoring Committee (DMC) (see Section 13.1.3). 
All randomized subjects, including an
y subject who experienced a health event considered for 
the pre -specified primary or secondary  endpoi nts, should continue to receive study  drug until 
the trial is completed (see definition for end of study  below ) provided there are no safet y 
grounds for discontinuing treatment.
Discontinuation of study  drug (for any  reason) does not constitute the subject’s withdrawal 
from the study , except if the investigator believes that it is in the best interest of the subject or 
if the subject withdraws consent (see Section 6.4.1 for details).  
Details on procedures that are important to ensure the safet y of the individual study  subject 
are provided in the relevant sections of this protocol (i.e. medical management , control of 
blood pressure and use of potassi um supplements/lowering agents in Section 8.1, and 
monitoring blood potassium in Section 9.7.1). 
Follow -up Period
The period between the subject’s last intake of study  drug and last visit in the study  is referred 
to as the ‘ Follow -up Period ’. If a subject withdraws from study  drug permanently but does 
not withdraw from the study , this would appl y to the period between the Premature
Discontinuation (PD) Visit, which should take place as soon as possible following permanent 
discontinuation of study  drug , and the EOS Visit. In the case where a su bject discontinues 
treatment at the EOS Visit, the Follow- up Period applies to the period between the EOS visit 
and PT visit.
All subjects who withdraw consent can be followed up for vital status if they do not sign the 
‘Declaration of Objection ’ form. In addition, vital status can be obtained by  [CONTACT_643035]. The collection of vital status must be obtained within the 
timelines provided by  [CONTACT_8996].

After notification of study termination, for all subjects still participating in the study , 
anEnd-of- Study  (EOS) Visit should be scheduled as soon as possible (within [ADDRESS_860721]) to determine whether the subject had an event for inclusion in the 
primary  or secondary  endpoints.
Subjects who are still on treatment will discontinue study drug treatment at the EOS Visit and 
must perform the Post -Treatment (PT) Visit (4 weeks + 5days) after their last dose of study  drug .
The primary  completion event for this study  is the last visit for the last subject.

The investigator is of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_642997]’s well -being
The randomization code is broken by[CONTACT_36705], or other responsible person, 
when knowledge of the subject’s treatment is required
Any investigational drug other than the study drug is used.
Study  drug may be pe rmanently  discontinued if any  of the following occurs:
Any suspected drug- related AE or SAE
If any exclusion criterion applies during treatment
If a significant violation of the protocol occurs, as defined b y the sponsor and the 
coordinating investigator.
In general, subjects who permanentl y discontinue study  drug are expected to continue in the 
follow -up period and to attend all protocol- specified study  visits, and should be encouraged to 
perform all assessments described in the visit schedule (see Section 9.2).
If a subject no longer on study  drug is unable to attend the clinic for a study visit, a 
telephone consultation may be performed to d
etermine if relevant health events / endpoints 
(e.g. development of CV or renal complications) have occurred. I deally , a face -to-face visit 
should be performed at least once a year .Expected frequency  of telephone contacts should be 
in line with the standa rd visit schedule, and therefore performed every  4 months. Ad hoc 
additional telephone contacts may  also be requested (e.g. prior to the interim analy sis) and 
made to the subject themselves or to other contact [CONTACT_643036], e.g. a next of 
kin, primary  physician (or local equivalent). 
Note that study  drug may be temporaril y discontinued (i.e. interrupted), as described in 
Section 7.4.
[IP_ADDRESS]
Discontinuation of study
Subjects must be withdrawn from the study if the following occurs:
At their own request or at the request of their legally  acceptable representative. 
Atanytime during the study  and without giving reasons, a subject may  decline to 
participate further. The subject will not suffer an y disadvantage as a result (see also 
Section 13.4).
Subjects 
may be withdrawn from the study if either of the following occurs:
If, in the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation of the study  would be harmful to the 
subject’s well -being 
At the specific request of the sponsor and in liaison with the investigator.
Should a subject withdraw consent to par ticipate in the study , he/she may  either:

or
Refuse to allow further release of information.
Depending on the time point of withdrawal: 
A subject who discontinues study  participation prematurely  for any  reason is defined 
as ‘dropout ’ if the subject has alread y been randomized
A subject who, for an y reason (e.g. fai lure to satisfy
 the selection criteria), terminates 
the study  before randomization is regarded as a ‘ screening failure ’.
General procedures
In all cases, the reason for withdrawal of study  drug and/or of study  participation must be 
recorded in the eCRF and in the subject’s medical records.
As specified in Section 13.4, the subject may  object to the generation and processing of 
post-withdrawal dat a.
Details for the premature termination of the study  as a whole (or components thereof) are

[IP_ADDRESS] Switch over between studies
DKD is a disease continuum characterized by  2 highl y variable parameters, eGFR and UACR. 
The thresholds of these parameters for these studies ([ZIP_CODE] and [ZIP_CODE]) were chosen in order 
to define a high risk population.  I t should be noted these parameters may  vary  in daily  life 
making the patient eligible for one or the other study .  Ne vertheless, these variations still reflect 
the disease continuum and do not alter the high risk. The reason for allowing switch over is to 
account for these intrinsic variations.  In addition, it also serves the purpose of reducing the 
burden on the subjects due to not needing to repeat the run -in and screening assessments .  
Subjects are permitted to switch from Study  [ADDRESS_860733] during the 
respective Run -in and Screening periods.
An example is as follows:
If a subject initially  enrolled in Study  [ADDRESS_860734]

7.1 Treatments to be administered
Finerenone immediate -release (IR) t ablets are light orange film -coated tablets, oval 
(modified oblong), containing 10 mg or 20 mg finerenone ( Table 7–1 ). Matching placebo 
tablets will b e supplied.
Following a Screening Visit, eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to either finerenone or 
placebo, and stud y drug will be dispensed according to the visit schedule (see Section 9.1).
The subject will receive the following:
Finerenone
−10mg finerenone tablet once dail y (OD)
(starting dose for subjects with an eGFR between 25 to <
60 mL /min/1.73m² at the 
Screening Visit) 
−20mg finerenone tablet OD
(starting dose for subjects with an eGFR ≥ 60 mL /min/1.73m² at the Screening Visit) 
or
Placebo tablet OD. 
Following randomization of the subject, the I xRS will determine the bottle number for the 
study  site investigator or designee t o select for the subject. The investigator at the study  site is 
to instruct subjects to take [ADDRESS_860738] dose of study  drug 
should be taken at the site on the same day  as Visit 1 (Day 1),preferabl y in the morning.
7.2 Identity of study treatment
Details (e.g. composition, formulation) of the study drug are provided in Table 7–1. 
All study  drugs will be labeled accor ding to the requirements of local law and legislation. 
Label text will be approved according to the sponsor’s agreed procedures, and a cop y of the 
labels will be made available to the study  site upon request.
For all stud y drugs, a s ystem of numbering in a ccordance with all requirements of Good 
Manufacturing Practice (GMP) will be used, ensuring that each dose of study  drug can be 
traced back to the respective bulk batch of the ingredients. L ists linking all numbering levels

7.3 Treatment assignment -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section [IP_ADDRESS].
Eligible subjects will be randomized within 
≤ 2weeks after the Screening Visit. The
randomization will be stratified by  [CONTACT_11338] (North America, Europe, Asia, Latin America and 
others), t ype of albuminuria at screening (high or very high albuminuria) and eGFR at 
screening (25 to <45, 45 to <60, ≥60mL/min/1.73m²) and history  of CVD (present, absent ; 
see definition of CVD in Table 16–5). The eGFR will be calculated b y the Central Laboratory  
apply ing the CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_14420] 
(36).
The number of subjects with high albuminuria and eGFR ≥60mL/min/1.73 m2will be 
capped at approximately  10% of the total population with high albuminuria at screening. The 
number of subjects with high albuminuria and without a history  of CVD will be capped at 
approximately  40% of the total population with high albuminuria at screening.
7.4 Dosage and administration -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section [IP_ADDRESS].
As shown in Table 7–2, the starting dose of finerenone will depend on the eGFR value at the 
Screening Visit.
Thus, at randomization, subjects wi th an eGFR between 25 to < 60mL/min/1.73m² at the 
Screening Visit (central laboratory  results) will be assigned to the lower dose of finerenone

following 2 options before continuing stud y drug intake:
(1)If intake of the missed tablet is discovered >[ADDRESS_860743] should take the study  drug as soon as possible
(2)If the missed intake is discovered within [ADDRESS_860744] should wait and take the next tablet at the usual time.
Up-and down -titration of stu dy drug
The investigator is encouraged to up-titrate the dose of study  drug at an y time once the patient 
has been on a stable dose for 4 weeks (± 7 day s)(e.g. from Visit 2 onwards for patient starting 
study  drug on the lower dose) either at a regular visit or an Up -
titration Visit . Up-titration can 
be performed   provided:
the potassium concentration (local laboratory  value) is ≤4.8 mmol/L ,
AND
eGFR decrease (local laboratory  value) is less than 30% below the value measured at 
the last regular visit. 
Subjects who started with or were up -titrated to the target dose (20 mg OD) of the study  drug 
but who do not tolerate this dose may  be down
-titrated at an y point during the study , 
including between -scheduled visits if required for safet y reasons. These subjects may  be 
up-titrated again based on the rules provided above. If the subject is already at the lower dose, 
the study  drug can be interrupted at the investigator’s discretion (refer to Section 9.7.1 for 
guidance). If the stud y drug is interrupted for more than 7 days, the stud y drug should be re -
started at the lower dose (10 mg OD).
Subsequent to an up-titration or re -start of stud y drug after int erruption of study  drug intake
for more than 7 day s, the investigator should perform a n Up -titration Visit 4weeks (±7days) 
after titration or restart, in order to monitor potassium levels and renal function (see 
Table 
9–1). If a regular study  visit will be scheduled to take place 4 weeks (± 7 day s) after up -
titration , the monitoring of potassium and renal function is assured and no Up-t itration Vis it 
has to be performed in addition. With down -titrations, the unscheduled safety  visit may  need a 
smaller time window and should be performed at the investigator’s discretion.
At any  point during study  drug treatment, if blood potassium is found to be elev ated, 
study drug treatment should be adjusted according to guidance provided in Section 9.7.1.
Both up
-and down -titrations will be at the investig ator’s discretion and will depend on the 
general clinical condition of the individual subject. The investigator should attempt to reach 
the maximum (target) dose of study  drug as long as safet y is not compromised.
All titrations, including the reasons for down -titration or for not dispensing the [ADDRESS_860745] be documented in the eCRF.

7.5 Blinding
Blinding measures 7.5.1
Finerenone IR tablets (10 mg and 20 mg) and placebo tablets will be identical in appearance 
(size, shape, color). The packaging and labeling will be designed to maintain the blinding of 
the investigator’s team and the subjects. The study  data will remain blinded unt il database 
lock and authorization of data release according to standard operating procedures.
Appropriate measures will be taken to maintain blinding while bioanal ysis is ongoing.
Unblinding -amended 7.5.2
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section [IP_ADDRESS].
In compliance with applicable regulations, in the event of a S[LOCATION_003]R (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]
) 
related to the blinded treatment, the subject’s treatment code will usually  be unblinded before 
reporting to the health authorities andethic committees.
In order to maintain the integrit y of th e study , S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be waived from unblinding and 
expedited safet y reporting ifit represents one of the pre -specified disease -related efficacy  
endpoints (see also Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
Emergency unblinding by [CONTACT_093] 7.5.[ADDRESS_860746] via the I xRS according to the unblinding procedure 
outlined in the I nvestigator’s Guide. This s ystem allows the investigator, or other responsible 
person, to identify  the study  drug if there is an emergency , without jeopardizing the 
double -blind integrit y of the remainder of the study.
The code can be broken by  [CONTACT_093], or other responsible person, when knowledge of 
the subject’s treatment is required for the clinical management of the subject. If it becomes 
necessary  to know the individual treatment during the study  and thus to break th e code for 
that subject, the date and reason for unblinding are to be recorded on the relevant eCRF page. 
The investigator is required to promptly  document and explain to the sponsor any  premature 
unblinding (e.g. unblinding due to a serious adverse event [SAE]) of the study  drug), 
andstudy  drug must be discontinued permanentl y.
7.6 Drug logistics and accountability
All study  drugs will be stored at the investigational site in accordance with GCP and GMP 
requirements and the instructions given b y the clinical supplies department of the sponsor (or 
its affiliate/CRO), and will be inaccessible to unauthorized personnel. Special storage 
conditions and a complete record of batch numbers and expi[INVESTIGATOR_642998]’s study  file; the site -relevant elements of this information will be available in the 
investigator site file. On the day  of receipt, the respons ible site personnel will confirm receipt of

If the maximum labeled dose cannot be reached, the reason(s) should be documented in the 
eCRF. Antihy pertensi ve therap y for renal and CVD protection will be administered according 
to local guidelines (see also Section 8.1.2 on medical management).
Depending on blood pressure, serum creatinine or eGFR, subjects may  need to have their study  
drug dose or the dose of another concomitant medication reduced or discontinued. The dosage 
of SoC therapi[INVESTIGATOR_643000] y facilitate ma intenance of study  drug .
Prior medication that was discontinued to comply with the eligibility  criteria of the study  
should also be recorded in the eCRF.
All concomitant medication including therap y for T2DM and DKD until the PT Visit will be 
recorded in t he eCRF.
The following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_643001]:
Concomitant therap y with eplerenone, spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407], an y renin inhibitor, or 
potassium -sparing diuretic which cannot be discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to the 
Screening Visit and during stud y drug treatment
Concomitant therapy  with both an ACEI andan ARB during the Run -in and Screening
periods, and during stud y drug treatment
Concomitant therap y with potent cytochrome P450 isoenzy me 3A4 (CYP3A4) 
inhibitors or inducers must be stopped at least [ADDRESS_860750] common medication regarded as potent CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers is 
provided in Section 16.1.
Caution :Increases in finerenone exposure in combination with the following moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors cannot be excluded: amiodarone, aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], bicalutamide, 
chloramphenicol, imatinib, mifepristone, no rfloxacine, tacrolimus, verapamil,

concomitant use of high -dose acet ylsalicy lic acid (>500 mg/day ), non -steroidal 
anti-inflammatory  agents or trimethoprim or trimethoprim / sulfamet
hoxazole.
Medical management 8.1.2
ACEI s and ARBs are considered as SoC therapy  in patients with DKD and often prescribed to 
patients with DKD at early  stages (8)
.
It is advisable to follow the recommendations of local guidelines for the manag ement of 
CVD and CKD, the use of statins, anti- platelets and beta -blockers, and for gl ycemic control.

Control of blood pressure -amended 8.1.3
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
According to international guidelines, the recommended target blood pressure for subjects 
with T2DM and albuminuria, who are at increased risk of CVD and CKD progression, is 
<130/80 mmHg (39-41) . However, this value may vary  for the individual subject depending 
on concomitant diseases and well -being.
If blood pressure is considered uncontrolled b y the investigator during the study  period, 
non-potassium -sparing diuretics may  be added as first choice to the treatment regimen if this 
was not alread y done. Thereafter, the addition of antihy pertensive medication can be 
performed according to local guideline recommendations.
Allconcomitant medication added to the treatment regimen during the course of the stud y 
must be recorded in the eCRF
Use of potassium supplements and lowering agents 8.1.4
If needed, potassium supplementation can be prescribed during the cours e of the study . 
Investigators are advised to monitor potassium carefully  at each visit and to adapt the dose of 
any potassium supplementation in accordance with the potassium value measured at each visit 
or discontinue potassium supplementation once the po tassium is within the normal range.
Potassium -lowering agents (e.g. sodium pol ystyrene sulfonate, calcium poly styrene sulfonate) 
are allowed to be started during treatment with study  drug.
Any use of potassium supplementation and potassium -lowering agents must be documented 
in the eCRF.

This section was changed in Amendm ent 3, see Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Section [IP_ADDRESS].
Table 
9–1depi[INVESTIGATOR_643002]  ([ZIP_CODE]).
An overview of the procedures for sub -studies of [ZIP_CODE] is provided in 
Table 9–2.
All randomized subjects will remain in the study until its termination, either:
(1)after positive adjudication of the targeted number of primary  efficacy  endpoint events, 
or
(2)at a recommenda tion of the DMC.
Thus, all subjects, including those who stopped taking stud y drug, should be asked to attend 
all the protocol- specified study  visits in order to perform all assessments as stipulated in the 
visit schedule ( Table 9–1 ).
If any subject refuses to return for the defined assessments or is unable to do so, every  effort 
should be made to contact [CONTACT_12552]/her or a knowledgeable informant b y telephon
e to ask if an y of 
the primary , secondary , or other endpoints have been reached at the scheduled visits for the 
remaining duration of the study  (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details). Attempts to contact [CONTACT_643037]’s records. If an y subject refuses to be contact[CONTACT_261670] (e.g. the subject withdrew consent to release further information), every  effort 
should be mad e to obtain vital status (alive or dead) information through consultation of 
public databases, wherever allowed b y local regulations.

Kidney  failure is defined as either the occurrence of ESRD or an eGFR of less than 15 
mL/min/1.[ADDRESS_860762] is defined as the initiation of chronic dial ysis (haemo -or peritoneal -
dialy sis) for at least 90 days or renal transplantation.  The eGFR threshold of 15 mL /min/1.73 
m² is consistent with the definition of kidney  failure from KDIGO (Kidney  Disease: 
Improving Global Outcomes) (3)and was chosen in order to include an objective component 
to the endpoint because the decision to initiate dialy sis therap y or kidney  transplantation may  
be affected b y factors other than the eGFR. All other d efinitions of individual endpoints (e.g. 
CV death) will be provided in the Endpoint Manual.

9.5 Pharmacokinetics / pharmacodynamics -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section [IP_ADDRESS].
For the investigation of systemic exposure to finerenone and its relationship with treatment 
effects, the plasma concentrations of finerenone will be determined at different time points 
using a sparse sampling approach in all participating subjects.  Details about the collection, 
processing, storage and shipment of samples will be provided separatel y (Laboratory  Manual ).
The plasma concentration versus time data of Visit 3 (Month 4) and at subseq uent y early  
visits will be evaluated descriptivel y, separated b y dose. Plots will be prepared of all 
individual plasma concentrations vs. actual relative study
 times (time of sample collection 
after time of stud y drug administration). 
The PK data will be evaluated using non -linear mixed effect modeling (NONMEM). In 
addition, attempts will be made to identify  whether the PK of finerenone is influenced by  
[CONTACT_643043]-response relationships. This evaluation will be described 
in a separa te analy sis plan and will be reported separatel y.
At Visit 3 (Month 4), a trough sample for the determination of finerenone plasma 
concentrations will be drawn before intake of study drug (if the sample could not be obtained 
at Visit 3, it can be drawn at Visit 4). At this visit, study  drug will be administered at the study  
center b y stud y personnel and the exact time of study drug intake on the day before the visit 
and on the day  of the visit and the exact sampling time will be recorded in the eCRF. Ideall y, 
the study  personnel should contact [CONTACT_643040] [ADDRESS_860764] sampling times will be

9.6 Safety
Adverse events 9.6.1
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section [IP_ADDRESS].
Definition of adverse event (AE)
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence (i.e. any unfavorable and unintended sign 
[including abnormal laboratory  findings], sy mptom or disease) in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject. Therefore, an AE may  or may  not be temporall y or causally
 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product.
All diagnoses, sy mptom(s), sign(s) or finding(s) with a start date from randomization 
onwards must be recorded as (S)AEs, except those related to stud y procedure. The latter have 
to be recorded as (S)AEs after informed consent has been obtained (see also end of this 
section for definition of SAE).
A surgical procedure that was planned prior to randomization by [CONTACT_57128] (however, the condition for which the surgery  is 
required may be an AE).
In the following differentiation between medical history  and AEs, the term ‘ condition ’ may  
include abnormal physical examination findings, sy mptoms, diseases, laboratory  or ECG 
findings:
Conditions that were present before randomization and for which no s ymptoms or 
treatment are present until randomization are recorded 
as medical history (e.g. 
seasonal allergy  without acute complaints)
Conditions that started before randomization and for which sy mptoms or treatment are 
present after randomization , at unchanged intensity ,are recorded as medical history (e.g. 
allergic pollinosis)
Conditions that started or deteriorated after randomization will be documented as 
(S)A Es
Conditions assessed as related to study procedure (such as invasive procedures and 
adjustment of SoC therapy [see Section 8.1.1 for guidance]) that start or deteriorate 
after 
signed informed consent must be documented as (S)AEs .
CONFIDENTIAL Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No. BAY 94 -8862 (finerenone) / [ZIP_CODE]
12 MAR 2019    Version 3.0 Page:  62of 136
Definition of serious adverse event (SAE)
An SAE is classified as any  untoward medical occurrence that, at an y dose, meets an y of the 
following criteria (a –f):
a. Results in death
b. Is life -threatening
The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition refers to an event in which the subject was 
at risk of death at the time of the event, it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically  might have caused death if it were more severe.
c. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_643003] S AE if 
at least one of the following exceptions is met:
The admission results in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8954] 12 hours
The admission is pre
-planned
(e.g. elective or scheduled surgery  arranged prior to the first dose of stud y drug ; 
admission is part of the study  procedures as described in Section 9.2)
The admission is not associated with an AE
(e.g. social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]).
However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during an y hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8955] ‘ medically important ’ and as such may  be reportable as an SAE 
dependent on clinical judgment. In addition, where local regulatory  authorities 
speci ficall y require a more stringent definition, the local regulation takes precedence.
d. Results in persistent or significant disability  / incapacity
Disability  means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct normal life’s 
functions.
e. Is a congen ital anomal y / birth defect
f. Is another serious or important medical event as judged b y the investigator.
[IP_ADDRESS] Classifications for adverse event assessment
All AEs will be assessed and documented b y the investigator according to the categories 
detailed below.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_860765] be determined according to the criteria given in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].

[IP_ADDRESS].2 Intensity
The intensity  of an AE is cl assified according to the following categories:
Mild: usually  transient in nature and generally  not interfering with normal activities
Moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities
Severe: prevents normal activities.
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Causal relationship 
The assessment of the causal relationship between an AE and the administration of treatment 
is a decision to be made by  [CONTACT_093], who is a qualified phy sician, based on all 
information available at the time of the completion of the eC RF.
The assessment is based on the question whether there was a ‘ reasonable causal relationship ’ 
to the study  treatment in question.
Possible answers are ‘ yes’ or ‘ no’.
An assessment of ‘ no’ would include:
1.The existence of a highl y likely  alternative ex planation, e.g. mechanical bleeding at 
surgical site.
or
2.Non-plausibility , e.g. the subject is struck by  [CONTACT_358041]; cancer 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a few day s after the first drug administration.
An assessment of ‘ yes’ indicates that that the AE is reasonabl y associated with the use of the 
study  treatment.
Important factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the AE to study  treatment 
include the following:
–
The temporal sequence from drug administration:
The event should occur after the drug is given. The length of time from drug exposure 
to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event.
–Recovery  on drug discontinuation (de -challenge), recur rence on drug re- introduction 
(re-challenge):
Subject’s response after de -challenge or re -challenge should be considered in view of 
the usual clinical course of the event in question.
–Underl ying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases:
Each event should be eva luated in the context of the natural history  and course of the 
disease being treated and any  other disease the subject may  have.
–Concomitant medication or treatment:
The other drugs the subject is taking or the treatment the subject receives should be 
exam ined to determine whether an y of them might have caused the event in question.

12 MAR 2019    Version 3.0 Page:  64of 136
–The pharmacology  and pharmacokinetics of the study  treatment:
The pharmacokinetic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) 
of the study  treatment, coupled with the individual subject’s pharmacod ynamics 
should be considered.
– The assessment is not possible.
Causal relationship to protocol- required procedure(s)
The assessment of a possible causal relationship between the AE and protocol -required 
procedure(s) i s based on the question whether there was a ‘ reasonable causal relationship ’ to 
protocol -required procedure(s). 
Possible answers are ‘ yes’ or ‘ no’.
[IP_ADDRESS].4 Action taken with study treatment 
Any action on study  treatment to resolve the AE is to be documented usin g the categories 
listed below as follows:
Drug withdrawn
Drug interrupted
Dose reduced
Dose not changed
Dose increased
Not applicable
Unknown.
[IP_ADDRESS].5 Other specific treatment(s) of adverse events
Specific treatment of AE(s), if given, is to be documented follows :

[IP_ADDRESS] Assessments and documentation of adverse events (AEs) -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section [IP_ADDRESS].
Attention is to be paid to the time of occurrence of AEs at all stages of the examination. Thus, 
the subject should be closely  observed by  [CONTACT_093]
.
AEs observed, mentioned upon open questioning by  a member of the investigator’s team or 
spontaneously  reported by  [CONTACT_508001]. The observation period for AEs 
will start with randomization and will end with the last visit of follow -up except for AEs 
related to stud y proc edures; the observation period for the latter AEs will start with signed 
informed consent and will end with the last visit of follow-up. In the event of ongoing 
study -related AEs and medicall y relevant AEs at the end of the study, the investigator is urged
to monitor the subject and document the outcome on the subject’s source document. After the 
end of the follow -up phase, there is no requirement to actively  collect AEs including deaths. 
The ty pe of information that should be assessed and recorded by  [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator for each AE 
is listed in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
See also Section [IP_ADDRESS] above for the differentiation between medical history  and AEs.
The investigator is responsible for the grad ing of each category  mentioned. An assessment of 
the seriousness of the event will be made b y the investigator.  SAEs will be recorded on the 
AE page of the eCRF.
Emerging AEs will be allocated to the period in which they  have started, e.g. a s ymptom 
starting in the treatment period and continuing in the follow- up peri od without deterioration 
will only  be documented for that treatment period.
When assigning its cause, ‘ death’ should not be recorded as an AE on the AE page. Instead, 
‘death’ is the outcome of underly ing AE(s). 
For all serious adverse events (SAEs), the s ponsor has to carry  out a separate assessment for 
expectedness, seriousness and causal relationship to study  drug.

The efficacy  and pre -defined disease -related outcome events specified in Figure 9–1 will 
notbe documented as (S)AEs.  Instead, these events will be documented only on the 
Outcome Event pages of the eCRF. In addition, they  will not be reported as SAEs and will 
neither be unblinded, nor reported to regulatory  authorities, I ECs, or investigators (see also 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details). 
However, they  will be collected in the eCRF, monitored by  [CONTACT_643044]. I f unexpected safet y issues are 
identified, specific amendments will be implemented.

[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of serious adverse events (SAEs) -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section [IP_ADDRESS].
The definition of SAEs is provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Each SAE must be followed up until 
resolution or stabilization by  [CONTACT_23636][INVESTIGATOR_841].
The pre -defined disease -related efficacy  events (see 
Table 13–1) will not be subject to AE 
documentation and expedited reporting as SAE because they  are not unexpected in this study  
population. Thus, they will not be recorded as SAEs on the AE page and will not be sent to 
Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance department.  Instead, these events will be recorded on the eCRF 
as outcome events. Consequently , they  will neither be unblinded, nor reported to regulatory  
authorities, IECs or investigators. However, they  will be collected in the eCRF, evaluated b y 
the CEC, mon itored by  [CONTACT_643045] . The independent DMC will periodically  review 
and assess all safety data for imbalances in safet y outcomes. I t is believed that in this way, 
patient safet y can continue to be monitored throughout the duration of the trial, without 
affecting the integrity  of the study .  Should unexpected safet y issues be identified, specific 
amendments will be implemented.
All other SAEs that fulfill the se riousness criteria provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS] must be 
collected on the AE page of the eCRF and reported as SAEs to the Sponsor’s 
Pharmacovigilance department. All SAEs that fulfill S[LOCATION_003]R criteria as defined by  [CONTACT_165954] E2A Guideline will be reported to the concerned authorities by  [CONTACT_57130] 
(seedetails below) .
The investigator is responsible for continuing to follow- up on all SAE reports (wheth er or not 
the event is related to study  drug) until resolution of the event, or until the event is considered 
chronic and/or stable b y the investigator and/or other ph ysician who is responsible for the 
subject’s medical care. Follow -up SAE reports will be reported according to the same 
timelines as initial reports, as soon as new significant information becomes available.
Investigator’s notification of the sponsor
All investigators will be thoroughly instructed and trained on all relevant aspects of the 
investigator’s reporting obligations for SAEs. This information, including all relevant contact 
[CONTACT_8972], will be summarized in the investigator site file and updated as needed.
The investigator must report immediately  (within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness) 
allSAEs that are not exempted from SAE reporting occurring during the observation period 
defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_643004].
Each SAE must be followed up until resolution or stabilization by  [CONTACT_382369][INVESTIGATOR_841].

9.7 Other procedures and variables
Monitoring of blood potassium - am ended 9.7.1
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section [IP_ADDRESS].
Hyperkalemia is a frequent event in subjects with DKD progressing to ESRD and one of the 
main risks identified from previous studies with MRAs including finerenone. Potassium will 
be monitor ed closel y during this study, with assessments of potassium concentration 
scheduled at all visits (see Table 9–1for schedule).
During treatment with study  drug, all assessments of potassium, including re -tests
, will be 
performed at both local and central laboratories. Due to sample handling and extended 
transportation time to the central laboratory , falsely  elevated serum potassium values in 
centrall y (but not locall y) anal yzed samples have been observed in pre vious studies with 
finerenone. Since the value of potassium in the local sample is usually  notaffected b y this 
andresults from the local laboratory  are available earlier, local samples will be taken not only  
for safety  purposes but also for dose adjustments.
Re-checking of potassium values must be done at the latest within [ADDRESS_860769] at any  
tim
e if they  consider it necessary  to confirm the potassium concentration of the local or the 
central sample.
Adjustment of dose after start of study  drug intake based on blood potassium levels is 
provided in Table 9–3. 
Table 9–3 Blood potassium: guidance for dose adjustment at Visit 2 and subsequent 
visits
Blood potassium (mmol/L) Action
First sample:
≤4.8 If on lower dose of study drug, up -titrate to higher dose.
If on higher dose of study drug, continue on the same dose.
4.9 to 5.5 Continue on the same dose.
>5.5 Withhold study drug and re -
check potassium within 72 hours.
Second and subsequent samples:
≤5.0 Re-start study drug at lower dose.
>5.0 Continue to withhold study drug; continue to monitor potassium and restart 
study drug at the lower dose only if potassium is ≤5.0
NOTE: lower dose =10mg once daily; higher dose =20mg once daily.

Blood potassium should be measured 4 weeks (
± 7days) after re -starting treatment or 
dose adjustment, especially  after up- titration
If central laboratory  results for blood potassium differ fr om local laboratory results to 
such an extent that the investigator is uncomfortable with the dose adjustment guidance 
shown in Table 9–3, blood sampli ng may  be repeated at the investigator’s discretion
If the subject is alread y on the lower dose of study drug but h yperkalemia recurs soon 
after a previous event of hy perkalemia with interruption of study  drug, and there is 
noexplanation for the recurring hyperkalemia event other than intake of study  drug, 
permanent discontinuation of study  drug is recommended
If blood potassium is > 6.5mmol/L , an ECG should be obtained
Subjects will maintain their normal diet throughout the study  and will not be given an y 
specific advice on dietary  potassium restrictions.

program of finerenone in DKD. However, before becoming s ymptomatic, sub- clinical cardiac 
dysfunction and abnormal leftventricular structure including leftventricular hy pertrophy  can 
be demonstrated in the majority  of sub jects with moderate CKD. Imaging plays a central role 
in the diagnosis of structural heart disease. Of the various imaging modalities available, for 
reasons of accuracy , availability , safet y and cost, echocardiograph y is the method of choice in 
subjects wi th suspected or the beginnings of structural heart disease.
In all participating sites, echocardiograph y will be performed according to a study -specific 
protocol at Visit 1 (Day  1; baseline), at y early visits and at the end of the study  (either at the 
PDVisit or the EOS Visit). If a baseline assessment is not available or analy sable , the subject 
will not continue to undergo echocardiograph y assessments due to the ina bility  to perform a 
comparison against baseline. 
Echocardiography  examinations, data colle ction and procedures for central blinded adjudication

The variables for evaluation in this sub -study  are as follows:
−Primary  variable:
Chronic GFR slope, i.e. the rate of GFR decline from Visit 3 (Month 4) after 
randomization to the end of the treatment period.
As previously  addressed in the AASK trial, this approach is needed to address the 
biphasic change in GFR decline that is expected afte r exposure to the study drug. 
TheGFR slope will be de termined separatel y during the first 4 months following 
randomization (acute slope) and a fter 4 months (chronic slope). The acute and chronic 
phases are differentiated because the study  treatment might have acute effects on 
GFR that may  differ from its long term effects on disease progression (44, 45)
(anapproach approved by  [CONTACT_941] U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and 
Kidney  Diseases (46)).
−Exploratory  variable:
oChange in GFR from Visit 1 (baseline) and at the PT Visit (recovery )
oAcute GFR changes from baseline to Visit 3 (Month 4)
oAcute GFR changes from the end of the treatment period until the end of the 
recovery  period
oCorrelation anal yses between short term GFR changes between Visit 1 (baseline) 
and Visit 3 (Month 4) after randomization, and long term GFR decline (chronic 
slope).
An ANCOVA model will be fitted to the GFR efficacy  variables includ ing the factors 
treatment group, the stratification factors (ty pe of albuminuria, eGFR category , history  
of CVD) and the baseline GFR as covariate. Corresponding two
-sided 95% confiden ce 
intervals will be computed. In addition, correlation anal yses between short term GFR 
changes between Visit 1 (baseline) and Visit 3 (Month 4) after randomization, and 
long term GFR decline (chronic slope).

10. Statistical methods and determination of sample size
10.1 General considerations
Statistical analy sis will be performed using SAS; the version used will be specified in the 
statistical analy sis plan (SAP).
A log- normal distribution is assumed for serum creatinine and UACR. For all other metric 
variables, a normal distribution is assumed. The distributional assumptions will be 
investigated and if necessary , nonparametric methods or transformation of the data will be 
considered. 
All variables will be analyzed b y descriptive statistical methods. The number of data 
available, mean, standard deviation (SDv), minimum, median, and maximum will be 
calculated for metric data. The geometric mean andSDv will be provided instead of the 
arithmetic mean and SDv for the variables where lognormal distributions are assumed. 
Frequency  tables will be generated for categorical data.
Baseline v alues will be defined as the last non -missing measurement before 
randomization 
(Visit 1) . If the last observation available prior to randomization is the measurement from the 
Screening Visit, this would be used as the baseline value. This also includes ass essments from 
a local laboratory , in case that prior to randomization, no assessment from the central 
laboratory  is available. Otherwise baseline will be missing. The measurement from the Run -in 
Visit will not be used as a baseline value. If more than one measurement was planned for a 
scheduled time point, for example blood pressure measurements and heart rate, the mean 
value of the last set of measurements per time point prior to randomization will be used as the 
baseline value.
Only  the data provided by  [CONTACT_643050], values from local 
laboratories will not be used in the statistical analy sis and listed only . 
In the event of repeated measurements for Pre- treatment Visits and the Visit 1 (Day  1;baseline),
the closest measurement prior to randomization will be used for anal ysis instead of the 
scheduled measurements. At all visits post- randomization and unless stated otherwise, onl y 
the values at scheduled measurements will be used for anal ysis.
The derived visit ‘ Any time post baseline ’ (applicable for efficacy ) will include any  measurement 
after randomization , including unscheduled assessments. For the derived visit ‘ Any time on 
treatment ’, onl y assessments up to [ADDRESS_860778] study  drug adm inistration, including 
unscheduled assessments, will be considered (applicable for efficacy ; for safety ,assessments 
within [ADDRESS_860779] study  drug administration will be considered) .
Further details on the statistical analy ses will be provided in the SAP that will be approved 
before database release.

10.2 Analysis sets -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section [IP_ADDRESS].
Safety analysis set (SAF): All randomized subjects who have taken at least 1 dose 
of study  drug 
Full anal ysis set (FAS): All randomized subjects 
Per
-protocol analy sis set (PPS): All subjects of the FAS without any validit y findings
Pharmacokinetic anal ysis set (PKS): All finerenone -treated subjects with at least 1 valid 
finerenone plasma concentration and without protocol 
deviation, which would interfere with the evaluation of

the majority  of the time in the study  will be used in SAF and PPS.
The stratum variable ty pe of albuminuria and eGFR category  and history  of CVD used in the 
statistical analy sis will be derived based on the screening UACR and eGFR assessm ent, and 
medical history , respectively . All subjects will be anal yzed according to their correct 
stratification category . In the event of stratification errors, the primary  analy sis will also be 
repeated based on the stratification category  used in the randomization as a sensitivity  
analysis.

This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section [IP_ADDRESS].
The anal yses described in this section will be repeated for the SAF and PPS if they  differ in 
sample size from the FAS.
Treatment duration (number of months with study drug intake) will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics by  [CONTACT_6654]. I n addition, treatment duration will be 
categorized and presented with the corresponding number and percentage of subjects b y 
treatment group and overall. Further specification of the categories will be provided in the 
SAP.
A tab le will be presented with the absolute and relative frequencies of subjects still in the 
study  at each visit. Kaplan

The extent of exposure to study  drug (total amount of intake in grams) will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics by  [CONTACT_1570]. 
The up -titration status (y es/no), regardless of actual or sham up -titration, will be summarized 
with absolute and relative frequencies per treatment group for each visit as well as subjec ts 
never up -titrated, up -titrated once, and up -titrated more than once. Compliance (as a percentage)
will be calculated as follows: 
100 * Number of taken tablets / Number of planned tablets.
The number of planned tablets will be calculated as follows:
(Day s from randomization to last intake of study  drug + 1) * Number of planned tablets per 
day.
All tablets, including the dummy  placebo tablets, will be counted. For subjects who withdraw 
prematurel y from the study drug, compliance will be calculated up t o the time of last dose.
The compliance will be summarized descriptively  by [CONTACT_6654]. In addition, 
percent of compliance will be categorized into three groups, <80%, ≥80 to ≤120% and

12 MAR 2019    Version 3.0 Page:  82of [ADDRESS_860780] at an overall one -sided significance level of 2.5%, equivalently  a 
two-sided significance level of 5%:
H0: Sfinerenone (t) = S placebo (t
) for all time points t ≥ 0
The alternative hypothesis will be:
H1: Sfinerenone (t) > S placebo (t) for at least one time point t ≥ 0 and 
Sfinerenone (t) ≥Splacebo (t) for all time points t ≥ 0,
where Sfinerenone denotes the ‘ survival ’ function of the finerenone treatment group and 
Splacebo denotes the ‘survival ’ function of the placebo treatment group. ‘ Survival ’ means 
‘noevent of the primary composite endpoint ’ in this context. 
The following decision rule to test the null hy pothesis will be applied:
According to the size of this study  it is just ified to assume under H 0a sufficiently  close 
approximation of the log- rank test ( 47) to the normal distribution. If the z-value from the log-
rank test (for the difference Sfinerenone –Splacebo ), stratified by [CONTACT_83353] t ype of 
albuminuria, region, eGFR category  and history  of CVD is larger than the critical quantile 
from the normal distribution (z 0.975= 1.960), the null hy pothesis will be rejected in favor of 
the alternative h ypothesis.
The nominal significance levels and the critical values at the fin al analy sis will be adjusted to 
account for the interim analy sis, see Section 
10.[ADDRESS_860781] ratio and a corresponding two- sided 95% 
confidence interval, a stratified Cox proportional regression model will be used. 
Kaplan -Meier curves will be provided for the cumulative proportions of events by  [CONTACT_98540].
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary efficacy variable: supp ortive analyses
The primary  anal ysis of the primary  efficacy  variable will be repeated in the PPS as a 
supportive anal ysis. Further supportive analy ses of the primary  efficacy  variable will be 
performed in the FAS and PPS.

Kaplan -Meier estimates (the 25th, 50thand 75thpercentile) of the time to the first event of the 
primary  composite endpoint (including 95% confidence interval), overall ‘ survival ’ rates at 
6,12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months and Kaplan -
Meier curves will be presented for each treatm ent 
group. These anal yses will be presented in total and for each level of the stratification factors 
(type of albuminuria, region, eGFR category , history  of CVD). 
The censoring mechanism of subjects without an event of the primary  composite endpoint at 
the time of anal ysis is assumed to be non- informative for the primary  efficacy  anal ysis. 
Sensitivity  analy ses will be performed, assessing the impact of potential informative 
censoring of such subjects. These will include the use of different imputation rules for 
considering subjects without an event of the primary  composite endpoint as having an event 
or being censored, and will be further outlined in the SAP. 
For the individual events of the primary  composite endpoint, the number of events per 
patient -year will be presented overall and b y treatment group. The frequency of events per 
patient -year for a treatment group will be calculated as the number of events observed for a 
treatment group (counting all events, not only  the first one) divided by  [CONTACT_643055] s 
from first intake of stud y drug for all subjects within a treatment group and multiplied by  
365.25.
An ‘on-treatment ’ anal ysis will be performed, including onl y events occurring while taking 
study  drug or until 30 days after stop of study  drug. T his analy sis will be performed in the 
FAS.
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary efficacy variables: primary analysis
The primary  anal ysis of the secondary  efficacy  variables will be anal yzed in FAS.
If the null hy pothesis of the primary  anal ysis is rejected, the secondary  efficacy  variables will 
be tested hierarchically  in the order as they  are listed in Section 9.4.2, while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_643013]-sided significance level of 5.0%. Ot herwise, the testing of the secondary  efficacy  
variables will be performed in an explorative manner only . 
The primary  anal ysis of the secondary  time -to-event endpoints will be analy zed analogousl y 
to the primary  anal ysis of the primary  composite endpoint.
An ANCOVA model will be fitted to the logarithmized ratios of UACR at Month 4 to UACR 
at baseline including the factors treatment group, the stratification factors (ty pe of 
albuminuria, region, eGFR category , history  of CVD) and the logarithmized baseline UACR 
as covariate.  Corresponding two -sided 95% confidence intervals will be computed.  This is 
consistent with the primary  anal ysis of the Phase II Stud y [ZIP_CODE].
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary efficacy variables: supportive analyses
The primary  anal ysis of the secondary  effic acy variables will be repeated in the PPS as a 
supportive anal ysis. Further supportive analy ses of the secondary  efficacy  variables will be 
performed in FAS and PPS.

ANCOVA as described above. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of other exploratory efficacy variables
All other efficacy  variables will be anal yzed in FAS and PPS in an explorative manner . 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 UACR and albuminuria -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section [IP_ADDRESS].
UACR during the stud y will be summarized descriptively  by [CONTACT_643056]. These anal yses will be performed overall and separated by  [CONTACT_643057] 
(type of albuminuria, region and eGFR category , history  of CVD) . 
The log-transformed ratio of UACR to baseline at each visit up to Month 24 will be anal yzed 
by a mixed model with the factors treatment group, visit, treatment by  [CONTACT_23259],
factors for the stratification levels (type of albuminuria, region and eGFR category , history  of 
CVD ), log- transformed baseline value as covariate nested within type of albuminuria and 
log-transformed baseline value by  [CONTACT_23259]. Pairwise ratios b etween the finerenone 
and the placebo treatment group will be calculated and corresponding two -sided 95% 
confidence intervals will be computed.
Frequency  tables will be generated for the number of subjects with a relative decrease and 
increase in UACR of ≥30%, ≥40% and ≥50% from baseline UACR. The analy sis will be 
performed for each visit and for an y time post baseline. The analysis will also be performed 
stratified for each level of the stratification factors (ty pe of albuminuria, region and eGFR 
category ,history  of CVD ).
A shift table will be provided display ing the number of subjects who changed from baseline 
to each visit from very  high albuminuria to high albuminuria, from very  high albuminuria to 
UACR < 30mg/g, from high albuminuria to UACR < 30mg/g, from high albuminuria to very  
high albuminuria and from UACR < 30mg/g to high and very  high albuminuria by  [CONTACT_17674]. The albuminuria category  changes will only  be considered as shifts, if they  
are accompanied b y a UACR decrease of at lea st30% from baseline to each visit.
The additional categorical UACR efficacy  variables listed in Section 9.4.3 will be 
summarized for presence or ab sence of the event using logistic regression with the factors 
treatment group and stratification levels (type of albuminuria, region and eGFR category, 
history  of CVD ). Pairwise differences between the finerenone and the placebo treatment 
group will be cal culated and corresponding two- sided 95% confidence intervals will be 
computed.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Decrease in eGFR
eGFR will be summarized descriptivel y by [CONTACT_643058]. These anal yses will be performed overall and separated by  [CONTACT_643057] (type of albuminuria, region and eGFR category , history of CVD) .

The absolute change of eGFR to baseline at each visit until Month 24 will be anal yzed by a 
mixed model with the factors treatment group, visit, treatment by  [CONTACT_23259], factors for 
the stratification levels (type of albuminuria, region an d eGFR category , history  of CVD ), 
baseline value as covariate nested within eGFR category  and baseline by  [CONTACT_23259]. 
Pairwise differences between the finerenone and the placebo treatment group will be 
calculated and corresponding two -sided 95% conf idence intervals will be computed.
Frequency  tables will be generated for the number of subjects with a relative decrease in 
eGFR of ≥30%, ≥40%, ≥50% and ≥57% from baseline eGFR. The analy sis will be performed 
for each visit and for an y time post baseline. In addition, for each patient, the annual change 
in eGFR will be calculated by  [CONTACT_643059]’s eGFR assessments into a linear regression 
model with time as the independent variable. The derived annual change will be analy zed 
using an ANCOVA model in cluding baseline, treatment group and stratification factors as 
fixed -effects.
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Health -related quality of life (HRQoL)
Domain scores for each of the 5 domains (Phy sical Component Summary , Mental Component 
Summary , Burden of Kidney  Disease, S ymptoms / Proble ms, and Effects of Kidney  Disease) 
will be calculated according to the KDQOL scoring instruction
(http://www.rand.org/health/surveys_tools/kdqol.html [6th September 2013]). The KDQOL -
[ADDRESS_860784] 
quartile, and maximum, including the changes from baseline. 
Summary  scores will be calculated out of the 5 dimensions according to the scoring 
instructi ons from Europe and the US [refer to the EQ -5D- 5L User Guide (48)and to the 
EQ-5D Value Sets (49)]. The values and the changes from baseline of the summary  scores 
and the EQ Visual Analogue scale ( VAS) will be summarized by  [CONTACT_643060]. 
For details on HRQoL questionnaires, see Section 16.3
[IP_ADDRESS].4 New diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, new diagnosis of heart failure 
and regression of albuminuria
These other exploratory  efficacy  variables will be summarized for presence or absence of the 
event using logistic regression with the factors tr eatment group and stratification levels (type 
of albuminuria, region and eGFR category , history of CVD ). Pairwise differences between the 
finerenone and the placebo treatment group will be calculated and corresponding two -sided 
95% confidence intervals wil

The following subgroups w ill be considered for exploratory  subgroup analyses:
Region (North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia, Others)
eGFR category  at screening and baseline (eGFR 25 to < 45, 45 to < 60 and 
≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m2)
Type of albuminuria at screening and baseline (hig h albuminuria vs very  high

Baseline serum potassium ( ≤ 4.5 vs. > 4.5 mmol/L)
Systolic blood pressure at baseline (90 to <130 , 130 to <160 and ≥ 160 mmHg).
It is anticipated that in these proposed subgroups fo r anal ysis, differences in treatment effects 
may be observed according to the screening or baseline characteristics defined, due in part to 
the differences in the risk of clinical events expected in the different subgroups.
Furthermore, subgroup analy sis u

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse events
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the Medi cal Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities 
(MedDRA, latest version available prior to data base freeze). A listing will be provided 
linking the original investigator terms and the coded terms. AEs will also be presented 
grouped b y SMQs. 
AEs that started or worsened after the first dose of study  drug up to 3 days after any 
temporary  or permanent interruption of study  drug will be considered as treatment emergent 
AEs (TEAEs). 
An overall summary of all AEs and TEAEs will be generated by  [CONTACT_1570]. 
The n umber of subjects with TEAEs, post- treatment AEs occurring more than [ADDRESS_860785], the event will be 
reported as related to study  drug. If the drug relationship is missing, the even t will be 
considered as being related to the study  drug.
Separate tables summarizing TEAEs, treatment -emergent study  drug -related AEs, and SAEs 
that occurred in more than 5% of the subjects will be provided.
Deaths, SAEs and AEs leading to permanent study drug discontinuation will be listed 
separately .
[IP_ADDRESS] Laboratory data
The number of subjects with treatment emergent (until 3 days after any temporary  or 
permanent interruption of study  drug) abnormal laboratory  values above or below the normal 
range will be tabulated by [CONTACT_643061]. 
Summary  statistics including changes to baseline will be calculated b y treatment group and 
visit for all quantitative laboratory  parameters, e.g. for hematology , HBA1 c, clinical chemistry  
and urinal ysis. Geometric statistics and ratios to baseline will be presented for creatinine 
instead of arithmetic statistics with changes from baseline. For eGFR the relative change will 
be display ed in addition to the absolute change from baseline.
Summary  statistics for serum potassium, eGFR and serum creatinine will also be repeated b y

10.4 Determination of sample size -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section [IP_ADDRESS].
This is an event -driven study . A total of between [ADDRESS_860791] 90% power to demonstrate superiorit y of finerenone to placebo using a logrank test at 
a two -sided significance level of 5.0%, assuming a 20% relative r isk reduction, i.e. a true hazard 
ratio of 0.80 (t he hazard ratio that will be observed in the study  will be different, i.e. closer to 1 
due to treatment discontinuations). The study  will stop when approximatel y 976primary  
efficacy  endpoints accrue across both treatment arms.
With an assumed 
treatment duration of between 44 and 48 months ( duration of recruitment 
period: [ADDRESS_860792] recruited: 11 and 7 months, respectively ), the planned total 
number of subjects to be randomized is estimated to be between 6212 and 6286 subjects, 
respectivel y, assuming an a nnual placebo event rate of 8%, a common annual lost -to-follow -
uprate of 0.7% in both treatment groups, an annual finerenone discontinuation rate of 5% and 
assuming that placebo discontinuation will not change the hazard. 6400 subjects are planned 
to be randomized taking a certain ramp -up during recruitment into accoun t. Assuming a 
screening failure rate of 50%, [ADDRESS_860793] of the interim anal ysis on the overall power of the study , an 
adjustment of sample size would be negligible. 
The assumption of the annual placebo event rate of 8% is based on the results from the 
MICRO -HOPE, RENAAL, IDNT, ALTITUDE and SAVOR -TIMI [ADDRESS_860794] of care treatment for DKD. Annual event rates for the composite CV 
endpoint range from 7 -10% for older studies and 5 -6% for more recent studi es. As the 
anticipated population study  [ZIP_CODE] will be more enriched for CV outcomes than ALTITUDE 
and SAVOR -TIMI 53, a likely  lower mean eGFR and higher median UACR value, the 
assumed annual placebo event rate of 8% is assumed to be appropriate for this Ph ase III 
setting (10, 11, 51-54 ) . 
The calculations of the required total number of events and subjects to be randomized were 
performed using PASS 11 ( 55).

10.5 Planned interim analyses -amended
This section was changed in Amendment 3, see Section [IP_ADDRESS].
One formal interim anal ysis is planned when 2/[ADDRESS_860795] between 34 and 38 months after start of 
study  treatment .As an event -driven trial, the actual timing of the interim analy sis will depend 
on the observed event rate, the patient recruitment rat
e, and length of the recruitment period.
If the interim anal ysis shows clear and consistent benefit in the finerenone treatment group, 
the DMC may  recommend earl y stud y termination. The Haybittle -Peto rule will be used to 
guide the decision regarding earl y stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_643016]: a reduction of [ADDRESS_860796] 
deviations in the anal ysis of the primary  efficacy  endpoint and the secondary  renal composite 
endpoint at the interim analy sis (two- sided p -value < 0.[ZIP_CODE]). 
If the decision will be to stop the study  early  for success, the final primary  anal yses, both for 
the primary  and secondary  efficacy  endpoints, will be performed at an overall two -sided
significance level of 0.270%. A group sequential design with a single interim analy sis when 
2/3 of the i nformation is available with a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_643017]- sided p < 0.[ZIP_CODE] would 
require a final p < 0.[ZIP_CODE] to maintain the overall significance level at 5%. Consequently , if 
the decision will be to continue the study  without stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_643018], the fi nal primary  
analyses will be performed at a two -sided significance level of 4.968%.
For a lack of efficacy , a non -binding futility  approach will be utilized at the time of the 
planned interim anal ysis. If the conditional probability  of rejecting the null h ypothesis for the 
primary  comparison, given the assumed and current event rates, falls to an unacceptabl y low 
level (as will be specified in the DMC Charter), the DMC may  consider recommending earl y 
termination of the study .
The Executive Committee will ov ersee overall blinded event rates to ensure that they  meet 
protocol projections. If overall event rates are lower than expected, consideration will be 
given to altering the trial design, such as increasing the sample size or extending the study  
duration wi thout knowledge of an y treatment effect.
11. Data handling and quality assurance
11.[ADDRESS_860797] data necessary  for anal ysis and reporting will be en tered/transmitted into a 
validated database or data sy stem. 
Data required according to this protocol will be recorded b y investigational site personnel via 
data entry  into the internet -based electronic data capture software s ystem RAVE, which Bay er 
has li censed from Medidata Solutions Worldwide. RAVE has been validated by  [CONTACT_643067]. RAVE allows for the 
CONFIDENTIAL Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No. BAY 94 -8862 (finerenone) / [ZIP_CODE]
12 MAR 2019    Version 3.0 Page:  91of [ADDRESS_860798] facility  maintained by  [CONTACT_388402] a periodic basis to Bay er's internal computer sy stem via a 
secure Virtual Private Network.
All access to the RAVE syst em is through a password -protected security  system that is part of 
the RAVE software. All internal Bay er and external investigator site personnel seeking access 
must go through a thorough RAVE training process before they  are granted access to RAVE 
for use in Bay er's clinical studies. Training records are maintained.
All personnel with access to the RAVE sy stem are supported by  a Service Desk staffed with 
trained personnel to answer questions and ensure access is maintained such that data entry  can 
proceed in a timely  manner.
The RAVE Sy stem contains a sy stem -generated audit trail that captures any changes made to 
a data field, including who made the change, wh y the change was made and the date and time 
it was made. This information is available both at the investigator’s site and at Bay er. Data 
entries made in the RAVE EDC screens are supported by [CONTACT_573559] .
Source documentation
It is the expectation of the sponsor that key  data entered into the eCRF has source 
documentation available at the site.
Study -specific data (race and ethnic group) may  be entered directl y into the CRF, without 
availability  of corresponding source documentation.  For all other data, source documentation 
must be available at the site.
The site must implement processes to ensure availability  of all required source 
documentation. A source document checklist (not part of this protocol) will be used at the site 
to identify  the source data for key  data points collected and the monitor will work with the site 
to complete this.

12 MAR 2019    Version 3.0 Page:  92of 136
Data recorded from screening failures
Data of ‘ only screened subjects ’ will be recorded at least as source data, as far as the reason 
for the premature discontinuation is identifiable. At minimum, the following da ta should be 
recorded in the eCRF:
Demographic information (subject number; year of birth /age; sex; if applicable race / 
ethnicity )
Date of informed consent
Reason for premature discontinuation
Date of last visit.
These data will be transferred to the respective database.
11.2 Monitoring
In accordance with applicable regulations, GCP, and sponsor’s/CRO’s procedures, monitors 
will contact [CONTACT_23988], 
study  requirements, and their responsibilities to satisfy  regulatory , ethical, and sponsor’s 
requirements. When reviewing data collection procedures, the discussion will also include 
identification and documentation of source data items.
The sponsor/designee will monitor the site activity  to verify  that the:
Data are authentic, accurate and complete. 
Safety  and rights of subjects are being protected
Study  is conducted in accordance with the currently  approved protocol 
(including stud y treatment being used in accordance with the protocol)
Any other study  agreements, GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements are met.
The investigator and the head of the medical institution (where applicable) agrees to allow the 
monitor direct access to all relevant documents.
11.3 Data processing
Data will be collected as described in Section 11.1. Clinical data management will be 
performed in accordance with applicable sponsor’s/CRO’s standards and data cleaning 
procedures. This is applicable for data recorded on eCRF as well as for data from other 
sources (e.g. I xRS, laboratory , adjudication committees).
For data coding (e.g. AEs, medication), internationally  recognized and accepted dictionaries 
will be used.

12 MAR 2019    Version 3.0 Page:  93of [ADDRESS_860799] who has withdrawn from study  drug to attend any  visit(s) in 
person, the site staff will keep in touch with the subject by  [CONTACT_643068]/herself, or to a person pre -designated by  [CONTACT_423], in accordance with the 
subject’s study  visit schedule. Data will continue to be collected about the subject’s health 
status, including information on developi[INVESTIGATOR_643019]. 
This information may  be provided either by  [CONTACT_43094]/herself, his/her general 
practitioner or a famil y relative (if allowed in the respective country ). Data, such as 
information on survival and potential protocol- specified endpoints, might be also collected 
from a healthcare provider, from public or medical records, or other sources as available 
according to local guidelines and a s allowed by  [CONTACT_427]. These data will be collected 
until the study  is concluded, even if the subject no longer attends study  visits in person, 
unless the subject withdrew consent and did not agree to release further information.
When an event date is not known, the site investigator will be asked to provide a best -estimate 
as to when the event occurred. Even though the exact date of an event is unknown, the 
investigator often has some information that would give an approximate date (e.g. the 
firstweek of a month, the fall of a year, or the middle of a particular y ear) or at least the 
date when the subject was last seen or contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. This information can be meaningfully  
incorporated into the estimated date recorded, as this is likely  to be close r to the true date than 
any produced by  [CONTACT_643069]. This estimated date should be the 
middle date within the period that the event is known to have occurred. If the event is known 
to have occurred in the first week of a month, then the date in the middle of that week should 
be recorded as the estimate. If it occurred in the fall of a y ear, then the middle date in the fall 
is the appropriate estimate. If no information is known, then the date in the middle of the 
plausible time period s hould be given, based on the last contact [CONTACT_643070].
Data from subjects who prematurel y terminate the study  will be used to the maximum extent 
possible. All missing or partial data will be presented in the subject data listing as they  are 
recorded on the eCRF. Data are collected primarily  through an EDC sy stem, which allows 
ongoing data entry  and monitoring.
For those subjects who withdraw consent, sensitivity  analy ses will be performed to assess the 
impact of potential informative censoring of such subjects. These will include the use of

endpoint as having an event or being censored.
11.5 Audit and inspection
To ensure compliance with GCP and regulatory  requirements, a member of the sponsor’s (or a 
designated CRO’s) quali ty assurance unit may  arrange to conduct an audit to assess the 
performance of the study at the study  site and of the study  documents originating there. The 
investigator/institution will be informed of the audit outcome.
In addition, inspections by [CONTACT_643071](s)/I RB(s) are 
possible. The investigator should notify  the sponsor immediately  of any  such inspection.
The investigator/institution agrees to allow the auditor or inspector direct access to all relevant 
document s and allocate his/her time and the time of his/her staff to the auditor/inspector to 
discuss findings and an y issues. Audits and inspections may  occur at an y time during or after 
completion of the study .
11.[ADDRESS_860800] that ensures that they  
are readil y available upon authorities’ request.
Patient (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) files will be archived according to local regulations and in accordance with 
the maximum period of time permitted by  [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307], institution or private practice. Where 
the archiving procedures do not meet the minimum timelines required b y the sponsor, 
alternative arrangements must be made to ensure the availability  of the source documents for 
the required period.
The investigator/insti tution notifies the sponsor if the archival arrangements change (e.g. 
relocation or transfer of ownership).
The investigator site file is not to be destroy ed without the sponsor’s approval.
The contract with the investigator/institution will contain all re gulations relevant for the study  site.
12. Premature termination of the study
The sponsor has the right to close this study  (or, if applicable, individual segments thereof 
[e.g. centers]) at an y time, which may  be due but not limited to the following reasons: 
If risk -benefit ratio becomes unacceptable owing to, for example,
Safety  findings from this study  (e.g. SAEs)
Results of any  interim analy sis
Results of parallel clinical studies
CONFIDENTIAL Integrated Clinical Study Protocol

12 MAR 2019    Version 3.0 Page:  95of 136
Results of parallel animal studies 
(on e.g. toxicity , teratogenicity , carci nogenicity  or reproduction toxicity ).
If the study  conduct (e.g. recruitment rate; drop -out rate; data quality ; protocol compliance) 
does not suggest a proper completion of the trial within a reasonable time frame .
The investigator has the right to close h is/her center at any  time.
For an y of the above closures, the following applies:
Closures should occur only  after consultation between involved parties. Final decision 
on the closure must be in writing.
All affected institutions (e.g. IEC(s)/IRB(s); competent authority(ies); study center; 
head of stud y center) must be informed as applicable according to local law.
All study  materials (except documentation that has to remain stored at site) must be 
returne d to the sponsor. The investigator will retain all other documents until 
notification is given b y the sponsor for destruction.
In the event of a partial study  closure, ongoing subjects must be taken care of in an 
ethical manner.
Details for individual subject's withdrawal can be found in Section 6.4.1.
13. Ethical and legal aspects
13.1 Investigator(s) and other study personnel
All other study  personnel not in cluded in this section are identified in a separate personnel list 
(not part of this clinical study  protocol) as appropriate. This list will be updated as needed; an 
abbreviated version with personnel relevant for the centers will be available in each cent er’s 
investigator site file.
Whenever the term ‘ investigator
’ is noted in the protocol text, it may  refer to either the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_8921], or an appropriately  qualified, trained and delegated 
individual of the investigational site.
The pri ncipal investigator of each center must sign the protocol signature [CONTACT_573577] (e.g. health authority , ethics committee, sponsor) 
before subject recruitment may  start at the respective center. Likewise, all amendm ents to the 
protocol must be signed by  [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_358000].
A complete list of all participating centers and their investigators, as well as al l required 
signature [CONTACT_9002], will be maintained in the sponsor’s study  file.
The global sponsor of this study is identified on the title page of this protocol. I f required by  
[CONTACT_1769], local co -sponsors will be nominated; they  will be identified on the respective 
country -specific signature [CONTACT_1787].

The Executive Committee, which consists of external experts in the area of nephrology , 
diabetology  and ca rdiology , will ensure the overarching integrit y of the study. 
TheExecutive Committee will be established for Study  [ZIP_CODE] and Study  [ZIP_CODE]. The 
committee’s responsibilities include the following: 
Review feedback from the independent DMC
Input into the Clinical Event Committee (CEC) charter
Provision of recommendations regarding sub -studies and amendments to the protocol
Contribution to and oversight of publications and communication of study  results
Projecting stud y termination, and other study -related activities as appropriate
Overseeing overall blinded event rates to ensure that they  meet protocol projections.
Decisions will be made by  [CONTACT_21128]; in the absence of consensus, the co -Chairs of the 
Executive Committee will provide their recommendation to the Sponsor for final determination .
Clinical Event Committee (CEC) 13.1.2
A Clinical Event Committee (CEC), blinded to study  treatment assignment, will adjudicate all 
events that could potentially  fulfill the criteria for the primary , secondary  or other endpoint s 
during the stud y. 
The CEC Charter will describe the roles and responsibilities of the CEC and define the events to 
be adjudicated and the manner in which they  will be adjudicated. The CEC will judge whether 
an event meets the predetermined definitions. The co -Chairs of the CEC will be members of the 
Executive Committee established for Study  [ZIP_CODE] and Study  [ZIP_CODE].
All of the endpoint events shown in 
Table 13–1 will be reported to the CEC.

NOTE: reporting guidelines for AEs and SAEs as outlined in Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and9.6.1.[ADDRESS_860801] be followed if the event is not a defined endpoint (see Table 13–1 ).
Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) 13.1.[ADDRESS_860802] of the study will be performed by [CONTACT_643074]. An independent statistical analy sis center (SAC) will be involved in 
processing unblinded safety  data for the DMC. Analy sis periods and procedur es will be 
defined in an operational charter (DMC charter) filed in the study  file. 
Outcome events as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 will not be rep orted as AEs or SAEs by  [CONTACT_4520]; however, they  will be collected in the eCRF. The independent DMC will 
periodicall y review and assess all outcome events as well as safet y data from the study  for 
imbalances in safet y outcomes in an unblinded manne r. It is believed that in this way , patient 
safety can continue to be monitored throughout the duration of the trial, and the integrit y of the 
study  maintained. If unexpected safet y issues are identified, specific amendments will be 
implemented based on th e recommendation of the DMC .
Following data review, the DMC will provide written recommendations that will be

12 MAR 2019    Version 3.0 Page:  106of [ADDRESS_860820] global amendment dated 02 MAY 2017. The following is an 
overview of the changes made to the original Protocol Version 1.0.
Overview of changes to the study 15.1.1
The original protocol for this study  was amended for the following reasons:
1)To account for the lower than expected recruitment rate, the duration of study  and the 
number of sites required worldwide were increased.
2)To allow re -screening at an earlier stage and even if the reason for initial screen failure 
was an elevated blood potassium value, the re
-screening rules were amended.
3)To allow randomization of patients with a recent CVD epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (i.e. those suffering 
from stroke, transient ischemic cerebral attack, ac ute coronary  syndrome or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_643025] 30 day s prior to the Screening 
visit), the respective Exclusion criterion (#7) was modified.
4) In order to allow up- titration of study  drug at any  time during the stud y (from Vi sit 2 
onwards), the i nstructions for u p-titration were modified . Additionally , a requirement 
to specify  the reason for not dispensing the 20 mg dose in the eCRF was added.
5)The recommended b lood pressure target s after randomization were updated according 
tothe most recent literature.
6) Definitions of the endpoint “kidney  failure ”and the definitions of cardiovascular 
disease history  for stratification purposes were added.
7)Administrative changes : 
Sponsor name [CONTACT_36732] (Bay er AG became the sponsor for ongoing Bay er 
HealthCare AG sponsored studies on 1stJuly 2016), Sponsor for US territory was 
added , contact [CONTACT_643076]’s medical expert [INVESTIGATOR_643085]
, and terminology  
changes due to updated Operating Instructions (“protocol deviation” was replaced b y 
“validity  finding”) were made . 
8) T o improve clarit y and correct t ypographical errors or inconsistencies.

Changes to the protocol text 15.1.2
In the sections on changes to the protocol text, all protocol sections affected by  [CONTACT_643077]; the sequence of the sections follows the structure of the most re cent 
previous protocol version. As applicable, changes to the protocol text are highlighted as 
follows:
Addition of a whole new portion Brief identification of the new portion
Removal of a whole portion Complete display  of the removed portion, formatted 
as crossed out
Editing of an existing portion Comparative presentation of “old text” versus “new 
text”, with “old text” referring to the most recent 
previous protocol version. Deletion s are crossed out
in the “old text”. Additions are underlined in the 
“new text”. 
Tables / figures The term “amended” is added to the caption.
Terminological changes Brief specification of the terminological change
Thus, in this section, a terminological change (e.g. 
“period” versus “epoch”) is defined only  once, 
without display ing “old text” versus “new text” for 
each appearance.
Corrections of typos are not highlighted in this section.

by [CONTACT_643083]. Th e 
KDQOL -SF is based on the SF -36 with additional questions specific to kidney  disease 
concerning s ymptoms and problems, effects of kidney  disease on daily  life, burden of 
kidney disease, cogniti ve function, work status, sexual function, quality  of social interaction, 
and sleep ( 57). It was developed for use with a dialy sis patient population but it has al so been 
found to be valid and reliable in a kidney  transplant patient population (58). Studies using the 
KDQOL revealed that psy
chological factors, including depression, were a much stronger 
determinant of quality of life than biological measures like dial ysis adequacy  (59). While the 
KDQOL -SF has 134 questions the shorter form KDQOL -
36 consists of 36 questions and 
contains the SF- 12. The items of the KDQOL -36 are grouped as shown in Table 16–4.
The EQ-
5D-5L was introduced in 2005. The EQ -5D-5L still consists of 2 pages: the 
EQ-5D- 5L descriptive s ystem and the EQ Visual Analogue scale (EQ VAS). 
Thedescriptive system comprises the same 5 dimensions as the EQ- 5D- 3L (mobil ity, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). However, each dimension 
now has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and

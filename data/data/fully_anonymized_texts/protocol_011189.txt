 Page 2 of 34    1.0 Objectives / Specific Aims Overview: Chronic pain and fatigue are among the most pervasive and expensive health complaints in the [LOCATION_002], with 53% of adults aged 65 and older (about 18.7 million) reporting pain at any one time (Patel et al., 2013), and 31% of those over [ADDRESS_221091] proposes to evaluate feasibility of Activate for Life, an integrated home-telehealth delivered intervention that combines Otago +Yoga + Behavioral Activation to address both physical and mental health factors to increase likelihood of successful Aging in Place. The Otago Exercise Program (OEP) focuses on strength and balance training7, and is endorsed by [CONTACT_6750]8 as an effective fall prevention intervention8,9; Yoga (including asana/poses and pranayama/breathing;) emphasizes balance and stretching, and can be practiced even by [CONTACT_187233], and Behavioral Activation (BA) addresses withdrawal and social isolation to enhance mental health and is an evidence based intervention for depression validated with older adults, including validation of its effectiveness by [CONTACT_2296], when delivered via home based telehealth10-12. PREMISE: This project conceptualizes factors that negatively influence aging in place, namely pain, fatigue and mental health problems within the socio-ecological model to explain the multiple dynamic and complex influences that impact their presentation. For example, pain and fatigue in older adults may reduce their mobility, which reduces muscle tone and increases risk of falls. Reduced mobility also contributes to social isolation, thereby [CONTACT_187234]. These factors constitute a negative feedback loop, amplified in many older adults by [CONTACT_187235], that perpetuate deterioration in both physical and mental spheres, leading to reduced ability to Age in Place. Therefore, the potential benefit of a comprehensive, integrated treatment, delivered directly into older adults’ homes via telehealth technology, to address both physical and emotional health dimensions, as well as limited access to transportation, is high. Preliminary pi[INVESTIGATOR_187185]-delivered Otago Exercise Program revealed high rates of participation and satisfaction, and most important, significant improvement in physical stability and movement. However, high levels of anxiety and depression were observed, indicating a potential need to complement Otago with mindfulness and action-based strategies to reduce negative mental health symptoms while addressing pain and fatigue symptoms.  We subsequently added Yoga and telehealth delivered Behavioral Activation to the program in one series of participants and would like to fully explore the effectiveness of this integrated intervention.  Thus, the Overall Aim of the present proposal is to evaluate the feasibility of an integrated mind-body intervention, Activate for Life, to improve overall physical activity and mental health and reduce pain and fatigue, resulting in increased likelihood of Aging in Place. Both subjective self-report (i.e., NIH PROMIS measures of pain, fatigue, depression and anxiety) and objective accelerometer data will be collected, along with standardized measures of balance, strength, and stability.  In addition, the measures will be complemented with biomarker-based measures of stress, including cortisol based and 1,5-AG assays before, during, and after treatment that are correlated with stress, and fatigue symptoms.

Self-management of pain and fatigue through strength and balance training in low-income older adults can improve quality of life, decrease health care costs, and increase the ability of the person with these symptoms to age in place.   2.[ADDRESS_221095] is by [CONTACT_187237], the preferred option for older adults from both the perspectives of older adults themselves, and the healthcare community. The population of older adults in the [LOCATION_002] is growing rapi[INVESTIGATOR_187188] 206013.  Older adults numbered 46.2 million in 2014, which represents about 14.5% of the total U.S. population13. By 2060 the projected number of older adults will be about 98 million13. However, this population is financially ill equipped to address care needs that often accompany aging, hence, maintaining health to ‘age in place’ is key. For example, in 2013 4.2 million (9.5%) older adults were below the poverty level13.  This was an increase from 9.1% in 201213. Another 5.6% or 2.5 million older adults were classified as “near poor” or having income between the poverty level and 25% above this level in the [LOCATION_002]13. Not only is there a lack of resources to pay for qualified caregivers, and a lack of qualified caregivers themselves, there is also a lack of facilities to accommodate the elderly who may not be able to care for themselves in their home environment even if they could afford it14. This underscores the importance of interventions to facilitate aging in place, especially for the low-income elderly.  Moreover, 90% of adults [ADDRESS_221096] on average $86,000 in a

Pain and fatigue are significant barriers to aging in place. A retrospective study conducted in the [LOCATION_002] based on the National Health and Aging Trends Study found the incidence of chronic pain in adults aged 65 and older to be 52.9% (about 18.7 million)18. Similarly, fatigue affects 31% of adults [ADDRESS_221098] through physical conditioning and self-management interventions, except in the small minority of instances where the Medicare eligible recipi[INVESTIGATOR_187189] (PT) and determined to be: 1) homebound, 2) to qualify due to specific criteria, or 3) is under the order of their physician. In addition, PT for qualifying Medicare patients is epi[INVESTIGATOR_49564], or time and visit limited, and not ongoing20. As such, PT, and PT under Medicare is not a viable option to address pain and fatigue in older adults.  The need for Comprehensive behavioral health pain and fatigue management programs.   Physical activity can improve strength and endurance, overall health, and quality of life among older adults with chronic conditions, which in turn may reduce hospi[INVESTIGATOR_187190]21.  The impact of physical activity on joints may reduce a person’s pain by [CONTACT_187238], density and quality of connective tissues, and potentially on bony mass22. There is no evidence of increased pain with physical activities such as exercise, although this belief may be a barrier for older adults with pain in starting an exercise routine2.   A large meta-analysis of self-management programs for pain reported by [CONTACT_187239].[ADDRESS_221099]: Otago (Balance), Yoga (Strengthening and Mindfulness), and Behavioral Activation (Motivation and Affect).   Otago and Balance:  Otago is a muscle strengthening and balance retraining program that can be delivered to the participant in their home. Otago was implemented and test in four randomized control trials of [ADDRESS_221100] effective for adults 80 years and older, men and women benefited equally, and participants’ strength and balance improved markedly as assessed by [CONTACT_187240]-Stage Balance tests. The Otago exercise program is endorsed by [CONTACT_187241]19, decreasing falls in older adults by 35%. 20-23

 Page 5 of 34  Gentle Yoga and Yogic Breathing (GYYB) and Pain: In chronic pain, there is high contribution of the static load, due to habitual deep muscle tension that adversely affect microcirculation within muscles and the underlying viscera24. Yoga reduces the electromyographic activity in the musculoskeletal system and promotes relaxation (Balambekar, 1969)25. Awareness and progressive relaxation attained by [CONTACT_187242] a substantial proportion of pain and the person feels more in control, which itself promotes pain reduction24. Yoga influences the endocrine system by [CONTACT_187243], muscle contraction and pressure release resulting in reduced abdominal pain26 Muscle stretching could potentially lead to the release of endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]27 thus could reduce the need for exogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. While pain modifies frequency, depth and pattern of respi[INVESTIGATOR_187191], shallow, and thoracic breathing, the practice of Pranayama with long exhalation cycles relaxes the musculoskeletal system, increases the tonicity of parasympathetic response, and reduces overall stress, which together could reduce pain28-29. Diaphragmatic breathing is probably the single most valuable thing that a patient in chronic pain can learn on the road to recuperation24. Yoga practices, more commonly the ones involved in postures, has been used to test its usefulness in improving the quality of life in the aging population. In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_187192] a community dwellers (mean age 68), the participants performed twice a week group yoga with an instructor for [ADDRESS_221101]. Balasubramanian (co-I) has developed a combination of gentle yoga and yogic breathing (GYYB) program for people with limited mobility (GYYB handout, Balasubramanian). The GYYB program has been pi[INVESTIGATOR_187193], and in a community dwelling elderly population and have shown feasibility, acceptance and a strong interest to continue the practice because of the perceived improvement (unpublished data).  Yoga and Biomarkers:  The Balasubramanian lab (Co-I) has shown that acute practice of 20 minutes yogic breathing exercises stimulate salivary expression of nerve growth factor, immune response markers, and a reduction in inflammatory cytokines31-33. In a recent study 90 minutes of Yoga practice among the elderly (mean age 60) has been shown to stimulate salivary immune function (increased salivary IgA and testosterone), and decreased stress hormones (cortisol)34. Several recent studies have suggested saliva as a potential biomarker source in various physiological conditions35,36. Due to the non-invasive collection method involved, and the availability of procedures to quantify stress, mood and pain related biomolecules saliva could be preferred over blood sampling among the elderly. Cortisol is a glucocorticoid hormone expressed in the saliva and is commonly used as an indicator of stress due to the activation of hypothalamus - pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] - adrenal cortex (HPA) axis, and aging is associated with an increased levels of salivary cortisol (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27377692). Yoga practice reduces the salivary cortisol level among older adults. 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) is a biomarker for hyperglycemia (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25249070) and is found to be reduced in aging (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7835210; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27036001) . Both clinical and preclinical studies suggest that exercises could increase the levels of 1,5-AG (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15094482; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28210043). This will be the first study that fully examines the impact of yoga practice on the levels of 1,5-AG.   Behavioral activation (BA) and Depression. Behavioral Activation is a manualized treatment for depression (Lejuez, Hopko, & Hopko, 2001) that has gained support for its efficacy11,  Lejuez, Hopko, LePage, Hopko, & McNeil, 2001; Hopko et al., 2002). The primary goal of this intervention is to increase patients’ engagement in social and healthy activities (e.g., interacting with supportive family and friends, community bingo, yoga, Otago) that are likely to produce reinforcement in the natural environment. Learning theory47 forms the theoretical model supporting Behavioral Activation, which is hypothesized to reduce depression symptoms via increased frequency and density of reinforcing and personal values-consistent activities. This shift in balance of activities and reinforcement density

One of the strengths of BA, relative to other cognitive behavioral and activation-based interventions, is that it is designed to incorporate components of complementary treatments. Specifically, BA is heavily reliant on identifying and scheduling healthy behaviors, and on identify and resolving barriers to implementation of these scheduled behaviors.  These healthy activities are often specifically derived from complementary interventions. As such, it may be conceptualized as an ‘framework’ intervention, upon which other intervention components, such as Otego and Yoga, can be hung.   Gap in knowledge related to using telehealth delivered programs to improve pain/fatigue and facilitate self-management in older adults. There is little literature regarding the use of mHealth (e.g., tablet based applications) and eHealth (e.g., televideo via tablet) as a platform for nurse-managed (and eventual self-managed) pain in older adults.22 A recent integrative review of the literature noted that a large proportion of older adults own a computer, tablet, and/or smartphone and regularly access the Internet.22 This review points out that while there is little evidence of using digital technology for pain management in older adults, using an interprofessional approach along with high quality interventions, strong technical support and training, and connectedness with clinicians and increased self-awareness through personal diaries  may provide a strong platform for its use in clinical practice.22 Incidentally, none of the studies in this review addressed low-income older adults.   PREMISE: This project conceptualizes factors that negatively influence aging in place, namely problems associated with pain, fatigue and mental health, within the socio-ecological model to explain the multiple dynamic and complex influences that impact their presentation. For example, pain and fatigue in older adults may reduce their mobility, which reduces muscle tone and increases risk of falls. Reduced mobility also contributes to social isolation, thereby [CONTACT_187234]. These factors constitute a negative feedback loop, amplified in many older adults by [CONTACT_187235], that perpetuate deterioration in both physical and mental spheres, leading to reduced ability to Age in Place. Therefore, the potential benefit of a comprehensive, integrated treatment, delivered directly into older adults’ homes via telehealth technology, to address both physical and emotional health dimensions, as well as limited access to transportation, is high.  Preliminary studies. Preliminary pi[INVESTIGATOR_187185]-delivered Otago Exercise Program revealed high rates of participation and satisfaction, and most important, significant improvement in physical stability and movement. However, high levels of anxiety and depression were observed, indicating a potential need to complement Otago with mindfulness and action-based strategies to reduce negative mental health symptoms while addressing pain and fatigue symptoms.  We subsequently added Yoga and telehealth delivered Behavioral Activation to the program in one series of participants and intend to fully explore the effectiveness of this integrated intervention.  INNOVATION: Otago only does balance and strengthening, y+O does balance and strengthening, and pain control, adding ba addresses motivation and depression so Activate for Life adds motivation An interprofessional (IP) team of nursing, physical therapy and behavioral health clinical researchers will be collaborating to develop “Activate for Life” to address pain and fatigue by [CONTACT_187245]- efficacy in low-income elderly. This project is innovative in the following ways: • Integrates mHealth and eHealth 
Version #7.1 3/4/21 
 Page 7 of 34  • Uses eHealth (televideo) to deliver interventions directly into participant’s homes, dramatically enhancing convenience and overcoming barriers related to rurality • Uses real time (EMA) activity monitoring and feedback with easily understood data presentation graphics to inform both patient and provider on progress through an application (app) on the tablet  • Uses ECA to assess parameter violations and trigger televideo visit for motivation/problem solving session with nurse  3.[ADDRESS_221102] Timeline:  This 12-week feasibility trial will use a 3x3 repeated measures (treatment x time) between groups randomized trial design to compare Otago (OG) vs. Otago + Yoga (GYYB) vs. Otago + GYYB + Behavioral Activation (ie., the complete Activate for Life intervention) in low-income older adults with chronic pain and/or fatigue at baseline, post-treatment and 3- month follow-up. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. Daily self-monitoring of program component adherence, PROMIS self-report measures of pain, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and social support. Physical activity measures will include actigrography, steps per day, 2-minute timed walk test, sit-to-stand test, and Mini-Best. Participants will be 30 adults (10 per group) age 60 and above with a PROMIS pain interference score of eight or above and/or a PROMIS pain behavior score of 15 or above (cut points based on a T-score that rescales the raw score into a standardized score with a mean of [ADDRESS_221103] deviation (SD) of 10 for each of these instruments).  Alternative design: The progressive nature of this feasibility trial allows the proven evidence-based modalities of OEP and GYYB to be combined with behavioral activation to not only address physical activity but also the mental health aspects of chronic pain and fatigue. Therefore, this feasibility trial scaffolds the components to show that the modalities of OEP and GYYB are effective and their success is dependent on motivation. However, we are not testing these three interventions alone, or in every possible combination.  Supplemental ARM 4 - Design Overview:  For the supplement, the CON SSMC will leverage its expertise in technology-enhanced SM interventions and community-engaged research to establish the feasibility of an mHealth GYYB (physical activity + breathing) intervention on adherence, acceptability, and short-term health outcomes related to burden in CG of PWD. We will recruit 20 older CG who are caring for PWAD/ADRD receiving services in social and medical RCCs connected with an active R01 investigation, Mealtime Partnerships for People with Dementia at Respi[INVESTIGATOR_187194] (R01 NR016466; PI: [INVESTIGATOR_187195]). Two data collection points will occur at the beginning (Week 1, pre-intervention, or baseline, “V1”) and end (Week 12, post-intervention; “V2”) of the 12-week study. Preliminary changes in CG health indicators such as physical function, fatigue, depression, and social isolation as well as CG/PWD QoL will be examined to support a future RCT and build opportunities for faculty training in dyadic analyses. The relationship between salivary stress biomarkers (cortisol and 1,5-anhydroglucitol, or 1,5- AG) and self-reported reduction in stress symptoms will also be examined. Based on results from past SSMC studies, we posit that adherence will be adequate (≥80% scheduled activity compliance), satisfaction will be high (≥80%), attrition will be limited (≤25%), and follow-up data collection sufficient (≤20% missing data) to establish the validity of a future, full-scale RCT.  4.0 Study Enpoints (all ARMS) Study end points include: Successful study completion, participant consent withdrawal, and PI [INVESTIGATOR_187196], loss of contact [CONTACT_10970], and/or unexpected adverse events.

We will devise and use IRB approved study recruitment flyers and letters that will be dessimated electronically and handed to RCC caregivers, as well as directly contact [CONTACT_187249]. In addition, we will conduct outreach activities and enage outside network RCC providers in the local community to inform them of the opportunity for their clients to participate in this study.  9.0 Consent Process (ALL ARMS) In-person Research activities will not be conducted without the patient’s written informed consent. Informed consent will be conducted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or their designee as noted on the IRB study delegation log, and will occur in the comfort and privacy of a private room at the facility or the participant’s place of residence prior to any screening procedures being conducted and/or data collection. Potential participants will be given the informed consent document to read and review in advance, and/or may have it read to them by [CONTACT_41314], if they prefer. After reviewing the consent document, the patient will be given the opportunity to ask any questions about the study that they may have, and will be requested to demonstrate what is expected from them should they agree to enroll in the study through a questioning of their understanding of study procedures and risks. Prior to consenting, all questions will be resolved to the patient’s satisfaction. If a participant does not appear to understand the information contained within the Consent document or of what is expected of them as a study subject, then the study coordinator will review the consent document again with the participant. If after this second review, the subject does not demonstrate an understanding, they will not be enrolled in the study. Only participants, with no observed cognitive impairment, will be consented and enrolled into the study.

The tablet will be an iPad air 2, which has the communication protocol to connect to all these devices and send encrypted data securely back to servers. In addition, the participants will be given and receive training on a Garmin Vivofit wearable activity tracker that is able to record, steps taken per day, heart rate, distance walked, stairs climbed, and sleep. Garmin Vivofit wearable fitness trackers meet high reliability and validity requirements for parameters such as step counts (Simunek et al., 2016). The training will  be conducted via a prerecorded video shown to participants on their tablet at the initial meeting that also explains the program rationale, use of the tablet, activity tracker, and video and app platforms.

Vidyo, a real-time software video communication tool, is HIPAA Compliant with all of the media, signaling, and user login being encrypted to ensure patient privacy and compliance (Vidyo, 2014).28 Each tablet will contain the app  “Activate for Life”. This app will allow the participant to transmit, via Bluetooth technology their blood pressure and pulse. The app also allows the participant to rate their pain and fatigue scores on a 1-[ADDRESS_221110] a voice diary of their daily progress or thoughts. Each participant will receive a blood pressure cuff and will take their blood pressure prior to participating in their PA for the day. The blood pressure and pulse information from the blood pressure monitor will be transferred via Bluetooth to the Activate For Life app on the participants iPad. Once the app has received the data, it will automatically upload the information to the server at MUSC and will be available to be reviewed by [CONTACT_5051]. The app will also allow for the participants to input their pain and fatigue scores which will be utilized to monitor pain scores on a daily basis. The vital signs and pain scores will allow for individualizing of the physical activity program to increase or decrease activity based on worsening, improving, or stability of participant’s pain as measured by [CONTACT_187253]. Weekly telehealth visits will allow for delivery of each conditions intervention components, review of pain and/or fatigue, VS, and sleep data.

Each Otago will be tailored for each participant’s ability level. See exercise prescription in Table 1.   3C3.B. Otago + GYYB + (GYYB): The GYYB program will be administered to the participants by a qualified and certified Yoga instructor in a group setting once a week for 12 weeks. The GYYB is a one-hour program containing gentle physical Yoga postures that participants could practice sitting on a chair for 30 minutes. These exercises are designed based on improving the overall flexibility, bodily control and mindfulness in movements. Following the gentle yoga postures, the participants will perform Yogic breathing exercises for 30 minutes. These exercises are known to promote relaxation, mood, pain and anxiety scores that are highly relevant to the target population and are reported to stimulate measurable biomarker changes in the saliva. During the in-person session the Yoga instructor will explain the GYYB program to participants in the Otago+GYYB group each exercise and their perceived benefits. The participants will have a chance to practice the exercises in the presence of the instructor and clarify any question that they might have about the exercises. The instructor will make sure that the participants can perform the exercises independently. The participants will be provided with a video and a handout for the study exercises that they will follow for 1 hour every day (any time at their preference). Any deviations in the practice will be noted by [CONTACT_187255] a diary indicating the length of the practice with date on it. Saliva samples will be collected at the beginning and end of the sessions on week [ADDRESS_221112] in this group.   3C3.C. Otago plus GYYB + Behavior Activation (Activate for Life).  This condition will incorporate OEP and GYYB as above and will also include behavioral activation to address motivation and affect. Behavioral Activation incorporates daily planners and worksheets to identify and rate reinforcing behaviors and is often used in conjunction with other interventions because components of these interventions are easily incorporated into the daily planner based activities. Each participant outlines general values and specific behaviors that ‘demonstrate’ each value, compi[INVESTIGATOR_49151] a list of the latter. This list is then used to generate [ADDRESS_221113], simple structure of these sessions. Patients begin with a weekly self-monitoring exercise, charting behaviors and mood every hour, that serves as a baseline assessment of daily activities, and orients the patient to the quality and quantity of his or her activities on a daily basis. Also, baseline assessment assists in generating ideas about activities to target during treatment.   Session 1: Begins with rationales for Behavioral Activation. The core points made are that what one does often plays a role in how one feels. Clients then proceed to identify 5 classes of values (e.g., family, work, spi[INVESTIGATOR_25824]) with specific behaviors that ‘show’ the patient’s value, thus the treatment is tailored for each individual. For example, the value ‘time with family’ might be shown by ‘throwing the baseball with son for 20 minutes’. Lists of specific behaviors are derived for each value and written on the daily planner. Participants are then given a daily planning calendar and behaviors that are reinforcing and relatively easily accomplished are planned each day, for two days in advance with the objective of planning at least 2 hours of reinforcing activities and scheduled homework from Otago and GYYB each day. Session 2: Begins with a review of homework and verbal reinforcement of completed planners, completed reinforcing behaviors, completed Otago and GYYB homework,

 Page 13 of 34  restatement of the rationale (ie., that what one does affects how one feels and doing positive things will help one to feel positively), and problem solving. Behaviors that were consistently planned but not completed are removed and alternative behaviors suggested. The next 2 days’ activities are planned. This session usually involves a significant amount of problem solving, and identification of avoidance, with planning in place to counter this avoidance. Sessions 3-4: These sessions begin with a review of homework, followed by [CONTACT_187256], in their own words, their interpretation of the rationale for Behavioral Activation. Obstacles to completing behaviors are discussed and additional exposure-based and reinforcing behaviors are generated. The next 2 day’s activities are planned. Session 5: Includes discussion of the rationale and treatment gains obtained thus far. Discussion is also centered on the need to continue planning activities and using a daily planner for at least 6 months. Relapse prevention strategies are reviewed. Additional sessions are conducted every other week until week 12 (Otago and GYYB completion).

Will will collect social security numbers for MUSC IRS tax reporting purposes.  11.0 Specimen Collection and Banking  Saliva Sample Collection (all ARMS): One 3mL saliva samples will be collected from participants at each of the three study visits. At the first two visits (baseline and week 12) the samples will be collected before and after the 30 minutes GYYB session. Saliva will be naturally allowed to accumulate in the oral cavity and the participant will discharge it into the specimen tube (5 mL capacity) with lid. Due to COVID-19 precautions, participants will be given the option to either 1) drop off their saliva samples at MUSC CON, or 2) to arrange to have their saliva sample pi[INVESTIGATOR_187202] a location that is convenient to both themselves and the researchers. Immediately after collection the saliva samples will labelled with the participant’s study ID number and the collection dates, and then placed on ice for immediate transporation to MUSC in a biohazard cooler. The samples will subsequently be stored at -[ADDRESS_221119]. Balasubramanian at his lab. For analysis, the samples will be slowly thawed, centrifugation at [ZIP_CODE] RPM at 4 degree C.   Salivary Biomarker Measurement (all ARMS): Owing to their possible involvement in pain and/or fatigue, the following biomarkers will be assessed in saliva: cortisol and 1,5-AG. [CONTACT_187292] (Co-I) will perform the analysis of salivary biomarker expression in the saliva samples similar to their laboratory’s recent reports (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27538513; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25873979; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25101659). [CONTACT_187292] has over 20 years of experience in ELISA and other biochemical techniques for biomarker measurement (Balasubramanian, & Kuppuswamy, 2003; Balasubramanian et al., 2006; Balasubramanian, Mani, Kasiganesan, Baicu, & Kuppuswamy, 2010; Balasubramanian et al., 2012; Moschella et al., 2013; Prabhasankar, Ragupathi, Sundaravavidel, Annapoorani, & Damodaran, 1993).   Specimen access and disposal (all ARMS): A chain of custody log will be maintained for the collection, handling and disposition of all participant biological specimens. [CONTACT_187292] will only have access to unidentifiable biological data, which will be stored on MUSC secure servers. No genetic analysis or specimen banking will be conducted.

Revocation of consent either verbally or in writing will immediately withdraw the consent of the participant’s specimen analysis for any collected and unanalyzed saliva samples to date. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_187203]. Balasubramanian to notify him of consent withdrawals and to unblind group allocations for analysis purposes.  12.[ADDRESS_221120] determinations.   Data analysis plan.  Measures of feasibility including recruitment and reach, fidelity and adherence, formal satisfaction, and drop-out proportions will be evaluated. Then 95% confidence intervals for proportions will be used to estimate dichotomous outcomes (e.g., the proportion of subjects who: agree to participate out of the number that are approached, the proportion who complete the intervention, the proportion who report satisfaction with the intervention, and the proportion who exit the study prematurely [drop out]). Further, the participants' reasons for drop out, and problems/issues encountered with the intervention will be described via frequency distributions. For continuous measures (e.g. satisfaction scores), frequency distributions and the median and mean responses (with 95% confidence intervals) will be obtained. Formative and summative qualitative interviews will be recorded with the residents and students, transcribed, analyzed with discourse analysis36 and interpreted to evaluate the program design and effectiveness and to make necessary changes based on feedback. Univariate descriptive statistics and frequency distributions will be calculated as appropriate for all variables. Demographic variables obtained at baseline will be described via measures of central tendency (mean, median), variability and frequency distributions as appropriate. Additionally, characteristics for those who were eligible for study versus those who were not eligible and for those who adhered to the study protocol (study completers) versus those who did not adhere (non-adherers and drop-outs) will be compared to better describe the population for this study.  Data sharing with the NINR/NIH: As a condition of this National Institutes of Nursing Research (NINR) award, de-identified patient data will be shared by [CONTACT_187257] (https://cdrns.nih.gov/). The purpose of sharing this information is to build a NINR repository of data using Common Data Elements (CDE) for future research purposes among the general scientific community and for public health benefit. Patients will be allocated a random identifier through the NIH supported GUID Tool. The GUID Tool (https://cdrns.nih.gov/node/39) is a customized software application that generates a Global Unique Identifier for each study participant. The GUID is a subject ID that allows researchers to share data specific to a study participant without exposing personally identifiable information (PII). The GUID is made up of random alpha-numeric characters and is NOT generated from PII/PHI. As such, it has been approved by [CONTACT_187258].  GUID Generation complies with HIPPA regulations for the protection of PII/PHI. Patients are made aware of this data sharing agreement with the NINR/NIH in the study’s Informed Consent document. Further protections are afforded to participants through an NIH Certificate of Confidentiality conferred upon the study.  13.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects There is a well-developed and NIH/NINR prepared Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) that involves the use of a Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) which shall meet semi-annually post initial participant study enrollment.

Access to the research records, study database and PHI’s will be restricted to study personnel as approved by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_187212]. As with all studies conducted at MUSC, this study is also eligible for a random audit by [CONTACT_187266].  Data Processing. This study will use Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) for data capture and management. REDCap is a software toolset and workflow methodology for the electronic collection and management of research and clinical trials data. REDCap provides secure, web-based, flexible applications, including real-time validation rules with automated data type and range checks at the time of data entry. Exports are made available for several statistical packages including SPSS, SAS, SATA, R and Microsoft Excel. The study-specific REDCap electronic database will be designed and developed by [CONTACT_978], CI, or PC.  The provision of REDCap is made available through the South Carolina Clinical & Translational Research (SCTR) Institute at MUSC with NIH Grant awards UL1RR029882 and UL1TR000062.   Data Security. Ensuring data security, compliance with [ADDRESS_221122] Operating Procedures (SOP) to ensure a high level of data security while coordinating electronic and paper data management activities for clinical research trials. The REDCap study database will be hosted in the Biomedical Informatics secure data center at MUSC, a secure environment for data systems and servers on campus, and includes firewall, redundancy, failover capability, backups and extensive security checks. The secure data center has strict access control; only authorized core personnel may access the facility un-escorted. Only authorized users are allowed to connect to the network, and the security of the network is actively monitored.  Power and environmental controls have several layers of backups, from interruptible power supplies to alternate and redundant feeds to the local utility company. The REDCap system administrator contributes to the maintenance of institutional disaster recovery and business continuity plans.  Load balancers and a highly fault tolerant SAN infrastructure contribute to high availability.   The REDCap system itself has several additional layers of protection including password protection. Access to the data and its security is managed institutionally by [CONTACT_187267] a Shibboleth login with an MUSC issued NetID and features a user account management filter that controls who can access the data and to what degree. All personnel must pass an employment background check before being issued an ID. Password complexity, history and expi[INVESTIGATOR_187213]. Access to individual REDCap projects and their data is managed by [CONTACT_187268]. All transactions are securely delivered to the application using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL – SHA-1 with RSA Encryption; 2048-bits). It is then transmitted internally (behind the firewall) to the database server. All transactions are logged at the server layer (httpd logging), application layers (REDCap logs activity to a database table), and the database layer, using both query and binary logging. This feature provides audit trails for all changes, queries, data exports and reports. MUSC Information security policies are available at: https://mainweb-v.musc.edu/security/policy/   Data Entry. Only MUSC IRB approved study personnel that are authorized to have access to the REDCap study database will be granted password access. Study personnel using computers that are connected to the Internet will directly enter data into the remotely housed database. As such, no

Additionally, all personnel with access to the database will have current University of Miami CITI training in the Conduct of Human Subject Protections, and HIPAA and Information Security trainings that are completed annually. Each participant will be assigned a unique study identifier, all PHIs will be masked, and data exports will be limited to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_187214].  Data Monitoring. Ongoing quality control procedures will be implemented for data collection, storage and processing. The PM will conduct routine monthly monitoring of the study database and generate a report for review at study team meetings. Standing agenda items for these meetings will include participant recruitment and retention, AE’s, protocol deviations, data integrity and overall study conduct. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_187215]. Discrepancies that warrant clarification will be sent to appropriate parties for review and resolution. All data entry and changes made in the study database by [CONTACT_187269], and provide a transparent visible audit trail for reviewers.  SECTION C. Procedures for Identifying, Reviewing and Reporting Adverse Events 1) Identifying. Potential minimum risks identified for participants are outlined in the Protection of Human Participants and will also be outlined in the IRB-approved informed consent document. Additional unknown risks may occur and, if so, will be identified through diligent monitoring by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_187216]. During the informed consent process, participants will be advised of the potential risks of participation as identified in the IRB-approved informed consent document and reminded throughout the study that the researchers should be promptly informed about any concerns regarding potential side effects, adverse events, or clinical deterioration. Participants will also be instructed to notify the PI, PC, and/or designee of any suspected adverse events immediately if possible. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_187217]. The ISM will have real-time access to the study database to review and monitor all reported SAE that were reported as related to the intervention. Additionally, the BS will generate and provide de-identified cumulative administrative human participant semi-annual safety reports for the ISM and SMC to review.  2) Reviewing. Adverse events will be initially be assessed and graded by [CONTACT_187270]’s IRB Adverse Event Reporting Policy  http://academicdepartments.musc.edu/research/ori/irb/HRPP/HRPP Guide Section 4.7 • Expected/Anticipated—Identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the current protocol, informed consent, investigator brochure, or with other current risk information. • Unexpected/Unanticipated—Not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the current protocol, informed consent, investigator brochure, or with other current risk information. • More Prevalent—Occurs more frequently than anticipated or at a higher prevalence than expected. • Serious—Results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72010], results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, cancer, overdose, or causes a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  The relationship of adverse events to study participation will be determined by [CONTACT_187271]: • Unrelated—There is not a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641], device or intervention. 
Version #7.1 3/4/21 
 Page 22 of 34  • Possibly Related—The adverse event may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641], device, or intervention, however there is insufficient information to determine the likelihood of this possibility. • Related—There is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641], device or intervention.  3) Reporting. All reportable AE, SAE and unanticipated problems experienced by [CONTACT_187272]/NINR and MUSC IRB in compliance with their Adverse Event Reporting Policy requirements, using the IRB's password protected on-line secure server adverse event reporting system. Within 24 hours after a reportable AE, SAE or unanticipated problem has been reported by [CONTACT_2299], it will be graded by [CONTACT_187273], forwarded to the study’s ISM for review, and then will be submitted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_187218]. The Institutional Official(s) will review the event and discuss the report with the IRB Chair and the Director of the Office of Research Integrity. After IRB review and acknowledgement, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_187219], and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_187220] a copy of the reportable AE, SAE or unanticipated problem and IRB acknowledgement letter to the NIH/NINR Program Officer through MUSC’s OSRP. The activities will be reported to the NIH/NINR within 72hrs. In addition, all cumulative reportable AE, SAE and unanticipated problems included in the ISM reports will be submitted to the NIH/NINR in the PI’s Annual Progress Reports.  4) Examples of Potential Reportable Adverse Events: In accordance with MUSC IRB Adverse Event Reporting Policy, an AE is reportable is it meets all of the following criteria: 1) is unexpected 2) is related and/or possibly related, and 3) is serious and/or suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of physical or psychological harm than was previously known or recognized. Additionally, per MUSC’s policy all participant deaths, protocol deviations, complaints about the research, and breaches of confidentiality are reportable events. An example of an AE would be new onset chest pain and discomfort (symptom) that could potentially be associated with increased physical activity. The participant’s parent reported he/she recently ran out of his/her medication. The steps to be taken include withdrawing the subject from the study and inviting him or her to restart the study after symptoms subside. An example of an SAE would be the death of a participant from acute chest syndrome or stroke, which although would be viewed as unexpected and unrelated to the intervention is nonetheless a reportable serious event. No further steps would be taken except to review, grade and report the event. An example of an unanticipated problem would be the participant trips and falls while participating in the exercise program. The steps in this case would be to report the event as per the IRB and NINR policy, and to discuss appropriate actions regarding whether the participant should remain in the study with the ISM and SMC. These events and problems will be reported in accordance with the IRB and NIH/NINR policy as noted in Section C.3.  SECTION D. Multi-site Monitoring and Compliance This is not a multi-site study.  SECTION E. Assessment of External Factors The PI [INVESTIGATOR_48112] a semi-annual assessment of external factors through a review of literature related to new developments in the areas of self-management and symptom management of chronic pain and/or fatigue, symptom reporting and other approaches that may have an impact on the safety of participants or on the ethics of the study.   SECTION F. Interim Analysis This study aims to test the feasibility of a multi-component, technology-based intervention to promote self-management and symptom management of chronic pain and fatigue among low- income older adults. To our knowledge, there are no similar interventions specifically designed for this patient

As such, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_187221]-annual qualitative interim analysis reports on a) adverse events; and b) data obtained during phone call and returned end-of-study surveys to understand issues related to the uptake, usability, and adoption of this platform among this population. We will evaluate the screening and enrollment procedures, barriers to participation and retention, including, safety, adherence, acceptability, technology problems encountered if any, and user feedback from the participants and providers. This information gained from this structured process will be used to both guide the refinement of the current protocol and to inform the design of a larger efficacy trial. Interim analysis of outcome variables (pain, and fatigue) was not considered to avoid inexact inferences and increased chance of error due to few data points, as well as potential for bias if interim results were known to the investigators. Therefore, there are no planned stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_8441].  SUPPLEMENTAL ARM 4: DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING PLAN (DSMP)   SECTION A. Monitoring Entity Considering the study rationale, population, procedures, and the risk to benefit profile, the overall risk level for participation in this study is classified as: Minimum Risk. Accordingly, the study will employ the use of a Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) that will meet semi-annually post enrollment of the first participant into the study. The SMC members are charged with reviewing safety, trial progress, ethics, and with providing recommendations to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_187222], and termination.   1) Data Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) The study’s SMC is comprised of the following individual members: • Elaine Krug, PhD, RN, FAAN; Gerontological and Alzheimer’s Disease Expert (G/ADE) and Chair (C); • Martina Mueller, PhD; Biostatistician (BS); and, • Mohan Madisetti, MSc; Project Director (PD)    2) Individual Roles and Responsibilities Principal Investigator, (PI).

 Page 25 of 34  2) Minimizing Research-Associated Risk Diligent study safety monitoring will be conducted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_187224]’s continuing review process: 1. Tracking and follow-up of participant accrual including withdrawn consents will minimize risk by [CONTACT_68108], disclosing, and mitigating any potentially unknown risk(s) of harm to study participants. These risks are minimal. 2. Timely and appropriate reporting of informed consent process deficiencies, protocol deviations, privacy breaches, conflicts of interest, and/or changes in personnel. 3. Ongoing soliciting, monitoring and appropriate reporting of adverse event activities. 4. Timely and appropriate IRB submission of safety-related documents such as audit reports, sponsor progress reports, ISM reports, and other materials or communications that might impact the safe conduct of this study. 5. Active cooperation with the IRB, ACO, sponsor, and other applicable entities in the event of a random or for-cause internal or external audit.  Institution-Wide Assurances This protocol will be conducted fully in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_187210]’s Statement of Assurance, when submitted to the IRB as a required component of the MUSC IRB Human Research Review Application. An application will be submitted to the MUSC IRB if/when this project is approved and funded by [CONTACT_4289]/NINR. Assurances include the following safety-related agreements, signed and dated by [CONTACT_978].  3) Protecting Confidentiality of Participant Data Participant Screening and Enrollment. All data from participants screened for the study will be entered into electronic study database. Designated research staff will collect, gather, and enter required data (written informed consent, HIPAA Authorization, medical history and demographics) onto study data forms. Screened patients who do not meet study eligibility will have specific screening data entered into the study database. The collected data will be helpful in examining the patient population and feasibility of enrollment criteria and will include gender, age, race and reason for exclusion. All dates will be shifted and other Personal Health Information (PHI) will be removed from the study database upon study completion. All data obtained from this study will be used for research purposes only and will comply with Federal HIPAA regulations.  Master Screening and Enrollment Logs will be maintained by [CONTACT_187276] [INVESTIGATOR_187211].  Case Report Forms. All proposed study specific case report forms (source documents) for data collection will be designed by [CONTACT_187277] [INVESTIGATOR_187225], and transferred by [CONTACT_187278] (eCRFs) for use in the study’s REDCap database. These study specific eCRFs source documents (study logs for correspondence, contact [CONTACT_187279], compensation and other forms such as pre-eligibility screens) will be coded by [CONTACT_2299]’s unique study ID# for all data collected including study instruments will be maintained in the participant research record and/or their electronic medical record that will be made accessible to study monitors. Completed instruments that require signature [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a paper CRF will be scanned and uploaded into the study database to all for remote electronic safety monitoring as well as maintained on file in accordance with MUSC policies and applicable Federal Regulations for the Conduct of Human Participant Research.   Binders. The PD will prepare and maintain a participant-specific binder for each participant containing all non-eCRFs records. A regulatory file will also be maintained to include the IRB-
Version #7.1 3/4/[ADDRESS_221125] protected entry system that features security cameras, within the College of Nursing. Access to the research records, study database and PHI’s will be restricted to study personnel as approved by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_187212]. As with all studies conducted at MUSC, this study is also eligible for a random audit by [CONTACT_187266].  Data Processing. This study will use Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) for data capture and management. REDCap is a software toolset and workflow methodology for the electronic collection and management of research and clinical trials data. REDCap provides secure, web-based, flexible applications, including real-time validation rules with automated data type and range checks at the time of data entry. Exports are made available for several statistical packages including SPSS, SAS, SATA, R and Microsoft Excel. The study-specific REDCap electronic database will be designed and developed by [CONTACT_187280].  The provision of REDCap is made available through the South Carolina Clinical & Translational Research (SCTR) Institute at MUSC with NIH Grant awards UL1RR029882 and UL1TR000062.   Data Security. Ensuring data security, compliance with [ADDRESS_221126] Operating Procedures (SOP) to ensure a high level of data security while coordinating electronic and paper data management activities for clinical research trials. The REDCap study database will be hosted in the Biomedical Informatics secure data center at MUSC, a secure environment for data systems and servers on campus, and includes firewall, redundancy, failover capability, backups and extensive security checks. The secure data center has strict access control; only authorized core personnel may access the facility un-escorted. Only authorized users are allowed to connect to the network, and the security of the network is actively monitored.  Power and environmental controls have several layers of backups, from interruptible power supplies to alternate and redundant feeds to the local utility company. The REDCap system administrator contributes to the maintenance of institutional disaster recovery and business continuity plans.  Load balancers and a highly fault tolerant SAN infrastructure contribute to high availability.   The REDCap system itself has several additional layers of protection including password protection. Access to the data and its security is managed institutionally by [CONTACT_187267] a Shibboleth login with an MUSC issued NetID and features a user account management filter that controls who can access the data and to what degree. All personnel must pass an employment background check before being issued an ID. Password complexity, history and expi[INVESTIGATOR_187213]. Access to individual REDCap projects and their data is managed by [CONTACT_187268]. All transactions are securely delivered to the application using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL – SHA-1 with RSA Encryption; 2048-bits). It is then transmitted internally (behind the firewall) to the database server. All transactions are logged at the server layer (httpd logging), application layers (REDCap logs activity to a database table), and the database layer, using both query and binary logging. This feature provides audit trails for all changes, queries, data exports and reports. MUSC Information security policies are available at: https://mainweb-v.musc.edu/security/policy/   Data Entry. Only MUSC IRB approved study personnel that are authorized to have access to the REDCap study database will be granted password access. Study personnel using computers that are connected to the Internet will directly enter data into the remotely housed database. As such, no electronic study data will be stored on hard drives and/or any portable electronic devices. Additionally, all personnel with access to the database will have current University of Miami CITI training in the 
Version #7.1 3/4/[ADDRESS_221127] Protections, and their respective institution’s HIPAA and Information Security trainings that are completed annually. Each participant will be assigned a unique study identifier, all PHIs will be masked, and data exports will be limited to the PI, the PD and the BS for generating reports and the conduct of statistical data analysis.  Data Monitoring. Ongoing quality control procedures will be implemented for data collection, storage and processing. The PD will conduct monthly monitoring of the study database and generate a report for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_163633]. Standing agenda items for these meetings will include participant recruitment and retention, AE’s, protocol deviations, data integrity and overall study conduct. The PD will work to resolve and validate discrepant data. Discrepancies that warrant clarification will be sent to appropriate parties for review and resolution. All data entry and changes made in the study database by [CONTACT_187269], and provide a transparent visible audit trail for reviewers.  SECTION C.  Procedures for Identifying, Reviewing and Reporting Adverse Events 1) Identifying. Potential minimum risks identified for participants are outlined in the Protection of Human Participants and will also be outlined in the IRB-approved informed consent document. Additional unknown risks may occur and, if so, will be identified through diligent monitoring by [CONTACT_187281]. During the informed consent process, participants will be advised of the potential minimum risks of participation as identified in the IRB-approved informed consent document and reminded throughout the study that the researchers should be promptly informed about any concerns regarding potential side effects, adverse events, or clinical deterioration. Participants will also be instructed to immediately notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or designee of any suspected adverse events, if possible. Throughout the course of study, at each study contact, the researchers will elicit information about experienced AEs and monitor participant progress. The PD will maintain an electronic record of all reported adverse events and notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_187226]. The PD will generate and provide de-identified semi-annual administrative human participant safety reports for the SMC to review participant progress, accrual and attrition rates. Additionally, the BS will generate semi-annual safety reports for the SMC to provide for the monitoring of the frequency of all reported side effects and AEs. 2) Reviewing. Adverse events will be assessed and evaluated by [CONTACT_187282]’s IRB Adverse Event Reporting Policy http://academicdepartments.musc.edu/research/ori/irb/HRPP/HRPP%20Guide%20Section%204.7: ● Expected/Anticipated—Identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the current protocol,  informed consent, investigator brochure, or with other current risk information. ● Unexpected/Unanticipated—Not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the current  protocol, informed consent, investigator brochure, or with other current risk information. ● More Prevalent—Occurs more frequently than anticipated or at a higher prevalence  than expected. ● Serious—Results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_187227], results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  cancer, overdose, or causes a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  The relationship of adverse events to study participation will be determined by [CONTACT_187283]: ● Unrelated—There is not a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may have been  caused by [CONTACT_33641], device or intervention. 
Version #7.1 3/4/21 
 Page 28 of 34  ● Possibly Related—The adverse event may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641], device, or  intervention, however there is insufficient information to determine the likelihood of this  possibility. ● Related—There is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may have been  caused by [CONTACT_33641], device or intervention.  3) Reporting. All reportable AE, SAE and unanticipated problems experienced by [CONTACT_187272]/NINR and MUSC IRB in compliance with their Adverse Event Reporting Policy requirements, using the IRB's password protected on-line secure server adverse event reporting system. Within 24 hours after a reportable AE, SAE or unanticipated problem has been reported by [CONTACT_2299], it will be initially graded by [CONTACT_187284], forwarded to the study’s C for review and approval, and then will be submitted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_187218]. The Institutional Official(s) will review the event and discuss the report with the IRB Chair and the Director of the Office of Research Integrity. After IRB review and acknowledgement, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_187219], and the PD will forward a copy of the reportable AE, SAE or unanticipated problem and IRB acknowledgement letter to the NIH/NINR Program Officer through MUSC’s OSRP. The activities will be reported to the NIH/NINR within 72hrs. In addition, all cumulative reportable AE, SAE and unanticipated problems included in the ISM reports will be submitted to the NIH/NINR in the PI’s Annual Progress Reports.  4) Examples of Potential Reportable Adverse Events: In accordance with MUSC IRB Adverse Event Reporting Policy, an AE is reportable is it meets all of the following criteria: 1) is unexpected 2) is related and/or possibly related, and 3) is serious and/or suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of physical or psychological harm than was previously known or recognized. Additionally, per MUSC’s policy all participant deaths, protocol deviations, complaints about the research, and breaches of confidentiality are reportable events. From our previous work among this study population, an example of an AE would be feeling lightheaded or dizziness while or after performing the yoga breathing exercises. Depending on the severity, the possible steps to be taken include referral to a medical provider, resting in a prone position until the feeling subsides, and/or withdrawing the participant from the study. An example of an SAE would be the death of a participant from renal failure, which although would be viewed as unexpected and unrelated to the intervention is nonetheless a reportable serious event. No further steps would be taken except to review, grade and report the event to all applicable agencies. An example of an unanticipated problem would be the participant strains his or her neck while performing the yoga breathing. The steps in this case would be to withdraw the participant from the study and invite him or her to restart the study after the strain has resolved. These events and problems will be reported in accordance with the IRB and NIH/NINR policy as noted in Section C.3.  SECTION D. Multi-site Monitoring and Compliance This is not a multi-site study.  SECTION E. Assessment of External Factors The PI [INVESTIGATOR_48112] a semi-annual assessment of external factors through a review of literature related to new developments in the areas of yoga breathing among older populations, and other approaches that may have an impact on the safety of participants or on the ethics of the study. To determine whether any changes are necessitated to the study protocol, the SMC will review any identified literature or product safety data that may pose as a potential impact to the risk benefit ratio study and/or safety of study participants.    
Version #7.1 3/4/21 
 Page 29 of 34  SECTION F. Interim Analysis Based upon our prior research in this field among this same population and the minimal risk associated with the intervention, there are no stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_8441]. Accordingly, interim futility analysis will not be performed. However, the BS and PD will generate semi-annual qualitative interim analysis reports on a) adverse events; and b) data obtained during phone calls and returned end-of-study surveys to understand issues related to the uptake, usability, and adoption of the yoga breathing exercises among this population. We will also evaluate the screening and enrollment procedures, barriers to participation and retention, including, safety, adherence, acceptability, and feedback from the participants.   15.[ADDRESS_221128] research that gathers Protected Health Information (PHI). Participants will be made aware of these risks during the Informed Consent process. Identified study risks include: Physical discomfort, emotional distress, social wellbeing, Loss of privacy, and randomization.   Physical discomfort. Participants with pre-existing medical conditions that would make increase in physical activity dangerous to their health will be excluded from the study. There may be minor physical discomfort from the increase in physical activity; however, the potential risk to all subjects is minimal. The participants’ pain and fatigue scores will be assessed on a weekly basis by [CONTACT_978], who is a Board-Certified Family Nurse Practitioner, which will allow for further determination of any untoward effects of participation in the physical activity program. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_187228] a weekly basis to allow for further follow-up of any physical issues with the program.  Emotional distress. Participants will be asked to provide information about their self-reported pain and fatigue, social isolation, depression and demographic data. These questions pose an anticipated low psychological risk, e.g. for anxiety, if participants appear upset by [CONTACT_187285], they will be instructed that if they do not wish to answer a question, they can skip it and go to the next question.  Social well-being. There is low potential for adverse social effects in this research study. Through bi-weekly telehealth visits with nurses, participants will have social support during their participation.   Loss of privacy. PHI from participants will be gathered and stored electronically on secure and encrypted servers and there are risks associated for the loss of privacy and confidentiality. As well as having a comprehensive DSMP that details data safety, handling, monitoring, storage and security procedures, we will further minimize the potential for loss of confidentiality through the physical separation of participant names from their research record.  All participants will be screened for depression using the PROMIS Emotional Distress-Depression Short Form 8a. If a participant scores in the severe depression category (raw score 33 and above) a referral will be placed to a mental health professional which could result in loss of confidentiality. Additionally, participants that score in the moderate depression category (raw score 23 to 32) further screening for suicidal ideation will take place. If the participant would admit to suicidal ideation at any time during the study, an emergent mental health consult will be placed which could also lead to loss of confidentiality.  
Version #7.1 3/4/[ADDRESS_221129]-certified Family Nurse Practitioner and will be available as a resource by [CONTACT_187286]. This information (contact [CONTACT_187287]) is provided in writing to all subjects who choose to consent and enroll in the study.   16.[ADDRESS_221130] and immediate benefit to the participants from this research study. Participants in the study may accrue the benefit of improved mobility, strength and balance and along with the benefits of the yoga and behavioral activiation, more motivation to be physically active which could improve symptoms of chornic pain and/or fatigue. The benefit to others is that if this program is proven effective, other low-income older adults, might benefit as well from its future implementation.  18.[ADDRESS_221131]. All investigational supplies and materials are readily commercially available and are not industry regulated. All study supplies (tablets) will be inventoried and stored in a locked cabinet, behind a locked door by [CONTACT_41314]. Study supplies will be dispensed individually to each participants after enrollment and group assignment.  A&D Medical Premium Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor is an FDA approved, Bluetooth blood pressure cuff that will be utilized to collect participants blood pressure and pulse and transmit the data to the “Activate for Life” application. The “Activate for Life” app is an application that will be available on participants tablets. This app has the ability to receive Bluetooth data from the A&D wireless blood pressure monitor. The app will also allow participants to enter there pain and fatigue levels on a “1-10” scale, ask participants to input their PA and their use of pain medication for the day, and record thoughts on a voice recorded daily diary. This information will transmit from the application to a firewall protected server at MUSC where it will be available to the research team. No medical information will be stored on the app.

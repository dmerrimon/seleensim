This is a private document and the property of the Centre for Ocular Research & Education. It 
is therefore confidential to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_234979] D irector (or her/his

This study will be conducted for research purposes only.  
 
  
EX-MKTG -[ADDRESS_982469] lens (Biof inity Toric Multifocal) with a 
competitor lens (Ultra Multifocal for Astigmatism, Bausch & Lomb). Of particular interest is the 
comparison of handling the lens to insert onto the eye. A previous study  sponsored by 
[CONTACT_719998] -multifocal lenses of these lens brand families,  and showed that 
the Biofinity Toric lens was easier to insert than the Ultra for Astigmatism lens. Ease of handling 
a lens for insertion is arguably more critical in a presby[CONTACT_719999].  
3 OBJECTIVES  
The objective of the study is  to compare the handling and performance of Biofinity Toric 
Multifocal to Ultra Multifocal for Astigmatism.  
The prim ary outcome variable for this study is: 
1. Subjective at -home ratings of  ‘Lens handling for insertion’ , using a 0 -10 scale, collected 
on Day 28 .   
4 HYPOTHESIS  
The null hypothesis is that there will be no difference between  the subjective at-home ratings of 
‘Lens handling for insertion’, collected on day 28 for each lens type. 
5 MATERIALS AND METHODS  
5.1 STUDY DESIGN  
5.1.1 OVERALL DESIGN 
This is a prospective, randomized, participant  masked, crossover , bilateral dispensing study  
conducted at CORE and seven other clinical practice sites in Canada and the [LOCATION_003] . Each lens 
type will be worn for approximately one month. The lens prescription of each lens type will be 
optimized after 3 -7 days before the one month wear period.  
EX-MKTG -110 DINGO Protocol v1. 7 21dec2020  11 5.1.2 RANDOMIZATION  
A randomization schedule will be generated using a web- based program: 
(www.randomization.com ). The final study randomization schedule will be generated by [CONTACT_94648]’s  
Database Administrator  and provided to the research assistants at each site for the study.  
5.1.3 MASKING  
Participant s will be masked to the lens type they are wearing during the study. Foils will not be 
visible to participants when the lenses are removed from the blister packs and information 
specifying which lens is being worn will not be shared with the participant.  
It is not possible for the study investigators to be masked because of the need to follow the 
specific lens fitting guide during the lens prescript ion optimization visit (visits 1 -1 and 2 -1).  
5.2 STUDY POPULATION 
5.2.1 SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION  
The sample size was calculated using the end of month subjective ratings for ‘lens handling for insertion’ from a previous study .  
In order to detect a mean difference of 0.7 units on the 0 to 10 scale for the end of month ratings of ‘lens handling for insertion’, using a standard deviation of 1.7 with 80% power and alpha 0.[ADDRESS_982470] 49 completing the study.

Figure 1: Sample size calculation graph  
 
5.2.2 NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS  
Participants will be recruited using site records , databases  and advertising materials (eg. 
posters, email scripts) approved by [CONTACT_49751] r esearch ethics review board. All initial 
individual -targeted recruitment activities, such as any direct mailing of recruitment scripts, will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_234988]. This 
separation will reduce any undue influence of the optometrist -patient relationship. This process 
will also eliminate opportunity for the investigator to access personal health information before any consent for disclosure is provided by [CONTACT_52764].  
It is anticipated that up to 80 potential participants may attend a Screening visit and up to 60 participants may be randomized and dispensed with study products, with a target of 49 
completing the study. Informed consent will be obtained for all participants prior to their 
enrolment in the study (Appendix 1).

* For the purposes of this study, active ocular disease is defined as infection  or inflammation which 
requires therapeutic treatment. Mild (i.e. not considered clinically relevant) lid abnormalities  (blepharit is, 
meibomian gland dysfunction, papi[INVESTIGATOR_1257]), corneal and conjunctival staining and dry eye are not considered 
active ocular disease.  Neovascularization and corneal scars  are the result of previous hypoxia, infection or 
inflammation and are therefore not act ive.

EX-MKTG -110 DINGO Protocol v1. 7 21dec2020  19 5.4.2 REPEATED SCREENING VISITS 
In some circumstances a repeated screening may need to be scheduled. Examples include, but 
are not limited to:  
1. Incomplete information available at time of screening to determine eligibility (e.g. current lens brands worn, history from current eye care practitioner etc.)  
2. Study procedures unable to be completed in time scheduled for visit;  
3. Study products not available at the time of the screening visit;  
4. A transient health condition which may affect the eye(s) (e.g. a common cold, active allergies, fatig ue etc. ) 
5. The short term use of medications (e.g. antibiotics, antihistamines etc.) 
6. Reassessment of baseline ocular conditions (e.g. corneal and/or conjunctival staining, scars etc.)  
The maximum total number of screenings permitted will be 3, the initial and two repeat screening visits.  
5.4.3 VISIT 0 -1, LENS FITTING  
This visit may or may not be subsequent to the screening visit, depending on lens availability.

weeks time or wait until lenses arrive on site.  
5.4.4 REPEATED LENS FITTING VISITS  
Because it is not possible to provide each site with a complete fitting set of all available power combinations, multiple lens power combinations will be ordered to maximize the likelihood of a successful lens fit at visit 0 -1. However if this initial lens  fitting is unsuccessful and further lens 
powers are required, they will be ordered and a repeated visit, visit V0- 1/R1, will be scheduled. 
There is no limit to the number of repeated visits allowed within the protocol.  They will be 
numbered successively eg. V0 -1/R1, then V0- 1/R2, then V0- 1/R3 etc.

5.4.10  VISIT  2-2, 1 MONTH FOLLOW -UP PAIR #2  
This visit will occur on day 29- 31 (inclusive) after the pair #[ADDRESS_982478] to determine how many lenses were needed to achieve the final 
lens prescription at V0- 1 and at each optimization visit (V1- 1 and V2 -1).  
For both lens ty pes, the multifocal contact [CONTACT_720002]. Lenses will be ordered through CORE, see section 5.3 for details. If 
necessary , the same brand of ‘non- multifocal’ toric lens (ie. Biofinity Toric or Ultra  for 
Astigmatism) may be used to determine the orientation and possibly the sphere and cylinder 
powers  required for the respective brand of multifocal contact [CONTACT_13293] . These toric lenses will not be 
recorded in lens accountability logs but their prescription,  expi[INVESTIGATOR_719996]# details will be 
recorded on the study data collection forms. 
This protocol allows for an unrestricted number of lens fitting visits and they will be numbered as 
follows:  
• V0-1 (first fitting visit)  
• V0-1/R1 (first repeated fitting visit)  
• V0-1/R2 (second repeated fitting visit)  
• V0-1/R3 (third repeated fitting visit)  
• Etc.  
No lenses will be dispensed until the final prescriptions for each lenses have been determined 
during a fitting visit.

wearing of contact [CONTACT_479600], dryness, aching or itching eyes, excessive tearing, 
discharge, hyperemia and variable or blurred vision. More serious risks may include photophobia, iritis, corneal edema or eye infection. Although contact [CONTACT_13293] -related infections are 
very infrequent, the possibility does exist. The incidence of infection due to daily -wear soft 
lenses is 0.035%. Almost always an infection will occur only in one eye. Thirty five million Amer icans who currently wear contact [CONTACT_720003].  
When contact [CONTACT_512389] a daily wear basis there is a small risk of an adverse event compared to not wearing contact [CONTACT_13276]. When contact [CONTACT_720004], there is a significantly increased risk of an adverse reaction compared with wearing 
contact [CONTACT_35491] a daily wear basis . 
A dye (fluorescein) normally used for eye examinations is being used in this study. Although rare, it is possible to have an allergic reaction to the dye. Participants will be asked if they  have  a 
known allergy or sensitivity to fluorescein. 
Participants  will be provided with OptiFree PureMoist to care for the study contact [CONTACT_13276].

9 DISCONTINUATION FROM THE STUDY  
Participants may be discontinued at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor in consideration 
of participant safety or protocol compliance, or at discretion of the par ticipant.  Participants 
discontinued from a study will be reimbursed for their active involvement in the study (including the initial screening visit  and all lens fitting visits ).  Upon discontinuing, a participant will be 
offered the option of their data being withdrawn from future statistical analysis. The following is a list of possible reasons for discontinuation from the study: 
• Screening failure: Participants will be discontinued if  they do not meet the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria outlined in section 5.2.3. 
• Unacceptable performance with products to be used in study: Participants may be discontinued if they are unable to achieve acceptable comfort and /or vision with the study products.  
• Positive slit lamp finding:  Participants may be permanently discontinued from the study 
depending on the severity of the condition and on the judgement of the investigator.   

EX-MKTG -110 DINGO Protocol v1. 7 21dec2020  33 • Adverse event: If a participant experiences an adverse event during the study they may 
be discontinued based on the clinical judgement of the investigator.  
• Symptoms : If the participant has persistent symptoms they may be discontinued based 
on the clinical judgement of the investigator.  
• Disinterest, relocation or illness: The participant may choose to discontinue due to 
reasons within or beyond their control.  
• Violation of protocol or non- compliance:  The participant will be discontinued if they are 
unable or unwilling to follow the protocol specified visit schedules  and/or study 
procedures . 
• Instillation of topi[INVESTIGATOR_94625]:  The participant will be discontinued if they elect to use a topi[INVESTIGATOR_234982] a limited duration (less than two weeks)  to treat a transient condition; in 
this case  the participant may remain an active participant (at the discretion of the 
investigator) after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_234983]).  
• Lost to follow -up:  The participant will be discontinued if they cannot be contact[CONTACT_720009] a final exit visit, and if the investigator has made a reasonable effort to contact [CONTACT_94656] a final study visit.  
• Premature termination of the study by [CONTACT_456], CORE  or a research ethics review 
board. 
A discontinuation form , stating the reason for discontinuation will be completed, which requires

feedback following study completion in the Let ter of Appreciation. 
Participant remuneration will be  provided at the end of their study involvement. 
12 S TATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND DATA MANAGEMENT  
12.1 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
All data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_94657].  Unmasked data analysis will 
be conducted using Statistica 10, Statsoft or other suitable software.  Descriptive statistics will 
be provided on demographic data (age, gender, refractive error distribution, etc.).  Table [ADDRESS_982485] will be used to analyze the results for the count data of subjective 
preferences and experience responses. Where relevant, the number of “neither agree or disagree” responses will be evenly distributed to the two options on the basis they would be equally likely to choose either.  
EX-MKTG -[ADDRESS_982486] been recorded in the source documents. Only relevant and applicable comments will be included in the final report as 
deemed necessary by [CONTACT_94648]’s L ead I nvestigator.  
13 PROTOCOL & OTHER TRAINING  
All study personnel will be required to complete training prior to their involvement in the study. 
Records of training will be kept at CORE . This will include training by [CONTACT_94660] , study procedures, informed consent procedures, and on the randomization and 
participant masking procedures , as well as training for Good Clinical Practice.   
All site Principal Investigators and co-investigators will provide a scan of their license to practice 
optometry and evidence of professional indemnity insurance.  
14 STUDY MONIT ORING 
Each site will provide regular  status reports to CORE . Status r eports will include:  
• The number of participants screened, enrolled, and randomized (i.e. assigned a study ID number), discontinued and completed.  
• Details of all protocol deviations, adverse events, device malfunctions . 
• Reports of unintended events.  
CORE will collate the site updates and provide 2 -weekly status reports to the study sponsor.  
Study monitoring visits may be conducted by [CONTACT_456] , or sponsor’s designate,  throughout 
the study and will be scheduled in conjunction with the Princip al Investigator at each site . In 
addition study records may be inspected by [CONTACT_456], the sponsor's designate, the relevant 
research ethics review board, and by [CONTACT_234993], 
namely Health Canada and the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA); however, they will not be permitted to take away any records containing identifiable personal information.  
Study data review and data monit oring will be conducted by [CONTACT_94662]. To improve data 
integrity, data entry will be conducted by [CONTACT_512392]. Data 
EX-MKTG -110 DINGO Protocol v1. 7 21dec2020  37 queries will be reported to the site within 5 working days of receipt of initial data. A response 
resolv ing the query will be expected from the site within 5 working days of receipt of the query.  
All adverse events and protocol deviations will be reviewed by [CONTACT_94664]  [INVESTIGATOR_94628] . All serious adverse events and major protocol deviations will be reviewed by [CONTACT_720010]’s  Head of Clinical Research and/ or CORE’s Principal 
Investigator .

Board (IRB) for all other clinical study sites. Notification of ethics clearance of the application is 
required prior to the commencement of the study  the respective provinces and sites . 
15.[ADDRESS_982487] the research protocol, information consent document or 
other study materials, usually cannot be anticipated ahead of time and are often necessary to ensure the saf ety and welfare of the participants.  
The following are examples of major protocol deviations that require reporting to research ethics 
review boards: : 
• Changes in procedures initiated to eliminate immediate risks/hazards to participants;  
• Enrollment of participants outside the protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria whether agreed 
to or not by [CONTACT_456];  
• Medication / device / intervention errors (i.e. incorrect drug or dosage of drug / incorrect 
contact [CONTACT_13293](es) dispensed / incorrect care system dispensed); 
• Inadvertent deviation in specific research intervention procedures or timing of the 
research intervention which could impact upon the safety or efficacy of the study -related 
intervention or upon the experimental design;  
• Information consent documentation violations: no documentation of informed consent; incorrect version of, or incomplete, informed consent documentation used.  
15.4.[ADDRESS_982488]  unless these result in 
increased risk to the participant (s). The following are examples of protocol deviations that are 
considered minor and do not require reporting to the research ethics review board: : 
• Logistical or administrative aspects of the study (e.g., study participant missed 
appointment, change in appointment date) ; 
• Inadvertent deviation in specific research intervention procedures or timing of the 
research intervention which would not impact upon the safety or efficacy of the study -
related intervention or upon the experimental design (i.e., missing a measurement during a session that is  not considered critical for the study).

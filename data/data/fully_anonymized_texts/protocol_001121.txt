available donor source phase II clinical trial. 
2.0 BACKGROUND AND HYPOT HESIS  
2.1 Autism Spectrum Disorder  
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder with 
onset early in life.  It is characterized by [CONTACT_290123] , a restricted range of 
activities , and  impairments in social communication.[ADDRESS_765654] of supporting an individual with ASD is 
estimated to be $1.[ADDRESS_765655] is $2.[ADDRESS_765656] also been reported, potentially im plicating irregularities in 
myelination or axonal development in the pathophysiology of ASD.4  In addition, 
abnormal functioning in aspects of the immune system in the brain (such as microglia 
that are tasked with providing support to neuronal  synapses) ha s been described .5,[ADDRESS_765657] been 
associated with ASD.7  In this study , we hypothesize  that infus ion of CB will facilitate 
neural cell protection/repair and reduce inflammation resulting in improvement in 
the core autistic symptoms of children  with ASD.    
 
Although the etiology of ASD is likely to be multifactorial, and the phenotypes can be 
variable, symptoms may be mediated by a final common pathway involving microglial 
activation.  Nonetheless, it is possible that risk -based analyses performed at the 
conc lusion of this study may uncover differential treatment responses in subsets of 
 
March 15, 2018  10 subjects.  Future studies utilizing induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSC) may be useful in 
further investigating any such findings.    
2.[ADDRESS_765658] blood (CB) is rich in highly proliferative stem and progenitor cells 
mobilized by [CONTACT_582213][INVESTIGATOR_582181].  We have previously  
shown that allogeneic unrelated donor umbilical cord blood transplantation , after 
preparation with high dose, myeloablative chemotherapy, can halt progression of disease 
in children with inherited leukodystrophies.8-[ADDRESS_765659] also been reported in two 
different mouse models of ASD after administration of bone marrow cells or 
mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs).  We hypothesize that  cell therapy utilizing CB may 
improve the symptoms of ASD by [CONTACT_582214]/or initiating repair of damaged brain circuitry.  
2.[ADDRESS_765660] been developed to provide a method to identify candidate 
genes and chromosomal regi ons associated with limited sub populations of ASD  such as 
Fragile X, Rett, and Angelman syndrome s.  Reported data from animal studies is 
confounded by [CONTACT_582215].   
 
Derecki, et al13 report recovery of function in a model of Rett syndrome, an X -linked 
autism spectrum disorder usually caused by a mutation of the MECP2  gene.  This gene 
encodes a methyl -CpG -binding protein, and the mutation leads to deficient phagoc ytic 
function in glial cells.  Transplantation of cells from wild type bone marrow via 
intravenous infusion arrested disease development in the mouse model of Rett syndrome  
(Mecp2 -null C57BL/6 mice) .  Following engraftment, survival was improved, breathing  
patterns normalized, apneas were reduced, body weight increased, and locomotor activity 
was improved.  
 
The BTBR T+ Itpr3tfI (BTBR) mouse strain, derived from the inbred Black and Tan 
BRachyury strain, is another  mouse model of ASD.   BTBR mice exhibit impaired social 
behavior, aberrant communication, increased repetitive behaviors, and increased 
cognitive rigidity.  Segal -Gavish , et al14 delivered human MSCs to BTBR mice via 
intraventricular injection into the central nervous system.  Mice were immunosuppressed 
with cyclosporine  before and after treatment .  In this model, improvements in all three 
domains – social behavior, stereotyped behaviors, and cognitive rigidity – were observed 
in MSC -treated mice compared to controls.  Differences in anxiety -related behaviors and 
locomotion were not observed.  
 
These  mous e model s demonstrate  the potential for benefit from cellular therapi[INVESTIGATOR_582182] .     
 
March 15, 2018  11 2.4 Preclinical Studies Demonstra ting Mechanism of Action of CB C ells to 
Rescue/Repair Brain Cells  
A common pathophysiological finding in ASD is  abnormal synaptic functioning in the 
brain. Development and maintenance of neural synapses is a complex and continual 
process that begins early in development and continues throughout life.  While synapses 
were once thought simply  to be connections betwee n neurons, it is now recognized that 
many different cell types, including astrocytes and microglia, play an integral role in 
synaptic pruning and maintenance.  Microglia, in particular, play critical but incompletely 
understood roles in propagation and res olution  of central nervous system  injuries. These 
cells modulate neuroinflammation, produce factors that regulate activities of astrocytes, 
oligodendrocytes, and neurons, aid in maintenance of synapses, and clear debris to 
provide an environment for oligod endrocytes to begin to remyelinate neurons.15,[ADDRESS_765661] numerous cell 
types in the central nervous system via trophic or paracrine effects, thereby [CONTACT_582216].    Selec ted examples are 
detailed below.  
Neurogenesis  and Microglial Modulation :   
Microglia are thought  to regulate changes in hippocampal neurogenesis through the 
production of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF -α) and 
interleukin -[ADDRESS_765662] or (BDNF) .17-[ADDRESS_765663] been shown to increase the prolifera tion of 
neural stem cells  and decrease the number of activat ed microglia  in the dentate gyrus  of 
the hippoc ampus and the subgranular zone .21 
 
More  recently, Shahaduzzaman, et al22 demonstrated that CB -derived T cells increase 
survival and proliferation of adult neural ste m cells in vitro. In a mouse model, they 
showed that CB CD4+ T cells promoted proliferation of neural stem cells in the dentate 
gyrus of aging rats and restored dendritic spi[INVESTIGATOR_582183] -injection. Longer term, th ey demonstrated that a single IV injec tion of CB 
CD4+ T cells increased  proliferat ion in the  dentate gyrus  and decreased  the amount of 
activated microglia in the aged rat brai n. These results suggest that CB T cells may 
provide trophic support to aging neurons , thereby [CONTACT_582217].  
 
Microglial Inflammation:  
In a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease, Lee et al. demonstrated that infusion of CB -
MSCs resulted in reversal of diseas e-associated microglial neuroinflammation, as 
evidenced by [CONTACT_582218] -induced proinflammatory cytokines, elevated 
alternatively activated microglia, and increased anti -inflammatory cytokines.  This was 
associated with reductions in amyloid -β pepti de deposition, β -secretase 1 levels, and tau 
hyperphosphorylation, known biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease.  The mice also 
demonstrated improved spatial learning and memory decline.  The authors suggest that

Oligodend rocytes & Myelination:  
Our group has developed DUOC -01, a cell therapy product cultured from banked h uman 
CB mononuclear cells .24  Immunodepletion and selection studies demonstrate that 
DUOC -01 cells are derived from CB CD14+ monocytes. In a NOD/SCID/IL2R
null 
mouse model of demyelination via cuprizone feeding , the corpus callosum of mice 
treated with DUOC -01 showed enhanced myelination  (figure 1) , a higher proportion of 
fully myelinated axons, decreased gliosis and cellular infiltration  (figure 2) , and more 
proliferating oligodendrocyte lineage cells than controls .[ADDRESS_765665]

March 15, [ADDRESS_765666] 11 years in over 
600 children, ages one day to 15 years, with cerebral palsy (CP), hypoxic ischemic 
encephalo pathy (HIE), hypopl astic left heart syndrome  post ECMO , congenital 
hydrocephalus, ASD, and other brain injuries.  No safety concerns were raised in this 
experience, which is detailed below.  
 
 
Safety :  
The first trial,  conducted from 2004 -2009, confirmed the safety of administration of 
autologous  CB as an intravenous infusion in the outpatient setting.11  In this study , 184 
infants and children with HIE, cerebral palsy, congenital hydrocephalus and other brain 
injuries received a total of 198 autologous CB infusions (14 patients received two 
infusions based on availability of larger cell doses).   The majority of parents had elected 
to store their child’s cord blood privately when they were born.  Autologous  CB unit s 
were obtained from [ADDRESS_765667] bloo d banks:  149 (81%) CB unit s came from 11 
private U.S. banks (113 from two of the larger private U.S. banks), 13 (7%) CBUs from 
11 inter national banks, and 22 (12%) CB unit s from [ADDRESS_765668] blood collected was 60 ml (range 5 -180 ml) and median total nucleated cell count 
(TNC C) contained in the cord blood, as reported by [CONTACT_582224], was 4.7x108 (range 0.3 -33.8x108) total nucleated cells and 1.8 x106 
(range 0 -19.1 x106) CD34 cells.  All i nfusions were administered through a peripheral IV 
after premedication with oral Tylenol 15mg/kg, IV Benadryl 0.5mg/kg and IV 
Solumedrol 0.5mg/kg.  Median post thaw recovery of TNC C was 82% (range 13 -200%), 
and patients were dosed with a median of 2.0x107 TNC/kg (range 0.1 -13.3x107), 0.7x105 
CD34+ cells/kg (range 0.04 -6.4x105), and 6.5x104 CFU/kg (range 0 -315x104).   
 
Three patients (1.5%) experienced anaphylactic reactions during their CB infusion 
characterized by [CONTACT_582225] 2-10 minutes after the IV infusion 
was initiated.  The reactions resolved after discontinuation of the infusion and treatment 
with additional IV Benadryl and bronchodilators.  The remainders of the CB cells were  
discarded for two of the infusions stopped prior  to completion; one patient was able to 
restart and complete the CB infusion.  One patient’s mother experienced an allergic 
reaction consisting of urticaria, presumably due to contact [CONTACT_129415] a CB inf usion.  The reaction resolved with oral 
Benadryl .  With up to 11 years of follow -up, n o infections, autoimmune diseases, tumors, 
or other adverse events were  observed.11,26 -28  This series demonstrated safety and 
feasibility of autologous CB infusion, and anecdotal reports of improved function we re 
common.  
 
Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) :   
 
March 15, 2018  15 In phase I trial of newborns with HIE at birt h conducted at Duke, fresh, non -
cryopreserved autologous  CB processed to reduce volume and RBC content on a Sepax 1 
bioprocessor (Biosafe, Geneva) was infused in 1, 2, or [ADDRESS_765669] 72 hours of 
life in babies with moderate -to-severe encephalopathy qualifying for therapeutic  
hypothermia.29 These babies (n=39) were compared to a concomitant group of babies 
who were also cooled at Duke but did not receive CB cells (n=146).  CB i nfusions were 
found to be safe in these critically ill babies, and babies receiving cells had increased 
survival rates to discharge (100% vs. 89%, p=0.03).  Of the 25 CB recipi[INVESTIGATOR_582184]-year outcomes, 16 (64%) survived with Bayley III scores ≥ 85 in all three domains, 
and of the 63 cooled -only infants with known one year outcomes, 25 (40%) survived with 
Bayley III scores ≥ 85 in all three domains (p = 0.04).  A phase II randomized, placebo 
controlled, multicenter trial has recently been activated to formally test the efficacy of 
autologous  CB infusion in these babies.    
Cerebral Palsy:    
The CP -AC study was a phase II, prospective, randomized, double blind, place bo 
controlled crossover study testing the efficacy of  a single IV infusion of autologous  CB 
in children ages 1 -6 years with cerebral palsy  (IND # [ZIP_CODE] ).  A total of 63 children with 
a median baseline age of 2 years (range 1 -6) were enrolled and treated from 2010 -2015 
(32 CB, 31 placebo). Children were eligible if they were (1) Gross Motor Function 
Classification System (GMFCS) level 2 -4 or (2) GMFCS level [ADDRESS_765670] only. Children with known genetic condi tions, 
intractable seizures, or severe microcephaly were ineligible.  Autologous CB units were 
eligible if they had a precyropreservation TNCC  of ≥1x107/kg, negative sterility tests, 
and negative maternal infectious disease tests. Subjects were evaluated at baseline, one 
year, and two years with functional evaluations (GMFM -66, Peabody, Assisting Hand 
Assessment, Bayley) and brain MRI with DTI  tractography and connectivity analyses . 
They were randomized to the order of CB and placebo infusions (given one y ear apart). 
The placebo consisted of TC -199 tissue culture medium with 1% DMSO . The primary 
endpoint was change in GMFM -66 score at one year after the initial infusion (CB dosed 
at 1-5x107 cells/kg  or placebo). Cells or placebo were administered IV over [ADDRESS_765671] -infusion.  
 
The median TNCC of CB infused  in this study was 2x107/kg (range 0.8 –4.8) and media n 
infused CD34 dose 0.7x105/kg (range 0.1 –4). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_582185] -cryopreservation 
cultures, one CB unit grew β-hemolytic strep  upon  thaw. There were no clinical 
infections , and no patients were treated with antibiotics . One participant  had a transient 
infusion reaction with urticaria and fever, which resolved.  
 
Analysis of the 63 patients at one year showed no difference in GMFM -66 change scores 
between placebo and treated groups (6.9 vs. 7.5, p=0.72). However, treated subjects with 
cell doses above or b elow the median precryopreservation or infused doses of 3x107/kg 
and 1.98x107/kg, respectively, demonstrated improvement in GMFM -66 change scores 
compared to subjects who received lower cell doses (p<0.01 for precryopreservation 
dose, p=0.05 for infused dose, Figure 2).  Infused cell dose was not correlated with age 
(p=0.43) or type ( p=0.32) or severity (p=0.46) of CP.  Although the primary endpoint of 
 
March 15, [ADDRESS_765672] 
infusion, the observ ation that children receiving higher cell doses had a change in motor 
function, is important and influenced the minimum cell dose for this study (see section 
6.4). The choice of this cell dose threshold is further supported by [CONTACT_582226].  
 
Using a subject’s baseline GMFM -66 score, GMFCS level, age, and published 
percentiles,30 we calculated the expected one -year GMFM -66 raw score for each patient. 
Since such percentile values are only available for children ≥2 years old, one -year old 
subjects (n=25) were excluded from this analysis. In the evaluable patients (n=38 ), the 
difference between the actual one -year GMFM -66 score and the expected one -year 
GMFM -66 score was calculated. In the entire autologous CB group , the median actual -
expected difference in GMFM -66 scores was 1.7 (range -6.1-14.5), versus 2.2 (range -
6.2-12.6) in the placebo group. When the CB group was analyzed by [CONTACT_582227], 
subjects who received above the median infused dose of 1.98x107/kg (n=9)  improved a 
median 4.3 (range -1.7 to 14.5) points greater than expected (p=0.05 vs placebo),  whereas 
subjects who received below the median infused dose improved a median 1.9  points less 
than expected ( range -6.1 to 12.9; p=0.02 vs high dose,  p=0.07 vs placebo) .   Figure 3:  GMFM -66 Scores by [CONTACT_582228] A:  Distribution of GMFM -[ADDRESS_765673] the group means (circles)

N=16). Panel C: Raw GMFM -66 change scores based on median cell doses (Precryopreservation doses: Low, <3x107/kg, N=16

Forty -eight patients were also eligible for analysis of the Peabody Developmental Motor 
Scales -2 (PDMS -2), which assesses motor skills in children from birth through age 5. 
The median one -year change from baseline in the Gross Motor Quotient was 0.0 in the 
autologous CB group and -1.0 in the placebo group (p=0.38). When the subjects treated 
with autologous CB were analyzed by [CONTACT_582227] (>/< 1.98x107/kg), a significant 
change was detected in the Gross Motor Quotient (3.0 vs. -2.0, p= 0.02).  
 
MRI data was also analyzed to explore relationships between change in GMFM -[ADDRESS_765674] of subjects due to substantial 
morphologic brain abnormalities, leaving 23 treated patients and 15 placebo patients with 
usable connectivity data.  However, the images from 2 of 4 patients ≥3 years who 
received high cell doses were unusable. There were no statistically significant differences 
in CP type, GMFCS level, or age between patients with and without analyzable images. 
As previously described ,31 there was a moderate correlation between change in GMFM -
66 score and total connectivity at one -year in all analyzable subjects (n=38, Spearman 
r=0.53; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.73; p<0.001). Total connectivity change was not related to 
baseline GMFCS level, typogr aphy of CP, or gender, but was inversely correlated with 
age (Spearman r= -0.52; 95% CI: -0.72, -0.23; p=0.001).  Though not statistically 
significant, there was a trend of increasing normalized connectivity at higher doses in the 
high-dose group, but no such relationship in the low -dose group.   
 
The CP -AC was limited by [CONTACT_582229], as cell dose was not a 
pre-specified analysis.  In addition to confirming safety of autologous CB infusion, the

 Autism Spectrum Disorder  (ASD):  
Duke investigators recently completed an open -label Phase 1 safety and tolerability study 
in 25 children (ages 2 -5 mean  age 4.5 years), diagnosed with ASD who were treated with 
a single intravenous infusion of autologous  CB and followed for a year  
(ClinicalTrials.gov ID: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . CB was administered as a single infusion 
(median infused dose: 2.6x107/kg, range: 1.0x107/kg to 8.1 x107/kg). No 
immunosuppression was implemented prior to infusion.  
 
The safety and tolerability profile of autologous CB infusion in ASD was excellent. No 
serious adverse events were reported, and adverse events, in general, were sparse. Three 
children had mil d allergic reactions associated temporally with the infusions, consisting 
of cough and hives during infusion for [ADDRESS_765676] to preliminary assessments of efficacy, improvements in social 
communication abilities were noted on the caregiver -completed Vineland Adaptive 
Behavior Scales -Second Edition (VABS -II) and on the Pe rvasive Developmental 
Disorder -Behavior Inventory (PDD -BI) (figure 4) . The Clinical Global Impression -
Improvement scale, completed by [CONTACT_15098], reflected beneficial changes during the [ADDRESS_765677] -infusion in core ASD symptoms in app roximately 60% of the 
participants, as manifested by [CONTACT_3038]’ increased social communication skills, 
receptive/expressive language, decreased repetitive behavior, and decreased sensory 
sensitivities.  In computerized eye -tracking assessments, the participants manifested 
improvements in social attention, while their improvements in social behavior were found 
to be associated with increases in connectivity across brain regions when assessed via 
diffusion tensor imaging (obtained via MRI scans). This data suggests that a larger Phase 
[ADDRESS_765678] begun investigating its use in children and adults with brain injury.

Allogeneic CB for Hematopoietic Reconstitution:    
Allogeneic h uman CB as a source of cells for hematopoietic reconstitution after 
myeloablative therapy  has a proven track record of over 25 years of use in the clinic, 
with over 35,000 transplants performed.32  Allogeneic CB transplantation has been shown 
to be safe  and has not been shown to cause tumors or cellular dysregulation.   Compared 
to other cell sources, CB has the following advantages:  
1. CB is an abundantly available source  of stem cells that can be harvested at no risk to 
the mother or infant.  It is routinely collected, cryopreserved, and banked.  
2. Public CB donors are screened for risks of transmitting infectious agents through 
blood per CFR1271, subpart C donor screeni ng regulations.  Important infectious 
agents, particularly cytomegalovirus ( CMV ), are much less common in the newborn 
than adults, and are less likely to contaminate CB units.  
3. CB units, cryopreserved and banked, are available on demand, and can be easily 
shipped and thawed for use when needed, eliminating delays and uncertainties that 
complicate bone marrow collection from unrelated donors.  Time Point  Median  Mean  SD  Time Point  Median  Mean  SD

5. CB contains pluripotent stem cells that have demonstrated the ability to differentiate 
into numerous types of cells throughout the body,  including in the brain.  Thus CB  
may pro vide a source of cells for non -hematopoietic tissue repair or regeneration.  
6.   A minimum pre cryopreserved cell dose of [ADDRESS_765680] access to autologous CB, allogeneic cells are 
frequently utilized in clinical trials of cellular therapi[INVESTIGATOR_129365].  
Examples of allogeneic CB studies in human patients are described below.  
 
Stroke :  
The CoBIS study is an IRB approved, FDA IND sponsored, prospective, open -label, 
multi -center, Phase 1 safety study of a single intravenous infusion of  non-HLA matched, 
ABO matched,  allogeneic  CB in 10 adults ages 18 -80 years old.  CB units are selected by 
[CONTACT_124940], blood type, and  ability to supply a dose of 0.5 – 1.5 x 107 TNCC/kg.  Eligible 
patients include those experiencing a recent, acute cortical, hemispheric, ischemic stroke 
in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) distribution as detected by [CONTACT_129424] a  diffusion 
weighted abnormali ty and are enrolled if their National Institutes o f Health Stroke Scale 
(NIHSS) i s 8-15 (right hemisphere) or 8 -18 (left hemisphere).  Participant s who receive 
tPA or undergo mechanical perfusion are eligible for inclusion. Participant s are not pre -
treated with immunosuppressive drugs. The primary endpoint is safety as assessed by [CONTACT_582230] [ADDRESS_765681] CB infusion.  Secondary outcome measures includ e Modified 
Rankin Scale (mRS), NIHSS, the Barthel Index (BI), and European Quality of Life (EQ -
5D-3L), Patient Health Questionnaire Scale (PHQ8), Telephone Interview for Cognitive 
Status (TICS), and a self -reporting survey of rehabilitation therapy.  MRI w ill be used to 
evaluate changes in the brain [ADDRESS_765682] infusion.  
  
 
March 15, 2018  21 To date ( March  2016 ), all [ADDRESS_765683] been  no serious adverse events  with a follow -up of 1 -8 months .  Thus, e arly 
safety data suggests intravenous infusion of unmatched, allogeneic , CB cells is well 
tolerated.  If the safety profile remains favorable, we will move to a randomized, placebo 
controll ed Phase 2 study  with the goal of using  unrelated non -HLA matched CB to do wn-
regulate inflammation and promote neuroprotection and neurorepair in patients with 
ischemic stroke.    
 
Cerebral Palsy  at Duke :   
Given the benefit in motor improvement observed in the CP -AC study utilizing 
autologous CB, and recognizing that most children do not have a suitably qualified 
autologous CB unit available, we recently initiated a phase I clinical trial to evaluate the 
safety of fully HLA -matched or haploidentical allogeneic  sibling CB infusion in children 
with CP  (ClinicalTrials.gov ID [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) .  As of April 2016, [ADDRESS_765684] been no acute infusion -related toxicities, and no significant a dverse 
events with short follow -up. 
 
Cerebral Palsy in Other Countries :   
Studies of allogeneic CB infusion in children with CP have also been conducted in Korea 
(n=105) and Russia (n=80).  The Korean study had three groups:  allogeneic CB + 
cyclosporine +  erythropoietin; erythropoietin alone; and a control group.33  One severely 
affected patient died in her sleep 14 weeks after CB administration, and this was 
determined to be unrelated to the CB infusion.  Eight other patients experienced serious 
adverse events requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (pneumonia –4, seizure –1, influenza –2, urinary 
tract infection –1), but the distribution did not differ between groups.  Non -serious 
adverse events that were more common in the CB group we re pneumonia and irritability.  
At one year of follow -up, there were no reported prolonged or delayed serious adverse 
events.  The authors reported greater improvements in cognitive and select motor 
functions in children who received CB and erythropoietin versus controls.  There was no 
CB-only group for comparison.  In the Russian study, children  ages [ADDRESS_765685] patients who received four or more infusions 
showed im provement in tone, motor, and/or cognitive function, but there was no control 
group for comparison.  In their series, factors that impacted treatment response included 
age, severity of brain damage, and number of CB infusions , with more responses 
observed in younger, less severely impaired children and those who received more than 
two infusions . 
 
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in Other Countries:  
In China, 37 autistic children, ages 3 -12 years, were enrolled in a study utilizing 
allogeneic CB mononuclear cells (CBMNC) and/or umbilical cord -derived mesenchymal 
stem cells (UCMSC).35  The children were divided into three groups:  CBMNC (n=14), 
CBMNC+UCMSC (n=9), and control (n=14).  All children received standard 
rehabilitation therapy.  Cells were given in four doses, 5 -7 days apart, via intravenous 
and/or intrathecal administration.  In the cell recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], transient fever (5/23) was the 
 
March 15, 2018  22 only reported adverse event related to the therapy.   Compared to control patients at six 
months, they observed g reater improvements in the Childhood Autism Rating Scale 
(CARS) in the CBMNC+UCMSC group and in the Clinical Global Impression scale 
(CGI) in both cell groups.  This was a small, non -randomized study designed primarily to 
assess safety.  Nonetheless, the f unctional data suggests the potential for benefit.

Our experience in over 600 pediatric patients with brain injuries includi ng Cerebral 
Palsy, HIE, ASD, and other injuries infused intravenously with autologous CB 
demonstrates that the procedure is safe and well -tolerated in children with neurological 
conditions and supports further testing in the pediatric ASD population.   In addition, 
infusions in immunocompetent patients with brain injuries (adults with stroke and 
children with cerebral palsy), although smaller in number, also demonstrate a favorable 
safety profile and support further studies of allogeneic CB to treat childre n with ASD.  
Furthermore, infusions of allogeneic CB after myeloablative therapy in >35,[ADDRESS_765691] the donor cells and, accordingly, will not be at risk for 
GvHD.  
2.11 Study Rationale and Hypotheses  
The major objective of this study is to determine whether  a single intravenous infusion of 
CB can improve  the core symptoms of autism in children with ASD.   The rationale for 
the study and for the potential benefit of CB is based upon the following hypotheses:  
 The developi[INVESTIGATOR_129376], making young children ideal 
candidates for deriving maximal benefit from the pluripotential properties of CB.   
 Cellular therapy , acting through paracrine or trophic mechanisms,  may repair or 
facilitate improvement in areas of the brain with aberrant functioning by [CONTACT_582232].  
 Cellular therapy  may modify immune response and inflammation that may be 
linked to improvements in the core symptomatology of ASD, including in area s 
such as social communication.  
 
March 15, 2018  24  Intravenous administration of allogeneic cord blood cells to immunocompetent 
hosts should be safe and effective.  It is expected that the cells will be 
immunologically rejected within days to weeks of administration, elimina ting a 
risk of Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  or aberrant cell proliferation post -
infusion . 
 
The mechanistic rationale for this clinical stud y hypothesizes that CB can act through 
paracrine and allocrine mechanisms to modulate on -going inflammation and/or immune 
pathology  in the brain  and possibly protect neurons from further damage.  In many 
contexts, CB cells dampen, rather than augment, immunological and inflammatory 
responses.  Documented mechanisms include shifts in effector T cells such as gene ration 
of regulatory T cell populations and changes in monocyte/dendritic cell cytokine 
generation leading to anti -inflammatory cytokines.  Therefore, it is plausible to consider a 
population of CB cells as an immunological and/or anti -inflammatory agent.  Both 
postmortem brain tissue studies and PET imaging data from living individuals with ASD 
have revealed evidence of increased microglial activation, suggesting that immune and/or 
inflammatory mediated brain damage plays a role in the etiology of ASD as d iscussed 
above.36  Thus, CB may be a candidate therapy for ASD because of the CB’s 
immunomodulatory activities.  
 
The projected rationale for this therapy focuses on the ability of CB to modify 
inflammation through downstream effects on glial cells and cytokines.  CB cells may not 
be required to proliferate or persist in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  Given that the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_582187] a full complement of stem and progenitor  cells prior to 
treatment, we feel it is unlikely that allogeneic CB cells will engraft in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_582188].  
2.12 Study Design  
This is a single site, prospective , rando mized, double -blind  study of a single  intravenous 
autologous or allogeneic, unrelated  CB infusion in children ages  2-7 years with ASD .  
Participant s will be randomly assigned to Sequence A , consisting of a single infusion of 
CB cells at baseline followed 6 months later by a single infusion of placebo, or Sequence 
B, consisting of an infusion of placebo at baseline fol lowed 6 months later by [CONTACT_582233] .  All participant s will ultimately be treated with CB cells  at some point during 
the study.  Participant s with an available qualified autologous CB unit will receive 
autologous cells, and those without a suitable autologous CB unit available will receive  
cells from a  ≥4/[ADDRESS_765692]  
 
March 15, 2018  25 (rash, shortness of breath, wheezing, difficulty breathing, hypotension, swelling around 
the mouth, throat or eyes, tachycardia, diaphoresis) to the product or transmission of 
infection.   Additional risks associated with infusion of allogeneic CB cells include 
hypertension, bradycardia, anaphylaxis, hematuria, acute hemolytic reaction, rejection of 
cells, immune dysregulation (develop of HLA directed antibodies) , and development of 
graft -versus -host disease.  All CB units are screened for infect ion and must meet release 
criteria prior to infusion, as described below.  Participant s will not receive 
immunosuppressive therapy prior to or after infusion  of CB cells .   
 
Participants will likely require sedation in order to complete a brain MRI and inf usion.  
Risks associated with sedation include nausea, vomiting, b lood vessel injury, nerve 
injur y, lung injury, heart attack, allergy to medications, brain damage , respi[INVESTIGATOR_27580], hypoxia, hypotension, and anaphylaxis , and death .  Medications used for 
sedation may include midazolam, dexmedetomidine, and/or propofol.  Potential risks 
associated with the use of midazolam include excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_582189], headache, 
hiccoughs, cardiac arrest, involuntary movements, agitation, ch anges in breathing 
(decreased, slowing or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_59375]), and decreased oxygen in the blood.  Risks 
associated with the use of dexmedetoidine include increased or decreased blood pressure, 
nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, decreased red blood cells, fev er, changes in heart rhythms 
(abnormal rhythms or a fast or slow heart rate), cardiac arrest, changes in oxygen levels 
or the amount of acid in the blood, fluid on the lungs, slowing of breathing.   Risks 
associated with the use of propofol include pain at the injection site, nausea, vomiting, 
involuntary movements, changes in heart rhythm, heart failure, high blood pressure, 
inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), anaphylaxis or severe allergic reaction, 
seizure, kidney failure, priapi[INVESTIGATOR_8801] (male erection  that doesn’t resolve without medical 
care), changes in breathing (including apnea or the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_59375]), increased acid 
in the blood, or infection in the blood.   These associated risks are described in detail in 
the consent form. Risks associated with blood draws and IVs include  momentary 
discomfort or pain, bruising, infection, bleeding, clotting, and fainting.  Risks associat ed 
with genetic testing include  medical, psychosocial, and economic risks, effects on 
insurability and employability, limit s on educational options , and social stigma.      
 
Potential benefits of this intervention include the possibility that the CB cells may, via 
direct or indirect mechanisms, induce changes that result in the reduction of the 
participant ’s core ASD symptomat ology and improvement in abilities affected by [CONTACT_582234], such as social communication.

Screening for the DukeACT study i s conducted under a separate, I RB-approved 
screening protocol ( Pro00063563 ).  Under this protocol, after written informed consent is 
obtained from a parent/guardian, the patient’s cord blood report (if applicable), medical 
records, school records, photographs, behavioral videos, and res ults of all genetic testing 
are obtained and reviewed by [CONTACT_392729].  The medical review is conducted by a team  of 
pediatric nurses, nurse practitioners, and physicians to identify the presence of any 
metabolic, immunologic, neurologic, sensory, genetic, or  laboratory exclusion criteria.  If 
no such exclusion criteria are identified, the psychiatric review is then conducted by a 
combination of psychologists and psychiatrists with expertise in diagnosing and treating 
children with ASD.  They perform an extens ive review of the patient’s psychological 
records as well as any school and therapy records available.  Both teams review the 
patient’s photographs and records to evaluate for dysmorphic features.  Any patients with 
questionable facial features or findings  on genetic testing are then reviewed by a medical 
geneticist with expertise in genetic conditions associated with ASD.  A patient must be 
approved by [CONTACT_582238]-person screening an d study enrollment.  Should a concern for a 
previously undiagnosed condition or genetic finding arise during the screening process, 
this will be discussed with the patient’s parent(s)/guardian(s) and a referral will be made 
to an appropriate medical or psy chiatric provider for evaluation and treatment, if 
indicated.  
 
5.5 Early Withdrawal of Research Participants  
 Criteria for Removal from Protocol Therapy : 
1. Diagnosis of a genetic disease while under evaluation or on study.  
2. Change in medical condition that precludes study participation.  
 
Patients who are off protocol therapy are to be followed until they meet off -study criteria 
(see below).  Follow -up data will be obtained on off -protocol participants unless consent 
is withd rawn.  Participant s that are taken off study prior to infusion of the CB will be 
considered not evaluable and can be replaced with another participant . 
 
 
March 15, 2018  31  
 
Off-Study Criteria : 
1. Death.  
2. Lost to follow -up. 
3. Withdrawal of consent for any further data collection.  
4. Completion of the final study visit.  
6.[ADDRESS_765702] meet the infectious disease 
and dosing requirements detailed in the sections below.  Matching requirements are as 
follows:  
 
Autologous CB units:   Identity confirmation via low resolution 6/6 HLA match.  
Allogeneic CB units:   Patients’ HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_582192].  Allogeneic units that are potential matches will initially be identified from a 
search of the Carolinas Cord Blood Bank .  The best available HLA -matched ( ≥4/6) CB unit 
with a pre -cryopreservation nucleated cell dose ≥2.5 x 107 cells/kg will be selected.  Once a 
unit is selected,  HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_582193].  When possible, at least 1 match at each HLA loci will be prioritized.   
 A 6/6 matched donor will be sele cted before a 5/6, which will be selected before a 4/[ADDRESS_765703] 4/6 HLA -matched with the 
patient.  
 When a unit is partially mismatched, compatibility at the DR locus will be ranked as 
most important, followed by [CONTACT_582239] B locus and lastly the A locus.   
6.[ADDRESS_765704] been perfor med in a 
CLIA (or equivalent for CB units from international banks) certified donor testing 
laboratory.  Testing must include negative results for:  Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV, 
HTLV, and syphilis .  These tests are superseded by [CONTACT_582240] (ie. HTLV testing is not required or 
routinely performed in certain parts of the world where the infection is not endemic) . 
Additional screening  (i.e. West Nile, Chagas) , which is dependent on the timing of  the 
 
March 15, [ADDRESS_765705] be ≥2.5x107/kg, sterility 
cultures must have been negative and total viability or CD34+ cell viability, if performed, 
must have been >70%.  
 
A test vial or segment mu st be available from each CB unit for potency testing and 
confirmatory HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_582194] .  The test sample will be 
sent/transferred to the Duke University Stem Cell Laboratory (STCL) in the frozen state.  
At the laboratory, the sample wi ll be thawed and tested for viability, CFU, and CD34.  
HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_582195] a related sample either at Duke or another 
certified laboratory.  Units will be deemed acceptable for the trial if the CD45 cell 
population is >40% viable  and/or the CD34+ population is >70% viable .  CFU growth 
and CD34 will be described but will not be a specification for study enrollment.   
 
After testing, CB units from CB banks outside of Duke will be shipped in a dry shipper 
containing a data logger to mon itor temperature to the STCL  at Duke University in the 
frozen state.  Upon receipt, the CB unit will be examined for appropriate labeling and 
integrity of the cryopreservation bag and ports and the confirmation of the frozen state.  
The CB will be transfer red from the dry shipper to a liquid nitrogen freezer and stored 
until the day of infusion.  
 
On the infusion day, all or part of the CB will be thawed and washed with dextran  40 + 
5% human serum albumin in the standard fashion per Standard Operating Procedure.  At 
the time of thawing, standard studies including total nucleated cell count, viability, viable 
CD34+ cell count, CFU, and bacterial culture will be performed on the CB unit in the 
Duke STCL .  A research sample of the CB will be retained for future analyses, and a 
sample of allogeneic CB units will be retained for later chimerism testing.  A goal dose of 
2.5-5x107 TNCC/kg of participant  body weight based on the pre -cryopreservation TNCC 
will be pre pared for infusion in a volume of approximately 30 mL or no more than 5cc/kg 
as determined by [CONTACT_582241].  
6.[ADDRESS_765706] fashion has a pi[INVESTIGATOR_582196] /media content and a distinctive scent due to the DMSO 
used in cryopreservation.  In order for patients and families to be truly blinded to the type 
of infusion they are receiving, the placebo product must be similar in both appearance 
and odor.  Therefore , the placebo product will be acellular and will consist of TC -199 
(pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745]) with 1% DMSO which are standard ingredients in cellular products.  The volume 
of placebo product will be ~[ADDRESS_765707]  
All UCB products receive a unique identification number (ISBT Demand  128 bar code) 
to ensure integrity of the product and maintain chain of custody.  The clinical site or cord 
blood bank will assign an ISBT Demand [ADDRESS_765708], clinical staff or study staff.  After the CB is 
thawed and transported to the clinic, premed ication with Benadryl 0.5mg/kg/dose IV, 
Solumedrol 0.5 -1mg/kg IV will be administered.   The infusion product (CB or placebo) 
will be administered intravenously over [ADDRESS_765709] physician 
supervision.  Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) will be 
checked upon arrival to the clinic and as clinically indicated.  Pulse oximetry will be 
monitored continuously throughout the infusion and for [ADDRESS_765710] infusion.  Patients will be discharged from clinic after a minimum of 1 hour 
providing all vital signs are at their baseline and they are awake, taking oral flui ds, and 
asymptomatic with no evidence of toxicity.  
6.8 Safety Follow -up 
On Day 1 following the infusion, the participant  will be seen by [CONTACT_129435].  At ~[ADDRESS_765711] the parent or guardian via phone or 
email to assess patient status and any adverse events.  A questionnaire (see Appendix 1 ) 
will be administered at 3, 6, 9, and [ADDRESS_765712] -infusion to assess for serious adverse 
events.   Included in the safety assessment, concomitant medications will also be collected 
at a minimum of at the baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 -month time points.  
7.0 STUDY PLAN  
7.1 Overview  
Parents/Guardians who have previously contact[CONTACT_129436] a child who may 
meet eligibility criteria for this study will be notified that this study is available.  After 
initial contact, parents/guardians of potential research participants will h ave an initial 
phone interview with study personnel to describe the study, verify basic eligibility 
criteria, and confirm their interest in participation.  The participant’s eligibility will then 
be screened through review of medical records, video, photos , and laboratory testing 
under a separate screening protocol.  Information on any autologous CB units will also be 
obtained and reviewed.  If t he child appears eligible, and does not have an autologous CB 
unit available, a suitable unrelated donor CB unit will be identified at the Carolinas Cord 
 
March 15, 2018  34 Blood Bank.  The CB unit (autologous or allogeneic) will be screened as described in 
section 6.   
 
Once all screening is complete and the patient is likely to meet study criteria, the patient 
will travel to Duke for  their first visit.  On day 1, the  informed consent will be obtained 
and patient eligibility will be determined by a physical observation and verification of 
ASD diagnosis per DMS -5 criteria.  If the child is deemed eligible, they will be enrolled 
on study  and randomized to the order in which they receive CB and placebo infusions 
(Sequence A or Sequence B).  During their first visit, they will also have a brain MRI, 
neuropsychological  evaluations,  EEG,  and their initial infusion (CB or placebo).  
Participan ts will be evaluated the day after the infusion and parents will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] [ADDRESS_765713] -infusion.  
7.2  Patient Screening  
Initial patient screening will be conducted with informed consent under a separate 
protocol and will includ e a review of medical records, videos, photos, initial laboratory 
testing, screening of autologous CB units  as per section 5.4.  If no exclusion criteria are 
identified,  patient questionnaires  and the Autism Diagnostic Interview - Revised (ADI -R), 
Shortened  Version  are administered .  If a qualified autologous CB unit is not available, 
unrelated donor CB unit will be identified at the Carolinas Cord Blood Bank.   
 
After study eligibility appears likely based on patient and CB criteria, potential 
participant s will travel to Duke for initial evaluation.  Evaluations and treatments will be 
conducted in the outpatient setting.  After  informed consent  is obtained , a brief  physical 
exam and baseline psychological testing will be conducted to confirm eligibility .  If no 
exclusion criteria are realized, t he patient will be enrolled, randomized, and undergo the 
remainder of the study evaluations .   
7.3 CB Unit Selection  
If the child has an available, banked autologous CB unit, the CB report for that unit will 
be obtai ned from the bank at which it is stored, if not already available.  If the autologous  
CB unit meets the donor screening and characterization requirements outlined in section 
6, a sample of the patient’s blood/buccal mucosa, and  CB unit will be obtained for  HLA 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_582197] .   
   
If a participant  does not have a suitable autologous CB unit available, an allogeneic 
unrelated donor CB unit will be identified at the Carolinas Cord Blood Bank .  HLA  
typi[INVESTIGATOR_582198], and t he best available HLA -matched CB unit with 
a pre -cryopreservation nucleated cell dose ≥2.5x107 cells/kg will be chosen according to 
the principles below.  
 When possible, at least 1 match at each HLA loci will be prioritized.   
 When a unit is partially mismatched, compatibility at the DR locus will be ranked 
as most important, followed b y compatibility at the B locus and A locus . 
 
 
March 15, 2018  35 Once a suitable  autologous or allogeneic  CB unit has been deemed an acceptable match, 
a sample of the CB un it will be tested for potency in the Duke STCL .  If results of these 
tests are satisfactory and the CB unit is stored outside of Duke,  the CB unit will be 
delivered to the  Duke  STCL  in the frozen state.  
7.4  Psychological Assessments

7.4.1 Assessments for Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder : 
Diagnosis of ASD will be confirmed by [CONTACT_9288] -[ADDRESS_765715], which will be informed by 
[CONTACT_225556], Second Edition (ADOS -2) and the Autism 
Diagnostic Interview -Revised (ADI -R)-Shortened Version .  Diagnostic evaluations will 
be completed by [CONTACT_582242] -2 and ADI -R. 
 
Autism Diagnostic Interview -Revised (ADI -R), Shortened Version :[ADDRESS_765716],  prior to the participant’s arrival at Duke 
University  and will be used to help inform a DSM -5 diagnosis of ASD .  The ADI -R is a 
comprehensive parent interview that assesses early functioning in three domains: 
language/communication, reciprocal social inte ractions, and restricted, repetitive, and 
stereotyped behaviors and interests.  The research reliable interviewer follows 
standardized procedures for obtaining information and recording responses.  Interview 
questions include various content areas, includi ng the participant ’s background, 
behaviors, early development and milestones, language acquisition, current 
communicative functioning, social development and play, interests and behaviors, and 
any other clinically relevant behaviors. The ADI -R shortened ve rsion follows the same 
protocols as the standard ADI -R, but some of the questions not required for making a 
diagnosis are omitted. The ADI -R shortened version takes between 90 -150 minutes 
depending on the age of the child and the complexity of behaviors.    
 
 
March 15, 2018  36 Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS -2):38 This assessment 
will be used to help inform a DSM -5 diagnosis of ASD. The ADOS -2 is a standardized 
observational assessment of core ASD symptomatology. Age - and language -dependent 
modules are composed of a series of activi ties led by a trained, research -reliable clinician 
to observe the child’s communication, social interactions, play, restricted, and repetitive 
behaviors. ADOS -2 protocols are designed to elicit behaviors that directly map onto the 
ASD DSM -5 criteria.  The ADOS -2 can be administered to toddlers as young as 12 
months of age. Age and verbal ability are used to determine the appropriate module 
(toddler, 1, 2, 3 or 4). For each ADOS -2 Toddler Module assessment, a score will be 
generated using the Toddler Module Calibrated Severity Scores developed by [CONTACT_582243]. 
(2015) to facilitate comparison to other modules. Severity Scores will also be generated 
for Modules [ADDRESS_765717] (DSM -5): This is a clinician checklist based off 
of diagnostic criteria for ASD  within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual edition 5.  
Diagnostic criteria are taken from the DSM -5, and are utilized in order to confirm 
appropriate ASD diagnosis for inclusion in the study.  This checklist is completed by 
[CONTACT_582244]’s best judgment and is informed by [CONTACT_582245] -R, Shortened Version and the ADOS -2. 
The DSM -5 takes less than 5 minutes to complete and will be completed at baseline  and 6 
month visit s.      
 
7.4.2 Other Clinician Assessments :  
Clinical Global Impression (CGI): The CGI is a commonly used rating scale  with two 
components that measures symptom severity and treatment response or change in clinical 
presentation  between  time points. It takes 5 minutes to complete.  
 
The Clinical Global Impression – Severity Scale (CGI -S): The CGI -S is a 7 point scale  
completed  at the baseline and 6 -month  visits that requires the clinician to rate the severity 
of the participant’s symptoms of ASD at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician’s 
past experience with participants who have the same diagnosis.  Based on the clinician’s 
lifeti me clinical experience, a participant is assessed on severity of ASD  symptoms at the 
time of rating - 1, normal, no symptoms; 2, borderline level of symptoms; 3, mild 
symptoms; 4, moderate symptoms; 5, marked symptoms; 6, severe symptoms; or 7, 
extremely severe symptoms. The will be three separate CGI -S ratings; these include 
social communicative functioning, restricted/repetitive interests and behaviors, and 
overall. The CGI -S will be completed at baseline and 6 month visits.  
 
The Clinical Global Impression – Improvement (CGI -I): The CGI -I is a 7 point scale that 
requires the clinician  to assess how much the participant’s ASD symptoms  have 
improved or worsened relative to a baseline asses sment. The symptoms are rated as: 1, 
very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, 
minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse. The re will be three separate 
CGI-I ratings :  social communicative functioning, restricted/repetitive interests and 
behaviors, and overall improvement. The C GI-I will be completed at the 6 -month visit.  
 
March 15, 2018  37  
Continuou s Visual Scale of Chang e (Visual Change): The Visual Change is completed at 
the 6-month  visit as a measure of improvement for the key domains of impairment 
associated with ASD. There will be three separate scal es of change completed:  social 
communicative functioning, restricted/repetitive interests and behaviors, and overall 
improvement. The rater places a vertical line on the scale indicating how much he/she 
feels the part icipant has improved or worsened compared to the baseline visit , with the 
center of the scale indicating “No Meaningful Changes.”   When data is entered, the 
distance to the line and total length of the bar will be measured.  In contrast to the CGI-
S and I, it is not specifical ly anchored to pre-specified  levels of abnormal behaviors, 
functional abilities or level of suppo rts, or pre-specified  "amounts of change." It is a 
continuous measure based on the individual cli nician's judgment.  The rater should base 
his or her judgment on the amount of change observed during various assessments  and on 
the CGI and Visual Scales Parent Interview.  Completion of the Visual Scale takes less 
than 5 minutes  and is completed at the 6 -month visit.  
 
CGI and Visual Scales Parent Interview: The CGI and Visual Scales Parent Interview is  
completed by a clinician and conducted with the primary caregiver . The interview focuses 
on the participant’s social communication abilities and challenges, restricted in terests, 
repetitive behaviors, and overall functioning.  The clinician will obtain details about 
frequency and quality of behaviors in different contexts, such as at home, in school, and in 
the community, as well as details about the level of support the ch ild requires to function 
in each setting. The interview will be completed at the baseline visit and updated at the 6 -
month visit. The interview will take around 30 minutes to complete at the baseline visit 
and will take around 15 minutes to complete at the  6-month visit.  
 
Differential Ability Scales, Second Edition (DAS -II):[ADDRESS_765718] is appropriate for ages 2 years, 6 months through 17 years, 11 
months and will be used for participants aged 4 years, 0 months and older at baseline. 
This assessment takes about 45 minutes and will be conducted at the baselin e visit  only.  
 
Mullen Scales of Early Learning, AGS Edition :40 The Mullen Scales of Early Learning is 
a cognitive functioning assessment specifically designed for very young children and 
preschoolers, from birth to 68 months.   It measures five scales of cognitive functioning: 
Gross Motor, Visual Reception, Fine Motor, Expressive Language, and Receptive 
Language  (note: for DukeACT, the Gross Motor subscale will n ot be 
administered) .  Each scale is tested individually, and the exam is not timed.   Some of the 
questions may require parental input in order to assess the child’s ability.   The exam is 
interactive and includes toys and manipulatives for the child to enga ge with during the 
exam. Test administration time varies from approximately 15 minutes for a one -year-old 
to an hour for 5 -year-olds. The Mullen will be used with participants under 4 years, 0 
months at the baseline visit. This assessment takes about 60 mi nutes and will be 
conducted at the baseline visit  only.  
 
 
March 15, 2018  38 Parent -Child Interaction with Noldus EthoVision : During the Parent -Child Interaction 
Task, Noldus EthoVision will be used. The purpose of the video tracking is to determine 
whether automated trackin g of children’s movements related to social approach or 
avoidance can be reliability administered and provide a valid measure of social 
communication in children with ASD . This paradigm is designed to automatically track 
movements related to social approac h and avoidance behavior of children with ASD with 
a familiar adult. The primary dependent variable is the time spent in the periphery of a 
room versus near the adult .  Children will be observed during two contiguous sessions 
conducted in the same room comprised of (1) a six -minute free -play session with toys 
available during which the caregiver will be silently reading a magazine in the corner on 
the room and (2) a six -minute parent -child interaction, where the parent joins the child 
for interactive play to see how the child plays with the adult and vice versa.  Behavior 
will be recorded from a ceiling -mounted camera and software will be used to 
automatically track the c hild’s movements.  Dependent variables include percentage of 
session spent in the caregiver region of interest (ROI), latency to approach the caregiver 
ROI, and percentage of time spent in the periphery ROI. The Parent -Child Interaction 
Task will be conduc ted at baseline and [ADDRESS_765719], Fourth Edition :41 This is a child 
observation by a trained clinician that  tests an individual’s ability to match a spoken word 
with an image of an object, action, or concept. It tests an individual’s ability to name, 
with one word, objects, actions, and concepts when presented with color illustrations. 
This test is appropriate for ages 2 -80 years and takes about 10 -30 minutes to complete; 
completion time is determined by [CONTACT_28045]’s verbal ability. This assessment will be 
conducted at baseline and 6 m onth visit s. 
 
Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) - 3 Survey Interview Form :42 This will be 
used to assess adaptive behavior. The assessment  is administered to the parent/caregiver 
using a semi -structured interview format. This assessment can be used with ages [ADDRESS_765720] -baseline.  
 
7.4.3 Parent Caregiver Questionnaires:  
These questionnaires will be completed during baseline and 6 month visits at Duke and 
will be sent to the parent/guardian to complete remotely throughout the study . All parent 
questionnaires will be completed online through the survey tool Qualtrics. The Qualtrics 
survey tool is available for Duke users through a university -wide site licen se. Qualtrics is 
integrated with Duke’s NetID authentication system but allows sharing of surveys with 
non-Duke users.  Parents/guardians will access the Qualtrics  links through a secure, 
personalized parent portal built by [INVESTIGATOR_145752].  The parent p ortal will be password 
protected.  
 
 
March 15, 2018  39 Pervasive Developmental Disorder Behavior Inventory (PDD -BI):43 The PDD -BI was 
developed to assess responsiveness to intervention in children with ASD. The PDD -BI is 
an informant -based rating scale that is desig ned for children 1 year, 6 mos. to 12 years, 5 
mos. It assesses problem behaviors as well as appropriate social, language, and 
learning/memory skills. The PDD -BI assesses both social impairments typi[INVESTIGATOR_582199] a nd development of pro -social skills 
that are integral to improved reciprocal social behavior. The PDD -BI renders raw scores 
as well as t -scores based on comparisons to a standardized ASD population.  The PDD -
BI has been validated in a PDD -BI development sa mple of [ADDRESS_765721] -Community (ABC -C):44 This parent -completed rating scale 
will be used to measure aberrant behaviors associated with ASD, with an emphasis on 
social withdrawal. The ABC -C is a  validated scale that can assess drug and other 
treatment effects in studies with developmentally -disabled individuals. Separate factor 
analyses of data from samples of institutionalized participant s (n = 418 [mean age 29.5 
yrs.] in Stage 1 and n = 509 [mean age 25.9 yrs.] in Stage 2) resulted in a 5 -factor scale 
comprising 58 items. The factors were labeled as (1) Irritability, Agitation, Crying; (2) 
Social Withdrawal; (3) Stereotypic Behavior; (4) Hyperactivity, Noncompliance; and (5) 
Inappropriate Spe ech. The ABC -SQW has been used in other clinical trials focusing on 
the core social and communication symptoms of autism.  The ABC -C has 58 items, and 
each item is rated as 0= not at all a problem, 1= the behavior is a problem, but slight in 
degree, 2= the  problem is moderately serious, or 3= the problem is severe in degree. This 
parent -completed rating scale takes approximately [ADDRESS_765722] -baseline.  
 
Intervention History Questionnaire : This  questionnaire is completed by  a primary 
caregiver to obtain detailed information on behavioral  health  interventions that the 
child/family has been involved in over the past [ADDRESS_765723] administered .  Information is collected about the  type and quantity of interventions, 
services, and treatments the child is receiving.  This questionnaire  will be administered 
on a monthly basis . 
 
Behavior Rating Invent ory of Executive Function -Preschool Version (BRIEF -P):[ADDRESS_765724] -baseline.  
 
March 15, 2018  40  
Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF ):46 This as sessment is a 
questionnaire for  parents of school age children that enables professionals to assess 
executive  function behaviors in the home and school environments. The parent form of 
the BRIEF contains 86 items within eight theoretically and empi[INVESTIGATOR_582200]: Inhibit, Shift, Emotional 
Control, Initiate, Working Memory, Plan/Organize, Organization of Materials, and 
Monitor. The BRIEF takes about [ADDRESS_765725] -baseline.  
 
Sensory Experiences Questionnaire, Version 2.1 (SEQ) :47,48 The SEQ 2.1 asks parents to 
respond, on a 5 -point Likert scale, to 45 questions about the frequency of their children’s 
responses to sensory stimuli in the context of daily activities and routines. This study will 
use a modified version that only asks parents to complete the Likert scale questions and 
omits all open -ended questions. The SEQ 2.1 has been validated for children w ith autism 
ages 2 -12 years, been shown to discriminate children with ASD from developmental 
delay and typi[INVESTIGATOR_393275], and has a high internal consistency (α = 0.80) .49 
Summary scores will be derived for hyper -responsiveness (SOR). The SEQ 2.1 takes 
around 10 minutes to complete and will only be completed at the baseline visit.  
 
Early Life Exposures Assessment Tool (ELEAT) : This is a parent questionnaire that 
assesses f or a multitude of environmental exposures that the parents/child may have been 
exposed to in the child’s early life and development. The questionnaire asks a variety of 
questions about life before pregnancy, during pregnancy, and during the child’s first y ear 
of life, and gives a very detailed, quantitative look at any possible food or chemical 
exposures that may have been harmful. A modified and shortened version of the ELEAT 
which only includes relevant variables will be used for the study.  This assessme nt takes 
about 10 minutes to complete and will only be completed at the baseline visit.  
 
Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scale s:50 The 
PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales is a  10 minute parent questionnaire that 
measures gastrointestinal symptoms in children as over 50% of child ren with ASD suffer 
from gastrointestinal discomfort. This assessment will be completed at baseline and [ADDRESS_765726] -baseline.  
 
Demographic information will be obtained at the baseline visit for each participant using 
the Duk e Center for Autism and Brain Development Demographics Form.  Interval 
medical and social histor ies will be obtained at the six -month visit in person and with the 
aid of interval history q uestionnaire s. 
 
7.4.4 Other Assessments :  
The Visit Preparation Inventory is a brief questionnaire that is completed with the parent 
prior to the child’s visit. Information about the child’s preferences and dislikes is assessed 
on this form that is then utilized to prepare reinforcement techniques  for the child’s visit. 
In addition, sensory sensitivities related to the completion of EEG or eye tracking are

one to two weeks before baseline and 6  month visit s. 
 
  
7.5 Neurophysiology and Neuroimaging  
7.5.1 Neurophysiology:   
Electroencephalography (EEG):   EEG is a non -invasive measure of brain activity. A 
flexible dense array of electrodes (EGI System 400, Electrical Geodesics Inc., Eugene, 
Oregon) is placed over the head and secured with a chin strap. EEG signals are amplified 
and sent to recording computer fo r on-line viewing.  EEG is used here to investigate 
patterns of brain activity elicited by [CONTACT_582247] -social stimuli. The EEG takes around 
20 minutes to complete and will be completed at baseline and 6 month visits.  
 
EEG will be used to assess changes in cortical activation (as reflected by [CONTACT_582248], theta, and beta rhythms) and functional connectivity (as reflected by [CONTACT_582249]) during a baseline condition and while viewing social and non -social  
stimuli.  Alpha oscillations have been shown to emerge from activations of the thalamo -
cortical network and have also been demonstrated to be present in subcortical areas, 
including the hippocampal region.   Alpha frequencies result from a reciprocal inter play 
between excitatory and inhibitory neurons and are influenced by [CONTACT_582250], 
serotonergic, and glutamaterigic mechanisms.   Alpha activity increases during a relaxed 
state and decreases during active stimulus processing.  Theta oscillations are especia lly 
prominent in the hippocampal region, are influenced by [CONTACT_582251] -animobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) neurons, and may 
correlate with synaptic plasticity.    
 
EEG will be recorded during a resting baseline state and while viewing standardized 
videotaped segments of social (female singing a nursery rhyme) and nonsocial (activated 
toys) stimuli.  In a study of preschool aged children with ASD, alpha and theta EEG 
power during viewing of social and nonsocial stimuli have  been shown to change as a 
function of behavioral treatment and are specifically correlated with improvements in 
social behavior.51   EEG data will be recorded from 128 -channel dense electrode array 
Geodesic sensor nets (recorded online with reference to t he vertex) at [ADDRESS_765728] -detection software (Net Station 4.4) and hand -editing without 
knowledge of group membership.  
 
Spectral analyses. EEG dat a will be Fourier -transformed using Welch's method  
(implemented in Matlab, R2012b).   Power estimates will be averaged across electrode 
groups (right posterior and anterior, left posterior and anterior, midline occipi[INVESTIGATOR_582201]) and natural log -transfor med to reduce skew. Planned analyses contrasted 
power in the theta (5 -7 Hz) and alpha (9 -11 Hz) bands during the presentation of face 
versus object stimuli, allowing the analyses to account for individual differences in 
absolute power.  Alpha and theta pow er will be analyzed using repeated measures 
ANOVAs, with stimulus (face, object) and region as within -participant  variables.  
 
March 15, 2018  42  
Eye Tracking of Social Stimuli (EGT):  The EGT is a [ADDRESS_765729] and hold the 
child’s attention.  The EGT will be conducted at baseline and 6 month visits.     
 
7.5.2  Neuroimaging :  
MRI will be used to assess potential structural/anatomic modifications, and functional 
chan ges, in the brain before and after cell therapy. MRI images will also be used to 
correlate brain iron with ASD symptoms.  Changes in MRI images may reflect alterations 
in astrocyte activity, blood perfusion, fiber tract integrity, brain network integrity, myelin 
microstructural integrity and brain functional connectivity.  The following imaging will 
be utilized:  
 
 High -Resolution T1 Imaging, 3D IR -prepped FSPGR, 1x1x1 mm resolution, 
estimated imaging time 3 min.  
 High -resolution perfusion imaging, 3D spi[INVESTIGATOR_23585] w ith arterial spin labeling, target 
resolution 1.5x1.5x1.5 mm (will evaluate 1x1x1 provided SNR is sufficient), 
estimated imaging time 3 min.  
 High -resolution diffusion tensor imaging, 2D multi -shot DW EPI [INVESTIGATOR_582202], 25 diffusion encoding directions, b f actor 800 s/mm2, target 
resolution 1.5.x1.5x1.5 mm  (will evaluate 1x1x1 provided SNR is sufficient), 
estimated imaging time 10 min.  
 High -resolution fcMRI, 2D single - or two -shot EPI [INVESTIGATOR_582203], target 
resolution 1.5x1.5x1.5 mm (will evaluate 1x1x1 prov ided SNR is sufficient), 
estimated imaging time 10 min. (5 min. per run, two runs).  
 High -resolution quantitative susc eptibility imaging , multi -echo 3D FSPGR 
based acquisition, target resolution 1x1x1 mm, estimated imaging time 5 min.  
7.6 Biological Samples  
The following samples will be obtained for future biomarker studies (see Appendix 2 for 
additional details):  
 Blood for immunological, DNA, and RNA studies  
 Blood for generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs)  
 Urine  
 Saliva  
 Parental blood samples

8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This study will enroll autistic children age 2 to 7 years of age. Participants will be 
randomized in a 2:[ADDRESS_765736] blood or placebo with stratification by [CONTACT_582255] (see below for randomization plan). The primary objective of the study 
will be fulfilled by [CONTACT_582256] [ADDRESS_765737] blood to placebo . Power for the pre -planned  subgroup 
analyses  is described using the sample size planned for the primary comparison.  
Note:  All children in the  placebo arm will receive cord blood after reaching their six -
month evaluation. This serves simultaneously as a recruitment tool and to inform 
exploratory analyses. However, sample size and power calculations are based only on the 
planned comparisons betwe en patients assigned cord blood vs. placebo at six months.  
8.1 Study Design  
This is a single site, prospective, randomized, double -blind, parallel group study of a 
single intravenous autologous or allogeneic, unrelated CB infusion in children ages 2 -7 
years with ASD.  Participant s will be randomly assigned to Sequence A , consistin g of a 
single infusion of CB cells at baseline followed 6 months later by a single infusion of 
placebo, or Sequence B , consisting of an infusion of placebo at baseline followed 6 
months later by [CONTACT_582257].  All participant s will be treated wi th CB cells; 
participant s with an available qualified autologous CB unit will receive autologous cells, 
and those without suitable autologous CB available will receive ≥4/[ADDRESS_765738] Blood Ban k.  All infusions 
will be double -blinded.  The primary outcomes will be assessed 6 months after the initial 
infusion in the sequence.  Duration of study participation will be 12 months from the time 
of baseline  infusion.  
8.2 Accrual  
It is estimated that up  to 4 research participant s will be enrolled each week and that 
approximately 15 months of accrua l will be necessary to enroll 190 participant s.   
8.3 Study Duration  
Research participants will be followed for safety for 6 months after the second study 
infusion.  
8.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized for all research 
participants.  Characteristics to be examined include age, sex, race/ethnicity, and baseline 
behavioral status.  
8.[ADDRESS_765739] outcome measure recommended for use in interventional clinical trials of autism ,52 a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (the DukeABC trial) was conducted that en rolled [ADDRESS_765740] Score  
The VABS -3 will be administered to the participant’s parents by [CONTACT_582258] . 
The VABS -3 measures adaptive behavior in several domains including socialization, 
which is the domain used as the primary  outcome measure in this trial. The socialization 
domain is  a summary of measures in three subdomains: interpersonal relationships, play 
and leisure time, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110]. Raw scores within these subdomains are standardized 
to V-scale scores for each domain (mean=15, SD=3). The sum of the subdomain V -scale 
score s are then standardized to a normal distribution with mean [ADDRESS_765741] score over a six -month period (n=24) in the 
DukeABC trial was 2 points (range: -8 to 30) and this was significantly different from  
zero (P=0.02, Wilcoxon signed rank test). Children with non -verbal IQ less than 55 (n=9) 
had a median change of -1 point (range: -8 to 14) whereas children with non -verbal IQ 
>=55 (n=15) had a median change of 6 points (range: -6 to 30) (P=0.02, Wilcoxon rank 
sum test). No association was observed between the change score and sex (P=.07, 
Wilcoxon rank sum test, n=4 females) or baseline age (Spearman r = -0.18, P=0.41).  
8.7 Sample Size and Power Calculations  
We estimated the sample size required for 80% po wer to detect various standardized 
effect sizes  comparing patients randomized to cord blood vs. placebo. The Type I error 
rate was fixed at 2.5%  for this comparison  to account  for the additional pre -planned 
comparisons described in later section s.  
 
The nu ll and alternative hypotheses for the primary comparison are:  
 
𝐻0: 𝜇𝐶𝐵−𝜇𝑃=0 
𝐻𝐴: 𝜇𝐶𝐵−𝜇𝑃≠[ADDRESS_765742]. Calculations 
were done using PASS 12.0 using non -central t -distributions. The table below shows the

A total sample size of 144 ([ADDRESS_765744] blood and 48 on placebo) will provide 80% power 
to detect a moderate ( d=0.55)  sized treatment effect given the stated design parameters. 
Expansion of the sample size by ~ 15% to allow for dropout , and to facilitate  pi[INVESTIGATOR_582204] 2 -3 enrolled subjects yields an approximate sample size of 
165 participants ([ADDRESS_765745] blood and 55  on placebo). Therefore, with a sample size 
of 165 participants allocated 2:[ADDRESS_765746] blood: placebo, the trial will have greater 
than 80% power to detect a moderate sized treatment effect with strict control of 
Type I error.  However, in recognition of the potential need to modify the sample size to 
maintain power for the planned alternative hypothesis (see Section 8.13, Interim 
Analysis) we set an anticipated maximum of [ADDRESS_765747] ANOVA framework where the 
main effects were treatment (cord blood or placebo) and cell source (autolo gous or 
allogeneic). Within this model the investigation of cell source is formulated as the F -test 
of interaction in the [ADDRESS_765748] uses the Bonferroni -corrected alpha specified in the primar y analysis (0.025). A 
primary assumption of this model is that group sizes are equal. Given the design of our 
trial this is unlikely to occur. Nonetheless, illustration of detectable effect sizes with 
balanced deigns can be instructive as they provide the “best case scenario.” Given a fixed 
 
March 15, [ADDRESS_765749] sizes in our trial.  
 
We began by [CONTACT_582259] a balanc ed design with an average of 41.2 5 
patients per group (the planned accrual of [ADDRESS_765750]  blood/placebo and autologous/allogeneic) and a common main effect and 
interaction effect size. Using PASS version 12.[ADDRESS_765751] approximately 80% 
power to detect a standardized effect size of 0.25 (considered a medium ANOVA effect 
size by [CONTACT_30822]) for the interaction test. Using an average sample size that is equal to the 
smallest expected group sample size in our trial (n=2 7.5, assuming the placebo group is 
evenly d ivided by [CONTACT_235845]) the detectable effect size is 0.33, which is closer to the 
large (0.4) effect size defined by [CONTACT_30822].  
 
Therefore, we can be confident that our trial will be able to detect moderate to large 
differences in the treatment effect by [CONTACT_582260] I error using 
an unbalanced [ADDRESS_765752] ANOVA.  
8.9 Correction for Multiple Testing  
Our sample size plan incorporates the Bonferroni adjustment for control of Type I error 
across the pre -planned statistical tests involving the primary endpoint; i.e., the test of cord 
blood vs. placebo and the test of interaction that evaluates treatment effect by [CONTACT_235845].  
 
Secondary endpoints will be tested assuming a per -comparison alpha of 0.05. The False 
Discovery Rate (FDR) procedure wi ll then be applied to determine which results are 
significant after consideration for multiple testing. The primary endpoint comparison of 
cord blood vs. placebo will be included in the FDR procedure.  
 
Further details are available in the Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP) . 
8.[ADDRESS_765753] blood or placebo with stratification by [CONTACT_654] 
(< 5 vs. >=5 years) , non-verbal IQ (<55 vs. >=55) , and best available cell source 
(autologous vs. allogeneic) and will utilize a randomly varying block size with 2:[ADDRESS_765754] score over a 6 -month period. 
Age is also a likely confounder as children’s developmental rate varies with age. The 
availability of autologous or allogeneic cord blood prior to randomization is a potential 
confounder as it might correlate with socioecon omic status, and this may influence the 
use of therapy outside the trial. Although there is a dearth of efficacious therapi[INVESTIGATOR_582205], the use of therapy outside the trial may 
result in a tendency of parents to over -report positive outcomes on the Vineland -[ADDRESS_765755] blood groups.  
 
March 15, 2018  50 8.11 Analysis Plan  
Full details of the planned a nalysis are available in the accompanying Statistical Analysis 
Plan (SAP). Briefly, safety analyses will be primarily descriptive and will rely on 
graphical displays and tabulated descriptive statistics. The primary efficacy analysis 
comparing cord blood t o placebo is based on a two -sample t-test of the mean difference 
(from baseline to 6 months) in the VABS [ADDRESS_765756] 
2-3 enrolled subjects and therefore these subjects may not be included in the primary 
analysis. Additional analyses are described in the SAP.  
 
Analysis Populations : 
Full Analysis Population  
This population constitutes all enrolled  participants  and is used for descriptive purposes ; 
e.g. to identify subjects who are not evaluable for the primary efficacy analysis.  
  
Modified Intention to Treat (mITT)  Population  
This analysis set will include only subjects who complete all of the baseline and follow -
up VABS -[ADDRESS_765757] score.  Subjects who are missing one or both 
of these evaluations cannot contribute to the primary efficacy analysis because the change 
score on the VABS -3 socialization domain is not observable.   Subjects will be analyzed  
according to the treatment they were assigned (regardless of what they actually receive).  
  
Safety Population  
The safety population will include all subjects who received at least [ADDRESS_765758]’s status with regard to each analysis population will be determined prior to 
breaking the blind.   
8.[ADDRESS_765759] to follow -up or are discontinued from the study will not be replaced, 
and additional participant s will not be randomized.  
8.13 Interim Analysis  
A blinded re -estimation of sample size will be conducted when the primary endpoint is 
evaluable on approximately 75% of the participants.  
 
9.0 SAFETY AND ADVER SE EVENT REPORTING  
9.1 Definitions  
Adverse Event (AE) :  An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence associated 
with the use of the investigational product regardle ss of whether it is considered related to 
the investigational product.   
 
 
March 15, 2018  51 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) :  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any 
of the f ollowing outcomes:  death, a life threatening adverse event, inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant 
incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a 
conge nital anomaly/birth defect.  Important medical events that may not result in death, 
be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or participant  and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition.  
 
Grade/Severity :  Grade/severity will be assessed according to CTCAE v4.0 guidelines.  
 
Suspected Adverse Reaction :  A suspected adverse reaction is any adverse event for 
which there is a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused the adverse 
event.  “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the invest igational product and the adverse event.  
 
Causality :  The investigator will use the following question when assessing causality of 
an adverse event to the investigational product:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the 
investigational product caused the event?”  An affirmative answer designates the event as 
a suspected adverse reaction.  
9.[ADDRESS_765760] be recorded.  Information to be reported inc ludes when the site became aware of the 
event, investigator -specified assessment of severity and relationship to study therapy, 
whether there is an alternative etiology, seriousness, any treatment or evaluations, and 
outcome.  In general, investigators sho uld report AEs as diseases or syndromes whenever 
possible, instead of reporting individual component symptoms, signs, laboratory 
abnormalities, and sequelae.  
SAEs  (fatal, life -threatening or requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) will be reported within 7 
calendar day s of receipt of the information.  All fatal or life threatening SAEs will be 
reported by [CONTACT_093] /representative to the FDA by [CONTACT_168875] 7 calendar

the investigational product.  These documents should be retained for a longer period, 
however, if required by [CONTACT_1214].  
12.[ADDRESS_765764] Operating Procedures or Working Practice Documents 
or Guidelines.   
12.1 Confidentiality  
All laboratory specimens, evaluation forms, reports, and other records will be identified 
in a manner designed to maintain research participant confidentiality.  All records will be 
kept in a secure storage area with limited access.  Clinical information will not be 
released without the written permission of the research participant’s guardian except as 
necessary for monitoring and auditing.  
 
March 15, [ADDRESS_765765] Approval  
Federal regulations and the ICH guidelines require that approval be obtained from an IRB 
prior to participation of human research participants in research studies.  Prior to the 
study onset, the protocol, informed consent, any advertisement used to recruit  study 
patients, and any other written information regarding this study to be provided to the 
research participant or the research participant’s legal guardian must be approved by [CONTACT_5040].   
All IRB approvals should be signed by [CONTACT_582262] e and must identify 
the IRB name [CONTACT_3816], the clinical protocol by [CONTACT_29985]/or protocol number, and the 
date the approval and/or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_11744].  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator is responsible for obtaining continued 
revie w of the clinical research at intervals not exceeding one year or otherwise specified 
by [CONTACT_1201].  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator must supply the Sponsor or its 
designee with written documentation of continued review of the clinical researc h. 
12.[ADDRESS_765766] be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_1201].   
12.4 Informed Consent  
A written informed con sent in compliance with Part 50 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) and Institutional IRB shall be obtained from each research participant 
prior to entering the study or performing any unusual or non -routine procedure that 
involves risk to  the research participant.   
Before enrollment, each prospective research participant and/or his/her legal guardian 
will be given a full explanation of the study and be allowed to read the approved 
informed consent form.  Once the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_582208]-Investigator is assured 
that the research participant/legal guardian understands the implications of participating 
in the study, the research participant/legal guardian will be asked to give consent to 
participate in the study by [CONTACT_1725].  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator shall provide a signed/dated copy of the 
signed informed consent to the research participant and/or legal guardian.   
12.[ADDRESS_765767] document and explain in 
the research participant’s source documentation any deviation from the approved 
protocol.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator may implement a deviation 
from, or a change of, the protocol to eli minate an immediate hazard to study research 
participants without prior IRB approval.  As soon as possible after such an occurrence, 
 
March 15, 2018  55 the implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it, and any proposed protocol 
amendment(s) should be submitted to the IRB for review and approval, to the Sponsor for 
agreement, and to the regulatory authorities, if required.  
A deviation from the protocol is an unintended and/or unanticipated departure from the 
procedures and/or processes approved by [CONTACT_582263] B and agreed to by [CONTACT_1268] [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator.  Deviations usually have an impact on 
individual research participants or a small group of research participants and do not 
involve inclusion/exclusion or primary endpoint criteria.  A prot ocol violation occurs 
when there is nonadherence to the protocol that results in a significant, additional risk to 
the research participant, when the research participant or Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -
Investigator has failed to adhere to significant pro tocol requirements (inclusion/exclusion 
criteria) and the research participant was enrolled without prior Sponsor approval, or 
when there is nonadherence to FDA regulations and/or ICH GCP guidelines.  
Protocol violations and deviations will be documented by  [CONTACT_582264].  Principal Investigators or Sub -Investigators will be 
notified of violations and/or deviations in writing by [CONTACT_2037].  The IRB should be 
notified of all protocol violations and deviation s in a timely manner as required by [CONTACT_39722]’s IRB.

submit reports of serious adverse events according to the timeline and method outl ined in 
the protocol.  In addition, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator agrees to submit 
annual reports to his/her IRB as appropriate.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -
Investigator also agrees to provide the Sponsor with an adequate report sho rtly after 
completion of the Principal Investigator’s or Sub -Investigator’s participation in the study.  
12.7 Financial Obligations  
Duke University is not financially responsible for further testing/treatment of any medical 
condition that may be detected du ring the screening progress.  In addition, in the absence 
of specific arrangements, Duke University is not financially responsible for further

by a pediatric anesthesiologist  per their practice guidelines and based on each child’s clinical 
status.  The guidelines for the sedation procedure are detailed below:  
 
Equipment:  
MRI compatible oxygen delivery system  
Oxygen saturation monitor and probe  
Appropriate sized ambu bag and mask  
Suction  
Blood pressure monitoring capability  
Continuous heart monitoring  
End tidal CO 2 monitoring device  
Supplies to obtain IV access  
 
 
Premedication: (for IV placement/sedation)  
Midazolam 0.5mg/kg orally or 0.2mg/kg intranasally, administered [ADDRESS_765795] observation.  
 
 
Sedation options:  
Dexmedetomidine (load of up to 2mcg/kg and an infusi on of 0.2 -2.0mcg/kg/hr) IV  
 
Or

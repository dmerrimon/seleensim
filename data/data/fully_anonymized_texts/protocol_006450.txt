Title of Project :   
PROTOCOL IV.  Effect of Plasma Glucose Reduction by [CONTACT_364699]2 Inhibition on Mitochondrial 
Dysfunction and Impaired Insulin Signaling/Sensitivity in T2DM  
 
 
1.  Purpose and objectives.           List the purpose and objectives:  
 
PRIMARY AI M:  To examine the effect of chronic treatment of T2DM subjects with dapagliflozin (a potent, highly specific inhibitor of 
renal glucose transport [SGLT2]) on mitochondrial gene function/expression and insulin signaling/action.  HYPOTHESIS: 
Chronically ele vated plasma glucose levels in T2DM impair mitochondrial function/gene expression and insulin signaling/sensitivity 
by [CONTACT_364700] (FACoA/DAG), secondary to increased malonyl CoA an d 
inhibition of  CPT I.  Induction of glucosuria with dapagliflozin will normalize/reduce plasma glucose (thereby [CONTACT_364701]/or levels of toxic lipid metabolites), leading to improved mitochondrial function and insulin signaling.  
 
SECONDARY AIM:  To examine the effect of chronic treatment of T2DM with dapaglifozin  on oral glucose tolerance and beta cell 
function. HYPOTHESIS: Chronically elevated plasma glucose levels in T2DM impair insulin secretion by [CONTACT_364702]. Correct ion of hyperglycemia will decrease the beta cell content of hexosamine metabolites, leading to improved 
insulin secretion.

a. Background  
“Glucotoxicity”  also has implicated as a cause of insulin resistance and impaired beta cell function in T2DM (1,2 ).  Although 
abundant support for the glucotoxicity hypothesis has been provided by [CONTACT_364703]  (3-14) studies in animals, a rigorous test 
of this h ypothesis in man is lacking.   Normalization of day -long plasma glucose levels with intensive insulin therapy has either no 
effect on or produces only modest improvements in insulin sensitivity/secretion (reviewed in ref #15 ).  However, these studies are 
difficult to interpret because chronic hyperinsulinemia produces insulin resistance and inhibits endogenous insulin secretion, 
negating any beneficial effects of reduced plasma glucose.  We have shown that treatment of partially pancreatectomized diabe tic 
rats with phlorizin restores normal insulin sensitivity (8) by [CONTACT_364704] (9) .  Chronically elevated 
plasma glucose levels in animals in vivo  and in vitro  (15-21) impair mitochondrial function and increase reactive oxygen specie s 
(ROS), which would accentuate the defects in fuel (glucose and FFA) metabolism.  In mice, glucosamine infusion induces insuli n 
resistance, decreases mitochondrial gene expression, impairs oxidative phosphorylation, and increases ROS (17 ).  Increased ROS 
activates inflammatory pathways (IkB/NF -kB, p38 MAPK, JNK) and these serine kinases have been shown to inhibit insulin 
signaling in insulin target tissues (20 -28).  We propose to test the glucotoxicity hypothesis by [CONTACT_364705] 2 diabetic subjects (T2DM) with an inhibitor of renal glucose transport, dapaglifozin, and examining the effect of 
restoration of normoglycemia on mitochondrial function an d insulin signaling/sensitivity. Lastly, we will test the “glucolipotoxicity ”

magnified in the presence of concurrent hyperglycemia. Thus, high glucose levels increase malonyl CoA, which inhibits CPT I, 
leading to accumulation of FACoA/DAG, which impair mitochondrial function and in hibit insulin action (Figure 1).

(not including incompetent  or impaired decision making  capacity ), describe the assessment process  for determining 
whether the individual is capable of giving informed consent (i.e., evaluation criteria, time intervals)  
Subjects who are interes ted in participating in studies on the Diabetes Research Unit (DRU) will be asked to come to the 7th 
floor (Diabetes Research Unit of the Bartter Research Unit) of the South [LOCATION_007] Veterans Health Care System for an interview.  
During the interview the stud y will be explained to the subject  by [CONTACT_364712].  The subject then will be asked to read the consent form and ask question s about the study. After reading the 
consent form and all questions and c oncerns have been answered, the subject will be asked to sign and date the consent 
form in front of a witness, who will witness the consent procedure.  After the consent form is signed by [CONTACT_2299], the 
witness , and the investigator, a copy of the si gned consent will be made and given to the participant. Then inclusion/exclusion 
criteria will be reviewed with the subject.  The subject’s height and weight will be measured, and the body mass index (BMI) 
will be calculated. If there are no exclusion crit eria, if the subject meets the inclusion criteria, and if the BMI is within the range 
described in the protocol, a history and physical exam will be performed.  If the history and physical exam are within normal  
limits, non -fasting screening blood tests (a s dictated by [CONTACT_760]) , pregnancy test (for women only), urinalysis and EKG will 
be obtained.

The study participants will receive  5 visits , during which we will perform baseline studies to assess insulin sensitivity in skeletal 
muscle and liver of the study participants before and after 2 weeks of  dapagliflozin treatment. For this purpose, subjects will be 
screened for eligibility to participate in the study at visit 1  and also be given the option of completing the OGTT and DEXA during 
visit 1 after consented and screened . If eligible subjects  do not complete the OGTT and DEXA during visit 1 they  will perform 75 -
gram  OGTT and  DEXA scan in visit 2 . In visit 3 , subjects will receive a baseline insulin clamp (insulin sensitivity) test with muscle 
biopsy. During this visit also we will start the  dapagliflo zin treatment . Between days 14-19, subjects will return to the  BRU for visit 4 
for a repeat OGTT. Subjects will return to the  BRU for visit 5, between days 16 -21 in which the insulin clamp will be repeated. The 
procedures to be performed during each visit are detailed in the table below.

A number of techniques will be employed i n this study and they are described in the detail below.  
 
I. OGTT :  After obtaining [ADDRESS_455577] 75 g of glucose. Blood is obtained q 15 min for 2 h for 
plasma glucose, insulin, C -peptide and FFA conc (34).  
II. Euglycemic Insulin Cla mp (insulin sensitivity test) .  All subjects will receive a 240 min euglycemic insulin ( 80 
mU/m2·min) clamp (36) to increase plasma insulin by ~100 uU/ml.  During the 180 min prior to the insulin clamp, a primed (20 uCi x  
FPG/90) -continuous (0.20 uCi/min) infusion of 3 -3H-glucose is started (37,38).   During the insulin clamp, no glucose is infused until 
the plasma glucose declines to 100 mg/dl, at which level it is maintained.  During the baseline/insulin clamp periods continu ous 
indirect calorimetry is per formed (39,40) to quantitate rates of glucose/lipid oxidation, and blood samples are obtained q [ADDRESS_455578] (38,39).    Data Analysis . Under 
steady state posta bsorptive conditions, the rate of endogenous glucose appearance (Ra) = 3 -3H-glucose inf rate (DPM/min) ÷ 
steady state plasma glucose sp act (DPM/mg).  During the insulin clamp, non -steady conditions prevail and Ra is calculated from 
Steele’s equation.  End ogenous (primarily hepatic) glucose production = Ra minus exogenous glucose inf rate.  Total glucose 
disposal (TGD) = EGP + exogenous glucose inf rate.  Glucose and lipid oxidation are determined from NPRQ using standard 
equations (38,39).  TGD - glucose o xid = non -oxidative glucose disposal, which agrees closely with muscle glycogen synthesis 
determined by 13C NMR (41).  
III. Vastus Lateralis Muscle Biopsy .  Percutaneous biopsy of the vastus lateralis muscle (~200 -250 mg) is 
performed 60 min before and /or 240 min after start of insulin (42 -44).  Muscle biopsy samples are immediately frozen in liquid 
nitrogen and stored at –80˚C for analysis.  The baseline ( -60 min) biopsy is used to examine insulin signaling events (IR and IRS -1 
PY/protein content; assoc of  p85/PI -3 K activity with IRS -1, total PI -3 K activity) as previously described (43 -45).  In time course 
studies, we have shown that IRS -1 PY, PI -3 K activity and p85/PI -3 K activity assoc with IRS -1 are maximally stimulated at 30 min.  
The following measu rements will be performed on the baseline ( -60 min) and  240 min biopsies:  (i) PDH activity (glycolytic 
enzyme), citrate synthase (TCA cycle), beta -HAD (beta oxidation enzyme), cytochrome c oxidase (oxidative enzyme), glycogen 
synthase (glycogenic enzyme).   Details of these assays have previously been published (43,44,46 -49); (ii) UDP -N-
acetylglucosamine (UDP -GlcNAc) and glutamine: fructose -6-amido transferase using previously published methods (50,51); (iii) 
gene expression using DNA microarrays (Affymetri x) (42); (iv) malonyl CoA content measured with a radioactive method using fatty 
acid synthase (30); (v)  IKK/IkB/NF -kB signaling by [CONTACT_364715] -kB DNA binding activity (52,53) and IkB  protein by [CONTACT_364716].  Changes in NF -kB binding correlate inversely with IkB  protein content (52,54); (vi) p38 MAPK and JNK will be quantitated 
by [CONTACT_183088] (24,26); (vii) ex vivo  measurement of mitochondrial function using confocal l aser microscopy (see below). 
The following measurements will be made only on the -60 min muscle biopsy :  (i) FACoA and DAG content (see below); (ii) 
mitochondrial DNA content using Q -RT-PCR (55).  
IV.  Microarray Analysis .  Muscle biopsy specimens are homog enized directly in RNAStat solution and RNA pellets are 
stored in ethanol/sodium chloride solution at –80oC.  Prior to use, total RNA is purified with RNeasy and DNase I treatment 
(Qiagen).  For microarray analysis (42), RNA is prepared for hybridization t o Affymetrix HG -U133A arrays according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions (see detailed description in ref 42 and 56).   
V.  Quantitative TaqMan RT -PCR .  Muscle expression of genes of interest (PGC -1, NRF -1, genes coding for 
mitochondrial energy metabolism  [glycolytic/TCA cycle genes, mitochondrial respi[INVESTIGATOR_35226], etc]) that are found to be 
down/upregulated with microarray analysis will be quantitated using one -step Q -RT-PCR from the same total RNA used for 
microarray analysis (42,56).  All gene expressi on/Q -RT-PCR measurements will be performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Christopher Jenkinson (Assoc 
Prof, Diabetes Div; Director, Core Molecular Genetics Laboratory [CMGL]) who has performed all mRNA expression/PCR 
measurements described in previous publications from our lab.  The CMGL is housed within Diabetes Division.  
 VI.  Intramyocellular Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]:  FACoAs and Diacylglycerol .   Muscle LC -FACoA levels will be quantitated by [CONTACT_364717] (Yale Med Sch, New Haven, CT) using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (57,58).  Muscle diacylglycerol 
levels are determined as described by [CONTACT_364718] (59).  Following lipid extraction with chloroform: methanol: PBS+0.2% SDS (1:2:0 .8), 
diacylglycerol kinase and [ -32P] ATP (15 uCi/umol cold ATP) are added and reaction is stopped  with chloroform: methanol (2:1). 
Samples are run on thin -layer chromotgraphy plates in chloroform:acetone: methanol:acetic acid:water (100:40:20:20:10) and the 
DAG band is counted.  
 VII.  Ex Vivo  Measurement of Mitochondrial Function .  Mitochondrial funct ion will be examined using confocal optical 
microscopy (63,64).  During mitochondrial respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], energy is liberated to drive ATP synthesis at 3 coupling sites where p rotons 
are pumped out across the mitochondrial inner membrane, generating an electroche mical gradient of protons ( H*) or equivalently, 
a protonmotive force ( p = H*/F) (65), which drives ATP synthesis.  p is comprised of two components: membrane potential ( ) 
and pH gradient ( pH) and p =  - 60pH (65,66).  Using laser confocal micr oscopy, both  and pH of mitochondria in tissue 
culture, myocytes and muscle tissue (63 -67) can be measured.  For observation of m, muscle tissue ( -60 and 240 min biopsies) is 
placed in DMEM culture medium with tetramethylrhodamine ester (TMRE; 500 nM,  30 min, 37oC), which accumulates into polarized 
mitochondria in response to m (68) (see preliminary data).  Measurement of pH also is of great interest.  Cytosolic pH (pH i) is 
monitored using BCECF ratio imaging, as previously described (69,70), while mitochondrial pH (pH m) is monitored using Carboy -
SNARF -1-AM (20 M, 2 h, 4oC). Tissue is loaded with either BCECF or Carboxy -SNARF -1-AM and incubated for [ADDRESS_455579] labeled mitoc hondria.  
VIII.  Beta Cell Function .  Glucose and insulin areas under OGTT curve (AUC) are calculated by [CONTACT_364719].  Insulin 
secretion rate (ISR) is obtained by [CONTACT_364720] C -peptide curve (71).  Insulin resistance (IR) is determined wit h the 
insulin clamp.  The insulin secretion/insulin resistance index or “disposition index” ([ ISR  G]/IR) (35) provides a physiologically 
relevant measure of beta cell function (72).

resistin, IL -6, IL-1, TNF, leptin, and PAI -1 (73 -75). 
 
Limitations, Interpretive Problems, Expected Results:   Based upon studies performed in diabetic rats, dogs, and humans, we 
expect dapaglifozin to inhibit renal tub ular glucose transport, induce glucosuria, and cause sustained reduction in plasma glucose.  
As plasma glucose decreases to near normal values, glucosuria will diminish but we anticipate that improved glycemic control will 
persist because: (i) basal HGP is  reduced (in diabetic animals, chronic hyperglycemia upregulates hepatic G -6-phosphatase and 
restoration of normoglycemia decreases G -6-phosphatase) (76); (ii) post -prandial glucosuria limits the rise in plasma glucose.  
Reduced mean day -long glucose will be documented by [CONTACT_104940] 24 h blood glucose monitoring (CGMS).  We do not expect 
significant changes in body weight/composition (DEXA) during the short two week study duration.  Weight will be monitored and , if 
necessary, caloric intake adjusted to main tain weight constant.  If the glucotoxicity hypothesis is correct, dapaglifozin should 
enhance peripheral (muscle) and hepatic insulin sensitivity.  From muscle biopsy, we will define whether improved insulin sen sitivity 
results from enhanced glucose trans port/phosphorylation or increased insulin signaling.  If “glucotoxicity” exerts its deleterious 
effects through “lipotoxicity” (i.e., increased malonyl CoA, inhibition of CPT I, increased muscle FACoA), we expect to obser ve 
decreased muscle FACoA/malonyl C oA levels.  If “glucotoxicity” is mediated, in part, via increased hexosamine flux, we expect 
decreased muscle UDG -GlcNAc and GFAT activity.  Based upon animal studies (8,17), we hypothesize that diminished 
hexosamine flux (or some other, as of yet, undefi ned mechanism) will lead to improved mitochondrial function (31P-NMR, enzyme 
activities, TMRE)/gene expression (microarray analysis, PCR). To the extent that glucotoxicity contributes to beta cell dysfu nction 
(1-6), we hypothesize that reduced day -long gly cemia will enhance insulin secretion ( ISR/GIR index).   
 
 
Data Analysis/Sample Size Calculation.  
Data will be analyzed using a two -way ANOVA for repeated measurements.  Before and after is a 
repeated -measurements factor and treatment (dapagliflozin) is a between group factor.  The 
interaction, that is, how the differences between before and after vary by [CONTACT_364721].  
Comparisons of these differences among treatments following the ANOVA will use a multiple 
comparison test.

cotransporter -2 (SGLT2) inhibitors) may lead to ketoacidosis, a serious condition where the body produces high levels of blood 
acids called ketones that may require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. You should pay close attention for any signs of ketoacidosis and seek 
medical attention i mmediately if you experience symptoms such as difficulty breathing, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, 
confusion, and unusual fatigue or sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]. Do not stop or change your diabetes medicines without first talking to your 
prescriber. Your doctor will eva luate for the presence of acidosis, including ketoacidosis, if you are experiencing these signs or 
symptoms; discontinue SGLT2 inhibitors if acidosis is confirmed; and take appropriate measures to correct the acidosis and 
monitor sugar levels.

7.  Safety Precautions.  (Describe safeguards to address the serious risks listed abov e.) 
a.  Describe the procedures for protecting against or minimizing any potent ial risks  for each of the more than minimal risk 
research procedures  listed above.  
 
Risks will be minimized by a careful screening process including medical history, physical exam, and review of complete blood  
count, coagulation tests, chemistry and elec trocardiogram.  The presence of experienced personnel, and of at least one 
physician, at all times is also critical to reducing risks.  
 
Insulin Clamp:  Plasma glucose concentration will be determined at 5 minute intervals throughout the period of insulin/g lucose 
administration.  The 20% dextrose infusion will be adjusted in order to maintain euglycemia (100 mg/dl) and to avoid 
hypoglycemia.  
 
Muscle biopsies:  To avoid local hematoma formation, pressure is applied for 30 min after the biopsy.  To avoid infec tion, the 
procedure is performed under sterile conditions.  Our group has experience with over 1000 biopsies.  
 
Blood loss:  the total amount of blood drawn will be about [ADDRESS_455586].  The subjects will be told that they should not 
donate blood for t wo months after the study.  Any subjects with a hematocrit of less than 35% will not be studied.  
 
Radiation Exposure:  Radiation exposure is within acceptable guidelines established by [CONTACT_364722].  
Subjects will be questioned about prio r radiation exposure and they will be told that they should not participate in any study 
involving radiation exposure for at least one year.  
 
Potential Side Effects of Dapagliflozin:  Subjects who experience a hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_364696].  Subjects who experience an elevated plasma creatine, creatine kinase, AST, ALT, total bilirubin or reduced plasma 
sodium (see section 6d) they will be followed until the abnormal lab value resolves.  
 
b.  Where appropriate, discuss pr ovisions for ensuring necessary medical or professional intervention in the event of adverse 
events, or unanticipated problems involving subjects.  
Any expected or unexpected adverse events will be assessed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. DeFronzo or a co -investigator.  Any necess ary immediate 
medical care will be arranged in conjunction with the subject’s wishes.  
c.  Will the safeguards be different between/among groups?   
 
 Yes

a.  Describe the incentives (e.g., inducements) being offered to subjects for their time during participation in the r esearch study.  
There are no inducements.  
b.  If monetary compensation is offered, indicate how much the subjects will be paid and describe the terms and schedule of 
payment.   
IRB policy requires a provision for providing partial payment to subjects who withdraw before t he completion of the research. For  
VA research, payment to human subjects participating in research is prohibited when the research is integrated with the 
patient’s medical care and when the research makes no special demands on the patient  beyond those of standard medical care.  
Payment may be permitted, with IRB approval, under certain circumstances.  Consult with the VA  R&D Office to discuss  
paym ent of subjects . 
As reimbursement for time and travel expenses, subjects will receive $40 for  the study qualification visit, $[ADDRESS_455587] and $ 250 for each insulin sensitivity  (clamp)  test.    Subjects will receive $[ADDRESS_455588], or 
the radioactive glucose studies while on the BRU, they will receive $[ADDRESS_455589] 
completed.  Subjects also will receive $ [ADDRESS_455590] to pay 
anything for tests that are done as part of their participation in the study.  If subjects complete the entire study, they wi ll receive 
$1090 .

a.  Describe any costs for care associated with research (including a breakdown of standard of care procedures versus research 
procedures), costs of test drugs or devices, and research procedure costs that are the subject’s respons ibility as a consequence 
of participating in the research.  
No cost to subjects.  
b.  Describe any offer for reimbursement of costs by [CONTACT_170400].  (Attach a copy of the section  
of the clinical trial agreement or contract describing research related injury care – the information in this section must match the 
injury section of the consent form ). 
If subjects are a Veteran and in the event that they sustain an injury or illness as a result of their participation in this VA 
approved research study, all medical treatment (emergency as well as medical treatment beyond emergency care) will be 
provided by [CONTACT_41309].  Subjects  will be treated for the injury at no  cost to the subject .  However, no additional compensation has 
been set a side.  Subjects  have not waived any legal rights or released the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_364697].  
 
In the event of a research related injury or if subjects experience an adverse reaction, they should  immediately co ntact the study 
doctor at telephone number listed on page [ADDRESS_455591] the study doctor so that the VA can coordinate care with the private hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].

06-247H, DeFronzo, Form C, [ADDRESS_455593] / Project Summary  
                
 
Provide a succinct and accurate description of the proposed research. State the purpose/aims . Describe concisely the research 
design and methods for achieving the stated goals. This section should be understandable to all members of the IRB, scientifi c and 
non-scientific.  This summary will also be needed in future IRB Progress Reports.   
DO NOT EXCEED THE SPACE PROVIDED . 
Purpose/Objectives:  To examine the effect of a chronic decrease in plasma glucose in T2DM subjects using dapagliflozin on in sulin 
sensitivity/signaling, mitochondrial function, oral glucose tolerance, and beta cell function.  
 
Research Design/Plan :  Screen approximately 75 subjects in order to obtain  30 completers that  will receive an OGTT and 
euglycemic insulin clamp with vastus lateralis muscle biopsies and then be randomized to dapagliflozin (n=20) or placebo (n=1 0).  
After  2-3 weeks the OGTT and euglycemic insulin clamp will be repeated.   [A large attrition rate is expected due to the complexity of 
the protocol and the inclusion/exclusion criteria.]  
 
Methods:  (1) 2 -hour oral glucose (75 grams) tolerance test with measureme nt of plasma insulin/C -peptide concentrations; (2) 4 -hour 
euglycemic insulin clamp with tritiated glucose, vastus lateralis muscle biopsies ( -60 and 240 minutes), and indirect calorimetry; (3) 
DEXA for percent body fat; (4) 3 -3H-glucose turnover before and  after starting dapagliflozin to quantitate hepatic glucose production; 
(5) measurement of insulin signaling (IR/IRS -1 tyrosine phosphorylation and PI -3 kinase activity), mitochondrial function (confocal 
microscopy), and gene expression (Affymetrix) on mus cle biopsies.  
 
Clinical Relevance:  Knowledge of how hyperglycemia affects insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity is essential to underst anding the 
pathogenesis of T2DM. Such knowledge will lead to improved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] f or the treatment of patients with T 2DM.

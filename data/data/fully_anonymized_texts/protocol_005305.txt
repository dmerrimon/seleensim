(CNEPi [INVESTIGATOR_109864] m #2 )  Version 6.[ADDRESS_121908]. Naveen Pereira   CONFIDENTIAL  1 Introduction  
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study will be carried out in 
accordance with the applicable  [LOCATION_002]  government regulations and Mayo Clinic research 
policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background  
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction ( HFpEF ) can result from abnormalities in the 
process of active relaxation and pa ssive stiffness of the heart1. The natriuretic peptides ( NPs) 
play an important role in cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) mediated inhibition of  
cardiomyocyte growth, smooth muscle and fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition that  
can affect passive stiffness2-4. Further, NPs can attenuate angiotensin -II, endothelin -1 and 
arginine -vasopressin induced increased proliferation of vascular smo oth mus cle cells5. HFpEF 
is characterized by [CONTACT_109879] -cardiac pressures6 and the natriuretic and diuretic properties 
of NPs play a pi[INVESTIGATOR_109867] n ormal volume homeostasis7, 8. Natriuretic peptides 
also reduce peripheral vascular r esistance and blood pressure9. The NPs additionally inhibit the 
effects of the renin -angiotensin -aldosterone and s ympathetic nervous system10-13 the 
maladaptive activation of which results in the clinical syndrome of HF.  Neprilysin ( NEP) 
mediates the anti -fibrotic, anti -proliferative, myocardial relaxation, vasodilator and diuretic 
properties of NPs by [CONTACT_109880]. NPs are degraded and cleared by [CONTACT_109881] (NPRC) respectively. NEP inhibition  (NEPi)  therefore results in  
significant increases in plasma BNP, urinary BNP and urinary sodium, increases in cardiac 
output and reduction in int ra-cardiac filling pressures14.  
1.2 Preliminary Data  
Entresto™, a crystalline complex of a NEPi (sacubitril) and an angiotensin receptor bloc ker 
(ARB, valsartan), was recently approved to treat NYHA Class 2 -4 patients with HFrEF after the 
PARADIGM -HF trial was stopped early due to an overwhelming benefit of the drug in reducing 
all-cause mortality ( hazard ratio [HR]:  0.84; p<0.001), CV mortality (HR 0.80; p<0.001), 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10889] (HR 0.79; p<0.001) and in addition reduced the symptoms and physical 
limitations of HF by 21% (p=0.001)15. Entresto™ due to its additional NEPi [INVESTIGATOR_109868] a 
promising new thera py for HFpEF. Entresto™ when administered to patients with HFpEF in a 
phase 2 study resulted in significantly reduced NT -proBNP levels, a surrogate marker of LV wall 
stress and NEP activity, as compared to being treated with valsartan alone16. Entresto™ 
therefore is being tested as treatment for HFpEF in a Phase 3 trial, PARAGON -HF, evaluating 
its efficacy in reducing CV death and HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_109869].  
 
NEP is a cell membrane bound metalloendopeptidase and can be released from the ce ll 
surface, resulting in the formation of a circulating peptide that maintains its catalytic activity17, 18. 
In recent clinical studies, circulating NEP levels were significantly associated with the composite 
endpoint of cardiovascular death or HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11298] ( HR 1.17; p=0.001) and cardiovascular 
death (HR: 1.19; p=0.002) in patients with HF19. The PARAGON -HF trial includes all -comers 
with HFpEF; the final data collection will be completed May 2019. It is being increasingly 
recognized that HFpEF is a di sease entity that has considera ble phenotypic heterogeneity20, 21. 
Therefore, targeting all -comers who suffer from a heterogeneous disease process using a single 
treatment intervention may not result in desirable outcomes as has been evident with multiple 
prior negat ive HFpEF trials22, 23. The importance of biomarker based clinical trials that deliver the 
right drug to the right patient is being increasingly recognized as a useful strategy to limit 
sample size and decrease costs by [CONTACT_109882] h potent ial responders24, 25. Whether 
the beneficial effects of Entresto™ therapy are dependent on baseline NEP levels is unknown 
and is being explored in this study . The hypothesis  in this proof of concept study is that 
(CNEPi [INVESTIGATOR_109864] m #2 )  Version 6.[ADDRESS_121909] an equivalent response to Entresto™, a NEPi, as 
compared to those with higher NEP levels. The primary endpoint  measured is change in 
biomarkers with Entresto™ administration that reflect NEP activity and myocardial stress (NT 
pro-ANP, -BNP, -CNP)  and drug action (cGMP). This endpoint has been well validated as a 
measure of Entresto™ drug response26. 
 
To establish a median value which will be used to categorize subjects recruited for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_109870] a low and high NEP group we have measured circulating NEP levels in 242 samples 
from the RELAX  and NEAT -HFpEF  studies. The RELAX study  was a multicent er, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled, randomized clinical trial of 216 stable outpatients with HFpEF27. NEAT -
HFpEF  was a multicent er, randomized study of 110  outpatients with HFpEF28. The  median 
circulating NEP level in these populations was 1 .55 ng/ml (Q1=0.49, Q3=24.99).  Therefore 
subjects with circulating NEP levels of ≤1.55 ng/ml will be considered as having low NEP levels 
and those with values >1.55 ng/ml will fall into the high NEP level group.  
 
1.3 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
The effect of administering Entresto™ to subjects with “high” or “low” NEP levels will be studied. 
Favorable response to Entresto™ therapy in these subjects will be assessed by [CONTACT_56620] a 
change in biomarkers that reflect NEP activity, myoc ardial wall stress and clinical outcomes 
(NT-proANP, NT -proBNP, NT -proCNP)[ADDRESS_121910] efficacy of drug action (cGMP)26. Entresto 
is FDA approved for use in HFrEF and will be administered as recommended in the drug 
labeling information as an off label us e in HFpEF as 49/51 mg twice -daily.

Human Services (HHS) regulations at 21 CFR parts 50, 56, and 312.  
 
7.1 Summary of the Risks and Benefits  
 
Blood draws:  The risks of drawing blood include bleeding at the puncture site, bruisi ng and 
pain.  These occur in a very small portion of the population.  
 
Entresto™ (sacubitril/valsartan):  The use of Entresto™  compared to the guideline -indicated 
ACE inhibitor enalapril reduced mortality was shown in the PARADIGM trial to reduce the 
hazard  ratio for cardiovascular death and mortality by 20%. The known risks of Entresto™  
overlap with those of valsartan , a drug that has been used in patients with HFpEF . In the 
PARADIGM trial,  use of Entresto™  was associated with a greater incidence of a ngioedema 
than the comparator  drug enalapril (0.5% vs. 0.2%). The risk of angioedema with Entresto™  
compared to enalapril was  relatively greater among Black patients (2.4% vs. 0.5%). Patients 
with a history of angioedema  are contraindicated from taking this drug. Trial data indicate 
adverse reactions occurring ≥5%  are hypotension, hyperkalemia, cough, dizziness, and renal 
failure. Symptomatic hypotension in  PARAGON was more common among patients taking 
Entresto™  than enalapril (18% vs. 12%).  
 
Subjects will  be given appropriate instructions to monitor for any untoward effects and to report 
immediately  and seek medical attention  if required . Also, a study team member will be following -
up with the subjects on a timely basis as described above to monit or compliance and to assess 
tolerance, Hence, the study has extremely little risk of causing irreversible consequence on the 
patients.   
 
Plan of intervention in the event of adverse effects to the subjects  During the course of the 
treatment , if the patient does develop angioedema, or signs  or symptoms of hypotension,  or any 
(CNEPi [INVESTIGATOR_109864] m #2 )  Version 6.[ADDRESS_121929] policies and procedure s. 
 
Other potent ial risk s include : 
This protocol may be hazardous to an unborn child . When pregnancy is detected, EntrestoTM 
will be discontinue d as soon as possible. Drugs that act directly on the renin -angiotensin system 
such as EntrestoTM can cause injury an d death to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103] . Therefore, female 
participants must be postmenopausal or have been surgically sterilized or have a negative 
pregnancy test and must agree to use a reliable method of contraception until study completion. 
Methods of contraception inclu de: birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]/implants/injections, intrauterine devices, 
spermicide, diaphragm or condoms.

8 Participant Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Institutional Review Boards  
All sites will submit the study protocol, informed consent form, and other study documents to 
their IRB for approval —the approv al letter for each clinical center will be stored. Any 
amendments to the protocol, other than minor administrative changes, must be approved by 
[CONTACT_109889].  
8.2 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
a subject whether or not considered drug or biologic related. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
pharmaceutical product or b iologic.  
8.3 Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the event. “Reasonable possibility” suggests there is a causal 
relationship between the drug and t he adverse event. “Suspected adverse reaction” implies a 
lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse 
event caused by a drug.  
(CNEPi [INVESTIGATOR_109864] m #2 )  Version 6.[ADDRESS_121934]. Naveen Pereira   CONFIDENTIAL  8.4 Serious Adverse Events  
An AE or SAR is considered serious if the Investigator or sp onsor believes any of the following 
outcomes may occur:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening AE: Places the subject at immediate risk of death at the time of the 
event as it occurred. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caus ed death.  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318].  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse event when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of  the outcomes listed in this definition above.  
This determination is based on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_109873] (e.g., if either 
believes it is serious, it must be considered serious).  
8.[ADDRESS_121935] abnor malities that meet the definition of a serious adverse event (SAE), 
which required the subject to have the study drug  discontinued or interrupted, or required the 
subject to received specific corrective therapy, the clinical diagnosis rather than the labor atory 
term will be used by [CONTACT_9673] (e.g., anemia versus low hemoglobin value).  
8.[ADDRESS_121936] assess the relationship of any AE to the use of study 
drug, based on av ailable information, using the following guidelines:  
• Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship to the investigational product 
and the adverse event.  
• Unlikely related:  No temporal association or the cause of the event has been identified, 
or the drug or biologic cannot be implicated.  
• Possibly related:  There is reasonable evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and adverse event.  
• Related:  There is evid ence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely.  
 
The determination of adverse event severity rests on medical judgment of a medically -qualified 
Investigator. The severity of AEs will be graded using the following defi nitions:  
• Mild:  Awareness of sign, symptom, or event, but easily tolerated;  
• Moderate:  Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity and may warrant 
intervention;  
• Severe:  Incapacitating with inability to do usual activities or significantly affects clinical 
status, and warrants intervention.  
8.7 Expectedness  
The expectedness of a n AE or SAR shall be determined according to the specified reference 
document containing safety information (e.g., most current product label). Any AE that is not 
identified in nature, severity, or specificity in the current study drug reference document(s ) is 
considered unexpected. Events that are mentioned in the product label as occurring with a class 
(CNEPi [INVESTIGATOR_109864] m #2 )  Version 6.[ADDRESS_121937] in patients with HFpEF  taking EntrestoTM: 
• Arrhythmias: This re fers to both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.  
• Acute coronary syndrome: This refers to unstable angina, non ST segment elevation 
myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and ST segment elevation myocardial (STEMI).  
• Unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], ER visit or clinic vi sit for worsening HF: This refers to 
treatment for acute heart failure such as receiving intravenous diuretics.  
• Cerebrovascular event: This refers to cerebrovascular accidents (stroke) of any cause 
(hemorrhagic, ischemic, or embolic) and transient ischemic  attack (TIA).  
• Venous thromboembolism: This includes both deep venous thrombosis and 
pulmonary embolus.  
• Worsening renal function: This refers to acute kidney injury, typi[INVESTIGATOR_109874] ≥ 20% over 48 hours, or progressive loss of renal function over time.  
• LVAD implantation: This refers to implantation of a temporary or durable LVAD.  
• Cardiac Transplantation  
• Hyperkalemia > 6 mEq/L  
• Acute renal failure with serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL  
• Angioedema  
• Symptomatic hypotension  
Anticipated dis ease related events will not be captured as AEs/SAEs during the study, but will 
be entered on the appropriate case report form (“Events of Interest” page).

• Date of Resolution  
 
8.2.[ADDRESS_121940] follow -up 
information according to the same process used for reporting the ini tial event as described 
above. The Investigator will follow all reportable events until resolution, stabilization or the event 
is otherwise explained. Investigators are also responsible for promptly reporting AEs to their 
reviewing IRB/EC in accordance wit h local requirements.  
 
8.2.8  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction  
AEs that meet the criteria of serious, related to study drug, and unexpected for that d rug, qualify 
for expedited reporting to the regulatory authorities. The Site Investigator will assess all SAEs 
occurring at his/her site and evaluate for “unexpectedness” and relationship to study drug. The 
Site Investigator is required to complete and sub mit a voluntary MedWatch Report for the 
events identified as serious, study drug related and unexpected at:  
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/ . A copy of this report should be kept at the 
site and also forwarded to the overall  study PI  [INVESTIGATOR_109875].

recorded on the appropriate pregnancy form. The pregnancy will be followed until final outcome. 
Any associated AEs or SAEs that occur to the mother or fetus/child wil l be recor ded in the AE or 
SAE CRF.  
8.9 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_109876].  
8.10 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16462]/her 
site.  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of 
adverse events as noted above, as well as the construction and implementation of a site data 
and safety -monitoring plan.  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessme nt of the number 
and type of serious adverse events.   After informal discussions with IRB staff in the midst of the study, 
given that 1. This was not a Phase 1,2,,[ADDRESS_121942] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those 
regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
(CNEPi [INVESTIGATOR_109864] m #2 )  Version 6.[ADDRESS_121943]. Naveen Pereira   CONFIDENTIAL  • Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes a uthorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject 
authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts 
should  be made to obtain permission to coll ect at least vital status (long term survival status that 
the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
9.2 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observa tions, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source 
data are contained in source documents.  Examples of these original documents, and data 
records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and off ice charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, 
subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from 
automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_16213], microfiches, p hotographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject 
files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico -technical 
departments involved in the clinical trial.  
9.3 Case Report Forms  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All 
data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space 
on the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, 
write “N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be 
printed legibly in black ink.  If any entry error has been made, to correct such an error, draw a 
single straight line through the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it.  All such 
changes must be initialed and dated.  Do not erase or use “white -out” for errors.   For 
clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial and 
date it.   If the reason for the correction is not clear or needs additional explanation, neatly 
include the details to justify the correction.  Study CRF components will include an enrollment 
and demographics form; forms for recording relevant history, HF symptoms,  physical exam 
results, laboratory results, and other baseline presenting characteristics; follow -up forms for use 
during regular follow -up visits; forms to track the participant’s clinical course over time; and 
event forms for recording the circumstances and details surrounding the occurrence of a death 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
9.4 Data Quality Control  
Prior to the start of enrollment, the Investigators and Study Coordinators will be trained on the 
clinical protocol and data collection procedures. Personnel at the  clinical sites will enter the data 
mandated by [CONTACT_109890]. The data will be extracted from the participant’s 
medical charts and other source documents. All CRFs will be completed according to the 
current Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidel ines. Follow -up training and training for new study 
personnel will be conducted as needed.  
 
9.5 Data Security  
Access to databases will be controlled centrally through user passwords linked to appropriate 
privileges. This protects the data from unauthorized changes and inadvertent loss or damage. 
Database and web servers will be secured by a firewall and through co ntrolled physical access. 
(CNEPi [INVESTIGATOR_109864] m #2 )  Version 6.[ADDRESS_121944] the objectivity of study data. For 
this reason, In vestigators will be prohibited from performing subset analyses at any point prior to 
the conclusion of the study, and any data, other than safety data, cannot be used for publication 
or reporting outside of this study until the study is completed .  
 
10 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
10.1 Study Monitoring Plan  
The investigator will allocate adequate time for s uch monitoring activities. The i nvestigator will 
also ensure that the monitor or other compliance or quality assurance reviewer is given access 
to all the study -related documents and study related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic 
laboratory, etc.), and has adequate space to conduct the monitoring visit.  
10.2 Auditing and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1201], and 
government regulatory agencies, of a ll study related documents (e.g. source documents, 
regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.). The investigator will ensure 
the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic 
laboratory, etc.).Participation as an investigator in this study implies  acceptance of potential 
inspection by [CONTACT_109891].  
[ADDRESS_121945] operating procedures. These procedures are designed to ensure adherence to Good 
Clinical Practice, as described in the following documents:  
1. ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice 1996.  
2. US 21 Code of Federal Regulations dealing with clinical studies (including parts 50 and 
56 concerning informed consent and IRB regulations).  
3. Declaration of Helsinki, concerning medical research in humans (Recommendations 
Guiding Physicians in Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects, Helsinki 1964, 
amended Tokyo 1975, Venice 1983, Hong Kong 1989, Somerset West 1996).  
By [CONTACT_12142], the investigator agrees to adhere to the instructions and procedures 
described in it and thereby [CONTACT_109892] w hich it 
conforms.  
11.[ADDRESS_121946]/Independent Ethics Committee  
Before implementing this study, the protocol, the proposed informed consent form and other 
information to subjects, must be reviewed by a properly constituted Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC). A signed and dated statement that the protocol 
and informed consent have been approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC must be provided to the CC before 
study initiation. The name [CONTACT_109896]/IEC 
(CNEPi [INVESTIGATOR_109864] m #2 )  Version 6.[ADDRESS_121947] be supplied to the CC if this information is released by [CONTACT_1744]/IEC. Any amendments to the 
protocol, other than administrative ones, must be approved by [CONTACT_91736].  
11.[ADDRESS_121948] (or legally authorized representative) 
the nature of the study, its purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, the 
potential risks and benefits involved and any discomfort it may entail. Each subject must be 
informed that participation in the study is voluntary and that he/she may withdraw from the study 
at any time and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her subsequent medical treatment 
or relationship with the treating physician.  
 
This informed consen t should be given by [CONTACT_3553] a standard written statement, written in 
non-technical language. The subject should read and consider the statement before signing and 
dating it, and should be given a copy of the signed document. If written consent is not pos sible, 
oral consent can be obtained if witnessed by a signed statement from one or more persons not 
involved in the study, mentioning why the patient was unable to sign the form. No patient can 
enter the study before his/her informed consent has been obtai ned. The informed consent forms 
are part of the protocol, and must be submitted by [CONTACT_89433]/IEC approval. 
The CC will supply proposed informed consent forms, which comply with regulatory 
requirements, and are considered appropriate for the study. Any changes to the proposed 
consent form suggested by [CONTACT_109893]/IEC, and a copy of the approved version must be provided to the CC after IRB/IEC 
approval.

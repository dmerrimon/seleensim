Study Title 
A Phase 2, Randomized, Double- Blind, Placebo Controlled, Do se Range Finding Study to 
Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Intramuscula r Injection of Human Placenta-Derived Cells 
(PDA-002) in Subjects With Di abetic Peripheral Neuropathy  
Indication 
This study will investigate the efficacy and safety  of intramuscular (IM) injections of PDA-[ADDRESS_989429] diabetic pe ripheral neuropathy (DPN) as a co -morbidity of Type 2 diabetes.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study is to assess  the efficacy of PDA-002 versus placebo in 
subjects with DPN, based on the change from ba seline in epi[INVESTIGATOR_724849] 6 months.  
The secondary objective of the study is to assess the safety and to lerability of IM administration 
of 2 different doses of PDA-002 or  placebo in subjects with DPN. 
The key exploratory objectives of the study are to assess potential trea tment effects of IM 
administration of PDA-002 in subjects with DP N as measured by [CONTACT_162832]: 
 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_724849] 3 months 
 Lower limb microvascular oxygenation  
 Vascular reactivity  
 DPN signs and symptoms 
 Motor and sensory nerve conduction and autonomic function 
 Health-related quality of life 
 Vascular and immune, biomarke rs, and laboratory parameters 
 Assessment of the systemic versus local efficacy of PDA-[ADDRESS_989430] acebo-controlled, dose range finding study in 
subjects with DPN.  The study will enroll approximately 24 subjects. Subjects will be 
randomized to receive one of 3 treatments:  PDA-002 (3 x 106 cells), PDA-002 (30 x 106 cells), 
or placebo (vehicle control) in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_989431] (IP) or 
placebo will be administered monthly (3 admi nistrations total; Study Days 1, 29, and 57).  
Subjects will be evaluated for efficacy and safety for approximately one year from the day of the 
last IP administration.  
Study Population 
The study population includes subjects with Diab etic Peripheral Neur opathy due to Type 2 
diabetes mellitus (DM) as defined by [CONTACT_724887] ( Appendix A ). 
PDA-[ADDRESS_989432]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  Length of Study 
Subjects are expected to participat e in the study from screening (Day  28) to [ADDRESS_989433] 
IP injection.   
Subjects will undergo a Screening Period of up to 28 days. During the Screening Period 
eligibility will be confirmed and baseline assessme nts will be performed. Subjects will then enter 
a 6 month Treatment Period consisting of 8 study visits.  During the Treatment Period, IP will be 
administered on Study Days 1, 29, and 57, and efficacy  and safety evaluations will be performed 
as outlined in the Table of Events ( Table 1 ).  Subjects will then ente r a Follow-up Period.  The 
Follow up Period will consist of bi-monthly study vi sits to continue to assess safety and longer-
term efficacy. 
End of Trial 
The End of Trial is defined as eith er the date of the last visit of the last subject to complete the 
post-treatment follow-up, or the date of receipt of th e last data point from the last subject that is 
required for primary, secondary a nd/or exploratory analysis, as prespecified in the protocol, 
whichever is the later date. 
Study Treatments Subjects will be randomized 1: 1:1 to receive one of the following dose levels of IP:  
 PDA-002 Dose Level 1:  3 x 10
6 PDA-002 cells administered IM on Study Days 1, 
29, and 57.*  
 PDA-002 Dose Level 2:  30 x 106 PDA-002 cells administered IM on Study Days 1, 
29, and 57.* 
 Placebo (vehicle cont rol) subjects will receive placebo (vehicle control) administered 
in the same manner and at the same time points as the PDA-002 dosing groups. 
*Subjects will be dosed in the same leg.  The leg of injection will be the leg with the 
lowest combined qualifying NTSS-[ADDRESS_989434] is at the 
discretion of the investigator.  
PDA-002 and placebo (vehicle control) units will be  shipped to the study sites as cryopreserved 
units and will be thawed and filled into  syringes prior to IM injection. 
Overview of Key Efficacy Assessments 
The following efficacy assessments will be perf ormed as outlined in the Table of Events 
(Table 1 ). 
The primary efficacy assessment is the evaluation of change from baseline in Epi[INVESTIGATOR_724850] (ENFD) at 6 months. 
Efficacy will also be assessed in an explorator y manner by [CONTACT_724888]: 
 ENFD at 3 months 
 Microvascular oxygenation of  the lower limbs by [CONTACT_724889] (HSI) 
PDA-[ADDRESS_989435]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015   Vascular reactivity by [CONTACT_724890].  
 The 6-item Neuropathy Total Symp tom Score (NTSS-6) assessment 
 The Neurological Impairment Scor e of the Lower Limb (NIS-LL) 
 The Utah Early Neuropathy Scale (UENS) 
Additional efficacy signals indicating changes in motor and sensory nerve conduction and 
autonomic function as evaluated by: 
 Nerve conduction studies  
 Quantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Testi ng (QSART).  QSART is a measurement 
of autonomic involvement by [CONTACT_724891] r function deficits 
in the foot, distal le g, and distal thigh. 
Changes in health-related quality of life (QOL) will be assessed by [CONTACT_724892]-DN.  
Various experimental biomarker analyses will be  performed to assess changes in the vascular 
and immune profile.  Samples for biomarker analys es will include blood a nd epi[INVESTIGATOR_202253]. In 
addition, an assessment of the systemic vs. lo cal efficacy of PDA-002 will be evaluated.   
Overview of Safety Assessments Safety and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_89852], frequency, and severity of adverse events 
(AEs). As such, the following safety assessments will be performed as outlined in the Table of 
Events ( Table 1 ). 
 Assessment of adverse events and serious adverse events (SAEs) 
 Physical examinations including complete neurological examinati ons and vital signs 
 Clinical laboratory tests including chem istry, hematology, urinalysis, evaluation; 
urine pregnancy testing if applicable 
 Twelve-lead electrocardiogram (ECGs) 
 Retinal assessments  
 Concomitant medications and procedures 
 Immunological assessments  
 Anti-human leukocyte antig en (HLA) antibodies 
Sample Size and Power Considerations 
The sample size of [ADDRESS_989436] of activ e therapy and placebo to plan a 
sample size for the next study. 
Based upon a previous study ( Jacobs, 2011 ), the mean ENFD was 1.56 fibers/mm at baseline and 
3.07 fibers/mm after [ADDRESS_989437] deviation of 1.5 fibers/mm for the 
mean increase. Assuming the same treatment effect  is observed from baseline, the sample size of 
PDA-[ADDRESS_989438]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  16 subjects actively on therapy resulting from co mbining the 2 active arms has a 96% power to 
detect a similar mean change at [ADDRESS_989439] a change from 
baseline, the study has 60% power to detect si milar differences between placebo and active 
therapy with PDA-002, with a two-sided te st and a Type I error rate set at 0.05. 
Efficacy and Safety Analyses 
The planned efficacy and safety analyses will be  fully described in a comprehensive SAP.  
The efficacy analyses will also include a descript ive assessment of the exploratory objective to 
evaluate whether the treatment effect of PDA-[ADDRESS_989440]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  TABLE OF CONTENTS

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a disease in which hyperglycemia damages the nerves, kidneys, eyes, 
and blood vessels over time. The estimated incide nce of diabetes in th e [LOCATION_002] (US) 
exceeds 1.9 million new cases annually, with an overall prevalence of over 25 million people or 
8.3% of the US population ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011 ).  Type 2 DM 
(adult onset or non-insulin depende nt diabetes) is by [CONTACT_724893], occurring in 
about 95% of subjects diagnosed with diabetes . Diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) is the most 
common complication of DM.  It develops  on a background of long standing, chronic 
hyperglycemia, associated metabolic derangeme nts, and cardiovascul ar risk factors. 
Although the underlying mechanis ms of DPN remain unclear, central features in the 
development and progression of DPN are neural  cell degeneration and decreased nerve blood 
flow, and are usually associated with both axona l degeneration and demye lination.  This results 
in spontaneous pain (burning pain, electrical or  stabbing sensations, deep aching pain, etc.), 
hyperalgesia, and diminished sensation which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_724851].  
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_724852] N are currently limited to pain relief (tricyclic antidepressants, 
serotonin norepi[INVESTIGATOR_724853], anti convulsants, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and non-prescription 
analgesics).  There are currently no treatment s approved to treat the underlying disease.  
Human placenta-derived cells (PDA-002) are characterized as  a cellular immune modulating 
agent that has the potential to induce angiogenesis. PDA- 002 is a mesenchymal-like cell 
population derived from normal, full-term human placental tissue.  PDA-002 is culture-expanded 
as a plastic-adherent, undiffere ntiated in vitro cell populati on that expresses the nominal 
phenotype CD34-, CD10+, CD105+ and CD200+.  PDA-002 cells constitutively express 
moderate levels of human leukocyte antigen (H LA) Class I and undetectable levels of HLA 
Class II, and they do not expr ess the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86.  PDA-[ADDRESS_989452] oid chromosome count, normal karyotype, and 
exhibits normal senescence after prolonged in vitro culture. 
Similar to mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) ( Aggarwal, 2005; Nauta, 2007 ) in vitro studies 
have shown that PDA-[ADDRESS_989453] s of PDA-002 on cellular components of the neurovascular system 
were tested using a variety of in vitro and in vivo experiment al systems.  The capacity of 
PDA-002 to elaborate angiogenic factors, induce endothelial cell survival/proliferation, induce 
endothelial cell migration, and induce endot helial cell tube form ation was assessed. 
PDA-[ADDRESS_989454]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: [ADDRESS_989455] demonstrated dose 
dependent analgesic effects including pain re duction, suppressed immune  cell infiltration, and 
reduced mechanical sensitivity. The analgesic effects were equivalent to high dose gabapentin. 
Additionally, treatment with PDA-002 in mouse hind limb ischemia models demonstrated 
improvement in blood flow and induced the form ation of new collateral blood vessels suggesting 
angiogenic activity. The effects were comparab le to VEGF controls. Please refer to the 
Investigator’s Brochure for details of these studies.  
PDA-002 is currently being investigated in 3 independent human studies in subjects with 
complications of DM.  The in itial (ongoing) phase 1 open-labe l, dose escalation study (CCT-
PDA-002-DFU-001) is being conducted in [ADDRESS_989456] s with peripheral arte rial disease (PAD) 
with diabetic foot ulceration (D FU) who were refractory to conve ntional therapy.  In this study, 
intramuscular (IM) inje ction of either [ADDRESS_989457] dem onstrated efficacy in the healing or closure 
of the index ulcer within 3 months following the initial dose of PDA-002 in 15 subjects to date. 
Five subjects had complete healing, and 2 subjec ts had approximately 50% healing of their index 
ulcer within [ADDRESS_989458] increases in their peripheral 
circulation as measured by [CONTACT_707890] (ABI). The mean increase in ABI from 
screening to the start of do sing was 0.003. A clinically signi ficant increase in ABI at 3
 months 
was observed following dosing (0.15). PDA-[ADDRESS_989459] DFU with PAD.  Three doses of PDA-002 (3 x 106, 10 
x 106 and 30 x 106 cells) versus placebo will be evaluate d in 2:2:1:[ADDRESS_989460]  DFU with PAD. The study is designed to 
assess the safety of repeated monthly IM admini stration of PDA-002, and to generate the data for 
a clinical proof of m echanism.  The study is investigati ng 3 monthly doses with PDA-002 dose 
levels (3 x 106 or 30 x 106 PDA-002 cells) on Study Days 1, 29, and 57.  Vascular functional 
parameters as well as potential novel biomarkers will be assessed to predict efficacy and to 
characterize the treatment respons e in order to evaluate the pha rmacodynamics of treatment with 
PDA-002.  The study is ongoing, and the data remain blinded. 
To further evaluate the efficacy and safety of PDA-002, this Phase 2, randomized, double blind, 
placebo-controlled study will enroll 24 subjects  with DPN.  The study will employ the same 
doses and dosing schedule of PDA-002 as the aforementioned proof of mechanism study.  The 
primary endpoint of the study is to assess change s in epi[INVESTIGATOR_192102] (ENFD), an 
indicator of small nerve fi ber involvement in DPN ( Jacobs, 2011 ). Symptoms of small fiber 
neuropathy correlate with a decrease in the numbe r, density and length of small nerve fibers in 
the epi[INVESTIGATOR_518684].  Therefore, an in crease in ENFD may in dicate PDA-[ADDRESS_989461]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  fibers (including those responsible for autonomic function) as well as large nerve fibers, various 
neurophysiological tests are requi red to identify dysfunction of different nerve populations.  
Therefore, physiological changes, signs, sy mptoms, and function related to DPN will be 
measured as exploratory endpoints. 
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure fo r detailed information co ncerning the available 
pharmacology, toxicology, drug metabolism, clinical studies, and adverse ev ent (AE) profile of 
PDA-002. 
This study will be conducted in compliance with  the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
guidelines, and applicable  regulatory requirements.

PDA-[ADDRESS_989464]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: [ADDRESS_989465] DPN.  The study will enro ll approximately 24 subj ects. Subjects will be 
randomized to receive one of 3 treatments:  PDA-002 (3 x 106 cells), PDA-002 (30 x 106 cells), 
or placebo (vehicle control) in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_989466] or 
placebo will be administered monthly (3 ad ministrations total on Study Days 1, 29, and 57). 
Subjects will be treated and evaluated as  indicated in the Table of Events ( Table 1 ).  
Subjects will undergo a Screeni ng Period (up to 28 days in du ration) to determine study 
eligibility and baseline levels of signs and sy mptoms of DPN will be established.  Subjects will 
then enter a Treatment Period (6 months in durat ion).  During the Treatment Period, subjects will 
be evaluated on an ongoing basis (at 8 scheduled  study visits).  Subjects will receive IM 
injections of IP on Study Days 1, 29, and 57 as fifteen 0.30 mL injections (below the knee and 
above the ankle) in one lower extremity in a blinded manner.  After completing the Treatment 
Period, subjects will enter the Follow-up Period where they will continue to be evaluated at 
scheduled study visits over the subsequent months. 
An analysis of all study data will  occur after the last subject has completed Visit 9 (Month 6) and 
after the last scheduled study visit. Analyses to  be performed can be found in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan. 
The study will be subject to oversight by [CONTACT_1629] i ndependent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC).  
The DMC will review unblinded efficacy and sa fety data on an ongoing basis (both scheduled 
and ad hoc [if needed]) as outlined in the DMC Charter. 
4.2. Study Design Rationale 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_724852] N are currently limited to pain relief (tricyclic antidepressants, 
serotonin norepi[INVESTIGATOR_724853], anti convulsants, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and non-prescription 
analgesics). Current treatments do not adequately  address the symptoms in  a large proportion of 
subjects with DPN, and there ar e no approved treatments that ta rget the underlying disease.  
One of the major pathophysiologic factors that contributes to DPN is damage to the vasa 
nervorum or the vascular supply to  the nerves involved in DPN. In  DPN, vascular damage to the 
vasa nervorum is induced by [CONTACT_724895] w ith receptors to cells that are 
relevant to the atherosclerotic process, oxidative stress to the vessel wall, and hyperglycemia 
inducing protein kinase C, which is responsib le for increased blood vessel permeability, nitric 
oxide dysfunction, and increas ed leukocyte adhesion ( Kles, 2006 ).   
Results from the rat hind limb ischemia model show  that mesenchymal like stromal cells isolated 
from human placenta (formulated for IM injectio n as PDA-002) have poten tial clinical use in 
tissue repair through increasing angiogenesis. Fu rthermore, PDA-002 cells implanted in a mouse 
model of chronic hind limb ischemia improve d blood perfusion and limb functional recovery 
(see Investigators Brochure).  
PDA-[ADDRESS_989467]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  The assessment of changes in nerve function a nd microvascular oxygenation in subjects with 
DPN will be based on a combination of evaluatio ns that will assess nerve histology, DPN signs 
and symptoms, and tissue perfusion and oxygenati on using measurement methods listed in the 
Table of Events ( Table 1 ). 
With regard to route of administration, IM administration of PDA-002 has demonstrated an 
acceptable safety profile to date. After IM ad ministration in animal models, there was no 
evidence of distribution to the vascular compartment and PDA-002 cells were detected only at 
the site of administration and draining lymph no des. Care will be taken to avoid systemic 
injection of cells.  
The doses selected for this study are based upon th e effective doses adjusted for body weight that 
were administered in the previ ously described hind limb ischemia (HLI) animal models, as well

Phase 1 study in which subjects were administered 3 x 106 cells, 10 x 106 cells and 30 x 106 cells

Table of Events ( Table 1 ).  
All other procedures (a s discussed in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2) will be conducted as per the 
Table of Events ( Table 1 ). 
6.4. Efficacy Procedures 
The following efficacy assessments will be perf ormed as outlined in the Table of Events 
(Table 1 ). 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_399554] (ENFD):   This assessment relies on an immunohistochemical 
localization of a neural antigen within axons.  Hi stological specimens will consist of serial 3mm 
thickness punch biopsies of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_724857].  
To quantify ENFD (fibers/mm of epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196]), th e pathologist manually counts the number of 
PDA-[ADDRESS_989489]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  epi[INVESTIGATOR_724858] 3 to 5 sections and divides the value by [CONTACT_724897][INVESTIGATOR_724859].  In addition, a quantifi cation of the autonomic sudomotor (sympathetic 
cholinergic) and pi[INVESTIGATOR_724860] (sympathetic adrenerg ic) nerve fibers will be conducted within the 
same biopsy. 
Histology of Immune Cells:  Two skin biopsies will be taken from the volar aspect of the 
forearm.  The first biopsy will be used for histology analysis to evaluate the inflammatory 
response by [CONTACT_724898].  The second biopsy will be used to perform 
mRNA / protein analysis.  
Circulating Blood Biomarkers:  Blood collected to be used for biomarker analysis will include 
whole blood collection for blood immune biomar kers and red blood cell (RBC)-lysed peripheral 
blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) sample for the chip cytometry immune phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_124365]*.   
* These assessments for RBC-lysed periphe ral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) by [CONTACT_724899]. 
Hyperspectral Imaging *:  Hyperspectral imaging (HIS) obtains multiple images at discrete 
wavelengths, providing a diffuse reflectance spectrum of each pi[INVESTIGATOR_724861] l in the image. The system 
uses wavelengths between 500 and 600 nanomet ers which serve to obtain oxy- and deoxy-
hemoglobin absorption peaks.  Tissue oxygenation im ages or “maps” are then constructed from 
oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin values determined fr om each pi[INVESTIGATOR_724862].  HSI will be 
measured in both lower limbs. 
*This procedure will be measured only if it is available for this study protocol at the 
participating site. 
6-item Neuropathy Total Symptom Score (NTSS-6):   The NTSS-6 questionnaire is used to 
evaluate the frequency and intens ity of neuropathy sensory sympto ms identified by [CONTACT_724900] (ie, numbness and/or insensit ivity, prickling, and/ or tingling; burning pain; aching pain 
and/or tightness, sharp shooting la ncinating pain and allodynia a nd/or hyperalgesi a).  Symptoms 
are graded based on the experience of the subj ect during the past 24 hours.  Each symptom 
question can be assigned a maximum score of 3.66 points.  The symptom scores are summed, 
and the total score can range from 0 points to 21.96 points.  A higher sc ore indicates greater 
disability. 
Neurological Impairment Score of the Lower Limb (NIS-LL):   The NIS-LL is an assessment 
tool composed of a sensory subscore (which ev aluates sensory perceptions to touch, prickling 
pain, vibration, joint position, and to 1 gram a nd 10 gram monofilaments), and a motor subscore 
(which evaluates muscle strength, muscle wasti ng, and deep tendon reflexes) in the lower limbs.  
The scale is additive for all deficits and is appl ied in a bilateral manner for each modality tested.  
The subscores are totaled and can range from 0 points (normal neurological function) to 88 
points (absence of all motor, sensory, and reflex ac tivity).  An increase of  2 points is clinically 
significant. 
Utah Early Neuropathy Scale (UENS):  The UENS uses a physical examination specific to 
early sensory predominant polyneuropathy which em phasizes severity and spatial distribution of 
sharp sensory loss in the foot a nd leg.  The total score can range from [ADDRESS_989490]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  Electro physiologic Nerve Conduction Studies:   Nerve conduction studies allow for the 
quantification of the conduction amplitude, veloc ity, and latency of the tibial and peroneal 
nerves, and the amplitude and latency of the sural nerve.   Reduction of amplitudes of recorded 
responses generally indicates a loss of axons. Nerve conduction will be measured in both lower limbs.  
Quantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Testing (QSART):   QSART is a measurement of 
autonomic involvement by [CONTACT_724901] c sudomotor function de ficits in the foot, 
distal leg, and distal thigh.   
Patient Global Impression of Ch ange in Neuropathy (PGICN):  The PGICN is a subject’s 
self assessment to describe and change in symp toms of neuropathy such  as pain, tingling, or 
numbness. 
Health-Related Quality of  Life (QOL) as measured by [CONTACT_724892]-DN:   The Norfolk 
QOL-DN is composed of 5 domains (physical f unctioning/large fiber neuropathy, activities of 
daily living, symptoms, small fiber neuropathy, and autonomic nerve function) encompassing 35 
scored questions related to subj ects’ neuropathy signs and symptoms , as well as to the impact of 
DPN on subjects’ activities of da ily life.  The total score can range from -2 to 138.  A higher 
score indicates higher disability. 
Vascular Reactivity Measurements*:  Vascular reactivity will be measured by [CONTACT_724902].  By [CONTACT_724903], the endothelium-dependent  vasodilatation may be measured.  The MIC1 
iontophoresis system will be used in this study.  Specifically, a small quantity (<1 ml) of 1% 
acetylcholine chloride solution will be used on the forearm of the participating subjects; 
subsequently a constant current of [ADDRESS_989491] with 
the foot, it will only measure the nerve axon-related vasodilation.  The results are expressed as 
percentage of increase over the baseline blood flow. 
*This procedure will be measured only if it is available for this study protocol at the 
participating site. 
6.5. Safety 
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_724904] (hematology, serum 
chemistry, coagulation, pregnancy, urinalysis , physical examination results, vital sign 
measurements, 12-lead ECG at screen ing only, weight, use of concomitant 
medications/procedures, and the in cidence and severity of injec tion site and injection-related 
reactions (including trypta se and histamine) and treatment-emergent AEs. 
PDA-[ADDRESS_989492]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: [ADDRESS_989493] 7 days prior to each 
scheduled DMC teleconference/meeting.  Data will be current through 14 days prior to each 
scheduled DMC teleconference/meeting. 
The external DMC will be convened to assess th e benefit risk of PDA-002 when approximately 
25% and 50% of subjects complete the Month 3 (Visit 6) assessment. Study enrollment will be 
ongoing during these scheduled reviews. 
The external DMC chairman will be notified if an  AE of medical interest should occur and will 
determine if a full DMC will need to be conve yed. During any period of deliberation by [CONTACT_724905], a temporary hold on enrollment of new subjects will 
be instituted. The AEs of medical interest  that would trigger this process are: 
 Identification of 1 or more subjects  within a dosing treatment arm with ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_989494] ed to be related to the IP.  
 Identification of 1 or more subjects e xperiencing a suspected unexpected, treatment-
related SAE (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) within 14 days followi ng the initial dose of the IP suspected 
unexpected serious a dverse reactions.  
 Identification of 1 or more s ubjects with a new malignancy.  
The sponsor will take appropriate action based upon the external DMC recommendation and this 
will be communicated to the investigators.  Th e investigators will be responsible for notifying 
their Institutional Review Boards (IRBs).  The external DMC will evaluate on an ongoing basis all available safety data, in pa rticular all SAEs and their poten tial relationship to PDA-002.  The 
external DMC may recommend modifications to enro llment or to the study design in order to 
ensure subject safety.  Further explanation of th e roles and responsibilitie s of the external DMC 
will be outlined in the external DMC charter. 
 
PDA-[ADDRESS_989495]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: [ADDRESS_989496] understand and voluntarily sign an  informed consent document prior to any 
study related assessments/pro cedures are conducted.

PDA-[ADDRESS_989501]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: [ADDRESS_989502] contains a mesenchymal-lik e cell population derived from 
normal, full-term human placental tissue.  The cel ls are culture-expanded as a plastic-adherent, 
undifferentiated in vitro cell population that expresses the nominal phenotype CD34-, CD10+, 
CD105+, and CD200+.  The cells constitutively expr ess moderate levels of HLA Class I and 
undetectable levels of HLA Class II. 
These cells demonstrate a range of potential biol ogical activities which incl ude the ability to (1) 
induce endothelial cell survival, migration and tube formation, s howing angiogenic and 
cytoprotective potential, and (2) modulate T-cell repertoire and affect the M1/M2 balance of 
macrophages demonstrating an immune modulator y effect.  Based on these properties, the 
proposed study will evaluate the safety of PDA-002 in subjects with DPN. 
PDA-002 or placebo (vehicle control) units will be  shipped to the study sites as cryopreserved 
units and will be thawed and f illed into syringes prior to IM  injection.  A PDA-002 unit are 
supplied at 2 dosage strengths and contains appr oximately 3 or 30 million cells in 4.5 mL of a 
5.75% dextran 40/10% human serum albumin (HSA) solution containing 2.5% DMSO for 
cryopreservation.  The solution also  contains Plasma-Lyte and sa line to maintain the cells’ 
osmotic environment.  Placebo (vehicle control)  units contain the above-mentioned components, 
without any cells. The product is intended for allogeneic use. 
8.2. Treatment Administration and Schedule 
Investigational product (IP) will be administered  on Study Days 1, [ADDRESS_989503] meets the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
Investigational product thawing will be performed by [CONTACT_3784] s ite personnel according to the 
instructions in Appendix E .  Three [ADDRESS_989504] ered as fifteen 0.30 mL injections  (approximately 4.5 mL total) 
in one leg.  The target region is suggested to be  below the knee and above the ankle.  Injections 
are suggested to be at least [ADDRESS_989505] ered in a pattern of 3 x 5 injections around the leg, 
and injections should not be near a blood vessel. The administrator wi ll be blinded to treatment.  
PDA-002 is not intended for intravenous administra tion.  When the injection is given, the syringe 
should be aspi[INVESTIGATOR_724864].  If any blood is aspi[INVESTIGATOR_724865], the needle is to be pulle d out a little, and the syringe re -aspi[INVESTIGATOR_3831].  If no blood is seen, 
the IP may be injected. 
Vital signs (including heart ra te, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], blood pressure , body temperature) will be 
monitored prior to starting the in jections and at 1 and 2 hours (± 15 minutes) after completion of 
PDA-[ADDRESS_989506]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  the injections.  Blood samples for tryptase a nd histamine, coagulation assessments, and 
exploratory biomarkers will be collected as indicated in the Table of Events ( Table 1 ). 
The investigational cente rs must also offer appropriate supplemental services that support 
clinical care to ensure that the protocol sp ecified IP administration and monitoring will be 
followed. 
Administration Instructions.  Under aseptic conditions, PDA-[ADDRESS_989507] be 
noted in the eCRF and in the source documents.   If less than the total injection volume is 
administered, the volume injected should be re corded and the sponsor should be notified. 
Note :  For this study, all ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_989508] be 
reported to Celgene Cellular Therapeutics as an SAE within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
knowledge of the event. 
8.2.1.  Discontinuation 
The reason for discontinuation shou ld be recorded in the eCRF and in the source documents. The 
decision to discontinue a subject remains the resp onsibility of the treating physician, which will 
not be delayed or refused by [CONTACT_456]. Howe ver, prior to disconti nuing a subject, the 
investigator may contact [CONTACT_724908] d forward appropriate su pporting documents for 
review and discussion.  Of note, the investigator is not required to contact a medical monitor to 
discuss discontinuation or unblinding  as the investigator has the ab ility to discontinue or rapi[INVESTIGATOR_724866].  
Subjects who discontinue will have the procedures performed as listed in the Early Termination 
column as per the Table of Events ( Table 1 ). 
8.2.2.  Overdose 
An overdose is defined for this protocol as a subject receiving any dose of greater than [ADDRESS_989509] be collected as an 
Adverse Event as outlined in Section 11.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events. 
Eligible subjects will be randomized to  one of 3 treatment arms (3 x 106 PDA-002 cells, 30 x 106 
PDA-002 cells, or placebo) via Interactive Voice Response Syst em (IVRS) across sites in a 
double-blind fashion. 
PDA-[ADDRESS_989510]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  8.3. Method of Treatment Assignment 
Eligible subjects will be randomized to  one of 3 treatment arms (3 x 106 PDA-002 cells, 30 x 106 
PDA-002 cells, or placebo) via Interactive Voice Response Syst em (IVRS) across sites in a 
double-blind fashion. 
The unblinded pharmacist/designee at the study site will prepare the appropria te IP and deliver it 
to the personnel performing the injections.  All other site staff, including the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_724867] s ponsor will remain blinded to study treatment 
assignment. 
Pharmacists should consult the pharmacy manual for detailed instructions on the 
preparation and handling of PDA-002 for this study.  
8.4. Packaging and Labeling 
Each vial of IP supplied by [CONTACT_724909] b ear Celgene Cellular Therapeutics’ name [CONTACT_2758], study product name [CONTACT_724934], and traceable lot number.  Additional product 
information including the date of manufacture, the volume of product cont ained within the vial, 
and cell concentration (for active cells) will also be noted.  Finally, the label will contain the 
standard caution statement fo r investigational products. 
The syringe rack label, affixed subsequently to  thawing/dilution and prior to administration, will 
provide expi[INVESTIGATOR_4061], volume, and handling instructions. 
The label(s) for IP will include sponsor name , address and telephone number, the protocol 
number, IP name, dosage form and strength (where  applicable), amount of IP per container, lot 
number, expi[INVESTIGATOR_5695] (where applicable), medication identification/kit number, dosing 
instructions, storage conditions, and required caution statements a nd/or regulatory statements as 
applicable.  Additional information may be in cluded on the label as applicable per local 
regulations. 
8.5. Investigational Product Ac countability and Disposal 
Celgene (or designee) will review with the investigator and rele vant site personnel the process 
for IP return, disposal, and/or destruction including responsibilities for the site versus Celgene 
(or designee). 
The investigator(s) or designee is responsible for taking an in ventory and performing a visual 
inspection of each shipment of items received and for completing the “Human Placenta-Derived 
Cells (PDA-002) Product Receipt Record” enclosed  within the envelope provided with the 
shipment.  The investigator(s) or designee will verify the accuracy of the information on the 
form, sign and date it, retain a copy in the study file, and return a copy to the sponsor. 
At the study site, all investigational IP will be  stored in a locked, safe area to prevent 
unauthorized access.  The IP should remain in the cryogenic shipper provided by [CONTACT_724910]. 
Accurate recording of all IP administration (inc luding dispensing and dosing) will be made in the 
appropriate section of the subject’s eCRF and in the source documents. 
PDA-[ADDRESS_989511]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  The investigator(s) or designee(s) is responsible for accounting for all IP that is issued to the 
investigative site during the course of the study. 
If any IP is lost or damaged, its disposition s hould be documented in the source documents.  The 
sponsor will provide instructions to  the investigator(s) for the retu rn or destruction of unused IP 
and IP supplies at the end of the study. 
PDA-[ADDRESS_989512].  The FDA (21 Code of 
Federal Regulations [CFR] 1271.290) requires that a reco rd-keepi[INVESTIGATOR_724868]-based pro ducts from the donor to the cons ignee and vice versa, or any 
other final disposition (for example, shipment  was lost or the integrity of the unit was 
compromised).  In accordance with this regula tion, Celgene Cellular Therapeutics (CCT) has 
established a tracking system for PDA-002. 
For each unit of PDA-002 that is administered, it is important to maintain records sufficient to 
permit prompt identification of th e recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  At no time will th e identification of the donor be 
known by [CONTACT_724911]. 
To facilitate an effective tracking process: 
 Affix the PDA-002 tracking labels provided wi th the units to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s medical 
records and/or other pertinent records, if any, for each unit of PDA-[ADDRESS_989513]. 
 Maintain the records described above a nd any other records necessary to permit 
prompt tracking of each unit of PDA-002 to its  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_724869]. 
 Ensure all such records are legibl e, accurate, indelible, and secure. 
 Ensure all such records are readily av ailable and allow the sponsor and any 
authorized government officers prompt access to such records to the extent required 
by [CONTACT_2371]. 
 Ensure that the record security systems are adequate to ensure the confidentiality of 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_724870]-002. 
 Retain the records referenced in this docum ent for at least [ADDRESS_989514]. 
 Do not further di stribute PDA-002. 
Celgene will instruct the investigator on the return , disposal, and/or destru ction of investigational 
product and/or medical device materials if applicable.  
Celgene (or designee) will review with the investigator and rele vant site personnel the process 
for IP return, disposal, and/or destruction including responsibilities for the site versus Celgene 
(or designee). 
8.6. Investigational Product Compliance 
Accurate recording of all IP administration (inc luding dispensing and dosing) will be made in the 
appropriate section of the subject’s eCRF and in the source documents. 
PDA-[ADDRESS_989515]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: [ADDRESS_989516] outside of  the study team will be unblinded to assess the 
data on biomarkers. The following personnel extern al to the sponsor will also be unblinded to 
treatment assignment: the pharmacist, or designee responsible for mixing/ thawing IP, at each 
study site and the IVRS group.  Members of the external DMC will have access to unblinded 
data as specified in Section 6.5.[ADDRESS_989517]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  9. CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS AND PROCEDURES 
9.1. Permitted Concomitant Medi cations and Procedures 
Concomitant medications and procedures for treat ment of DPN are allowed; however, subjects 
should maintain stable doses and stable dose regimens of neuropathy medications (such as 
anticonvulsants like pregabalin, ga bapentin, and antidepressant medi cations such as duloxetine) 
for at least [ADDRESS_989518]’s standard medical care through the Treatment 
Period (through Visit 9) unless ch anges are necessary to ensure the best care fo r the subject. 
9.2. Prohibited Concomitant Medications and Procedures 
It is recommended that subjects continue to ma intain stable doses /dose regimens of DPN 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_724871] (Study Visit 9) whenever possible. 
9.3. Required Concomitant Medi cations and Procedures 
Subjects should receive standard of ca re prior to and th roughout the study.  
PDA-[ADDRESS_989519]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: [ADDRESS_989520] ology at 6 months following IM administration of 
2 different doses of PDA-002 or placebo.  Asse ssment of epi[INVESTIGATOR_724872]. 
The secondary objective of the study is to assess the safety and to lerability of IM administration 
of 2 different doses of PDA-002 or placebo in subj ects with DPN.  Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_344412], frequency, severity, and pot ential relationship of adverse ev ents to treatment with IP. 
A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be  provided in a separate document.  Exploratory 
biomarker analysis and other experimental eval uations will be outlined in separate documents 
and will not be included as part of the Clinical Study Report.   
10.2. Study Population Definitions 
The following analysis populations are planned for this study: 
Screening Population (Screen):  The Screening Population incl udes all subjects who provide 
informed consent and screen for eligibility duri ng the Screening Period (Day -28 to Day -1). 
Safety Population (Safety):   The Safety Population include s all subjects who receive any 
amount of IP. 
Modified Intent To Treat (mITT):  The mITT population includes all subjects who receive any 
amount of IP and subsequently provid e at least one efficacy assessment. 
Other study populations or subgroup populations may be identified during the course of this 
study.  Any additional study populations or subgroups will be clearly identifie d either in the SAP 
or, if after database lock, then as post-hoc  study populations in the clinical study report. 
10.3. Sample Size and Power Considerations 
The sample size of [ADDRESS_989521] of a combination of 
L-methylfolate, methylcobalamine, and pyr idoxal 5 phosphate in subjects with DPN 
(Jacobs, 2011 ), the mean ENFD was 1.56 fibers/mm at baseline and 3.07 fibers/mm after [ADDRESS_989522] deviation of 1.5 fibers/mm fo r the mean increase.  Assuming 
the same treatment effect is observed from base line, the sample size of 16 subjects actively on 
therapy resulting from combining the 2 active arms has a 96% power to detect a similar mean 
change at [ADDRESS_989523]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  60% power to detect similar differences betw een placebo and active ther apy with PDA-002, with 
a two-sided test and a Type I error rate set at 0.05.   
10.4. Background and Demographic Characteristics 
Baseline and demographic characteristic will be summarized by [CONTACT_2939].  Subjects’ age, 
height, weight, and baseline char acteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics, while 
gender, race and other categoric al variables will be provided using frequency tabulations.  
Medical history data will be summarized usi ng frequency tabulations by [CONTACT_39812]. 
10.5. Subject Disposition 
Subject disposition (analysis population allocation, entered, di scontinued, along with primary 
reason for discontinuation) will be summarized using frequency and percentage for both 
treatment and follow-up phases.  A summary of subjects enrolled by [CONTACT_27707]. 
Protocol deviations wi ll be summarized usi ng frequency tabulations. 
10.6. Efficacy Analysis 
The planned analyses will be fully de scribed in a comprehensive SAP.  
The primary efficacy analysis will be an evaluati on of change from baseline in ENFD at [ADDRESS_989524] va riability of measurements eval uated in both the treated leg 
(with active or placebo) and the other leg that received placebo. 
Changes in the various exploratory efficacy e ndpoints including within subject differences 
between left and right leg meas urements will be evaluated us ing descriptive statistics.  
In general, exploratory endpoint s that are categorical will be  examined using descriptive 
summaries such as counts and percentages, wh ereas exploratory endpoint s that are continuous 
will be examined using means, standard deviations and medians. The results of the exploratory analyses will allow for better definiti on of the clinical efficacy endpoints. 
10.7. Safety Analysis 
The safety analyses will be conducted using the Safety Population (all subjects who receive any 
amount of IP).  Adverse events, vital sign measur ements, physical examination findings, clinical 
laboratory test results, injection site assessments, retinal assessment results, ECG interpretations, 
and concomitant medications and procedures will  be tabulated and summ arized as appropriate. 
Adverse events observed will be classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) classification system.  If clinically significant, any or all laboratory 
evaluations should be reported as AEs and repeated more frequently, if clin ically indicated.  The 
severity of the toxicities will be graded acco rding to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  (CTCAE) Version 4.[ADDRESS_989525]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: [ADDRESS_989526] comple ted Visit 9 (Month 6). 
 
PDA-[ADDRESS_989527]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: [ADDRESS_989528]’s health, including 
laboratory test values (as specifi ed by [CONTACT_14540]  11.3 ), regardless of etiology.  Any 
worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a pre-
existing condition) should be considered an AE.  A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on 
the AE page of the eCRF rather than the indi vidual signs or symptoms  of the diagnosis or 
syndrome.  
Abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity to an investigational product should be reported as an 
AE.  Overdose, accidental or intent ional, whether or not it is a ssociated with an AE should be 
reported on the overdose CRF.  See Section  8.2.[ADDRESS_989529] should be monitored as appropriate and should receive 
supportive measures as necessary.  There is no known specific antidote for PDA-002 overdose. 
Actual treatment should depend on the severity of  the clinical situation and the judgment and 
experience of the treating physician. 
All subjects will be monitored for AEs during the study.  Assessments may include monitoring 
of any or all of the following parameters:  the subject’s clinical  symptoms, laboratory, 
pathological, radiological or su rgical findings, physical examina tion findings, or findings from 
other tests and/or procedures. 
All AEs and SAEs will be recorded by [CONTACT_724912].  AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) will 
be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF and in  the subject’s source documents.  All SAEs must 
be reported to Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours  of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event 
by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent 
form. 
11.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events 
A qualified Investigator will evaluate all adverse events as to:  
PDA-[ADDRESS_989530]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  11.2.1.  Seriousness  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE occurring at any dose that: 
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening (ie, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689] , the subject is at immediate 
risk of death from the AE) 
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103296] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_724873], regardless of length of stay) 
 Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (a substantial disruption of the 
subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Constitutes an important medical event 
Important medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately life 
threatening or result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or disability, but  may jeopardize the subject or 
require medical or surgical in tervention to prevent one of th e other outcomes listed above.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exerci sed in deciding whether such an AE should be 
considered serious.  
Any allergic reaction ≥ Grade 3 and associated with the IP  is to be reported as an SAE.   
Events not considered  to be SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]: 
 A standard procedure for protocol thera py administration.  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72612] a complicat ion of therapy administration will be 
reported as an SAE.  
 Routine treatment or monitoring of the st udied indication not associated with any 
deterioration in condition. 
 A procedure for protocol/disease-related  investigations (e g, surgery, scans, 
endoscopy, sampling for laboratory tests,  bone marrow sampling).  However, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27589] a complication of such procedures 
remains a reportable SAE. 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_724874], practical, or social 
reasons, in absence of an AE. 
 A procedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to starti ng of treatment on study); must 
be documented in the source document and the eCRF.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72613] a complication remains a reportable SAE. 
 Emergency outpatient treatment or observa tion that does not result in admission, 
unless fulfilling other se riousness criteria above. 
If an AE is considered serious, both the AE pa ge/screen of the eCRF and the SAE Report Form 
must be completed. 
For each SAE, the Investigator will provide in formation on severity, start and stop dates, 
relationship to IP, action take n regarding IP, and outcome. 
PDA-[ADDRESS_989531]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  11.2.2.  Severity / Intensity 
For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator must as sess the severity / intensity of the event.  
The severity / intensity of AEs will be graded  based upon the subject’s symptoms according to 
the current active minor version of the Co mmon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  
(CTCAE, Version 4.03); http://ctep.cancer.gov/protoco lDevelopment/electronic_a pplications/ctc.htm#ctc_40 
AEs that are not defined in the CTCAE should be evaluated for severity / intensity according to 
the following scale: 
Grade 1 = Mild – transient or mild disc omfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required 
Grade 2 = Moderate – mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may be needed; no 
or minimal medical intervention/therapy required 
Grade 3 = Severe – marked limitation in activit y, some assistance usually required; medical 
intervention/therapy require d, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_724875] 4 = Life threatening – extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance required; 
significant medical intervention /therapy required, hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_369318] 5 = Death - the event results in death The term “severe” is often used to describe the in tensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarction); the event itse lf, however, may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as severe h eadache).  This criterion is not the same as “serious” which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with even ts that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or functioning.   
The term “severe” is often used to describe the in tensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarction); the event itse lf, however, may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as severe h eadache).  This criterion is not the same as “serious” which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with even ts that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or functioning.   
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining regulatory obligations. 
11.2.3.  Causality 
The Investigator must determine the relations hip between the administration of IP and the 
occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspect ed or Suspected as defined below: 
Not suspected: Means a causal relationship of the adverse event to IP 
administration is unlikely or remote , or other medications, 
therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions provide a 
sufficient explanation for the observed event. 
Suspected: Means there is a reasonable possibility that the administration 
of IP caused the adverse event.  “Reasonable possibility” means 
there is evidence to suggest a ca usal relationship between the IP 
and the adverse event. 
PDA-[ADDRESS_989532]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  Causality should be assessed and provided fo r every AE/SAE based on currently available 
information.  Causality is to be reassessed and provided as additional information becomes 
available. 
If an event is assessed as suspected of being re lated to a comparator, ancillary or additional IP 
that has not been manufactured or provided by [CONTACT_27718], please provide the name [CONTACT_208924]. 
11.2.4.  Duration 
For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator will provid e a record of the start and stop dates of the 
event. 
11.2.5.  Action Taken 
The Investigator will report the action taken with IP  as a result of an AE or SAE, as applicable 
(eg, discontinuation, interruption, or  reduction of IP, as appropriat e) and report if concomitant 
and/or additional treatments we re given for the event.  
11.2.6.  Outcome 
The investigator will report the outcome of the event of both AEs and SAEs. All SAEs that have 
not resolved upon discontinuation of  the subject’s partic ipation in the study must be followed 
until recovered, recovered with sequelae, not recovered or death (due to the SAE).  
11.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values 
An abnormal laboratory value is consid ered to be an AE if the abnormality: 
 results in discontinuation from the study; 
 requires treatment, modification/ interrupti on of IP dose, or a ny other therapeutic 
intervention; or 
 is judged to be of significant clinical importance, eg, one that indicates a new disease 
process and/or organ toxicity, or is an exacerbation or worsening of an existing 
condition. 
Regardless of severity grade, only laboratory ab normalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion 
need to be documented as a serious adverse event. 
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/s creen of the eCRF.  If the abnormality was not 
a part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the labor atory abnormality should be recorded as the AE. 
If possible, the laboratory abnorma lity should be recorded as a medi cal term and not simply as an 
abnormal laboratory result (eg, record thromboc ytopenia rather than decreased platelets). 
11.4. Pregnancy 
All pregnancies or suspected pre gnancies occurring in either a fe male subject or partner of a 
male subject are immediately reportable events 
PDA-[ADDRESS_989533]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  11.4.1.  Females of Childbearing Potential 
Pregnancies and suspected pregnanc ies (including a positive pregnanc y test regardless of age or 
disease state) of a female subjec t occurring while the subject is on IP, or during the course of the 
study, are considered immediately re portable events.  IP is to be discontinued immediately.  The 
pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety immediately by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropr iate method, using the Pregnancy Initial Report 
Form, or approved equivalent form. 
The female subject should be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist, preferably one 
experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. 
The Investigator will follow the female subject  until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify Celgene Drug Safety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or 
abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow-up Report Form, or approved equivalent form. 
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (eg, spontaneous abortion), the Investigator 
should report the abnormal outcome as an AE.  If the abnormal outcome m eets any of the serious 
criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Celg ene Drug Safety by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate 
method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the even t using the SAE Report 
Form, or approved equivalent form. 
All neonatal deaths that occur w ithin [ADDRESS_989534] to 
causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant death after 28 days that the In vestigator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be repo rted to Celgene Drug Safety by 
[CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Investigat or’s knowledge of the 
event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form. 
11.4.2.  Male Subjects 
If a female partner of a male subject taking i nvestigational product beco mes pregnant, the male 
subject taking IP should notify the Investigator, and the pregna nt female partner should be 
advised to call their health care provider immediately.  
11.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE re quires the completion of an SAE Report Form in 
addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF.  All SAEs must be reported to 
Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report  Form, or approved equivalent form.  This 
instruction pertains to initial SAE re ports as well as any follow-up reports. 
The Investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent.  
This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relationship to IP) th at occur during the study 
(from the time the subject signs informed consen t until the last study visit) and any SAE made 
known to the Investigator at any time thereafter that are suspected of being re lated to IP.  SAEs 
occurring prior to treatment (after signing the ICF) will be captured. 
The SAE report should provide a detailed descrip tion of the SAE and include a concise summary 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27598].  If a subject died and an autopsy has been 
performed, copi[INVESTIGATOR_724876]-[ADDRESS_989535]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  Safety as soon as these become available.  Any follow-up data should be de tailed in a subsequent 
SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent fo rm, and sent to Celgene Drug Safety. 
Where required by [CONTACT_19666], the Investigator  is responsible for informing the IRB/Ethics 
Committee (EC) of the SAE and providing them  with all relevant initial and follow-up 
information about the event. The Investigator mu st keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_724877]/EC. 
11.5.1.  Safety Queries 
Queries pertaining to SAEs will be communicated from Celgene Drug Safety to the site via 
facsimile or electronic mail.  Th e response time is expected to be no more than five (5) business 
days.  Urgent queries (eg, missing causal ity assessment) may be handled by [CONTACT_648]. 
11.6. Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events 
For the purpose of regulatory reporting, Celgene Drug Safety will determine the expectedness of 
events suspected of being related to PDA-002 based on th e Investigator Brochure. 
In the [LOCATION_002], all suspected unexpected  serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be 
reported in an expedited manner in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32. 
Celgene or its authorized representative shall notify the Investigator of the following 
information.  
 Any AE suspected of being related to the use of IP in this study or in other studies 
that is both serious and unexpected (ie, S[LOCATION_003]R); 
 Any finding from tests in laboratory animal s that suggests a significant risk for 
human subjects including reports of mutage nicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity. 
Where required by [CONTACT_19666], the Investigat or shall notify his/he r IRB/EC promptly of 
these new serious and unexpected AE(s) or significant risks to subjects. 
The Investigator must keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_27601]/EC.  (See Section 15.[ADDRESS_989536] retention 
information). 
Celgene Drug Safety Contact [CONTACT_7171]: 
For Celgene Drug Safety contact [CONTACT_3031], plea se refer to the Serious Adverse Event Report 
Form Completion Guidelines or to the Pr egnancy Report Form Completion Guidelines. 
 
PDA-[ADDRESS_989537]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: [ADDRESS_989538] will trigger a suspension of additional enrollment pending an 
evaluation by [CONTACT_724913] (DMC) of the event at an ad hoc meeting. Should 
such an event occur, the DMC will review the av ailable data from the subject’s history and the 
event itself as well as available data on all other previously treated subjects.  The committee will 
recommend if it is appropriate to resume enrollment without study modifications, to resume 
enrollment with study modifications or to perm anently discontinue furt her enrollment into the 
study. Operational details are sp ecified in the DMC Charter. 
 Identification of 1 or more subjects  within a dosing treatment arm with ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_989539] ed to be related to the IP.  
 Identification of 1 or more subjects e xperiencing a suspected unexpected, treatment-
related SAE (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) within 14 days followi ng the initial dose of the IP suspected 
unexpected serious a dverse reactions.  
 Identification of 1 or more s ubjects with a new malignancy.  
12.1.2.  Mandatory Treatment Discontinuations 
Should subjects experience any of the following ev ents, they may not receive additional doses of 
PDA-002. They should stay on study however, a nd all scheduled evaluations are to be 
performed. 
 A Grade 3 or higher allergic reaction w ithin 24 hours of PD A-002 administration. 
 An epi[INVESTIGATOR_724878] w ithin 24 hours of PDA-002 
administration.  Examples include acute cor onary ischemia and retinal artery spasm. 
 An epi[INVESTIGATOR_724879] w ithin [ADDRESS_989540] a nd/or from the study: 
 Adverse event(s) 
 Withdrawal by [CONTACT_1130] 
 Death 
 Lost to follow-up 
 Protocol violation 
 Pregnancy 
PDA-[ADDRESS_989541]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015   Recovery 
 Non-compliance with IP 
 Study terminated by [CONTACT_3211] 
 Physician decision 
 Screen failure 
 Technical problems 
 Disease relapse 
 Failure to meet randomization criteria 
 Site terminated by [CONTACT_3211] 
 Completed 
 Other (to be specified in the eCRF) 
The reason for discontinuation of treatment should be recorded in the e CRF and in the source 
documents. 
The decision to discontinue a subject from treat ment remains the responsi bility of the treating 
physician, which will not be delaye d or refused by [CONTACT_1034].  However, prior to discontinuing 
a subject, the Investigator ma y contact [CONTACT_1689] a nd forward appropriate supporting 
documents for review and discussion.  
Subjects who discontinue will have laboratory asse ssments performed as specified in the Early 
Termination Column in the Table of Events ( Table 1 ).  
12.2. Study Discontinuation 
The following events are considered sufficient reasons for discontinuing a subject from the 
study: 
 Screen failure 
 Adverse event(s) 
 Withdrawal by [CONTACT_1130] 
 Death 
 Lost to follow-up 
 Other (to be specified in the eCRF)  
The reason for study discontinuation should be re corded in the eCRF and in the source 
documents. 
PDA-[ADDRESS_989542]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: [ADDRESS_989543] the responsible Clinical Research 
Physician/Medical Monitor or designee by [CONTACT_724914](s) listed on the Emergency 
Contact [CONTACT_27723] (after title page). 
In the unlikely event that the C linical Research Physician/Medica l Monitor or designee cannot be 
reached, please contact [CONTACT_724915] (after title page).This global Emergency 
Call Center is available 24 hours a day and 7 da ys a week. The represen tatives are responsible 
for obtaining your call-back information and cont acting the on call Celgene/Contract Research 
organization (CRO) Medical Monitor, who will then contact [CONTACT_27726]. 
Note: The back-up [ADDRESS_989544]  call center should onl y be used if you are 
not able to reach the Clinical Research Phys ician(s) or Medical Monitor or designee for 
emergency calls.  
13.2. Emergency Identification of  Investigational Products 
The blind must not be broken during the course of the study  unless  in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], it is absolutely necessary to safely tr eat the subject.  If it is medically imperative to 
know what IP the subject is receiving, IP should be temporarily discontinued if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15960], continuing IP can  negatively affect the outcome of  the subject’s treatment.  The 
Investigator or authorized person should open the randomization envelope/peel apart the 2-part 
label; use an emergency unblinding personal id entification number (P IN) and call IVRS for 
unblinded dose information, etc. However, every e ffort should be made to contact [CONTACT_724916]/Medical Mon itor prior to breaking the blind. Contact [CONTACT_724917]/Medical Monitor as well as the reason for breaking the 
blind must be documented in the source documents. 
The decision to break the blind in emergency situ ations remains the responsibility of the treating 
physician, which will not be delaye d or refused by [CONTACT_1034].  However, the Investigator may 
contact [CONTACT_724918] e blind to discuss unblinding, mainly in the 
interest of the subject.  
The investigator should ensure that the code is  broken only in accordance with the protocol.  The 
investigator should promptly notify the Medica l Monitor of the emergency unblinding and the 
reason for breaking the blind, which should be cl early documented by [CONTACT_292054]’s source documentation. 
Emergency unblinding should only be performed by [CONTACT_724919] (IRT) by [CONTACT_724920] y unblinding personal identification number 
(PIN), and the Investigator should ca ll IRT for unblinded dose information. 
PDA-[ADDRESS_989545]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: [ADDRESS_989546] ice (GCP), as described in International 
Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guideline E6 and in accordance with the general ethical 
principles outlined in the Declaration of He lsinki. The study will receive approval from an 
IRB/EC prior to commencement. The Investigat or will conduct all aspects of this study in 
accordance with applicable national, state, and local  laws of the pertinent regulatory authorities. 
14.2. Investigator Responsibilities 
Investigator responsibilit ies are set out in the ICH Guidelin e for Good Clinical Practice and in 
the local regulations.  Celgene staff or an author ized representative will ev aluate and approve all 
Investigators who in turn will select their staff. 
The Investigator should ensure that all persons assist ing with the study are adequately informed 
about the protocol, amendments, study treatments , as well as study-relate d duties and functions, 
including obligations of confidentiality of Celgene informati on. The Investigator should maintain 
a list of Sub-investigators and other appropriately qua lified persons to whom he or she has 
delegated significant study-related duties. 
The Investigator is responsible fo r keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a record of all subject s who sign an informed consent 
form (ICF) and are screened for entry into the study.  Subjects who fail screening must have the 
reason(s) recorded in the subject’s source documents. 
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, mu st be available during 
monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries  and allow direct access to subject records (eg, 
medical records, office charts, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_452095], and study-related ch arts) for source data 
verification.  The Investigator mu st ensure timely and accurate completion of CRFs and queries. 
The information contained in the protocol and amendments (with the exception of the 
information provided by [CONTACT_184689]) is considered Celgene confidential 
information.  Only information that is previ ously disclosed by [CONTACT_724921] a public registry 
website may be freely disclosed by [CONTACT_184691], or as outlined in the Clinical 
Trial Agreement.  Celgene protocol, amendment and IB information is not to be made publicly 
available (for example on the Investigator’s or th eir institution’s website)  without express written 
approval from Celgene.  Information proposed for posting on the Invest igator’s or his/her 
institution’s website must be submitted to Celg ene for review and approva l, providing at least 5 
business days for review. 
At the time results of this study are made available to the public; Celgene will provide 
Investigators with a summary of the results that is  written for the lay person.  The investigator is 
responsible for sharing these results  with subjects and/or their careg iver as agreed by [CONTACT_423]. 
PDA-[ADDRESS_989547]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: [ADDRESS_989548] and/or a subject’s legal representative 
prior to any study related procedures. 
Documentation that informed consent occurred pr ior to the study subjec t’s entry into the study 
and of the informed consent process should be r ecorded in the study subject’s source documents 
including the date.  The orig inal informed consent documen t signed and dated by [CONTACT_724922] s ubject’s entry into the 
study, must be maintained in the Investigator’s st udy files and a copy given to  the study subject.  
In addition, if a protocol is amended and it impa cts on the content of the informed consent, the 
informed consent document must be revised.  Stu dy subjects participating in the study when the 
amended protocol is implemented must be re-cons ented with the revised version of the informed 
consent document.  The revised informed consent document signed and dated by [CONTACT_724923]’s 
study files and a copy give n to the study subject. 
14.4. Confidentiality 
Celgene affirms the subject's right to protecti on against invasion of privacy and to be in 
compliance with ICH and other local  regulations (whichever is mo st stringent). Celgene requires 
the Investigator to permit Celgene's representa tives and, when necessary, representatives from 
regulatory authorities, to review and/or copy any medical records rele vant to the study in 
accordance with local laws. 
Should direct access to medical records require a waiver or authorization separate from the 
subject’s signed informed consent document, it is the responsibility of th e Investigator to obtain 
such permission in writing from  the appropriate individual. 
14.5. Protocol Amendments 
Any amendment to this protocol must be approved by [CONTACT_184693]/Medical Monitor.  Amendments will be submitted to the IRB/EC for written approval.  
Written approval must be obtained before implementation of the amended version occurs.  The 
written signed approval from th e IRB/EC should specifically refe rence the Investigator name, 
protocol number, study title and amendment number(s) that is a pplicable. Amendments that are 
administrative in nature do not require IRB/IE C approval but will be submitted to the IRB/IEC 
for information purposes. 
14.6. Institutional Review Board/Inde pendent Ethics Committee Review 
and Approval 
Before the start of the study, the study protoc ol, informed consent document, and any other 
appropriate documents will be submitted to the IRB/ EC with a cover letter or a form listing the 
documents submitted, their dates of issue, and the site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as 
applicable) for which approval is sought. If appl icable, the documents will also be submitted to 
the authorities in accordance w ith local legal requirements. 
PDA-[ADDRESS_989549]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: [ADDRESS_989550] of the 
members of the IRB/EC and their occupation and qualifications. If the IRB/EC will not disclose 
the names, occupations and qualifications of th e committee members, it should be asked to issue 
a statement confirming that the composition of the committee is in accordance with GCP. For 
example, the IRB General Assurance Number ma y be accepted as a substitute for this list. 
Formal approval by [CONTACT_1201]/EC should mention th e protocol title, number, amendment number 
(if applicable), study site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as app licable), and any other 
documents reviewed. It must mention the date on which the decision was made and must be 
officially signed by a committee member. Before the first subject is en rolled in the study, all 
ethical and legal require ments must be met. 
The IRB/EC and, if applicable, th e authorities, must be informed of all subsequent protocol 
amendments in accordance with local legal requi rements. Amendments must be evaluated to 
determine whether formal approval must be s ought and whether the informed consent document 
should also be revised. 
The Investigator must keep a r ecord of all communication with the IRB/EC and, if applicable, 
between a Coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_17446] I RB/EC. This statement also applies to any 
communication between the Inves tigator (or Coordina ting Investigator, if  applicable) and 
regulatory authorities. 
Any advertisements used to recruit subjects for the study must be reviewed by [CONTACT_27734]/EC prior to use. 
14.7. Ongoing Information for Instituti onal Review Board / Ethics 
Committee 
If required by [CONTACT_27735]/EC, th e Investigator must submit to the IRB/EC: 
 Information on serious or unexpected a dverse events as soon as possible  
 Periodic reports on the progress of the study 
 Deviations from the protocol or anything that may involve added risk to subjects 
14.8. Termination of the Study 
Celgene reserves the right to terminate this study at any time for reasonable medical or 
administrative reasons. Any premature discon tinuation will be appropriately documented 
according to local requirements (eg, IRB/ EC, regulatory authorities, etc).  
In addition, the Investigator or Celgene has the right to disconti nue a single site at any time 
during the study for medical or ad ministrative reasons such as: 
 Unsatisfactory enrollment; 
 GCP noncompliance; 
 Inaccurate or incomplete data collection; 
PDA-[ADDRESS_989551]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015   Falsification of records; 
 Failure to adhere to the study protocol. 
 
PDA-[ADDRESS_989552]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  15. DATA HANDLING AN D RECORDKEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
15.1. Data/Documents 
The Investigator must ensure that the record s and documents pertaining to the conduct of the 
study and the distributio n of the investigational product ar e complete, accurate, filed and 
retained.  Examples of source documents include : hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]; clinic and office charts; 
laboratory notes; memoranda; subject’s diaries or evaluation checklists; dispensing records; 
recorded data from automated instruments; copi[INVESTIGATOR_724880]; microfiche; x-ray film and reports; and records kept at the pharmacy, and 
the laboratories, as well as copi[INVESTIGATOR_81648]-ROM. 
15.2. Data Management 
Data will be collected via eCRF and entered into  the clinical database per Celgene SOPs. This 
data will be electronically ve rified through use of programme d edit checks specified by [CONTACT_109396].  Discrepancies in the data will be brought to the at tention of the c linical team, and 
investigational site personnel, if necessary.  Reso lutions to these issues will be reflected in the 
database.  An audit trail within the system  will track all changes made to the data. 
15.3. Record Retention 
Essential documents must be retained by [CONTACT_72651] a minimum of [ADDRESS_989553] retain these 
documents for the time period described above or  according to local laws or requirements, 
whichever is longer.  Essential documents include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 Signed informed consent documents for all subjects 
 Subject identification code list, screening log (if applicable), and enrollment log 
 Record of all communications between the Investigator and the IRB/EC 
 Composition of the IRB/EC 
 Record of all communications between the In vestigator, Celgene, and their authorized 
representative(s) 
 List of sub-investigators and other appropriately qualif ied persons to whom the 
Investigator has delegated si gnificant study-related duties, to gether with their roles in 
the study, curriculum vitae,  and their signatures

(Essential Documents for the C onduct of a Clinical Trial) 
The Investigator must notify Celgene if he/she wishes to assign the essential documents to 
someone else, remove them to another location or is  unable to retain them for a specified period.  
The Investigator must obtain approval in writi ng from Celgene prior to  destruction of any 
records. If the Investigator is unable to meet this obligation, th e Investigator must ask Celgene 
for permission to make alternative arrangement s. Details of these arrangements should be 
documented.  
All study documents should be made available if  required by [CONTACT_27737]. 
Investigator/Institution should take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of 
these documents. 
PDA-[ADDRESS_989555]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: [ADDRESS_989556] udy are reviewed with the Inves tigator and the staff at a study 
initiation visit and/or at an investigator meeti ng.  Prior to enrolling subjects into the study, a 
Celgene representative will review the protocol , eCRFs, procedures for obtaining informed 
consent, record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and reporting of AEs/ SAEs with the Investigator.  Monitoring will 
include on-site visits with the Investigator and his/her staff as we ll as any appropriate 
communications by [CONTACT_2319], email, fax, or telephone .  During monitoring visits, the facilities, 
investigational product storage area, eCRFs, subject’s source documents, and all other study 
documentation will be inspected/reviewed by [CONTACT_724924]. 
Accuracy will be checked by [CONTACT_724925] a direct comparison of 
the entries made into the eCRFs against the appropriate source documentation.  Any resulting 
discrepancies will be reviewed with the Invest igator and/or his/her staff.  Any necessary 
corrections will be made directly to the eCRFs or  via queries by [CONTACT_11219]/or his/her 
staff. Monitoring procedures requ ire that informed consents, a dherence to inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and documentation of SAEs and their proper recording be verified.  Additional 
monitoring activities may be outlined in a study-specific monitoring plan. 
16.2. Audits and Inspections 
In addition to the routine monitoring procedur es, a Good Clinical Practice Quality Assurance 
unit exists within Celgene.  Repr esentatives of this unit will conduc t audits of clinical research 
activities in accordance with Celg ene SOPs to evaluate compliance with Good Clinical Practice 
guidelines and regulations. 
The Investigator is requ ired to permit direct access to the f acilities where the study took place, 
source documents, eCRFs and applicable supporti ng records of study subj ect participation for 
audits and inspections by [CONTACT_1744]/ IECs, regulatory authorities (e g, FDA, European Medicines 
Agency (EMA), Health Canada) and company aut horized representatives.  The Investigator 
should make every effort to be available for the a udits and/or inspections.  If the Investigator is 
contact[CONTACT_462853], he/she should contact [CONTACT_184696]. 
PDA-[ADDRESS_989557]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: [ADDRESS_989558] authorship, will be based on 
several considerations, including, but not limited to, contribution to protocol development, study 
recruitment, data quality, participation in da ta analysis, participation on the study steering 
committee (when applicable) and contribution to abst ract, presentation and/or publication 
development.

Appendix A: American Diabetes A ssociation (ADA) and World Health 
Organization (WHO) Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 Definition 
 
Diagnostic Criteria by [CONTACT_724926] (ADA) ( ADA, 2014 ) include the 
following: 
1. A fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level of 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) or higher,  
or 
2. A 2-hour plasma glucose level of 200 mg/d L (11.1 mmol/L) or higher during a 75-g oral 
glucose tolerance test (OGTT),  or 
3. A random plasma glucose level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher in a subject with 
classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis  or 
4. HbA1C of 6.5%. The test shoul d be performed in a laboratory using a method that is 
National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Pr ogram (NGSP) certified  and standardized 
to the Diabetes Control and Co mplications Trial (DCCT) assay. 
Whether a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of 6.5%  or higher should be a primary diagnostic 
criterion or an optional criterion remains a point of controversy.  
WHO Definition 
Currently HbA1c is not considered a suitable di agnostic test for diabetes or intermediate 
hyperglycemia. 
The following summarizes the 2006 WHO recomme ndations for the diagnostic criteria for 
diabetes and intermediate hyperglycemia (WHO 2006). 
Diabetes Fasting plasma glucose   
1. 2–h plasma glucose* ≥7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl) 
or 
2. ≥11.1mmol/l (200 mg/dl) 
Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) 
Fasting plasma glucose 2–h plasma glucose
a 
1. <7.0 mmol/l (126mg/dl) and ≥7.8 and <11.1 mmol/l (140 mg/dl and 200 mg/dl) 
PDA-[ADDRESS_989562]-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) 
Fasting plasma glucose 2–h plasma glucosea,b  
1. 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/l (11 0mg/dl to 125 mg/dl)  
and 
2. (if measured) <7.8 mmol/l (140 mg/dl) 
a Venous plasma glucose 2–h after ingestion of 75 g oral glucose load. 
b If 2–h plasma glucose is not measured, status is un certain as diabetes or IGT cannot be excluded.

Severity Scale  
 
 
 
International Clinical Diabetic Re tinopathy Disease Severity Scale  
Proposed Disease Severity Level  Findings Observable upon Dilated 
Ophthalmoscopy  
No apparent retinopathy No abnormalities 
Mild nonproliferative diabetic re tinopathy Microaneurysms only 
Moderate nonprolif erative diabetic 
retinopathy More than just microaneurysms but less than 
severe NPDR 
Severe nonproliferative diabetic  retinopathy Any of the following: 
 More than 20 intraretinal hemorrhages in 
each of four quadrants 
 Definite venous beading in two or more 
quadrants 
 Prominent IRMA in one or more quadrants 
And no signs of prolifer ative retinopathy 
Proliferative diabetic retinopath y One or both of the following: 
 Neovascularization 
 Vitreous/preretinal hemorrhage 
IRMA = intraretinal microvascul ar abnormalities; NPDR = nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy.

Class Patient Symptoms 
Class I (Mild) No limitation of physical activity.  Ordinary physical activity does not cause 
undue fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], or dyspnea (shortness of breath). 
Class II (Mild) Slight limitation of physical activity.  Comfortable at rest, but ordinary physical 
activity results in fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], or dyspnea. 
Class III (Moderate) Marked limitation of physical activity.  Comfortable at rest, but less than 
ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], or dyspnea. 
Class IV (Severe) Unable to carry out any physical activity without discomfort.  Symptoms of 
cardiac insufficiency at rest.  If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.

The following recommendations are made with the understanding that the investigator or 
designee will use his/her ow n judgment on how best to administer the treatment. 
 Subjects will be treated with IP administ ered intramuscularly (IM) on Study Days 1, 
29 and 57.  
 The target region on the limb is belo w the knee and above the ankle in the 
gastrocnemius or soleus muscle.  
 Injections are to be at least [ADDRESS_989572] the deeper end of the range; for thin subjects, 
inject toward the shallower end of the range. 
 PDA-002 is not intended for intravenous (IV) administration.  When  the injection is 
given, the syringe should be aspi[INVESTIGATOR_724886] a void inadvertent venous  administration.  If 
any blood is aspi[INVESTIGATOR_440095], the needle is to be  pulled out a little, and the 
syringe reaspi[INVESTIGATOR_3831]. If no blood is observed the IP may be injected. 
 Injections are to be administered in a pa ttern of 3 x 5 injections around the leg and 
injections should not be near  a blood vessel.  See diagram above for injection pattern.

WHAT  IS HEREDITARY  ANGIOEDEMA (HAE) ?  
 
WHAT TREATMENT DID REASEARCHERS WANT TO STUDY ? 
 
In this study, researchers tested a new medicine called donidalorsen .  
Donidalorsen  is a type of medicine called an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO). An ASO 
medication helps reduce the amount of a specific protein  in the body called prekallikrein  
by [CONTACT_784408] (mRNA)  that contains instructions to make that protein . 
Donidalorsen  specifically attaches to the mRNA that contains instructions for making 
PKK and signals the cell to  break  down  that mRNA , reducing the amount of PKK 
produced . This reduction in PKK leads to a decrease in the amount of bradykinin, lowering 
the chance for swelling . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Donidalorsen  for Hereditary  Angioedema  
 
Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare and very serious disease that causes sudden and sometimes dangerous 
swelling in different parts of the body, like the face, throat, stomach, arms, and legs. The swelling is random, 
painful, comes back again and again, and can be life -threatening, especially if swelling occurs in the throat. These 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_784372] a patient’s life.  
This long -term illness is due to a problem in a specific gene called SERPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]1that encod es a protein called C1 
inhibitor . This protein helps to control other proteins in our blood that manage inflammation and swelling. When 
the SERPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]1 gene  does not work properly, the body either does not make enough of the C1 inhibitor protein 
(this form of the disease  is called HAE-C1INH  Type  1) or the protein does not work correctly ( this form of the 
disease is called HAE -C1INH  Type  2). When the body does not have enough working C1 inhibitor protein, it 
produces too much of a molecule called Factor XIIa. Too much Factor XIIa causes another protein called 
prekallikrein (PKK) to become active and turn into kallikrein. Kallikrein is an en zyme, which is a special protein that 
helps speed up reactions in the body. Kallikrein cuts a larger protein called high -molecular -weight ki ninogen into a 
substance called bradykinin. Large amounts of bradykinin cause blood vessels to widen and cause uncontrolled 
painful swelling of different body parts called HAE attacks.  
 
WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE ? 
 Researchers wanted to know how well 
donidalorsen  could effectively  and safely  help 
people suffering from HAE attacks  compa red with 
placebo . 
 © Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Page 1 What was the main question researchers 
wanted to answer?  
 
What was the number of Investigator -
confirmed HAE attacks (per 4 weeks) 
from Week 1 to Week 25 for participants 
receiving donidalorsen 80  mg every 4 
weeks compared with the pooled 
placebo group?  HOW  WAS THIS STUDY D ESIGNED ? 
 • Phase 3 : A Phase [ADDRESS_1078843] studies to be conducted 
before a new medicine is submitted to government agencies for 
approval. The study tests the new medicine in participants with the 
disease to be treated by [CONTACT_784409].  
• Randomized : Participants were randomly assigned to a treatment in 
the study by [CONTACT_3364] (like rolling a specific number on a die).  
• Placebo -controlled : Patients were randomly assigned to receive 
placebo at the same amount and frequency as the patients receiving 
donidalorsen . All steps of the study were the same for all groups, 
allowing researchers to see differences between the medicine and 
no active treatment.  
• Double -Blind : Neither researchers nor participants knew if the 
participant was receiving the real medicine ( donidalorsen ) or a 
placebo .

experienced 
≥ 2 HAE attacks 
during this period 
and completed all 
evaluations that 
ensured they were 
eligible to enroll in 
the study.  8-WEEK 
SCREENING 
PERIOD  24-WEEK TREATMENT  PERIOD  13-WEEK FOLLOW 
UP PERIOD  
Participants were randomly assigned to receive 
donidalorsen or placebo:  
 
Donidalorsen Group 1 had 45 participants.  
 
Donidalorsen Group 2 had 23 participants.  
 
Placebo Group: had 22 participants. All patients who 
received placebo either every 4 weeks or every 8 weeks 
were pooled together for data analyses .  
 
Participants had check -up visits at certain weeks to see 
how they were doing and if they had any medical 
problems. They also filled out questionnaires to talk 
about any symptoms they experienced while receiving 
treatment.  HOW WAS THIS STUDY DONE ? 
 
Participants could  
attend check -up visits at 
the study clinic sites at 
weeks 4, 8, and 1 3 during 
the 1 3-week follow -up 
period, or could choose to 
enroll in the open -label 
extension (OLE) study 
(OASISplus,

What were the results of  this study?  
Donidalorsen  – Group 1  
(donidalorsen  80 mg every 4 weeks ) 
 
The average HAE attack rate (per 4 weeks) from Week 1 to 
Week 25 for Donidalorsen Group 1 ( donidalorsen  80 mg 
every 4 weeks) was 0. 44 compared with 2.2 6 for the 
placebo group.  
Answer to the main question  asked : 
 
The Donidalorsen Group 1 had an 81% reduction in HAE attacks 
relative to the placebo group. This reduction was considered 
significant.  
The average HAE attack rate (per 4 weeks) from 
Week 1 to Week 25 for Donidalorsen Group 2 
(donidalorsen  80 mg every 8 weeks) was 1. 02 
compared with 2.2 6 for the placebo group. The 
Donidalorsen Group 2 had a 55% reduction in 
HAE attacks relative to the placebo group. This 
reduction was considered significant.  
 
Overall, the results show that donidalorsen  80 
mg administered every 4 weeks or every 8 
weeks significantly reduced the number of HAE 
attacks (per 4 weeks) compared with the 
placebo group.  Donidalorsen – Group 2  
(donidalorsen  80 mg every 8 weeks )

HOW HAS THIS STUDY HELPED PEOPLE WITH HAE AND RESEARCHERS ? 
 
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work and are 
safest for participants. This summary gives the results of [ADDRESS_1078845] more participants and may give different results.  
 
Overall, researchers learned that donidalorsen  at a dose of 80 mg taken every 4 weeks or 
every 8 weeks made a difference in reducing HAE attack rates compared with placebo.  
   
Researchers also found no serious safety concerns with donidalorsen  under the conditions 
of this study.  
 
The results from this study support the use of donidalorsen  as a possible ongoing 
(prophylactic) treatment to reduce the number of HAE attacks for people living with  HAE.  
Findings from this study may be used in other studies to learn more about the use of 
donidalorsen  in participants with HAE.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
ARE THERE PLANS FOR FURTHER STUDIES ?

Electrocardiography will be performed in triplicate.  Correction of inconsistency in the protocol.  
Section 6.3.1  All male patients and women of childbearing potential 
(WOCBP) must refrain from sperm/egg donation and either 
be abstinent† or practice effective acceptable contraception 
from the time of signing the informed consent and, as 
applicable, assent form until at least [ADDRESS_1078863] 24 weeks after the patient’s last dose of Study Drug, then it is not required for the male  patient to also 
use an highly effective  acceptable contraceptive method. 
For the purposes of the study, highly effective acceptable  
contraception is defined as follows: For male patients: 
 Acceptable highly effective male contraception 
includes a vasectomy with negative semen analysis at 
Follow-up, surgically sterile via bilateral 
orchidectomy, abstinence†, condom with 
spermicide or the non-pregnant female partner of 
child-bearing potential uses an acceptable  highly 
effective contraceptive method (defined below) 
 Male patients with partners that are pregnant must use condoms as contraception to ensure that the fetus is 
not exposed to the Study Drug  
For female patients and female partners of male patients,

Study Design  
This study is a randomized (ISIS 721744:placebo), double -blind, placebo -controlled trial 
conducted in multiple centers to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ISIS 721744 in preventing 
angioedema attacks in patients with HAE -1 (Type I) and HAE -2 (Type II).  Patients will be 
randomized 2:1 to Cohort A (3:1 ISIS 721744 80 mg or placebo every 4 weeks) or Cohort B 
(3:1 ISIS 721744 80 mg or placebo every 8 weeks).  
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
Key Inclusion Criteria

c. Oligonucleotides (including small interfering ribonucleic acid) within [ADDRESS_1078868] of exclusion criteria is provided in Section  5.2. 
Statistical Analyses  
The power and sample size estimations were calculated using simulations based on a generalized 
linear model for counting data assuming a Poisson distribution.  The primary analysis of the 
primary endpoint is to compare the time -normalized number of Investi gator -confirmed HAE 
attacks (per month) from Week 1 to Week 25 between ISIS 721744 80 mg every 4 weeks and 
pooled placebo.  Assuming an HAE attack rate of 13.26 attacks per 6 -month period in the pooled 
placebo group and an HAE attack rate of 1.38 attacks p er 6-month period in the ISIS 721744 
80 mg every 4 weeks group, the sample size of 54 patients (2:1 ratio [ISIS 721744:placebo]) will 
provide more than 90% power for the primary endpoint, with a two -sided 0.05 significance level.  
ISIS 721744 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 2  
Protocol   12 July 2022  
 
16 A total of approximately 84 patients (42 in the ISIS 721744 every 4 weeks group, 21 in the 
pooled placebo group, and 21 in the ISIS 721744 every 8 weeks group) will be enrolled in this 
trial to account for potential early dropouts and to facilitate some general safety evaluations.    
Multiplicity Comparisons/Multiplicity  
The multiplicity for primary and secondary analyses will be controlled by [CONTACT_784415] 0.05.  The testing sequence for the secondary endpoints will be specified in 
the SAP.  
Analysis of  Primary Endpoint  
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint is to compare the time -normalized number of 
Investigator -confirmed HAE attacks (per month) from Week [ADDRESS_1078869] for treatment group (categorical), the time normalized run -in period attack 
rate (continuous) as a covariate, and t he logarithm of time in month that each patient was

2. BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE  
2.1. Overview of Disease  
Hereditary angioedema is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by [CONTACT_84186][INVESTIGATOR_84145], painful ab dominal attacks, and, occasionally, laryngeal attacks 
that can be life -threatening.  The disorder is classified in 3 subtypes.  Hereditary angioedema 
Type  I (HAE -1) and Type II (HAE -2) are caused by [CONTACT_84187][INVESTIGATOR_1645]1  gene, resu lting in either decreased levels of C1 -INH (HAE -1) or loss -of-function of 
this protein (HAE -2) (Bissler et al. 1997 ).  The third form of HAE is associated with norma l 
levels and function of C1 -INH (HAE -nC1-INH).  This form is currently categorized as 
4 subtypes, with either specific genetic mutations in the factor XII gene, the plasminogen gene, 
or the angiopoietin -1 gene, or due to an unknown cause (Maurer et al. 2018 ).  Extensive 
evidence from in vitro and in vivo  studies supports the key role of bradykinin (BK) in HAE 
attacks, although the data linking HAE -nC1-INH with BK are less strong (Zuraw and 
Christiansen 2016 ).  Diagnosing HAE -nC1-INH can be challenging given the large heterogeneity 
of this patient population, the lack of diagnostic tests, and the fact that specific genetic mutations 
account only partially for the occurrence of this type of HAE.  Recently, a threshold -stimulated 
kallikrein activity assay was shown to discriminate BK -mediated angioedema from 
histamine -mediated angioedema (Lara‑Marquez et al. 2018 ).  This technique may, therefore, 
ISIS [ADDRESS_1078875].  
Treatment options for HAE include on -demand treatment of attacks and prophylaxis.  
On-demand options include supplementation of C1 -INH (either plasma -derived or recombinant 
C1-INH concentrate) and inhibition of BK2 receptor activation (BK2 -receptor antagonist).  In 
addition, tranexamic acid may relieve symptoms in non -severe angioedema attacks.  
Prophylactic regimens for HAE include plasma -derived C1 -INH concentrate (administer ed either 
intravenously or subcutaneously [SC]), attenuated androgens, antifibrinolytics and a monoclonal 
antibody directed against plasma kallikrein (PKa) and a small molecule inhibitor of PKa.  
Kallikrein circulates in plasma as a zymogen (i.e., PKK) whi ch is bound to one of its main 
substrates, high molecular weight kininogen (HK).  Prekallikrein (PKK) is cleaved upon contact 
[CONTACT_84188], forming the active protease PKa.  Plasma kallikrein cleaves HK in turn, thereby 
[CONTACT_784417] (cHK).  The binding 
of BK to the BK2 receptor leads to activation of various intracellular signaling pathways 
resulting in vasodilation, chemotaxis of neutrophils, and increased vascular permeability and 
fluid efflux, w hich typi[INVESTIGATOR_784377] (Zuraw and Christiansen 2016 ). 
2.2. Therapeutic Rationale  
ISIS 721744 is a 2 -O-(2 methoxyethyl) (2′ -MOE) chimeric phosphorothioate (PS) -modified 
second -generation antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) designed to bind to the messenger 
ribonucleic acid (mRNA ) of PKK, a protease in the contact [CONTACT_57501].  By [CONTACT_784418], ISIS  721744 reduces the release of BK, a potent vasodilator that increases vascular 
permeability resulting in swelling and pain associated with HAE attacks.  
The Phase 1 clinical data show that ISIS 721744 inhibits plasma PKK effectively in a 
dose-dependent manner without safety concerns.  Validation of this mechanism has been 
demonstrated in a recently completed 12 -week Phase 2 study of ISIS  721744 in adult HAE 
patients with recur rent attacks, ISIS 721744 -CS2, in which once -every -4-weeks ISIS 721744 
administration showed 90% reduction in HAE attacks compared to placebo.  
2.3. ISIS 721744  
2.3.1.  Mechanism of Action  
ISIS 721744 is a chimeric 2ʹ -MOE ASO targeted to PKK  mRNA.  The ASO is covalently  
bonded to triantennary GalNAc, a high -affinity ligand for the hepatocyte -specific ASGPR, to 
form an ASO -GalNAc conjugate.  This GalNAc conjugate approach results in enhanced ASO 
delivery to hepatocytes vs. non -parenchymal cells and has increased ASO poten cy by 
[CONTACT_3450] 10 -fold in mice (Prakash et al. 2014 ) and up to 30 -fold in humans (Crook e et al. 
2018 ) compared to unconjugated ASOs.  The ASO portion of ISIS  721744 is fully 
complementary to a  base-pair position 1019 -1038 of the  Genbank NM_000892.3 sequence 
spanning a portion of Exon 9 of the PKK -mRNA and binds to the mRNA by [CONTACT_784419] C rick 
base pairing.  The hybridization (binding) of ISIS  721744 to the cognate mRNA results in the 
ribonuclease H1 (RNase H1) -mediated degradation of the PKK  mRNA, thus preventing 
production of the PKK protein.  Antisense -mediated reduction of target mRNA l evels is 
predictable and dose -dependent.  Maximal inhibition of greater than 90% of control levels is 
ISIS 721744 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 2  
Protocol   12 July 2022  
 
24 typi[INVESTIGATOR_784378] (Crooke and Bennett 1996 ; Zhang et al. 2010 ).  
Furthermore, reduction in targe t mRNA levels using this approach correlates directly with a 
subsequent reduction in target protein levels.  
2.3.2.  Chemistry  
ISIS 721744 is a GalNAc -conjugated 2ʹ -MOE ASO.  The oligonucleotide portion of the drug 
consists of 20 nucleotides (i.e., a 20 -mer).  Of t he nineteen (19) internucleotide linkages, 15 are 
3′-O to 5′-O phosphorothioate diesters, and 4 are 3′ -O to 5′-O phosphate diesters.   
Structurally, the conjugated oligonucleotide has 4 regions.  Within 2 of the regions, the 
5 nucleotides at the 5′ end and  the 5 nucleotides at the 3′ end, are composed of 
2′-O-(2-methoxyethyl) (2′ -MOE) -modified ribonucleotides.  These MOE -modified nucleotides 
confer (i)  increased affinity for the target mRNA (Altmann et al. 1996 ; McKay et al. 1999 ), 
(ii) increased resistance to exonucleases and endonucleases (thereby [CONTACT_784420]) (Geary et al. 2003 ), and (iii)  amelioration of some of the high dose toxicities thereby 
[CONTACT_784421] d safety profile compared to first generation antisense drugs containing 
phosphorothioate modified oligodeoxynucleotides (DNA) (Henry et al. 2000 ).  The third region, 
the central portion of the oligonucleotide, is composed of 10 oligodeoxynucleotides.  This 
chimeric design is called a MOE -Gapmer , and ISIS  721744 employs this chimeric structure to 
enable use of the RNase H1 mechanism for antisense activity.  The 2′ -MOE modification confers 
increased stability and affinity but does not support RNase H1 catalyzed cleavage of RNA 
hybridized to 2′ -MOE -modified nucleotides (McKay et al. 1999 ).  This is caused by 
[CONTACT_37802] 2′ -alkoxy -RNA hy brids that are not 
recognized by [CONTACT_37695] H1 enzymes (Inoue et al. 1987 ; Monia et al. 1993 ).  By [CONTACT_37761] 
2′-MOE modification to nucleotides flanking the phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide cor e, 
the beneficial attributes of the 2′ -MOE chemistry are preserved while also retaining RNase H1 
recognition.  
The fourth region is comprised of a triantennary cluster of GalNAc sugars which is linked to the 
5′ end of ISIS  721744 via a phosphodiester linkag e.  The GalNAc cluster is a high affinity ligand 
for the ASGPR, a receptor expressed primarily on the surface of liver hepatocytes (Stockert 
1995 ).  The GalNAc cluster enhances de livery of ISIS  721744 to liver hepatocytes over other 
cell types and enhances potency.  After internalization into cells, the GalNAc cluster is 
metabolized to release “free ASO” inside the cell (Prakash et al. 2014 ). 
The internucleosidic linkages are a mixture of phosphorothioate and phosphodiester.  The 
phosphorothioate linkages are introduced into the DNA gap region and at both ends of the 
oligonucleotide to protect it from nuclease mediated metabolism.  The mixed backbone design 
reduces the total number of phosphorothioate linkages which reduces non -specific interactions 
with proteins and further enhances the therapeutic index of GalNAc -conjugated ASOs.

2.3.3.  Preclinical Experience  
Detailed information concerning t he preclinical studies conducted with PKK ASO ISIS  546254 
(parent unconjugated compound), its 5ʹ -GalNAc 3-conjugated mixed backbone variant 
ISIS 721744, and mouse surrogate PKK ASOs can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
The results support the concep t that inhibition of PKK through antisense mechanism may serve 
as a new and effective strategy for the prophylaxis of HAE.  Results also strongly support that 
GalNAc 3-conjugation of PKK ASO significantly increases the potency of ASO for inhibition of 
PKK h epatic mRNA and circulatory protein expression and thus these ASOs should be a useful 
therapeutic strategy for the prophylactic treatment of HAE.  
2.3.4.  Clinical Experience  
ISIS 721744 has been evaluated in the clinical setting in a Phase 1 safety study 
(ISIS  721744-CS1) and Phase 2 study (ISIS  721744 -CS2).   
Phase 1:  ISIS 721744 was studied in 32 healthy volunteers in a double -blind, multiple -dose, 
dose-escalation study.  Of these, 24 subjects received multiple doses of ISIS 721744.  The 
32 subjects were randomi zed into 4 cohorts (6 subjects each) to receive once -every -4-week SC 
doses of ISIS  721744 20, 40, 60, or 80 mg, or placebo (8 subjects) for a total of 12  weeks (4 total 
doses).  All subjects received all planned doses of Study Drug (ISIS  721744 or placebo) .  The 
duration of Study Drug exposure was [ADDRESS_1078876].  
No serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in the ISIS 721744 -CS1 study.  There were no 
early discontinuations from Study Drug or the study, and all subjects in the ISIS 721744 and 
placebo arms completed all study procedures.  Adverse events at the injection site (defined as 
ISIS 721744 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 2  
Protocol   12 July 2022  
 
26 any preferred term containing “injection site”) were the most commonly reported 
treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the ISIS 721744 treatment arms; no inj ection 
site-related TEAEs were reported in the placebo arm.  There were no flu -like reactions or events 
of local cutaneous reaction at injection site (LCRIS) reported; LCRIS events were defined as 
(A) moderate or severe injection site erythema, swelling, p ruritus, pain, or tenderness that started 
on the day of injection and persisted for at least 2 days; or (B) any AE at the injection site, 
regardless of severity, that led to discontinuation of Study Drug, where AE at the injection site 
was the principal re ason for discontinuation.  No relationship between incidence of TEAEs and 
the dose administered was observed.  
Thirteen (13) AEs related to study treatment were reported for 4 (16.7%) subjects in the 
ISIS [ADDRESS_1078877] (2 events; 12.5%) in t he placebo arm.  One (1) subject each 
in the ISIS  [ADDRESS_1078878] inversion (preferred term) that 
were assessed as related.  Nine (9) of the total [ADDRESS_1078879] in the 80  mg arm.  Additional related 
events were Tinnitus ([ADDRESS_1078880], 1 event in the 60 mg arm), Headache ([ADDRESS_1078881], 1 event in the 
60 mg arm), and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] ([ADDRESS_1078882], 1 event in the 20  mg arm).  All TEAEs related to stud y 
treatment were mild in severity, and none were serious.  
ISIS 721744 resulted in a dose -dependent reduction of PKK concentration and plasma 
proenzyme activation.  The difference in absolute and percent change from Baseline for 
ISIS 721744 vs. placebo was statistically significant for PKK concentration for 40, 60, and 
80 mg (p ≤ 0.043) starting at Day 15, the first evaluation, and for 20 mg starting at Day 29, and 
for plasma proenzyme activation for all doses (p ≤ 0.002) starting at Day 15.  The nadir was 
generally reached around Day 71, when the percent reduction with the 80 mg dose was -93.2% 
for PKK concentration and -99.6% for plasma proenzyme activation.  The difference in absolute 
and percent change from Baseline in cHK for ISIS 721744 vs. placebo was not statistically 
significant at any visit.  
Phase 2 :  ISIS 721744 was evaluated in a double -blind placebo -controlled trial in patient with 
HAE Type I and II in Part A and in an open -label treated patients with HAE -nC1-INH (or 
Type  III).  Clinical data demo nstrated a significant degree of efficacy of ISIS 721744 80 mg 
administered once every -4-weeks for 4 months in reducing the rate of HAE attacks in Type I and 
Type II HAE patients with recurrent attacks over a 16 -week (Week 1 -17) period vs. placebo 
(90% red uction in number of HAE attacks compared to placebo; p < 0.001).  The percentage of 
patients who were HAE attack -free from Week 5 to Week 17 was 92.3% as compared to none of 
the patients treated with placebo.  There was also a significant reduction, 95%, i n patient treated 
with ISIS 721744 in the need for use of acute therapi[INVESTIGATOR_784379]. placebo treated 
patients.  Additionally, the number of moderate to severe attack was also markedly reduced with 
a 96% reduction in ISIS [ADDRESS_1078883] common TEAE was headache.  All the 
TEAEs had resolved by [CONTACT_2054].  No LCRIS or flu -like reacti ons were reported.  No 
deaths or SAEs were reported.  There were no clinically relevant changes in the safety 
laboratories, such as chemistry, hematology, coagulation, complement, inflammatory markers, 
urinalysis, ECG, or vital sign.   
ISIS 721744 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 2  
Protocol   12 July 2022  
 
27 Overall, ISIS 721744  was efficacious and well -tolerated in these patients with HAE.  
Eligible patients from ISIS 721744 -CS2 are continuing to receive the drug for an additional 
2 years in the open -label extension  (OLE) study, ISIS 721744 -CS3.  
Investigator Initiated Trial:   Additionally, evidence was provided of efficacy in [ADDRESS_1078884] with the unconjugated parent ASO, IONIS -PKK Rx, (ISIS 546254) followed by 
[CONTACT_784422] -conjugated ASO, IONIS -PKK -LRx (ISIS 721744; (Cohn et al. 2020 ).  
In both patients, IONIS -PKK Rx and IONIS -PKK -LRx showed clinical efficacy by [CONTACT_784423].   
2.4. Rationale for Dose and Schedule of Administration  
The dose level of 80 mg every 4 weeks was selected based on the safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) data from the ISIS [ADDRESS_1078885] dose level of 80 mg produced near c omplete reduction of plasma PKK levels (a 
mean reduction of 93.6% from Baseline on Day 99 [[ADDRESS_1078886] dose]) in healthy 
volunteers.  In the Phase 2 study in HAE  patients, the dose level of 80 mg resulted in a mean 
plasma PKK reduction of about 60% from Baseline on Day 113, 4  weeks after a total of 4 doses 
(administered every 28 days) with no corresponding attacks reported for most patients.  This 
suggests that the 80 -mg dose administered every 4 weeks results in sufficient target knockdown 
to ac hieve near -complete prevention of attacks in these patients.  Additionally, the mean plasma 
PKK levels correlated well with the mean attacks/month (clinical endpoint) over time.  A second 
dosing regimen of 80 mg every 8 weeks is included in this study to e valuate the efficacy and 
safety of a reduced dosing frequency.  This dosing schedule was selected based on the 
ISIS721744 -CS3 open -label study (open -label study extension of the ISIS 721744 -CS2 study) 
that evaluated the same dosing regimen.  In the CS3 stu dy, [ADDRESS_1078887] remained attack free.  This suggests that patients could potentially benefit from 
this alternative dosing regimen with a reduced dosing frequency.  Both dosing schedules (80 mg 
every 4 weeks and 80 mg every 8 weeks) have been generally well -tolerated in these patients.  
The estimated half -life (t ½) of ISIS 721744 is approximately 4 to 5 weeks, thus supporting these 
dosing schedules as well.  Minimal to no correlation was observed between ISIS 721744 
clearance and exposure with body weight across healthy volunteers and patients combined 
suggesting that a flat dose of 80 mg is appropriate across the entire popula tion of this study.  The 
dose and schedule are also supported by [CONTACT_26423] -chronic and chronic toxicity studies in mice and 
monkeys of up to 6 - and 9 -months dosing duration, respectively.  For an 80 -mg monthly dose in 
adult humans (70 kg), the safety margin is a pproximately 21 -fold and 32 -fold based on the dose 
and area under the curve  (AUC) respectively at NOAEL in the 9 -month monkey study.  
Additionally, the safety margin would still be over 20 -fold for patients with lower body weight 
ISIS 721744 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 2  
Protocol   12 July 2022  
 
28 (~35 kg patients) based on  a conservative body weight - based AUC predicted from population 
PK modeling.  
2.5. Benefit -Risk Assessment  
2.5.1.  Overall Assessment of Benefit:Risk  
The preclinical, Phase 1, and Phase [ADDRESS_1078888] demonstrated a favorable 
risk-benefit profile, with n o safety signals identified in clinical trials on hematological 
parameters, liver function, or renal function.  In the completed Phase 2 study of ISIS 721744 in 
HAE patients, AEs, including those at the injection site, were balanced between groups and no 
severe AEs were reported and all TEAEs had resolved by [CONTACT_2054].  There were no 
clinically relevant changes in the safety laboratories, such as chemistry, hematology, 
coagulation, complement, inflammatory markers, urinalysis, or ECGs, nor in vit al signs.  No 
safety or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_784380], liver or bleeding.  No deaths or SAEs were 
reported.  Overall, in this trial, ISIS 721744 was safe and well -tolerated in patients with HAE.  In 
the ongoing Phase 2 OLE study of ISIS  721744 , a continued favorable safety and tolerability 
profile has been demonstrated, with no platelet (PLT), liver function, or renal function signals 
identified.  
The conjugated nature of ISIS  721744 allows specific targeting of ASO to hepatocytes so, that 
for similar hepatocyte exposure, reduced exposure to both non -parenchymal liver cells and 
systemic exposure has the potential to lower PKK with an enhanced tolerability profile over the 
parent molecule, ISIS 546254.   
Nevertheless, regular monitoring of PLT cou nts, liver chemistry, and renal function, and 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_213264]  8.5 and Section  8.6. 
Taking into account the measures taken to minimize risk to patients participating in this study, 
the potential risks identified in association with ISIS 72 1744 are justified by [CONTACT_84193].  
Detailed information concerning the benefit -risk assessment of ISIS 721744 can be found in the 
Investigator’s Brochure.   
2.5.2.  Additional Risks During the COVID -[ADDRESS_1078889] been identified that would cause termination of treatment during the 
COVID -19 Pandemic at this time.  
There could be risk however, for patie nts who are participating in a clinical trial such as 
ISIS 721744 -CS5.  There may be risks to patients traveling to research sites.  Sites should follow 
their specific regional guidance (i.e., institutional, local, state, federal, country -level, as 
applica ble) with regard to receiving patients for clinical trials.  Visits should continue as long as 
it is deemed safe to do so.  Provision will be available for patients to be treated or evaluated in 
their homes by a home healthcare professional.  Additional mi tigation steps and a study pause 
may be necessary as conditions warrant.  If a study patient becomes infected with COVID -19 or 
develops COVID -19-related symptoms, the patient should notify the study staff/Investigator or 
ISIS 721744 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 2

29 designee and notify their treating Physician that they are participating in a clinical trial with 
ISIS 721744.  
3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
3.1. Study Design  
This study is a randomized (ISIS 721744:placebo), double -blind, placebo -controlled trial 
conducted in multiple centers to evaluate the efficacy and s afety of ISIS 721744 in preventing 
angioedema attacks in patients with HAE -1 (Type I) and HAE -2 (Type II) HAE.  Patients will be 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio to Cohort A (ISIS 721744 or placebo every -4-weeks) or Cohort B 
(ISIS  721744 or placebo every 8 weeks) , respectively.  Within each Cohort, patients will be 
randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive 80mg of ISIS 721744 or matching volume of placebo.  
Patients who discontinue treatment will attend the Early Termination (ET) Visit and will be 
encouraged to complet e the Post -Treatment Period unless consent or assent is withdrawn.  
Detailed information regarding the study procedures is presented in Section  [ADDRESS_1078890] -Treatment Periods.  Please refer to the 
Schedule of Procedures in Appendix  A. 
Patients may be required to attend additional visits for monitoring of AEs or abnormal 
investigation results.  The frequency of additional monitoring will be determined by [CONTACT_784424] . 
The length of each patient’s participation in the study is approximately [ADDRESS_1078891]-Treat ment Period, unless the patient chooses to enroll in the OLE study.  
3.4.1.  Screening  
After the informed consent (ICF) and, in the case of participants not of legal age, assent is 
signed, the patient will be assessed for eligibility according to the Schedule of Procedures in 
Appendix  A.  The Screening Period is up to 56 days in duration .  A patient may be randomized 
after fewer than 56 days from the screening visit if the patient experiences ≥ [ADDRESS_1078892] administration of Study Drug on 
Study Day  1 and will continue to receive Study Drug once every 4 (Cohort A) or 8 (Cohort B) 
weeks during the 25 -week Treatment Period.  Patients will return to the Study Center (or Home 
Healthcare, if available) for treatment visits to complete assessments and dosing per the Schedule 
of Procedures in Appendix  A.  In regions where Home Healthcare is available to patients, a 
training curriculum will be developed with input from the Sponsor and all Home Healthcare 
provi ders will be trained prior to conducting any study related assessments/procedures.  This 
training will be documented and filed as appropriate.  
3.4.3.  Post-Treatment  
Patients are to return to the Study Center for post -treatment follow -up visits (or Home 
Healthcare, if available), as arranged by [CONTACT_37747], per the Schedule of 
Procedures in Appendix  A.  Alternatively, patients who complete Study Visit Week 25, and meet 
eligibility requirements, may enroll in the OLE study any time after the Week [ADDRESS_1078893] (DSMB) will be assembled to review safety, tolerability, 
and efficacy (as needed) data collected on ISIS  721744 during this study.  Based on its ongoing 
assessment of the safety and tolerability of ISIS  721744, the DSMB wil l provide 
recommendations to the Sponsor for modifying, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], or continuing the study as planned.  
Details on the safety assessments, frequency of review, meeting schedules, and controlled access 
to unblinded data are outlined in the DSMB Charter and S tatistical Analysis Plan (SAP).

31 4. PATIENT ENROLLMENT  
4.1. Screening  
Before patients may be enrolled into the study, the Sponsor or designee requires a copy of the 
Study Center’s written Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
approval of the protocol, ICF and, as applicable, assent form, and all other patient information 
and/or recruitment material.  
Patients, or their legally appointed and authorized representatives, will sign and date an ICF, and 
when appropriate, an assent form  before  any screening tests or assessments are performed.  Race 
and Ethnicity data will be collected as part of the demographic information for all screened 
patients during the Screening Period.  At the time of consent and, as applicable, assent, the 
patient will  be considered enrolled into the study and will be assigned a unique screening number 
before any study procedures, including screening procedures, are performed.  At the time of 
randomization, patients will be assigned a unique patient identification numbe r.  This number 
will be used to identify the patient throughout the study and must be used on all study 
documentation related to that patient.  The screening number and patient identification number 
must remain constant throughout the entire study.   
In the event the patient is re -consented and as applicable, re -assented and re -screened, the patient 
must be given a new screening number.  Screening numbers, once assigned, will not be re -used.  
4.2. Randomization  
Patients will be randomized, after all  screening ass essments have been completed and after the 
Investigator or designee  has verified that they are eligible per the criteria in Section  5.1 and 
Section  5.2.  No patient may begin treatment prior to randomization  and assignment of a unique 
patient identification number.   
Approximately 84  patients with HAE -1/HAE -2 will be randomized via the IRT system to SC 
injections of ISIS 721744 80 mg or placebo.  Approximately 56  patients will be randomized to 
every -4-week dosing (Cohort A) and 28 patients will be randomized to every -8-week dosing 
(Cohort B).  Withi n each Cohort, patients will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive 80 mg of 
ISIS 721744 or matching volume of placebo.  For purposes of planned analyses, the placebo 
patients from each Cohort will be pooled for comparison to ISIS 721744 treated patients.  
Randomization information will be concealed from the Investigators  or designees  and patients 
until the end of the study, with the exception of an emergency situation involving a patient that 
requires unblinding of the treatment assignment.  
4.3. Replacement of Patients  
Patients who withdraw from the study will not be replaced.  
4.4. Unblinding of Treatment Assignment  
The Sponsor and all patients, monitors, and Study Center personnel related to the study (except 
for the DSMB, statistical/programming support staff) will  be blinded throughout the study until 
all patients have completed the study and the database has been locked.  Representatives from 
ISIS [ADDRESS_1078894] patient has completed the end of the Treatment 
Period (Week 25/Tx -ET) as descri bed in the Unblinding Plan.  Those Sponsor representatives 
will no longer be involved in the conduct of the study after they have been unblinded.  However, 
if a patient has suffered an SAE (as defined in Section  9.3.3 ), and/or when knowledge of the 
treatment assignment will impact the clinical management of the patient, the Investigator will 
have the ability to unblind the treatment assignment for that patient via the IRT system.  
The Sponsor or designee will be informed of the unblinding of a patient within 24  hours.  An 
unblinded randomization schema will be maintained securely at the Sponsor’s designated 
vendor.  In addition, all suspected unexpected s erious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be 
unblinded by [CONTACT_213316] (see 
Section  9.2). 
Every reasonable attempt should be made to complete the ET study procedures and observations 
(see Appendix  A) prior to unblinding, as knowledge of the tr eatment arm could influence patient 
assessment.

6.1. Study Schedule  
All required study procedures are outlined in  Appendix  A. 
The safety of ISIS 721744 will be continually monitored throughout the study by [CONTACT_784427].  
The lengt h of each patient’s participation from Screening to the last study visit is up to 
approximately [ADDRESS_1078900] of assessments to be completed during Screening is provided in Appendix  A.  All patient -
reported outcomes asse ssments should be completed at the beginning of each (as appropriate) 
visit.  
During the Screening Period (up to 56 days), patients must experience a minimum of 2  HAE 
attacks (confirmed by [CONTACT_737]) to be eligible for the study; patients will be ins tructed to 
report details of any HAE attack to the study site within [ADDRESS_1078901] been 
completed and the patient meets all other eligibility requirements; in such cases, the Screening 
Period may be sho rter than 56 days.  Once eligibility has been confirmed, patients will be

37 6.2. Study/Laboratory Assessments  
6.2.1.  Laboratory Assessments  
Laboratory analyte samples will be collected throughout the study.  A list of these analytes is 
contained in  Appendix  B.   
If the PLT value, serum creatinine, or liver enzyme tests are uninterpretable (e.g., due to 
clumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007], hemolysis, or quantity not sufficient) or missing, a repeat blood specimen should be 
redrawn as soon as possible (ideally within 7 days) either in clinic or by [CONTACT_144359] (if 
available) or local laboratory.  
All PLT count results, and liver and renal function tests, must be reviewed promptly (within 
48 hours of receipt) by [CONTACT_119576], or designee, to ensure that the result has not met the 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877].  
All lab alerts received, including those related to PLT, liver, or renal function 
monitoring/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], are also reviewed promptly by [CONTACT_213323].  Within 24 hours of receiving an actionable lab 
alert the CRO Medical Monitor will communicate instructions to the Investigator or designee 
and the study personnel by [CONTACT_784430] /study personnel and promptly returned to 
the Sponsor and CRO Medical Monitor.  In urgent cases, such as PLTs results below 
50,000/mm3, or liver or renal test results reaching a critical stoppi [INVESTIGATOR_1877], the Investigator or 
designee must also be contact[CONTACT_3012].  
Investigators or designees  may, at their discretion, test specific laboratory parameters which may 
be prone to clotting, clumpi[INVESTIGATOR_213268] (e.g., hematology samples) at their local laboratory, 
in addition to the required central laboratory samples.  In these instances, the local laboratory 
results should be recorded by [CONTACT_213319].  Assays which are blinded 
should not be locally tested and recorded into the database (e.g., PKK).  All lab sample results 
from the site’s local laboratories are received by [CONTACT_213322]’ 
standard reporting time, and should be entered as soon as possible (ideally within 1  week) into 
the electron ic Case Report Form (eCRF) to inform the Sponsor and CRO study monitoring teams  
Further information on safety monitoring and actions to be taken by [CONTACT_784431]  8.5.3  and Section  8.6.3 . 
6.2.2.  Physical Exams and Vital Signs  
Phys ical exams and vital signs will be performed as indicated in the Schedule of Procedures 
(Appendix  A).  Vital signs should include weight, blood pressu re, pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_37557].  Blood pressure and pulse rate will be recorded per the standard practice of the 
Study Center.  Blood pressure should always be measured on the same arm (preferentially on the 
left arm).  Height will b e measured at Screening and for pediatric patients at Week 25.  
ISIS 721744 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 2  
Protocol   12 July 2022  
 
38 6.2.3.  Electrocardiography  
Electrocardiography will be conducted at Screening, Day 1 (prior to the first dose of Study 
Drug), and again during the Treatment Period and at the Post -Treatment Period vis its as outlined 
in Appendix  A.   
Electrocardiography will be recorded per the standard practice of the Study Center.   
6.2.4.  Pharmacokinetic Sampling  
Blood samples for the determination of plasma ISIS [ADDRESS_1078909] -Treatment Periods, detailed information on each 
HAE attack will be collected including the number of HAE attacks that required on -demand 
treatment and the details of any on -demand treatment used (frequency and dosing).  For each 
HAE attack, the following data will be collected:   
• Date/time of sy mptom onset  
• Location and description of symptoms:  
− Peripheral angioedema:  cutaneous swelling involving an extremity, face, neck, 
torso, and/or genitourinary region  
− Abdominal angioedema:  abdominal pain, with or without abdominal distension, 
nausea, vomitin g, or diarrhea  
− Laryngeal angioedema:  stridor, dyspnea, difficulty speaking, difficulty 
swallowing, throat tightening, or swelling of the tongue, palate, uvula, or larynx  
• HAE attack severity:  
− Mild:  transient or mild discomfort  
− Moderate:  mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance needed  
− Severe:  marked limitation in activity, assistance required  
• Need for assistance, medical intervention, ER visit, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Medications to treat the attack  
• HAE attack course, including if the HAE attac k(s) in question was a typi[INVESTIGATOR_84148], or if there was an alternative diagnosis  
• Date/time symptoms resolved  
ISIS 721744 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 2  
Protocol   12 July 2022  
 
39 The presence of these symptoms, including symptoms in one or more of the above locations, will 
not automatically be considered an HA E attack unless such a diagnosis is confirmed by [CONTACT_3786].  The investigator may feel that the presence of these symptoms does not represent a 
HAE attack if there are features that strongly refute such a diagnosis.  For example, if the 
reported eve nt is accompanied by [CONTACT_784432] (e.g., 
urticaria); if the reported event persists well beyond the typi[INVESTIGATOR_784382] 
(e.g., greater than 7 days); or if there is a likely alternative etiology fo r the event (e.g., viral 
gastroenteritis).   
An HAE attack will be defined as an event with signs or symptoms consistent with an attack in at 
least [ADDRESS_1078910] 24 -hour 
symptom -free period between attacks.  
6.2.6.  Patient -Reported Outcomes  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Angioedema Quality of Life (AE -QoL) Questionnaire  
Quality of life (QOL) will be assessed by [CONTACT_84204] -QoL questionnaire during Screening, 
Treatment, and Post -Treatment Periods as outlined in Appendix  A.   
The AE -QoL questionnaire is a validated tool to assess symptom -specific health -related QOL 
impairment in patients suffering from recurrent angioedema (Weller et al. 2013 ).  The AE -QoL 
is a self-administered questionnaire that can be completed in less than 5 minutes; it comprises 
17 questions across 4 domains:  functioning, fatigue/mood, fears/shame, and food.  The AE -QoL 
can be used to calculate scores for the 4 individual domains and can al so be used to determine a 
total score.  The AE -QoL will be completed by [CONTACT_102].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Angioedema Control Test (AECT) Questionnaire  
The AECT is a validated patient -reported outcome instrument to assess disease activity in 
patients with recurrent angioedema (Weller et al. 2020 ) which will be assessed during the 
Treatment and Post -Treatment Periods as outlined in Appendix  A.  The AECT is easy to 
administer and fast to complete.  The questionnaire consists of four questions asking about the 
frequency and severity of angioedema experienced in the prior month.  Each question has 
[ADDRESS_1078911] can be used to identify patients with poorly controlled disease by 
[CONTACT_638121] a cutoff value of greater than or equal to 10 points.  Patients who score less than 
10 points (0 -9) in the AECT have poorly controlled disease whereas  patients with controlled 
disease score [ADDRESS_1078912] will be completed by [CONTACT_102].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Angioedema Activity Score (AAS)  
Patients will be instructed on the use of the AAS questionnaire during Screening and will record 
their HAE attacks using the AAS questionnaire to confirm study eligibility.  The AAS 
questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_701562] (minimum of 4  daily asse ssments per week) 
during the Screening, Treatment, and Post -Treatment Periods.   
During the Screening Period, patients must experience a minimum of 2 HAE attacks (assessed 
by [CONTACT_84180]) to be eligible for the study.  
ISIS [ADDRESS_1078913] to complete.  Using the AAS questionnaire, patients score eac h of 5 key 
symptoms -related factors from 0 to 3, resulting in a total daily score of 0 to 15 (Weller et al. 
2013 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Additional PROs  
Additional instruments that will be used to collect information from patients during the 
Treatment and Post -Treatment Periods are summarized in this section.  Timing of these 
assessments is outline in Appendix  A.  Generic health -related QOL will be assessed using the 
EQ-5D-5L.  The PGIC and the PGIS scales will also be administered throughout the study.  The 
PGIC and PGIS scales are administered for pur poses of PRO validation and estimation of 
minimal important difference (MID).  A Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD -7) questionnaire 
will be administered to evaluate anxiety experienced by [CONTACT_1962].  The GAD -7 is a self -
administered patient questionnaire,  and it is used as a screening tool and severity measure for 
generalized anxiety disorder.  Pharmacoeconomics will be assessed by [CONTACT_784433] (WPAI) questionnaire.  ER visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_784383] 1.   
6.3. Restriction on the Lifestyle of Patients  
6.3.1.  Contraception Requirements  
All male patients and women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must refrain from sperm/egg 
donation,  and either be abstinent† or practice acceptable contraception from the time of signing 
the informed consent and, as applicable, assent form until at least [ADDRESS_1078914] 24 wee ks after the patient’s last dose of 
Study Drug, then it is not required for the male  patient to also use an acceptable contraceptive 
method . 
For the purposes of this study, females of childbearing potential are defined as any female who 
has experienced men arche, and who does not meet one of the following conditions:  
• Postmenopausal:  12  months of spontaneous amenorrhea in females > 55 years of age 
or, in females ≤ 55 years, 12  months of spontaneous amenorrhea without an 
alternative medical cause and FSH levels in the postmenopausal range for the 
laboratory involved  
• 6 weeks after surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy  
• Post-hysterectomy  
ISIS 721744 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 2  
Protocol   12 July 2022  
 
41 For the purposes of the study, acceptable contraception is defined as follows:  
For male patient s: 
• Acceptable male contraception includes a vasectomy with negative semen analysis at 
Follow -up, surgically sterile via bilateral orchidectomy, abstinence†, condo m with 
spermicide or the non -pregnant female partner of child -bearing potential uses an  
acceptable contraceptive method (defined below)  
• Male patients with partners that are pregnant must use condoms as contraception to 
ensure that the fetus is not exposed to the Study Drug  
For female patients and female partners of male patients, acceptable contraception methods 
comprise:  
• Surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], bilateral oophorectomy), hormonal contra ception  associated with 
inhibition of ovulation (progestogen -only [female patients with HAE]  or combined 
estrogen and progesterone [female partners of male patients] ), intrauterine 
contraception device or intrauterine hormone -releasing system or a vaginal ring (as 
long as the patient has been using this contraceptive method for at least 3 months 
before Screening) or vasectomized partner with negative semen analysis at follow -up, 
male or female condom with spermicide; or cap, diaphragm, or sponge with 
spermi cide.  Female patients with HAE cannot use estrogen containing oral, 
subcutaneous, or transdermal contraceptives in this study.  
†Note:  Abstinence (i.e., refraining from heterosexual intercourse throughout the duration of 
study participation) is only accept able as true abstinence, i.e., when this is in line with 
the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, 
ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the 
duration of a trial and wi thdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
Note:  A female condom and a male condom should not be used together as friction 
between the 2 can result in either or both products failing  
6.4. Emergency Provisions  
During an emergency, such as a pandemic, natural or man -disasters (i.e., earthquake, industrial 
accident), weather events (i.e., hurricanes, typhoons), terrorist acts/acts of war, etc., the 
following changes to this protocol are allowed without formal amendment to the protocol, 
provided all Inter national Conference on Harmonization (ICH), Good Clinical Practice (GCP), 
and regulatory requirements associated with the study are upheld.   
• Remote Assessments and At -Home visits :  Scheduled clinic visits may be replaced by 
[CONTACT_213311] (via video conference or telephone call), or at -home visits, or a 
combination thereof, provided that these are properly documented.  This may be 
accomplished by [INVESTIGATOR_136] -home visits by [CONTACT_213312], with 
incorporation of videoconference o r telephone assessments by [CONTACT_784434] 721744 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 2  
Protocol   12 July 2022  
 
42 • Randomization:  When a participant is found to be eligible for the study, the decision 
regarding if and when randomization will occur is based on the judgment of the 
Investigator or designee  in cons ultation with the Sponsor.  Randomization may be 
delayed by [CONTACT_8622] 1 month without rescreening  
• Study Drug Administration :  To support Study Drug administration at home, delivery 
of Study Drug to a participant may be undertaken at the discretion of the Inves tigator or 
designee , based on local and regional regulations for transporting investigational product  
• Safety Assessments :  Every effort should be made to continue performing safety 
assessments on schedule.  This may require remote assessments (e.g., for adverse events 
and concomitant medications) by [CONTACT_37714], and it may require at home visits 
(e.g., for blood draw s, urine samples, physical examination, vital signs) by [CONTACT_784435].  Which safety assessments are considered critical, for 
example to support a decision on whether to administer the next scheduled dose of Study 
Drug, is  to be determined on a case -by [CONTACT_784436]  
• Other Assessments:  Every effort should be made to perform the assessments related to 
primary or secondary endpoints on schedule  
• Reporting of Protoco l Deviations:  All protocol deviations that are caused by a public 
health emergency should be documented as such; for example, include in the description 
of the protocol deviation that it is related to COVID -19.  The impact of such protocol 
deviations on t he study is to be summarized in the clinical study report.  This summary is 
considered sufficient notification of the EC/IRB for minor protocol deviations that were 
caused by a public health emergency  
• Immunization:  Immunization of participants with a vacc ine for an epi[INVESTIGATOR_901]/pandemic 
may occur while participants are on study, however it is preferable that a separation of at 
least 7  days occurs between administration of the vaccine and administration of Study 
Drug.  Adjustment of the Study Drug schedule may be considered in order to achieve this 
separation in consultation with the Sponsor  
An event requiring institution of emergency provisions is based on the judgement of the 
Investigator or designee  in consultation with the Sponsor.  The determination of when  an 
emergency has resolved to sufficient extent such that these allowances are no longer needed is 
also based on the judgment of the Investigator or designee  in consultation with the Sponsor.

Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_213269]  8.6. 
Please refer also to the ‘Guidance for Investigator’ section of the Investigator’s Brochure . 
• For the purposes of safety monitoring baseline is defined as the average of the pre -dose 
Study Day [ADDRESS_1078915] value prior to Study Day 1  
• In addition to the standard monitoring of clinical safety parameters, the following 
guidelines are provided for the monitoring of selected parameters chosen based on 
preclinical and clinical observations  
• In case of discrepancy between the test results from [ADDRESS_1078916] be initiated based on the more critical 
(lower or higher, as relevant) of the 2 values  
Confirmation Guidance :  At any time during the study (Treatment or Post -Treatment Periods), 
the initi al clinical laboratory results meeting the safety monitoring criteria presented below must 
be confirmed by [CONTACT_10533] (ideally in the same laboratory that performed the 
initial measurement) on new specimens.  All new specimen collections should take place as soon 
as possible (ideally within 3 days of the initial collection).  For stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004],  if the initial 
laboratory result is observed during the Treatment Period, the results from the retest must be 
available prior to administering the next dose of Study Drug (ISIS 721744).  
Re-dosing Guidance :  Patients with initial laboratory test values tha t reach a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10447] -dosed until the re -test results are available.  In general, patients who do not meet the 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10448].  However, the Investigator or designee 
and the Sponsor Medical Monitor (or  appropriately qualified designee) should confer as to 
whether additional close monitoring of the patient is appropriate.  If any of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_784384]  8.6 are met, the patient will be permanently discontinued from further 
treatment with Study Drug (ISIS 721744), evaluated fully as outlined below and in consultation 
with the Sponsor Medical Monitor or appropriately qualified desi gnee, and will be followed up 
in accordance with Section  8.8 of the Protocol.   
8.5.1.  Safety Monitoring Rules for Liver Chemistry Tests  
The following rules a re adapted from the draft guidance for industry, “Drug -Induced Liver 
Injury:  Premarketing Clinical Evaluation,” issued by [CONTACT_941] U.S.  Department of Health and Human 
Services, Food and Drug Administration, July 2009.  For a definition of Baseline please refe r to 
guidance in Section  8.[ADDRESS_1078917] liver chemistry tests monitored every 4 weeks during the Treatment 
Period.  Upon completion of the study Treatment Period, liver chemistry tests should be 
monitored as per visit schedule in Appendix  A. 
In the event of appearance of symptoms or  signs of hepatic injury (jaundice, fatigue, nausea, 
vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, abnormal bleeding or bruising, or 
eosinophilia > ULN) liver enzymes and bilirubin should be tested as soon as possible (ideally 
within 3 da ys).  Testing at a lab that is local to the patient is permissible for this purpose.  
In the event of an ALT or AST measurement that is > 3 × ULN (or the greater of 2 × baseline 
value or 3 × ULN if the baseline value was > ULN) at any time during the study (Treatment or 
Post-Treatment Period), the initial measurement(s) should be confirmed as described above.  
Additional confirmatory measurements should also be performed if ALT or AST levels increase 
to 5 × ULN.  
Frequency of Repeat Measurements :  Patients wi th confirmed ALT or AST levels > 3 × ULN (or 
the greater of 2 × baseline value or [ADDRESS_1078918] if the baseline value was > ULN) should have their 
liver chemistry tests (ALT, AST, Alkaline Phosphatase  (ALP), international normalized ratio 
[INR], and total biliru bin) retested at least once -weekly until ALT and AST levels become 
≤ 1.2 × ULN or 1.2 × baseline value if the baseline value was > ULN].  
Further Investigation into Liver Chemistry Elevations :  For patients with confirmed ALT or AST 
levels > 3 × ULN (or the  greater of 2 × baseline value or 3  × ULN if the baseline value was 
> ULN), the following evaluations should be performed:  
1. Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior and concurrent diseases  
2. Obtain further history for concomitant drug use (includi ng nonprescription medications, 
herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and 
special diets  
3. Obtain a history for exposure to environmental chemical agents and travel  
4. Serology for viral hepatitis (hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin M [ IgM], hepatitis B 
surface antigen [ HBsAg], Hepatitis C Virus  antibody, cytomegalovirus IgM , and EBV 
antibody panel)  
5. Serology for autoimmune hepatitis (e.g., antinuclear antibody [ANA])  
Additional liver evaluations, including gastroenterol ogy/hepatology consultations, hepatic 
computerized tomography  (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) scans, may be performed 
at the discretion of the Investigator or designee, in consultation with the Sponsor Medical 
Monitor.  Repetition of the above eva luations should be considered if a patient’s ALT and/or 
AST levels reach 5 × ULN.  
The Study Drug must be interrupted until all evaluations and consultation with the Sponsor 
Medical Monitor is complete.  
All lab alerts for abnormal liver function tests must be promptly reviewed by [CONTACT_47362]  (within 48 hours of receipt) and Medical Monitor(s) (within 24 hours of receipt) as 
described in Section  6.2.1 .

46 Lab alerts for abnormal liver chemistry tests will be issued for:  1) ALT or AST > 3  × ULN; 
2) ALT or AST > 2  × baseline; 3) total bilirubin > ULN.  These alert levels are set to anticipate 
the risk of a combined elevation of aminotransfer ases and bilirubin as per the FDA Guidance 
referenced in Section  8.[ADDRESS_1078919] renal function tests monitored every 4 weeks during 
the Treatment and Follow -up Periods as per visit schedule in Appendix  A. 
In the event of appearance of symptoms or signs consistent with renal dysfunction such as 
hematuria, polyuria, anuria, flank pain, new -onset hypertension, nausea and/or anorexia, renal 
function should be tested as soon as possible (ideally within 3 days) .  Testing at a lab that is local

Consider more frequent monitoring if additional 
risk factors for bleeding are present.*  
* The suitability of the patient for interrupted and/or continued dosing will be determined by [CONTACT_784439]’s PLT count, whether any bleeding events were experienced by [CONTACT_102], and the speed 
of recovery of PLT count after interruption of do sing.  
** Recovery in platelet count may be accelerated by [CONTACT_24629] -dose glucocorticoids.  Treatment as 
recommended by [CONTACT_784440] (ASH) (2019 ) guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia 
(Blood Advances, 10 DECEMBER 2019, Volume 3, Number 23) includes initial therapy with either 
dexamethasone 40 mg per d ay for 4  days, or prednisone 0.5 to 2.0 mg/kg per day.  Prednisolone or prednisone 
may be administered for up to 2 to 4 weeks with taper; alternatively, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be 
administered at 0.4  g/kg/d for 5 days, or infusions of 1 g/kg/ d for 1 -2 days (Provan et al. 2010 ; Provan et al. 
2019 ). 
 
There will be lab alerts for PLT values under 100,000/mm3.

48 8.5.4.  Safety Monitoring for Bleeding Events  
Patients will be evaluated for occurrence of bleeding events continuously after the start of Study 
Drug treatment (Day 1) up to the end of the Follow -up Period.  All bleeding events are 
considered AEs and reported on the AE case report form (CRF).  
If an event of major bleeding (MB) or clinically relevant non -major b leeding (CRNMB) event 
occurs ( as defined below) , the Investigator or designee must notify the Medical Monitor (or 
designee) and the patient should be treated, as needed, immediately and closely monitored (vital 
signs, lab tests such as hemoglobin ( Hb), hematocrit , and PLT count, additional visits, overnight 
stays and coagulation tests may be needed  if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_1963] ) 
throughout the Treatment and Post -Treatment Periods and an (S)AE CRF will be completed.  In 
addition, approximat ely [ADDRESS_1078923] be stored allowing for a centralized assessment of ISIS  721744 concentrations.  
If a minor bleeding event occurs, the Investigator or designee  should notify the Medical Mon itor 
(or designee) and additional testing of coagulation parameters (activated partial thromboplastin 
time [aPTT], prothrombin time [PT], INR), PLT count, and PLT volume may be performed.  
Major bleeding is defined as one of the following (Schulman and Kearon 2005 ): 
1. Fatal bleeding  
2. Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial, intraspi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], 
intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraarticular if in a major joint, or perica rdial, or 
intramuscular with compartment syndrome  
3. Clinically overt bleeding leading to transfusion of ≥ 2 units of packed RBCs or whole 
blood or a fall in Hb of 20 g/L (1.24 mmol/L) or more within 24 hours  
Clinically relevant non -major bleeding  is defined as any sign or symptom of hemorrhage (e.g.  
more bleeding that would be expected for a clinical circumstance, including bleeding found by 
[CONTACT_3868]) that does not fit the criteria for MB but does meet at least one of the following 
criteria (Kaatz et al. 2015 ): 
1. Requiring medical intervention by a healthcare professional  
2. Leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3820]  
3. Prompting a face to face (i.e., not just a telephone or electronic communicati on) 
evaluation  
Minor bleeding  events are those that do not fulfill the criteria for MB or CRNMBs (defined 
above), for example excess bruising, petechiae, gingival bleeding on brushing teeth.  
8.6. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_784385]  8.5. 
For the purposes of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], Baseline is defined as the average of the pre -dose Study 
Day [ADDRESS_1078924] value prior to Study Day  1.

alternative explanation as discussed with the Sponsor Medical Monitor,  dosing of a patient 
with Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) will be stopped perman ently; values that are not 
confirmed due to failure to retest or missing lab values will be presumed confirmed:  
1. ALT or AST > 8 × ULN, which is confirmed  
2. ALT or AST > 5 × ULN, which is confirmed and persists for ≥ [ADDRESS_1078925] > 3 × ULN (or the greate r of 2 x baseline value or 3 × ULN if the baseline 
value was > ULN), which is confirmed and total bilirubin > 1.5 × ULN or INR > 1.[ADDRESS_1078926] > 3 × ULN (or the greater of [ADDRESS_1078927] if the baseline 
value was > ULN), which is confirmed,  and the new appearance (i.e., onset coincides 
with the changes in hepatic enzymes) of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant 
pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or concomitant eosinophilia (> ULN)  
8.6.2.  Temporary Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_784387] a persistent elevation that is observed over 2 consecutive weeks, for either  of the 
2 criteria below, dosing of a patient with Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) may be stopped 
temporarily:  
1. Serum creatinine increase that fulfills all of the following criteria:  ≥ 0.3 mg/dL 
(26.5  μmol/L) and ≥ 40% above baseline creatinine values and > ULN (refer to 
definition of Baseline in Section  8.6) 
2. UPC R >1000  mg/g, confirmed by a quantitative total urine protein measurement of 
> 1.0 g/24 hours  
The possible dosing re -initiation or follow -up schedule for any events meeting either of these 
criteria will b e determined by [CONTACT_784441] . 
8.6.3.  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_37563] a low PLT count are summarized in Table  2 above.  
8.6.4.  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_784388] (see definitions in Section  8.5.4  as assessed by [CONTACT_117916] , dosing of a patient with Study Drug (ISIS  721744 or placebo) may be stopped 
permanently.  The follow -up schedule for any events meeting this stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_784389], inc luding the suitability of the patient for resumption of dosing by [CONTACT_784442] (or designee).

50 8.7. Adjustment of Dose and/or Treatment Schedule  
Down -titration of Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) will  not be allowed during the study.  
Dose adjustments for PLT count reduction must be made in accordance with Table  2. 
Other adjustments, including dose interruptions, will be allowed for safety or tolerability after 
consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor.  
8.8. Discontinuation of Study Drug/Treatment  
A patient must permanently discontinue study treatment for any of the following:  
• The patient becomes preg nant.  Report the pregnancy according to instructions in 
Section  9.5.4  
• The patient withdraws consent or assent  
• The patient withdraws from treatment (b ut does not withdraw consent or assent)  
• The patient experiences an AE that necessitates permanent discontinuation of Study 
Drug  
• The patient develops laboratory test abnormalities that meet any of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_213279]  8.6 
• The patient experiences an AE that necessitates unblinding of the Investigator or 
designee  or Sponsor to the patient’s treatment assignment  
The reason for discontinuation  of Study Drug must be recorded in the eCRF and source 
documentation.  
Patients who discontinue Study Drug will remain in the study and attend the Tx -ET Visit 
(Week  25 visit assessments) , unless consent or assent is withdrawn.  Any patient who 
discontinues early from the Treatment Period should be strongly encouraged to complete the 
Post-Treatment Period study visits, procedures and observations  (see Appendix  A). 
8.8.1.  Follow -up Visits for Early Termination from Treatment Period or 
Post-Treatment Period  
If a patient discontinues early from the Treatment Period, Treatment Early Termination (Tx -ET) 
visit assessments should be performed [ADDRESS_1078928] -Treatment Early 
Termination (Post -Tx ET) as sessments should be performed at the time of withdrawal in 
accordance with Appendix  A. 
ISIS 721744 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 2  
Protocol   12 July 2022  
 
51 8.8.2.  Temporary Pause/Safety Review  
The trial should be halted for a safety review based on the following criteria:  
• Death in any subject in which the cause of death is judged to be probably or definitely 
related to the study drug by [CONTACT_12707]  
• The occurrence in any subject of a life -threatening SAE that is as sessed to be related 
to the study drug by [CONTACT_12707]  
• Two occurrences of Grade 3 or higher toxicities that are assessed to be related to the 
study drug by [CONTACT_12707]  
• Two occurrences of a clinically significant Grade [ADDRESS_1078929] be withdrawn from study procedures for any of the following:  
• Withdrawal of consent or assent  
• The pa tient is unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol  
• The patient meets any of the Exclusion Criteria (see Section  5.2) after enrolling in the 
study that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_213280] a safety risk to the patient  
Other reasons for withdrawal of patients from the study may include the following:  
• At the discretion of the Investigator or designee  for medical reasons  
• At the discretion of the Investigator or designee  or Sponsor for non -compliance  
• Significant protocol deviation  
All efforts will be made to complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible up to 
the date of withdrawal.  All information, includ ing the reason for withdrawal from study, must be 
recorded in the eCRF.  
Any patient who withdraws consent or assent to participate in the study will be removed from 
further treatment and study observation immediately upon the date of request.  These patien ts 
should be encouraged to complete the respective ET study procedures (Week [ADDRESS_1078930] -
Treatment Week 13 visit assessments) and observations at the time of withdrawal (see 
Appendix  A). 
For patients withdrawn for reasons other than withdrawal of consent or assent, every effort 
should be made to complete the ET study procedures and observations at the time of withdrawal 
(see Appendix  A) and ideally within [ADDRESS_1078931] be re corded on the patient’s 
eCRF.  Adverse events related to administration of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_10459].

52 8.10.1.  Concomitant Therapy  
A concomitant therapy is any non -protocol -specified drug or substance (including o ver-the-
counter medications, herbal medications, and vitamin supplements) administered between 
Screening and the end of the Post -Treatment Period.  
Allowed Concomitant Therapy  
During the course of the study, the use of acute HAE medications (plasma -derived or 
recombinant C1 -INH concentrate, BK2 -receptor antagonist, or kallikrein inhibitor) to treat 
angioedema attacks is allowed as medically indicated.  Patients can be treated with on -demand 
therapy as determined by [CONTACT_24018].  
All other stable medications (if not excluded below) are allowed, so long as the dose and type is 
not expected to change during the study.  
Disallowed Concomitant Therapy  
1. Chronic prophylaxis for angioedema attacks, except for a stable dose of androgens or 
tranexamic acid.  Any chronic use of other HAE prophylactic agents such as 
lanadelumab or berotralstat will not be permitted during the Treatment Period.  
NOTE:  The use of acute HAE medications (plasma -derived or recombinant C1 -
INH concentrate, BK2 -receptor antagonist, or kallikrein inhibitor) to treat 
angioedema attacks is allowed as medically indicated  
2. ACE inhibitors or any estrogen -containing medications with systemic absorption 
(such as oral contraceptive or hormonal replacement therapy)  
3. Any oligonucleotides (including siRNA) other than ISIS  721744  
4. Any other investigational drug or device  
Patients should consult with the Investigator or designee prior to initiating any new medication, 
including non -prescription or herbal compounds or any non -drug therapy.  
8.10.2.  Concomitant Pro cedures  
A concomitant procedure is any therapeutic intervention (e.g., surgery/biopsy, physical therapy) 
or diagnostic assessment (e.g., blood gas measurement, bacterial cultures) performed between 
Screening and the end of the Post -Treatment Period.  
Disall owed Concomitant Procedures  
Plasma apheresis is not allowed during the study.  
8.11. Treatment Compliance  
Compliance with treatment dosing is to be monitored and recorded in the eCRF by [CONTACT_84217].

53 9. SERIOUS AND NON -SERI OUS ADVERSE EVENT RE PORTING   
9.1. Sponsor Review of Safety Information  
Safety information will be collected, reviewed, and evaluated by [CONTACT_144387]/or designee Standard Operating Procedures throughout 
the conduct of the clinical study.  
9.2. Regula tory Reporting Requirements  
The Sponsor  or designee  is responsible for regulatory submissions and reporting to the 
Investigators or designees  of SAEs including S[LOCATION_003]Rs per the ICH guidelines E2A and ICH 
GCP.  Country -specific regulatory requirements will be  followed in accordance with local 
country regulations and guidelines.  
Institutional Review Boards/Independent Ethics Committees will be notified of any SAE 
according to applicable regulations.  The DSMB will be notified of any SAE as specified in the 
DSMB  charter.  
In addition to the Investigator’s or designee’s  assessment of relatedness, the  Sponsor or designee 
will evaluate the available information and perform an independent assessment of all reported 
SAEs and determine if there is a reasonable possibili ty that the Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or 
placebo) is causally related to a reported SAE and, therefore, meets the definition of an S[LOCATION_003]R.  
While the Sponsor’s independent causality assessment may differ from the Investigator’s or 
designee’s  assessment, the c ountry -specific regulatory requirements must be followed for 
expedited reporting of S[LOCATION_003]R to local regulatory authorities.  
Appropriate personnel at the Sponsor  or designee  will unblind S[LOCATION_003]Rs for the purpose of 
regulatory reporting.  T he Sponsor or designe e will submit S[LOCATION_003]Rs to Regulatory Agencies in 
blinded or unblinded fashion according to local law.  The Sponsor  or designee  will submit 
S[LOCATION_003]Rs to Investigators or designees  in a blinded fashion.  
For the purpose of regulatory reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs, there are  not “expected” AEs in this study 
population.  Investigator’s Brochure (provided separately) for expected adverse events.  
SAEs due to HAE attacks will not be reported on an individual basis in an expedited manner 
because they are anticipated to occur in th e study population independent of the Study Drug 
(ISIS 721744 or placebo) exposure.  The Investigator or designee  still has the responsibility to 
report all SAEs to the Sponsor as described in Section  9.4.1  to Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
HAE attacks will be reported on a HAE attack CRF page and will not be reported as AEs.   
The Sponsor or designee and DSMB will monitor these protocol -specified SAEs using the 
incidence rate of the event in the study compared to the expected incidence rate in a non -Study 
Drug exposed patient population.  If the aggregate analysis indicates that an event is occurring 
more frequently or at a greater severity than expected, then the event will be reported.

Protocol   12 July 2022  
 
54 9.3. Definitions  
9.3.1.  Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of 
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the AE is considered related to the medi cinal 
(investigational) product.  
An adverse event can therefore be any of the following:  
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product  
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the character, 
frequency, or severity of a known condition)  
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not prese nt at 
Baseline  
• Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from Study Drug  
• Adverse events that are re lated to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g.,  screening invasive procedures 
such as biopsies)  
9.3.2.  Adverse Drug Reaction and Suspected Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  
Adverse Drug Reaction ( ADR)  
In the pre-approval  clinical experience with a new medicinal product or its new usages, 
particularly as the therapeutic dose(s) may not have been established, ADR is defined as follows:  
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product relat ed to any dose should 
be considered adverse drug reactions.  
The phrase "responses to a medicinal product" means that a causal relationship between the 
medicinal product and the adverse event has been determined by [CONTACT_10548] a 
reasonable possi bility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out.  
Suspected Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  
A suspected unexpected ADR is any ADR, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with 
the applicable product information, e.g., Investigator's Brochure for an unapproved medicinal 
(investigational) product.  
A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than an adverse 
reaction.  
ISIS 721744 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 2  
Protocol   12 July 2022  
 
55 9.3.3.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A SAE is any adverse event that in the view of either the Investi gator or designee  or Sponsor, 
meets any of the following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening:  that is, poses an immediate risk of death at the time of the event  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of 
either the Investigator or designee or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient  at 
immediate risk of death.  It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction t hat, 
had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10461] 24 hours to a medical 
facility and does not always  qualify as an AE  
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions  
• Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect in the offspring of the patient (whether 
the patient is male or fe male)  
• Important medical events  that may not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do 
not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10462], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require 
medical o r surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition.  Examples of such medical events include  allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an ER or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpati ent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.  
The terms "severe" and "serious" are not synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of an 
adverse event (e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE]; OR Toxicity Grading Scale 
for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials; the 
event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (su ch as severe headache without 
any further findings).  
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event recorded on 
the eCRF.  
9.3.4.  Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI)  
For the purpose of this study, severe reductions in PLT count < 50,000/mm3 accompanied by a 
MB event or CRNMB event, or PLT count of < 25,000/mm3 independent of a MB or CRNMB 
event, are considered as AEs of special interest (AESIs) and are subject to [ADDRESS_1078932] are required to be reported by [CONTACT_784443], within 24 hours of the Study Center’s first knowledge of the  event, for 
expedited reporting to Regulatory Authorities.  
9.4. Monit oring and Recording Adverse Events  
Any pre -existing conditions or signs and/or symptoms present in a patient prior to the start of the 
study (i.e., before informed consent and, as applicable, assent) should be recorded as Medical 
History and not recorded a s AEs unless the pre -existing condition worsened.  The Investigator or 
designee  should always group signs and symptoms into a single term that constitutes a  single 
unifying diagnosis  if possible.  Before a diagnosis is confirmed, all symptoms should be 
reported as separate AEs.  
9.4.1.  Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
In the interest of patient safety, and in order to fulfill regulatory requirements , all SAEs 
(regardless of their relationship to Study Drug) should be reported to the Sponsor  or designee 
within 24 hours of the Study Center’s first knowledge of the  event.  The collection of SAEs will 
begin after the patient signs the ICF and will stop at the end of the patient’s  Post-Treatment 
Period , which is defined as completion of the Week [ADDRESS_1078933] -Treatmen t Period, or 
patient has Day 1/Week 1 in the OLE study .  Serious adverse events should be reported using 
electronic SAE submission (via Electronic Data Capture [EDC]) whenever possible.  In 
situations where electronic SAE submission is unavailable, a paper  Initial Serious Adverse Event 
Form should be completed, and a copy should be faxed or emailed to the Sponsor or designee.  
The SAE reporting instructions, including the fax number and email address, can be found in the 
Investigator Site File for the study .   
Detailed information should be actively sought and included as Follow -Up as soon as additional 
information becomes available.  All SAEs will be followed until resolution.  Serious adverse 
events that remain ongoing past the patient’s last protocol -specified visit will be evaluated by [CONTACT_784444].  If the Investigator or designee and Sponsor agree that the 
patient’s condition is unlikely to resolve, the Investigator or designee and Sponsor will determine 
the follow -up require ment.  
9.4.2.  Non-Serious Adverse Events  
The recording of non -serious AEs will begin after the patient signs the ICF and will stop at the 
end of the patient’s Post -Treatment Period, which is defined as completion of the Week [ADDRESS_1078934] -Treatment Period, or patient has Day 1/Week [ADDRESS_1078935] all  observed or volunteered AEs on the 
eCRF.  
9.4.3.  Evaluation of Adverse Events (Serious and Non -Serious)  
The Investigator’s or designee’s  opi[INVESTIGATOR_784390] : 
ISIS 721744 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 2  
Protocol   12 July 2022  
 
57 [IP_ADDRESS].  Relationship to the Study Drug  
The event’s relationship to the Study Drug (ISIS 721744  or placebo)  is characterized by 1 of the 
following:  
• Related:  There is clear evidence that the event is related to the use of Study Drug 
(ISIS 721744  or placebo) , e.g., confirmation by [CONTACT_38000] -challenge test  
• Possible:  The event cannot be explained by [CONTACT_102]’s medical condition, 
concomitant therapy, or other causes, and there is a plausible temporal relationship 
between the event and Study Drug (ISIS 721744  or placebo) administration  
• Unlikely/Remote:  An event for which an alternative explanation is more likely (e.g., 
concomitant medications or ongoing medical conditions) or the tem poral relationship 
to Study Drug (ISIS 721744  or placebo) administration and/or exposure suggests that 
a causal relationship  is unlikely (for reporting purposes, Unlikely/Remote will be 
grouped together with Not Related)  
• Not Related:  The event can be read ily explained by [CONTACT_8130]’s underlying medical 
condition, concomitant therapy, or other causes, and therefore, the Investigator or 
designee believes no relationship exists between the event and Study Drug 
(ISIS 721744  or placebo)  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Severity  
The severity of AEs and SAEs relating to laboratory tests will be graded based on criteria from 
the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive 
Vaccine Clinical Trials, Sept. 2007 (refer to Appendix  D).  Any AE not listed in Appendix  D 
will be graded as fo llows:  
• Mild:  The event is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_10553]’s 
usual daily activities  
• Moderate:  The event causes the patient more discomfort and interrupts the patient’s 
usual daily activities  
• Severe:  The event is incapacita ting and causes considerable interference with the 
patient’s usual daily activities  
The severity of AEs and SAEs relating to AEs at the injection site will be graded based on 
criteria from the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunte ers Enrolled 
in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials, Sept 2007 (refer to Appendix  D). 
If the event is an SAE, then all applicable seriousness criteria  must be indicated (criteria listed in 
Section  9.3.3 . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Action Taken with Study Drug  
Down -titration of Study Drug (ISIS 721744  or placebo)  will not be allowed during the study.  
Action taken with Study Drug (ISIS 721744  or placebo)  due to an AE is characterized by 1 of the 
following:  
ISIS 721744 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 2  
Protocol   12 July 2022  
 
58 • None:  No changes made to Study Drug (ISIS 721744  or placebo) administration and 
dose 
• Not Applicable:  AE repo rted during the Screening Period prior to Study Drug 
(ISIS 721744  or placebo)  administration or during the Post -Treatment Period  
• Permanently Discontinued:  Study Drug (ISIS 721744  or placebo)  discontinued and 
not restarted  
• Temporarily Interrupted, Restarte d - Same Dose:  Dosing and/or dosing 
frequency temporarily interrupted/changed or delayed due to the AE and restarted at 
the same  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Treatment Given for Adverse Event  
Any treatment (e.g., medications or procedures) given for the AE should be recorded on the 
Adverse Event Case Report Form.  T reatment should also be recorded on the concomitant 
treatment or ancillary procedures eCRF , as appropriate.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Outcome of the Adverse Event  
If the event is a non -serious AE, then the event’s outcome is characterized by [CONTACT_38012]:  
• AE Persists:  Patient terminates from the trial and the AE continues  
• Recovered:  Patient recovered completely from the AE  
• Became Serious:  The event became serious (the date that the event became serious 
should be recorded as the Resolution Date of that AE and the Onset Date of the 
corresponding SAE)  
• Change in Severity (if applicable):  AE severity changed  
If the event is an SAE, then the event’s outcome is characterized by [CONTACT_080]:  
• Ongoing:  SAE continuing  
• Persists (as non -serio us AE):  Patient has not fully recovered but the event no longer 
meets serious criteria and should be captured as an AE on the non -serious AE  eCRF 
(the SAE resolution date should be entered as the date of onset of that AE)  
• Recovered:  Patient recovered completely from the SAE (the date of recovery should 
be entered as the SAE resolution date)  
• Recovered with Sequelae:  The signs/symptoms of the reported SAE have improved 
but not completely resolved, and a new baseline for the patient is established since 
full recovery is not expected  
• Fatal:  Patient died (the date of death should be entered as the SAE resolution date)  
• Unknown:  The outcome of the reported SAE is not available, e.g., patient is lost to 
follow -up

59 [IP_ADDRESS].  Follow -up of Adverse Event  
Investigator or de signee  Follow -Up 
During the study, the Investigator or designee  should follow each AE until the event has resolved 
to Baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable, the patient is lost to follow -up, or the 
patient withdraws consent or assent.  Every effort should be made to follow all SAEs considered 
to be related to Study Drug or related to study procedures until a final outcome can be reported.  
Resolution of AE (with dates) should be documented on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the 
patient’s me dical record to facilitate source data verification.   
Investigator or designee  should follow -up or support the Sponsor’s effort to follow up with all 
pregnancies reported during the study from either the study patient or the female partner of male 
study p atient until pregnancy outcome is available.   
Sponsor Follow -Up 
For SAEs, AESIs, and pregnancy cases in patients who have completed or terminated the study, 
the Sponsor or a designee should follow -up by [CONTACT_756], fax, email, and/or a monitoring visit to 
obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g., from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8838], 
consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent medical assessment of 
these case.  
9.5. Procedures for Handling Special Situations  
9.5.1.  Abnormalities of Laboratory Tests  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_25285] , constitute or be associated with an AE.  Examples of these include abnormal laboratory 
results that are associate d with symptoms, or require treatment, e.g., bleeding due to 
thrombocytopenia, tetany due to hypocalcemia, or cardiac arrhythmias due to hyperkalemia.  
Whenever possible, the underlying diagnosis should be listed in preference to abnormal 
laboratory values  as AEs.  Clinically significant abnormalities will be monitored by [CONTACT_784445].  Laboratory 
abnormalities deemed not clinically significant (NCS) by [CONTACT_784446].  Similarly, laboratory abnormalities reported as AEs by [CONTACT_784447].  
The I nvestigator is responsible for reviewing and signing all laboratory reports.  The signed 
clinical laboratory reports will serve as source documents and should include the Investigator’s 
or designee’s assessment of clinical significance of out of range/abno rmal laboratory values.  
9.5.2.  Prescheduled or Elective Procedures or Routinely Scheduled Treatments  
A prescheduled or elective procedure or a routinely scheduled treatment will not be considered 
an SAE, even if the patient  is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]; the Study Center must document all of the following:  
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was 
scheduled (or was on a waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the patient’s 
consent and, as applicable, assent to participate in the study  
ISIS 721744 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 2  
Protocol   12 July 2022  
 
60 • The condition that required the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely 
scheduled treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_784391]’s consent and, as applicable, 
assent to  participate in the study and the timing of the procedure or treatment  
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment is the sole 
reason for the intervention or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]  
9.5.3.  Dosing Errors  
Study Drug ( ISIS 721744  or placebo) d osing errors (including overdose, underdose, and 
administration error) should be documented as protocol deviations.  A brief description should be 
provided in the deviation, including whether the patient  was symptomatic (list symptoms) or 
asymptomatic, and  the event accidental or intentional.  
Dosing details should be captured on the Dosing eCRF.  If the patient takes a dose of Study Drug 
(ISIS 721744  or placebo) that exceeds protocol specifications and the patient is symptomatic, 
then the symptom(s) should be documented as an AE and be reported per Section  9.4. 
An overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the dose 
being studied.  An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment is not itself an AE, but 
it may result in an AE.  All AEs associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of Study 
Drug should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the a ssociated AE fulfills seriousness 
criteria, the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24  hours 
after learning of the event).  
Should an overdose occur , the Investigator or designee should refer to the “Guidance for 
Investig ator” section of the Investigator’s Brochure and  contact [CONTACT_10557] 
[ADDRESS_1078936] learning of the occurrence of pregnanc y.  Follow -up 
information including delivery or termination is reported by [CONTACT_10558] ‘Follow -up’ on the 
Pregnancy Forms and reported within 24 hours.  
Payment for all aspects of obstetrical care, child or related care will be the patient’s 
responsibili ty.   
Female patients :  If a suspected pregnancy occurs while on the study (including the 
Post-Treatment Period), a pregnancy test will be performed.  The patient with a confirmed 
pregnancy will be immediately withdrawn from treatment with Study Drug.  How ever, the 
patient will be encouraged to complete the Post -Treatment Period of the study to the extent that 
study procedures do not interfere with the pregnancy.  Regardless of continued study 
participation, the study physician will assist the patient in ge tting obstetrical care and the

Protocol   12 July 2022  
 
61 progress of the pregnancy will be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known (i.e., 
delivery, elective termination, or spontaneous abortion).  If the pregnancy results in the birth of a 
child, the Study Center and S ponsor may require access to the mother and infant’s medical 
records to obtain additional information relevant to the pregnancy progress and outcome.  A 
longer follow -up may be required if a newborn child experiences a medical condition.  
Follow -up will be  performed to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_10560], e.g., pregnancy ICF may be required.  
Male patients :  The progress of the pregnancy of a male patient’s partner should be followed 
until the outcome of the pregnanc y is known (i.e., delivery, elective termination, or spontaneous 
abortion).  If the pregnancy results in the birth of a child, the Study Center and Sponsor may 
follow -up with the mother and may request access to the mother and infant’s medical records to 
obtain additional information relevant to the pregnancy progress and outcome.  A longer 
follow -up may be required if a newborn child experiences a medical condition.  Follow -up will 
be performed to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_784448], 
e.g., partner ICF may be required.  
10. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
The sections below indicate the overall structure and approach to the analysis of this study.  A 
detailed SAP incorporating these sections below will be prepared separately.  The SAP will 
outline all data handling conventions, including software, and specify additional statistical 
methods to be used for analysis.  The study objectives and endpoints are listed in Section  1.1 and 
Section  1.2, respectively.  
10.1. Stratification, Subsets, and Covariates  
There are no stratification  factors in this study.  Subset analyses are not planned.  The covariate 
used in the model for the primary efficacy analysis is described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
10.2. Sample Size Considerations  
The power and sample size estimations were calculated using simulations based on a generalized 
linear model for count data assuming a Poisson distribution.  The primary endpoint is the time -
normalized - number of Investig ator-confirmed HAE attacks (per month) from Week 1 to 
Week  25.  Assuming an HAE attack rate of 13.26 attacks per 6 -month period in the placebo 
group and an HAE attack rate of 1.38 attacks per 6 -month period in the ISIS 721744 80 mg  
every 4 weeks  group, the  sample size of 54 patients (2:1 ratio [ISIS 721744:placebo ]) will 
provide at least 90% power for the primary endpoint, with a 0.05 significance level.  A total of 
approximately 84 patients ([ADDRESS_1078937] bo 
group, and 21 in the ISIS 721744 every 8 weeks group) will be enrolled in this trial to account 
for potential early dropouts and to facilitate some general safety evaluations.

The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) details the statistical methodology to be used in analyzing 
study data and outlines the statistical programming specifications for the Tables , Listings, and 
Figures. It describes the variables  and analysis sets , anticipated data transformations and 
manipulations and other details of the analyses not provided in the Study Protocol.  
The analyses described in this SAP are based upon the following study documents:  
• Study Protocol, Amendment 1 ( 1 October 2021)  
• Study Protocol, Amendment 2 ([LOCATION_006] only,  29 March 2022)

Additional requests in Study Protocol  amendment 3 ([LOCATION_006] only) include 1) assessments of growth 
development and sexual maturity (i.e. , Tanner Staging) for adolescent patients (12 -17 years) and 
2) extending the last post -treatment visits from Week 13 to Week 17.  This SAP describes these 
requests in the corresponding section below.  
Revision(s) of this SAP will be required for any subsequent amendments to the protocol which 
may change the analyses described in this SAP.   The SAP will be finalized prior to database lock 
and describes the statistical  analysis as it is foreseen when the study is being planned.  If 
circumstances should arise during the study rendering this analysis inappropriate, or if improved 
methods of analysis should arise, updates to the analyses may be made.  Any deviations from t he 
SAP after database lock, reasons for such deviations and all alternative or additional statistical 
analyses that may be performed, will be described in an SAP Addendum and/or documented in 
the final clinical study report.

To evaluate safety and tolerability of ISIS 721744 in patients with HAE.  
2.4. Exploratory Objectives   
To further characterize the effects of ISIS 721744 on health economic and utilization parameters 
and additional Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) and biomarkers . 
3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN   
3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan   
This study is a phase 3, randomized (ISIS 721744:placebo), double -blind, placebo -controlled 
trial conducted in multiple centers to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ISIS 721744 in 
preventing angioedema attacks in patients with HAE -1 (Type I) and HAE -2 (Type II).  
Approximately 84 patients are planned to be enrolled in the study.   Patients will be randomized 
in a 2:1 ratio to Cohort A (ISIS 721744 or placebo every 4 weeks) or Cohort B (ISIS 721744 or 
placebo every 8 weeks), respectively.  Within each Cohor t, patients will be randomized in a 
3:[ADDRESS_1078985] -Treatment Periods.  Patients may be 
required to attend additional visits for monitoring of adverse events ( AEs) or abnormal 
investigation results.  
The length of each patient’s participation in the study is approximately 11 months (or 12  months 
for [LOCATION_006]), whi ch includes an up to 56 -day Screening Period, a 2 4-week Treatment Period, and an 
up to 13-week (or up to 17 -week, in [LOCATION_006] only) Post -Treatment Period, unless the patient chooses 
to enroll in the open -label extension (OLE) study.  
Patients who experience at least 5 attacks/month for [ADDRESS_1078986] -Treatment Period, unless consent/assent is withdrawn.

The main estimator, i.e. primary endpoint is the time -normalized number of 
Investigator -confirmed HAE attacks (per every-4-week) from Week 1 to Week 25 compared to 
placebo.  
Investigator -confirmed HAE attacks will be continuously collected until Week 25 no matter 
which intercurrent event is occurred.  The primary analysis will be performed based on the 
treatment policy strategy.  
3.2.3.  Secondary Endpoints   
• The time-normalized number of Investigator -confirmed HAE attacks 
(per every-4-week) from Week 5 to Week 25 compared to placebo  
• The percentage of Investigator -confirmed HAE attack -free patients from Week 5 to 
Week 25 compared to placebo  
• The time-normalized number of moderate or severe Investigator -confirmed HAE 
attacks (per every-4-week) from Week 5 to Week 25 compared to placebo  
• The number of patients with a cl inical response defined as a ≥ 50%, ≥ 70%, or ≥  90% 
reduction from Baseline (i.e., screening rate) in Investigator -confirmed HAE attack 
rate between Week [ADDRESS_1078989] Document Version No . 2.0

4.1. Data Management and Quality Assurance   
An electronic case report form (eCRF) utilizing an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) application 
will be used for this Study. Data will be continuously collecte d no matter which intercurrent 
events defined in the Section 3.2.[ADDRESS_1078993] occurred.  
4.1.1.  Case Report Form Data   
BioClinica (or designee) is responsible for creating the EDC data entry screens, database and edit 
checks using definitions developed by [CONTACT_81801], Inc  (Ionis).  Ionis (or designee) is 
responsible for the review, data management querying and locking of the database.  
Data are single -entered into the EDC system by [CONTACT_10590].  Programmed edit 
checks (computer logic that checks the validity of the data e ntered and also prompts for missing 
data that is expected to be entered) are run and automatic queries are generated.   Ionis reviews all 
data for accuracy and validity and generates additional queries in the EDC system when 
necessary.   The data is correcte d or an explanation concerning the query is provided in the EDC 
system.  After all data are entered, reviewed (by [CONTACT_84276]) 
and queried, and all queries resolved, the database is locked.  
4.1.2.  Laboratory Data   
Ionis and Medpace are responsible for the format of the laboratory electronic data transfers and 
the transfer schedule.   Central laboratory data results are not stored in the EDC system. Medpace 
and Ionis are responsible for the review of the clinical laboratory data.  This process involves 
reviewing the patient and visit identifiers in the central laboratory data results data against the 
central lab data identifiers collected in the EDC system.  Inve stigator sites have access to the data 
via lab reports sent directly from the laboratory or through the laboratory’s web portal (in which 
case Investigators only have access to data from their site).  
4.1.3.  Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Assessments   
The PRO assessments will be captured by [CONTACT_213362].   Patients will enter their 
assessments into the system using a study -dedicated tablet and handheld devices.   Ionis and 
YPrime are responsible for the format of the electronic data transfers and the transfer schedule.   
The PRO assessments will not be stored in the EDC system.  Ionis and YPrime are also 
responsible for the review of the data.  This process involves reviewi ng the patient and visit 
identifiers in the assessment data against the data identifiers collected in the EDC system.  The 
YPrime system for data collection includes built -in measures to prevent missing items for any 
completed questionnaire.

4.2. General Considerations   
4.2.1.  Data Presentation   
Placebo patients from Cohort A and Cohort B will be pooled for analyses.  
Continuous data will be summarized in terms of the number of patients, mean , standard deviation 
(SD), standard error of mean (SEM), median, interquartile range (25th percentile, 75th 
percentile), minimum, and maximum, unless otherwise stated.   The minimum and maximum will 
be reported to the same number of decimal places as the ra w data recorded in the database.  The 
mean, median, lower quartile and upper quartile will be reported to one more decimal place than 
the raw data recorded in the database.   The SD and SEM will be reported to 2 more decimal 
places than the raw data recorde d in the database.   In general, the maximum number of decimal 
places reported shall be four for all summary statistic.  Raw values presented in listings will be 
displayed to the measured precision, unless specified.  
Categorical data will be summarized in t erms of the number of patients providing data at the 
relevant time point (n), frequency counts and percentages.   Any planned collapsing of categories 
will be detailed in the SAP text and the data displays.   Percentages will be presented to one 
decimal plac e.  Percentages will not be presented for zero counts.  Changes from baseline in 
categorical data will be summarized using shift tables where appropriate.  
All statistical tests will be conducted using 2 -sided tests with 5% Type I error rate unless 
otherwise stated. P -values greater than or equal to 0.001, in general, will be presented to 
3 decimal places. P -values less than 0.001 may be presented as “<  0.001”.

assuming Jump -to-Reference (J2R).  
• For number of patients with a clinical response on HAE  and HAE attack-free, 
responder is derived based on time -adjusted Investigator -confirmed HAE attack rate  
per every-4-week.  The main analysis will consider the HAE attack rate per every -4-
week are the same before and after withdrawal ; sensitivity analysis  will be performed 
based on imputed data by [CONTACT_784461] J2R.  
• For the AECT total score, the main analysis will  be performed based on imputed data 
by [CONTACT_176261] (LOCF).   Additionally, sensitivity analyses will 
be performed based on imputed data by [CONTACT_784462] J2R.  
• For the AE -QoL total score, main analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_784463]; sensitivity analyses will be performed based on

Related to:  SOP -GDO-WW-[ADDRESS_1079032]-withdrawal part of each pattern -specific distribution may be modelled using 
approaches discussed below:   
Jump-to-Reference (J2R)  
The J2R approach is an extremely conservative imputation approach that assumes that a 
patient receiving active Study Drug (ISIS 721744)  does not sustain benefit after 
discontinuing study treatment. In J2R, missing event rate in both the ISIS 721744 
treatment group and the pooled placebo group will be imputed by [CONTACT_784464] -withdraw part.  
Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_784394] a point where the analysis conclusion is reversed (i.e. , the analysis yields a non -
significant p -value).  The study adopts a two-way tippin g point approach where a series 
of shift (denoted as δ) is applied to both active Study Drug (ISIS  721744) and placebo  
treatment arm .  As the underlying distribution of primary endpoint is a Poisson 
distribution, t he parameter of Poisson distribution (deno ted as λ) is adjusted by δ as 
follows: 
λ (ISIS 721744, tippi[INVESTIGATOR_11300]) = λ (ISIS 721744, MAR -imputed)  × δ (ISIS 721744)  
λ (Placebo, tippi[INVESTIGATOR_11300])  = λ (Placebo, MAR-imputed)  × δ (ISIS 721744)  
The sequences of both λ starts at 1 , where λ (ISIS 721744, tippi[INVESTIGATOR_11300]) is increased by 
0.25 upwards and  λ (Placebo, tippi[INVESTIGATOR_11300])  goes backwards to [ADDRESS_1079033] in case the tippi[INVESTIGATOR_784395].   The upper limit 
may expand further in case the ‘tippin g-point’ that yields non -significant conclusion has

Score  
The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method will be used under the multivariate normality 
assumption to impute the missing AE -QoL total score and AECT total score by [CONTACT_6490].  The variable list for imputations will include the baseline score, as wel l as all available 
post-baseline scores  within the treatment period , in the order of protocol defined visits.  The SAS 
procedure PROC MI will be used in the multiple simulation.   EM algorithm will be used to 
derive a set of initial parameter estimates for MCMC method.   A non-informative prior (Jeffreys’ 
prior) will be used to derive the posterior distribution of the parameters.   In case there are 
missing baselines, it will be imputed first by [CONTACT_784465].  In the case of non -monotone missing pattern, MCMC method will be used first so 
that each imputed data set has a monotone missing pattern based on the order of the variable list.

Related to:  SOP -GDO-WW-019 Page 25 of 61 The J2R approach is  detailed in (Carpenter et al. 2013) and is an extremely conservative 
imputation approach that assumes that a patient receiving active Study Drug (ISIS 721744)  does 
not sustain benefit after discontinuing study treatment.  In J2R, missing data in the pooled 
placebo gr oup will be imputed under a within treatment arm MAR assumption.  For a patient

For each subject, the missing AECT total score at Week [ADDRESS_1079038]’s Week 25 will be imputed by [CONTACT_784466] 13.  
Missing Dates for Investigator -confirmed HAE attacks  
Missing start or end date and time for Investigator -confirmed HAE attacks will be imputed.  In 
general, missing start time will be imputed as 0:00 and missing end time will be imputed as 
23:59.  However, the following rules will be applied for the attacks satisfying the corresponding 
conditions, in order to conservatively classify the attacks as separate, distinct attacks with at least 
24 hours in  between: 
• For Investigator -confirmed HAE attacks with a missing start time and a non -missing 
start date one cale ndar day after the end date of the previous attack, the start time will 
be imputed using the end time of the previous Investigator -confirmed HAE attack to 
ensure there are 24 hours in between the 2 attacks. 
• For Investigator -confirmed HAE attacks with a mis sing start time and a non -missing 
end date/time within 24 hours from the end date/time of the previous attack, the 
attack should be considered as one attack with the previous attack  
• For Investigator -confirmed HAE attacks with missing end time and a non -missing 
end date one calendar day before the start date of the next attack, the end time will be 
imputed as the start time of the next Investigator -confirmed HAE attack to ensure 
there are 24 hours in between the 2 attacks. 
• For Investigator -confirmed HAE atta cks with a missing end time and non -missing 
start date/time within 24 hours from the start date/time of the next attack, the attack 
should be considered as one attack with the next attack.  
For Investigator -confirmed HAE attacks with a non -missing start dat e and time and a missing 
stop date and time:  
• The stop date and time will be imputed as the earlier of the following 2 date and time:  
o Start date and time + 48 hours or study completion date and the stop time of 
23:59, whichever is later.  
o 24 hours before the  start date and time of the next attack.  
After imputation, in the case of earlier than the start date/time, impute the time to be 
one second after the start date/time.

ISIS 721744 80 mg every 4 weeks group and λ placebo refers to the Investigator -confirmed HAE 
attack rate during the treatment period in the placebo group.  The null hypothesis is  that the

between treatment groups), versus the alternative hypothesis that the Investigator -confirmed 
HAE attack rate ratio is not 1.   Estimated attack rate ratios les s than [ADDRESS_1079051] for treatment group (categorical), baseline (the time-normalized run -in

The Poisson regression model assumes that the mean and variance are equal.  When the variance 
in the data is larger than the mean, the model is said to be over -dispersed.  The primary analysis 
using Pearson chi -square scaling of standard errors to account for potential overdispersion.  
A sensitivity analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_6486] a NB regression (Negative Binomial

variable.  
All patients who discontinued the Treatment Period early and started OLE, and patients who 
discontinued the Treatment Period early and were lost to follow -up before Week 25, will have 
the time-adjusted attack rate included in the analysis.

combined using Rubin’s rules .  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Sensitivity Analysis 4 – Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]-Point Analysis   
A tippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]-point analysis will be conducted to measure the potential effect of missing data on the 
reliability of the primary efficacy analysis.  
In this analysis, a range of progressively more conservative assumptions about the number of 
events occurring in the post-withdrawal period will be explored in order to find the assumption 
which will reverse the conclusion (i.e., yield a non -significant p -value) of the primary analysis.   
The assumption that will reverse the conclusion is referred to as the tippi[INVESTIGATOR_461818].  Once the 
tippi[INVESTIGATOR_784396], the clinical plausibility of the assumption can be assessed.  
Missing event rate will be imputed by [CONTACT_784472] [IP_ADDRESS].  In each 
run, the Poisson regression model used for the primary analysis will be performed.  Results will

To evaluate the robustness of inferences made on the main analysis , a sensitivity analysis on 
FAS will be performed based on imputed data by [CONTACT_784462] J2R which is 
described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  For each imputed data set, the percentage reduction will be 
calculated and main analysis described above will be performed.   Results will be co mbined 
using Rubin’s rules . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Number of Investigator -Confirmed Hereditary Angioedema  (HAE) Attacks 
Requiring Acute Therapy from Week 5 to Week 25   
HAE attacks requiring acute therapy include those attacks with the following concomitant 
medication.  
C1 Esterase Inhibitors (human)  
 Berinert 
Cinryze 
C1 Esterase Inhibitor (recombinant)  Ruconest 
Plasma Kallikrein Inhibitor (human)  Kalbitor (ecallantide)  
Bradykinin antagonist  Firazyr (icatibant)  
The time-normalized number of Investigator -confirmed HAE attacks (per every-4-week) 
requiring acute therapy from Week 5 to Week 25 will be analyzed using the same methods as 
described for the primary efficacy endpoint in Sections [IP_ADDRESS], [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Main analysis will be based on Poisson regression model on  FAS with treatment policy strategy. 
For patients who discontinued the Treatment Period early and started OLE, and patients who 
discontinued the Treatment Period early and were lost to follow -up before Week  25, will have 
the time-adjusted attack rate included in the analysis.  
Sensitivity Analyses  
A NB regression on  FAS will be performed as a sensitivity analysis.  
To evaluate the robus tness of inferences made on MAR, a sensitivity analysis based on  FAS 
will be performed based on imputed data by [CONTACT_326491] (MI) methods 
assuming J2R which is described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  For each imputed data set, the Poisson 
regression model used for the primary analysis will be performed.   Results will be combined 
using Rubin’s rules  . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Percent of Patients who are Well-Controlled on the Angioedema Control Test 
(AECT) at Week [ADDRESS_1079070] is a validated patient -reported outcome instrument to assess disease activity in 
patients with recurrent angioedema (Weller et al. 2020) which will be assessed during Treatment 
and Post-Treatment Periods as outlined in Protocol Appendix A.   The questionnaire consists of 
four questions asking about the freq uency and severity of angioedema experienced in the last 4 
weeks.  Each question has 5  response choices.  Scored as the following:

Sensitivity Analyses  
To evaluate the robustness of inferences made on  the imputed data using LOCF , a sensitivity 
analysis on  all patients  with at least one non -missing AECT value at a post-baseline visit  will 
be performed based on imputed data by [CONTACT_784462] J2R which is described 
in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  For each imputed data set, the responder will be derived, and main 
analysis described above will be performed.  Results will be combined using Rubin’s rules .  
A sensitivity analysis on  all patients with at least one n on-missing AECT value at a 
post-baseline visit  based on imputed data by [CONTACT_784479] [IP_ADDRESS] will also be

Related to:  SOP -GDO-WW-019 Page 37 of 61 The AE-QoL questionnaire is a validated tool to assess symptom  specific health-related quality 
of life impairment in patients suffering from rec urrent angioedema (Weller et al. 2012).  The 
AEQoL is a self-administered questionnaire that can be completed in less than 5  minutes; it 
comprises 17  questions across 4 domains:   functioning, fatigue/mood, fears/shame, and food.  
Each domain includes the following questions : 
Functioning  How often have been restricted in the area of  Q1. Work; Q2. Physical activity; 
Q3. Leisure time; Q4. Social relations  
Fatigue/mood  Q6. Difficulty  falling asleep; Q7. Wake up during the night; Q8. Tired since not 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_102641] ; Q9. Trouble on concentrating ; Q10. Depressed  
Fears/shame  Q12. Swelling epi[INVESTIGATOR_784402] ; Q13. Afraid swelling could occur s uddenly; 
Q14. Afraid freq uency of the swelling increase ; Q15. Ashamed to go out in public  
because of swelling; Q16. Embarrassed or self -conscious  because of swelling ; 
Q17. Afraid treatment  has negative long-term effects  
Food Q5. Restrict eating and drinking; Q11. Limit your choices of  food/beverage 
The AE-QoL can be used to calculate scores for the 4 individual domains and can also be used to 
determine a total score.  The AE -QoL will be completed by [CONTACT_102].  
AE-QoL will be evaluated by [CONTACT_784481] a total score. 
Each item answered by [CONTACT_784482] 0 and 4 points depending on the answer option 
chosen by [CONTACT_102]:  Never = 0, Rarely = 1, Occasionally = 2, Often = 3, Very  often = 4.  The 
AE-QoL domain scores and total score are cal culated by [CONTACT_21734]:  
(Sum score of all completed items) / (maximum sum score of all possible items)  × 100 
Computation of AE -QoL Total Score  
Example 1:  All items were completed (maximum possible sum:   68 points)  
Sum of all 17 completed items:   41 points 
Total score = 100  × (41/68) = 60 (out of a possible 100 points)  
Example 2: 2 items were not completed (maximum possible sum: 60 points)   
Sum of all 15 completed items:  41 points 
Total score = 100  × (41/60) = 68 (out of a possib le 100 points)  
Computation of Domain Scores (Example: Fears/Shame)  
Example: Sum of all 6 completed items:   14 points 
Maximum possible sum:   24 points 
Domain Score = 100  × (14/24) = 58 (out of a possible 100 points)  
Remarks  
Since only answered items are inc luded in the computation (and the calculated domain and total 
scores are not raw scores but linear transformations to a 0 -to-100 scale), the calculated scores are 
not or only little influenced by [CONTACT_84287].  
An AE-QoL domain score should not be calculat ed if more than one item is left unanswered in 
that domain.   The AE-QoL total score should not be calculated if more than 25% of items

The minimal and highest possible domain and total scores are [ADDRESS_1079080]-Roger approach  (Kenward and Roger 1997 ).  If there are 
convergence problems with the repeated measures mixed model, this will be explored with the 
following methods in order:   1) the SCORING  = [ADDRESS_1079081] 4 iterations. 2)  If the 
convergence problem cannot be resolved, the unstructured covariance matrix will be replaced by 
[CONTACT_784483] (Type = CS in SAS).  
The comparison between ISIS [ADDRESS_1079082] errors, and the 2 -tailed 95% confidence intervals for the 
treatment group and placebo group will be presented.  
Sensitivity Analyses  
To evaluate the robustne ss of inferences made on MAR, a sensitivity analysis on  FAS based 
on imputed data by [CONTACT_784462] J2R which is described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
will be perf ormed.  For each imputed data set, total score will be derived.  The change from 
baseline in AE -QoL total score will be compared between ISIS721744 80 mg every 4 weeks 
and pooled placebo using ANCOVA with baseline as a covariate .  Results will be combined  
using Rubin’s rules .  
In addition , a responder analysis will be performed for AE-QoL total score  as an exploratory 
analysis: 
A clinical response is defined as a ≥ 6-point improvement from b aseline in AE-QoL total score  at 
Week 25, i.e., Post-baseline – Baseline ≤ -6.  The patient who archives a clinical response is a 
responder. Patients with non -missing response will be analyzed.  The odds ratio, corresponding 
95% confidence intervals and p -value will be provided by [CONTACT_2329] a logistic regr ession model with 
the baseline , and the treatment -by-baseline interaction  as covariate s. 
For patients who discontinued the Treatment Period early and started OLE, and patients who 
discontinued the Treatment Period early and were lost to follow -up before We ek 25, the 
treatment termination reason will be checked.   Due to reasons of adverse event s or lack of 
efficacy, patients will be considered a s a non-responder ; due to other reasons , patient will be

be excluded from the analysis.   
Exploratory analysis for e ach AE-QoL domain score  is described in Section 4.13.8.  
4.10. Safety Evaluation   
All safety summaries and analyses will be based on the Safety Set as defined in Section 4.5. 
4.10.1.  Extent of Exposure   
Study drug will be administered as subcutaneous injections.   A descriptive summary of exposure 
variables will be provided for patients who took ISIS 721744 80 mg:  
• Amount of active Study Drug (ISIS 721744)  (mg) 
• Duration of active Study Drug (ISIS 721744) exposure (days) from the first dose 
date/time to the last dose date/time + pre -specified duration in days, or to the study 
termination  date, which occurred earlier . 
− for cohort A, the pre-specified duration is 28 days  
− for cohort B, the pre-specified duration is 56 days  
4.10.2.  Adverse Events (AEs)   
AEs will be coded using the  MedDRA Version 26.1 or higher.   
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be tabulated and are defined as those AEs that 
either start or worsen in severity on or after the date/time of first dose of study treatment.  
In addition, if severity of an AE changes during the study,  a separate AE  will be recorded for 
each severity on the AE CRF. “first” and “second” AE will be identify based on AE start date. 
AE start date of the second record is AE stop date of first record.  AE severity 
(mild/moderate/severe) are compared between the se 2 linked records in a pair for further 
defining TEAE .  Consider 2 cases below:  
• Case 1:  The first AE record in the pair occurs before first dosing, and the second AE 
record occurs after first dosing.  
If the AE severity of the second record is worse than that of the first record, then only 
the second AE is deemed as a TEAE.  Otherwise, neithe r record is considered as 
TEAE. 
• Case 2:  Both AE records in the pair occur after first dosing.   
If the AE severity on the second record is worse than the severity on the first record, 
then count both records as treatment -emergent.   But, if the severity im proves, then 
only count the first record as treatment -emergent.  
All TEAEs identified based on the rules above will be summarized in the event number analysis.

Related to:  SOP -GDO-WW-019 Page 45 of 61 using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_3148], dose, cohort, study day, and sched uled time point, 
without and with age group stratification (12 to <  18-year-old and ≥ 18 -year-old patients), 
without and with stratification by [CONTACT_784492]-Drug Antibody  (ADA) status overall (see 
Section 4.12.2).  For the purpose of calculating typi[INVESTIGATOR_784403] (n,  mean, 
SEM/SD, %CV, geometric mean, geometric %CV, median, minimum, and maximum) for 
plasma concentrations, all BLQ values will be set  to zero. Mean plasma concentrations that are 
below the LLOQ will be presented as BLQ, and the SD, SEM/SD, %CV, and geometric %CV 
will be reported as not applicable  (NA).  Other stratifications may also be performed if deemed 
warranted.  Samples will be ex cluded from descriptive statistics if there are large deviations 
between scheduled and actual sampling times (percent difference between scheduled and actual 
sampling time greater than 30%), or large deviations between actual dose and nominal dose 
(percent difference between nominal and actual dose greater than 30%).   Any samples excluded 
from the summary descriptive statistics, if deemed necessary, will be listed separately along with 
the reason for exclusion.  
Population PK, PK/PD or exposure -response anal ysis may be performed using the PK and PD 
data from this study, and/or combined with other clinical study data and reported separately.   If 
appliable, details of these analyses will be presented in a separate analysis plan.  
4.12. Immunogenicity (IM) Analysis   
Samples collected for IM assessment at baseline (Day 1 pre -dose), during treatment and 
post-treatment follow -up period including early termination samples will be analyzed for 
anti-ISIS 721744 antibodies (ADA).  
4.12.1.  Sample Level ADA Data   
An evaluable sample will be designated ‘Positive’ based on both positive screening and 
confirmation assay results (i.e.,  confirmed positive result), and otherwise will be deemed 
‘Negative’. Sample ADA results (screen positive/negative, confirmed positive/negative or 
unevaluable, and when applicable, titer of anti -ISIS 721744 antibodies) before, during, and after 
treatment w ith study drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) (sample ADA status) will be listed by 
[CONTACT_3148], dose, cohort, and day of collection.  
The sample ADA incidence (number) and incidence rate (percent) at each evaluated study time 
point will be determined and appropri ately summarized by [CONTACT_3148], dose, and cohort as the 
total number of and percentage of evaluated subjects with sample ADA negative, positive, and 
unknown status.  Furthermore, titer over time will be also appropriately summarized (using 
descriptive stati stics) as median, quartiles (25% and 75%), and range by [CONTACT_3148], dose, and 
cohort.  Summarization of ADA incidence, incidence rate and titer by [CONTACT_551] (12 to < 18-
year-old and ≥  18-year-old patients)  may also be reported.  
4.12.2.  Subject Level ADA Data   
Subject ADA status overall (ADASTAT) will be defined as ‘Positive’ status if they have at least 
one confirmed positive sample result at any time during the treatment or post -treatment  
evaluation  periods; ‘Negative’ status if all evaluated ADA sample results during the treatment

‘Unknown’ ADA status.  
Furthermore, subjects with positive overall ADA status will be further classified into different 
ADA types (ADATYPE) based on their baseline ADA status and change in ADA titer post -
treatment as described belo w :  
• Treatment -Emergent ADA: sum of treatment -induced ADA and treatment -boosted 
ADA as described below:  
o Treatment -Induced ADA:  ADA developed de novo (seroconversion) following 
biologic drug administration (i.e., formation of ADA any time after the initial 
drug administration in a subject without pre -existing ADA, i.e.,  baseline negative 
ADA)  
o Treatment -Boosted ADA:   pre-existing ADA that were boosted to a higher level 
following biologic drug administration (i.e., any time after the initial drug 
administration the ADA titer is greater than the baseline titer by a factor of 8 -fold 
or more  
• Treatment -Unaffected ADA:   pre-existing ADA that were not affected (boosted) 
following biologic drug administration (i.e., any time after the initial drug 
administra tion the ADA titer is 4 -fold or less)  
• ADATYPE would be not applicable (NA) if the subject overall ADA status is 
negative.  
Other subject level IM parameters to be calculated/defined may include but not limited to:  
• Subject ADA Status at Baseline (ADASTATB) :  "Positive" if the subject has Week 1 
Day 1 pre -dose sample (baseline) tested as confirmed positive; "Negative" if the 
subject has Week 1 Day 1 pre -dose sample (baseline) tested as confirmed negative; 
"Unknown" if the subject has Week 1 Day 1 pre -dose sample (baseline) unevaluable.  
• Onset of ADA (TFSTADA):   i.e., the first day ADA positive sample observed, will 
be calculated by: [CONTACT_10640] “positive” sample IM status - first dose 
date +1 
• Last Positive ADA Study Day (TLSTADA):  defined as the last positive ADA sample 
observed from the start of study drug treatment and will be calculated by: [CONTACT_784493] “positive” sample IM status - first dose date +1  
• Last IM Sampling Study Day (TLSTSAMP):   defined as the last ADA sample 
collected from the start of study drug treatment and will be calculated by:  [CONTACT_784494] - first dose date +1  
• Peak titer (PEAKTIT):   the highest titer observed for the subject  
• Time to peak titer (TPEAKTIT):   the time to reach peak titer will be calculated by:   
[CONTACT_10643] - first dose date +[ADDRESS_1079102] Document Version No . 2.0

Related to:  SOP -GDO-WW-019 Page 47 of 61 • Total number of ADA Positive Samples (NOPOSAMP):   the total number of ADA 
samples being confirmed positive for the subject  
• Total number of ADA S amples evaluated (NOADASAMT):   the total number of 
ADA samples being collected and analyzed successfully with reportable results for 
the subject  
Lastly, subjects with positive ADA status may further be classified as being transient or 
persistent ADA respon se, if there are sufficient number of subjects with transient ADA status.  
Transient and persistent ADA definitions are defined below and based on : 
Transient ADA response:  
• Treatment -induced ADA detected only at one sampling time point during the 
treatment or follow -up observation period (excluding the last sampling time point, 
which will be considered persistent unless shown to be undetectable at a later time) or  
• Treatment -induced ADA detected at two or more sampling time points during the 
treatment (including follow -up period if any), where the first and last ADA -positive 
samples (irrespective of any negative samples in between) are separated by a period 
less than [ADDRESS_1079104]’s last sampling time point is ADA -negative. 
Persistent ADA  response:  
• Treatment -induced ADA detected at 2 or more sampling time points during the 
treatment (including follow -up period if any), where the first and last ADA -positive 
samples (irrespective of any negative samples in between) are separated by a period 
of 16 weeks or longer or  
• Treatment -induced ADA detected only at the last sampling time point of the study 
treatment period or at a sampling time point with less than [ADDRESS_1079105] level ADA prevalence, incidence, and positive ADA response being transient or 
persistent (if applicable) will be calculated as the number and the proportion (percent) of the 
study population during the study period by [CONTACT_3148], dose, and cohort.   Subject level IM 
parameters (as described  above) will be listed by [CONTACT_3148], dose, and cohort for all evaluable 
subjects, and also appropriately summarized (using descriptive statistics) as median, quartiles 
(25% and 75%), and range by [CONTACT_3148], dose, and cohort.  Summarization of subject level  ADA 
response and IM parameters by [CONTACT_551] (12 to <  18-year-old and ≥ 18 -year-old patients) may 
also be reported.  
4.12.3.   Evaluation of IM Impact on PK, PD, Efficacy and Safety    
The impact of IM on PK, PD, and safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_784495]-treatment ISIS [ADDRESS_1079106] ADA status, summarized using typi[INVESTIGATOR_784404], and presented graphically and/or in tables.   Efficacy and PD measures to be stratified

Other stratifications (e.g., based on antibody titer, onset of ADA, etc.) of selected PK, PD, 
efficacy and safety assessments may also be performed if deemed warranted at the discretion of 
the pharmacokineticist, medical monitor, and/ or biostatistician.  
4.13. Exploratory Analyses   
All exploratory analyses will be performed as a reference based on the  FAS as defined in 
Section 4.5.  By-patient listings will be provided too.   Missing data will not be imputed.  
For exploratory  endpoints which are count data, in the case when Poisson regression  models 
cannot be converged, e.g. , when all patients within one treatment group have 0 event, Fisher’s 
Exact Test will be used as the main analysis.  
For exploratory  endpoints which are responder data , in the case when Logistic regression models 
cannot be converged, e.g. , when all patients within one treatment group are responders, Fisher’s 
Exact Test will be used as the main analysis.  
In the case of convergence problems with the repeated measures mixed model, Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
provides alternative model options.  
4.13.1.  Change and Percent Change from Baseline in Plasma Prekallikrein (PKK) Level   
The change and percent change from baseline in plasma PKK levels will be summarized by [CONTACT_121981].  The change and percent change from baseline in plasma PKK leve ls at 
each visit during the treatment period will be compared between ISIS 721744 80  mg every 4 
weeks (or every 8 weeks) and pooled placebo using MMRM model based on the  FAS.  The 
response variable is the change or percent change from baseline at post -baseline visit up to 
Week 25.  
The MMRM model will include effects of treatment, time, treatment -by-time interaction, and 
baseline value.   The unstructured covariance model will be used to model the within patient 
errors, shared across treatment and small samp le adjustments to standard errors and tests will be 
made following the Kenward -Roger approach  (Kenward and Roger 1997 ).  
4.13.2.  Change from Baseline in Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD -7) Questionnaire 
Total Score   
A GAD-7 questionnaire will be administered to evaluate anxiety experienced by [CONTACT_1962].  The 
GAD-7 is a self -administered patient questionnaire and it is used as a screening tool and severity 
measure for generalized anxiety disorder  (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_72443]. 2006). 
The GAD -7 questionnaire includes 7 questions, and the response to each question is scored 
as:  Not at all = 0, Several days  =1, More than  half the days  = 2, Nearly every day  = 3. 
The total score is calculated by [CONTACT_784498] a possible score 
from 0-21. GAD-7 total score will be classified into severity stages (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_72443]. 2006) as 
shown below , which will be summarized  for each visit .

4.13.3.  EuroQoL -5-Dimensions Quality of Life Questionnai re (EQ-5D-5L) and Change 
from Baseline in Visual Analog Scale (EQ VAS) Score   
EQ-5D-5L is a standardized measure of health status developed by [CONTACT_73474] a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal  (Herdman et al. 
2011).  The EQ-5D-5L consists of the EQ -5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ Visual analog 
scale (EQ VAS).  
The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises five dimensions (mobility, self -care, usual 
activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression), and the response to each dimension is scored 
in 5 levels as:  No problems  = 1, Slight problems  = 2, Moderate problems  = 3, Severe problems 
=4, Unable to/extreme problems  = 5.  Each state is referred to by a 5 -digit code.   For example, 
the health state, [ZIP_CODE], represents a patient who indicates no problems on mobility, usual 
activities, and anxiety/depression but slights problems on self -care and pain/discomfort.  
EQ-5D health state index score reflects how good or bad a health state is according to the 
preferences of the general population of a country/region .  To derive this index score, t he 
response of each dimension from the EQ -5D-5L descriptive system will be first translated into a 
weight based on the value sets issued by [CONTACT_144423].   Index value = 1 - sum of weights from 
these 5 dimensions’ response.  
The possible best value is [ADDRESS_1079112] value varies by [CONTACT_1606]. Validated weights for 
many countries are  available from the EuroQol page of https://euroqol.org/support/analysis -
tools/index -value-set-calculators/ .  If there is a missing response from a dimension, then the 
index value will not be calculated and be treated as missing.  For countries without validated 
health state utility values yet, the suggestion from EuroQol group , currently,  is using the United 
States EQ-5D-5L value set from (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_149983]. 2019).  The display of the index value is with 3 
digits of decimal points.   
The EQ VAS is used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by [CONTACT_144408]. The EQ VAS records a self -rating of health status on a vertical VAS anchored at 
100 (best imaginable health state) at the top and 0 (worst imaginable health state) at the bottom.

Health state index score and EQ VAS  will be summarized  in tables and listed in a by-patient 
listing. 
4.13.4.  Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Scale at Week 25/Early 
Termination   
The PGIC scales will also be administered throughout the study for purposes of PRO validation 
and its use as an anchor for estimation of minimal important difference (MID)  of other PRO 
measures.  PGIC is a single item rated on a 5-point Likert scale ( Much better  = 1, A little better = 
2, No change = 3, A little worse = 4, Much worse  = 5) designed for patients to rate their own 
perceptions of change in HAE -related health status . 
The number and percentage of patients  of each scale  at Week 25 will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_1570].  
The PGIC scale will be dichotomized to category of “better” and “no change or worse”.   The 
binary category data be summarized by [CONTACT_784499] a logistic 
regression .  The odds ratio, corresponding 95% CI, and p -value will be provided.   
The analysis wil l be conducted in  FAS. 
4.13.5.  Change from Baseline in Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) Scale   
The PGIS scales will also be administered throughout the study for purposes of P RO validation 
and its use as an anchor for estimation of MID  of other PRO measures .  PGIS is a 1 -item 
questionnaire rated on a 5-point scale ( None = 1, Mild = 2, Moderate = 3, Severe = 4, Very 
severe = 5) designed to assess patient’s impression of disease severity.  
The number and percentage of patients of each scale will be summarized by [CONTACT_104580].  
The change from baseline in PGIS will be  summarized by [CONTACT_784500] .   
The change from baseline in PGIS will also be dichotomized  to category of “better” (change 
from baseline <  0) and “no change or worse”  (change from baseline ≥  0).  The binary category 
data be summarized by [CONTACT_784501] a logistic regression  
with baseline as the covariate.   
Both analyses will be conducted in  FAS.

Pharmacoeconomics will be assessed by [CONTACT_784502] (CIQ):  specific health problem (SHP), US Version 2 (WPAI+CIQ:SHP).  Outcomes 
are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater i mpairment and 
less productivity, i.e., worse outcomes.  
Questions:  
During the past seven days  (not including today , i.e., the day of answering questions ): 
1 = currently employed (No; Yes)  
2 = hours missed work due to HAE symptoms  
3 = hours missed  work due to other reasons  
4 = hours actually worked  
5 = degree HAE symptoms affected productivity while working ( 0–10) with 0 = had no effect on 
my work and 10 = completely prevented me from working  
6 = currently attended classes/school (No; Yes)  
7 = hours missed cl asses/school due to HAE symptoms  
8 = hours actually attend class or school  
9 = degree HAE symptoms affected productivity while in classes/school ( 0-10) with 0 = had no

10 = degree health affected regular activities ( 0–10) with 0 = had no effect on my daily activities 
and 10 = completely prevented me from doing my daily activities  
Weight of work/school for each subject and each visit per hours:  
Weight of work (WW) =  0, if Q1 = No;

prior to/ at the assessment point .  The mean of every-4-week WPAI  score is to be calculated to 
get WPAI4.   For example, W PAI4 at Week 5 is a mean of 4 consecutive weekly score s prior to 
Week 5 since Study Day 1 .  Similarly, each successive interval , i.e., WPAI4 at Week 9, Week 
13, Week 17, Week 21 and Week 25 , will start from the end of the prior interval, exclusively, 
and end 4 weeks later.  
WPAI 4 of Absenteeism score, Presenteeism sc ore, overall productivity impairment score and

summary of Absenteeism score , Presentee ism score and overall productivity impairment score .   
All patients are expected to answer Q10 and have the activity impairment score.   The change 
from baseline in WPAI 4 of the activity impairment score  will be compared between ISIS  721744 
80 mg every 4 weeks (or every 8 weeks)  and pooled placebo using the MMRM model based on

The AAS is a PRO measure developed to assess disease activity  in patients with recurrent 
angioedema, which includes patients with HAE (Weller et al. 2013).  The AAS consists of an 
opening question  as well as  5 questions  regarding the swelling epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] . 
Opening question  is “Have you had a  swelling epi[INVESTIGATOR_280593] 24 hours? ”  It may be used to 
count the number of angioedema affected days during the AAS documentation period but has no 
score. 
5 questions regarding the swelling epi[INVESTIGATOR_784407]. 
A score between 0 and 3  points is assigned to every question as None = 0  and increase the point 
from 1 to 3 per severity  for each question .  The question scores are summed up to an AAS daily 
score.  The daily AAS is summed up to AAS7 and AAS28.   Calculation is describe d as the 
following :  taking the first dose date/time  as the start point , sum of daily AAS score during each 
period divided by [CONTACT_784504] 7 days as AAS7 or 
multiplied by 28 days as  AAS28.  The minimum number of days  for a valid AAS7 and AAS28 is 
4 days per week and 3 weeks per 28 days, respectively .  Accordingly, the minimum and 
maximum possible AAS scores are 0 –15 for AAS daily score, 0–105 for AAS7, and 0 –420 for 
AAS28. 
AAS28 will be compared between ISIS 721744 80 mg every 4 weeks (or every 8 weeks) and 
pooled placebo using the MMRM model based on the FAS.   The MMRM model will include 
effects of treatment, time, treatment -by-time interaction, and baseline value.   The unstructured 
covariance model will be used to model the within patient errors, shared across treatment and 
small sample adjustments to standard errors and tests will be made following the Kenward -Roger 
approach (Kenward and Roger 1997 ).  
AAS scores will be listed  in by-patient listings .  
4.14. Other Analyses   
Psychometric analyses will be conducted for selected PRO assessments .  Details will be 
specified in a separate ana lysis plan.  
4.15. Determination of Sample Size   
The power and sample size estimations were calculated using simulations based on a 
generalized  linear model for count data assuming a Poisson distribution.  The primary endpoint 
is the time -normalized number of Investigator -confirmed HAE attacks (per every-4-week) from 
Week 1 to Week  25.  Assuming an HAE attack rate of 13.26 attacks per  6-month peri od in the 
placebo group and an HAE attack rate of 1.38 attacks per 6 -month period in the ISIS 721744 80 
mg every 4 weeks  group, the sample size of 54 patients (2:1 ratio [ISIS 721744  : placebo]) will 
provide at least 90% power for the primary endpoint, wit h a 0.05 significance level.  A total of 
approximately 84 patients (42 in the ISIS 721744 every -4-weeks group, 21 in the pooled placebo 
group, and 21 in the ISIS  721744 every -8-weeks group) will be enrolled in this trial to account 
for potential early drop outs and to facilitate some general safety evaluations.

The FAS represents the practically feasible intent-to-treat (ITT) population as delineated in 
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guideline E9.  This SAP choose to use FAS 
for the primary analysis of efficacy.  
Responder analyses will be perfor med by [CONTACT_784505] s, if specified in the SAP .  Compare to 
the Chi-square requested in the protocol, adjust ment for baseline  related covariates will generally 
reduce the variability of estimation  of treatment effects and thus lead to more powerful 
hypothesis testing.   
Rather than checking the distribution difference between treatment groups as ordinal variables  by 
[CONTACT_2329] a proportional odds model , PGIC and PGIS will be dichotomized to “better” and “no 
change or worse” and be  analyzed for treatment effect by [CONTACT_784506] .  
Additionally, t he change from baseline on PGIS at each visit  will be checked for the mean 
difference  as continuous variable  by [CONTACT_784507].

1  PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1 SYNOPSIS   
Title:  Phase 1/2 Trial of Indomethacin in Chronic Pancreatitis (The PAIR 
Trial)  
Study Des cription : Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a disabling disease that causes chronic 
pain, diabetes and malnutrition, and for which there is no effective, disease- modifying medical therapy. Preliminary studies suggest that 
widely available anti
-i
nflammatory drugs such as indomethacin, 
which decrease prostaglandin E2 ( PGE 2) production, could be 
repurposed to lessen the severity of CP. In this prospective, 
randomized,  placebo- controlled study , indomethacin or placebo will 
be given to patients with CP, and pancreas juice PGE [ADDRESS_160287] doses of indomethacin effectively suppress pancreatic PGE
2 production and 
would be suitable for large scale, multicenter trials, with the goal of 
improving pain and quality of life in patient s with this chronic illness.  
Objectives:  
 Primary Objective :  to assess the physiologic effect of orally 
administered indomethacin (IN) on pancreatic juice PGE 2 
concentrations in patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP). 
Secondary Objectives : A)  To correlate drug -induced changes in 
pancreatic juice PGE 2 levels with changes in salivary and blood 
PGE 2 levels, blood IN levels, and changes in patient -reported pain 
outcome (PRO) and quality of life (QOL), and B) to establish a basis 
for subsequent multicenter clinical trials of chronic COX -2 inhibition 
in CP .

Specific Aims:  
 
    Endpoint s:  1. To obtain steady -state pharmacologic data assessing the magnitude 
and variability of change in pancreas juice, blood, and saliva PGE 2 
concentrations after administration of oral IN or placebo to CP patients 
for 28 days.  
 2. To correlate changes in pancreas juice PGE 2 concentrations with 
changes in PRO and QOL after 28 days of study drug administration.  
Primary Endpoint : Decrease in mean pancreatic juice PGE 2 
concentration after indomethacin treatment, to no more than 66% of 
baseline, and statistically significant in comparison to placebo. 
Secondary Endpoints : C orrelation of pancreatic juice, blood, and 
saliva PGE 2 levels; correlation of post -treatment decreases in 
pancreas juice PGE 2 concentrations with improvements in patient -
reported outcomes ( pain and quality of life ).

2  INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE   
Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a chronic fibro -inflammatory disease.  There is no medical therapy 
that modifies the disease course of CP. Our long -term goal is to identify effective disease -
modifying therapeutic strategies for CP. Chronic inhibition of pancreatic prostaglandin E 2 
(PGE 2) production is one such promising strategy. Indomethacin (IN) is an inhibitor of COX -[ADDRESS_160290]  clinical oral dose of IN, administered for 
4 weeks, decreases PGE 2 concentrations in pancreatic juice, setting the stage for a subsequent 
large-scale clinical trial of IN in CP.  
PAIR Protocol  Version 1.0 
IRB #  23 May, 2019 
  5 PGE 2 is produced at sites of inflammation by [CONTACT_141219]- 2 enzyme (COX -2), which 
is overexpressed in the pancreas of humans with CP.  PGE 2 is a potent mediator of pancreatic 
chronic inflammation and stellate cell activity. Pancreas juice (PJ) PGE 2 concentrations are 
elevated in patients with CP and suspected early or “minimal change” CP (MCCP) compared to 
normal volunteers. PJ can be collected during GI endoscopy and subsequently assayed for PGE2 , providing a minimally invasive method of assessing pancreatic COX -[ADDRESS_160291] -ERCP pancreatitis, although the mechanism by [CONTACT_141220]. 
Chronic inhibition of pancreatic COX -2 is a  promising therapeutic strategy for CP, but there 
are no data regarding the drug, dose, and route of administration required for steady -state 
inhibition of human pancreatic COX -2 activity.   
2.2 BACKGROUND   
Significance  
There is currently no medical therapy that alters the natural history of chronic pancreatitis 
(CP).  CP is a chronic disease marked by [CONTACT_141221], fibrosis, and acinar loss, with 
clinical manifestations including chronic pain, bouts of acute pancreatitis, and loss of pancreatic 
functi on. CP is typi[INVESTIGATOR_141174], and/or by [CONTACT_141222].[ADDRESS_160292] progression of CP.  Induction of the 
cyclooxygenase 2 (COX -2) enzyme leads to production of thromboxanes and prostaglandins, 
including prostaglandin E2 ( PGE 2), a potent mediator of inflammation.  PGE 2 is a potent mediator 
of chronic inflammation and stellate cell activity in the pancreas, as shown in Figure 1 . COX -2 
activity is increased in human chronic pancreatitis tissue.6, 7 In normal human pancreas COX -2 
expression is limited to islets, but in both early -stage and advanced CP COX -2 is also expressed 
in human acinar and ductal cells.6, 7 In rat models of pancreatitis propagation of pancreatic 
inflammation is COX -2 dependent, 1 and COX -2 inhibition lessens the severity of CCK -
octapeptide- induced acute pancreatitis.8 In WBN/Kob rats who spontaneously develop CP, 
administration of r ofecoxib (a selective COX- 2 inhibitor) resulted in lower tissue PGE 2 levels and 
inhibition of pancreatic inflammation and fibrosis,9 however COX -2 knockout mice develop similar 
cerulean- induced chronic pancreatitis as wild- type mice.10 Sulindac attenuates inflammation and 
fibrosis in a mouse model of chronic pancreatitis,11 and a COX -2 inhibitor blocked response of

IRB #  [ADDRESS_160293] -ERCP 
pancreatitis has not been investigated in humans. No pharmacological data are available regarding COX -2 inhibition by [CONTACT_43203] -
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (ASA ) in human pancreas.  
Although rectal indomethacin decreases the incidence of post -ERCP pancreatitis,
[ADDRESS_160294] (ePFT).  During ePFT secretin is administered intravenously, 
causing secretion of pancreatic juice (PJ) into the duodenum.  The secreted PJ is suctioned from the duodenum via an endoscope and collected in timed aliquots, which are assayed for bicarbonate concentration (a measure of pancreatic exocrine function).  PJ aliquots collected 
during ePFT can be assayed for PGE
2, providing an assessment of pancreatic COX -2 activity. 
We will also assay saliva and blood PGE 2 levels to generate pi[INVESTIGATOR_141175] -2 in monocytes (A) produces PGE2 , which stimulates 
acinar cells (B) to release monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 
(MCP -1), recruiting additional monocytes and macrophages 
into the pancreas and propogating chronic pancreatic 
inflammation.1 In addition, stromal PGE2 stimulates human 
pancreatic stellate cell (C) activation via the EP4 receptor, 
inducing stellate cell COX -2 activity, PGE2 release, and 
stellate cell propogation, activation, collagen production, and 
pancreatic fibrosis.2 Figure 1: COX -2 and PGE2 in chronic pancreatitis

  7 with PJ PGE 2 levels; if correlation is high it may be possible to use these non- invasive 
biospecimens as surrogates for pancreatic juice in future studies. 
 
Preliminary Data: We m easured 
pancreas juice (PJ) PGE 2 levels in 
patients with CP (n=10), minimal change 
CP (MCCP) (n=25), and normal volunteers (n=10).
17 There were 
statistically significant elevations of PJ 
PGE 2 in both MCCP and CP compared to 
normal volunteers ( Figure 2). PJ PGE 2 
(at a cutoff of 300 pg/ml) had a diagnostic 
accuracy of 92% for MCCP, compared to 
62% for PJ bicarbonate concentration (at 
a cutoff of 80 mEq/L). These findings suggest that PJ PGE
2 levels may serve as 
a biomarker for pancreatic inflammation. 
Rationale for study drug dosage:   
There is no published data on the effect 
of IN on human pancreatic COX -2 activity. 
Usual clinical doses of oral indomethacin 
are 25- 50 mg BID to TID. This study’s 
dose of oral IN was chosen based on standard clinical dosing, published literature showing that 
similar blood levels are achieved with oral vs rectal administration, and the fact that steady -state 
administration of IN 50 mg BID orally should result in higher blood and tissue drug levels than 100 mg administered rectally once. Common side effects of  IN such as dyspepsia are often dose 
related.  Five doses of drug are required to achieve pharmacological steady state. 
NIH-sponsored 
 CPDPC Consortium : This protocol leverages resources of the NIH -funded, U01 
Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer (CPDPC) Consortium. An overriding 
objective of CPDPC is “to encourage translational research focusing upon elucidating the 
pathogenesis that will provide a basis for understanding the natural history and developi[INVESTIGATOR_141176], treatment and clinical management of chronic pancreatitis”. Mayo Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster (Santhi Vege – PI) and Ohio State University (Darwin Conwell – co- PI) are members of the 
CPDPC, which funds principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_141177], providing a 
unique collaborative infrastructure for the proposed trial.  
Impact of Study Findings: Thi
 s trial will provide physiologic and pharmacologic rationale, and 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_84944] -reported outcomes data, key to the design of subsequent studies of longer -term, daily 
IN administration to patients with CP. Such studies cannot be properly designed or funded without 
the data the current protocol will provide.  Identification of a disease- modifying medical treatment 
for CP will be a major clinical advance impacting the health of persons everywhere who suffer from this disabling chronic illness.

2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSM ENT   
 
2.3.1 KNOWN  POTENTIAL RISKS  
2.4 POTENTIAL RISKS  
Endoscopy, EUS, and ePFT:  Upper GI endoscopy (EGD) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) are 
routine clinical diagnostic  procedures that are typi[INVESTIGATOR_141178]. Diagnostic EGD and EUS have a low (< 1%) risk of risk of 
complications, including reactions to medications given for sedation, bleeding, infection, 
pancreatitis , perforation, or urgent surgery for complications.  All study participants will be 
undergoing a baseline clinically indicated EGD or EUS exam as well as a subsequent research EGD exam, with endoscopic pancreatic function tests (ePFTs) during both exams.  
ePFT is performed during EGD and EUS and involves administration of intravenous secretin. 
ePFT lengthens the duration of an endoscopic exam because pancreas juice is collected from 
the duodenum via the endoscope for 45 minutes after secretin administration.  There is no 
evidence that performance of ePFT increases the overall risks of EGD or EUS.  
Side effects of intravenous secretin administration occur in < 1% and include diaphoresis, 
hypotension, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting , mild pancreatitis, upset st omach,  diarrhea, 
flushing, and a warm sensation in the abdomen.  Acute pancreatitis was observed after 
intravenous secretin administration during MRI in 2/10,000 patients (0.02%).21 Contraindications 
to secretin administration include known hypersensitivity  to secretin. Secretin is commonly 
administered to patients with a history of prior acute pancreatitis or chronic pancreatitis, and there is no evidence that risks are increased in these patient populations. The secretin administered in this study is a recombinant protein identical to human secretin, thus risks of allergic reactions are 
very low.  
Indomethacin (
 IN) is a nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug (NSAID), and many drugs in this class 
are available over -the-counter . IN was chosen for use in this protocol because rectally 
administered IN is known to have a beneficial anti -inflammatory effect in human pancreas for 
prevention of post -ERCP pancreatitis. Like other NSAIDs, IN has a low risk of complications, 
including allergic reactions, gastrointestinal ulceration, GI bleeding, and a small increased risk of 
vascular events such as stroke or myocardial infarction.  Patients with a history of allergy to NSAIDS, current or past gastroduodenal ulceration, or past history of stroke, myocardial 
infarction, or coronary artery disease are excluded from participation in this study . 
Alternative approaches and treatments:
   The study protocol utilizes the least invasive, least risky 
method of assessing human pancreatic COX -2 activity  at baseline and after drug treatment.  
There are no effective medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_141179].  Study participants will be patients with CP who will be receiving concurrent care for their condition as 
clinically appropriate and as determined by [CONTACT_24018].  
PAIR Protocol  Version 1.0 
IRB #  23 May, 2019 
  9 Women who are pregnant or nursing: Risks of endoscopy and sedation may be increased in 
women who are pregnant or nursing, and they are excluded from participation in this study.  
Women of child -bea ring potential will undergo a urine pregnancy test within 48 hours of their 
research EGD exam.  In addition, at the time of enrollment (as detailed in the ICF) they must 
agree to one of the following birth control methods:  
 Hormonal methods, such as birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], patches, injections, vaginal ring, or implants  
 Barrier methods (such as a condom or diaphragm) used with a spermicide (a foam, cream, 
or gel that kills sperm)  
 Intrauterine device (IUD)  
 Abstinence (no sex)  
They must use birth control for the entire study and for at least [ADDRESS_160295] dose of study 
drug.  
Psychological, legal and financial risks: Study questionnaires will collect confidential information, 
including medical history, medications used, pain ratings, and quality of life information. Public 
release of this information might have adverse consequences for study participants. All study data 
will therefore be stored in secure paper files or de- identified, password- protected electronic 
databases.  
Protections Against Risk 
Endoscopic procedures will be performed on clinical GI Endoscopy Units at the current standard 
of clinical care at Mayo Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster and Ohio State University, including the use of monitored 
anesthesia care (MAC) or general anesthesia (GA) at the discretion o f the attending 
gastroenterologist and anesthesiologist.  Participants will receive pre- procedure evaluation, intra -
procedural monitoring, and post- procedural recovery care identical to that provided to patients 
undergoing endoscopy in these units.  Staff nurses, anesthetists, and GI endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_141180].  Participants will be discharged from the 
endscopy unit when they meet the unit’s standard discharge criteria.  
Subjects with a history of gastroduodenal ulceration, GI bleeding, stroke, myocardial infarction, 
or currently active acute pancreatitis are excluded from participation.  Subjects found to have 
active gastric or duodenal ulceration at the time of baseline endoscopy are also excluded.  Women 
who are pregnant or nursing and persons older than 7 0 years of age, who are at higher risk for 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_119162] -related adverse events, are also excluded from this study. 
Women  of child -bearing potential (i.e., women who are pre- menopausal and have not had a 
hysterectomy) must have a negative urine pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_160296] agree to remain sexually abstinent or use birth control measures (as detailed 
above) for the duration of their study participation and for [ADDRESS_160297].  
Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_141223] a study coordinator during their 4 weeks of study drug administration. The coordinator will ask about compliance with study medication, completion of the daily symptom and medication diary, and new or worsening symptoms or 
PAIR Protocol  Version 1.0 
IRB #  [ADDRESS_160298]. 
Subjects will be able to report symptoms or ask questions at other times by [CONTACT_756]. A study 
physician will be available to respond to subjects by [CONTACT_141224].  
Study enrollment logs containing  individually identifiable private information will be stored in 
secure non -public sites at each study site, as detailed above.   
Incidental findings noted during study endoscopy will be described in the clinical endoscopy report 
generated after each endoscopy exam, which is placed in the patient’s medical record.  Subjects will be informed of incidental findings and encouraged to follow -up with their clinical care 
professional about any incidental findings.  
 
2.4.[ADDRESS_160299] that NSAIDs may be such a therapy, 
suggesting that there is significant potential for future benefit of CP patients. The overall risks to 
subjects are low, and are outweighed by [CONTACT_658].

placebo treatment . 
 Exploratory hypotheses are: 
1) That peak blood IN levels at the conclusion of treatment will correlate with degree of 
change in pancreas juice (PJ)  PGE
2 concentrations.  
2) That baseline salivary and blood PGE 2 concentrations , and changes in these 
concentrations after treatment,  will correlate with blood and saliva PJ PGE 2 
concentrations.  
3) That improvement in pain and quality of life of study participants will correlate with changes in PJ PGE
2 concentrations.  
Overview : 32 participants with CP will be randomized to receive 28 days of IN 50 mg po BID or 
placebo (2 study arms). Blood, saliva, and pancreatic juice will be collected from each participant 
prior to study drug administration and again on the 28th day of study drug administration. 
Partic ipants will complete daily pain diaries as well as questionnaires assessing pain and quality 
of life at baseline and day 28. Primary outcome is a comparison of the mean change in PJ PGE 2 
concentrations at 28 days in the IN vs. placebo groups. Secondary outcomes include changes in 
PAIR Protocol  Version 1.0 
IRB #  23 May, 2019 
  12 pain and quality of life from baseline to 28 days in the IN vs. placebo groups, and their correlation 
with changes in PJ PGE 2 and blood IN concentrations, as well as correlation of PJ, saliva, and 
blood PGE 2 concentrations (to determine whether non- invasive measures correlate with PJ 
measures).  
 
Methods : Up to 40 participants will be 
enrolled in order to  accrue 32 participants 
who complete the study protocol. As shown in Figure 3, all study participants will 
undergo a biospecimen collection at baseline and day 28 including blood, saliva, 
and pancreatic juice (PJ). PJ will be 
collected during endoscopic pancreatic 
function tests (ePFT). Up to 4 weeks may 
elapse between the baseline biospecimen 
collection and day 1 of study drug 
administration. 16 participants will receive oral indomethacin 50 mg BID, and 16 will 
receive matched placebo BID. Participants 
will complete the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) 
and PROMIS 10 quality of life instrument at baseline and day 28, and will also complete daily symptom and medication diaries.  
Definitions : CP will be diagnosed per American Pancreatic Association criteria for definite CP.  
These include a compatible clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_141182]  (Cambridge 3 -4 ductal 
changes, and/or calcifications) on cross -sectional imaging studies.  
Study Interventions and Measures : T he endoscopic pancreatic function test (ePFT)  will be 
performed at baseline and on day 28.  ePFT is a standardized test used in medical 
pancreatology clinical practice that involves administration of intravenous secretin (0.2 mcg/kg slowly over one minute) to stimulate pancreatic juice secretion, followed by [CONTACT_6149][INVESTIGATOR_141183]. Some subjects will undergo a baseline 
ePFT as part of their routine clinical care; other subjects, who are having upper GI endoscopy or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) performed as part of their clinical care, will undergo ePFT during endoscopy for resear ch purposes. Fluid will be aspi[INVESTIGATOR_141184] 0- 10 and 10 -20 minutes following secretin administration, and processed 
per CPDPC pancreas juice/fluid SOP. Participants will be instructed to take their study dru g 2 
hours prior to their follow- up research endoscopy with ePFT on day 28.  
PJ bicarbonate and lipase concentrations  w
 ill be measured on duodenal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_141185] a previously validated method. 18 PGE 2 concentrations  will be measured in saliva, 
blood, and pancreatic juice from baseline and day 28 using a tandem mass spectroscopy assay developed and validated at Mayo Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster.  Peak IN drug levels  will be measured in blood 
on day 28, providing an assessment of participant compliance with study drug administration.  
The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)  and the PROMIS -10 are validated scales that quantify pain and 
quality of life, respectively, and will be completed at baseline and day 28. A medication and pain 
diary  will be completed daily by [CONTACT_141225] 28 -day treatment period,  Figure 3: Study Flowchart

Randomization, Allocation and Blinding 
Randomization: Subjects will be assigned to receive IN or placebo according to a computer 
generated randomization list composed of randomized blocks of sizes of 2 or 4. Two separate 
sets of blocks will be created, one for subjects with alcoholic CP and the other for those with other 
causes of CP. Within each block, equal number of subjects will be assigned to IN and placebo. Separate sets of randomization blocks will be provided for Mayo and Ohio State. The 
randomization lists will be computer generated by [CONTACT_4305] ([CONTACT_141246]), and kept in a 
secure computer file and paper study binder in the Mayo and Ohio State Research Pharmacies.  No investigators or study personnel other than [CONTACT_141246] will have knowledge of the randomization list.  [CONTACT_141246] will not participate in any aspect of subject  recruitment, subject allocation, conduct of the 
study, or data ascertainment, but will perform data analysis.  
Subject allocation w
 ill be known only to the staff of the Mayo and Ohio State Research 
Pharmacies, who will assign subjects to IN or placebo according to their randomization list provided by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Li. Allocation will be performed by [CONTACT_141226]’s study number with the 
randomization list. Allocation will not be revealed to subjects, investigators, other study 
personnel, or clinicians caring f or subjects until all subjects have completed the clinical trial or 
for medical emergency. Because subjects, investigators, and study personnel will be blinded, 
they will not be able to determine subject allocation before or during data ascertainment.  
In case a subject is allocated to receive study medication, but is withdrawn from the study 
before completing the protocol, study medication will be returned to the Research Pharmacy for disposal, and the following subject will be assigned the same allocation.  All investigators will 
remain blinded to the allocation of the withdrawn subjects and their replacements.  
Blinding : Study medication will be labelled “indomethacin 50 mg or placebo capsule” with the 
subject’s name, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_141187], study IRB number, and subject number. Placebo and IN capsules will be identical in appearance. The investigators, study coordinator, and clinical 
caregivers will remain blinded to subject allocation throughout the data ascertainment and data entry phase of the study.  
The success of blinding will be evaluated by [CONTACT_141227], the study coordinator, and 
the subject the following question during their final study visit: “Which treatment group is this subject/were you assigned to: placebo, active drug, or unsure?”  
Statistical Analysis and Sample Size  
For Specific Aim 1, the primary analysis will be a linear random intercept model that incorporates 
PJ PGE [ADDRESS_160300] correlation will be 
PAIR Protocol  Version 1.0 
IRB #  [ADDRESS_160301] correlations will be useful for designing a subsequent 
larger study.  
For Specific Aim 2, we will use multivariate analysis of variance model (MANOVA) with repeated 
measures. The multivariate outcomes include patient -related outcomes (BPI [INVESTIGATOR_141188] -10 
scores) and PJ PGE
[ADDRESS_160302] covariates include 
randomized groups, time, and their interactions. Additional secondary analyses include descriptive analysis and statistical comparison of PJ PGE
2 concentrations at baseline and after 
secretin administration between the various study groups, and correlations between baseline PJ 
PGE 2 levels, clinical features, and changes in plasma and saliva PGE 2 levels. Changes in daily 
pain ratings and narcotic use (in morphine equivalents) will be analyzed in comparison to changes 
in PJ PGE [ADDRESS_160303]  to show that the treatment group has significantly 
lower mean PGE 2 than the placebo group. In our previous publication on PJ PGE 2,20 we reported 
that median PJ PGE 2 level in 10 CP patients was 307 pg/ml with IQR of 249- 362 pg/ml and 
standard deviation of 84 pg/ml. The boxplot of that data suggests that normality is a reasonable distributional assumption for the PGE
2 data. That study also found that mean PJ PGE 2 in a healthy 
control group was 104 pg/ml, about one third of the mean level of the CP group. If we conservatively assume that the control group in the proposed trial has 50% decrease in mean, 
with a Type I error of 0.05, the power of the t -test is 0.998. If we use an even more conservative 
mean for the control group, with 1/3 reduction in mean PGE
2, the power is 0.94. If we additionally 
assume that there is some data loss (due to consent withdrawal, dropout, or specimen 
mishandling) so that the sample size per treatment group is [ADDRESS_160304] 1/3, we will conduct a future study that focuses on patient 
centered outcomes; that s tudy is expected to have a larger sample size because those outcomes 
are expected to be less sensitive to the treatment than biomarkers. Only if indomethacin treatment achieves this result would longer -term trials of indomethacin at this dose be warranted.   The data 
from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_141189].  
Timeline and Feasibility: Both Mayo Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster (MCR) and Ohio State University (OSU) 
medical centers feature busy medical pancreatology practices.  Average monthly new patient 
PAIR Protocol  Version 1.0 
IRB #  23 May, 2019 
  15 volumes in GI and pancreas clinics at both sites are shown in Table 1. Based on these patient 
volumes we anticipate that 30 study participants will be easily accrued within 18 months (at a rate 
of approximately 1 participant/site/month), providing [ADDRESS_160305] established clinical research infrastructure for 
enrollment of persons with CP into the PROCEED natural history cohort study of the C PDPC 
Consortium; PAIR study participants may be co- enrolled in PROCEED or may enroll in 
PROCEED after completing PAIR. Endoscopic pancreatic function tests (ePFT) are routinely 
performed for clinical indications at both MCR and OSU, and we have previously performed and reported results of PJ PGE2  assays.  
 
  
Synergy with CPDPC Consortium : This 
protocol will benefit from synergies due to the presence of PROCEED study infrastructure at Mayo 
[COMPANY_002]ster and Ohio State, including established methods of subject enrollment and biospecimen handling.   
Potential B

  19 Participants in both study arms will receive study medication, one capsule orally BID for 28 
days.  Those in the indomethacin arm will receive indomethacin 50 mg BID, and those in the 
placebo arm will receive placebo capsules BID. 
 
Participants will be advised not to make up missed doses. They will be advised to take a dose of 
study medication on the morning of their follow -up endoscopy, 2 hours prior to their scheduled 
procedure time, with a sip of water.  At the time of follow -up endoscopy they will return any 
unused study medication.  
 
6.2 PREPARATION/H ANDLING/ STORAGE/ ACCOUNTABILITY  
 
6.2.1  ACQUISITION AND ACCO UNTABILITY  
 
Indomethacin capsules are purchased by [CONTACT_141229]. Mayo Clinic

6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION  AND BLINDING  
 
Randomization: Subjects will be assigned to receive IN or placebo according to a computer 
generated randomization list composed of randomized blocks of sizes of 2 or 4. Two separate 
sets of blocks will be created, one for subjects with alcoholic CP and the other for those with other causes of CP. Within each block, equal number of subjects will be assigned to IN and 
placebo. Separate sets of blocks will be provided for Mayo and Ohio State. The randomization 
lists will be computer generated by [CONTACT_4305] ([CONTACT_141246]), and kept in a secure computer 
file and paper study binder in the Mayo and Ohio State Research Pharmacies.  No investigators 
or study personnel other than [CONTACT_141246] and staff at Mayo/OSU research pharmacies will have knowledge of the randomization list.  D r Li will not participate in any aspect of subject 
recruitment, subject allocation, conduct of the study, or data ascertainment, but will perform data analysis  with de- identified data . 
 
Subject allocation will be known only to the staff of the Mayo and Ohio State Research 
Pharmacies, who will assign subjects to IN or placebo according to their randomization list 
provided by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Li. Allocation will be performed by [CONTACT_141226]’s study number with the 
randomization list. Allocation will not be revealed to subjects, investigators, other study 
personnel, or clinicians caring for subjects until all subjects have completed the clinical trial or 
for medical emergency. Because subjects, investigators, and study personnel will be blinded, they will not be able to determine subject allocation before or during data ascertainment.  
 Allocation will be performed on the day of the participant’s baseline endoscopy with pancreas 
juice collection.  One container of study medication containing 28 days of medication (56 
capsules) will be dispensed to the participant that day.  
 In case a subject is allocated to receive study medication, but is withdrawn from the study before completing the protocol, study medication will be returned to the Research Pharmacy for 
disposal.  
 
Blinding : Study medication will be labelled “indomethacin 50 mg or placebo capsule” with the 
subject’s name, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_141187], study IRB number, and subject number. Placebo and 
IN capsules will be identical in appearance. The investigators, study  coordinator, and clinical 
caregivers will remain blinded to subject allocation throughout the data ascertainment and data entry phase of the study.  
 
The success of blinding will be evaluated by [CONTACT_141227], the study coordinator, and 
the subject the following question during each telephone follow -up visit: “Which treatment group 
is this subject/were you assigned to: placebo, active drug, or unsure?”  
 
 
6.4 STUDY INTERVENTION  COMPLIANCE  
 
Participants will complete a daily symptom and medication diary. Unused study drug will be 
returned by [CONTACT_141230] -up endoscopy procedure. Unused capsules 
will be counted, documented and returned to the research  pharmacy for disposal.  I ndomethacin 
levels will be measured in blood collected on the morning of the follow -up endoscopy procedure.

  22 a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). 
These contact [CONTACT_9145]’s medical record or study file.  
• Should the participant  continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason o f lost to follow -up. 
 
[ADDRESS_160318] (ePFT)  will be performed at baseline and on day 28.  ePFT  is a 
standardized test used in medical pancreatology clinical practice that involves administration of 
intravenous secretin (0.2 mcg/kg slowly over one minute) to stimulate pancreatic juice secretion, followed by [CONTACT_6149][INVESTIGATOR_141199]. Some subjects will undergo a baseline ePFT as part of their routine clinical care; other subjects, who are having upper GI endoscopy or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) performed as part of their clinical care, will undergo ePFT for res earch 
purposes during their baseline, clinically indicated endoscopy. Fluid will be aspi[INVESTIGATOR_141200] 0- 10 and 10 -20 minutes following secretin administration, and 
processed per CPDPC pancreas juice/fluid SOP. Participants will be instructed take their study drug with 
a sip of water 2 hours prior to their follow -up research endoscopy with ePFT on day 28.  
PJ bicarbonate and lipase concentrations  will be measured on duodenal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_141201] a previously validated method.18 PGE2  concentrations  will be measured in saliva, blood, and 
pancreatic juice from baseline and day 28 using a tandem mass spectroscopy assay developed and 
validated at Mayo Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster.  Peak IN drug levels  will be measured in blood on day 28, providing an 
assessment of participant compliance with study drug administration.  Exploratory analysis  of molecular 
analytes  (cytokine and microbiome)  in blood and saliva  will be done to measure effect of IN administration.

This test will be performed for research purposes , and the result placed in the patient’s medical record, 
if it is not being performed clinically .  Participants with serum creatinine outside of the laboratory 
normal range will be withdrawn from the study and considered non -accrued.  
 
Blood draw  will be up to 30 cc at study visit 1 (baseline) and up to 20 cc at study visit 3 (day 28). This 
includes up to [ADDRESS_160319] of clinical care at 
Mayo Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster and Ohio State University, including the use of monitored anesthesia care (MAC) or general 
anesthesia (GA) at the discretion of the attending gastroenterologist and a nesthesiologist.  Participants will receive 
pre-procedure evaluation, intra -procedural monitoring, and post -procedural recovery care identical to that provided 
to patients undergoing endoscopy in these units.  Staff nurses, anesthetists, and GI endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_541] s will be available to 
assess symptoms and adverse events and provide appropriate treatment during endoscopic procedures and their recovery period.  Participants will be discharged from the end oscopy unit when they meet the unit’s standard 
discharge criteria.  
Secretin Administration :
  Secretin will be administered intravenously during GI endoscopy procedures at baseline 
and day 28  at a weight -based dose of 0.2 mcg/kg administered slowly over one minute . Fluid will 
be aspi[INVESTIGATOR_141200] 0- 10 and 10-20 
minutes following secretin administration, and processed per CPDPC pancreas juice/fluid SOP.

sites at each study site, as detailed above.   
Incidental findings  no ted during study endoscopy will be described in the clinical endoscopy report generated after 
each endoscopy exam, which is placed in the patient’s medical record.  Subjects will be informed of incidental 
findings and encouraged to follow -up with their clinical care professional about any incidental findings.  
   
8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
8.3.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERS E EVENTS  (AE)  
 
“Adverse event” means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in 
humans, whether or not considered intervention -related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).  
 
 
8.3.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOU S ADVERSE EVENTS  (SAE)  
 
An adverse event (AE ) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: d eath, a life -threatening adverse 
event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  Examples 
relevant to this trial include adverse effects of GI endoscopy and its associated sedation that result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or gastrointestinal hemorrhage or vascular events in subjects receiving indomethacin.  
 
 
8.3.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN  ADVERSE EVENT  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
 
For adve rse events ( AEs) the following guidelines will be used to describe severi ty.  
 
PAIR Protocol  Version 1.0 
IRB #  23 May, 2019 
  25 • Mild  – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant ’s daily 
activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant ’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating.   Of note, the term  “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUD Y INTERVENTION  
 All adverse events ( AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_141233] a nd evaluates the participant  based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. 
The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect.  
 
• Definitely Related  – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study intervention  administration and cannot be 
explained by [CONTACT_9153]. The response to withdrawal of the study intervention  (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be 
pharmacologically or phenomenologically definitive,  with use of a satisfactory rechallenge 
procedure if necessary. 
• Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within 
a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention , is unlikely to be attributed to 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is no t required to fulfill this definition.  
• Potentially  Related  – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, other factors may have contribut ed to the event (e.g., the participant ’s clinical condition, other 
concomitant events). Although an AE  may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it 
can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or 
“definitely related”, as appropriate.  
• Unlikely to be related  – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose 
temporal relationship to study intervention  administration makes a causal relationship 
improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the 
study intervention ) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides 
plausible explanations (e.g., the participant ’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
• Not Relat ed – The AE is completely independent of study  intervention  administration, and/or 
evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an 
alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
 
PAIR Protocol  Version 1.0 
IRB #  23 May, 2019 
  26 Drs. Vege and Han, the study co -PIs, will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event ( AE) 
is expected or unexpected.  An AE  will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of 
the event is not consistent with the risk  information previously described for the study intervention . 
 
Expected adverse events include (but are not limited to) allergic reactions to study medication, adverse 
effects of indomethacin such as upset stomach, vomiting, heartburn, diarrhea, constipation, bloating, flatus, rash, itching, tinnitus, lightheadedness. Serious adverse events may include gastrointestinal ulceration, bleeding, perforation or obstruction as well as renal insufficiency or known complications of GI endoscopy.  However the protoco l has been designed to minimize the risk of these SAEs by [CONTACT_141234], NSAID -induced gastrointestinal ulceration or 
renal insufficiency.  
8.3.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
 
The occurrence of an adverse event (AE ) or serious adverse event (SAE ) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits or weekly scheduled telephone interviews of a study participant , by 
[CONTACT_141235], or when a participant  present s for 
medical care.  
 All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAE s will be captured on the 
appropriate  case report form  (CRF). Information to be collected includes event descripti on, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be d ocumented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be 
followed to adequate resolution.  
 Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant  is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if t he study participant’s condition  deteriorates at any 
time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity  to be performed. A Es characterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
 The study coordinators  will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after 
informed consent is obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of 
study participation.  At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
 
 
8.3.5  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTIN G  
 
AEs will be reported to the study PIs within 24 hours, and summarized in quarterly reports to the study DSMB as well as annual reports to the IRB, FDA  and NIH.  Furthermore, AEs will be reported to 
additional regulatory agencies (such as the FDA) if and as required.  
 
8.3.6  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
PAIR Protocol  Version 1.0 
IRB #  23 May, 2019 
  27  
According to 21 CFR 312. 64(b), “An investigator must immediately report to the sponsor any serious 
adver se event, whether or not considered drug related, including those listed in the protocol or 
investigator brochure and must include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the event. Study endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g., all -cause mortality) 
must be reported in accordance with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal 
relationship between the drug and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In that case, the investigator 
must immediat ely report the event to the sponsor …” 
 
According to 21 CFR 312.32(c)(1), “ the sponsor must notify FDA and all participating investigators…in an 
IND safety report of potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for 
reporting… In each IND safety report, the sponsor must identify all IND safety reports previously 
submitted to FDA concerning a similar suspected advers e reaction, and must analyze the significance of 
the suspected adverse reaction in light of previous, similar reports or any other relevant information. The 
sponsor must report any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected. The sponsor  
must report an adverse event as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event, such as:  
 
(A) A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome);  
(B) One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon rupture);  
(C) An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known 
consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that 
commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those 
events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical 
control group.”  
 
Furthermore, according to 21 CFR 312.32(c)(2), “the sponsor must also notify FDA of any unexpected 
fatal or life -threateni ng suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than 7 
calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information.”  
 The study clinician s will immediately report to the DSMB any serious adverse event, whether or not 
conside red study intervention  related, including those listed in the protocol  or ICF,  and must include an 
assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention  caused the event. 
Study endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g., all -cause mortality) must be reported in 
accordance with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the study intervention  and the event (e.g., dea th from anaphylaxis). In that case, the investigator must 
immediately report the event to the sponsor . 
 
All serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the site 
investigator deems the event to be chronic or the par ticipant is stable. Other supporting documentation 
of the event may be requested by [CONTACT_4318], IRB, FDA, or NIH  and should be provided as soon as 
possible.  
 
The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_141203] ( FDA)  of any unexpected f atal 
or life -threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible , but in no case later than 7 calendar 
PAIR Protocol  Version 1.0 
IRB #  23 May, 2019 
  28 days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information.   In addition, the sponsor must notify FDA and 
all participating investigators in an I nvestigational New Drug ( IND) safety report of potential serious 
risks, from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, but in no case later than [ADDRESS_160322]  
 Not applicable.  
 
8.3.9  REPORTING OF PREGNAN CY  
 If a study participant reports that they are pregnant they will be advised to immediately discontinue study drug use.  Study endoscopic procedures will not be performed on pregnant participants.  Pregnant 
participants will be withdrawn from the study.  
 
 
8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLE MS 
 
8.4.1  DEFINITION OF U NANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP) 
 
The Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to 
participant s or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of the 
following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research  procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)-
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
participant  population being studied;  
• Related or pos sibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]); and  
• Suggests that the research places participant s or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
  An incident, experience, or outcome that meets the definition of an UP may  warrant consideration of 
changes to the protocol or consent in order to protect the safety, welfare, or rights of participants or 
PAIR Protocol  Version 1.0 
IRB #  23 May, 2019 
  29 others. Other UPs may warrant corrective actions at a specific study site. Examples of corrective actions 
or changes that mig ht need to be considered in response to an UP include:  
 
• Modification of inclusion or exclusion criteria to mitigate the newly identified risks  
• Implementation of additional safety monitoring procedures  
• Suspension of enrollment of new participants or halting  of study procedures for enrolled 
participants  
• Modification of informed consent documents to include a description of newly recognized risks  
• Provision of additional information about newly recognized risks to previously enrolled participants. 
 
8.4.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLE M REPORTING  
 
The investigator will report unanticipated problems ( UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) and t o the DSMB . The UP report will include the following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
number;  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP ;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or ICF, or other corrective actions that have been 
taken or are proposed in response to the UP . 
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UP s will be reported using the following timeline:   
 
• UPs that are  serious adverse events ( SAEs) will be reported to the DSMB immediately, and to 
the IRB within 7 days  of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
• Any other UP  will be reported to the DSMB within 30 days  of the investigator becoming aware 
of the probl em, and summarized in quarterly reports to DSMB and annual reports to the IRB, 
FDA and NIH .  
• All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_17347]’s 
written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), and the Office for 
Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) within 3 months  of the IRB’s receipt of the report of th e 
problem from the investigator.  
 
 
8.4.3  REPORTING UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  TO PARTICIPANTS  
 
UPs that are SAEs may require revision of the study informed consent form (ICF).  In that case, study 
participants who are active participants (taking study drug or scheduled for study endoscopy) will be 
informed of the revisions to the ICF and re -consented.  
 
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS   
 
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
 
PAIR Protocol  Version 1.0 
IRB #  23 May, 2019 
  30 Primary Endpoint :  
• Decrease in mean pancreatic juice PGE 2 concentration after indomethacin treatment, to 
no more than 66% of baseline, and statistically significant in comparison to placebo.  
 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints :  
• Changes in salivary and blood PGE [ADDRESS_160323] 
statistically significant correlat ion with changes in PJ PGE 2 concentrations and blood IN levels.  
• Salivary and blood PGE [ADDRESS_160324] statistically significant correlation with PJ PGE 2 
concentrations.  
• Improvement in pain and quality of life of study participants will have statistically significant 
correlation with post-treatment changes in PJ PGE 2 concentrations.  
• Exploratory analysis  of molecular analytes (cytokine and microbiome) in blood and saliva will be 
done to measure effect of IN administration.  
 
 
 
9.[ADDRESS_160325] to show that the treatment group has 
significantly lower mean PGE 2 than the placebo group. In our previous publication on PJ PGE 2,20 we 
reported that median PJ PGE 2 level in 10 CP patients was 307 pg/ml with IQR of 249- 362 pg/ml and 
standard deviation of 84 pg/ml. The boxplot of that data suggests that normality is a reasonable 
distributional assumption for the PGE 2 data. That study also found that mean PJ PGE 2 in a healthy control 
group was 104 pg/ml, about one third of the mean level of the CP group. If we conservatively assume that 
the control group in the proposed trial has 50% decrease in mean, with a Type I error of 0.05, the power of 
the t-test is 0.998. If we use an even more conservative mean for the control group, with 1/3 reduction in 
mean PGE 2, the power is 0.94. If we additionally assume that there is some data loss (due to consent 
withdrawal, dropout, or specimen mishandling) so that the sample size per treatment group is [ADDRESS_160326] a future study that focuses on patient centered 
outcomes; that study is expected to have a larger sample size because those outcomes are expected to be less sensitive to the treatment than biomarkers. The data from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_141204].

9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
 
9.4.1  GENERAL APPROACH  
 
For descriptive statistics, categorical and continuous data will be presented as percentages or medians 
with ranges as appropriate.  P -values < 0.5 will be considered statistically significant.  
 
9.4.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIM ARY EFFICACY ENDPOIN T(S)  
For the Primary Endpoint/Specific Aim 1, the primary analysis will be a linear random intercept model that 
incorporates PJ PGE [ADDRESS_160328] 
correlations will be useful for designing a subsequent larger stud y.  
 
9.4.3  ANALYSIS OF THE SECO NDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
For Secondary Endpoints/Specific Aim 2, we will use multivariate analysis of variance model (MANOVA) 
with repeated measures. The multivariate outcomes include patient -related outcomes (BPI [INVESTIGATOR_141188]-
10 scores) and PJ PGE [ADDRESS_160329] covariates include randomized 
groups, time, and their interactions. Additional secondary analyses include descriptive analysis and 
statistical comparison of PJ PGE 2 concentrations at baseline and after secretin administration between the 
various study groups, and correlations between baseline PJ PGE 2 levels, clinical features , and changes in 
plasma and saliva PGE 2 levels. Changes in daily pain ratings and narcotic use (in morphine equivalents) 
will be analyzed in comparison to changes in PJ PGE [ADDRESS_160330] data from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_141205].  
 
9.4.5  BASELINE DESCRIPTIVE  STATISTICS  
 Baseline descriptive statistics will compare the IN and placebo groups on variables including age, gender, cause of pancreatitis (if known), time since the most recent epi[INVESTIGATOR_141206] 1.0 
IRB #  23 May, 2019 
  32 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], presence and duration of diabetes,  exocrine insufficiency, pancreas enzyme 
replacement therapy (PERT)  and history of occasional NSAID or ASA use.

 This section should give a genera l description of how monitoring of the conduct and progress of the 
clinical investigation wil l be co nducted (i.e., who will conduct the monitoring, the type, frequency, and 
extent of monitoring, who will be provided reports of monitoring, if independent audits  of the 
monitoring will be conducted).  This section may refer to a separate detailed clinical monitoring plan.   
 A separate clinical monitoring plan (CMP)  should describe in detail who w ill conduct the monitoring, 
at what frequen cy monitoring w ill be d one, at what level of deta il monitoring w ill be perform ed, and 
the distribution of monitoring reports.   A CMP  ordinarily should focus on preventing or mitigating 
important and likely risks, identified by a risk assessment, to critical data and processes. The types (e.g., on -site, centralized), frequency (e.g., early, for initial assessment and training versus thr oughout 
the study), and extent (e.g., comprehensive (100% data verification) versus targeted or random review of certain data (less than 100% data verification)) of monitoring activities will depend on a range of factors, considered during the risk assessment, including the complexity of the study design, types of study endpoints, clinical complexity of the study population, geography, relative experience of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_141212] P I, electronic data capture, relative safety of the study 
intervention, stage of the study, and quantity of data.

10.1.8 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL : 
 Each clinical site will perform internal quality management of study conduct, data and biological specimen  collection, documentation and completion.  An individualized quality management plan will be 
developed to descri be a site’s quality management.  
 Qual ity control ( QC) procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and data QC 
checks that will be run on the database will be generated. Any missing data or data anomalies will be communicated to the site(s) for clarification/resolution.  
 Following written Standard Operating Procedures ( SOPs ), the monitors will verify that the clinical trial is 
conducted and data are generated  and biological specimens are collected, documented (recorded), and 
reported in compliance with the protocol, Inte rnational Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical 
Practice (ICH GCP ), and applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., Good Laboratory Practices ( GLP), Good 
Manufacturing Practices ( GMP )).

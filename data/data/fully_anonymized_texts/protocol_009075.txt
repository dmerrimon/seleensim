astuzumab (herceptin; Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) is a humanized mono-
clonal antibody targeting the extracellular domain of the human epi[INVESTIGATOR_13392] 2 (HER2) protein. Amplification or overexpression of Her2 is seen in

dysfunction, limitations in data collection and differences in study design of the two 
studies of trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting precluded a determination of whether the 
toxicity profile of trastuzumab in older patients was different from younger patients. The 
reported clinical experience was also not adequate to determine whether the efficacy 
improvements (ORR, TTP, OS, DFS) of trastuzumab treatment in older patients was 
different from that observed in patients <[ADDRESS_267837] cancer patients considering age-related 
changes in physiology and an increased incidence of comorbidities? Will single agent

owth factors and their receptors play critical roles in development, cell growth, 
differentiation, and apoptosis.25 Such receptors span the cell membrane, with the 
extracellular domain binding specific growth factors and the intracellular domain 
transmitting growth signals. Interaction of the extracellular domain with its cognate 
ligand often results in intracellular activation of tyrosine kinase activity. Overexpression 
of human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2 (HER2, also known as erbB2, neu, and

cytotoxicity in the presence of human effector cells.[ADDRESS_267842] synergy, in vitro and in vivo, with several chemotherapeutic drugs 
including cisplatin, doxorubicin, thiotepa, etoposide, vinorelbine, and taxanes.36-41 Given 
this promising preclinical data, Trastuzumab was tested in the clinic both as a single

Amplification or overexpression of Her1 is also seen in approximately 15-50% of women 
with invasive breast cancers, and is also associated with an unfavorable prognosis.42 
Inhibition of both her1 and Her2 receptor types should therefore improve optimal 
inhibition of tumor growth and survival. Recently, Lapatinib ditosylate

[CONTACT_4658]) or gene amplification (by [CONTACT_4656]). HER2 testing was verified by a central laboratory 
prior to randomization (N-9831) or was required to be performed at a reference 
laboratory (NSABP-31). Patients with a history of active cardiac disease based on 
symptoms, abnormal electrocardiographic, radiologic, or left ventricular ejection fraction 
findings or uncontrolled hypertension (diastolic >100 mmHg or systolic >200 mmHg) 
were not eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive doxorubicin and 
cyclophosphamide followed by [CONTACT_222890]. In both 
trials, patients received four 21-day cycles of doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and 
 
CASE [ZIP_CODE] 12/28/2018  P age 10 of 85 
    
cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2. Paclitaxel was administered either weekly (80 mg/m2) or 
every 3 weeks (175 mg/m2) for a total of 12 weeks in NSABP-31; paclitaxel was 
a
dministered only by [CONTACT_222891] N9831. Trastuzumab was administered 
at 4 mg/kg on the day of initiation of paclitaxel and then at a dose of 2 mg/kg weekly for 
a total of 52weeks. Radiation therapy, if administered, was initiated after the completion 
of chemotherapy. Disease-free survival (DFS), defined as the time from randomization to 
recurrence, occurrence of contralateral breast cancer, other second primary cancer, or 
death, was the primary endpoint of the combined efficacy analysis. A total of 3752 
patients were included in the efficacy analyses. Overall, there were 1,736 patients in the 
B-31 trial and 1,615 patients in N-9831, and at the time of the combined analysis, the 
median follow-up was 2.0 years.  Compared with the control arm, the trastuzumab arm 
showe
d a statistically signficant increase in 3-year disease-free survival (DFS), 75.4% vs 
87.1% respectively, p<0.0001;HR=0.48, 95% CI (0.39-0.59). The cumulative incidence 
of class III or IV heart failure was 0.8% in the control group and 4.1% in the trastuzumab 
group.   
 
Three other important trials in addition to the two pi[INVESTIGATOR_222851]. The HERA (Herceptin 
Adjuvant) trial focused on determining the optimal duration of trastuzumab for early-
stage breast cancer.18 Patients were randomized to one of three arms: observation, 
trastuzumab every 3 weeks for 1 year, or trastuzumab every 3 weeks for 2 years. 
Trastuzumab was dosed with 8 mg/kg IV followed by 6 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks 
thereafter.  Patients had either node-negative disease if tumor size >1cm (32.1%) or node-
positive disease, and all patients had HER2-positive tumors.  At a median follow-up of 2 
years, the addition of trastuzumab to neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy resulted in 
a statistically signficant improvement in DFS (86.1% vs 78%) and overall survival 
(96.9% vs 93.6%).  Further analysis is expected to determine if 2 years is superior to a 
year of treatment.   
 
The BCIRG 006 trial aimed at maximizing the efficacy of trastuzumab while minimizing 
cardiac toxicity.47 The trial enrolled 3,222 patients with node-positive or high-risk lymph 
node-negative HER2-positive tumors to 1 of 3 arms: doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide 
every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by [CONTACT_222892] 3 weeks for 4 cycles (ACT); or 
the same regimen plus 52 weeks of trastuzumab,weekly during chemotherapy then every 
3 weeks during follow-up (ACTH); or docetaxel-carboplatin every 3 weeks for 6 cycles 
plus 52 weeks of trastuzumab with the same schedule as given in arm 2 (TCH). At a [ADDRESS_267845] Conference, the 2 
trastuzumab arms showed a statistically significant improvement in DFS compared with 
the control arm. Symptomatic cardiac events and an LVEF decline >15% were 
statistically significantly greater in the ACTH group compared with the ACT. There was 
no statistically significant difference between the ACT and TCH groups in terms of 
cardiac side-effects. This trial shows that fewer cardiac events are observed when 
trastuzumab is administered without prior anthracycline-based therapy. There was no 
statistically significant difference in terms of disease free survival across the two 
trastuzumab-containing arms.   
 
The FinHer trial involved 1,010 patients randomized to docetaxel every 3 weeks for three 
doses versus 9 weeks of vinorelbine followed, in both groups, by [CONTACT_222893] [ZIP_CODE] 12/28/2018  P age 11 of 85

trastuzumab (p=  0.01).   
 
1.[ADDRESS_267849] cancer has been 
demonstrated in two pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491].  
 
A large Phase II trial (H0649g) assessed the activity of trastuzumab as a single agent in 
[ADDRESS_267850] cancer with progressive disease 
after one or more chemotherapy regimens.49 A blinded, independent response evaluation 
committee identified 8 complete and 26 partial responses, for an objective response rate 
of 15% in the intent- to-treat population (95% confidence interval, 11% to 21%). The 
median duration of response was 9.[ADDRESS_267851] common adverse events, which occurred in approximately 40% of 
patients, were mild to moderate infusion-associated fever and/or chills. These symptoms 
usually occurred only during the first infusion. The most clinically significant event was 
cardiac dysfunction, which occurred in 4.7% of patients. 
 
A large, open-label, randomized Phase III study (H0648g) in [ADDRESS_267852]-line treatment. Patients who were anthracycline-
naïve were randomized to receive either anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide (AC) or 
trastuzumab plus AC. Patients who had received prior anthracyclines in the adjuvant 
setting were randomized to receive either paclitaxel or trastuzumab plus paclitaxel. 
Patients randomized to trastuzumab and chemotherapy measurably benefited in 
comparison to patients treated with chemotherapy alone in terms of time to disease 
progression, overall response rate, median duration of response, and survival. As 
determined by [CONTACT_94971] (REC), trastuzumab 
prolonged median time to disease progression from 4.6 months to 7.4 months (p<0.001), 
improved the overall response rate (complete and partial responses) from 32% to 50% 
(p<0.001), and increased median duration of response from 6.1 to 9.1 months (p<0.001). 
Compared to chemotherapy alone, the addition of trastuzumab significantly lowered the 
incidence of death at one year from 33% to 22% (p=0.008) and increased median overall 
survival 24% from 20.3 months to 25.1 months (p=0.046). The observed survival 
advantage remained despi[INVESTIGATOR_94901] 66% of patients initially randomized to 
chemotherapy alone who elected to receive trastuzumab upon disease progression.50 
F
ever/chills were observed with the initial trastuzumab infusion in approximately 25% of 
patients. Class III or IV cardiac dysfunction was observed in 16% of the Trastuzumab + 
 
CASE [ZIP_CODE] 12/28/2018  P age 12 of 85 
    
AC subgroup; increasing age was an associated risk factor for the development of 
cardiotoxicity in this treatment cohort.  
 
Based on these data, trastuzumab was approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for use in HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer in 
combination with paclitaxel for first-line treatment and as a single agent for patients 
failing prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. However, current usage patterns of 
trastuzumab indicate that the drug is now being used in a broader array of circumstances 
than in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_40798]. Since initiation of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_40798], docetaxel 
ha
s become a commonly used taxane in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer [ADDRESS_267853] emerged on the weekly use of paclitaxel52. Trastuzumab has been studied 
in combination with paclitaxel and docetaxel using a variety of doses and schedules with 
promising results.53-55 In addition, the combination of trastuzumab with vinorelbine has 
re
cently been studied.56 In this study, 30 of 40 women treated with trastuzumab (4 mg/kg 
x 1, 2 mg/kg weekly thereafter) and vinorelbine (25 mg/m2 weekly, with dose adjusted 
each week for neutrophil count) responded to therapy, for an overall response rate of 75% 
(95% confidence interval 57% to 89%). Neutropenia was the only grade IV toxicity. No 
patients had symptomatic heart failure. Grade 2 cardiotoxicity was observed in 3 patients; 
prior cumulative doxorubicin dose in excess of 240 mg/m2 and borderline pre-existing 
cardiac function were associated with this toxicity. 
 
1.[ADDRESS_267854] significant safety signal observed during clinical trials was cardiac dysfunction 
(principally clinically significant heart failure [CHF]), particularly when Herceptin was 
given in combination with an anthracycline-containing regimen. Much of the cardiac 
dysfunction was reversible on discontinuation of trastuzumab.  
 
I
n addition, during the first infusion with trastuzumab, a symptom complex most 
commonly consisting of fever and/or chills was observed in approximately 40% of 
patients. The symptoms were usually mild to moderate in severity and controlled with 
acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, or meperidine. These symptoms were uncommon with 
subsequent infusions. However, in the post approval setting, more severe adverse 
reactions to trastuzumab have been reported. These have been categorized as 
hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis), infusion reactions, and pulmonary 
events. Rarely, these severe reactions culminated in a fatal outcome. 
 
The
re are no adequate or well-controlled studies in pregnant women, and animal 
reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response.  Therefore, 
trastuzumab should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother 
outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. In the post marketing setting, oligohydramnios 
(decreased amniotic fluid) has been reported in women who received trastuzumab during 
pregnancy, either in combination with chemotherapy or as a single agent.   Given the 
limited number of reported cases, the high background rate of occurrence of 
oligohydramnios, the lack of clear temporal relationships between drug use and clinical 
findings, and the lack of supportive findings in animal studies, an association between 
trastuzumab and oligohydramnios has not been established.   
 
 
CASE [ZIP_CODE] 12/28/2018  P age 13 of 85 
    
Trastuzumab appears to be relatively nonimmunogenic. Only 1 of 903 patients evaluated 
developed neutralizing antibodies to trastuzumab. The development of anti-Herceptin 
antibodies in this patient was not associated with clinical signs or symptoms.  
 
1.7 CLINICAL PHARMACOKINETICS OF TRASTUZUMAB 
A 
Phase I single dose study (H0407g) of intravenous trastuzumab infusions ranging from 
10-500 mg resulted in dose-dependent pharmacokinetics (PK) with serum clearance of 
tra
stuzumab decreasing with an increasing dose at doses <250 mg .  PK modeling of 
trastuzumab concentration-time data from 7 patients that were administered doses of 250 
mg and 500 mg had a mean half-life of 5.8 days (range 1-32 days).  Additionally, PK 
modeling
 showed that weekly trastuzumab doses ≥250 mg result ed in serum trough levels 
of 
>20 
 that was above the minimum effective concentration observed in 
preclinical xenograft studies in tumor-bearing mice. The Phase I data supported the 
we
ekly dosing schedule that was implemented in all subsequent Phase II and Phase III 
clinical trials. A weight-based dose schedule was adopted after two Phase II trials 
(H0551g and H0552g) suggested that inter-subject variability in trastuzumab PK was 
related to body weight.  These findings resulted in a trastuzumab dose schedule of a 
4 mg/kg loading dose followed by a weekly 2 mg/kg maintenance dose utilized in the two 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_222852] (H0648g and H0649g) that were the basis of the BLA filing  and 
subsequent FDA approval of trastuzumab for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer.  
 
The trastuzumab PK data from studies H0407g (Phase I), H0551g (Phase II), and H0649 
(pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735]) have been subsequently reanalyzed by a population PK approach using 
nonlinear mixed effect modeling (NONMEM).[ADDRESS_267855] of pathophysiologic covariates (e.g.  age, weight, shed antigen) on the 
PK parameter estimates.  The covariates, that significantly influenced clearance, were the 
level of shed antigen and the number of metastatic sites. Volume of distribution was 
significantly influenced by [CONTACT_94972].  Additionally, data from the 
Phase III study, H0648g, were added to assess the influence of concomitant 
chemotherapy on trastuzumab PK.  Importantly, chemotherapy (AC or paclitaxel) did not 
significantly alter trastuzumab PK. The estimated half-life of trastuzumab based on the 
final model was 28.5 days. 
 
Analysis of data obtained from two Phase II studies which utilized a loading dose of 
8 mg/kg trastuzumab followed by a 6 mg/kg maintenance dose administered every 3 
we
eks (q3 week) as a single-agent40, and in combination with paclitaxel (175 mg/m2)58, 
confirmed that a two-compartment model best describes the PK of trastuzumab. Model-
independent analysis of the data obtained in these studies gives comparable PK parameter 
estimates to those obtained by [CONTACT_78013], thus confirming the validity of 
the population PK model.   In addition, the population PK model adequately predicted 
trastuzumab serum concentrations obtained independently in these studies.  After two 
treatment cycles, trastuzumab exposure were similar to those measured in the once 
weekly dosing regimen used in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_6518]. Trough levels were in excess of the 
targeted serum concentrations established from preclinical xenograft models, and as 
expected, peak levels were greater than those observed upon weekly administration. The 
 
CASE [ZIP_CODE] 12/28/2018  P age 14 of 85 
    
apparent half-life of trastuzumab in these studies was determined to be approximately 21 
days, and the PK was supportive of a q3 week dosing schedule. 
 
The
 efficacy and safety results from these Phase II studies with q3 week dosing do not 
appear to be different from those with weekly dose-schedules16,49,59.  In the trastuzumab 
q3 weekly monotherapy study40, 105 patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer were 
treated, with an objective response rate of 19% (23% in patients with measurable 
centrally confirmed HER2+ disease).  The median baseline LVEF was 63%, which did 
not significantly change during the course of the study.  One patient experienced 
symptomatic CHF, which resolved with medical treatment for CHF and discontinuation 
of trastuzumab.  In the study of q3 weekly trastuzumab and paclitaxel58, 32 patients were 
treated with an investigator-assessed response rate of 59%.  Ten patients had a decrease 
in LVEF of 15% or greater.  One patient experienced symptomatic CHF, which improved 
symptomatically after medical therapy for CHF and discontinuation of trastuzumab. 
 
1.[ADDRESS_267856] accomplished by [CONTACT_222894]-gated acquisition scans or echocardiography techniques20 These 
measurements do not, however, provide early detection of abnormalities. A plausible 
explanation for the lack of early detection of cardiac abnormalities may be attributable to 
physiologic compensations for significant damage, with abnormalities only becoming 
e
vident when physiologic compensations are no longer possible. The need for a screening 
tool that could reveal trastuzumab related cardiac toxicity in a more sensitive and 
immediate manner cannot be over emphasized and hence the rationale for measuring 
plasma
 physiologic cardiac markers in this study and to determine it’s correlation with 
trastuzumab-related cardiac dysfunction.   
 
Cardiac troponin, a component of the myocardial contractile apparatus, is released after 
just one cycle of chemotherapy and is more frequently abnormal with each cycle in 
patients who ultimately develop left ventricular dysfuction64. Pretreatment levels of N-
terminal brain natriuretic protein (NT-proBNP) has also shown promise regarding the 
prediction of trastuzumab-related cardiac toxicity and requires further exploration65 
Lastly, inflammatory immune activation is an important feature of chronic heart failure 
and therefore physiologic markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor 
alpha (TNF- ) levels maybe useful as early predictors of trastuzumab-related cardiac 
dysfunction.66-68

1.9    COMPREHENSIVE GERIATRIC ASSESSMENT BACKGROUND AND 
         RATIONALE 
C
omprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is a multidisciplinary evaluation which 
assesses function, comorbidity, nutrition, cognition, emotional, psychological and social 
support, and a review of medication list for polypharmacy and drug interactions. It is a 
key tool currently recommended as an integral part of the treatment and follow-up of the 
older patient with cancer.69 The rationale for integrating the principles of geriatrics 
evaluation into oncology care for older cancer patients is to use this assessment to 
determine an estimation of life expectancy and treatment tolerance, allowing a common 
language beyond that provided by [CONTACT_222895]. The expectations are that this 
approach will result in improved treatment outcomes in older patients with cancer.  
 
Domains of the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment 
 
F
unctional status  
Functional status refers to a patient's ability to perform routine daily tasks and is an 
independent predictor for mortality in both the geriatric70 and geriatric-oncology71 
population. Impaired functional status also increases the risk of toxicity due to 
chemotherapy.72 An accurate assessment of functional status will therefore increase 
identification of those at risk for non-adherence to chemotherapy and those at increased 
risk of dying from cancer. The commonly used performance status scores (eg, Karnofsky 
or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scales tend to under-represent the 
degree of functional impairment in the older patient.73  Functional state is better reflected 
b
y the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living 
(IADL) scales. ADLs are the skills that are necessary for basic living, and include 
feeding, grooming, transferring, and toileting. IADLs are required to live independently 
in the community and include activities such as shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], managing finances, preparing 
meals, housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and taking medications.  
 
Co-morbidity 
Co-morbidity is an important factor to consider in determining the prognosis of patients 
with a cancer diagnosis. As an individual ages, the number of comorbid medical 
conditions increases making comorbidity an important domain of a CGA.[ADDRESS_267857] of comorbidity on chemotherapy 
tolerance was illustrated in a study of patients age 
 70 years with advanced non–small 
c
ell lung cancer.75 In this study patients with a Charlson Comorbidity Index of 
 2 were 
more likely to discontinue chemotherapy earlier than patients with a comorbidity score 
<2. Because comorbidity has been shown to be independent of functional status is it is 
important that both domains are assessed when evaluating an older patient with cancer.76 
 
Cognitive function  
Cognitive function plays an important role in the outcome of the older patient with cancer 
and therefore is an important domain that needs to be assessed. In the geriatric oncology 
 
CASE [ZIP_CODE] 12/28/[ADDRESS_267858] of weight loss and low Body Mass Index (BMI) have been 
demonstrated in all older patients including those with cancer.80,81 In a study among older 
cancer patients enrolled in 12 chemotherapy protocols of the Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) weight loss was associated with a lower performance status, a 
decrease in chemotherapy response rates in women with breast cancer, and was found to 
be an independent prognostic factor for survival.82 The importance of a thorough 
nutritional assessment and the development of interventions to improve nutritional status 
among malnourished older cancer patients cannot be overemphasized. 
 
Social support and psychological state  
S
ocial isolation has been linked to an increased vulnerability to psychological distress 
among geriatric patients83 and an increase in mortality among both geriatric and oncology 
patients. 84,85  Additionally studies of geriatric assessment show that 14-40% of older 
patients have depressive symptoms. Depression among older patients with cancer is 
associated with receipt of sub-optimal therapy86, increased toxicity to chemotherapy72, 
and increased mortality72. An assessment of the social support and psychological state of 
an older cancer patient is therefore essential as an appropriate intervention is likely to 
improve outcomes among older patients with cancer.  
 
Polypharmacy 
Age-related physiological changes include a decrease in total body water, an increase in 
body fat, a decrease in renal function, a decrease in hepatic mass and blood flow, and 
decrease in bone marrow reserve. Polypharmacy is prevalent among older patients. In the 
older cancer patient age-related changes in physiology, polypharmacy and cancer therapy 
can contribute to drug interactions and adverse drug events. A CGA of an older cancer 
patient should therefore include a review of prescribed medications with the 
discontinuation of nonessential medications, evaluation of potential drug interactions, and 
a review of expected side effects from prescribed medications.

3.0      STUDY DESIGN 
 
3.1 DES CRIPTION OF THE STUDY 
This is an open label, single arm, multi-institutional, phase II pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  One hundred 
and twenty-four patients 60 years and older with early-stage HER2+ invasive breast 
c
ancer who undergo appropriate primary tumor therapy (mastectomy or lumpectomy) 
with either sentinel or axillary lymph node dissection, will be enrolled and undergo 
treatment with single agent Trastuzumab at 8mg/kg IV loading dose, followed by 6mg/kg 
IV every three weeks to complete 52 weeks of treatment. Patients will receive additional 
adjuvant radiation therapy and/or endocrine therapy according to standard institutional 
practice.  Patients will be followed prospectively for five years after entry into study or 
until death, whichever comes first.  
 
Participating institutions include the Seidman Cancer Center and its satellites, Cleveland, 
Ohio, University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], Pennsylvania, Wake Forest University, 
W
inston-Salem, North Carolina and University of Miami, [LOCATION_012]. 
 
3.[ADDRESS_267865] cancer clinical trials of chemotherapy8,13, trastuzumab was administered to only 
274 patients (6%) who were 65 years and older (141 (adjuvant) and 133 (metastatic)) out 
of 
[ADDRESS_267866] cancer 
precluded a determination of whether the toxicity profile of trastuzumab in older patients 
was different from younger patients. The reported clinical experience was also not 
adequate to determine whether the efficacy improvements (ORR, TTP, OS, DFS) of 
trastuzumab treatment in older patients was different from that observed in patients <[ADDRESS_267867] also been largely limited to 
y

treatment with trastuzumab 4 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 2 mg/kg weekly, or a 
higher 8 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 4mg/kg weekly. Randomization was used to 
ensure that estimates of the efficacy outcomes within each dose level would not be biased 
by [CONTACT_222896]. Response rates 
in111 assessable patients with 3+and 2+ HER2 overexpression by [CONTACT_9064] 
(IHC) were 35% (95% CI, 24.4% to 44.7%) and none (95% CI, 0% to 15.5%), 
respectively. The response rates in108 assessable patients with and without HER2 gene 
amplification by [CONTACT_26707] (FISH) analysis were 34% (95% CI, 
23.9% to 45.7%) and 7% (95% CI, 0.8% to 22.8%), respectively. There was no clear 
evidence of a dose-response relationship for response, survival, or adverse events. 
Cardiac dysfunction occurred in two patients (2%); both had histories of cardiac disease 
and did not require additional intervention after discontinuation of trastuzumab. This 
study demonstrates the efficacy and safety of single agent trastuzumab in the metastatic 
setting and forms the basis for the need for further exploration of single agent 
trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting, particularly among older patients who may have pre-
existing cardiac disease that may not allow the administration of trastuzumab in 
combination with chemotherapy. Also since advanced aged has been identified as a risk 
factor for the development of trastuzumab-related cardiac toxicity19, a cautious approach 
is needed when clinical trials of trastuzumab, that specifically focuses on older patients, 
are designed and hence the decision to utilize trastuzumab as a single agent in this trial.  
 
A Phase I PK study (H0407g) supported a weekly dosing schedule that was implemented 
in all subsequent Phase II and Phase III clinical trials. A weight-based dose schedule was 
adopted after two Phase II trials (H0551g and H0552g) suggested that inter-subject 
variability in trastuzumab PK was related to body weight.  These findings resulted in a 
trastuzumab dose schedule of a 4 mg/kg loading dose followed by a weekly 2 mg/kg 
maintena
nce dose utilized in the two pi[INVESTIGATOR_94902] (H0648g and H0649g) that 
were the basis of the BLA filing  and subsequent FDA approval of trastuzumab for 
HER2+ metastatic breast cancer. Subsequently, two Phase II studies utilized a loading 
dose of 8 mg/kg trastuzumab followed by a 6 mg/kg maintenance dose administered 
e
very 3 weeks (q3 week) as a single-agent40, and in combination with paclitaxel 
(175 mg/m2)58.The  efficacy and safety results from these Phase II studies with q3 week 
dosing do not appear to be different from those with weekly dose-
schedules16,17,49.Similarly, in the adjuvant setting trials utilizing a weekly dose

3.4 OUT COME MEASURES 
   
3.4.1.  PRIMARY OUTCOME MEAS URE  
The primary outcome measure is the three-year cumulative incidence of cardiac events 
and is defined by [CONTACT_207133]; 
 De finitive cardiac death; due to CHF, MI, or documented arrhythmia  
 An y possible/probable cardiac death over the three-year follow-up period 
de
fined as a sudden unexpected death within 24 hours after a definitive 
cardiac event , and without definitive documented alternative cause.  
 S igns and symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF). CHF will be defined 
as follows: [LOCATION_001] Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV symptoms 
with either a decrease from baseline in LVEF of more than 10 percentage 
points to less than 55% or a decrease of more than [ADDRESS_267875]. LVEF will be determined with either a MUGA 
or e
chocardiogram. 
 
Cardiac Assessment for primary outcome measure 
 MUG A scans or echocardiogram will be required at study entry, at 3, 6, 9,  
and at 12months after study entry to assess primary outcome measure. 
 Additi onal MUGA scans or echocardiograms after 12 months will be at 
treating physician’s discretion except for one dditional MUGA scan or 
echocardiogram that will be performed at 60 months for long-term cardiac 
moni
toring.  
 P atients who develop significant left ventricular dysfunction will have 
MUGA scans at four week intervals until return of normal function.  
 Cardiac history every 6 months until end of study. 
 
Anal
ysis of primary outcome measure 
Descriptive statistics, such as means, median, range, and frequencies, will be used to 
describe subjects’ cardiac toxicity profile. The incidence of cardiac dysfunction and its 
confidence interval will be estimated using Wilson’s method.[ADDRESS_267876] the incidence will be identified by [CONTACT_222899].  
 
3.4.2   SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  The one-year cumulative incidence of asymptomatic left ventricular cardiac 
dysfunction defined as an asymptomatic decrease in LVEF from baseline of at 
least ten percentage points to below the lower limit of normal or an absolute 
 
CASE [ZIP_CODE] 12/28/2018  P age 24 of 85 
    
decrease of >15 percentage points leading to a permanent discontinuation of 
trastuzumab before completion of one year of trastuzumab therapy. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. The  five-year cumulative incidence of asymptomatic left ventricular cardiac 
dysfunction defined as an asymptomatic decrease in LVEF from baseline of at 
least ten percentage points to below the lower limit of normal or an absolute 
decrease of >15 percentage points at 60 months.. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. T he five-year cumulative incidence of cardiac events and defined as above 
under section 3. 4.1.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Me an change in plasma cardiac markers from baseline to mid-treatment, and 
from baseline to end of treatment.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Me an change in pro-inflammatory cytokines from baseline to mid treatment, 
and from baseline to end of treatment. Similar analysis as above will be done. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Me an change in QOL and CGA scores from baseline to mid treatment, and 
from baseline to end of treatment. Differences in QOL and GCA scores will 
be examined by [CONTACT_54959] t-test. 
  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Dise ase-free survival (DFS) defined as the time from initiation of treatment to 
the date of first loco-regional or distant treatment failure, ignoring any 
intervening contralateral breast cancers or other second primary cancers. 
Deaths without evidence of recurrence will be treated censoring events.                 
                 
                  Appearance of DCIS or LCIS either in the ipsilateral or in the contralateral 
                  breast will not be considered as an event for DFS (but must be reported on the 
                  Follow-Up Form). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Overall survival defined as the time from initiation of treatment to the date of 
death from any cause and censored to the date of last follow-up for survivors.  
 
Diagn
osis of treatment failure 
The diagnosis of first treatment failure depends on evidence of recurrent disease, which 
can be classified as either suspi[INVESTIGATOR_222854]. In either case, this should be specified 
and reported. Acceptable evidence of treatment failure according to site is defined below. 
Any events not included in this section are considered unacceptable as evidence o f 
recurrent disease. Treatment failures include: local, regional, and distant failures. To 
ensure consistency with definitions used in pi[INVESTIGATOR_222855]-lateral breast cancers and second primary cancers will not be 
considered treatment failures.[ADDRESS_267877] 
appearance of a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_134453], later proven to be a definitive recurrence or metastasis. 
All events described below should be recorded on the Follow-up Form 
 
 
 
 
 
CASE [ZIP_CODE] 12/28/2018  P age 25 of 85 
    
Local failu re 
Local failure is defined as a tumor recurrence in any soft tissues of the ipsilateral (or in 
the case of bilateral, either)  conserved breast or the chest wall, mastectomy scar, and/or 
skin.  
 
Acceptable for recurrence in ipsilateral conserved breast: positive cytology or histology 
Acceptable for recurrence in chest wall, mastectomy scar, and/or skin: positive cytology 
or histology or evidence of new lesions (by [CONTACT_462]) without any obvious benign 
etiology. 
 
Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_15665]: a visible or palpable lesion. 
Appearance of DCIS or LCIS either in the ipsilateral or in the contralateral breast is not 
considered a treatment failure. 
 
Treatment after local relapse for patients who received breast-conserving surgery: 
Patients may continue to receive the protocol treatment after resection of a relapse in the 
ipsilateral conserved breast, an option that reflects the controversy concerning therapy for 
reappearance of disease in the ipsilateral breast. Continued treatment is only allowed 
when there is no evidence of loco-regional disease outside the breast or of distant disease 
at the time of breast relapse. Details of the local treatment for the conserved breast 
relapse must be recorded on the Follow-up Form. Patients who develop a local relapse 
other than a relapse in the ipsilateral conserved breast should change therapy. 
 
Regional failure 
Regional failure is defined as a tumor recurrence in the ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes, 
extranodal soft tissue of the ipsilateral axilla, ipsilateral internal mammary lymph nodes, 
and/or ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph nodes. For patients with bilateral breast cancer at 
randomization, failure in the previously-listed regional nodes should be recorded as 
regional failure (rather than distant) on the Follow-Up Form. The side (right or left) of the 
nodes should be recorded. 
 
Acceptable: positive cytology or histology or evidence of new lesions by [CONTACT_222900] a benign etiology. 
Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_15665]: a visible or palpable lesion.  
 
Contralateral breast failure 
Appearance of invasive breast cancer ,DCIS or LCIS in the contralateral breast is not 
considered an event for DFS.  
 
Distant failure 
Tumors in all areas other than those defined above are considered distant metastases. The

3.5      SAFETY PLAN 
P
atients will be evaluated at each study visit for the duration of their participation in the 
study (see Section 4.0 (Study Calendar) ). 
 
S
pecific potential safety issues for this trial are outlined below. 
 
3.5.[ADDRESS_267879] frequently 
among patients who received Trastuzumab plus AC chemotherapy (28%), compared with 
those who received AC alone (7%), Trastuzumab plus paclitaxel (11%), paclitaxel alone 
(1%), or Trastuzumab alone (7%).  Severe disability or fatal outcome due to cardiac 
dysfunction was observed in ~1% of all patients. 
 
The nature of the observed cardiac dysfunction was similar to the syndrome of 
anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy.  The signs and symptoms of cardiac dysfunction 
usually responded to treatment.  Complete and partial responses were observed among 
patients with cardiac dysfunction.  The risk appears to be independent of tumor response 
to therapy.  Analysis of the clinical database for predictors of cardiac dysfunction 
revealed only advanced age and exposure to an anthracycline as possible risk factors.  In 
the clinical trials, most patients with cardiac dysfunction responded to appropriate 
medical therapy, often including discontinuation of Trastuzumab.  In many cases, patients 
were able to resume treatment with Herceptin.  In a subsequent study using weekly 
paclitaxel and Trastuzumab as first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer, the 
observed incidence of serious cardiac dysfunction was 3% (N=95).[ADDRESS_267880] several 
years, with many of the new drugs demonstrating the ability to normalize cardiac 
function. Patients who develop symptoms of congestive heart failure while on 
Trastuzumab should be treated according to the HFSA guidelines (Appendix D).  
             
            Man
agement of Cardiac Safety for Adjuvant Breast Cancer Protocols 
All pa
tients must have a MUGA scan or ECHO at baseline, and on a regular schedule 
throughout the course of the study.  Investigators are strongly urged to schedule MUGA 
scans/ECHOs at the same radiology facility where the patient’s baseline MUGA 
scan/ECHO was done whenever possible.  MUGA scans/ECHOs are required at protocol-
spe
cified time points and after any patient has any of the following: discontinuation of 
protocol therapy, congestive heart failure, breast cancer recurrence, or a second primar y 
cancer.  When a cardiac event occurs, the Cardiac Report Form must be faxed in within 
14 days of learning of the event.   
 
 
CASE [ZIP_CODE] 12/28/[ADDRESS_267881] significant symptoms related to LV dysfunction, 
administration of Trastuzumab will depend on the absolute change in LVEF 
between baseline and follow-up assessments. 
Trastuzumab should be initiated in an asymptomatic patient if: 
a) The
 LVEF increased or stayed the same; 
b) The LVEF decreased by <15 percentage points but is still at or above 
the lower limit of normal for the radiology facility. 
 
Trastuzumab is PROHI BITED in an asymptomatic patient if: 
a) The LVEF decreased <15 percentage points and is below the limit of 
normal for the radiology facility: 
b) The LVEF decreased by 16 percentage points or more (regardless of 
lower limits of normal for the radiology facility)  
 
Symptomatic Patients 
If a patient has significant symptoms related to left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, 
cardiac ischemia, or arrhythmia, initiation of trastuzumab is prohibited. 
 
M
anagement of Symptomatic Cardiac Changes.    
P
atients who develop signs and symptoms of CHF should have Trastuzumab held and 
should receive treatment for CHF as prescribed by [CONTACT_30553] (e.g., ACE inhibitors, 
angiotensin-II receptor blockers, -blockers, diuretics, and cardiac glycosides, as needed; 
see Appendix C for HFSA guidelines).  Consideration should be given to obtaining a 
cardiac consultation.   
 
If the symptoms of CHF resolve with treatment, and cardiac function improves, 
trastuzumab may be continued after discussion with the patient concerning the risks and 
benefits of continued therapy.  If the patient is benefiting clinically from trastuzumab, the 
benefit of continued treatment may outweigh the risk of cardiac dysfunction.  If 
trastuzumab is restarted, continued surveillance with noninvasive measures of LVEF 
(MUGA or ECHO) is strongly recommended until cardiac function has normalized. 
 
Management of Asymptomatic Decreases in LVEF.    
Trastuzumab may be continued in patients experiencing an asymptomatic absolute 
decrease in LVEF of <20 percentage points from baseline, when the ejection fraction 
remains within the imaging center’s range of normal limits.  Repeat measures of LVEF 
 
CASE [ZIP_CODE] 12/28/2018  P age 30 of 85 
    
should be obtained using the methodology selected at baseline.  Close follow-up of such 
patients is recommended.  Patients with an asymptomatic absolute decrease in LVEF of 
20 percentage points or an ejection fraction below the range of normal limits, should 
ha
ve trastuzumab held and be considered for treatment of incipi[INVESTIGATOR_222857] (e.g., ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor blockers, - blockers, diuretics, 
and cardiac glycosides, as needed; see Appendix C for HFSA guidelines).  In light of the 
variability inherent in the assessment of ejection fraction, consideration should be given 
to repeating the study to confirm an observed decline.  Repeat measures of LVEF should 
be obtained using the same methodology selected at baseline.  If trastuzumab has been 
discontinued for an asymptomatic decline in LVEF, a repeat measure of LVEF will be 
obtained in 1 month to determine if the decline has resolved. 
 
If cardiac function improves, trastuzumab may be restarted after discussion with the 
patient concerning the risks and benefits of continued therapy.  If the patient is benefiting 
clinically from trastuzumab, the benefit of continued treatment may outweigh the risk of 
cardiac dysfunction. If trastuzumab is restarted, continued surveillance with noninvasive 
measures of LVEF (MUGA or ECHO), using the methodology selected at baseline, is 
strongly recommended until cardiac function has normalized. 
 
 Table [ADDRESS_267882] infusion with trastuzumab, a 
symptom complex consisting of chills and/or fever is observed in approximately 
40% of patients. Other signs and/or symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, 
pain, rigors, headache, cough, dizziness, rash, and asthenia. These symptoms are 
usually mild to moderate in severity, and occur infrequently with subsequent 
trastuzumab infusions. These symptoms can be treated with an 
analgesic/antipyretic such as meperidine or paracetamol, or an antihistamine such 
as diphenhydramine.  Table 3: Asymptomatic Decrease in LVEF: Percentage Points from Baseline

CASE [ZIP_CODE] 12/28/[ADDRESS_267885] been reported 
infrequently.   In rare cases (4 per 10,000), these events were associated with a 
clinical course culminating in a fatal outcome. Serious reactions have been treated 
with supportive therapy such as oxygen, beta-agonists, corticosteroids and 
withdrawal of trastuzumab as indicated. 
3.5.4 
 Hematologic Toxicity and Neutropenic Infections  In the clinical trials, an 
increased incidence of anemia was observed in patients receiving trastuzumab 
plus chemotherapy compared with patients receiving chemotherapy alone.  The 
majority of these anemia events were mild or moderate in intensity and reversible; 
none resulted in discontinuation of trastuzumab therapy.   
In the clinical trials, the per-patient incidences of moderate to severe neutropenia 
and of febrile neutropenia were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab in 
combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to those who 
received chemotherapy alone. In the post marketing setting, deaths due to sepsis 
in patients with severe neutropenia have been reported in patients receiving 
trastuzumab and myelosuppressive chemotherapy, although in controlled clinical 
trials (pre- and post-marketing), the incidence of septic deaths was not 
significantly increased. The pathophysiologic basis for exacerbation of  
neutropenia has not been determined; the effect of trastuzumab on the 
pharmacokinetics of chemotherapeutic agents has not been fully evaluated.  
Secondary acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome has been reported in [ADDRESS_267886] 
cancer (7). Therefore, the contribution of trastuzumab to the etiology of acute 
leuke
mia or myelodysplastic syndrome in these cases is unclear. 
 
Management of Hematologic Toxicities 
Care should be taken to carefully monitor the patient’s hematologic status 
throughout the course of the trial.  Use of hematopoietic growth factors to 
ameliorate hematologic toxicity is at the discretion of the physician investigator 
and should be in accordance with the American Society of Clinical Oncologists 
(ASCO) guidelines.

5.4      STUDY TREATMENT   
Genentech will supply Herceptin. 
 
           5.4.1   Herceptin Formulation 
Herceptin is a sterile, white to pale yellow, preservative-free lyophilized powder 
for intravenous (IV) administration.  Each vial of Herceptin contains 440 mg of 
trastuzumab, 9.9 mg of L-histidine HCl, 6.4 mg of L-histadine, 400 mg of 
,-trehalose dihydrate, and 1.8 mg of polysorbate 20, USP.  Reconstitution with 
20 mL of the supplied Bacteriostatic Water for Injection (BWFI) USP, containing 
1.1% benzyl alcohol as a preservative, yields 21 mL of a multidose solution 
containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab, at a pH of ~6. 
 
           5.4.2   Herceptin Dosage, Preparation, Administration, and Storage  
           a. Dosage 
The recommended initial loading dose is 8 mg/kg Herceptin administered as a 
90-minute infusion.  The recommended maintenance Herceptin dose is 6 mg/kg 
q3wk and can be administered as a 30-minute infusion if the initial loading dose 
was well tolerated.  Herceptin may be administered in an outpatient setting.  DO 
NOT ADMINISTER AS AN IV PUSH OR BOLUS (see ADMINISTRATION).  
b.  Preparation 
Use appropriate aseptic technique.  Each vial of Herceptin should be reconstituted 
with 20 mL of BWFI, USP, 1.1% benzyl alcohol preserved, as supplied, to yield a 
multidose solution containing 21 mg/mL Herceptin.  Immediately upon 
reconstitution with BWFI, the vial of Herceptin must be labeled in the area 
marked “Do not use after” with the future date that is [ADDRESS_267889] be 
reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection (see PRECAUTIONS).  Herceptin 
which has been reconstituted with SWFI must be used immediately and any 
unused portion discarded.  Use of other reconstitution diluents should be avoided. 
Determine the dose of Herceptin needed, based on a loading dose of 8 mg 
Herceptin/kg body weight or a maintenance dose of 6 mg Herceptin/kg body 
weight.  Calculate the correct dose using  21 mg/mL Herceptin solution.  
Withdraw this amount from the vial and add it to an infusion bag containing 250 
mL of 0.9% sodium chloride, USP.  DEXTROSE (5%) SOLUTION SHOULD 
NOT BE USED.  Gently invert the bag to mix the solution.  The reconstituted 
preparation results in a colorless to pale yellow transparent solution.  Parenteral 
drug products should be inspected visually for particulates and discoloration prior 
to administration.

    [IP_ADDRESS].1   Trastuzumab may result in clinically manageable left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction, and occasionally 
advanced congestive heart failure (CHF) in a small 
proportion of patients. The incidence and severity of 
cardiac dysfunction has been greatest in patients who 
received Trastuzumab in combination with an 
anthracycline.  In the pooled NSABP/NCCTG 
experience, the risk of cardiac events was 4% among 
those treated with chemotherapy and trastuzumab, as 
compared with .6% for those given chemotherapy 
alone. There are data suggesting that the risk is lower 
when sequential chemotherapy followed by 
[CONTACT_222909], older patients and 
those patients with borderline normal LVEF at baseline 
may be at greater risk for cardiac events.  The

baseline of at least ten percentage points to below the lower limit of 
normal or an absolute decrease of >15 percentage points leading to a 
permanent discontinuation of trastuzumab before completion of one year

 Disease-free survival (DFS) defined as the time from treatment initiation 
to the date of first loco-regional or distant treatment failure, ignoring any 
intervening contra-lateral breast cancers or other second primary 
cancers. Deaths without evidence of recurrence will be treated as 
censoring events.

5.11.3         Sample Size Justification  
The
 target accrual of this study is 124 patients. The primary endpoint used in the sample 
size calculation is the cumulative incidence of cardiac events over a three-year period. 
We hypothesize that the incidence (P) of cardiac events in this trial will be no bigger than 
4% and that incidence of cardiac events bigger than 10% is considered unacceptable. 
W
ith a type I error of 0.05, the estimated sample size based on a two -sided chi-square test 
is 113. With 10% attrition rate, the sample size required for this study is [ADDRESS_267908] the null hypothesis H 0: P ≤ 0.04 vs. H a: P > 0.1 is 
above 80%. By [CONTACT_222911] 7 patients per institution per year, the enrollment i s 
e
xpected to complete within about 3.5 years. Our acceptable cardiac toxicity rate of 4% is 
de
rived from NSABP-B3120 study, in which the three-year cumulative incidence of 
symptomatic cardiac dysfunction was 4.1%. Our unacceptable cardiac toxicity rate of 
10% is derived from an overall cardiac dysfunction rate of up to 7%21,[ADDRESS_267909] of cardiotoxicity, assuming an exponential distribution 
for time to cardiotoxicity.  The timing of the interim analyses will be based on the 
number of cardiotoxicity events; analyses will occur when the cumulative number of 
events is 3, 6, 9, as well as at one year after enrollment of the last patient.  Thus, there 
will be up to three interim analyses.  At each interim analysis, we will use an exact one-
sided Poisson test to test the null hypothesis that the exponential hazard is less than or 
equal to 0.0136 (corresponding to a 4% 3-year event rate) versus the alternative 
hypothesis that it is 0.0351 or higher (corresponding to a 10% 3-year cardiotoxicity event 
ra
te). A Lan-DeMets type I error spending function with overall type I error rate of 0.05 
will be used to determine the significance level used at each analysis.  If the null 
hypothesis is rejected, then the trial will be stopped.   If the 3-year cardiotoxicity event 
ra
te is 10%, with 124 patients enrolled uniformly over two years and followed an 
additional 3 years, and allowing for 10% exponential loss due to death or dropout ove r 3 
y
ears, approximately 12 (11.78) cardiotoxicity events within 3-years of enrollment will 
be
 observed by [CONTACT_2054].  Therefore, the interim analyses occurring at 3, 6, 
and 9 cumulative events correspond approximately to information times of 0.25, 0.50, 
and 0.75.  Alternatively, if the true 3-year cardiotoxicity rate is 4%, then the expected 
tot
al number of cardiotoxicities observed over [ADDRESS_267910], for the 
primary analysis the 3-year incidence of cardiotoxicity will be estimated using the

 De
scriptive statistics, such as means, median, range, and frequencies, will 
be used to describe subjects’ cardiac toxicity profile.  
 Time 
to incidence of cardiac events will be measured from the date of 
treatment initiation to the date of cardiac event and censored at the date of 
last follow-up or the date of death due to non cardiac causes for those who 
do not have a cardiac event. The cumulative incidence of cardiac events  
a
nd its 95% confidence interval will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier104.  
 P
otential factors that predict the incidence of cardiac toxicity will be 
identified by [CONTACT_222912].109 
 P
earson’s correlation will be used to determine the correlation between 
cardiac markers and LVEF. 
 The difference in mean QOL and CGA scores from baseline to mid 
treatment, and from baseline to end of treatment will be examined by 
[CONTACT_54959] t-test. 
 The Kaplan-Meier method110 will be used to estimate disease-free survival 
and overall survival.  
 Cox proportional hazards regression models109 will be used to test selected 
variables as potential predictors of disease-free-survival and overall 
survival. 
 All 
eligible subjects who received at least one dose of trastuzumab will be 
included in survival (time- to-event) analysis.  
 All 
statistical testing will be two-sided and level of significance will be 
assumed at 5%.

enter, and reasons for non-adherence. Mean scores on the primary measures 
will be compared for patients with or without missing data at different 
assessment points in order to investigate whether missing data is arising from a 
systematic error and likely to introduce a bias into the analysis. If no missing 
data mechanism can be detected following this review, the data will be analyzed 
assuming the missing data are at random. In the case of item non-response, 
summed scores will be computed using the mean from the other items in the 
analysis. If a missing data mechanism appears to be present, we will undertake 
to develop an appropriate analytic strategy to control for the potential bias and, 
if possible, to impute the missing values. The appropriateness of alternative 
strategies will depend upon both the pattern (e.g., item non-response versus 
int
ermittent missing forms versus complete dropouts) and the severity of the 
missing data problem. For example, an appropriate strategy could 
involve the stratification of the patients in the study in terms of the completeness 
of their data for key time periods (e.g., 6 months or 1 year) and the comparison 
of results from separate analyses for each group or it could involve the 
implementation of more sophisticated imputation procedures designed to model 
a missing data mechanism within the framework of a repeated measure analysis.
 We will also present sensitivity analyses based on varying assumptions about 
the mis
sing-data mechanism. 
 
 5.[ADDRESS_267913].  Investigators are required to report to Genentech Drug Safety any 
serious adverse event , whether expected  or unexpected , and which is assessed 
by [CONTACT_222913] [ZIP_CODE] 12/28/2018  P age 50 of 85 
   He
rceptin.  All events meeting these criteria will be reported for the time perio d 
beginning with any amount of exposure to Herceptin through the protocol-defined 
follow-up period.  Serious criteria, definitions, and guidance for reporting follow. 
An adverse event  (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject 
participating in an investigational study or protocol regardless of causality 
assessment.  An adverse event can be an unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, syndrome or disease 
associated with or occurring during the use of an investigational product whether 
or not considered related to the investigational product. 
 
Serious adverse events  (SAE)  are adverse events occurring at any dose which 
meet one or more of the following serious criteria : 
 
Results in death  (i.e. the AE caused or led to death) 
 
I
s life-threatening  (i.e. the AE placed the subject at immediate risk of death; it 
does not apply to an AE which hypothetically might have caused the death if it 
were more severe) 
 
Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e. the AE required at least a 24-
hour inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_176253]; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86588]/surgical procedures, 
scheduled treatments, or routine check-ups are not SAEs by [CONTACT_44134]) 
 
Is disabling  (i.e. the AE resulted in a substantial disruption of the subject’s ability 
to carry out normal life functions) 
 
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  (i.e., an adverse outcome in a child or fetus 
of a subject exposed to the study drug prior to conception or during pregnancy) 
 
Does not meet any of the above serious criteria but may jeopardize the subject  
and may require medical or surgical intervention  to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above 
 
Expected  adverse events are those adverse events that are listed  or characterized 
in the Package Insert or current Investigator Brochure.  
 
Unexpected  adverse events are those not listed  in the Package Insert (P.I.) or 
current Investigator Brochure (I.B.).  This includes adverse events for which the 
specificity or severity is not consistent with the description in the P.I. or I.B.  For 
example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected if the P.I. or 
I.B. only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.

Recommendations for Pharmacological Therapy: 
Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction 
 
ß-Adrenergic Receptor Blockers 
 
Background for Recommendations 
 
The single most significant addition to the pharmacological management of heart failure 
since the publication of previous guidelines involves the use of ß-receptor antagonists. 
This represents a noteworthy departure from traditional doctrine in which ß-blocking 
agents were classified as contraindicated in the setting of left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction. A solid foundation of both clinical and experimental evidence now firmly 
supports their use in heart failure with the aim of reducing both morbidity and mortality 
(16,22,23). 
 
ß-Blocker therapy for heart failure has been advocated by [CONTACT_95026] 
1970s 
(24). During the subsequent 2 decades, many small- to medium-sized placebo-
controlled trials, which used a variety of agents, showed several common findings: 1) the 
use of ß-blockers in mild to moderate heart failure was generally safe when initiated at 
low doses and gradually up titrated under close observation; 2) improvement in left 
ventricular ejection fraction was observed in all trials that lasted at least 3 months; and 3) 
there was wide variability in the effects of ß blockade on exercise tolerance but 
improvement in outcome and symptomatic benefits was noted in many studies. These 
generally positive findings stimulated additional, large-scale clinical trials that have 
provided an impressive body of evidence that supports the use of ß-blockers in patients 
with heart failure caused by [CONTACT_95027]. The recommendations 
that follow are derived from nearly 2 decades of research that include basic science data, 
animal models, and clinical trial experience in over 10,000 patients (25,26). 
 
Although this is a major advance in efficacy, identification of appropriate candidates for 
ßblocker therapy is essential to ensure safe and effective treatment. Prescribing 
physicians should understand the potential risks of ß-blocker therapy, as well as the 
benefits. The interested practitioner who is unfamiliar with ß-blocker initiation and 
titration may first seek further education and counsel from sources such as the Heart 
Failure Society of America or local and regional heart failure specialty centers. 
 
Recommendation 1. ß-blocker therapy should be routinely administered to clinically 
stable patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection 
fraction less than or equal to 40%) and mild to moderate heart failure symptoms (ie, 
NYHA class II-III, Appendix A) who are on standard therapy, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_222865], diuretics as needed to control fluid retention, and digoxin 
(Strength of Evidence = A). 
 
The
 most persuasive outcome in heart failure management remains all-cause mortality. 
Combined endpoints, including mortality or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222866], have also emerged as key outcomes. These latter 
 
CASE [ZIP_CODE] 12/28/[ADDRESS_267937] of ß-blocker therapy on 
these endpoints has been well shown in clinical trials of symptomatic patients (NYHA 
class II - III) treated with carvedilol, bisoprolol, or metoprolol controlled 
release/extended release (CR/XL) (27-29). Trials with these agents encompass the 
combined, worldwide experience with ß-blocker therapy in patients with chronic 
heart failure who were stable on background therapy, including ACE inhibitors (over 
90%) and diuretics (over 90%). Digoxin was common as background therapy, 
particularly in studies conducted in the [LOCATION_002]. Trial results indicate that both 
selective and nonselective ßblockers, with and without ancillary properties, have 
significant efficacy in heart failure. ß-Blocking agents with intrinsic sympathomimetic 
activity appear to have a negative impact on survival and should not be used in heart 
failure patients. 
 
Metoprolol . The MDC Study was an early trial that included 383 patients with heart 
failure caused by [CONTACT_95028], NYHA class II-III symptoms, and a left ventricular 
ejection fraction of less than or equal to 40% (30). Patients with coronary artery disease 
were excluded. Study results showed a 34% reduction in risk in patients treated with 
metoprolol, although this strong trend toward benefit ( P = .058) was entirely attributable 
to a reduction in the frequency of cardiac transplantation listing in the treatment group. In 
fact, the absolute number of deaths in the metoprolol group was higher than in the 
placebo group (23 v 19, P = .69). 
 
The MERIT-HF Trial evaluated the effect of metoprolol CR/XL with all-cause mortality 
a
s the primary endpoint. The trial included 3,991 patients with NYHA class II-IV heart 
failure, although 96% of the study patients were functional class II or III (31). In this 
study, investigators were allowed to select the starting dose of metoprolol CR/XL. 
Seventy-nine percent chose 25 mg as the starting dose for class II patients, and 77% 
chose 12.5 mg for class III-IV patients. The target dose was 200 mg and doses were up-
titrated over a period of 8 weeks. Premature discontinuation of blinded therapy occurred 
in 13.9% of those treated with metoprolol CR/XL and 15.3% of those in the placebo 
group ( P = .90). The study results revealed a 34% reduction in mortality in the 
metoprolol group (relative risk of .66; 95% confidence interval [CI], .53 to .81; p=.0062 
a
fter adjustment for interim analyses), with annual mortality rates of 11% in the placebo 
and 7.2% in the metoprolol CR/XL group (29). 
 
Bisoprolol.  The CIBIS Study evaluated the effects of bisoprolol in 641 patients with left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction caused by [CONTACT_222918]-IV heart failure (32). The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222867]. 
The initial bisoprolol dose was 1.25 mg/day, which was increased to a maximum dose of 
5 mg/day. The trial found no significant reduction in all-cause mortality in patients 
treated with bisoprolol (20% reduction bisoprolol v placebo, P = .22) (32). The risk of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94934] 34% (28% placebo group v 19% bisoprolol 
group, P <  .01). 
 
 
CASE [ZIP_CODE] 12/28/2018  P age 66 of 85 
    The favorable trends seen in CIBIS led to the larger CIBIS II Study, which ultimately 
wa
s prematurely terminated as a result of a significant reduction in mortality in the 
bisoprolol arm (28). These results were obtained in 2,647 patients who were followed for 
an average of 1.3 years. Over 80% of the patients were judged to be NYHA class III at 
enrollment. Background therapy included ACE inhibitors in 96% and diuretic in 99% of 
the study patients, whereas 52% were taking digoxin. In contrast to the original CIBIS 
study, CIBIS II had a similar starting dose of 1.25 mg but had a greater target dose of 10 
mg daily of bisoprolol. More stringent criteria for defining ischemic cardiomyopathy 
were used. Treatment with bisoprolol reduced the annual mortality rate by 34% (13.2% 
placebo v 8.8% bisoprolol; hazard ratio .66; 95% CI, .54 to .81; P< .0001). 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94935] 32% (18% placebo v 
12% bisoprolol, hazard ratio .64; 95% CI, .53 to .79; P< .0001). Although a post hoc 
analysis of the CIBIS Study had suggested benefit might be consigned to patients withou t 
coronary disease, the survival benefit, with significant reductions apparent in both 
ischemic or nonischemic patients, was not influenced by [CONTACT_95030]. 
 
Carvedilol . Carvedilol, a nonselective ß-
 -blocker, has been extensively 
investigated for treatment of heart failure caused by [CONTACT_95027]. 
In the [LOCATION_002] carvedilol trials, [ADDRESS_267938] of carvedilol therapy on 
the clinical progression of heart failure (27). Clinical progression was defined as 
worsening heart failure leading to death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or, in one study, a sustained 
increase in background medications. Patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 
35% or less and NYHA class II-IV were eligible if they tolerated 6.25 mg of carvedilol 
twice per day for a 2-week, open-label, run-in period. Although this run-in phase biased 
the ultimately randomized patient population, less than 8% of eligible patients failed the 
open-label challenge. Target dosages for the studies were 50 to 100 mg/day of carvedilol 
that 
were administered in divided doses twice daily. Patients completing the run-in period 
were randomized based on results from their 6- minute walk test into mild, moderate, or 
severe trials. These studies were prematurely terminated (median follow-up 6.5 months) 
by [CONTACT_95031] 4 
combined trials of patients treated with carvedilol. 
 
Data from these combined trials indicated a substantial benefit from carvedilol treatment. 
The risk of mortality was 65% lower (7.8% placebo v 3.2% carvedilol; 95% CI, 39% to 
80%; P< .001) and the combined risk of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94936] 38% 
(20% on placebo v 14% on carvedilol; 95% CI, 18% to 53%; P< .001). A significant 
mortality reduction was also noted when deaths that occurred in the run-in period were 
include
d in the analysis. The statistical validity of the survival analysis across the trials 
has been questioned because mortality was not the primary endpoint, and only 1 of the 4 
trials achieved a significant result when analyzed based on the primary endpoint. 
Nevertheless, the magnitude of the survival benefit and the reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222868]. The survival benefit was not influenced by [CONTACT_95032], age, 
gender, or baseline ejection fraction. Overall, 7.8% of the placebo group and 5.7% of the 
carvedilol group discontinued study medication. Data from the individual trials, 
PRECISE and MOCHA, which evaluated patients with moderate to severe heart failure, 
found that carvedilol reduced the risk of the combined endpoint of mortality or heart 
failure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88078] 39% to 49% (33,34). The MOCHA Study provided strong 
 
CASE [ZIP_CODE] 12/28/2018  P age 67 of 85 
   e
vidence for increased benefit from higher dosages (25 mg twice per day) versus lower 
dosages (6.25 mg twice per day) of carvedilol, so up titration of carvedilol dosages to 25 
mg twice per day is generally recommended. However, favorable effects were noted at 
6.25 mg twice per day, so intolerance of high doses should not be a reason for 
discontinuation of therapy. 
 
The Australia-New Zealand Carvedilol Trial enrolled 415 patients with ischemic 
cardiomyopathy and a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 45% (35). Although 
patients with NYHA functional classes I-III were eligible, the majority enrolled were 
NYHA functional class I (30%) or II (54%). ACE inhibitors were used in 86% of the 
participants, whereas 76% were on diuretic therapy, and 38% were on digoxin. This trial 
also had a run-in phase during which 6% of the patients discontinued ß-blocker therapy. 
During an average follow-up of 19 months, carvedilol decreased the combined risk of all-
cause mortality or any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88078] 26% (relative risk .74; 95% CI, .57 to .95; P= 
.02). Overall mortality was 12.5% in the placebo group and 9.6% in the carvedilol group 
which was not statistically significant (relative risk .76; 95% CI, .42 to 1.36; P > .10). 
 
Unreported or Ongoing Trials.  Studies that are underway will provide additional data 
concerning specific aspects of the efficacy of ß-blocker therapy in heart failure. The 
effect of bucindolol on mortality and morbidity in patients with moderate to severe heart 
failure has been evaluated in the BEST Study. This study enrolled a substantial number 
of women so the potential influence of gender on the efficacy of ß-blocker therapy can be 
investigated. The trial has been stopped, and no results are available for analysis. 
     
The
 COPERNICUS Trial is designed to assess the effect of carvedilol treatment on 
disease progression and survival in patients with advanced heart failure with symptoms at 
rest or on minimal exertion. The COMET protocol is a 3,000 patient study that directly 
compares the survival benefit of carvedilol versus metoprolol. This trial will provide 
important data concerning the relative efficacy of a selective ß-blocker versus a 
nonselective ß-blocker with ancillary properties. 
 
Re
commendation 2. ß-blocker therapy should be considered for patients with left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal 
to 40%) who are asymptomatic (ie, NYHA class I) and standard therapy, including 
ACE inhibitors (Strength of Evidence = C). 
 
Da
ta from the SOLVD Prevention Trial prospectively illustrated the efficacy of ACE 
inhibitors in delaying the onset of heart failure symptoms and the need for treatment or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94938] a left ventricular ejection 
fraction less than or equal to 35% (36). Similar controlled, clinical trial data that support 
the use of a ß-blocker in this clinical circumstance are not available. However, significant 
support for the use of ßblocker therapy in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular 
dysfunction can be derived from clinical trials in coronary artery disease and 
hypertension. Previous data indicate that ß-blocker therapy should be used in patients 
after myocardial infarction (MI) and in patients with myocardial revascularization who 
have good symptomatic and functional recovery but residual ventricular systolic 
dysfunction. Trials in hypertension indicate that ß-blocker therapy decreases the risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_94939]. Given the potential of ß-blockers to retard disease progression 
 
CASE [ZIP_CODE] 12/28/[ADDRESS_267939] therapy should occur before ß-blocker therapy is instituted. Initiation of 
ß-blocker therapy in patients with heart failure requires a careful baseline 
evaluation of clinical status (Strength of Evidence = B). 
 
I
nitiation of ß-blocker therapy has the potential to worsen heart failure signs and 
s
ymptoms. This risk increases with the underlying severity of the heart failure that is 
present. To minimize the likelihood of worsening failure, a period of treatment with 
standard therapy and evidence of clinical stability without acute decompensation or fluid 
overload is recommended before initiation of ß-blocker therapy. The majority of the 
large-scale, ß-blocker heart failure trials required that chronic heart failure be present 3 
months or more before initiation of ß-blocker therapy. Patients enrolled in these trials 
were typi[INVESTIGATOR_94940] (if tolerated), diuretic, and digoxin for at least 
[ADDRESS_267940] clinicians discourage the initiation of ß-blocker therapy in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222869] (with or without associated inotrope 
administration). Some experienced clinicians initiate ß-blocker therapy in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222870]. 
 
Recommendation 4. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of ß-
blocker therapy for inpatients or outpatients with symptoms of heart failure at rest 
(ie, NYHA class IV) (Strength of Evidence = C). 
 
ß-Blocker therapy cannot be routinely recommended for NYHA class IV patients because 
t
here are currently no clinical trial data to indicate favorable long-term efficacy and 
safety of ßblocker therapy in this patient population. A substantial body of observational 
data indicates that successful institution of ß-blocker therapy in patients with this degree 
of heart failure is problematic. If used, these agents may precipi[INVESTIGATOR_94943], and 
patients so treated should be monitored by a physician who has expertise in heart failure. 
The number of patients with class IV heart failure at the time of ß-blocker initiation in 
controlled clinical trials is small. Available trials, which report data on patients with 
severe heart failure mostly labeled as NYHA class III, show the potential problems of ß-
blocker therapy in this part of the heart failure spectrum. This experience is reflected in a 
14-week study that evaluated the effects of ß-blocker therapy in 56 patients (51 NYHA 
class III and 5 NYHA class IV at randomization) with severe left ventricular dysfunction 
(average left ventricular ejection fraction of 16% ± 1% and left ventricular filling 
pressure of 24 mm Hg ± 1 mm Hg) (37). These patients had significant impairment of 
exercise capacity (mean VO2 max of 13.6 mL/kg/min ± 0.6 mL/kg/min) despi[INVESTIGATOR_94944]-
inhibitor, digoxin and diuretic therapy. Patients were believed to be clinically stable 
(requiring no medication adjustments) for a 2-week period before an open-label challenge 
was conducted. Seven patients (12%) failed to complete the open-label, run-in period, 
 
CASE [ZIP_CODE] 12/28/2018  P age 69 of 85 
   during
 which 5 died and 2 had nonfatal adverse reactions. Clinical parameters did not 
distinguish these patients from those who were able to continue in the trial. Eighteen of 
the 49 patients (37%) completing the run-in period experienced worsened dyspnea or 
fluid retention during this phase. Also, 22% experienced dizziness and required 
medication adjustment, which delayed up-titration during the run-in. Subsequently, an 
additional 12% of the patients randomized to carvedilol withdrew from the blinded arm 
of the study. One of the [LOCATION_002] carvedilol trials studied patients with severe left 
ventricular dysfunction who had markedly reduced exercise capacity as assessed by [CONTACT_941] 
6-minute walk test (38). In this trial, 131 patients with a mean left ventricular ejection 
fr
action of 22% and severe impairment in quality of life underwent a 2-week, open-label 
challenge phase of 6.25 mg of carvedilol twice per day. Ten of these 131 patients (8%) 
were unable to complete this run-in phase, most because of worsening heart failure, 
dyspnea, or dizziness. Subsequently, 11% of the patients randomized to carvedilol 
withdrew, as did a similar number of patients (11%) in the placebo group. In the recently 
completed large-scale BEST Trial, the mortality trend in NYHA class III-IV patients 
favored the ß-blocker bucindolol, but the difference from placebo was not significant. 
Further analysis of these preliminary findings is necessary, but the data suggest that the 
striking benefit of ß-blockers in mild- to-moderate heart failure may not be extrapolated to 
those with severe symptoms. 
 
Recommendation 5. ß-Blocker therapy should be initiated at low doses and up-
titrated slowly, generally no sooner than at 2-week intervals. Clinical reevaluation 
should occur at each titration point and with worsening of patient symptoms . 
Patients who develop worsening heart failure or other side effects after drug 
initiation or during titration require adjustment of concomitant medications. These 
patients may also require a reduction in ß-blocker dose and, in some cases, 
temporary or permanent withdrawal of this therapy (Strength of Evidence = B). 
 
 ß-Blocker therapy should be initiated at doses substantially less than target doses. 
C
linical trials required patient reassessment at up-titration of each dose. This careful 
evaluation by [CONTACT_95033]/or heart failure specialists likely contributed to the 
relatively low withdrawal rates and safety profiles observed in the clinical trials. 
Treatment for symptomatic deterioration may be required during ß-blocker titration, but 
with appropriate adjustments in therapy, most patients can be maintained and generally 
a
chieve target doses. There is a risk of worsening heart failure, and vasodilatory side 
effects may occur with certain agents. Worsening heart failure is typi[INVESTIGATOR_222871], lower exercise tolerance, and weight gain. Increased diuretic doses 
may be required for signs and symptoms of worsened fluid retention. Treatment options 
also include temporary down-titration of the ß-blocker to the last tolerated dose. Abrupt 
withdrawal should be avoided. A minimum period of stability of 2 weeks should occur 
before further up-titration is attempted. Hypotensive side effects may often resolve with 
reduction in diuretic dose. Temporary reductions in ACE inhibitor dose may be helpful 
for symptomatic hypotension not obviated by [CONTACT_222919]. Administration of carvedilol with food may alleviate vasodilatory side 
effects as well.

   I
f ß-blocker treatment is interrupted for a period exceeding 72 hours and the patient is 
still judged a candidate for this therapy, drug treatment should be reinitiated at 50% of the 
previous dose. Subsequent up-titration should be conducted as previously described. 
 
Recommendation 6. In general, patients who experience a deterioration in clinical 
status or symptomatic exacerbation of heart failure during chronic maintenance 
treatment should be continued on ß-blocker therapy (Strength of Evidence = C). 
 
Clinical decompensation that occurs during stable maintenance therapy is less likely 
caused by [CONTACT_40328] ß-blocker therapy than other factors (diet or medication 
noncompliance, ischemia, arrhythmia, comorbid disease, infection, or disease 
progression). In these situations, maintaining the current ß-blocker dose while relieving 
or compensating for the precipi[INVESTIGATOR_94946](s) is most often the best course. Data from 
patients randomized to continue or discontinue ß-blocker therapy in this setting are not 
currently available. However, studies of the withdrawal of ß-blocker therapy in patients 
with persistent left ventricular systolic dysfunction but improved and stable clinical heart 
failure have revealed a substantial risk of worsening heart failure and early death after 
discontinuation of ß-blocker therapy (39,40). 
 
Recommendat ion 7. Patient education regarding early recognition of symptom 
exacerbation and side effects is considered important. If clinical uncertainty exists, 
consultation with clinicians who have expertise in heart failure and/or specialized 
programs with experience in ß-blocker use in patients with heart failure is 
recommended (Strength of Evidence = B). 
 
In certain patients, frequent return visits for dose-titration may be difficult to 
accommodate in a busy clinical practice. Trained personnel, including nurse practitioners, 
physicians’ assistants, and pharmacists with physician supervision, may more efficiently 
perform patient education and reevaluation during up-titration. Heart failure specialty 
programs are more likely to have the resources to provide this follow-up and education 
(41). Consultation or referral may be particularly beneficial when the clinical heart failure 
status of the patient is uncertain or problems arise during initiation of therapy or dose-
titration that may cause unwarranted discontinuation of therapy. Ideal patients for ß-
blocker therapy should be compliant and have a good understanding of their disease and 
their overall treatment plan. Patients should be aware that symptomatic deterioration is 
possible early in therapy and that symptomatic improvement may be delayed for weeks to 
months. 
 
Unresolved Therapeutic Issues 
 
Combining ß-Blocking Agents With Amiodarone Therapy.  Concomitant use of 
amiodarone was generally precluded in the trials evaluating carvedilol and most other ß-
blockers. However, the use of this agent for rate control of atrial arrhythmia or for 
maintenance of sinus rhythm is common in heart failure patients. Drug interactions 
between ß-blockers and amiodarone are possible, including symptomatic bradycardia, 
and may limit the maximum tolerated dose of the ß-blocker. When the combination is 
used, the smallest effective dose of amiodarone should be employed. Given the lack of a

indefinite. 
 
Digoxin 
Background for Recommendations 
Although little controversy exists as to the benefit of digoxin in patients with 
symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction and concomitant atrial fibrillation, the 
debate continues over its current role in similar patients with normal sinus rhythm. 
Recent information regarding digoxin’s mechanism of action and new analyses of clinical 
data from the DIG Trial and the combined PROVED and RADIANCE Trial databases 
provide additional evidence of favorable efficacy that was unavailable to previous 
guideline committees (42-47). In fact, this information has recently formed the basis of 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of digoxin for the treatment of mild to 
moderate heart failure (48). Digoxin, a drug that is inexpensive and can be given once 
daily, represents the only orally effective drug with positive inotropic effects approved 
for the management of heart failure. The committee’s consensus is that digoxin, when 
used in combination with other standard therapy, will continue to play an important role 
in the symptomatic management of the majority of patients with heart failure. 
 
The efficacy of digoxin for the treatment of heart failure caused by [CONTACT_222920]-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) that results in an 
increase in cardiac myocyte intracellular calcium. However, in addition to positive 
inotropy, digitalis has important, neurohormonal-modulating effects in patients with 
chronic heart failure, including a sympathoinhibitory effect that cannot be ascribed to its 
inotropic action (49,50). Digoxin also ameliorates autonomic dysfunction as evidenced 
by [CONTACT_95036], which indicates increased parasympathetic and 
baroreceptor sensitivity during therapy (51). 
 
Recommendation 1. Digoxin should be considered for patients who have symptoms 
of heart failure (NYHA class II-III, Strength of Evidence = A and NYHA class IV, 
Strength of Evidence = C) caused by [CONTACT_222921]. 
 
 
CASE [ZIP_CODE] 12/28/[ADDRESS_267942] on the primary study endpoint and 
mortality from any cause during an average follow-up of approximately 3 years (42). In 
the main trial, 6,800 patients with left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 
45% were randomized to digoxin or placebo, in addition to diuretics and ACE inhibitors. 
A total of 1,181 deaths occurred on digoxin (34.8%) and 1,194 on placebo (35.1%) for a 
risk ratio of .99 (95% CI, .91 to 1.07; P = .80). These results differ from other oral agents 
with inotropic properties that have been associated with an adverse effect on mortality. In 
addition, the need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222872] (defined as increasing the dose 
of diuretics and ACE inhibitors or adding new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_94949]) was 
significantly lower in the digoxin group, even in those patients who were not previously 
taking digoxin. Fewer patients on digoxin compared with placebo were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222873] (26.8% v 34.7%; risk ratio .72; 95% CI, .66 to .79; P < .001). 
These long-term data are consistent with recent results obtained from an analysis of the 
combined PROVED and RADIANCE databases (45). In this analysis, patients who 
continued digoxin as part of triple therapy with diuretics and an ACE inhibitor were 
much less likely to develop worsening heart failure (4.7%) than those treated with a 
diuretic alone (39%, P < .001), diuretic plus digoxin (19%, P = .009) or diuretic plus an 
ACE inhibitor (25%, P = .001). 
 
Although there are no clinical trial data (level A evidence) for the efficacy of digoxin in 
patients with NYHA Class IV heart failure, there is evidence that digoxin works across 
the spectrum of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. A prespecified subgroup analysis of 
patients enrolled in the DIG Trial with evidence of severe heart failure (as manifested by 
[CONTACT_95038] 25%, or cardiothoracic ratio [CTR] greater than 
.55) showed the benefit of digoxin (48). The following reductions in the combined 
endpoint of all-cause mortality or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222874]: 16% reduction (95% CI, 7% to 24%) in patients with a left ventricular ejection 
fraction of less than 25%, and a 15% reduction (95% CI, 6% to 23%) in patients with a 
CTR of greater than .55 (43). Reductions in the risk of the combined endpoint of heart-
failure related mortality or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94951]: 39% (95% CI, 29% 
to 47%) for patients with left ventricular ejection fraction less than 25%, and 35% (95% 
CI, 25% to 43%) for patients with a CTR greater than .55 (48).  
 
Evidence for the efficacy of digoxin in patients with mild symptoms of heart failure has 
been provided by a recent retrospective, cohort analysis of the combined PROVED and 
RADIANCE data (52). The outcome of patients in these trials who were randomized to 
digoxin withdrawal or continuation was categorized by [CONTACT_2329] a prospectively obtained 
heart failure score based on clinical signs and symptoms. Patients in the mild heart failure 
group (heart failure score of 2 or less) who were randomized to have digoxin withdrawn 
were at increased risk of treatment failure and had deterioration of exercise capacity and 
left ventricular ejection fraction compared with patients who continued digoxin (all P < 
 
CASE [ZIP_CODE] 12/28/2018  P age 73 of 85 
   .01). 
Patients in the moderate heart failure  group who had digoxin withdrawn were 
significantly more likely to experience treatment failure than either patients in the mild 
heart failure group or patients who continued digoxin (both P < .05). These data suggest 
that patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction benefit from digoxin despi[INVESTIGATOR_222875]. 
 
In summary, a large body of evidence supports the efficacy of digoxin in patients with 
symptomatic heart failure caused by [CONTACT_95027]. Digoxin has 
been shown to decrease hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], as well as emergency room visits; decrease the 
need for co intervention; and improve exercise capacity (42-44,53,54). Taken as a whole, 
these clinical trial data provide support for digoxin’s beneficial effect on morbidity and 
neutral effect on mortality (42). 
 
Recommendation 2. In the majority of patients, the dosage of digoxin should be .125 
mg to .25 mg daily (Strength of Evidence = C). 
 
Recent data suggest that the target dose of digoxin therapy should be lower than 
traditionally assumed. Although higher doses may be necessary for maximal 
hemodynamic effects (55), beneficial neurohormonal and functional effects appear to be 
achieved at relatively low serum digoxin concentrations (SDC) typi[INVESTIGATOR_222876] .125 mg to .25 mg of digoxin (55-57). The utility of lower SDC is 
supported by [CONTACT_95039]; the mean SDC achieved in the RADIANCE Trial 
was 1.2 ng/mL and in the DIG Trial was 0.8 ng/mL (42,44). Recent retrospective, cohort 
analysis of the combined PROVED and RADIANCE databases indicates that patients 
with a low SDC (less than .9 ng/mL) were no more likely to experience worsening 
symptoms of heart failure on maintenance digoxin than those with a moderate (.9 to 1.2 
ng/mL) or high (greater than 1.2 ng/mL) SDC (41). All SDC groups were significantly 
less likely to deteriorate during follow-up compared with patients withdrawn from 
digoxin.  
 
Therefore, patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and normal sinus rhythm 
should be started on a maintenance dosage of digoxin (no loading dose) of .125 or .25 mg 
once daily based on ideal body weight, age, and renal function For patients with normal 
renal function, a dosage of digoxin of .25 mg/day will be typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]. Many patients with 
heart failure have reduced renal function and should begin on .125 mg daily. In addition, 
patients with a baseline conduction abnormality, or who are small in stature or elderly, 
should be started at .125 mg/day, which can be up-titrated if necessary. Once dosing has 
continued for a sufficient period for serum concentration to reach steady state (typi[INVESTIGATOR_222877] 2 to 3 weeks), some clinicians consider the measurement of a SDC, especially in 
elderly patients or those with impaired renal function in which the digoxin dose is often 
not predictive of SDC. SDC measurements may be considered when 1) a significant 
change in renal function occurs; 2) a potentially interacting drug (amiodarone, quinidine, 
or verapamil) is added or discontinued; or 3) confirmation of suspected digoxin toxicity 
is necessary in a patient with signs or symptoms and/or electrocardiographic changes 
consistent with this diagnosis. Samples for trough SDC should be drawn more than 6 
hours after dosing. Otherwise, the result is difficult to interpret because the drug may not 
be fully distributed into tissues. 
 
 
CASE [ZIP_CODE] 12/28/2018  P age 74 of 85 
   Re
commendation 3. In patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation with a rapid 
ventricular response, the administration of high doses ofdigoxin (greater than .25 
mg) for the purpose of rate control is not recommended. When necessary, additional 
rate control should be achieved by [CONTACT_1121] ß-blocker therapy or amiodarone 
(Strength of Evidence= C). 
 
Digoxin continues to be the drug of choice for patients with heart failure and atrial 
fibrillation. However, the traditional practice of arbitrarily increasing the dose (and SDC) 
of digoxin until ventricular response is controlled should be abandoned because the risk 
of digoxin toxicity increases as well. Digoxin alone is often inadequate to control 
ventricular response in patients with atrial fibrillation, and the SDC should not be used to 
guide dosing to achieve rate control. Therefore, digoxin should be dosed in the same 
manner as in a patient with heart failure and normal sinus rhythm. 
Digoxin slows ventricular response to atrial fibrillation through enhancement of vagal 
tone. However, with exertion or other increases in sympathetic activity, vagal tone may 
decrease and ventricular rate accelerate. Addition of a ß-blocker or amiodarone 1) 
complements the pharmacological action of digoxin and provides more optimal rate 
control; 2) allows the beneficial clinical effects of digoxin to be maintained; and 3) limits 
the risk of toxicity that may occur if digoxin is dosed to achieve a high SDC (58). For 
patients who have a contraindication to ßblockers, amiodarone is a reasonable alternative. 
If amiodarone is added, the dose of digoxin should be reduced, and the SDC should be 
monitored so that the serum concentration can be maintained in the desired range. Some 
clinicians advocate the short-term, intravenous administration of diltiazem for the acute 
treatment of patients with very rapid ventricular response, especially those with 
hemodynamic compromise. This drug is not indicated for long-term management because 
its negative inotropic effects may worsen heart failure.  
 
Unresolved Therapeutic Issues 
 
Combination With ß-blockers.  ß-Blocker therapy has become pi[INVESTIGATOR_222878]. However, the majority of patients enrolled in controlled 
clinical trials that study the efficacy of digoxin were not taking ß-blockers. Therefore, it 
is uncertain whether or not digoxin should be routinely included as part of a ß-blocker 
regimen for symptomatic heart failure caused by [CONTACT_95027]. 
There are attractive features of combining digoxin with ß-blocker therapy in the treatment 
of 
heart failure. The majority of heart failure patients have coronary artery disease and 
may be at risk for transient epi[INVESTIGATOR_222879]. Combining digoxin with a ß-blocker 
may preserve the beneficial effects of digoxin on the symptoms of heart failure while 
minimizing the potential detrimental effects of this therapy on catecholamine release in 
the setting of ischemia (47). 
 
Combination with Diuretics . Non-potassium- sparing diuretics can produce electrolyte 
abnormalities such as hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, which increases the risk of 
digoxin toxicity. The combination of digoxin with a potassium- sparing diuretic would be 
a potentially safer alternative. Further study will be necessary to carefully elucidate the 
efficacy and safety of combining digoxin with these agents.

   Anticoa
gulation and Antiplatelet Drugs 
Background for Recommendations 
 
Patients with heart failure are recognized to be at increased risk for thromboembolic 
events that can be arterial or venous in origin. In addition to atrial fibrillation and poor 
ventricular function (which promote stasis and increase the risk of thrombus formation), 
patients with heart failure have other manifestations of hypercoagulability. Evidence of 
heightened platelet activation; increased plasma and blood viscosity; and increased 
plasma levels of fibrinopeptide A, ßthromboglobulin, D-dimer, and von Willebrand 
factor (59-61) have been found in many patients. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a predisposition, estimates 
regarding the incidence of thromboemboli in patients with heart failure vary substantially 
between 1.4 and 42 per 100 patient years (62-65). Although variability in the reported 
incidence likely results from differences in the populations studied and the methods used 
to identify these events, the consensus is that pulmonary and systemic emboli are not 
common in heart failure patients. Traditionally, the issue of anticoagulation in patients 
with heart failure centered on warfarin. Growing recognition of the importance of 
ischemic heart disease as a cause of heart failure suggests that the role of antiplatelet 
therapy must be considered in patients with this syndrome as well. 
 
Previous guidelines have recommended warfarin anticoagulation in patients with heart 
failure complicated by [CONTACT_222922] (18,19). Warfarin anticoagulation specifically was not 
recommended in patients with heart failure in the absence of these indications. There 
have been no randomized, controlled trials of warfarin in patients with heart failure. 
Therefore, recommendations regarding its use, in the absence of atrial fibrillation or 
clinically overt systemic or pulmonary thromboemboli, must be made on the basis of 
cohort data and expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. The likely incidence of thromboembolic events and the 
possibility of averting them with warfarin are important considerations for any guideline 
recommendation. In addition, the potential beneficial effects of warfarin on coronary 
thrombotic events, independent of embolic phenomenon, must be taken into account. The 
substantial clinical trial data that reflect the beneficial effects of antiplatelet therapy in 
patients with ischemic heart disease suggest that new guideline recommendations for 
heart failure should address the role of this form of therapy in patients with left 
ventricular dysfunction. 
 
Anticoagulation 
 
Recommendation 1. All patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation should be 
treated with warfarin (goal, international normalized ratio (INR) 2.0 to 3.0) unless 
contraindicated (Strength of Evidence = A). 
 
The committee agrees with previous guideline recommendations that concern warfarin 
therapy in patients with heart failure complicated by [CONTACT_95041]. The benefit of 
warfarin anticoagulation in this setting is well established through several randomized 
trials (66). Patients with heart failure commonly have atrial fibrillation. Warfarin 
anticoagulation should be implemented in all of these patients unless clear 
contraindications exist. 
 
 
CASE [ZIP_CODE] 12/28/2018  P age 76 of 85 
   Re
commendation 2. Warfarin anticoagulation merits consideration for patients with 
lef
t ventricular ejection fraction of 35% or less. Careful assessment of the risks and 
benefits of anticoagulation should be undertaken in individual patients (Strength of 
Evidence = B). 
 
Cohort analyses examining the relationship between warfarin use and noncoronary 
thromboembolism in patients with heart failure have not consistently yielded positive 
findings (62,63,65,67-69). It is possible that the lack of consistent benefit was related to 
the low incidence of identifiable embolic events in these populations. However, these 
studies do not make a convincing argument for the use of warfarin to prevent embolic 
events in the absence of atrial fibrillation or a previous thromboembolic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
 
In contrast, a recent cohort analysis of the SOLVD population focused on the relation 
between warfarin use and the risk of all-cause mortality rather than risk for embolic 
events (70). After adjustment for baseline differences, patients treated with warfarin at 
baseline had a significantly lower risk of mortality during follow-up (adjusted hazard 
ratio .76; 95% CI, .65 to .89, P = .0006). In addition to a mortality benefit, warfarin use 
was also associated with a significant reduction in the combined endpoint of death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19934] (adjusted hazard ratio .82; 95% CI, .72 to .93, P = .002). 
In the SOLVD population, the benefit associated with warfarin use was not significantl y 
influenced by 1) presence or absence of symptoms (treatment trial v prevention trial), 2) 
randomization to enalapril or placebo, 3) gender, 4) presence or absence of atrial 
fibrillation; 5) age, 6) ejection fraction, 7) NYHA class, or 8) origins of disease. 
  
The
 benefit associated with warfarin use in the cohort analysis of the SOLVD population 
was related to a reduction in cardiac mortality. Specifically, there was a significant 
reduction among warfarin users in deaths that were identified as sudden, in deaths 
associated with heart failure, and in fatal MI. In contrast (yet in agreement with previous 
cohort analyses), there was no significant difference in deaths considered cardiovascular 
but noncardiac, including pulmonary embolism and fatal stroke. Some caution is needed 
in consideration of this finding because the number of cardiovascular deaths that were 
noncardiac was far less than the number of cardiac deaths. 
 
Reduction in ischemic events is one potential explanation for the apparent benefit from 
warfarin in the SOLVD Study. Warfarin users showed a reduced rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222880]. Prior investigations of patients after acute MI showed 
that warfarin anticoagulation, when started within 4 weeks, reduces the incidence of fatal 
and nonfatal coronary events, as well as pulmonary embolus and stroke (71). 
 
As with other post hoc, cohort analyses, it is possible that the findings from the SOLVD 
Study may result from differences between the treatment groups that were not identified 
and for which statistical correction could not adequately adjust. For this reason, evidence 
from any cohort study must be considered less powerful compared with evidence derived 
from randomized, controlled trials. Nevertheless, in the absence of randomized data, the 
SOLVD cohort analysis represents reasonable evidence to support more aggressive use of 
warfarin anticoagulation than previously recommended in patients with reduced left 
ventricular ejection fraction and sinus rhythm. The data from this analysis provide no 
information regarding the ideal warfarin dose in this patient population. Therefore, the 
 
CASE [ZIP_CODE] 12/28/2018  P age 77 of 85 
   dosi
ng recommendation should likely conform to that derived from previous randomized 
trials performed in patients without mechanical prosthetic  valves (INR 2.0 to 3.0). 
 
Antiplatelet Drugs 
 
Recommendation 1. With regard to the concomitant use of ACE inhibitors and 
acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), each medication should be considered on its own merit 
for individual patients. Currently, there is insufficient evidence concerning the 
potential negative therapeutic interaction between ASA and ACE inhibitors to 
warrant withholding either of these medications in which an indication exists 
(Strength of Evidence =C). 
 
Strong evidence supports the clinical benefit of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_222881] (72-75). However, recent post hoc analyses of large randomized trials 
involving ACE inhibitors in heart failure and post-MI suggest the possibility of an 
adverse drug interaction between ASA and ACE inhibitors (76-78). A retrospective 
c
ohort analysis of the SOLVD Study found that patients on antiplatelet therapy (assumed 
to be ASA in the great majority of patients) derived no additional survival benefit from 
the addition of enalapril. Data from CONSENSUS II and GUSTO-[ADDRESS_267943], an unadjusted, 
retrospective registry study in patients with chronic coronary artery disease did not 
support an adverse interaction (79). Interestingly, in an adjusted analysis of the subset of  
patients with heart failure in this study, the beneficial effects of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_222882]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_94959], no 
prospective studies have yet been reported that concern the possible adverse interaction 
between ACE inhibitors and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]. To date, there is no clear evidence of harm from the 
combination of ASA and ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure (76). 
 
The
re is also some evidence that the potential interaction between ASA and ACE 
inhibitors may be dose related. A recent meta-analysis of all hypertension and heart 
failure patients who have received both ASA and ACE inhibitors suggests that ASA at 
doses equal to or less than 100 mg showed no interaction with ACE inhibitors (80). Any 
interaction, if observed, occurred at higher doses of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]. 
 
A potential mechanism for the hypothesized adverse interaction between ASA and ACE 
inhibitors in patients with heart failure involves prostaglandin synthesis. ACE inhibition 
is believed to augment bradykinin which, in turn, stimulates the synthesis of various 
prostaglandins that may contribute vasodilatory and other salutary effects. In the presence 
of ASA, the bradykinin-induced increase in prostaglandins should be attenuated or 
blocked, which potentially reduces the benefits of ACE inhibition. Invasive 
hemodynamic monitoring has shown that the acute hemodynamic effect of enalapril is 
blunted by [CONTACT_95042][INVESTIGATOR_248] (81). Another possibility is that ASA 
and ACE inhibitors act in a similar fashion in heart failure, therefore no added benefit is 
gained from the combination. ACE inhibitors appear to reduce ischemic events in heart

neficial action on ventricular remodeling support the hypothesis of similar mechanisms 
of action for ACE inhibitors and ASA (82). 
 
Development of the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) antagonists, ticlopi[INVESTIGATOR_222883], provides alternative therapy for platelet inhibition that does not appear to 
influence prostaglandin synthesis (83). In direct comparison with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], large-scale 
clinical trial results have established the efficacy of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_222884] (84). Clinical data are limited 
with ADP antagonists in heart failure. However, hemodynamic evaluation found a similar 
reduction in systemic vascular resistance in heart failure patients treated with the 
combination of ACE inhibitors and ticlopi[INVESTIGATOR_94962], which 
suggests no adverse hemodynamic interaction with ACE inhibition with this type of 
antiplatelet compound (85). Definitive resolution of the therapeutic implications of the 
ASA/ACE inhibitor interaction and the appropriate alternative therapy, if any, in heart 
failure awaits the results of additional clinical research studies.

iotensin II Receptor Blockers 
 
Background for Recommendations 
 
Angiotensin ll (AT) receptor blockers (ARBs) differ in their mechanism of action 
compared with ACE inhibitors. Rather than inhibiting the production of AT by [CONTACT_222923], ARBs block the cell surface receptor for AT. ARBs that are currently available 
are selective and only effectively inhibit the AT1 subtype of this receptor. Theoretical 
benefits of ARBs include receptor blockade of AT produced by [CONTACT_222924]2 receptors. 
AT1 receptor antagonism is important because this receptor appears to mediate the 
classical adverse effects associated with AT in heart failure. In contrast, the AT2 receptor 
subtype appears to counterbalance AT1 receptor stimulation by [CONTACT_222925] (86). Thus, the selective receptor 
blockade of the current ARBs may be particularly advantageous. Theoretical concerns 
about ARB therapy include the potential deleterious effects of increased AT levels and 
AT2 receptor-mediated enhancement of apoptosis. Whether ARBs have beneficial effects 
similar to ACE inhibitors on the course of coronary artery disease remains to be 
determined. ARBs may or may not influence bradykinin concentrations, which are 
anticipated to rise with ACE inhibitor therapy and may contribute to their efficacy. 
 
The hemodynamic actions of ARBs have, thus far, been similar to ACE inhibitors for 
reduction of blood pressure in hypertension and lowering of systemic vascular resistance 
in heart failure (87). ARBs have a similar mild- to-modest effect on exercise capacity and 
produce a comparable reduction in norepi[INVESTIGATOR_94963] (88). 
 
Recommendation 1. ACE inhibitors rather than ARBs continue to be the agents of 
choice for blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in heart failure, and they 
remain the cornerstone of standard therapy for patients with left ventricular 
systolic dysfunction with or without symptomatic heart failure (Strength of 
Evidence = A). 
 
 
CASE [ZIP_CODE] 12/28/[ADDRESS_267944] where ARBs will ultimately reside among 
accepted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_94964]. Although the initial small ELITE Trial suggested a 
greater benefit from a losartan dosage of 50 mg daily than from a captopril dosage of 50 
mg 3 times daily on mortality in elderly patients with heart failure (89), the ELITE II 
Mortality Trial, which included more than 3,000 patients (90), showed no comparative 
benefit from losartan and a trend for a better outcome and fewer sudden deaths with 
captopril (91). This result provides no evidence that the low dose (50 mg ) of losartan that 
was tested is better than an ACE inhibitor for treating heart failure, but it does not 
exclude the efficacy of a higher dose designed to provide continuous inhibition of the 
AT1 receptor. Tolerability of losartan was better than of captopril, primarily because of 
an ACEinhibitor cough. But the well-established efficacy of the ACE inhibitors on 
outcome in the post-MI period, in diabetes, in atherosclerosis, and in heart failure 
mandates that this drug group remains agents of choice for inhibiting the renin-
angiotensin system in heart failure. The RESOLVD Trial suggested no major differences 
in efficacy of candesartan and enalapril, with a trend favoring enalapril during the study 
period of 43 weeks (92). The OPTIMAAL and VALIANT Studies will provide 
information specifically about the role of ARBs versus ACE inhibitors in the post-MI 
population. 
 
Currently, ACE inhibitors continue to be regarded as the therapy of choice to inhibit the 
renin-angiotensin system in patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic left ventricular 
dysfunction. There is no current rationale to recommend initiating ARBs in patients with 
new onset heart failure or for switching from a tolerated ACE-inhibitor regimen to an 
ARB in patients with chronic heart failure. 
 
Recommendation 2. All efforts should be made to achieve ACE inhibitor use in 
patients with heart failure caused by [CONTACT_95046]. Patients who are 
truly intolerant to ACE inhibitors should be considered for treatment with the 
combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate (Hyd-ISDN) (Strength of 
Evidence = B) or an ARB (Strength of Evidence = C).  
 
P
revious large-scale trials do not specifically address the role of ARB and Hyd-ISDN in 
patients who are intolerant to ACE inhibitors. One arm of the CHARM Study has been 
specifically designed to test the effectiveness of candesartan in patients with systolic 
dysfunction who are intolerant to ACE inhibitors. The primary endpoint in this study will 
be a composite of cardiovascular death and time until first hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222885]. For now, ARBs offer a reasonable alternative in the heart failure or post-MI 
patient who is truly intolerant to ACE inhibition. Intolerance because of cough should 
always trigger a careful reevaluation for congestion. If congestion is present, cough 
should abate with increases in diuretic that should allow ACE-inhibitor use to continue 
(93). It should be emphasized that patients intolerant to ACE inhibitor because of renal 
dysfunction, hyperkalemia, or hypotension are often intolerant to ARBs as well. ACE 
inhibitor intolerance because of persistent symptomatic hypotension in advanced heart 
failure may represent severe dependence on the hemodynamic support of the renin-
angiotensin system, which generally would predict hypotension with ARB use as well. 
 
The combination of Hyd-ISDN  has not been studied in the post-MI population, but 
sufficient experience exists to support its use in the ACE-inhibitor-intolerant patient with 
 
CASE [ZIP_CODE] 12/28/[ADDRESS_267945] that the combination yields more vasodilation and decreased blood 
pressure than either agent alone. The addition of losartan to an ACE inhibitor has been 
found to improve exercise capacity compared with an ACE inhibitor alone (94). 
Preliminary data from the RESOLVD Trial suggest that ventricular dilation and 
neuroendocrine activation may be best reduced with combination therapy, but other 
endpoints were not clearly affected. Trials are currently underway to determine the 
safety, as well as benefit, of more complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. 
The Val-HeFT Trial is a large-scale investigation of the effect of valsartan in addition to 
ACE inhibitors on morbidity and mortality in symptomatic patients with heart failure 
caused by [CONTACT_95047]. One arm of the CHARM Study will also examine the 
effect of the addition of candesartan in patients with symptomatic, systolic dysfunction 
treated with an ACE inhibitor. Preliminary data from the RESOLVD Trial suggest that 
combination therapy may be even more efficacious when used in conjunction with ß-
blocker treatment. Results from Val-HeFT and CHARM in the subset of patients treated 
with ß-blocker therapy will provide more information concerning this strategy. 
 
Combination therapy represents a rational option when treating severe hypertension or 
other vasoconstriction but cannot, at present, be recommended as routine therapy in the 
absence of a proven superiority to ACE-inhibitor therapy alone.

IL-6, TNFalpha, Troponin and BNP Analytical Method 
Serum levels of IL-6 and TNFalpha are determined using commercially available multi-
plex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Meso-Scale Discovery, 
Gaithersburg, MD). All samples are run in duplicate with appropriate controls. Analytes 
are detected and quantitated using a MesoScale Discovery electrochemiluminesence 
instrument model Sector 2400 Imager. Troponin analyses are run on an automated 
analyzer using immunoassay technique (StreamLab system, Siemens, [LOCATION_003]). The BNP is 
determined using a chemiluminesce automated analyzer (Centaur analyzer, Siemans, 
[LOCATION_003]).

Automated Symptom Tracking  for Measurement -Based Care of Depression

Background & Significance  
Perinatal depression is one of the most common medical complications during pregnancy and 
the postpartum period.1 The prevalence of women that experienc e antenatal and postpartum 
depression  are 12% and 10-15% accordingly .[ADDRESS_839829] of not treating a mother with depression is $7,[ADDRESS_839830] of untreated 
depression in mothers $5.[ADDRESS_839831] , yet barely half of Americans, and only 40% of African Americans, 
with major depressive  disorder  (MDD ) receive treatment.5,6 Factors contributing to low treatment 
rates are manifold but are known to be rooted in a national shortage of mental health 
practitioners that is projected to worsen over the next decade.7,8 In the face of this shortage, 
primary care providers, who exclusively manage 73% of all cases of MDD, have become the de 
facto  mental health providers for much of society.9,[ADDRESS_839832] do not receive guideline -concordant, that is, measurement -based care (MBC).  
 
Measurement -based care is the key – but it is difficult to deliver   
MBC, which involves the use of quantitative assessments for depression screening, diagnos is, 
and symptom monitoring,11 is recognized as the key to depression management.12–14 MBC can 
be thought of as an iterative “treat to target” strategy where a diagnosis is made, treatment is 
initiated, s ymptoms are measured over time, and treatments are modified to optimize symptom 
burden. It is highly effective and is associated with a much lower relapse rate (25%) as 
compared with usual care (75%).15  
 
Providers struggle to deliver guideline -concordant depression care as only 22% of patients who 
receive care receive what would be considered adequate treatment.5,6 This rate drops to 14% in 
African Americans -- highlighting a disparity in MDD treatment effectiveness.6 Barriers to 
providing MBC inclu de the additional resources needed for administration, collection, scoring, 
and recording of patient assessment instruments with some successful models of MBC, often 
utilizing a dedicated care manager to coordinate and communicate patient results.10 Lacking the 
access to MBC, many patients with MDD receive a single prescri ption for a low -dose 
antidepressant medication and little follow -up or adjuvant talk therapy.5,6 It is reasonable to 
hypothesize that low rates of MBC adoption are responsible for low rates o f adequate MDD 
care. New approaches are needed to address the gap in depression care.  
 
What is a chatbot?  
The general definition of a  chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation 
with human users, especially over the Internet. Chatbots  vary in design and function.  We 
propose the development and validation of a chatbot mediated approach for implementing MBC 
that we call CB -MBC.  CB-MBC is designed to orient the subject to the study and methods of 
interacting w ith the chatbot.  Users will respond to the chatbot using reply buttons (not free text) 
and will have a persistent menu at the bottom of their screen to be used with questions or when 
further assistance is needed.

Version: 11MAY2019  Rationale for using Facebook Messenger app  
Facebook Messenger was sele cted as the method of administration for this study as it is 
extensively used by [CONTACT_629686]. The 
most popular form of messaging within the U.S. and Canada is overwhelmingly Facebook 
Messenger.[ADDRESS_839833] usage ages being 
25-34).17  This is the ideal age range for participants in our study population.  In 2016 it was 
reported that Facebook users in the U.S. spent approximately 50 minutes a day on the website, 
an increase from 40 minutes the previous year.18 There are several other messaging apps with 
end-to-end encryption includin g Signal, VIBER, Telegram and WhatsApp. However, we are 
restricted to using a platform that supports chatbots thereby [CONTACT_629687].  
Telegram and VIBER are bot friendly but far more popular in Eastern Europe, Iran & 
Uzbekistan, than the U.S.  
 
Rationale for Studying Perinatal Population   
The CB -MBC chatbot is essentially, a depression symptom tracker delivered via a smartphone 
application called Facebook Messenger. In order to maximize the treatment exposure of this 
intervention, it is im portant to apply it within a population that is likely to own a smartphone and 
use Facebook Messenger in their daily lives. Data from the Pew Research Center suggests that 
smartphone ownership and social networking application use is highest among people a ges [ADDRESS_839834] been previously studied in a variety of patient populations with serious mental illness.24–28 
One fully -remote trial of 626 adults with mild to moderate depression demonstrated differential 
treatment improvements for patients using an app designed to deliver cognitive behavioral 
therapy.29 Another group recently reported substantial improvement in symptoms through the 
use of interactive apps for treating depression and anxiety.30 Another study compared the 
efficacy of using either a mobile phone - or computer -based platform for delivering cognitive 
behavioral therapy. A Facebook Messenger chatbot, similar to the proposed CB -MBC platform, 
has also been recently studied in students who self -identify as having depression .31 None of 
these studies reported any safety concerns.  
 
 Page 3 of 19 IRB16 -1802  
Version: 11MAY2019  The safety and feasibility of using digital health apps have also be en previously studied in 
vulnerable pregnant females . In one observational trial of a smartphone app for tracking 
gestational hypertension and weight gain patients exhibited high patient engagement with the 
platform and reported high satisfaction with the experience.32 Another randomized control trial in 
a vulnerable population of pregnant women wi th depressive symptomatology at < [ADDRESS_839835] -effectiveness of digital 
mental health interventions, we conclude that a symptom tracking intervention, such as CB -
MBC, poses an acceptably low risk of physical harm to pregnant and non -pregnant patients with 
depression.  
 
The proposed trial will bridge a significant “effectiveness” gap in depression treatment   
We will test the use of automated symptom tracking using a “chatbot” for delivering MBC via the 
Facebook Messenger platform. Tappi[INVESTIGATOR_629670] -messaging, this approach will reduce the burden of MBC delivery and improve 
safety.  
 
The proposed trial will improve scientific knowledge and clinical  practice   
High-frequency depression severity data yielded from this feasibility trial will reveal new insights 
into the day -to-day mood variations of patients being treated for depression.  
 
The methods and services that drive this field will be changed if  our aims are achieved   
Data from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_629671] a multi -center trial for CB -MBC which could 
change our approach to depression care.  
 
Specific Aims  
We propose the developm ent and validation of a chatbot -mediated approach for implementing 
MBC that we call Chatbot -Measurement Based Care ( CB-MBC. ) We hypothesize that the use of 
CB-MBC, which combines a conversational interface with state -of-the-art quantitative 
assessments, will improve depression symptom se verity for patients with depression.  
 
Specific Aim 1: Patient subjects in the intervention group will exhibit reduced depression 
severity compared to usual care.  
 
Specific Aim 2: Patient su bjects in the intervention group, compared to usual care,  will report  
a. lower side effec t burden  
b. greater behavioral self -efficacy  
c. greater maternal functioning  
 
Specific Aim 3: Obstetric p roviders will report satisfaction with the weekly email trends on their 
patients’ depression severity.

 Page 5 of 19 IRB16 -1802  
Version: 11MAY2019  A research coordinator  unaffiliated with the patient's medical care  will discuss possible study 
participation . The research coordinator  will then provide information about the study and obtain 
written  consent prior to screening subject . For screening, coordinators will confirm that the 
subject  owns  a smartphone in their possession  with a data plan . Next, they will administer a 
health literacy screen (REALM -R), followed by a baseline depression severity measurement 
(EPDS).  Subjects that fit the eligibility criteria will continue further in the study.  The research 
coordinator  will record information on the Chatbot Enrollment Log for each patient who is 
actually approached by [CONTACT_629689]. This will enable us to 
assess the possibility of selection bias. The enrollment log will not collect PHI.  
 
The research coordinator  will develop a separate log with patient names, date of birth (and 
study IDs, when applicable).  This log will help to ensure that patients are not approached 
multiple times without permission, will facilitate future contacts with study participants , etc. This 
log will be kept in a locked area (e.g. desk drawer) accessible only to approved study personnel.  
 
Provider  Subject s:  The providers will be reminded that they are not obligated to particip ate and 
that declining to participate will not in any impact employment. The research assistant will email 
or fax the consent form to the providers, depending on their preference. The providers will have 
the opportunity to consider the study before deciding whether to participate . Written consent will 
be obtained for interested subjects.  Subjects will be asked to sign, date, and securely email the 
signed consent form to the research assistant.  
 
Study Setting  
Subjects  will be recruited from the obstetric clinics and as inpatients at the Unive rsity of Chicago 
Medical Center . 
 
Trial Design  
Phase 1  (Completed) : We begin with a feasibility study in which all subjects receive CB-MBC 
care for 3 weeks . We will review the results and make any necessary changes in the chatbot  
platform before proceeding  with the Phase 2 clinical trial . In Phase 2 , subjects  are rando mized 
to Group 1  (usual c are) or Group 2 ( CB-MBC ) and followed for [ADDRESS_839839]  burden, pati ent-
engagement, patient satisfaction, and provider satisfaction.  
 
Interventions  
Phase 1  (Completed)  - All subjects will be asked to connect with the chatbot  via Facebook 
Messenger . Subjects  will then receive a [ADDRESS_839840] will 
be asked to participate in a semi -structured  debrief  interview  focused on  the user’s experience . 
 
Phase 2  - This is an open -label randomized control trial comparing depression severity in 
subjects entering treatment for major depression. Using a random number generator 
(www.random.org ) subjects will be separated  into the followin g groups:   
 
Group 1 : Subjects in this group  will receive a monthly phone call reminding them to complete 
surveys that were securely emailed. The five (5) monthly surveys will ask about mood, 
 Page 6 of 19 IRB16 -1802  
Version: 11MAY2019  medication adherence if any, side effects from any medication, maternal functioning, and 
maternal confidence.  The surveys could take up to 20 minutes to complete . The survey answers 
are stored in a secure database. Information collected will not be shared with the obstetric 
provider.    
 
Group 2 :  Subjects in group 2 will receive a short  explanation on how to use a depression 
“chatbot.” A chatbot is like having a chat with a robot. The chatbot will use Facebook 
Messenger . The research assistant will discuss FB/FB Messenger privacy settings with each 
study participant p rior to enro llment.  This include s verification that all settings related to FB 
Messenger logs and data sharing (e.g., call and text logs for Android phones) will be switched to 
“OFF” .  
 
Two of the surveys (mood and side effects of medication) will be admin istered weekly by 
[CONTACT_629690] , and should take about [ADDRESS_839841] conditioning.37 This group will also receive additional “gamified” 
feedback regarding completio n streaks (e.g., “Congratulations, you’ve completed 5 out of 5 
depression check ins!”). Subjects  in this group will also  have  their CAT -DI measurements 
displayed back to them via the CA interface. The results will be displayed using a combination 
of graphi c and story -telling elements (e.g., “Your mood has improved by 10% since we last 
connected! That’s great progress.”). Subjects  will be oriented to printed examples of these 
feedback elements and have any of their  questions answered by [CONTACT_629691]. 
 
Both groups:   Upon completion of the study , subjects from both groups will be asked to 
participate in a semi -structured interview.   
 
 
Survey Instruments  
The following survey instruments will be utilized during the study. The schedule and survey 
administration method is described in Section 8 below . 
 
Computerized Adaptive Testing: Depression Screen (CAT -DI):  (secondary outcome), is a 
computerized adaptive dimensional severity measure for depression.[ADDRESS_839842] ’s 
depression severity, which is dynamically estimated as the subject responds to successive test 
items. The process continues until the uncertainty in this severity score estimate drops below a 
 Page 7 of 19 IRB16 -1802  
Version: 11MAY2019  pre-specified level (e.g., 5 points on a 100 -point scale). A prior study has shown that an average 
of 12 items and a median time of 137 seconds had a 95% correlation of with a 389 total item 
bank score.38 The resulting severity score maintains a strong correlation with the DSM -IV 
(SCID) diagnostic categories of none, minor depression (including dysthymia), and MDD. The 
CAT-DI categorized response s as 1) normal, 2) mild, 3) moderate, or 4) severe depression. The 
CAT-DI will be administered on a weekly basis via the chatbot interface to Phase 1 and Phase 2 
(for Group 2 subjects ). Severity results from the CAT -DI will form the basis of feedback provi ded 
to subjects in this arm. A refined version of the CAT -DI, optimized for perinatal depression, will 
be used for this study.39 
 
Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medi cine, Revised  (REALM -R)[ADDRESS_839843]  
used to identify people at risk for poor health literacy. 11 -items, administration time: 3 minutes   
This survey is administered on paper.  
 
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)40 provides a discrete measure of perinatal 
depression. It will be administered by [CONTACT_629692] , 10-item, administration time: 5  minutes .  At screening this survey is administered on 
paper.  At all following visits, subjects complete the survey via RedCap.  
 
Medication Adherence Question  will be used to document medication adherence, 1 -item, 
administration time: 1 minute   Subjects complete the survey via RedCap.  
 
The Frequency, Intensity, and Burden of Side Effects Rating (FIBSER)[ADDRESS_839844]: 
frequency, intensity, and burden,  administration time: 2 minutes   Group 1 subjects complete the 
survey via RedCap.  Group 2 subjects complete the survey via RedCap on some days and 
complete it using the chatbot interface on other days . 
 
Confidence Questionnaire  – to measure  behavioral  self-efficacy, 7-items, administration time: 5-
minutes . This questionnaire has been previously used by [CONTACT_629693].   Subjects complete the survey via RedCap.  
 
Barkin  Index of Maternal Functioning43 questionnaire designed to measure matern al functioning 
after childbirth, 20 -items, administration time: 7  minutes   Subjects complete the survey via 
RedCap.  
 
A Debrief Tool  has been developed to be used as the basis for semi -structured interviews  
following the trial , adminis tration time: 6  minutes   The study team will administer this interview 
over the phone or in person.

Covariates  
 
Conversational agent metrics  (secondary outcomes) will be assessed to better understand 
the acceptability of  CB-MBC . When a subject  reads a  CB-MBC  message, that session will be 
considered “active” . If the subject  responds to the message, that session will be considered 
“engaged”. A “ Conversation” will be defined as an interchange involving more than [ADDRESS_839845]  
inputs within a 5 -minute in terval . Using these definitions, we will track:   
• Active rate = (number of active sessions of a user)/(total number of sessions of that subject ).  
• Engag ed rate = (number of engaged sessions of a user)/(total sessions of that subject ).  
• Average number of conversations/user   
 
Clinical covariates  including sociodemographic including subject  gender, age, insurance 
status, and race/ethnicity will be collected from the chart review. Co -morbidity burden will be 
quantified using the enhanced version of the validated Charlson –Deyo comorbidity index (CCI) 
for administrative data.69–71 Other healthcare -related covariates included having a primary care 
provider; and c urrent use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco will also be collected.  
 
Statistical methods, sample size, and expected outcomes  
 Page 10 of 19 IRB16 -1802  
Version: 11MAY2019  The primary outcome of depression severity as measured by [CONTACT_629694]-MBC  intervention  groups. While we 
anticipate that our sample will be underpowered for formal hypothesis testing, an intention to 
treat (IIT) analysis with multiple imputation and linear mixed -effects regression will be used to 
test for di fferences and examine potential effect size. Similarly, the study results will provide us 
with estimates odds ratios and 95% CI for discrete secondary endpoints.  
 
While a definitive randomized control trial is not the intent of this trial, a power calculat ion was 
performed to understand the limitations of our design and to plan for next steps. Assuming our 
population exhibits normally distributed depression severity scores, a typi[INVESTIGATOR_629673] -to-wave re -
interview attrition rate of 5%, a [ADDRESS_839846], an alpha = 0.05, power = 0.8, and simple residual 
auto-correlated errors, or rho = 0.3, we would need [ADDRESS_839847] size (ES) of 1.0 at the 4th (12 week) time -point. We anticipate that the ES of CB-
MBC  will be much more modest as the average ES of antidepressants is 0.32 (.11 – 0.69).[ADDRESS_839848] seven  years after completion of the 
research . 
 
Data Confidentiality  
Research subjects will be assigne d a unique study number. No personal health information 
(PHI) is entered into the database.  
 
All information will be treated as confidential material and will be available only to the 
designated research and clinical staff at each site. All paper -based materials, like con sent forms 
and data collection forms, will be kept at our ED Research Office under securely locked 
conditions with access limited to authorized staff only.  
 
In the research records, subjects will be identified by a subject number and the name [CONTACT_629711] [CONTACT_629695] [INVESTIGATOR_80721].  All data stored in RedCap (electronic database) will 
be accessible only to trained RAs w ho are given access by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_629674].  
 
Consent and HIPAA forms will be stored in locked cabinet until the study is closed and no 
further manuscripts are ongoing. These documents will be accessible only to trained staff.  In 
compliance with HIPAA, data will be kept for [ADDRESS_839849] completed HIPAA 
 Page 11 of 19 IRB16 -1802  
Version: 11MAY2019  training. All researchers are instructed that the data are to remain on the CRI -hosted secure 
servers. As an additional layer of safety, chat logs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_629696].  
 
For subjects  using CB-MBC  via Facebo ok Messenger, chat logs are maintained on the 
Facebook Messenger platform. It should be noted that any results of depression or other 
assessments will be displayed to the subject  in non -machine readable formats such as images. 
As an extra precaution, Faceb ook Messenger logs will be deleted each day. It should be noted 
that Facebook generally already has access to PHI including name, address, and birthdate as 
part of their Terms of Service. If a breach of data privacy or security is discovered, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_629675] 48 hours.   
 
Risks  
 
Risk to privacy . As with all medical research involving human subjects, there is a risk of 
inadvertent disclosure or theft of protected health information (PHI) from paper enrollment log, 
REDCap electronic data capture system, the HIPAA -compliant cloud database, or the subject’s  
Facebook Messenger account. We see these risks as minimal and will address ways of 
reducing these risks below.   
  
Risk of discomfort . Subjects will be able to withdraw from the study at any time. If a subject 
becomes noticeably distressed, the RA wi ll inform his or her treating physician.   
  
Risk of additional/reduced assessment or treatment.  Treating providers  will not have access 
to screening or follow -up depression severity and side effect  information obtained from monthl y 
telephone interviews. A ssessment results from subjects  randomized to CB-MBC  will be 
automatically sent to the provider on a weekly basis. It is a desired outcome that these 
assessment results motivate the provider  to consider contact[CONTACT_629697]. This type of additional assessment and treatment would be 
expected to be beneficial goal of this intervention. We believe the risk of an adverse event 
related to additional assessment by [CONTACT_629698].  
 
Conversely, participation in the study will not prohibit involvement in any other type of 
assessment and/or treatment. All participants will be allowed (and/or encouraged) to participate 
in whatever type or amount of treatment is thought to be clini cally indicated for the subject . 
Thus, participation in the study will not cause any participant to be deprived of a clinically 
appropriate assessment and/or treatment.  
  
Risk of disclosure of suicidal ideation . Women with perinatal depression are at higher risk for 
experiencing suicidal ideation. We will be actively assessing for suicidal ideation via in -clinic 
screening and telep hone assessments. T here is also the risk of inadvertent disclosure of self -
harm behav ior during these contact [CONTACT_360222] . In addition, for patients using the chatbot, the CAT -
DI depression item bank includes [ADDRESS_839850] of tracking depression symptoms in depressed patients 
increases the risk of suicide or worsening depression as compared to usual care.  The principal 
 Page 12 of 19 IRB16 -1802  
Version: 11MAY2019  investigator will report the adverse event to the IRB within [ADDRESS_839851] .  
 
Medicolegal risk to providers.   As part of the Phases 1 & 2, provi der subjects will receive a 
weekly encrypted email report of their patients enrolled in the chatbot group. During the consent 
process, providers will be oriented to the format of these email reports and the study’s intention 
that they review the report and  make treatment changes as necessary. They will be alerted to 
the potential medicolegal risk associated with ignoring or not responding to these reports.  
Providers will have the option of not participating in the study if they are uncomfortable with this 
risk. 
 
Protections Against Risk    
 
Physical harm.  In order to manage subject  expectations, during orientation we will explain that 
the CB-MBC  is an experimental platform and that no one is actively monitoring their responses 
on a daily basis. Patients will be told to expect follow -up from the team and/or their providers if 
they disclose potential thoughts of suicide, self -harm, or harm to other s via the chatbot or during 
phone interviews.  
  
The potential safety mechanisms for detecting and responding to suicidal ideation are outlined 
below. For all cases, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_629676] t safety per standard of care guidelines:   
 
 Detection during initial enrollment:  If suicidal ideation or self -harm is disclosed by [CONTACT_629699], the research coordinator  will immediately contact [CONTACT_629700].  In addition, the research assistant will notify [CONTACT_629713] to discuss the 
case.  As recommended in the original publication, a patient who scores a 1, 2 , or 3 on 
question #10  of the EPDS ( “The thought of harming myself has occurred to me”  ”1. hardly 
ever”, “ 2. sometimes”, or “ 3. yes quite often”) will trigger an evaluation for active suicidality 
by [CONTACT_15370] .40 
 
 Detection during telephone follow -up: If suicidal ideation or self -harm is disclosed by [CONTACT_629701]/she feels safe. If the subject does not feel safe, they will 
be encouraged to call [ADDRESS_839852] emergency department They will also be 
given suicide prevention resources including the Suicide Hotline (available 24 ho urs a day, 7 
days per week) at 1 -800-273-TALK (1 -[PHONE_113]) or 1 -800-SUICIDE (1 -[PHONE_13109])  
or the crisis text line (text HOME to 741741) . We will not remind patients of the risk 
involuntary admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_629677] y represent a 
disincentive for seeking help. If the patient feel s safe, he/she will be told to expect a call 
from their treating physician or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_629678]. The research assistant will then contact 
[INVESTIGATOR_124]. Beiser  to discuss the case. [CONTACT_629713]  will then contact [CONTACT_629702] -up with the patient. The treating physician or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_629679] -harm and make 
a safety plan . 
 
 Detection during REDCap email EPDS survey : If the patient scores a 1, 2, or 3 on question 
#10 of the EPDS, (“The thought of harming myself has occurred to me”  ”1. hardly ever”, “2. 
sometimes”, or “3. yes quite often”) the REDCap email survey will automati cally branch and

Version: 11MAY2019  ask if the patient feels safe. If the subject does not feel safe, they will be encouraged to call 
[ADDRESS_839853] emergency department. They will also be given suicide prevention 
resources including the Suicide Hotline (available 24 hours a day, 7 days per week) at 1 -
800-273-TALK (1 -[PHONE_113]) or 1 -800-SUICIDE (1 -[PHONE_13109]) or the crisis text line 
(text HOME to 741741). Finally, an automated text message that contains a studyID without 
any PHI will be sent to [CONTACT_554858]  indicating that a patient has triggered a suicide alert . At any 
point, NorthShore’s 866 -364-MOMS hotline may be used for clinical consultation and 
immediate patient support  
 
 Detection via  CB-MBC : If suicidal ideation or self -harm is indicated by a participant’s  
response s to the chatbot , a member of the team will follow -up with them either immediately 
or within 24 hours by [CONTACT_629703].  This 
safety response algori thm is outlined in Appendix 1 .  The participant’s treatment provider will 
also be notified  within [ADDRESS_839854] operating protocols.  
 
The consent process explains this (i.e., that they  may be further evaluated by [CONTACT_629704]). This evaluation, in rare 
circumstances, may involve involuntary commitment to protect the individ ual or someone else if 
they report that they are imminently suicidal or homicidal. This judgment is based on standard 
operating protocols and clinical policies.  
Monitoring Plan to Ensure the Safety of Participants  
A plan to periodically evaluate informatio n collected regarding risks or harms to determine 
whether participants remain safe is in place.  The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_629705]. Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_629680] a monthly basis. 
These reviews will allow the study personnel to monitor the progress as well as to determine if 
there are any unanticipated problems occurring.

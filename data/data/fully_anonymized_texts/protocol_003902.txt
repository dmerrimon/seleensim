approved informed consent form (ICF).  
Approximately  830 eligible patients, 18 years of age and older, will be randomized in a 2:2:1 
ratio (Test: Reference: Placebo) to one of the three study products as follows:  
 Test: Ketoconazole Cream  2% (Encube Ethicals Pvt Ltd)  
 Reference : Ketoconazole Cream 2% (G&W Lab oratories Inc.; Registrant: Teva 
Pharmaceuticals [LOCATION_003] Inc.))  
 Placebo : Placebo  Cream (Test vehicle) (Encube Ethicals Pvt Ltd)  
Patients will complete three clinic visits as follows:  
 Visit 1 (Day 1): Screening/Baseline  
 Visit 2 (Day 42 ± 4): End of Treatment  
 Visit 3 (Day 56 ± 4): Test -of-Cure/End of Study  
Patients will be instructed to apply the study product to affected and immediate surrounding 
areas once daily for a total of 42  ± 4 days starting on the day of enrollment (i.e.,  Day 1). The last 
dose should b e applied on the day of Visit 2 (Day 42 ± 4). Evaluations will be performed in 
accordance with the study schematic. Safety assessments will include monitoring of adverse 
events (AEs), vital signs measurement, and urine pregnancy tests (for females of child bearing 
potential). Clinical assessments will include the potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet mount, 
mycological culture, and rating of signs and symptoms. The Investigator should identify the most 
severe lesion (i.e., target lesion) at baseline. Although the st udy product should be applied to all 
infected areas (both feet), only the target lesion will be evaluated for analysis.

randomization schedule. The randomization will be generated in blocks, each c ontaining five 
patients’ worth of study product ([ADDRESS_947479], 2 Reference, and 1 Placebo).  
The randomization /patient  number will be a unique four -digit number.  This number will be 
assigned immediately before dispensing of study product and in ascending sequen tial order, 
beginning with the lowest available number at the study site. Each patient kit and each dispensed 
study tube should include the four -digit patient number on the label.  
At the end of the study, after all the clinical data have been entered and t he study database has 
been locked, a copy of the randomization schedule will be sent to the statistician.  
The Investigator, staff at the study site, study monitors, and data analysis/management personnel 
will be blinded to the patient assignment.  
5. SAMPL E SIZE  
For the primary endpoint analysis (proportion of patients in the PP population with a Therapeutic 
Cure at the test -of-cure visit), sample size is estimated for therapeutic equivalence of the Test to 
the Reference product and superiority of each of t he active treatments groups over Placebo. The 
sample size estimations are based on previous studies conducted for ketoconazole cream  (Teva 
Pharmaceuticals; ANDA 75 -581). Readers are encouraged to see the protocol reference list for 
the results of the previous studies used for sample size calculation.  
In the PP population, the proportion of patients with a Therapeutic Cure in the Reference group 
is expected to be 50%. Assuming that the Therapeutic Cure rate for the Test treatment group is 
an absolute di fference of 5% lower than the Reference Responder rate (i.e., p T - pR = -5%), a 
sample size of 172  patients in each active group in the PP population will provide approximately 
85% power to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence (i.e., the 90% confidence inte rval [Yates’ 
continuity -corrected] on the p T - pR difference is within a defined equivalence range [ -20%, 
+20%]).  
The Therapeutic Cure rates for the Placebo and active treatment groups at the test -of-cure visit 
are anticipated to be approximately 10% and a t least 40% (Test  = 40%, Reference  = 45%), 
respectively, in the mITT population. Using a 2:1 (Active: Placebo) randomization scheme, and 
assuming the conversion rate from mITT to PP will be approximately 80%, 216 patients in each 
active treatment group (Te st and Reference) and [ADDRESS_947480] 99% power to demonstrate superiority of active treatments over 
Placebo ( p < 0.05; using two -sided, continuity -corrected Z-test and a pooled response rate f or the 
standard error of the difference in proportions).

correlation between th e two superiority tests.  
To allow for approximately 35% of patients who may have negative fungal cultures post -
randomization, drop out from the study or are otherwise non -evaluable, approximately 830 
patients may be randomized (332 in each active group and  166 in the Placebo group) to yield 
540 patients in the mITT population.  
More than 50% of the patients should have baseline fungal cultures that test positive for 
T .rubrum . If fewer than 50% of enrolled patients have a positive T .rubrum  culture or the 
number of patients with negative fungal cultures is more than anticipated, then additional 
patients may be enrolled to ensure that at least 430 (172:172:86) patients are eligible in the 
PP population, of which  > 50% have a positive T. rubrum  culture at basel ine. 
6. EFFICACY VARIABLES AND EFFICACY  ENDPOINTS  
Efficacy Variables  
The primary and secondary efficacy variables are the outcome of the KOH test (negative or 
positive), outcome of the mycological culture (negative or positive), and signs and symptoms 
scores.  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients in each treatment group with a 
Therapeutic Cure of tinea pedis at the test -of-cure visit two weeks after the end of treatment 
(Day  56 ± 4). 
Secondary Efficacy  Endpoints:  
The secondary efficacy endpoints are:  
 The proportion of patients in each treatment group with a Clinical Cure at Day 56 ± 4.  
 The proportion of patients in each treatment group with a Mycological Cure at Day 
56 ± 4.  
Definitions  
1. Therapeutic Cure:  To be considered a Therapeutic Cure, the patient must have both 
Clinical and Mycological Cure of tinea pedis.  
2. Therapeutic Failure:  A patient will be considered a Therapeutic Failure if:

4. Clinical Failure: A patient will be considered a Clinical Failure if the patient’s total 
severity score is > 2 or any individual score is > 1.  
5. Mycological Cure: To be considered a myco logical cure the patient must have a negative 
KOH test and a negative fungal culture.  
6. Mycological Failure:  A patient will be considered a Mycological Failure if the patient’s 
KOH test is positive or the patient’s fungal culture is positive.

 Met all inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
 Made the final study visit within the protocol window of Day 56 ± 4 days (Day  52 
to Day  60 inclusive)  with no protocol viola tions that would affect the treatment 
evaluation.  
 Did not have any significant protocol deviations.  
 Were compliant with dosing between 75% -125% of the required doses.  
 Had a positive baseline KOH and fungal culture for Trichophyton rubrum, 
Trichophyton mentagrophyties or Epi[INVESTIGATOR_697998].  
Patients discontinued from the study because of lack of treatment effect after completing at least 
[ADDRESS_947483] any significant 
protocol deviations. For these patients, there will be no mycological testing at time of 
discontinuation; therefore, they will be considered Therapeutic Failures in the primar y analysis 
but the Mycological Cure data will be set to missing for the secondary endpoint.

8.2 Efficacy Analyses  
8.2.1 Efficacy Analyses on Primary and Secondary Endpoints  
Therapeutic Equivalence  
Therapeutic equivalence will be evaluated for the primary endpoint in the per -protocol (PP) 
population. If the 90% confidence interval (calculated using Yates’ continuity correction) on the 
absolute difference between the proportion  of patients with a Therapeutic Cure in the Test and 
Reference groups (p T - pR) is contained within the range [ -20%, +20%] then therapeutic 
equivalence of the Test product to the Reference product will be considered to have been 
demonstrated.  
The same stat istical approach will be conducted for analyses of the secondary endpoints in the PP 
population.  
To declare therapeutic equivalence of the Test product to the Reference product, equivalence 
must be demonstrated for only the primary endpoint in the PP population.  
Patients who are missing mycological culture data at the test -of-cure visit will not be included in 
the analysis for the secondary endpoint of Mycological Cure.

considered Therapeutic Failures in the primary analysis but the Mycological Cure data will be set  
to missing for the secondary endpoint. No LOCF will be performed.  
If the propor tions of patients with a Therapeutic Cure in the Test and the Reference product 
groups are numerically and statistically superior to that of the Placebo ( p < 0.05; using  a two -
sided Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel [CMH] test, stratified by [CONTACT_68566] ) then supe riority of the 
Test and Reference products over Placebo will be concluded.  
The same statistical approach will be conducted for analyses of the secondary endpoints in the 
mITT population.  
To declare superiority of the Test and Reference products over Placeb o, their superiority must be 
demonstrated for only the primary endpoint in the mITT population.  
Treatment -by-Site Interaction and Pooling of Clinical Sites  
As this is a multiple -site study, the interaction of treatment -by-site may be evaluated for the 
primary efficacy endpoint in the PP population for equivalence testing. The treatment -by-site 
interaction will be evaluated by [CONTACT_117889] -Day test for homogene ity of the odds ratio at the 5% 
significance level ( p < 0.05, 2 -sided). A site(s) with a low enrollment rate(s) may be pooled with 
its geographically closest site, so as to avoid bias in the stratification of the sites in the CMH test 
and in the estimation  of a treatment -by-site interaction effect. The pooling will be done for low 
enrolling sites that account for less than 4 -7% of the total number of patients in the PP 
population at the site with the highest enrolling rate in the PP  population. If the treat ment -by-site 
interaction term is found to be statistically significant ( p < 0.05) for the primary endpoint, then 
the interaction term will also be assessed for clinical relevance before pooling the data across 
sites. This will include examination of Therap eutic Cure rates at each site where sample sizes per 
treatment may be influential in the assessment of the interaction. The treatment -by-site

8.3 Safety Analysis  
8.3.1 Adverse Events  
All the adverse events (AEs) reported throughout the study will be coded and classified 
according to the MedDRA (Medi cal Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) coding  dictionary 
(Version 21.0 or higher).  
Treatment emerge nt advers e events (TEAE) are those that have a start date after the study 
treatment has been administered or the events that were present before administ ration of study 
treatment and worsen in severity after administration of study treatment.  Treatment emergent 
adverse events  will be summarized and analyzed in a summary table. Pre -treatment  adverse 
events will be presented in the listing.  
A summary table o f the number and percent of patients with TEAEs by [CONTACT_9313], 
preferred term, and treatment will be presented. Each patient will be counted only once within 
each preferred term.  
A frequency summary table of the number of TEAEs by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, 
severity, and treatment will be presented. Severity  will be classified as “Mild”, “Moderate”, or 
“Severe”.  
Similarly, a frequency summary table of the number of TEAEs by [CONTACT_9313], preferred 
term, and relationship to a study drug, and treatment will be presented. Relationship to a study 
drug will be classified as “Not Related” or “ Related” . 
If sufficient data exist, then TEAE frequencies will be compared among the three treatments 
using Fisher’s exact t est; if this test is statistically significant at the 5% significance level, then a 
pairwise Fisher’s exact test comparing Test and Reference will be conducted.  
TEAEs will be listed by [CONTACT_90217].  Pre-treatment adverse events will be list ed 
by [CONTACT_4676].

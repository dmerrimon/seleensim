 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
 
 
Title:  A Single Arm Phase II Trial of the Intraoperative Intravesical 
Instillation of Mitomycin C During Nephroureterectomy for Urothelial Carcinoma of the Upper Urinary Tract  
 
Funding Organization:   
University of [LOCATION_012]  
 
Investigational 
Agent Supplier:   
Commercial supply  
 
 
 
 
Rationale:  We have recently completed a retrospective review of our experience at the 
University of [LOCATION_012] of the administration of intraoperative of mitomycin C 
compared to mitomycin C administered post -operative day one or later. 
Results of this study suggest that the timing of intravesical mitomycin C 
may impact bladder tumor recurrence rate following radical 
nephroureterectomy. This is the first stu dy of its kind to attempt to identify 
the importance of timing of mitomycin C administration relative to bladder 
tumor recurrence rate following radical  nephroureterectomy.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Objectives:   
Primary: 
• Determine the one -year bladder tumor recurrence rate in 
patients with urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary  tract 
following intraoperative administration of mitomycin  C 
 
Secondary:  
• Evaluate the time to bladder tumor recurrence in patients with 
urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract following intraoperative administration of  mitomycin  
 
• Determine the three -year tumor recurrence rate in patients 
with urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract following intraoperative administration of mitomycin  C 
Study Design:  This is a single arm, open label,  phase II study.

Accrual Goal:  A total of 53 subjects.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Inclusion 
Criteria:  Individuals eligible for study participation must meet the following criteria:  
 
A. Both males and females ≥ eighteen years of age  
B. Clinical diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis and/or 
ureter. Clinical diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma may be based upon radiographic, pathologic or cytological findings alone or in combination with one another .  No other histology is  allowed.  
C. The TNM stage of the subject’s disease (using the American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] Cancer Staging Manual, 8th Edition) must be Tis, Ta, T1, T2, or T3, N0, M0. Subjects may have either a high- grade or low -grade  tumor.  
D. ECOG performance status of  0-[ADDRESS_1080963] to comply with all the study- related  procedures. 
F. Women  of childbearing potential  (WOCBP)  must  be using an adequate 
method of contraception to avoid pregnancy prior to and for at lea st 
three months after mitomycin C instillation to minimize the risk of 
pregnancy. Prior to study  enrollment,  women  of childbearing  potential 
must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors f
or an unintentional 
pregnancy.  
WOCBP include any woman who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not post-  
menopausal. Post - menopa use is defined as:  
• Amenorrhea that has lasted for ≥ 12 consecutive  months  
without another cause, or  
• For women with irregular menstrual periods who are taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT), a documented serum follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level of greater than 35 
mIU/mL.  
G. Males with female partners of child -bearing potential  must  
agree to use physician -approved contraceptive methods ( e.g., 
abstinence, condoms, vasectomy) and should avoid conceiving children 
prior to and for three months following mitomycin C  instillation.  
H. Subjects must have hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL and a platelet  count  
≥ 100,000/μL.

Exclusion 
Criteria:   
Subjects with any of the following will not be eligible for study participation: 
 
A.  Active urothelial carcinoma of the bladder within [ADDRESS_1080964] at high risk for treatment complications, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_519099].

a psychiatric or physical  illness.  
K. Subjects demonstrating an inability to comply with the study 
and/or follow -up procedures.  
 
 
Efficacy 
Assessments:  Patients will be evaluated for bladder tumor recurrence every [ADDRESS_1080965] year following 
nephroureterectomy by [CONTACT_785894][INVESTIGATOR_785884]. Patients with 
suspected recurrence of urothelial carcinoma within the bladder will require 
bladder biopsy for histologic confirmation.

Statistical 
Considerations:  The primary endpoint for this study is the bladder tumor recurrence (BTR) rate 
at 1-year post -surgery. A one -sided, one sample exact test of proportion will 
be used to assess the primary endpoint, 1- year BTR rates, with level of 
significance set at 0.10. T ime to BTR will be characterized using Kaplan - 
Meier plots. Log -rank tests and Cox proportional hazard modeling will be 
used to examine the impact of baseline characteristics. A p -value of less  than 
0.05 will be considered statistically significant.  
 
In our previous study, there was a 16% recurrence rate for those that received mitomycin C on day 0 and a 33% recurrence rate for those receiving it on day 1 or later. From this we will assume that the underlying proportion of BTR at 1 year is 25% for our population. A sample size of [ADDRESS_1080966] the decrease of 1 -year BTR rate from 25% to 12.5% based on Simon's 
optimal two -stage design and to reach more than 80% power with a one -sided 
type [ADDRESS_1080967] -surgery is less than 10, the treatment will be considered  a success. 
The sample size was calculated using the PASS 16.  
Estimated Enrollment 
Period:   
48 months  
Estimated Study Duration:  [ADDRESS_1080968] urothelial carcinoma accou nts for less than 10% of 
malignancies of the upper urinary tract 2. The incidence of upper tract urothelial 
carcinoma has slowly increased over the past [ADDRESS_1080969] urothelial carcinoma and lower 
risk tumors not amenable to endoscopic management 2, 4. Unfortunately, recurrence in 
the bladder is common, occurring in 22- 47% of cases4.  
1.2 Overview of Mitom ycin in the Treatment of Urothelial  Carcinoma  
Mitomycin C (MMC) is an alkylating agent which cross links DNA between adenine and guanine residues thus blocking DNA synthesis and mitosis 5. Activity against 
urothelial carcinoma has been documented for over [ADDRESS_1080970] demonstrated a benefit of a 60- minute dwell time over a 30- minute dwell time with a 
significant reduction in tumor recurrence noted in the 60- minute treatment group9.  
The prophylactic efficacy of MMC in decreasing bladder tumor recurrences following 
transurethral resection of bladder tumors is well documented. It is theorized the decreased recurrence rates are accomplished via both destroying implanted tumor cells after transurethral resection (TUR) and an ablative effect on residual cells at the resection site and on small overlooked tumors. A combined analysis  randomized trials 
including 2535 patients demonstrated a 20% decrease in tumor recurrence in patients receiving a single dose of chemotherapy with TUR compared to TUR alone 10. The 
timing of MMC administration has been documented to be an important factor on the 
rate of tumor recurrence following TUR. Early drug administration (within 24 hours) 
was noted to be superior over delayed drug administration (between 7- 15 days) in a 
randomized trial with a 30% reduction in tumor recurrence 11. 
UF-GU-001 2020 -09-17 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 12 of 38  Version 7 .1  
 These results are further supported by [CONTACT_785895]. whose trial demonstrated a 50% 
relative reduction of tumor recurrence when MMC is administered within 24 hours of TUR12. Finally, a meta -analysis of studies evaluating TUR alone and TUR with one 
immedia te instillation of chemotherapy noted a 39% decrease in the odds of recurrence 
with the addition of a single dose of chemotherapy compared to TUR alone 13. 
Two separate prospective trials have demonstrated a single dose of adjuvant intravesical 
chemotherapy with either mitomycin C or pi[INVESTIGATOR_785885] 15,16. These results were confirmed in a 
meta -analysis by [CONTACT_785896]. al in 2014, with a pooled hazard ratio of 0.[ADDRESS_1080971] -operative day one or later. A total of 51 patients were 
identified meeting our inclusion criteria. Patients were categorized into two separate groups based on the timing of mitomycin C administration: (1) patients who received mitomycin C on the day of surgery (POD0) and (2) patients who received mitomycin C on post -opera tive day 1 or later (POD1). Our primary endpoint was BTR rate within the 
first year after surgery. Our secondary endpoint was overall BTR rate during follow up. 
Associations between treatment groups and recurrence rates were assessed using 
Kaplan -Meier plo ts, log -rank tests, and univariable and multivariable Cox proportional 
hazard models. Mean length of follow -up for each group was 22.1 and 12.5 months, 
respectively (p=0.02). There were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics o f age, gender, race, surgical approach, tumor grade, tumor stage, 
surgical margins, nodal status, concomitant CIS, or history of bladder cancer.  
 
BTR rates at 1 year for the POD0 and POD1 groups were 16% and 33%, respectively 
(p=0.09). Overall BTR rates, including time points beyond the first year, were 23% and 
33%, respectively (p=0.16). Multivariable analysis noted that the POD0 patients had a significantly lower rate of BTR in the first year postoperatively (HR=0.082, 95% CI=0.01- 0.56, p=0.01). Other fa ctors that were associated with a higher rate of BTR 
within the first year were open surgery (HR=7.9, 95% CI=1.18- 53.88, p=0.03), positive 
surgical margins (HR=37.89, 95% CI=1.74- 825.35, p=0.02), and concomitant CIS 
(HR=10.8, 95% CI=1.08 -108.72). Our resul ts suggest that the timing of intravesical 
mitomycin C administration may affect the rate of BTR following radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) for urothelial carcinoma.

3. STUDY DESIGN 
 
3.1 Study Overview  
This is a single arm, open -label, phase II study. Subjects with clinically localized 
urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis and/or ureter who are scheduled to undergo 
nephroureterectomy will be intraoperatively treated with mitomycin C duri ng their 
nephroureterectomy procedure. Subjects will then be monitored post -operatively for 
bladder tumor recurrence every three months for the first two years and every six months for the third year after their nephroureterectomy.  
 
Screening data will be reviewed to determine subject eligibility. Subjects who meet all 
inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into the study.  
 
Total duration of subject participation will be approximately three years. Total duration 
of the study is expected to be seven years.  
 
4. SELECTION OF  SUBJECTS  
 
Subjects with a diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis and/or ureter who 
meet the following inclusion and exclusion criteria will be eligible for participation in 
this study.

A. Both males and females ≥ eighteen years of  age 
B. Clinical diagnosis of urothelial car cinoma of the renal pelvis and/or ureter. Clinical 
diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma may be based upon radiographic, pathologic or cytological 
findings alone or in combination with one another. No other histology is allowed.  
C. The TNM stage of the subject’s disease (using the American Joint 
Committee on  Cancer [AJCC] Cancer Staging Manual, 8th Edition) must be 
Tis, Ta, T1, T2, or T3, N0, M0. Subjects may have either a high- grade or 
low-grade  tumor.

method of contraception to avoid pregnancy prior to and for at least [ADDRESS_1080975] be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation 
and the potential risk factors for an unintentional  pregnancy.  
WOCBP include any woman who has experienced menarche and who has 
not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal 
ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not post -menopausal. Post -
menopause is defined as:  
• Amenorrhea that has lasted for ≥ 12 consecutive months without another cause, 
or 
• For women with irregular menstrual periods who are taking hormone  
replacement therapy (HRT), a documented serum follicle -stimulating 
hormone (FSH) level of greater than 35 mIU/mL.  
G. Males with female partners of child -bearing potential must agree to use 
physician-  approved contraceptive methods ( e.g., abstinence, condoms, 
vasectomy) should avoid conceiving children prior to and for [ADDRESS_1080976] hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL and a platelet count ≥  100,000/μL. 
 
4.3 Exclusion Criteria  
Subjects with any of the following will not be eligible for study participation:

UF-GU-001 2020 -09-17 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 of 38  Version 7 .1  
 • Radiographic disease  staging 
• CT scan or MRI or PET  CT of the abdomen and pelvis  
• Chest X -ray or chest CT or PET CT of  chest  
 
6.2 On Study Procedures/Evaluations  
Subjects will undergo a single instillation of mitomycin C during their 
nephroureterectomy as described in section 7.1. An adverse event assessment wi ll be 
performed before and after instillation of mitomycin C the day of nephroureterectomy, 
as well as within 30 days following mitomycin C instillation, during a clinic visit.  
6.3 Follow up/Survival  Evaluations  
Subjects will have a follow -up visit every three  months (+/ - 3 weeks) post -
operatively for two years to assess for bladder tumor recurrence. Subjects will have a 
follow -up visit every six months (+/ - 3 weeks) post -operatively the third year to 
assess for bladder tumor recurrence.  
Subjects will have the following procedures at each of these visits:  
• Urinalysis  
• Surveillance  cystoscopy  
Urine cytology with reflex UroVysion .  UroVysion testing will be performed if 
urine cytology result is atypi[INVESTIGATOR_785884] . If recurrence of urothelial 
carcinoma within the  bladder is suspected at any point , a subject will undergo a 
bladder biopsy to confirm recurrence. Once recurrence has been confirmed, the subject will no longer be followed for purposes of this study.   
7. STUDY TREATMENT  
 
All subjects entering the screen ing phase will receive a unique subject number. This 
number will be used to identify the subject throughout the study. Subjects withdrawn from the study will retain their subject number.  
 
7.1   Treatment  Schedule/Administration  
A urethral catheter will be placed in a sterile fashion in the operating room and all urine 
will be drained. 40 mg of mitomycin C in 40 mL of sterile water will then be 
administered intravesically via a urethral catheter immediately following catheter 
placement. Immediately following mitomycin C instillation, the urethral catheter will be 
clamped for one hour. The nephroureterectomy procedure will start even while the 
urethral catheter is clamped. After this hour has elapsed, the mitomycin C will be 
drained from the bladder and the ur ethral catheter will be flushed with 100mL -200 mL 
(as clinically indicated) of sterile saline and drained. The urethral catheter will remain in place for the remainder of the surgical procedure. Timing of urethral catheter removal 
after the completion of the nephroureterectomy will be based on surgeon discretion.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1080978] of care medications used during 
surgery through discharge  will not be recorded.    
However, if another course of anti -cancer therapy is initiated prior to the thirty -day 
follow -up period visit; a record of concomitant medications will no longer be 
performed.  
 
If the use of any concomitant treatments (medications or procedures) becomes necessary, the treatment must be recorded, including the name [CONTACT_121366], dose, route, date, indication for use, expected duration, and frequency of treatment.  
 
7.2.2   A llowed Concomitant Therapy 
Supportive measures consistent with optimal  patient care will be given throughout the study.  
 
Bladder  spasms:  Anticholinergics should be administered per institutional  
guidelines for treatment or urethral catheter related bladder spams if bothersome to the  patient.  
 
Dysuria:  Medications for urinary  pain relief should be administered 
per institutional guidelines for pain associated with urination. Urinary tract infection should be evaluated with a urinalysis prior to starting medications to treat the symptom of  dysuria.  
 
Nausea:           Anti -emetics should be administered per institutional  guidelines.  
 
Diarrhea:  Subjects should be provided with instructions on use of  
loperamide (Imodium) in the event of diarrhea, as well as instructions to contact [CONTACT_1963]. Other anti-diarrheals are also allowed. Subjects should be given 
mouth care instructions per institutional guidelines. 
7.2.3 Prohibited Concomitant  Therapy  
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_199896]:  
• Antineoplastic s ystemic chemotherapy or biological  therapy  
• Immunotherapy not specified in this  protocol  
• Chemotherapy not specified in this  protocol  
UF-GU-001 2020 -09-17 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 18 of 38  Version 7 .1  
 • Investigational agents other than the study drug in this  trial 
• Radiation  therapy  
• Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_1080979] dose of trial treatment 
and while participating in the  trial. 
 Examples of live vaccines include but are not limited to: measles, 
mumps,  rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid 
(oral) vaccine.  
 Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed by [CONTACT_785897]. However, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. Flu-Mist ®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not  permitted.  
 
7.3 Dose  Modifications  
The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4 (CTCAE) will be used to grade toxicity (http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html ).
 
 
7.3.[ADDRESS_1080980] sical instillation of mitomycin C 
will be included in the study. No dose reduction is required based on intravesical 
administration and elimination via catheter drainage. Additionally, dose reduction 
is not anticipated based on results of prior randomized trials and published 
retrospective trials.  
 
7.3.2 Supportive Care  Guidelines  
Subjects should receive full supportive care, including transfusions of blood and blood 
products, antibiotics, antiemetics, antidiarrheals, analgesics, etc., when appropriate.  
 
7.3.3 Trial Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_785886] 3 (as defined by [CONTACT_407008]) which are life -threatening and require urgent medical 
intervention. The UFHCC DISC will monitor the study and will meet at regular intervals or as events dictate to review any emerging safety data. If serious adverse reactions as highlighted do occur, then the UFHCC DISC will be consult ed with respect to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_785887].  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_785888]- stage design as described 
in section 11.1. An interim analysis will be conducted when [ADDRESS_1080981] will be discontinued from protocol therapy under the following circumstances:  
• Any adverse  event which, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], requires termination of 
the study medication.  
• Substantial non- compliance with the requirements of the  study. 
• The subject  presents with a beta-HCG test consistent  with pregnancy. 
Pregnancy will be reported along the same timelines as a serious adverse event.  
• The subject uses illicit drugs or other substances that may, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2818], have a reasonable chance of contributing 
to toxicity or otherwise interfering with results.  
• The development of a  second malignancy that requires treatment, which would 
interfere with this study.  
• The subject is lost to follow -up. 
• Development of an intercurrent illness or situation which would, in the 
judgment of the investigator, affect assessments of clinical status and the study 
endpoint to a significant degree.  
The Investigator will make every reasonable effort to keep each subject in the study unless it is in the subject’s best interests to discontinue participation. A description of the reason(s) for withdrawal f rom the study must be recorded on the case report form 
(CRF).  
 
Relevant visit data should be entered on the CRF and any unused study medication will be accounted for and returned for all subjects participating in the study, even for a brief period of time. Subjects who discontinue following entry will have relevant information 
completed and recorded on the CRF. All subjects who discontinue because of adverse 
events or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities should be followed up until they recover or stabilize, and the subsequent outcome will be recorded. If any subject should die during the trial or within [ADDRESS_1080982] wishes to discontinue participation in the protocol, but is not 
discontinued for toxicity or any of the reasons listed in section 8.2.

known or suspected bladder perforation. 
 
9.1.7 Adverse Event  Profile  
Common side effects of intravesicular treatment with mitomycin C can include bladder 
irritation/inflammation, dysuria, fever, flu -like symptoms, skin rash, malaise, 
hematuria, urinary incontinence, urinary frequency, urine discoloration, and urinary urgency.  
Bladder fibrosis and contraction has also been reported following intravesicular treatment with mitomycin C, which in rare cases  has required cystectomy. Potential complications 
that could result from intravesicular treatment with mitomycin C can include urinary tract infection, fever > 101.3  
°F (> 38.5 °C), epi[INVESTIGATOR_95541], orchitis, abscess formation, hematuria with clot retention, myelosuppression, neutropenia, ureteral obstruction, pneumonitis, and hepatitis. 
 
10. ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
10.1 Definitions  
 
10.1.1  Adverse  Event  
The term “adverse event” (AE) includes any sign, symptom, syndrome, or illness that appears or worsens in a subject during the period of observation in the clinical study and that may impair the wellbeing of the subject. The term also covers laboratory findings or 
results of other diagnostic procedures that are considered to be clinically significant (e.g., that requires unschedul ed diagnostic procedures or treatment measures, or result in 
withdrawal from the study). An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended symptom or disease temporally associated with the administration of an investigational product, whether or not relate d to that investigational product.  
The adverse event may be:  
• A new illness/condition;  
• Worsening of a sign or symptom of the condition under 
treatment, or of  a concomitant  illness/condition;  
• An effect of the study drug;  or 
• A combination of 2 or more of thes e factors.  
No causal relationship with the study drug or with the clinical study itself is implied by [CONTACT_3794] “adverse event.”  
UF-GU-[ADDRESS_1080984] the information in the site’s source documents. AEs will be recorded in the subject CRF. AEs will be described by [CONTACT_24109] (start and stop dates and times), severity, outcome, treatment and relation to study drug, or if unrelated, the cause.  
 
Surgical procedures themselves are not adverse events; they are therapeutic measures for conditions that require surgery. The condition(s) for which the surgery is required may 
be an adverse event. Planned surgical measures permitted by [CONTACT_785898](s) leading to these measures are not adverse events.  
 
When a clear diagnosis is available that explains the abnormal objective findings, this 
diagnosis will be recorded as an adverse event and not the abnormal objective findings (e.g., viral hepatitis will be recorded as the adverse event and not the transaminase 
elevation). If a definitive diagnosis is not available, then the sign(s) ( e.g., clinically 
significant elevation of transaminase levels) or symptom(s) ( e.g., abdominal pain) will 
be recorded as the adverse event.  
Adverse events fall into the categories “serious” and “non -serious.”  
 
10.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
 
A serious adverse event is one that at any dose of the study drug or at any time during 
the period of observation:  
• Results in  death  
• Is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more  severe)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785889] (see note below for  exceptions)  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
• Is an important medical event, defined as a medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based 
on appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention (e.g., medical, surgical) to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above. Examples of such events include but are not limited to intensive treatment in an emergency department or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. “Medically important” 
should be marked only if no other serious criteria are  met. 
 
An “unexpected SAE” is any SAE for which the nature, specificity or severity is not consistent with the currently known adverse event profile of the investigational agent(s).  
 
NOTE: The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785890]:  
UF-GU-001 2020 -09-17 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 23 of 38  Version 7 .1  
 • a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34235] 24 hours that does not result in admission (unles s considered an 
“important  medical event” or  a life-threatening event)  
• elective surgery planned before signing consent  
• admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical  procedure  
• routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending 
of health status (e.g., routine  colonoscopy)  
• medical/surgical admission for purpose other than remedying ill health state that was planned before study entry. Appropriate documentation is required in these  cases.  
• admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries 
no bearing on health status and requires no medical/surgical 
intervention (e.g., lack of housing, economic inadequacy, caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative).  
 
Clarification of the difference in meaning between “ severe” and “serious”  
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively  minor medical significance (such as severe headache). Any grade ≥ 3 
adverse events  per CTCAE  are generally considered severe AE s. 
 
This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on the outcome or action criteria 
usually associated with events that pose a threat to life or functioning. Serious ness 
(not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_1080985]’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs must be collected, including those thought to be associated with protocol -specified procedures. 
Collection of all SAEs must continue until the postoperative clinic visit which will occur within [ADDRESS_1080986] be collected that relate to any later protocol-  specified procedure (e.g., a follow -up skin 
biopsy). The investigator should notify the DISC of any SAE occurring after this ti me 
period that is believed to be related to the investigational product or protocol -specified 
procedure.  
The investigator will begin collecting non- serious adverse event (NSAE) information 
once administration of the investigational product is initiated. This NSAE information should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead -in period or other observational 
period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects. Treated subjects, including those who were prematurely discontinued from the study, will be followed for any adverse events that occur during the study until [ADDRESS_1080987]’s case record  form.  Documentation must be 
supported by [CONTACT_36927]’s file. A laboratory test abnormality considered clinically 
relevant, e.g., causing the subject to withdraw from the study, requiring treatment or causing 
apparent clinical manifestations, or  judged relevant by [CONTACT_093], should be reported as an 
adverse event. Each event should be described in detail along with start and stop dates, severity, 
relationship to investigational product, action taken and outcome.
 
 
Every attempt should be made to describe the adverse event in terms of a diagnosis that 
encompasses the component signs and symptoms. If only nonspecific signs or symptoms are present, then these should be recorded as separate diagnoses on the pages of the case report form.  
 
 All subjects who have adverse events, whether considered associated with the use of study 
drug or not, must be monitored to determine the outcome. The clinical course of the adverse event will be followed according to accepted standards of medical practice, even after the end of the period of observation, until a satisfactory explanation is found or the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_592577] -up. Should the 
adverse event result i n death, a full pathologist’s report should be supplied, if possible. 
 
10.3.1 Assessment of Causal Relationship of Study  Drug  
The Investigator will provide an assessment of the potential causal relationship between adverse events and study medication by [CONTACT_698269] a reasonable possibility that the event was caused by [CONTACT_7860]. The relationship or association of the adverse event to the study medication will be characterized as not related, probably not related, possibl y related, probably related, or related:  
 
Not Related: There is not a temporal relationship to the study drug administration or 
the adverse event is clearly due only to the progression of the underlying disease state, 
intercurrent illness, concomitant medication, concurrent therapy, or other known 
cause.  
 
Probably Not Related: There is little or no chance that the study drug administration 
caused the adverse event; the event is most likely due to another competing cause, including intercurrent illness, disease progression, or expression of the disease state, or 
a reaction to a concomitant medication or concurrent therapy appearing to explain the reported adverse event.  
 
Possibly Related: The association of the adverse event with the study drug administra tion is unknown; however, the adverse event is not reasonably attributed 
UF-GU-001 2020 -09-17 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 38  Version 7 .1  
 to any other condition.  
 
Probably Related: When a reasonable temporal relationship exists between the 
adverse event and the study drug administration; significant symptoms abate upon discontinuation of the study drug and there is a reasonable explanation based on known characteristics of the study drug and there is no clear association with preexisting disease or therapy, intercurrent illness, concurrent therapy or other factor(s).  
 
Related: When the adverse event is a known side effect of the study drug or there is a 
temporal relationship to the administration of the study drug; or the adverse event reappears upon re - administration of the study drug (rechallenge); or the significant 
symptoms of the adverse event  
abate upon discontinuation of the study drug (dechallenge).  
 
10.3.2 Intensity of Adverse  Events  
The intensity of adverse changes in physical signs or symptoms will be graded according to the CTCAE version 4. For all other adverse events not described in the CTCAE, the intensity will be assessed by [CONTACT_646152]:  
 
Mild (Grade 1) – transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical intervention/therapy required.  
 
Moderate (Grade 2) – mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may 
be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required. 
 
Severe (Grade 3) – marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785891].  
Life-threatening (Grade 4) – extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance 
required; significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27595].  
 
Death (Grade 5) – the event resulted in death.  
 
10.3.3 Action Taken with Study  Drug  
 
The action the Investigator took with study drug as a result of the event should be 
recorded as one of the following:  
 
None – No action was taken with regard to the study drug as a result of the adverse event.  
Interrupted – Study drug was stopped due to the adverse event, but was later 
resumed at the same dose.  
Dose decreased – The dose of study drug was decreased as a result of the adverse event.  
Permanently discontinued – The subject was withdrawn from the study due to the adverse event.  
UF-GU-001 2020 -09-17 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26 of 38  Version 7 .1  
  
Only one item should be chosen. If multiple actions apply, the following “worst case” 
scenario hierarchy should be used to determine the preferred entry: Discontinued > dose decreased > therapy interrupted.  
 
10.3.4 Definition of  Outcome  
The outcome of the AE should be recorded as one of the following:  
 
Resolved without sequelae – The subject fully recovered from the adverse event with no observable residual effects.  
Resolved with sequelae – The subject recovered from the adverse event with 
observable residual effects.  
Not resolved – The adverse event was present at the time of last observation.  
Death – The subject died as a result of the adverse event.  
 
10.4 Immediately Reportable  Events  
 
10.4.1 Serious Adverse Events  
The UFHCC Protocol Management Office (PMO) must be notified of the SAE within 24 hours of knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_25541] [EMAIL_13339] .
 
Serious adverse events (SAE's) must be documented on an FDA MedWatch 3500A form.  
In addition to completing appropriate subject demographic and suspect medication information, the report should include the following information within the Event Description of the MedWatch 3500A form:  
 
• Treatment regimen (dosing frequency, combination therapy)  
• Protocol description (and number, if  assigned)  
• Description of event, severity, treatment, and outcome, if  known 
• Supportive laboratory results and  diagnostics  
• Investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the 
adverse event to  each investigational product and 
suspect medication  
 
The MedWatch form must be emailed to the UFHCC Project Management Office 
(PMO; [EMAIL_13338]) and PMO will submit this form to the UFHCC DISC 
Safety Team within [ADDRESS_1080988] be kept within the Trial Master 
File at the study site. The site investigator is responsible for informing the IRB and/or the Regulatory Authority of the SAE as per local requirements.  
 
Follow -up information will be emailed or faxed to the UFHCC PMO using an FDA 
MedWatch 3500A form stating that this is a follow -up to the previously reported SAE 
and giving the date of the original report. Each re -occurrence, complication, or 
progression of the original event should be reporte d as a follow -up to that event 
regardless of when it occurs. The follow -up information should describe whether the 
UF-GU-001 2020 -09-17 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 38  Version 7 .1  
 event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, whether the blind was broken 
or not (if applicable), and whether the participant continued or withdrew from study participation.  
 
10.4.[ADDRESS_1080989] be followed to outcome.  
 
Although overdose (dose variance of 10 % ) and cancer are not always serious by 
[CONTACT_8661], these events should also be reported to the DISC in an expedited 
manner. In case the overdose did not result in any adverse event, the Investigator 
should report this as “overdose, no adverse event” on the SAE form and provide the 
intended amount, as well as the actual amount, of drug administered. In the event of 
overdose or exaggerated response, appropriate supportive  measures should be 
employed. Actual treatment should depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the judgment and experience of the treating physician.  
Pregnancies and overdoses should be documented and reported per the SAE reporting 
guidelines in section 10.4.1 above. 
 
10.5 IND Safety Reports Unrelated to this  Trial  
IND safety reports not occurring on this trial but involving the study intervention 
(outside SAEs) received from outside sources will be submitted to the Institutional Review Board per their guidelines.  
11. STATISTICAL  METHODS  
 
The sections below provide an overview of the statistical considerations and analyses.  
 
11.1  Sample Size  Determination  
 
The primary endpoint for this study is bladder tumor recurrence (BTR) rate at [ADDRESS_1080990] - 
surgery. In our previous study, there was a 16% recurrence rate for those that received 
mitomycin C on day 0 and a 33% recurrence rate for those receiving it on day 1 or later. 
From this, we will assume that the underlying proportion of BTR at 1 year is 25% for our  
population. A sample size of [ADDRESS_1080991] the decrease of 1 -year BTR 
rate from 25% to 12.5% based on Simon optimal two- stage design. A sample size of 53 
will allow more than 80% power with one -sided type [ADDRESS_1080992] of binomial proportion will be used to assess the 
primary endpoint, 1- year BTR rates, with level of significance set at 0.10. The 
proportion with BTR will be estimated, along with a 90% confidence interval.  
 
11.3Analysis of Secondary Endpoint  
Time to BTR will be characterized using Kaplan -Meier plots. Log rank tests and Cox 
proport ional hazard modeling will be used to examine the impact of baseline 
characteristics. A p -value of less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.  
 
12. DATA AND SAFETY  MONITORING  
 
12.1   Data Integrity and Safety  Committee  
 
This protocol will be reviewed and monitored by [CONTACT_785899] (UFHCC) DISC in accordance with their policies and procedures. They will review and monitor study progress, toxicity, safety and other data from this trial. Questions about subject sa fety or protocol performance will be addressed with the 
sponsor -investigator, statistician, and study team members. Should any major concerns 
arise; the DISC will offer recommendations regarding whether or not to suspend the trial.

UroVysion Testing (if indicated)[ADDRESS_1081003] be monitored for bladder tumor recurrence every three months (± 3 weeks) for the first two years post - 
operatively. Subjects will then have a follow -up visit every six months (+/ - 3 weeks) for the third year post- operatively to assess for 
bladder tumor  recurrence.   Follow up visits will discontinue upon confirmation of bladder tumor recurrence.  
[ADDRESS_1081004].  
3 Complete  blood count (CBC)  is to include  red blood cell count  (RBC), white  blood cell count  (WBC),  platelets,  hemoglobin,  and 
hematocrit will be completed as described in section 6.1. 
4 Basic  metabolic  panel  is to include  sodium,  potassium,  chloride,  bicarbonate,  blood urea nitrogen  (BUN),  creatinine,  and glucose 
will be completed as described in section  6.1. 
5 Mitomycin C is to be administered as described in section  7.1. 
6 UroVysion will be performed if urine cytology result is atypi[INVESTIGATOR_785893] , 
7 A bladder biopsy will be required only if  bladder tumor recurrence is suspected based upon cystoscopy or urine testing findings for 
histologic confirmation of  recurrence.  
8 Urine pregnancy testing will be completed on the day of the nephroureterectomy prior to the  nephroureterectomy.  
9 Adverse event assessment will be as described in section 10

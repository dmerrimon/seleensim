 CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Introduction  
 Photorefractive Keratectomy (PRK) is a well -studied, FDA approved, 
refractive surgery option for many patients. Post -operatively patients are 
commonly treated with antibiotic drops for infection prophylaxis, steroid drops 
for inflammation and corneal haze prevention, and finally NSAIDs (non -
steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs) for pain management. Although the types 
of medications are standardized, there are many different protocols that vary 
based on surgeon and practice preference.  
 Post-operative drop reg imens frequently induce both concerns and 
questions for patients undergoing ocular surgery. Poor compliance with post -
operative medications can  lead to unexpected and or unsatisfactory  outcomes.   
With refractive surgery visual outcomes and safety at such a  high level, patient 
satisfaction and experience can be altered by [CONTACT_447] -operative convenience.  
 Dextenza (dexamethasone 0 .4mg ophthalmic insert) is a steroid eluting 
intracanalicular plug approved on -label for the treatment of pain and post -
operative infl ammation in patients who’ve undergone ocular surgery. Utilizing 
Dextenza , in place of ophthalmic steroid drops , will provide patients with a 
lessened number of post -operative drops  which decreases both contamination 
possibilities  and improper drug installa tion. Dextenza’s hydrogel technology is 
proposed to offer patients a gradual sustained delivery of steroid to the ocular 
surface which may decrease subjective post -operative pain.   
 The tear film is a key component in corneal  epi[INVESTIGATOR_455302]. In many studies, inflammation and inflammation 
markers are a driver to decreasing tear film homeostasis . With an 
intracanalicular steroid plug there is potential benefit to restoring tear film 
homeostasis sooner, combined with i ncreased tear volume, leading to improved 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_455303].  Finally , intracanalicular steroid 
plugs offer patients a preservative free steroid option to further promote 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_455304].  
 
1.2 Ration ale 
 DEXTENZA  (dexamethasone 0.4mg ophthalmic insert) has increasing 
research and evidence for post -cataract surgery patients, but a gap remains in 
many other ophthalmic surgeries.  Refractive surgery, similar to cataract 
surgery, has post -operative visual acuity as a major determinant of surgery 
success. Dextenza’s ability to treat post -operative inflammation while also 
increasing remaining tear volume by [CONTACT_455314] -operative drop 
inconvenience.

5.2.3  Adverse Event Information Collection  
The investigator (or designee) will record all AEs that occur during the study

severity and relationship to treatment are provided in Section 6.

6.[ADDRESS_582023] a causal relationship with the study drug.  
Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease which is temporally 
associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to 
the study drug.   
 
An AE also includes any worsening (i.e. any clinically significant change in 
frequency and/or intensity) of a pre -existing condition that is temporally 
associated with the use of the study drug.  
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_582024] medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be 
completely unrelated to study drug (e.g. a car accident in which a patient  
is a passenger).  
• Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the patient  is at 
immediate risk of death at the time of the event.  This does not include an 
AE that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_455312].  In -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24927] a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28682] 24 hours.  Prolongation of 
existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31561] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_455313], or is prolonged due to the 
development of a new AE as determined by [CONTACT_28807].  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial 
disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions) . 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event – Important medical events may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may 
jeopardize the patient  or may require intervention to prevent 1 of the 
other serious outcomes listed above (e.g., intensive treatment in an

convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse).  Any malignancy  (other than basal cell skin 
cancers) would be considered a medically important event.  
 
6.2 Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
All AEs and SAEs will be recorded only if they are medically relevant.  
 
All SAEs, regardless of assessment of causal relationship  to study insert will 
be reported to Ocular Therapeutix.  
To report an SAE, Ocular Therapeutix  will be contact[CONTACT_455320]:

The investigator will promptly report to the IRB all unanticipated problems

related to the use of the study insert.  All SAEs will be reported to the IRB, 
regardless of assessed causality.

8.[ADDRESS_582026] the right to review and comment on the 
informed consent form.  
 
It is the responsibility of the investigator or designee (if acceptable by [CONTACT_13125]) to obtain written informed consent from each patient  prior to 
his/her participation i n the study and after the aims, methods, objectives, and

that he/she can understand.  The ICF will be signed and dated by [CONTACT_455321] .   
 
Patients  who can write but cannot read will have the ICF read to them before 
signing and dating the ICF.  
Patients  who can understand but who can neither write nor read will have 
the ICF read to them in presence of an impartial witness, who will sign and 
date the ICF to confirm that informed consent was given.  
 
The original ICF will be retained by [CONTACT_31616] ’s 
study record, and a copy of the signed ICF will be given to the patient . 
 
If new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/benefit 
assessment, the ICF will be reviewed and updated appropriately.  All study 
patient s will be informed of the new information and provide their written 
consent if they wish to continu e in the study.  The original signed revised ICF 
will be maintained in the patient ’s study record and a copy will be given to 
the patient . 
 
8.3 Patient  Confidentiality and Data Protection  
The investigator will take all appropriate measures to ensure that the 
anonymity of each study patient  will be maintained.   
 
The patient ’s and investigator’s personal data will be treated in compliance 
with all applicable laws and regulations.   
 
8.[ADDRESS_582028]  
An appropriately constituted IRB, as described in ICH Guidelines for GCP, 
will review and approve:  
• The protocol, ICF, and any other materials to be provided to the patient s 
(e.g. advertising) before any patient  may be enrolled in the study  
• Any amendment or modification to the study protocol or ICF before 
implementation, unless the change is necessary to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to the patient s, in which case the IRB will be informed 
as soon as possible  
 
Ongoing studies will be reviewed by [CONTACT_1201]/EC on an annual basis or at 
intervals appropriate to the degree of risk.  
 
In addition, the IRB will be informed of any event likely to affect the safety of 
patient s or the continued conduct of the clinical study.

Protocol Version Date:     v10.0 3.1.2024      mitigate symptoms and improve function in persons living with HIV-related distal sensory 
neuropathy (DSP).
A.  Objectives 
Aim 1. Determine if the presence of painful distal sensory polyneuropathy in the feet adversely 
affects function (gait and physical performance), physical activity, and pain pressure threshold in 
persons living with HIV (PLHIV).  (From this point forward, protocol related to Aim 1 will be 
referred to as “cross-sectional phase”)
Aim 2. Determine the feasibility and effects of (1) mindfulness meditation or (2) transcutaneous 
nerve stimulation (TENS) on clinical and functional outcomes in persons with HIV-associated 
painful distal sensory polyneuropathy in the feet.  (From this point forward, protocol related to Aim 
1 will be referred to as “interventional phase”) 
.
B.  Hypotheses / Research Question(s)
Hypothesis for Aim 1 (cross-sectional phase): Temporal and spatial characteristics of gait, 
walking endurance, physical performance scores and pain pressure threshold scores will be 
worse, and physical activity will be lower, in those with DSP than in those without DSP.
Hypothesis for Aim 2 (interventional phase): There will be a beneficial effect on all clinical and 
functional outcomes in each of the 2 intervention groups (mindfulness meditation; TENS) 
compared to a standard care group.   
1.2 Research Significance
       Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) has increased longevity of PLHIV. However, comorbidities and disability 
may emerge over time.1-3 Chronic pain is common, with prevalence of 39-85%.4-10 Chronic pain in PLHIV 
has a multifactorial etiology.11,12 It is associated with increased odds of impaired mobility, self-care, usual 
activities, and disability.13-16 In middle aged and older PLHIV, pain is associated with frailty.17,18
       Distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSP) is a common neurological complication of HIV disease, with 
prevalence exceeding 40%.19-21 The etiology is related to HIV-infection, associated metabolic changes, 
mitochondrial dysfunction, and neurotoxic effects of ART.20,22-24 Risk factors include older age, lower CD4 
nadir, and exposure to certain antiretroviral drugs.20,25-27 Symptoms include impaired sensation, 
paresthesia, diminished reflexes, and pain. In PLHIV and DSP, the prevalence of chronic neuropathic 
pain is 54-78%.25,28-[ADDRESS_1242037] explored yoga, electrical stimulation, or a 
combination of manual therapy, electrical stimulation, stretching, and self-management.42-45 
       Mindfulness meditation has been used to reduce stress and symptoms in people with chronic 
diseases, including HIV.46 The practice involves bringing one’s attention to experiences in the present 
moment.47 Mindfulness has been shown to reduce ART side-effects, enhance quality of life, improve 
emotional status, and improve CD4 cell count in PLHIV.48-51 It has not been specifically studied for 
management of chronic pain in PLHIV and DSP.  
       Conventional TENS involves low-voltage current applied to the skin  for pain relief.52  High frequency 
TENS is recommended for patients who are taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_22388].53 TENS has been widely 
studied in patients with chronic pain, although its effectiveness remains uncertain.54,55 In patients with

PI: [INVESTIGATOR_650295]: Neuropathy Walks
Protocol Version Date:     v10.[ADDRESS_1242038] reported that TENS is effective for reduction in neuropathic 
symptoms.56 Other than a double case study using micro-current TENS (a specific form that is not widely 
used)43, TENS has not been studied in PLHIV and DSP.  
       DSP is associated with a wide array of impairments and limitations in PLHIV, but the study of non-
pharmaceutical intervention strategies has been sparse.  Mindfulness mediation and conventional TENS 
have not been studied in this population. Current gaps in knowledge include quantification of whether 
DSP in PLHIV adversely affects gait, balance, physical performance, and physical activity, and 
identification of interventions to improve clinical outcomes.   
1.3 Research Design and Methods
This study will include a cross-sectional phase for Aim 1, and an interventional phase with 3 arms for Aim 
2.  All enrolled participants (those with DSP and those without DSP) will be involved with the cross-sectional 
phase for Aim 1.  Only participants with DSP and foot pain will continue on into the interventional phase for 
Aim 2. Data will be collected via an array of non-invasive tests and questionnaires that will be administered 
a members of the study team. All data except for gait and walking endurance will be collected in a private 
room. Gait and walking endurance measurements will be conducted in a room of adequate size for this, or 
in a nearby [CONTACT_650320].

Procedures to monitor subjects for safety and minimize risk of harm during testing: Study 
staff will follow CDC and Rutgers COVID precautions that are in place at the time (such as 
wearing a face mask and a face shield) throughout the testing session.  Study staff will wash their 
hands before and after a testing session and sanitize their hands frequently throughout a testing 
session. All equipment including pens or iPads used for questionnaires will be disinfected both 
prior to and immediately following a testing session for a given participant. Participants will be 
scheduled one at a time with no overlap. If more than one participant is scheduled on the same 
day, there will be a full hour gap between participants to allow time for disinfection of all testing 
equipment. Participants’ appointments will be postponed if they are experiencing symptoms of 
COVID-19 or are febrile or had a high risk exposure to a COVID infected individual during the 
week prior to their testing appointment. This will be determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_650298].  Prior to testing procedures, 
participants’ resting heart rate, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_650299]. If 
vital signs values or temperature are outside of acceptable ranges, testing will not proceed on 
that date. All participants will be required to follow COVID precautions that are in place at the time 
of testing throughout the testing session. Currently, this includes participants wearing masks 
throughout the session, sanitizing their hands with hand sanitizer prior to the start of testing and 
prior to leaving the testing session, and maintaining social distance of at least 6’ between study 
team personnel and participants will be maintained except for when testing procedures require 
closer proximity. All participants will be guided by [CONTACT_650323] a study team member 
throughout all testing procedures. During the balance tests that are included the Short Physical 
Performance Battery, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_650300] a loss of balance. The other 
test that will require proximity of less than 6’ is pain pressure threshold testing. After each test, 
participants will be asked if they would like to sit and rest before continuing on to the next test. If 
participants appear to be in any distress or become lightheaded during testing, they will be given 
the option of lying down on a treatment table or sitting in a chair, and their vital signs will be 
reassessed. 
Procedures to monitor subjects for safety and minimize risk of harm during the period of 
home-based interventions: Participants in the interventional phase will be notified on baseline 
testing day that they should contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_650301] 6 week at-home

assessed (on the day of baseline testing) by [CONTACT_650324] a 5.07 gauge (10 gram) Semmes-Weinstein monofilament. Participants in the 
TENS group who do not have protective sensation over the TENS sites in the legs will NOT be 
provided with TENS treatment. In addition, participants will be contact[CONTACT_242464] a week by [CONTACT_650325]-based interventions.  
Randomization: The cross-sectional phase does not require randomization. For the 
interventional phase, participants with DSP will be randomly assigned to either the TENS group 
or the MM group or the standard care group (SC) using a web-based random number generator 
(https://www.randomizer.org/) that will link a group code (TENS, MM, or SC) to a participant’s 
study ID number. Once a participant has been randomized to a group, the matching of the 
participant’s ID number and assigned group will be delivered a study team member in a sealed 
opaque envelope. 
B. Data Points
Data elements include an array of non-invasive physical performance tests, physical activity 
monitoring, pain pressure threshold testing, and questionnaires.   See Section 1.6 B. for detail on 
dependent variables/outcome measures.
The data elements will be collected at baseline (Week 0) for all participants.  
At Week 0, all participants complete a demographic and health questionnaire and  a physical 
activity questionnaire, the Brief Pain Inventory,  and will undergo testing related to gait, walking 
endurance, physical performance, and pain-pressure threshold. They will receive a physical 
activity monitor that they will be asked to wear for [ADDRESS_1242040] emerged; 
participants in the standard care group will receive a weekly text message to ask if any problems 
have emerged. All participants in the interventional phase will return for follow up testing after 6 
weeks of intervention (Week 7), at which time all measurements taken at Week 0 will be 
repeated.   In addition, participants will complete a satisfaction questionnaire at Week 7. They will 
once again receive a physical activity monitor that they will be asked to wear for 5 days and then 
ship back to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a pre-paid shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3858]. In addition, those who were randomized to the 
TENS or MM groups starting in March 2024 will complete a short follow up questionnaire at Week 
15. 
C. Study Duration
72-80 participants will be seen one time for testing, followed by 5 days of physical activity 
monitoring for the cross-sectional phase.  
The 36-40 participants without DSP will be engage for approximately one week (baseline testing 
followed by 5 days of activity monitoring). 
The 36-40 participants with DSP-related pain will continue with the interventional phase for 6 
weeks (home-based treatment or usual care/control) then return for post-intervention testing at 
week 7, followed by 5 days of activity monitoring. At week 15, those who were randomized to the

PI: [INVESTIGATOR_650295]: Neuropathy Walks
Protocol Version Date:     v10.0 3.1.2024      TENS or MM groups will receive a short follow-up questionnaire via email/RedCap. Overall, those 
with DSP (interventional phase) will be participating for approximately 8 weeks if in the Usual 
Care Group, or 15 weeks if in the TENS or MM groups (to account for the follow up 
questionnaire). 
The overall duration of the study is expected to be [ADDRESS_1242041] dates and times.  
D. Endpoints
Study end point for those participants without DSP (cross-sectional phase only) will be 5 days 
after the date of a participant’s on-site baseline testing. (Following on-site baseline testing, they 
will continue to wear an activity monitor for 5 days). Study end point for those participants with 
DSP and randomized to the Usual Care group will be approximately [ADDRESS_1242042] so that study staff can reassess their vital 
signs and determine if the participant can continue if they choose to do so. Testing procedures 
will cease if a participant falls or sustains any form of injury during the testing. 
Although the interventions (TENS, mindfulness meditation) pose negligible risk, if a participant 
experiences a serious adverse event, that participant will be withdrawn from the study. Any 
adverse events will be reported to the IRB.  Furthermore, participants can elect to withdraw 
themselves from the study at any time. 
1.4 Preliminary Data
There is no preliminary data; this is a new study. This interventional phase of this study will be used to 
generate data on the feasibility and effect sizes of the interventions that will be used for future projects. 
1.5 Sample Size Justification
A sample of 80 participants will be enrolled in the cross sectional phase and 40 participants (those 
with DSP) will continue on to the interventional phase. 
The target sample size of 72 (36 with DSP and 36 without DSP) for the cross sectional phase is 
adequate to explore of between group differences in gait, physical performance, physical activity, and 
pain pressure threshold variables.  For the interventional phase, 36 participants (12 participants in 
each of the 3 groups) is adequate to demonstrate feasibility and determine effect sizes that can 
inform a future randomized controlled trial. The expected accrual rate is 90% (drop-out rate of <10%); 
thus, the number enrolled will be 80.

variables. 
The interventional phase will include 3 treatment groups: transcutaneous nerve stimulation 
(TENS), mindfulness meditation (MM), and a standard care group (SC). TENS and MM will 
involve commonly used standards and are not experimental.   
TENS: TENS settings (frequency, pulse width, and mode) will be set by [CONTACT_650326]. Participants in the TENS group will receive a new battery-
operated hand-held TENS300 device (TENSpros.com, St. Louis, MO), 6 sets of electrodes

Protocol Version Date:     v10.0 3.1.2024      (TENSpros.com, St. Louis, MO), six 9-volt batteries, and an instruction manual. After the 5th day 
of baseline physical activity monitoring, they will be provided with a link to a 10-minute 
instructional video. A dual channel setup will be utilized to deliver one channel to each lower 
extremity at sites proximal to the feet that have been determined to have protective sensation 
with at 5.07 gauge (10 gram) Semmes-Weinstein monofilament. Standard settings for chronic 
pain will be used.  Patients will be instructed in how to apply 2”X2” self-adhering electrodes to the 
designated points on the lower extremities, how to control the intensity, and how to change the 
battery if needed.  They will be advised to self-administer TENS once a day for [ADDRESS_1242044] the intensity of the TENS 
at the start of the session and again after 15 minutes, as follows: “Turn the intensity dial up to the 
point where the electrical stimulation feeling is unpleasant or painful, then immediately turn it 
down just slightly to just below that” and, “after [ADDRESS_1242045] slightly below that”. If participants lose or 
damage their TENS unit, it will promptly be replaced with a new unit.         
Mindfulness Meditation (MM):  After the 5th day of baseline physical activity monitoring, 
participants in the MM group will sent a link to view a 10-minute orientation video.. Participants in 
the MM group will be instructed to complete a 15-30-minute meditation every day. The 
meditations will be guided by [CONTACT_094]-recorded audios, with a different theme each week. Participants 
will receive a link to the pre-recorded audios by [CONTACT_200835]/or email.     
Standard care group:  Participants in the standard care group will be advised to continue with 
their current pain management strategies and continue to see any health care providers that they 
normally see.  Following 5 days of activity tracing (after their return for data collection at W7), 
TENS and MM will be offered to them at no cost. If they accept the offer of TENS, they will 
receive the same equipment and instruction that was provided to those in the TENS group. If they 
accept the offer of MM, they will be provided with links to the orientation video and the meditation 
audio recordings.

Protocol Version Date:     v10.0 3.1.2024      Timing and Frequency:   
Cross-sectional phase: All participants will be seen individually at Week 0 (baseline) for all 
variables included in the cross-sectional study. In addition, participants will wear an activity 
monitor for 5 days following the baseline session. 
Interventional phase. Participants who continue on into the interventional phase (those with 
DSP) will complete additional questionnaires at Week 0 and then will be seen again at Week 7 
(following 6 weeks of home-based intervention or usual care).  In addition, participants will 
wear an activity monitor for 5 days following the Week 7 session.
At Week 0, the expected time to complete all data collection for those participants without 
DSP is 45 minutes (gait and physical performance tests) and the expected time for those 
participants with DSP is 1.5 hours (45 minutes for gait and physical performance tests and 45 
minutes for questionnaires.) 
At Week 7, the expected time to complete all data collection is 1.5 hours (45 minutes for gait 
and physical performance tests and 45 minutes for questionnaires.) 
At week 15, participants who were randomized to the TENS and MM groups will receive a 
short follow-up questionnaire (5-10 minutes to complete)

A. Method to Identify Potential Subjects
Methods to identify potential participants will be flyers at 3 HIV treatment centers known to the PI 
(Kietrys) and co-investigators (Barberio, Swaminathan): Jefferson Health New Jersey (in 
Voorhees NJ, Sewell NJ, and Haddonfield NJ)  Peter Ho Memorial Clinic at St. Michaels Medical 
Center, [ADDRESS_1242069] at these sites. Medical staff at these facilities 
will be made aware of the study should they choose to share information about the study with 
their patients via flyers that are available at these facilities. The flyer for the study will be shared 
with HIV support groups and HIV organizations in NJ that are identified over the course of the 
study. 
In addition, the information about the study will be sent to HIV+ adults within a 25-mile radius of 
Newark NJ via ResearchMatch.org (RM).   A preliminary search on RM determined there are 70 
HIV+ adults within a 25-mile radius of Newark NJ who are registered with RM. 
Potential participants who express interest will be interviewed by [CONTACT_650329]. 
B. Recruitment Details

NJ,  Peter Ho Memorial Clinic at St. Michaels Medical Center in Newark NJ, and office of [CONTACT_650340], [ADDRESS_1242070] of flyer  that is made available to patients at these 
as well as other HIV treatment centers in NJ, Buddies of New Jersey, Hyacinth AIDS Foundation, 
and other HIV support groups and organizations in NJ that are identified over the course of the 
study.  
Information about the study will be sent to HIV+ adults within a 25-mile radius of Newark NJ via 
ResearchMatch.org (RM); as per the RM process, individuals who express interest will then 
receive an email from PI [INVESTIGATOR_650310] a phone call to go over screening questions and determine eligibility.

Protocol Version Date:     v10.[ADDRESS_1242071] Screening
Individuals will be screened for eligibility during a phone call or by [CONTACT_650331] (PI) or  Oonagh Breen (study staff). Screening will involve a series 
scripted questions pertaining to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Individuals will be advised upon 
conclusion of the call or ZOOM if they are eligible to participate in the study. 
Inclusion Criteria
The inclusion criteria for all participants will be:
diagnosis of HIV infection currently treated with ART
CD4 count of at least 200 cells/mm3
18-89 years old
able to read and write in English
means to travel to a study site.
Half of the sample (those continuing on to the interventional phase) will have painful DSP in the 
feet. To screen for DSP, potential participants will be asked if they have been diagnosed with DSP 
in their feet and the Single Question Neuropathy Screen57,58 (specifically for symptoms in the feet) 
will be administered. An affirmative response to either question will be used to classify them as 
having DSP.  For those with DSP, an additional inclusion criteria are:  
average daily self-reported pain in the feet of at least 3/10 on a 0-10 numerical pain 
scale
pain in the feet present for at least the past 3 months 
no changes in medications used to manage pain in the past 4 weeks
availability of a mobile phone to receive text messages over the course of the 
intervention period     
for interventional phase only: no use of TENS or mindfulness meditation in the prior 6 
months
Exclusion Criteria
Exclusion criteria include certain conditions as listed in the chart below. 
Exclusion Criterion Justification for Exclusion
current opportunistic infection(s) presence suggests that the patient is severely 
immunocompromised and in need of medical attention  
CD4 count <200 cells/mm3presence suggests that the patient is severely 
immunocompromised and in need of medical attention
dementia patient would be unable to successfully complete 
questionnaires
uncontrolled psychiatric disorder patient’s behaviors and responses to questionnaires may 
be altered or invalid
wounds or sores on the feet may not be safe for patient to participate with testing. 
wounds or sores may affect gait

Given the PI’s prior experience with recruitment of HIV+ participants for prior studies, coupled with 
access to 3 key HIV treatment centers, it is highly feasible that the target number of participants can 
be recruited by [CONTACT_11711] 2024. It is estimated that there are more than 37,000 PLHIV in New Jersey, 
and DSP is common co-morbidity in PLHIV (with prevalence exceeding 40%).  
4.4 Consent Procedures
A. Consent Process
Location of Consent Process
Consent will take place at either of the 4 study sites ([ADDRESS_1242073], Jefferson Hall #317, 
Blackwood, NJ or [ADDRESS_1242074] House in Newark NJ)  
Ongoing Consent
Not applicable. This is a relatively short-term study (total time involvement for those in the 
interventional phase is approximately 8 weeks).
Individual Roles for Researchers Involved in Consent
David Kietrys and  Oonagh Breen   will be involved with consent process. [CONTACT_650341] will offer 
to email the consent form to the potential participants prior to the date they are scheduled for 
baseline data collection if they wish to receive it by [CONTACT_650332].  Upon arrival on the date for consenting and baseline testing, Kietrys or 
Breen  will review the consent form and answer any questions. Signed consent forms will be 
scanned into a separate secure password protected folder on the university servers and 
accessible only to appropriate project team members, after which paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_650311].
Consent Discussion Duration
It is estimated that between 10 and 15 minutes will be devoted to consent discussion. More 
time (up to 30 minutes) can be allotted if needed.  
Coercion or Undue Influence
As part of the consent form and consent discussion, potential participants will be clearly 
advised (both in writing on the consent form and verbally during the discussion) that their 
participation is entirely voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time. 
Subject Understanding
The details of the study will be described to potential participants who are deemed eligible 
(based on the screening). Furthermore, the details of the study will be reviewed with the 
potential participants during the consenting discussion. Testing procedures will be 
summarized prior to the testing session. During tests, explicit and clear instructions regarding 
test procedures will be given. Those randomized to the TENS group will receive an 
instruction manual and a one-on-one ZOOM session to educate them on how to use TENS. 
For randomized to the mindfulness meditation group will watch a brief orientation video  , and 
then receive text messages with links to the audio files the will guide the meditation.  Those 
randomized to the standard care group will continue to see any health care providers that 
they normally see and continue to use any pain management strategies that they normally 
use.  In addition, they will be offered TENS and mindfulness meditation audios upon 
conclusion of study. At all points along the way, participants will be given the opportunity to 
ask any questions that they may have.

E. Minimizing Risks of Harm
Procedures to assure confidentiality of data: 
All data will ultimately be stored in a password protected folder on the university servers and 
accessible only to appropriate project team members. Data will be linked only to participant study 
ID#s, i.e. key codes. The de-identified data file will be shared with [CONTACT_650342] (co-
investigator and statistician) and other co-investigators as needed for purposes of analysis. A 
separate secure spreadsheet that links participant ID#s to their names will be kept on a separate 
password protected folder on a university server available only to Kietrys (PI) and Barberio (co-
investigator) and will be accessed only if the code needs to be broken in order to contact a 
participant based on any measurements or questionnaire responses that suggest need for a 
referral for medical attention or counseling. Signed consent forms will be scanned into a separate

data collection (Ferraro, Lynch,  Breen) will be trained by [CONTACT_976] (Kietrys) in all security protocols. 
Data will be entered into the RedCap platform and RedCap via survey links that are created for 
this study, and will later transferred to in a password protected folder on the university servers 
and accessible only to appropriate project team members. 
ZENO walkway data will be stored and processed on a password protected laptop dedicated to 
the ZENO walkway. The laptop with ZENO walkway data will be continuously within the line of 
sight of Kietrys or Ferraro during data collection and securely stored during transport between 
data collection locations. ZENO walkway data will be transferred from the dedicated laptop to a 
secure password protected folder on the university servers. After processing ZENO walkway data 
with PKMAS gait analysis software, the raw and aggregate ZENO walkway data will be 
uploaded into the RedCap project.   
Mid-thigh pull test data will be uploaded into the RedCap project. 
Actigraph data will be transferred from the Actigraph device to a password protected folder on the 
university servers, after which Actigraph devices will be wiped of participant data and disinfected 
prior to the device being used by a subsequent participant.  After processing Actigraph data with 
ActiLife software, the raw and aggregate Actigraph data will be uploaded into the RedCap project.
Text messages and responses to text messages about adherence to interventions (TENS and 
MM groups only during the 6 weeks of home-based treatment) will be done through a study-
specific password protected Twilio account, and then uploaded into the RedCap project.
Procedures to monitor subjects for safety and minimize risk of harm during testing: 
Study staff will follow CDC and Rutgers COVID precautions (such as wearing a face mask and a 
face shield) throughout the testing session.  Study staff will wash their hands before and after a 
testing session and sanitize their hands frequently throughout a testing session. All equipment 
including pens or iPads used for questionnaires will be disinfected both prior to and immediately 
following a testing session for a given participant. Participants will be scheduled one at a time 
with no overlap. If more than one participant is scheduled on the same day, there will be a full 
hour gap between participants to allow time for disinfection of all testing equipment. Participants’ 
appointments will be postponed if they are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 or are febrile or 
had a high risk exposure to a COVID infected individual during the week prior to their testing 
appointment. This will be determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_650315].  Prior to testing procedures, participants’ resting heart rate, 
blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_650299]. If vital signs values or temperature 
are outside of acceptable ranges, testing will not proceed on that date. All participants will be 
required to follow COVID precautions that are in place at the time testing throughout the testing 
session. Currently, this includes participants wearing masks throughout the session, sanitizing 
their hands with hand sanitizer prior to the start of testing and prior to leaving the testing session, 
and maintaining social distance of at least 6’ between study team personnel and participants will 
be maintained except for when testing procedures require closer proximity. All participants will be 
guided by [CONTACT_650323] a study team member throughout all testing procedures. During the 
balance tests that are included the Short Physical Performance Battery, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_650316] a loss of balance. The other test that will require proximity of less than 6’ 
is pain pressure threshold testing. After each test, participants will be asked if they would like to 
sit and rest before continuing on to the next test. If participants appear to be in any distress or 
become lightheaded during testing, they will be given the option of lying down on a treatment 
table or sitting in a chair, and their vital signs will be reassessed. 
Procedures to monitor subjects for safety and minimize risk of harm during the period of 
home-based interventions: Participants in the interventional phase will be notified on baseline 
testing day that they should contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_650301] [ADDRESS_1242080] been

F. Potential Benefits to Subjects
Participants in the interventional phase of the study may benefit as the use of TENS or 
mindfulness meditation and may experience improvements in a number of outcomes such as 
pain, quality of life, physical performance and physical activity. Furthermore, participants may 
become less reliant on pain medication, alcohol or substances for pain relief. The probability of 
such benefits is expected to be high in those in the TENS and meditation groups, with magnitude 
ranging from small improvements to large improvements that will vary by [CONTACT_29569]. The duration 
of such benefits may be prolonged if the participants continue with the use of TENS or meditation 
after the study concludes.

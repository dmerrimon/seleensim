2 SCHEMA  
 
This trial will evaluate the effectiveness of autologous alpha -type-1 polarized dendritic cell 
(DC1) vaccines (patients’ autologous DC1s loaded with autologous tumor material), 
combined with a systemic chemokine modulation regimen [CKM;  intravenous rintatolimod 
(TLR3 ligand, a derivative of Poly -I:C) + intravenous interferon -alpha + oral celecoxib ] as 
adjuvant therapy, after cytoreduct ive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal 
chemotherapy (HIPEC), in patients with peritoneal surface malignancies (PSM), including but 
not limited to malignant peritoneal mesothelioma and peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) of 
appendiceal and colorectal  origin.  
 
All patients judged to have peritoneal surface malignancy and considered able to be cytoreduced 
to Peritoneal Cancer Index (PCI) Completeness of Cytoreduction  (CC) score of 1 or less will 
undergo CRS + HIPEC. Postoperative immunotherapy will start upon recovery from surgery but 
no sooner than [ADDRESS_507632]  CRS + HIPEC.  
 
The Phase 2 i mmunotherapy regimen will include 1 priming dose of the DC1  vaccine  and 3 
booster dose s of the DC1  vaccine  combined with  CKM. Each dose  of vaccine, whether 
priming or booster, will include 1 intranodal (3M cells) and 1 intradermal (3M cells)  injection. 
Phase 1 includes only the priming vaccine dose and 1 cycle of a booster dose + CKM . 
 
Each  booster vaccine  dose ( booster cycles 1-3) will be  followed by 4 -days of systemic CKM  
which is comprised of  intravenous (IV) IFNα (dose-escalation  in Phase 1 only: 5-20 MU/m2) 
once a day for 4 days; IV rintatolimod (short -half-life TLR3 ligand ) 200 mg on Wednesday and 
Friday only of the CKM regimen ; and oral celecoxib 200 mg twice a day for all 5 days.  
 
In order to avoid overlap between  experimental  immunotherapy and potential adjuvant 
chemotherapy (which can be clinically indicated as a part of standard care in a subset of 
patients), the experimental treatment may be interrupted after each cycle  to allow  adjuvant 
chemotherapy  that may be done for each patient’s clinical care, not as part of this research study . 
If clinically indicated any cycle of adjuvant c hemotherapy may start  a minimum of 5 days after 
completion ) of a cycle  of immunotherapy  and recovery form any potential side effects. The 
following cycle of immunotherapy may start at least 5 days after the completion of  
chemotherapy  and after recovery fro m acute side effects of chemotherapy . 
 
Timing of the experimental treatment:  
• Priming cycle  (vaccine alone) : 6 to 16 weeks after surgery  (target: 8 weeks)  
• Booster cycle 1  (vaccine plus CKM) : 4 to 12 weeks after priming cycle  (target: 4 weeks)  
• Booster cycle 2 (vaccine plus CKM): : 4 to 12 weeks after booster cycle 1  (target: 4 
weeks)  
• Booster cycle 3  (vaccine plus CKM): : 4 to 12 weeks after booster cycle 2  (target: 4 
weeks)  
 
The primary endpoint will be time to tumor progression/recurrence on CT or MR imaging. 
Secondary endpoints will be immunologic response markers.

8 1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Primary Objectives  
 
Preliminary data from our laboratory indicate that autologous antigen -loaded DC1 vaccines 
induce highly -effective tumor -specific CD8+ CTLs that express defined chemokine receptors, 
CCR5 and CXCR3.1-[ADDRESS_507643] also demonstrated that IFN  and poly -I:C enhance local 
production of relevant chemokines CCL5/RANTES an d CXCL10/IP10 that are able to attract the 
CCR5 - and CXCR3 -expressing CTLs selectively to tumor lesions, rather than in marginal 
healthy tissues. Furthermore, the above factors suppress local production of undesirable 
chemokines (CCL22) that attract immuno suppressive T reg cells.[ADDRESS_507644] 
demonstrated a correlation between the density of infiltrating effector T cells and long -term 
outcomes in malignant peritoneal mesothelioma5,6 and colorectal cancer7,8. 
 
In this Phase 1/[ADDRESS_507645] the effectiveness of the treatment of patients with 
peritoneal surface malignancies, including but not limited to malignant peritoneal mesothelioma 
(MPM) and peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) from appendiceal and colorectal prim ary tumors, 
using autologous DC1 vaccines combined with a systemic chemokine modulation regimen, 
consisting of celecoxib, IFN  and TLR3 ligand as a component of adjuvant therapy. We 
anticipate that the resulting tumor -selective modulation of the peritone al chemokine environment 
will promote the entry of spontaneously -occurring and αDC1 -induced e ffector -type T ( eff) cells 
into tumor, and limit the influx of undesirable regulatory -type T ( reg) cells.  
 
Our primary objective is to test whether our combined im munotherapy regimen ( DC1 vaccines 
+ CKM) is safe and whether it can prolong time -to-progression (TTP) in patients with peritoneal 
surface malignancies after optimal CRS + HIPEC  with or without  adjuvant  chemotherapy . 
 
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
 
• To estimate overall survival (OS).  
• Perform c orrelative studies to characterize sequential immune response changes by 
[CONTACT_402679]. These results will be correlated with TTP, PFS, and OS  in attempt to predictive 
markers of the clinical benefit . 
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.[ADDRESS_507646] exclusively 
develops from the serosal lining of  the pleural (incidence ~ 2000 cases/y ear) or peritoneal 
cavities (incidence ~ 250 -500 cases per year).9 Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma is an 
aggressive loco -regionally invasive disease that rarely involves lymph nodes (5 -10%) or 
metastasizes extra -abdominally (3 -5%). Compressive symptom s occur due to progressive 
accumulation of tumor and ascites in the abdomen, which leads to organ -dysfunction, morbidity, 
and eventual mortality.10 Prognostic factors for improved overall and disease -free survival

9 include epi[INVESTIGATOR_279040], lack of lymph node disease, small nuclear size (I/II), adequate CRS 
(CC-0/CC -1), low mitotic  count ≤ 5 mitoses/50 HPF, age ≤ 60 years, female gender, prior 
surgical debulking, lack of deep tissue invasion, hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion 
(HIPEC), and early stage of disease (Stage I/II).11,[ADDRESS_507647] response rates of up to 40%, mortality risk reduc tion of 10% at 1 year and 
corresponding improvement in survival of 6 -8 weeks.13 Recent experience with aggressive 
cytoreductive surgery in combination with HIPEC has demonstrated median survival of 36 to 92 
months and 29% to 59% [ADDRESS_507648] 
anti-tumor immune responses survive longer. Increased CD8+ tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes 
(TILs) are associated with lower incidence/burden of mediastinal lymphadenopathy, higher 
numbers of apoptotic tumor cells in tumor tissue, as well as improved progression -free and 
overall survival after surgical resection, with or without neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This 
suggests that stimulation of CD8+ TILs is a potential therapeutic strategy. In fact , patients 
receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin/pemetrexed combination demonstrate higher 
CD8+ TILs than those receiving other chemotherapy regimens, lending credence to this being 
the most efficacious regimen in randomized trials.5,6 However, the immune cell population of 
mesothelioma strongly favors a suppressive environment, with heavy infiltration of 
CD4+CD25+Foxp3 regulatory T cells (T regs), and an absence of CD1α+ DCs, which might 
explain the lack of tumor kill despi[INVESTIGATOR_402650] T cells. This immunosuppres sive 
environment must be modulated to improve immunotherapeutic efficacy.[ADDRESS_507649] higher AB1 cell lysis 
(chromium release assay) and higher IFNγ production from splenocytes (ELISPOT assay), 
suggesting an overall increased CTL activity. Adoptiv e transfer of CD8+ T cells, isolated from 
splenocytes of immunized mice, into non -immunized AB1 tumor bearing mice improves 
survival.16 A small Phase 1 clinical trial (10 patients) in patients with mesothelioma was 
performed to assess toxicity  and feasibility of clinical grade DC vaccine immunotherapy and 
tumor response to immunotherapy. DCs were pulsed with autologous tumor lysate, matured ex -
vivo, and then administered intradermally and intravenously to select malignant pleural 
mesothelioma p atients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_402651] + cisplatin chemotherapy. DC immunotherapy was well tolerated and

10 appeared to elicit an immunologic response (positive DTH skin test, increased inflammato ry 
cells in skin biopsies at site of vaccination, increased antitumor T cells in blood) and some 
clinical response by [CONTACT_393] (of 10 patients, 6 had progression, 1 had stable and 3 had partial 
response), however no survival benefit was noted.17 Recent evidence indicates that 
chemotherapeutic agents can induce specific immune responses, thereby [CONTACT_402680]. Chemotherapy induced dead tumor cells may release “danger signals” that induce DC 
maturation with subsequent CTL activation. In a murine model of mesothelioma, gemcitabine 
has been shown to increase antigen presentation to CD8+ T cells. Vaccination of these tumor -
bearing mice following gemcitabine therapy resulted in a marked decrease in tumor growth and 
increase d survival compared with vaccination without gemcitabine.[ADDRESS_507650] been shown to increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to immune -
mediated attack.19 
 
2.2 Tumor Immunogenicity in Colorectal Adenocarcinoma with Peritoneal 
Carcinomatosis  
 
Cancer of the colon and rectum (colorec tal cancer) is the third leading site of cancer diagnosed 
annually in the [LOCATION_002] and the most common form of gastrointestinal malignancy. It 
accounts for approximately 150,000 new cases annually. Isolated peritoneal carcinomatosis in 
the setting of colorectal adenocarcinoma occurs synchronously in 8% and metachronously in 
25% of patients. Median survival without therapy is 6 months, while systemic chemotherapy 
improves median survival in unresectable patients to 12.6 months, with rare 5 year survivor s.20 
Aggressive CRS + PIC has demonstrated median survival of 30 -60 months and 20 -50% 5 year 
overall survival rates, with particular benefit seen in patients undergoing complete CRS (CC -
0/CC -1) for low volume disease (low peritoneal carcinomatosis index; PCI).21 
 
Signs of an immune response, including increased mRNA levels for products of TH1 effector 
cells, markers of T cell migration, activation and differentiation, and CD8+ T cell infiltration 
within colorectal cancers are associated with the absence of early metastasis; increased density o f 
CD45RO+ memory T cells and improved OS.8 Similarly, the type, location and density of TILs 
in colorectal cancer patients are strong predictors of survival. Co -expression of genes for 
cytotoxicity and TH1 adaptive immunity predicts patient survival independent of metastatic 
status.7 A meta -analysis of studies involving active specific immunotherapy (ASI) in patients 
with minimal residual colorectal cancer after R0 resection (6 stud ies, 1375 patients) and patients 
with advanced unresectable colorectal cancer (43 studies, 656 patients) was recently published. 
ASI included autologous tumor cell vaccines, defined tumor -protein vaccines, monoclonal 
antibodies, peptide vaccines, viral vec tor vaccines, DC vaccine and naked DNA vaccines. The 
authors demonstrated improved disease -free survival for stage II disease and improved disease -
free/overall survival for stage III disease in the setting of minimal residual colorectal cancer, 
while objec tive response rate (complete response + partial response; 1.6%) and clinical benefit 
rate (complete response + partial response + stable disease; 26%) were low in the setting of 
advanced unresectable colorectal cancer. They hypothesized that ASI may target  cancer stem 
cells or micrometastases that are responsible for cancer recurrence/metastasis and are resistant to 
conventional chemotherapy.22 Autologo us tumor lysate -pulsed DC vaccine administered 
intranodally to patients with colorectal metastasis after complete surgical resection induced 
tumor -specific T -cell proliferation or IFNγ secretory response in 63% of patients and a DTH 
response to autologous tumor cells in 61% of patients, with subsequent improved recurrence -free

oxaliplatin/capecitabine as adjuvant therapy in stage III colorectal cancer patients after complete 
resection demonstrated stable levels of peripheral blood mononuclear cells during chemotherapy, 
CEA -peptide -specific T -cell responses an d higher production of IFNγ and IL -2 upon co -culture 
with CEA -loaded target cells.24 In a Phase 1/2 tri al using DCs transfected with RNA encoding 
CEA to vaccinate patients after complete resection of colorectal liver metastasis, evidence of 
immune response in skin biopsies of DC injection sites and CEA -specific T -cell activity in 
peripheral blood was demons trated.25 
 
2.3 Tumor Immunogenicity in Appendiceal Adenocarcinoma with Peritoneal 
Carcinomatosis  
 
Appendiceal neoplasms are predominantly mucinous and frequently lead to peritoneal 
carcinomatosis. Classically, they are clinically characterized by [CONTACT_402682], intra -peritoneal 
dissemination of mucin, referred to as pseudomyxoma peritonei. These tumors comprise 1% of 
all colorectal cancers, with an annual incidence of [ADDRESS_507652] cons istently demonstrated incomplete cytoreductive 
surgery (CC -2/3) and non -DPAM histology to be the most consistent negative predictors of 
survival in patients undergoing CRS and PIC.27 This underscores the need for more effective 
targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], especially in patients with high -risk appendiceal cancers with peritoneal 
carcinomatosis/pseudomyxoma peritonei.  
 
Research related to the immunogenicity of these tumors and the application of imm unotherapy 
alone or in conjunction with systemic chemotherapy is lacking for this malignancy, but is 
expected to be similar to colorectal cancer, based on the tissue of tumor origin and similar 
location of the disease.

potent antigen presentin g cells (APCs), capable of efficiently internalizing and presenting 
antigen in the context of co -stimulatory signals and cytokines essential to the induction of 
effective long -lasting T -cell mediated immunity. Animal models have demonstrated that DCs, 
pulsed ex vivo with defined tumor antigens or material derived from tumor cells, can induce 
protective tumor -specific immune responses and are capable of mediating the regression of 
established disease.31 Human clinical trials, including our own, demonstrate that DCs pulsed

Version Date:  03-18-2016  
 
12 with defined tumor -relevant antigenic peptides, or, alternatively, with tumor cell lysates or 
apoptotic bodies, can induce tumor -specific immune responses and even occasional complete 
tumor regression in late stage cancer patients.29 
 
Several competing approaches to DC therapy are currently being evaluated in cl inical trials. In 
this context, two emerging issues appear to be critical for the development of “optimal” DC -
based immunization strategies. First, defining a strategy for the delivery of tumor antigens that 
facilitates efficient DC presentation of a broad  range of class I - and class II -restricted epi[INVESTIGATOR_402652] -specific T -cell immunity. Second, 
recent results suggest that in order to induce tumor regression and promote long -term disease -
free status, DC -based strategies need to drive in vivo expansion and maintenance of Th1/Tc1 -
type T cells (both CD8+ and CD4+) effector function.  
 
Human DCs may be readily obtained in large numbers from peripheral blood by [CONTACT_402683] i nterleukin -4 (IL -4) and granulocyte -macrophage colony 
stimulating factor (GM -CSF).[ADDRESS_507654] of 3 x 105, or 3 x 106 antigen -loaded DCs, and 
the remaining cells will be used for vaccine testing, quality control, immunomonitoring, and the 
development of in vitro correlates of the in vivo (immunologic and potentially therapeutic) 
efficacy of DC.  
 
2.5 Type -1 polarized DC ( DC1)  
 
Two functions of dendritic cells are  believed to be important for the ability of DCs to induce Th1 
cells and cytotoxic T -lymphocytes (CTLs), (the types of immune cells most desirable in cancer 
immunotherapy): high co -stimulatory activity and high production levels of anticancer cytokines, 
especially IL -12.31,33-[ADDRESS_507655] relied on the use of either fully matured DCs 
exhibiting high stimulatory function, but low IL -12 secretion, or immature DCs that display low 
stimulator/high IL -[ADDRESS_507656] recently succeeded 
in adapting our original αDC1 protocols based o n fetal bovine serum -supplemented cultures to 
allow αDC1 generation in serum free media, allowing for the application of αDC1s in clinical 
trials of cancer immunotherapy. Our in vitro observations show that such type -1-polarized DCs 
(αDC1s) induce up to 50 -fold higher frequencies of tumor -specific CTLs during in vitro 
sensitizations when compared to conventionally matured DCs. Furthermore, these same αDC1s 
are highly effective inducers of tumor -specific Th1 -type CD4+ T cell responses.  
 
Beyond merely exhibit ing the unique combination of high immunostimulatory function and high 
production capacity for cytokines, αDC1s exhibit a stable phenotype that is resistant to PGE2, 
the suppressive factor over -expressed in colorectal cancer. αDC1s can produce IL -12p70 upo n 
interaction with CD4+ T cells that are unable to produce IFN  or other IL -[ADDRESS_507657] the clinical efficacy of cancer 
vaccines, despi[INVESTIGATOR_402653] (Th2 -, 
Th3- or Tr1 -dominated) cancer patients.

13 αDC1s, the new type of dendritic cell vaccine developed by [CONTACT_27156], are the serum -free, 
clinically -applicable version of type -1 polarized DCs, combining a fully -mature phenotype and 
high expression of  co-stimulatory molecules with an elevated, rather than exhausted ability to 
produce IL -12p70.38 In addition to their elevated ability to induce high numbers of IFNγ -
producing CD8+ T cells recognizing MHC class -I restricted tumor -related antigens, αDC1s (in 
contrast to stand ard mature DCs) have been shown to convert non -cytolytic CD8+ T cells into 
high perforin - and granzyme B -expressing effector cells with high killer activity and tumor -
homing potential.39 Our clinical trials of αDC1 vaccines used as a single agent in end -stage 
cutaneus T cell lymphoma (CTCL) and metastatic melanoma s howed preliminary evidence of 
the ability of αDC1s loaded with autologous tumor (CTCL) or antigenic peptides (melanoma) to 
induce disease stabilizations and clinical responses.[ADDRESS_507658] promising data so far 
results from our recently published Phase 1/2 study in patients with high -grade malignant 
glioma, showing that the combination of intranodal immunization with αDC1 -vaccines with 
systemic intramuscular (IM) administration of poly -ICLC, capable of enhancing tumor 
production of CXCR3 ligands (such as CXCL10) in preclinical models, is capable of inducing 
long-term stabilization of this aggressive disease and objective clinical response s. Within the 
cohort of 22 patients with recurrent high -grade gliomas ( expected progression -free survival of 2 -
4 months), nine patients achieved the PFS of at least 12 months, with two patients achieving 
complete radiologic responses and two additional pat ients undergoing partial (and sustained) 
responses (2PR and 1CR occurred after the publication of our JCO 2011 report). As expected, 
the ability of αDC1s from the individual patients to produce IL -12, the functional hallmark  of 
polarized αDC1s and the pred ictive factor of in vitro  potency of different types of DC vaccines 
was the best predictive factor of the ability of αDC1s + poly -ICLC therapy in promoting the

Interferons, Toll -like receptor (TLR) -ligands, and prostanoid inhibitors, increase the production 
of effector (T eff)-attracting chemokines, and reduce the production of T reg-attracting chemok ines. 
Our recently -published data and data from others, demonstrated that DCs developi[INVESTIGATOR_402654] -type immune cells (CTLs, Th1, 
and NK cells), desirable in the setting of cancer immunot herapy, or undesirable T regs cells.4,41 Our 
data demonstrated the key role of IFNα, poly -I:C (TLR3 -ligand), and prostanoid inhibitors 
(celecoxib), in suppressing the ability of DCs and colorectal cancer tissues to attract T regs and 
promoti ng T eff attraction.4,42 Since αDC1 -induced CD8+ T cells express particularly high CTL 
activity and express the typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] T eff-associated chemokine receptors (CCR5 and CXCR5) 39, such

UPCI  #: 12-110 
Version Date:  03-18-[ADDRESS_507660] shown that CXCR3 and CCR5 are critical for T cell entry into tumors, which is guided by 
[CONTACT_90169]-tumoral expression of respective chemokines. High levels o f the chemokine ligands for 
CCR5 (CCL5/RANTES and CXCR3/IP10) in tumor tissue have been associated with infiltration 
of CD8 T cells with respective receptors in CRC,49 as well as melanoma50 and gastric cancer.51 
High CXCR3+ T cells in peripheral circulation has been associated with increased survival of 
stage III melanoma patients 52. In contrast, high levels of CCL22 (ligand for CCR4) expression 
by [CONTACT_402684] T cells and is associated with 
decreased patient survival43. But most tumors do not have T cell infiltration, or express the 
correct chemokines for effector T cell (T eff) entry. Colon tumors frequently show el evated 
CCL22 levels induced by a PGE 2 rich tumor microenvironment 53,54 permitting regulatory T cells 
(Treg) rather than T eff cells, leading to highly biased T reg/Teff ratio in tumors. The current study 
attempts to correct  the above mentioned chemokine bias in the tumor microenvironment using a 
chemokine modulation regimen and analyze whether such modulation can help T eff, entry and 
prevent T regs influx into tumors.  
 
2.6.[ADDRESS_507661] experience with chemokine modulation agents TLR3 lig ands, IFN , and celecoxib  
 
In our preclinical ex vivo studies performed using explants of resected metastatic CRC, the 
combination of IFN with nonselective or COX -[ADDRESS_507662] to CCL5 ind uction, required additional stimulation by [CONTACT_402685], poly -I:C. Therefore, 
we propose to incorporate in this study a combination of the above 3 factors (IFNα; COX -2 
selective inhibitor, celecoxib; and a TLR3 ligand, rintatolimod, a short half -life derivat ive of 
Poly-I:C). 
 
Interferon –alpha (IFNα, Intron A, Interferon alfa -2b) is currently FDA approved for the adjuvant 
treatment of stage III melanoma. It has been examined by [CONTACT_402686] h demonstrated safety. It has been extensively 
evaluated in the setting of metastatic CRC (as a single agent or in combination with 
chemotherapy or IL -2) and was shown to be largely ineffective at daily doses ranging from 3 -20 
MU/m2, administered subcutane ously or intravenously.55-72 Vaishampayan et al administered 
IFNα (5 MU subcutaneously three times a week) follo wing vaccination with a melanoma vaccine 
which was well tolerated (Melacine).73 Mitchell et al recently completed a large trial examining 
IFNα (5 MU subcutaneously three times a week) for one year74. In a small study by [CONTACT_402687], administration of IFNα in previously vaccinated melanoma patients 
demonstrated objective clinical responses, suggesting its ability to amplify the effectiveness of 
local T cells infiltration and/or function at the tumor site.75 
 
Celecoxib (Celebrex) has been extensively studied in long term clinical trials in patie nts 
predisposed to development of colorectal cancer.76,[ADDRESS_507663] suggested improved efficacy of anti -tumor 
UPCI  #: 12-110 
Version Date:  03-18-2016  
 
15 vaccination with Cox -2 inhibition.78-80 Recent literature has suggested increased risk of adverse 
cardiovascular events associated with the administration of some selective Cox -2 inhibitors.81-83 
The literature regarding the precise risk with celecoxib remains controversial, with the reported 
cardiovascular side effects observed in its long -term users. This trial will involve a short course 
of celecoxib; given at an oral dose of 200 mg daily starting on the day of discharge from surgery 
and continuing until the off -study treatment visit . The dose will be 200 mg, twice a day, the day 
of vaccination (Monday) an d over the 4 days of chemokine modulation regimen (Tuesday - 
Friday ). It has been suggested that lower doses and shorter length of administration decrease the 
risk of adverse cardiovascular events associated with administration of celecoxib.  
 
Poly-I:C (p olyinosinic -polycytidylic acid) is a small molecule ligand (mimicking double -
stranded RNA ligand of Toll -Like Receptor 3 [TLR3],84,85 extensively tested as a single drug in 
the setting of infectious diseases and cancer. It has been shown that TLR3 is involved in the 
recognition of viral components, such as poly -I:C and dsRNA. In contrast, TLR7 and TLR 8 
appear to recognize ssRNA viruses and ssRNA, respectively.86 It is also noted that IFN -,  
and/or  treatm ent of cells results in the remarkable enhancement of TLR3 expression levels, and 
that poly -I:C is capable of inducing the production of pro -inflammatory cytokines (IL -6 and 
TNF) and chemokines (CCL2/MCP -1, CCL5/RANTES, CCL20/MIP -3, and CXCL10/IP -10). 
Other TLR ligands, such as LPS, lipoteichoic acid, peptidoglycan, flagellin, and CpG, failed to 
exert similar effects. These reports, in addition to our preclinical data, provide strong rationale 
for the combined use of poly -IC and IFN . With regard to clini cal use of poly -I:C in cancer 
patients, it has been shown that low dose of poly -I:C is more efficacious than a high dose for 
enhancing immune effects, and that higher doses actually inhibit a number of cell -associated 
immune functions. Rintatolimod (Amplig en) is a poly -IC derivative with reduced half -life in 
vivo and increased selectivity of binding to TLR3.  
 
2.6.3 Clinical experience with chemokine modulating regimen (CKM)  
 
In 2012 , we completed an Expanded Access - single patient IND (BB -IND 14, 934) protocol 
utilizing the CKM regimen of IFN intravenously at 5 MU/m2, rintatolimod intravenously at [ADDRESS_507664] cycle.  
 
Similar CKM treatment  is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, UPCI 10 -131 
(IND 112532 ), open for patients with resectable , metastatic , colon cancer. In that trial, 
rintatolimod is administered daily and not every second day, as in the current trial. This trial 
evaluates the CKM regimen of IFN intravenously (dose escalation of  5, 10, and 20  MU/m2), 
rintatolimod intravenously at 200 mg, and celecoxib oral ly at 200 mg twice a day . Treatment on 
phase I has been  completed without any regimen limiting toxicities and current enrollment is to 
Phase 2 portion of the clinical trial , using the dose of IFN  of 20 MU/M2. 
 
2.7 Rationale  
 
The current trial tests the safety  and clinical effectiveness of the inclusion of personalized 
patient -specific immunotherapy in the clinical management of peritoneal surface malignancies 
UPCI  #: 12-110 
Version Date:  03-18-2016  
 
16 (including but not limited to peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal -appendiceal and 
mesothelioma ori gin), the disease characterized by a uniformly poor overall prognosis and 
managed with the combination of surgical cytoreduction, local and systemic chemotherapy, 
similar in all subtypes.  
 
The tested combination immunotherapy will simultaneously target a) each patients’ lymphocytes 
specific to unique tumor -associated antigens overexpressed on each patient tumors, and b) tumor 
microenvironment (tumor stroma and infiltrating cells) in order to mobilize host’s immune 
responses against their own tumors and to c ounteract local immune suppression  typi[INVESTIGATOR_402656].  
 
We expect to uniformly achieve this goal by:  
a) Immunizing each patient with his/her own polarized dendritic cells ( αDC1s) loaded with 
their tumor material as the source of unique patient/t umor -specific antigens (rather than 
using a pre -determined synthetic antigen), in order to induce the most relevant patte rn of 
immunity in each patient;  
b) Utilizing our recently -developed triple CKM regimen which targets peritoneal stromal 
cells and local in flammatory infiltrate (rather than tumor cells themselves) in order to 
condition the peritoneal environment and promote selective attraction of the desirable 
effector cells (CTLs, TH1 and NK cells), while eliminating the local attraction and 
suppressive fu nctions of the undesirable immune cells (T regs and MDSCs).  
 
We anticipate that such personalized immune therapy will provide a complementary, indirect, 
and therapeutic synergy with chemotherapy (which directly targets tumor cells), jointly resulting 
in delayed time to disease progression.  
 
2.7.1 Rationale for intranodal and intradermal administration of DC1 vaccines  
 
The optimal route of DC administration has not been determined. Our recently completed trial in 
glioma patients used an intranodal (IN) route of  vaccine delivery.40 In the current tri al, we would 
like to administer a portion of the vaccine via an intradermal (ID) route in order to facilitate 
additional prolonged stimulation of the immune system by [CONTACT_402688].  
 
2.7.2 Rationale for the combination of DC1 vaccine and the proposed che mokine -modulating 
regimen  
 
Based on our preclinical observations that DC1 vaccine induce  high levels of two chemokine 
receptors, CCR5 and CXCR3 on tumor -specific CTLs39 and the proposed combination of IFN , 
TLR3 ligand and COX2 inhibitor selectively increase the tumor production of the chemokine 
ligands for these receptors CCR5 ligand: CCL5; and CXCR3 ligands: CXCL9 and CXCL10)42, 
we expect that the  proposed combination will be able to prom ote tumor immune 
surveillance by a) inducing high numbers of tumor -specific CTLs  (DC1 component of 
treatment) and b) directing them to the tumor tissues  (CKM component) , thus establishing 
local immune surveillance within the peritoneal cavity and prolonging the time to disease 
recurrence.

17 3. PATIENT SELECTION  
 
Consent will be obtained for this study on all eligible patients by [CONTACT_177012]-investigators. No patient will be entered into this clinical trial without having signed a 
consent fo rm. The research nurse coordinator or designee will screen the patients further, as per 
investigator/sub -investigator orders, to determine if they meet all the inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
If a recruited patient is excluded or resigns for any reason durin g the course of study, a new 
patient will be enrolled. However, such patients may continue to be followed  and/or receive any 
available vaccine doses . 
 
Candidates for this trial will have peritoneal surface malignancies and CRS + HIPEC  is clinically 
indicat ed as the first line treatment. Due to the autologous nature of the vaccine, tumor tissue and 
the cells obtained from the leukapheresis procedure are required. Without those the vaccine 
cannot be manufactured and the patients are not eligible for this clin ical study.  
 
Surgical outcome of must be deemed able to undergo optimal CRS defined as CC -score of [ADDRESS_507665]-surgical imaging.  Cytoreduction is defined as the burden of residual disease 
nodules left at the end of surgery (CC-0: no visible diseas e; CC -1: residual tumor nodules ≤ 2.5 
mm in size; CC -2: residual tumor nodules 2.5 mm – 2.5 cm in size; CC -3: residual tumor 
nodules > 2.5 cm in size) . 
 
Screening will occur after recovery from surgery to ensure they meet criteria for treatment.

attempt will be made to encourage participation  of minorities in these trials.  
 
4. REGISTRATION PROCEDU RES  
 
N/A (Single -Institution Study)  
 
5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
Prior to starting study treatment patients will undergo CRS + HIPEC surgery. A portion of the 
resected tumor, removed as part of the patient’s clinical care for their disease , will be  evaluated 
for the number of cancer cells as a part of eligibility screening procedures . This tissue will be 
used to manufacture each patient’s autologous vaccine (autologous tumor loaded o n the patients’ 
autologous dendritic cells). The beginning of p ostoperative immunotherapy (defined as week 1) 
will be based upon recovery from  CRS + HIPEC,  but no sooner than [ADDRESS_507672]-surgery , at the 
discretion of the investigator/sub -investigator, to allow for adequate recovery from surgery.  
 
Immunotherapy  are intended to  be administered in the UPCI -CTRC . However, based upon 
scheduling and logistics those procedures are not limited to UPCI -CTRC and may be 
administered in equivalent locations at UPMC Shadyside  and/or the Hillman Cancer Center.  
 
5.1 Phase 1: Dose  assessment of αDC1 vaccine chemokine -modulatory r egimen (CKM)  
 
The recommended Phase 2 dose of the combination of DC1 vaccine in combination with IFNα, 
rintatolimod, and celecoxib will be established by [CONTACT_402689], 
rintatolimod, and celecoxib in combination with escalating doses of IFNα. Patients will receive a 
priming dose of the vaccine which consists of [ADDRESS_507673] week. Patients will then receive a booster dose of the DC 
vaccine, which consists of 1 intranodal injection and 1 intradermal injection, on Monday 
followed by [CONTACT_402690].  
 
There will be 3 dose finding cohorts with one additional de -escalation cohort (designated -1) if 
needed, as show n in the table below:

20 *Rintatolimod starting dose will be 200 mg unless dose escalation is from tier -1 in which case cohorts 2 and 3 will use 100 mg 
of rintatolimod.  
**Celecoxib will be administered orally, at a dose of [ADDRESS_507674] vaccine (day 1 of week 1)  
and continue until Friday the last day of the CKM regimen . The dose will be increased to 200 mg, twice a day on the days of 
vaccination (Monday) and over the 4 days of chemokine modulation regimen (Tuesday  - Friday).  
***In case of limited availability of vaccine, the treatment may proceed with reduced numbers of the cells (down to 0.5 M IN + 
0.5 M ID for each vaccination cycle).  
 
Dose escalation will start with dose tier 1 and proceed to dos e tier 2 in the absence of RLTs. 
Otherwise the dose will be de -escalated to tier -1. The escalation/de -escalation schema uses the 
following table . Under this schema, more than one patient can be enrolled at the same time; 
however, within Phase 1, CKM cannot be started on the next patient until the previous patient 
completes the cycle of CKM and an additional one week of observation for potential RLTs 
(total of two week difference between the consecutive patients). Also, CKM cannot b e started 
on the next dose until 2 patients on the lower dose complete the CKM regimen and additional 
one week of observation for potential RLTs. Similar rule will be applied during the escalation 
between different tiers and for the patients within the sam e dose tier, in order to allow time to 
evaluate any potential toxicities.  
 
The establishment of the RP2D will be based on an adaptive design for which the next dose 
will be set according the following rules : 
 
Dose Escalation /De-escalation  Rules  
Observed Nu mber of RLTs on a Dose Tier  Decision Rule for the Next Subject  
There is at least [ADDRESS_507675] 2 subjects treated 
on this dose tier and the proportion of DLTs on this dose 
tier is > 0.[ADDRESS_507676] 2 subjects treated on 
this dose tier and the proportion of RLTs among all 
subjects on this dose tier is ≤ 0.[ADDRESS_507677] 3 dose tiers, four additional patients will be added to tier 
3 for a total of 6 on tier 3. If, after treating 10 patients without RLT (2 + 2 + 6), dose tier 3 will 
be declared the RP2D. If an RLT is observed at any dose tier the adaptive up -and-down design 
will commence until 15 patients are observed after which the Phase 2 starting dose will be 
estimated by [CONTACT_203328].  
 
Regimen limiting toxicities (RLTs ) are defined as  the following toxicities : 
 
Vaccine possibly, probably or definitely related RLTs  
• Grade 2 or more bronchospasm or generalized uticaria (hypersensitivity)  
• Grade 2 or more allergic reaction  
• Grade 3 injection site reaction due to vaccine  
• > Grade 3 toxicity of any kind related to the DC vaccine

• Greater than or equal to grade [ADDRESS_507678] greater than one week:  
o Flu-like symptoms/constitutional symptoms (i.e., fever, chills, arthralgias, myalgias)  
o Depression, anxiety, restlessness, or insomnia  
o Manageable GI symptoms (i.e., nausea, diarrhea)  
 
The observation period for each patient in the Phase 1 portion of this study will be up to 5 weeks 
(i.e. up to and including the Friday 1  week after the end of the chemokine modulating regimen).

Study treatment will consist of one priming dose of DC vaccination  followed by 3 booster cycles 
of DC vaccine + chemokine modulation regimen (CKM) , cycles 1-3. The booster  vaccine is 
administered on Monday followed  by 4 days of the CKM regimen (Tuesday – Friday).  
 
Timing of the experimental treatment:

• Booster cycle 1: 4 to 12 weeks after priming cycle (target: 4 week s) 
• Booster cycle 2: 4 to 12 weeks after booster cycle 1 (target: 4 weeks)  
• Booster cycle 3: 4 to 12 weeks after booster cycle 2 (target: 4 weeks)  
 
It is expected that a significant proportion of the patients will undergo  adjuvant clinically 
indicated chemotherapy.  Adjuvant c hemotherapy  can be administered between the courses of 
immunotherapy, but no sooner than  [ADDRESS_507683] of chemotherapy . 
 
Patients who (for clinical or logistic reasons) will not be able to take any cycle of  
immunotherapy  within  the above -indicated windows , can still receive the remaining courses of

by [CONTACT_402693]. The intranodal injection for the booster doses will be administered on 
Monday of cycles [ADDRESS_507691] subsequent doses administered at 3 different sites, 
with the sites rotated as follows: (a) right inguinal lymph nodal group, (b) left inguinal lymph 
nodal group, (c) right axillary lymph nodal group, and (d) left axillary lymph n odal group. Only 
one lymph node will be injected at each visit with the dendritic cells. The size of the lymph node 
to be injected will be a minimum of 5  mm and a maximum size of 20 mm.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Intradermal route  
 
Intradermal injection will be used to complement t he intranodal injections (provide a depot 
effect) and it can be used as the only route (for all DCs) in case intranodal injection is not 
feasible. Each portion of the vaccine will be administered using a [ADDRESS_507692] been previously dissected.  
 
5.4.3 Tumor -selective systemic chemokine modulation regimen (CKM)  
 
The chemokine modulating regimen will be administered over 4 consecutive days (Tuesday to 
Friday) in the following order:  
 
• Pretreatment: 500 mL Normal saline IV over approximately 60 minutes  
• Pre-meds: Acetaminophen (Tylenol) 650 m g x 1 dose; Prochlorperazine (Compazine) 10 mg 
x 1 dose – administered 30 minutes (±5 minutes) after starting pre -treatment hydration  
• Celecoxib: 200 mg orally, administered any time prior to IFN  
• IFN: IV over 20 minutes  (±5 minutes)  
• Celecoxib: [ADDRESS_507693] 15 minutes later by  [CONTACT_402694]  
• Rintatolimod: 200 mg (or 100 mg in case of de -escalation) IV, Wednesday and Friday only 
UPCI  #: 12-110 
Version Date:  03-18-2016  
 
25 of the CKM regimen, initial administration should begin at a slow rate of infusion (approx. 
20 cc/hour) and increase  to 40cc/hour after approximately 30 minutes. Tubing should be 
flushed with 30 to 50 mL of normal saline solution upon completion, Administration will be 
followed by 1 hour of observation and vital signs at 30 (±5 minutes)  and 60 minutes (± 10 
minutes)  
 
Pretreatment and pre -meds listed above are recommendations and may be modified based upon 
institutional SOC requirements and at the discretion of the investigator/sub -investigator.  
 
5.5 Continuation of Booster Vaccines Administration  
 
At the discretion of the treating physician, any patient who completes study treatment or is 
removed for reasons other than vaccine related AE/SAEs may continue to receive available 
vaccine. These vaccines may be administered 4-12 weeks apart . Subjects removed will continue 
to be evaluated for safety, but not be included in the analysis of formal efficacy objectives but 
may be evaluated in an exploratory manner. These subjects will be evaluated/followed based 
upon the conventional care evaluations outlined in the study calendar on days of vaccination 
(i.e., PE, vitals, AE evaluation).  
 
5.6 Safety evaluation and monitoring  
 
The recommended starting dose of the combination of vaccine and chemokine modulation will 
be determined in the Phase 1 portion of the trial. In order to refine the es timate of the RLT rate 
during the efficacy phase we will apply  continual Bayesian monitoring of treatment -related 
regimen limiting toxicities  and, if needed, impose a  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_126351] e that permits suspension of the 
trial by [CONTACT_402695] (DSMC ). 
Details and a moni toring table are in section 13.  
 
5.7 Duration of Study Treatment  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event (s), treatment may continue until one of 
the following criteria applies:  
 
• Disease progression  (excluding disease progression during the time between surgery and the 
CKM regimen, these patients will be allow to continue with study treatment) . See also 
Section 5.5.  
• Patient withdraws consent but allows continued follow -up for survi val 
• Patient non -compliance  
• Unacceptable agent specific adverse event(s).  
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for 
further treatment in the judgment of the investigator/sub -investigator.  
• Pregnancy in patient  
 
The reason and date a patient was removed from study treatment must be documented.  
 
UPCI  #: 12-110 
Version Date:  03-18-[ADDRESS_507694] study specific 
clinical visit. At the discretion of the t reating physician, the tests/procedures due to be performed 
at the Off Study Treatment visit may be performed on the last day of the CKM treatment for 
scheduling purposes.   
 
AEs and conmeds will be collected for up to [ADDRESS_507695] dose of treatment. Any patient 
experiencing study related SAE will be followed until resolution  to Grade 1 or baseline . 
 
5.9 Duration of Follow Up  
 
Patients will be followed until death and the f ollow -up information for trial reporting will be 
obtained either from the patient’s medical records or through direct contact [CONTACT_10970] (i.e. 
clinic visit or phone call). The timing of these will be based on scheduling of clinical  care for the 
treatment of the patient’s cancer (i.e. clinic visits every 3 months, 6 months, yearly ). Patients  will 
be followed specifically for evidence of progression/recurrence based on imaging and survival.  
 
5.10 Duration of  Study  
 
Patients will be removed from study if any of th e criteria below applies . 
 
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study.  
• Patient removed due to non -compliance.  
• The investigator decides to prematurely close the trial . 
 
The reason for study removal and the date the patient was removed must be documented.  
 
6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE M ODIFICATIONS  
 
Each vaccination and/or chemokine -modulation r egimen may be delayed for up to [ADDRESS_507696] resolve to Grade 1 or baseline  prior to 
receiving adjuvant chemotherapy . 
 
6.2.1 DC vaccine  
 
Any p atient who experience s the following , and is attributable to the DC vaccine , will be 
removed from study treatment:  
UPCI  #: 12-110 
Version Date:  03-18-2016  
 
27  
• Grade 2 or more bronchospasm or generalized uticaria (hypersensitivity)  
• Grade 2 or more allergic reaction  
• Grade 3 injection site reaction due to vaccine  
• > Grade 3 toxicity of any kind related to the DC vaccine  
 
6.2.2 CKM  
 
For grade 3 toxicit ies: 
1st epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] : dose will  be held  (until the toxicity is reduced to ≤ grade 1 or baseline ) and 
restarted at the next study visit at a dose reduction of 33%  (dose reduction for IFN and 
rintatolimod, celecoxib will not be dose reduced) . The dose can be re -escalated at the 
next study  cycle . 
2nd epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] : dose will be held and restarted (if toxicity is resolved to ≤ grade 1 or baseline) at 
the next study visit at a dose reduction of 33%. The dose cannot be re -escalated.  
For grade 4 toxicit ies: 
1st epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] : dose will be held  (until the toxicity is reduced to ≤ grade 1 or baseline ) and 
restarted at the next study visit at a dose reduction of 33%  (dose reduction for IFN and 
rintatolimod, celecoxib will not be dose reduced) . The dose can be re -escalated at the 
next study cycle . 
2nd epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] : Eliminate the CKM regimen  
 
Patients who are discontinued from the CKM treatment may still receive the DC vaccine.  
 
6.3 Gastrointestinal Toxicity  
 
Nausea and/or vomiting  should be controlled with adequate anti -emetic therapy. Prophylactic 
anti-emetic therapy can be used at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients are 
encouraged to take plenty of oral fluids. If symptoms persist despi[INVESTIGATOR_76303] -emetic 
therapy, protocol drugs should be withheld until recovery to ≤ grade 1.  
 
Diarrhea should be managed with appropriate anti -diarrheal therapy. Patients should be 
encouraged to take plenty of oral fluids. If symptoms do not decrease to grade 1 or less with 
adequate anti -diarrheal therapy, all protocol drugs should be held until resolved to ≤ grade 1 . 
 
6.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions  
 
Caution: patients who had a mild to moderate hypersensitivity reaction have been successfully 
re-challenged, but careful attention to prophylaxis and bedside monitoring  of vital signs is 
recommended.  
 
Hypersensitivity reactio ns to IFNα and/or TLR3 ligand will be managed as follows:  
 
Mild symptoms  (e.g., mild flushing, rash, pruritus) - complete infusion, supervise at bedside, no 
treatment required.  
UPCI  #: 12-110 
Version Date:  03-18-2016  
 
28  
Moderate symptoms  (e.g., moderate rash, flushing, mild dyspnea, chest discomfo rt) - stop 
infusion, give intravenous diphenhydramine [ADDRESS_507697] of the toxicity.  
 
Severe life threatening symptoms  (e.g., hypotension requiring pres sor therapy, angioedema, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_402659], generalized urticaria) - stop infusion, give 
intravenous diphenhydramine and dexamethasone as above, add epi[INVESTIGATOR_402660]. If wheezing is present, t hat is not responsive to bronchodilators, epi[INVESTIGATOR_402661]. Patient should be removed from further protocol therapy.  Report it as an adverse 
event.  
 
7. ADVERSE EVENTS : LIST AND REPORTING R EQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a  routine part of every clinical trial . The 
following list of AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an observed AE (Section 7.2) will 
determine whether the event requires expedited  reporting in addition  to routine  reporting.  
 
Note that Phase 2 of this study will include two periods of immunotherapy, administered before 
and after adjuvant chemotherapy (minimum 5 day wash -out periods), in order to separate 
potential toxicities of the chemokine modulatory regimen (all three factors are short -actin g), 
from the anticipated toxicities of adjuvant chemotherapy. For this reason, we will only collect the 
toxicity data from the periods of immunotherapy.  All toxicities related to the vaccine or CKM 
must be followed until resolution to grade [ADDRESS_507698] (s) 
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_507699] not been reported to be associated with limiting toxicities or adverse side effects.  DC 
vaccines carry a potential risk of development of autoimmune disease (such as lupus, or vitiligo). 
Whereas development of vitiligo has been reported with similar vaccines administered to 
melanoma patients (and correlated with positive response to vaccination), other side e ffects have 
not been reported. Although, based on previous trials with DC -based vaccines, the possibility of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_383970] -based vaccines is rare there is a chance that patients could 
have an allergic reaction to the vaccine.  
 
While other classes of immunotherapueutic drugs, particularly the currently approved immune 
checkpoint blocker, Yervoy [Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]] can produce significant toxicity, such as enterocolitis, 
hepatitis, dermatitis (including toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194]), neuro pathy, and endocrinopathy, due 
to its ability to promote polyclonal T -cell activation and proliferation, such effects have not been 
described following application of DC cancer vaccines, including previously -administered alpha -
DC1 -based vaccines, their com binations with a long acting TLR3 ligand poly -ICLC (Okada, 
UPCI  #: 12-110 
Version Date:  03-18-2016  
 
29 Kalinski, Bartlett, J. Clin. Onc. 29 (3):330 -336, 2011) or their combinations with the proposed 
CKM regimen in our patients treated on compassionate -use protocols.  
 
7.1.2 Celecoxib  
 
Long term use of c elecoxib may cause dyspepsia, headaches (including migraines) and 
borderline elevated liver function tests (which could indicate liver damage). Recently, 
information from three long -term studies of celecoxib has become available. In the first study, a 
cancer prevention study, an increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, and/or deaths resulting from 
heart or blood vessel disease was reported among people taking celecoxib. Approximately [ADDRESS_507700], between 2 and 3 in 100 patients taking celecoxib (between 400 and 800 mg 
daily) had one of these serious events. Another clinical cancer prevention study found no 
increased risks in patients taking celecoxib [ADDRESS_507701] study, an Alzheimer's disease 
prevention study, did not find increased risks with celecoxib. Dosing has been suspended in all 
three of these studies based on the findings of the first cancer prevention study. As a result, the 
FDA is now evaluating the possibility that celecoxib increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, 
and or death resulting from heart or blood vessel disease. Known infrequent side effects of 
celecoxib include nausea and/or vomiting, diarrhea, flatulence, abdominal and stomach pain, 
bleeding ulcer, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], pharyngitis, rhinitis, sinusitis, peripheral edema, 
back pain, dizziness, insomnia, and skin rash. Rare risks include sudden death (unexpected or 
instant death that occurs within minutes or h ours from any cause other than violence), vasculitis, 
hepatitis, liver failure, kidney failure, blood dyscrasia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, viral 
meningitis, severe allergic reaction, visual changes, and transient ischemic attack.  
 
Warnings/Precautions: Stomach problems may be more likely to occur if patients drink alcoholic 
beverages while taking this medicine. Taking two or more of the nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory 
drugs together on a regular basis may increase the chance of unwanted effects. Also, tak ing 
acetaminophen, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_402662], or ketorolac (e.g., Toradol) regularly while taking a 
nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drug may increase the chance of unwanted effects. The risk will 
depend on how much of each medicine is taken every day and  how long the medicines are taken 
together. Therefore, patients should not take acetaminophen or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_402663] (e.g., Toradol). Clinical studies with celecoxib have identified potentially significant 
interactions with fluconazol e and lithium. Experience with nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) suggests the potential for interactions with furosemide and ACE inhibitors. Celecoxib 
is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to celecoxib. Celecoxib should not  be 
given to patients who have demonstrated allergic -type reactions to sulfonamides. Celecoxib 
should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic -type reactions 
after taking aspi[INVESTIGATOR_162882]. Severe, rarely fatal, an aphylactic -like reactions to NSAIDs 
have been reported in such patients.  
 
For more risk information reference the Investigator’s Brochure or package insert.  
 
7.1.3 Interferon -2b 
 
IFNα may cause fever, chills and flu -like symptoms; loss of appetite; nausea; vomi ting, diarrhea 
and abdominal pain; fatigue; lowered white blood count may increase risk of infection; lowered 
UPCI  #: 12-110 
Version Date:  03-18-2016  
 
30 platelets may lead to an increase in bruising or bleeding; hair loss. Other risks  which may be 
common in cases of prolonged administration include  drowsiness; temporary confusion; anxiety, 
amnesia, irritability, confusion, delusions and depression which can be severe; numbness and/or 
tingling in the hands and/or feet, skin rashes and inflammation of the pancreas. Inflammation of 
the pancreas is swel ling or irritation of the pancreas which may result in tenderness or pain in the 
stomach and/or back. When the pancreas is inflamed, the body is not able to absorb all the 
nutrients it needs.  
 
For more risk information reference the Investigator’s Brochure  or package insert.  
 
7.1.4 Rintatolimod (poly IC analog)  
 
Clinical experience with rintatolimod totals over 800 patients with more than 400 patients 
receiving Ampligen® for at least six (6) months, greater than 200 patients for one (1) year, over 
50 patients up to two (2) years, and with 20 or more patients over two (2) years at doses as high 
as 1200 mg i.v. twice weekly. No evidence of dose -limiting organ toxicity, including 
hematologic, liver, or renal toxicity, has been observed.  
 
Adverse events related to infusion such as mild flu -like symptoms, transient headache, fever, 
myalgia, arthralgia, and fatigue/malaise which were seen, usually occur during the initial weeks 
of treatment and tend to subside on repeated administration. These side events were seen in  
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome patients, cancer patients, chronic hepatitis B infected patients and 
individuals infected with HIV at doses of 200 and 400 mg and higher. Patients that experience 
these minor side effects can continue on Ampligen® and as noted, th ese signs and sympotms 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_402664]. Specific symptoms of note include 
a flushing reaction, characterized by [CONTACT_402696], neck and 
chest, which has been observed in approxi mately 10% of patients treated in various studies. 
Usually the flushing is both mild and transient and disappears with repeated dosing. 
Occasionally, it can be accompanied by a tightness of the chest, tachycardia, anxiety, shortness 
of breath, subjective r eports of "feeling hot", diaphoresis and nausea. The reaction is usually 
infusion -rate dependent and may generally be controlled by [CONTACT_1743]. An 
antihistamine (diphenhydramine hydrochloride) can be helpful in controlling and reducing the 
response in the occasional patient for whom the symptom persists. Other less frequently 
occurring adverse effects include nausea, diarrhea, itching, urticaria, bronchospasm, transient 
hypotension, photophobia, rash, bradycardia and transient visual disturba nces. A severe 
unexpected local reaction to extravasation of rintatolimod (Ampligen®, Poly  I:Poly C 12U) at the 
infusion site in the dorsum of the left hand was reported in a Chronic Fatigue Syndrome patient 
with chilblains. Several patients experienced liv er enzyme level elevations while receiving 
Ampligen® associated with chronic dosing over many weeks.  
 
Rintatolimod has been dosed in combination with alpha interferon in investigator initiated 
studies under investigator IND applications during the period b etween December 1985 and April 
1994. A total of 24 patients received combination treatments. Clinical conditions included renal 
cell carcinoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia, melanoma, and ovarian cancer. Rintatolimod  
was given as an IV infusion at a dose o f 300 mg BIW. The starting dose was sometimes as low 
as 1-10 mg. The interferons were administered at a dose of 3 million Units daily, with some 
doses of 0.75 mU at the low side and up to 6 mU at the higher side.  
UPCI  #: 12-110 
Version Date:  03-18-[ADDRESS_507702] of them were flu -like symptoms such as 
chills, cold feeling, fatigue, decreased appetite, fever, muscular aches. Also shortness of breath 
has been seen as well as hypotension, nausea, anemia, dyspnea, numbness, itching and blurred 
vision. These adverse events were judged possibly related to the cond ition of the patients, but 
also possibly related to the administration of rintatolimod or interferon. In some cases worsening 
of the patient’s condition has been seen due to tumor progression, but in general favorable 
clinical patterns were observed in the se patients with advanced disease. Such combinations were 
not intended to be immune modulating and were evaluated in the context of clinical cancer care.  
 
For more risk information reference the Investigator’s Brochure.  
 
7.2 Definitions  
 
Adverse event  (AE)  means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
 
Adverse reaction  means any a dverse event caused by a drug.  
 
Suspected adverse reaction  means any adverse event for which there is a rea sonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of 
certainty about causality than “adverse reaction”.  
 
Reasonable possibility , for the purpose of IND safety reporting, means there is evidence t o 
suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  
 
Life-threatening , suspected adverse reaction  is considered "life -threatening" if, in the view of 
either the investigator (i.e., study site principal investigat or) or sponsor, its occurrence places the 
patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include a suspected adverse reaction 
that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 
Serious , suspected adverse reaction  is considered "se rious" if, in the view of either the 
investigator (i.e., study site principal investigat or) or sponsor, it results in any of the following 
outcomes: death, a life -threatening adverse reaction , inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_402665], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_402666], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in the emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
UPCI  #: 12-110 
Version Date:  03-18-2016  
 
32  
Unexpected , suspecte d adverse reaction  is considered "unexpected" if it is not listed in the 
general investigational plan, clinical protocol, or elsewhere in the current IND application; or is 
not listed at the specificity or severity that has been previously observed and/or specified.  
 
7.3 Recording/Reporting requirements  
 
7.3.1 Eliciting AE Information  
 
Research  subjects will be routinely questioned about AEs at study visits.  
 
7.3.2 Recording Requirements  
 
All observed or volunteered adverse events (serious or non -serious) and abnormal test findings, 
regardless of study group or suspected causal relationship to the study drug(s) will be recorded in 
the subjects’ case histories. For all adverse events, suffic ient information will be pursued and/or 
obtained so as to permit 1) an adequate determination of the outcome of the event (i.e., whether 
the event should be classified as a serious adverse event ) and; 2) an assessment of the casual 
relationship between the  adverse event and the study drug(s).  
 
AEs or abnormal test findings felt to be associated with the investigational drug or study 
treatment(s) will be followed until the event (or its sequelae) or the abnormal test finding 
resolves or stabilizes at a level  acceptable to the investigator (i.e., study site principal 
investigat or) or sponsor . 
 
7.3.[ADDRESS_507703] finding will be classified as an adverse event  if one or more of the following 
criteria are met:  
• The test finding is accompanied  by [CONTACT_4659].  
• The test finding necessitates additional diagnostic evaluation(s) or medical/surgical 
intervention; including significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other 
therapy.  
Note : simply repeating a test finding, in the absence o f any of the other listed criteria, 
does not constitute an AE.  
• The test finding leads to a change in study drug dosing or discontinuation  of subject 
participation in the clinical study.  
• The test finding is considered an AE by [CONTACT_093] (i.e., study site principal 
investigat or) or sponsor  of the IND application.  
7.3.4 Causality and severity assessment  
 
The investigator (i.e., study site principal investigat or) or sponsor  of the IND application  will 
promptly review documented adverse events and abnormal test  findings to determine 1) if the 
abnormal test finding should be classified as an adverse event; 2) if there is a reasonable 
UPCI  #: 12-110 
Version Date:  03-18-2016  
 
33 possibility that the adverse event was caused by [CONTACT_5257](s); and 3) if the adverse event 
meets the criteria for a serious ad verse event . 
 
If the investigator (i.e., study site principal investigat or) or sponsor ’s final determination of 
causality is “unknown and of questionable relationship to the study drug(s)”, the adverse event 
will be classified as associ ated with the use of  the study drug (s) for reporting purposes. If the 
investigator (i.e., study site principal investigat or) or sponsor ’s final determination of causality is 
“unknown but not related to the study drug(s)”, this determination and the rationale for the 
determination will be documented in the respective subject’s case history.  
 
7.4 Reporting  of Suspected Adverse Reactions  
 
All events meeting the definition of a serious adverse event should be recorded on a MedWatch 
3500 A Form 
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Forms/UCM048334.pdf ) or 
departmental SAE form. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_402667], Investigator, 
[EMAIL_4124] , and the l ocal Institutional Review Board per institutional 
reporting requirements . 
 
In addition to completing appropriate patient demographic and suspect medication information, 
the report should include as applicable the following information that is available at the time of 
report within the Event Description (section 5) of the MedWatch 3500 A form : 
 
• CTC AE term(s) and grade (s) 
• current status of study drug  
• all interventions  to addr ess the AE ( testing  and result, treatment and response)  
• hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478]/or discharge dates  
• event relationship to study drug  
 
Follow -up reports : 
Additional information may be added to a previously submitted report by [CONTACT_226190] 3500A report and submitting it as follow -up or creating supplemental summary 
information and submitting it as follow -up with the original MedWatch 3500A form.  
 
7.5 Review of Safety Information: Sponsor Responsibilitie s1 
 
The sponsor must promptly review all in formation relevant to the safety of the drug obtained or 
otherwise received by [CONTACT_384018], including information 
derived from any clinical or epi[INVESTIGATOR_226148], animal or in vitro studies, reports in 
the scien tific literature, and unpublished scientific papers, as well as reports from foreign 
regulatory authorities and reports of foreign commercial marketing experience for drugs that are 
not marketed in the [LOCATION_002].

34 7.6 Review of Safety Information: Investigator Responsibilities2 
 
An investigator shall promptly report to the sponsor of the IND application any adverse effect 
that may reasonably be regarded as caused by, or probably caused by, the drug. If the adverse 
effect is alarming, the investigato r shall report the adverse effect immediately.  An investigator 
shall provide the sponsor with an adequate report shortly after completion of the investigator's 
participation in the investigation.  
 
7.7 Reporting of Adverse Reactions to the FDA  
 
Reporting of ser ious adverse events to the FDA will follow 21 CFR 312.32.  
 
7.7.1 Written IND safety reports  
 
The Sponsor  will submit a written IND Safety Report (i.e., completed FDA Form 3500 A) to the 
responsible new drug review division of the FDA for any observed or voluntee red adverse event 
that is determined to be a serious and unexpected, suspected adverse reaction . Each IND Safety 
Report will be prominently labeled, “IND Safety Report”, and a copy will be provided to all 
participating investigators (if applicable) and sub -investigators.  
 
Written IND Safety Reports will be submitted to the FDA as soon as possible and, in no event, 
later than [ADDRESS_507704] ive criteria for reporting.  
 
For each written  IND Safety Report, the Sponsor  will identify all previously submitted IND 
Safety Reports that addressed a similar suspected adverse reaction experience and will provide 
an analysis of the significance of newly reported, suspected adverse reaction in light of the 
previous, similar report(s) or any other relevant information.  
 
Relevant follow -up information to an IND Safety Report will be submitted to the applicable 
review division of the FDA as soon as the inform ation is available and will be identified as such 
(i.e., “Follow -up IND Safety Report”).  
 
If the results of the Sponsor ’s follow -up investigation show that an adverse event that was 
initially determined to not require a written IND Safety Report does, in f act, meet the 
requirem ents for reporting; the Sponsor  will submit a written IND Safety Report as soon as 
possible, but in no event later than 15 calendar days, after the determination was made.  
 
7.7.2 Telephoned IND safety reports – fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse reactions  
 
In addition to the subsequent submission of a written IND Safety Report  (i.e., complet ed FDA 
Form 3500A), the Sponsor  will notify the responsible review division of the FDA by [CONTACT_402697], fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse reaction.

(IRB), the Investigator will report, to the IRB, any observed or volunteered adverse event that is 
determined to be 1) associated with the investigational dru g or study treatment(s) ; 2) serious ; 
and 3) unexpected . Adverse event reports will be submitted to the IRB in accordance with the 
respective IRB procedures.  
 
Applicable adverse events will be reported to the IRB as soon as possible and, in no event, later 
than 10 calendar days following the investigator’s receipt of the respective information. Adverse 
events which are 1) associated with the investigational drug or study treatment(s) ; 2) fatal or 
life-threatening ; and 3) unexpected  will be reported to the IR B within 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s receipt of the respective information.  
 
Follow -up information to a reported adverse event will be submitted to the IRB as soon as the 
relevant information is available. If the results of the Investigator’s follow -up investigation show 
that an adverse event that was initially determined to not require reporting to the IRB does, in 
fact, meet the requirements for reporting; the Investigator will report the adverse event to the 
IRB as soon as possible, but in no event la ter than [ADDRESS_507706] of the adverse events and potential risks associated with the investigational and 
commercial agents administered in this study can be found in Section 7.1.  
 
This Phase 1/2 trial will evaluate the effectiveness of autologous αDC1 (alpha dendritic cell type 
1 loaded with autologous tumor material) vaccines, combined with a systemic chemokine 
modulation regimen [CKM; intravenous rintatolimod (TLR3 ligand, a deriv ative of Poly -I:C) + 
intravenous IFNα + oral celecoxib] as adjuvant therapy, after cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and 
locoregional hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) in patients with potentially 
resectable peritoneal surface malignancies (PSM),  including but not limited to malignant 
peritoneal mesothelioma and peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) of appendiceal and colorectal 
origin. The primary outcome measure will be recurrence free survival.  
 
8.1 DC Vaccine  
 
Dendritic cells (DC) are derived from autolo gous (the patient’s own) adherent mononuclear cells 
(monocytes) in the peripheral blood by 5 -day or 6 - day culture in the presence of interleukin 4 
(IL-4) and granulocyte -macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM -CSF), followed by 1 -2 days 
of maturation. Th e autologous tumor tissue needed for manufacturing of the vaccine is acquired 
from surgery that is performed as part of the patient’s standard of care for their cancer as 
determined by [CONTACT_24018].

8.1.2 Formulation  
 
The DC Vaccine will be prepared in the cGMP facility of the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_402668], in a process analogous to the existing BB -IND 13,234 (colorectal cancer). The αDC1 
vaccines are prepared in the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_402669] (ITC) under 
cGMP conditions and the final product is vialed and cryopreserved. Labels placed on all tubes 
contain a unique vaccine lot. The vaccine release will follow the quality and safety testing 
performed by [CONTACT_402698]. The target dose of αDC1 vaccine is 3 x 106 cells in 0.5 mL for each 
injection, intranodal and intradermal, however, in case of manufacturing limitations; a minimum 
of 0.5 x 106 cells is acceptable per injection site (0.5 x 106 cells tota l). Patients can receive a 
lesser number of vaccine DCs , but any such patients will not be included in the analysis  of the 
primary endpoint.  
 
8.1.3 Storage and preparation  
 
DCs used in the vaccine will be suspended in 5% human serum albumin (HSA) and delivered t o 
the clinic for administration. For preparation of the vaccines, the labeled vials of cryopreserved 
αDC1 are removed from storage in liquid nitrogen and quickly thawed in a 37C water bath. 
After 3 washes in sterile medium, thawed αDC1 will be suspended in saline with 5% human 
serum albumin (HSA) and placed in sterile syringes for administration to the patient. Each 
syringe will be labeled with a custom -designed label, identifyi ng the patient and the vaccine.  
 
Intranodal and intradermal vaccines will be d elivered as single injections.  
 
8.1.4 Supplier  
 
The DC vaccine will be prepared by [CONTACT_402699][INVESTIGATOR_402668], in a process analogous to the vaccine for colorectal cancer patients covered by [CONTACT_402700] -IND 13,234.

9. CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
 
At indicated time points (see the study calendar , Section 10 ) up to [ADDRESS_507709] scope of the correlative studies will depend on the 
clinical outcomes and available funding, but may include:  
 
• Changes in circulating subsets of immune cells (flow cytometry).  
• Changes in serum immune mediators, cytokines, chemokines (Luminex, ELISAs).  
• Changes in gene expression of blood cells (mRNA/Taqman assays).  
• Changes in the frequencies and activity of tumor -reactive cells (ELISPOTs and ELISAs)  
 
TTP may be correlated with the changes in the blood samples from  the treated subjects. For 
subjects who will need palliative surgery or will demonstrate clinical response and will have 
accessible tumo r tissue, we may obtain tumor material to analyze tumor -infiltrating CD8+ T cells 
in the resected metastatic CRC lesions and local expression of chemokines and other 
inflammatory mediators. This is measured as the ratio between the CD8 (or other gene) mRNA  
message and the expression of the housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_402670], in situ hybridization [ISH], and 
Immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence [ICH/IF]. Examples of additional relevant 
parameters include total numbers of infiltrating T cells, their CD4/CD8 ratios, fr equencies of 
FoxP3 cells, and the expression of chemokine receptors on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (CXCR3, 
CCR5, CCR4, CCR6, and CXCR4). Using ISH, IF, and Taqman, we may also evaluate the local 
expression of T eff-attracting chemokines: CCR5, CXCL9, and CXCL10 a nd CXCL11, and 
MDSC/T reg-attracting chemokines: CCL22 and CXCL12. Similar assays may also be performed 
on any available pre -treatment tumors (if such material will remain after preparation of 
vaccines) . 
 
These potential correlative studies may allow us to determine if any blood - or tumor -associated 
markers are predictive of response to treatment and thus may be used as prospective inclusion 
criteria or assist us in prospective decisions regarding continuation of treatment in the individual 
patients. They ma y also facilitate development of additional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
Any biological samples  (from tissue, leukapheresis, blood draws, etc.)  not needed for this 
research study will be de -identified and may be used for additional cancer research outside of 
this clinical trial.

11.1 Disease Parameters  (May  be used as a guideline for scan review prior to Cycle 2)  
 
Measurable disease:  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in 
at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥[ADDRESS_507714] or MR imaging 
(CT/MR slice thickness no greater than 5 mm). . Malignant lymph nodes may be considered 
measureable disease if they are ≥ [ADDRESS_507715] or MR imaging with 
no greater than 5 mm slice thickness.  
 
Non-measurable disease:  All other lesions (longest diameter < [ADDRESS_507716] or MR scan) are 
considered non -measurable disease. Bo ne lesions, ascites, leptomeningeal disease, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease are all 
non-measurable.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_507717] criteria v1.1 will primarily be used to assess tumor recurrence . 
 
Progressive Disease (PD): The appearance  or recurrence  of one or more new lesions is 
considered progression.  
 
11.3 Duration of Response  
 
Time -to-Progression (TTP):  Time -to-Progression is measured from the start of treatment until 
the criteria for progression are met  
 
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from th e time of 
surgical resection until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented (taking 
as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment 
started).  
 
 
 
12. DATA REPORTING / REGULATORY REQUIREME NTS  
 
12.1 Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
UPCI  #: 12-110 
Version Date:  03-18-2016  
 
43 Sponsor, Investigator , Sub-investigators, regulatory, CRS management, clinical research 
coordinators, clinical research associates, data managers, and clinic staff meet monthly in disease 
center Data Safety Monitoring Boards (D SMB) to review and discuss study data to include, but 
not limited to, the following:  
 
• serious adverse events  
• subject safety issues  
• recruitment issues  
• accrual  
• protocol deviations  
• unanticipated problems  
• breaches of confidentiality  
 
Minutes from the DSMB meetings are available to anyone unable to attend the center DSMB.  
 
All toxicities encountered during the study will be evaluated on an ongoing basis according to 
the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria version 4. All study treatment associated adverse events tha t 
are serious, at least possibly related and unexpected will be reported to the IRB. Any 
modifications necessary to ensure subject safety and decisions to continue, or close the trial to 
accrual are also discussed during these meetings. If any literature b ecomes available which 
changes the risk/benefit ratio or suggests that conducting the trial is no longer ethical, the IRB 
will be notified in the form of an Unanticipated Problem submission and the study may be 
terminated.  
 
All study data reviewed and disc ussed during these meetings will be kept confidential. Any 
breach in subject confidentiality will be reported to the IRB in the form of an Unanticipated 
Problem submission. The summaries of these meetings are forwarded to the UPCI DSMC which 
also meets mon thly following a designated format.  
 
For all research protocols, there will be a commitment to comply with the IRB’s policies for 
reporting unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others (including adverse events). 
DSMC progress reports, to in clude a summary of all serious adverse events and modifications, 
and approval will be submitted to the IRB at the time of renewal.  
 
Protocols with subjects in long -term (survival) follow -up or protocols in data analysis only, will 
be reviewed twice a year rather than monthly  by [CONTACT_384017].  
 
Both the UPCI DSMC as well as the individual disease center DSMB ha ve the authority to 
suspend accrual or further investigate treatment on any trial based on information discussed at 
these meetings.  
 
All records related to this research study will be stored in a locked environment. Only the 
researchers affiliated with the research study and their staff will have access to the research 
records.

Independent monitoring of the clinical study for protocol and Guidelines on Good Clinical 
Practice compliance will be conducted periodically (i.e., at a minimum of annually) by [CONTACT_384019] – Human Subject Research, Research Conduct and 
Compliance Office, University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109].  
 
The Investigator (i.e., the study site principal investigator) and the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_402671].  
 
12.[ADDRESS_507718] -Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_402672] (i.e., the study site principal investigator) will maintain records in accordance  
with Good Clinical Practice.  
 
The investigator will retain the specified records and reports for up to 2 years after the marketing 
application is approved for the investigational drug; or, if a marketing application is not 
submitted or approved for the in vestigational drug, until [ADDRESS_507719] (IRB) Approval  
 
The investigator (i.e., the study site principal investigator) will obtain, from the University  of 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_159499] (IRB), prospective approval of the clinical protocol and 
corresponding informed consent form(s); modifications to the clinical protocol and 
corresponding informed consent forms, and advertisements (i.e., directed a t potential research 
subjects) for study recruitment, if applicable.  
 
The only circumstance in which a deviation from the current IRB -approved clinical 
protocol/consent form(s) may be initiated in the absence of prospective IRB approval is to 
eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to the research subject(s). In such circumstances, the 
investigator will promptly notify the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187588].  
 
The University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_213163] 21 CFR Parts 
50 and 21 CFR 56 , and in conformance with applicable International Conference on 
Harmonization (IC H) Guidelines on Good Clinical Practice.  
 
In the event that the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_213164], as a condition of approval, substantial 
changes to a clinical protocol submitted under an FDA -accepted IND application, or in the event 
of an sponsor’s d ecision to modify the previously accepted clinical protocol, the sponsor will 
submit (i.e., in advance of implementing the change) a Protocol Amendment to the IND 
describing any change that significantly affects the safety of subjects, the scope of the 
investigation, or the scientific quality of the study. Examples of protocol changes requiring the 
submission of a Protocol Amendment include:

in the number of subjects under study.  
• Any significant change in the design of the protocol (such as the addition or deletion of a 
control group).  
• The addition of a new test or procedure that is  intended to improve monitoring for, or reduce 
the risk of, a side effect or AE; or the droppi[INVESTIGATOR_31081] a test intended to monitor the safety of the 
investigational drug.

12.6 Informed Consent  
 
The investigator (i.e., the study site principal investigator) will make certain that an appropriate 
informed consent process is in place to ensure that potential research subjects, or their authorized 
representatives, are fully informed about the nature and objectives of the clinical study, the 
potential risks and benefits of study participation, and their rights as research subjects. The 
investigato r, or a sub -investigator(s) designated by [CONTACT_456], will obtain the written, signed 
informed consent of each subject, or the subject’s authorized representative, prior to performing 
any study -specific procedures on the subject. The date and time that th e subject, or the subject’s 
authorized representative, signs the informed consent form and a narrative of the issues discussed 
during the informed consent process will be documented in the subject’s case history. The 
investigator or sub -investigator will r etain the original copy of the signed informed consent form, 
and a copy will be provided to the subject, or to the subject’s authorized representative.  
 
The investigator will make certain that appropriate processes and procedures are in place to 
ensure tha t ongoing questions and concerns of enrolled subjects are adequately addressed and 
that the subjects are informed of any new information that may affect their decision to continue 
participation in the clinical study. In the event of substantial changes to the clinical study or the 
risk-to-benefit ratio of study participation, the investigator will obtain the informed consent of 
enrolled subjects for continued participation in the clinical study.  
 
13. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
 
13.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
13.1.1  Primary e ndpoint  
 
• (For Phase 1) Define Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D)  
UPCI  #: 12-110 
Version Date:  03-18-2016  
 
46 • To evaluate time -to-progression (TTP) in patients with peritoneal surface malignancies 
(PSM), including but not limited to malignant peritoneal mesothelioma and peritoneal 
carcinomatosis (PC) of  appendiceal and colorectal primary tumors. For patients who will 
be completely resected, time -to-progression will be equal to recurrence.  
 
13.1.2  Secondary endpoints  
 
• To estimate overall survival (OS).  
• Correlative studies to characterize sequential immune response changes by [CONTACT_402703]  (see 
Section 9 ). These results will be correlated with TTP, PFS, and OS.  
 
Note the additional discussion of the Phase [ADDRESS_507721] to treat ~ 115 patients per year (malignant peri toneal mesothel ioma ~ 15 
cases/ year; appendiceal perito neal carcinomatosis ~ 40 cases/ year; colore ctal carcinomatosis ~ 
60 cases/ year). We anticipate approximately 50% of treatment patients will participate in the 
clinical trial. A review of the literature demonstrates m edian time -to-progression of 20 months, 
20 months and 12 months for malignant peritoneal mesothelioma, appendiceal peritoneal 
carcinomatosis, and colorectal carcinomatosis, respectively. We aim to demonstrate a 25% 
improvement in time -to-progression (malig nant peritoneal mesothelioma 25 months; appendiceal 
peritoneal carcinomatosis 25 months; and colorectal carcinomatosis 15 months). We will need 
168 patients over 3 years of accrual  with an additional 1.5 years of follow -up after accrual 
ceases. This will p rovide 90% power to detect an overall improvement of 25% for an ex ponential 
test at alpha = 0.10.  
 
13.3 Data Analysis  
 
At the completion of follow -up in evaluable patients, we will estimate progression -free survival 
by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier method with Greenwood 90%  confidence intervals. We will conduct a 
formal test of the hypothesis that progression -free survival is improved with the experimental 
therapy . This test will be a one sided exponential test at α = .10 that the median progression -free 
survival is better than 25% compared to historical controls. If this test is significant we will 
conclude that the progression -free survival is improved compared to the historical control . 
Descriptive summaries will be prepared of all adverse events by [CONTACT_479], frequency and a ttribution. 
An assessment of the association between immune parameters and survival will be conducted. 
The panel of immune parameters will be tested for association with progression -free and overall 
survival with Cox pro portional hazards regression.  
 
13.4 Conti nuous Safety Monitoring During the Efficacy Phase  
 
We will use continual Bayesian monitoring of treatment -related regimen limiting toxicities  with 
a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_126351] e that permits suspension of the trial by [CONTACT_402704]  #: 12-110 
Version Date:  03-18-2016  
 
47 Safety and Mo nitoring Committee (DSMC ). We have selected a moderately vague pri or 
probability of an RLT  to conform to our prior beliefs that the probability of an RLT is unlikely to 
be greater than the 30% target of the dose finding phase and could be lower if no RLTs are found

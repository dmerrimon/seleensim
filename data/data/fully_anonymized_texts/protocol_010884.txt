Vers ion Date: 06/15/2021   7 The Children's Oncology Group has received a Certificate of Confidentiality from the federal government, 
which will help us protect the privacy of our research subjects.  The Certificate protects against the 
involuntary release of information about subjects collected during the course of our covered studies.  The 
researchers involved in the studies cannot be forced to disclose the identity or any information collected in 
the study in any legal proceedings at the federal, state, or local level, regardless of whether they are criminal, 
administrative, o r legislative proceedings.  However, the subject or the researcher may choose to voluntarily 
disclose the protected information under certain circumstances.  For example, if the subject or his/her 
guardian requests the release of information in writing, th e Certificate does not protect against that 
voluntary disclosure.  Furthermore, federal agencies may review our records under limited circumstances, 
such as a DHHS request for information for an audit or program evaluation or an FDA request under the 
Food,  Drug and Cosmetics Act.  
 
The Certificate of Confidentiality will not protect against mandatory disclosure by [CONTACT_6741], reportable communicable diseases, and/or possible threat of harm to

ABSTRACT  
This subprotocol is a component of the NCI-COG Pediatric MATCH trial  APEC1621 . The  APEC1621SC 
screening  protocol details the assay used for the integral genomic profiling which will determine eligibility 
for this subprotocol . Here we will  conduct a phase 2 trial of tazemetostat in children with recurrent or 
refractory solid tumors (including non-Hodgkin lymphomas, histiocytoses and CNS tumors ) harboring 
specified activating genetic alterations  in EZH2 or members of the SWI/SNF complex . EPZ-6438 
(tazemetostat) is a selective small molecule inhibitor of  the histone  methyltransferase EZH2.1 Tazemetostat 
will be administered orally  twice daily at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) as determined by [CONTACT_812505] [ADDRESS_1125085]. Progression -free survival (PFS) will be assessed as a secondary endpoint.

APEC1621C  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Vers ion Date: 06/15/2021   8 Therapy will be discontinued if there is evidence of progressive disease or drug related dose -limiting 
toxicity that requires removal from therapy ( Section 6.0 ). Therapy may otherwise continue for up to 2 years 
(maximum of 26 cycles) provided the patient meets the criteria for starting subsequent cycles ( Section 5.2 ) 
and does not meet any of the criteria for remov al from protocol therapy criteria ( Section 10.0 ).  
 
1.0 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES (SCIENTIFIC AIMS)  
 
1.1 Primary Aims  
 
 To determine the objective response rate (ORR; complete response + partial 
response) in pediatric patients treated with tazemetostat with advanced solid 
tumors (including CNS tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphoma or histiocytic disorders 
that harbor  gain of function mutations in EZH2, or loss of function mutations in 
the SWI/SNF comp lex subunits SMARCB1 or SMARCA4  at a dose of 520 
mg/m2/dose twice daily for patients without any CNS involvement  or 1200 
mg/m2/dose orally twice daily for patients with CNS involvement.   
 
1.2 Secondary Aims  
 
 To estimate the progression -free survival in pediatric patients treated with 
tazemetostat that harbor gain of function mutations in EZH2, or loss of function 
mutations in the SWI/SNF complex subunits SMARCB1 or SMARCA4.  
 
 To obtain information about the tolerability of tazemetostat in children with 
relapsed or refractory cancer . 
 
1.3 Exploratory Aims  
 
 To evaluate other biomarkers as predictors of response to tazemetostat and 
specifi cally, whether tumors that harbor different missense mutations or fusions 
will demonstrate differential response to tazemetostat treatment.  
 
 To explore approaches to profiling changes in tumor genomics over time through 
evaluation of circulating tumor DNA.

(Enhancer of zeste homologue -2) is the catalytic subunit of the  multi -protein Polycomb 
Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and PRC2 is the only human HMT that can methylate 
H3K27 (lysine 27 of histone H3) , catalyzing  the mono, di and tri -methylation of H3K27 .[ADDRESS_1125086] spectrum of human cancers  including non -Hodgkins lymphoma, INI -
1 deficient tumors, carcinomas, cutaneous melanoma, gliomas, medulloblastoma, and 
epen dymoma via mutation, amplification and overexpression.    
 
EZH2 overexpression is mainly found in solid tumors, whereas activating or inactivating 
mutations are identified in hematologic malignancies. EZH2 gain of function mutations 
were initially identified in NHL3, specifically in follicular lymphoma (FL, 7.2%) and 
                                       THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY . SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY .    APEC1621C  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Vers ion Date: 06/15/2021   9 diffuse large B -cell lymphoma (DLBCL, 9.7%, exclusively in germinal center B -cell 
[GCB] subtype). Genetic databases suggest that the incide nce of EZH2 point mutations is 
15-25% in FL and GCB -DLBCL.  The oncogenic mutations at tyrosine 64 6 (Y64 6), A682 
and A692 are those responsible for an excess of H3K27me3 repressive marks , impairing 
gene expression programs in lymphomas . 
 
A natural antagonistic relationship between the SWI/SNF complex and PRC2 complex has  
been demonstrated  with regards to  stem ce ll-associated program. Loss of SWI/SNF 
complex members, such as SMARCB1, has be en demonstrate d to aberrantly  activate those 
programs.4 Consistent with the reciprocal relationship of PRC2 and SWI/SNF  conditional 
mouse models, genetic inactivation of EZH2 has been shown to block tumor formatio n 
driven by [CONTACT_807889]1  loss.  
 
It is not possible to precisely determine the frequency of relevant genetic  alterations  in 
childhood malignancies eligible for this arm of the pediatric MATCH protocol using 
available databases. Detection of such genetic alterat ions requires advanced sequencing  
methods yet these  methods have not been utilized on a sufficient number or broad  diversity 
of samples from recurrent childhood solid tumors and lymphomas , as such  data is limited 
to determine an accurate prediction of freq uency.  
 
2.2 Preclinical Studies  
 
 Antitumor Activity  
Tazemetostat has been shown to induce apoptosis and differentiation in INI1 -
negative MRT cell lines.5 In xenograft -bearin g mice, treatment with tazemetostat 
resulted in dose -dependent regression of MRTs with correlated diminution of 
intra-tumoral H3K27 methylation and prevention of tumor regrowth after dosing 
cessation.  See Section 2.3.3 for further preclinical experience  including human 
lymphoma cell lines, SMARCB1 -deficient malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) cell 
lines, and SMARCA2/A4 negative small cell carcinoma of the ovary, 
hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT)  cell lines . 
 
 Animal Toxicology  
Non-clinical repeated -dose oral toxicity studies in Sprague -Dawley (S -D) rats and 
cynomolgus monkeys, which may be relevant to human safety, revealed the following 
toxicities and target organs in the two species as follows:  
- In the gastrointestinal (GI) tract: ulcer/erosion in the stomach , duodenum, jejunum, 
and/or ileum  
- In lymphoid tissues: lymphoid depletion  
- In a 13-week  study  in adult  S-D rats, T- cell lymphoma  o c c u r r e d  in a non - dose 
and non-concentration  related  fashion and was observed in 11 of 40 rats at 300 
mg/kg/day  (mid-dose)  and in 1 of 40 animals  at 600 mg/kg/day  (high dose) dose 
groups.  No cases  of lymphoma  were  observed  in the 100 mg/kg/day (low dose)  
tazemetostat  dose cohort  in adult  rats or at any dose cohort  (100-600 mg/kg/day)  in 
cynomolgus  monkeys  treated  for 4 or 13 weeks.  In a 13-week  study  in juvenile  S-D 
rats, thymic  lymphoma  was observed  in male  and female  animals.   However, the 
incidence of T -cell lymphoma did not increase continuously as systemic exposure to 
tazemetostat increased.   At doses  that resulted in steady -state AUC 0-24 values less than 
100,000 ng*h/mL, T -cell lymphoma was observed in 2/81 juvenile rats.   However, 
T-cell lymphoma was observed in 24/63 juvenile rats at doses that resulted in AUC 0-24 
from 125,000 ng*h/mL to 290,000 ng* h/mL. The greatest tazemetostat AUC 0-24 was

mg/kg/day tazemetostat.   T-cell lymphoma was observed in 2/20 female juvenile rats 
in the tazemetostat 150/600 mg/kg/day dose group.   The etiology  of the rat lymphoma  
is currently  unknown,  but does not appear  to be related  to alterations  in the Notch  
signaling  pathway  or endogenous  rat leukemia  virus  reactivation . Please see Section 
2.7 for relevance to pediatric patients.

2.3 Adult Studies  
 
 Phase 1 Studies  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_812495] a Phase 1/ 2, first -in-human clinical study (E7438 -G000 -
101, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), a multicenter, open -label, dose -escalation study in  adult 
patient s with advanced solid tumors.  The Phase 1 portion of this study completed 
enrollment in December 2015.  Fifty -eight a dult patients (21 B -cell lymphomas, 
37 solid tumors) were  enrolled and treated at five dose levels of 100, 200, 400, 
800, and 1600 mg BID.  Tazemetostat  PK exhibits rapid absorp tion, T max =1-[ADDRESS_1125089]-dose, as well as r apid elimination ( t1/2 ~ 3-5 hr), justifying twice daily dosing. 
Tazemetostat  exposure was linearly dose-proportional  with maximal inhibition 
(~40%) at observed at the 800 mg and 1600 mg dose levels .  Correlation between 
dose exposure and targ et inhibition (decreased H3K27M e3 inhibition by [CONTACT_812506]) was demonstrated. One DLT of thrombocytopenia was reported at the [ADDRESS_1125090] frequently occurring adverse eve nts ( ≥ 15%) were 
asthenia, anemia, decreased appetite, muscle spasms, nausea, vomiting, 
constipation, thrombocytopenia, and dyspnea. All other adverse events occurred 
with a frequency of < 15% of patients .  In the B -cell lymphoma cohort, [ADDRESS_1125091] had objective respo nses (1 CR and 1 PR) and one 
with SD (with 15% reduction in tumor). Based on the safety, PK, biological 
activity and responses, the RP2D was determined to be [ADDRESS_1125092] of food on the bioavailability of  tazemetostat  and the drug-drug

primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A. It is a weak inducer of CYP3A4/5 isozyme as well as an 
inhibitor of the CYP3 A, CYPA2C family, CYP2D6 and P -glycoprotein (P -gp). 
A Phase 2 study is ongoing for subjects wit h relapsed/refractory DLBCL and FL.    
 
 Phase 2 Studies  
Currently, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_812496] a Phase 2 clinical study ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) for 
adult subjects with INI1 -negative tumors or relapsed/refractory synovial sarcoma  
as well as a Phase 2 clinical study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) in adult subjects with malignant 
mesothelioma with BAP1 loss of function . 
 
 Pharmacology/Pharmacokinetics/Correlative and Biological Studies  
EPZ-6438 (tazemetostat) is a selective small molecule inhibitor of the histone  
methyltransferase EZH2.1  Tazemetostat is an inhibitor of both wild type and 
mutated EZH2  containing  residues Y64 6, A682G and A6 92 with half maximal 
inhibitory concentrations (IC50) ranging from 2 -38 nmol/L.  The com pound shows 
a 35-fold selectivity over the most closely related HMT, EZH1 , and greater than a 
4500 -fold selectivity over other HMTs.  It selectively i nhibits H3K27  methylation 
in a concentration and time dependent manner leading to selecti ve killing of cel l 
lines, s pecifically, human lymphoma cell lines with mutant or wildtype EZH2,  
SMARCB1 -deficient  malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) cell lines , and 
SMARCA2/A4 negative SCCOHT cell lines  with IC50 in the na nomolar range.  
Tazemetostat  administered orally has de monstrated antitumor activity in vivo 
against several EZH2 wild type and mutant human lymphoma xenograft murine  
models .[ADDRESS_1125094] pediatric phase 1 study of tazemetostat  (EZH -102, NCT0 2601937) for 
children with relapsed/refractory malignant rhabdoid tumors, including CNS 
ATRT, and other INI -deficient tumors and synovial sarcoma enrolled its first 
patient in January  2016 and completed the dose escalation phase of the trial (dose 
expansion is ongoing).  As of July 2017, the RP2D was d etermined to be 1200  
mg/m2/dose twice daily . On this study, a liquid formulation of tazemetostat  is 
administered PO BID. Pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and correlative 
biological  studies are currently being collected in the ongoing phase 1study.   
 
 Hydrobr omide Salt Formulation  
 An analysis of chloride levels in subjects on study EZH -102 at the 1200 mg/m2 
dose level showed elevated chloride levels (beyond the ULN) in 5/7 subjects who 
had been treated at this dose level. Reviewing this finding further, subjects at lower 
dose levels  (4/6 subjects at 900 mg/m2, 4/6 subjects at 700mg/m2 and 4/6 subjects 
at 520 mg/m2) also demonstrated elevated chloride levels.  
Hyperchloremia is considered an artifact resulting from interference of serum 
bromide with the serum chloride assay (tazemetos tat is a bromide salt). The 
                                       THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY . SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY .    APEC1621C  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Vers ion Date: 06/15/2021   12 hydrobromide salt of tazemetostat is the form used in clinical studies, including 
the EZH -102 study. Bromide may artificially increase chloride measurements, and 
this phenomenon was noted in non -clinical studies of tazemetostat in which 
artifactually elevated serum chloride was noted in repeat -dose toxicology studies 
of tazemetostat in rats and monkeys at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (equivalent 
surface area doses in humans = 142 -333 mg/ m2).  Ion exchange chromatography 
showed increased serum chloride in these nonclinical studies to be pseudo -
hyperchloremia, representing increased bromide and decreased chloride in serum. 
Due to this nonclinical finding, which could indicate the potential for elevated 
bromid e levels in clinical studies, bromide levels were measured in the Phase 1 
study of tazemetostat in adults. Bromide was within normal levels (<6.2 mmol/L) 
for all subjects taking the oral tablet formulation in doses up to 1600 mg BID. 
However, mean tazemeto stat AUC(0 -24) in children at the 1200 mg/m2 dose level 
exceeded that observed in the [ADDRESS_1125095] as a treatment for refractory epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. Thus, there are few current 
published guidelines for therapeutic monitoring and treatment of bromide.  Ryan 
and Baumann (1999) presented an overvi ew of available literature which provides 
therapeutic bromide ranges including levels associated with bromide toxicity. As 
different units of measure have been used at various testing laboratories with no 
clear preferred unit of measure used, the authors r ecommend the following 
conversion: 1 mEq/L = 8 mg/dL = 0.96 mmol/L.  The central testing laboratory 
(ARUP) being utilized in the EZH -102 study provides results using the mg/dL unit 
of measure.  The authors report therapeutic ranges as being between 10 -35 m Eq/L 
(80-280 mg/dL) with toxicity occurring in some studies at approximately the 20 
mEq/L range (160 mg/dL).  Elevated bromide levels can cause neurologic toxicity; 
drowsiness is often the first symptom that may occur and has been reported at 
levels of 20  mEq/L (160 mg/dL), with severe neurologic symptoms occurring at 
200 mg/dL or greater.   
To date, no patients on EZH -[ADDRESS_1125096] experienced any adverse events that are 
suggestive or indicative of bromide toxicity.  However, assessment of bromide 
levels was in stituted in the Phase 1 study and therefore will be incorporated into 
this subarm protocol . 
2.5 Overview of Proposed Pediatric Study  
For patients with CNS involvement , Tazemetostat will be administered orally  at the MTD 
and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 1200 mg/m2/dose BID.  Patients without any 
CNS involvement  will be administered Tazemetostat orally  at the lower starting dose of 
520mg/m2/dose BID . For patient(s) enrolled pre -amendment #3 B Tazemetostat will be 
administered orally  at the MTD and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 1200 
mg/m2/dose BID.  
 
The primary aim of this trial will be to establish the objective response rate to tazemetostat.

APEC1621C

for CNS tumors.  
 
 
2.6 Rationale for Amendment #1 (Increase in Dose Level)  
The purpose of Amendment #1 is to increase the starting dose level from 900 mg/m2 BID 
to 1200 mg/ m2 BID.  The most common treatment - emergent adverse events (TEAE) were 
vomiting (41%), pyrexia (28%), headache (24%), and nausea (24%), while the most 
common grade ≥3 TEAEs were death (17%, all unrelated to study drug) and anemia (9%).  
One p atient  at the 300 mg/m2 dose level had DLTs of dyspnea (grade 4)  and hypoxia (grade 
3), however, no other DLT s were noted in any other cohort.   Though the “rolling 6” design 
of the pediatric Phase I clinical trial supported further escalation of the dose level, of special 
note, elevated serum chlorid e levels were observed in 3/6 evaluable patients at the 1200 
mg/m2 BID dose level as well as in earlier dose levels (retrospective observation). The 
observed hyperchloremia was considered to be factitious and related to the formulation of 
tazemetostat as a  bromide salt.  Elevated serum bromide levels were detected in 2/5 active 
patients without any associated clinical signs or symptoms. With these data and on the 
basis of pharmacodynamic activity demonstrating H2K27me3 in peripheral mononuclear 
cells, as  of July 2017, the RP2D was determined to be 1200 mg/m2/dose twice daily.  
 
2.7 Rationale for Amendment #3 B T-cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma Monitoring  
(changes in dose level ) 
In the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_12301] -sponsored pediatric phase I trial, one child developed T -cell lymphoblastic 
lymphoma (T -LBL) after receiving tazemetostat for [ADDRESS_1125098] been no cases of T -LBL or related T -
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T -ALL) in the [ADDRESS_1125099] higher 
tazemetostat exposures than had been seen in adults (specifically high AUC (0 -24h)). In 
the company’s assessment, the risk for T -LBL/T -ALL in tazemetostat clinical trials 
appears to be largely concentrated in pediatric patients ba sed on:  
 
1) The known epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] / pathophysiology of T -LBL/ALL.  
2) Age-related intact and active thymus (thymic involution increases over time 
with reduced risk with increasing age)  
3) Higher AUC (0 -24h) exposures in pediatric patients   
 
Based on these data, amendment [ADDRESS_1125100] the dosing for new APEC1621C patients 
based on site of disease (CNS vs. non -CNS) and will allow for increased monitoring of T -
LBL/ALL( see Section 5  and Section 6.2 ). Based on the pediatric phase I trial of lower 
Tazemetostat exposures in children receiving 520mg/m2, and one patient in this cohort 
receiving prolonged benefit, 520mg/ m2 was chosen for patients not requiring higher, CNS -
penetrant doses to limit exposures and potential secondary malignancies.

3.1 Genetic Screening Procedure s for Eligibility  
Patient enrollment onto the APEC1621 SC screening protocol is required. Tumor and blood 
samples will be obtained and the  results of the evaluation of the tumor specimens will 
determine if the patient's tumor has an actionable Mutation of Interest ( aMOI ) for which a 
MATCH treatment subprotocol is available.  
 
The treatment assignment to a MATCH subprotocol (if a relevant aMOI is detected) will 
be communicated to the enrolling institution via the COG or MATCHBox treatment 
assignment mechanism at the time th e results of MATCH are returned , upon which a 
reservation to APEC1621 C will be secured by [CONTACT_6744].   Reservations should be withdrawn

Therapy will be discontinued if there is evidence of progressive disease or drug related 
dose-limiting toxicity that requires removal from therapy ( Section 6.0 ). Therapy may 
otherwise continue for up to 2 years provided the patient meets the criteria for starting 
subsequent cycles ( Section 5.2 ) and does not meet any of the criteria for r emoval from 
protocol therapy criteria ( Section 10.0 ).  
 
A cycle of therapy is considered to be 28 days.  A cycle may be repeated up to a total 
duration of therapy of 2 years  (maximum 26 cycles) . 
 
All p atients  with CNS involvement  enrolled after AMD#3  will be treated at the established

 If a patient ex periences hematological dose -limiting toxicity as defined in  Section 
5.4.2 , the treatment will be held.  Counts should be checked every 3 -4 days for 
thrombocytopenia and every other day for neutropenia during this time. If t he 
toxicity resolves to meet eligibility parameters within 14 days of drug 
discontinuation, the patient may resume treatment at a reduced dose ( See Appendix 
IV). Patients who experience dose -limiting toxicity should have their dose reduced 
by 25% so that patients receive 75% of the original administered dose  (Patients 
enrolled at 1200mg/m2/dose should dose reduce to  900 mg/m2/dose  and patients 
enrolled at 520mg/m2/dose should dose reduce to  390 mg/m2/dose ) Doses reduced 
for toxicity will not be re -escalated, even if there is minimal or no toxicity with the 
reduced dose.  
 If toxicity does not resolve to meet eligibility parameters within [ADDRESS_1125125] be removed from protocol therapy.  
 
6.3 Dose Modifications for Non -Hematological T oxicity  
 
 If a patient experiences non -hematological dose -limiting toxicity as defined in 
Section 5.4.1 , the treatment will be held. When the toxicity resolves to meet 
eligibility parameters or baseline within 14 days of drug discontinuation, the 
patient may resume treatment at a reduced dose ( See Appendix IV ). Patients who 
experience dose -limiting toxicity should have their dose reduced by 25% so that 
patients receive 75% of the original administ ered dose , patients enrolled at 
1200mg/m2/dose  should dose reduce to 900 mg/m2/dose  and patients enrolled at 
520mg/m2/dose should dose reduce to 390mg/m2/dose. . Doses reduced for toxicity 
will not be re -escalated, even if there is minimal or no toxicity with the reduced 
dose.  
 If toxicity does not resolve to meet eligibility or baseline parameters within [ADDRESS_1125126] be removed from protocol therapy.

4 Tumor Disease Evaluation should be obtained on the next consecutive cycle  after initial documentation 
of either a PR or CR.  Subsequent scans may restart 2 cycles after the confirmatory scan. Please note 
that for solid tumor patient s, if the institutional investigator determines that the patient has progressed 
based on clinical or laboratory evidence, he/she may opt not to confirm this finding radiographically.  
4-A     Neurological exam also required for CNS patients.    
4-B  Non- Hodgkin Lymphoma/ Histiocytosis patients are  required to have PET scans within [ADDRESS_1125135]/MRI and MIBG scintigraphy prior to enrollment if the 
patient was enrolled with or has a history of having MIBG avid tumor. Otherwise the patient must have 
both CT/MRI and bone scan prior to enrollment. For patients wi th neuroblastoma and measurable disease 
by [CONTACT_462], lesions should be measured and followed using the same modality (CT or MRI) in 
addition to MIBG or bone scan. For patients with neuroblastoma and evaluable disease by [CONTACT_6757], use  the same modality (MIBG scintigraphy or bone scan) to image and follow 
patients; CT/MRI are not required but may be performed as clinically indicated. Refer to Section 12.5.4 
and Section 12.9 . 
5 Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_6706]/or biopsy only required in patients suspected of having bone marrow 
metastasis on the basis of history, symptoms, laboratory evaluation or other clinical data.  Should only 
be performed on patients with known b one marrow involvement at baseline.  
6 Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_6706]/or biopsy should be performed on ly when complete response or par tial 
response is identified in target disease or when progression in bone marrow is suspected.  
7.  Patient diary (see Appendix III ) should be reviewed  weekly during Cycle [ADDRESS_1125136].  
8. With consent, t wo samples will be collected on this protocol (Cycle 5 Day 1; and for patients receiving 
≥ 5 cycles, at progression or end of protocol therapy) see Section 8.[ADDRESS_1125137] dose  
of protocol ther apy. In patients with open growth plates, follow -up plain radiographs of the same  growth 
plate(s) should be obtained according to Section 8 .2.  
10. Patients should get a manual differential if automated differential demonstrates blasts  
 
8.2 Monitoring for Specific Toxicities  
 Growth Plate Toxicities :  
Patients will have a plain AP radiograph of a single proximal tibial growth plate 
(bone X -ray tests) obtained prior to the first dose of protocol therapy.  
a. If patients are found to have a closed tibial growth plate, no further radiographs 
will be required.  
b.  If patients are found to have an open tibial growth plate, then repeat plain AP 
radiographs of the same  tibial growth plate will be obtained prior to cycles 2, 
5 and every 6 months  
• Patients with evidence of growth plate thickening or other changes  should  
have a knee MRI performed to further assess the degree of  physeal 
pathology and undergo more frequent x -ray follow up. MRI  should be 
performed without contrast.  
• Patients with knee MRI changes should be managed in an individualized  
manner. Decisions regard ing continuation of tazemetostat should be

MATCH  Leadership, taking into account the presence of any symptoms 
referable  to the knee as well as the patient’s response to tazemetostat . 
Consul tation  with an orthopedic surgeon may also be indicated. Plans for 
follow -up imaging will also be made on an individualized basis, taking 
into account  the presence of symptoms at the knee or other joints as well 
as the  decision to continue tazemetostat or not.  
 
8.3 Radiology Studies  
 
 Bone Age/Knee MRI  
All tibial radiographs and knee MRIs (if obtained) should be submitted for review.  
 
 Central Radiology Review for Response:  
Patients who respond (CR, PR) to therapy or have long term stable disease  (SD) 
(≥ 6 cycles) on protocol therapy will be centrally reviewed.  The Operations center 
will notify the site when a patient has met the criteria for review. The tumor disease 
evalua tions to be submitted for review include baseline (pre -study) evaluations  as 
well as all end of cycle tumor disease evaluations which occurred while the patient 
was on the subprotocol therapy study. .  
 
 Technical Details of Submission:  
To ensure an adequate interpretation of FDG -PET and CT with contrast scans, 
scans transferred between the treating institutions and the Imaging and Radiation 
Oncology Core Group IROC RI (QARC) must be submitted in Digital Imaging 
and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format. BMP ﬁles, JPG ﬁles, or hard 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (ﬁlms) are unacceptable fo r adequate interpretation of PET and CT with 
contrast scans. Imaging studies must be submitted electronically as outlined in the 
following paragraph. The images will be made available to study radiologists and 
nuclear medicine physicians for central review . 
 
Submission of Diagnostic Imaging data in DICOM format is required.  
Submission of the digital files and reports via TRIAD is preferred.  Instructions for 
TRIAD set up are below.  
 
Alternatively, the images and reports may be submitted via sFTP to IROC Rh ode 
Island. Digital data submission instructions including instructions for obtaining a 
sFTP account, can be found at http://irocri.qarc.org . Follow the link labeled digital

to transmit DICOM and DICOM RT files and other digital objects, such as reports. 
TRIAD de -identifies and validates the images as they are transferred.  
 
TRIAD Access Requireme nts: 
Site physics staff who will submit images through TRIAD will need to be 
registered with the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) and have a valid 
and active CTEP Identity and Access Management (IAM) account.  Please refer to 
CTEP Registration Proc edures of the protocol for instructions on how to request a 
CTEP -IAM account.  
To submit images, the site TRIAD user must be on the site roster and be assigned 
the 'TRIAD site user' role on the CTSU roster.  Users should contact [CONTACT_779]’s 
CTSU Administrato r or Data Administrator to request assignment of the TRIAD 
site user role.   
 
TRIAD Installations:  
 
When a user applies for a CTEP -IAM account with the proper user role, he/she 
will need to have the TRIAD application installed on his/her workstation to be able 
to submit images. TRIAD installation documentation can be found by [CONTACT_6758]://triadinstall.acr.org/triadclient/   
 
This process can be done in parallel to obtaining your CTEP -IAM account 
username [CONTACT_2383].

TRIAD Support mailbox at TRIAD -[EMAIL_085] . 
 
IROC Rhode Island (formerly QARC) will  facilitate the central reviews.  
 
For FDG -PET imaging, the transferred imaging data should include uncorrected 
and attenuation -corrected PET projection data, as well as the reconstructed PET or 
PET/CT images used by [CONTACT_6759] a response assessment. If low - 
dose CT was used for attenuation correction, the acquired CT images should also 
be submitted. The imaging data submitted for central review must allow the study 
to be reconstructed and displayed in transaxial, sagittal and coro nal formats using 
standard reconstruction techniques. Reconstructed MPEG clips and similar types 
of reconstructions will not be accepted. CT and MRI images similarly should be 
submitted in a format that either includes properly reconstructed multi -planar 
viewing formats in soft tissue and bone windows, or includes the thin -section axial 
acquisition data from which multi -planar reconstructions can be re -created.  
 
Sites not able to submit imaging electronically may submit imaging via CD.   CD’s 
may be sent by  [CONTACT_6760]:

8.4 Circulatin g Tumor DNA Study  (optional)  
 
 Sampling Schedule   
An initial sample was previously required at time of enrollment onto the 
APEC1621SC  screening  protocol. Two additional samples  (optional)  will be 
collected into Streck Cell -Free DNA  BCT tube s at the timepoi nts: 
(1) Cycle 5 Day 1  
(2) At disease  progres sion or end of protocol therapy (for patients receiving ≥ 5 
cycles of therapy only)  
 
Peripheral blood samples for circulating tumor DNA  should be obtained as 
follows:  
• For patients ≥ [ADDRESS_1125139]  20 mLs (10 mL per tube x 2 tubes)   
• For patients ≥ 5 kg but < [ADDRESS_1125140] 10  mL (one tube)  
• For patients <  5 kg researc h samples will not be collected   
 
In all cases, blood draw volumes should strictly adhere to institutional limitations , 
taking other bl ood draws into consideration.  However, if a reduction in volume is 
required, samples should be collected in 10 mL increments (ie . 0, 10, or [ADDRESS_1125141] is completely 
filled) . 
 
Established institutional guidelines  should be followed for blood collection via 
vascular access devices. Heparin should be avoided in pre -collection flush 
procedures. If therapeutic heparin dosing contamination is a possibility, 
venipuncture is recommended as a first choice collec tion method. If a Streck Cell-
Free DNA BCT tube immediately follows a heparin tube in the draw order, we 
recommend collecting an EDTA tube as a waste tube prior to collection in the 
Streck Cell -Free DNA BCT.  
 
For patients who do not have indwelling cathete rs, blood should be collected via 
venipuncture. To guard against backflow, observe the following precautions:  
 
• Keep patient’s arm in the downward position during the collection 
procedure.  
• Hold the tube with the stopper in the uppermost position so that the  tube 
contents do not touch the stopper or the end of the needle during sample 
collection.  
• Release tourniquet once blood starts to flow in the tube, or within 2 
minutes of application . 
• Fill tube completely.  
• Remove tube from adapter and immediately mix by [CONTACT_5237] [ADDRESS_1125142] 
results .  
• Store blood in Streck tube at room temperature  until shipment . 
 
 Sample Processing  
Samples do not need to be  processed at the collection site.

 Supplied by : [CONTACT_55396][INVESTIGATOR_812498],  CTEP, DCTD, NCI distributes 
tazemetostat.  
 
 Formulation  
Tazemetostat will be supplied as powder for oral suspension.  
Powder for oral suspension is supplied in 2 -gram and 7 -gram high -density 
polyethylene bottles contain ing only drug substance (no excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]). Reconstitute 
tazemetostat powder with Ora -sweet® , which will be provided by [CONTACT_779],  to 
produce tazemetostat 30 mg/mL oral suspension (based on free base content). 
Once reconstituted with Ora - sweet®, the suspension contains purified water, 
sucrose, glycerin, sorbitol, citric acid, sodium phosphate, methylparaben, 
potassium sorbate, and c itrus-berry flavoring. Once reconstituted, the suspension 
is pi[INVESTIGATOR_136416].  
- A site -supplied a press -in bottle adapter is required for use with an 
oral syringe for dosing purposes.  
Oral Suspension Preparation Instructions [Refer to Appendix IV  for the 
Tazemetostat Oral Suspension Preparation Worksheet and Guidance Table] :   
1) The oral suspension should be prepared in a biologic safety cabinet , personal 
protective equipment (PPE) should be worn during preparation as per 
institutional  guidelines . 

                                       THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY . SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY .    APEC1621C  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Vers ion Date: 06/15/2021   34 2) Determine the total number of tazemetostat powder for oral suspension bottles 
required to prepare 14 days of dosing (including overfill per institutional 
guidelines), while using a combination of bottle sizes to minimize waste.  
3) Determine the amount of Ora -Sweet® required: 32.5 mL is needed per gram of 
tazemetostat. Each 2 gram bottle requires 65 mL Ora -Sweet® and each 7 gram 
bottle requires 227.5 mL Ora -Sweet®.  
4) Select the appropriate size and number of empty medication bottles required.  
Choos e bottles that are large enough so that each bottle can be filled to 40 -80% 
of capacity to ensure adequate mixing. The medication bottles should be light 
protective, HDPE, PETE, or glass bottle with a child -resistant, liquid -tight 
closure.  Note: Use of a f unnel is helpful to transfer tazemetostat powder to the 
bottle containing Ora -Sweet  
5) Add the required amount of Ora -Sweet ® to each empty medication bottle.  
6) Transfer the appropriate amount of tazemetostat powder for oral suspension to 
the corresponding medication bottle containing Ora -Sweet ®. 
7) Tightly seal with cap and shake the bottle vigorously for 1 minute.  
8) Allow the bottle to rest for approximately 5 minutes then re -shake the bottle 
vigorously for an additional 1 minute.  
9) Remove the bottle cap and inspect visually for any unwetted powder.  If 
present, repeat steps 7 -8 above.  
10) Apply appropriate label(s) as required by [CONTACT_2371]/institution.  
11) The final concentration is 30 mg/mL.  
12) Assign a 21 -day expi[INVESTIGATOR_812499] 2 -8 °C (36 -46 °F) and protect from light.  
13) Instruct the patient or caregiver to shake the bottle for 1 minute prior to dosing.  
Avoid vigorous shaking due to foaming and allow sufficient time for any bubbles 
to dissi pate prior to measuring the dose. If multiple bottles are dispensed, daily 
shaking of all bottles is required to ensure the suspension stays properly 
suspended.  
 
 Storage  
Powder for oral suspension:  Do not store above 25°C (77°F). Protect from light.  
Once oral suspension is prepared, store refrigerated between 2 -8 °C (36 -46 °F) and 
protect from light. Brief excursion (less than 4 hours) up to 30°C is allowable for 
transfer from the clinic to home, but bottles must be immediately refrigerated upon 
arrival. A  cold pack may be provided to the patient as required.  
 
If a storage temperature excursion is identified, promptly return tazemetostat 
unreconstituted powder for oral suspension to below 25°C (77°F) and prepared 
oral suspension to 2 -8°C (36 -46 °F) and quar antine the supplies.  Provide a detailed 
report of the excursion (including documentation of temperature monitoring and 
duration of the excursion) to [EMAIL_087]  for determination of 
suitabil ity. 
 
 Stability  
Stability studies are ongoing. Powder for oral suspension is stable for 21 days 
following reconstitution under refrigerated storage conditions.

 Administration  
See Treatment  (Section 5.0 ) and Dose Modification  (Section 6.0 ) sections of the      
protocol.  
 
Tazemetostat will be given orally twice daily without regard to meals. The powder 
for suspension must be reconstituted prior to administration.  Doses must be taken 
twice per day with no less than 8 hours between each dose.  If vomit ing occurs after 
taking oral suspension formulation, the dose should NOT be repeated and the next 
dose should be administered at the regularly scheduled time.  
 
The oral suspension should be given by [CONTACT_812513].  Patients should drink additional water after administration (about 
4 ounces).  For feeding tube dosing, administer directly into the feeding tube with the 
syringe. Rinsing with [ADDRESS_1125144] dose of tazemetostat to the end of the study. Strong inhibitors and 
inducers of CYP2C8, 2D6, and P -gp should be used with caution.  
 
In vitro, tazemetostat inhibits CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A , P-
gp, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT3, MATE1, and MATE2K. . Tazemetostat also 
induces CYP3A4 and is a weak inducer of CYP1A, CYP2B6, and CYP2C9. 
Medications that are sensitive or narrow therapeutic range substrates of CYP3A, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6  should be avo ided if possible. Other 
substrates of CYP2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A, P -gp, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT3, 
MATE1, and MATE2K should be used with caution.  
 
No grapefruit juice, Seville oranges, or grapefruit can be consumed while on 
tazemetostat.  
 
 Patient care implica tions:  
Prolonged exposure to sunlight should be avoided during treatment with 
tazemetostat.  Patients should wear protective clothing, sunscreen, and avoid 
tanning beds.  Female subjects of childbearing potential should agree to remain

10.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM PROTOCOL THERAPY AND OFF STUDY 
CRITERIA  
 
10.1 Criteria for Removal from Protocol Therapy  
 
a) Clinical  (including physical examination or serum tumor markers) or radiographic 
evidence of progressive disease (See Section 12). 
b) Adverse Events requiring removal from protocol therapy (See Section 6). 
c) Refusal of protocol therapy by [CONTACT_4676]/parent/guardian  
d) Non-compliance that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_6712].  
e) Completion of 26 cycles  of therapy ;  
f) Physician determines it is not in the patient’s best interest.  
g) Repeated eligibility laboratory studies ( CBC with differential, bilirubin, ALT (SGPT) 
or serum creatinine)  are outside the parameters required for eligibility prior to the start 
of protocol therapy  (See Section 8.1 ). 
h) Study is terminated by [CONTACT_2728].  
i) Pregnancy  
j) Patient did not receive protocol treatment after study enrollment.  
 
Patie nts who are removed from  protocol therapy during cycle [ADDRESS_1125149] resolved per Section 13.4.4 , whichever happens 
LATER. The only exception is with documentation of the patient’s withdrawal of 
consent  from the  APEC1621SC  screening protocol . Patients who are removed from 
protocol therapy in subsequent cycles should have the necessary observations to 
ensure adequate clinical care.  
 
10.2 Follow -Up Data Submission and APEC1621SC Off Study Criteria  
Patients who are off subprotocol therapy will conti nue to  be followed on the APEC1621SC 
screening protocol. Follow -up data submission will occur until one of the APEC1621SC 
Off Study Criteria is met (See Section 10 of APEC1621SC for details). Ongoing adverse 
events, or adverse events that emerge after the patient is removed from protocol therapy, 
but within [ADDRESS_1125150] and CTEP -AERS (if applicable).  Follow -up data will be required until off study 
criteria are met unless consent i s withdrawn or the patient dies or is lost to follow -up. 
                                       THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY . SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY .    APEC1621C  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Vers ion Date: 06/15/2021   40  
11.0 STATISTICAL AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1 Sample Size  
APEC1621C will require a minimum of 20 evaluable patients  and a maximum of 49 
patients, allowing for 15% inevaluability. Assuming an enrollment rate of 4 -9 biomarker 
positive patients per year, the primary cohort of this subprotocol  is expected to be 
completed within 2.7-6 years . 
 
11.2 Dosing Considerations   
Please see Section 5.1  for a specific discussion of the dosing of tazemetostat to be used in 
this study , based on site of disease.    
 
11.3 Study Design  
The p rimary cohort will employ a single stage A’Hern designs of N=20. Tazemetostat  will 
be deemed worthy of further study in the relevant subset of patients (i.e. biomarker positive 
in any histology, biomarker positive in a particular histology, etc) if the decision rule is 
met. Operating characteristics are shown below.  
 
Cohort  N Decision Rule  Alpha  Power  
Primary biomarker positive  20 ≥ 3 responses  10% 90% 
 
Per amendment 3 B, Tazemetostat will be administered at a dose of 520 mg/m2/dose BID 
for patients without any CNS involvement; or 1200 mg/m2/dose BID for patients with CNS 
involvement. The response will be examined in the combined primary cohort consisting of 
patients with or without CNS involvement. Patients who enrolled pre -amendment #3 B 
treated with at 1200 mg/m2/dose BID and meet evaluatio n criteria will also be counted in 
the evaluation.  
 
Histology -specific biomarker positive expansion cohorts will, by [CONTACT_108], be deemed 
worthy of further study, since they will have at least 3 responses. The table below shows 
90% confidence intervals (W ilson method) for a range of observable response rates.  
 
Cohort Size  Observed Response Rate  90% Confidence Interval  
10 30% 13% - 56% 
10 40% 19% - 65% 
10 50% 27% - 73% 
 
 Primary Cohort :  
APEC1621C  will evaluate a primary cohort of 20 mutation -matched (“biomarker 
positive”) evaluable patients of any histology for the primary study  aim of 
determining the objective response rate (CR/PR according to  the response criteria  
in Section 12.3 ) to tazemetostat . Using an A’He rn design8 with alpha=10%, a 
sample of N=20 will provide 90% power to detect an improvement in response 
rate from 5%, if the treatment is ineffective, to 25% if the targeted therapy is 
sufficiently effective to warrant further study. If there are at least 3 response s out 
of 20  in the primary cohort , the biomarker/therapy match will be deemed a success.  
 
If at any time, there is one occurrence of secondary T -cell lymphomas in patients 
exposed to tazemetostat, we will suspend the accrual and  consider dose, schedule 
                                       THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY . SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY .    APEC1621C  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Vers ion Date: 06/15/[ADDRESS_1125151] to the protocol.  
 
 Histology -Specific Biomarker Positive Expansion Cohorts:  
If ≥ 3 patients in the primary cohort with the same histology show signs of 
objective response (CR/PR  according to  the response criteria  in Section 12.3 ), a 
histology -specific biomarker positive  expansion  cohort will open after the primary 
cohort is completed to up to [ADDRESS_1125152] of target tumor histologies/types.  
 
We will open up to 3 such expansion cohorts for biomarker positive patients (i.e., 
if [ADDRESS_1125153] ≥ 3 responses, we will open a total of 3 expansion cohorts as 
described above). Note that this can only happen if the response rate in the primary 
cohort is at least 45% (9/20) and there cannot be more than [ADDRESS_1125154] response of PR or CR on the study.  Response rates will be calculated as the 
percent of evaluable patients who  are responders,  and confidence intervals will be 
constructed  using the Wilson score interval method.9 Decision making for A’Hern design 
cohorts will follow rules described above.  
 
Toxicity tables will be constructed to summarize the observed incidence by [CONTACT_400737] e of toxicity  
and grade . A patient will be counted only once for a given toxicity for the worst grade of 
that toxicity reported for that patient.  Toxicity information recorded will include the type, 
severity, time of onset, time of resolution, and the prob able association with the study 
regimen.   
 
11.[ADDRESS_1125155] one dose of protocol therapy will 
be considered evaluable for response. Any patient who receives non -protocol anti -cancer 
thera py during the response evaluation period will be considered a non -responder for the 
purposes of the statistical rule, unless they show an objective response prior to receiving 
the non -protocol anti -cancer therapy (in which case they will be considered a re sponder). 
Patients who demonstrate a complete or partial response confirmed by [CONTACT_6770] a response. When opening expansion cohorts, t he 
evaluation  period for determination of best response will be [ADDRESS_1125156] a response (CR or PR) must have imaging studies rev iewed centrally at the COG. 
Centers will be notified by [CONTACT_6771] s table disease.

Vers ion Date: 06/15/2021   42 11.7 Progression free survival  (PFS)  
Progression free survival will be defined as time from the initiation of protocol treatment 
to the occurrence of any of the following events: disease progression or disease recurrence 
or death from any cause. All patients surviving at the time of analyses without events will 
be censored at their last follow -up date.  
 
PFS along with the confidence intervals will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method. 
Patients with local calls of disease progression  (i.e. ca lls made by [CONTACT_6773]) , 
will be counted as having had an event , even if the central review does not declare 
progression. We will also report PFS based on central radiology review as a secondary 
analysis, if adequate number of disagreements i n progressions exist between the treating 
institution s and the central radiology review to make such an analysis meaningful.     
 
11.8 Correlative Studies  
A descriptive analysis of the exploratory aims described in Section 1.3  will be performed 
and will be summarized with simple summary statistics. All of these analyses will be 
descriptive in nature.  
 
11.9 Gender and Minority Accrual Estimates  
The gender and minority distribution of the study population is expected to be:

12.2 Progression -Free Survival  
                                       THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY . SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY .    APEC1621C  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Vers ion Date: 06/15/2021   43 Progression -free survival ( PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of subprotocol  
treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.  
 
Development  of new disea se or progression in any established lesions is considered 
progressive disease, regardless of response in other lesions – e.g., when multiple lesions 
show opposite responses, the progressive disease takes precedence.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_1125159] had their disease re -evaluated after 
one dose of protocol therapy.  In addition to t he scheduled scans, a confirmat ory scan 
should be obtained on the next consecutive cycle  following initial docume ntation of 
objective response.  
 
As outlined, patients will be assigned to one of the following categories for assessment of 
response:  a) solid tumor (non-CNS) and measurable disease ( Section 12.4 ); b) 
neuroblast oma with MIBG positive lesions ( Section 12.5 ); c) CNS tumor  (Section 12. 7); 
and d)  non-Hodgkin  lymphoma/hystiocytosis  (Section 12. 8). Note: Neuroblastoma patients 
who do not have MIBG positive lesions should be assessed for response as solid tumor 
patients with measurable disease . 
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the revised Response 
Evaluation Criteria in  Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca  45:228 -
247, 2009].  Key points are that [ADDRESS_1125160]  
diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions but the shortest  diameter of 
maligna nt lymph nodes are used in the RECIST v 1.1 criteria.  
 
 Definitions  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluable for objective response : Eligible patients who receive at least 
one dose of protocol therapy will be considered evaluable for response. 
Evaluable patients who demonstrate  a complete or partial response 
confirmed by [CONTACT_6774] -protocol anti -cancer 
therapy will be considered a responder. All other evaluable patients will 
be considered non -responders.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response : Eligible patients who have 
lesions present at baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the 
definitions of measurable disease and have received at least one dose of 
protocol therapy will be considered evaluable for non -target disease. 
The response assessm ent is based on the presence, absence, or 
unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
 Disease Parameters  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Measurable disease : Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be 
recorded) as ≥ [ADDRESS_1125161] x -ray, as ≥ [ADDRESS_1125162] scan, or ≥ [ADDRESS_1125163] be 
recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
                                       THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY . SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY .    APEC1621C  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Vers ion Date: 06/15/2021   44 Note :  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area 
might or might not be considered measurable. If the  investigator 
thinks it appropriate to include them, the conditions under which 
such lesions should be considered must be defined in the 
protocol.    
[IP_ADDRESS] Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_1125164] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline 
and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-measurable disease : All other lesions (or sites of disease), i ncluding 
small lesions (longest diameter <  10 mm or pathological lymph nodes 
with ≥ 10 to <  15 mm short axis), are considered non -measurable 
disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonit is, 
inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_13191]), are considered as non -measurable.  
 
Note:   Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined 
simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions 
(neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent 
cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they 
meet the definition of measurability described above. However, 
if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are 
preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Target lesions : All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per 
organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, shoul d 
be identified as target lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with 
the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in 
addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion 
does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance 
the next largest lesion that can be measured reproducibly should be 
selected.   A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short 
axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then only the short axis is added in to the sum.  The 
baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize 
any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the 
disease.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-target lesions : All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any 
measura ble lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be 
identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, 
absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each  should be 
noted throughout follow -up.  
 
 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
                                       THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY . SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY .    APEC1621C  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Vers ion Date: 06/15/2021   45 All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_99237](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
 Clinical lesions :  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they 
are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and  10 mm 
diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin 
lesions, documentation  by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate 
the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
 Chest x -ray:  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when 
they are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is 
preferabl e.  
 
 Conventional CT and MR I:  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on 
CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_1125165] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for 
a measurable lesion sho uld be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also 
acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans). Ideally, the same type 
of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be 
followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  
 
 PET-CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a 
combined PET -CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use 
with RECIST measurements.  However, if the site can document that the 
CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical  diagnostic quality to a 
diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -
CT can be used for RECIST  or International Pediatric non -Hodgkin 
Lymphoma Response Criteria  measurements and can be used 
interchangeably with conventional CT  in accurately measuring cancer 
lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT 
introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not 
routinely or serially performed.   
 
 Tumor markers : Tumor markers alone cannot be used t o assess response.  If 
markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize 
for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
 Cytology,  Histology:  These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR)  and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual 
lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual 
benign tumors can remain).  
 
 Cytology should be obtained if an effusion appears or worsens during 
treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease.

Vers ion Date: 06/15/2021   46 
 FDG-PET: While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is 
sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to 
complement CT scanning in assessment of progressi on (particularly 
possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging 
can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
 
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -
up is a sign of PD based on a new lesion.  
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of 
disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at 
follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on C T, additional 
follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly 
progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date 
of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at 
follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing  site of disease on CT that is 
not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
 
 Note :  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one that is FDG avid 
with an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue 
on the attenuation cor rected image.  
 
             For patients with a positive PET scan at diagnosis, PET can be 
used to follow response in addition to a CT scan using the 
International Pediatric non -Hodgkin Lymphoma Response 
Criteria.10 
 
12.4 Response Criteria for Patients with Solid Tumor and Measurable Disease  
 
 Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response  (CR) : Disappearance of all target and non -target 
lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether 
target or non -target) must have reduction in short 
axis to <[ADDRESS_1125166] be detected by [CONTACT_6777].  
Normalization of urinary catecholamines or other 
tumor markers if elevated at study enrollment (for 
patients with neuroblastoma).  
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
baseline sum diameters  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
smallest sum on study (this inc ludes the baseline 
sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition 
to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
(Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions 
                                       THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY . SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY .    APEC1621C  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Vers ion Date: 06/15/2021   47 is also considered progressions) . Note:  in 
presence of SD or PR in target disease but 
unequivocal progression in non -target or non -
measurable disease, the patient has PD  if there is 
an overall level of substantial worsening in non -
target disease such that the overall tumor burden 
has inc reased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy  
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as 
reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study  
 
 Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph 
nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis)  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the 
upper normal limit, the y must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical 
response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) 
and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above 
the normal limits  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non -target 
lesions.  Unequivocal progression  should not 
normally trump target lesion status.  It must be 
representative of overall disease status change, 
not a single lesion increase.

Vers ion Date: 06/15/2021   49  
 
 
 The following criteria will be used to report MIBG response by [CONTACT_6778]:  
 
Complete response :  Complete resolution of all MIBG positive lesions  
Partial Response :  Resolution of at least one MIBG positive lesion, with 
persistence of other MIBG positive lesions  
Stable disease :  No change in MIBG scan in number of positive lesions  
Progressive disease : Development of new MIBG positive lesions  
 
 The response of MIBG lesions will be assessed on central review using the Curie 
scale14 as outlined below. Central review responses will be used to assess efficacy 
for study endpoint. See Section 8.2  for details on transferrin g images to the 
Imaging Research Center.  
 
NOTE: This scoring should also be done by [CONTACT_6779].  
 
The body is divided into 9 anatomic sectors for osteomedullary lesions, with a 10th 
general sector allocated for any extra -osseous lesion visible on MIBG scan . In each 
region, the lesions are scored as follows. The absolute extension score is graded 
as:  
0 = no site per segment,  
1 = 1 site per segment,  
2 = more than one site per segmen t,  
3 = massive involvement (>50% of the segment).  
 
 
The absolute score is obtained by [CONTACT_6780]. See 
diagram of sectors below:  
 
 
The relative score is calculated by [CONTACT_812514] -treatment absolute score. The relative score of each 
patient is calculated at each response assessment compared to baseline and

12.6 Response Criteria for Neuroblastoma Patients with Bone Marrow Involvement  
 
 Bone Marrow Involvement  
Note: patients with bone marrow as the ONLY site of disease are not eligible for 
this study. Response criteria in this section are intended to be used when 
assessing marrow involvement as a component of overall response.  
 
Histologic analysis at the local instit ution of marrow tumor cell involvement is 
required for patients with a history of marrow involvement. Marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_6715] 2 cycles thereafter. Note: If 
progressive disease is documented by [CONTACT_6784], then a repeat BM is not needed to confirm PD.  
 
Complete Response :  No tumor cells detectable by [CONTACT_6785] 2 
consecutive bilateral bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_812501] . SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY .    APEC1621C  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Vers ion Date: 06/15/[ADDRESS_1125168] 21 days  apart. Normalization of urinary 
catecholamines or other tumor markers if elevated at 
study enrollment.  
 
Progressive Disease :  In patients who enroll with neuroblastoma in bone 
marrow by [CONTACT_6786] a doubling in the amo unt of tumor in the marrow AND 
a minimum of 25% tumor in bone marrow by 
[CONTACT_5293]. (For example, a patient entering with 5% 
tumor in marrow by [CONTACT_6787] ≥ 25% 
tumor to have progressive disease; a patient entering with 
30% tumor must incr ease to > 60%).  
 
In patients who enroll without evidence of neuroblastoma 
in bone marrow will be defined as progressive disease if 
tumor is detected in [ADDRESS_1125169] 21 days  apart.  
 
 
Stable Disease : Persist ence of tumor in bone marrow that does not meet 
the criteria for either complete response or progressive 
disease.  
 
 Overall Best Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to his “best response” for the purposes of 
analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined from the sequence of the 
overall response assessments as  described in Section 12.[ADDRESS_1125170] CNS tumors, only one lesion/mass is present and therefore is considered 
a “target” for measurement/follow up to assess for tumor progression/response. If 
multiple measurable lesions are present, up to 5 should be selected as “target” 
lesions. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of size and su itability for 
accurate repeated measurements. All other lesions will be followed as non -target 
lesions. The lower size limit of the target lesion(s) should be at least twice the 
thickness of the slices showing the tumor to decrease the partial volume effec t 
(e.g., 8 mm lesion for a 4 mm slice).

Vers ion Date: 06/15/[ADDRESS_1125171] perpendicular diameter. Development of new disease or progression in any 
established lesions is considered progressive disease, regardless of response in 
other lesions – e.g., when multiple lesions show opposite responses, the 
progressive disease takes precedence. Response Criteria for target lesions:  
 
• Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Off all steroids 
with stable or improving neurologic examination.  
 
• Partial response (PR):  ≥ 50% decrease in the sum of the products of the two 
perpendicular diameters of all target lesions (up to 5), taking as reference the 
initial baseline measurements ; on a stable or decreasing dose of steroids with 
a stable or improving neurologic examinati on. 
 
• Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient decrease in the sum of the products of 
the two perpendicular diameters of all target lesions to qualify for PR, nor 
sufficient increase in a single target lesion to qualify for PD; on a stable or 
decreasing dose  of steroids with a stable or improving neurologic examination.  
 
• Progressive Disease (PD):  25% or more increase in the  sum of the products 
of the  perpendicular diameters of the target lesion s, taking as reference the 
smallest sum of the product s observed since the start of treatment, or the 
appearance of one or more new lesions.  
 
Increasing doses of corticosteroids required to maintain stable neurological 
status should be strongly considered a s a sign of clinical progression unless in 
the context of recent wean or transient neurologic change due e.g. to radiation 
effects.   
 
 Response Criteria for Non -Target Lesions:  
 
• Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions.  
 
• Incomplete Re sponse/Stable Disease (IR/SD):  The persistence of one or 
more non -target lesions.  
 
• Progressive Disease (PD):  The appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions.  
 
 Response criteria for tumor markers (if a vailable):  
Tumor markers will be classified simply as being at normal levels or at abnormally 
high levels.  
 
 Overall Response Assessment  
The overall response assessment takes into account response in both target and 
non-target lesions, the appearance of new lesions and normalization of markers 
(where applicable), according to the criteria described in the table below. The

Each patient will be classified according to his “best response” for the purposes of 
analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined as outlined in Section 
12.9 from a sequence of overall response assessments.    
12.8 Response Criteria for Patients with non-Hodgkin  Lymphoma/Histiocytosis  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by [CONTACT_6788]-Hodgkin 
Lymphoma Criteria10, with modification from  the Lugano classification .11 
 
 Disease Parameters  
 
 Measurable disease : A measurable node must have an LDi (longest 
diameter) greater than 1.[ADDRESS_1125173] be 
recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
 Non-measured di sease : All other lesions (including nodal, extranodal, and 
assessable disease) should be followed as nonmeasured disease (e.g., 
cutaneous, GI, bone, spleen, liver, kidneys, pleural or pericardial 
effusions, ascites) .   
 
 Target lesions : For patients staged with CT, up to six of the largest target 
nodes, nodal masses, or other lymphomatous lesions that are measurable 
in two diameters (longest diameter [LDi] and shortest diameter) should 
be identified from different body regions representative of the patient’s  
overall disease burden and include mediastinal and retroperitoneal 
disease, if involved.  
 
 Evaluation of Measurable Disease

Vers ion Date: 06/15/[ADDRESS_1125174] or MRI should be free of residual mass or 
evidence of new disease. FDG -PET should be negative . 
 
Complete Response Unconfirmed  (CRu)  
Residual mass is negative by [CONTACT_6789] -PET; no new  lesions by [CONTACT_6790]; 
no new and/or progressive disease elsewhere  
 
Partial Response  (PR)  
50% decrease in SPD (the sum of the products of the largest diameter and the 
perpendicular diameter for a tumor mass ) on CT or MRI; FDG -PET may be 
positive (Deauville score or 4 or 5 with reduced lesional uptake compared with 
baseli ne); no new and/or PD; morphologic evidence of dis ease may be present in 
BM if present at diagnosis; however, there should be 50% reduction in percentage 
of lymphoma cells . 
 
No Response (Stable Disease)  
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor su fficient increase to qualify for 
PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
 
Progressive disease  
For those with > 25% increase in SPD on CT or MRI, Deauville score 4 or 5 on 
FDG -PET with increase in lesional uptake from baseline, or development of new 
morphologic evidence of disease in BM   
 
 Evaluation of Non -measured  Lesions  (CT-based response, PET/CT based 
response not applicable)11 
 
Complete Response (CR) : Absent non -measured  lesions .  
 
Partial response (PR) : Absent/normal, regressed, lesions, but no increase.

Progressive Disease (PD) : In the setting of splenomegaly, the splenic length 
must  increase by 50% of the extent of its prior 
increase  beyond b aseline.  If no prior splenomegaly, 
must increase by [CONTACT_120187] 2 cm from baseline .

patient’s overall best response. Two objective status determinations of CR before 
progression are required for best response of CR. Two determinations of PR or better 
before progression, but not qualifying for a CR, a re required for a best response of PR. 
Two determinations of stable/no response or better before progression, but not qualifying 
as CR or PR, are required for a best response of stable/no response; if the first objective 
status is unknown, only one such de termination is required. Patients with an objective 
status of progression on or before the second evaluations (the first evaluation is the first 
radiographic evaluation after treatment has been administered) will have a best response of 
progressive disease . Best response is unknown if the patient does not qualify for a best 
response of progressive disease and if all objective statuses after the first determination and 
before progression are unknown.  
 
 Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The 
patient's best response a ssignment will depend on the achievement of both 
measurement and confirmation criteria.

until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented 
(taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started).

measurements.  
 
13.0  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING RE QUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event data collection and reporting which are required as part of every clinical trial, are 
done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future 
studies using similar agents.  Adverse events are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times 
during a trial.  (Please follow directions for routine reporting provided in the Case Report Forms  
for this protocol).  Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner to 
allow for optimal monitoring of patient safety and care.  The following sections provide information 
about expedited reporting.  
 
 
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the patient has 
received an investigational or commercial agent; 2) whether the adverse event is considered serious; 
3) the grade  (severity); and 4) whether or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6716].  
 
An investigational agent  is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational New Drug 
Application (IND).  In some instances, the investigational agent may be available commercially, 
but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved package label.  
 
13.1 Expedited Reporting Requirements  – Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
 
Any AE that is serious qualifies for expedited reporting . An AE is defined as any 
untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not 
considered drug related. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any adverse drug event 
(experience) occurring at any dose that results in ANY of the following outcomes:  
 
1) Death.  
2) A life -threatening adverse drug experience.  
3) An adverse event resulting in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6717] (for ≥  24 hours). This does not include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6718].  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal lif e functions.  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, 
or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience 
when, based upon medical judgment, they m ay jeopardize the patient or subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition.  
 
 Reporting Requirements  - Investigator Responsibility  
Clinical investigat ors in the treating institutions and ul timately the Study Chair 
have the primary responsibility for AE identification, documentation, grading, and 
assignment of attribution to the investigational agent/intervention.  It is the 
responsibility of the  treating physician to supply the medical docume ntation 
needed to support the expedited AE reports in a timely manner.  
                                       THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY . SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY .    APEC1621C  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Vers ion Date: 06/15/2021   57  
Note: All expedited AEs (reported via CTEP -AERS) must also be reported via 
routine reporting. Routine reporting is accomplished via the Adverse Event (AE) 
Case Report Form (CRF) withi n the study database.   
 
 CTEP -AERS Expedited Reporting Methods  
Expedited AE reporting for this study must only use CTEP -AERS  (Adverse Event 
Expedited  Reporting  System),  accessed  via the CTEP  home  page  https://ctepcore
.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers/pages/task  
 
Send supporting documentation to the NCI by [CONTACT_6791] (fax# [PHONE_9535] ) and by 
[CONTACT_812515] [EMAIL_7936]  and to the APEC16 -
21C COG Study Assigned Research Coordinator.  ALWAYS include the ticket 
number on all faxed and emailed documents . 
 
13.2 Steps to Determine If an Adverse Event Is To Be Reported In an Expedited Manner  
 
Step 1 : Identify  the type of adverse event using the  current version of the  NCI CTCAE  v5.  
The description s and grading scales found in the current version of the  CTCAE  
v5.[ADDRESS_1125176] 
access to a copy of the CTCAE  v5.0.  A copy of the CTCAE  v5.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP website ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
 
Step 2 :  Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE  v5. 
 
Step 3:  Review Table A  in this section to determine if:  
• the adverse event is considered serious;  
• there are any protocol -specific requirements for expedited reporting of specific 
adverse events that requir e special monitoring ; and/or  
• there are any protocol -specific exceptions  to the reporting requirements.   
 
• Any medical event equivalent to CTCAE  v5 grade 3, 4, or 5 that precipi[INVESTIGATOR_6719] (or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) must be rep orted regardless 
of attribution and design ation as expected or unexpected with the exception of any 
events identified as proto col-specific expedited  adverse  event  reporting  exclusions.  
• Any event that results in persistent or significant disabilities/incapacities, congenital 
anomalies, or birth defects must be reported via CTEP -AERS  if the event occurs 
following treatment with an agent under a CTEP IND.  
• Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol -specific patient ID provided during trial 
registration on all reports.  
• As referenced in the CTEP Adverse Events Reporting Requirements, an AE that 
resolves and then recurs during a subsequent cycle does not require CTEP -AERS 
reporting unless ( 1) the Grade increases; or (2) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6720].  
• Some adverse events require notification within 24 hours  (refer to Table A) to NCI via 
the web at http://ctep.cancer.gov  (telephone C TEP at: [PHONE_101]  within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the event if the CTEP -AERS 24 -Hour Notification web -based 
application is unavailable) . Once internet connectivity is restored, a [ADDRESS_1125177] be entered electronically into CTEP-AERS  by [CONTACT_6793].  
• When the adverse event requires expedited reporting, submit the report within 5 or 7 
                                       THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY . SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY .

13.4 Definition of Onset and Resolution of Adverse Events  
  
Note:  These guidelines below are for reporting adverse events on the COG case report  
forms and do not alter the guidelines for CTEP -AERS  reporting.  
 
 If an adverse event occurs more than once in a course (cycle) of therapy only the 
most severe grade of the event should be reported.  
 
 If an adverse event progresses through several grades during one course of 
therapy, only the most severe grade should be reported.  
 
 The duration of the AE is defined as the duration of the highest (most severe) 
grade of the Adver se Effects.  
 
 The resolution date of the AE is defined as the date at which the AE returns to 
baseline  or less than or equal to Grade 1, whichever level is higher  (note that the 
resolution date may therefore be different from the date at which the grade of  the 
AE decreased from its highest grade).  If the AE does not return to baseline the 
resolution date should be recorded as "ongoing."   
 
 An adverse event that persists from one course to another should only be reported 
once unless the grade becomes more s evere in a subsequent course. An adverse 
event which resolves and then recurs during a different course, must be reported 
each course it recurs.  
                                       THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY . SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY .    APEC1621C  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Vers ion Date: 06/15/2021   60  
13.5 Other Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_414553] -AERS  reporting ( Section 13.2 ) 
should be reported at the end of each cycle using the forms provided in the CRF  
packet (See Section 14.1 ). 
 Adverse events determined to be reportable must also be reported according to  
the local policy and procedures to the Institutional Review Board responsible for 
oversight of the patient.  
 
13.6 Specific Examples for Expedited Reporting  
 
 Reportable Categories of Death  
• Death attributable to a CTCAE  v5.0 term.  
• Death Neonatal: A disorder characterized by “Newborn deaths occurring during 
the first 28 days after birth.”  
• Sudden Death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of the 
onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be attri buted 
to a CTCAE  v5.0 term associated with Grade 5.  
• Death NOS: A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE  v5.0 term 
associated with Grade 5.  
• Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “ Disease 
Progression ” under the syst em organ class (SOC) of “General Disorders and 
Administration Site Conditions .” Evidence that the death was a manifestation 
of underlying disease ( e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or 
progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) should be 
submitted.  
 
• Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_1125181] dose, regardless of attribution to 
the investigational agent/inte rvention requires expedited reporting within 24 
hours.  
 
• Any death that occurs more than [ADDRESS_1125182] dose of treatment with 
an investigational agent which can be attributed (possibly, probably, or 
definitely) to the agent and is not clearly due to progressive disease must be 
reported via CTEP -AERS per the timelines outlined in the table above.  
 
 Reporting Secondary Malignancy  
 
Secondary Malignancy :  
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy 
(e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or 
chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the 
initial neoplasm. The occurrence of T -cell lymphoma should be reported via

APEC1621C  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Vers ion Date: 06/15/2021   61 CTEP requires all secondary  malignancies that occur following treatment with an 
agent under an NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP -AERS . Three options are 
available to describe the event:  
1) Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy  (e.g., acute 
myelocytic leukemia [AML])   
2) Myelodysplastic syndrome  (MDS)   
3) Treatment -related secondary malignancy.  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) 
should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms o utlined in each 
protocol.  
 
Second Malignancy:  
A second malignancy  is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and 
is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second malignancies require 
ONLY routine reporting via CDUS unless otherwise specified.  
 
 
 Reporting Pregnancy,  Pregnancy Loss , and Death Neonatal  
When submitting CTEP -AERS reports for “Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, or 
“Neonatal  loss”,  the Pregnancy  Information  Form , available  at: https://ctep.cance
r.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/PregnancyReportFormU
pdated.pdf , needs to be completed and faxed a long with any additional medical 
information to ([PHONE_16940] . The potential risk of exposure of the fetus to the 
investigational agent should be documented in the “Description of Event” section 
of the CTEP -AERS report.  
 
Pregnancy  
Patients who become preg nant on study risk intrauterine exposure of the fetus to 
agents that may be teratogenic. For this reason, pregnancy needs to be reported in 
an expedited manner via CTEP -AERS  as Grade 3 “Pregnancy, puerperium and 
perinatal conditions - Other (pregnancy )” under the Pregnancy, puerperium and 
perinatal conditions SOC . 
 
Pregnancy needs to be followed until the outcome  of the pregnancy  is known  at 
intervals deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_6795]. The “Pregnancy Information 
Form” should be used for all necessary follow -ups. This form is available at 
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/Pregn
ancyReportForm.pdf . If the baby [CONTACT_170727] a birth defect or anomaly, then a 
second CTEP -AERS report is required.  
 
Pregnancy Loss ( Fetal Death ) 
Pregnancy loss is d efined in CTCAE v5.0 as “Death in utero.”  
 
Any pregnancy loss  needs to be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 “Pregnancy  
loss” under the  “puerperium and perinatal conditions ” SOC . Do NOT report a  
pregnancy loss  as a Grade 5 event since  CTEP -AERS  recognizes any Grade 5 
event as a patient death.  
 
Death Neonatal  
Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE  v5.0 as Newborn deaths occurring during the 
                                       THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY . SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY .

Vers ion Date: 06/15/[ADDRESS_1125183] 28 days after birth ” that is felt by [CONTACT_414582]/intervention, should be  reported expeditiously, as 
Grade 4 “Death Neonatal ” under the system organ class (SOC) of “ General 
disorders and administration site condition s.” When the death is the result of a 
patient pregnancy or pregnancy in partners of men on study . Do NOT report 
a neonatal death resulting from a patient pregnancy or pregnancy in partners of 
men on study  as a Grade 5 event since CTEP -AERS  recognizes any Grade 5 event 
as a patient death.

APPENDIX III -B:  PATIENT DRUG INFORMATION HANDOUT AND WALLET CARD  
 
Information for Patients , Their Caregivers and Non -Study Healthcare Team  on Possible 
Interactions with Other Drugs and Herbal Supplements   
 
The patient ____________________________ is enrolled on a clinical trial using the experimental 
study drug , tazemetostat .  This clinical trial is sponsored by [CONTACT_29630].  This 
form is addressed to the patient but includes important info rmation for others who care for this 
patient.  
 
These are the things that you as a healthcare provider  need to know:  
  
Tazemetostat  interacts with certain specific enzyme(s) in your liver and certain transport proteins 
that help move drugs in and out of cells.  
 
• The enzymes in question are CYP3A, 2C8, 2D6, 2C9, and 2C19 .   
• Tazemetostat is broken down by [CONTACT_097]3A, 2C8, and 2D6 , and may be affected by [CONTACT_812519] s. Treatment with strong inhibitors or inducers 
of CYP3A are prohibited from [ADDRESS_1125193] dose of tazemetostat to the end 
of the study.  
• Tazemetostat inhibits CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6 and may affect other drugs 
that are broken down by [CONTACT_36918].   
• Tazemetostat induces CYP3A4 and may affect other drugs that are broken down by [CONTACT_128088].  
• The protein s in question are P-gp, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT3, MATE1, and 
MATE2K .  
• Tazemetostat is moved in and out of cells/organs by P-gp and may be affected by [CONTACT_812520].  
• Tazemetostat inhibits P -gp, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT3, MATE1, and MATE2K and 
may affect other drugs that require them to move in and out of cells.  
 
To the patient: Take  this paper with you to your medical appointments and keep the attached 
information card in your wallet .   
 
Tazemetostat  may interact with other  drugs  which can cause side effects. For this reason, it is very 
important to tell your study doctors of any medicines you are taking before you  enroll onto this 
clinical trial .  It is also very important to tell your doctors if you stop taking any regular medic ines, 
or if you start taking a new medicine while you take part in this study.  When you talk about your 
current medications with your doctor s, include medicine you buy without a prescription (over -the-
counter remedy), or any herbal supplements such as St.  John’s Wort.  It is helpful to bring your 
medication bottles or an updated medication list with you.  
 
Many health care providers  can write prescriptions.  You must tell all of your health care providers 
(doctors, physician assistants , nurse practitioners , pharmacists ) you are taking part in a clinical 
trial.

These are the things that you and they need to know:  
 
Tazemetostat must be used very carefully with other medicines that use certain liver enzymes or 
transport proteins to be effective or to be clea red from your system.  Before you enroll onto the 
clinical trial, your study doctor will work with your regular health care providers to review any 
medicines and herbal supplements that are considered “strong inducers/inhibitors of CYP3A, 2C8, 
2D6, or P -gp; or substrates of CYP3A, 2C8, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19 , P-gp, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT3, 
MATE1, or MATE2K .” 
 
• Please be very careful!  Over -the-counter drugs  (including herbal supplements)  may 
contain ingredients that could interact with your study drug .  Speak to your doctors or 
pharmacist to determine if there could be any side effects.   
• No grapefruit juice, Seville oranges, or grapefruit can be consumed while on tazemetostat.  
• Avoid prolon ged exposure to the sun and wear protective clothing and sunscreen when out 
in the sun.  
• Your regular health care provider s hould check a frequently updated medical reference or 
call your study doctor before prescribing any new medicine or discontinuing any 
medicine .  Your study doctor’s name [CONTACT_832]

FORMULATION)  
 
Drug doses should be adjusted based on the BSA calculated from height and weight measured within 7 
days prior to the beginning of each cycle.  Shake the bottle for one minute before you take tazemetostat; 
do not shake too much if there are bubbles wait for them  to dissipate before measuring the dose. Note: If 
multiple bottles are dispensed, daily shaking of all bottles is required to ensure the suspension stays 
properly suspended. Store your oral suspension in the refrigerator.  
 
Patients who experience dose -limiting toxicity should have their dose reduced by 25% so that patients 
receive 75% of the original administered  dose.  A site -supplied  press -in bottle adapter is required for 
use with an oral syringe for dosing purposes.

APPENDIX IX YOUTH INFORMATION SHEETS  
INFORMATION SHEET REGARDING RESEARCH STUDY A PEC1621C  
(For Children from 7 through 12 Years of A ge) 
A study of Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (MATCH) in children  
with a cancer that has come back after treatment or is difficult to treat  
 
1. We have been talking with you about your cancer.  You have had treatment for the cancer already 
but it did not go  away or it came back after treatment.  
 
2. We are asking you to take part in a research study because other treatments did not get rid of the 
cancer. A research study is when doctors work together to try out new ways to help people who are 
sick. In this stud y, we are trying to learn more about how to treat the kind of cancer that you have.  
 
3. You agreed to be part of a study to  see if your cancer has any specific changes that could help us 
decide what medicine might “match” best to your cancer.  
 
4. We have found a medicine called tazemetostat that could “match” your tumor. The doctors want to 
see if tazemetostat will help children with your type of cancer get better . We don’t know if 
tazemetostat will work well to get rid of your cancer. That is why we are doing t he study.  
 
5. Sometimes good things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These good things 
are called “benefits.” We hope that a benefit to you of being part of this study is that tazemetostat 
may cause your cancer to stop growing or to shr ink for a period of time but we don’t know for sure 
if there is any benefit of being part of this study.  
 
6. Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These bad things 
are called “risks.” The risks to you from this study are  that you may have problems, or side effects  
from tazemetostat. There may be risks  that we don’t know about.  
 
7. Your family can choose to be part of this study or not. Your family can also decide to stop being 
in this study at any time once you start. There may be other treatments for your cancer  that your 
doctor can tell you about.  
8. If you decide to be treated with  tazemetostat you might  have some tests and check -ups done more 
often that you might if you weren’t part of the study.  
 
9. As part of the study we are also trying to learn more about children’s cancers and how 
tazemetostat works  in them. We will draw some extra blood samples for this if your family 
agrees.

INFORMATION SHEET REGARDING RESEARCH STUDY A PEC1621C  
(For Teens from  13 through  17 Years of Age) 
A study of Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (MATCH) in children  
with a cancer that has come back aft er treatment or is difficult to treat  
 
1. We have been talking with you about your cancer. You have had treatment for the cancer already but 
the cancer did not go away or it came back after treatment .  
 
2. We are asking you to take part in a research study  because other treatments did not get rid of the cancer . 
A research study is when doctors work together to try out new ways to help people who are sick. In this 
study, we are trying to learn more about how to treat the kind of cancer that you have.  
 
3. The main  purpose of this study is to learn how well cancers  that have specific changes (mutations) 
respond to medicines that are aimed at  those changes. This combination of a tumor with a mutation and 
a medicine  that aims at that mutation is called a “matc h”. 
 
4.  Your  tumor has a mutation that matches tazemetostat, and so you have been assigned to tazemetostat . 
The doctors want to see if tazemetostat will make children with your type of cancer get better.  We don’t 
know if tazemetostat will work well to get rid of your cancer. That is why we are doing the study.  
 
5.  You will get tazemetostat by [CONTACT_6816] a 28 -day period. This entire 28 -day period is called 
a cycle. You may continue to receive tazemetostat for up to about 24 mont hs (approximately 26  cycles) 
as long as you do not have bad effects from it and your cancer does not get any worse. If you decide to 
be treated with tazemetostat , you will also have exams and tests done that are part of normal cancer 
care.  Some of these  may be done more often while you are being treated with tazemetostat . The doctors 
want to see if tazemetostat will help children  or adolescents  with your type of cancer get better. We 
don’t know if tazemetostat  is better than other medicines. That is why we are doing this study.  
 
6. Sometimes good things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These good things are 
called “benefits.” We hope that a benefit to you of being part of this study is that tazemetostat may 
cause your cancer to stop g rowing or to shrink for a period of time but we don’t know for sure if there 
is any benefit of being part of this study.  
 
7. Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These bad things are 
called “risks.” The primary risk to you from this study is  that you may have side effects,  from 
tazemetostat. Your doctor will talk to you about the risks we know about from tazemetostat. There may 
be other risks from tazemetostat that we don’t know about  yet.  
 
8. Your family can choose to be part of this study or not. Your family can also decide to stop being in this 
study at any time once you start. There may be other treatments for your illness that your doctor can 
tell you about. Make sure to ask your doctors any questions that you ha ve.  
 
9. As part of the study we are also trying to learn more about the mutations that occur in cancers that happen 
in children and teens, as well as how tazemetostat works. If your family agrees we will draw some extra 
blood samples to do these tests.

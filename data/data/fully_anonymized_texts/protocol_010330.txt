Protocol Template © CFFT TDN   Effective: 28 DEC 2012  1 BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE  
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder caused by [CONTACT_93708] (CFTR) protein. Over 1,900 
mutations, categorized into five genotypic or functional classes are implicated in causing 
CF. Severity of disease varies widely in CF based on CFTR -dependent and independent 
factors. Progressive obstructive lung disease is th e main determinant of morbidity and 
mortality in CF; therefore it is critical to identify biomarker profiles that reflect and predict 
this phenotypic variability, and understand their relationship to residual CFTR activity. 
Emerging CFTR modulator therapie s that directly target defective CFTR are being 
evaluated in pi[INVESTIGATOR_93603]. It is not 
known how partial restoration of CFTR function might impact CF disease progression and 
disease -related biomarkers . Thus there is urgent need to i) identify and validate biomarkers 
that might reflect partial restoration of CFTR function and can be used to monitor disease 
progression, and ii) evaluate the mechanistic effects of CFTR modulators on biomarkers and 
explora tory outcome measures in individuals with CF.  
This is a two-part, multi -center, prospective longitudinal, exploratory study of biomarkers, 
clinical and physiological profiles in CF.      
Part A  CORE  Study:  This study is designed to collect specimens and cli nical data to better 
understand the molecular mediators and profiles that characterize specific levels of CFTR 
activity in three different cohorts.  
 Cohort 1: Healthy Controls  
 Cohort 2: CF Subjects with Partial CFTR function CF (class IV/V CFTR mutations)  
 Cohort 3: CF Subjects with Absent CFTR function CF (Class I/II CFTR mutations)  
Part B CORE  Study : The regulatory approval of lumacaftor and ivacaftor combination 
therapy for the treatment of CF  patients 12 years and older  who are homozygous for the 
F508del  mutation  (July 2015) , anticipated expansion of regulatory approval  to include CF 
patients 6 -11 years of age homozygous for the F508del mutation (Fall 2016) and the 
extensive baseline profiling obtained for homozygous F508del Cohort [ADDRESS_103525] of 
combination CFTR modulator therapy on various biomarkers and other potential outcome 
measures to enable current and future research in this arena.  If the combination therapy is 
approved by  [CONTACT_93709] 6 to 11 , Part B will be expanded to allow 
for the enrollment of this young er age group . During Part B , additional specimens and 
clinical data will be collected.  Several exploratory outcome measures will a lso be 
evaluated in nested sub -studies . 
Part A and B Cell Culture Bank:  An additional goal of the combined Parts A and B of 
this study is to collect nasal epi[INVESTIGATOR_93604] a sub -set of subjects to develop a cell 
culture bank of sustained primary nasal  epi[INVESTIGATOR_93605].  The cell culture bank will be 
established to facilitate use of primary nasal cells by [CONTACT_93710].

Each of the CFTR mutations (>1,900 described) resul t in different functional protein 
consequences, ranging from complete protein absence to defective protein activity at the 
plasma membrane. CFTR mutations are broadly categorized into five classes based on the 
molecular effect of the gene mutation on the C FTR protein function.1 Class I (nonsense 
mutations) include premature termination codons and frame shift mutations that result in 
either no significant protein synthesis or low levels of truncated CFTR proteins. Class II 
mutations, which includes the most common F508del mu tant, cause folding or maturation 
defects, and little detectable CFTR at the plasma membrane. Class III mutations ( e.g., 
G551D) lead to the formation of CFTR proteins which reach the plasma membrane but are 
nonfunctional secondary to gating defects that li mit channel opening. As such, Class I -III 
mutations typi[INVESTIGATOR_93606] a classic CF 
phenotype including pancreatic insufficiency . Class IV and V mutations are associated with 
either reduced chloride conductance through the CFTR protein or reduced levels of the 
CFTR protein at the plasma membrane, respectively. Individuals with one Class IV or V 
mutation typi[INVESTIGATOR_93607] ( i.e., partial function mutations), often have 
sufficient pancreatic func tion to absorb nutrients without supplemental pancreatic enzymes 
(i.e., pancreatic sufficiency ), and may have sweat chloride values in the CF diagnostic or 
intermediate ranges.2 While underlying CFTR mutations are strong predictors of pancreatic 
status, mutation class is a relatively poor predictor of lung disease phenotype. It is thought 
that in addition to the CFTR genotype, CFTR independent factors including CF  modifier 
genes and environmental factors influence the variability of CF lung disease and co -
morbidities.3, 4   
Part A of the study will focus on the clinical measures and molecular mediators that 
characterize different levels of CFTR activity (absent versus partial function) including a 
comparison to healthy control subjects in order to better understand the influe nce of CFTR 
function on phenotypic variability which may  aid in the future evaluation of emerging 
CFTR modulator therapi[INVESTIGATOR_93608]. Biomarker analysis of biospecimens at 
the cellular, protein, metabolite and lipid levels will enable a bett er understanding of CF and 
CFTR influence on phenotype. Serial measurements over [ADDRESS_103527] associatio ns with clinical phenotypes.  
1.1.1 Gastr ic pH (pH Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]) Sub-Study Rationale  
The role of CFTR as a regulator of bicarbonate secretion is an old concept that is being 
increasingly appreciated in recent years.  With the availability of a new minimally invasive 
tool, we have an extraordinary chance to study gastrointestinal pH in patients with CF in a 
multicenter manner. CF is associated with pancreatic insufficiency (PI) in the majority of 
patients, although 10 -15% may remain pancreatic sufficient (PS).  Although no t absolute, 
patients with CFTR mutations in Classes I -III are more likely to be PI [INVESTIGATOR_93609] V mutations .[ADDRESS_103528] delayed alkalinization of the proximal duodenum

1.[ADDRESS_103531]. CFTR modulators 
specifically target disease -causing CFTR mutations, with the aim of restoring protein 
functio n towards normal levels. To date, CFTR ‘potentiators’, which open the mutant CFTR 
channel and augment the activity of the protein at the plasma membrane, have had the most 
success in clinical trials. A landmark phase II trial of the CFTR potentiator ivacaf tor 
(Kalydeco™, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA) studied in [ADDRESS_103532] one copy of the G551D mutation, a class 3 gating mutant, demonstrated impressive 
improvements in CFTR activity, detected by [CONTACT_93711] (NPD) and sweat 
chloride testing, resulting in significant changes in lung function.10  This trial was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_93612] t reatment led to rapid, dramatic, 
and sustained improvements in lung function, weight, quality of life, and measures of CFTR 
function, and reductions in pulmonary exacerbations.11, 12  As a result, in 2012, the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ivacaftor for CF patients ages 6 and older 
with the G551D mutation. Recently, ivacaftor received FDA approva l for CF patients with 
other non -G551D class III gating mutations. It is anticipated that ivacaftor therapy alone 
may benefit approximately 15% of the U.S. CF population.  In a Cystic Fibrosis Foundation 
Therapeutics  (CFFT ) led post -approval study termed t he “G551D Observational Trial 
(GOAL Study)” efficacy of ivacaftor was confirmed in CF patients with the G551D 
mutation, and additional information was gleaned from the evaluation of biomarkers related 
to CFTR activity; in addition, a robust biospecimen rep ository was formed, and is now 
being accessed by a variety of CF investigators.  
The next class of CFTR modulators in development and clinical trial testing are ‘correctors’ 
of F508del CFTR trafficking defects which work by [CONTACT_30212] F508del CFTR protein at 
the plasma membrane. Vertex Pharmaceuticals has developed two F508del correctors that 
have advanced to clinical trials (VX -809 or lumacaftor, and VX -661). Preclinical testing has 
shown that combining the CFTR corrector lumacaftor with the potentiator iv acaftor leads to 
enhanced F508del CFTR activity relative to lumacaftor alone .[ADDRESS_103533] improvement in lung function and an approximately 33% 
decrease in the rate of pulmonary exacerbations.14  Combination therapy with a CFTR 
corrector and pot entiator, if successful, has the potential to benefit approximately 80% of 
the U.S. CF population.  
The regulatory approval of lumacaftor /ivacaftor for the treatment of CF provide s an 
unprecedented opportunity to explore the clinical consequences of CFTR co rrection, 
complementing the previous GOAL study, while also examining a population expected to 
experience a less robust effect.  The results could offer new insights into the most relevant 
biomarkers sensitive to this pathway (providing a path forward towa rds the discovery and 
characterization of other biomarkers), while also lending insight into the mechanistic basis

1.2.1 Exploratory Respi[INVESTIGATOR_93613]  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Lung Clearance Index Rationale  
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_66729], such as forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_93614] (FEV1), have 
traditionally been used in the assessment of CF lung disease due to their direct correlation 
with morbidity and mortality15 . However, FEV1 tends t o remain within normal limits in a

required for a study using FEV1 as an outcome measure.  Multiple breath washout (MBW) 
testing s will be performed in a subset of subjects enrolled in the Part B CORE study to 
evaluate the suitability of LCI as an outcome measure to detect and track treatment effects 
in patients receiving CFTR directed pharmacotherapy.

Nitric Oxide (NO) is a complex signaling molecule produced by [CONTACT_93713], ion transport, inflammation, and vascular

concentration of NO derived from the lung.  It is commonly used to monitor disease status

increased NO consumption, or defects in ciliary function .27-32  Thus, exhaled NO may serve 
as a marker of ciliary function and secondarily mucociliary clearance in the context of CF. 
Recently we examined the fraction of exhaled n itric oxide (FENO) in a cohort of CF 
patients admitted for treatment of pulmonary exacerbations, and in a second cohort of CF 
patients with gating mutations who were candidates for ivacaftor therapy.  We examined 
FENO reproducibility, intra -subject and int ersubject variability, correlations with lung 
function, and relationships to concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. In the second cohort we examined 
FENO, FEV1, weight and body mass index before and after four weeks of ivacaftor 
treatment (150 mg every twelve hours).  The  results support the hypothesis that changes in 
FENO can reflect restored CFTR function in CF patients, and due to its ease of 
measurement, availability of standardized equipment and procedures, and its direct 
relationship to ciliary function in PCD, we hy pothesize that FENO could potentially serve 
as a novel biomarker reflecting restored CFTR activity in the lower airways.  FENO testing 
will be performed in a subset of subjects enrolled in the Part B CORE Study to evaluate the 
suitability of FENO as an out come measure to detect and track treatment effects in patients 
receiving CFTR directed pharmacotherapy.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Mucociliary Clearance (MCC)  
A current hypothesis for the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease suggests that 
CFTR dysfunction leads to imbal anced ion transport, with reduced Cl-/HCO3- secretion 
through CFTR and accelerated Na+ absorption through the epi[INVESTIGATOR_85062] 
(ENaC) .33, [ADDRESS_103538] surface liquid 
(ASL) lining fluid and dehydrate luminal mucus secretions.  Evidence supporting this 
hypothesis comes both from in vitro  and animal experiments, where the critical influence of 
ASL hydration on mucus transport has been clearly elucidated . 35, [ADDRESS_103539] shown 
that bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_93617],

patients with more advanced disease (unpublished d ata).  M easurements of MCC in CF 
patients using inhaled radiolabeled particles and gamma scintigraphy are also clearly 
abnormal, with marked slowing of clearance from the peripheral lung compartment , and in 
response to cough37, 38 the link between CFTR function and MCC was strengthened by a 
sub-study conducted within the GOAL Study.  Twenty -one patients with the G551D 
mutation at four study sites had MCC measured before and after beginning treatment with 
ivacaftor.  One month after starting therapy, MCC was markedly improved.  No additional 
increase (or decrement) in MCC was observed after [ADDRESS_103540]                                                                                                                      Confidential

accurately and quantitatively reflects improve d CFTR function in the lung could provide a 
huge benefit to drug development by [CONTACT_93715].  Evidence for the close association between CFTR function 
and MCC suggests that this assay may be  ideally suited for this purpose.  MCC testing will 
be performed in a subset of subjects enrolled in the PART B CORE  Study to  evaluate the 
utility of MCC as a biomarker in patients that are likely to have “partial” restoration of 
CFTR function ( i.e., less than that achieved with ivacaftor in G551D patients).  The 
resulting data will begin to define the relationship between MCC and clinical responses to 
CFTR modulator therapy, in conjunction with the previously mentioned GOAL data, while 
also helpi[INVESTIGATOR_93619] u nderstand the “sensitivity” of MCC to these drug effects.

antimicrobials; decr eased CFTR -mediated bicarbonate secretion may underlie dysbiosis.  
The defensins lysozyme and lactoferrin have decreased ability to kill bacteria at higher

CF has been facilitated by [CONTACT_93716].  Analysis of bacterial 16S

[IP_ADDRESS]  Gastro -Intestinal Inflammation (Fecal Calprotectin)  
The pathophysiologic triad of obstruction, inf ection and inflammation can be seen in the 
intestinal tract as well as in the airways.  Although the exact underlying mechanism of GI 
tract inflammation is unknown, dysfunctional CFTR is thought to be the inciting factor .50   
Endoscopic lavage of the CF small intestine showed increased levels of inflammatory 
markers in the lumen .51  A conventional endoscopic study showed that the CF duodenum 
was morphologically normal but there were increased levels of several inflammatory 
markers in biopsied tissue .52  More recent work using video equipped capsul e endoscopy 
showed that morphological abnormalities occur in the jejunum and ileum in more than 60% 
of CF patients which include edema, erythema, mucosal breaks, and ulcerations .53  That 
study also reported significant elevations of fecal calprotectin (a neutrophil secretory 
product) in many CF patients, consistent with intestinal inflammation. These inflammatory 
markers are seen in PS as well as PI [CONTACT_1962], indi cating that CFTR dysfunction leads to “CF 
enteropathy” rather than inflammation being caused by [CONTACT_93719] .[ADDRESS_103546] .55  In one study in patients with CF, calprotectin did 
not correlate with presumptive small intestinal in flammation resulting from SIBO .56  
However, after treatment of whole -gut dysbiosis with probiotics, calprotectin levels 
decreased suggested improvements in int estinal inflammation .57  A subset of subjects 
enrolled in the Part B CORE study will provide fecal samples for fecal calprotectin.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Gastric pH Rationale (pH Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382])  
The role of CFTR as a regulator of bicarbonate secretion is an old concept that is being 
increasingly appreciated  in recent years.  With the availability of a new minimally invasive 
tool, we have an extraordinary chance to study gastrointestinal pH in patients with CF in a 
multicenter manner. In CF patients with the G551D mutation, ivacaftor potentiates CFTR -
mediated  chloride secretion and leads to improved lung function and nutritional status .[ADDRESS_103547]                                                                                                                      Confidential

Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is charact erized by [CONTACT_93720]. It is extraordinarily prevalent in the CF population, occurring in 15 -20% of 
adolescents and, eventually, more than half of adults .[ADDRESS_103548] 
completely normal glucose metabolism; even those with normal fasting and [ADDRESS_103549] mid -OGTT glucose elevation (indeterminate glycemia) and 
have defective acute ins ulin secretion in response to intravenous glucose .[ADDRESS_103550] of CFTR on insulin 
secretion becomes more c ritical.  
We postulate that CFTR plays a small but important role in insulin secretion.  A pi[INVESTIGATOR_93620] G551D CFTR mutation that measured insulin secretion before 
and 1 month after initiation of ivacaftor therapy provided prelimi nary evidence that drugs 
that improve CFTR function may increase insulin secretion in CF.  After 1 month of 
ivacaftor therapy, the insulin response to oral glucose improved by 66 -178% in all subjects 
except the one with long standing diabetes (p=0.07).  While childhood may be the ideal 
time to intervene (with the hope of establishing a healthy “bank” of fully functional beta 
cells which are better able to withstand the metabolic stresses of CF that escalate over time) 
further data needs to be gathered in ad ults before studying children.  Longitudinal 
assessment of a greater number of subjects with CF is necessary to determine whether early 
correction of CFTR could delay or even prevent diabetes.  Oral glucose tolerance testing 
will be performed in a subset o f subjects enrolled in the Part B CORE study to examine the 
role of CFTR in human insulin secretion, potentially opening the way for novel diabetes 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_93621].

associated with specific procedures.  
 
CORE  Study Procedures (Part A and Part B) : 
 
The risks from CORE  Study procedures are minimal and include:  
 Potential discomfort and b ruising from blood draws  
 Potential skin irritation from sweat chloride testing  
 Potential for increased coughing or wheezing associated with sputum induction.  For 
this reason, it is standard practice to administer a bronchodilator (e.g., albuterol) 
prior t o beginning the sputum induction procedure.  
 Potential discomfort during the nasal epi[INVESTIGATOR_93622] - Study Procedures :  
 
MBW  Test: The instrument to be used for the MBW test is the Exhalyzer D by [CONTACT_93721] (Duernten, Switze rland).  There is a very small risk of hyperventilation, which is 
minimized because each breath will be visualized on the computer screen in real time and 
the exhaled gases are monitored. Rarely with hyperventilation there may be dizziness or 
fainting.  
 
FEN O Test : FENO is a non -invasive test commonly performed on asthma patients. There 
are no significant risks.  
 
MCC Testing : The following complications could result from inhalation of nebulized 
aerosols:   cough, shortness of breath, hoarseness, throat irritat ion, temporary decrease in 
lung function measurements, wheezing and decrease in oxygen saturation.  
The MCC procedure entails exposure to some radiation. The amount of radiation dose 
received during the study (2 MCC scans)  is approximately 89 millirem. The risk from the 
radiation dose received from this procedure is too small to be detected , but is significantly 
less than the radiation dose received from the natural environment over the course of 1 year 
(~300 millirem).  
Gastro -Intestinal/Glucose -Insulin Sub-Study Procedures : 
pH Pi[INVESTIGATOR_93623] : The SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]® has been approved for use by [CONTACT_93722], specifically delayed gastric emptying and chronic constipation.  
Medical problems or technical problems with the wireless m otility capsule  (SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]) can 
occur. The capsule may fail to empty from the stomach or may fail to be expelled from the 
GI tract.

Oral Glucose Tolerance Test : Risks of the oral gluc ose tolerance test procedure include 
discomfort and/or bruising related to placement of an IV port or blood draws.  There is also 
a risk  of lightheadedness during the test from not eating.  Subjects will be provided with a

4.1 Study Overview  
This is a two -part, multi -center, prospective longitudinal, exploratory study of biomarkers, 
clinical , and physiological profiles in CF.   
Part A  
In Part A , a cohort of non -CF control subjects and tw o cohorts of CF subjects, grouped by 
[CONTACT_93723], will be studied .  Importantly, comparison with a non -CF 
control group will allow examination of CFTR -dependent biomarkers across the spectrum 
of CFTR activity (absent, partial, complet e).  
Part A  will consist of the Part A CORE Study and one optional sub -study (pH Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]). Refer 
to Study Schematics below and Schedule of Events in Appendices 1 and 2 for the specific 
visit schedule and procedures for each cohort. A subset of patients will u ndergo nasal cell 
procurement and storage.  
 Cohort 1 subjects (Controls) will be on study for up to 14 days with up to two visits.

10.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  that is participating 
in this clinical investigation and is a result of the research study procedures.   
The Investigator will monitor for the occurrence of study procedure -related AEs during 
each subject visit and record the information in the site’s source docum ents.  Adverse events 
will be recorded in the subject  CRF.  Adverse events will be described by [CONTACT_24109] (start and 
stop dates and times), severity, outcome, treatment and relation to study procedure.  
During this observational study,  the combination therap y lumacaftor/ ivacaftor is expected to 
be a marketed product prescribed in accordance with its approved usage.  Any adverse event 
that an investigator believes is related to lumacaftor/ ivacaftor and that is clinically 
significant should be reported directly  to the FDA via a MedWatch form.  
AE Severity  
The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 4.0, as modified for cystic fibrosis, should be used to assess and grade 
AE severity, including laboratory abnormali ties judged to be clinically significant. The 
modified criteria can be found in the study manual.  If the experience is not covered in the 
modified criteria, the guidelines shown in Table 1  below should be used to grade severity.  
It should be pointed out that the term “severe” is a measure of intensity and that a severe AE 
is not necessarily serious.  
Table 1.  AE Severity Grading  
Severity (Toxicity Grade)  Description  
Mild (1)  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or 
diagnos tic observations only; intervention not indicated.  
Moderate (2)  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention 
indicated; limiting age -appropriate Instrumental 
activities of daily living (e.g., preparing meals, using the 
telephone, managing money)  
Severe (3)  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -
threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24599]; disabling; limiting self -care 
activities of daily living (e.g., bathing, dressing, feeding 
self, using toilet, ta king medications)  
Life-threatening (4)  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention 
indicated.  
Death (5)  Death Related to AE

to Study 
Procedure  Comment  
Definitely  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the study 
procedure: that follows a known or e xpected response pattern to the 
study procedure; and that is not explained by [CONTACT_93734].  
Probably  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the study 
procedure; that follows a known or expected response pattern to th e 
study procedure; and that is unlikely to be explained by [CONTACT_93735]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_82978].  
Possibly  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the study 
procedure; that follows a known or  expected response pattern to the 
study procedure; but that could readily have been produced by a 
number of other factors.  
10.2 Serious Adverse Experiences (SAE)  
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring that results in any of the following outcomes:  
 death  
 a life -threatening adverse experience  
 inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly/birth defect

If a subject  has not passed the capsule 14 days after ingestion and the pH profile as well as 
pressure profile as reviewed by [CONTACT_2005]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93681], abdominal x -rays 
(flat and upright) will be obtained.   If the capsule is identified by x -ray but the subject is not 
having pain and does not have evidence of air -fluid levels, polyethylene glycol (17 grams in 
8 ounces of liquid) will be prescribed, to be taken orally  three times a day until the capsule 
has passed into the colon or has been evacuated.   Consultation with a gastroenterologist for 
possible endoscopy and manual removal will be scheduled if the subject has severe 
abdominal pain secondary to capsule retentio n, with air -fluid level on abdominal x -rays.

Prior to the analysis of the final study data, a detailed Statis tical Analysis Plan (SAP) will 
be written, describing all analyses that will be performed.  The SAP will contain any 
modifications to the analysis plan described below.   
13.[ADDRESS_103695] s who provide informed consent will be include d in the analyses.  The 
core and sub -studies will be linked so that associations between primary and secondary 
endpoints from each sub -study and clinical parameters (e.g., spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], weight, or sweat 
chloride , etc. ) collected as part of the CORE  Study may  be explored in the future. Parts A 
and B will be analyzed separately ; however , visits that were performed as Part A in subject s 
who went onto Part B may be treated as baseline visits for Part B.  
No imputation will be made for missing data. As a sensitivi ty analysis, select missing data 
methods will be employed to assess the impact of missing data on the primary endpoint. For 
both the CORE STUDIES and each SUB -STUDY, all formal hypothesis testing will be 
performed at the two -sided alpha 0.05 level. All pro tocol violations will be included as a 
listing.  
13.2 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_9084], part, and sub -study 
participation, including race, gender, age, CFTR genotype, height, weight, and spi [INVESTIGATOR_038].  
Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive summary statistics including: 
number of subjects (N), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum. 
Categorical variables will be summarized using counts and percentages. For  categorical 
demographic characteristics, Fisher’s exact test will be used to compare cohorts (Part A 
only).  
Part A, Cohort 3 enrollment will be monitored throughout the study for genotype (F508del 
homozygous, heterozygous, and other), FEV 1 % predicted , and age distribution.  Should 
imbalance occur, sites may be encouraged to recruit under -enrolling strat a and enrollment 
may close for certain genotype -FEV 1-age criteria.

modeling adjusted for baseline FEV 1 and age.  
Part B GIFT S ub-study  
For the glucose/insulin functional testing:  summary statistics and 95% confidence intervals 
will be summarized for changes in area under the  insulin and c -peptide curves from 
Baseline to Visit 5, and tested via the paired t -test. Estimates of mean AUCs and changes 
from Baseline at each subsequent Visit will be obtained by [CONTACT_93739].  
For the gastro -intestinal functional testing: t he percent of subjects with negative breath test 
at Visit 5 among those positive at Baseline will be estimated with 95% CI (Wilson’s score -
based).  
Part B pH pi[INVESTIGATOR_93626]-study  
Summary statistics and 95% confidence intervals will be presented. A paired t -test w ill be 
used to compare the change in pH (during initial 30 minutes) from Baseline to Visit 5.  
Part B MBW/FENO Sub-study  
For MBW: Summary statistics and 95% confidence intervals will be presented for change in 
LCI. A paired t -test will be performed to compa re Visit 7 LCI measurements to baseline. 
Changes in LCI across all time points will be assessed by [CONTACT_93740]. 
Feasibility will be assessed as the percentage of subjects producing research quality 
measurements for the primary study en dpoint (both baseline and Visit 7) and at each time 
point.  
For FENO: Summary statistics and 95% confidence intervals will be presented for  change 
in FENO.  A paired t -test will be performed to compare Visit 5 measurements to baseline. 
Changes in FENO acr oss all time points will be assessed by [CONTACT_93741].  
Part B MCC Sub-study  
Summary statistics and 95% confidence intervals will summarize change in average whole 
lung clearance from Baseline to Visit 5, and tested with a paired t -test. 
13.4 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
Comprehensive details of secondary endpoints will be outlined in the SAP. The following 
considerations will guide development of these secondary endpoints:  
1. For Part A, the mean response for each cohort incorporating data fro m all visits will be 
compared using repeated measures ANOVA test. For part B, Generalized Estimating 
Equations (GEE) models will allow estimation of the change over time in the response 
variable. Potential confounders that affect the outcome will be identi fied and included in 
all multivariate models.

CFTR function, and novel markers of CF lung disease severity.  Data from recent CFF -
supported metabolomics projects indicate that 40 -50 CF subjects per group are necessary to 
validate metabolomics and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_1800] -based biomarkers with a tolerable false discovery 
rate. 
Part A pH pi[INVESTIGATOR_93682] -STUDY  
Twenty subjects in each c ohort (i.e. Cohorts 2 and 3, for a total of 40 subjects) are required 
to conduct a two -sided t -test with 80% power and type I error at 0.[ADDRESS_103699] a mean 
difference of 0.92 pH (Cohort 3 pH = 4.5 versus Cohort 2 pH = 5.42) assuming a variance 
of 1.0 in e ach group.  
Part B CORE STUDY  
A sample of up to 250 for Part B was chosen based on feasibility to support the six sub -
studies while providing enough power for correlations with potentially subtle changes in 
clinical measures such as FEV 1 and weight or BMI.  Additionally , it will allow for division 
into subsets of  lung disease severity (by [CONTACT_10266] 1 percentiles)  for comparisons .

For the glucose/insulin functional testing: estimates for sample size for OGTT are based on 
data from five G551D CF patients from a recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_93683] c -peptide is available pre and one month post ivacaftor .62  Seventy -five subjects ensures 
81% power to detect an increase in AUC insulin of 600 mU/L min at Visit 5 ( approximately  
25% increase assuming baseline mean of 2400 mU/L min , SD =1800 mU/L min) using a 
two-sided paired t -test with alpha 0.05.  Similarly, 75 subjects ensures 82% power to d etect 
an increase in AUC c -peptide of 54 mU/L min at Visit 5 (approx imately  11% increase 
assuming baseline mean of 500 mU/L min , SD =160 mU/L min) using a two -sided paired 
t-test with alpha 0.05.  
For the gastro -intestinal functional testing: assuming 50%  of the sample will have a positive 
breath test at baseline, approximately 35 treated subjects would ensure with 86% probability 
that a 95% CI for SIBO eradication (percent negative at Visit 5) would extend no more than 
±15% from the estimated percent with  a negative breath test, assuming 70% eradication.  
Part B pH pi[INVESTIGATOR_93682] -STUDY  
Assuming a slightly smaller effect size as that observed in the GOAL pH pi[INVESTIGATOR_93650] -study, a 
sample size of twenty subjects is required to conduct a two -sided paired t -test with 80% 
power and alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_103700] a mean difference of 0.8 pH (Baseline pH = 4.5 versus 
Visit 5 pH = 5.3) assuming a SD of 1.2 for the mean difference.  
Part B MBW/FENO SUB -STUDY  
For MBW: based on previous interventional studies we expect the changes in LCI in 
subjects treated with combination CFTR pharmacotherapy to be similar to the changes in 
subjects treated with hypertonic saline or dornase alfa studies, which were [ADDRESS_103701] de viation of

with 80% power and an alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_103703] analysis. Estimating 30% dropout or 
measurements not of research quality, 6 8 subjects would need to enter the study.  
For FENO:   a small previous interventional study of ivacaftor for  30 days in G551D 
patients observed a change in FENO of 5.2 ppm (SD=3.3). Conservatively assuming 
combination CFTR therapy in homozygous 508del will result in a treatment effect 
approximately 65% smaller (1.8 ppm) with more variability (SD=4.0), a sample s ize of [ADDRESS_103704] with 90% power and an alpha of

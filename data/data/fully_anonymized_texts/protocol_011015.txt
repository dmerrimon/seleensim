2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Non-small cell lung cancer  
 
Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer related death in the [LOCATION_002] [ 1]. 
Standard therapy for Stage IV non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) involves platinum -based 
chemotherapy regimens as first -line therapy, and incremental improvements in chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_252355] a median overall survival of over a year [ 2-3].  However , the most 
dramatic successes in lung cancer have been seen with genotype -guided treatment. Driver 
genetic alterations such as EGFR  activating mutations, and ALK and ROS translocations, among 
others, have been identified that are targets for therapy in lun g cancer [ 4-7].  Targeted treatment 
of these oncogenic drivers has resulted in markedly higher response rates and survival compared 
to what is typi[INVESTIGATOR_252356] [ 8-11].  Increasingly, lung cancer is 
becoming subdivided into molecul ar subsets with different treatment options depending on the 
molecular diagnostics of the cancer.   Somatic mutations in MET  that affect the splice sites of 
exon 14 (METex14) are emerging as a targetable alteration in lung cancer which is p resent in 3 -
4% of  NSCLC [12 -23] and are further discussed below in Section 2.3.  In addition, MET 
amplification is another known targetable alteration reported in 2 -4% of NSCLC  [24]. This study 
investigates the activity of the MET inhibitor INC280 in patients with NSCLC wit h METex14 or 
MET amplification who have previously received another MET inhibitor therapy.  
 
2.2 INC280    
 
INC280 is a potent  ATP  competitive  and reversible  inhibitor of the c-MET kinase  
([IC]50 in a b ioche mical assay = 0.13 ± 0.05 nM).  INC280 is  highly spe cific for c-MET with a 
greater than  10,000 -fold selectivity over a panel of 56 other human  kinases tested.  Potent  
activity has also been observed  in cell-based biochemical  and functional  assays that  meas ure 
c-MET -mediated  signal  trans duction,  as well as c-MET-dependent  cell prolifera tion, 
survival,  and migrati on. In c-MET/HGF -driven tumor  models  grown as xeno grafts in 
mice,  oral dosing  of INC280  demonstrated  signifi cant in vivo activity in blo cking both 
c-MET  phosphorylation  and tumor growth.  
  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-019 
Protocol Version Date:  August  6, [ADDRESS_306765]  day of cons ecutive dosin g. 
Accumulation of INC280  following  repeated  administration is low with accumulati on ratio of 
up to 3-fold. Median  time to peak plasma  concentrations  is reached at approximately 2 hours  
(Tmax  ranged  from  0.5 to 8.1 h ac ross studies). Solubility of INC280  is pH-dependent . 
Solubility of INC280 is high at pH 1.0 (>5 mg/mL) and low (~0.002 mg/mL) at pH 6.9 and 
pH 7.4.  
 
INC280 has been studied in multiple phase 1 and 2 trials, both as a single agent and in 
combination with other drugs. For detailed information please refer to  the Investigator’s 
Brochure.  Of note in a phase 1 study in patients with  c-MET  dependent advanced  solid tumors  
with an expansion  part in HCC, gastric  cancer,  NSC LC, and PRCC and other  solid tumors, 
INC280 showed  preliminary signs of  antitumor  activity in the NSC LC expansion  arm with 
three  out of six patients  having  confi rmed partial respon se; all patients were  EGFR wildtype  
and had high MET  status by [CONTACT_252383]-situ hybridization [25].  
 
2.[ADDRESS_306766] the splice sites of exon 14 (METex14) are a 
targetable alteration in lung cancer which is present in 3 -4% of NSCLC [ 12-23].  These 
mutations are predominantly in the intronic segments and lead to an alternatively spliced 
transcript of MET in which deletion of the juxtamembrane domain results in the loss of the Cbl 
E3-ligase binding site [ 13].  The alternatively spliced MET receptor exhibits decreased 
ubiquitination and delayed downregulation, leading to prolonged activation of MET an d 
MAPK/ERK pathway which is transforming [ 13,17].  In a retrospective study of 240 lung cancer 
cases at [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], we found 11 cases of METex14 [ 19].  Similar to other 
reports, most of these occurred in the absence of other driver alte rations, supporting the notion 
that this is a driver event.  Although potentially enriched among never smokers who are wildtype 
for other driver mutations, METex14 is found in smokers as well, and appears to be present 
across all lung histologies [ 19].  
  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-019 
Protocol Version Date:  August  6, [ADDRESS_306767] shown that METex14 is a transforming event that can respond well 
to MET inhibition [ 13, 17].  Kong -Beltran showed prolonged phosphorylation of MET and 
MAPK with stimulation by [CONTACT_252384] a cell line with METex14, and increased cell prolifer ation, 
which was inhibited by [CONTACT_27180] a MET inhibitor [ 13].  Frampton et al showed that human 
METex14 and the homologous mouse MET exon [ADDRESS_306768] partly through activation of the MEK/ERK pathway. A mouse model of the 
homologous exon 15 deletion in MET showed sensitivity to MET inhibition with INC280 [ 17] 
(see Figure 1).    
Figure 1.  
 
In line with these preclinical studies, recent reports have shown promising clinical 
activity among patients with M ETex14 treated with MET inhibitors including crizotinib, 
cabozantinib, and INC280 [ 17-23].  Paik et al reported on 4 patients with METex14 who were 
treated with MET inhibitors; three with crizotinib and one with cabozantinib.  These patients all 
experience d significant regression of their tumor burden on the MET therapy [ 18].  Frampton et 
al reported on one patient who responded to crizotinib, and two pts who were treated on a phase 
1 study of INC280 who also demonstrated a partial response to therapy [ 17].  Other case reports 
have shown similar marked responses [ 19-23].  Table [ADDRESS_306769] shown response to MET therapy.  Reported durations on therapy are 
preliminary in nature but range from approximate ly 3 months to 13 months.

In addition to MET exon 14 skippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], MET amp lification is known to occur in NSCLC  
and may be targetable as well .  Among 13 patients with MET amplified NSCLC enrolled in a 
clinical trial of crizotinib, 1 had low level amplification (MET/CEP7 ratio 1.8 -2.2), 6 had 
intermediate level amplification  (MET/CEP7 ratio 2.2 – 5), and 6 had high l evel amplification 
(MET/CEP7 ratio >5).  Partial responses were observed in 4/13 patients (33%, 95% CI 10,65), 
with none (0/1) observed in the low amplification group, 1/6 (20%) in the intermediate 
amplification group, and 3/6 (50%) in the high amplificati on group.  [26]    
At [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (MGH), we have been performing genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_252357] 2009 [ 27].  Our current 
version of the SNaPshot genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_252358]14,  which previously was challenging 
to find due to their predominant location in the intronic segments of the gene.  In addition, MET 
amplification is captured on our panel as well.   Currently, all patients with lung cancer at MGH 
are tested reflexively for  genetic mutations using the targeted next generation SNaPshot assay for 
point mutations and the targeted next generation translocation assay for rearrangements.   
  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-019 
Protocol Version Date:  August  6, [ADDRESS_306771] -line setting  for METex14 .  The ability of ceritinib a nd alectinib to 
overcome resistance to crizotinib in ALK rearranged lung cancer [10, 28] points to the feasibility 
of a more potent drug being able to overcome acquired resistance.  As there will be patients who 
have previously received other MET inhibitor s such as crizotinib or cabozantinib , it will be 
important to know whether INC280 has activity in the setting of prior MET inhibitor therapy.  
 
 
2.4 Correlative Studies Background  
 
MGH has an active investigational program studying response and resistance to ta rgeted 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_252359] [ 29-31]. Patients who respond to a targeted 
therapy and be come resistant are routinely biopsied and investigations including repeat 
molecular testing as well as creation of cell line and xenograft mod els are utilized to interrogate 
the tumor for mechanisms of resistance.  This collaborative framework will be utilized in this 
trial to study  response and  resistance mechanisms from biopsy samples of patients on this study.   
To date there is a dearth of ce ll line and PDX models for METex14; we will attempt to generate 
such model systems for study.  In addition, MET, MDM2 , and CDK4  amplification have all been 
reported to co -exist with METex14 [17 -18], but the relevance to response or resistance is not 
known.   We will therefore explore the co -occurrence of these amplification events among the 
patients with METex14 enrolled in our study, and explore whether there is any preliminary 
signal of responsiveness or resistance depending on these co -alterations.

Protocol Version Date:  August  6, 2019   
 
14 • Total abstinence (w hen this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. 
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods) 
and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception  
• Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without 
hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In  case 
of oophorectomy alone, only when the reprod uctive status of the woman has been 
confirmed by [CONTACT_104]  
• Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening).  For female subjects on the study 
the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that subject  
• Combin ation of any two of the following (a+b or a+c, or b+c):  
a. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other

4. REGISTRATION PROCEDU RES  
 
4.1 General Guidelines for DF/HCC Instit utions  
 
Institutions will register eligible participants in the Clinical Trials Management System  (CTMS)  
OnCore . Registrations must occur prior to the initiation of  protocol therapy. Any participant not 
registered to the protocol before protocol therapy  begins will be considered ineligible and 
registration will be denied.  
  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-019 
Protocol Version Date:  August  6, [ADDRESS_306791].  
 
Following registration, participants  may begin  protocol therapy . Issues that would  cause 
treatment delays should be discussed with the Overall Principal Investigator (PI). If a participant 
does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the pa rticipant’s registration on the 
study  must  be can celed . Registration cancellations  must be made in OnCore as soon as possible.   
 
4.2 Registration Process for DF/HCC Institutions

5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
 
5.1 Treatment Regimen  
 
INC280 will be administered at 400 mg PO BID, with 21 consecutive days defined as a 
treatment cycle. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis.  Reported adverse events 
and potential risks are described in Section 7.  Appropriate dose modifications are described in 
Section 6.

agent study  Twice Daily (BID)  
 
 
5.2 Pre-Treatment Criteria  
 
  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-019 
Protocol Version Date:  August  6, [ADDRESS_306792] be grade 1 or less or 
else deemed not clinically significant by [CONTACT_12707].  
 
5.3 Agent Administration  
INC280 tablet will be administered orally on a continuous twice daily (BID) dosing schedule, on 
a flat scale of [ADDRESS_306793] the 
patient to take the study drug exactly as prescribed.  
Drugs are provided i n the following strengths: 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg.  The tablets should 
be protected from moisture, and stored at ambient temperature (not above 25 degrees celsius or 
77 degrees farenheit). The 50 mg and 100 mg tablets should be used within six week of o pening, 
and the 200 mg tablet within 4 week of opening.  
• Each dose of INC280 is to be taken with a glass of water (at least 8 ounces – approximately 
250 mL) and consumed over as short a time as possible (i.e., not slower than 1 tablet every 2 
minutes).  
• Patients should be instructed to swallow the tablets whole and not to chew them.  
• INC280  can be administered with or without food. The morning and the evening doses 
should be taken 12 (± 4) hours apart, although 12 -hour interval is highly recommended. The 
morn ing dose should be taken the same time each morning. If a dose is not taken within 4 
hours of the planned dosing time, the missed dose should not be replaced.  
• Patients should be instructed not to make up for missed doses or partial doses (i.e., when the 
entire dose is not taken as instructed). A missed or partial dose will be defined as a case when 
the full dose is not taken within 4 hours of the scheduled twice daily dosing. If that occurs, 
then the dose (or part remaining dose) should not be taken and dos ing should restart with the 
next scheduled dose. If vomiting occurs, no attempt should be made to replace the vomited 
dose before the next scheduled dose.  
• During the whole duration of treatment with INC280 alone, the patient is recommended to 
use precautio nary measures against ultraviolet exposure (e.g., use of sunscreen, protective 
clothing, avoid sunbathing or using a solarium).  
 
The investigator should instruct the patient to take INC280 exactly as prescribed.  
 
 
 
5.4 General Concomitant Medication and Suppo rtive Care Guidelines  
  
Concomitant medications  
 
In general, the use of any concomitant medication/therapy deemed necessary for the care of  
the patient (e.g. such as anti -emetics, anti -diarrhea) is permitted (see section below), except when 
  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-019 
Protocol Version Date:  August  6, 2019   
 
17 specifically pr ohibited (see section below).   In selected cases after discussion with the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_252365].  
 
The patient must be told to notify the investigational site about any new medications he/she  
takes after the start of the study drug. All medications (excluding study treatment and prior  
antineoplastic treatments), blood transfusions, surgeries and procedures (including physical  
therapy) administered within [ADDRESS_306794] dose of INC280 should be recorded.  Medications include not only 
physician prescribed medications, but also all over -the counter medications, herbal medications, 
food supplements and vitamins.  
 
The following res trictions apply during the entire duration of the study:  
• No other investigational therapy should be given to patients  
• No anticancer agents other than the study medication (INC280) should be given to patients.  
   
Permitted concomitant therapy  
 
Palliative ra diation and/or palliative procedures may be allowed on study after discussion with 
the study PI.  The duration of study drug hold around the palliative radiation or procedure will be 
determined on a case by [CONTACT_252385].  
 
Patients are permitted to use the following medications while taking INC280:  
• Oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_8163]  
• Medications to prevent or treat nausea, vomiting or diarrhea  
• Growth factors (e.g. G -CSF, GM -CSF, erythropoietin, platelets growth factors, etc.) are  
      allowed per the investigator’s judgement and per local guidelines.  
• Treatment with bisphosphonates for pre -existing bone metastases is permitted, if clinically  
indicated, and following existing local guidelines. Treatment with bisphosphonates should 
preferably begin before the study treatment is initiated, but can also be initiated during  
therapy only if absence of radiological bone disease progression is well documented (inthis 
case, the reason for its use must be clearly documented; i.e. “pre -existing, non-progressing  
bone metastases”).  
• Oxygen therapy and blood products or transfusions  
• Nutritional support or appetite stimulants  
• Pain medication  
 
Permitted concomitant therapy requiring caution and/or action  
 
INC280 is metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4. Medications tha t are moderate inducers of CYP3A4 are  
not prohibited but should be administered with caution. INC280 is a time -dependent inhibitor  
of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. Sensitive substrates for CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 should be  
administered with caution. INC280 is a weak to mod erate inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and  
CYP2C19. Sensitive substrates of CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 and substrates with a  
narrow therapeutic window should be administered with caution. Sensitive substrates for Pgp  
and OATP trasnporters should also be adminis tered with caution. Refer to Table 4 below

5.5 Criteria for Taking a Participant Off Protocol Therapy  
 
Duration of therapy will depend on individual response, evidence of disease progression and/or 
lack of clinical benefit and tolerance. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), 
treatment may continue until one of the f ollowing criteria applies:  
  
• Disease progression (note that after discussion with the principal investigator, the 
decision can be made to continue on study past progression if the participant is having 
clinical benefit).   The following criteria must be met  if the decision is made to 
continue treatment past RECIST -defined progres sion, and written informed consent 
must be obtained for treatment beyond RECIST -defined disease progression.  
• absence of clinical symptoms or signs indicating clinically significant 
disease progression;  
• no decline in performance status that is thought due to disease 
progression  
• absence of rapid disease progression or threat to vital organs or critical 
anatomical sites requiring urgent alternative medical intervention;  
• no significant,  unacceptable or irreversible toxicities related to study 
treatment  
 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  
 
• Participant demonstrates an inability or unwillingness to comply with the oral 
medic ation regimen and/or documentation requirements  
 
• Participant decides to withdraw from the protocol therapy  
 
• General or specific changes in the participant's condition render the participant 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the treating  investigator  
 
Participants will be removed from the protocol therapy when any of these criteria apply.  The 
reason for removal from protocol therapy, and the date the participant was removed, must be 
documented in the case report form (CRF). Alternative c are options will be discussed with the 
participant.

Treatment interruption and treatment discontinuati on 
If the administration of INC280 is temporarily interrupted for reasons other than toxicity, then 
treatment with INC280 may be resumed at the same dose. If the treatment with INC280 is 
withheld due to toxicity, the dose modification guidelines in Table 6 should be followed.  
If the treatment with INC280 is withheld for more than 21 consecutive days (counting from the 
first day when a dose was interrupted), then INC280 should be permanently discontinued. When 
the treating physician believes that continuing  treatment may still provide clinical benefit for the 
patient, study treatment may be resumed.  
Patients who discontinue the study due to a study drug related AE or an abnormal laboratory 
value must be followed as described below.  
Follow -up and management guidelines  for toxicities  
All patients will be followed for safety until [ADDRESS_306839] dose of INC280. Patients

TOXICITY  FOLLOW -UP EVALUATION  
HEMATOLOGICAL  
Febrile neutropenia,  
Neutropenia ≥ CTCAE grade 3  
Thrombocytopenia ≥ CTCAE 
grade 3  
Anemia ≥ CTCAE grade [ADDRESS_306841] weekly (or more frequently) until ≤ CTCAE grade 2.  
Perform physical exam for check on bruising in case of major thrombocytopenia.  
RENAL  
Serum cr eatinine ≥ CTCAE 
grade [ADDRESS_306842] weekly (or more frequently) until ≤ CTCAE grade 1 or baseline.  
Patients will be instructed to increase hydration until resolution to ≤ CTCAE 
grade 1 or baseline.  
HEPATIC  
Total bilirubin ≥ CTCAE grade [ADDRESS_306843] weekly (or more frequently) until ≤ CTCAE grade 1  
Patients with total bilirubin > 1.[ADDRESS_306844] (any duration) should have fractionation of 
bilirubin into total/direct or indirect/direct components and any additional work -up 
as clinically indicated by [CONTACT_63015]. Follow -up of hyperbilirubinemia should 
proceed as per the guidelines in table 2, irrespective of the results of 
fractionation.  
AST/ALT ≥ CTCAE grade [ADDRESS_306845] weekly (or more frequently) until ≤ CTCAE grade 1 or ≤ CTCAE grade 2 (if 
patient is Grade 2 at baseline) . 
In particular, test for all the following liver function tests (LFTs): albumin, ALT, 
AST, total bilirubin (fractionated if total bilirubin > 1.[ADDRESS_306846]), alkaline 
phosphatase and GGT. Note: for patients with Gilbert Syndrome, total and direct 
bilirubin mu st be monitored, but intensified monitoring applies to changes in 
direct bilirubin only.

QTcF ≥ 501 ms  
(CTCAE grade 3)  When QTcF ≥ 501 ms (CTCAE grade 3), perform the following:  
● Call the study’s central ECG review laboratory immediately and request an 
immediate manual read of the ECG.  
● Perform an analysis of serum potassium, calcium, phosphorus, and 
magnesium, and if below lower limit of normal, correct with supp lements to within 
normal limits.  
● Review concomitant medication usage for the potential to inhibit CYP3A4/5 
(table 4)  and/or to prolong the QT -interval ( Table 6 ). 
● Check compliance with correct dose and administration of study treatment  
Perform a repeat  ECG within one hour of the first QTcF of ≥501 ms.  
● If QTcF remains ≥ [ADDRESS_306850] once 
daily until the QTcF returns to < 501 ms.  
Repeat ECGs 7 days and 14 days (and then every 21 days) after dose 
resumption for  all patients who had therapy interrupted due to QTcF ≥ 501 ms.  
● If QTcF of ≥ 501 ms recurs, repeat ECGs as described above.  
Notes:  
● The investigator should contact [CONTACT_252389] a patient wit h QTcF prolongation should be 
maintained on study.  
● If the central ECG report shows a QTcF ≥ 501 msec (not previously 
documented on the site machine), contact [CONTACT_252390]/her to 
suspend study treatment and return for a repeat ECG as soon as possible. The 
central ECG reader should be called for a manual read of the repeat ECG 
immediately, and the above guidance followed.  
GASTROINTESTINAL  
Diarrhea  Initiate anti -diarrhea treatment after first signs of abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], loose 
stools or ove rt diarrhea.  
Consider/Investigate potential concomitant medication, food or comorbidity 
driven causes of diarrhea (including infectious causes) and remedy these 
causes, if possible (e.g., discontinuation of concomitant medication, dietary 
modification, tre atment of comorbidity).  
The patient should be monitored for signs of dehydration and instructed to take 
preventive measures against dehydration as soon as diarrhea occurs. 
Antidiarrheal medication must be initiated at the first sign of abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
loose stools or overt diarrhea. Concomitant medication for the treatment of 
diarrhea should follow local practice and the investigator’s best judgment and 
may follow “the recommended guidelines for the treatment of cancer treatment -
induced diarrhea”For exa mple:  
● For uncomplicated diarrhea (grade 1 or 2 without complicating signs or 
symptoms), loperamide given at a standard dose (e.g. initial administration of 4 
mg, then 2 mg every 2 -4 hours, maximum of 16 mg/day), along with oral 
hydration and dietetic mea sures should be considered. Note: complicating signs 
or symptoms include: moderate to severe crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], decreased performance 
status, fever, neutropenia, frank bleeding or dehydration.  
● For complicated diarrhea (all grade 3 or 4, grade 1 -2 with complicatin g signs or 
symptoms), management should involve intravenous (IV) fluids, and consider 
treatment with octreotide (at starting dose of 100 to 150 µg sub -cutaneous tid or 
25 to 50 µg IV) and antibiotics (e.g. fluoroquinolone) should be given.

31 TOXICITY  FOLLOW -UP EVALUATION  
Nausea and Vomi ting The investigator should consider/investigate potential concomitant medication, 
food or comorbidity driven causes of nausea and/or vomiting and remedy these 
causes if possible (e.g. discontinuation of concomitant medication, dietary 
modification, treat ment of comorbidity).  
Individualized supportive and anti -emetic treatment should be initiated, as 
appropriate, at the first signs and/or symptoms of these AEs. In patients with 
vomiting, the patient should be monitored for signs of dehydration and instruct ed 
to take preventive measures against dehydration.  
Concomitant medication for the treatment of nausea and/or vomiting should 
follow local practice and the investigator’s best judgment.  
NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS  
Any Neurological Toxicity   
≥ Grade [ADDRESS_306851] twice a week until resolution 
to < CTCAE grade 1. Unscheduled MRI and gadolinium enhanced T1 imaging 
may also be conducted to evaluate patients for intramyelinic edema like lesions, 
brain metasta ses and other unanticipated CNS occurrences. An EEG may be 
performed to monitor for physiological changes in brain activity.

site http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
 
 
Serious Adverse Events  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and regardless of 
causality that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening. Life -threatening means that the person was at immediate risk of death 
from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically 
might have caused death had it occur red in a more sever e form.  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e., the event required at least a 24 -hour 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57892]). 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or surgical operations  scheduled to occur during the study 
period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered SAEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the person was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected manner during the tri al (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned).  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect ; or 
• Is an important medical event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may 
jeopardize the participant and require medical  or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic b ronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
 
Events not considered to be serious adverse ev ents are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]:  
• routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures  
• Abnormal lab values that do not require treatment  
•  treatment planned before signing inf ormed consent for a pre -existing condition that did not 
worsen  
• emergency outpatient treatment for an event not fulfilling the serious criteria outlined 
above and not resulting in inpatient admission  
• respi[INVESTIGATOR_252378]/HCC Protocol #: 16-019 
Protocol Version Date:  August  6, 2019   
 
39 Expected Adverse Events  
 
Adverse events ca n be 'Expected' or 'Unexpected’. Expected adverse events are those that have 
been previously identified as resulting from administration of the agent. For the purposes of this 
study, an adverse event is considered expected  when it appears in the Investigat or’s Brochure  
Unexpected Adverse Events  
  
For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered unexpected  when it varies in 
nature, intensity or frequency from information provided i n the Investigator’s Broc hure.   
Attribution  
 
Attribution is th e relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event and the study 
treatment. Attribution will be assigned as follows:  
 
• Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
• Probable – The AE is likely related  to the study treatment.  
• Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
• Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related  to the study treatment.  
• Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
 
 
7.[ADDRESS_306860] or other means, will be recorded 
in the participant’s medical record and on the appropriate study -specific case report forms. Each 
recorded AE or SAE will be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e., start and end dates), intensity 
treatment required, grade, suspected relationship to the investigational product (causality), 
outcome and actions taken with investigational product.  
 
The descriptions and grading scales found in the CTEP NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTC AE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. The CTCAE version 4.0 
is located on the CTEP website at:  
 http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_appli cations/ctc.htm .  
All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTEP Active Version of 
CTCAE.  
 
To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, investigators should apply the 
following general guideline:  
• YES  
  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-019 
Protocol Version Date:  August  6, [ADDRESS_306861], and the AE cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, 
intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the AE follows a known  pattern of response 
to the investigational product; and/or the AE abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the 
investigational product or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re -challenge.  
• NO 
Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology othe r than the investigational product (e.g., 
preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant 
medication); and/or the AE has no plausible temporal relationship to administration of the 
investigational product (e.g., canc er diagnosed [ADDRESS_306862] dose of study drug).  
 
Each participating investigator is required to abide by [CONTACT_57931]/HCC. The study must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations, local safety 
reporting requirements , and reporting requirements of the principal investigator. Specific 
reporting requirements are detailed below.  
 
Reporting to [COMPANY_001]  
 
To ensure patient safety, every SAE, regardless of suspected causality, occurring after the patient 
has provided the ma in informed consent and until at least [ADDRESS_306863] be reported as follow -up to the original 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_5319] 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow -up in formation. An SAE 
occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a 
previously reported one should be reported separately as a new event.  
 
Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Serious Adverse Ev ent Report 
Form; all applicable sections of the form must be completed in order to provide a clinically 
thorough report. The investigator must assess and record the relationship of each SAE to each 
specific study treatment (if there is more than one study treatment), complete the SAE Report 
Form in English, and send the completed, signed form by [CONTACT_87109] 24 hours to the oncology 
[COMPANY_001] Drug Safety and  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] (DS&E) department  - Fax: (877 -778-9739) . 
 
The original copy of the SAE Report Form and the  fax confirmation sheet must be kept with the 
case report form documentation at the study site.  
 
Follow -up information is sent to the same contact(s) to whom the original SAE Report Form was 
sent, using a new SAE Report Form stating that this is a follow -up to the previously reported 
SAE and giving the date of the original report. Each re -occurrence, complication, or progression 
of the original event should be reported as a follow -up to that event regardless of when it occurs. 
The follow -up information shou ld describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and 
how it was treated, whether the blind was broken or not, and whether the patient continued or 
withdrew from study participation.  
  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-019 
Protocol Version Date:  August  6, 2019   
 
41  
If the SAE is not previously documented in the Investigator’s Brochure or Package Insert (new 
occurrence) and is thought to be related to the [COMPANY_001] study treatment, an oncology [COMPANY_001] 
Drug Safety and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] (DS&E) department associate may urgently require further 
information from the investigator for Healt h Authority reporting. [COMPANY_001] may need to issue an 
Investigator Notification (IN), to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same 
drug that this SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be colle cted and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics 
committees in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC or as per national regulatory requirements 
in participating countries.  
 
Pregnancies  
 
To ensure patient safety, each pregnancy occurring wh ile the patient is on study treatment must 
be reported to [COMPANY_001] within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be 
followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the 
birth, and the presen ce or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal 
and/or newborn complications.  
 
Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form and reported by [CONTACT_36926][INVESTIGATOR_066] (DS&E). 
Pregnancy follow -up should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of 
the possible relationship to the study treatment an d pregnancy outcome. Any SAE experienced 
during pregnancy must be reported on the SAE Report F orm. 
 
Pregnancy outcomes must be collected for the female partners of any males who took study 
treatment in this study. Consent to report information regarding these pregnancy outcomes 
should be obtained from the mother.  
 
Women of childbearing potential sh ould be advised to use highly effective contraception 
methods while they are receiving study treatment and up to [ADDRESS_306864] be reported to the DFCI Office for Human Research Studies (OHRS) .  This 
includes events meeting the criteria outlined in Section 6.2.2, as well as the following:  
 
• Grade 2 (moderate) and Grade 3 (severe) events that are unexpected and at least possibly 
related/associated with the intervention.  
 
  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-019 
Protocol Version Date:  August  6, 2019   
 
42 • All Grade 4 (life -threate ning or disabling) events that are unexpected or not specifically 
listed in the protocol as not requiring reporting.  
 
• All Grade 5 (fatal) events while the participant is enrolled and actively participating in 
the trial OR when the event occurs within [ADDRESS_306865] study intervention.  
 
Note : If the participant is in long term follow up, report the death at the time of 
continuing review.  
 
Participating investigators must report each serious adverse event within 24 hours of learning of 
the occurrence. In the event that the participating investigator does not become aware of the 
serious adverse event immediately (e.g., participant sought treatment elsewhere), the 
participating investigator is to report the event within [ADDRESS_306866] provide follow -up 
information on the serious adverse event. Follow -up information should describe whether the 
event  has resolved or continues, if and how the event was treated, and whether the participant 
will continue or discontinue study participation.  
 
Events that occur after consent but before study enrollment/registration and receiving study 
treatment do not need to be reported.   
 
7.4 Expedited Adverse Event Reporting   
 
 
• For expedited reporting purposes only:   
- AEs for the agent (s) that are listed above should be reported only if the adverse event 
varies in nature, intensity or frequency from the expected toxicity inf ormation which 
is provided . 
 
7.4.1 DF/HCC Expedited Reporting Guidelines  
 
Investig ative sites within DF/HCC will report AEs directly to the DFCI Office for 
Human Research Studies (OHRS) per the DFCI IRB  reporting policy .

8. PHARMACEUTICAL  INFORMATION  
 
A list of the adverse events and potential risks associated with the investigational agent  
administered in this study c an be found in Section 7.1.  
 
 
8.1 INC280  
 
8.1.1 Description  
 
The chemical  name [CONTACT_252397]280 drug substance  is 2-fluoro -N-methyl-4-(7-(quinolin -6-
ylmethyl)imi dazo[1,2-b][1,2,4 ]triazin -2-yl)benzamide dihydrochloride  monoh ydrate.  INC280 
has a molecular  formula of C23H21Cl2FN6O2 and a molecular weight  of 503.35 (salt form on 
monohydrate basis ). 
 
INC280 dihydrochloride monohydrate is a slightly hygrosc opic light yellow to yellow powder. 
The solubility of INC280  dihydrochloride  at 25°C is approximately 3.47 mg/mL in water; 
0.08 mg /mL in pH 6.8 and 0.72 mg/mL in pH 3.[ADDRESS_306869] order forms are 
sent directly to [COMPANY_001].  
 
 
The orally admini stered   film-coated  tablets contain  the active drug INC280,  along with  the 
following  commonly used excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]: colloidal  silicon  dioxide,  crospovidone, 
magnesium  stearate, mannitol, microcr ystalline  cellulose,  povidone,  sodium lauryl sulfate, 
and various  coating premixes.  
  
8.1.3 Storage and Stability  
 
The stability data of clinical  batches for INC280 film-coated tablets shows  acceptable  
physical and chemical stability under  desig nated storage  conditions.  Refer to the clinical 
  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-019 
Protocol Version Date:  August  6, 2019   
 
44 label for storage condition requirements.  
 
8.1.4 Compatibility  
 
 
INC280 will be administered as a single agent in this study.  
 
8.1.5 Handling  
 
Qualified personnel, familiar with procedures that minimize undue exposure to themselves and 
the environment, should undertake the preparation, handling, and safe disposal of the 
chemotherapeutic agent in a self -contained and protective environment.  
 
  
 
8.1.6 Availability  
 
INC280 will be provided by [CONTACT_252392].  
  
 
8.1.7 Preparation  
 
INC280  is presently form ulated  as an orally admini stered  capsule  dosage  form or as a 
film-coated tablet.  The tablet form will be used in this study.  
 
8.1.8 Administration  
 
INC280 tablet will be administered orally on a continuous twice daily (BID) dosing schedule, on 
a flat scale of mg/day and not individually  adjusted by [CONTACT_252393]. A complete 
cycle of treatment is defined as [ADDRESS_306870] their 
daily d osing in a drug diary.  
• Each dose of INC280 is to be taken with a glass of water (at least 8 ounces – approximately 
250 mL) and consumed over as short a time as possible (i.e., not slower than 1 tablet every 2 
minutes).  
• Patients should be instructed to swal low the tablets whole and not to chew them.  
• INC280  can be administered with or without food. The morning and the evening doses 
should be taken 12 (± 4) hours apart, although 12 -hour interval is highly recommended. The 
morning dose should be taken the same time each morning. If a dose is not taken within 4 
hours of the planned dosing time, the missed dose should not be replaced.  
• Patients should be instructed not to make up for missed doses or partial doses (i.e., when the 
entire dose is not taken as instruct ed). A missed or partial dose will be defined as a case when 
the full dose is not taken within 4 hours of the scheduled twice daily dosing. If that occurs, 
then the dose (or part remaining dose) should not be taken and dosing should restart with the

DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-019 
Protocol Version Date:  August  6, [ADDRESS_306877] – Solid Tumors  
 
For the p urposes of this study, participants  should be re -evaluated for response every  two cycles .   
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international c riteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) 
[Eur J Ca  45:228 -247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of 
the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the 
RECIST criteria.  
  
 
11.1.[ADDRESS_306878] their response classified according to t he definitions  stated below.  
(Note:  Participants  who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 
will also be considered evaluable.)  
 
Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response .  Participants  who have lesions present at 
baseline that are  evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have 
received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be 
considered evaluable for non -target disease.  The response assessment is based on the 
presence, a bsence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
11.1.[ADDRESS_306879] one dimension ( longest diameter   to be recorded) as ≥ [ADDRESS_306880] x -ray or ≥[ADDRESS_306881] be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note : Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be 
considered m easurable.    
 
Malignant lymph nodes.   To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥[ADDRESS_306882] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed.  
 
Non-measurable disease .  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-019 
Protocol Version Date:  August  6, 2019   
 
49 (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), 
are considered non -measur able disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, i nflammatory breast disease, 
abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all considered  
non-measurable.  
 
Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) 
since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cy stic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -
cystic lesions are present in the same participant, these are preferred for selection as 
target lesions.  
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target 
lesions  and recorded and  measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved 
organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend its elf 
to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be 
measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal 
lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calcula ted and reported 
as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the 
short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to 
further characterize any objective tumor regression in the  measurable dimension of the 
disease.  
 
Non-target lesions .  All othe r lesions  (or sites of disease)  including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions  and 
should also be recorded at baseline. Me asurements of these lesions are not required, but 
the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow up.  
 
11.1.3  Metho ds for Evaluation of Disease  
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in m etric not ation using a ruler, calipers , 
or a digital measurement tool .  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as 
possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning 
of the treatment.  
 
The same method of assessme nt and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-019 
Protocol Version Date:  August  6, 2019   
 
50  
Clinical lesions . Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial ( e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm in diame ter as 
assessed using calipers  (e.g., skin nodules).  In  the case of skin lesions, documentation by 
[CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray.  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptabl e as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined an d surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]; h owever, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI . This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT thickness is 5mm or l ess. If CT scans have slice 
thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size of a measurable lesion should be twice 
the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body scans).   
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excell ent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable globally.  As wi th CT, if an MRI is performed, the 
technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the 
evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at 
follow -up should be the same as was used at ba seline and the lesions should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST 
guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scann er should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body  scans 
should be performed with breath -hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
 
FDG -PET. While FDG -PET response assessments need additional s tudy, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis 
of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the follow ing algorithm:  
(a) Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.  
(b)  No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site o f disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is 
PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease 
on CT, additional follow -up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is truly 
progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD  will be the date of the initial 
abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a 
pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic 
images, this is not PD.  
(c)  FDG -PET may be used to upgr ade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent 
fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be 
prospectively described in the protocol and supported  by [CONTACT_4623] -specific medical 
literature for the indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches 
  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-019 
Protocol Version Date:  August  6, 2019   
 
51 may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy 
resolution/sensitivity.  
 
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means  one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
PET-CT. At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT q uality for use with RECIST 
measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a 
PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIS T measurements and can be 
used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over 
time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which 
may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or seriall y performed.   
MIBG (meta -iodobenzylguanidine) .The following is recommended, to assure high 
quality images are obtained.  
Patient preparation: Iodides, usually SSKI (saturated solution of potassium iodide), 
are administered to reduce thyroidal accumulation  of free radioiodine, preferably 
beginning the day prior to injection and continuing for 3 additional days (4 days 
total). For infants and children,  one drop t.i.d. is sufficient , for adolescents 2 drops 
t.i.d., and for adults 3 drops t.i.d.  Participants  and/or parents are asked about exposure 
to potential interfering agents. If none is noted, an indwelling intravenous line is 
established. The dose of MIBG is administered by [CONTACT_67481] 90 
seconds.  
Images from the head to the distal low er extremities should be obtained.  
I-123MIBG scintigraphy is performed to obtain both planar and tomographic images.  
Planar: Anterior and posterior views from the top of the head to the proximal lower 
extremities are obtained for 10 minutes at 24 hours a nd occasionally at 48 hours 
following injection of 10 mCi/1.7 square meters of body surface area (~150 μCi/kg, 
maximum 10 mCi). Anterior views of the distal lower extremities are adequate. A 
large field of view dual head gamma camera with low energy collimators is preferred.   
 
SPECT: Most participants  receiving I -[ADDRESS_306883]/CT may be performed at institutions with this capacity.  
 
Ultrasound . Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-019 
Protocol Version Date:  August  6, [ADDRESS_306884] in selected instances.  
 
Endoscopy, Laparosco py. The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised . However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where 
recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 
Tumor markers . Tumor markers alone cann ot be used to assess response. If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, t hey must normalize for a participant  to be 
considered in complete cl inical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA-125 response 
(in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been 
published [ JNCI  96:487 -488, 2004; J Clin Oncol  17, 3461 -3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol  
26:1148 -1159, 2008].  In  addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed 
CA-[ADDRESS_306885] -line trials in ovarian cancer [ JNCI  92:1534 -1535, 2000].  
 
Cytology, Histology . These techniqu es can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of the t reatment) and progressive disease.  
 
11.1.4  Response Criteria  
 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 
mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as refe rence the smallest sum on study (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 
  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-019 
Protocol Version Date:  August  6, 2019   
 
53 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  
the appearance of one or more new  lesions is also considered progressions).  
 
Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis).  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  Appearance of one or more n ew lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non -target lesions.  Unequivocal progression  
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall 
disease status change, not a single lesion increase.     
 
Although a cl ear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_33954], and the progression 
status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal 
Investigator).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evalua tion of New Lesions  
 
The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal (i.e. not due to difference in 
scanning technique, imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something 
other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply heal ing or 
flare of pre -existing lesions). However, a lesion identified on a follow -up scan in an 
anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered new and will 
indicate PD. If a new lesion is equivocal (because of small size etc.), follow -up 
evaluation will clarify if it truly represents new disease and if PD is confirmed, 
progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan on which the lesion 
was discovered.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best 
  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-019 
Protocol Version Date:  August  6, 2019

confirmation criteria.

DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-019 
Protocol Version Date:  August  6, 2019   
 
55 Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement c riteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first 
date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started , or 
death due to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the last 
disease evaluation ). 
 
Duration of overall complete response : The duration of overall CR is measured from the 
time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the firs t date that progressive disease 
is objectively documented , or death due to any cause. Participants without events 
reported are censored at the last disease evaluation .  
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatmen t 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
11.1.6  Progression -Free Survival  
 
 
Overall Survival : Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the t ime from randomization (or 
registration) to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive.  
 
Progression -Free Survival : Progression -Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from 
randomization (or registration) to the earlier of progression or death due to any cause. 
Participants alive without disease progression are censored at date of last disease 
evaluation.  
 
Time to Progression : Time to Progression (TTP) is defined as the time from 
randomization (or registration) to progression, or censor ed at date of last disease 
evaluation for those without progression reported.

13.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
This is an open label Phase II study  enrolling patients with MET exon [ADDRESS_306889] previously been treated with a MET inhibitor .   
The primar y endpoint is response rate (RR) as measured by [CONTACT_393]  1.1 criteria.   
Secondary endpoints are : 
Progression -Free Survival (PFS):  PFS will be defined as the time from the start of study 
drug to the date of first documented progression or death.  
Disease con trol rate (DCR) : Disease control rate  will be defined as the sum of complete 
response, partial response, and stable disease  at [ADDRESS_306890] 1.1.  
Intracranial response rate (IRR): Intracranial response rate will be calculated based on 
response assessm ents in the brain for patients with measurable CNS disease at baseline by 
[CONTACT_393] v 1.1 criteria.  
Duration of response (DOR): Duration of response will be calculated from the  time of first 
assessment of CR or PR until the first occurrence of progressive dis ease or death.   
Overall survival (OS): Overall survival will be defined as the time from the start of study 
drug to the date of death due to any cause.  OS time for patients who are alive at the end of hte 
study or are lost to follow up will be censored at  the time of last contact. OS will be estimated 
using the Kaplan -Meier method.  
Safety and tolerability: Toxicity will be assessed using the CTCAE v4. 0 criteria.  
 
 
Exploratory studies will assess biomarkers of response and resistance as well as attempt to 
establish cell lines and PDX models from optional tumor biopsies.  
 All patients who begin study drug on protocol will be considered evaluable.   Any patient 
who does not begin study drug on protocol will be considered not evaluable and will be 
 replaced.

University of Tennessee research ers with experience conducting fluoroscopic research studies, as 
well as either a PI [INVESTIGATOR_12749] -PI [INVESTIGATOR_25810], and possibly [CONTACT_743050]’ staff will be present during the 
fluoroscopy procedure to walk subjects through the activities. A radiation technician (RT) employed by [CONTACT_826508]: deep knee bend.  For the DKB activity, the subjects were instructed to begin at full extension on a raised platform and take a step back while flexing their knee as far as they could, in order to obtain a maximum flexion value for each subject. For this activity, images were taken  at 30° increments from full extension (0°) to maximum flexion (MAX) for the entire 
flexion/extension cycle. Patients were examined while performing these activities using a C- Arm 
type fluoroscopic unit. The fluoroscopic videos were captured digitally and transferred to a secure lab network for subsequent analysis.    If a subject does no t meet the inclusion criteria, s/he  will not be tested. If the p articipant still 
meets all study criteria, s/he will be asked to practice the activities to ensure s/he can comfortably complete them and experience no pain with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826507] (no radiation).  The practice portion of the data collection without radiation will not be video-recorded . During the fluoroscopy procedure, the RT will follow the motion of the implanted knee 
with the fluoroscopy machine;
 only the knee joint (from the fluoroscopy machine) wi ll be 
recorded on the fluoroscopy footage . The participant will be allowed to rest as  necessary and be 
instructed to stop the activity at the first sign of pain.   
Page [ADDRESS_1146372] been acquired to complete the study. Radiation time will be kept as low as reasonably achievable ( ALARA) and 
will not exceed two minutes. The RT will start the fluoroscope just prior to the subject beginning each activity trial and will stop the fluoroscope immediately after the subject completes each activity trial to ensure that the subject is not ex posed during idol periods. Fluoroscopy on- time 
will be recorded on each subject’s IC.  
 The fluoroscopic footage for these activities will be stored on digital video files on a secure computer workstation, uploaded onto the secure CMR database by [CONTACT_826509], where identifiable data will be removed and substituted for data that cannot identify the subject (e.g., dates of birth will be removed and replaced with number of months the individual has been alive). Subjects will be assigned study and subject- specific 
identifiers which is how the system will distinguish the datasets.    DATA ANALYSIS   The kinematic  variables of interest included the femoral and tibial 3D rotational and translational 
kinematics. The relative motion  of the femoral component and tibial component wer e calculated 
based on the transformation matrices of each rigid body. This information was then used to extract anterior/posterior low points and contact [CONTACT_826510]/external rotation  of the 
femoral component with respect to the tibial component.  Once the subjects have completed the activity, the fluoroscopic videos will be stored  digitally and specific frames of interest will be captured from the video and exported into the preprocessing software. The specific frames of interested will be full extension, maximum knee flexion (both inclusive), and 30º knee flexion increments during the complete flexion cycle.   Our 3D to 2D registration technique will be used to overlay the 3D models of the implanted components on their projection in the 2D fluoroscopic image. The fluoroscopic video would be digitized into frames and corrected for distortion. From here, the distortion-free images would be used with the 3D to 2D registration technique to extract in vivo patient femorotibial kinematics, which involves overlaying the 3D models of the components on their projection in the 2D fluoroscopic image.   Statistical analysis of the data will be carried out to analyze the two cohorts. All variables, exc ept 
for lift -off and VAG, will be denoted as continuous. The data will be first checked for normality 
using the Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152]-Wilk test. Only when the data is found to be normally distributed will parametric tests be used; otherwise, non -parametric tests will be  used. The data will also be 
tested for equality of variance using the Barlett’s test and Levene’s test. The final selection criterion for the type of test to conduct will be based on the check for normality, as well as the check for equal variance. Theref ore, for all the continuous variables, the following tests will be 
used:  1. Student’s t-test (when the data is normally distributed and has equal variance). 2. Welch Anova test (when the data is normally distributed but has unequal variance). 
Page [ADDRESS_1146373] (when the data is not normally distributed).  
 
Lift-off, as applicable, will be treated as a categorical variable in this study and a contingency 
analysi s using the Fisher’s exact test will be carried out. All statistical tests will be carried out at 
95% confidence level (α=0.05) and will be performed using JMP® Statistical DiscoveryTM (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) software.    SPECIFIC RISKS AND PROTECTION MEASURES  
 1. Fluoroscopic Procedures  
 As with every clinical study, there may be some risks.  However, doses of radiation exposure received will be much lower than those known to produce detectable health effects.   Previously 
reported literature shows that fluoroscopy-based procedure (angiography) on the lower limb result in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_743035] 0.83 mSv per min (0.083 rem per min) (Verdun
1).  Mettler, et 
al have reported that the typi[INVESTIGATOR_532274] a conventional knee procedure is 0.005 mSv (0.0005 rem)
2.  According to either estimate, the additional risk of a fluoroscopic procedure 
involving the knee ranges between "Negligible" to "Low" for a 2 minute exam (Verdun).  A previous fluoroscopy TKA study conducted at another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4791] a 2 minute on- time limit 
shows that the average effective dose was 0.14 mSv (0.0014 rem) with a maximum dose of 0.27 mSv (0.027 rem).  The additional risk for all subjects in this previous study would be considered "Negligible".   To account for patient variability and differences in imagining techniques, all 
subjects enrolled in this study will receive less than 2 rem.   2 rem is considered "Low" risk.  It is 
unlikely that anyone in this study will approach the [ADDRESS_1146374] for the entire experiment . The participant's 
knee joint will be fluoroscoped using negligible to low risk levels of radiation according to published literature .  
  The participant has the right to stop the procedure at any time; researchers or the RT can end the procedures at any time if they feel the participant is at risk, but the participant can choose to remain in the study if s/he feels that there  is no risk to her/his surgical procedure or recuperation.  
 We are estimating a total maximum time of [ADDRESS_1146375] time to complete the IC form, ask any questions s/he may have, practice the activities or repeat any activities that 
could not be completed, and collect all necessary fluoroscopy data from each subject.

Clinical Observations:  
There are no clinical observations made during this data collection or from the images obtained through data collection. There will be no radiology report generated for this procedure conducted as a result of this study. Therefore, no RT will review such a report for the procedures, which would be the only way such a “significant problem” would be determined. It is not anticipated that the imaging collected during this study would potentially provide benefit to specific subjects by [CONTACT_826512]. Cates’ tr eatment plan.
 
 BENEFITS  
The potential benefits from this study include, but are not limited to: 
• Better understanding of the joints analyzed with the same technique in the past. 
• Future implant design improvements based on the kinematic findings. 
• New and adv anced surgical techniques for TKA based on the results.

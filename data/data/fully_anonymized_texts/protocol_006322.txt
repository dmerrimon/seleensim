Study Title  
Application of Economics & Social psychology to improve Opi[INVESTIGATOR_365836] (AESOPS): A cluster randomized trial  
Objectives  
There is a lack of evidence that long -term opi[INVESTIGATOR_365837] . 
The objective of the Application of Economics & Social psychology to improve Opi[INVESTIGATOR_365836] (AESOPS) trial  is 
to develop and test novel behavioral nudges to encourage adherence to Oregon Pain Guidance and CDC guidelines for opi[INVESTIGATOR_365838]. We have successfully developed and pi[INVESTIGATOR_365839] R21 phase, then we compare these nudge interventions across [ADDRESS_457528] to clinician participants and "repeated cross -
sectional" with respect to patient observations because the visit observations used for analyses may come from different sets  of 
patients over time. We randomized at the clinic level to avoid intra -clinic contamination of the intervention. 
  
Interventions and Duration. The intervention period will be 18- months in length for all participants, with a 6- month follow -up 
period to measure persistence of effects after interventions end.  The following intervention conditions will be compared:  
Condition 1: Education, justifications, and precommitments . Guideline education consists of receiving the CDC guidelines and 
completing a brief online educational module at the start of the study period. This will include educational clinical content  
related to the CDC guidelines, the Oregon Pain Guidance document, tapering training and other resources tapering training and other resources such as SAMHSA Medication -Assisted Treatment Physician Locator and the Naloxone Provider Guide. When 
prescribing an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], clinicians are prompted to record an explicit justifi cation that appears in the patient electronic health 
record. Justifications are tailored to first time prescriptions, greater than first time prescriptions, but less than 91 days ; and high 
dose chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538] > 90 days of use.  
Condition 2: Guideline Education Control . Control group clinicians will receive the CDC guideline and will complete a brief 
online educational module at the start of the study period. This will include educational clinical content related to the CDC  
guidelines, the Oregon Pain Guidance document, tapering training and other resources tapering training and other resources 
9 
  such as SAMHSA Medication -Assisted Treatment Physician Locator and the Naloxone Provider Guide. 
Outcome Measures:  The primary outcome is clinician aggregate monthly morphine milligram equivalent (MME) dosing. 
This will be measured for two groups: (i) 50 MME and above, and (ii) below [ADDRESS_457529] one visit where >  50 MME daily 
dose triggered high dose decision support. Otherwise, observations are placed in the < 50 MME condition. We will estimate daily milligram morphine equivalent for each clinician by [CONTACT_365921] a monthly observation period divided by [CONTACT_256193] 30 days. For example, suppose a clinician had three qualifying visits over three days in one month and prescribed: Patient #1 is prescribed 200mg ME/day x 30 days, Patient #2 has tapered from 200 mg ME/day to now 100mg ME/day x 30 days and Patient # 3 is on a tapering plan from 60 to 30 mg ME/day and is receiving 50 mg ME/day x 15 days.  The clinician’s outcome for that mont h then equals:  
   [(200 mg/day x 30 days) + 100 mg/day x 30 days) + (50 mg/day x 15 days)]  x [1 Month/30 days]  
= (300 mg x 1 + 100 mg x 1  + 50 mg x (½) ) = 425 mg MED/[Month]. 
This measures can capture the influence of all relevant CDC guideline prescribing endpoints that aim to reduce reliance on opi[INVESTIGATOR_365840]: 1) Use of alternatives to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (CDC recommendation 1), 2) use of lowest effective starting dose  (CDC recommendation 5), 3) lower duration acute pain prescriptions (CDC recommendation 6), 4) Tapering 
(CDC recommendation 7), 5) avoidance of co- prescribing (CDC recommendation 11) and 6) referral for medication assisted 
therapy to substitute buprenorphi ne (CDC recommendation 12).  The measures excludes visits below >  50mg ME/day as these 
are low risk for adverse events. Our secondary outcome though captures transitions from low to high dose prescribing.  Prescribing data on opi[INVESTIGATOR_365841]’s  National 
Drug Code files for scheduled drugs. Oral buprenorphine will be excluded from the calculations as it relates to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2571].  Morphine equivalent dose will be computed by [CONTACT_365922].
(Vieweg, Carlyle 
Lipps, and Fernandez 2005)  Qualifying pain visits will be captured by [CONTACT_365923]10 pain diagnostic codes and 
excluding active cancer diagnoses. 
One of the secondary outcomes is the proportion of dosages that escalated to >  50 MME/day over time, which is a computable 
clinical quality measure from the electronic health record.  This is widely used in medicine to evaluate quality improvement and reliability and validity are generally supported.
(Persell 2006)  Visits are excluded from the denominator when patients have 
an active cancer or acute pain diagnosis that makes CDC guidelines not apply. Numerator visits are guideline discordant inappropriate actions that occurred at a denominator visit: co- prescription and transition from prior prescription above the 50 
mg/day threshold. Daily milligram morphine equivalent for each clinician will be estimated by [CONTACT_365921] a monthly observation period divided by 30 days. Additional secondary outcomes include the change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_365842] -level prescription drug monitoring program 
10 
  (PDMP) data.  
STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1.[ADDRESS_457530] grown to become a public health crisis. Today, on average 1 in 5 persons  with 
chronic noncancer pain receives an opi[INVESTIGATOR_365843] U.S. (Dowell, Haegerich, and Chou 2016)  Yet, despi[INVESTIGATOR_365844], reports of pain in America have not gone down. (Daubresse et al. 2013; Chang et al. 2014)   The greater availability of 
prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_365845].  In 2015, there were 
over 365,[ADDRESS_457531] ever been recorded in 
U.S. history.(“Website” n.d.)   The costs of prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_365846].  Aggregate costs for prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_365847] $78.5 billion (in 2013 dollars).  One -fourth of the aggregate economic burden is publicly funded (i.e., Medicaid, 
Medicare, and veteran s' programs). (“[No Title]”  n.d.; Florence et al. 2016)  
In 2016, the CDC issued the “CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opi[INVESTIGATOR_187496]” which gives 12 patient care recommendati ons: 
(1) use alternatives  to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], (2) set realistic goals  for pain and function, (3) discuss opi[INVESTIGATOR_365848], (4) use 
immediate release agents  instead of long- acting ones, (5) use lowest effective starting dose, avoid escalation above 50 milligram (mg) 
morphine equivalent (ME) daily dose and abide by a 90 mg ME/day dose prescribing limit, (6) prescribe lowest dose at lowest quantity needed for acute pain—usually 3 days with a maximum of 7 days in rare cases  (7) evaluate for and discuss tapering within 1 -  4 weeks 
and after 90 days, (8) prescribe naloxone and evaluate substance use history  with opi[INVESTIGATOR_16447], (9) review the state prescription 
drug monitoring program data (10)  conduct urine drug tests  to provide information about drug use that is not reported by [CONTACT_102], 
(11) avoid co -prescribing  with benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and (12) refer patients with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2495] d use disorder to medication- assisted treatment in 
11 
  combination with behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] .  Our objective is to increase adherence to the CDC guideline and Oregon Pain Guidance pain 
management guideline. To evaluate the effects of doing so, we will measure as a primary outcomes clinician aggregate monthly mg ME 
for patient visits with > 50 mg ME daily dose. Secondary outcomes include rate of dose escalation to > 50 mg ME/day. 
2.[ADDRESS_457532] an 
explicit justification for why they are prescribing an opi[INVESTIGATOR_365849]’s EHR. Accountable justifications incorporate several behavioral principles.  First, they signal an injunctive norm (a norm, often provided by [CONTACT_365924], tha t strongly 
indicates how people should behave) indicating that prescribing an opi[INVESTIGATOR_365850]. This may make the clinician  more 
likely to believe both that not prescribing an opi[INVESTIGATOR_365851].  Second, it incorporates social accountability.  A clinician  justification become an explicit, separate part of the 
medical record, so a clinician ’s decision to prescribe is subject to the review and judgment of the provider’s peers. Third, the 
justification alert implicitly designates guideline -concordant prescribing as the default action. Defaults are options that are exercised if 
the decision mak er takes no special action to opt in or out of a given choice. Prior to our intervention, choosing to deviate from 
guidelines did not carry a special requirement to document a clinical rationale in the EHR.  Accountable justifications, ther efore, reset 
the default action. Guideline -concordant treatment choices will not require special justification, but a clinician  must now “opt -in” to 
prescribing an opi[INVESTIGATOR_365852] a justification for which they are accountable.  
Rationale for Precommitments .  Precommitment asks the decision -maker to commit to a future expectation.  This intervention targets 
patients with problematic opi[INVESTIGATOR_365853]. For these patients, taper discussions may be 
perceived as difficult to initiate at the present time, but perceived as easier in the future because of present bias. (Loewenstein and 
Prelec 1992)  Our hypothesis is that the choice to discuss a taper with the patient may benefit from a precommitment. (Goldstein, 
Cialdini, and Griskevicius, n.d.; Cialdini et al. 1978)   
In applied work, use of precommitment to a behavior has had notable success.  For example, people often state they want to sa ve for 
retirement but fail to follow through with their intent.  The “Save More Tomorrow” retirement savings study elicited a preco mmitment 
of future raises to retirement funds; this study increased savings from 3.5 percent to 13.6 percent over the course of 40 months.(Thaler 
and Benartzi 2004)    In our own work in health, we found that physician public precommitment to judicious antibiotic use reduced 
inappropriate antibiotic prescribing by 19.7 percentage points.(Meeker et al. 2014)

  3. STUDY  DESIGN   
The Application of Economics & Social psychology to improve Opi[INVESTIGATOR_365836] (AESOPS) trial is a two arm multi -site 
cluster randomized trial.  The primary aim is to test the ability of two  interventions based on behavioral economic principles to reduce 
the reliance on opi[INVESTIGATOR_365854] . We will randomize practices in one of 2 conditions:  1) 
Education, justifications, and precommitments : When prescribing an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], clinicians are prompted to record an explicit justification 
that appears in the patient electronic health record. Justifications are tailored to first time prescriptions, greater than first time 
prescriptions, but less than 91 days ; and high dose chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538] > 90 days of use. ( 2) Guideline Education Control . We will 
have a sufficient sample size (374 clinics) to detect small effects on the primary outcomes. A null finding will indicate evi dence of 
negligible or no effect. Northwestern includes 55 primary care clinics that contain 289 clinicians with 12,552 patients on chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_365855]—opi[INVESTIGATOR_207733] 3 months. Altamed Medical Group has 30 clinics with 134 clinicians with 17,674 such patients.  The primary outcome is milligram morphine equivalents tiered to two levels: (i) above, and (ii) below [ADDRESS_457533] one visit where > 50 mg ME daily dose triggered high dose decision support. Otherwise, observations are placed in the < 50 mg 
ME condition. Secondary, outcomes are benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_327528] -prescribing and rate of dose escalation to >  50 mg ME/day. We will 
estimate daily milligram morphine equivalent for each clinician by [CONTACT_365925] a monthly observation period divided by [CONTACT_256193] 30 days. Data from electronic medical records for participating practices are transferred to the Data Coordinating Center on a weekly basis.   
4. SELECTION  AND  ENROLLMENT  OF PARTICIPANTS   
4.1 Inclusion Criteria   
The subjects involved in this trial are clinicians who will be recruited from multiple clinical sites in Illinois  and [LOCATION_004].  The target 
group of physicians (and the patients that they treat) is fully inclusive and representative.  Clinicians will be eligible if  they treat adult 
patients. We will request a waiver of consent for physician participation, but will enrol l for any survey assessments. 
 Each study clinic is required to have an electronic health record (EHR) system in place and have its own physical building (a s opposed 
to multiple clinics sharing the same space, such as the floor of a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], where interactions between providers assigned to different intervention groups would be more likely).  Clinicians must meet the following inclusion criteria to participate in this study:  1) treat adult patients and 2) practice at one of the study clinics.  An office visit is eligible for inclusion in the outcome denominator if: 1) the patient was 18 years old or older, 2) the provider and practice site were enrolled in the study, and 3) the visit occurred during the 18- month intervention period. 
[ADDRESS_457534] active cancer. Cancer exclusions (ICD -10 codes) are listed here . 
4.[ADDRESS_457535] goals of the study, a general description of the intervention, compensation providers would receive for participation, and a link to the electronic consent form and baseline survey.  
The baseline survey includes an educational module. After providing consent, providers are asked to complete a 15 to 20 minut e 
online survey and educational module. The educational module contains information about pain management (Oregon Pain Guidance ) 
and safe opi[INVESTIGATOR_365856] (CDC guidelines). The educational module also describes the interventions to which a 
clinician’s site was assigned, including changes they would observe in their electronic health record.  
5. STUDY  INTERVENTIONS   
5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration   
The intervention period will be 18- months in length for all participants, with a 6- month follow -up period to measure persistence of 
effects after interventions end. The pre -intervention baseline period will be 6 months in length.   
5.2 Handling of Study Interventions   
The two conditions to be compared will be referred to as Nudges (Condition 1) and Control (Condition 2). Both groups will receive 
guideline education. Guideline education consists of receiving the CDC guidelines and completing a brief online educational module 
at the start of the study period. This will include educational clinical content related to the CDC guidelines, the Oregon Pa in Guidance 
document, tapering training and other resources tapering training and other resources such as SAMHSA Medication- Assisted 
Treatment Physician Locator and the Naloxone Provider Guide.  
Physicians in clinics randomized to the Nudges Condition will be prompted with an EHR nudge if the prescribing history for the patient falls into one of the following three categories: opi[INVESTIGATOR_2583]ïve or no recent opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], opi[INVESTIGATOR_365857] [ADDRESS_457536] a start date less than 91 days. The criteria for an opi[INVESTIGATOR_365857] 90 days include: (1) an order for an included 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_365858] a start date greater than 1 day and less than 91 days and (2) not an opi[INVESTIGATOR_365859] a start date greater than 90 
days. The criteria for chronic, high dose opi[INVESTIGATOR_365860]’s dose is greater than 50 MME, two or more 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_365861] 1 day and less than 91 days, and an opi[INVESTIGATOR_365859] a start 
date greater than 90 days.  
The nudges included in Condition 1 are Accountable Justification (AJ) alerts, Precommitments (PR) to tapering and the PainTra cker 
tool. Accountable Justification alerts pertain to tapering, high dose prescribing, co- prescribing and short duration prescribi ng for acute 
pain diagnoses. AJ is an EHR -based intervention that will prompt the clinician to justify, in a free text response, the decision to 
prescribe an opi[INVESTIGATOR_365862]/high dose prescribing. The prompt is designed to inform the clinician that others will see 
the justification in the patient’s medical record as a “High risk prescribing justification” note, and that if no justification is entered, the 
phrase “no justification given” will appear in the medical record. The behavioral economic principles underlying accountable justification include injunctive norms, social accountability and defaults. These AJ nudges have proven effective in a previous trial set in different prescribing contexts (Madrian and Shea 2001).  
Precommitments (PR) is an EHR -based intervention tailored to high dose opi[INVESTIGATOR_365863] 
a taper discussion with the patient. Precommitments to taper discussions with patients may prompt physicians to initiate th ese 
conversations that may seem easier to tackle in the future due to present bias. PainTracker is a pain assessment tool aimed at broadening the understanding of pain and reframing the patient visit around reaching functional goals. It consists of the pat ient’s self -
reported pain and prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_365864]. AJ, PR and PainTracker are developed within the EPIC electronic healt h 
record system.

  6.2 Description of Evaluations   
6.2.1 Screening Evaluation  
Consenting Procedure  
Consenting will only apply for survey assessments. The main study will seek a waiver of consent. With the assistance of each 
site’s medical director, we will send providers at participating sites an introductory email that includes a description of the broad goals of the study, a general description of the intervention, and a link to the electronic consent form and baseline survey.  The consent document will indicate that participation is voluntary and that decisions to participate (or not) will have no bearing on any provider’s status at his or her clinic. Providers who provide consent to participate will be asked to complete 
an online survey and will be reimbursed for their time. W e will send up to [ADDRESS_457538] them in person when feasible.   
6.2.2 Enrollment, Baseline, and/or Randomization 
Enrollment  
We have a waiver of consent for the trial.   The intervention will be turned on for all clinics/clinicians  randomized to receive 
the intervention. Start date  of the trial will be recorded for each clinic.  
 
Baseline Assessments  
 
● Baseline prescribing monthly morphine equivalents  
● Baseline survey to assess provider characteristics and provider attitudes toward practice guidelines, clinical decision support, electronic health records, and practice environment. 
 
Randomization 
We will implement a cluster -randomized design at the clinic level to avoid contamination that might occur if individual  
providers in close proximity are randomized to different interventions. Providers who practice at multiple clinics will be  
assigned to the intervention of the clinic for which they spend at least 85% of their time.  Geographically distinct individual  
clinics will be the unit of randomization. We will conduct a block randomization of clinics by [CONTACT_365926].[ADDRESS_457539].  Clinics will incorporate exclusions (ICD 10 cancer suppressor codes found here
) used in the decision to trigger the clinical decision support.  
Aggregate counts of total  visits across sites for which the intervention was triggered, for high dose opi[INVESTIGATOR_200667], if abrupt changes to 
dose (> 20% morphine equivalent daily dose) were made.  Such cases will be examined closely to determine if unsafe drops in opi[INVESTIGATOR_365865] . 
7.[ADDRESS_457540] recent 
prescription exceeds > 49 morphine equivalent daily dose; or as reported to study staff .(Dowell, Haegerich, and Chou 2019)  
Emergency department visits will also be evaluated as well as increases  in prescribing > 20% presumably in response to reports of 
worsening pain.  
7.[ADDRESS_457541] (D SMB) 
assembled for this study. When notified of an unanticipated event, the DSMB will convene and make a decision as to whether the  
study should continue. The IRB will also be notified of the DSMB's decision. 7.[ADDRESS_457542] (DSMB) will be  established by [CONTACT_4289].  The following individuals were recommended to NIH with 
expertise in either opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], overprescribing or biostatistics/research methods: Joe Frank, Jeanmarie Perrone, and Carl Peiper.  
[ADDRESS_457543] lower opi[INVESTIGATOR_365866]. This hypothesis will be evaluated in an intent -to-treat difference -in-differences 
framework using a  mixed -effects regression model on clinician morphine equivalent daily dose. Fixed effects will include the 
effects of interventions over time (i.e., interactions between randomization assignment and time), using a 6- months prior to the 
intervention baseli ne period. Providers and randomization unit (clinic) will be modeled as random effects. 
Design  
The Application of Economics & Social psychology to improve Opi[INVESTIGATOR_365836] (AESOPS) trial is a two arm multi -site 
cluster randomized trial.  The primary aim is to test the ability of three interventions based on behavioral economic principles to 
reduce the reliance on opi[INVESTIGATOR_365854]. We will randomize practices in one of two conditions: 1) Education, justifications, and precommitments : When prescribing an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], clinicians are prompted to record an 
explicit justification that appears in the patient electronic health record. Justifications are tailored to first time prescr iptions, greater 
than first time prescriptions, but less than 91  days; and high dose chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538] > 90 days of use. (2) Guideline education 
control . We will have a sufficient sample size (374 clinics) to detect small effects on the primary outcomes.  
 Outcome Measures  
The primary outcomes is clinician aggregate monthly mg morphine equivalent. This will be evaluated for two groups: (i) above, and (ii) below [ADDRESS_457544] one visit where > 50 mg ME daily dose triggered high dose decision support. Otherwise, observat ions 
are placed in the < 50 mg ME condition. One of the secondary outcomes is the proportion of dosages that escalated to > 50 
MME/day over time. Daily milligram morphine equivalent for each clinician will be estimated by [CONTACT_365921] a monthly observation period divided by 30 days. Additional secondary outcomes include the change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_365842] -level prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) 
data.  
[ADDRESS_457545] a sufficient sample size (374 clinics) to detect small effects on the primary outcomes. A null finding 
will indicate evidence of negligible or no effect. Northwestern includes 55 primary care clinics that contain 289 clinicians with 12,552 patients on chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_365867] —opi[INVESTIGATOR_207733] 3 months. Sutter includes 273 primary care 
clinics containing 1,289 clinicians with 53,401 patients with noncancer pain who receive chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538]. Altamed Medi cal 
Group has 30 clinics with 134 clinicians with 17,674 such patients.  .  
 
Assuming an average of 5 clinicians participating per clinic, clinic -level ICC of 0.055 for clinics and 0.03 for clinicians, and 
Bonferroni multiple -comparison corrections for 3 comparisons (each active treatment arm to control and with each other), we 
calculate the following number of clinics needed to achieve 0.8 and 0.85 statistical power for a one -tailed tests at the 0.05 level of 
significance for 3- , 5-, 7- and 12- percentage point reductions in the primary outcome.  Based on Weimer et al.,(Weimer et al. 2016)
 
we assume baseline high dose ( > 50mg ME/day) opi[INVESTIGATOR_188793] 260 ( + 35) milligram morphine equivalents daily dose per high- dose 
patient.  With [ADDRESS_457546] greater than an 85% chance to detect a 3% change in 
high- dose opi[INVESTIGATOR_365868].  
 
Table 1.  Number of total   number of clinics needed to detect a reduction from 260(+35) MME daily long -term opi[INVESTIGATOR_365869]  3% 5% 7% 12%  
0.80 120 clinics  45 clinics  27 clinics  9 clinics  
0.85 138 clinics  51 clinics  39 clinics  18 clinics  
For our secondary outcome, transition to high dose use from low dose use, assuming conservatively a baseline concordance rate of 70%, 
we can detect a 3% change with the use of only 260 of our 374 clinics at 80% statistical power. Randomization is described ne xt in 
Section 9.2.1. 
 
9.2.[ADDRESS_457547] 85% of their time.  
Geographically distinct individual clinics will be treated as the unit of randomization.  These are clinics belonging to one of four 
larger clinical organizations covering a connected geographic area in either Illinois  and [LOCATION_004]. We will carry out a block 
randomization of clinics by [CONTACT_365927] R.  For each clinic organization, we  will 
construct ordered collections of clinics.  We then will employ the sample function in R to return a random permutation of each ordered collection.  For each collection of clinic organizations we will draw a sample that represents the largest number of clinics within each clinic organization that was divisible by 2, the number of study arms.  We then will use the list function, a function that ties together related data that do not share the same structure, to assign each randomly permuted  clinic to a study arm, 
repeating this process until clinics have filled the two arms of the study in equal measure.  Because the number of clinics at each organization is not always divisible by 2, we will treat “remainder” clinics across all organizations differently. These remainder clinics will be randomized to conditions separately . This will be accomplished in a procedure similar to the one described above.  
Allocation of the sequence will be concealed until after the interventions were assigned.  
9.[ADDRESS_457548] will compare between study conditions the frequency of emergency department visits, frequency of patients receiving a 20% 
increase in opi[INVESTIGATOR_365870] a bruptly cut -off of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] ( >49 MMED to zero)  between visits. We will be 
extracted from study site EHRs and reported to the Board.   
9.4 Outcomes  
9.4.1 Primary outcome   
The primary outcome is clinician aggregate monthly morphine milligram equivalent (MME) dosing. This will be measured for 
two groups: (i) 50 MME and above, and (ii) below [ADDRESS_457549] one visit where > 50 MME daily dose triggered high dose decision support. Otherwise, observations are placed in the < 50 MME condition.  
 
21 
  9.4.2 Secondary outcomes   
 
One of the secondary outcomes is the proportion of dosages that escalated to > 50 MME/day over time. Daily milligram morphine  
equivalent for each clinician will be estimated by [CONTACT_365921] a monthly observation period divided by 30 days. Additional secondary outcomes include the change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_365842] -level prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) data.

Y = β1 + β2Time + β3(Time  -  t*)+ + β4Group + β5Time x Group + β6(Time -  t*)+ x Group + ζ + η + error    [1]  
 
where (z)+ is a truncated line function that equals z when z is positive and is equal to zero otherwise, ζ is the clinician r andom effect 
and η  is the clinic random effect.  In addition to the knotted spline  regression model, we will also conduct a linear mixed effects hierarchical difference- in-differences 
regression. This model has fewer interaction terms , and mitigate s convergence and collinearity errors : 
 
Y = β1 + β2Group + β3Time + β4Time x Group + ζ + η + error    [ 2]

  10. DATA  COLLECTION  AND  QUALITY  ASSURANCE  
10.1 Data Collection Forms   
Two types of data will be collected – data from electronic medical and billing records and data from self -administered online surveys 
at the beginning and end of the study.  
10.[ADDRESS_457552] model (Observational  Medical 
Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model, version 5.1).  
The data collection forms will be online surveys. The  electronic data system, Epic, will have native data capture formats.  
10.[ADDRESS_457553] of practicing clinicians from each participating clinical organization. They will review automatically refreshing dashboards for potential deviations in coding systems and appropriate values for codes for  
inclusion in the outcome measures. These dashboards will be reviewed prior to each email distribution. 10.3.3  Metrics  
Quality control metrics will be based on reports verifying visits were not for cancer exclusions . All drugs prescribed at these  
visits will be categorized as “ opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]” or “non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]”.  Incorrect categorizations will be corrected and outcome computations  
recomputed before each email is delivered.    
10.3.[ADDRESS_457554] (IRB) Review   
The study protocol for all clinic sites will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_357366]’s Institutional Review Board (IRB). Other sites will rely on the USC IRB through the SMART IRB online reliance system.

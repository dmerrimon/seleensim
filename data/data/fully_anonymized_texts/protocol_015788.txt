Page 3 of 9 A. STUDY BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE  
Hypothesis:  The addition of a low -dose ketamine infusion to usual post -operative pain 
management will improve pain control as evidenced by [CONTACT_446111] -operative 
pain scores for patients undergoing spi[INVESTIGATOR_446094].  
 
Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is the most common form of scoliosis and occurs most 
commonly in girls. In 0.2 -0.5% of cases, the curve in idiopathic scoliosis increases 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_446095], non -operative management and s urgical intervention is required. 
Patients present for spi[INVESTIGATOR_446096]. 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_446097] h opi[INVESTIGATOR_323528]. We aim to show an 
improvement in post -operative pain scores by [CONTACT_1583] a low dose infusion of ketamine 
intra- and post - operatively.  
 
Ketamine antagonizes the N -methyl -D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Its action is related to 
central  dissociation of the cerebral cortex and is thus referred to as a “dissociative 
anesthetic”. Depending on the situation and dose, ketamine can b e used for many 
different purposes  ranging from pre -operative sedation and  pain control to general 
anesthesia. For the purposes of this study, ketamine will be used as an adju nctive 
treatment for postoperative pain control. The dose appropriate for this purpose is a 0.5 
mg/kg slow bolus prior to incision followed by [CONTACT_60801] 0.2 mg/kg/hr (Cote).  For 
comparison  purposes, an induction dose of ketamine is 1 -2 mg/kg with onset of action 
less than 60 seconds and duration of action of 10 -20 minutes (Barash). Repeated bolus 
doses and prolonged infusion times will prolong the duration of action. According to [CONTACT_446120], ketamine has “one of the best safety profiles of any anesthetic agent,” and he refers 
to a study by [CONTACT_446112]. al which reviewed inadvertent overdoses of ketamin e of 5 -100x 
the intended dose  (in the emergency room setting) and identified  no long term 
compli cations despi[INVESTIGATOR_446098].  
 
The safety of ketamine as an adjunct for acute postoperative pain control has been well 
established in the literature. A review article publish ed in 2004 conclude d that adverse 
effects were not increased with small dose ketamine after review of 37 trials involving 
2385 patients , of whom 232 were children (Subramaniam 2004) .  
 
Ketamine has been used safely in clinical trials in the pediatric population. D a Conceicao 
and colleagues use d ketamine after tonsillectomy in patients [ADDRESS_567237] -tonsillectomy without unwanted side effects  (Da Conceicao 
2006) . 
 
Ketam ine has been extensively studied  as an analgesic in the postoperative setting. Many 
articles have been published with conflicting results. In 2010, Carstensen and Moller 
reviewed 11 randomized, double -blinded clinical trials of ketamine added to opi[INVESTIGATOR_446099] f or postoperative pain. They found that 6 studies showed significant ly improved 
postoperative analgesia and 5 studies showed no significant clinical improvement 
(Carstensen 2010).

Several studies indicate that ketamine can decrease opi[INVESTIGATOR_446100] e pain 
control postoperatively with minimal side effects.  In 2008, Yamauchi et al. showed  that a 
ketamine bolus of 1 mg/kg followed by [CONTACT_60801] . 042 mg/kg/hr or . 083 mg/kg/hr  
lowered the pain scores after cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_446101] 20 -70 year s of age  
(Yamauchi 2008) . A prospective, randomized double -blinded study in 2007 demonstrated 
a significant reduction in cumulative morphine consumption after thoracic surgery 
(Michelet 2007).  Another prospective, double -blind, randomized study published i n 2012 
demonstrated that low -dose ketamine added to IV -PCA fentanyl after the Nuss procedure 
in pediatric patients reduced pain scores, consumption of fentanyl and incidence of 
nausea and vomiting without increasing side effects (Cha 2012). In this study, a ketamine 
bolus of 0.3 mg/kg was given 10 minutes prior to the end of the operation followed by [CONTACT_446113] 0.15 mg/kg/hr.  A review article published in [ADDRESS_567238] ive in reducing 
morphine requirements after thoracic surgery and in some cases increased patient 
satisfaction (Mathews 2011). A randomized, double -blind control trial from 2008 
concluded that low -dose ketamine after major abdominal surgery improved postope rative 
analgesia with a significant decrease of morphine consumption when its administration 
was continued for 48 hours postoperatively, with a lower incidence of nausea and with no 
side effects of ketamine (Zakine 2008).  
 
There are not yet any studi es ev aluating the efficacy of an intra -operative and post -
operative ketamine infusion for improvement in pain control in patients undergoing 
surgical correction of idiopathic scoliosis. We aim to show an improvement in patient 
pain scores and patient satisfacti on in this specific population by [CONTACT_1583] a small bolus of 
ketamine pre -incision and a low  dose ketamine infusion to the  intra- and post-operative  
pain control regimen.  
 
We will use the visual analog scale (VAS) for scoring postoperative pain.  The VAS has  
been shown to have v alidity and reliability for measuring acute pain (Libman 2000 and 
Bijur 2001).  
 
B. STUDY DESIGN  
Surgical repair of idiopathic scoliosis is performed electively. In our hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], this 
operation is performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Allen Carl, a co -inves tigator on this study. We aim to 
enroll approximately [ADDRESS_567239] about the study and if so, 
they will be contact[CONTACT_446114].  
 
Actual enrollment will be done upon arrival to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_446102] . 
After enrollment, patients will be randomized to e ither the treatment group (to receive

Page 5 of 9 ketamine) or the control group (to receive saline). Randomization will be simple  and will 
be performed by [CONTACT_1714] . Investigators and patients will be blinded to treatment 
group . Based on the patient’s weight in th e pre -operative care unit on the morning of 
surgery, t he pharmacy will mix and provide standardized solution s for bolus and infusion 
in the operating room. Once the weight has been obtained, the anesthesia team will 
contact [CONTACT_446115] (or saline) is ready, it will be delivered to 
the operating room. Surgery will not be delayed for the medication and there is ample 
time during induction of anesthesia for the medication to be prepared.  
 
Patients will be unblinded by [CONTACT_446116] a 
serious, unanticipated side effect for which we need the information to ensure patient 
safety.  
 
We estimate that the average pain score of the control group will be 4 -8.   This is based 
on current average pain sco res in the posterior spi[INVESTIGATOR_446103].  
 
Patients generally stay in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890]) postoperatively for 
approximately 5 -7 days. We don’t anticipate that o ur study will increase or decrease the 
length of stay in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890].  The full time commitment for each subject will not exceed 
the length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  If serious side effects were to occur, the treatment wo uld be 
unblinded and immediate care would be given to address the problem. If necessary, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_446104].  
 
Inclusion criteria are ASA I, II, III patie nts presenting for spi[INVESTIGATOR_446105]. Patients will be English -speaking and able to give assent to the study. Parents 
will need to give consent for minors and the vast majority of these patients are minors. 
Therefore we will obtain con sent from guardians and assent from patients. Exclusion 
criteria include any contraindication to ketamine, previous spi[INVESTIGATOR_61691], opi[INVESTIGATOR_446106] e or chronic pain condition, significant developmental delay  and pregnancy . A 
urine pregnancy test is not a specific component of our data as it is already part of the 
preoperative process and surgery would be canceled in the event of a positive pregnancy 
test. 
 
As mentioned above, t he study will be presented to patients in the preoperative visit by 
[INVESTIGATOR_124]. Carl. Pa tients will then be c ontacted by [CONTACT_446117]. Consent and assent will be obtained in the preoperative care 
unit, in person, prior to initiation of sedation.  
 
The location of the research is Albany Me dical Center, Main Campus and the duration is 
the length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]: 5 -7 days.

Page 6 of 9 Anesthesia induction will be at the discretion of the anesthesia attending. Maintenance of 
anesthesia includes approximately 0.5 MAC of volatile anesthetic and a  remifentanil 
infusion, supplemented by a propofol infusion as necessary. A ketamine bolus of 0.5 
mg/kg or saline bolus will be given and then the ketamine or saline infusion of 0.2 
mg/kg/hr will be initiated prior to incision. Intra -operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_446107].  Postoperative management will include 
continuation of the study drug as well as a standardized morphine patient -controlled 
analgesia (PCA) and acetaminophen 15 mg/kg (up to 1 gram) IV every 6 hours  for 8 
doses which will be initiated in the PACU .  Starting at midnight going into postoperative 
day 1, patients are started on ketorolac 0.5 mg/kg up to 15 mg IV q8h  for 24 hours . At 
that time they are transitioned to ibuprofen 10 mg/kg po (up to 600 mg ) with meals . The 
ketamine or saline infusion will continue for ~ [ADDRESS_567240] operatively at which point 
the PCA is discontinued (typi[INVESTIGATOR_446108]) and patients are transitioned to oral pain 
medications (Roxicet or Lortab and Flexeril) as per the curre nt protocol.  All medications 
listed above with the exception of IV acetaminophen and ketamine are part of the current 
“Spi[INVESTIGATOR_446109]” physician order set.  
 
In the event of side effects from the ketamine  as described in Section E , the anesthesia 
pain service will be contact[CONTACT_446118]. If side 
effects are noted but not bothersome to the patient, then a 10% decrease in the infusion 
rate will be made. If the side effects are concerning to the patient , such as dysphoria or 
hallucinations, then the infusion will be decreased by 50% and an anesthesia attending 
will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. If side effects are severe then the infusion will be discontinued and an 
anesthesia attending will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
 
Pain scores w ill be solicited hourly from patients by [CONTACT_10327]. We will record the 
highest (or worst) pain rating from each [ADDRESS_567241] POPULATION  (WHO, WHAT , WHERE ) 
Patients will b e recruited from [CONTACT_446121]’s clinical practice. Approximately 50 
patients will be enrolled. The population of patients is adolescents and young adults who 
present for repair of idiopathic scoliosis. The majority of these patients are pediatric and 
this is justified for the research as we aim to improve the pain control specifically for this 
group of patients.  
 
D. DATA ANALYSIS  
Please refer to attached data collection sheets for details on data collection. Our primary 
endpoint is patient satisfaction. O ur secondary endpoints are pain scores, opi[INVESTIGATOR_16444] 
(including total morphine consumption) and length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. Identifiers on the 
data collection sheets will include a subject number and a medical record number. These 
data sheets will be kept str ictly confidential and data will be analyzed only by [CONTACT_41163].  
 
Data analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_446119]. Data 
analysis will be performed on campus of the Albany Medical Center and identifying 
A Prospective Randomized Double Blind Controlled Trial Evaluating the Efficacy of Ketamine for Improvement in 
Postopera tive Pain Control After Spi[INVESTIGATOR_446092], MD  Version date: 7/16/[ADDRESS_567242]. (Based on a two -proportion sample size, assuming 70% 
of patients currently report “unsatisfactory” pain control, and assuming a 25% 
improvement in pain scor e, with an alpha of 0.05 and power of 0.8) .  The assumption that 
70% of patients currently report unsatisfactory pain control is an estimate based on the 
fact that we know most patients are significantly uncomfortable after this operative for a 
period of s everal days.  
 
Our primary responsibility is optimal care of our patients throughout the study period. If 
at any time a patient needs to be removed from the study then we will do so. Inadequate 
pain control is unlikely to be a cause for removal from the stu dy but if a patient or family 
is unhappy with care, they can certainly be removed at any time and the data would 
reflect this.  
 
e. RISKS 
The risks of the study include  the risks of adding ketamine to the post -operative 
management. As previously demonstrated,  low-dose infusions of ketamine have been 
shown in the anesthesia literature to be safe with a low incidence of side effects. 
However, patients will be informed that possible side effects of ketamine include 
dysphoria, hallucinations (pleasant or otherwise ), vivid dreams, sialorrhea, and increased 
blood pressure and heart rate. There are not described long term side effects from a low 
dose ketamine infusion administered perioperatively. Side -effects that have been noticed 
in other studies resolve with a dec rease in the infusion rate of the ketamine. We will have 
a step -wise protocol in place to decrease the ketamine (or saline) infusion if side -effects 
are noted. Patients will have access to the Anesthesia Pain Service (APS) [ADDRESS_567243] protected computer file. A

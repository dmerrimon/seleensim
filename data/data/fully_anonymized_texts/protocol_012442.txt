Protocol Date:  06/29/[ADDRESS_190577] drug -placebo differences in  
clinical trials. Results from this study, would be generalizable to all patients with  depression. 
Ultimately, a better understanding of the neurobiology of placebo effects  will advance  
personalized medicine for depression and provide new insights into  novel targets for drug 
development.  
 
Study Objectives  
The study intent is to identify biological mechanisms associated with inter -individual  variations in 
placebo responses in patients with Major Depressive Disorders (MDD)  as a model syndrome 
with high placebo responses. It is hypothesized that the  identification neural responses during 
an fMRI placebo experiment will  predict sustained responses to placebo in an 8 -week double -
blinded randomized controlled  trial (RTC) of escitalopram and allow the investigation of the 
effect  of antidepressant treatment on placebo related neural networks.  
 
AIM 1: We will first define the neural correlates of placebo response  in MDD. We 
hypothesize  that simulated neurofeedback will be associated with acute mood  
improvement and increased Blood -oxygen level dependent (BOLD)  responses . 
AIM 2: We will determine the  extent to which mood and neural  responses to  simulated 
positive neurofeedback at baseline will predict placebo  responses in an RCT.  
AIM 3: We will a ssess whether antidepressant treatment enhances placebo -related 
neural  networks in an RCT.  
 
Study Design  & Methods  
This study is a single site double -blinded 8 -week placebo control RTC randomized controlled 
trial of 20mg of escitalopram or placebo that incorporates neuroimaging measures before and 
after the RTC. During the fMRI scanning session participants undergo the “Simulated Real - 
Time Neurofeedback” fMRI task , previously described  (1, 2). In summary,  the Simulated Real -
time Neurofeedback fMRI Task  features two components of the placebo effect: expectancies 
and their reinforcement, each followed by [CONTACT_164244], respectively. The 
expectancy condition involves an “antidepressant infusion” cue and a “no -infusion” cue, 
described as periods of equipment “calibration”. During the “antidepressant infusion” cues (4s), 
Page 3 of 4 
 a bar is filled at four 1s -periods representing 0%, 33%, 66%, and 100% of the dose 
administered. During the “calibration no -infusion” cue (4s) the bar remains empty. For the 
reinforcement condition (10s), sham neurofeedback acts as a secondary reinforcer of the 
“antidepressant” effects. In the high -reinforcement condition, sham neurofeedback is positive 
75% of the trials (vs. 25% baseline). Participants rate their expected and actual change in mood 
(YES/NO) in response to each infusion/neurofeedback signal, respectively, by [CONTACT_2329] a keypad 
and their index fingers. Inter -stimulus interval duration was randomly sampled from an 
exponential distribution bounded between 0.[ADDRESS_190578] and reduces OFC encoding of

Eligibility Criteria  
List the inclusion criteria:

study and sign the written informed consent since the research instruments used in this study 
are not available in other languages;

phobia); HDRS -17 score of ≥ 16 at Screening Visit. Patients with MDD in the context of a 
chronic major depression will also be allowed. Other forms of chronic depression in the absence 
of MDD will not be allowed;  
• No more than one failed antidepressant trial of adequate dose and duration of the current 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], as defined by [CONTACT_164245][INVESTIGATOR_164239] (MGH -ATRQ);  
• Participants will need to be antidepressant medication -free for at least 21 days prior to 
collection of imaging data (five weeks for fluoxetine). However, individuals currently taking 
antidepressants will not be eligible to enroll in the study, even if they are willing to stop their 
medications.

Statistical Considerations  
Image acquisition and data processing.  Functional MR images are acquired at MR center at 
the Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_52123] a 3 Tesla scanner (Philips Achieva, Best, Netherlands) using a 
single -shot echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence (TR=2000, TE=35ms, FA=90, FOV =20cm, 64 
x 64 matrix). The “Simulated Real -Time Neurofeedback fMRI Task” described above has been 
programmed using PsychToolbox -3 software (13) and can be presented to subjects via a 
displa y placed behind the gantry. In each of the 6 runs of the task, 228 functional images will be 
acquired. Two sets of anatomical MR images will be acquired on the same scanner, including a 
high resolution anatomical scan for anatomical standardization to the Montreal Neurological 
Institute (MNI) template and a lower resolution scan acquired in the same locations as the 
functional scans to improve standardization. All newly collected fMRI data is analyzed using 
standard procedures (14).  
Imaging data statistica l analysis.  Subject -level analysis. Each participant’s effects is analyzed 
using general linear model. The regressors included in the model will be anticipation of 
infusion/no -infusion (6s), and neurofeedback (16s). Additionally, first order parametric 
regressors will be constructed for the neurofeedback regressor, modelling the effect of 
expectancy ( drug infusion vs. calibration ) and reinforcement (positive vs. baseline 
neurofeedback) , where each will be weighted [ADDRESS_190581] (e.g. , expectancy ) resulting in statistical parametric  maps (t 
or F statistics). The resulting voxel -wise parametric maps are thresholded with height and extent 
values generated by [CONTACT_164246] 3dClustSim to protect against overall type I 
error at p < 0.05. To  control for potential confounders , sex and depression severity will be 
entered as  covariates in statistical models.  
Mood ratings during the fMRI task data statistical analysis.  Linear regression analyses will 
examine the  relationship between changes in mood improvement and neural  respons es during 
the simulated real -time neurofeedback fMRI ta sk and changes in the MADRS scores from 
baseline treatment with placebo or escitalopram for [ADDRESS_190582] will be  modele d using an interaction between 
placebo responsiveness and time (week).  The main effect will be interpreted as the effect of the 
predictor on MADRS scores at  the beginning of the RCT, and the interaction term will be 
interpreted as the degree  to which the t rajectory of MADRS score over the 8 -week trial varies by 
[CONTACT_164247].

heart’s left atrial appendage, performed under direct visualization and in 
conjunction with other cardiac surgical procedures.  
Clinical 
Investigation 
Name [CONTACT_783804]-M arket  Study  
CP-2021 -03 
Title Long -Term Follow -Up on LAA Exclusion using AtriClip  
Objective(s)  The objective of this trial is to evaluate the long -term performance  and safety  of 
the AtriClip FLEX -V and PRO•V LAA Exclusion devices for exclusion of the left 
atrial appendage . 
Device(s) Under 
Investigation  AtriCure AtriClip LAA Exclusion  system comprised of:  
• Flex-V (ACHV) and PRO•V  
Rationale  The study  proposed herein is to gather clinical data on the long-term 
performance  and safety  of the AtriClip FLEX -V and PRO •V LAA Exclusion 
devices .  
Data from  this study  may be used for submission to regulatory authorities in  the 
US, Europe, China and other geographies as needed, as well as  for publication  
purposes . 
Number of 
Subjects/Sites  Up to [ADDRESS_1077871] s will be enrolled at up to 20 sites in the U S, [LOCATION_006] and/or EU . 
Clinical 
Investigation 
Design  Retrospective -prospective, multi -center, non -randomized, unblinded, post -
market study  to evaluate the long-term performance  and safety  of AtriClip 
FLEX -V LAA and PRO •V LAA Exclusion devices for exclusion of the left atrial 
appendage of the heart during cardiac procedures.  
Subject 
Population  Subjects who have undergone  designated non -emergent, cardiac surgical 
procedure(s), received  an AtriClip implant (with devices under investigation)  
and who are willing to return for follow -up chest  imaging to ascertain  Left Atrial 
Appendage  (LAA) exclusion  will be eligible to partic ipate based upon the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
Subjects who had received chest imaging for other reasons, and if the imaging 
includes pertinent information to verify LAA exclusion , will also be eligible to 
participate if they meet e ligibility  criteria.

Justification of 
Sample Size and 
Performance Goal  A minimum sample size of 170 subjects is required to evaluate the primary 
performance  of LAA exclusion at 12 -months  using the following  assumptions : 
Test basis: exact test for one proportion  
1-sided alpha: 0.025  
Power: 92% 
Performance Goal: 8 0% 
Expected closure rate: 9 0% 
Expected attrition rate: 16% 
Based on the se assumptions, a minimum of 143 subjects are required before 
accounting for attrition. To account for an estimated attriti on of 16% for subjects 
that consent but miss the imaging during follow -up, a total of 170 subjects will 
need to be enrolled.  
Performance goal:  
The 12 -month LAA closure ra te (No leak) for contemporary devices ranges from 
66 % - 89.5%. In -line with th ese rates, a PG of 80% is proposed  for this study.  
 
In addition, base d on a performance goal of 10.5%  for safety  at [ADDRESS_1077872]  
AtriClip implantation , expected SAE rate of up to 5%, the sample size provides 
85.4% power to demonstrate primary safety success.  
Inclusion Criteria  1. Subject is greater than or equal to [ADDRESS_1077873] who received  the AtriClip FLEX -V or PRO•V implant during a non -
emergent cardiac surgical procedure  
3. Subject is willing and able to provide written informed consent  
4. Subject is willing and able to return for scheduled follow -up visit  and 
imaging  (CTA  or TEE ) 
Exclusion Criteria  1. Inability, unwillingness , or contraindication to undergo TEE or CTA imaging  
2. Subjects who are p regnant  or breast feeding   
3. Subjects with active  COVID -[ADDRESS_1077874] -procedure  (i.e., the last follow -up visit ). 
Primary 
Endpoint(s)  Primary Performance Endpoint  
1. Left Atrial Appendage  exclusion defined as absence of residual 
comm unication  (no leaks ) between the left atrium  (LA) and the LAA as 
assessed by [CONTACT_783775] -up visit . The images will 
be reviewed by [CONTACT_783776] a standardized imaging 
protocol.

1 INTRODUCTION  
This clinical investigation will be conducted in accordance with this C linical Investigational Plan 
(CIP), also referred to herein as the “Protocol”. All investigators involved in the conduct of the 
clinical investigation will be qualified by [CONTACT_8640], training, or experience to perform their tasks 
and th e training will be documented  appropriately.  The investigator will create and maintain 
source documents throughout the clinical investigation and make them available as requested 
during monitoring visits or audits, as well as maintain documentation of the type and location of 
these source documents.  The investigator will also determine the cause and implement 
appropriate corrective and preventative actions to address any significant noncompliance  that 
arise during the conduct of the study/trial . 
 
1.1 Background and Rationale  
 
1.1.1  Background  
Exclusion or excision of the left atrial appendage (LAA) has been performed since the late 
1940s. Left atrial appendage suture -enabled exclusion/excision is intended to prevent thrombi 
that are developed in the heavily trabeculated LAA from migrating outside of the LAA. In 
patients with AF >90% of thrombi are generated in LAA. These thrombi can dislodge from left 
atrium and migrate to other parts of the body and can cause ischemic events hence it is 
important to close or exclude LAA to avoid thrombus from e scapi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
Various surgical techniques include :  epi[INVESTIGATOR_783761] (ligation), endocardial suture 
occlusion, stapling, and surgical excision. These techniques are associated with incomplete 
LAA closure rates of 40% to 60% and the technique can be difficult, adding significant cross 
clamp time.1-6 
Results of the randomized control pi[INVESTIGATOR_783762] (LAAOS) were 
reported by [CONTACT_783780].7 The LAAOS study assessed the safety and efficacy of LAA exclusion 
performed at the time of coronary artery by[CONTACT_15806] (CABG) using sutures or a stapling 
device.   It   was   shown   that   among   patients having    a   postoperative   transesophageal 
echocardiogram (TEE), complete exclusion of the LAA was achieved in 45% of cases using 
sutures and in 72% using a stapler.  Given the low rate of exclusion with these techniques there 
is a need to exclude LAA using the device that provides an improved rate of closure.  
1.1.2  Rationale for Conducting this Clinical Investigation  
This study is proposed  herein is to gather clinical data on the long -term performance  and safety  
of the AtriClip FLEX -V and PRO•V LAA Exclusion devices .  
Data from this study may be used for submission to regulatory authorities in the US, Europe, 
China and other geographies as needed, as well as  for publication  purpo ses.

2 CLINICAL INVESTIGATION OVERVIEW  
2.1 Clinical Investigation Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the  long-term performance  and safety  of 
the AtriClip  FLEX -V and AtriClip PRO •V devices to successfully exclude the LAA with absence 
of residual communication between the  LA and the LAA at the last follow -up visit  post AtriClip 
implant.  
2.2 Investigational Device(s) To Be Used in the Clinical Investigation  
The subject device for this study will be the AtriCure AtriClip LAA Exclusion system , which has 
been cleared under the 510 (k) process by [CONTACT_783781].  It is therefore not an investigational device.  
 
The AtriCure AtriClip LAA Exclusion  system  is comprised of:  
• Flex-V (ACHV) and PRO•V  
2.2.1  Name [CONTACT_26157](s) Under Investigation  
Please refer to the IFU for additional information regarding the device used in this clinical 
investigation.  
2.2.2  Indication for Use  
The AtriCure AtriClip LAA Exclusion  system  is indicated for the exclusion of the heart’s left atrial 
appendage  (LAA) , performed under direct visualization and in conjunction with other cardiac 
surgical procedures . 
 
Direct visualization in this context, requires that the surgeon was able to see the heart directly, 
with or without  assistance from a camera, endoscope, etc., or any other appropriate viewing 
technology.

5.2.2  Informed Consent  
The Informed Consent Form (ICF) must have the approval of the IRB or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_179163]. While some institutions may request modification of the ICF to satisfy specific institutional 
requirements, the use of a modified or unique ICF is permitted if it meets the requirement of 21 
CFR Part 50 and ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2020 and is approved by [CONTACT_1034].  
The Investigator or his/her authorized designee will conduct the Informed Consent process, as 
required by [CONTACT_26137]’s IRB/EC. This process will include a verbal 
discussion with the subject on all aspects of the clinical investigation that are relevant to the 
subject’s decision to participate, such as details of clinical investigation procedures, anticipated 
benefits, and potential risks of clinical investigation participation. Subjects must be informed 
about their right to withdraw from the clinical investigation at any time and for any reason 
without sanction, penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled. 
Withdrawal from the clinical investigation will not jeopardize their future medical care or 
relationship with the inve stigator.  
 
During the discussion, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her authorized designee will avoid any 
improper influence on the subject and will respect subject’s legal rights. Financial incentives will 
not be given to the subject. Subjects may be compensated for time and travel directly related to 
the participation in the clinical investigation. The subject shall be provided with the Informed 
Consent form written in a language that is understandable to the subject and has been 
approved by [CONTACT_16018]’s IRB/EC. The subject shall have adequate time to review, ask 
questions, and consider participation. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her authorized designee 
will make efforts to ensure that the subject understands the information provided. If the subject  
agrees to participate, the Informed Consent form must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_179207] -specific 
procedures. The signed original will be filed in the subject’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26107], and a 
copy will be provided to the subject.  
 
Failure to obtain Informed Consent from a subject prior to clinical investigation enrollment 
should be reported to Sponsor within 5 working days and to the reviewing center’s IRB/EC 
accordi ng to the IRB’s/ EC’s reporting requirements.  
 
If, during the clinical investigation, new information becomes available that can significantly 
affect a subject's future health and medical care, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her authorized 
designee (if applicable) will provide this information to the subject. If relevant, the subject will be 
asked to confirm their continuing Informed Consent in writing.

• Subject lost -to follow -up as described below  
• Subject’s follow -up is terminated due to site/study termination  
 
The Sponsor must be notified by [CONTACT_179209](s) for subject discontinuation and record 
a reason for termination in the case report form (CRF). Investigators must also report this to their 
respective IRB/EC as defined by [CONTACT_1385]’s proced ure(s).  
 
Investigator Decision  
If the subject experiences an adverse event and the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_179165], they will be withdrawn 
from the study.  
 
Lost to follow -up 
If the subject misses their scheduled follow -up and the attempts at contact[CONTACT_26140], then the subject is considered lost -to-follow -up. Site personnel shall 
make all reasonable efforts to locate and communicate with the subject (and document these 
efforts in the source documents), including the following, at each contact [CONTACT_7206]:  
• A minimum of two telephone calls on different days and times  should be recorded in the 
source documentation, including date, time and initials of site personnel trying to make 
contact.  
• If these attempts are unsuccessful, a letter (certified if applicable) should be sent to the 
subject.  
 
Withdrawal of consent  
The subject withdraws consent for participation in the study.  Any method of contact [CONTACT_783786].  When possible , the reason for withdrawal will be documented.  
 
Death:  Subject expi[INVESTIGATOR_179166].  
 
Site Termination or Study Termination  
A site or the study may be terminated. When this occurs all subjects at the site will be withdrawn 
and documented as early termination. Reasons for site or study termination may include, but are 
not limited to the following:  
• Administrative concerns (e.g., inadequate subject enrollment, Investigator/institution non -
compliance, change of business strategy, etc.);   
• Safety issues, including those due to non-compliance, which substantially affect the risk 
to benefit ratio of the study subjects at a site or for the study as a whole;  
• Regulatory body mandate(s).  
 
Other (which may include)  
• Protocol deviation, noncompliance, or violation;  
• Investigator/Sponsor r ecommendation;

6.4 Requirement for Clinical Laboratories  
An independent Core Laboratory will be utilized for assessment LAA exclusion defined by [CONTACT_783788]  (no leaks) and residual pocket (≤10 mm ) ) between the LA 
and LAA.  Imaging for subjects include :  
• CTA or TEE imaging at last follow -up visit ( 12-months or greater  post-procedure  visit) 
 
All closure imaging  submitted  should  be performed in accordance with the Core Laboratory’s 
recommended protocol.  
7 ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Definition  
7.1.1  Adverse Event  
Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any undesirable clinical occurrence or change from subject’s 
baseline (or pre -device procedure) condition, whether it is considered device related or not. An 
AE is also defined by [CONTACT_179213]  (ISO) as an untoward 
medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal 
laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other persons, whether or not related to the 
investigational medical device and whether anticipated or unanticipated.  
Adverse Event Identification: a condition that is one of the following:  
1. A unique symptom or event that is a change from the subject’s baseline status.  
2. A series of symptoms or events that can be categorized as a single entity based o n 
definitions found herein.  
3. A specific diagnosis responsible for a clinical change.  
4. A worsening or exacerbation of a pre -existing condition.  
7.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
If the AE meets any of the criteria below, it is regarded as a SAE.  
a) Led to a death,  
b) Led to a serious deterioration in health of the subject, that either resulted in  
1. Life-threatening illness or injury, or  
2. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (initial or prolonged) or  
3. Disabili ty or permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function  
4. Congenital anomaly (physical or mental)/birth defect/fetal distress/fetal death  
5. Chronic disease  
6. Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function  
c) Other Serious (important Medical Events).  
 
Events qualifying as SAEs as defined in section 4.1 include:  
• Death  
• Major bleeding (BARC 3 and above)  
• Surgical site infection

• Pericardial effusion requiring intervention  
• Clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction  
 
Any condition that was record ed as pre -existing is not a SAE unless there is a change in the 
nature, severity, or degree of the condition.  
 
Note:  A planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5912] -existing condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_760], 
without a serious deterioration in health, is not considered to be an SA E. 
Note: “Death” should not be reported as an adverse event.  The cause of death should be reported 
as an adverse event.  The only exception is “Sudden Death” when the cause is unknown.  
7.1.3  Device Deficiency/Device Malfunction  
Device Deficiency is defined as an inadequacy of a medical device related to its identity, quality, 
usability, durability, reliability, safety or performance, such as malfunction, misuse or use erro r 
and inadequate labeling. This includes the failure of the device to meet its performance 
specifications or otherwise perform as intended. Note: Performance specifications include all 
claims made in the labeling of the device.  
 
A device malfunction is the failure of a device to meet its performance specifications or other wise 
perform as intende d. 
 
All device deficiencies of the AtriClip LAA exclusion  device shall be documented throughout the 
clinical investigation and managed by [CONTACT_783789] a non -conforming product. The sponsor shall take,  where applicable, appropriate 
corrective and preventative actions to protect the safety of subjects, users, and other persons. 
Device deficiencies of the comparator, if applicable, shall be documented. Where applicable, the 
analysis of used or explanted investigational devices shall be included as supportive information.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1077904]’s medical history. It must be reported as a 
new AE if the intensity, frequency, or the character of the condition worsens during the study 
treatment and  the AE was determined to have the relationship to the study procedures and/or 
study devices.  
To avoid confusing pre -existing conditions with AEs during data analysis, the study sites must 
make all attempts to provide start dates for all baseline medical conditions. Any pre -existing 
condition that now meets the stated criteria as an AE should be recorded on the AE CRF as an 
exacerbation of the pre -existing condition and the start date will be recorded as the time when the 
exacerbation occurred.  
7.3 Severity of Adverse Events  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to assess the severity of an AE.  A change in severity may 
constitute a new reportable AE.

The following guideline should be used to determine the severity of each adverse event:  
• MILD:   Awareness of experience, but easily tolerated. No medical intervention required  
• MODERATE:  Enough discomfort to interfere with usual activities. Medical intervention 
required  
• SEVERE:  Inability to carry out usual activities. Medical /surgical  intervention (including 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]) required.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1077905] or device 
under investigation caused or contributed to an AE is to be determined by [CONTACT_179215]. Determination should be based on assessment of 
temporal relationships, evidence of alternative etiology, medical/biologic plausibility, and subject 
condition (pre -existing condition).  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to assess the relationship of an AE to the study procedure 
and/or device.  
Adverse events will be assigned an attribution according to the Investigator’s believed primary 
cause.   Events will be categorized by [CONTACT_179216](s) listed in this 
protocol or ancillary device, surgical ablation procedure, general cardiac surgical procedure or 
subsequent intervention, concomitant medications, pre -existing condition, intercurrent condition, 
intercurrent intervention, or unknown.   
The following guidelines should be used in determining the relationship of an adverse event to 
the study device or procedure:  
• Unknown: A clinical event (including abnormal laboratory result) that cannot be 
determined to be related or unrelated to device/procedure/drug given information 
provided.  
• Device Related Adverse Event :  An adverse event, that in the judgment of the 
Investigator, result ed from use  or placement  of the AtriCure AtriClip LAA Exclusion S ystem  
and may have caused or contributed to the AE . 
• Procedure Related Adverse Event :  An adverse event which, in the judgment of the 
Investigator, results as a consequence of the procedure (surgical procedure or general 
cardiac surgical procedure, subsequent intervention) and is not specifically related to the 
use of the AtriCure AtriCli p LAA Exclusion S ystem . 
• General Surgery Related Adverse Event : An adverse event which, in the judgement of 
the Investigator, results as a consequence of general cardiac surgical procedural 
complications and/or subsequent interventions.  
• Concomitant Medicati on-Related Adverse Event :  An adverse event is considered to 
be concomitant medication related when, in the judgment of the Investigator, it is 
reasonable to believe that the event is associated with concomitant medications used in 
conjunction with the AtriClip device and is not otherwise specific to the AtriClip  device (e.g. 
bleeding associated with anticoagulation medication).  
• Intercurrent Condition : It is reasonable to believe that the event is directly associated 
with an intercurrent condition/co -morbidity.

• Intercurrent Intervention : It is reasonable to believe that the event is directly associated 
with an intercurrent intervention which was performed for reasons other than to address a 
device or general cardiac surgical procedure related complication.  
7.4.1  Unanticipated (Serious Adverse) Device Effect [U(S)ADE]  
Unanticipated serious adverse device effect ([LOCATION_003]DE) refers to any serious adverse effect on 
health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a 
device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or 
degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to 
the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
7.5 Adverse Event and Device Deficiency/Device Malfunction Reporting  
7.5.1  AE/ADE/UADE  Reporting  
General AE Reporting  
Safety surveillance and reporting starts as soon as the subject  is enrolled in the clinical 
investigation. Safety surveillance and reporting will continue until the [ADDRESS_1077906] withdraws from the clinical investigation. Except for those ev ents 
listed in Section 7.6  all adverse event data  potentially related to device or implant procedure, 
including deaths and device deficiency data,  thromboembolic events, or events related  to the  12-
month TEE/CTA will be collected throughout the time period defined above and will be reported 
to the Sponsor on the eCRF. Additional information with regard to an adverse event should be 
updated within the appropriate CRF.  
 
Standard medical terminology should be used when recording AEs.  
In addition, the following information should be recorded:  
• Onset Date  
• Resolution date or date of death  
• Intensity of the event  
• Action Taken  
• Outcome of the event  
• Relationship of AE  
• Indication of whether the event is serious  
 
7.5.2  SAE/[LOCATION_003]DE Reporting  
The investigator (or designee) must report all SAE/[LOCATION_003]DEs to the Sponsor via the Adverse Event 
CRF as soon as possible but no later than outlined below.  
 
 
Protocol Number: CP-2021-03   Page 28 of 62

Version: Rev B; Oct 15, [ADDRESS_1077907] be reported to the Sponsor no later than 10 calendar days from 
the day the site personnel became aware of the event or as per the 
investigative site’s local requirements, if the requirement is more stringent 
than those outlined.  
 
An event determined by [CONTACT_783790]-threatening or to have 
led to death must be reported within [ADDRESS_1077908] be recorded in 
the eCRF and ensure relevant source documents are collected.  The Investigator will further 
report the SAE to the local IRB/EC according to the institution’s IRB/EC reporting requirements.  
In the event of system outages or technical difficulties, serious and any unanticipated adverse 
events may be submitted via e -mail to [EMAIL_3531] .  Upon availability of the system 
or resolution of the technical difficulties, the event will be recorded in the Adverse Event eCRF.  
The Investigator (or designee) shall send a written report including a narrative description of the 
serious and/or unanticipated adverse event to AtriCure or their designee within three (3) working 
days of the initial report.   The Investigator should follow all unresolved serious adverse events 
until the events are resolved, or the subject has exited the study, or the adverse event is otherwise 
explained.  
AtriCure, Inc., or their designee, in cooperation with the Investigator, will assess all serious  
adverse events considered device -related for potential report -ability to the FDA as an 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) in accordance with 21 CFR Part 812.46(b).  
If a UADE determination is made, the Investigator and Sponsor will comply with UADE reporting 
requirements per 21 CFR Part 812.150.  The Sponsor shall report the results of such evaluation 
to FDA and to all reviewing IRBs/ECs and participating Investigators within thirty (30) wor king 
days after the Sponsor first receives notice of the UADE.  Thereafter the Sponsor shall submit 
such additional reports concerning the effect as FDA requests.  Similarly, the Investigator shall 
submit to their reviewing IRB a report of any UADE as soon as possible, but in no event later than 
ten (10) working days, (or per local IRB requirements) after the Investigator first learns of the 
effect.  The Investigator (or designee) shall  provide documentation of the UADE report/notification 
sent to their IRB to AtriCure (or designee).  
Note: It is also the responsibility of the Investigator to inform their IRB of other SAEs (i.e. non -
UADEs) as required by [CONTACT_11577]/EC procedures and in conformance with FDA requirements.

• Atelectasis - collapse of lung tissue affecting part or all of one lung; the alveoli are 
deflated. This is not considered to be an AE unless treatment other than chest PT is 
required or it prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• Hyperglycemia - The use of insulin in the post -operative period does not constitute 
hyperglycemia if during the same hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. An elevated blood sugar of less than 
250 mg/dl during the first [ADDRESS_1077909] -operative does not constitute hyperglycemia.  
• Pleural effusion is not an event unless treatment with thoracentesis or chest tube 
insertion is required  
• Pericardial effusion without hemodynamic compromise or treatment  
• Atrial Fibrillation /Atrial Flutter/Atrial Tachycardia with or without cardioversion.   
• Junctional Rhythm requiring temporary pacing  
Note:  Treated subjects will  have  received general anesthesia and therefore will also be 
subject to general anesthesia -associated complications and morbidity. These are also not 
considered reportable (recorded  on eCRF) adverse events.  
Note: This listing of events is intended to provide guidance to the Investigator and 
investigational site for the purpose of adverse event reporting. The Investigator should utilize 
his/her own clinical judgment in evaluating adverse experiences and may decide that the 
above events should be reported as adverse events  based on the IRB/EC reporting 
requirements or the subject clinical situation .

8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
The following section describes the statistical methods for the clinical investigation. A dditional 
details on statistical analyses, including justification of clinical investigation design, sensitivit y 
analyses, pool -ability analyses, subgroup analyses etc., may be maintained in a separate 
Statistical Analysis Plan.  
 
8.1 Analysis Populations  
Intention -to-Treat Population:  
The Intention -to-Treat (ITT) population consists of the subjects with AtriClip implant . This is the 
primary population for performance endpoint s. 
Protocol Population:  
The Per -Protocol (PP) study population is defined by [CONTACT_179220], that is, those that could potentially bias the results. This population is defined 
for the primary performance endpoints.  
8.2 Statistical Analyse s  
The primary goal of the study is to demonstrate safety and performance of the Flex-V and 
PRO•V device. For the study to be successful, the safety and performance endpoints must be 
statistically significant relative to their respective performance goals.  
 
Standard descriptive statistics will be used to summarize numeric variables, including the number 
of observed values, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values.

Version: Rev B; Oct 15, [ADDRESS_1077917] descriptive 
statistics.  
Two-sided 95% and 90% confidence intervals will be provided for point estimates as appropriate.  
8.2.1  Primary Performance Endpoint Analys is 
The primary performance endpoint is further defined in section 4.1 of the protocol.  
Subjects meeting the primary performance  endpoint (success LAA exclusion at least [ADDRESS_1077918] AtriClip implant) will be labeled as “responders”, and the proportion of responders will be 
compared to a performance goal (PG) of 80%.  
An exact binomial t est will be conducted at a one -sided α  = 0.[ADDRESS_1077919] the 
following hypothesis that the proportion of performance  successes is significantly higher than the 
PG: 
H0: p ≤ 80% 
HA: p > 80% 
where p is the responder rate at last follow -up visit occurring at least 12-months post -procedure.  
The ITT population will be the primary population for this analysis.  
8.2.[ADDRESS_1077920] a PG of 1 0.5%. 
An exact binomial t est will be conducted at a one -sided α  = 0.[ADDRESS_1077921] the 
following hypothesis that the proportion of MAEs is significantly lower than the P G: 
The hypothesis test for the safety endpoint is:  
H0: q ≥ 10.5%  
HA: q < 10.5%  
where q is the proportion of subjects  with MAEs through 30 -days AtriClip implantation  in the safety 
population. The ITT population will be the primary population for this analysis.  
8.2.3  Secondary  Endpoint Analyses  
The secondary endpoints are described in section 4. 3 of the protocol.  
All analyses will be conducted using appropriate statistical  methods as described in Section 8.2 
and for the primary performance endpoint, as applicable.  These will include analyses of the 
populations and subgroups as specified in this protocol and may also include additional endpoints, 
populations and/or subgroups.

8.2.4  Long -Term Safety  Analyses  
Serious events related to the index procedure (such as LAA tears, tissue injury or bleeding whi ch 
requires intervention) will be reported. Descriptive statistics will be provided. No formal hypothesis 
testing will be do ne. 
8.3 Sample Size Calculation and Assumptions  
Performance Endpoint  
The 12 -month LAA closure rate (No leak) for contemporary devices ranges from 66 % - 89.5%.  
(Kar, 2021)  In-line with these rates, a PG of 80% is proposed for this study.  
 
Based on the performance goal of 80% success  and an expected success rate of 90%, a sample 
size of [ADDRESS_1077922] s provides 92% power using  a one -sided  Exact test, with  α = 0.025  level of 
significance  to demonstrate primary performance  success.  Assuming an attrition rate  of 16 % at 
the last follow -up visit post procedure , a total of [ADDRESS_1077923] primary performance endpoint that would me et the PG is 86.7% (that is, 124 out of 
143 subjects are responders ). 
 
Safety Endpoint  
Minimal to no missing data are expected for the primary safety . Based on a PG of 10.5%, and an 
expected population MAE  rate of up to 5%, a sample size of [ADDRESS_1077924] 85.4% power 
using  a one -sided  Exact test, with at a one -sided α = 0.[ADDRESS_1077925] primary safety endpoint that would me et the PG would be 6.5% (that is, [ADDRESS_1077926] one MAE ). 
 
Watc hman FLX device is CE approved and improved safety when compared to previous iterations 
of this device (1)  reported a  safety rate of 5% (20/400) [95% one -sided upper confidence limit of 
7%] reported within similar timeframe (45 days) after the device implant. The safety performance 
goal of 10.5% is based on 1.5  times the UCL of 7% .

APPENDIX III: DEFINITIONS  
 
BLOOD AND LYMPHATIC SYSTEM DISORDERS  
 
Severe  anemia : Hematocrit below 25%.  Generally , an accepted value to consider the need for 
transfusion of red blood cells.  This is not in the setting of acute persistent bleeding . 
 
Coagulopathy : Bleeding in the presence with abnormal clotting studies.  
 
Hemodilutional Anemia : Anemia associated with fluid volume overload as a result of 
cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476].  
 
HIT (Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia): Low blood platelet count as a result of the 
medication heparin. Must have lab evidence of HIT +.  
 
Leukopenia: Leukopenia is defined as leukocyte count of < 3.5 x109/liter for more than 3 days.  
 
Neutropenia: Neutropenia is defined as ANC <1000 per mm3 for more than 3 days.  
 
Thrombocytopenia: A persistent decrease in the number of blood platelets. This is not 
considered to be an AE until treat ed. 
 
CARDIAC DISORDERS   
Arrhythmias  
Bradycardia : Abnormally low heart rate (<60 bpm) requiring treatment (implantation of a 
temporary or permanent pacemaker, or medication).  
 
SVT: Tachycardia in which QRS is narrow and P waves are present and associated. In certain

conduction through the AV node. This may take the form of progressive prolongation of 
the P -R interval until there is a non -conducted beat with no QRS (Mobitz I or Wenckebach) 
or intermittent non -conducted P waves without preceding prolongation of the P -R interval 
or subsequent shortening of the interval (Mobitz II). This excludes block due to prem ature 
atrial beats  
• 3rd degree: Third -degree AV block (complete heart block) exists when more P waves than 
the QRS complexes exist and no relationship exists between them (no conduction).  
 
Angina : A tight or heavy feeling in the chest, discomfort which spreads from the chest to the arm, 
back, neck, jaw, or stomach, numbness or tingling in the shoulders, arms or wrists, shortness of  
breath, and nausea.  
 
Atrial thrombus: Thrombus formation or detection within the atrium.  
 
Cardiac Arrest: Absent or inadequate contraction of the left ventricle of the heart that immediately 
causes body wide circulatory failure.  
 
Cardiac Tamponade: See Cardiac Tamponade/Perforation definition.  
 
Cardiac Tamponade /Perforation : Cardiac tamponade /perforation  is defined as a complication 
of AF ablation if the development of a significant pericardial effusion occurs during or within 30 
days of undergoing an AF Ablation procedure. A significant pericardial effusion is one which 
results in hemodynamic compromise , requires elective or urgent pericardiocentesis, or results in 
a pericardial effusion of 1 cm or more (by [CONTACT_51541]). Cardiac tamponade/perforation 
should be classified as “early” or “late” depending on whether it is diagnosed during or following 
initial discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 
Cardiogenic Shock : Subject exhibits cardiogenic shock (systolic pressure < 80mm Hg and 
PCWP > 20mm Hg or cardiac index <1.8 liters/minute/m2 or intra -aortic balloon pump or 
intravenous inotropes are needed to maintain a systolic pressure>80 mm Hg) for any time within 
24 hours prior to index procedure . 
 
Congestive Heart Failure: Documentation of one of the following:  
• Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND)  
• Dyspnea on exertion (DOE) due to heart failure  
• Elevated PCW with associated SOB or x -ray consistent with congestion.  
• May be related to fluid overload in the presence of underlying cardiovascular disease.   
 
Heart Failure: A clinical syndrome resulting from a cardiac disease which comprises ventricular  
systolic or diastolic function or both. Heart failure results when the heart is unable to generate a 
cardiac output sufficient to meet the demands of the body without unduly increasing diastolic 
pressure. Heart failure may be manifested by [CONTACT_179231] (i.e., 
fatigue, poor exercise tolerance, confusion) or by [CONTACT_783799]: CP-2021-03   Page 49 of 62

congestion of vascular beds (e.g., dyspnea, chest rales, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, 
distended neck veins, congested liver, peripheral edema). We will not distinguish between 
congestive and chronic heart failure for purposes of this protocol.  
 
Myocardial Infarction in the context of surgical AF Abl ation : The presence of any one of the 
following criteria:  
1. Detection of ECG changes indicative of new ischemia (new ST -T changes), which may 
persist for more than one hour;  
2. Development of new pathological Q waves on an ECG;   
3. Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall abnormality.  
 
Myocardial Perforation : See Cardiac Tamponade/Perforation definition.  
 
Pericardial effusion : Fluid detected in the pericardial space by [CONTACT_179233] 
(e.g., echocardiography).  
 
Pericarditis : Irritation or inflammation of the pericardium associated with pain on inspi[INVESTIGATOR_179175]. Clinical signs may include shallow respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], pericardial fricti on rub and 
ECG changes (ST elevation across the precordial leads).  
 
Sick sinus syndrome : also called sinus node dysfunction, is a group of abnormal heart rhythms 
(arrhythmia) presumably caused by a malfunction of the sinus node, the heart's primary 
pacemaker.  
 
Unstable Angina : Angina which increases in frequency, intensity, or duration, which occurs at 
rest, or which is new in onset. Unstable angina is a syndrome that is intermediate between stable 
angina and myocardial infarction: it is characterized by [CONTACT_137914] "crescendo" pattern of 
chest pain that lasts longer than instable angina, occurs at rest or with less exertion than instable 
angina, or is less responsive to medication.  Unstable angina and myocardial infarction are  
considered acute coronary syndromes.  
 
GASTROINTESTINAL/GENITOURINARY DEFINITIONS  
 
Atrioesophageal Fistula : A connection between the atrium and the lumen of the esophagus. 
Evidence supporting this diagnosis includes documentation of esophageal erosion combined with 
evidence  of a fistulous connection to the atrium such as an air embolus, an embolic event, or 
direct observation at the time of surgical repair.  A CT scan or MRI scan are the most common 
methods of documentation of an atrial esophageal fistula.  Esophagoscopy should NOT be 
performed as it may result in air insufflation into the left Atrium.  
 
Aortoesophageal Fistula : Abnormal passage from aorta communicating with the esophagus (for 
the purposes of the protocol - likely resulting from an esophageal perforation or bu rn). 
Presentation of aortoesophageal fistula may include hematemesis (possibly massive). Diagnosis

possible outcome of aortoesophageal fistula is sepsis, which may be diagnosed with blood 
cultures.  
 
Esophageal Dyskinesia : diffuse spasms of the esophagus which may occur as the result of 
vagal nerve injury  
Esophageal Injury : Any evidence of a mild complication such as erosion or ulceration or a major 
complication such as puncture, dissection, or perforation to the esophagus.

Gastric Motility Disorders : multiple gastric disorders may occur post AF ablation such as 
constipation, atony, weight loss, early satiety, diarrhea or GI disturbance.  
Gastroparesis:  delayed gastric emptying resulting in paresis of the stomach.  As the vagus nerve 
controls the contractions of the stomach, this may occur when the vagus nerve is damaged and 
the muscles of  the stomach and intestines do not work normally.  
Renal Complications:  
• Renal Failure: Inability of the kidneys to filter toxins resulting in a serum creatinine 
increase to > 2.0 mg/dl and one of the following:  
o increase of 2.0 mg/dl in serum creatinine over any previous value  
o 50% or greater increase in creatinine over baseline procedural value  
requirement for dialysis  
• Renal failure that requires dialysis: a significant decrease in renal function requiring 
dialysis.  
• Renal Insufficiency: An increase in serum creatinine of ≥1.0 mg/dl over previous value.  
 
Vomiting: The ejection of matter from the stomach in retrograde fashion through the esophagus 
and mouth.

Peripheral Is chemia : Deficient supply of blood to the blood vessels outside the heart and brain 
that is due to obstruction of the inflow of arterial blood.  
 
Thromboembolism : Formation of a thrombus ( masses composed of insoluble fibrin, deposited 
platelets, accumulating WBCs, and entrapped RBCs) that obstructs vascular blood flow locally 
and detaches and embolizes to occlude blood flow downstream. Diagnostic confirmation should

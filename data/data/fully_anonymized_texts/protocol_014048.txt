 Background and Introduction:  
Approximately 9% of men and 18% of women are afflicted with migraines. (Stovner, 2006) Over 
90% of patients with migraines report a sensitivity to light (photophobia) during headaches. 
(Evans, 2008) Some migraine sufferers report that light can trigger a migraine and some have a 
chronic sensitivi ty to light. (Main, 1997) Migraineurs are especially sensitive to non -
incandescent lighting sources such as fluorescent lights, computer monitors, and gas -vapor 
lamps.  
The pathway that mediates photophobia appears to involve intrinsically photosensitive r etinal 
ganglion cells ( IPRGCs, Hattar, 2002) and trigeminal afferents (Noseda, 2010; Digre and 
Brennan, 2012). These retinal cells do not require input from photoreceptors to be activated by 
[CONTACT_60230], and they have been shown to be responsible for circadian r hythm entrainment and the 
pupi[INVESTIGATOR_60199]. As such, these cells constitute a pathway separate from that of the visual 
pathway (Güler, 2008). IPRGCs contain the chromophore melanopsin.  Unlike rhodopsin, the 
photosensitive molecule found in rods and cones, melanopsin is a bi -stable molecule. Although 
melanopsin is related to rhodopsin, it shares more similarities with the photosensitive 
molecules found in invertebrate photoreceptors (Mure, 2009). Bi -stable pi[INVESTIGATOR_574163] i soforms that are spectrally distinct (Figure 1). One isoform is 
active and can elicit a physiologic response; the other is inactive. Different wavelengths of light 
(1 and 2) trigger a conformational change between the two isoforms. In the case of 
melanop sin, it is [ADDRESS_753693] ( HIT-6TM) while wearing these filters. However, this study lacked an 
adequate control intervention.  
We hypothesize that if we could selectively block this portion of the visible spectrum, we could 
reduce the severity of headaches in migraine patients. The objective  of this study is to develop 
optical filters that can be applied to spectacle lenses, contact [CONTACT_13276], and light sources that will 
block the target wavelengths. The filters will then be tested in a cohort of adult patients with 
migraines.  If successful, th ese filters could be a novel, non -invasive adjuvant in the treatment 
of migraines and light sensitivity.

 Investigational Device  
Avulux™ is intended to decrease the impact of headache and migraine on normal daily life and 
the ability to function, and reduc e the frequency and severity of headache, in adult patients 
diagnosed with epi[INVESTIGATOR_574164].  
 
Avulux™ consists of a pair of optical filters in the form of spectacle lenses, provided in standard 
spectacle frames or as clip -on u nits, coated with a thin film that effectively blocks light at 
specified wavelength ranges while minimizing distortion of the visible spectrum. The optical 
filters block a portion of the optical spectrum that is suspected to stimulate photophobic 
responses  that trigger some, and exacerbate most, migraines.  
 
Our active and sham lenses will have  tints calibrated such that the optical density, that is the 
overall “darkness” of all study lenses, will be the same. All study lenses will appear to have the 
same overall light -blocking effect to study subjects.  The optical properties of the two lenses are 
demonstrated in Figure 1.   
 
Figure 1 . Optical properties of study lenses (black) and sham lenses (blue)  
The study spectacles will be fitted with “wear over” frames that can be worn easily by [CONTACT_574179], those who  wear contacts, or those who  normally wear 
corrective prescription lenses , as noted in the photo below .

Objectives:  
The long -term goal of the project is to reduce the impact of headache s in patients with  
migraine  headaches. The goal of th is study is to test  optical filters that block light at [ADDRESS_753694] (HIT -
6TM) scores at three weeks when compared to a control/sham device.  
Due to the minimal risk of adverse events wh ile using the device, no safety objective is planned 
for this study, although adverse events (if any) will be recorded and reported.  
Anticipated Clinical Benefits  
The anticipated benefit of this device is to reduce the impact of headache s in patients with 
migraine headaches.  
Anticipated Risks  
There are no anticipated risks from the study or the device, since any potential discomfort 
experienced from use of the device would be mitigated by [CONTACT_574180].  
Study  Design:

Study Procedures  
 
Visit 1:  
At the enrollment visit,  each subject will complete an initial/baseline HIT -[ADDRESS_753698] the same amount of “darkness” to 
the subject.  Subjects will be instructed to use the spectacles for three weeks. They wi ll be 
instructed to put the spectacles on at the first signs or symptoms of their migraine attacks. This 
could be their usual aura, or the first signs of their headache commencing, and to keep the 
spectacles on until their headache has resolved.  
 
The study  spectacles will be fitted with “wear over” frames that can be worn easily by [CONTACT_574179], those that wear contacts, or those that normally wear 
corrective prescription lenses.   
 
Visit 2  (3 weeks ± 2 days) : 
After three weeks they will return to the study site to complete the HIT -[ADDRESS_753699] no access to study glasses, but will be expected to take their current migraine 
medications as needed/prescribed.  
 
Visit 3 (4 weeks ±2 days):  
After the washout period, subjects will return to the study site to receive new spectacles from 
the opposite treatment group, complete another HIT -6 inventory  and then repeat the three 
week treatment period with the other lenses.  
 
Visit 4 (7 weeks ± 3 days):  
After the second treatment period, the subjects will return to t he study site to turn in their 
spectacles and complete the final HIT -[ADDRESS_753700] (HIT -6TM) inventory  at 
base line, week [ADDRESS_753701] of Care vs. Research -Related Procedures:   
All procedures are research -related.  
Study Oversight  
Safety Committees   
This protocol does not pose any significant risk to subjects. Third -party safety committees (i.e., 
clinical events committees or d ata safety and monitoring boards) are  not included.  
Study Monitoring  
Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure that the rights and well -being of human subjects 
are protected, that the reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable, and that the 
conduct of the trial is in compliance with federal regulations , agreements with the sponsor, the 
currently approved protocol, and with any requirements imposed by [CONTACT_1201] . 
 
1. Site monitoring will be performed by a third party CRO working on behalf of Avulux, Inc.  
2. Monitors will be qualified by [CONTACT_574181].  
3. A Clinical Monitoring Plan (CMP) will be developed to establish the plan for study oversight.  
4. On-site monitoring is anticipated throughout the course of the study.  
5. The sponsor will be provided with written reports of these visits, and the sites will be provided 
with a follow -up letter describing the findings and defining any outstanding issues or action 
items required  
Statistical Methods, Data Analysis and Interpretation  
Preliminary Analyses  
Baseline characteristics will be summarized b y randomized treatment group with standardized 
differences between treatment groups used to assess the balance of patient characteristics 
between the two groups. Univariate summaries will also be performed at baseline and follow -
up for the primary and seco ndary outcome variables. If quantitative outcome variables exhibit 
substantial skewness, transformations may be sought to better approximate normality.

on activities of daily living.  
 
Required Sample Size  
In a preceding crossover trial, the pooled cross -sectional SD for the follow -up HIT values ac ross 
the two periods was 7.60 . Assuming a SD in the HIT -6 score of 7.6 points, and allowin g for 10% 
loss-to-follow -up, 50  randomized  crossover  subjec ts  will provide 80% power with 2 -sided 
α=0.[ADDRESS_753703] size.    
Seco ndary Outcome  
To measure effects on the number and severity of headaches, we will use the subjects’ daily 
diaries to count the number of days with headache that either a) made activity difficult, b) 
caused activity changes, or c) caused patient to go to be d. We will then compare the proportion 
of days with headaches that met one of these criteria for the 4-week baseline period and the 3 -
week intervention.  
Exploratory Outcomes  
1. Proportion of subjects who were able to move out of the “very severe impact” ca tegory 
of the HIT -[ADDRESS_753704] a 5 -point improvement in their HIT -6 
score du ring the 3 -week intervention.  
3. Proportion of days with headaches which lead to use of medications to  control the 
headache over the 3 -week intervention.  
4. Proportion of days w ith light sensitivity over the 3 -week intervention.  
5. Average Number of Hours Sl ept over the 3 -week intervention.  
Analysis Plan for Secondary and Exploratory Outcomes  
Based on the initial descriptive s ummaries, each of the above secondary outcomes will be 
classified into one of the following categories:  
 
a) Numeric outcomes which are approximately normally distributed.  
b) Numeric outcomes which can be transformed to approximate normal distributions.  
c) Numeric outcomes which deviate substantially from normality and will be analyzed non -
parametrically.  
d) Numeric outcomes with substantial floor or ceiling effects that will be analyzed as 
dichotomous outcomes.  
Avulux  
Optical  Treatment of Migraines Clinical Study  
Version 1.0 
Page 11  
 Numeric outcomes that can be transformed to approximate normality. All the secondary and 
exploratory outcomes assigned to categories (a) or (b) will be analyzed using analyses of 
covariance (ANCOVAs) to compare the outcomes between the treatment and control groups 
after controlling for the corresponding outcome s during the baseline phase of the study.  
 
Nonparametric Analyses. Secondary outcomes assigned to category (c) will be analyzed by 
[CONTACT_574182] 4 -week follow -up assessment between the 
treatment groups using Wilxocon rank sums  tests.  
 
Binary Outcomes. Outcomes assigned to category (d) will be analyzed by [CONTACT_574183] -
Haenszel tests to compare the 4 -week follow -up values between the treatment groups, with 
stratification for the baseline level of each outcome. Baseline levels will be stratified by [CONTACT_180876].  
 
Multiple comparisons. Multiple comparisons . The secondary outcome will be compared 
between the randomized groups using a 2 -sided α level of 0.05, without adjustment for 
multiple comparisons.  The exploratory outcome s will also be compared between the 
treatment groups using a 2 -sided α level of 0.05, without adjustment for multiple comparisons. 
However, interpretation of results for the exploratory outcomes will take into account the risk 
of Type 1 errors resulting fr om multiple hypothesis tests.  
 
Missing Data . The analysis of the primary outcome as well as other outcomes using linear 
mixed effects models will be approximately unbiased so long as the pattern of missing data is 
missing at random, meaning that the proba bility that an outcome measurement is missing may 
depend on the values of other non -missing measurements, but not on the value of the missing 
measurement itself. Should the fraction of missing measurements for the primary outcome 
exceed 10%, sensitivity an alyses will be performed in which multiple imputation is used to 
impute missing data.  
Control of Investigational Devices/Drugs:  
Avulux , Inc.  will maintain ownership of all devices provided to sites for testing. Clinical sites are 
expected to ensure the d evice is stored securely, yet available to study staff authorized to 
dispense the devices to study subjects. At the end of the study, sites will be asked to return  any 
and all received devices back to Avulux.  
 
All study lenses will be numbered and stored in a locked cabinet. Only authorized study staff 
will have access to spectacles. Devices will be tracked on provided inventory logs.  
 
Abbreviated Device Regulations for Nonsignificant Risk ( NSR) Devices:  
Non signif icant risk determination  
21 CFR 812.3 contains the following definition of “Significant risk device”:  
(m) Significant risk device  means an investigational device that:  
Avulux

Version 1.0 
Page 12  
 (1) Is intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, 
safety, or welfare of a subject;  
(2) Is purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life 
and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;  
(3) Is for a use of substantial importance in d iagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating 
disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential 
for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or  
(4) Otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a 
subject.  
The FDA guidance document  concerning significant and nonsignificant risk assessments 
(“Information Sheet Guidance For IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors Significant Risk and 
Nonsignificant Risk Medical Devic e Studies”; US Department of Health and Human Services, 
Food and Drug Administration; January 2006. ) contains the following information:  
 
A. What is a Significant Risk Device Study?  
Under 21 CFR 812.3(m), an SR device means an investigational device that:  
Is intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or 
welfare of a subject;  
Is purported or represented to be for use supporting or sustaini ng human life and presents a 
potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;  
Is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or 
otherwise preventing impairment of human health and p resents a potential for serious risk to 
the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or  
Otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.  
 
B. What is a Nonsignificant Risk Device Study?  
An NSR device study i s one that does not meet the definition for an SR device study.  
 
C. Who Decides Whether A Device Study is SR or NSR?  
Sponsors are responsible for making the initial risk determination and presenting it to the IRB. 
FDA is also available to help the sponsor , clinical investigator, and IRB in making the risk 
determination.  
 
X. EXAMPLES OF NSR AND SR DEVICES  
The following examples may help sponsors and IRBs in making SR and NSR determinations. The 
list includes many commonly studied medical devices. Inclusion  of a device in the NSR list is not 
a final determination because the evaluation of risk must reflect the proposed use of a device in 
a study.

(Source: http://ihs -classification.org/en/02_klassifikation/05_anhang/01.05.01_anhang.html).  
 
1.1 Migraine without aura  
Description:  
Recurrent headache disorder manifesting in attacks lasting 4 -72 hours.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_574167], pulsating quality, moderate or severe intensity, aggravation by [CONTACT_160444]/or photophobia and phonophobia  
Diagnostic criteria:  
F. At least 5 attac ks1 fulfilling criteria B -D 
G. Headache attacks lasting 4 -72 hours (untreated or unsuccessfully treated)2;3;[ADDRESS_753708] two of the following characteristics:  
5. unilateral location5;6 
6. pulsating quality7 
7. moderate or severe pain intensity  
8. aggravation by [CONTACT_25442] ( eg, walking or climbing stairs)  
I. During headache at least one of the following:  
1. nausea and/or vomiting  
2. photophobia and phonophobia8 
J. Not attributed to another disorder9 
 
Notes:  
1. Differentiating between 1.[ADDRESS_753709] 1 -72 hours (although the evidence for untreated dura tions of less than 
2 hours in children requires corroboration by [CONTACT_541269]).  
4. When attacks occur on ≥15 days/month for >3 months, code as 1.1  Migraine without aura  and 
as 1.5.1  Chronic migraine.  
5. Migraine headache is commonly bilateral in you ng children; an adult pattern of unilateral pain 
usually emerges in late adolescence or early adult life.  
Avulux  
Optical  Treatment of Migraines Clinical Study  
Version 1.0 
Page 17  
 6. Migraine headache is usually frontotemporal. Occipi[INVESTIGATOR_574168] , whether unilateral or 
bilateral, is rare and calls for diagnostic caution ; many cases are attributable to structural lesions.  
7. Pulsating  means throbbing or varying with the heartbeat.  
8. In young children, photophobia and phonophobia may be inferred from their behaviour.  
9. 9. History and physical and neurological examinations do not suggest any of the disorders listed in 
groups 5 -12, or history and/or physical and/or neurological examinations do suggest such disorder 
but it is ruled out by [CONTACT_287465], or such disorder is present but attacks do not occur 
for the first t ime in close temporal relation to the disorder.  
 
1.2 Migraine with  aura  
Description:  
Recurrent disorder manifesting in attacks of reversible focal neurological symptoms that usually 
develop gradually over [ADDRESS_753710] for less than 60 minutes.  Headache with the features 
of migraine without aura usually follows the aura symptoms. Less commonly, headache lacks

Comments:  
The aura is the comp lex of neurological symptoms that occurs just before or at the onset of migraine 
headache. Most patients with migraine have exclusively attacks without aura. Many patients who 
have frequent attacks with aura also have attacks without aura (code as 1.2  Migr aine with aura  and 
1.1 Migraine without aura ). 
Premonitory symptoms occur hours to a day or two before a migraine attack (with or without aura). 
They include various combinations of fatigue, difficulty in concentrating, neck stiffness, sensitivity to 
light  or sound, nausea, blurred vision, yawning and pallor. The terms  prodrome and warning 
symptoms  gare best avoided because they are often mistakenly used to include aura.  
The majority of migraine auras are associated with headache fulfilling criteria for 1.1  Migraine 
without aura.  For this reason the entity 1.2.1  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_574169]. Migraine aura is sometimes associated with a headache that does not fulfil criteria for 
migraine without aura and, in other cases, migr aine aura may occur without headache. These two 
subforms are also now distinguished.

 Aura with similar features has also been described in association with other well -defined headache 
types, including cluster headache; the relationships between aura and he adache are not fully 
understood.  
Before or simultaneously with the onset of aura symptoms, regional cerebral blood flow is 
decreased in cortex corresponding to the clinically affected area and often including an even wider 
area. Blood flow reduction usuall y starts posteriorly and spreads anteriorly and is usually above the 
ischaemic threshold. After one to several hours, gradual transition into hyperaemia occurs in the 
same region. Cortical spreading depression of Leão has been implicated.  
Systematic studie s have demonstrated that many patients with visual auras occasionally have 
symptoms in the extremities. Conversely patients with symptoms in the extremities virtually always 
also suffer visual aura symptoms. A distinction between migraine with visual aura and 
hemiparaesthetic migraine is probably artificial and therefore is not recognised in this classification. 
Patients with motor weakness are classified separately because of the dominantly inherited form,

1.2.1 Typi[INVESTIGATOR_574171]:  
Recurrent disorder manifesting in attacks of reversible focal neurological symptoms that usually 
develop gradually over [ADDRESS_753712]  for less than 60 minutes. Headache with the 
features of migraine without aura usually follows the aura symptoms. Less commonly, headache 
lacks migrainous features or is completely absent.

Comments:  
In some patients a typi[INVESTIGATOR_336042], but many patients 
have, in addition, attacks with aura followed by [CONTACT_105] -migraine headache or even without 
headache. A small number of patients have 1.2.[ADDRESS_753717] 1.2.3  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_574176].  
In the absence of headache fulfilling criteria for 1.1  Migraine without aura , precise diagnosis of 
aura and its distinction from mimics that may signal serious disease (eg, transient ischaemic 
attack) become much more important. This distinction may require investigation. Especially if 
aura begins after age 40, if negative features (eg, hemianopia) are predominant, or if aura is 
prolonged or very short, other causes should be ruled out.  
1.2.4 Familial  hemiplegic migraine (FHM)

present but attacks do not occur for the first time in close temporal relation to the disorder.  
Comments:  
It may be difficult to distinguish weakness from sensory loss.  
New genetic data have allowed a more precise definition of FHM than previously. Specific 
genetic subtypes of 1.2.[ADDRESS_753720] been identified: in FHM1 there are 
mutations in the CACNA1A gene on chromosome 19, and in FHM2 mutations occur in the 
ATP1A2 gene on chromosome 1. If genetic testing is done, the genetic subtype should be 
specified parenthetically.  
It has been shown that FHM1 very often has basilar -type symptoms in addition to the typi[INVESTIGATOR_574177]. During FHM1 attacks, 
disturbances of consciousness (sometimes including coma), fever, CSF pleocytosis and confusion 
can occur. FHM1 attacks can be triggered by (mild) head trauma. In approximately 50% of FH M1 
families, chronic progressive cerebellar ataxia occurs independently of the migraine attacks.

 FHM is very often mistaken for epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], and (unsuccessfully) treated as such.

 Sporadic cases always require neuroimaging and other tests to rule out other cause. A lumbar 
puncture is also necessary to rule out pseudomigraine with temporary neurological symptoms 
and ly mphocytic pleocytosis. This condition is more prevalent in males and often associated 
with transient hemiparesis and aphasia.  
1.2.6 Basilar -type migraine  
Description:  
Migraine with aura symptoms clearly originating from the brainstem and/or from both 
hemispheres  simultaneously affected, but no motor weakness.  
Diagnostic criteria:  
A. At least [ADDRESS_753723] two of the following fully reversible symptoms, but no motor 
weakness:  
1. dysarthria  
2. vertigo  
3. tinnitus  
4. hypacusia  
5. diplop ia 
6. visual symptoms simultaneously in both temporal and nasal fields of both eyes  
7. ataxia  
8. decreased level of consciousness  
9. simultaneously bilateral paraesthesias  
C. At least one of the following:  
1. at least one aura symptom develops gradually over ≥5 minutes and/or different aura 
symptoms occur in succession over ≥5 minutes  
2. each aura symptom lasts ≥5 and ≤60 minutes  
D. Headache fulfilling criteria B -D for 1.1  Migraine without aura  begins during the aura or 
follows aura within 60 minutes  
E. Not attributed to another disorder1 
Note:  
Avulux  
Optical  Treatment of Migraines Clinical Study  
Version 1.[ADDRESS_753724] any of the disorders 
listed in groups 5 -12, or history and/or physical and/or neurological examinations do 
suggest such disorder but it is ruled out by [CONTACT_518516], or such disorder is 
present but attacks do not occur for the first time in close temporal relation to the disorder.  
Comments:  
Basilar -type attacks are mostly seen in young adults. Many patients who have basilar -type 
attacks also report attacks with t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_160334] (code for both disorders).  
If motor weakness is present, code as 1.2.[ADDRESS_753725] basilar -type 
symptoms in 60% of cases. Therefore, [ADDRESS_753726] to misinterpretation as they may 
occur with anxiety and hyperventilation.  
Originally the terms  basilar artery migra ine or basilar migraine  were used but, since 
involvement of the basilar artery territory is uncertain (ie,the disturbance may be 
bihemispheric), the term  basilar -type migraine  is preferred.

Endpoints  Safety  and Efficacy  
Page  5 of 37 Version  Date:  5-9-[ADDRESS_1153774] of Combined  tDCS/CIMT  in Children  with Hemiparesis   Statistical  Methods  Descriptive analyses of baseline  characteristics and outcomes  will 
include  means and standard  deviations  for continuous  variables 
with frequencies and percentages for categorical  variables.  
Analysis  Populations:  There  are 3 analysis populations  planned. 
Intent -to-treat (ITT),  Per-protocol  (PP),  and the Safety  population. 
We do not anticipate  these groups to differ.  
 
Aim #1: Safety  analyses will use the safety  population and be 
primarily  descriptive,  reporting  the number  and perc entage  of 
adverse events.  
  
 
Aim #2:  The primary  analysis  will use the  Intent  to Treat  
population to compare logit-based AHA units  between  the 
intervention  and control  groups  adjusting  for baseline values  of 
AHA and  presence of MEP for precision. Support ive analyses  
using the PP  population will also be  conducted.  Secondary 
endpoints  of Canadian  Occupational  Performance  Measure 
(COPM),  TOKEN test, Stereognosis  and Finger  force  
measurements will be  analyzed  in a similar fashion. The 
association  of improved logit-based  AHA units with  DTI  derived 
fractional  anisotropy  (FA)  and MEP will be  evaluated across all 
patients  using generalized  linear  regression.  Secondary  analyses 
will evaluate these associations also  adjusting for age and sex  due 
to potential  confounding influence  though may be limited by  
[CONTACT_831284]. 
 
Aim #3:  Associations between changes in cortical  excitability  and 
the primary  and secondary  outcomes  will be  evaluated  across all 
patients  using generalized  linear regression  as in Aim #2.  
 
Power  and  Sample  Size:   The  sample  size  and  power   was 
primarily  driven by [CONTACT_831285]  #1 of Aim 
#2. Power  calculations  for the primary  outcome  of logit-based  
AHA units  were  based  on [ADDRESS_1153775] 81% power  to detect  a difference  of [ADDRESS_1153776]  should  
promising  resul ts be found.

of caring  for a person with  cerebral  palsy  is approximately  $1 million dollars.(CDC, 
2013)  The neurologic  deficits  associated  with this  condition can  take  a variety  of different  
forms  though one  of the most  common  manifestations  affects movement  on one  side of  
the body (hem iparesis).  Hemiparetic cerebral palsy  influences  motor  function in children 
during development  and throughout  their lifetime.  The deficits one sees are the result  both 
of the congenitally induced brain  lesion  and the  subsequent  plasticity  that can impair 
function of the surviving  neurons  in the  damaged brain.  
 
Unfortunately, many  current  treatments have limited  influence  on children’s  
neurorecovery. Constraint -induced movement  therapy (CIMT) involving  constraining  the 
unaffected  limb to encourage use of the affected  limb  has shown  promise,  yet with new 
technology revealing  the potential to directly  influence  the brain, there  is an urgent  need to 
study the synergy of combined techniques.  Another rehabilitation technique is b imanual 
therapy. Bimanual therapy  is a treatment in which  the child  works on using two hands for 
everyday tasks . 
 
Non-invasive  brain  stimulation  (NIBS)  as a direct  neuromodulatory intervention  has the 
potential to act  synergistically  with CIMT  or bimanual therapy to influence neurorecovery.  
 
tDCS  is a novel  form of painless,  noninvasive  brain  stimulation.  In contrast  to other  
forms  of NIBS, tDCS  has produced no reported seizures,  is less  than 1/10th the cost,  and 
is more  portable, allowing  simultaneous  use with rehabilitation  interventions.  Although 
motor  improvements  have been  found  using tDCS  in adult  hemiparesis,  the potential  
benefits  of this technique  in children  have not been tested.  
 
Combining behavioral  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], constraint- induced movement  therapy (CIMT)  or 
bimanual therapy with a novel  form of neuromodulation, transcranial  direct  current  
stimulation  (tDCS),  we will investigate  the influence  of this intervention  on improved  
motor  outcomes  in children  with cerebral  palsy.  
 
Children with hemiparesis often exhibit reorganization of the  area of the brain responsible 
IRB Code  # 1408M53169  
Version  Date:  5.9.2017  8 of  37  for movement (specifically the corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_831253]).  Children 
with hemiparesis may exhibit contralateral reorganization (meaning the lesioned hemisphere influences movement of the contralateral mo re-affected hand) or ipsilateral 
reorganization (meaning the non- lesioned hemisphere maintains control of the 
contralateral more -affected hand).  One method to determine reorganization patterns is our 
existing neuroimaging and Transcranial Magnetic Stimula tion (TMS) testing protocols.  
 
Research  Question  and Hypothesis  
The central  hypothesis is that combined tDCS/CIMT  or combined tDCS/Bimanual 
Therapy will be  safe and result  in greater  improvement  in hand function than CIMT  alone  
in congenital  hemiparesis.   Secondary analysis  will explore  for predictive  biomarkers 
based  on baseline  measures of clinical  characteristics and excitability  measures,  as well as 
diffusion tensor  imaging  (DTI).  TMS  testing  for excitability  measures will also determine 
neuroplastic  response to the intervention. CIMT Design:  Two-group randomized  
controlled  preliminary  trial, 20 children ages 8-21 with  hemiparesis,  one group receiving  
active tDCS  with CIMT (intervention)  and one  receiving  sham tDCS  with CIMT  
(control), for 10 daily  sessions.  Bimanual Therapy Design:  One -group open- label 
repeated measures preliminary study, 10 children ages 8 -21 with hemiparesis with all 
children receiving the active tDCS with bimanual therapy (intervention) for 10 daily sessions.  
 
Aim 1.  Establish  the safety  profile of combined  tDCS/CIMT  in congenital  
hemiparesis.  
Our previous  pi[INVESTIGATOR_831254] a one-time 
application  of tDCS.  We will now explore  the safety  of 10 serial  sessions of tDCS  
combined with  CIMT.  
Hypothes is 1: No  seizure activity  or other  serious  adverse event  will occur in either  
group.  
Hypothesis  2: No  decline  in paretic or nonparetic hand function will occur  in either  
group.  
Preliminary results from the [ADDRESS_1153780] participated in our tDCS/CIMT  study 
totaling 260 neuromodulatory sessions has resulted in no serious adverse events.  We will now explore the safety of 10 serial sessions of tDCS combined with Bimanual therapy.  
Hypothesis  1: No  seizure activity  or other  serious  adverse event  will occ ur. 
Hypothesis  2: No  decline  in paretic or non-paretic hand function will occur . 
 
Aim 2.  Determine the behavioral  efficacy  of combined tDCS/CIMT in congenital  
hemiparesis.  We will assess hemiparetic  upper extremity  behavioral  motor  function 
changes  and responsiveness  to interventions.  
Hypothesis  1: The  intervention  group  will show greater  improvement  in paretic  hand 
function than controls.  
Hypothesis  2: The  degree of difference in the  integrity  of the ipsilesional  and 
contralesional  corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_831255], and  
the presence  of ipsilesional  motor  evoked potentials  (MEP),  will be  associated  with  
improved hand function.  
For Bimanual Therapy:  Determine the behavioral  efficacy  of combined tDCS/Bimanual 
Therapy in congen ital hemiparesis.  We will assess hemiparetic  upper extremity  
behavioral  motor  function changes  and responsiveness  to interventions.  
IRB Code  # 1408M53169  
Version  Date:  5.9.2017  9 of  37  Hypothesis  1: The  intervention  group  will result in greater  improvement  in paretic  hand 
function than the non- intervention period . 
Hypothesis  2: The  degree of difference in the  integrity  of the ipsilesional  and 
contralesional  corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_831255], and  
the presence  of ipsilesional  motor  evoked potentials  (MEP),  will be  associated  with  
improved hand function.  
 
Aim 3.  Determine the influence  of combined  tDCS/CIMT on cortical  excitability  in 
congenital  hemiparesis.  Cortical excitability  will be tested  using single -pulse  
Transcranial  Magnetic Stimulation  (TMS).  
Hypothesis  1: Changes  in cortical excitability  will be  associated with improved 
behavioral  outcomes.  
Hypothesis  2: The  intervention  group  will show greater  changes, compared  to 
controls, in contralesional  primary  motor  cortex  (M1) cortical excitability  (i.e. ↑ 
motor  threshold  and ↓  motor evoked potential area)  
Hypothesis  3: When an  ipsilesional  MEP is present, the intervention group  will show  
greater  ipsilesional  M1 cortical  excitability  changes (↓ motor  threshold and ↑ motor  
evoked potential area)  compared to controls. 
For Bimanual Therapy: Determine the influence  of combined tDCS/Bimanual Therapy 
on cortical  excitability  in congenital  hemiparesis.  Cortical excitability  will be tested  
using single -pulse  Transcranial  Magnetic Stimulation  (TMS).  
Hypothesis  1: Changes  in cortical  excitability  will be  associated with improved 
behavioral  outcomes.  
Hypothesis  2: The  intervention  period  will result in changes in the contralesional  
primary  motor  cortex  (M1) cortical excitability  (i.e. ↑ motor  threshold and  ↓ motor 
evoked potential area)  
 
Preliminary  Data  
Combining electrophysiologic  and behavioral  methods, we  have recently  found promising 
results  in pediatric  hemiparesis using  a synergistic  intervention  of constraint - induced 
movement  therapy (CIMT) and  a form of  NIBS - repetitive  transcranial  magnetic  
stimulation  (rTMS).1   Of paramount  importance, the study determined  that alternating  5 
treatments  using 6-Hz primed  low-frequency rTMS with 5  treatments of CIMT  applied to 
the non-stroke  hemisphere  was safe; without serious  adverse events.  The most  common  
minor  adverse events  included headache and cast  irritation.  As to efficacy,  our primary  
outcome  variable,  the Assisting  Hand  Assessment  (AHA),  revealed  a significant  
difference in hand function  between  the control  and treatment  groups. (p=0.007)  Although 
significance was not achieved  for our secondary outcome  measures of  the Canadian  
Occupational  Performance Measure (COPM),  Stereognosis and Finger  Extension force  
there  were  within -group improvements. 
 
These recent  results  demonstrate safety  and reveal  significant  improvements in hand 
function using rTMS combined  with CIMT. However, it is currently  very difficult to 
incorporate  the use of rTMS  at the same time as performing therapy  with the  affected  
upper  extremity  due to machine size and application  challenges.  tDCS  may be more  
feasible.   Applying tDCS/CIMT  concurrently could optimize neuroplastic  principles  of 
IRB Code  # 1408M53169  
Version  Date:  5.9.2017  10 of  37  concurrent  firing  of neurons  and strengthening of neuronal  networks. Also,  TMS/rTM S 
can be ten times  the current  cost of tDCS  and thus cost may  be prohibitive  when  using 
TMS/rTMS. Furthermore, if the  application of tDCS  reduces the  need for additional  
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_831256],  a cost savings could be realized.  Last,  albeit  rare, use of 
rTMS has resulted  in reports of adverse events  such  as seizures  and syncopal  epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841],  
both in adults  and children.[ADDRESS_1153781]  and portability, tDCS  resulted  in 
functional  improvements  in motor function in adults  with and without  the concurrent  use 
of CIMT. 3   The important  rationale  for the investigation of  tDCS  in this  population is  
that the use  of non-invasive  brain  stimulation  could translate  into clinical  applications, 
thus improving the quality of life for children  with  hemip aresis.  
 
After  the rTMS study,  we completed  a tDCS  pi[INVESTIGATOR_831257] a one-time application  
in pediatric  hemiparesis.4  Analysis  of 11 subjects,  children  with  congenital  hemiparesis,  
revealed  no serious  adverse  events  including seizure. We included a  physician  evaluation 
using a modified  Pediatric  Stroke  Outcome  measure,  and cognitive and behavioral  testing  
with no significant  differences from baseline or between  groups  in level  of function.  This 
study established  the feasibility  and safety  of this application.  
Bimanual therapy allows for a child to practice tasks with two -hands allowing for motor 
learning of both hands and mimicking the natural environment.  Bimanual therapy is a 
common therapy approach in the clinical setting.  Review of goal setting data suggests that the majority of children with hemiparesis identify and prioritize bimanual tasks as goals (e.g. tying their shoes, putting books in a backpack).  Evidence suggests that children with congenital hemiparesis benefit equally from CIMT or tw o handed, or 
bimanual, therapy.

Device Description  
Non-Invasive  brain  stimulation  has been  recently  investigated  for benefits  in recovery  of 
motor  function in adults7 and more  recently  in children1,8   One form,  Transcranial  
Magnetic Stimulation  (TMS) , can be used  in specific protocols  either  to test cortical  
excitability  or as an  intervention  to attempt to  influence cortical excitability.  In this study  
we are using TMS only  as a test to assess cortical  excitability  in the  area of the brain  
known as the motor  cortex  or M1.  Recent evidence suggests that 1.0mA and 2.0mA is 
well-tolerated and results in motor learning both for children with typi[INVESTIGATOR_146386]9 
and 1.[ADDRESS_1153782]  Current  Stimulation  (tDCS) will be used as an  intervention, applying 
stimulation  continuously over a  period  of 20 minutes.  
 
Testing  for Cortical Excitability: Transcranial  Magnetic  Stimulation  (TMS):  We will use  
a Magstim  Rapid2 TMS stimulator with  a flat 70 mm figure -of-eight  coil. TMS is a non - 
invasive  method for  assessing  the excitability  of the brain.  The  TMS stimulator is a non- 
significant  risk device.  The technique  involves  placing a special  electrode on the head. 
The electrode we will use  is a flat  figure -of-eight  coil with a  70-mm diameter for each 
loop of the  figure -of-eight.  The center  of the coil is hand held on the scalp  over the 
desired  region to be stimulated.  An electrical  current  is pulsed through  the electrode,  
IRB Code  # 1408M53169  
Version  Date:  5.9.2017  11 of  37  which  creates a magnetic  field.   This  magnetic  field,  in turn, creates an electric  field in the  
surrounding area,  including inside  the skull, which  induces  an ionic  current to flow on t he 
surface of the brain.  Depending on the  parameters  of the stimulation  and the  
excitability  of the underlying cortex, the stimulation  may or may not depolarize  the nerve  
membrane  to threshold.  If it does  depolarize, an action  potential is generated and 
conducted to spi[INVESTIGATOR_831258], which, depending on their  own excitability,  may 
transmit  an action  potential  to muscle.   Ultimately,  the response  is recorded  as a motor  
evoked potential (MEP) with EMG electrodes located  over the target  muscle.  
 
Interven tion: Transcranial  Direct Current Stimulation  (tDCS):  Soterix  Medical  1x1 
stimulator.  This device  is intended for  the noninvasive stimulation  of the cortex  via 
transcranial  current  stimulation  (TCS).  The device  is capable of direct  current  
stimulation  and has a built- in sham  condition setting.  This sham  stimulation  feature 
allows  for consistent  application of the sham  setting  with ramp -up, extinguish and ramp - 
down modulation. As an added measure of safety,  we will be  using the LTE device  which  
provides  built-in adaptation to resistance and current.  This  device  is for  investigational  
research  only in the  [LOCATION_002].   An instructional  video from the Harvard Berenson - 
Allen  Center  for Noninvasive Brain  Stimulation  describes the use of Soterix  tDCS  in 
detail . http://www.jove.com/video/2744/electrode -positioning- and-montage -in-  
transcranial -direct -current -stimulation  
 
All investigational  devices  used  in this study will have the following label  statement: 
CAUTION – Investigational  Device.  Limited by [CONTACT_718539]. 
 
Stereotactic Neuronavigation:  In order to verify  our exact  location  over the motor cortex  
we will be  using a computerized  method of  location called  Stereotactic  Neuronavigation 
(SNN).  (Brainsight  Stereotactic  Neuronavigation,  Rogue  Research, Montreal,  Canada)  
Through the  use of a locator  situated  atop the TMS device  and a comparative subject - 
specific MRI  image on a computer  screen which  shows  the locator  position, we will be  
able to specify  the TMS hotspot location and placement  of the tDCS  electrodes.

1:1 between  intervention  and control  groups  stratified on the presence of an 
ipsilesional MEP  and using randomly permuted blocks of  size 2 and 4. The  children  
will receive 10 weekday  sessions of  daily  tDCS  and CIMT at Gillette Children’s  
Specialty  Healthcare – St. Paul, MN. The study will be  conducted biannually in a 
camp -style format,  anticipating  3-[ADDRESS_1153784],  should 
promising  results  be found.

5 Study Procedures 
 
Eligibility Screening Consent  
To determine eligibility for participation, caregivers will be asked screening info rmation using the 
Medical History Survey (version 3.6.17).  Prior to the collection of screening information that is identifiable, an Eligibility Screening consent form will be offered to caregivers by [CONTACT_6968], fax, mail, or waived.  If a caregiver chooses t o waive the consent for the eligibility screening, we will 
proceed with the eligibility screening at the time of the caregiver’s study inquiry. The waiving of the eligibility screening consent will be documented.  
 To further protect identifiable information, if the caregiver reports their child is not within the age range of 8- [ADDRESS_1153791] a diagnosis of congenital hemiparesis (meaning the 
stroke occurred within the first year of life), the caregiver will be informed their child does not meet the study enrollment criteria and no further screening questions will be asked of the caregiver.   
 
Informed  Consent  
For subjects ages 8-17, each legal  guardian and subject  for this study will be  provided a  
consent  and assent  form  describing  this study and the opportunity to discuss the study 
with the  study  personnel. (Subjects  ages 18-21 will be provided a  non-minor consent  
form only).  Information  will be  provided for  an informed  decision about  their 
participation  in this study. The consent, assent,  and Addendum  to Assent  for Female  
Minors  forms  will be  submitted  with  the protocol  for review  and approval  by [CONTACT_1201]. 
The formal  consent/assent  of a subject,  using the IRB- approved consent/assent  form,  
IRB Code  # 1408M53169  
Version  Date:  5.9.[ADDRESS_1153792]  be signed by [CONTACT_831290](s) and the assent/addendum  assent  form(s) must be  
signed by [CONTACT_831291] - 
designated  research professional  obtaining the consen t/assent.   The  IRB-approved form 
must be  kept on-site and  by [CONTACT_456] -investigator.  
 
Assent  must  be obtained from  all minor  subjects  deemed  capable by [CONTACT_1201] (between  8 
and 17 years old, inclusive)  in addition  to the Informed  Consent  of the legal  guardian  in 
accordance with Federal  Regulations  and/or  the qualifying  Institutional Review  Board  
(IRB).  
 
tDCS/CIMT Randomization  Scheme  
Each  child will be  randomized to either  the real or sham  tDCS  arm of the study. The 
randomization  will be  done by [CONTACT_831292] a random  number  generator.  The study  coordinator  will assign  envelopes, in  
numerical  order, to the  subjects upon their  enrollment.  The envelopes  will in turn be  
shared  by [CONTACT_831293].  
 
tDCS/CIMT Blinding  
The investigator  who performs  the testing,  and the physician who does the evaluations  
will be  blinded to the  treatment  arm as well  as the child/caregiver/family.    The following  
procedure  will be  employed:  
1. The study  coordinator and biostatistician will meet  and a  sealed envelope will  be 
given to the  study coordinator. 
2. The study  coordinator will share the group assignment  with thepr[INVESTIGATOR_2993]cipal  [INVESTIGATOR_2993]vestigator  
[INVESTIGATOR_2993] a secure private room,  in the  absence of the physician, research  tester,  subject  legal  
guardian and subject.   The Medical  Monitor  to the  study will have access  to the group 
assignment.  
3. Interventionist  will, during the intervention, switch the setting  on the tDCS  device  to 
the designated  placebo setting,  hidden from view  of the subject.   Blinding is applied 
through the  designation of the setting  on the tDCS  machine  of sham  or real tDCS.  
For the first 30-seconds of either  setting, a  gradual “ramp -up” sensation  of the 
stimulation  occurs.  This is built into  the machine  for both settings.  However,  for the 
sham  stimulation,  the sensation then abates,  and not until the  end of the 20- minute  
session  does  the subject  receiving  the 30-seconds of “ramp -down”  sham  once again  
experien ce the sensation.  The sensation  then occurs and  “ramps -down”  the amperage  
until the  machine  turns  off. 
4. Information on subject  group assignment  will be logged and  stored  in a designated  
locked cabinet  at the study coordinators  office.  
 
tDCS/Bimanual Therapy : 
As this is an open -label design, all children will complete multiple baseline assessments to serve 
as their comparison period without intervention.  All children will then participate in the real 
tDCS/Bimanual Therapy intervention.  Children, caregivers,  and investigators will not be blinded 
to intervention.  Study collaborators assisting with the scoring of assessments will be blinded to the child’s progress during the intervention phase.  
 
IRB Code  # 1408M53169  
Version  Date:  5.9.2017  18 of  37  Laboratory  Testing Procedures  
Specimen  Preparation:  For females,  urine  samples will be obtained on site at the CTSI  
with use of private  bathrooms. The subject  and legal guardian will be instructed  on how 
to obtain the urine  specimen  by [CONTACT_46575]. The urine  sample will then be obtained  in a 
screw -top urine cup and handed to the  PI [INVESTIGATOR_831267]. 
 
Specimen  Handling and Storage:  Immediate  assessment  of pregnancy status will occur  as 
the PI, in the assignment  laboratory  specimen  assessment  room,  will utilize  the allotted  
amount  of sample  required for adequate  assessment.  Once  the testing  has occurred, the 
sample  will be flushed in a designated  CTSI  urinal  or disposal  sink. No storage  of urine  
material  will occur. If pregnancy test is positive, the child  will be excluded  from  the 
study, and a recommendat ion to follow -up with their primary  care physician will be 
enacted.  
 
No shipment  of specimens will occur  in this  study.  
 
Clinical Procedures  
Phone  Screen: All interested  subjects are screened  by [CONTACT_831294] a review  of inclusion and 
exclusion criteria,  to obtain  general  health  history  of potential subject,  and to give  
opportunity for family  to ask questions and have those  questions  answered.  
Study  Visit 
HIPAA consent  is obtained in order  to perform  a medical  record  review.   Information  for 
all subjects will be  collected  and managed in accordance with HIPAA policies.  This 
review  is completed by [CONTACT_831295]/exclusion by [CONTACT_831296]/CT radiographic reports  of the brain. Eligibility  will be  verified  by [CONTACT_831297] r after  this review.  Eligibility  is then discussed  with  the legal  guardian  and a  
formal  schedule  is established.  The family  will be  sent a detailed  itinerary  outlining  their 
visit.  Families interested in future study participation will be provided with the  
“HIPAA For Future Study” form.  Informed  consent/assent  will be  completed on the 
day of enrollment.

Location:  Center for Magnetic  Resonance  Research  (CMRR)  
Time: 1 hour  
• Consent/Assent  will be  obtained and a pregnancy test for  female  subjects will be 
administered.  
• Subjects  will be scanned  on a Siemens  3T system.  The scan protocol  will include  
both a T1-weighted structural Magnetization  Prepared  Rapid  Acquisition  Gradient  
Echo  (MPRAGE)  scan and Diffusion  Tensor Imaging  (DTI).  
Location:  Clinical and Translational  Science Institute (CTSI)  
Time: 2 hours  
• Cardiovascular  Measurements: Subjects will be instrumented  with a 3 or 12- 
Lead  ECG  for measurement  of heart  rate and a non-invasive  blood pressure 
measuring  device that will be  placed  on a finger  of their hand. (AD Instruments,  
Colorado Springs, CO).  Subject  Report  of Symptoms  survey will be  completed. 
• The testing  researcher will perform  an assessment  of cortical  excitability  using 
Transcranial  Magnetic Stimulation.  The subject  will be comfortably  seated  in a 
reclining  chair.  Surface EMG  electrodes will be  attached over the extensor  digitorum  
muscle serving the nonparetic  hand, which will record the MEPs resulting  from the  
magnetic  stimulation  to the contralesional  M1. Next, the  threshold for TMS  activation  
of the target  muscle will be determined.  Subjects  will wear a tight-fitting  Lycra  
(Invista,  Inc., Wilmington, DE)  swim cap  to allow measurement  and drawing of the 
region where  the optimal scalp  position (“hotspot”)  should be  located.  We will use a  
70-mm figure -eight  TMS coil  conn ected to a Magstim  200 machine. The coil will be  
handheld on the  swim  cap over  the approximate  hotspot  area tangential to the scalp  
and oriented with the  handle pointing posterolaterally  at a 45° angle to the  sagittal  
line. It will be  moved systematically  to find the  true location  of the hotspot. Single - 
pulse  magnetic  stimuli will be  delivered  manually at approximately 0.1 Hz  starting  at 
an intensity  of 60% of the stimulator maximum.  This level  will be  adjusted 
systematically  until the  resting  motor  threshold is  found, defined  as the minimum 
intensity  required  to elicit MEPs >[ADDRESS_1153793]. 
• The testing  researcher  will perform  an assessment  of cognitive and behavioral  
function using:  a TOKEN test  of intelligence,  Assisting  Hand  Assessment,  a 
measure of the child’s  goals, ,Hand Dynamometry,  the Gross  Motor Function 
Classification  Scale Score (GMFCS),   the Manual  Ability  Classification Sy stem 
(MACS),  and a measure of the child’s  general  activity  level.

Version  Date:  5.9.2017  20 of  37  • Subject  will be  randomized  into active vs. sham  group 
• Before  the tDCS  session,  skin under  the electrode region will be assessed  for lesions  
and evidence  of skin disease or abnormalities  which  could cause potential  irritation.  
tDCS  is not administered  if there  is any skin damage,  rash or other  skin lesion  under  
the electrode  sites.  
• Skin is lightly cleaned  with  an alcohol swab,  taking care NOT to abrade  the skin in 
any manner.  Move  hair away  as best  as possible  from  the site  of stimulation in order  
to increase conductance.  
• Sanitized and disinfected  rubber  electrodes with clean,  single -use sponges  dampened 
with normal  saline are placed over the stimulation  sites and held against  the head with  
wide  rubber  bands  which  cover  the entire  surface of the electrodes.  Care is taken  to 
ensure  contact  [CONTACT_831298].  
• The static impedance  measurement  is checked - stimulation  does  not proceed unless  
levels are within  limits  recommended by [CONTACT_831299].  
• Active  tDCS  with CIMT group  (intervention) Stimulation  is commenced  and 
subjects are advised to report  immediately  if the  stimulation  feels painful, or anything 
other  than low-level  itchy  or tingling  sensations,  common  yet consistently  reported at 
any time during  the period of stimulation.  tDCS  continues  with a weak  electrical  
current  of 0.7 mA applied  across the  scalp  for 20 minutes in a  single  experimental  
session.  
• After  the first [ADDRESS_1153794]  is questioned about  pain at the electrode sites.  If 
the stimulation  is painful, a small  amount  of additional  saline (approximately 4 mL) is 
added to the sponge, taking care to avoid wetting  adjacent  hair and thereby [CONTACT_831300],  and the tightness  and placement  of the band are checked.   If pain 
persists,  the stimulation  is stopped and the electrode sites are checked. This procedure  
is repeated twice (every  5 min utes during tDCS)  with a  small amount  of saline  
solution being routinely  applied at these times.  
• During this [ADDRESS_1153795]  investigator  for shapi[INVESTIGATOR_831268].  Additionally, children will 
continue  to use  their paretic  limb during functional  activities  at home  and during a 
daily  parent -supervised  and documented  home program. 
• Sham  tDCS  with CIMT  group  (control).  These children  will receive 10 daily  
sessions of  both CIMT  and sham  tDCS.  Children will receive the same procedures  as 
the active tDCS  with CIMT  group (intervention),  yet the device  will be  set to an  
integrated  placebo setting  which  extinguishes the current  after a 30 second  to 1 
minute  ramp -up phase  and gradually reintroduces  the ramp -down  at the end of the 20 
minute  session.  
• At the  end of  stimulation,  the electrode site is checked for redness or  skin damage. 
The rubber  electrodes and headbands  are cleaned  with a  disinfectant  solution.

Intervention  
Location: University of Minnesota —Center for Neurobehavioral Development (CNBD)  
Time: 2 hours/day  for 10  (business)  days with interim  testing after Day 5 
 
• Before  the tDCS  session,  skin under  the electrode region will be assessed  for lesions  
and evidence  of skin disease or abnormalities  which  could cause potential  irritation.  
tDCS  is not administered  if there  is any skin damage,  rash or other  skin lesion  under  
the electrode  sites.  
• Skin is lightly cleaned  with  an alcohol swab,  taking care NOT to abrade  the skin in 
any manner.  Move  hair away  as best  as possible  from  the site  of stimulation  in order  
to increase conductance.  
• Sanitized and disinfected  rubber  electrodes with clean,  single -use sponges  dampened 
with normal  saline are placed over the stimulation  sites and held against  the head with  
wide  rubber  bands  which  cover  the entire  surface of the electrodes.  Care is taken  to 
ensure  contact  [CONTACT_831298].  
• The static impedance  measurement  is checked - stimulation  does  not proceed unless  
levels are within  limits  recommended by [CONTACT_831301].  
• Active  tDCS  with bimanual therapy  group  (intervention): Stimulation  is 
commenced  and subjects  are advised to report  immediately  if the  stimulation  feels 
painful, or anything other  than low-level  itchy  or tingling  sensations,  common  yet 
consistently reported  at any time during  the period of stimulation.  tDCS  continues  
with a weak  electrical  current  of up to 2.0 mA applied  across the  scalp  for 20 
minutes in a  single  experimental  session.

the stimulation  is painful, a small  amount  of additional  saline (approximately 4 mL) is 
added to  the sponge, taking care to avoid wetting  adjacent  hair and thereby [CONTACT_831302],  and the tightness  and placement  of the band  are checked.   If pain 
persists,  the stimulation  is stopped and the electrode sites are checked. This 
procedure  is repeated twice (every  5 minutes during tDCS)  with a  small amount  of 
saline solution being routinely  applied at these times.

Version  Date:  5.9.[ADDRESS_1153807]  Withdrawal  
How to Withdraw  Subjects : Subjects  may discontinue  participation  at any time,  for any 
reason.  Any subject  observed to have unacceptable responses to research  procedures, or 
to be  unable  to safely  or comfortably tolerate  participation  will be withdrawn.  
 
Subjects  withdrawn  from  study will not be  replaced,  and the details  surrounding the 
circumstances of the reason  for withdrawing  the subject  from the study will be reported 
with no identifiers  included. 
 
Data Colle ction and Follow Up for  Withdrawn Subjects : If a subject and legal  guardian 
are not compliant  with  establishing  and meeting  for the components  of the study, the  
legal  guardian will be  contact[CONTACT_831303] [ADDRESS_1153808]  Population(s) for Analysis  
Any subject who is observed in the  study will have their data analyzed  per the actual  
treatment  received for evaluating safety.  
 
Statistical Methods  
Descriptive analyses of baseline characteristics and outcomes  will include  means and 
standard  deviations for continuous  variables  with  frequencies and percentages for 
categorical  variabl es. Analysis Populations: There are 3 analysis populations planned. 
Intent -to-treat (ITT)  will include  any subject  randomized  according to their treatment  
assignment.  Per-protocol (PP) will include  randomized  subjects without  major protocol  
violations  and who were  compliant  (at least 80%  of planned  sessions with their treatment  
assignment.   A detailed  list of the major protocol  violations  warranting  exclusion  from  
the PP analysis will be  determined prior  to trial commencement.  The Safety  population 
will inc lude all subjects who receive treatment,  according to treatment  received.  We do 
not anticipate these groups  to differ.  
 
Aim #1: Safety  analyses will use the safety  population and be primarily  descriptive,  
reporting the number  and percentage  of adverse events, in particular,  any instances of 
seizure or other  serious  adverse event. Instances  of decline  in paretic  or nonparetic  hand  
function as measured  by [CONTACT_941] (Assisting  Hand  Assessment)  AHA  scaled  score will also be 
evaluated.  
 
For tDCS/Bimanual Therapy: The same analyses will be conducted as the tDCS/CIMT 
study outlined in Aim #1. 
 
Aim #2: The primary  analysis  will use the  ITT population to compare  logit-based AHA  
IRB Code  # 1408M53169  
Version  Date:  5.9.2017  26 of  37  units between  the intervention  and control  group adjusting for baseline values  of AHA  
and presen ce of MEP for precision. Confidence  intervals  and P -values  will be based  on 
the t-distribution  with  corresponding degrees of freedom.  P-values  < 0.05 will be  
considered  significant. Supportive  analyses using the PP  population will also  be 
conducted. Secondary  endpoints of Canadian  Occupational  Performance  Measure 
(COPM),  TOKEN test, Stereognosis and Finger  force  measurements  will be  analyzed  in a 
similar fashion, adjusted  for baseline values  and presence of MEP with  supportive  
analyses using the PP populati on.  The  association  of improved logit-based  AHA units  
with DTI  derived fractional  anisotropy (FA)  and MEP will be  evaluated  across all 
patients  using generalized  linear regression  and the t-distribution  with corresponding 
degrees of  freedom  for inference.  Secondary analyses will evaluate these associations  
also adjusting  for age and sex due to potential  confounding  influence  though may be 
limited by  [CONTACT_19462].  Additional  analyses for the comparisons  mentioned above  will 
consider non-parametric tests or  transformations  of variables in the event  distributional 
assumptions  do not hold.  
 
For tDCS/Bimanual Therapy:  The primary analysis will compare logit -based AHA 
units pre and post intervention.  Confidence  intervals  and P -values will be based  on the 
t-distribution  with  corresponding degrees of freedom.  P-values  < 0.05 will be  considered  
significant.  Supportive  analyses  using the PP  population will also be conducted. 
Secondary endpoints of Canadian  Occupational  Performance  Measure (COPM),  
caregiver questionna ires will be  analyzed  in a similar  fashion, adjusted for baseline 
values.  Secondary analyses will evaluate these associations  also adjusting for age and 
sex due to potential confounding influence  though may be limited by  [CONTACT_19462].  
Additional  analyses for the comparisons  mentioned above  will consider non-parametric 
tests or  transformations  of variables in the event  distributional  assumptions do not hold. 
 
Power  and Sample  Size:  The sample size and power  was primarily driven  by [CONTACT_831304]  #1 of Aim #2. Power  calculations for the primary  outcome  of 
logit-based  AHA units  were  based  on 10 patients  in each group with variability  estimates 
from  the rTMS/CIMT  study mentioned in the preliminary  studies  section  suggesting a 
standard  deviati on of approximately 16. The correlation  between  pre- and post-treatment  
AHA scores in the rTMS/CIMT study  was 0.97. Based  on these estimates,  we will have 
81% power  to detect  a difference  of [ADDRESS_1153809]  should promising  results  be found.  
 
Aim #3:  Associations between  changes in cortical  excitability  and the primary  and 
secondary  outcomes will  be evaluated  across all patients  using generalized  linear  
regression  as in Aim #2.  The change in contralesional  M1 cortical  excitability  will be  
compared  between intervention  and control  groups, adjusting for baseline values,  using 
the ITT population. This  comparison will be  repeated  within  the subgroup of patients  
with an  ipsilesional MEP.  Similar to other  aims,  confidence  intervals  and P-values  will 
be based  on the t-distribution  with corresponding degrees of  freedom  and supportive  
analyses using the PP population will also be  conducted. Additional  analyses for the 
comparisons  mentioned above  will consider  non- parametric  tests or  transformations  of 
variables in the  event  distributional assumptions  do not hold. 
 
IRB Code  # 1408M53169  
Version  Date:  5.9.2017  27 of  37  7 Safety and  Adverse Events  
Definitions  
Adverse Event  (AE): An adverse event  (AE)  is any  symptom, sign, illness  or experience 
that develops  or worsens  in severity  during the course  of the study. Intercurrent illnesses 
or injuries  will be regarded  as adverse events.  Abnormal  results  of laboratory or 
diagnostic  procedures  are considered  to be  adverse  events  if the  abnormality:  
• Results in study withdrawal 
• Is associated  with  a serious  adverse event  
• Is associated  with  clinical signs  or symptoms  
• Leads to additional  treatment or to further diagnostic tests 
• Is considered by [CONTACT_831305].  
 
Serious  Adverse Event  (SAE):  A serious  adverse event  (SAE)  is any adverse  event  that is:  
• Fatal  
• Life-threatening  
• Requires  or prolongs a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• Results in persistent or significant  disability  or incapacity  
• A congenital  anomaly or birth defect  
 
Important  medical  events are events  that may  not be immediately  life-threatening, but are 
clearly  of major  clinical  significance and may be SAEs.  They  may jeopardize the 
subject,  and may require intervention  to prevent  one or the other  serious  outcomes noted 
above.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_831269] (even  if less than 24 
hours)  to a healthcare facility  as a result of  a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_831270];  to 
include  transfer within th e hospi[INVESTIGATOR_831271]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_831272] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505],  clinical  adverse effect  
(e.g., for  a preexisting  condition not associated with a new adverse effect  or with a 
worsening of the preex isting  condition;  admission  for a protocol -specified  procedure)  is 
not, in itself,  a serious  adverse effect.  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect  (UADE) : An unanticipated adverse device  effect  is 
any serious adverse effect  on health or safety  or any life-threatening problem  or death  
caused  by, or associated  with, a  device, if  that effect,  problem, or death  was not 
previously identified  in nature, severity, or  degree  of incidence in the investigational 
plan, or  any other  unanticipated serious problem  associated  with a  device  that relates  to 
the rights,  safety,  or welfare of subjects.  
 
Unanticipated Problems  Involving Risk To  Subjects  or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845]) : An adverse 
event  that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_831273], related  to the  device,

Anticipated  Adverse Events  
Subjects  will be children  who  sustained  a congenital  stroke  before, during or one-year 
after birth.  In addition to cited  research procedure  risk, they will be  at risk for  
complications,  morbidities  and mortalities associated  with pediatric  strokes. 
 
Adverse Event Reporting 
All Adverse  Events  occurring during the study period must  be recorded.  The clinical  
course  of each event  will be  followed  until  resolution, stabilization,  or until it has  been 
determined  that study  treatment or  participati on is not the  cause.  
 
The Sponsor -Investigator  will promptly  review documented adverse effects and abnormal  
test findings  to determine 
1) if the  abnormal  test finding should be  classified  as an  adverse effect;  
2) if there  is a reasonable possibility that the adverse effect  was caused  by [CONTACT_831314], if applicable,  other  study treatment or diagnostic  
product(s);  and 
3) if the  adverse effect  meets the  criteria  for a serious  adverse effect.  
 
If the Sponsor -Investigator’s  final determination  of causali ty is “unknown and of  
questionable  relationship  to the  investigational  device  or, if  applicable,  other  study 
treatment  or diagnostic  product(s)”, the adverse effect  will be  classified  as associated  with 
the use  of the  investigational  device or study  treatm ent or diagnostic drug  product(s)     
for reporting  purposes.  If the investigator -sponsor’s  final determination  of causality  is 
“unknown but not related  to the  investigational  device or, if applicable, other  study 
treatment  or diagnostic  product(s)”, this determination  and the rationale  for the 
determination  will be  documented  in the  respective subject’s case history.  
Adverse Events  
All observed or volunteered adverse effects and abnormal  test findings, if applicable, or  
suspected causal  relationship  to the  investigational  device or, if  applicable, other  study 
IRB Code  # 1408M53169  
Version  Date:  5.9.[ADDRESS_1153815](s)  will be recorded  in the  subjects’  case histories.   For all 
adverse effects,  sufficient  information will be  pursued and/or  obtained so as to permit 
 
1) an adequate  determ ination  of the outcome of the effect  (i.e., whether  the effect  should 
be classified  as a serious  adverse effect)  and;  
2) an assessment  of the casual  relationship  between  the adverse effect  and the 
investigational device  or, if applicable, the other  study treatment  or diagnostic  product(s).  
 
Adverse effects  or abnormal  test findings  felt to be associated with the  investigational 
device  or, if  applicable,  other  study treatment  or diagnostic product(s)  will be followed  
until the  effect  (or its sequelae)  or the abnormal  test finding resolves  or stabilizes  at a 
level  acceptable to the Sponsor -Investigator.  
 
Adverse  Events  that do not  qualify as Serious  Adverse Events  or as Unanticipated  
Adverse  Device  Effects will be  reported the IRB with the  continuing review  progr ess 
report.  
 
Serious Adverse Events  
Unexpected  serious  adverse events that are at least  possibly related  will be reported  to the  
IRB within 10 days  of learning  of the event. 
 
Unanticipated  Adverse Device Effects  (UADE)  
Investigators are required  to submit a report of a UADE  to the  reviewing  IRB as soon as 
possible, but in no event  later than [ADDRESS_1153816]

their PHI. 
 
In the event  that a subject revokes  authorization to collect  or use PHI, the investigator,  by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains  the ability  to use  all information  collected  prior  to the  revocation of  
subject  authorization.   For subjects that  have revoked authorizat ion to collect  or use PHI, 
attempts  should  be made  to obtain permission to collect  at least vital status (i.e. that the  
subject  is alive)  at the end of  their scheduled  study period.

to all study- related documents  and study related  facilities  (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic  
laboratory, etc.),  and has adequate  space to conduct  the monitoring visit.  
 
Study  Monitoring Plan  
The study  uses a non-significant  risk device.  Therefore, independent  monitoring  of the 
clinical  study  for clinical  protocol  and abbreviated IDE  application  compliance will be  
conducted periodically  (i.e., at  a minimum of annually)  by [CONTACT_831318]’s  Clinical  and Translational  Science Institute  (CTSI).  
 
Quality  Assurance Procedures  
Data will be reviewed  for completeness and accuracy  at the end of the trial by [CONTACT_831319].  
 
Auditing  and Inspection  
The investigator  will permit study- related  monitoring, audits, and inspections  by [CONTACT_1201], 
the sponsor, government  regulatory  bodies, and University  compliance and quality  
assurance groups of all study related  documents  (e.g.  source documents,  regulatory  
documents, data collection  instruments, study data etc.).  The investigator will ensure  the 
capability  for inspections  of applicable  study- related  facilities  (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic  
laboratory, etc.).  
 
Participation  as an investigator in this study implies  acceptance of potential  inspection by 
[CONTACT_831320].

Conflicts of Interest  
Any investigator who has  a conflict  of interest  with this study (patent  ownership, 
royalties, or financial  gain greater  than the  minimum  allowable by [CONTACT_1385],  etc.) 
must  refer to the  Regents  Policies  on Individual  Conflict of Interest  Policy  or Institutional 
Conflict  of Interest  Policy. These policies require  University  Faculty  and staff to report  
external  professional  activities  and business and significant  financial  interests  related  to 
his or her University  activities by  [CONTACT_17258]  a REPA (Repo rt of External  Professional  
Activities) at least once per year.  Faculty  and staff should also  file a REPA  when  
substantial  changes in business or  financial  interests  occur, when an activity  that presents  
a potential conflict of interest  is anticipated, or when submitting  an application for 
research  support or  technology transfer,  submitting  research  protocols  to the IRB, or 
receiving  financial  contributions. All University  of Minnesota  investigators  will follow  
the University  conflict  of interest  policy.

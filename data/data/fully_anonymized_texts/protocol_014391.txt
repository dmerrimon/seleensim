Secondary Objectives: 
•To evaluate the efficacy of topi[INVESTIGATOR_204543] (WHO Grade ≥ 3) in subjects with HNC receiving concomitant
chemoradiation therapy.
•To evaluate the efficacy of topi[INVESTIGATOR_204544] (WHO Grade ≥3)  in subjects with HNC receiving concomitant chemoradiation
therapy.
Design and Methodology: 
The study is a Phase 2, randomized (1:1 ratio), double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2- arm 
trial to be conducted in patients receiving chemoradiation for the treatment of squamous 
cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or supraglottic larynx. Patients with this diagnosis whose anticipated treatment includes chemoradiation therapy (CRT) and who consent to participate will enter a screening period of up to 45 days prior to the anticipated initiation of CRT. If eligible, subjects will be rand omized to one of the 
two blinded study treatments and will enter the treatment phase of the study (approximately 11 weeks in duration).  
For entry into the study, e ligible patients will have recently -diagnosed (in the previous 6 
months), pathologically-confirmed, non- metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the oral 
cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or supraglottic larynx. Tumor staging for eligibility, 
using AJCC Tumor Staging Guidelines, or as determined by [CONTACT_204548] (CT, PET, and/or MRI) obtained within 120 days prior to consent for screening. Scan interpretation should follow Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 criteria (Appendix E).  
Patients must be scheduled to receive a continuous course of intensity-modulated radiation 
therapy (IMRT) with a minimum cumulative dose of 55 Gray (Gy) and maxi mum 
cumulative dose of 72 Gy over approximately 7 weeks (treatment week is defined as a 7-day period, irrespective of the day of the week that the 7-day period begins). Planned radiation treatment fields must include at least two oral sites (buccal mucosa,  floor of 
mouth, ventral/lateral tongue, soft palate). The treatment plan must include chemotherapy with cisplatin administered in standard weekly (30 -40 mg/m
2) or approximately every 21 
days (80-100 mg/m2) regimens. No other chemotherapy is allowed during radiotherapy 
unless intolerance to cisplatin is demonstrated during study participation. In this case, with medical monitor approval, carboplatin may be substituted. 
Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive one of the following study drug regimens 
during participation in the study (1:1 ratio):  
Arm A: Placebo (WFI) [oral rinse  tid] 
Arm B: Brilacidin 3 mg/mL in WFI [oral rinse  tid] 
The study drug will be administered as an oral rinse three times dail y (approximately 6 
hours between oral rinses) beginning on the first day of radiotherapy and continuing each 
day (including weekends) until the completion of the course of chemoradiation. The 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol, Version 1.[ADDRESS_244051] should rinse his/her mouth with plain water prior to administering the oral rinse.  Subjects will be told not to eat, drink, brush their teeth, 
chew gum, or suck on hard candy, cough drops, etc., for 30 minutes following each use of the oral rinse.  Subjects who use allowed non- study oral rinse(s) (i.e., Gelclair®, saline 
solutions) during the study period should ensure that the study oral rinse is used at least [ADDRESS_244052] 60 minutes after use of the study rinse.  
Note: Although chemoradiation is complete (i.e. the end of radiation therapy ( ERT) visit 
has occurred), subjects are to complete the full 7 days of study drug for Week 7. 
The treatment phase of the study will inclu de: (1) the period of RT treatment with 
concomitant chemotherapy and (2) all assessments occurring after the last dose of RT, 
through and including a Week [ADDRESS_244053]-RT follow- up visit (the EOS visit).  
•During the CRT treatment period, subjects will be assesse d twice weekly for the
presence and severity of OM by [CONTACT_204549]. Subjects will complete a daily study diary (including weekend days). The diarycontains Question 2 of the Oral Mucositis Daily Questionnaire (OMDQ) , a record of
daily analgesic use for mouth and/or throat pain, a record of the study drug oral rinsesperformed each day, and the subject’s assessment of mouth sensations.  The diary willbe reviewed by a member of the study staff each day during the first week (at least 5days) of study treatment to ensure that the subject is appropriately completing thediary. If subject diary completion is satisfactory, then the diary will be reviewed atleast once weekly during the remainder of the study. At weekly int ervals (on the same
day of each week), subjects will complete the FACT-H&N instrument to recordquality of life responses.
•Single samples (venous blood) for assessment of brilacidin plasma concentrations will
be obtained from each subject at weekly intervals during the CRT treatment period.
These blood samples may be obtained at the time of the venipuncture for clinicallaboratory tests as specified by [CONTACT_760].
•For those subjects who have consented to gene analysis, samples of venous blood willbe obtained at baseline, during week 3, and on the last day of radiation.
•All subjects will be evaluated at 1 week after RT completion (or withdrawal from thestudy) for assessment of the presence and severity of OM and other safetyassessments. Subjects having an WHO OM Grade  ≥[ADDRESS_244054]- treatment visit will
return to the clinic at weekly intervals until mucositis resolves to WHO OM Grade <2;
subjects having a WHO OM Grade ≤[ADDRESS_244055] -H&N QOL instrument weekly until 4 weeks (± 2 days) post-
RT. In most instances the last study related visit, the End of Study (EOS) visit, will be 
at Week [ADDRESS_244056]- RT. 
Patient E ligibility: 
•Patients with recently diagnosed (within previous 6 months), pathologically-
confirmed, non- metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx,
hypopharynx, or supraglottic larynx.
•Patients scheduled to receive a continuous course of IMRT over approximately 7weeks (treatment week is defined as a 7 -day period, irrespective of the day of the
week that the 7 -day perio d begins) with a minimum cumulative dose of 55 Gray (Gy)
and maximum cumulative dose of 72 Gy. ( IMRT is typi[INVESTIGATOR_204545] 35
separate radiation treatments ).
•Planned radiation treatment fields must include at least two oral sites (buccal mucosa,floor of mouth, ventral/lateral tongue, soft palate). The treatment plan must include
chemotherapy with cisplatin administered in either a standard weekly (30- 40 mg/m
2)
or approximately every 21 days (80-100mg/m2) regimen. No other chemotherapy is
allowed during radiotherapy unless intolerance to cisplatin is demonstrated. In thiscase, with medical monitor approval, carboplatin may be substituted.

Protocol, Version 1.[ADDRESS_244065], Dose, and Mode of Administration: 
Brilacidin (45 mg/ 15mL WFI) oral rinse tid, or placebo (15mL WF I) oral rinse tid  
Efficacy and Safety Endpoints:  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
Incidence of severe OM  (WHO Grade ≥3) experienced during radiation therapy by  [CONTACT_204551] a cumulative radiation dose 
of at least 55 Gy . 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
•Duration of severe OM (WHO Grade ≥3) , from initial WHO Grade ≥[ADDRESS_244066] WHO Grade 2 or lower OM assessment during/after radiation
therapy .
•Duration 
of severe OM (WHO Grade ≥3) , from initial WHO Grade ≥[ADDRESS_244067] WHO Grade ≥3 assessment during/after radiation therapy .
•Time t
o onset of severe OM (WHO Grade ≥3).
•Incidence of severe OM (WHO Grade ≥3) by [CONTACT_204552] .
Safety
 Endpoints  
The safety and tolerability of treatment with  brilacidin will be assessed through incidence, 
severity  and type of adverse events, including serious adverse events, and changes in 
clinical laboratory parameters , blood pressure, heart rate, ECOG, and body weight. 
Systemic Exposure/Pharmacokinetic Endpoints  
Brilacidin systemic exposure will be estimated from plasma sample concentrations ; 
samples  will be obtained from each randomized subject at weekly intervals d uring the CRT 
treatment period.  
Data Analysis: 
Efficacy Analyses 
Full details of the statistical methodology for summary and analyses of the data collected 
in this study will be prepared separately from this protocol in a S tatistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP).  
The primary efficacy objective is to evaluate brilacidin compared to placebo in reducing 
the incidence of severe OM (defined as grade 3 or 4 on the WHO Oral Mucositis scale, WHO Grade ≥3) in subjects with HNC  receiving concomitant chemoradiation therapy and 
a cumulative radiation dose of at least [ADDRESS_244068] 
will be used. 
Time to onset of severe OM (WHO Grade ≥3) will be assessed using the log rank test. Both 
a scale of days, and a scale of cumulative radiation dose delivered (Gy) will be used for the 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol, Version 1.[ADDRESS_244069] will be used to compare treatment groups at time 
of onset of severe OM. Time to onset of ulcerative OM (WHO Grade ≥2) will be explored 
similarly.  
Duration of severe OM (WHO Grade ≥3) is evaluated two different ways: (1) Initia l instance 
duration of severe OM is defined as the number of days from initial WHO Grade ≥[ADDRESS_244070] WHO Grade 2 or lower OM Grade occurs; (2) Overall duration of severe OM is defined as the number of days from initial WHO G rade ≥[ADDRESS_244071] WHO Grade ≥3 assessment during/after radiation therapy. If any subject does not experience severe OM, his/her duration will be set to 0. Subjects who experience severe OM but do not resolve to WHO Grade [ADDRESS_244072] of treatment on the duration of severe OM will be assessed using a log rank statistic. Analyses will be done using 
both a scale of days, and a scale of 
cumulative radiation dose delivered (Gy). 
Safety  Analysis 
All safety data, demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively through appropriate data tabulations, descriptive statistics, and categorical summaries. 
Changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and hematology and clinical chemistry parameters 
from baseline to the end of the study will be summarized. Treatment- emergent changes from 
values within normal range to abnormal values in clinical laboratory parameter s will be 
identified by [CONTACT_204553] . ECOG and body weight changes from 
baseline to the end of the study will also be summarized.  
Interim Analysis  
Ad-hoc interim analyses may be conducted to support decision making concerning the 
current clinical study, the Sponsor's clinical development projects in general or in case of any safety concerns. Such analyses may be unblinded, and the details  will be documented 
in the SAP. 
Sample Size  
The proportion of subjects experiencing  severe OM (WHO Grade ≥ 3) after a total 
cumulative  radiation dose of at least 55 Gy  (and no more than 72 Gy)  is unknown but 
expected to be approximately 75% for the placebo oral rinse  treatment group , and the 
assumption f or the active Brilacidin oral rinse treatment group  is estimated to reduce to 
approximately 35- 40%. Based on these assumptions, a sample size of [ADDRESS_244073] 80% power .

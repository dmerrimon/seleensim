SCRI  Innovations  
Protocol Number:  BRE 203  
Sponsor:  SCRI Development Innovations, LLC  
Study  Duration:  The total duration of the study is planned to be 48  months 
(enrollment and active treatm ent). Phase of Study :  II 
Study  Centers:  This is a multicenter study  to be conducted in the [LOCATION_002] at approximately 1 5 sites.  
Patient Population  This s tudy will enroll patients with MBC  who ha ve progressed on prior hormonal / 
chemotherapy regimens  and whose cancer  expresses AR .  Patients will be enrolled onto one 
of the 2  following cohorts based on their tumor specificity:  
• Cohort 1:  Patients with estrogen receptor negative ( ER-)/progesterone receptor 
negative (PR-)/ human epi[INVESTIGATOR_34387] 2 negative (HER2 -)/AR 
positive ( +) MBC  with 1  to 3 previous tre atments for metastatic disease  
• Cohort 2:  Postmenopausal women with ER+ and /or PR+/AR+ re fractory MBC  who 
have progressed after at least one,  and up to 3,  previous hormonal treatments fo r 
metastatic disease.  
Objectives:  Primary Objective s 
The primary objectives of this study are  to evaluate:  
• Response rate (RR) and disease control rate (DCR)  following treatment with 
orteronel  in patients with refractory metastatic triple -negative breast cancer 
expressing AR  (ER-/PR-/HER2 -/AR+ ) 
• Response rate and disease control rate (DCR)  following treatment with orteronel  in 
patients with refractory ER+ and/or PR+/AR+ breast cancer . 
Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives  of this study are  to evaluat e: 
• Safety and tolerability of the regimen  
• Measurement of changes in serum estradiol levels, total and free testosterone levels , 
and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)  during treatment with orteronel  
• Measurement of changes in a drenocorticotropic hormone  (ACTH ), 
dehydroepi[INVESTIGATOR_696738]  (DHEA- S), and c ortisol levels during treatment with 
orteronel  
• Progression -free survival  (PFS)  
• Overall survival  (OS) . 
Exploratory Objective  
As an  explorato ry objective of this trial:  
• Archived tumor tissue will be assayed  for the following biomarkers:  loss of 
phosphatase and tensin homolog ( PTEN ) and phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase  
(PIK3CA ) mutation.  
Number of 
Patients:  Up to 86 patients are planned to be enrolled in this study (6 for the lead -in phase  and 80 for 
continuous study treatment ). 
Study Design:  This is an open -label multicenter study  to be conducted in 2 stages .  All patients will receive 
orteronel  orally (PO) at a dose of 300 mg twice daily (BID).  
• Lead -in Phase :  The first [ADDRESS_945509] 4  weeks of 
treatment, and if no prohibitive toxicities are identified, continuous study treatment 
will begin.

Statistical 
Metho dology:  For patients with ER -/PR-/HER2 -/AR+ tumors  (Cohort 1) , the expected response rate with 
standard anti -estrogen therapy is expected to be zero.  Therefore, a response rate of at least 10% 
with orteronel therapy would indicate activity and would lead to further investigation.  
Assuming an evaluable population of [ADDRESS_945519] 95% confidence interval s (CIs) for a 
hypothesized response rate of 11% is (2.4%, 28.6%).  In order to incorporate an early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877], Simon’s two -stage design  is appl ied using alpha = 0.10 and power = 0.80 with comparison 
of the hypothesized response rate of 11% versus a conservative value of 2%.  Initially, 
19 patients  will be enrolled in this cohort, and  if no responses are observed, recruitment to this 
cohort will s top.  Otherwise, enrollment in this cohort will continue to full accrual of 
28 patients.  To account for an unevaluable  rate of 10%, a total of 31 patients will be enrolled in 
this cohort.  
 
For patients with ER+ and/or PR+/AR+ tumors  (Cohort 2), published data on exemestane as 
third -line hormonal therapy in postmenopausal women indicate a response rate of 13% and a 
clinical benefit rate (CR, PR , or SD >24weeks) of 30% .  It is hypothesized  that treatment with 
orteronel in this  patient p opulation  will produce  similar results.   Assuming an evaluable 
population of [ADDRESS_945520] 95% CIs  for a hypothesized response rate of 14% is (5.8%, 
26.7%).  In order to incorporate an early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877], Simon’s two- stage design  is applied  
using alpha = 0.10 and powe r = 0.80 with comparison of the hypothesized response rate of 14% 
versus a conservative value of 5.1%.   Initially, 26 patients  will be enrolled in this cohort, and  if 
one or no responses are observed , recruitment into this cohort will stop.  Otherwise, enr ollment 
in this cohort will continue to full accrual of 50 patients.   To account for an unevaluable  rate of 
10%, a total of 55 patients will be enrolled in this cohort.

Page 19 of 80 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Background  
The androgen receptor (AR) is expressed in 70% to 90% of primary breast tumors and in 75% of 
breast cancer metastases.  It  is the sole sex steroid receptor expressed in 35% of metastases 
(Birrell et al. 1998 ). 
Triple -negative breast cancer (TNB C), which is estrogen -receptor negative ( ER-), progesterone -
receptor negative ( PR-), and human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3915] -growth -factor -receptor -2 negative ( HER2 -) 
constitute s 20% of all new breast cancers diagnosed.   The p atients who experience this disease 
do not benefit from standard hormone or HER2- targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , and there are no optimal 
standard treatment regimens for the management of metastatic TN BC. 
Although survival is more favora ble in the ER+ group of patients , there are few non -toxic 
treatments available once anti -estrogen therapi[INVESTIGATOR_696741].  Hence, there is an impetus to 
develop novel hormonal agents in refractory metastatic breast cancer  (MBC) .  Clinical interest is 
currently being directed to the role of the AR as a potential therapeutic target for treat ment of 
MBC  in the ER -/AR+ an d the ER+/AR+ subsets of patients ( Gucalp and Traina, 2010).  
The effects of androgen inhibition and stimulation on ER+/AR+ cancers are variable.  Approximately 30% of patients with ref ractory MBC  will respond to androgen therapy.  It is 
clear that androgens do not always act as growth promoters in breast cancer in the same ways that estrogens do.  In fa ct, preliminary work has shown that, for estrogen- dependent growth in a 
cancer cell, there is a functional interaction of ER and AR signaling.  Certain cell lines , when 
given testosterone, show inhi bition of ER activity in a dose -dependent fashion.  Also, when a 
constitutively active AR is introduced to certain cell lines (T -47D), estrogen- induced 
proliferation is inhibited.  It is thought  that this AR is recruited to specific estr ogen response 
elements and prevent s activation of target genes that mediate s timulatory effects of estrogen on 
breast cancer cells  (Gucalp and Traina, 2010).   In other breast cancer cell lines, androgens have 
been shown to promote growth and proliferation.  MCF 7 cells (ER +/PR+ and AR+) and  MDA -
MB453 cells (ER -/PR- and AR+)  are both stimulated by [CONTACT_696772]  (Birrell et al. 1998 ).  
We hypothesize that patients with breast cancers expressing similar receptor profiles might respond when androgen levels are lowered by [CONTACT_696773].  
1.2. Orteronel  
Orteronel , a novel, orally active, selective , nonsteroidal  inhibitor of 17, 20- lyase, is being 
developed as an endocrine therapy for relevant hormone -sensitive cancers such as prostat e 
cancer and breast cancer.  Orteronel  is expected to suppress sex hormone levels in both 
circulation and relevant hormone -dependent malignant tissue. 
1.2.1. Summary of Non -clinical Findings  
In vitro  and in vivo  pharmacology studies indicate that orteronel is a r eversible inhibitor of 
human and monkey 17,20- lyase activity. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion 
(ADME) studies, showed that the bioavailability of orteronel in rats and monkeys was 41.0% and 70.5%, respectively.  
14C-labeled parent compound and metabolites were distributed widely into 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
STUDY  DRUG: Orteronel  SCRI  INNOVATIONS STUDY  NUMBER :  BRE 203  
DATE OF PROTOCOL :  Versi on 3.0 30 October  2013 
Page 20 of 80 the tissues of male and female rats, with relatively high concentrations in the liver and adrenal 
gland.  Orteronel is metabolized into M -I (also known as M1) via hydrolysis of the amide bond 
and other minor metabolites via lucuronidation of both orteronel and M -I (in human plasma 
samples).  Additionally, T -1358043 (TAK -700 dehydrate) is a minor metabolite of orteronel that 
is also a process impurity and drug product degradant.  In vitro  testing demonstrated m inimal 
involvement of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes in the metabolism of orteronel.  Orteronel is not an inducer of CYP2B6 and 3A4/5, but is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2.  Based on the results of CYP isozyme and transporter inhibition studies, orteronel i s unlikely to cause CYP 
isozyme - or transporter- mediated drug -drug interactions (DDIs).  In addition, a physiologica lly 
based pharmacokinetic  DDI modeling study showed that orteronel, as an inhibitor, is unlikely to 
cause CYP isozyme- mediated clinical DDI.   Orteronel and its metabolites were eliminated 
primarily in the feces in rats and urine in monkeys. 
The safety of orteronel has been assessed in a battery of single and repeat -dose oral (PO) toxicity 
studies in mice, rats, dogs, and/or monkeys; reproducti ve toxicity studies in rats and rabbits; and 
genotoxicity studies; as well as additional toxicology studies with T -1358043.  Effects noted in 
toxicology studies were consistent with the pharmacologic inhibition of 17,20- lyase activity  and 
included atrophy of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_4046], prostate, and seminal vesicle; delay in the development of 
spermatogenesis; increased fetal mortality; and decreased fetal weights. In chronic [ADDRESS_945532] levels (NOAELs ) were 3 
and 1 mg/kg, respectively, which corresponded with area under the concentration- versus -time 
curves (AUC) from 0 to 24 hours (AUC
0-24hr) values of 1649 and 1016 hr*ng /mL in males, 
respectively.  
Orteronel itself was not mutagenic or clastogenic in g enotoxicity tests and did not elicit changes 
indicative of cutaneous or ocular phototoxicity.  However, T -1358043 was positive for 
genotoxicity in vitro  and when dosed neat, positive for genotoxicity in Muta™Mice dosed with 
T-1358043 at ≥15 mg/kg (mean T -1358043 AUC 0-24hr of 7950 hr*ng/mL).  However, T -1358043 
was negative for genotoxicity when dosed at 5 mg/kg (AUC 0-24hr of 1050 hr*ng/mL) in 
Muta™Mice.   Therefore, T -1358043 could potentially pose a risk to human subjects by [CONTACT_696774] a secondary malignancy if plasma exposure in humans approaches the levels noted at 15 mg/kg in the Muta™Mice.  The mean T -1358043 AUC values in the Muta™Mouse study at 
the n o observed effect level (5 mg/kg) were approximately 7 times greater than the estimated 
mean steady -state level of T -1358043 formed in patients with CRPC administered the clinical 
dose of 400- mg orteronel PO twice daily (BID) in Study C21003.  
For a complet e discussion of the nonclinical data, please refer to the TAK -700 Investigator’s  
Brochure  (IB) . 
1.2.2. Summary of Clinical Findings  
Based on the clinical development experience to date, the overall risk /benefit of orter onel 
therapy in patients with CRPC is favora ble.  For the most current summary of the studies 
conducted to date, please refer to the current IB . 
The most commonly reported treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in patients enrolled in 
orteronel clinical studies include fatigue, nausea, constipati on, diarrhea, and headache.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_696742]: Orteronel  SCRI  INNOVATIONS STUDY  NUMBER :  BRE 203  
DATE OF PROTOCOL :  Versi on 3.0 30 October  2013 
Page 21 of 80 adverse events  (AEs) associated with androgen -deprivation therapy  and with orteronel can be 
monitored and managed with suppor tive care or dose modification.  
Orteronel has dose -proportional, single -dose and multiple -dose pharmacokinetics (PK).  
Excretion of parent drug and M -I occurs primarily via the kidney.  The steady state PK profile of 
orteronel administered twice daily  allows for fairly consistent inhibition of adrenal androgen and 
testosterone production throughout  the day.  
Review of the available nonclinical pharmacolog y and toxicology findings, the Phase I  clinical 
data in healthy male subjects  and the P hase 1 through 2 clinical data in men with CRPC supports 
the continued clinical development of orteronel for the  treatment of CRPC.  Phase III  clinical 
studies are ongoing to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of orteronel in this population.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Identified and Potential Risks with Orteronel  
Single and multiple doses of orteronel up to [ADDRESS_945533] commonly repo rted TEAEs are fatigue, nausea, 
constipation, diarrhea, and headache.  
Other  identified risks associated with orteronel treatment include : 
• Effects of androgen deprivation 
• Left ventricular eje ction fraction (LVEF) decreased  
• Adrenal insufficiency  
• Compensatory elevated adrenocorticotropic hormone concentrations, which may  result in 
increased mineralocorticoid activity  
• Hepatotoxicity  
• Genotoxicity, that could potentially lead to carcinogenesis and second malignancies  
For a complete discussion of the safety data, please ref er to the current  IB. 
1.3. Rationale for the Study  
To date, there have  been no investigations  of Orteronel  in AR+ patients  with MBC .  However, 
preliminary results of a Phase I study wit h abiraterone acetate (an inhibitor  of adrenal androgen 
synthesis , similar to orteronel ), including  25 patients with MBC  expressing ER+ or ER -/AR+, 
were encouraging and toxicities were manageable  (Basu et al. 2011) .  Although the median time 
on treatment was short for this group of patients with resistance to at least 2 prior hormone 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], two patients (both ER+/AR+) continue d on treatment beyond 11 months  (Basu et al. 
2011).   There are also positive preliminary results in  an ongoing study of bicalutamide, a non-
steroidal anti- androgen that competitively inhibits AR , in patients with ER -/PR-/AR+ tumors 
(Traina et al. 2009, Gucalp et al. 2012).

one of six distinct  subsets of TNBC  identified by [CONTACT_696775]  (Lehmann et al. 2011) .  
In vitro  and in vivo  assays have shown the LAR subtypes to be sensitive to bicalutamide, a potent 
anti-androgen.  Therefore, TNBC patients with AR expression could potentially benefit from 
effective anti -androgen  therapy  like orteronel . 
Substantial evidence therefore suggests  that the AR is a potential therapeutic target in selected 
patien ts with MBC .  Two subsets of  patients  with MBC  will be studied separately  in this study : 
• ER-/PR-/HER2 -/AR+  
• ER+ and/or PR+/AR+  
This tria l will be conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmoni zation 
(ICH) guideline on Good Clinical Practice (GCP) (E6), Title 21 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) parts 50, 54, 56, and 312, and any other applicable local regulator y 
requirements.  
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES

Sections  [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS] give management guidelines for treatment- related Grade 2, 3, and 4 
toxicities.  Subsequent sections present additional detail s regarding management o f specific 
toxicities (Sections  [IP_ADDRESS] through [IP_ADDRESS]).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Grade 3 and 4 Toxicities  
 
Dose modifications for acute renal insufficiency and abnormal liver function tests are pre sented 
separately in Sections  [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS], respectively.  
Grade 4 non -hematologic toxicity: Discontinue orteronel  
Grade 3 toxicities: Grade [ADDRESS_945558] grade.  
After the toxicity has improved to ≤ Grade  1, orteronel  should be restarted with a dose reduction.  
If the Grade 3 toxicity recurs on the reduced orteronel  dose, the drug should be discontinued.  
Dose reduction for a Grade 3 toxicity is permanent; orterone l should not be re -escalated.  Any 
patient who requires a treatment delay of more than [ADDRESS_945559] of the patient.  
Asymptomatic Grade 3 or 4 laboratory findings may not require dose modification (ie, dose hold or reduction) especially if these are not considered to be clinically significant or relat ed to study

DATE OF PROTOCOL :  Versi on 3.[ADDRESS_945560] every 2 weeks until the event is 
resolved or stabilized.  However, the frequency of reassessment should be incr eased as cli nically 
indicated.  
Subsequent dosing of orteronel  should be based on the following guidelines : 
• If the AE grade improves to Grade 0 or 1, re -escalate to the full dose (300 mg BID ).  If 
the intolerable Grade 2 toxicity recurs, the orteronel  dose should be re duced 
permanently . 
• If the AE remains at Grade 2 and is still intolerable after 2 weeks, hold administration of orteronel .  If the AE grade improves to ≤ Grade 1 within 3 weeks, and continued 
treatment is thought to be in the patient’s best interest, orteronel  may be restarted at the 
same (reduced) dose.  
• If the event worsens to ≥ Grade 3, hold orteronel  for 2 weeks followed b y a 
reassessment.  If the AE grade improves to ≤ Grade 1 within 3 weeks, and continued 
treatment is thought to be in the patient’s best interest, orteronel  may be restarted at the 
same (reduced) dose.  
Reassess the AE after [ADDRESS_945561] every 
2 weeks until the event is improved or stabiliz ed.  If the dose has been withheld for 3 weeks, 
orteronel  will be discontinued permanently , unless the treating physician and the Medical 
Monitor  or Study Chair  agree  that continued treatment at the minimum- allowed dose (200 mg 
BID) is in the best interest of the patient. 
6.1.2. Dose Modifications Due to Hematologic Toxicity 
It is not expected that the dose will need to be held or modified due to hematologic toxicity in this study.  If a Grade 1 or 2 hematologic toxicity does occur , hold orteronel  and re -evaluate the 
patient in 1 week.  Absolute neutrophil count and platelets should be monitored weekly until recovery.  If ANC and/or platelets do not recover within 3 weeks  to ≤ Grade 1 , the patient will be 
discontinued from the study . 
6.1.3. Dose Modifications Due to Non -Hematologic Toxicity 
Due to its mechanism of action, treatment with orteronel  may elicit expression of adverse 
reactions typi[INVESTIGATOR_696745] .  Risks associated with androgen 
deprivation include hot flushes, decreased libido, loss of energy, QTc interval prolongation, or mood swings .  Long -term effects of testosterone suppression may also occur, including  effects 
on bone mineral density, muscle  mass, hyperglycemia, or lipid or energy metabolism.  
Adverse events commonly recorded during clinical trials with  orteronel  include fatigu e, nausea 
and vomiting, rash, and worsening hypertension.  P ancreatitis and /or elevated amylase/lipase

[IP_ADDRESS]. Hypertension  
Management of orteronel dosing for different stages of hypertension is  outlined in Table 7 . 
Worsening or new onset hypertension may be part of the natural history of  the patients’ 
hypertensive disease, but may also be related to increased adr enal mineralocorticoid activity as a 
result of increased ACTH secretion induced by [CONTACT_696784]  17-
hydroxylase.  Reduced potassium or increased serum sodium may be additional indicators  of 
increased mineralocorticoid effect.  
If new onset or worsening of established hypertension occurs and the potassium level is 
<3.5 mEq/L  in the absence of other causes such as new diuretic therapy, it suggests a 
orteronel -related mineralocorticoid syndrome.  A plasma renin activity that is undetectable or 
low also suggests such a syndrome rather than a secondary cause.  While addressing either 
underlying factors or compliance with current antihypertensives, dos ing of orterone l should be 
followed a s outlined in Table 7 .

[IP_ADDRESS]. Possible or Suspected Adrenal Insufficiency  
If patients experience adrenal insufficiency, the adrenal insufficiency will  have the more 
nonspecific manifestations of glucocorticoid insufficiency, rather than the more specific 
electrolyte abnormalities of mineralocorticoid insufficiency.  Patients experiencing severe physiological stress (eg,  surgery, severe infection) should be carefully monitored for adrenal 
insufficiency.  Concomitant medications may complicate the pi[INVESTIGATOR_696751], in particular in patients who are on beta -blockers or diuretics.  Concomitant illness such as 
infection might similarly trigger  or worsen symptoms of otherwise mild adrenal insufficiency.  
Grading of adrenal insufficiency, the clinical manifestations associated with the specific grade, and management and dosing modifications of orteronel  are provided in Table 8.  In all cases, 
actions should include a thorough review for other possible causes or contributors to the presenting symptoms (eg, infection, anemia, or newly introduced concomitant medications).

Page 49 of 80 8.1.3. Accountability of Investigational Products  
The Principal Investigator ( or designee) must maintain accountability for all study medication 
recei ved and dispensed during his or her entire participation in the study.  Proper drug 
accountability includes, but is not limited to:  
• Continuously monitoring expi[INVESTIGATOR_696758]  
• Frequently verifying that actual inv entory matches documented inventory  
• Verifying that the drug accountability log is completed for the dru g lot used to prepare 
each dose  
• Verifying that all containers used are d ocumented accurately on the log  
• Verifying that required fields are completed accu rately and legibly  
If any dispensing errors or discrepancies are discovered, SCRI  Innovations  must be notified 
immediately.  
The investigator must maintain a current inventory (drug accountability log) of all study 
medication delivered to the site, inventor y at the site, and patients’ use records.  This log must 
accurately reflect the drug accountability of the study medication at all times.  The log should include all required information as a separate entry for each patient to whom study medication is dispensed.  
The sites should destroy any unused product at the end of the study (or expi[INVESTIGATOR_241548], if any, during the study), per the site's SOPs for doing so.  A certificate of destruction that includes a description of the supplies, quantity destroyed, and method of destruction should be returned to the Sponsor. 
9. RESPONSE EVALUATIONS  AND MEASUREMENTS  
9.1. Definitions  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study  using the RECIST V ersion  1.1 
(Eisenhauer et al. 2009).   Lesions are either measurable or non -measurable using the criteria 
provided below.  The term “evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be used, as it does not provide additional meaning or accuracy.

DATE OF PROTOCOL :  Versi on 3.0 30 October  2013 
Page 50 of 80 9.2. Baseline Eligibility  
Measurable Disease:  Tumor lesions:  Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension 
(longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a 
minimum size of:  
• [ADDRESS_945575] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm).  
• 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_51748] (lesions that cannot be 
accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non -
measurable).  
• [ADDRESS_945576] x -ray. 
 
Skin lesions:   Documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to 
estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Malignant lymph nodes:   To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be >[ADDRESS_945577] scan.  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured 
and followed.  
Non-Measurable Disease:  All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10  mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with >10 - to <15 -mm short axis) as well as truly 
non-measurable lesions.  Lesions considered truly non -measurable include: 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural  or pericardial effusion, inflammatory 
breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses, 
abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_696789].  
Target Lesions:  The most re producible measurable lesions, up to a maximum of 2 lesions per 
organ and 5  lesions in total, representative of all involved organs should be 
identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.   
Target lesions should be selected on the bas is of their size (lesions with the 
longest diameter), should be representative of all involved organs, and in 
addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  Pathological nodes which are defined as measurable and that 
may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion or a short axis of 
>[ADDRESS_945578] scan.  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal 
lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline 
sum diameters.   If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then as noted 
above, only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters 
will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor 
response.  
Non-Target Lesions:  All other lesions should be identified as non- target lesions at baseline.  
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow -up. 
 
9.2.1. Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measure ments should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers.  All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment, as 
per protocol screening requirements.

DATE OF PROTOCOL :  Versi on 3.[ADDRESS_945579] of a treatment.  
 
Clinical Lesions:  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes).  In the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to est imate the size of 
the lesion, is recommended.  
Chest X -ray: Lesions on chest X -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
Conventional CT and MRI:  CT and MRI are the b est currently available and reproducible methods to 
measure target lesions selected for response assessment.  Conventional CT 
and MRI should be performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_945580], abdomen, and 
pelvis.  Head and neck tumors and those of extremities usually require 
specific protocols.  
Ultrasound:  When the primary trial endpoint is objective response, u ltrasound should not 
be used to measure tumor lesions.  It is, however, a possible alternative to 
clinical measurements of superficial palpable lymph nodes, subcutaneous 
lesions, and thyroid nodules.  Ultrasound may also be useful to confirm the 
complete d isappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by [CONTACT_15077].  
Endoscopy and Laparoscopy:  Use of endoscopy and laparoscopy for objective tumor evaluation has not yet been fully and widely validated.  Therefore, use of these techniques for 
o
bjective tumor response should be restricted to validation purposes in 
specialized centers.  Such techniques can be useful in confirming complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained.  
Tumor Markers:  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess  response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper limit of normal, they must normalize for a patient to 
be considered in complete clinical response when all lesions have 
disappeared.  
Cytology and Histology:  Cytology and histology can be used to differe ntiate between PR and CR in 
rare cases (e.g., after treatment to differentiate between residual benign 
lesions and residual malignant lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors).

Page 52 of 80 9.2.2. Response Criteria  
Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all target lesions.   
Partial Response (PR):  
 At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) 
of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD.  
Stable Disease (SD):   
 Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest 
(nadir) sum LD since the treatment started.  
Progressive Disease (PD):   
 At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest (n adir) sum since the treatment 
started, or the appearance of one or more new lesions.  Requires not only 20% increase, but absolute increase of a minimum of 5 mm over sum. 
 
Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of 
tumor markers.  All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in 
size (<10  mm short axis).  
Stable Disease (SD):    
 Persistence of one or more non- target lesions and/or persistence 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD):  
 Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non- target lesions.  When the patient 
also has measurable disease, to achieve “unequivocal 
progression” on the basis of the non- target disease,  there must 
be an overall level of substantial worsening in non- target 
disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in the target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  In gener al, the patient’s best response 
assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.   
Confirmation of response (by [CONTACT_340625] 4 weeks or as specified in the protocol) is 
required for trials in which response rate is the primary endpoint, but is not required in 
randomized trials or trials with primary survival endpoints (i.e., where response is not a primary 
endpoint).

In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue.  
When the evaluation of a CR depends upon this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated by [CONTACT_14239][INVESTIGATOR_14166].  
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions, and the nodes decrease to “normal” 
size (<10 mm), they may still have  a measurement reported on scans.  This measurement should 
be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate progression, should it be based on increase in size of the nodes.  As noted earlier, this means that patients with CR may not have a total sum of “zero” on the eCRF . 
Non-Measurable Disease Only  
When a patient only has non- measurable disease:  this circumstance arises in some trials when it 
is not a criterion of study entry to have measurable disease.  The same general concepts ap ply 
here as noted above, however, in this instance; there is no measureable disease assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in non- measurable disease burden.  Because 
worsening in non- target disease cannot be easily quantified (by [CONTACT_640051]: if all lesions are truly 
non-measurable) a useful test that can be applied when assessing patients for unequivocal 
progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the change in non-measurable disease is comparable in ma gnitude to the increase that would be required to declare 
PD for measurable disease: i.e. an increase in tumor burden representing an additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in measurable lesion).  Examples inclu de an increase in a pleural effusion from ‘trace’ to ‘large’, an increase in 
lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be described in protocols as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’.  If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the pati ent 
should be considered to have had overall PD at that point.  While it would be ideal to have objective criteria to apply non- measureable disease, the very nature of that disease makes it 
impossible to do so; therefore the increase must be substantial.

DATE OF PROTOCOL :  Versi on 3.0 30 October  2013 
Page 54 of 80 10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1. Statistical Design  
This is an open- label multicenter study to be conducted in 2 clinical stages.  All patients will 
receive orteronel  PO at a dose of 300 mg twice daily (BID).  
Lead -in Phase:  The first [ADDRESS_945581] 4 weeks of treatment, and if no prohibitive 
toxicities are  identified, continuous study treatment will begin.  
Continuous Study Treatment:  Patients will continue to be enrolled into their respective  cohorts , 
based on their tumor specificities , to either Cohort 1 (ER -/PR-/HER2 -/AR+) or  Cohort 2 (ER+ 
and/or PR+/AR+ ). 
10.2. Analysis Population  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all patients enrolled in the trial. Screen 
failures will not be included in the ITT population. 
The Safety population will consist of all patients receiving at least one dose of st udy drug . 
10.3. Sample Size Considerations  
Up to 86 patients will be enrolled into this study.  
Sample size computations are as follows  for each patient cohort . 
Cohort 1:   For patients with ER -/PR-/HER2 -/AR+ tumors, the expected response rate with 
standard anti -estrogen therapy is expected to be zero.  Therefore, a response rate of at least 10% 
with orteronel  therapy would indicate activity and would lead to further investigation.  Assuming 
an evaluable population of [ADDRESS_945582] 95% confidence interval (CI) for a hypothesized 
response rate of 11% is (2.4%, 28.6%).  In order to incorporate an early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877], Simon’s two-stage design  is applied  using alpha = 0.10 and power = 0.80 with comparison of the 
hypothesized response rate of 11% versus a conser vative e stimate  of 2%.  Initially,  19 patients  
will be enrolled in this cohort, and if no responses are observed, recruitment to this cohort will stop.  Otherwise, enrollment in C ohort  1 will continue to full accrual of 28 evaluable patients.  
To account f or an unevaluable  rate of 10%, a total of 31 patients will be enrolled in this cohort . 
Cohort 2:   For patients with ER+ and/or PR+/AR+ tumors, published data on exemestane as 
third -line hormonal therapy in postmenopausal women indicate a response rate of 13% and a 
clinical benefit rate (CR, PR , or SD >24weeks) of 30% .  It is hypothesized  that treatment with 
orteronel  in this  patient p opulation will produce similar results.   Assuming an evaluable 
population of [ADDRESS_945583] 95% CI  for a hypothesized  response rate of 14% is (5.8%, 
26.7%).  In order to incorporate an early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877], Simon’s two- stage design is applied using 
alpha = 0.10 and power = 0.80 with comparison of the hypothesized response rate of 14% versus a conservative estimate  of 5.1% .  Initially, 26 patients  will be enrolled in this cohort, and if one 
or no responses are observed, recruitment into this cohort will stop.  Otherwise, enrollment in

Page 55 of 80 Cohort  2 will continue to full accrual of 50 evaluable patients.   To account for an uneval uable  
rate of 10%, a total of 55 patients will be enrolled in this cohort . 
10.4. Planned Interim Analyses  
Based on Simon’s two- stage design, each cohort individually will undergo an interim analysis  
for efficacy . 
Cohort 1: After enrollment of the first [ADDRESS_945584] to this patient population. 
Cohort 2: After enrollment of the first [ADDRESS_945585] to this patient population. 
10.5. Statistical Analyses  
All statistical analyse s will be performed using SAS 9.1.3 or the current version of SAS available 
at the time of analysis.  
In general, data will be listed and/or summarized and tabulated.  Descriptive statistics, such as 
means, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum for continuous variables, and counts and percentages for discrete variables, will be used to summarize data as appropriate.  
10.6. Efficacy Measures  
The primary efficacy endpoint s for both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 are the RR and DCR . 
Secondary efficacy endpoints are P FS and OS.  
Efficacy analyses will include  all patients in  the ITT population. 
10.6.1. Primary Endpoint s 
The RR is defined as the percentage of responders (CR+PR) among those patients who are evaluable for response. Response rate will be presented as the point est imate along with 95% 
confidence intervals calculated using both asymptotic normal approximation and exact binomial methods. 
The DC R is defined as the percentage of patients  who do not exhibit progression (CR+PR+SD ) 
among those patients who are evaluable fo r response  at 6 months .  Disease control  rate will be 
presented as the point estimate along with 95% confidence intervals calculated using both 
asymptotic normal approximation and exact binomial methods.

Page 56 of 80 10.6.2. Secondary Endpoints  
Progression- free survival (PFS)  and OS will be analyzed using Kaplan -Meier methods. Each of 
these endpoints will be presented graphically and further reported using the respective median 
time point estimate along with its 95% CI . 
PFS will be measured from the date of first protocol treatment until the date of objective disease progression or date of death is documented (event), or date of last adequate tumor assessment (censored). If a patient receives non -protocol therapy for the study indication prior to incurring 
an event, the earliest  date of non- protocol treatment recorded will be used (censored). If no post -
treatment tumor assessment has been performed, PFS for the patient will be censored at time zero.  
OS will be measured from the date of first protocol treatment until the date of d eath is 
documented (event), or date last known alive (censored). If a patient receives non- protocol 
therapy for the study indication prior to incurring an event, the earliest date of non- protocol 
treatment recorded will be used (censored).  
10.7. Safety Review  
Treatment -related toxicity is the safety end point.  
All patients who received at least one dose of orteronel  and who had at least one post baseline 
safety assessment will be evaluated for toxicity.  Patients enrolled, but never treated , will not be 
included in any of the safety analyses.  The actual dose and duration in days of orteronel  as well 
as the dose intensity will be listed and summarized by [CONTACT_9086].  Assessment of safety will be based on the frequency of AEs and on the number of labora tory events that fall 
outside of predetermined ranges as assessed by [CONTACT_093].  The incidence of treatment -
emergent AEs  will be summarized by [CONTACT_81517], severity (NCI CTCAE, V ersion 4.0), 
type of AE, and relationship to study drug .  Any ot her pertinent information collected will be 
listed , as appropriate . 
Observed levels and changes from baseline will be examined for the following hormones at scheduled time point asse ssments (baseline, at Cycle 2  Day 1 , Cycle  3 Day 1, and at the End -of-
Treatment Visit): serum estradiol, total and free testoster one, SHBG , ACTH, DHEA- S, and 
cortisol.  
10.8. Biomarkers  
Exploratory analysis will be conducted on archived tumor tissue for  loss of P TEN and PI K3CA  
mutation s (Section  5.2).  
11. SAFET Y REPORT AND ANALYSE S 
11.1. Safety Analyses  
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording proto col-defined AEs  and SAEs; 
measurement of protocol specified hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis variables;

critical to the safety evaluation of the study drug . 
Investigators must report SAEs and follow -up information to their responsible Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) according to the policies of the responsible IRB.  
11.2. Adverse Events  
11.2.1. Definitions of Adverse Events  
An AE  is the development of an undesirable medical condition, or the deterioration of a pre -
existing medical condition following or during exposure to a medicinal product , whether or not 
considered causally related to the product.  
An undesirable medical condition can be symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs 
(e.g.,  tachycardia, enlarged liver) , or the abnormal results of an investigation (e.g., lab oratory 
findings).  
11.2.2. Recording of Adverse E vents  
All AE s of any patient during the course of the trial  will be reported in the case report form, and 
the investigator will give his or her opi[INVESTIGATOR_696759] (i.e., whether the event is related or unrelated to study drug  administration).  If the AE  
is serious, it should be reported immediately to SCRI Innovations Safety Department .  Other 
untoward events occurring in the framework of a clinical trial are also to be recorded as AEs (i.e., AEs that occur prior to assignment of trial treatment that are related to a protocol -mandated 
intervention, including invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout, or no treatment run -in). 
All AEs regardless of seriousness or relationship to orteronel  treatment ( called trial treatment), 
spanning from the initiation of trial treatment, until [ADDRESS_945586] be followed for AEs for 30 calendar days after discontinuation or completion of protocol -specific treatment (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation, oral medications, 
targeted therapy, and surgery).  All new AEs occurring during this period must be reported and followed until resolution unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the AE or laboratory abnormality/ies are not likely to i mprove because of the underlying disease.  In this case, the 
investigators must record his or her reasoning for this decision in the patient’s medical record and as a comment on the eCRF .  After 30  days  of completion of protocol -specific treatment or 
disco ntinuation, only AEs, SAEs, or deaths assessed by [CONTACT_696790].

• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening (Refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of 
death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might 
have caused death, if it were more severe.)  
• Requires at least a 24 -hour in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_696760]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (Disability is defined as a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions .) 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is a medically important event.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may je opardize the patient or may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the previous definition.  These 
should also usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  Progression of malignancy (including fatal outcomes), if documented by [CONTACT_206852] (for example, as per RECIST criteria for solid tumors), should not be reported as an SAE. 
Treatment within or admission to the following facilities is not considered to meet the criteria of 
“in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” (although if any other SAE criteria are met, the eve nt must still be 
treated as an SAE and immediately reported):  
• Emergency Department or Emergency Room  
• Outpatient or same -day surgery units  
• Observation or short -stay unit  
• Rehabilitation facility  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64341]  
• Nursing homes, Custodial ca re or Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696761]: Orteronel  SCRI  INNOVATIONS STUDY  NUMBER :  BRE 203

11.3.2. Serious Adverse Event Reporting by [CONTACT_241573] “serious” and “severe” AE s, as the terms are not 
synonymous.  Severity is a measure of intensity; however, an AE of severe intensity need not 
necessarily be considered serious.  For  example, nausea which persists for several hours may be 
considered severe nausea, but may not be considered an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke which results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered only a mild stroke, but would be considered an SAE.  Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs on the eCRF  and SAEs on the SAE Report Form. 
Adverse events classified by [CONTACT_696791].  Serious AE s 
occurring during the course of the study (spanning from the initiation of orteronel treatment through [ADDRESS_945588] dose of study medication) will be reported by [CONTACT_696792], and are to be recorded in the eCRF .  If 
a patient experiences an SAE after signing the informed consent, but prior to receiving study drug, the event does not need to be recorded as an SAE unless the investigator feels the event may have been caused by a protocol procedure.  The SCRI Innovations Safety Department  must 
be notified of all SAEs, regardless of causality, within [ADDRESS_945589] be reported to the Sponsor as SAEs on the SAE Report and followed until resolution (with autopsy report if applicable). 
Deaths and other SAEs occurring >[ADDRESS_945590] study treatment that are deemed 
‘possibly’ or ‘probably’ related to orteronel  must be reported as SAEs on the SAE Report within 
[ADDRESS_945591] knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_14209] 
(with an autopsy report if available). 
Deaths occurring >[ADDRESS_945592] study treatment and not attributed to study 
treatment (e.g.,  disease progression) need not be reported as SAEs, but simply captured on the 
appropriate eCRF . 
The SAE report should be sent to the SCRI Innovations Safety Department via fax or e- mail 
using the contact [CONTACT_20986]:

The Sponsor  (SCRI  Development Innovations, LLC ) is responsible for reporting relevant SAEs 
to the competent authority, other applicable regulatory authorities, and participating 
investigators, in accordance with ICH guidelines, FDA regulations, and/or local regulatory requirements.  
11.4. Recording of Adverse Events and S erious Adverse Events  
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording AEs or SAEs on 
the SAE Report Forms and AE eCRF .  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. 
All AEs, including those that meet SAE reporting criteria, should b e recorded on the AE eCRF ; 
AEs that meet the definition of an SAE should additionally be reported following the procedures noted in Section 11.3.2. 
11.4.1. Diagnosis versus  Signs and Symptoms  
All AEs should be recorded individually in the patient’s own words (verbatim) unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_696762], the AEs constitute components of a 
recognized condition, disease, or syndrome.  In the latter case, the condition, disease, or syndrome should be named rather than each individual sign or symptom.  If a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded as an AE or SAE as appropriate on the relevant form(s) (SAE Report Form and/or AE eCRF ).  If a diagnosis is subsequently 
established, it should be reported as follow -up information is available.   If a diagnosis is 
determined subsequent to the reporting of the constellation of symptoms, the signs/symptoms should be updated to reflect the diagnosis.  
11.4.2. Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation time points.  Such events should only be recorded once on the SAE Report Form and/or the

DATE OF PROTOCOL :  Versi on 3.0 30 October  2013 
Page 61 of 80 AE eCRF .  If a persistent AE becomes more severe or lessens in severity, it should be recorded 
on a separate SAE Report Form and/or AE eCRF . 
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between pat ient evaluation time  points, and 
subsequently recurs.  All recurrent AEs should be recorded on an SAE Report Form and/or 
AE eCRF . 
11.4.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values  
Any Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities or any clinically significant Grade  1 or 2 hematology 
or biochemistry laboratory value(s) should be recorded as an AE.  If an abnormal laboratory value or vital sign is associated with clinical signs and/or symptoms, the sign or symptom should be reported as an AE, and the associated laboratory value or vital si gn should be considered 
additional information that must be collected on the relevant  eCRF .  If the laboratory 
abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome, only the diagnosis needs to be recorded on the SAE Report Form or AE eCRF . 
11.4.4. Deaths  
For this protoc ol, observation of the clinical  and laboratory AEs produced by [CONTACT_696793] . 
Deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period that are attributed by [CONTACT_206855] “ Study  Discontinuation” 
eCRF .  All other on- study  deaths, regardless of attribution, will be recorded on an SAE Report 
and expeditiously reported to the SCRI Innovations Safety Department . 
When recording a SAE  with an outcome of death, the event or condition that caused or 
contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the SAE 
report and Adverse Event page of the eCRF .  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be 
ascertained at the time of reporting, record “Death NOS” on the eCRF  Adverse Event page.  
11.4.5. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or Surgery 
Any AE that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58170] >24 hours or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_696763].  
There are some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_189433]  (see Section  11.3.2).  
11.4.6. Pre-Existing Medical Conditions  
A pre-existing medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study .  Such conditions 
should be recorded on the General Medical History  eCRF . A pre -existing medical condition 
should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study .  When recording such events on an SAE Report Form and/or 
AE eCRF , it is important to convey the concept that the pre -existing condition has changed by 
[CONTACT_9672]. 
11.4.7. Pregnancy, Abortion, or Birth Defects/Congenital Anomalies  
Pregnancy, abortion, birth defects, and congenital anomalies are events of special interest.  
Please refer to Section  11.5 for specific instructions.

New primary cancers are those that are not the primary reason for the administration of the study treatment and have developed after the inclusion of the patient into the study.  They do not include metastases of the original cancer.  Symptoms of metastasis or the metastasis itself should not be reported as an AE/SAE, as they are considered to be disease progression. 
11.4.9. Lack of Efficacy  
When there is deterioration in the condition for which the study treatment is being used, there 
may be uncertainty as to whether this is lack of efficacy or an AE.  In such cases, unless the Sponsor or reportin g physician considers the study treatment contributed to the deterioration of 
the condition, the deterioration should be considered lack of efficacy and not an AE. 
11.5. Protocol -Defined Events of Special Interest  
The following are events of special interest, an d will need to be reported expeditiously (see 
Section 11.3.1):  
Pregnancy, Abortion, Birth Defects/Congenital Anomalies: 
If a patient becomes pregnant while enrolled in the study, a Pregnancy Form (a paper report 
form) should be completed and faxed to SCRI Innovations Safety Department.  SCRI Innovations Safety Department should be notified expeditiously, irrespective of whether or not it meets the criteria for expedited reporting.  Abortions (spontaneous, acciden tal, or therapeutic) 
must also be reported to SCRI Innovations Safety Department.  
If a female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during the male patient’s participation in this study, this must be reported to the SCRI  Innovations Safety Department immediately .  Every 
effort should be made to follow the pregnancy for the final pregnancy outcome. 
Congenital anomalies/birth defects always  meet SAE criteria, and should therefore be 
expeditiously reported as an SAE, using the previously described process for SAE reporting.  A 
Pregnancy Form should also have been previously completed, and will need to be updated to reflect the outcome of the pregnancy.  
Any of these events will be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance as presented in Section  11.3.[ADDRESS_945596] be reported in the eCRF .  Any accidental or 
intentional overdose with the study treatment that is symptomatic, even if not fulfilling a seriousness criterion, is to be reported to the SCRI  Innovations Safety Department immediately 
(within one day) using the corresponding screens in the eCRF , and following the same process 
described for SAE  reporting  (see Section 11.3.2) if th e overdose is symptomatic . 
An overdose is defined as a dose of orteronel administered to a patient  that is greater than the 
protocol-defined dose for the patient.  There is no experience with clinically significant

symptomatically, as appropriate.  Patients with possible manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may be tre ated acutely with parenteral or oral glucocorticoids as required and/or tolerated. 
11.6. Product Complaints  
A product complaint is a verbal, written, or electronic expression that implies dissatisfaction regarding the identity, strength, purity, quality, or stability of a drug product.  Individuals who identify a potential product complaint situation should immediately contact [CONTACT_128131] (see below) and report the event.

As required by [CONTACT_56812], the Sponsor will ensure all legal aspects are covered, and 
approval of the appropriate regulatory bodies obtained, prior to study  initiation.  If required, the 
Sponsor will also ensure that the implementation of substantial amendment to the proto col and 
other relevant study  documents happen only after approval by [CONTACT_64379].  
12.3. Insurance and Indemnity  
Details of insurance and/or indemnity will be contained within the written agreement between 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_95936]. 
12.4. Informed Consent  
Informed consent is a process by [CONTACT_9444] a subject voluntarily confirms his or her willingness to 
participate in a particular study , after having been informed of all aspects of the study  that are 
relevant to the subject's decision to participate.  Informed consent is documented by [CONTACT_3553] a written, signed, and dated informed consent form. 
The informed consent form  will be submitted for approval to the IRB  that is responsible for 
review and approval of the study .  Each consent form must incl ude all of the relevant elements 
currently required by [CONTACT_1622], as well as local county authority or state regulations  and national 
requirements.  
Before recruitment and enrollment into the study , each prospective candidate will be given a full 
explanation of the study .  Once the essential information has been provided to the prospective 
candidate, and the investigator is sure that the individual candidate understands the implications 
of participating in this study , the candidate will be asked to give consen t to participate in the 
study  by [CONTACT_21006].  A notation that written informed consent has been 
obtained will be made in the patient’s medical record.  A copy of the informed consent form, to include the patient’s signature, will be p rovided by [CONTACT_21007] . 
If an amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study  design or the potential risks to the 
patients, the patient’s consent to continue participation in the study  should be obtained.  
12.5. Confidentiality  
12.5.1. Patie nt Confidentiality  
Confidentiality of patient ’s personal data will be protected in accordance with the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPA A) and national data protection laws, 
as applicable.  HIPA A regulations  require that, in order to participate in the study , a patient must 
sign an authorization from the study  that he or she has been informed of following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from patients in this study ; 
• Who will have access to that info rmation and why;  
• Who will use or disclose that information;

that if the information is disclosed the information may no longer be protected by [CONTACT_696795];  
• The information collected about the research study  will be kept separate from the 
patient’s medical records, but the patient will be able to obtain the research records after the conclusion of the study ; 
• Whether the authorization contains an expi[INVESTIGATOR_320]; and  
• The rights of a research patient to revoke his or her authorization.  
In the event that a patient revokes authorization to collect or use his or her PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collecte d prior to the revocation of patient 
authorization.  For patients that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e., that the patient is alive) at the end of their sch eduled study  period.

he/she has delegated study  duties and should ensure that all persons assisting in the conduct of 
the study  are informed of their obligations.  All persons authorised to make entries and/or 
corrections on the eCR Fs are to be included on this document.  All entries in the patient’s eCRF  
are to be supported by [CONTACT_696799]. 
Source documents are the original documents, data, records and certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_34504], observations a nd activities from which the patient’s eCRF  data are 
obtained. These can include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory, medico -technical department and pharmacy records, diaries, microfiches, ECG 
traces, copi[INVESTIGATOR_014] o r transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate and complete, 
photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X -rays, and correspondence . 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_696764] a comprehensive and 
centrali zed filing system (e.g., regulatory binder or investigator study file [ISF])  of all study -
related (essential) documentation, suitable for inspection at any time by [CONTACT_10574]/or applicable regulatory authorities.  The ISF must consis t of those documents that 
individually or collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of the study  and the quality of the 
data produced.  The ISF should contain as a minimum all relevant documents and correspondence as outlined in ICH GCP Section [ADDRESS_945601], at a minimum, should 
contain PI [CONTACT_2300], date drug shipped/received, date, quantity and batch/code, or lot number for identity of each shipment.  In addition, all original source documents supporting entries in the eCRF  must be maintained and be readily available.

investigational use is discontinued and FDA has been notified of the discontinuation. 
The Investigator shall maintain adequate records of drug disposition, case histories and any other 
study -related records as per [ADDRESS_945604] marketing 
application has been approved by [CONTACT_8415]; or, in the event that the marketing application has not been approved by [CONTACT_8415], for no less than [ADDRESS_945605] shipment / delivery of the drug for investigational use is discontinued and FDA has been notified of the discontinuation. 
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or from the Sponsor or its 
representative, the investigator additionally agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients (sufficient inf ormation to link records e.g., eCRF s and medical records ), all 
original, signed informed consent forms, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_85775] s, SAE Reporting forms, source 
documents, detailed records of treatment disposition, and related essential regulatory documents.  The documents listed above must be retained by [CONTACT_696800] (generally [ADDRESS_945606] marketing approval).   SCRI  Innovations will notify the 
investigator(s)/institutions(s) when th e study -related r ecords are no longer required.  
If the investigator relocates, retires, or for any reaso n withdraws from the study , both SCRI  
Innovations  and its representative should be prospectively notified.  The study  records must be 
transferred to an acceptable designee, such as another investigator, another institution, or to 
Sponsor .  The investigator must obtain the Sponsor’s  written permission before disposing of any 
records, even if retention requirements have been met.  
13.4. Data Collection  
The electro nic CRF  is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  Case report forms 
will be completed using the English language and should be kept current to enable the Sponsor to review the patients’ status throughout the course of the study.  
In order to  maintain confidentiality, only study  number, patient number, initials and date of birth 
will identify the patient in the CRF.  If the patient’s name [CONTACT_75502] 
(e.g.,  laboratory report), it must be obliterated on the copy of the document to be supplied to 
SCRI  Innovations  and replaced instead with the patient number and patient’s initials.  The 
investigator will maintain a personal patient identification list (patient numbers with corresponding patient identifiers) to enable records to be identified and verified as authentic.  Patient data/information will be kept confidential, and will be managed according to applicable local, state, and federal regulations.  
All data requested on the eCRF  must be supported by [CONTACT_64388]’s source 
documentation.  All missing data must be explained.  When a required laboratory test, assessment, or evaluation has not been done or an “Unknown” box is not an option on the eCRF , 
a note should be created verifying that the field was “Not D one” or “Unknown”.  For any entry 
errors made, the error(s) must be corrected, and a note explaining the reason for change should be provided.

a Physical examinations will include measurements of vital signs (resting heart rate, blood  pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_862], oral temperature).  At the baseline visit only, height will also be recorded and weight will be recorded only 
on Day 1 of each cycle.  
b Hematological parameters include the following laboratory tests: complete blood count consi sting of red blood 
cell count (RBCs), hemoglobin, total white blood count (WBC) with differential, and platelet count.  Do not 
repeat on C1D1, if baseline within 72 hours.  
c CMP assessment includes the following laboratory tests:  glucose, BUN, creatinine,  sodium, potassium, chloride, 
calcium, CO2, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), AST, ALT, total bilirubin, total protein, and albumin.  Do not repeat 
on C1D1, if baseline within 72 hours.  
d Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and c -peptide will be drawn at screening,  predose on Day 1 of odd- numbered 
cycles (Cycles 3, 5, 7, etc), and at study completion for patients with a history of diabetes.  
e A single ECG will be obtained at baseline for QTcF interval assessment for all patients.  A single ECG will also be obtained predose on Cycle 3 Day 1 and then every 2nd cycle (Cycles 5, 7, 9, etc).  
f Archived tumor tissue from a primary biopsy or metastatic lesion is required for centralized testing of AR expression.  Patients with AR expression ≥10% will be screened for enrollm ent into the study.  Additional tumor 
tissue, if available from the patients enrolled on study, will be retained to perform c orrelative testing (15 to 20, 
4 um unstained slides).  Patients may enroll based on local laboratory AR assessment, but will need to submit 
tissue for confirmation at the central laboratory.  
g Informed consent must be obtained ≤28 days prior to the initiation of trial treatment.  The physical examination, ECOG performance status, serum/urine pregnancy test (for women of child -bearing potential only), and 
complete blood counts (CBCs) should be done ≤[ADDRESS_945617] assessment was >[ADDRESS_945618] patient has enrolled on the study.  Patients may be contact[CONTACT_478814].

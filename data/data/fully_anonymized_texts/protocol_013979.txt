Dose, Route, Regimen  Rucaparib [ADDRESS_302878] to follow -up will be replaced. Based on the ABC -
02 trial, PFS was estimated to be 72% and 60% at [ADDRESS_302879] line 
gemcitabine  and cisplatin, similar to the init iation point of our study and PFS was 
51% and 32% at 8 and 10 months, similar to the end of the treatment period for the primary outcome assessment in this trial.  Using a conditional probability argument, combined with the assumption that patient accrual to this study will 
follow an approximate uniform distribution over the 4 to 6 months of primary therapy for the patients accrued, we can accept the average of the PFS estimates 
for each period (4- 6 months (66%) and 8- 10 months (41.5%) ) to correspond to 
our trial time period.  We can then standardize the ABC -02 PFS data so that the 
4-
6 month estimate is 100% and the estimate for 4 months thereafter is 63%.  
For our trial, we hope to improve the PFS rate from 63% for these patients to 
85%.  With our proposed sample size of [ADDRESS_302880] 80% power to detect this difference significantly using a 1- sided test .  
 
  
Protocol UMCC 2018. [ADDRESS_302881] cancer (BTC) develops as a result of malignant transformation of the biliary 
tract mucosa and is anatomically classified as intra- hepatic, extra- hepatic (hilar and 
distal) and gall bladder adenocarcinoma. BTC accounts for 10- 15% of all primary liver 
cancer cases worldwide, and its incidence is rising1.  Advanced BTCs are aggressive 
tumors with median survival time from diagnosis of less than 12 months2, and five -year 
overall survival (OS) of ~5% despi[INVESTIGATOR_116175]3. The options for systemic chemotherapy for 
patients with advanced BTC remain limited with few meaningful improvements over the past decades. Valle et al randomly assigned 410 patients with locally advanced or metastatic BTC to receive gemcitabine with or without cisplatin in the phase III ABC -02 
trial
2. Patients on the gemcitabine cisplatin arm demonstrated an improvement in OS 
(11.7 versus 8.1 months; hazard ratio (HR), 0.64; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.80; p>0.001) as compared to the gemcitabine alone arm. This result established the gemcitabine and 
cisplatin combination as a standard first line regimen for patients with advanced BTC.  
Durable response rates are infrequent  however,  and a substantial number of patient s 
progress quickly.  
1.2 Role of PARP inhibitors in BTC  
DNA damage response (DDR) is a broad term describing several complex pathways 
responsible for repairing damaged DNA. These known pathways include base excision 
repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), mismatch repair (MMR), recombinational 
repair including homologous  recombination (HR) and non- homologous end- joining 
(NHEJ), a nd direct repair mechanisms. BER, NER and MMR are mechanisms 
responsible for repairing single strand breaks (SSB), whereas HR and NHEJ pathways are mechanisms involved in repairing double strand breaks (DSB)
4–7.  
 Poly (ADP ribose) polymerase 1 or PARP1 is an abundant nuclear protein heavily  
involved in the repair of SSB
8. In the presence of SSB, PARP1 binds to the damaged 
DNA, undergoes conformational change and catalyzes the production of PAR which acts as a signal  for rec ruitment of DNA repair factors
9.  Under normal conditions the 
dissociation of PARP1 from DNA is required prior to DNA repair completion. In the 
presence of inhibitors, PARP1 remains bound to SSB generating trapped PARP -DNA 
complexes, thus blocking repair and replication9. Unrepaired SSB can produce 
deleterious DSB at the replication forks.  In replicating cells, DSB are repaired via HR and 
NHEJ pathways. However, in cancer cells that are HR deficient (HRD), repair mechani sms for DSB fall to more error prone NHEJ pathways which can lead to cell 
death
10. Bryant and Farmer separately demonstrated that BRCA1/[ADDRESS_302882], brain, pancreatic and NSCLC
13–20. However, to date, 
HRD signaling and the use of PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_249046].  
 Using whole exome- transcriptome sequencing, our pre -clinical data of 53 patients with 
BTCs revealed 14 pts (26.4%) had biallelic DNA damage repair pathway mutations (ATM, BAP1, MSH2, BRCA1, BRCA2). Of these, 11 had somatic mutations and 3 had germline (MSH2, BRCA1, BRCA2) mutations . Four additional patients were found to 
have mono- allelic mutations with BRCA1 (somatic) , PALB2 (somatic) and ATM (familial) . 
These monoallelic mutations have been shown to increase the risk of cancer development and are involved in DNA DSB repair
21–24. 
 BRCA1 associated protein (BAP1), is a deubiquitinase of histone H2A involved in chromatin remodeling and is recruited to DSB sites. BAP1-/- cells are strikingly sensitive

cell25. 
 
In addition, 8 patients had isocitrate dehydrogenase ( IDH)1 mutations. Pre- clinical data 
with IDH1 mutant cells demonstrates reduced capacity to repair DSBs which renders them highly sensitive to PARP inhibition
26,27. This concept is currently being evaluated in 
clinical trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).   
In total, 26 patients (49%) in our cohort had either biallelic somatic and germline (n=14) 
mutations, or monoallelic somatic or germline (n=4) DDR mutations, or IDH1 mutations (n=8) and may have potentially benefitted from the use of PARPi.  
 Rucaparib is a small oral inhibitor of PARP1, PARP2, and PARP3, currently FDA -
appro ved in patients with ovarian cancer treated with two or more chemotherapy 
regimen
28. A phase  II ARIEL2 trial evaluating the efficacy of rucaparib at [ADDRESS_302883] response in patients harboring germline or somatic BRCA mutations (PFS 12.8 months; 95% CI 9.0- 14.7), reduced response rate in those with 
HRD status by [CONTACT_249067] (PFS 5.7 months; 95% CI 5.3- 7.6), and least 
response in low loss of heterozygosity (PFS 5.2 months; 95% CI 3.6- 5.5)
29. Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_302884], and fatigue. A recent phase III 
clinical trial ARIEL3 of 564 patients demonstrated promising disease control  in patients 
with BRCA mutant ovarian cancer30. Median PFS in BRCA mutant arm was 16.6 months 
(95% 13.4- 22.9) compared to 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4- 6.7) in placebo arm. In patients 
with HRD status, median PFS was 13.6 months (95% CI 10.9- 16.2) versus 5.4 months 
(95%  CI 5.1- 5.6). Similar adverse events were reported in each arm. Rucaparib is 
currently being evaluated in breast, ovarian , as well as prostate cancer with HRD status 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 
1.[ADDRESS_302885] signal includes 
binding of the T -cell receptor to antigens presented by [CONTACT_22653] (APCs). 
Subsequently, the B7 (CD80, CD86) ligand binds to CD28 which is a co- stimulatory 
receptor. This signaling leads to T -cell proliferation, cytokine release and upregulation of 
the immune response. As a result, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA -4) is 
upregulated and competes with the CD28 receptor for B7 binding. CTLA -4 has higher 
affinity than the CD28 receptor and therefore T -cell response is ultimately down-
regulated. PD -1 is a member of the CD28/CTLA- [ADDRESS_302886] PD -1 that is designed to block the interaction between PD -1 
and its ligands PD -L1 and PD -L2
37. Twenty -three PD -L1 positive patients with advanced 
BTC were enrolled in the KEYNOTE -028 phase 1b trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy.  
Within this cohort of heavily pretreated patients, an ORR of 17.4% (N=4; 95% CI, 5.0-38.8) was demonstrated and an additional 4 patients had stable disease for a disease control  rate of 35%. Adverse events were generally consistent with previously reported 
safety data for pembrolizumab. There were no treatment -related deaths. Five patients, 
including all responders, remained on treatment more than 40 weeks

 anti-PD1 antibody that is currently FDA- approved as a single agent and in combination 
with other agents in multiple solid tumors38–42. There is an ongoing phase II clinical trial 
evaluating the efficacy of single agent Nivolumab in advanced biliary tract cancers 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), the results of which has not been reported yet. Other checkpoint inhibitors currently being investigated in this disease group include combination checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) as frontline therapy.   
1.[ADDRESS_302887] the cells ability to repair 
single strand breaks and also increase frequency of double strand breaks8. Disruption of 
the DNA damage repair pathways results in increased mutational burden, neoantigens43 
and therefore immunogenicity8 (see Figure 1). This provides a rationale for combining the 
use of PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_249047] a checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab. Preclinical data 
using combination rucaparib with anti- PD1/  PD-L1 antibodies resulted in greater survival 
benefit and greater tumor response in BRCA1 null syngeneic model as compared to 
monotherapy44. In a separate study, while the use of PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_249048] -L1 expression, the combination of PARPi [CONTACT_57999] h PD -L1/PD -[ADDRESS_302888] and immune signatures through the use of 
pre-treatment tissue (all sites) as well as on- treatment (for patients at University of 
Michigan) and post -treatment (optional  for patients enrolled at all sites) tumor biopsies. In 
addition, blood will be colle cted as detailed in the schedule of events/study calendar. 
Identification of important biologic subsets of BTC patients (such as DDR, IDH and/or 
immune signatures) that may have clinical efficacy from rucaparib and nivolumab will be 
the overarching goal of  these translational studies  along with developi[INVESTIGATOR_249049]. Biologic readouts for PD -1 and other immune 
response biomarkers will be assessed along with specific markers of tumor infiltrating leukocytes (TILs). Biologic markers and RNA expression will be examined in the context 
of immunologic correlates, tumor biology, and therapeutic efficacy.

b) Whole exome genomic and transcriptomic (RNAseq) analysis for tumor 
biology , DDR and immune signature [CONTACT_249085]  
c) PBMC collection for immune cell subset analysis including serum for

2.4 Endpoints  Assessment  
2.4.1  Primary Endpoint  Assessment : For the intent -to-treat population t he progression-
free survival (PFS) rate will be defined as the proportion of patients alive and 
without radiological or clinical progression (leading to withdrawal from the study)  
at 4 months  and patient replacement as specified in section 5.10 . 
 
2.4.2  Secondary Endpoint  Assessment : Overall response rate (ORR) will be 
determined as per the combined RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_302890] criteria. The 
progression- free survival (PFS) will be defined as time from date of treatment to 
date of radiological or clinical progression (leading to withdrawal from the study), or death from any cause, whichever comes first. PFS1 will be from start of study 
treatment and will be the primary study endpoint. PFS2 will be from start of 1
st 
line platinum therapy. Overall survival (OS) will be defined from the date of treatment  to either date of death or censoring. OS1 will be from start of study 
treatment. OS2 will be from start of [ADDRESS_302891] disease evaluation. Adverse events and 
reportable serious events are  defined by [CONTACT_4690] (NCI Common 
Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 5.0).

4.[ADDRESS_302909] SCREENING AND REGISTRATION PROCEDURE S 
Patient registration for this trial will be centrally managed by [CONTACT_249068] (i.e. the Coordinating Center)  of the University of Michigan Rogel  Cancer Center as 
described below:  
 A potential study subject who has been screened for the trial and who has signed the Informed Consent document will be initially documented by [CONTACT_43887] a Screening and 
Enrollment Log.  
 It is the responsibility of the local site investigator to determine patient eligibility prior to submitting patient registration request to the C oordinating Center . After patient eligibility has been 
determined, a copy of the completed Eligibility Worksheet together with all the pertinent de-identified source documents will be submitted by [CONTACT_249069] C oordinating Center , 
by [CONTACT_249070] -Oncology -[EMAIL_896].    
Protocol UMCC 2018. [ADDRESS_302910] start within  14 calendar  days  of enrollment to the study  
otherwise the patient will be taken off study . Re-screening is allowed.  
 Patients will receive combination therapy with PARP inhibitor Rucaparib and anti -PD1 
antibody Nivolumab. The safety profile of both agents has been previously evaluated individually.

Days  Treatment  Dose  
Day 1 every 2 weeks  Nivolumab  240 mg IV  
Days 1 -28 every  28 days  Rucaparib  600 mg PO BID  
 Rucaparib may be taken with or without food. Patients should take rucaparib doses as close as possible to 12 hours apart, preferably at the same times every day. If a patient misses a dose (i .e., does not take it within 4 hours of the scheduled time), the patient 
should skip the missed dose and resume taking rucaparib with the next scheduled dose Missed or vomited doses should not be made up. Patients may continue treatment for 2 
years in absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  
5.2 Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications  
Any patient who receives treatment on this protocol will be evaluable for toxicity . Each 
patient will be assessed for the development of toxicity according to the Time and Events 
Table ( Section 6. 2). Toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI Common Terminology  
Crite ria for Adverse Events (CTCAE ), version 5.0. Dose adjustments should be made 
according to the system showing the greatest degree of toxicity .

 If more than one toxicity occurs requiring dose reduction, the dose administered 
should be based on the most severe toxicity.  
 
 Treatment delay of more than [ADDRESS_302911] intended therapy  will result in 
discontinuation from trial, unless  otherwise agreed and documented between the 
investigator and the sponsor.  
 
 If one of the drugs is held or discontinued due to toxicity attributed to that agent, the patient will be allowed to continue the rest of the combination therapy.  
 
 Nivolumab cannot be dose reduced and can only be discontinued as per detailed 
algorithms for immune- therapy toxicity management in Appendix III.  
 
Rucaparib Dose Modification Criteria  
Treatment with rucaparib should be held if any of the following are observed and a dose 
reduction should be considered or implemented.  
• Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity.  Anemia should be managed as described below  
 
• Grade 3 or 4 non- hematologic toxicity (except for alopecia, nausea, vomiting, or 
diarrhea adequately controlled with systemic antiemetic/antidiarrheal medication administered in standard doses according to the study center routines). Grade 3 or Grade 4 ALT/AST elevations should be managed as described below  
 
• In addition, and at the discretion of the investigator, the dose of rucaparib may be held and/or reduced for  unremitting Grade 2 toxicity not adequately controlled by 
[CONTACT_171348]/or supportive care.  
 
• For patients who meet treatment interruption guidelines above, treatment with rucaparib should be held until the toxicity improves to ≤ CTCAE Grade 2. Twice 
daily dosing may then be resumed at either the same dose or a lower dose, 
per investigator discreti on. If treatment is resumed at the same dose, and the 
patient experiences the same toxicity, treatment should be interrupted, then 
resumed at a reduced dose following resolution of the event to ≤ CTCAE Grade 2. If the patient continues to experience toxicity, additional dose reduction steps are permitted; however, the investigator should consult with the sponsor’s medical monitor before reducing to 300 mg BID. If a patient continues to 
experience toxicity despi[INVESTIGATOR_249050] 300 mg BID, or if dosing with 
rucaparib is interrupted for > 21 consecutive days due to toxicity, treatment 
should be discontinued, unless otherwise agreed and documented between the investigator and the sponsor.  
 
Management of Anemia including Evaluation for MDS/AML and Foll ow-up of 
Patients who Discontinue Treatment with Ongoing Anemia:  
• If the patient develops anemia CTCAE Grade ≥ 3, rucaparib treatment should be 
held until the anemia improves to CTCAE Grade ≤ 2 whereupon daily dosing 
may then be resumed at either the same dose or a lower dose, per investigator 
discretion.  
• If the duration of dosing is interrupted for > 21 consecutive days due to anemia 
CTCAE Grade ≥ 3, treatment should be permanently discontinued, unless otherwise agreed and documented between the investigator and the sponsor or 
designee.  
Protocol UMCC 2018. 044 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 17 of 64 
 • In addition, if anemia CTCAE Grade ≥ 3 persists for > 14 consecutive days, or a 
dependence upon blood transfusion occurs, then weekly complete blood counts should be performed until resolution of the event.  
• If, after 42 days  of interruption of rucaparib, the anemia has not improved to 
CTCAE Grade ≤ [ADDRESS_302912] hematologic practice.  
• The bone marrow analysis may include a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] (for cellular 
morphology, cytogenetic analysis, and flow cytometry) and a core biopsy (for bone marrow cellularity).  
 
Management of Rucaparib Treatment- Emergent ALT/AST Elevations:  
• Grade 4 ALT/AST elevations: hold rucaparib until values have improved to Grade 2 or better, then resume rucaparib with a dose reduction. If toxicity is ascribed to nivolumab alone then you may resume without a dose reduction. Monitor liver function tests weekly for 3 weeks after rucaparib has been restarted.  
• Grade 3 ALT/AST elevations, in the absence of other signs of liver dysfunction, should be managed as follows:  
o Monitor liver function tests weekly until improvement to ≤ Grade 2.  
o Continuation of rucaparib with elevation of ALT/AST up to Grade 3 is 
permitted provided bilirubin is < ULN.  
o If patient has Grade 3 ALT/AST elevation and continues on rucaparib, 
and levels do not decline within 2 weeks or they continue to rise, 
treatment interruption and resolution to ≤ Grade 2 will be required before 
rucaparib can be resumed, either at the current dose or at a reduced dose.  
 
Management of Creatinine Elevation:  
• Rucaparib can cause creatinine elevation  of any grade in 92% of the patients 
(1% grade 3- 4) possibly due to potent inhibition of the MATE1, MATE2 -K and 
OCT1 transporters
49. The majority of reported grade 1- 2 creatinine elevations 
stabilize with continued rucaparib treatment without dose modification.  However, 
grade 2 elevation of creatinine can also be due to autoimmune nephritis from nivolumab. To help identify whether rucaparib or nivolumab is the underlying etiology for the creatinine elevation all subjects will undergo repeat CMP on cycle 
1 day 8.  
o Grade 2 creatinine elevation on cycle 1 day 8: Hold rucaparib and re-
check on cycle 1 day 15. If creatinine is improved to grade 1 (< 1.[ADDRESS_302913])  on day 15, then resume rucaparib at full dose.  
o Grade 3- 4 creatinine elevation: Hold rucaparib and consider a dose 
reduction.  
 
Rucaparib Re- treatment Criteria  
Treatment may resume if:  
• ANC ≥ 1.0 x 109/L 
• Platelet count ≥ 75  x 109/L 
• Non- hematologic toxicities have returned to baseline or ≤ CTCAE Grade 1 
severity (or, at the investigator’s discretion, ≤ CTCAE Grade 2 severity if not 
considered a safety risk for the patient). Grade 3 or Grade 4 ALT/AST elevations should be managed as described above.

 Please refer to Appendix  III for algorithm details.  
5.4 Concomitant Medications/Treatments  
The following concomitant medications or treatments are not permitted while the patient is currently receiving therapy on the protocol:  
• Other investigational agents  
• Concurrent radiation  
 
Effect of Other Drugs on Rucaparib  
Rucaparib is primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2D6 and to a lesser extent by [CONTACT_097]1A2 and 
CYP3A4. Caution should be used for concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or 
inducers.  
 
Effect of Rucaparib on Other Drugs  
Rucaparib reversibly inhibits CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP3A, and to a lesser 
extent CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and UGT1A1. It is also a potent inhibitor of MATE1 and 
MATE2 -K, and a moderate inhibitor of OCT1. Caution should be used for concomitant 
use of CYP substrates with narrow therapeutic index  as listed below . 
 
CYP Enzyme  Substrates with Narrow Therapeutic Index  
CYP1A2  Tizanidine, theophylline  
CYP2C9  Warfarin, phenytoin

5.6 Duration of Therapy  
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue for  2 
years until one of the following criteria apply:  
• Disease progression as defined in Section 7.0  
• Inter-current illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)

considers an  inflammatory response (or “pseudo- progression”) as normal.  The main 
difference between RECISTv1.[ADDRESS_302929] progressive disease ( PD) assessment (as per RECISTv1.1) if using immune- related 
RECIST criteria. This PD per RECISTv1.1 is then re- labeled as immune related stable 
disease (irSD) per irRECIST and requires addition of unidimensional measurements of all 
new lesion s (that meet the definition of target lesion) to be added to the sum of longest 
diameters (SLD) calculation for response assessment. Importantly , immune- related 
progression  (irPD) must be confirmed by a follow -up scan at least 4 weeks (within 4 -8 
weeks) following the initial  PD/irSD  assessment  in order to take the patient off the trial .  
 
Subjects that are deemed to have clinical progression and uns table should not be 
continued on therapy after PD (per RECISTv1.1) and are therefore not required to have 
repeat tumor imaging for confirmation as per  irPD definition . It is at the discretion of the 
site investigator whether to continue a subject on study treatment until repeat imaging is obtained. This clinical judgment decision by [CONTACT_43891]’s overall clinical condition, including performance status, clinical  symptoms, and 
laboratory data.  
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_302930] one dose of study therapy will be considered evaluable.  Patients enrolled 
and/or randomized to therapy but that never receive study therapy will be 
replaced.  
 
Evaluable for objective response. All enrolled patients  who have measurable 
disease at registration, receive at least 1 cycle (s) of therapy, and have  their 
disease re- evaluated will be considered evaluable for response. These patients 
will have their response classified according to the definitions stated below . 
(Note:  Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of 
cycle 1 will be considered progressive disease.)  
7.1.[ADDRESS_302931] one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of 
measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
 
• [ADDRESS_302932] scan (irrespective of scanner type) for studies with a slice 
thickness of < 5mm or twice the slice thickness or  MRI 
• 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be 
accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non-measurable)          
• [ADDRESS_302933] X -ray (if clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776])  
                           
All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of   
centimeters).  
 
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be ≥15mm in short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_14216] (CT scan slice  thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At 
baseline and in follow -up, only  the short axis will be measured and followed . 
 Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area will only be 
considered measurable, if they have had subsequent progression by [CONTACT_2669] 5 mm.  
 
Non- measurable disease. All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small 
lesions (longest diameter <[ADDRESS_302934] scan), are considered non-measurable disease. Bone lesions  without measurable soft tissue component , 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmoni tis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed 
by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all non- measurable.  
 
Target l esions . All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ 
and 5 lesions in total should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size ( non-nodal lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all 
involved organ(s), but in addition should be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements.  If a non- nodal lesion is either not present 
or is initially measured with longest  diameter <10mm as a non- target then grows 
to >10mm after baseline, this lesion then becomes a new target lesion as per 
irRECIST  criteria . The non-nodal longest diameter is then added to the sum of 
diameters, and patient response is calculated with the new lesion.  
 
Protocol UMCC 2018. [ADDRESS_302935] 
meet the criterion of a short axis of ≥15mm by [CONTACT_3610]. Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. The short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by [CONTACT_48861] a node is involved by [CONTACT_70188] . Nodal size is normally reported as two dimensions in the plane in which 
the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI 
the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal  or coronal). The smaller of these 
measures is the short axis. For example, an abdominal node which is reported as 
being 20 mm x 30 mm has a short axis of 20mm and qualifies as a malignant,  
measurable node. In this example, 20mm should be recorded as the nodal  
measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥10mm but <15 mm) should be considered non- target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis 
<10mm are considered non -pathological and should not be recorded or followed.  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non- nodal lesions, short axis for nodal 
lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, 
only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum of diameters will be 
used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor  regression in the 
measurable dimension of the disease. If a non- target lymph node grows to 
>15mm after baseline, this node then becomes a new target lesion as per 
irRECIST. The nodal short axis is then added to the sum of diameters, and 
patient response is calculated with the new lesion.  
 
Non- target l esions . All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological 
lymph nodes should be identified as non- target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required, and these lesions should 
be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ (more details to follow). In addition, it is possible to record multiple non- target 
lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the case record form (e.g. 
‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’).  
7.1.3  Guidelines  for Evaluation of Mea surable Disease  
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if 
clinically assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start date and never more than 4 weeks before the 
beginning of  the treatment.  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during subsequent follow -up studies . Imaging- based evaluation should always be done 
rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s)  being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and >10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin 
nodules). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_48863] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is suggested. As noted above, 
when lesions can be evaluated by [CONTACT_249072], imaging 
evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objective and may also be 
reviewed at the end of the study.  
 
CT, MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions  selected for response assessment. This guideline has defined 
measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice 
Protocol UMCC 2018. [ADDRESS_302936] slice thickness greater than 5 
mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice 
thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).  
 
Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not 
be used as a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their  entirety for independent review at a later date and, because 
they are operator dependent, it  cannot be guaranteed that the same technique 
and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next. If new lesions 
are identified by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation by [CONTACT_249073] . If there is concern about radiation exposure  at CT, MRI may be used 
instead of CT in selected instances.  
 Endoscopy, laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor  
evaluation is not advised. However, they can be useful to confirm complete pathological  response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in 
trials where recurrence following complete response or surgical resection is an 
endpoint.  
 Tumor markers: Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor  
response.  
 
7.1.4  Response Criteria  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Prior to the first PD assessment, patients will be evaluated according the 
following RECIST v1.1 response: 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesio ns, 
determined by [CONTACT_43897] 4 weeks apart. There can be no appearance of new lesions.  
 
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the  baseline 
sum LD. There can be no appearance of new lesions.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD 
of target lesions  (with a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm), taking as 
reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, or 
the appearance of one or more new lesions.  
 
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR (taking 
as reference the baseline sum LD) nor sufficient increase to qualify for 
PD (taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment 
started). 
 
After the first PD assessment  per RECISTv1.1 (=irSD per irRECIST) , 
patients will be evaluated for irPD at least 4 weeks apart according to the 
following definition: 
 
Immune- related Progressive Disease (irPD) : At least a 20% increase in 
the sum of the LD of target lesions  (with a minimum absolute increase of 
5 mm), taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, or appearance of new lesions since the last evaluation.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Beyond Progression  
Accumulating evidence indicates a minority of subjects treated with 
immunotherapy may derive clinical benefit despi[INVESTIGATOR_249052] P D. 
 
Subjects will be permitted to continue study treatment beyond initial RECIST v1.1 defined PD, assessed by [CONTACT_093], as long as they 
meet the following criteria:  
 
• Investigator determined clinical benefit  
• Tolerance of study drug  
• Stable performance status  
• Treatment beyond progression will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent serious complications of disease progression (e.g. , CNS 
metastases)  
• Tumor markers are stable/ improving, if expressed 
 A radiographic assessment/ scan should be performed within 4-8 weeks 
of initial investigator -assessed progression to determine whether there 
has been a decrease in the tumor size or continued PD  (termed irPD) . 
The assessment of clinical benefit should be balanced by [CONTACT_249074].  
 If the investigator feels that the subject continues to achieve clinical benefit by [CONTACT_43893], the subject should remain on the trial and continue to receive monitoring according to the Study Calendar (see 
Table 6.2).  
 
For the subjects who continue study therapy beyond progression, further progression is defined as an additional 20% increase in tumor burden 
with a minimum 5 mm absolute increase from time of initial PD. This 
includes an increase in the sum of diameters of all target lesions and/ or 
the diameters of new measurable lesions compared to the time of initial PD. Study treatment should be discontinued permanently upon documentation of further progression  (i.e. irPD) . 
 
7.1.5  Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response: The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded)  
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started).  
 
Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is measured from  the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
7.1.6  Progression -Free Survival  
Progression- free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of 
treatment to time of progression.  
Protocol UMCC 2018. 044

 7.2 Safety/T olerability 
Analyses will be performed for all patients having received at least one dose of study 
drug. The study will use the CTCAE version 5.0  for reporting of non- hematologic adverse 
events ( http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html ).  
 
8.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
8.1 Adverse Event  Reporting Requirements  
Adverse event  (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial  and is 
done  to ensure the safety of s ubjects  enrolled in the studies as well as those who will 
enroll in future studies using similar agents . Data on adverse events will be collected from 
the time of the initial study treatment administration through [ADDRESS_302938]’s participation in the study. Serious Adverse Events 
(SAEs) will continue to be followed until : 
• Resolution or the symptoms or signs that constitute the serious adverse event 
return to baseline;  
• There is satisfactory explanation other than the study treatment for the changes 
observed; or  
• Death.  
The investigator is responsible for the detection, documentation, grading and assignment of attribution of events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE. The definitions of AEs and SAEs are given below . It is the responsibility of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16496].  
Any medical condition or laboratory abnormality with an onset date before initial  study 
treatment administration is considered to be pre- existing in nature. Any known pre-
existing conditions that are ongoing at time of study entry should be considered medical history.  
All events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE, as defined in Section 8.3,  
occurring from the initial study treatment administration through [ADDRESS_302939] be recorded as an adverse event in the patient’s source documents and on the CRF regardless of frequency, severity (grade) or assessed relationship to the study treatment or intervention.  
In addition to new events, any increase in the frequency or severity ( i.e., toxicity grade) of 
a pre- existing condition that occurs after the patient begins study  treatment is also 
considered an adverse event.  
8.2 Definitions  
8.2.1  Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient receiving study treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory or vital sign finding  which requires protocol treatment to be 
modified), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
experimental intervention, whether or not related to the intervention.  
Protocol UMCC 2018. 044 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 29 of 64 
  
• Diagnostic and therapeutic non- invasive and invasive (i.e. , surgical) 
procedures will not be reported as adverse events . However, the medical 
condition for which the procedure was performed must be reported if it meets 
the definition of an adverse event unless it is a pre- existing (prior to protocol 
treatment) condition.  
• Anticipated fluctuations of pre- existing conditions, including the disease 
under study, that don’t represent a clinically significant exacerbation or worsening, are not considered AEs.  
8.2.2  Serious Adverse Event  
An adverse event is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor investigator , it results in any of the following outcomes:  
  o Death  
If death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease should be 
reported as event (SAE) itself.  
 
o A life -threatening adverse event  
An adverse even is considered ‘life- threatening’ if, in the view of either the 
investigator [ or sponsor  investigator ], its occurrence places the patient or 
subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event that, 
had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 
o Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1328] > [ADDRESS_302940] normal life functions  
 
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 
o Important medical event  
Any event that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition 
of “Serious Adverse Event” . Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home;  convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_249053].  
 Events or outcomes not qualifying as SAEs:  
• Previously planned (prior to signing the informed consent form) surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical condition has worsened during the course of the study.  
• Preplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_249054]’s medical history at the time of study enrollment should not be considered SAEs.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16500] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_88291] (for example, for the administration of study therapy or other 
protocol -required procedure) should not be considered SAEs. However, 
if the preexisting condition worsened during the course of the study, it 
should be reported as an SAE . 
Protocol UMCC 2018. 044 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 30 of 64 
 • Events of progression of the patient’s underlying cancer as well as 
events clearly related to progression of the patient’s cancer (signs and symptoms of progression) should not be reported as an SAE unless the outcome is fatal within the safety reporting  period.  
 
8.2.3  Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) 
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver -related laboratory 
abnormalities should occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All 
occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting the defined criteria, must be reported as 
SAEs.  
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as:  
1) AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)  
AND  
2) Total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_302941], without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated 
serum alkaline phosphatase)  
AND  
3) No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre- existing 
chronic or acute liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.  
 
While treatment is interrupted, the patient should be evaluated for the presence of confounding factors including malignant disease in the liver, co- administration 
of other suspect drugs, cholestasis, and viral or autoimmune hepatitis that could have caused the laboratory abnormalities. Other laboratory investigations of liver function such as international normalized ratio (INR) should be implemented as indicated. If no alternative cause is identified, rucaparib must be permanently 
discontinued.  
 
All cases of possible DILI should be followed until all abnormalities have returned 
to normal, returned to baseline levels, or an alternative cause is found to explain the combination of the increased transaminases and total bilirubin.  
 
8.2.[ADDRESS_302942] (AESI)  
AESIs (serious or non- serious) are defined as AEs of scientific and medical 
concern specific to the sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_35348]. Such an event might warrant further investigation in order to 
characterize and understand it. Depending on the nature of the event, rapid 
communication by [CONTACT_50459] (e.g. , regulators) might also 
be warranted.  
 All AESIs must be reported as SAEs  and will be collected throughout the 
subject’s participation in the study . 
 The AESI(s) for this trial are:  
• Myelodysplastic Syndrome and Acute Myeloid Leukemia  
• Pneumonitis  
  
Protocol UMCC 2018. [ADDRESS_302943] be reported to the Coordinating Center within the same ti melines as 
for an SAE.  
 
All pregnancies should be followed through to outcome whenever possible. The 
Coordinating Center should be notified once the outcome of a pregnancy is known.  
 The Coordinating Center will be responsible for reporting pregnancy information to 
the FDA and supporters, as appropriate (outlined below ). 
 
8.2.6  Expected Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is considered “expected” if:  
• For approved and marketed drugs or devices, those adverse events  are 
described in the approved Package Insert (Label).  
• For investigational new drugs or devices, those adverse events are 
described in the FDA Investigator’s Brochure.  
• In clinical research studies, information on expected adverse events is 
also summarized in the protocol and in the consent document .  See 
section 9.[ADDRESS_302944] of expected adverse events related to the drug 
under study.  
8.2.7  Unexpected Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is considered “unexpected” if it is not described in the 
Package Insert, Investigator’s Brochure, in the protocol, or in the informed consent document.  
8.3 Adverse Event  Characteristics  
8.3.1  CTCAE T erm 
(AE description) and grade: The descriptions and grading scales found in the NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.[ADDRESS_302945] access to a 
copy of the CTCAE version  5.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be down 
loaded from the CTEP web site. (http://ctep.cancer.gov
) 
8.3.2  Attribution of the AE  
The investigator or co- investigator is responsible for assignment of attribution.  
Definite  – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
Probable – The AE is like ly related to the study treatment . 
Possible – The AE may be related to the study treatment . 
Unlikely  – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment . 
Unrelated  – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment/intervention.

 8.4 Serious Adverse Event  Reporting Guidelines   
8.4.1  Reporting procedures for multi -site trials  
All serious adverse events (SAEs) and unanticipated problems (UPs), regardless 
of causality to study drug, will be reported to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_249055].   All SAEs and UPs must be reported to the Coordinating 
Center within [ADDRESS_302946] awareness of the event.  Events should be reported using the Coordinating Center’s  SAE form as available in the study database.  A 
copy of the SAE form as available in the study database should be sent to the 
Coordinating Center via fax at 734- 232-0744 or via email to 
CTSU -Oncology -
[EMAIL_896]  within 24 hours of the site’s knowledge of the event.  
 
Follow -up information must also be reported within 24 hours of receipt of the 
information by [CONTACT_093].  
 All SAEs and UPs will be reported to the IRB per current institutional standards.  
 
The Coordinating Center will disseminate information regarding SAEs and UPs to the participating sites within 5 days of review of the information by [CONTACT_5081]’s Principal Investigator (or designee in the event of extended absence) only in the case that the event(s) is believed to be related (i.e., poss ibly, probably, or 
definitely) to the study drug. The Coordinating Center will be responsible for reporting of events to the FDA and supporters, as appropriate (outlined below ). 
8.4.2  Reporting procedures to BMS  
All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) occurring from the initial study treatment administration through [ADDRESS_302947] dose of the study treatment  that are 
believed to be related to study drug will also be reported to BMS Worldwide safety.  
The Coordinating Center will send the initial completed SAE Form within 24  
hours of receipt via email to BMS W orldwide Safety 
([EMAIL_555]
; Fax: 609- 818-3804).   
If only limited information is initially available or an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to the study drug, or if new information becomes available, a follow -up report will be generated and sent to BMS Worldwide Safety 
within 24 hours of receipt.   
8.4.3  Reporting procedures to Clovis  
All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs  and events of pregnancy)  occurring from the 
initial study treatment administration through [ADDRESS_302948]’s participati on in 
the study.  
The Coordinating Center will send the initial completed SAE Form within 24 hours of receipt via email to Clovis ( [EMAIL_4831]
; Fax: 303-
261-8319).   
If only limited information is initially available or an ongoing SAE changes in its 
intensity or relationship to the study drug, or if new information becomes

Assistance Program (MIAP) will assist the Sponsor in submitting SAEs to the FDA that meet the reporting requirements in [ADDRESS_302950] subjects or others at increased risk of harm, but no harm occurs.  
 Upon becoming aware of any incident, experience, or outcome (not related to an adverse event) that may represent an unanticipated problem, the investigator should assess whether the incident, experience, or outcome represents an unanticipated problem . The 
incident, experience or outcomes is considered unanticipated if it meets all of the following criteria:  
 
1. Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency);  
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research; and  
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
than was previously known or recognized.  
If the investigator determines that the incident, experience, or outcome represents an 
unanticipated problem, the investigator must report it to the IRB within 14 calendar days  
of the study team becoming aware of the problem.  
 
8.7 Safety Report Reconciliation  
The Sponsor -Investigator, or designee will reconcile the clinical database SAE reports 
transmitted to BMS Global Pharmacovigilance ( [EMAIL_555]
) and Clovis 
Oncology ( [EMAIL_4831] ).  Frequency of reconciliation should be as 
outlined in the clinical study agreements.  BMS GPV&E will email, upon request from the 
Sponsor -Investigator,  or designee,  the GPV&E reconciliation report.  Requests for 
reconciliation should be sent to [EMAIL_177]  and 
[EMAIL_4831] .  The data elements listed on the reconciliation report 
will be used  for identification purposes.  If the Investigator determines a report was not 
transmitted to BMS GPV&E,  and/or Clovis  the report should be sent immediately as 
appropriate.

9.0 DRUG INFORMATION 
9.1 Rucaparib  camsylate  
9.1.1  Other Names  
Rubraca, CO -338; formerly known as PF -01368338- BW and AG -014447  
9.1.2  Classification  
RUBRACA is a poly (ADP- ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor . 
9.1.3  Mechanism  of Action  
Rucaparib is an inhibitor of poly (ADP -ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes, 
including PARP -1, PARP- 2, and PARP -3, which play a role in DNA repair. In vitro 
studies have shown that rucaparib- induced cytotoxicity may involve inhibition  
of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP- DNA complexes 
resulting in DNA damage, apoptosis, and cell death. Increased rucaparib- induced 
cytotoxicity was observed in tumor cell lines with deficiencies in BRCA1/2 and  
other DNA repair genes. Rucaparib has been shown to decrease tumor growth in 
mouse xenograft models of human cancer with or without deficiencies in BRCA. 
9.1.4  Pharmacokinetics  
All pharmacokinetics of rucaparib were characterized in patients with cancer. Rucaparib demonstrated linear  pharmacokinetics over a dose range from 240 to 
840 mg twice daily with time- independence and dose- proportionality.  The mean 
steady -state rucaparib Cmax was 1940 ng/mL (54% coefficient of variation [CV]) 
and AUC0- 12h was  [ZIP_CODE] h⋅ ng/mL (54% CV) at the approved recommended 
dosage. Accumulation was 3.5 to 6.2 fold. Median terminal half -life (T
1/2) was 17 
hours following a single intravenous dose of 12 to 40 mg rucaparib.  
 
1. Absorption: The median Tmax at steady state was 1.9 hours at the approved recommended dosage (600 mg BID). The mean absolute bioavailability of 
rucaparib immediate release tablet was 36% with a range from 30% to 45%. Following a high- fat meal, the Cmax was increased by 20% and AUC 0- 24h 
was increased by 38%, and Tmax was delayed by 2.5 hours, as compared to 
dosing under fasted conditions.  
 
2. Distribution: Rucaparib had a steady -state volume of distribution of 113L to 
262L following a single intravenous dose of 12 mg to 40 mg rucaparib. In 
vitro, the protein binding of rucaparib was 70% in human plasma at 
therapeutic concentrations. Rucaparib was preferentially distributed to red 
blood cells with a blood- to-plasma concentration ratio of 1.83.  
 
3. Metabolism: In vitro, rucaparib was metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_097]2D6 and to a lesser extent  by [CONTACT_097]1A2 and CYP3A4.  
 
4. Elimination: The mean terminal T
1/2 of rucaparib was 17- 19 hours, following a 
single oral dose of 600 mg rucaparib. The apparent clearance ranged from 15.3 to 79.2 L/hour, following continuous 600 mg rucaparib orally twice daily. 
Protocol UMCC 2018. 044 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 35 of 64 
 The clearance ranged from 13.9 to 18.4 L/hour, following a single 
intravenous dose of rucaparib 12 mg to 40 mg.  
9.1.5  Storage, Preparation and Stability  
Refer to the current FDA- approved package insert for storage, stability and 
special handling information.  Rucaparib is supplied as 200, 250 and 300 mg 
strength tablets . All tablets are provided in high- density polyethylene (HDPE) 
bottles (or equivalent) with child- resistant caps and should be stored in the 
provided containers between 20 °-25° C (68° to 77° F ); excursion permitted 
between 15° to 30° C (59° to 86° F)  (see USP Controlled Room Temperature) . 
Patients may be dispensed 1 or more strengths depending on their current dose 
of rucaparib. The number of bottles of each strength dispensed will be sufficient to supply 28 days of treatment (plus a 2- day overage) until the next rucaparib 
dispensation visit. Bottles containing rucaparib tablets will be labeled according to national regulations for investigational products . 
9.1.6  Dosing and Administration  
See Section 5.1 
 The starting dose of rucaparib as a continually administrated oral monotherapy will be 600 mg twice daily.  
 
Patients may take rucaparib with or without food. Each dose should be taken with 
approximately 8 oz (240 mL) of room temperature water. Tablets should be swallowed whole without crushing or chewing.  
 Patients should take rucaparib doses as close as possible to 12 hours apart, 
preferably at the same times every day. If a patient misses a dose (i .e., does not 
take it within 4 hours of the scheduled time), the patient should skip the missed 
dose and resume taking rucaparib with the next scheduled dose. Missed or 
vomited doses should not be made up.  
 
9.1.7  Availability  
Clovis Oncology will supply the study drug in 200 mg, 250 mg and 300 mg 
tablets with 60 tablets per bottle. 
9.1.8  Handling and Disposal  
Handling and disposal of rucaparib should be per institutional guidelines for the 
handling and disposal of  biologic and cytotoxic agents.  
9.1.9  Adverse  Effects  
1. Side Effects: Refer to the current FDA- approved package insert for the most 
comprehensive and up to date information on adverse reactions. Most 
common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) were nausea, fatigue (including asthenia), vomiting, anemia, abdominal pain, dysgeusia, constipation,  
decreased appetite, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, and dyspnea.  Most 
common laboratory abnormalities (≥ 35%) were increase in  creatinine, 
increase in ALT, increase in AST, decrease in hemoglobin,  decrease in 
lymphocytes, increase in cholesterol, decrease in platelets, and  decrease in 
absolute neutrophil count . The following adverse reactions have been 
identified in < 20% of the 377 patients treated with Rubraca 600 mg twice daily: dizziness (17%), neutropenia (15%), rash (includes rash, rash erythematous, rash maculopapular and dermatitis)  (13%), pyrexia (11%), 
photosensitivity reaction (10%), pruritus (includes pruritus and pruritus

 generalized) (9%), Palmar -plantar  erythrodys esthesia syndrome (2%), and 
febrile neutropenia (1%).  
 
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are considered adverse events of special interest (AESIs), as these events have been observed in patients exposed to cytotoxic chemotherapy (e.g. , platinum 
and anthracyclines) used for treatment of ovarian cancer as well as with PARP inhibitors, includi ng rucaparib. Patients in rucaparib clinical studies 
diagnosed with MDS or AML had significant confounding risk factors including prior cytotoxic chemotherapy, as well as a deleterious BRCA mutation (8, 9). Based on these confounding factors, there is insufficient scientific evidence to conclude that MDS and AML are causally related to rucaparib. Clovis has added these potential risks to all Informed Consent Forms (ICFs) / Patient Information Sheets (PI[INVESTIGATOR_53582]). AESI’s (both serious and 
non-serious) will be reported to Clovis within [ADDRESS_302951] sunlight because they burn 
more easily during treatment with rucaparib. When outdoors, patients should 
use typi[INVESTIGATOR_249058] (sun protection factor 50 or greater) and/or c overing exposed skin with clothing and wearing a hat and 
sunglasses.  
 
2. Pregnancy and Lactation: Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, Rubraca can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug- associated risk. In an animal reproduction study, administration of 
rucaparib to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in embryo- fetal 
death at maternal exposure that were 0.[ADDRESS_302952] -fed infants from Rubraca, 
advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with Rubraca and 
for 2 weeks after the final dose.  
 
3. Drug Interactions:  
Effects of Other Drugs on Rucaparib: In vitro, rucaparib had a low metabolic 
turnover rate in human liver microsomes, and was metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_097]2D6 and to a lesser extent by [CONTACT_097]1A2 and CYP3A4. In vitro, rucaparib was shown to be a substrate of P -gp and BCRP, but not a substrate of renal 
uptake transporters OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2, or hepatic transporters 
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Concomitant treatment with proton pump inhibitors 
has no clinically meaningful change in steady -state exp osures.  
Protocol UMCC 2018. [ADDRESS_302953] of Rucaparib on Other Drugs : Effect of rucaparib on other drugs has 
not been studied in humans. Rucaparib reversibly inhibited CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A, and to a lesser extent CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and UGT1A1. Rucaparib induced CYP1A2, and down regulated CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 in human hepatocytes at clinically relevant exposures. Rucaparib was a potent inhibitor of MATE1 and MATE2- K, and a moderate 
inhibitor of OCT1. Weak inhibition was observed at ultra- therapeutic 
concentration (300 µM) of rucaparib for MRP4, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1,  
and OAT3. No inhibition was observed for MR P2, MRP3, or BSEP. 
Rucaparib was an inhibitor of BCRP and P -gp efflux transporters with IC50 of 
55 μM and 283 μM, respectively. Rucaparib is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 in 
vivo. Caution should be used for concomitant use of CYP substrates with

9.2 Nivolumab  
9.2.1  Other Names  
  Opdivo, BMS -936558, MDX -1106, ONO -4538  
9.2.2  Classification  
  Immunomodulatory; checkpoint inhibitor  
9.2.3  Mechanism  of Action  
 Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 programmed death 1 (PD -1) immune 
 checkpoint inhibitor antibody that selectively blocks the interaction between PD -
 1, which is expressed on activated T cells, and PD -1 ligand 1 (PD -L1) and 2 (PD -
 L2), which are expressed on immune cells and tumor cells.  
9.2.4  Pharmacokinetics  
1. Distribution: Nivolumab has linear pharmacokinetics after single and multiple dosing within the range 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg. The volume distribution (Vd) 
is 8L. 2.  
2. Elimination: Clearance is independent of dose in the range 0.1 mg/kg to 10 
mg/kg. The total body clearance is 9.5 mL/hr, and the elimination half -life of 
is approximately 26.7 days. Body weight normalized dosing showed approximately constant trough concentrations over a wide range of body 
weights.  
9.2.5  Storage, Preparation and Stability  
Nivolumab is supplied as a sterile solution (Opdivo Intravenous) which comes in 
vials of  100 mg/10 mL (10 mL). Nivolumab vials must be stored at a temperature 
of 2°C to 8° C and should be protected from light. If stored in a glass front 
refrigerator, vials should be stored in the carton (5 vials of 100 mg/10 mL) .

  For details on prepared drug storage and use time of nivolumab under room  
 temperature/light and refrigeration, please refer to the Investigator Brochure 
 section for “Recommended Storage and Use Conditions” and/or pharmacy 
 reference sheets. Briefly, w ithdraw the required volume and transfer into an IV 
 container. Dilute with either NS or D5W to a final concentration of 1 to 10 mg/mL. 
 Mix by [CONTACT_5237]; do not shake.  
 
Care must be taken to assure sterility of the prepared solution as the product 
does not contain any anti- microbial preservative or bacteriostatic agent. N o 
incompatibilities between nivolumab and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), non- PVC/non -
DEHP (di(2 -ethylhexyl)phthalate) IV components, or glass bottles have been 
observed.  
 The administration of undiluted and diluted solutions of nivolumab must be completed within 24 hours of preparation. If not used immediately, the infusion 
solution may be stored up to 24 hours in a refrigerator at 2°- 8°C (36°- 46°F) and 
a maximum of 8 hours of the total 24 hours can be at room temperature (20°-
25°C, 68°- 77°F) and room light. The m aximum 8- hour period under room 
temperature and room light conditions includes the product administration period.  
9.2.6  Dose and Administration  
See Section 5.1  
Nivolumab is to be administered as a 3 0 (± 10 minute) intravenous infusion (or as 
per current standard of care), using a pump with a 0.2 to 1.2 micron in- line filter 
at the protocol -specified dose. It is not to be administered as an IV push or bolus 
injection. At the end of the infusion, flush the line with a sufficient quantity  of 
0.9% sodium chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection.
 
9.2.7  Availability  
[COMPANY_016] (BMS) will provide the study drug.  
9.2.8  Handling and Disposal  
Handling and disposal of nivolumab should be per institutional guidelines for the 
handling and disposal of biologic and cytotoxic agents. Nivolumab disposal will be conducted at individual sites and will not be returned to BMS. Recommended 
safety measures f or preparation and handling of nivolumab include laboratory 
coats and  gloves.

Note: BMS -936558 (Nivolumab, MDX -1106) in combination with other agents 
could cause an exacerbation of any adverse event currently known to be caused by [CONTACT_6767], or the combination may result in events never 
previously associated with either  agent. Adverse events occurring in < 1%, 
post marketing, and/or case reports: Hemophagocyticlymphohistiocytosis, 
rhabdomyolysis and polymyositis have been reported in patients received more than one dose of combination therapy (nivolumab 3 mg/kg and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks) for the treatment of metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma and advanced bladder cancer, respectively.  
 
2. Pregnancy and Lactation: Pregnancy: Adverse events were observed in animal reproduction studies. Nivolumab may be expected to cross the placenta; effects to the fetus may be greater in the second and third trimesters. Based on its mechanism of action, nivolumab is expected to cause fetal harm if used during pregnancy. Women of reproductive potential 
should use highly -effective cont raception during therapy and for at least [ADDRESS_302955] dose of nivolumab.  
 
Lactation: It is not known if nivolumab is excreted into breast milk. Due to the 
potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing infant, the manufacturer recommends women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with nivolumab.  
 
3. Drug Interactions: Nivolumab is not expected to have any effect on 
cytochrome P450 or other drug metabolizing enzymes in terms of inhibition 
or induction, and is, therefore, not expected to induce these types of PK -
based drug interactions. No incompatibilities between nivolumab injection and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), non- PVC/non- DEHP (di(2 -ethylhexyl)phthalate) 
IV components, or glass bottles have been observed.  
 
10.0 CORRELATIVES/ TRANSLATIONAL  STUDIES  
Protocol UMCC 2018. 044

Page 41 of 64 
 We will study the BTC tumor microenvironment through the use of pre- treatment tissue collection 
(at all sites) as well as  on-treatment (for patients at University of Michigan) and post -treatment 
(optional for patients enrolled at all sites ) tumor biopsies. Identification of important biologic 
subsets of BTC patients that may have clinical efficacy from nivolumab and rucaparib will be the 
overarching goal of this translational science. Tumor from core biopsies will be examined 
histologically by [CONTACT_9064] (IHC), immunofluorescence (IF), and RNA analysis. Post-
treatment  biopsy tissue will be separated into sections for paraffin embedding, fresh frozen in 
OTC,  and fresh frozen in RNAlater. Whole genomic DNA will be evaluated for mutational 
analysis ). Biologic readouts for PD -1 and CTLA4 response biomarkers will be assessed along 
with specific markers of tumor infiltrating leukocytes (TILs). TILs and their subsets will be assessed using markers by [CONTACT_4658] (e.g. CD4, CD8, FoxP3 (Treg), CD14 or CD68 (TAMs), CD11c  
(DCs) ).  Response biomarkers will be determined by I HC or IF ( e.g. B7-H1 (PD -1L), CD80, CD86,

and multiplex FACS analysis for T cell subset markers and co- stimu latory/inhibitory markers46 
Biologic markers and RNA expression will be examined in the context of patient efficacy.  
10.1 Tissue Collection Guidelines  (See Laboratory Manual for details)  
  Pre- and Post- treatment (for patient at all sites ex cluding University of Michigan): 
1. Pre-treatment: Screening: 
Formalin -fixed paraffin- embedded (FFPE) diagnostic tumor tissue block(s) is preferred to 
allow IHC and genomic/immune profiling. If not , then up to 20 FFPE 5 micron slides plus 
a H&E sl ide from a core biopsy block will be required for IHC . Procurement of tissue is 
mandatory to complete correlative studies.  
 
2. Post-treatment:  
Tissue should be collected, processed and shipped to University of Michigan as detailed in the lab manual.   
 
 Pre-, On- and Post -treatment (for patients enrolled at University of Michigan):  
1. Pre -treatment: Screening 
2. On- treatment: Cycle [ADDRESS_302956] -treatment: EOT  
 
Please refer to the lab manual for details.  
 
A CLIA certified targeted gene panel will be run on the post -treatment tissue without 
additional cost to the patient and the report will be released to the treating investigator to 
inform future therapy.  
10.2 Blood Collection Guidelines  
Blood samples will be collected at three different time- points for each patient as detailed 
below:  
1. Pre -treatment: Cycle 1 Day 1  
2. On- treatment: Cycle [ADDRESS_302957] -treatment: EOT

11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1 Study Design/Study Endpoints  
This protocol will enroll  patients with advanced u nresectable BTC  who have received at 
least [ADDRESS_302959] dose within 
4 weeks of informed consent. The primary endpoi nt is PFS  rate at 4 months following the 
initiation of study treatment. Secondary endpoints include the calculation of the ORR, 
median PFS  and OS (from start of study treatment and 1st line platinum -based therapy) , 
and the incidence of adverse events.   
11.[ADDRESS_302960] line platinum therapy 
without progression. The sample size of this trial is based on the hypothesis that we will 
improve upon the expected proportion of patients surviving without progression after 4 
months of investigational therapy. We will accrue 32 evaluable patients to this trial.  
Evaluable patients are compliant with study treatment and observed for progression- free 
survival events, progression (requiring study discontinuation), death, or lack of events at 
[ADDRESS_302961] to follow -up (either not 
secondary to toxicity)  will be replaced. Based on the ABC -02 trial, PFS was estimated at 
72% and 60% after [ADDRESS_302962] line gemcitabine and cisplatin, similar to the 
initiation point o f our study.  PFS was 51% and 32% at 8 and 10 months, similar to the 
end of the treatment period for the primary outcome assessment in this trial.  Using a 
conditional probability argument, combined with the assumption that patient accrual to this study will follow an approximate uniform distribution over the 4 to 6 months of primary therapy for the patients accrued, we can accept the average of the PFS estimates for each period (4- 6 months (66%) and 8- 10 months (41.5%) ) to correspond to our trial time 
period.  We can then standardize the ABC -02 PFS data so that the 4- 6 month estimate is 
100% to correspond to the start point for patients in this trial and the estimate for 4 months thereafter, 63% (0.415/0.66).  For our trial, we hope to improve the PFS rate from 63% for these patients to 85%.  With our proposed sample size of [ADDRESS_302963] 80% power to detect this difference significantly, with 5% type [ADDRESS_302964]   
11.3 Study Populations  
The evaluable population for the primary, secondary, and safety endpoints is the intent -
to-treat (IIT) population as defined in section 5.10.  
Protocol UMCC 2018. 044 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 43 of 64 
 11.4 Data Analyses Plans  
The primary endpoint is the progression- free survival proportion measured after 4 months 
of study treatment for patients in the IIT population.  This endpoint is defined as the 
proportion of evaluable patients alive and progression- free after 4 months of study 
treatment in the event of no loss to follow -up and/or early patient discontinuation.  The 
outcome is expected to be observed for each patient.  In the event that either loss to follow -up or early discontinuation occurs  (either not secondary to toxicity), the 4- month 
PFS will be estimated using the product -limit method of Kaplan and Meier.  Follow -up 
time will be defined as time fr om the date of first study treatment (PFS1) and 1
st line 
platinum -based therapy (PFS2) until the date of radiological (as per combined RECIST 
v1.[ADDRESS_302965] criteria) or clinical progression (leading to withdrawal from the study treatment), or loss to f ollow -up due to toxicity or non- compliance with study procedures, 
or death from any cause, whichever comes first. Follow -up time will be censored at the 
date of last disease evaluation. Estimates for the median and 75th percentiles with 95% 
confidence intervals will be reported. In order to adjust for the patient’s exposure to 
primary platinum -based therapy, a secondary analysis will utilize the Cox proportional 
hazards model with exposure time entered as an adjustment covariate as either a 
continuous covariate or as [ADDRESS_302966] study treatment (OS1) and 1
st line platinum -based therapy (OS2) 
until date of death or censoring. ORR will be determined as per the irRECIST guidelines  
for the IIT population. Other safety data (e.g., laboratory safety parameters, vital signs, and new physical examination findings) will be summarized descriptively for the IIT population by  [CONTACT_249076], with exact binomial confidence intervals 
where appropriate. Adverse events will be reported per the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.

maintenance therapy in ovarian cancer (phase 3 ARIEL3 trial; Coleman RL et al. Lancet. 
[ADDRESS_302968] 28;390([ZIP_CODE]):1949- 1961) as a guide, which had a SAE rate of 21% - defined 
as the percentage of patients experiencing at least one SAE during study treatment. In 
addition, the investigation of nivolumab in hepatocellular carcinoma (CHECKMATE -040 
trial; El- Khoueiry AB et al. Lancet. 2017 Jun 24;389([ZIP_CODE]):2492- 2502) had a SAE rate 
of 4%. During the conduct of this proposed study, if we become confident from accum ulating study data that the SAE rate, defined in the same way, involves more than 
30% patients, then we will halt accrual on the trial in order to convene the data safety monitoring board (DSMB). The DSMB will review types and outcome of toxicity events and to recommend study closure or changes that could improve the trial.   
 To operationalize this stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_249061] a Bayesian sequential stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_249062]- binomial relationship between prior expectation of toxicity and 
accumulating toxicity data.  We have used a pessimistic and slightly informative prior, the 
uniform, to suggest that prior to study data we believe the percentage of SAE is equally like between 0 and 100%, with an average of 50%.  If the posterior probability after study data is 80% or greater that the SAE probability per patient is 30% or greater, we will halt the trial.  The following table lists the number of patients accrued and the number of 
patients experiencing an SAE to trigger stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356].  The rule is implemented after 5 
patients are accrued.

 The Sponsor -Investigator (S -I) / Study Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_249063].  
 The Sponsor -Investigator (S -I) / Study Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the Project Manager/Delegate 
will review data and patient safety issues with participating sites per a defined quarterly meeting 
cadence.  Depending on the protocol activity, the meeting cadence may be more frequent. This 
data review meeting may be achieved via a teleconference or another similar mechanism to discuss matters related to:  
 
 Enrollment rate relative to expectations, characteristics of participants  
 Safety of study participants (SAE reporting, unanticipated problems)  
 Adherence to protocol (protocol deviations)  
 Completeness, validity and integrity of study data  
 Retention of study participants  
 Participating sites are required to ensure all pertinent data for the review period are available in the database at the time of the discussion.  
 Participating sites unable to participate in the data review meeting are required to provide written 
confirmation that their site has reviewed the relevant data and patient safety issues for the review 
period and their site’s data are in alignment with the data reported in the database. Written confirmation is to be provided to the Project Manager/Delegate within the timeline requested to retain compliance with monitoring timelines.  
 Documentation of the teleconference or alternate mechanism utilized to review items above is to 
be retained in the Trial Master File.  
 
The Project Manager/Delegate is responsible for collating the data from all participating sites and completing the Protocol Specific Data and Safety Monitoring Report (DSMR) form to document the data review meeting discussion.  
 The DSMR will be signed by [CONTACT_1034] -Investigator (S -I)/Study Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_43864]- Investigat or and submitted to the DSMC on a quarterly  basis for independent

conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that are consistent with Good Clinical 
Practices (GCP) and in compliance with other applicable regulatory requirements.  
 This study will be monitored by a representative of the Coordinating Center  of the University of 
Michigan Rogel  Cancer Center . Monitoring visits will be made during the conduct of the study and 
at study close- out. 
 Prior to subject recruitment, a participating site will undergo site initiation meeting to be conducted by [CONTACT_5081] . This w ill be done as an actual site visit; teleconference, 
videoconference, or web- based meeting after the site has been given access to the study 
database and assembled a study reference binder.  The site’s principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16514]. Study –related questions or 
issues identified during the site initiation meeting will be followed- up by [CONTACT_249079].  
 Monitoring of this study will include both ‘Centralized Monitoring’, the review of source documents 
at the C oordinating Center  and ‘On- site Monitoring’, an actual site visit.  The first ‘Centralized’ 
visit should occur after the first subject enrolled completes first treatment cycle.  The study site 
will send the de- identified source documents to the C oordinating Center  for monitoring.  
‘Centralized’ monitoring may be requested by [CONTACT_941] C oordinating Center  if an amendment requires 
changes to the protocol procedures. The site will send in pertinent de- identified source 
documents, as defined by [CONTACT_941] C oordinating Center  for monitoring.  
 
The first annual ‘On- site’ monitoring visit should occur after the first five study participants are 
enrolled or twelve months after a study opens, whichever occurs first.  The annual visit may be 
conducted as a ‘Centralized’ visit if less than three subjects have enrolled at the study site.  The type of visit is at the discretion of the C oordinating Center.  At a minimum, a routine monitoring 
visit will be done at least once a year, or once during the course of the study if the study duration is less than 12 months. The purpose of these visits is to verify:  
 
 Adherence to the protocol  
 Completeness and accuracy of study data and samples collected  
 Proper storage, dispensing and inventory of study medication  
 Compliance with regulations  
 During a monitoring visit to a site, access to relevant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_249064] C oordinating Center  repres entative conducting the monitoring visit 
to verify consistency of data collected on the CRFs with the original source data.  While most 
patient cases will be selected from patients accrued since the previous monitoring visit, any 
patient case has the potential for review.  At least one or more unannounced cases will be reviewed, if the total accruals warrant selection of unannounced cases.  
 The Coordinating Center  expects the relevant investigational staff to be available to facilitate the 
conduct of the visit, that source documents are available at the time of the visit, and that a 
suitable environment will be provided for review of study -related documents. Any issues identified 
during these visits will be communicated to the site and are expected to be resolved by [CONTACT_16547] 
a timely manner.  For review of study -related documents at the C oordinating Center , the site will 
be required to ship or fax documents to be reviewed.   
 Participating site will also undergo a site close- out upon completion, termination or cancellation of 
a study to ensure fulfillment of study obligations during the conduct of the study, and that the site

These general guidelines constitute guidance to the Investigator and may be supplemented by 
[CONTACT_197316]. The guidance applies to all immuno-oncology agents and regimens.  
 Corticosteroids are a primary therapy for immuno- oncology drug- related adverse events. The oral 
equivalent of the recommended IV doses may be considered for ambulatory patients with low-grade 
toxicity. The lower bioavailability of oral corticosteroids should be taken into account  when switching to 
the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids.

 Appendix IV  Investigator’s Statement  
 
1. I have carefully read this protocol entitled “Phase II Study of PARP inhibitor Rucaparib in 
Combination with Anti -PD-[ADDRESS_302973] Cancer Following Platinum Therapy ”, Version 4.0 dated 11/24/[ADDRESS_302974] this study according to the moral, ethical and scientific principles governing clinical research as set out in the Declaration of Helsinki, the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) as described in 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CF R) and any applicable local 
requirements.  
 
3. I understand that this trial and any subsequent changes to the trial will not be initiated without 
approval of the appropriate Institutional Review Board, and that all administrative requirements of 
the governing body of the institution will be complied with fully.  
 
4. Informed written consent will be obtained from all participating patients in accordance with institutional and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements as specified in Title 21, CFR, Part 50.  
 5. I understand that my signature [CONTACT_12730] (eCRF) indicates that I have carefully reviewed each page and accept full responsibility for the contents thereof.  
 6. I understand that the information presented in this study protocol is confidential, and I hereby

Protocol UMCC 2018. [ADDRESS_302975] the life and well -being of research participants (e.g., to limit exposure to 
COVID -19).  
 
1. COVID -19 Testing:  
a. COVID -19 is not currently being added to the protocol as part of the screening 
requirements, but may be done as part of the clinical assessment, as needed during the 
course of the pandemic.  
b. COVID -19 tests/results will be recorded in the subject’s source documents but will only 
be added as an Adverse / Serious Adverse Event in the eCRF should the test yield a 
COVID -19 positive result.  
c. Per study Supporters [Clovis and Bristol- Myers Squibb] additional reporting requirements, 
it is requested that the Medical Monitor is to be immediately informed in the event that a trial participant exhibits or reports symptoms consistent with COVID -19 (whether or not 
confirmed by a positive test result). Depending on the investigational product being administered and the patient’s clinical presentation, dosing may be withheld, until such time as symptoms resolve. This decision should be made by [CONTACT_7880], determining what 
is the best course of action for the patient, in consultation with the Medical Monitor. In 
some cases, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or Medical Monitor may request a participant be retested before dosing of the investigational product is resumed.  
 
2. Study Visit Schedule:  
a. For individual instances where assessments cannot be made and/or data are not able to be collected, the reasons for failing to obtain the data should be documented (e.g., 
identifying the specific limitation imposed by [CONTACT_4113] -19 leading to the inability to perform 
the prot ocol-specified assessment).  
b. Ongoing participants who are unable or unwilling to attend protocol -specified trial visits 
and procedures, may continue in the trial if the Principal Investigator (PI) deems it appropriate and for as long as the patient continues to consent to participation and where 
patient safety can be monitored.  
c. Where participants cannot be seen at the site or by [CONTACT_249082], the use of telemedicine and adaptation of schedule of assessments can be implemented, where feasible to 
ensure patient safety.  
d. Adjustments to the protocol imaging visit window (8 ±1 week) are permitted by [CONTACT_1034] -Investigator if on- schedule visits are not possible due to COVID -19. 
 
3. Laboratory Assessments: 
a. Pre-Treatment, Cycle 4 Day 1 (UM Only)  & End of Treatment (EOT) biopsy samples will 
be obtained, if applicable/possible, and will be retained at site until further notification.  
b. Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 1 and End of Treatment  blood samples will be obtained if 
possible and will be processed and shipped per the study lab manual.  If the research lab closes and is unavailable to accept samples, this will be communicated out to the study 
team . 
 
4. Study Medications: 
Protocol UMCC 2018. [ADDRESS_302976] been permitted by [CONTACT_249083] 
(Clovis  and Bristol -Myers S quibb) and Sponsor -Investigator.  O ngoing participants who 
are unable or unwilling to attend protocol -specified trial visits and procedures, may 
continue in the trial if the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_249066].  
b. The patient may remain on study without receiving drug for more than 28 days if the drug(s) are held due to COVID -19. 
c. If a patient does not receive investigational regimen (both Nivolumab and Rucaparib) consecutively for [ADDRESS_302977] scan.  
d. Nivolumab or Rucaparib may be held independent of the other drug if drug infusion or intake not considered possible or safe due to COVID -19. 
e. Sites may ship Rucaparib (Oral Medication) with drug diary directly to subjects via an 
overnight, traceable courier .

SYNOPSIS  
Statistics and 
analyses  Primary efficacy analysis : The primary efficacy variable 
is the percent reduction in seizure frequency (average 28 -
day seizure rate) of complex partial and/or secondarily 
generalized and/or simple partial motor seizures during the 
double -blind phase relative to the pretreatment ba seline.  
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be fit to 
the ranked values of the primary efficacy variable. If the 
coefficient of the ranked baseline variable is statistically 
significant, then the final ranked analysis will be 
considered the prim ary analysis. If the baseline coefficient 
is not statistically significant, then a Wilcoxon rank -sum 
test will serve as the primary analysis.  
Secondary Efficacy Analyses : The secondary efficacy 
variable will be the response to treatment, defined as a The primary efficacy endpoint to be evaluated for 
registration in the [LOCATION_002] and the Rest of the World is 
the percent change from the pretreatment baseline phase in 
seizure frequency (average mont hly seizure rate per 28 days) 
of all simple partial motor, complex partial, or secondarily 
generalized seizures compared with the double -blind 
treatment phase. The primary efficacy endpoint to be 
evaluated for registration in the countries of Europe, 
Austr alia, New Zealand, and South Africa is the responder 
rate defined as a 50% or greater reduction during the 
maintenance phase of the double blind period in the seizure 
frequency from baseline.

50% or greater reduction during the double blind phase in 
the seizure frequency from baseline for the ITT subjects. 
The data will be summarized using frequencies and 
percentages. The data will also be analyzed with a logistic 
regression model predicting the pr obability of response. 
Dose level will be the only covariate in the model.  
Other Efficacy and Safety Analyses:  The percentage of 
subjects who become seizure -free (all seizure types) 
during the maintenance phase of the double -blind 
treatment period will als o be analyzed. Responder rates for 
partial seizure subtypes (including simple partial with 
motor component, complex partial, and secondarily 
generalized tonic -clonic seizures) will be summarized. 
Outcome measurements such as quality of life and clinical 
global impression change will be analyzed. Safety will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_5206], severity, and timing of adverse 
events, as well as by [CONTACT_353258], 12 lead 
ECG recordings, vital sign measurements, physical and 
neurologic examinations,  and the Columbia -Suicide 
Severity rating Scale (C -SSRS).  
Open -Label Extension:  The results of the open -label 
extension will be reported using summary tables, figures, 
and data listings. Summaries will be presented for 
demographic information and safety information only.  
Interim Analysis:  An interim analysis will be conducted 
to obta in efficacy and safety information for planning of The primary E fficacy Analysis for United St ates, and the 
Rest of  the World:   
The primary efficacy analysis of the primary endpoint will 
be based on the MITT population.  
The testing strategy for the primary efficacy endpoint is to 
compare each of the YKP3089 dosage groups with the 
placebo group.  Due to multiple treatme nt comparisons, a 
step-down procedure will be used to ensure the overall type I 
error rate is controlled at the 5% level. Each of the YKP3089 
dosage groups will be compared with the placebo group 
according to the following hierarchy:  
1. 200-mg dosage group  versus placebo group  
2. 400-mg dosage group versus placebo group  
3. 100-mg dosage group versus placebo group  
The [ADDRESS_439735] completed or discontinued early from  the double -
blind treatment period will be analyzed.  procedure will proceed to the next step to compare the 400 -
mg dosage group with the placebo group at a 2 -sided 0.05 
level. If a statistically significant difference is detected 
between the 400 -mg dosage group and the placebo group in 
favor of the 400 -mg dosage group, the procedure will 
proceed to the next step to compare the 100 -mg dosage 
group with the placebo group at a 2 -sided 0.05 level.  
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be fit to 
the ranked values of the primary efficacy endpoint. The 
ANCOVA will have terms for ranked baseline seizure rate 
and randomized treatment group.

simple partial motor seizures during the double blind 
treatment period, relative to the pr etreatment baseline 
period. The frequency of seizures will be calculated by [CONTACT_353261] 28, divided by [CONTACT_353262]; in effect, frequency count is 
normalized to 28 days. The percent reduction is calculated 
as 100 * [B -D]/B, where B is the seizure frequency during 
baseline, D is seizure frequency in the double -blind 
treatment period, and reductions in seizure frequency yield 
a positive value.

The baseline rate (B) is calculated by [CONTACT_353263] -missing seizure data and 
then multiplying by 28. The double -blind rate (D) is 
calculated in a similar manner. The percent change is equal 
to 100*(D -B)/B. Simple partial seizures without a 
motor/visual component will not be counted.  
This value will b e undefined if B=0. For the primary efficacy 
analysis, there will not be any baseline values with zero 
seizures. However, for the analysis of seizure sub -types, specific

Analyses of Missing Data  
The primary efficacy endpoint definition in the [LOCATION_002] 
and Rest of the world states that seizure rates will be 
calculated using days with non -missing seizure data.  The 
definition does not explicitly account for days with mi ssing 
data, i.e., days during which the presence or absence of 
seizures was not recorded in personal diaries.  However the 
definition implicitly accounts for missing data in that it is 
identical to a definition in which days with missing data are 
assumed t o have the same seizure rate as days with non -
missing data.    
Similar to the [LOCATION_002] definition of the primary 
efficacy endpoint, the primary endpoint (responder) 
definition in the countries of Europe, Australia, New 
Zealand and South Africa implici tly accounts for missing 
data during maintenance phase in that it is identical to a 
definition in which days with missing data are assumed to 
have the same seizure rate as days with non -missing data. An 
additional analysis will be performed in which subjec ts who 
dropped out during the titration phase will be included in the

from the double -blind treatment period. It will be based on the 
ITT population.  
The primary efficacy variable is percent change in seizure 
frequency per 28 days for the ITT subjects during the double -
blind treatment period relative to the baseline period. Seizure 
frequency will be calculated as the number of seizures during the 
maintenance phase divided by [CONTACT_353268] 28.  
The cumulative distribution func tions for each dose group will 
be presented as a descriptive summary.  
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be fit to the 
ranked values of the primary efficacy variable. If the coefficient 
on the ranked baseline variable is statistically significa nt, then 
the final ranked analysis will be considered the primary analysis. 
If the baseline coefficient is not statistically significant, then a

The primary efficacy variable will be analyzed usin g a 12.5.[ADDRESS_439744] of the World:  
The primary efficacy analysis of the primary endpoint will be based 
on the MITT population.  
The testing strategy for the primary efficacy endpoint (percent 
change  in seizure frequency) is to compare each of the YKP3089 
dosage groups with the placebo group.  Due to multiple treatment 
comparisons, a step -down procedure will be used to ensure the 
overall type I error rate is controlled at the 5% level. Each of the 
YKP3089 dosage groups will be compared with the placebo group 
according to the following hierarchy:  
1. 200-mg dosage group versus placebo group  
2. 400-mg dosage group versus placebo group  
3. 100-mg dosage group versus placebo group  
The [ADDRESS_439745] comparison will be 400 mg/day vs placebo. If 
this test is significant at the 0.05 level, then the next lower dose 
200 mg/day will be compared with placebo. If that t est is also 
statistically significant, the lowest dose 100 mg/day will be 
tested. The sequential testing will stop if a dose fails to be shown 
superior to placebo at the 0.05 level of statistical significance.  placebo group, the procedure will stop and it will be concluded that 
none of the YKP3089 dosages are efficacious. If a statistically 
signifi cant difference is detected between the 200 -mg dosage group 
and the placebo group in favor of the 200 -mg dosage group, the 
procedure will proceed to the next step to compare the 400 -mg 
dosage group with the placebo group at a 2 -sided 0.05 level. If a 
statistically significant difference is detected between the 400 -mg 
dosage group and the placebo group in favor of the 400 -mg dosage 
group, the procedure will proceed to the next step to compare the 
100-mg dosage group with the placebo group at a 2 -sided 0.05 
level.  
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be fit to the 
ranked values of the primary efficacy endpoint. The ANCOVA will 
have terms for ranked baseline seizure rate and randomized 
treatment group. Ties will be handled using the default option in 
SAS. 
It should be noted that the primary efficacy analysis uses a non -
parametric approach. Because of this, effect sizes are not estimated 
and tested directly, since testing is made on the rank of the primary 
efficacy value. However, summary tables for the  actual (not the 
ranked) primary efficacy endpoint will be presented.   
Descriptive results of the primary efficacy end point will be

The testing strategy for the primary efficacy endpoint (responder 
rate) is to compare each of the YKP3089  dosage groups with the 
placebo group. A step -down procedure will be used to ensure the 
type I error rate due to multiple treatment comparisons is controlled 
at the 5% level. Each of the YKP3089 dosage groups will be 
compared with the placebo group accordi ng to the following 
hierarchy:  
1. 200-mg dosage group versus placebo group  
2. 400-mg dosage group versus placebo group  
3. 100-mg dosage group versus placebo group

will be the only covariate in the model.  12.6.1  Secondary Efficacy Analysis in the countries of 
Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa  
The secondary efficacy analysis will be based on the MITT -
M population.  
The secondary efficacy analysis is to compare e ach of the 
YKP3089 dosage groups with the placebo group for the 
percent reduction in seizure frequency.  
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be fit to 
the ranked values of the change in seizure frequency during 
the maintenance phase. The ANCOVA will have terms for 
ranked baseline seizure rate and randomized treatment 
group. Ties will be handled usin g the default option in SAS.  
It should be noted that the efficacy analysis uses a non -
parametric approach. Because of this, effect sizes are not 
estimated and tested directly, since testing is made on the 
rank of the change in seizure frequency. However, summary

subsequently discontinued because of adverse events within 
four weeks of randomization. One of these subjects, a 47 year 
old male with a history of partial epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], head trauma and a 
right hemiparesis, developed significant somnolence and 
ataxia and was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_353218].  
Asymptomatic pulm onary emboli were found incidentally 
during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Two other subjects had study drug 
dose reductions because of adverse events and are continuing 
therapy. The adverse events reported by [CONTACT_353272]3089 
reported in previous studies of YKP3089, including 
somnolence, dizziness and ataxia; however the frequency of 
discontinuation and dose reductions is higher  than initially 
expected.  
Although only a small number of subjects have been exposed 
to the new titration rate, to ensure that the results of this study 
can be interpreted correctly, the titration rate will be modestly 
slowed to provide for better tolerability and potentially fewer 
adverse event dropouts. The initial dose will be reduced t o 
50mg/day and the titration rate will slow to 50mg/day/week 
until 200mg is reached and then the dose will be increased by 
100mg/week in subjects randomized to 400mg/day. If the 
subject experiences tolerability issues during the titration that

Investigator can increa se or decrease the open -label dosage 
by 100 mg if clinically indicated (ie, recurrence of 
seizures, adverse events) during the conversion period.  
 During the first week  of the conversion period, the 
investigator can increase or decrease the open -label dosage 
by 50 -100 mg if clinically indicated (ie, recurrence of 
seizures, adverse events). During the second week of the 
conversion period, the investigator can decrease the  open -
label dosage by 50 -200 mg or increase the open label dosage 
by a maximum of 100 mg if clinically indicated (ie, 
recurrence of seizures, adverse events). All dose 
adjustments must be made  with tablets from the open 
label bottles.   All tablets from the  cards must be taken on 
Week 1 and Week 2 during the conversion period.   
Although the target dose for subjects is 300mg at Visit 11, 
subjects may be taking 50 -400 mg at Visit 11 depending 
upon tolerability and efficacy during the conversion period.  
Doses of concomitant AEDs may be adjusted during the 
conversion phase.

 1 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Name [CONTACT_353314]  A Multicenter, Double -Blind, Randomized, Placebo -Controlled, Dose -
Response Trial of YKP3089 as Adjunctive Therapy in Subjects with 
Partial -Onset Seizures, with Optional Open -Label Extension  
Protocol number  YKP3089C017  
Phase of 
development  Phase 2 b 
Study duration  Baseline phase: 8 weeks  
Double -blind up -titration: 6 weeks  
Double -blind maintenance phase: 12 weeks  
Double -blind crossover to open -label extension: 2 weeks  
Blinded study drug taper: 3 weeks  
Open -label extension phase: Until development is stopped by [CONTACT_353277], or the product is approved for marketing, or any time at the 
discretion of SK Life Science Inc . 
Indication  Partial -onset epi[INVESTIGATOR_353226](s)  Approximately 100 sites (multiple countries)  
Number of 
subjects  [ADDRESS_439813]  3 of these partial seizures during each 
of the two consecutive 4-week periods in the baseline . 
Patients who meet the above seizure criter ia and continue to meet other 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to the treatment .  
Design and 
methodology  This is a multicenter, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled 
dose-response study, with an 8 -week prospective baseline and  an 18 -week 
double -blind treatment period (including a 6 -week titration phase and 
12-week maintenance phase), followed by a 3 -week blinded study drug 
taper period (for subjects leaving the study) or a 2 -week blinded 
conversion period (for subjects who will  participate in the open -label 
extension).  
Subjects who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will first undergo an 
8-week baseline period to assess seizure frequency. During the baseline, 
subjects must have at least [ADDRESS_439814]  3 of these 
partial seizures during eac h of the two consecutive 4-week periods in the 
baseline. Subjects with a high enough seizure frequency will be randomly 
assigned  in a 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_439815] enter a 6 -week titration phase, during which the initial 
dose will be 50mg/day. The planned increase in the daily dose will be 
50mg/day/week  increments until 200mg is reached and after which the 
dose will be increased by 100mg/day/week in subjects randomized to 
400mg/day. Subjects having tolerability  issues for the first time during 
Weeks [ADDRESS_439816] their dose reduced by 50 or100 mg depe nding on 
their attained dose at the time (Reduce by 50mg if taking 100mg, 150mg 
or 200mg; reduce by 100mg if on 300mg or 400mg). Subsequent to this 
reduction, subjects may at the discretion of the investigator, recommence 
the upward titration by [ADDRESS_439817] and 
dose  YKP3089 50 and 100 mg tablets  
Target doses: 100, 200 or 400-mg per day  
Reference 
therapy & dose  Placebo  
Statistics and 
analyses  The primary efficacy endpoint to be evaluated for  registration in the 
[LOCATION_002] and the Rest of the World is the percent change  from the  
pretreatment baseline phase in seizure frequency (average monthly seizure 
rate per 28 days) of all  simple partial motor, complex partial , or 
secondarily generalized seizures compared with the  double -blind 
treatment phase. The primary efficacy endpoint to be evaluated for 
registration in the  countries of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and South 
Africa is the responder rate  defined as a 50%  or greater reduction  during 
the maintenance phase of the double blind period  in the seizure frequency 
from baseline.  
The Primary Efficacy Analysis  for [LOCATION_002] , and the Rest of the 
World :  
The primary efficacy analysis of the primary endpoint will be  based on the 
MITT population.  
The testing strategy for the primary efficacy endpoint is to compare each 
of the YKP3089 dosage groups with the placebo group.  Due to multiple 
treatment comparisons, a step -down procedure will be used to ensure the 
overall t ype I error rate is controlled at the 5% level. Each of the 
YKP3089 dosage groups will be compared with the placebo group 
according to the following hierarchy:  
1. 200-mg dosage group versus placebo group

The testing strategy for the primary efficacy endpoint (responder rate) is 
to compare each of the YKP3089 dosage groups with the placebo group. 
A step -down procedure will be used to ensure the type I error rate due to 
multiple treatment comparisons is cont rolled at the 5% level. Each of the 
YKP3089 dosage groups will be compared with the placebo group 
according to the following hierarchy:

 4 BACKGROUND AND DOSE SELECTION  
4.1 Introduction  
This is a protocol for a human research study. This study is being conducted according to US and 
international stan dards of Good Clinical Practice (GCP ) (Food & Drug Administration [FDA] 
Title 21 Part 312 and Inte rnational Conference on Harmonis ation [ICH] guidelines), applicable 
government regulations , and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
4.[ADDRESS_439825] -generation antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_006] 
(AEDs ) are still commonly used, even though they can produce a diversity o f serious adverse 
events ( SAEs ). New AEDs approved since the early 1990s have shown an improved tolerability 
profile. Nonetheless, approximately 30% of epi[INVESTIGATOR_353232], particularly those with partial 
seizures, are refractory to treatment.  Therefore, the ef ficacy of YKP3089 in this population  is 
worthy of investigation.  
Choice of add -on (adjunctive) design. The initial evaluation of a new antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_353233] a determination of its efficacy in reducing the frequency of seizures in adults who are 
refractory to treatment with other AEDs.2,3,[ADDRESS_439826] failed (note that these may include AED s that subjects are currently 
receiving). Establishing an 8 -week prospective baseline and specifying a minimum of 8 seizures  
during that time (with at least 3 partial seizures during each of the two consecutive 4-week 
period s) and with no more than 25 consecutive days of freedom from seizure s reduces the 
variability in the pretreatment seizure  count and thereby [CONTACT_353278].  
4.3 Background  
4.3.1 YKP3089 Structure  
YKP3089 is (R) -(+)-1-(2-chloro -phenyl) -2-tetrazol -2-yl-ethyl ester, which has the chemical 
formula C 10 H10 Cl N 5. It is a novel small molecule of molecular weight 267.68. Its  structure is 
shown in Figure 1. 
 
Figure 1. Structure of YKP3089  
4.4 Pharmacology  
YKP3089 is a novel small molecule that i s currently in Phase 2 of development as an 
antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_321041] ( IND 76,809).  Nonclinical testing of  YKP3089  suggested a broad spectrum of 
antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_353234], as well as therapeutic potential for treatment of neuropathic pain and 
possible future investigations of treatment of anxiety . The mechanism  of action of  YKP3089  is 
currently unknown . Additional details can be found in the current  YKP3089  Investigator ’s 
Brochure.  
[ADDRESS_439827] preclinical models, as 
described in the current versio n of the Investigator’s  Brochure:  
• The maximal electroshock test, which is used to identify compounds that prevent  seizure 
spread  
• The 6 Hz corneal stimulation model, which is a model of psychomotor seizures and therapy -
resistant epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]  
o The pentylenetetraz ol (PTZ, Metrazol®) test, which is used to identify compounds that 
raise seizure threshold  
• Test for inhibition of seizures provoked by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_353235], which antagonize  
GABA A receptors. Bicuculline can also block Ca2+-activated potassium channels . 
• Test for inhibition of seizures induced by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_1227], potentiated by [CONTACT_353279]. 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_353236].  
No spec ific receptor has been identified as being involved in the mechanism of action of 
YKP3089. In vitro studies of panels of receptors showed no significant activation or inactivation. 
Nor did YKP3089 show significant potential to interact with voltage - or rec eptor -gated channels, 
although some effects on  currents mediated by -aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) were noted. In vitro 
electrophysiology assays showed YKP3089 to be an inhibitor of the inactivated state of sodium 
channels. Thus, the mechanism of antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_353237]3089 is unknown and may be 
novel. Details of these studies can be found in the current version of the Investigator’s  Brochure .  
4.4.[ADDRESS_439828] shown that YKP3089 is well absorbed after oral 
administration under fasting and fed conditions. A single ascending dose study showed that the 
half-life of YKP3089 in human subjects was 50.2 ± 15.0 hours (mean ± SD) for  a 100 -mg oral 
dose, 54.7 ± 16.1 hours for a 200 -mg oral dose, and 60.4 ± 11.[ADDRESS_439829] that YKP3089 is suitable for once -daily oral dosage. Details of these 
preclinical and clinical studies can be found in the cur rent version of the Investigator’s  Brochure.

 Protein binding in human plasma was concentration -independent at the range of 0.114 to  
1.4 µg/mL. The protein -bound fraction in human plasma was 61%, with 39% free fraction . 
[14C] YKP3089 was preferentially boun d to human albumin protein (~66.7%) and not to 1-acid 
glycoprotein.  
A bioavailability study showed that YKP3089 undergoes minimal first -pass metabolism in 
humans. Preclinical studies showed that YKP3089 did not produce any strong inhibitions or 
inductions  of cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) isozymes, UDP -dependent glucuronosyltransferase, or 
phenol sulfate transferase . Studies of the metabolism of YKP3089 showed several possible 
metabolic pathways. However, only the parent compound and the metabolite produced by 
[CONTACT_353280]. This suggests 
limited potential for metabolite toxicity.  
A mass balance study in human subjects indicated limited penetration of YKP3089  and its 
metabolites into cellular elements of blo od. More than 50% of the radioactivity from a 
radiolabeled dose of YKP3089 was excreted in urine and feces within 24 hours; 93% was 
excreted within 312 hours. For more information, see the Investigator’s  Brochure.  
Clinical studies of drug -drug interactions  showed that YKP3089 had no pharmacokinetic 
interaction with divalproex. Co -administration of YKP3089 did produce a 19% decrease in 
exposure to carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] ( CBZ ) plus CBZ  epoxide; however, this decrease was not considered 
clinically relevant. Co -administ ration of YKP3089 with an oral contraceptive (1 mg 
norethindrone and 0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol) showed that the contraceptive had no effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of YKP3089; however, the YKP3089 apparently increased the area under  the 
concentration -time curve from 0 to 24 hours postdose ( AUC 0-24) for norethindrone by 37%. 
Details of the drug -drug interaction studies can be found in the curre nt version of the 
Investigator’s  Brochure.  
4.4.3 Safety Pharmacology and Toxicity Studies  
Details of the preclinical safety and toxicity studies of YKP3089 can be found in the 
Investigator’s  Brochure. The most common AEs in preclinical studies of YKP3089 involved the 
central nervous system  (CNS) . The incidence  and severity of these signs increa sed with

 increasing dose, and the  signs resolved during the recovery periods.  In mice and rats, the median 
neurotoxic dose of YKP3089 was calculated to be between 50 and 350 mg/kg, a dose greater 
than that required to elicit antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_353234] (ie, 3  to 30 mg/kg).  
In a special neurotoxicity safety pharmacology study in cynomolgus monkeys, no evidence of 
drug-induced epi[INVESTIGATOR_353238] 30, 40 , or 60 mg/kg/day administered for 
4 days. Severe toxicity was noted at 40 and 60 mg/kg/day requ iring euthanasia of 1 animal and 
halting of dosing for 3 others before the end of the scheduled 4 days of administration . At 
60 mg/kg/day, myoclonus and/or intention tremors were noted in [ADDRESS_439830] on cardiac (ECG) or circulator y function in monkeys, as measured by 
[CONTACT_63199]. Nor was there evidence of cardiotoxicity in studies of rats or monkeys. YKP3089  at 
doses up to 30 mg/kg had no effect on pulmonary function or cause bronchoconstriction.  
Reproductive toxicity studies showed  adverse effects on reproductive performance when the 
dosage of YKP3089 was high enough to induce maternal toxicity, as evidenced by [CONTACT_353281]. However, there was no evidence of teratogenicity.  
The results of stan dard genotoxicity studies of YKP3089 were negative. No tests of 
carcinogenicity have been conducted.  
4.4.[ADDRESS_439831] been exposed to YKP3089 in 15 completed  (13 Phase 
1, 1 proof -of-concept)  and 1 Phase 2a) .  
In a multiple ascending dose study  in healthy volunteers, when doses of [ADDRESS_439832] in favor of the YKP3089 group, 55% vs 
21%, p<0.0001. Initial efficacy was observed at doses of 50 -100mg/day and maintained 
throughout the 12 week study.  Review of the safety data indicated that 4% of subjects in the 
active and 4% of  subjects in the placebo -group dropped out because of adverse events.  Two -
thirds of subjects completed the study at the target dose of 200mg/day.  The most common 
central nervous system adverse events in the YKP3089 group were somnolence, dizziness, 
fatigue, and gait disorder  
Two suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) occurred  in YKP3089 treated 
subjects :  an early manifestation of a drug hypersensitivity reaction characterized by [CONTACT_353282]

 erythema of palms and soles with mild itching  of ears  and a status epi[INVESTIGATOR_353217] . 
During the open -label extension , 2 notable serious adverse events occurred  in YKP3089 treated 
subjects : one case of sudden unexpected death in epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] ( SUDEP ) and one case of suicide.  
They were considered remotely related or unrelated to study drug.

clinically significant improvement in their seizure frequency only when they started taking a 
daily dose of 100 to 200 mg.  It was concluded that a  dose range of 200 to 400 mg/day  should 
therefore be broad enough to identify effica cious  doses. A [ADDRESS_439834] by 100  mg every 5  to 7 days  to 400 and 500mg/day , and 
generally well tolerat ed the faster titration rate. Therefore, it was initially decided that in the 
current study subjects would  begin with a daily dose of [ADDRESS_439835] 9 subjects randomized  in this 
study, YKP3089C017, was performed. T hree subjects had study d rug dose reduction and 
subsequently discontinued because of adverse events  within four weeks of randomization . One 
of these subjects, a 47 year old male with a history of partial epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], hea d trauma and a right 
hemiparesis, developed significant somnolence and ataxia and was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_353239].  Asymptomatic pulmonary emboli were found incidentally during the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Two other subjects had study drug dose r eductions because of adverse events and 
are continuing therapy. The adverse events reported by [CONTACT_353283]3089 reported in previous studies of YKP3089, including 
somnolence, dizziness and ataxia; howe ver the frequency of discontinuation and dose reductions 
is higher  than initially expected . 
Although only a small number of subjects have been exposed to the new titration rate, to ensure 
that the results of this study can be interpreted correctly, the tit ration rate will be modestly 
slowed to provide for better tolerability and potentially fewer adverse event dropouts. T he initial 
dose will be reduced to 50mg/day and the titration rate will slow to 50mg/day/week  until 200mg 
is reached and then the dose wil l be increased by 100mg/week in subjects randomized to 
400mg/day. If the subject experiences tolerability issues during the titration that require 
intervention by [CONTACT_093], the  study drug dose will be reduced by 50 or 100mg depending 
on the attain ed dose at that time. (Reduce by 50mg if taking 100mg, 150mg or 200mg; reduce by 
100mg if on 300mg or 400mg). The lower dose will be maintained for 7 -13 days and then the 
investigator, at his/her discretion, may recommence an upward titration to the target  dose.  
These changes are being made based on a blinded review of the data and will not impact the 
integrity of this double -blind placebo -controlled dose response study.  
4.[ADDRESS_439836] been exposed to YKP3089 in 15 completed (13 Phase 
1, 1 proof -of-concept and 1 Phase 2a ).  
In the completed  Phase 2a randomized double -blind, placebo -controlled  study in  subjects with  
partial -onset seizures, only [ADDRESS_439837] been related to Y KP3089: an early manifestation of a 
[ADDRESS_439838] 
developed fever, rash, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, and hepatic enzyme and electrolyt e 
abnormalities. The drug was stopped and the signs and symptoms resolved thereafter. This was  
diagnosed  as an antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_353240]3089.  
The incidence of rashes in YKP3089 and placebo treated subjects  in completed  Phase 1 trials and 
in a Phase 2a studies is ap proximately 4% in each group.  
At this time, t he preclinical antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_353222]3089 and the first Phase 2a randomized, 
double -blind, placebo -controlled study suggest  that YKP3089 could provide additional seizure 
control in patients with poorly controlled epi[INVESTIGATOR_353241] .  
5 STUDY OBJECTIVES   
The primary  objective of this study is to determine the effective d ose range of YKP3089  as 
adjunctive therapy for the treatment  of partial seizures .  
The trial will also  evaluate the safety and tolerability of  YKP3089  in the partial epi[INVESTIGATOR_353242].

This is a multicenter, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled  study  with an 8 -week 
prospective baseline  and an 18-week double -blind treatment period  (including a 6-week titration 
phase and 12-week maintenance phase) , followed by a 3-week blinded study drug taper  period 
(for subjects leaving the study) or a blinded 2-week conversion period (for subjects  participating 
in the open -label extension ), with a final follow -up visit [ADDRESS_439839] 8 seizures  
during the baseline period without a seizure -free interval of greater than 25 days  any time during 
those 8 weeks  will be randomly assigned  in a 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_439840] enter a 6 -week titration phase , during which the initial dose will be 50mg/day. 
The planned increase in the daily dose will be 50mg/day/week  increments until 200mg is reached

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Open -Label Extension Treatment Phase  
The initial target dose for the open -label extension will be 300 mg/day. However, if a subject is 
not tolerating the 300 mg/day dose, YKP3089 dose may be reduced to a minimum of 50 mg/day . 
If the investigator feels that a subject requires a dose that is higher than 300 mg/day, the dose can 
be increased to a maximum of 400 mg/day  once the target dose of 300 mg/day was reached. The 
dose adjustments may  occur  in weekly  increments of 100-mg/day or 50-mg/day. However, t he 
rate of change may be more rapid or slow as clinically indicated . No dose reductions are 
permitted if the subject is taking 50 mg/day YKP3089. If 50 mg/day YKP3089 is not tolerated, 
the s ubject will withdraw from  the study. Monotherapy with YKP3089 will not be allowed. The 
investigator may add, remove, or adjust the dosage of concomitant AEDs, as clinically indicated.

taking  100mg, 150mg or 200mg; reduce by 100mg if on 300mg or 400mg) . Subjects will remain 
at the reduced dose level for a minimum of [ADDRESS_439861] or set of cards to be determined by  [CONTACT_10966] . 
For further instruction on dose adjustments, please refer to study manual . 
The initial target dose for the open -label extension will be 300 mg/day. However, if a subject is 
not tolerating the 300 mg/day dose, YKP3089 dose may be reduced to a minimum of 50 mg/day. 
If the investigator feels that a subject requires higher than 300 m g/day, the dose can be increased 
to a maximum of 400 mg/day once the target dose of 300 mg/day was reached. The dose 
adjustments may occur in weekly increments of 100 -mg/day or 50 -mg/day. However, the rate of 
change may be more rapid or slow as clinically indicated. No dose reductions are permitted if 
subject is taking 50 mg/day YKP3089. If 50 mg/day YKP3089 is not tolerated, the subject will

of the World is the percent change from the pretreatment baseline phase in seizure frequency 
(average monthly seizure rate per 28 days) of all simp le partial motor, complex partial, or 
secondarily generalized seizures compared with the double -blind treatment phase.  
The baseline rate (B) is calculated by [CONTACT_353285] e interval with non -missing seizure data and then 
multiplying by 28. The double -blind rate (D) is calculated in a similar manner. The percent 
change is  equal to 100*(D -B)/B. Simple partial seizures without a motor/visual component will 
not be counted.  
This value will be undefined if B=0. For the primary efficacy analysis, there will not be any 
baseline values with zero seizures. However, for the analysis of seizure sub -types, there is a 
possibility that B may be zero. In this case, B will be set to a value of 1. 
6.2.2 Primary Efficacy Endpoint in the countries of Europe, Australia, New Zealand,

 • Hormonal contraception (for at least 3 months prior to Visit 1) in combination with a barrier 
method . Note: Although synthetic progestins a re acceptable , natural progesterone  is not 
acceptable because of a potential drug -drug interaction  with YKP3089 . 
• Intrauterine device (placement at least 3 months prior to Screening  visit)  
• Diaphragm with spermicid e 
• Cervical cap 
• Condoms with contraceptive ge l/foam or cream  
• Surgical sterilization (tubal ligation at least [ADDRESS_439881] 6 months  prior to screening ) 
• Postmenopausal (as defined by [CONTACT_353293] 12 months)  
• Abstinence ; however , if the subject becomes sexually active , [ADDRESS_439882] be

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Packaging  and Labe ling 
For the double -blind phase and the blinded conversion to open -label phase , 50 mg and  100 mg 
YKP3089  and matching placebo tablets will be packaged in  2-panel blister cards —one panel for 
the label and the other for the medication . There will be [ADDRESS_439883] types, one for each of the 
possible daily doses in this study: placebo, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, and [ADDRESS_439884] will be randoml y assigned a unique  medication ID #.

 8.1.2 Blinding of Study Medication  
Study medication will be both double -blind  and open -label . During the double -blind phase , the 
packaging and labeling of the clinical trial medication will maintain the double -blind design of 
the trial. The treatment administered will not be known to the subjects or the study  perso nnel at 
the clinical site. Selected individuals from the Sponsor and/or designee and at the clinical 
research organization ( CRO ) may be unblinded to the study treatments on a need -to-know basis 
as described in the CRO’s standard operating procedures (SOP) on blinding and unblinding. The 
study will be unblinded following database lock according to the CRO’s SOP.  
Neither  the investigator  nor the site staff will know the contents of the tablet s administered ; 
however , this information will be readily available  in the event of an emergency . Investigators 
may perform emergency unblinding using the IWRS system  immediately, without prior contact 
[CONTACT_353276]’s Medical Monitor, if they feel it is medically necessary and that knowledge of the 
treatment assignment is essential for the patient’s care. If such an emergency unblinding is 
necessary, investigators should promptly document and explain to the Medical Monitor or 
Sponsor any premature unblinding of the investigational product.  
The administration of each dose of  study drug or placebo will be identical.  
For the interim analysis and the data monitoring committee ( DMC ) reviews , only the statistician 
and statistical programmer responsible for providing the interim analysis results, key clinical 
members of the interim  analysis committee , and the DMC will be unblinded to the individual 
treatment assignments.  
8.1.3 Supply, Storage, Accountability , and Disposition of Study Medication  
The Sponsor’s manufacturing facility will ship a sufficient supply of study medication to each 
study site directly or from a local depot. The clinical investigator  has the responsibility for 
confirming that all study drug treatment supplies received by [CONTACT_353294]. A  drug receipt log  is to be  filled out and signed by [CONTACT_348078].  It is important that the designated study staff count and verify 
that the shipment contains all the items noted in the shipment inventory. Any damaged or 
unusable study drug in a given shipment (active  drug or comparator) will be documented in the 
[ADDRESS_439885] notify the study S ponsor of any damaged or unusable study 
treatments that were supplied to the investigator ’s site. 
Subjects or their legal representatives must be told to return all original containers  (empty or 
containing study drug ), which will be store d and disposed of according to S ponsor's instructions . 
Subjects or their legal representatives must also be told to keep study drugs in their original 
containers and not to c ombine the contents of different containers.  
All study medication must be kept in a secure, locked area or locked cabin et with access 
restricted to designated study personnel. The tablets  will be stored at room temperature in a dry 
area, protected from lig ht. 
Study personnel will keep accurate records of the study medication dispensed  to and used by 
[CONTACT_353295]'s site monitor during on -site 
monitoring visits . The site monitor will periodically check the supplies of study medication held 
at the site to ensure accountability  of all study medication used throughout the study.  
At the conclusion of the study, a final inventory will be performed. Any discrepancies wi ll be 
investigated, resolved, and documented prior to return to the S ponsor for destruction of  study 
drug that has not been dispensed and study drug that has been dispensed and returned . 
8.2 Randomization and Study Drug Distribution  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Screening Number  
The subject will be assigned a screeni ng number after signing  the informed consent  form . The 
screening  number will be a n 8-digit number in which the first [ADDRESS_439886] will retain the same screening number.

SK Life Science Inc  CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol YKP3089 C017  June 17 , 2019  
Page 97 of 163 
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Randomization Number  
The randomization number will be assigned by [CONTACT_353296]’s country . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Randomization Procedure  
Subjects will be assigned with equal chance to [ADDRESS_439887] biostatistician , at which time the code is broken  and 
disseminated to the clinical study team for statistical analysis and clinical review.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Drug Dispensing  
At each visit, the investigator  will access the IWRS, enter his or her own user ID and PIN, and 
provide requested subject details (eg, subject initials and subject’s date of birth). The IWRS will 
identify blinded blister cards and/or open label bottles of tablets to be dispensed appropriate to 
the phase of study.  
Prior to dispensing, the investigator  will record on each blister card label the subject number, 
study week number, date dispensed, site number, visit number, phone contact, and investigator 
name. The investigator  will record adjacent to Day numbers on the card itself the date on which 
each dose is to be taken. On each dispensed open label bottle, the investigator  will record subject 
number, date dispensed, site number , phone  contact,  and investigator name .  
In addition, t he investigator  will review  the electronic case report form (eCRF) to make sure the 
medication number printed on each card and bottle dispensed  are populated in the system 
correctly . 
Double blind Phase  
[ADDRESS_439888] in the electronic case report 
form (eCRF) the medication number printed on each card dispensed . 
Open-Label  Extension  
If a subject enters the open -label extension, he/she will enter a blinded dose -conversion period. 
At Visit 9, d uring the conversion period, the subject  will receive [ADDRESS_439889] will enter the open -label treatment period and will 
receive  open -label  bottles containing YKP3089 (50- or 100 -mg) tablets at each visit. At each 
visit, the IWRS  system will be accessed  to obtain bottle numbers . The returned bottle s may be 
re-dispensed t o the same subject after drug accountability is performed.  
Dose Adjustments  
If a tolerability issue occurs, all dosage reductions need to be made at a scheduled visit or at an 
unscheduled visit at the discretion of the investigator. At the visit, the subje ct must return all the 
remaining medication cards. The subject will be issued one or more replacement  cards to be 
determined by [CONTACT_63345] (IWRS) .    
[ADDRESS_439890] 
should not be treated with  YKP3089  monotherapy.  Intermittent b enzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] (other than 
diazepam) ma y be taken as rescue medication  once  during the baseline period and twice during 
the treatment phase  (2 doses in a 24-hour period is considered 1 rescue).  Intermittent rescue 
medication can be used during the open -label extension.

9.5 Clinical Laboratory  & Pharmacokinetic  Evaluations   
Clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at Visits 1, 3, 6, 9, 10, 12 , 14, 16, and 17 and 
every 6 months afterwards  or at any time during the study as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_353302] . Samples  will be collected at Visits 1, 3, 9, 
10, 14, 16 and 17 and every 12 months afterwards  for urinalysis. Female subjects (of 
childbearing potential) will undergo a serum ß -hCG pregnancy test at Visits [ADDRESS_439908] at Visits 3 and 9 or at any time pregnancy is suspected .  Additionally, 
blood samples will be drawn to determine plasma levels of concomitant AED  (OXC , TPM , CBZ, 
VPA, LTG , LMD and LEV  only)  prior to study drug administration  (Visit 3)  and during steady -
state concomitant treatment with YKP3089  (Visits 7 and 8). At Visits 7 and 8, additional blood 
samples ( ~8 mL each) will be collected for the determination of YKP3089 plasma levels: the 
first one will be collected upon subjects’ arrival to the study unit; the second one should be 
collected within [ADDRESS_439909] blood draw. Additional blood sample s may be drawn 
for levels of concomitant AEDs during the double -blind treatment phase if the investigator

SK Life Science Inc  CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol YKP3089 C017  June 17 , 2019  
Page 116 of 163 
 believes that symptoms of toxicity may be related to concomitant AEDs, rather than the study 
drug, and  during the open -label extension phase for any r eason; these samples will be analyzed 
by [CONTACT_12082]. Time and date of each blood draw and  dosing records (time/date/dose) of 
YKP3089  and AEDs prior to each blood draw  will be recorded on the CRF.  
All safety laboratory samples will be analyzed by  a central laboratory . Plasma samples will be 
assayed for YKP3089 and AEDs at a specified bioanalytical laboratory using previously 
validated methods. Assay methodology will be detailed in separate assay protocols.  
10 SAFETY AND ADVERSE EVENTS   
10.1 Definitions  
10.1.1  Adverse Events  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness , or experience that develops or worsens in 
severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as 
AEs. Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be AEs if the abnormality:  
• Results in study withdrawal  
• Is associated with an SAE  
• Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• Leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• Is consi dered by [CONTACT_353303]  
10.1.2  Serious Adverse Event 
AEs are classified as serious or non -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
• Fatal  
• Life-threatening  
• Requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly  or birth defect  
2650
SK Life Science Inc  CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol YKP3089 C017  June 17 , 2019  
Page 117 of 163 
 • An important medical event  
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening but are clearly 
of major clinical significance.  They may jeopardize the subject and may require  intervention to 
prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a 
seizure that did not result in in patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , or intensive treatment  of bronchospasm in 
an emergency department w ould typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
10.1.3  Suspected Adverse Reaction  
Suspected adverse reaction  means any AEs for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug cause the AE. For the purpose of investigational new drug ( IND) safety reporting, 
“reasonabl e possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
drug and AE. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than 
adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
All AEs that do no t meet any of the criteria for serious ness should be regarded  as non-serious 
AEs.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_439910] 
administration of study treatment.  
10.1.5  Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the  start of the study.  A preexisting condition 
should be recorded as an AE if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens  
during the study period.  
2651
SK Life Science Inc  CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol YKP3089 C017  June 17 , 2019  
Page 118 of 163 
 10.2 General Physical Examination Findings  
At Screening  and prior to Visit 3, any  clinically  significant abnormality should be recorded as a 
preexisting condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant 
findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an AE must also be recorded  and documented 
as an AE. 
Post-study Adverse Events 
All unresolved AEs should be followed by [CONTACT_145176], the 
subject  is lost to follow -up, or the AE is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled  visit, the 
investigator  should instruct each subject  to report any subseque nt event(s) that the subject , or the 
subject ’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
The investigator  should notify the study Sponsor of any death or AE occurring at any time after a 
subject  has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this 
study.  The S ponsor should also be notified if the investigator  should become aware of the 
development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceive d offspring of a 
subject  who has participated in this study.  
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an AE if any one of the following  
conditions is met:  
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the 
abnormality . 
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity . 
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management  (eg, change of dose, 
discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further diagnostic  
investigation ).

 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , or Surgery  
Any AE that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_214166] a serious AE unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition 
responsible for surgery should be documented  as an AE if the condition meets the criteria for an 
AE. 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery ar e reported  as an 
AE in the following circumstances:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] 
a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an AE if the 
purpose of the surgery  was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful . 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_353251].  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], 
unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_353252] . 
• An Emergency Room visit is not considered hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
10.3 Adverse Event Recording and Assessing  
All AEs occurring during this clinical trial will be recorded. The investigator  will review each 
event and assess its relationship to drug treatment (unrelated, remote, possible, probable , or 
definite). Each sign or symptom reported will be graded on a 3-point  severity scale (mild, 
moderate, or severe), a nd the date of onset, time of onset, and outcome of each event will be 
noted.  
The relationship of each AE to study drug will be assessed using the following definitions : 
Definite  • Distinct temporal relationship with drug treatment  
• Known reaction to agent or  chemical group, or predicted by [CONTACT_7552]  
2653
SK Life Science Inc  CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol YKP3089 C017  June 17 , 2019  
Page 120 of 163 
 • Event cannot be explained by [CONTACT_1130] ’s clinical state or other factors  
Probable  • Reasonable temporal relationship with drug treatment  
• Likely to be known reaction to agent or chemical group, or predicted by 
[CONTACT_25046]  
• Event cannot easily be explained by [CONTACT_1130] ’s clinical state or other factors  
Possible  • Reasonable temporal relationship with drug treatment  
• Event could be explained by [CONTACT_1130] ’s clinical state or other fa ctors  
Remote  • Poor temporal r elationship with drug treatment  
• Event easily explained by [CONTACT_1130] ’s clinical state or other factors  
Unrelated  • Event occurring before dosing  
• Event or intercurrent illness due wholly to factors other than drug treatment  
The following definitions for rating  severity will be used:  
• Mild : The AE is easily tolerated and does not interfere with daily activity . 
• Moderate :  The AE interferes with daily activity, but the subject  is still able to  function . 
• Severe : The AE is incapacitating and requires medical interven tion.

Seizures in this refractory subject population are anticipated with the weekly seizure frequency 
used as a primary study endpoint.  Therefore, seizures, in and of themselves, will not be 
considered adverse events.  Seizures to be considered adverse even ts will include those  occurring 
with a measurable increase over the subject’s typi[INVESTIGATOR_353253]; or multiple 
seizures in a pattern distinguishable  from the usual seizure pattern .

* The SAE report form must be used for reporting.  
At the time of the initial report, the  investigator  should provide as much of the  following 
information as possible : 
• Study identifier  
• Study center  
• Subject  number  
• A description of the event  
• Date of onset  
• Current status  
• Whether study treatment was discontinued  
• The reason why the event is classified as serious  
• Investigator assessment of the association between the event and study treatment  
Within the following [ADDRESS_439912] the understanding of the event . Significant 
new information on ongoing serious AEs should be provided promptly to the study S ponsor.  
10.4.2  Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board Notification by [CONTACT_353307] (including follow -up information) must  promptly  be submitted  to the 
Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board (EC/IRB) . Copi[INVESTIGATOR_16460]/IRB  notification a nd receipt wil l be kept in the c linical investigator ’s 
binder.  
[ADDRESS_439913]  notify the FDA and all participating investigator s in an IND safety 
report of potential serious risks from clinical t rials as soon as possible but in no case la ter than 
15 calendar days after the Sponsor d etermines that the information  qualifies for reporting . This 
includes any suspected adverse reaction that  is both serious and unexpected (S[LOCATION_003]R).  
The study S ponsor must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected 
adverse reaction as soon as possible but no later than 7 calendar days from the Sponsor’s  initial 
receipt  of the information.   
If a previous AE that was not initially deemed r eportable is later found to fit the cri teria for 
reporting, the study S ponsor will submit the AE in a written report to the FDA as soon as 
possible, but no later than [ADDRESS_439914] s may be withdrawn from  the study prior to completion of the study if:  
• Consent is withdrawn by [CONTACT_423]  
• The subject  fails to adhere to the protocol requirements  
• An intolerable AE is experienced  
• The subject  becomes pregnant  
• The subject  is lost to follow -up 
When a subject  is withdrawn , the discharge procedures must be performed. The reason(s) for the 
withdrawal must be d ocumented in the subject ’s eCRF . 
[ADDRESS_439915] (HIPAA).  Those 
regulations require a signed subject  authorization  informing the subject  of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subject s in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who  will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject  to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI  
The subjects will be told that representatives of the Sponsor, IRB/IEC, or regulatory authorities 
may inspect their medical records t o verify the information collected and that all personal 
information made available for inspection  will be handled in strictest confidence  and in 
accordance with local data protection laws . 
In the event that a subject  revokes authorization to collect or us e PHI, the investigator , by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject  
authorization.  For subject s who have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts 
should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (ie , that the subject  is alive) at 
the end of his or her  scheduled study period.  
11.1.2  Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other  
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source 
data are contained in source documents.  Examples of these orig inal documents and data records 
include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097] ; clinical and office charts ; laboratory notes ; memoranda ; subject s’

will be included in a data entry manual . 
11.1.4  Records  Retention  
In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investigator /institution will  maintain all eCRFs 
and all source documents that support the data collected  from each subject, as well as all study 
documents as specified in ICH/GCP  Section 8, Essential  Documents for the Conduct of a 
Clinical Trial, and all  study documents as specified by [CONTACT_8146](s).  
The investigator /institution will take measures to prevent accidental  or premature destruction of 
these documents.  Essential documents must be retained until at least [ADDRESS_439917]. These 
documents will be  retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_353308] S ponsor. It is th e responsibility of  the Sponsor to 
inform the investigator /institution as to when these documents  no longer need to be retained.  
If the responsible investigator  retires, relocates, or for other reasons  withdraws from the 
responsibility of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_13274], custody must  be transferred to a person who will 
accept the responsibility. The Sponsor  must be notified in writing of the name [CONTACT_23877].  Under no circumstance shall the investigator  relocate or dispose of any study  
docume nts before having obtained written approval from the Sponsor . If it becomes necessary 
for the Sponsor  or the appropriate regulatory  authority to review any documentation relating to 
this study, the investigator  must permit access to such reports.

12 STATISTICAL METHODS AND PLANNED  ANALYSES  
12.1 Sample size estimation  
A sample size of 100 subjects per treatment group will provide 80% power to detect a difference 
of 16% in median percent reduction in seizure frequency between an active dosage group and 
placebo group, at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05, assuming a standard deviation of 40%.  
12.[ADDRESS_439918] deviation , and minimum and maximum values. 
SAS® version 9.2 or later will be used for all data summaries, statistical analyses , and data

Protocol YKP3089 C017  June 17 , 2019

 listings. Inferential statistical tests will be 2-sided and will employ a toleran ce for type I error 
(alpha, α ) of 0.05. Data  will be used as collected.  Full details of the analysis plan will be 
included in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) and finalized prior to any un -blinding of efficacy 
data.  
Analyses of Missing Data  
The primary efficacy endpoint definition in the [LOCATION_002] and Rest of the world states that 
seizure rates will be calculated using days with non -missing seizure data.  The definition does 
not explicitly account for days with missing data, i.e., days du ring which the presence or absence 
of seizures was not recorded in personal diaries.  However the definition implicitly accounts for 
missing data in that it is identical to a definition in which days with missing data are assumed to 
have the same seizure r ate as days with non -missing data.    
Similar to the [LOCATION_002] definition of the primary efficacy endpoint, the primary endpoint 
(responder) definition in the countries of Europe, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa 
implicitly accounts for missing data during maintenance phase in that it is identical to a 
definition in which days with missing data are assumed to have the same seizure rate as days 
with non -missing data. An additional analysis will be performed in which subjects who dropped 
out during  the titration phase will be included in the analysis by [CONTACT_353309].  
The same approach will be used for missing data in the analysis of all secondary efficacy end 
points .  
12.3 Analysis  Data Se ts 
For all populations, subjects will be analyzed according to the target (randomized) dosage group 
including subjects who fail to achieve the target dosage during the titration phase . 
Enrolled subjects: All subjects who have given informed consen t to participate in this study will 
be considered enrolled subjects.  
Intention -to-treat (ITT): All randomized subjects will be considered intention -to-treat subjects.

Protocol YKP3089 C017  June 17 , 2019  
Page 128 of 163 
 Modified intention -to-treat (MITT) subjects: All randomized subjects who have taken at least one 
dose of YKP3089 (or placebo) and have any post -baseline  seizure data will be considered 
modified intention -to-treat subjects.   
Modified intention -to-treat (MITT -M) subjects in Maintenance phase: All randomized subjects 
who have completed the titra tion phase and have taken at least one dose of YKP3089 (or 
placebo) in the maintenance phase and have any maintenance phase seizure data will be 
considered modified intention -to-treat subjects in the maintenance phase.   
Per protocol population (PP): All randomi zed subjects who have no major protocol violations 
and have at least 80% drug compliance will be considered per -protocol subjects.  
Safety evaluable subjects (SE): A ll ITT subjects.  
12.4 Baseline Comparability   
All demographic measurements (age, gender, height , and weight ) and all safety measurements  
(ECGs , vital signs , and clinical laboratory values ) will be  summarized by [CONTACT_15994].   
12.[ADDRESS_439919] of the World:  
The primary efficacy analysi s of the primary endpoint will be based on the MITT population.  
The testing strategy for the primary efficacy endpoint  (percent change in seizure frequency)  is to 
compare each of the YKP3089 dosage groups with the placebo group.  Due to multiple treatment 
comparisons, a step -down procedure will be used to ensure the overall type I error rate is 
controlled at the 5% level. Each of the YKP3089 dosage groups will be compared with the 
placebo group according to the following hierarchy:  
1. 200-mg dosage group ve rsus placebo group  
2. 400-mg dosage group versus placebo group  
3. 100-mg dosage group versus placebo group  
[ADDRESS_439920] step. If no statistically significant difference  is detected between the 200 -mg dosage group 
and the placebo group, the procedure will stop and it will be concluded that none of the 
YKP3089 dosages are efficacious. If a statistically significant difference is detected between the 
200-mg dosage group and  the placebo group in favor of the 200 -mg dosage group, the procedure 
will proceed to the next step to compare the 400 -mg dosage group with the placebo group at a 2 -
sided 0.05 level. If a statistically significant difference is detected between the 400 -mg dosage 
group and the placebo group in favor of the 400 -mg dosage group, the procedure will proceed to 
the next step to compare the 100 -mg dosage group with the placebo group at a 2 -sided 0.05 level.  
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be fit to the ranked values of the primary 
efficacy endpoint . The ANCOVA will have terms for ranked baseline seizure rate and 
randomized treatment group. Ties will be handled using the default option in SAS    
It should be noted that the primary efficacy analysis us es a non -parametric approach. Because of 
this, effect sizes are not estimated and tested directly, since testing is made on the rank of the 
primary efficacy value. However, summary tables for the actual (not the ranked) primary 
efficacy endpoint  will be pr esented.   
Descriptive results of the primary efficacy end point will be provided for the subjects who were 
titrated under the original protocol.   
12.5.2  Primary Efficacy Analyses in the countries of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and 
South Africa  
The primary efficacy analysis of the primary endpoint will be based on the MITT -M population.   
The testing strategy for the primary efficacy endpoint (responder rate) is to compare each of the 
YKP3089 dosage groups with the placebo group. A step -down proc edure will be used to ensure 
the type I error rate due to multiple treatment comparisons is controlled at the 5% level. Each of 
the YKP3089 dosage groups will be compared with the placebo group according to the following 
hierarchy:  
1. 200-mg dosage group v ersus placebo group

test.   
12.6 Secondary Efficacy Analyses   
12.6.1  Secondary Efficacy Analysis in the countries of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, 
and South Africa  
The secondary efficacy analysis will be based on the MITT -M population.  
The secondary efficacy analysis is to compare each of the YKP3089 dosage groups with the 
placebo group for the percent reduction in seizure frequency.  
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be fit to the ranked values of the change in 
seizure frequency during the maintenance phase. The ANCOVA will have terms for ranked 
baseline seizure rate and randomized treatment group. Ties will be handled using the default 
option in SAS.  
It should be noted that the efficacy analysis uses a non -parametric approach. Because of this, 
effect sizes are not estimated and tested directly, since testing is made on the rank of the change

12.7 Additional Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
 
These secondary efficacy analyses will be based on the MITT or MITT -M population  
• Higher response rate of (75, 90 and 100%) of simple partial seizures with motor 
component plus complex partial seizures plus secondarily generalized tonic clonic 
seizures during the double -blind period and maintenance phase will be summarized.  
• Median perc ent change for partial seizure subtypes (including simple partial with motor 
component, complex partial, and secondarily generalized tonic -clonic seizures) will be 
summarized.   
• Seizure rate over time  will be analyzed using following scheme  
o A moving avera ge for each dose group will be computed using 4 week periods with 2 
week overlap beginning from Visit 3 (V3 -V5, V4 -V6, V5 -V6+2 weeks and so on)  
• For the QOLIE -31 analysis, changes from baseline (Visit 3) to the the  final value 
(defined as the last observation obtained in the double -blind phase) (Visit 9) for each 
treatment group will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Differences between 
each treatment group and the placebo group in the change from baseline  will also be

defined as a change from baseline ≥11.8 at the End Point for the weighted overall 
QOLIE -31 score. The incidence of subjects meeting the MIC criteria will be sum marized 
by [CONTACT_1570].  
• CGIC will be summarized using descriptive statistics for each treatment group and the 
placebo group.  
 
12.8 Safety Variable Analyses  
All ITT subjects will be evaluable for safety. The number and percent of subjects reporting  AEs 
(including treatment -emergent laboratory abnormalities) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_321169]. All serious AEs (SAEs) will be tabulated separately as well as included with all 
reported AEs.  
Physical and neurologic assessments , laboratory results, vit al signs (including orthostatic 
measurements) , ECGs , and C -SSRS will be summarized using descriptive statistics .

A Blinded Evaluation of the Effectiveness and Efficacy of the MyHealthyPregnancy Application Statistical 
Analysis Plan  
This study will evaluate the effectiveness and efficacy of the MyHealthyPregnancy App, an app designed 
to reduce preterm birth risk. This study will use observational cohort data collected at the University of 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_892521] 2019 and Febru ary of 2022.  
July 18, 2022

1. Description of the study   
 
MyHealthyPregnancy (MHP) was developed using decision science principles to help prevent  
preterm birth. An observational cohort trial was conducted at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_892522] 2019 until February 2022. This trial compare s the 
effectiveness of MHP to usual care for pregnant people who delivered at the University of 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_45589] (UPMC). Patients at UPMC were able to d ownload the MHP app 
after receiving a prescription for the app , as indicated by [CONTACT_892529] . Those who  were 
prescribed the app and downloaded it  were in the MHP cohort . Those who were prescribed the 
app and did not download it were in the usual care co hort . Prescriptions were offered to  
pregnant people by [CONTACT_892530] a n early  prenatal visit at UPMC.  
 
EHR data is available for both cohorts of patients. It is the source of all measures, unless 
otherwise noted.  
 
A linear  effects model will be used to evaluate effectiveness by [CONTACT_892531] , preventing preterm birth risk.  
 
For each dependent measure, these models will control for primary predictors, as identified in 
the research literature, that  are available in the EHR.  
 
A dose -response model will be used to  estimate the effects of continuous measures of non -
adherence (as opposed to dichotomous non-adherence, such as not initiating app use). 
Multiple measures of adherence will be analyzed , inclu ding measures of daily use, weekly  
use, time to initiation, and time from discontinuation to birth.  
 
1.1. Princip al research objectives  
 
1.1.1.   Primary objective  
To compare gestational weeks at birth , for the MyHealthy Pregnancy (MHP) cohort, 
defined as pregnant peo ple who download ed the MyHealthyPregnancy app , thereby  
[CONTACT_892532] , compared to the usual care  cohort , defined as pregnant 
people, who were invited to download  the app , but did not do so . Analyses  control for  
predictors of preterm birth.  
 
1.1.2.   Secondary objectives  
1. To compare preterm birth , defined as delivery before [ADDRESS_1250132] of each type of measure . 
 
 
1.2. Study  design including blinding  
 
Given  the nature of the observational study , patients and providers were not blinded to the 
treatment condition (MHP, usual care) .  
 
The primary statistician will remain blinded to the treatment and usual care cohorts w ith the 
exception of using 20% of the unblinded data to evaluate confounders of the outcomes, build a 
model for propensity score matching, and evaluate confounders of MHP app usage.  
 
1.3. Method of allocation of groups  
 
Participants seeking prenatal care at th e UPMC  were offe red a prescription to download the 
MyHealthyPregnancy app during an early prenatal visit. Participants were prescribed the app  by 
 
1 Gestational weight gain will be evaluated based on 2009  Institute of Medicine  guidelines  (11). Recommended 
gestational weight gain depends on pregravid BMI and  if it is a singleton or multiple pregnancy.  
their obstetrician  or the EHR system  and had the option of downloading the app and 
consenting to trial partici pation. We have no direct knowledge of how obstetricians decided 
whether to offer the prescription or  if there was encouragement to download the app in 
addition to the automated EHR prescription . Participants who downloaded the app will be 
categorized as t he MyHealth yPregnancy (MHP) cohort. Participants who did not download the 
app will be categorized as the usual care cohort.  
 
1.4. Data collection  
 
1.4.1.   Eligibility Screening  
Participants were included in the study if they  were offered a prescription for 
MyHealthyPregnancy , were at least [ADDRESS_1250133].  
 
1.5. Sample Size Justification  
 
Due to the observational nature of the study  and recruitmen t context , it was not possible to 
predetermine the sample size based on statistical power for estimat ing the primary and 
secondary outcomes. Instead, all participants who met the inclusion criteria between 
September 2019 and February 2022 were included . The final sample  has 12,344 deliveries , 
divided between the  MHP and usual care cohort s (with 7147 in one and 5197 in the other, with 
their identities currently blinded) . This represents about 12,287 different participants (we only 
have information about the percent of multiple deliveries for participants who downloaded the 
app, 0.464%). Given the sample sizes in the two cohort s, there is 80% power to detect an effect 
size of 0.[ADDRESS_1250134] 
deviation of 1 0 days  (1), the study has 80% power to  detect a 0. 51 day difference in gestational 
age at birth between the cohorts.  
 
1.6. Overview  of proposed analyses  
 
EG will analyze the primary, secondary, and exploratory outcomes for the trial data. LH will 
generate data and  run models  as needed so that EG remains blinded  to the identity  of each 
cohort  (see section 2.5 ).  
 
The primary analys es will be multiple linear regression  models estimat ing average treatment 
effects of  the MHP app. Secondarily, dose -response model s will be created for the primary and 
secondary outcomes in order to understand the moderating effects of app usage.  
 
The primary and secondary outcomes for the study will come from electronic health record 
(EHR) data for trial participants. Given the source  and the nature of care for women who 
deliver  in the UPMC system , few outcome data are missing data. As such, imputa tion will not 
be used to account for missing outcome data . Instead,  participants will be excluded from 
analyses , if their  outcome data  is missing for an outcome measure .  
 
As a sensitivity analysis, propensity score matching will be used to create similar cohorts of 
participants , exclud ing participants whose propensity scores are outside the overlap in the 
covariate distribution s for the covariates that predict downloading the MHP app  (see section 
3.1.5) . We will calculate average treatment effects for thes e matched subset s of participants. 
Inverse probability of treatment weighting will be used as an additional sensitivity analysis to 
account for the potential lack of overlap in covariate distributions between the study cohorts.  
 
2. Data analysis plan – data description  
 
2.1. Recruitment and representativeness of recruited patients  
 
A flow diagram will describe the flow of participants from prescription of the MHP app into the 
MHP and usual care  cohorts. The final diagram will be similar to Figure [ADDRESS_1250135] desired effects . As such, this study 
investigates app usage as a mediator of the outcome , rather than comparing users who did and 
did not meet a predetermined dosage.  
 
We will assess the following aspects of usage : how soo n after receiving the prescription 
participants in itiated app use  (in days) ; how soon  they discontinued app use prior to de livery  (in 
days since initiation) ; the percent age of days they used it overall  (within the usage period) ; and 
the percent age of weeks they used it  at least once (within the usage period) . See Appendix A 
for details  on the se use metrics . 
 
2.4. Loss to follow -up and other missing data  
 
Given data -sharing constraints with UPMC, outcome data is available only for participants who 
delivered at UPMC hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. LH will  report how many people downloaded the app and did not 
deliver at UPMC . This will allow us to estimate  the percent age of participants lost due to 
delivering out of the system.  
 
For included participants, there is  a very little missing data for the primary measure 
(80/[ZIP_CODE] =0.06% ). We  will assume that such data is missing at random and exclude 
participants whose data is missing for a measure from analyses  involving that measure . There is 
no missing data for the secondary measures. The same practice will be followed for the 
exploratory outcomes . No imputation  will be done  for any outcome measures .  
Missing categorical values for baseline covariates (baseline disease information and 
demographics) will not be imputed , but  treated as an additional category. Continuous variables 
missing less than 5% of the data wi ll be imputed with the median value for that variable. Two 
continuous baseline covariates are missing more than 5% of data ADI_NATRANK 
(1330/[ZIP_CODE]=9.7%) and PREGRAVID_WEIGHT (1318/[ZIP_CODE]=9.6%).  For these two variables, 
                 L     ’               used to investigate if the data is missing completely at 
random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), or missing not at random (MNAR)  on 20% of the 
unblinded data . If the data appears to be MCAR or MNAR, median imputation will be used. If the 
data is MAR, mult iple imputation will be used. If multiple imputation is needed, LH will generate 
data for the missing values so that EG remains blinded . For all missing data, we will conduct 
sensitivity analyses , repeating analyses  of primary and secondary outcomes  using imput ed 
values two standard deviations above and below the median. See Appendix A for the full list of 
collected baseline covariates . 
 
2.5. Development of outcome measurements  
 
EG will view 20% of unblinded data to determine wh ich potential confounders to include in the 
outcome model s, in the addition to those identified in advance , based on previous research. 
Section 3.1.[ADDRESS_1250136] deviation will be reported for the MHP and usual 
care cohorts. For binary variables, frequency and proportion will be reported.  
 
2.7. Exploratory metric  
 
As an exploratory metric, we may calculate the patient cooperativity index (PCI) (2), which 
                    q     y                   “          y  ”  x                             
app. The PCI is an odds ratio, where participants with a higher PCI are more likely to use the 
app one day after using it the previous day. In equation 2, p fs is the probability that a 
participant uses the app the day after not using the app and p ss is the probability that a 
participant uses the app the day after using the app. These probabilities will be calculated for 
participants who initiate use of the app, from that time until their last use.

3. Data analysis plan – inferential analysis  
 
3.1. Main analys es of treatment differences   
 
The main analysis compare s the mean gestational weeks at birth between the MHP and usual 
care  cohorts . An estimate of the average treatment  effect, 95% confidence interval, and effect 
size will be reported. EG will remain blind to the 80% of outcome data not used to set the terms 
of the analysis (Section 2.5) .   
 
The primary and secondary outcome s will be evaluated at the 5% significance level . No 
correction for chance will be used for the primary outcome , as there is only one test. For the 9 
secondary outcomes, we will report both  corrected and uncorrected p -value s, using the 
Bonferroni correction  to reduce risk of reporting a false positive result. As a sensitivity analysis, 
the Bonferroni corrected p -values for ten outcome values will be reported in the supplemental 
material of the report.  
 
All tests will include all participants with data on th e outcome measure  involved . 
 
3.1.1.   Analysis of primary outcomes  
The difference in gestational weeks at birth will be evaluated using a linear effects model 
accounting for confounders of preterm birth , as measured at baseline . We estimate that 
about 57 out of 12,344 deliveries are for a second pregnancy f or participants included in 
the sample given that 0.464% of participants who downloaded the app had two deliveries 
in the sample. We have included these women in the sample bec ause we cannot exclude 
similar women in the usual care cohort given limitations in our data. Likewise, we cannot 
account for random effects  of multiple deliveries  using a mixed effects model.  
 
Baseline study variables will be included as confounders in th e model if (a) the literature 
has identified the variable as a confounder of preterm birth risk  and (b) they might 
plausibly have                        ’                             . If, for a variable, the 
evidence on condition (a) is inconclusive and c ondition (b) is possible , we will examine the 
data and include  the variable  if it passes a 10% change -in-estimates threshold for the 
outcome or for the likelihood of downloading the app . The change -in-estimate will be 
calculated by [CONTACT_892533]. Only 
baseline variables will be  evaluated as potential confounders , as they could not have been 
affected by [CONTACT_892534].   
 
We will report the results of two models for each outcome, one using only confou nders 
identified in the literature and one adding confounders identified empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675]  (Appendix A). 
Including fewer confounders will reduce the likelihood that the average treatment effect 
applies only to an unrepresentative subset of the population. Includ ing additional 
confounders will reduce the likelihood of statistical bias in estimating  the average 
treatment effect.  
 
The dataset contains many kn own confounders of preterm birth that could be included in 
the model including : 
- Previous preterm birth  (3) 
- Race (3) 
- Low body -mass index  (3,4)    
- Insurance type  (5) 
- Area deprivation index  (6) 
- Multiple gestations  (3) 
- Previous spontaneous abortions  (7) 
- Hypertension  (3) 
- Diabetes  (3) 
- Tobacco use  (3) 
 
There are also many known predictors of preterm birth that are not in the EHRs, hence not 
available for this study . They  includ e educational attai nment , marital status, 
interpregnancy interval, relati ves who delivered preterm, and genetic predictors of 
preterm birth (3).  
 
Some co llected covariates are specific to this dataset. One is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_563845] , which may 
capture differences in resources, practices, and patient populations . The second is the 
date of the first visit recorded in Epic , which may capture factors like access to care  or 
social conditions (e.g., the pandemic) . We will  include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_892523] a variable in all 
models. We will  not include  date of first visit as  it might be correlated with ones that affect 
the effectiveness of the app over time.  
 
Residual plots will be used to evaluate the models for heteroskedasticity and the need for 
using robust standard errors , in order to allow for violations in the assumption that 
observations are independent and identically distributed (8).   
 
Differences between the cohorts will be described using adjusted mean differences and p-
values . Results will be considered significant at p<0.05.  
 
3.1.2.   Analysis of secondary outcomes  
Analytical procedures  for the secondary outcomes  will follow those  for the primary 
outcome . Each outcome will have its own appropriate confounders . As with the primary 
outcome, t hese confounders  will be based on previous research and specified a priori . As 
needed, they will be  supplemented by [CONTACT_62866][INVESTIGATOR_892524] 20% subset, including 
baseline covariates specified in Appendix B , with a 10% change -in-estimate  threshold for 
inclusion .  
 
These confounders from the literature are available : 
 
1. Preterm birth defined as delivery b efore 37 gestational weeks.  
a. Same confounders as the primary outcome  
2. Clinical diagnoses of depression.  
a. History of anxiety and depression (9)  
b. Smoking  (9) 
c. Past pregnancy complications or loss (9) 
Unavailable: Lack of partner or soci al support  or having a problematic 
relationship , a history of abuse or child abuse, having had an unplanned or 
unwanted pregnancy,  perceived stress, cognitive style (          “ pessimism, 
anger and rumination; a tendency to be nervous, worried or shy; low self-
esteem and low self -efficacy; and high levels of neuroticism or psychoticism ”) , 
and single marital status (9).  
3. Anxiety rates (using ICD10 codes ).  
a. Histo ry of anxiety and depression (9)  
b. Smoking (9) 
c. Past pregnancy c omplications or loss (9) 
Unavailable: Same as anxiety  (9).  
4. Referral to behavioral health  
a. No confounders identified  
5. Referral to social work  
a. No confounders identified  
6. Preeclampsia  
a. Prior pre -eclampsia  (10) 
b. Chronic h ypertension (10) 
c. Pre-gestational diabetes (10) 
d. BMI >30 (10) 
Unavailable: Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (10).  
7. Sufficient gestational weight gain  
a. Pre-pregnancy BMI (11) 
b. Age (11) 
Unavailable: Family violence;  marital status; food insecurity; maternal 
pregravid metabolic status; hyperemesis gravidarium; anorexia; past bariatric 
surgery  (11). 
8. Number of prenatal appointments attended  
a. No confounders identified  
9. Percent of required prenatal appointments attended  
a. No confounders identified  
  
3.1.3.   Analysis of exploratory outcomes  
For the exploratory outcomes , we will report only descriptive statistics specified in section 
2.6.  
 
3.1.4.   Dose -response analysis  
A dose -response analysis will be used to test usage as a mediator of each outcome. 
Multiple measurements of usage were col lected and are listed in Appendix A. Metrics 
specified in section 2.3 will be created by [CONTACT_892535] a given day. Logging into the app  without activity  will not count as app usage 
because this information was not collected for the full study  period. A ctivity use is also 
more likely to be associated with engagement with the app than is  login alone . Daily usage  
and weekly usage will be the dependent variables for the dose -response models . As an 
exploratory analys is, the PCI may be analyzed as a dependent variable.  The dose -response 
relationship will be analyzed for the primary and secondary outcomes using a multiple 
linear  effects model and the confounder adjustment method  (12). The model for 
adherence will be created using 20% of the unblinded data. The dose -response effect s for 
the primary outcome wil l be reported in the manuscript. The dose -response effect for the 
secondary outcomes will be reported in the supplemental material.  
 
3.1.5.   Additional statistical considerations  
Method for handling confounding by [CONTACT_892536], there may be incomplete overlap in covariates between the 
MHP and usual care cohorts. To account for this  possibility , inverse probability of treatment 
weighting will be used. P ropensity score matching  of comparable sub groups  will also be used   
and reported as a sensitivity analysis  (13).  
Propensity score matching works by [CONTACT_892537] . Logistic regression will be used to generate prop ensity scores ; 
nearest -neighbor matching without replacement will be used for matching. Baseline 
confounders will be included in the propensity score model , if they a re related to  the likelihood 
of receiving treatment and the outcome. Date of first visit  will not be included in the model  (for 
reasons given in Section 3.1.1) . Participants without similar propensity scores, defined as greater 
than  a caliper width, will be excluded from this sensitivity analysis. The average treatment 
effect will be calculate d for the included subset of similar participants.  
Austin recommends a  “caliper  width ,” defined as the difference between two propensity 
scores,  as “ q       0.                                                         y      ” (14). To 
balance the internal and external validi ty of this sensitivity analysis, this caliper width will be 
used , unless it excludes more than 20% of the sample. I n that case , the caliper width will be 
increased until 80% of the participants are included. If this is adjustment is needed, the results 
using the smaller caliper width will be reported in the supplemental material. Following  Austin 
(2011 ), standardized differences, QQ -plots, box plots, cumulative distribution functions, and 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_892525]  (13).  
Time -effects  
For the primary models, we have chosen not to include  the first appointment date as it could 
capture factors that affect the effectiveness of the app. During the study time frame, many 
outside factors could have affected the outcomes, especially due to the COVID -[ADDRESS_1250137], the date of the 
parti      ’                                     .

Data will be delivered to EG through a HIPAA -compliant password protected sharefile site. The data 
will be downloaded in a csv format and R will be used for data description and analysis.

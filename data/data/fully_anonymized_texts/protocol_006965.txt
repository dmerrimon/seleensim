2.0 Introduction  
Background for Persistent PTH:  Prevalence and incidence of mTBI and persistent 
post traumatic headache (PTH) are increasing among Veterans of Operation Enduring 
Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)  (McKenzie -Hartman 2017 ). 
Persistent PTH and associated physical, functional disability as well as decreased 
quality of life significantly impact OEF/OIF veterans. The recent opi[INVESTIGATOR_205427]. Many OEF/OIF 
vetera ns are in the prime of their lives and are desperately in need of non -
pharmacological treatment for this chronic debilitating neurological disorder, to lead a 
more productive life at work and home. Persistent PTH likely has multidimensionality: 
When headac hes become persistent over years after mTBI, biopsychosocial and 
behavioral factors modulate the brain circuits beyond those involved in pain perception, 
resulting in dys -synchronization of intrinsic functional brain networks responsible for 
saliency modul ation (salience network), goal directed behavior (executive network) and 
sense of self (default mode network). This process is likely similar to that of chronic 
migraine, as we have elucidated in a recent study (Androulakis et al. 2017, 2018) . 
Potential of remote tDCS for persistent PTH:  The Veterans Health administration, US 
Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Disease Control all support 
use of evidence based non -pharmacological tr eatment for chronic pain. tDCS 
(transcranial direct current stimulation) has gained attention as a noninvasive 
neuromodulatory  approach for depression, chronic migraine, cognitive impairment 
involving attention, working memory and executive function, loss of inhibitory control, 
sleep disturbance and aphasia.  (Kang, Kim, and Paik 2012 ; Demirtas -Tatlidede et al. 
2012 ; Baker, Rorden, and Fridriksson 2010 ; Angelakis et al. 2014 ; Andrade et al. 2017) . 
A system atic review and meta -analysis from [ADDRESS_245013] that tDCS could be a 
promising non-pharmacological  alternative treatment for migraine pain. It may be 
particularly useful for individuals seeking to reduce the use of acute pain medications 
(Shirahige et al. 2016 ; Stagg and Nitsche 2011) .  
tDCS mechanism:  The exact mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of tDCS in pain 
modulation are yet to be elucid ated. Mounting evidence in pre -clinical and clinical 
studies suggests that tDCS can modify the neuronal excitability (Stagg and Nitsche 
2011 ; Jackson M et al. 2016 ; Brunoni AR 2012) and is capable of improving connectivity 
of large -scale  brain networ ks via improved synchronization  (Peña -Gómez et al. 2012) . 
 Protocol  – Version 11/12/2019  Page 7 of 21 
 tDCS may  modulate mu -opi[INVESTIGATOR_205428], interfere with excitatory and in hibitory 
balance by [CONTACT_205443], as well as influence the cortical 
thalamic network in pain control (Jackson et al. 2016;  Dasilva et al. 2012; DosS antos et 
al. 2014; DosSantos et al. 2012; Foerster et al. 2015) . Clinical trials using remotely 
administered  tDCS for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson’s disease validated 
cumulative benefit of remote tDCS administration (Charvet et al. 2018; Dobbs et al. 
2018) . However, the effects of tDCS on persistent PTH have yet to be evaluated in 
remotely administered , at-home setting.  
tDCS Stimulation Sites for persistent PTH:  Analysis of one of our recent fMRI studies 
revealed that node to node functional connectivity of the bilateral dorsolateral pr efrontal 
cortex (dlPFC) within the salience network (SN) and central executive network (CEN), 
important in top down cognitive con trol of pain (Androulakis et al. 2017, 2018), is  
abnormal in chronic migraine. Migraine and chronic migraine are the comm on 
phenotypes in persistent PTH.  Earlier tDCS studies (outpatient clinic settings) in 
migraine used tDCS to: 1. Increase resting membra ne potential in M1 via anodal 
stimulation, with the reference electrode placed over the contralateral supraorbital (SO) 
cortex, 2. Decrease resting membrane potential over Oz via cathodal stimulation with 
the reference electrode placed over Cz, and 3. Incr ease resting state membrane 
potential in the left dlPFC (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) via anodal stimulation, with the 
reference electrode placed over SO (Andrade et al. 2017; Shirahige et al.  2016) . 
Among these different electrode configurations, left dlPFC was found to be more 
effective than left M1 for pain control . We plan to place Cathodal electrode over Oz 
instead of contralateral OS because we want to avoid the possibility of inhibiting the 
contralateral PFC or interior frontal gyrus near the traditional c athodal site supraorbital 
(SO).  Mood irritability and disinhibition are frequent symptoms associated with 
mTBI and persistent PTH.  Inadvertently inhibiting brain regions near SO such as 
contralateral PFC or inferior frontal gyrus, which is important in behavior disinhibition, 
depression, and other neuropsychological symptoms prevalent in mTBI, m ay cause 
unwanted side effects . Given the lower threshold of neuronal excitability in occipi[INVESTIGATOR_205429] (Aurora et al. 1998), we suspect that similar underpi[INVESTIGATOR_205430].  Interestingly, targeting cathodal stimulation site over Oz 
effectively reduced pain intensity in migraine patients (Antal et al. 2011) . Furthermore, 
cathodal stimulation over Oz will effectively decrease cortical hyperexcitability in visual 
cortex without interfering the cortical descending inhibitory pathways on the 
contralateral side. In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799],  we propose a novel electrode pla cement 
montage in which the stimulating (anodal) electrode is placed over the left dlPFC 
(F3) and a single reference (cathodal) electrode is placed over the lower occipi[INVESTIGATOR_205431] (Oz).   Our computational model demonstrates the current flow for this 
configur ation(Figure 1).

Figure 1: A computational model demonstrates the electrical field intensity using the 
tDCS mini Clinical Trial device: Anodal electrode placed over F3 (left dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex), cathodal electrode placed over Oz.  
Advantage  of remote administration monitored by [CONTACT_205444] : Remotely 
administrated tDCS with real -time video monitoring, delivered to veterans at home, 
offers unique advantages in terms of travel arrangement, healthcare utilization, 
increased treatment sessions,  recruitment for future clinical trials with larger sample 
size, and preventing high dropout rates associated with tDCS administered in an 
outpatient setting. Furthermore, combining remote tDCS technology w ith mindfulness 
meditation via VA health system su pported Mindfulness Coach program , and other 
cognitive/physical/occupational rehabilitation therapy may pr ovide synergistic effects. 

 Protocol  – Version 11/12/2019  Page 9 of 21 
 Multiple tDCS treatments are necessary for optimal and sustained benefit, especially 
when combined with cognitive training to enhance overall outcome  (Kasschau et al.; 
Martin et al. 2014; Elmasry et al. 2015; Brunoni et al. 2014) . We propose a new 
clinical tDCS paradigm which will enable safe, longer, r epetitive tDCS treatment 
combined with mindfulness meditation, while maintaining the treatment fidelity 
through video monitoring.  Based on the data generated from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we plan 
to submit a larger scale, randomized clinical trial to investigate the efficacy  of remotely 
administered tDCS with real -time monitoring  for PTH in a phase II study. Ultimately, we 
hope that clinical application of this new delivery method of tDCS will facilitate outreach 
to rural communities, where Veterans have limited a ccess to care related to persistent 
PTH.

5.0 Study Procedures  
5.1 Study Design  
 
Participants  will receive a total of 20 sessions with 20 minutes of tDCS stimulation 
administered during each weekday (see flow chart for details). The  anode will be placed 
over the left dlPFC (F3) according to international 10 -20 EEG system, and the cathode 
will be placed at Oz. Using this montage, computational modelling demonstrates the 
flow of current from left PFC region to the occi pi[INVESTIGATOR_205433], with no current flow over right 
PFC or inferior frontal cortex (Figure 1).  Sham stimulation will be delivered using the 
conventional method of rampi[INVESTIGATOR_205434] 2.[ADDRESS_245016] minute of the session , no 
current are delivered in between . During the 20 -minute treatment session, both 
treatment and sham groups will complete mindfulness meditation via VA health system 
approved program (Mindfulness Coach).  
This will be  a randomized, double -blind study of [ADDRESS_245017]’s correct randomized treatment group . Patients will be randomized equally to 
stimulation group versus sham groups using randomization function with a statistical 
software  (R). This person (nurse)  will keep a secure randomization log  and will not be 
involved in the screening, baseline, treatment sessions or follow -up visits. The blind 
may be broken if it becomes medically necessary to reveal which treatment a patient 
received. The investigator may contact [CONTACT_205447] a subject’s  treatment.  
All participants will undergo vital sign and BMI evaluation, a neurological examination 
and complete a medical  questionnaire and to ascertain demographics including age, 
sex, race, marital status, educational level, and clinical characteristics to include:  the 
headache features, medications, medical/surgical history, family history, HIT -6, 
Rivermead Post -Concussion Symptoms (PCS) q uestionnaire,  depression severity as 
 Protocol  – Version 11/12/2019  Page 11 of 21 
 measured by [CONTACT_205441] -9, ISI, PTSD severity as measured by [CONTACT_88806] -5, insomnia as measure d 
by [CONTACT_205448] a Severity Index (ISI),  and anxiety as measured by B eck Anxiety Inventory 
(BAI). Detailed descriptions for each questionnaire above are included in 
appendix . A tolerability test using the tDCS device will be done  at first clinic visit  for 
each patient to confirm each subject can tolerate current stimulation. Patient that fail the 
tolerability task will be considered a screen -fail and will be discontinued from the study. 
Before  the first and after the last tDCS session , participant’s he art rate will be monitored 
via electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) while completing a physical and cognitive stress 
test. This will enable us to determine changes in heart rate variability at the start of 
treatment to the end of treatment phases. A more detaile d description for the EKG 
tasks is included in Study Evaluations.  We will use the daily headache diary  to 
record changes in headache symptoms throughout the study .  
Due to the differences in how individuals describe pain, we will adopt the following 
defini tion for headache severity:  
• Mild headache is defined as a nagging, annoying headache with little to no 
interference with daily activity.  
• Moderate headache is defined as headache that is bothersome, interferes 
significantly with daily activity, and usuall y requires medication.  
• Severe headache is defined as a disabling or intolerable pain that causes 
inability to perform routine daily activity (details are described in our patient 
questionnaires).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 Protocol  – Version 11/12/[ADDRESS_245018] has been submitted through DART for access to the TBI registry for pre-
screening purposes.  Potential subjects will be approached in clinic s (neurology and 
rehab)  by a member of the health care team or study personnel to assess interest in 
participating in the tDCS study. Recruitment flyers will be utilized in Neurology an d 
rehab clinics. In addition, p otential subjects identified through electronic medical records 
or clinic lists may be mailed  a letter providing an overview of the tDCS study.  An initial 
eligibility screen may  be done via phone  and will contain general inf ormation such as 
social demographics (i.e. age, sex, race), medical history and headache characteristics 
(appendix for PTH questionnaire) . If the phone interview determines that the subject is 
potentially eligible, an appointment will be made for an in -person screening visit. Every 
effort will be made to include minority and women in this study.  
 
Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Human Subjects & Others  
Study participants may or may not benefit from their participation.  All participants will 
receive tDCS (treatment vs sham) and mindfulness meditation . Self -efficacy may be  
greatly improved by [CONTACT_205449], 
autonomous role in their health.  Ther e is also monetary compensation for  completing 
the tDCS sessions . The re are potential benefits to other chronic post traumatic 
headache sufferers and to the scientific community,  as we will develop a better 
understanding of the benefit and risk associated with at home tDCS administration. 
Given the paucity of risks, and the precautions and procedures to minimize those that 
do exist  (as de scribed in the previous section ), this study is reasonable in relation to its 
anticipated benefits.  
 
Importance of the kn owledge to be gained  
Results of the proposed research will make a significant contribution to the scientific 
knowledge regarding the feasibility and safety of remotely administrated tDCS for 
persistent PTH. The proposed clinical studies may lead towards id entification of novel 
tDCS stimulation targets, utilization of telehealth for PTH, which help improve the 
management of persistent PTH.  
 
Protection Against Risks  
 Protocol  – Version 11/12/2019  Page 13 of 21 
 Notification of Screening Results : Participants will be notified that they have passed 
or fai led the screening directly in person. This notification will occur as soon as 
information regarding eligibility becomes available. For example, if a screening failure 
occurs during an interview, the participant will be told that they do not meet study 
criteria and will be sent home without completing additional screening procedures. In 
the case of a screening failure, all documents containing a participant’s personal health 
information will be destroyed.  
 
Confidentiality : Every effort will be made to keep the information in the study 
confidential, as described in “Sources of Materials”. In the case of screen failures, all 
documents containing the participant’s health information will be destroyed. All data files 
and analyses will be performed on VA res earch computers using only code numbers to 
identify participants. Only summaries of group data will be reported in any  publications 
or presentations, with no identification of individuals. Adverse Events: All adverse 
events will be reported to the IRB imme diately by [CONTACT_976], Co -I or research assistant.  
 
5.3 Informed Consent Procedures  
 
Recruitmen t: All participants will be recruited from Dorn VA medical center neurology 
clinic . Additional participants may be recruited from TBI clinic  and TBI registry  if 
necessar y. A HIPAA waiver will be applied for to permit use of the phone screen. If the 
phone pre-screening interview determines that the subject is potentially eligible, an 
appointment will be made for an in -person screening visit. Every effort will be made to 
include minority and women in this study.  
 
Informed Consent : Written informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_976], Co -I, or research 
assistant/coordinators. The person obtaining informed consent will review the consent 
form in detail with the participants. The subjects will be encouraged to ask any 
questions they may have regarding the study and consent procedures. Once the 
subjects demonstrated an acceptable level of comprehension, consent will be obtained.

5.5 Study Evaluations  
 
tDCS Protocol: The first tDCS session combined with mindfulness meditation will be 
completed in the clinic after training on how to operate the device and a brief (60 
 Protocol  – Version 11/12/2019  Page 15 of 21 
 second) tolerability test in clinic (some participants with sensitive scalps may be too 
uncomfortable to  participate). Before the first tDCS session in the clinic we will utilize a 
standard 3 -lead electrocardiogram (EKG) to measure participant’s heart rate 
sequentially during a motor and cognitive task and at rest in order  to assess heart rate 
variability (H RV) following tDCS treatment. This assessment, including set -up and 
transition between tasks, is expected to last approximately 30 -35 minutes. The order of 
EKG measures will be as follows: 6 -minute resting baseline, 6 -minute physical stressor, 
6-minute res ting recovery, 6 -minute cognitive stressor, and 6 -minute resting recovery. 
During the resting assessments, participants will be seated comfortably at a 45 -dregree 
angle while their heart rate is monitored. For the physical stress assessment, 
participants w ill squeeze a hand dynamometer (Baseline Pneumatic Squeeze Bulb 
Dynamometer, Baseline Products, Ventura CA) at approximately 30% of their maximum 
hand -grip contraction while seated in the same manner. During the cognitive stress 
assessment, participants wi ll complete an executive function task (2 -back task) while 
seated in the same manner. The [ADDRESS_245020] similar to the classic 
memory game. 2 back, n=2, has the person remember the item from two turns back. 
This task will be administe red to the patient electronically via pc. Once the first in -clinic 
session is complete, p articipants will be discharged with a tDCS study kit (tDCS device, 
headset, sponges, saline solution, extra batteries). Participants will be given instructions 
on comp leting treatment sessions at home using the secure VA Telehealth platform  and 
the VA mindfulness coach application . If participants don’t have access to a tablet or 
computer at home they will be provided with a VA approved tablet  with wireless 
connection d uring their participation in the study. Subsequent visits will be completed 
via the VA Telehealth platform with real -time supervision by a study coordinator or 
investigator. Participants will be supervised throughout the entire treatment session to 
ensure strict adherence to the device safety measures and study stop criteria (Charvet 
et al. 2017).  Side effects and tolerability will be monitored at each visit by [CONTACT_205452], paresthesia, any other discomfort or any unexpected 
events. Headache severity ratings of mild, moderate or severe will be recorded before, 
during and after each tDCS session. Participants will return to the clinic to complete the 
last treatment session. During this last session, participant’s heart rate wil l be monitored 
via EKG following the same procedures and tasks as stated above for the first in -clinic 
tDCS session.  The table below summarizes the procedures that will be done 
during each session throughout the study.

number of treatment sessions, i ntensity, and duration ( 10 participants will receive active 
stimulation applied to left dlPFC, 10 will receive sham treatment applied to left dlPFC, 
both groups will receive the same mindfulness med itation during the tDCS session ). 
The administrator is then presented with a unique one -time activation code generated 
for each stimulation session. These codes will be stored at a secure location in our VA 
medical center. These parameters cannot be altered  without the access code of the 
administrator, any attempts to deliver un -authorized sessions (such as prolonged 
treatment session, atypi[INVESTIGATOR_205435]) will results in device shu tdown . Electrodes 
impedance will be measured in real -time and displayed on the device screen and 
viewed by [CONTACT_205455]. Mini -CT tDCS can be remotely 
discontinued through its portal (ElectraRX  program) if non -compliance is found during  
the treatment sessions.  Patients will be given a package consisting customized 
headgear with electrodes (Anode on F3 and cathode on Oz), stimulation unit, sponges, 
and batteries. The unique electrodes (SNAP pad) allow loading onto headgear (SNAP 
strap) at fixed locations preventing incorrect electrode placement  and a pi[INVESTIGATOR_205436].  The SNAP electrodes 
are pre -saturated with saline and carbon electrodes are pre -inserted to prevent 
potential electrode preparation error s (saline saturation level, direct contact [CONTACT_205456], etc.). The mini-CT device has extensive regulatory 
approvals worldwide (EU -CE, Canada - Health Canada, Australia, etc.) and is 
approved for investigational  use in the [LOCATION_003].   
 
5.6 Data Analysis  
Sample size and statistical analysis:  A total of 2 4 veterans will be included in this 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  Descriptive statistics will establish baseline demographics, clinical 
characteristics, study completion rate (session discontinuation rate , and adverse event 
frequency.  Comparison between treatment and sham control groups will be performed 
using two -tailed independent sample t -tests , and liner regression . Comparison of 
pretreatment and post -treatment scores in both groups will be calculated using paired -
samples two -tailed t -tests. Statistical analysis will be performed using IBM SPSS 
Statistic 23.  Reductio n and extraction of HRV indexes from EKG assessments will be 
performed with Kubios HRV, version 2.0 (Biosignal Analysis and Medical Imaging 
Group, Kuopio, Finland).  
 
5.7 Withdrawal of Subjects  
As part of the consent process, subjects are advised that their  participation to this study 
is voluntary and that they are free to withdraw their consent and discontinue 
participation in the study at any time throughout the study, without negative 
consequences to their relationship with their care at VAMC.

7.0 Privacy and Confidentiality  
Every effort will be made to keep the information in the study confidential, as described 
in “Sources of Materials”. In the case of screen failures, all documents containing the 
participant’s health information will be destroyed. All data files and analyses will be 
performed on VA research computers  with password prot ection  using only code 
numbers to identify participants. Only summaries of deidentified group data will be 
reported in any  publications or presentations  following VA data management and 
access policy .  
Adverse Events: All adverse events will be reported to  the IRB immediately by [CONTACT_976], Co -I 
or research assistant.

Amendment made to the original protocol  
1. Due to COVID pandemic in 2020, all clinical trial activities in our facility was 
shut down for 6 months, subsequently  our study was allowed to resume after 
changing  the study  protocol to minimize in -person clinic visit. As such, one of 
the secondary outcomes  as removed from our Aims : evaluate the changes in 
modulatory capacity of patients’ cardio -autonomic function as a measure of 
heart rate variability (HRV) from baseline pe riod to end of treatment phase.  
2. Additionally, w e also changed last tDCS in -clinic visit to telehealth visit. 
Participants were provided prepaid label s to send the device / tablets back to 
research office after completion of all RS -tDCS sessions.  
3. Lastly, we have changed post -tDCS follow up  period  to 4 weeks. In the original 
protocol, participants were  followed up at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks after 
tDCS/sham  treatment. Due to significant burden of post traumatic headache on 
veterans  with TBI , we have observed that many  participants had difficulty to 
continue follow up after [ADDRESS_245024] veterans' quality of life.
